What I have reported concerning this Mountain, will doubtlefi caufe no final I wonder in thofe who have read the Travels of Father (Philip, a Barefoot Carmelite, that he fliould undertake to lay that the Terreftrial Paradife lies there Tlain GOD preferves from Heat and for thole are the words of his Tranflator. The thought it felf leems to me to be ve ry plealant; and I fhould have thought he had fpoke it jocu larly, did he not relate with an extraordinary ferioufnefs fe- veral things in the fame Book which are altogether as impro bable. At the Foot of the Mountains, in a Village inhabited by Chriftians, ftands a Monaftery , call'd or the Monajiery of the Jpoftles ; to which place the pay a very folemn Devotion. For they report that the Bodies of St. Andrew and St. Matthew were found there, and that the Scull of the Evangelift is ftill preferv'd in the Church belong ing to the Monaftery. When I came to Erivan, I alighted at the Houfe of an Ar menian of my Acquaintance, whofe Name was Mari as. He was a Perlbn extreamly perfecuted by thofe of his own Nati on, becaufe he had been at %omto turn Roman Catholick, and Difciple to the Colledge for the and for endeavouring to fettle the at Erivan. I found him indifpos'd and in Bed. However he rofe to give Notice of my Arrival; fearing to come into trouble if he de- ferr'd it till the next Morning. To which purpofe he went to Court, but could not lee the Governor who was retir'd in to the Apartment of the Princefs his Wife; Neverthelefs an Eunuch did his Meffage. The Eighth, the Governor lent a Perfon to give me a Vifit, and to tell me I was Welcom. Whereupon Mr. un dertook to go in my behalf and return him my humble Thanks, and withal to let him know who I was Upon which the Governor (hew'd an earneft defire to fee me as foon as I could, and fome pare of the Jewels I had brought along with me. Afterwards he ask d how many Servants I had, and order'd Mr. A%arias to inform him whether I had rather Lodge in the Fortrefs, or in the Inn which he had built, and to bring hitn Word Ipeedily. For my part I made choice of the Inn, as well for the Security of the Place, as for that a Man iliall ne ver there want Company, becaule of the great relbrt of Mer- + chantsthrough the BJack-Sea, and Colchis* chants thitiherj befides that Travellers alighted there every day. Thereupon the Governor order'd me one of the beft Apartments. The Ninth, I went thither betimes in the Morning, and fpenc all that day in {etling my felf in my Lodging. About Noon one of the Governors Officers brought me an Order from the Steward to fend for from the Office Bread, Wine, Meat, Troucs, Fruit, Rice, Butter, Wood, and other Neceffary Pro- vifions as much as would fuffice fix Perfons. The Quantity of every thing is regulated, never augmented nor abated : but the Propottion aliow'd for one Perfon is fo large, that two may well be fatisfy'd with it. The i oth, the Governor lent fo earneftly for me to Come to him, and bring him part of my Jewels, that I could no lon ger defer it. I found him in a very large Cabinet or Study, very Decent and very Light. There was alio with him the Head Surveyor of all the Mints of who at that time was come to Erivan, and four other Lords. He receiv'd me with an Extraordinary Civility, three times told me, I was welcome, and fet before me Sweet Meats, and Jqtta Vita of Mofcovy. Prefently I prefented him with the Kings Patent, and that of the Grand Matter, already mention'd. Of both which he made great accompt, and fpent an Hour in Enquiries after News, as well concerning the late Wars, and the prelent Eftate of Chtiftendom, as about Arts and Sciences, and what new Difcoveries had been made therein. Another Hour he (pent in confidering and viewing the Pretious Stones and Jewels which I (hew'd him. He gave me to underftand, that among the ferftan Poets, Emraulds of the old Rock were call'd Emraulds of Egypt, of which they believ'd there had been a Mine in Egypt which was now lofti and at length, af ter he had lay'd by what he lik'd himfelf, and what he thought would pleafe the Princefs his Wife, he ftay'd me to dine with him. Dinner being ended, he honour'd me the other half Hour with his Company and then difmifs d me, commanding an Officer in my hearing to go to the and charge the Inn-Keeper to be careful as well for my fecurity, as to give me all Content. And he was moreover fo kind as to tell the Officer farther, that he made him my who is as it were a Gentleman-Waiter, and fuch as are appointed to attend upon all Perfons of Quality to take care of their Perfons: and the fame Evening he font me befides a Prefent of Aqua Vita*s The Ti ravels of Sir John Chardm into Perfia, This Governor bears the Title of Seder-Beg, or Lord of Lord j . For fo they call the Deputy Lieutenants of large Go vernments j to diftinguifh 'em from thofe meaner Governours whom they call Cans. He has alfo the Title of or Ge neral of the Army. So that he is one of the Principal Lords of ferfia, and one of the moft Judicious and mofl: refin'd Po liticians in the Kingdom. He is call'd by the Name of Coith-Cati ; or the 'Duke, the Slav Sephi. He enjoy'd one of the moft Noble Governments of the Empire in the Reign of the Deceas'd King, but through fome Intreague among the Women, he fell into difgrace, three Years before the Death of that Prince. The Wife which he has Marry'd is of the Blood Royal by the Mothers fide. And this Princels it was, who at the beginning of the prefent Kings Reign, reftor'd her Husband to his Majefties Favour, from whom in a little time he obtain'd the Government of the moft confiderable in the Kingdom, and which yields him the faireft Revenue, no lefs then Two and Thirty Thoufand Tomans a Year, which are above a Hundred and Twelve Thoufand Pounds Sterling. The Fines, Prefents, and indirect ways to enrich himfelf, are worth him Fifty Thoufand Pounds more. And doubtlefs this Lord is the moft wealthy and moft Fortunate of all the King dom. The King loves him, the Court has a Veneration for him, and his two Sons are the Kings only Favourites: the Peo ple under his Government Love and refpeft him, becaufe of his Popularity, his doing Juftice, and for that he is not fo op- preffive and given to extortion as others. ?o that he deferves the good Fortune he enjoys; for befides thefe good Qualities, he is Learned, and a great Lover of Arts and Sciences. The r ith, this Lord fent to invite me to theNuptialsof his Stewards Brother where he was. I found him pleafant and in a very good Humour. For he had receiv'd at the opening of the Gate, an order from the King by a Coolom-Sha, who came from Ifpahan in Thirteen Days. This Order related to an affair of great Importance. For feveral who are Lords of Goun- tiys and Governours of ftrong Holds, having refus'd to obey his Orders, and having made great complaints againft him to the King and his Mmifters; He on the other fide had juftifi'd his own Rights and Prerogatives ; upon which his Majefty had given Sentence in his behalf, and had fent him an or der to Command Obedience. Which Order the d was to lee Executed, and to caufe Satisfaction to be piv'n to the Governour. Coolom-through the Black ^Sea, and Colchis. Coolom-Sha fignifies the Kjngs Not but that thev who bear this Title are as free, as other the Kings Natural Subjeds; but they take it as a Mark of their perfca Devo- tion t6 their Soveraign, as being that to which they were bred up altogether in their Infancy. For the Imployment of thefe Kings Slaves in the Court of Tis almoft the fame with that of Gentlemen-Ufliers ; who are Childern of good Quali' ty, employ'd very young in Duty, as Well for the Profit which they get by it, as to give 'em a fair Opportunity to make their way to Preferment at Court. There are fome Perfons who fend their Sons to thele Imployments at the Age of Five Years* To whom the King affigns Exhibitions according to the Quali ty of their Family, or the Service which it does the King ; for that ferves in ftead of other Recompence to the Parents. The ufual Exhibition is Twenty 'toman a Year, an i their Diet; which Twenty Tomans make about Seventy Pounds Sterling : And the Diet taken in Money amounts to about Forty Pounds. But thefe Exhibitions are frequently enlarg'd proportionably either to the Service which they do the King, or to the Kind- nels which the King has for their Perfons. For which reafon they are very diligent at Court, and are employ'd in the Exe cution of all Orders of Importance. They are fent with the Kings Prefents to the Governors; and out of their Number are taken feveral to fupply the Vacancies of Officers. Orders that require Expedition are carry'd Poft. Which Couriers are call'd TJhapars ; a word that comes from a word that fignifies Galloping, whence that other word which fignifies a Courier. Thefe make great hafte, though they do not always meet with Horfes when they have occafion for 'em: For there are no fetl'd Stages in all the In Ferfia the Kings and Governors Couriers take Horfes where- ever they find 'em â€¢,nay, they have Authority to difinounc Travellers upon the High-way : befides, the Magiftrates of the Places through which they pafs, are oblig'd to furnifli 'em. However, this is a very mifchievous Cuftom ; for fuch as have neither the Strength nor the Courage to refill, are conftrain'd to give Money to thefe Couriers, or to alight and fuffer their Horfes to be rid away with, arid then to run after 'em if they intend to have em again. Neverthelefs they dare not meddle with Perfons of Quality, nor the Kings Officers, nor Strangers that are going to the Court, for fear of being call'd to Que- ftion. Ufually therefore they take up Horfes in the Villa ges through which they pafs j which they muft not make U u u u(e258 the Trawls of Sir John Gliardin Perfia, life of however abote one Days Journey 5 for which reafon rhey generally fend a liunner along with 'em to bring the Horfes back. Thefe Couriers are eafily known by their Habit For they Wear a Cloak ty'd behind 'em ; and a little Cloak-bag, which runs through the Pommel, and is faften'd to the Saddle-BoW. They carry a Poniard, a Sword, and a Quiver by their Sides, and a Cudgel in their Hands. Their Bows hang about their Shoulders j befides all which they have a Scarf that comes twice about their Necks, which is brought down Crols-wife upon their Backs and Breads, and ty'd to their Girdle. When they are defcry'd at a diftance, they who are afraid of being difmounted, flee out of the way and hide themfelves, or com pound for Money, or elfe offer etn their Horfes. Thefe Cou riers ride generally two and two, and if they be Perfons of Quality, 'tis the more difficult to get rid of 'em; for they will take no Compofition i and upon the leaft Refiftance, they ei ther up with their Battoons, or out with their Swords, Well knowing they {hall be upheld in what they do; which is a Vio lence that other Couriers dare not offer. One of the Principal Extraordinary Expences which the Grandees are conftrained to be at, is when the King fends em his Orders or Prefents by a Coolom-Sh or by any othet Peffon of Quality 5 for he muft Cloath him upon his Arrival, and at his Departure he mufi: make him a Prelent anlwerable to his Imployment, and the Reputation that he bears 5 befides that he muft be well Feafted and Entertained all the time of his ftayi This Coelom-Sba that I (peak of, coft the Governor of Erivan, as I was inform'd. Four Hunderd Totnam , which amount to Fourteen Hunderd Pounds befides Lodging and Diet. Many times the King himfelf Taxes the Prefent which is to be giv'n to the Perfen whom he fends, but then the Per- fon is oblig'd to pay it prefently down as a Debt, and to be llow in Gifts and Largefles many times double the Prelent : in fhort, they treat their Meffengers according to their Birth, their Merit, and their Credit at Court. This they diligently obferve, fo that when they underftand that a Meflenger or his Relations have free Accefs to the King, then they are more free in their Entertainment, to the end he may make an Ad vantageous Report of his Ufage, and the Civility fhewn him. I remember to this purpofe, in the Year 1669 when the King conferr'd upon the Son of the Prime Mmifter, the Com mand of Colonel of the Musketeers, his Ma;cfty fent the Dif- patchesthrough the Black-Sea, md Coumry Colchis. 259 patches and Habit by his Ooldfmichs, to reward 'em for feme fevtfels ^hich they had made to his liking j and chat he Tax'd the Ptefent which the Colonel Was to give em at Three Mtm- derd Tomans. Thereupon four of the chief Goldfmiths car- ry 'd the Difpatches and the Habit, who inftead of Three Hun- derd receiv'd 400 Tomans, which make Fourteen Hundred Pounds, and a Prefent befides in Stuffs. I ftay'd three Hours at the Wedding, and took my leave after Dinner. The Feaft was kept in a low Dining-Room, tais'd about two Foot, opening into a Coutx which was Rail'd about like a Tilt-Yard, where feveral Wreftlefs and Gladiators divertis'd the Company, while the Governor fpent his time in looking on, and difcourfing fometimes with the Kings Meffen- gers, fometiines with the Company, and tbiftetimes talking with my felf about the news of Europe* There were but nine perfons at the Feaft,among whom the Bfidegroom and his God father were fumptuoufly habited,fheir Turbants being garnifh'd^ with Heron-Tuffs, fee With previous Stones. The Mafter of the Houfhold, his other Brothers and bis Sons (landing upon their Feet at the lower end of the Room, With leveral of tha Governoarl Officers. Every One of the GUefts Were farv'd at their firft coming, with a Voider of Sweat-Meats Dry and Wet, upon fmall Porcelaine Plates j the Voiders themfelves ibeing of Wood Painted and Gilt j fo that nothing could be feen more Neat. 11 Matrimony in tyerjid is very cxper^five, ircquGncly to the Ruin of thofe that engage in it t So that only Perfons of Eftates will venture Upon it: as for the meaner iort, they are conten ted with a Concubine or a Slave. The Mdhometant that follow the TcnenW of AU-, fake theif Wives after three manners, either by Way of Parchafe, by way of Hire, or by Marriage. All which three ways they hold to be Lawful. Their Religion allows and teaches 'em this Liber ty ; and the Civil LaW acknowledges the Childcrn Born in any of thefe three forts of Wedlock, ro be equally Legitimate. So that if a Man have a Son by his Slave, before his Marty d Wife brings him one, the Son of the Slave is acknowledge for the Eldeft, and en)oys all the Priviledges of Elderfliip to the Exclufion of the Son of the Lawful Wife, be (he a Pnu- cefs and of the Blood Royal. And therefore in QnaJlty* and Nobility defeends only front the Father. Tht1 z6o The 'Tray els of Sir John Chardin into Perfia, The Wives, who are Slaves, arecall'd of whom the Law allows a Man to have as many as he can maintain. Nor does the Government either Ecclefiaftical or Civil take any Cognizance how they are us'd. They that have put em to all manner of Drudgery, as they pleafe themfelves, being not only Mafters of their Chaftity, but of their Lives. Nor is it a difhonour in the Eaft for a Slave to ferve her Mafter as a Wife j but rather a great Honour and the beft Fortune flie can arrive at: for when tkey are advanc'd to their Mafters Bed they have an Apartiment feperate from the Reft of the Slaves! They are well Clad, allow'd Servants, and a Penfion ; and if they bring Childern, their Allowances are enkrg'd. For then they are no more lookt upon as Slaves, but as the Mothers of the Lawful Heir of the Family. The hir'd Wives are call'd Moutaa, from which fignifies a Concubine and alfo a Servant: of which they may take as many as they pleale, and as long as they pleafe for the price they agree upon. At which is the Metropolis of ferfta, thofe that are handfome and Young may be hir'd for Five and Thirty Pound a Year, befides Cloaths, Diet and Lodging. Which fort of Marriage is a contraa purely Civil. At the end of the Term, if both parties are agreed they may renew the Bargain â– ,and they are at Liberty to break off be fore the end of the Term, and to put away the hir'd Wife, but then they muft give the whole Sum conrain'd in the Con- traft. Yet cannot the Woman fo difmifs'd let out her felf again nor give her felf to another till Forty Days after her Difmifilon.' Which interval is call'd the D They who underftand the Ceremonial Law of Mofes, may eafily perceive that the Mahometans borrow'd this cuftom from the though new modell'd and alter'd after their own humour! And indeed the Law both of the one and the other agrees in the point of Marriage, and the Behaviour of Men toward Women. The Efpous'd Wives are call'd of which the metan Religion allows a Man to Marry Four. Neverthelefs they never Marry above one, to avoid the Expence ; and be- caufeof the diforders that Multiplicity of Lawful Wives creates m a Houfe. For every one will Command, and their mutual Jealoufie keeps the Houfe in perpetual Confufion. Therefore People of Quality Marry generally into Families equal in De- ttey czmotcontent themfelves with one Woman, which is a Misfortune that never fails to befall 'cm, they make + ulethrough the Black -Sea, and t CoJchis; 2 ufe of their Slaves^ By that means the Peace of the Farriily is never difquieted y for the Marry'd Wife is always Lady and Miftrefs. As to other things, whether contented or no, her Relations never take any notice. As for hir'd Wives, feldom any Body takes 'em, but People of mean Condition, or Stran gers, which they do that they may be rid of 'em when they pleafe. The loweft fort of all never make ufe of that Cu- ftom, as not being able to pay 'em their Wages. Neither do Perfonsof Quality 5 in regard they fcorn the Leavings of ano ther, or that another fliould make ufe of a Woman who has belong'd to them. But if by chance a Perfon of Quality falls in love with a Woman either publick, or not fit to be his Wife, he hires her for Ninety-Nine Years 5 and by that means he is fure to enjoy her as long as he lives, without Marriage. And they take this courle, elpecially if They are Marry'd to Women of Quality or Nobly defcended, becaufe their Relati ons would take Themfelves to be highly affronted fhould They bring into their Houles Women of mean Birth to be their Com panions. / ' . In Per ft a they ufually Marry by Proxy: becaufe the Women are never feen by the Men. Which Ceremony is perform'd after this manner. The Kindred of both Parties meet at the Houfe of the Party intended to be the Husband or Bridegroom. Thither they fend for a Churchman to make the Contrad. Or if the Parties are Perfons of high Qyality, then the who is the chief 'Pontiff'^ or the Sheikeliflam, who is the chief Civil Judge, and is invited for that purpofe. If they are Per- fons of mean Degree, they endeavour to get the who is the Lieutenant Civil: and if they be very poor People, they fend for a Molla, or Prieft of the Law. Prefently the Party Affianc'd in the Company of feveral Women repairs to a Cham ber not far from the place where the People are met, where the Door ftands half open, but the Tapeftry is let down that there is no Body to be feen. Then the Proxies of both Parties rife, and the Proxy for the Party Affiancd fetting himfelf againft the Door of the Chamber, and ftretching out his Hand, cries out aloud, I N.

Then he puts the fame Queftion to the other Proxy, makes the Contraft, fixes the Seal, and caufes the reft that are met to Seal it likewile 5 and gives the Contract to the Proxy of the Affianc'd Virgin. Which Contract is kept by the Woman for the Security of her Dowry* There is no difference between this, and the Ceremony of Marriages for time, when they hire Wives, only that the Proxies make their Promifes on other Terms.

For which the Bride returns him feveral Knick-Knacks, as Embroider'd Hand- kerchers, Toy lets. Needlework Night-Caps, and fuch kind of i nfles, ufually all made with her own Hands. Thethrough ike Black-Sea, and &amp;f Colchis. 2 The Wedding is kept at the Mans Houfe, affd Jafls Ten Days : upon the Tenth piy* by broad Daylight, they fend him home that which is call'd the 'Bride s which con fills in Furniture, Jewels, Moveables, Slaves and Eunuchs, accor ding to the Quality of the Bride, and all this upon Camels or other Beafts ot Carriage, the Mufick playing before 'cm. The Slaves and Eunuchs ride either upoii the Packs or elle on Horfe- back tand fometimes it happens that they borrOvy Houfhold- Stuflf and a Trains and fend ehipty Chefts; and all to itiake a flieW and dazle the World. At Night the Bride is conduced home j and if fhe be a Perfon of Quality fhe is carry'd in a Cagiavat, being a kind of Cradle of which a Caniel will carry two. If flie be a Perfon of meaii Condition, Hie is let upon a Horfe, or elfe goes a Foot: and then the Mufick marches full:; then the Servantswith every dnea Wax-Taper in their Hands, follow'd by the Women with lighted Candles in their Hands after the fame manner. The Bride her (elf is veil'd from Head to Foot; with another Veil over that, plaited like a Caflbck; made of Silk and Silver, or Cloth of Gold, or plain Silk, which reaches down to her wade. So that a very Lynx could never be able to difcover her fllape or Stature. If Hie be afoot, two Women lead her by each Arm; if on Horleback, an Eunuch leads the Horfc by the Bridle. About an Hour after Â£he has been at her Husbands Houfe, the Nuptial Feaft being over, the Matrons carry her into the Bridal Chamber, ilndoath her to a little Wafte-Coat, and a thin pair of Drawers next to it, and put her to Bed. Soon after the Bridegroom is conduced to the fame place either by Eunuchs or Old Women, the Lights being all taken away when he enters the Room. Thus the Man never fees his Wife till after he has Confurn^ mated the Marriage ; and many times he never does that,- till feveral Days after his Wife has been at home, the nice: Lady flying his Embraces and hiding her felf among the Women, or elfe unwilling to let her Husband meddle with her Which Coynefs frequently happens among Perfons of Quality, who look upoit it as a piece of Immodefty to beflow their lafl Fa vours fo foon. The Virgins of the Blood Royal more parti cularly put their Husbands to this trouble, lb that it requires whole Months to reclaim 'em, and to petfwade 'em that their Husbands are worthy their Embraces. To this purpofe they tell a! Story of a Daughter of Great*, who was Marry'd to one of his Great Generals, that flie was a lone time before file would condefeend fo much as to lookzSq. The 'TraDeb of Sir John Chardin Perfia, look upon her Husband Thereupon the Lord complain'd to the King, That his Majejly had given Tygrcfs Wife h that hedurji not come near ; run at him with a Dagger in her H At which jbds could not forbear Laughing, and ask'd him how many white Slaves he had in his Seraglio ?The General anfwer'd, about Five and Forty. Then faid the King, Lie I am jure that will be a means to your The Ge neral took the Kings advice. The Princefs enrag'd at this his manner of proceeding, ask'd him, if that were his Conjugal Faith that he had plighted to her, and feeing he continu'd his Courfe, notwithftanding all her fury, made her complaints to the King, telling him, That him againft her Husband, who tf^av To whom the King with an incens'd Countenance anfwer'd, That he had done it by his Order ; and at the fame time fent her away, with an exprefs Command to invite her Husband to come and lie With her. Which the Princels did accordingly, and was well latisfi'd. To the fame purpofe they relate another very pleafant Story ofoneofthe Concubines of Sephi, the laft King of that Name. She was a lovely Perfon, and for that reafon infinitely belov'd of the Prince, which had made her extreamly Proud, and to take upon her many times to talk over boldly to the King. One Day therefore Sephi, who was naturally Cruel, was fo incens'd againft her that he would have put her to Death; but his Anger not believing Death to be a fufficient Punifhment, he took from her all her Women, and her Eunuchs, caus'd all her Cloaths to be Burnt, and her Jewels to be Pounded in a Mortar, and the bitts of Stones to be flung into a Pond before her race; and to add to her Ignominy, caus'd her to be Mar ry d to a Paltry Negro, that was one of his Cooks: and lb the Unfortunate Lady was fent home to the Cooks Houfe with only one Chamber-Maid left her. But when her frightful Husband thought to have approach'd her, the Chamber-Maid as Lovely and Ma jeftick as her Miftrels, drawing a naked Dagger out of her Pocket, and throwing her felf before her Miftrefs, Dor a Negro, faid fhe, Do but touch Fimer, and I mil make a Thoufand Holesi Upon which the poor Cook flew for his Life; and the Story being told to the King, he wasfopleas'd with the adion, that he recolMed Jnmlelf, affwagd his Paflion, Marry d her to a Colonel, and lent her Cloaths and Furniture fuitable to her Condition. + Therethrough the Black Sea,, and 0/Colchis. 331 There happens in the Marriages of the meaner fort of Peo- pie, fomething that feeras to be quite the Contrary, For if the Man have oblig'd himfelf to make his Wife a Dowry that exceeds his Eftate,to obtain the confent of his Wife's Parents â€¢ he (huts his Houfe door when they bring her home, and cries that he will not give 1Â© great a Price for her. Then the Pa= rents of both Parties difpute the Matter between themfelves and the Friends of the Bride are oblig'd to abate fomething' for fear the Bridegroom fliould refufe her; for it would be the greatcft Diflionour in the World, as well for them, as for the Maid, to be carried back again. Now one would think this way of Marrying, without e= ver feeing the Parties face, fiiould produce very unfortunate Matches; but it does nor. Nay we may fay in General that rhe Matches are more happy in a Country,where the Men and Women never fee one another, then where the Women are fo frequently feen and courted. And the Reafon is plain; For they that fee not another Mans wife, lofe lefs fud=. denly the Affedion which they have, or ought to have, for their own. And yet we cannot fay the marry with* out altogether knowing whom neither. For the Mother or Kindred or other Peribns, upon whom they rely for the choice of a Wife, make fuch a frequent and lively Defcription of the Virgin, that they may fufficiently judge by their Re- port, whether the Original will pleafe, or whether fhe be a fit Match or no. Befides when they are Girls, tho the Greateft Lords Daughters, they are not fo clofe lockt up, till they come to be above Seven or Eight Years of Age. Till which time they appear up and down the Houfe, to the end they may be publickly feen and taken notice of; fo that fometimes it happens,that a Man may have feen the Maid,pro* pos d him for ia Wife, efpecially when fhe was little. The Mahometan Religion holds Divorce to be Lawful, however it be done, or whatever the Occafion may be. 'Tis fufficient that one of the Parties diflikes the other, and that they refolve to unmarry themfelves; for then, tho otherwile the moft prudent and civil People in the World, they prefent* ly divorce. Which Ad: of Separation is pafs'd, either before ajudgeor before a Church-man. is called Talaac, or a.'Billof Divorce ; which being granted, the Parties are ac Liberty to marry again where they pleafe themfelves. Upon the diffblution of the Marriage, the Man is oblig'd to return the Woman her Dowry ; if it be he that fues out the Divorce; A a a a butthe Travels of Sir John Chardin into mil a, but if it be the Woman that feeks the Separation, then fhe lofes her Portion. The Mahometans alfo hold for hw- ful, the Renewing, of Marriages diffolv'd, and that they may diflolve and renew and diffolve Three times; but if it hap. pen that after a Divorce the third time, the Man and the Wo. man defire to come together a fourth time, they cannot do k; but upon this ftrange Condition, that before the Woman marry another Husband,flie ftall dwell with him forty days, and then be divore'd from him. The ferfians, to fpeak in general, rarely make ufe of this exceflive Licenfe to unmarry one another. The Citizens and Tradesmen fometimes make their Advantages of it: But Perfons of Quality will rather choofe to dye, then repudiate their Wives,and you may as foon take away their Lives,as force 'em to confent to a Divorce, The poorer fort never ufe it,for they are too filly and clott.pated to unmarry one another ; befides that it would coft 'em too dear, in regard they muft re turn the Portion they had, upon the Repudiation^ Which however occafions a more crying piece of Injuftice to be com mitted among the viler fort. For they, when they would be rid of their Wives without returning their Pordons,mirufe the woman in that terrible and inhumane manner,that fhe is fore'd to fue for a Divorce, and facrifice all to her Liberty. Befides, the Courts of Judicature,rarely know the Differences that hap pen between Man and Wife, the mifcheivous Tricks that they play one another, and the Reafons that move 'em to feparate. The Place where the Women are fhut up is facred 5 efpeciÂ« ally among Perfons of Condition : And it is a Crime for any Perfon whatever, to be enquiring what pafles within thofe Walls. The Husband has there an abfolute Authority, withÂ« out being oblig'd to give any accompt of his Actions. And 'tis faid, that there are moft bloody doings in thofe places fometimes, and that Poyfon difpatches a World of People, which are thought to dye a natural Death. The 12. I difmifs'd the Officer of the of who concluded me to Irrivan. I made him a prefent of aÂ» bout Six Guines; and gave him a Letter for Father (Raphael of 'Parma, wherein I let him know how diligently the Offi 5 cers had ferv'd me , and defir'd him to give the Prince an Account of it, and to return him my humble Thanks. For it is the cuftome to give fuch Letters of Commendation to thofe fort of Officers. Without which fbould they return to their Mafters, it would be a fault, for which they would not fail to be punifh'd. The( through the Black-Sea, and th e/CoIchis. 553 The 13.I ftay'd at the Palace fome part of the day, and din'd with the Governor. The 14 and 15. I dind there likewife. He was extreamly civil to me, to the end I fhould let him have what he had a mind to at a cheap Rate. For 'cis not to be imagin 'd, how thefePerfian Lords will debafe themfelves, when they are dealing for their own Intereft with People over whom they have no Authority. They are not afham'd to beg for what they have a defire to. They flatter, they praife, they promife, there is nothing fo mean, which they will not make ufe of to attain their Ends ; and when they have once attain'd em, they have done with thofe People. Which Inequality of Temper, they that have bufinefs in 'Per- fiafhall have every day cccafion to make Tryal of. The 16. I went to vific the Patriarch of whole name w&amp;s 'james, an Ancient Man, all over hairy, and venera. ble for his Prefence and Afped, but of a fickle and inconftant Difpofition, and whofe Behaviour juftify'd the Accufations which his Nation laid upon him, which were, that he wanted Tudgmentjbut was very Ambitious. He lodgd at the Epilog pal Manfion; and was confin'd within the Walls of the C&gt; tv. A misfortune that for fome Pranks which he had play d he had drawn upon himfelf. And as for that he then lay under, the occafion was this, of which he made me a long Rehearlal The Armenian Clergy is very much addided to Symony, as well as that of the Eaftern Setts. But that which they lell moft dear is the holy Oyl, which they call Myrone. The molt part of the Eaftern Chriftians believe it to be a Ball om, and a Remedy that phyfically Cures all the Diftempers of the Soul Nay there are whole Societies ot Chriftians who e- lieve, that the Grace of Regeneration, and Remiffion ot Sins, is imparted by the ufe of this Oyl : Saying, that in Baptifm for Example, 'tis the Oyl and not the Water, which is the Matter prefcribd. And the Clergy keep the People in this pernicious Error, becaufeof the Advantages w 1C ^ ^ by it, felling at a dear rate the Undion of this Oyl Whicht ^ Patriarch has the only right to Confecrate and he fells it to the Bifhops and Priefts. Now about twelve Years fince t &lt;Perftan Patriarch began to projett how he might PJ even JrLian Ecclefiafticks over all the Eaft ^ p ^f ^ themfelves with this Holy Oyl from any other Perfon buc himfelf. Thofe of Turky bought it ot an Patriarch refiding at JeruJalm &gt; and w o is t ethe Travel* of Sir John Chardin Perfia, over all the Armenian Chriftians within the Empire. James pretended, that it was not lawful for the of Turky, to go for Holy Oyl to Jerufalem, but at a time when the War between the Turk and the 'Per/tan, hinder'd 'em from coming to his Seej and he was of opinion for a fum of Money, well expended at the Ottoman Court, he might obtain an Order from the fW, by venue of which the Ecclefiaftical of that Empire fliould be oblig'd to fetch their Holy Oyl from (Perfta, as formerly. But firft he muft have the confent of the (Perjlan King to undertake an Affair of that Importance, which James eafily obtain'd, and afterwards went to the 'Port-, where after he had Ipent a great deal of Money and Time, at length he obtain'd his Hearts defire. All this while the Armenian Patriarch of a more Politic Prelate, and one better skill'd in the Affairs of Turky, never ftirr'd from his Seat, while the other was negotiating at the Grand Signiors Court. He let him expend and exhauft himfelf, and onely watch't for J Return into But then it was no hard matter for him, to demonftrate to the Vivan the Grand Signiors Intereft in that Affair, and the Damage which his Highnefs did himfelf, in obliging the Arme nians under his Subjeftion to fetch their Holy Oyl from becaufe of the great Revenue which it produe'd. Where upon the Divan cancell'd the Order which they had given the Perfian Patriarch; and left the whole Bufinefs as it was be* fore. However James to his own and the misfortune of his Nation, went on obftinately againft his own Intereft, he got a ReÂ»hearing, believing that his large Prefents and his ImportuÂ® nicy would at length gain him his Caufe. I cannot tell eer- tainly, how much the Money was that he fpent in this idle Concern- but they fay it amounted to no lefs than threefcore thoufand Guines. All that I know is this, that he owes fourty thoufand pound which he took up at Conjlantinople^ad fpent upon this fame in comparable Projeft. He borrow'd firft of the as long as his Credit would laft, and when they would lend him no more, then he borrow'd of the At length he became an abfblute Bankrupt, and at the fame time he was fore'dto quit his defign and retire out of where there is nothing to be done by men that have no money in their Pockets. The Patriarch however thought he could oblige the Armenians of Terfia, that go and come to Conflantinople, to paypay what he ow'd the Turks. Which as he imporcim'd 'em to do, fo he obtain'd in part. For they paid feveral confide^ rable Sums, in hopes to free their Patriarch out of his Trou bles ; whom they thought not to be fo deeply engag'd as they found him to be. But finding ftill that after they had paid one Debt, larger Sums difcover'd themfelves, and call'd for Satisfa&amp;ion, they refus'd to disburfe any more Money, noc- withftanding all the fair and foul Means he could ufe. James therefore footh'd up his Turkifh Creditors, and told 'em that if they would fend along with him two Truftees to re- ceive their Money in Armenia, he would pay em there : and fo they let him go upon his Word. But when he came home, he found both the 'Perjians and the equally offended with him for his extravagant Expences, and the FoU ly of his Defign ; So that not a man would part with any Money , nor would they fuffer him to touch the Patriarchal Treafure : Infomuch that the two Truftees for the Cuftomer of Conftantinople, that came to receive the payment of Six Thouland Guineys, which he ow'd their Mafter, were forc'd to return, finding the Patriarch to be utterly infol- vent. The Cuftomer perceiving his Debt to be fo defperate, ob tain d an Order from the G^and to the Governor of Â£r- Zerum,to give his People,that return'd into ferfia^W the AffiÂ« ftaace he could, to enable em to recover the Debt. To that end the Governor gave 'em Letters of Recommendation for the Can of EriVan. But thofe Letters provd of little or no ef- fed ; and becaufe the Length of Journeys is very tedious in Afia,and for that the diftance of one Place to another hapÂ» pens to be a great delay of Bufinefs, the Turkifh fruflees ftay'd a year at Erhean without doing any good. At length they receiv'd new Letters of Recommendation from the Grand Ftzjr, the Kaimacan of Coeisl'antimjele and the Safra of Erzerum for the Governor of E which were fo full and fo importunate, that the Governor was forcd to beftir him- felf. He fent fot the Patriarch, and told him he muft pay the fix thoufand Guinneys. The Patriarch, who Was really infolvent, demonftrated his Inability to the Governor as clears ly as could be done i' th world, and befought him very earneftly to obtain leave of him from the Court^ that he mighc raift the Sumra upon the Churches of Media ana Geor- gia; and to oblige the Governor to intercede for it, gave him feveral confiderable Prefents. So that the Governor at length B b b b content-The Travels of Sir John Chardin into Perfia, confenting, he tjpt only petition'd for Leave,buthad it granted; and when it came, James fent about his Deputies to put it in Execution. But both the Clergy and Seculars of thofe Provin- ces,who are really very Poor,and continually vex'd with Impo. fitions, Levies of Money,Taxes and Impofts, refus'd to pay the Patriarch. Belides, when the Governors and were inform'd of what the Patriarch had done, they forbid the ChriHians under their fubjeftion to part with a Farthing; faying withal, that the if Governor of were fo liberal to the Patriarch, he might make his Levies upon the Churches that belong to his own Government. Thereupon there was a necefficy for him, to write back to the Court. But the Governor of Armenia, fearing leaft the Patriarch fliould abfent himfelf, or that he would not go to the Court, order'd him to keep at Erivan, and not to ftir thence without leave. And this was that Prelate's Condition, when I went to vifit him. At what time he feem'd to be very impatient in Expedation of the Refblutions of the Court. The 21. Forty feven Minutes after Sun-rift and the firffc day of the Month Zilbage, which is the Twelfth Month of the Year among the SMahumetans, the Great Guns of the Fortrels were thrice Difcharg'd, and the Garrifon gave three Vollies to give Notice that it was NewÂ«Years Day. And this they always do at the very Moment that the Sun enters in whether it be Day or Night. The Aftrologers, who make their Obfervations very exadly with their give the Signal, and then it is that all the Guns go off, as I have already faid. This Feftival lafts three days; and is the moft Solemn one that is celebrated in ferfta We fliall tell yee in a* nother place, after what manner it is Solemniz'd. The 21. in the Afternoon I went to the Governor to willi him a happy New-Year ; and prefented him at the fame time with a Hafted Dagger, and a Sheath of Ivory inlay'd with Gold. Which the Governor very much admir d,and was very well pleas'd. For it is the Cuftom in fer/w, now become a Law,never to come into the Prefence of a GreatPerfon emptyÂ» handed during this Feftival. The Governor on the other fide made me fit down by him, and gave me a Collation of dry'd and green Fruits, and Excellent Wines of and Shiras. The General of the Mint, and the King's whom we have already fpoken, were both with him at the fame time. So that I ftaid two hours difcourfing of Sundry things. The 25. he lent for me, and after ieveral Difcourles at Rovers,through tbe Black-Sea, and the 0/Colchis. Rovers, he told me, He was very much troubl'd for me that I was come in Verfu at fuch an unlucky Seafon, when there was fo little Trade for Jewels, for that the King had little or no efteem for 'em,and therefore bought very few. That I was not now to look upon my Condition, as if King were alive, for thofe days were gone; and that I (hould find it a hard matter at Court to put off the worth of Three Thoufand Pound. Then going on, he told me farther, That he did not fpeak this to difcourage me, but that I might betimes confider what I had to do, and lofe no opportunity of felling what I had brought: That he had a defign to lay out to the value of Two Thoufand Five Hundred Pounds,if I would let him have good Bargains. Prefently I found what the Governor aim'd at by his Difcourfe, and that his Advice tho very good and true,proceeded rather from Intereft } thcn that he was really conÂ» cern'd for my Benefit. However I return'd him Thanks, and told him, I heard of the Great Change of Humor at Court, but yet for all that I did not queftion but to fell, expecting from his Majefty s Juftice that he would confider-, that I had not made fuch a tedious Voyage, nor brought fo many Jew els, but by the Orders of the Deceafed King his Father. Ne* verchelefsjchat I was refolv'd to fell as much as I could without Lofs, and that I was fo much beholding to him for his Favors and his particular Care of me, that I would fell Cheaper to him then to another Perfon. Thereupon the Governor promis'd me, that I fliould have the favour of his Sons, and be affifted by all the Credit which they had at Court; to which purpofe he would give me moft Effectual and Earneft Recommendations, and at length orÂ« der d me to bring all that he had fet apart. He tola me he would make his firft Purchafes of little Jewels and of fmall value, to the end he might fee, whether I would be as good as my word. Which Method of his did no way pleafe me, and therefore I propounded to him to take all at a Lump, and ne ver to make two Bargains, a (Turing him that he would find it his cheapeft way. After that I defird him to begin with the Great Pieces; but he refus'd to accept either of my Propo- fals; he knew how to manage me fo dextroufly, that he per- fwaded me that his Intentions were real, and that he would try by thole things wherein he had moft Judgment, whether I fold him dear or no. So then we agreed upon a Price for Forty Watches of feveral Fafliions : All which I fold him at a low rate 3 co purchafe his good Opinion 3 aird to the end I might fell'the Travels of Sir John Chardin into Perfia, fell him more of my Commodities. Preftntly he fenc me to his Cafhier to receive my Money j which while we were telling, in he came with a great Chryftal Looking glafs fee in Gold, which he had fee afide from among thofe other that I had fhewn him, and telling me, the teas ask'd me the Price of the Glafs; and I let him have it for Five Hundred Crowns, which he paid me with the reft of my Mo- ney. For the 'Perfians are ftrangly infatuated with Judicial Aftrology,and attribute to the Influences of the Stars all their good and bad Succefs. And when two Stars which they call Benign , are in Conjundion, that they call the lucky hour. The 27. The Governor did me the Honour to give me a vifit. Tho I had rather he had let his vilit alone; for it coft me a Gold=Box of Eight Guineys. Which I prefented to him to gratifie the Cuftom of the Country ; which is, to reÂ» pay the vifits of great Perfonages with a Prefent. The Go= vernor ftaid a quarter of an hour in my Chamber ; after which he went and made a ftop where the People that be long d to the Cuflomer of Conjlantinop lay, which was very near to my Apartment. Then he went and vifited a Merchant,and an Armenian Merchant, that lodg'd in the fame Inn, who made him every one a Prefent, but of things of little value. The People that belong'd to the Cuftomer of Confiantinople gave him two Ducats, the Turkift Merchant a little bag of Coffee, worth an Angel, and the pre* fented him with two Ells of Damask. For the Governor comes forth out of the Caftle into the City conftantly twice a Week, that is, Frydays and Saturdays ; he goes publickly to the Mofqnee to fay his Prayers ; he vifits every Quarter of the City, and gives filch Orders as he finds to be recjuifite. So that there can be nothing better contriv'd then his Method of Government. If he ftop before any Houfe they never make him any Prefent, unlefs they pleafe themfelves. But if he go into the Houfe, Cuftom obliges em to prefent him. And there is an Officer, call'd the fie* cetVer ofVrefents, who keeps an account of all that is prefent- ed him, let it be of never lb mean a value. The 29. and 30. Idin'd with the Governor, and fold him as many ordinary Jewels as came to about Five Hundred ounds. We drove our Bargains every price by it felf, an w en we were come to a Price he paid me in ready oney. And moft afluredly he got by that way of dealing; for| through the B lack-Sea, for by chat means I fold him at a much cheaper rate. The fame day a little after I was return'd to my Lodging the Princefs his Wife fent for me,to make her a price of lome cer tain Jewels which fhe had made choice of. But jufl as I was ready to take Horf^the General of the Mint, and the Kings Slave came to give me a vifit, fo that I could not go to the Caftle that day : neither would I go the three next days as being the three laft of the Paffion Week ; but the Fourth of April I went. So foon as I came,the PrinceflTe's Steward, who was an old Eunuch, told me,That the Princefs was extreamly angry that I had ftay'd fo long, and that if one of the Coun try fhould have ferv'd her fo, (he would have made him feel two hundred Drubs upon the Soles of his Feet. At which 1 laught, and askd the Eunuch, if his Lady were wont to pronounce Sentences. Sir, faid he, fhe is one of the Haugb- tieft Ladies in the Woild ; and for the leaft fault exafts a moft fevere punifhment. If it be a man that has offended her, {he fends her Eunuchs to feize him, who bind him hand and foot, and put him in a Sack, carry him into the into her prefence, and punifh him according to her Com* mands, without letting him out of the Sack, or fuffering him to know where he is. But I never yet knew that the Ladies ever infiided fuch fort of punifliments. And there fore I defir'd the Eunuch, to let the Princefs know the Reafon that had kept me at home, and that I was always ready to obey her Commands. I tarry'd above four hours at the en trance into the Seraglio, while the went and came back. At length a Bargain was made between us for fo maÂ« ny Jewels as amounted to Four Hundred Pounds, for which [ received my Money the next Morning. The I went to the Governor, and defir'd him to give me leave to depart 5 for that I was in haft to be at Court. He pro' mis'd to difpatch me after Dinner: and I waited on him again j at his time appointed. At what time, he ask'd me with a fmiling Countenance what was the value of the Gold Box 1 had given him, when he came to vifit me. 1 knew not what his defign was, and therefore in my anfwer I valued it at Ten Pounds. Pray then Sir, faid he, oblige me to take it again and give me the value of it in Keys, in Springs and Strings for Wat* ehes. I was not a little furpriz'd at his Propofal, which did not leem to be very civil for a Perfon of hisQuality. However I an* fwcr'd him,that! was ready to do what he pleas'd;&amp; added that I had feveral Watchmakers Tools, that I had brought for the C c c c Kings340 the Travels of Sir John Char din in to Perfia, KioPS Ar ificers, which 1 would fend him, it ic were his Piea- fureT He took me at my word, affuring me that I fhould do him a very great kindnels. For this fame Grandee is a great Lover oi Mechanicks, and knows how to mend a Watch that does not go true. Afterwards he caus d all that remain'd in his hands of mine to be delivered me back: and I thought certainly that he would have made an entire Bargain ; but to my great AftoniQiment he reftor'd me all. Then I per. ceiv'd I had been his Cully, and that he had only drtll'd me on in hopes of felling him a great Purchafe, to let him have what he chiefly defir'd at a cheaper race. However icon- ceal'd my difguft, and my diffatisfadion to be fo ferv'd ; and return'd him a choufand Thanks, with a Countenance as gay, as if I had had my hearts defire. Afterwards I befought him to give me his Letters of Recommendation to his Son ; which he promis'dme to do, and invited me to go along wiih him into the Country, whither he went the next morning. But I excus'd my felf, returning him Thanks in the beft Lan guage I could. I alfo rcquefted him to give me the Agree* ment with Mr. J^arias, who was to accompany me to I will fo, anfwer'd his Lordfliip, and I will enjoyn him to be your JMehemandar, or Guide , meaning that honed Armenian already mention'd. This done, I again return'd him my humble Thanks for all his Favors ; and after I had told him that I would not fail to extol his KindnelTes at Court, I took my leave. I thought it not proper to put him in mind of feveral other Promifes that he had made me ; as being alfur'd they would produce little , for that according to the Cuftom of the Country he had made em, not with an intention to be as good as his word, but onely to make me the more ready to do what he defir d. The 5.. the Governor went to the Camp, which he had caus'd to be fet up about a League from the City, in a fpaciÂ» ous and lovely Meadow, all cover'd with flowers during the fair Seafon. The two Rivers that encompafs , and run along with a winding Courfe and gentle Stream, make leveral little Iflands in that Place. So that the Governors Quarter, that of the Princefs his Wife, and thole of the moft confiderable Perfonsthat accompani'd him, were allfeparated; while every one had their particular Ifland ; which were joyn'd together by certain little Bridges, that were laid on or tak n away,as occafion requir'd. The Governor's Tents were very Magnificent; and indeed there were in a little Ground allthrough the Black-Sea ^ and th Colehis. 541 all the Conveniencies of a Palace even to the very Baches and Stoves, His Family confided of about Five Hundred Menj without reckoning the Women and And it is the Cuftom of the Grandees of this Kingdom to folace them* felves in this manner in the Country in the Spring Time; There they divertize themfelves in Hunting, Fifliing, Walk ing and employ themfelves in feveral other Exercifes, both a Foot and on Horfe-back- There they fuck in the freQi Air, and enjoy that Coolnefs which they fo much delight in. This is the Refrediment and Recreation of their Lives; fo that if they have no bufmefs in the City which requites their Prefence there, they continue thus taking their pleafure all the Summer long,' in the moft delicious parts of the Neigbouring Moun^ taines. This they call lelac : or a Country Excurfion. The 6. The Prince's Treafurer gave me a Dinner.and the Kinos Lieutenant of the Fortrefs was at it. He is a Native of Dar-EJtaan. Which is a Mountainous Country to the NortbEaft of the Cafpian Sea, and bordering upon Mu/coVte. So that 1 took great delight to hear him repeat feveral parti* culars of the Cuftomes and Manners of his Country. The King of ferfta is acknowledg'd there as Soveraign Lord ; but he is not abiolute Mafter of it: nor are the People that inha bit it always fubjedl to his Commands. And the Court winks at their Difobediences ; it being a difficult thing to re duce em by reafon of the Roughnefs and Height of the Mountaines. They are a Savage fort of People, and the moft barbarous of all the Eaft : and I take em to be fome Remainders of the Mians. The fame Evening that Gen- tlemin lent me a Prefent of FruitjWine, and Mutton. The 7.The Treafurer fenc memucK fuch another Preleat 5 as the Governor had fent me the day before: and I repay d em in fmall Returnes for the Favors I had receiv'd from Both. They had been very civil to me at Eriyan not fo much as ottering to take thofe fees, which men are obligd to pay in Terfta to the Officers of Governors, for all the Money receiv d out ot their Treafuries 5 for that their Mafter had forbid em to deÂ» rrand any thing of me. And therefore they did me thole Kindnefles to oblige me to be the more free of my own ac cord; well knowing I was not fo ignorant of the Cuitomes ot the Country, but that I knew that it was not any motion ot Generofity, that made em fo courteous to Strangers. In the Afternoon I went i;o the Camp, to take leave ot the Governor; who fhew'd me a thoufand Civilities; and at myThe Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, departure gave me two Letters of Recommendation to his two Eldeft Sons, who are the Kings onely Favourites. They were both much to the fame Effect. And this is the Tranfla* tion of that which was written to the Eldeft.

The Patriarch was over-joy'd at the News, and made a Prefent to him that brought it; but it difpleas'd all the honeft People in the City, who were vex'd to the Souls, to fee the Prelate fo infenfible of the Violence they were going to offer to thoufands of Poor Chriftians, to pay for the Expences of his irregular Ambition, The 8. an hour before day, I parted from and tra- vell'd four Leagues over the little Hills, and through Valleys, the Country which I crofs'd being full of Villages. In one of which that was a very fair and large one I lodg'd, call'd by the name of Dai^vin. The p. we travell'd five Leagues through a Country that was very level and fertile. That which they call the Moun tain of Noah, lying upon the Right Hand. We d)reded our Courfe South'Weft, and lay at a Village call'd K^mntr. The i o. we continu'd the fame Road, and travell'd eight Leagues. Upon the left hand, after we got half the way, we left a great Town call'd Sederec. Which is as it were the Ca pital of the Province of Arme call'd The Sultan of which Province refides in that Town. That Night we had but a very bad Lodging in an old ruin'd Inn, near to a Village call'd Nouratchin- Thethrough the Black-Sea, and o/Colchis. 545 The 11* We travell'd four Leagues upon the fame Road, and through a very fair Country; but not fo level,nor fmooth, as being ftony, and full of little Hills. We alfo ferry'd over a River call'd tiarpafony , that waters all the Neighbouring Lands. It feparates the Government of that part of of which EriVan is the Capital, from that other part of which Nacchivan is the Metropolis. The n.we arriv'd at Nacchhan, after We had travell'd five Leagues over Plaines very level and Fertile. Nftcch 'mn is a great City, or rather a vail heap of Ruins, which are repair'd and repeopl'd by degrees. The heart of the City is at prefent rebuilt and inhabited ; having very large Bazars, which area fort of long Galleries, or Streets that are cover'd, full of Shops on both fides; where they fell all Sorts of Merchandizes and Provifions. There are in it five Inns or Carayanferays, Baths, Market Places, large Publick Houfes, where they fell Tobacco and Coffee ; and two Thoufand Houfes or thereabouts. The ferfian Hiftories affure us, that formerly it contain'd above Forty Thoufand. They alfo tell us, that before the Arabians conquer'd this Country,there were in it five Cities which had been built by 'Behrori'-Tcbouhin King ofPerfia. Without the City are to be feen the Ruins of a great Caftle, and feveral Forts which caus'd to be deftroy'd, toward the end of the laft Age, not finding himÂ» felt firong enough to keep 'em : All which he caus'd to be ruin'd after he had taken NacchiaVan from the Turks 5 and after he had ruin'd and difpeopl d the City. Which he did to prevent the Twks from Fortifying themfelves in that Place, and furnidling themfelves with Provifions. Moft certain ly the City is an Objeft of Pity, confidering in what a Condi tion it now lies. . The Hiftories of Verfta would have us believe, that it was one of the Greateft and Faireft Cities of all as has been already Hud. But that Hiftory, now kept in the Mona- ftery of the Three Churches, and which is chiefly fpokn of, da- clares that this City was the ancient Jrdajhhad, call d Art ax ate, or Jruxafate by the Greek Hiftorians. Other Armenian Au- thors make Nacchivan to be much more Ancient and aflerc that Nod/? began to build it, and made it his Abode after the Deluge. And they make the Etymology of the Name to agree with the Antiquity of the Original: Affirming, that m the old Armenian Language Nacchinn fignifiesthe fc/f Habi tation. Vtolomy makes mention of a City in thefe Parts,Tbe Travels oÂ£ Sir John Chardin Perfia, which he calls Naxuane, which might have been the fame with Nacchifan. 1 believe that , or , was leated very near it, Fox Tacitus obferves, that ran very near that (pity ; and we find it not to be above feven Leagues from Nacchiyan.

But at length they return'd to their obedience under the Jrnunian Pa* triarch, and to their firrt Religion: and as for thofe that perfift in the ^mijhCeremonies, their Number daily decreafes, by reafonofthe Perfecution of the Patriarch, and the Govef nors of 'Macchirvan. Thofe poor people, having drawn up on their own heads,the Indignation and violent Ufage of thole Governors, for having endeavour'd to withdraw themfelves from their Jurifdi&amp;ion &amp; Dependance.

Which egu ation, that did very little good to thole villages, was t ic occanon of many Milchiefs that afterwards befell em; and vyill one day be the caufe of their Ruin. For the Go= vernorsthrough the Black-Sea, and of Colchis. vernors of NacchiVan provok'd at thefe proceedings, and the complaints that were made of 'em to have lay'd a thoufand heavy Impofitions, upon thofe poor People, fince the death of that good King ; and have made 'em pay three or four times the money which they fent to the Treafure Roy al. For which the opprefled people can have no remedy ; whether through the Remidnefs of the Government, or for that their own Party is low and out of Credit. The Treafurer of Media has done worfe, for he has fent to Court falfe extrads of the Regifters of that Province, by which it appears that thofe villages were to pay fourteen hundred pounds yearly, which is juft as much again as what they pre tend to have always paid. Every time they carry their Im- pofition of Seven Hundred Pounds into the Treafury, the Officers give 'em a Receipt, wherein they put that it is upon Account of what they ought to pay, by which they keep a Door open for Arbitrary Impofitions, and Branglings to ruin em when they pleafe themfelves. The Governor of Nacehi&lt;van was not in Town when I arriv'd there. But this Son that was Deputy, had foon notice of my arrival. So that he invited me to Dinner, and defit'd me to fliew him fome Watches and fome Jewels. But I was no way fatisfi'd with his manner of dealing with me. For after he had been civil to me, and had giv n me a dinner, he left me with his officers who forcd me in a manner, to let him have that For fourty pounds, for which I refus'd fifty at Erhan. And without queftion they had us'd me more unciÂ» villy, but for the King's Pattent and Pafs port which I had aÂ» bout me. And indeed thofe Thorow-fairs are a fort of Places for the skinning of ftrangers,who are reputed to be rich.They muft alway there pay Paflage^money. The 13. We departed from and travell'd feven Leagues: At the end of the firft League pafling a River over a yery broad Bridge, to which the People of the Country give no other name then that of the River of CounÂ» try which we pafs'd is dry and Stony, where was nothing to be feen but little Hills of Stones. We lay upon the Banks of the River Jraxes^hlch. the Orientals call and We pafs ic at Efqui-julfa, or Julfa the old, a ruin'd City, which fome Authors beleive to be that City which the Ancients call'd Jriammene. They call'd it Old to diftinguifli it from Julfa that is builc over againft J/paban. Nor is it without reafon fo caird,as being totally ruin'd and demolilhed. There is no* E e e e thing548 ' The Travels of Sir John Char din into Perfia, thing farther to be known of it, except the Grandeur, which it once enjoy'd. It was feated upon the deicent of a Moun= tain, by the fide of a River, that ran dole by it. The AveÂ» nues to it,which are naturally very difficult of Accej5,were de fended by feveral Forts. It contain'd four thoufand Houfes, as the Armenians report ; but if we judge by its Rutnes, it ne= ver could contain half the number. At prefent there are no=. thing but Holes andCavernSjmade in the Mountains,fitter for Beafts then Men. I do not believe there is in the world a more barren or hideous Place, then that of Old Julfa, where there is neither Tree nor Grafs to be feen. True it is, that in the Neighbourhood there are fome Places more happy and fer tile ; yet on the other fide it is as true, that never was any City feated in a Situation more dry and ftony. But the Fi gure of it fomewhat recompens'd the Situation, refembling a long Amphitheater. At prefent there are not above thirty Families in it, which are all A Abas the Great was the Prince that ruin'd 'julfa , and all that Art had contributed to its Fortification. Which he did for the fame reafon that he ruin'd and other Places, of Amenta, to hinder the T Armies from Provifions. For he being a prudent and Politick Captain, finding his Forces inferior to thofe of his Enemies; and iludious how to prevent their return every year into &lt; Perfia ) their winning and pre- ferving their Conquefts, refolv'd to make a Defart of all the Country between Er^erum 8c Tauris, upon the line of Erivan and Nacchivan-, which was the road which the ufually obferv'd, and where they fortifi'd themfelves, becaufe they found provifions fufficient for the fupport of their Armies. To that purpofe therefore he tranfplanted all the Inhabitants and Cattel, ruin d all the Houfes and Buildings; fird all the Country, burnt up all the Turf and the Trees, poyfon'd the very Springs,as the Hiftory relates ; and they who have read the Story well know, that it had an efleit anfwerable to his wiflies. But to return to our lifts ; Jraxes is that famous River that leparates Ammo. from Media. It takes its Rife from the Mountain, where they affirm that Ark refted, and per* haps it may derive its name from that Mountain. From thence it empties its felf into the Cafpian This River is very Large and very Rapid. In it's Courfe it is augmented by feveral leflerftreams that have no name, asalfo by feveral Torrents. Bridges have been built over it feveral times abovethrough the Bkck-Se^ and Colchis. Julfa; bus though they made em never fb ftrong and maffie 3 as appears by the Arehes which are yet indre, they were not able to withftand the force of the River; It becomes fo furious when fvceU'd by theThaws of the Snow that fails down melted from the neighbouring Mountains, that nft Damms or other Fortifications can withftand it. And in truth the very Koile of the Waters, and the Rapidnefs J&amp;f it's Courfe, aftonifli both the Ears and Eyes of all that come near k. We ferri'd over ic in a large Boat ; made to carry twenty HoiTe and thirty Perfons at a time. But I would not fuffer any to go along with me at the Fame time, but my own People and my own Baggage. It had four men to manage it. They row'd up about three hundred paces along the flioar a this fide, then let the Barque drive us back with the ftream; and fo by the help of a long and ftrong Rudder guided the Boat to the other fide. The current cany'd it with an unfpeakable Impetuoficy, fo that we ran five hundred Paces in an inftanc. And thus it is that the Ferrymen crofs the River They allow therw- felves two hours to go and come ; by reafon of the time they muft fpend in pulling up againft the ftream. But in the Winter when the Waters are low, you may pals it upon the Camels Backs: the Ford being half a mile from Jul fa, in a part where the Channel being very broad, the current is much more gentle. We have laid that Jraxes leparates from This Country that formerly rul'd all JJta, with Imperial Do minion,at prelent makes but one part of a Province of ^erfta which the Terftans call J^erheyan, However it is one of rhe largeft in the Verftan Empire.

Ajfyria is a pare of the upper The ferftans a (firm,that this Place was call'd J^er-heyan , that is, the Country of Fire-, by reafon of the famous Temple of Fire which was there erected, where was kept their Fire , which the Fircmrfhippers, held to be a God; and becaufe the chief Pontiff of that Religion refided there. The who are all that are left of the Fire 'tPorfhippers } (hcw this place aboutThe T ravels o f Sir John Chardin into P erfia. abouc two days journey diftant from Shamakt. They aflure us for a certain truth,that the facrcd Fire is ftill there ; that ic refembles a Mineral and fubterraneall Fire ; and that they who repair thither out of Devotion fee it in the form of a Flame. Nay they add one particular more, which is a fort of pleafant ftory, that if you make a hole in the ground, and fet a pot over it, that lame fire will caufe ic to leeth, and boyles all that is in the Pot.

Now 'tis very probable, that this Jfhur was fo call'd from his retiring thither, or from the wor* fhip of Fire j or from Chaldea, which was then call'd the Coun try of Fire ; as appears C. 11. of and in all the ancienc Auchors; who unanimoufly agree chat was call'd che Country of Mr, or che Country o And Ptolomy makes men tion of a Cicy in chat Country which is call'd Urcoa, chat is co fay che place of Fire : ga, wich a long or a double being a Perftan word, chac fignifies a Place, or Part Buc che Ancienc Names have been fo corrupced by che negligence or ignorance of T ranferibers, or by the differences of Language and Pronunciation of Auchors and Tranflacors, that when we come to compare theAncients with the modern Name,we muft not reject every ching chac has noc an encire Refemblance.

' The 1 6. we travelled four Leagues, turning always among the Mountains, that come very clofe one to another in feveral parts, but never joyn. By ten of the Clock in the morning we arm d at Sophian : a little Village feated in a Plain, tuli ot Rivulets and Gardens; the Soyl of which is fertile to a won- der. Some Authors believe it to be the Ancient of dia. Others hold, that it was call'd from the Sopht's, who fettled there, when Ifmael the Firft left and re- mov'd his Court to Tauris. That Evening, Mr. J^arias, the honeft Armenian, alrea dy mention'd, went before with my Pafports and Letters of Recommendation from the Governors of and I ordered him to find out the Toll gatherer of Tauris, and to defire him in my Name, to give order that I might pafs with my Retinue : and the next day I found he had dilcharg'd his Truft, and that care had been taken to leave fuch orders at the Gates as I defir'd. That day being the Seventeenth, we arriv'd at aftet we had travell'd fix.Leagues upon the fame Road, as the pre ceding days, through fair and fertile Plains, where all the Lands were till'd, and where we had a Profpeft of a gieat number of Villages. It is fifty three Perfian Leagues, every one of which makes five thoufand Paces, between Irivan and Tauris, which may be eafily rid on Horfcback in Six days, but the Caravans take double the Time. The Camels feldom travel above four Leagues aday, and carry fix ot feven Hundred weight : the Horfes and Mules feldom carry above two Hundred and Twenty weight with a Man, and travel five or fix Leagues a day. The Figure in the Plate annex'd gives ye a very exafl De- fcription of Tauris. It is really and truly a very large and Potent City : as being the fecond both in Dignity, in Grandeur, in Riches, in Trade, and in number of Inhabi tants. It is feated at the end of a Plain, at the bottom of a Mountain, which our Modern Authors will have to be the Mountain Ormtes or 'Barantes, according to Tolybius, DtadoruSy and 'Ptolomey. The Figure of it is irregular and difficult to be ijara'd, as is apparent by the Plate; neither is it wall'd or for- tifi'd yonly a little River call'd Spingtcha run acrofs it. Which feme-through the Black-Sea, and t Colchis. 355 fomecimes makes dreadful havock,and carry's away the Houfes that are built by the fide of it. There is another that runs by theNort-hfide of the City,- Which from the Spring till Autumn is not much larger then the is at Varis in the Winter time. It is call'd Agi y or the Q(iver,hy reafon of the Torrents that having run through feveral Salt Marflies empty themfelves into it; which is the Reafon it breeds no Fifh. The Ci y is diftinguifli'd into Nine Wards or Quarters, and divided,as are almoft all the other Cities of into and Neamet-Olahi^hich are the names of two Fadions,which divided all &lt;Perfia in the Fifteenth Age, like the and the Gmbelltnes in Italy. It contains fifteen thoufand Houfes 3 and fifteen Thoufand Shops. For the Houfes in are not in the fame place with their Shops; which ftand for the moft part in long and large arched Streets forty or fifty Foot high. Which Streets atecalTd Bafary or the Market, and make the heart of the City ; the Houfes being in the out Parts; and have almoft all Gardens belonging to 'em. I did not fee ma= ny Palaces or Magnificent Houfes at But there are the faireft Bafars that are in any place of And it is a lovely fight to fee their vaft Extent.their Largenefs.their beau tiful Dmmo's, and the Arches over 'era ; the number of Peo ple that are there all the day long and the vaft quantities of Merchandize with which they are fill d. The faireft of all, and where they fell their Jewels and Wares of greateft value, is octangular, and very fpacious; being call d the or ioyal Market Place. It was built about the Year 8 5 o of the Herira by King H#Â»,who kept his Court at The.r other Publick Buildings are no lefs Sumptuous, nor lefs full ot People. There are reck'nd to be in the City three hundred Caravanferais; of which fome are Ipacious enough to lo ge three hundred People. Their Cabarets for Coffee Tobacco and ftrong Liquors, the Baths and Mofques are anfwerable to the beauty of the other Buildings. There ate in Tauris two hundred and fifty Mofqm of which the Principal are tmrk'd in the Copper Plate. I Hull not fay any thing of any one in particular ; becauie they are no otherwife builc then the fair in t ' pital City of the Kingdom,of which you will find in the fol lowing Volume both Defcnptions and Platforms.

The Mofque which they call the which lyes half in Ruins at prefent, was built three hundred and twenty years ago by Emir-Jhek'HaJfen. That which is mark'd with the Letter (0) in the Plate, is the faireft in all all the infide, and fome part of the outfide, being guilt with Gold. Ic was built in the year 878 of the by a Ferftan King czWdGeoncha, or King of the World. That with two Towers is a very fmall one, but both the Torn are of a Peculiar fort of Workman (hip ; and fhew the curioficy of the Artift. For they are built one over the other ; and the uppermoft is much higher and larger in the Diameter then that below, which ferves for a JSafis to the other. There are alfo three Hofpitals in the City, very neat and well in repair; however there is no body lodg'd within 'em, only they give Victuals to thole that come twice a day. Thefe Hofpitals at Tauris are c^ll'd Ach'tucon, that is, Place ViBuals. At the end of the City to the Weft, upon a little mountain ftands a Hermitage, a very neat piece of Work- manfhip, which they call Jyn or the of Haly. This Calijf, whom their Prophet made his Son-inTaw, was as the 'Perjians report, the moft lovely man that was ever feen ; fo that when they would fignifie any thing that is extreamly handfom they fay tis Halys This Hermitage ferves the Taurifians for a place of Devotion, and the way to it for a walk ofPleafure. Without the City of Tdar to the Eaft, appears a great Caftle almoft gon to decay, which they call It was buih above 400 .years ago by Grand to King K^an.The Story reports, that their King had five Grand Fifirs, becaufe he did not believe that one could fuf= fice to difpatch all the affairs of fo great a Kingdom. the Gr6at feeing that Caftle rtjin'd, and judging it advantage- oully feated as well to defend the City, as to command it, caus'd it to be repair d about fifty years fince, but bis Succeflbrs not being of his opinion, let it go to Ruin. There are alfb to be feen the Ruins of the Principal Edifices and Fortifications, which the built there, during the fe- veral times that they were Matters of it. So that thete are verythrough the Black- Sea, a o/ - Colchis. very few Rocks or PoyntS, of Mountains joyning to the City where nothing but the Ruins of Forts and Heaps of Rubbifli ate to be feen. Of which I carefully furvey'd a great Part; but I could not difcover any thing of Antiquity. There is nothing to be digg'd up but Bricks and Flint Stones, The onely Edi' fice that remains moft entire among the Buildings is a large Mofquce^he infide of which is inlay'd or rather'pari getted with tranfparent Marble; and all the Outfide variega ted in Mofaic work. But the account the Place de- fil'd, becaufe it was built by the TwrA^whofe Faith they abo minate. Among the heaps of Rubbifb, of which I have fpoken, without the City to the South, appear the Ruines of the Pal ice of the late Kings of And to the Eaft,thofe of the Caftle where they fay lodg'd; and where he laid up the Holy Cros for Security, and all thofe other facred Spoyles which he brought away The Tia^a of Tauris, is the moft fpacious Piazza that ever I faw in any City of the World, and far furpafles that of J/pa* han. The Turks have leveral times drawn up within it Thirty Thoufand Men in Battel. Toward the Evening this is fill'd with all the meaner fort of People, that repair thither for Sport and Paftime. Where fome are for Gaming, fomefor Tricks of Activity, fome for feeing Jack-Puddings and Mountebanks aft their Drolleries, fome for, Wreftling, others for Bull and Ram&gt;fighting, others for repeating Verfes, fome reciting Stories in Profe; and fome to fee Wolves dance. The People of Tauris take great delight to fee that fort of Sport; infomuch that they bring thofe Dancing Wolves a hundred Leagues an end, after they are well taught : And fuch as are beft inftrufted are fold for five hunder'd Crowns a piece : 8c many times alfo great Quarrels arife about thefe Wolves, which are not eafily appeas'd. Nor is this Piazza empty in the day time ; as being a Market for all forts of Provifions, and things of fmall Price. There is alfo aftotheif at Tauris, which appears in the Plate before the de- moliili d Caftle, cail'd the Caftle of Jctfer^acha. This was a Place for the Rendezvous, and exercife of the Souldiers beÂ» longing to the Garrifon â€¢ now it ferves for the Shambles ; where they kill and drefs all forts of large Meat, which is fold in all parts ofthe City. I have with great diligence endeavourd to underftand the' tiumber of the Inhabitants in Tarn , but could fie vet have a juft account; but I think I may truly reck'n it to amo&amp;nt to G ggS 55^the Travels of Sir John Chardin Pe rfia, 550 Thoufand Perfons, yet feveral Perfoas in che Cicy would make me believe there could not be lefs than Eleven hundred Thoufand. The number of Strangers alfo which arc there at all times is very great : for that they refort thither from all parts of Jfta. Nor do I know of any fort of Merchandize, of which there is not there a Magazine to be found. The City is full of Artiftsin Cotton, in Silk, and in Gold. The faireft Turbans in 'Perfia are there made. And I have heard feveral of the Principal Merchants of the City affirm, that there are above fix thoufand Bayles of Silk wrought out in Manufadure every year. The Trade of the City extends all over 'Perfta, and Turky ; into MufcoVy, to the In dies, and over the 'Black-Sea. The Air of Tauris is cold and dry ; very good and heal hy: nor can any man complain that it contributes to any bad dif- pofition of Humors. The Cold continues there a long time, in regard the City is expos'd to the North, for the Snow lies nine months in the year upon the tops of the Moun tains that lijrround it. The Wind blows almoft every day, Morning and Eveniftg. It alfo rains very often,unlefs it be in the Summer: nor is the Sky but feldom without Clouds any feafonof the Year. Itisleated in 38. deg. of Latitude, and 82 of Longit. It abounds with all things neceffary for huÂ» man Support; fothat a Man may fare there delicioufly and very cheap. The Cafpian Sea,which is not above forty Leagues diftant, affords 'em Fifli. And fome they alfo take in the River of Jgi before mention'd ; but that is only when the water is low. The ufual price of Bread is three pound for a penny, and of a pound of Flefli Three half pence. In the Summer there is great plenty of Venifon and water Fowl, But they kill very little Venifon or other wild Beads. 'There are alfo Eagles in the Mountains ; one which I have feen fold by the Country people for a groat. Perfons of Quality let fly the Sparrow-Hawk at the Eagle, which is a Flight full of Curiofity and much to be adipir'd. For theSparrow-Hawk foaring above the Eagle,ftoops of a hidden with that fwiftnefs, ftrikes her Pounces into his fides, and with her wings continually beating upon his head lends him in a fhort time to the ground : Yet fometimes it happens that both the Eagle and the SparroW'Hawk come both to the Earth together. In the fame manner the SparrowÂ«Hawks will many times Hop the flight* of hunted Stags, and render the Chacethrough the Black-Sea, and of Colchis. ^57 much more eafie to the Purfuers. But if this were fo ob&gt; fervable, that which I am going to fay is no lefs remarkable: which is, That they affur'd me, that in the patts adjoyn- ing to Taur'ts, there grow no lefs then threefcore fores of Grapes. No: far from the City in the neighbouring Parts, are to be feen great Quarries of white Marble, of which there is a lort that is tranfparent. The People of the Country af firm it to be the water of a Mineral Fountain,congeal'd and hardne'd by degrees : and indeed, there are not far from it two confiderable Mines, the one of Gold, and the other of Salt. But there has been no working in the Gold Mine for this long time, becaufe they always found,that the Profit neÂ« ver defray'd the Expences of the Labour. There are alio feveral mineral Waters : Of which, the moft frequented are thofe of Baringe, half a League from Tauris ; and thofe of Seid-Kent, another Village, which is fix Leagues from the City. Thefe Waters are fulphureous, but there are others that are cold ; others boyling hot. I do not know whether there be any City it? the World, concerning the Original and firft Name of which, there is a greater Difpute among Modern Authors. We fhall produce the Opinion of the moft celebrated : only it will not be amifs in the firft place to take notice that the call the City Tebris, and that when we call it T as the People of Eu rope generally do, it is only in compliance with the common Cuftom; and to the end, I may be the better underftoodi leixera, Olearius, and fome other Authors maintain, that Tauris is that City which Ttolomy, in the fifth Table of Jfta, calls Gabris, the G. being put in the ftead of T. an Alteration frequent in the Greek Language, as they affert. LemdaVf us, Jo'Vtus, and Jython, will have it to be that City which the fame Ancient Geographer calls Terya inftead of TeVra, by a cranfpofition of the Letters of the word. But being plac'd in Armenia, and it being certain that Tauris is feated in thofe two Names can never be appropriated to the fame City, So that without doubt, the Refemblance of the word deceiv'd thofe Authors. Tehris is a (Perfian word ; and was given to the City in the year 165. of the as wefliall declare more at large. And therefore, in regard it was fever al years ago fince 'Ptolnmy wrote, we muft believe that and Gabris are both very different from afferts it to be Tigranoama ; other Authors take it to be SomgTheTraveh of Sir John Chard in in to Perfia, Some there are of Opinion that it is the of fo fa mous in Scripture : the others believe it to be the City, which in the Bo&lt;ik of Efdras is cail'd Some place it in Jjjjria,zs ftoloiny And his Interpreter. Others in menia, as Niger Cedrems, Aython, and JoVtus. fenents places It in the Country of the farthtans. Calehondyhts removes it a little farther, that is to fay, into the Province, of which fajifklis Was formerly the Metropolis. In fliort,there is a ftrangc Confufion in the Variety of Opinions upon i:his Subject. But the moft rational in my Opinion, is that of Mol 'ets, who has tranflated and commented upon â€¢ of JtiMiAs, Ortelins,Gohtits, Ttixede and alÂ« moft all the modern Geographer^, that lauris is the Ancient and Celebrated Ethatand, fo frequently mention d in Holy Writ, and in the Ancient Sori^s of an Italian Author, if I am not deceiv'd, has fet forth a Treatife to prove it. However, give me leaVe to add this, that there are no Remainders to be feen at Tarns, either of the Magnificeht Palace of Echatana, where the Monarchs of kept their Courts in Summer, nor of that of ; Which was after* wards the Maufoleum for the Kings of of which phus fpeaks in his tenth Book -, and which he afllires us ftood entire in his time. If then thefe ftately and magnificent PaÂ» laces were ftanding not above fixteen Ages ago, in the Place where Taurh now ftands, the very Ruins themfelvcs are now not to found, for among all thofe that are to be feen with' in the Circuit of that City, there are none but what are of Earth, Brick, or Flint, which were not Materials anciently made ufe of in Mwfoj for the building of fumptuous Pala^- ces. The Perfian Hiftorians unanimoufly agree the Time When the Foundations of lauris were kid, to be in the yean 65. of the Hegyra : but they do hot concur in other particulars. Some afcribe the Foundation of it to the Wife of Califf of 'Bagdad, call'd Zebd-el-Cam, which fignifies c/ Ladies. They report, that file being dcfperately fick, a Median Phyfitian cur d her in a Chort time. For which the Princefs not knowing what Reward to give him, bid him make choice of his Recompence ; where upon the Phyfitian defir'd that fhe would build a City in his Country to the Ho* nor of his Memory. Which after fhe bad perform'd with ^ e-t Care and Diligence, he call'd the City Tehrif ; as a Memorial that it ow'd its Original to Wyf&amp;h For thatthrough the Black-Sea, and Colchis. figmfics Vhyfic, and &lt;%is is the ParticiplTof^,^, power forth, fcatter abroad, or give aLargefs. This is what fome re late; to which there are others that tell a Story not much unlike. For they fay, that fl^coac^General to (Re- Jhtd, having been two years fick of a Tertian Ague of which he never expefted to be curd, was ftrangely delivefd from his Diftemper by an Herb, which he found in the fame place where Tauns now ftands. And that to perpetuate the Me mory of fuch a fortunate Cure, he built this City, and call'd it Tcbnft; the Ague is gone. For fignifies alfo an gne, and rift comes from the Verb But that arei waids,either by Corruption,or becaufe it runs finooth- er upon the Tongue,it was call'd T inftead of Tehrift. Mir^athaer, one of the moft Learned Perfons of Quaiity that are in ferfia, the Son of Mr Treafurer of the Province, gave me another Reafon of the Etymology â€¢ that is to fay, that at the Time when this City was built* the Air was extremely wholefom and prefervative Agues : Which extraordinary Quality drew a world of Peo ple to it; and that therefore it was call'd Tebris, as if man Ihould fay, the Expeller of Agues. The fame Lord alfo fur. ther aifur d me, that there are in the Kings Treafury at han, certain Medals with the Infcription of that Zebd-el Ca- ton, which were found at Mar ant, a city near to with a great number of others both of Gold and Silver being the Coyns of the Ancient Kings of Media. And that he had ob. jervd others, with Greek Figures and Infcriptions, wherein he remembred the word Vakianous. And then he ask'd me if knew who that Dakianous was! To which I anfwer'd that I did not underftand the name, but that it might be very pro. bably the Name of Darius. In the 69. year after, the Foundation of Tauris, the City was almoft rum'd by an Earthquake. But Ca ff ot of the Race of the Abas's who then Reigned, not on y repair d but enlarg d it. A hundred fourfcore and ten years after that, the 14 of the Month Sefer, another Earth. ST' Tu 6 n râ„¢ than the former ' ucrerl y ruin'd it in one S' u The Geography relates,how that at the fame ^ ,X e r f ed in tbeat y' a Learned Aflrologer of fSc . u Jtoutaher,or JuB Father, who foretold that the . o arC 1 ^ ua t e ^ lou ^ happen upon the Sun's entrance in^ O bcorpto, in the year 235. of the Hegyra ; which anfwers ^e year 849. of the Chnftian and fiiould over. H h h h throwthe Travels of Sir John Char din into Perfia, throw the whole City : To which, when he found the Peo ple would give no Credit, he went and was importunat with the Governor, to force the People out of the City. The Governor, who was alfo the Catijfs Lieutenant, overall the Province, being always a great Admirer of judicial Aftrology, gave way to his Importunity, and did all he could to fend a- way the People into the Country : But finding that they ftill looktupon the Prediction of the Earthquake to be a meer mera,md fufpedled fome mifchievous Defign in the Governor, he could not perfwade above one half of the People to ftir ; which fell out to their Deftrudion. For the Earthquake hapÂ» p'ned exactly at the Hour mention'd in the Predidlion, to the overwhelming of forty thoufand Perfons. The next year Dtueyeron theSon of Mahamed^ondain-Jredi^Yice-Koy of receiv'd Orders from the Calif, to rebuild it larger and fairer â€¢ than it was before, and to know of that famous Aftrolcger Jboutaker, under what Afcendant he fhould begin to work : Who bid 'em begin when the Sun was in and aflur'd 'em the new City fhould never be troubled more with any Earthquakes : but that it was threatned with great InundaÂ» tions of Water. To which the Hiftory adds, that the Event has in all refpeds verifi'd the Truth of the Predidion. Af* ter this new Reftoration,XiÂ«m came to be wonderfully en- larg'd, famous and flourifhing. They aflure us, that in the Reign of Sultan Ca^an, which is about 400 years ago, it exÂ» tended in breadth. North and South, from the little Moun tain of Ain Ally to the oppofite Mountain, call'd and in length from the River Agi to the Village which is two Leagues beyond the City. The fame Hiftory alfo ob= ferves,for a Proof of the multitude of the Inhabitants where* with that City was peopl'd, that the Peftilence happening among 'em, there dy'd 40 thoufand in one quarter, before they were mifs'd. In the year 896. of the Hegtra, and 1490. ofChrift, the Princes of the Race of Shehh-Sephi having invaded re- mov'd the Seat of the Empire from Ardevil, which was their own Country,to this City. In the year 1514. Selim took it upon Compofition, two years after the King of 'Perfia, who thought himfelf not fafe there, retir'd from thence, and feated himfelf at Cashin. Selim flay'd not long at Tauris, but he carry'd away with him a wealthy Booty, and three thou- fand Families of Artificers, the mofl part Jmenians, whom he fettled in Conslantinople. Soon after his Departure, the In' habitantsthrough the Black-Sea, and t Colchis. 961 habitants of Tauris rebeird,ancl falling unexpeaedly upon the Turks, made a mod famous havock of the Enemy,and be came Mafters of the City, But Ibraim General to So- Uman the Magnificent, leverely reveng'd this Rebellion in the Year 955. of the Hegyra,and Year of our Lord 1548. For he took the City by Aflault, and gave the Plunder of it to his Army j who committed therein all manner of Inhumanity, even to an Excefs unheard of before.In a word,all that could be call'd Cruelty,Fire and Sword was there put in Execution.The Palace of King Tahmos, and all the moft confiderable Stru- dures were deftroy'd, and levell'd with the Earth. Yet not* withftanding all thefe Calamities, the City lifted up her head again at the beginning of Jmuraths Reign, and with the Af- fiftance of fome few Perfian Troops, put to the Sword all the Turkifli Garrifon, confifting of Ten thoufand men. murath difmay'd at the Courage of the fent a powers ful Army under the leading of Of man, his utterly to deftroy, and wholly to fubdue the Inhabitants. This Ar= my enter'd the City and pillag d it, in the Year Mahometan Accompt, and the Year of our Lord 1585. at what time the Vifir caus'd all the Fortifications which the Turks had railed before to be repair'd. But eighteen years after this Expedition, in the Year 1(503, t ^ e Great reÂ» took Tauris from the Turks with a fmall Force, but with that Policy, Diligence and Bravery,which is hardly to be credited^ He divided the ftouteft of his Soldiers into feveral fmall Bo dies, who furpriz'd the Corps du G and cut their Throats in fuch a moment of time, that they had no notice of it in the Town. Thefe Troops were follow'd by a Body of five hundred Men, difguiz'd like Merchants, who enter dtheCiÂ« ty with a plaufible Story, that they had left the Caravan $ days journey behind. Which the Turks readily believd, bc- caufe it is the Cuftom of the Cara that upon their Ap proach near to Great Cities, the Merchants go before 5 befides that, the Turks never dreamt but that they had been examin d by the Corps du Guard.Ah as follow d clofe, and feeing his men were enter'd, flew into the City at the head of fix thouÂ® fand Men; while two of his Generals did the fame on two other fides of the Town, So that the Turks, finding them- felves iurprif'd, furrender'd only Upon condition of Iparing their Lives. And the Hiftory farther obferves, that in this Expedition it was, that that fame Potent Prince firft order d one Brigade of his Army to carry Mufquets, and finding theI â€¢ â– â–  â–  â– . â€” â€” â€” ' , ' 562 The Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, good Effect of 'em, ordered a mixture of fire-Arms among all his Forces, Whereas before the Perfians never made ule of Guns in any of their Wars. Now that we may not omit any thing in the Hiftory of Tdwtfjthat is worthy Oblervation, it behoves us alfo to let ye know,what the Armenian Authors have wrote concerning it. They report that this City is one of the moft Ancient in all JJia, and that it was formerly call'd or the (Royal 'Placey for that the Verfian Monarchs there kept their Court: and that afterwards a King of Jrmenia, who was call'd Co/Â» roes,chang d the Name of it frem into Tauris, which in the Jmenian Language fignifies a Place for that he there defeated the King of ; who had murder'd his Brother. The Government of the Province of is the Chiefefl: in all the Empire, and annext to the Dignity of the Captain General-fhip. It brings him in thirty thouland ToÂ» mans Yearly,which amount to much above a Million fterling, befides Cafualties, which are very confiderable in the Afiatic Governments. The Governor bears the Title of hec. He maintains three thoufand Horfe; and has under him the Governors or of OroumiyMaraga^JrdeVd^nd Twenty who altogether maintain eleven Thoufand Horfe more. I lodg'd at the Capuchins Inn, who were arriv'd before me. They were no more then two, whom I defir'd to keep my Ar. rival private, for about fifteen days. Which I did to put my felf into an Equipage, and my Things in the fame Order, as they were before my misfortunes in ; as alfo to me thodize thole things which I had brought for the Kinu, to the end I might fliew em to the beft advantage at Court'' But my arrival could not be concealed, for Mir^athacr, Son of the Treafurer, and Receiver^ General of the Province, and admitÂ® ted by way of Survivor*fhipjunderftood that there were Strang* ers at the Capuchins Inn. And therefore he lent the 2 id to tell the Superior,that he wonder'd at his negleft in not comino to give him notice of the Arrival and Quality of the ans, which he entertain'd in his Houfe. To whom the Father excusd himfelf and farther told the Meflenger, that for my part,I had not fail d to wait upon him; had I not been ill difpo* ledjbut in a few ^ays I would attend and pay him my P efpefts. The 2 the lame Lord, whom I had the honour to know in my hrft Travels,made me a Vific,together wkh the Soji of the Can oWurnik, and fhew'd me great Civilities. He late two1 thro ugh the Black-Sea, and the Country 0/Colchis. vSi two hours in my Chamber, while I gave him an account of the affairs of Europe, particularly concerning Arts and Sti- ences. After which he was fo kind as to tell me the good fortune that had befalfn his Family, and his Brothers Em ployments. j. He was the eldeft of three young Lords, all in good Credit, and adyanc'd to Places both of Honour'and Profit. His Father is Treafurer, as i faid before, and Recei- verÂ«General of all the Kings Demeans, over all the Province of Azerheyan. This is that Mir ^a of whom fo many Accidents are related in the Story of Coronation; He was nor then at Tauris, in regard his Employments kept him at SbirVan, a City near the Cafpia Sea : whofe pkce this Mirzathaer fuppli'd in his abfence. He is very well read in the Jrahick, 'Pa(tan and Jurh/h Languages: and befides a taught him for feVeral years the Philofophy of the Schools, and all our Sciences. He is a very Learned Perfonage, a Man of ripe Wit, and extreamly civil. After t'wo hours difcourfe he prefs'd me to fhew him fome Jewels and Watches. To which I had no defire, as not being then in a Condition for the Reafbns already mention'd. But he importun'd me earneftly, and with an affability fo becoming,that I could not refufe him. So that I fhew'd him feveral Jewels which I had of a low value, of which he carry'd away feveral along With him. In the Evening Tahmas* t Bec y who fupplyes the place of Go&lt; vernor of J^erheyati in the flead of an four Can his Father, who is always at Court,fent his Goldfmith to me, to tell me, 1 fhould oblige him, by coming to him the next Mornings and bringing along with me fome Jewels and Rarities of fmall value : To which I anfwer'd that I would not fail him, and accordingly I went the fame day,and The 25. we heard while we ftay'd with thofe Lords,the Confirmation, and full Relation of a Robbery reported a month before, and committed the preceding upon the Great Caravan that goes from Ifpahan to the by land. This Caravan lets out once a Year in and goes through Candabar which is in SaBnana. The Robbery was very con* fiderable, as well for the Number of Perfons, for the vaft wealth that was in the Caravan, as alfo for the Confecjuences thatenfu'd. It was committed three days journey from the Frontiers of India , by the Agrvan, a fort of People much like the Tartars, but tributary to the ( Perfian They had intelligence which way the Caravan march'd, and furpriz'd k in a very ad- I i i i vantageou#V 5^4 TheT ravels of Sir John Ghardin Perfia, vantageous place for fuch a defign. They were in all five hundred Men, all well Mounted and well Refolv'd. The Caral'dn had a Convoy of about two hunderd, and confifted of about two thoufand Perfons, for the moft part The Convoy made no Refinance, but betook tfeemfelves to Flight: and the moft part of the GraVdn,following the Exam= pie of thofe that ihould have defended em, fhifted every one for themfelves. So that there were but eleven kill'd, fo fmall was the Refiftance made. Nor was it a thing to be wonder'd at. For the Caravans, and patticularly thofe of the are compos'd of Armenians and people that for the moft part will be Scar'd with a ftick. And they that had any Cou rage were left alone and abandon'd by thofe that fhould have affifted em ; So that every Man ftrove to fave one, and hapÂ» py he that could fhift for himfelf. The Robbery was valu d at feveral hundred thoufands of Pounds ; but the true and juft account could never be known, the Merchants upon fuch occafions ufually difguifing the Truth, fome becauie they are afraid of loofing their Credit, others for fear it fliould be dif- cover'd, that they conceal a part of what they fend to fave Cuftoms and Toll, The Inventory which was given into the King, fign'd by above fixty Perfons concern'd, amounted to no lefs then three hundred thoufand a million four hundred thoufand Pound fterling; yet we were affur'd it was but the half of the Lofs. The Governor of Candahar was accus'd to have been acceffory to the Robbery. The King therefore fent for to have him apprehended and brought to pahan upon a Camel chain'd about the Neck, with one Servant which he had the Liberty to make choice of. It was affirm'd that they who comitted the Robbery themfelves, were a fort of People fb ignorant,that they underftood not what belong'd either to Gold or Precious Stones. They divided the Coyn'd Money one among another, Gold and Silver intermix'd togeÂ» ther by weight, without any diftindion of Mettal, and jum bled the true Pearls with the falfe ones, without making any Difference. I muft confefs I could hardly believe this, nor had I reported it, if it had not been univerfally and conftantly a- vow'd by all the People I difcoUrs'd with upon this occafion. The firft of May the DeputyÂ»Governor lent to the Superi or of the Capuchins, to know if he had no news of the Arrival of the Patriarch of Armenia, and where he had conceal'd him* felf. Tis true we all knew well enough, but we had no mind to tell,knowing wherefore they (ought for him ; which wasthrough the Black- Sea,, and the Colchis. 565 was for no other reafon then to apprehend him; and carry him Prifoner to Ennjan. He had made his efcape fix days before , vex'd to the very Soul to find , that while the Go vernor pretended to take To much care to pay his debts, he minded nothing more then how to fqueeze a good Sum of Money for himfelf. For the Governor according to the forememiond Order from the Court, had fent to feve- ral Perfons about IriVm,to Levy the money for payment of the Patriarch's debts upon the Armenian Villages. But the Officers entrtifted to raife the Money had fo far out-ftrecch'd their CommifEon,in the outrages and violences which they committed, as to demand and levy double the fum which was imposd. All which the Patriarch Well knew : but conniv'd at it, for the advantage he was to receive thereby^ And he would fain have been handling the firft Money was brought to Erivan; but the Governor Was fo far from foffering him to meddle, that he would not pay above half to the Cuftomer of Conftantimples Trullces. So that of three thoufand five hundred pounds which Were rais'd for his SatiP- faction, he would not part With above two thoufand for the payment of the debts, The Patriarch complain'd of this Injuftice,but could have no Remedy. All the Governor faid to him was this, that if the Cuftomer of were pai'd in time 'twas as much as he could require, and that it did not belong to him to take Cognizance what was levy'd for that purpofe. But perhaps he could not chufe but be difturb'd with the Cfyes and Curfes of his own Nation : for they were bitterly enrag'd againft him, and his Proceedings. And therefore he refolv'd to ippe'afe *em withdraw himielf from the opprefiion of the Governor of which made him make his efcape, with a defign to make his Complaints to the Court. The Governor on the other fide, having notice of his Bight, fent a way to the neighbouring Governors to flop him; and he happen'd to be at Tauris, when theExprefs arriv'd there. But the Jrmehidn Inhabitants of the City pre- ferv'd him, not fo rtiTuch by concealing him in any private abfeonding Place,as b^ their Prefents to the Grandees, and for that the Injuftice that was done him in his private affairs, was To publickly notorious, that it was no more then what was reafonable for them,to let him have his Liberty to go to JffaÂ» haft for Redrefs. The 6. MiifterÂ»Mafter General of the Army fent to give me notice of his being come to Town. For he underftood M ! Si ,1 â–  i .

So that I went to vifit him the fame day, and to renew the friendfliip which I had con crafted with him in my firft Travels, He is a Perfonage the moft eminent for his Witt and Valour of any other in the whole Kingdom. He is Brother to the Governor of who was accus'd for being Acceflbry to the Robbing of the Caravan. His Father was Governor of ; and Abas had a great affedion for this for the fake of his Learning,his Courage,and his Graccfull Afpeft. Nor was it a- bove a year before,that the King had given him a CommiiG- on to go into the Province of Jzevheyan, to take a review of the Forces and Ammunitions there ; and now his CommiffiÂ® on was out, by which as I underflood, he had gotten above ten thoufand pounds. His Company and Difcourfe ex* treamly pleas'd me ; for he fiiew'd me feveral Mapps of the Province which he had newly made of which he promis'd me copies; and reaching down a Plain* Sphere, which had been lately printed in Europe, he fhew'd me feveral Faults in it: I alfo fupp'd with him, nor would he let me go til mid night. The 7. he did me the Honnor to give me a Vifit, and to fpend all the Afternoon in my Chamber. The 8, and the three days following, I made it my buGÂ« nels to fetch away fuch parcels of Goods from and Mir^a-thaer, which they refus'd to buy, after i had barÂ» gain'd with 'em for what they made choice of; tho all that I fold to both came but to a thoufand Crowns, and that wichÂ« out Profit. So that I had much ado to agree with em ; however I was paid when we all concluded. The one pre tended in abatement of ray price, his Fathers being a Favourite at Court j the other the great Credit which his Brothers and his Unckle Mir^a-Sadec, being Lord High Chancellor, had with the King; and fore'd me to take Letters of RecommenÂ» dation, which they freely offer'd to compenfate the Profit which I (hould have got by my goods.For a man would hardÂ» ly believe the Careffes, the Flattery,the engaging and familiar Behaviour, which the 'Perftans Grandees will condefcend to, for their own Interefts, how flight foever.

The 18.1 fet forward from with the Provoit ot MerÂ» chants Brother. He was one of the Kings Slaves,of whom we have fpoken already ; attended by ten Servants with fourteea Horfes. We travel'd through a lovely and even Country be tween Mountains ^ireaing our Courfe Southward. We lodgd at Vafrnge, a great Borough, confiftmg of Six hundred Hou- fes â–  watcr'd with a great number of pleaiant Rivulets, that with their Winding Streams enfertiliz d she neighbouring parts on every fide. It is furrounded with Gardens,and groves of Toilers and Tjkts, which they plant to ferve em for build ing their Houfes. â€ž . i-i The io . we travell'd five leagues ; croffing over a little Hill at firft â€¢ but afterwards over Plains that were wonderful pleafant, fertil and cover'd with Villages 5 that where we lodgd being call'd Jgi-agack Thefe Plains are the beft Pafture- Grounds in Media , if I may not prefume to fay in the world. The Choiceft Horfes in the whole Province are there put to Grafs, to the number of about three thouland. For it is the cuflom in ferfia to put their Horfes to grais for thirty five or forty days together, from Jpnl Which both purees, and refrefhes, fattens, and ftrengthens cm : And they feed 'em thiisWich Grafs, as well in the Stable as in the Fieldlbutall the reft of the Summer they mingle Straw cut veÂ» ry fmall with the Grafs.When I beheld thofe lovely Pafturages I ask'd the young Lord, with whom I travel'd,through the Black-Sea, and th of Colchis. 37 ivere any better in Media or tnhiiher fo delightful. Who anfwered m^jhat feen asthoje towardsDerhent [which is none fo large and fpacious.So that we may with good grounds believe; tha^ thofe Plains are the Hypopothon of which the Ancient Authors write,and of which ihey fay that the Kings of kept there in a Breed of fifty thoufand Horfes; and here it is that we muft fearch for the Plains of fo famous for the Nyfain Hoifes. And Stephen the affeits that Nyfa was in Media. By the way I cold the Gentleman my fellow Traveller, what Hiftories related concerning thefe Horfes and particularly what reports, that all the Nyfain Horfes were Jfobella colour'd; who anfwer'd that it was more then he ever read or heard of. I made the fame En quiry all along as I travell'd offeverall perfons.both of Lear ning and Quality, but never could learn that there was any part in Media, nor in all Verfta where all the Horfes we^ foal'd of an Ifabelk colour. The jo .we travell'd a Road that was even enough, but winding among Hills.After two hours travel we pafsdby the Ruins of a great City, which they faid had flourifli'd there in former times; but being almoft ruin'd was utterly deftroy'd by Jhas. Upon the left hand of the Road are to be feen large Circles of Hewn Stone ; which the Terftans affi'' 1 * 1 to be a great fign, that the Caous making war in held a Counfel in that place:it being theCuftom of thole People, that every Officer that came to the Council brought with him a Stone to ferve him inftead of a Chair. And thefe were a fort of Gyants. Herodotus alfo reports lomthing like to this,of a Perfian Army that went againft the Sgftox; tor he tells you that the Army being in Thrace, Darm Usew em a place and commanded that every one fhould lay a Stone therein as he pafs'd along. But that which is moft to be ad- mir'cL after obfetvation ofthefe Stones, is this, that they are fo big that eight Men can hardly move one, and yet there is no place from whence they can be imagin'd to have been fetch'd, but from the next Mountains, that are fix Leagues off. We met upon the Road, with three large and fair inns, and lode'd at a Village call'd c at the Foot of a little Hill: it was not fo big as but altogether as P The 21. we travel'd four Leagues over Hills and Dales, all fertil and delightful to admiration. In the mid-way we LIU P arsd \The Travels of Sir John Chardin into Perfia^ pafsd through a Village full of Popler Groves and GarcU ens, and well watet'd. Ic was call'd Turcman, becaufe that in the Fields that environ it, there are a great number of Shep. herds with their Flocks that are call'd by that Name. We ftopp'd at 'Peryare, another Village, as handfome and as large as Turcman, feated alfo in a bottom at the foot of a Hill, all aÂ» long by the Banks of a little River. The i. of June We travell'd two Leagues in a level Coun try, as even as that we had crofs'd the day before ; and four Leagues among the Mountains where the way was rugged and very uneafie. A little River but very rapid palles threugh the Midft of it; and by reafon of it's winding courfe oblig'd us to pafs it feveral times, to fliorten our way. We alighted at Miana. This is a Town ieatedin the middle of a fair and large Plain encompafled with Mountains , which upon that Road leparates Media from the Countrey of the Tarthians. Which is the reafbn that the Village car* rys that Name, for that SMiam properly fignifies, the par* ting of feveral Countries. To this Town there belongs a kind of Cullom-Houfe, where the Officers are faid to be very tyrannical in their exactions upon the meaner fort of People that travel that way. But they underftood who the Gentle man was who ttavel'd with me, and who I was; So that they durft not fo much as fhew themfelves; for there is that good order tak n in ferfia,and almoft all over the Eaft; that the Receivers of all Sorts of Tolls and Duties, have no per- miffion or Authority to demand any thing of any eminent Perfon,of any Officer of the Kings,how inconfiderable loever his office may be, nor of any Stranger of Quality. For fliould they be fo bold, as to examin what they carry d, the offence would be puniili'd with Baftinados. The 2. we fpent fo much time in fording the River of Mtana, and found the Mountain beyond it, that we were to crofs, to be fo rugged, that we could not travel above three Leagues. We were two hours before we could find the Ford, and get our Sumpters over, which at length we got over fafe without any Damage , thanks be to God ; and five hours croffing the Mountain which was very high, and very fteep, being the Bounds between and Thefe two fpacious Provinces are parted by a Ridge of Mpun- tains, which are a Branch of Mount that extends it felf from Europe to China, croffing, as has been Mngrelia, Georgia, the Country of the , thethrough the BJack-Sea^ and the Country of CoTchis. the Province of Candabar, and the At the top of the Mountain upon the point of a Rock,we fpy'd a large ruin'd Ca* (lie,which the 'Perfians call the V Ci?y//t,allcdging that taxerxes caus d it to be built to imprifbn therein a Princels of the Blood. But Abas the Great caus'd it to be utterly dernoli- fhed, asferving only for a Retreat to a number of Robbers that made themfclves as it were foveraign Lords of the Moun= tain. On both fides of the Mountain are large Caufeys,which that great Prince caus'd to be made,for the eafe of Travellers in the Winter. Towards the end of our journey we pafs'd a large River, call'd KeftUheufe over a fair Bridge, and lay at Semele. Which is an Inn or Cara built near the Bridge to lodge Travellers that can reach no farther. The River J^efil'heu^eis much larger and more rapid than that of Miana, and ferves to bound Media from the Country of the Parthians. And now no fooner have you pafs'd this River, but you may eafily perceive the change of the Air. For whereas the Temperature of is fomewhat moyft and cloudy, which is the reafon of high Winds and much Rain, and that the Soil is fruitful of it lelf, whatever andÂ« ent Authors have wrote to the contrary, the Parthian Air is dry to the extremcft degree jinfbmuch that for fix Months to gether you Oiall neither fee any Rain or any Clouds: but the Soil is fandy,and Nature produces nothing without good Huf- bandry and PaitM. The Country of the Parthians, which was fo long the'Sea? of the Empire of /j-t^isthe largeft amlprincipal Province of the Perfian Monarchy. It is all the proper demeans of the King, nor has it any Governor, as the moft part of the reft of the Provinces. The Perfians bound it to the Eaft, by the ProÂ» vince of Corajfon, or Cwomitrem 5 to the South, by that of Fars-, which is properly ferfut-, to the Weft, by J^erbeyanot Media ; to the North, by Guilan and which compofe the Province of Hyrcania. This Province extends itfelf at leaft two hundred Leagues in length, and an hun* dred and fifty Leagues in breadth. The Air is very dry, and and the moft healthy for the moft part of any in the world. It is more mountainous then level. The Mountains are alfo very bare, and to fpeak in general terms, produce nothing but Thiftles and Briers: but the Plains are very fertile and pleafant, where there is any Water : o herwife the Soyl is ve ry barren. This large Province contains above forty Cities, which is very much in Terfia, as not being an Empire peopl d proportionably to its Extents Th^374 T he Travels of Sir John Chardin into Periia, The Orientals call the Country of ; that is to fay, Ter/tan Ai'ack- They call itlikewife or the Country of the Mountains, for the reafon's already recited. My Opinion is, that the Scythians from whom, as ancient Au thors hold, the fParthians deriv'd their Original., were the Uf, fer Tartars, that inhabit to the North of now call'd Yuzhecs, and formerly 'Baftrians ; and that that fame Jrfaces, who founded the Empire of the was a Native of the fame Country with Tamerlan, and thofe other Tartar Princes,that made fuch great and famous Concjuefts in the Ages lafl paft. The ]&lt;!. we travell'd four Leagues keeping on to the South, as when we firft let out of Taurts : the Road was very good, only we had Mountains very near us upon the right and left hand. We lay at Sir [ham ; which is a large Inn, adjoyning to three or four fmall Villages, but leated in a fandy anddry Soyl; and there the Officers that gather the Duties upon Goods tranfported out of the Kingdom keep their Poft. The 4th. we travell'd feven Leagues, through bufliy Plains and Sands 5 and we were forc'd to make feveral windings and turnings,by reafon of feveral Mole-Hills and little Sand- Hills in our way.Ne verthelels both on one the fide and t'other, at a diftance we could fee a Champian Country,very delight ful and fertile, and Villages here and there, which yielded a very delightful Prolpeit; the River Zenjan wat'ring thole Vil lages. We lay at a large CaraVanjeray call'd Niche, built beÂ» tween five fpacious Villages. The 5 th. we travell'd fix Leagues through a Road more pleafant and lefs crooked, and obferving the fame Courfe as the day before j and lodg'd at Zerigan, a little City,that con tains not above two thoufand Houfes. It is feated in a very narrow Plain between two Mountains that cnclofe it, not above half a League one from the other. The Soyl of Zerigan is fertile and pleafant, and the Air wholfome and cool in the Summer. The City without is furrounded with Gardens,that yield both Pleafure and Profit, but within the Town there is nothing remarkable but the great Ruins. The Hiftory of 'Per[la records this City to have been founded in the Reign of Ardechir^hahe^on, fcveral Ages be fore Chrifl; and farther adds,that it confifted of twenty thou fand Houfes, which is very probable, for that heaps of Rub- bifh, and Ruins are to be feen for a mile together round about it.through the Black-Sea J and t Colchis. 375 it. Tamerlan the firft time he pafled through it, utterly demoÂ» liQi'd it: but the fecond time, that is to fay, in his Return out of Turkey, he order'd a part of it to be rebuilt, underftanding that it had been For a time a flourifhing Nurfety of Arts and Sciences; and had produced feveral learned and famous Men. For which reafon it is much celebrated among the Eaftern Au- thors.The 7tirks and Tartarstha.tra.va.g'dTerfiafincQTatm fack'd and deftroy'd it feveral times,and it is no longer ago then fince the beginning of this laft Age, that they began to rebuild it. The 6th. Our road lay through a Country, the moft lovely delightful that every Eye beheld,through a fair Plain wherethe road was level and very ftraight. Several pleafant Streams glide through it,that render the Sbyl very fertil. The whole Plain isfbftrow'd with Villages, that they are hardly to be number'd, with fo many Groves and Gardens,that for me the moft pleafant Land-skips, and charming Profpeds in the World. We alighted after a journey of five Leagues at a Car a' Vanferai caird(?Â«eÂ«r&amp;4oÂ«/ag,over againft and within a good CaÂ» nons fhot of Suit ante. This City is feated at the foot of a Mountain, as you may fee by the Draughc which I have made of it. It feems a far off very neat and well built, and inflames a Man with a Cu- r 0 fi,y to fee it: but when you approach near it, it ceafes to be the fame thing, and appears lefs beautiful then When ye are within it. Yet there are fome publick Buildings very remarkas ble,as well for the Strudure as the Archicedure,together with about three thoufand Habitations. The people of the Coun try affirm, that this City took up formerly half a League of Gtound more to the Weft then it doesi, and that the ruin'd Churches,Mofques and Towers, which are to be feen at that diftance on that fide, ftood in the heart of the City. Which probably may be true, feeing that Hiftories aflure us that ic was once the Metropolis and biggeftCity of the Kingdom : nor are there many Cities in the world, where there arc vafter RuÂ» ins to be feen. Provifion alfo is there very plentiful and ve^ iy cheap. The Air is likewife very wholefome, but fubjedl to change. Per in all the Seafons it changes almoft every hour. The Evenings, Nights and Mornings being cold,but all the daylong very hot; from one Extreme to another. tany lies in 36. deg. 18. min. of Latitude, and 48. deg. 5. min. of Longitude, and is govern'd by a Sultan. Some Hiftories of Terfia relate, that this City is one of the moft ancient in all the Â£ountry of the but that ic M ra m m ' 1557^ The Travels of Sir John Chardin into Perfia, is not known who was the Founder. Others on the other fide affirm, that the foundations of it were laid when the Sun was in Leo, by the order, and in the Reign of the Son of ./#AW=CiÂ»,and Grand-child j and that becaufe it could not be finifli'd in his days,his Son compleated the work and call'd it Suit aim } or the (Royal For Sultan properly fignifies a King : from whence comes Seltenet, the ufual Perfian word for a Kingdom or Monarchy.

For in old frftan, fignifies a Cicy, To that Tigranoterta fignifies no more then the City of Ttgranes ,\\ho was King of as is well known to every ordinary Reader.

I fliould not aflert this lb confidently, did I not fee, that other Modern Relators commit alfo very great Errors in what they publifh, either upon the obfervations or report of others: fb that there is not not any one from whom I might not produce examples fufficient to confirm this Truth. This City has been feveral times laid in heaps; Firft^ Cot^a 'Re{hid King of 'Per/ta whom other Hiftorians call for that it had rebell'd, and tak'n up Arms againft him.

We lay at Hibie, a very fair and fair and large Village ; and feated near to a Town that is wall'd and well peopl'd, which is call'd San-cata : which word being abbreviated figni=&gt; fies the CaHle of Hafan. The %th. Our Horfes were fo tir'd that we could get no farther then Ebher, which is no more then two leagues frorri Htbie-, though we travell'd all the way over moft of thofe de lightful and pleafant Plains already mention'd, diredting our Courfe ftill to the South. Now that which makes thofe places fo delightful is the great Number of Rivulets, with which they are water'd, and the good Husbandry of the lnhaÂ« bitants. For as I have already laid, the foyl of the 'Parthians is dry and barren of it felf; neverthelefs wherever it can be water'd, it produces whatever the Manurer pleafes to have it, fair and good in its Kind, Ebher is but a fmall City, counting only the buildings 5 for it contains not above two thoufand five hundred Houfes; but to thofe Houfes belong fo many Gardens, and thofe fo large, that it is good riding for a Horfcman to crofs it in half an hour, A fmall River, that bears the name of the City, runs through the middle of it, from one end to the other. It is faid to be the fame City which the Ancients call'd Baron- tha. The fituation of it is jolly and delightful, the Air very wholfom, and the Soyl produces plenty of Fruit and other Provifions. The buildings are tolerably handfom ; and the Inns, the Taverns and other publick Structures very well, confidering the Place. It contains three fpacious Mofquees 5 and in the middle of the City are to be leen the Ruins of a Caftle built of Earth. It lies diftant from the 56 deg, 45.min.and from the fortunate Iflands, 48. deg. ^o. mku Which Longitude,and all others that I obferve, are tak'n from the new Terjian Tables. It is govern'd by a 'Darogut-,ot 1 and the Mirtjhecar'bajhi, or Chief has his Affigna- tions of Money charg'd upon the Revenue of this City. Which aflignation iscall'd Tahiti.Of the fignification of which Word we fhall fpeak more at large in another Place.The Travelf of Sir Joh n Chardin into ~~The Perfian Geographers affert that Ehher was built byl{ei* Cofrnu the Son of Sta-bouch, that DarahK^ethonifix to build the Caftle,that Skendtr-roumyjh&amp;t is finifli'd it,and that the City has been ruind and fackd as of. ten as the reft which are near it. However ihe has io well recover d her felf, that, at prefent, there is but little appear- ance of thofe former havocks. The fame Geographers ob= ferve that it is one of the moft Ancient Cities of that Province; and perhaps it may be either Volog or Jr* tacanttfof which there is fo frequent mention made in the Ancient Stories of &lt;Perfta. At Ehher they begin to fpeak Verfianpoth in the Cities and Country : whereas all the way before the Vulgar Language is Turkifli, not altogether as they fpeak it in Turkey,but with (tmie little difference. From Ehh to the Indies they Ipeak &lt;Perltan,mott or lefs neat,as the people are more or lefs at a di- ftance from Shim, where the purity of the Perfian Language is fpoken : So that at Ehher, and in the parts thereabouts, 'tis but a rude and clownilh fort of Dialect which the people makeufeof. . , r , The ythwe travell'd nine Leagues over Plains delightful ev'n unto Admiration : and indted more lovely Vales are no where to be feen. After we had rode three Leagues, we pafs'd through a large Town, almoft as big as Ehher, call'd ( Parfcic ; and a little farther we left Cafhm upon the left hand, five Leagues diftant from us : of which 1 made the folIowÂ» ing defcription in the year 1674. during a refidence of four Months that I fta/d at Court. Cafhin is a great City feated in a delightful Plain, three Leagues from Mount Jlou-njent : which is one of the higheft and moft famous Mountains in all and a Branch of Mount Taurus, that croffes the Northern Parts of as has bin already faid, and feparates it from Hyrcania. The length of this City is from North to South. In former times it was furrounded with Walls,of which the Ruins are ftill to be fcen,but at prefent it lies open on every fide.lt is miles in cir cumference,containing tvÂ«elve thoufandHoufes,and a hundred thoufand Inhabitants 5 among which there are forty families of Chriftians, and a hunder'd of Jews, all very poor. One of the faireft places that is to be feen in this City, is the drome, which they call May dan* (ha, or the Royal Tiaz^a, 700 pacesinlcngth, and 250 in breadth, and made after the Mo- del oil/palm. To the Royal Palace belong feven Gates, of ' whichthrough the Black- Sea, and th Colchis. 579 which the chief is call'd Ali-capi, or the High-Gate ; on which there is an Infcription in Letters of Gold, to this effed:. May this Gate always be open to good Fortune make, that there is no God hut God. The Gardens belonging to the Palace arc very beautiful, kept in good order, and planr- ed Checquer=wile. King Tahma built this Palace, at firft a fmall thing,according to a draught given him by a Architect. Jbaf the Great quite alter'd and enlarg'd it. There are but few Mofques at Cafbin ; The chiefeft of which by them call'd Met[hid'guima,or the Mofque of the Congregation, was founded by Hami-- ( l(efhid, of in the year of the Hegyra 170. The Royal Mofque call'd Met(hid--Jha is one of the largeft and faireft in all being feated at the end of a Ipacious Street, planted with fair Trees,which begins from one of the Gates of the Palace Royal. This Molque was almoft all built at the expences of and in his Life time : his Father IJhmael having laid the Foundations,but dying before they came to be even with the ftreet. There are alfo feveral handfome buildings among the or Publick Inns. That which they call the Royal Inn, con tains 250.Channels , has a large Fountaine planted with Trees, in the middle of the Court, and two Gates, which the lead in the Court from two ftreecs full of fhops where the moft coftly fort of Merchandifes are ibid.

Which want of water is alfo the reafon that the Air of Cafbin is heavy, thick and not very healthful, efpecially in Summer; by reafon that the City not having a running ftream, has neither any finks to carry away the filth of the Town. Yet notwithftanding this fame fcarcity of N n n n water. it? 8o The Travels of Sir Joh n Chardin Periia, water, the City abounds in Meat and all manner of Provifions, for that the Plains that lie round about it are fo well watcr'd, that they feed a world of Cattel, and produce a prodigious plenty of Corn and Fruits, Among the reft the faireft Grape in (Perfia, which they call Sha or the Royal Grape, being of a Gold Colour, tranfparent and as big as a fmall Olive. Thefe Grapes are dry'd and tranfported all over the King, dom. They alfo make the ftrongeft Wine in the World, and the moft lulcious, but very thick,as all ftiong and fweet wines ufually are. This incomparable Grape grows only upon the young Branches, which they never water. So that for five months together they grow in the Heat of Summer, and under a fcorching Sun, without receiving a drop of water ei. therfrom the skie or otherwife. When the Vintage is over, they let in their Cattel to browze in the Vineyards; afterwards they cut offall the great Wood, and leave only the ^oung ftocks about three foot high, which need no propping up with Poles, as in other places, and therefore they never make ufe of any fuch fupporters. There is alfo great Plenty of Piftachio's in thofe parts, where the Air is very hot in the Summer all the day long, by reafon of the high Mountain that lies to the North.

The raoft part of our Europea Chorographers who have dif- cours'd of the Cities of 1VyÂ»&lt;i,affirm to be the ancient facia that before it was call'd till the gave it that name from Jrfaces y the firft of their Emperors ; that is it the fame with that City,which the Greeks call'd (Ragea,and the hoÂ» ly Scripture (Rages of Media. Some are of opinion, that it was that fame Cafbtra of which Straho makes mention,but thePerfian Hiftories will not allow it to be fo ancient. TheHiflory entitl'd Elbeijon, or the Explication, relates, That this was founded by Shapour the Son of Ardefhir 'ba and that he gave it the name of Shaepour, as much as to fay, the For Shae iy figntfies a fQng ; and in the ancient a Son.

That this Gaftle was feated in the middle of the City, where is now the Royal (Pi- azga of Cafbin^nd that it was ruin'd by the in the time of Of man, one of Mahomets firft fucceflbrs. And indeed alÂ« moft all their Hiftories make mention Â©fthis Caftle, and fay, that after it was demolifh'd it was rebuilt again much larger then before, and a great Town rais'd round about it. JaeL-hadibilla, the Son of Mahometmehdy, Califfof caus'd it to be furrounded with walls in the i70.year of the Hegyra, and about a thoufand paces from it built a little City,which he call'd by his own name Medina'J/Houffi, which name one large Ward or Quarter of Cafbin carrys to this day. one of the Calijfs freed Servants,who had the Government of the Province,and to whom the work wa^recommended,built another City,at an equal diftance,and call'd it Moubarekie, for the prefervation of his name,which fome time after caiU Moubarec-abad. Moubmc fignifying Haron-^efhid Brother and Succeffor to Moufa-elhadi,joyrid thefe three little Cities into one, by filling up the void fpace with a great number of buildings j and then order'd the whole to be encompafs'd with Walls and Fortifications.Which work was begun in the 190 year of the Hegyra. alfo had a defign to have made it a Bull-wark againft the Incurfions of the Hircaniam and Dedamites , and a Magazine fot the warr which he was intending againft Ibe and withal a place of Trade: but dying not long after, the work remain d imper fect. In the year 345 , in the Reign of Muktadis-biUa'Mdufi, Nufa's fon, who had fliaken off the Yoak of that. and ufurp'd the Royal Authority in finifh'd the Walls and Fortifications, and gave to the City, the name of CafVm, for the word is fometimes pronounc'd with a b , and fometimes with a from a word that fignifies Punifliment or I : 1 &lt; IThe Travels of Sie John Chardin into Perfia, or pain, becaufe he imprifon'd in chac Gaftle all his which he defign'd to punifh. There is alfo another reafon giv'n for the Denomination, that is to fay, becaufe this City- was once a place of Exilement. Tho an Author,is of a different opinion ; for he believes that the Ci= ty of Cafbin was fo call'd by King Cafbin, after his own name. In the year 3 ($4. a part of the Wall being falln down, Sa- heb CaliffI/hmael, chief minifter of ftate to Jlie fecre-deulet, King of tyerfia, caus'd the Ruins to be repaired, and being ah moft utterly deftroy'd in the Civil Wars, fer, took care of its Reftauration, and in the year, 411. caus'd the work to be follow'd fo clofe, that within two Years , there was no figne of any Ruins. The Hiftory of Cafhin makes mention of two other fatal difafters that be* fell it, occafion'd by Earth-quakes. The firft in the year 460. that overturn'd all the walls and a third part of die Build* ings: And the fecond which did not fo much mifchief as the firft, in the year 562. at what time the Son. of Jbdallfcehnegare, who reign'd in the Country of the Turthians, remov'd his Court near Cajbniyto view the Ruins, and take care of the Reparations. And becaufe that the walls which were then only ofEarth did not feem fufficiently beautiful nor ftrong enough for fo great aCiry,he caus'd that which the Earth-quake had left ftanding,to be pull'd down,and rais d up other Walls of red Brick. The Walls were a hundred thoufand and three huaÂ» dred paces in compafs, and at the end of every five hundred paces fortifi'd with T owers. The and utterly ruin'd thefe Towers and Walls at feveral Times, and thofe that were rebuilt in their Room, after the deftrudtions of eve ry new invafion. The Ruins of which are ftill to be feen, as I have faid already. After all Cajbin was reftor'd and rebuilt as you lee,ithas enÂ» joyd forabove thefe three hundredyears both peace and plenty, bythe Advantage of its fituation,which renders it fo convenient for the Trade of Iberia^Hyrcania, and the Southern Provinces of the Kingdom.In thepj j^yearof the T.ihnids, defpairing to. defend T againft retir'd to Cdsbin , and made that City the of his Kingdom : finding it convenient for all Seafons in the Year. There he pent the Winter; in the Summer he retir'd three or four Leag^into the Country, and liv'd in Tents, at the foot of Mount Ahwvent, in a place abounding with cool Springs andthrough the Black Sea., a Country 0/Colchis. and pleafant Shades. His Succeflbrs liv'd after the nunc Race till Ahas the Great, who the firft year of his Reign remov'd his Court to Ifpahan. And there are feveral Reafons alleda'd for this Change. Some attributed it to the Air of which the King did not find fo healthful : Others affirm chat he was frighted by the J/lrologers, who told him, that the Stars threat ned him with feveral Misfortunes if he ftaid at Cashtn. But others alfert, ic was only the better to accom= plifli the defign of building a new City, as being over per. iwaded, that ic was the furer way to Eternize his Memory then all his great Anions. But the moft probable Reafon was one which I heard from a great Lord, who was high- ly efteem'd by chat Potent Prince, That when he had laid the defign of chofe Conquefts which he made wich fo much Renown, as well to che Eaft as co che Souch, he forfook Cas- bin and remov'd co l/pahan, chat he might be nearer che Coun- try which he incended co Conquer. However ic were, che City is much decay'd, fince che Re= moval of the Royal Refidence, and chac it has loft all thofe Perquifices chac fee forch che Pomp and Grandeur of a fump- tuous Courc. The Succelfors of Jhas have refided there for one or cwo years cogecher, and the deceas'd King was upon his way chither when he dy'd.

We ended our days Journey ac I\Ure, a large Village con- fifting of five hundred Houfes; in the midft of which upon a rifing Ground ftands a Caftle of Earth half ruin'd. The Remainder of feveral ftrong Places in this Country demo= lifli'd in the 13.

The 10. wetravell'd four Leagues in a plain and plea- fant Country, as in the preceding days Hill dire ding Courfe to the South. And our manner of travelling all the way,parÂ» ticularly from Wane, which is upon the Confines in the Even* ing an hour or two before Sun fet,rode a Journey.of five or fix Leagues by Midnight, or thereabouts. Longer Journeys of eight or nine Leagues held us almoft all night long which is the general way of travelling over all theEaft in Summer time,to avoi'd the heat of the Sun, which would melt both Man and Beaft in the day time. In the night we travell d a greater pace and more at eale : the Servants walk a foot with lefs trouble; and the Mailers themfelves are glad to walk fometimes, when they find themfelves fleepy, and to lhake offthofe little fhiverings causd by the Coolnels of the Air ; befides that it is a great eafe to the Horles. When you get to your Inn, you go to Bed, and fetch up that lleep in the day, which you loft in the night. Another advantage of tra velling by night is this, that the Beafts of Carriage, reft all the time that the Heat and the Flies moleft 'em, and are betÂ» tet lookt after, while the Servants drefs em by daylight; befides that in the day time Provifions both for Horfe and Man are more ready to be had. And then again the Hofts of the CaraVattferay, having flept almoft all the day for want of Employment, are then up and ready at all Commands. The firft thing which the Grooms do, at the firft coming into the Inn, is to walk the Horfes, then they cloath them and loolen their Girts. About an hour or two after, they give 'em to eat,and then the Grooms go to fleep : about nine or ten a Clock every body rifes, and eats a light Breakfaft ; afterthrough the Bkck-Sea^ and cf Colchis. after that the Grooms drefs their Horfes, and the Cooks get ready their Viftuals. In the mean time the Mafter betakes himfelf again to his Reft, or elfe otherwife employs himfelf. About four a Clock they meat their Horles with Barley (for they never give 'em Oats in the Eaft) and then put on the Sad dle : at which time Supper is lerv'd in. While the Mafter Sups, the Cook cleanfes the Kitchin Furniture, and the ( [ e Chamhre puts up the Mafias, which is a kind of Portmantle where the Bed and Bed-cloaths are put up, with as much ConÂ» venience as in a Cheft, of which one Hoile will carry two. Then the Servants go to Supper, while the Mafter gets him' felf ready and pnts on his Boots. When the Servants have fupp'd, which is foon done among the Afiatics *. the Cook puts up his Utenfils, and the Groom bridles and girts up the Hor fes, and the reft fold up the Carpets, or do what elfe belong to their Duties ; laftly, they load and fo depart. They that have not feen the Fafhions ot the Eaft, will hardly believe with what Conveniency Men travel in thofe Parts. Howe ver it is very great, though a man may be faid to carry a whole Houfe a long with him ; and the reafon is, becaufe eÂ« very Servant knowing what he has to do, every thing is dif- patch'din an Inftant. Welodgd which fignifies theHabitationof Dogs; being a Town as large as Kjare ; feated in a fair Plain,where there are a great number of Villages. There are no Inns at either of thofe two places, but in each fifteen or twenty great Houfes, which the Owners keep open for the Entertainment ol Travellers, and which are kept much more cleanly than the Carayanferais, There is alfo much better Accommodati on, but at a dearer rate : For the Hoft not daring to demand either for his Lodging or his Trouble, which is not the Cu* ftom, he pays himfelf by the Provender and Provifions which he fells his Guefts at his own price, whereas in the every thing is tax'-d. . The ii . we travell'd eight Leagues : the firft two over Mole-hills and little hills,where the way was fom what rugged; the reft over a fair champaign Ground full of Villages,and for the moft part well manur'd. It is faid to be the place where the Battel was fought between Lucullus and Mithridates,a.nd which the defeat of Crajjus render'd yet more famous in the Roman JHiftory. , r We alighted at an Inn call'd Knskelrou, one of the faireft aud largeft that ever was built in There are belong ing,The Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, Ing to it two Gardens,two Cifterns,a Bath,and a fmali Canal; being altogether the Gifts of the Chief Wife of Abas the Great. She founded this place, and fettled a Revenue of Fourfcore Pounds to pay four Servants that were to lodge in the Inn, meerly to keep it clean,and to wait upon Travellers. But the fourfcorcPounds have bin fince conveited to other ufes,through the Covetoufnefs of theTruftees. Which is the reafon thac the Carayanferai lies very nafty every where, and runs to ruin for want of good keeping. It coft four Thoufand Tomans the Building, which comes to eighteen thoufand Pounds. There are alfo in 'Per/Mother Inns, befides Bridges, Caufeys, and Hofpitals, remaining Monuments of the Charity of that Princefs, which have render'd her Name famous, and if we may believe public Report,fhe expended in Pious Works, no lefs than a hundred thoufand which make about four hundred thoufand Pounds Sterling. The u. wetravell'd eight Leagues, three over the plea- fant Plains where ftands fyskekou ; and five in a deep Coun- try, where the Road is fomewhat crooked and rough. Two hours before day we arriv'd at and lodg'd in the Sub urbs that lie upon the high Road. Sa'va is a great City feated in a fandy and barren Plain, within fight of Mount JloWVent. It is two miles in Circuit, and girt with walls, but thinly peopl'd ; forunlefs it be the Heart of the City, the reft runs to ruin for want of Inhabit tants. The Walls are alio in a bad condition, nor is there any thing remarkable round about it; tho formerly it has been a fair City, as the ruins of feveral great Strudtures de- monftrate. There runs a fmall River through, and a good number of Canals. The Soyl is dry and landy; producing nothing without Art and Induftry ; yec it is beautify'd with a great number of Gardens. The Air is there very hot, and unhealthy. It lies 55. deg. 50. min. of Lat. 85. deg. of Longitude ; and is goveru'd by a Derogus or Mayor The Hiftories ofPer/Munanimoufly con(ent,tbat the whole Plain of SaVa, was formerly a Salt Marfh or Lake, like to that Lake which is calld the not above twenty Leagues from this City to the Eaft, and which is crofs'd oyer a Cuifey thirty Leagues in length, as ye travel from Jfpahan into Hyrcania 5 but thofe Hiftories do not agree upon the time that this Marfli was dry'd up.

But Coja-Sehid-el'din the Son of Sayegl rebuilt it forty years after that, much more ftately than it was before its Deftrudtion, walld it, and pav'd it with red Bricks. Sometime after that Coja-Sehid el-din enlarg'd it to the North, and brought the water to it through ten Chan nels, and built a fpaciods Mofcjue in the Eaftern part of it, upon the fame Foundation where the Son of 1* mam- Moufa-- Casern had built one feveral Ages before.

Oppofite to this, thac is Weftward, nine miles from the City, under the lame Pa rallel, are to be feen fome footfteps here and there of that famous City of Qfyy, the biggeft City in JJla. The Won ders that are recounted of it are incredible, neverthelefs they are generally ascertain'd by all Hiftorians ; and by fome as if they had been Eye^witnelfes. The Perfian Hiftories re- portjthat in the Time of Calife Medyhllta'abot{-Mahamed=Dar* Vanich, who liv'd in the ninth Age of Chriftianifm, the City of ^ey was divided into 96 Quarters, of which everyone con- tain'd 46 Streets, and every Street 400 Houfes and ten Mofques. That there were moreover in the City ($400 Colleges, 16600 Baths, 15000 Towers of Mofques; 12000 Mills, i^oo ChanÂ» nels, and 13000 Inns. I dare not infert the number of Houfes, becaufe I cannot believe there were half fo many people : Ne verthelefs our Geography is in that particular afferted, and juftifi'd by all the Oriental Authors.

And hence it was, that thofe pompous Titles were given her in Hiftories, of Cities, the Spoil fe of the World, Earth, and the Market of the Unh&gt;erfe. Nor is the Original of (^ey lefs remarkable. The Chronicle of the Map makes Chus, the Grand-Child of Noah, to be the Founder of it, and adds that he laid the firft Stone when the Sun was in But the Vulgar Opinion is, that it was founded by Houfhetng-'Pifh* dadi, or Chief Jufiiciary.

[being was rhe fecond King of that Race. firfl: King after Houjheing, greatly enlarg'd it : and it continu'd in its Splendor till the Conqueft of the firfl; Mahumetans that deftroy'd it. Mehdi hilla, furnam'd Man/our, or the Viftorious, the third Cahjfe of !B(t&amp;ji/oM,rais'd it to be greater and more po pulous then before ; and under his Succeflbrs it was,that it arrived to that degree of Grandeur which we have related. The laft deftrudion that befel it happen'd in the Time of the Civil Wars, at what time the Tartars extended their Incurfi. ons into the Country of the Parthians. The Religion of the Mahumetans was then divided into Seds,as at this day : fo that the Sedt of Shia y which was that which the Perfians ftuck to, and that of the Sumis which the Turks follow'd, divided the whole Country. Thefe two Fadions were at War for fixty years together, and the Seft of Shia being born dovsn^by the the Affiftance of the petty Tartars, who are Sunnis, the vi6foÂ» rious Sed fub-divided themfelves into two other Opinions, which they call from the Name of their firft Broachers, Shafai and iittii/fi,which flouriflito this day among the Mahumetan Sunnis. Thefe Wars, together with the Incurfions of the Tar tars, deftroy'd the Potent and redue'd it to nothing be- fore the end of the fixth Age of the Mahumecan Epoche.

This City has produe'd a great many Learned Men, and hoarded within its own bofom for feveral Ages, the chiefeft part of the Riches of the Eaft. It is reported that during its Splendor, the fmaller Mofques had no lefs then a hundred Branches of all forts of Metal, furnifh'd with burning Tapers, and the larger Mofques five hundred, that were kept lighted all night long. The 1we travell'd fix Leagues through a plain and le vel Country : but the Road was full ol turnings and wind* dings, by reafon of the turning and winding of the River, and the leveral Canals in feveral parts of -the Plain that water the Grounds. We pafs'd over one large Bridge,and feveral fmall ones, and lodg'd at a great Inn built upon a flat piece of Ground, near to four others which are not fo big.

And this is peculiar to the white Ware,which is thence tranfported, that in the Summer .it cools the water wonderfully and very fuddenly, by reafon of continual Tranfpiration. So that they who defire to drink cool and delicioufly, never drink in the fame Pot above five or fix days at moft. They walh it with Rofe-Water the firft time,, to take aWay theillfmell of the Earth ; and they hang it in the Air full of water, wrapt up in a moift linnen Cloth. A fourth part of the water tranfpires in fix hours the firft time, after that ftilllefs from day to day, till at laft the Pores are clos'd up, by the thick matter contein'd in the water, which flops in the Pores. But fo foonasthe Pores are ftopp'd, the water ftinks in the Pots, and you muft take new ones. There are in this City a vaft number of deep Cellars, out of which the People draw water to drink : to the greateft part of which Cellars, you muft go down a def- centTof forty or fifty Steps, that are very fteep to boot. But the water which they fetch from thence is as cool as any Ice 5 coming fromÂ»Fountains that are ftopt with Cocks . So that this Water is a moft delicious Refrefhment in the Sum mer, which is furioufly hot at and all the adjacent Parts. This City alfo contains a great number of fair Inns and Mofques, of which the faireft is that wherein the two laft deÂ» ceas'd Kings oCPerfia lie enterr'd. And here I fhall give you the Platform of that Celebrated Mofque, fo much talk'd of over all the Eaft. It has four Courts belonging to it, as you may perceive by the Draught- The firft is planted with Trees and Flowers like a Garden : being a long Square, having an Alley in the middle which is feparated from the Beds and Plots by a Baluftrade. There arc alfo two Terrafles an each fide, running the full length of the Garden , three foot high. Upon each fide of which there are twenty Chambers vaulted, nine foot fquare, C^qcjq one G IThe Traveh cf Sir John C hardin Perfia, one Chirnney and a (portico. Ac the Entrance into this Court upon the left hand, there's one of thefe deep Cellars, and upon the right hand an Aviary. It is a place defign'd for Reciea= tion. For it is moreover encompafs'd with a Canall of clear water, that runs out of one Fountain at the Entrance, and empties it felf into another at the end. Ten Difticks in Let. tcrs of Gold, over the Top of the Portal, compofe the Infcrip. tion of this Maujoleum ; of which the Trandation is as follows.

It was calj'd theHoufe of Gold; becaufe there was nothing but Gold chat glifter'd in every part of it. I (hall give you the Defcription of it in ano. ther place. It may be eafily conjedur'd that it was a fumptu- ous and coftly Piece, as well by the Price that it coft, as by the number of Camels which were requir'd to carry it that were in all 280. The Antechamber was made ofVelvet with a Ground of Gold. Of which the Cornift was embellifti'd with Verfes that concluded in this manner, what time the Throne ef this Second Salomon I will tell thee, Behold the Throne of the Second Salomon ; where the Letters of the laft words being takn for Ciphers make 1057. Years, which is look'd upon as meet Gibbrifh in our Lan guage, but among the Orientals pafles for Wit and Ornament. The fecond Court is not fo beautiful as the firft ; but the third is nothing inferiour to it. It is furrounded with Apart ments, every one containing two Stories, a Terrafs, a and a Canal, in like manner as the former. Four large Trees ftand at each Corner, and cover it with their Boughs. Out of this third Court you enter into the fourth, by a Marble Afcenc confifting of twelve Steps. The Portal which is at the Top, is a moft magnificent Piece. It is cover'd below with white Marble, tranfparent like to Porphiry or Aggar. The top of it which is a large half Duo mo is painted with Morefco Work of Or and Azure laid on very thick. In this four h Court are alfo Chambers both at the lower end, and on both fides,with Terrafles and 'Porf/coV,like the otherthree.Thofe are the Lodg ings for the Priefts, the Governors and Students,that live upon the Revenues of that facred Place. Fronting thefe Courts ftands the Body of the Strudure, confifting of three great Chappels upon a Line. To the mid= dlemoft belongs an Entrance eighteen Foot deep, every way magnificent, the Portal being of the fame white Marble alreaÂ» dy mention'd. The Top, which is alfo a large half is overpaid without, with large fcjuare Tiles of Cheney, painted with Morefco Work, and within embellifli'd with Gold and Azure. The Door which is twelve foot high, and fix broad, is all of tranfparent Marble. The folding Doors are plated with Silver,embellifh'd with Vermillion guilt,carv'd Work and polifhd, which make a Mofaic altogether coftly and full of Curiofity. The Chappel is Oftogonal, cover'd with a high Duomo ; the lower part of which Chappel is cover'd with \ ' ' ' ^394 The Travels of Sir John Ch ardin tnto mna, way'd and painted with Flowers in Gold and Colours, fo lively and full of Luftre that they dazle the Eye. The upper part is of Morejco Work, |o/lively 3 nd p litter tng'Gold and Azure,and the Bottom of the Duomois all of the fame. This Vuomo is very large and wondertully beautiful, being overlaid without like the Portal. From the top of all arifes a Spire, with a Cvefcent fixt at the top, the ends of which are reverfe, as you fee in the Figure. This nacle which is of a remarkable Bignefs, is comolsd ot le. veral Bowls of feveral Proportions, fet one upon another,and appears as you ftand below to be about twenty loot high with the Crefcent, the whole of fine Gold. The Perfians afhrm it to be all Maflywhich if it be true, the Pinacle is worth Millions i but let it be what it will, 'tis a noble Ornament, or which the Value cannot but amount to a large Summ. In the midft of that Chappel ftands the Tomb of the Daughter of Moufu Cafent, one of the twelve which the Perfians believe to have been the lawful SucceUors of hornet, after the Death of Jit his Son in-Law. It contains eight feet in length, five in bredth, and fix in height. Overpaid with Tiles of China, painted alam and over-fpread with Cloth of Gold that hangs down to the ground on every fide. It is endos'd with a Grate of Malfy Silver, ten foot high, di- ftant half a foot from the Tomb; and at each Corner crown d as it were with large Apples of fine Gold. Which is done to the end the People fhould not fully the Tomb with their kif- fina and handling it; for the Tomb is lookt upon as a facred Piece. Several breadths of Velvet hung about the infideofthe Grate,hide it from the view of the People: fo that only Favot or Money can procure a fight of it. The Floocr likewile is cover'd with a Carpet of very fine Woollen : over which at great Feftival Times,are fpread others of Silk and Gold. Over the Tomb,about ten foot in height,hang feveral Silver Veflels which they call Candil ; being a fort of Lamp , of which there are fome that weigh fixty Marks : and areotherwile fa- fhion'd then the Church Branches, as may be feen in the Fi gures. But they never light up any fire therein, which they are not made to hold, nor any fort of Licjuor, as not having any Bottom. . Upon the Grate hang feveral Infcriptions in Letters ot Gold upon thick Velloms, as large as a large fheet of Paper. Which Infcriptions contain the Elegies of the Saint and her Family. The Infciipcion upon the Front of the Entrance contains thethrough the Black-Sea^ and 0/Colchis. the Prayer which they all generally fay, that come in the Pilgrimage to the Sepulcher. The Pilgrim, when he enters, kiffes the Threfliold and the Grate three times; and (landing upright with his Face towards the Tomb, one of the Mollas, that attend there day and night, comes to him, who caufes him to fay the Prayer word for word. After the Prayer fofaid, the Pilgrim again kifles the Grate, and the foot of the Door; then giving the Prieft four or five pence, more or lefs,according to his ability, he retires. If he defires a Cer tificate of his Pilgrimage, they write him one in due form; the difpatch of which cofts him half a Piftole,or eight or nine fhillings. All the money which the Pilgrims and other Vo taries give, is put into a little iron Cheft, like the Trunk of a Tree, that ftands at the entrance into the Chappel, which is open'd every Friday, and what is found therein is diftribuÂ» ted among the people that belong to the and do Duty in that confecrated place. Ic would be too long, and perhaps to irkfome, to infert all the Infcriptions I have mention'd : and therefore I fliall only give you the Tranfla* tion of the two Principal Prayers, which the Pilgrims are bound to fay.

They are of an equal Diameter, both the one and the other, at the end of a Gallery twelve foot broad and thirty five in length. At the entrance there is alfo a kind of Ve= ftry,were the Ornaments and Moveables are kept. The Chap- pel, where Abas lies enterr'djis an irregular Twelve-Angle : the other where Sephi is buried, is an irregular Square. The Veftries, Galleries and Chappels are hung with richTape- ftries: thofe wherewith the Chappels are bung, are of Gold and Silk woven together. And indeed there can be feen no thing more beautiful, nor more magnificent then thefe /oleums. The lower part is over-laid with large Tiles of Porphiry , painted with Gold and Azure : the Roofs are a moft ingenious and delicate Piece of Architedure, all pain= ted with rich Morefco Work in lively Colours, that even da- zk the Eye. For the Gold and Azure is laid on fo thick, that you would fwear it was all Maffy in its Subftance. The â– Domo opens toward the lower part, with a double row of four and twenty Windows â€¢ and there is one very large one equal with the Ground, that looks into the Garden, with another oppofite to it, which looks into the great Chappel. The Glafing Work confifts of Panes of Chryftal,painted with Gold and Azure, and faften'd in mafly Silver. But I remit the Reader to the Draughts, to take a more perfe&lt;Â£i view of thefe fumptuous Monuments, contenting my felf to relate what they cannot exprefs.

The Counter^poynts are tack'd below to the Carpets under foot,with a fmall Silk ftring.thar runs through Rings of malTy Gold. And the Clafps and Hooks at the Corners are of the fame Metal. Round the Gallery of Ahat's Tomb, runs a Fri^e, divi ded equally into Cartridges of Azure, wherein are written in large Charaders of Gold, the Elegies of the Famous, h the Great Saint and Idol of the Perfians, made by the Learned Hafan-Ca^a. Of which I flwll inlert the Tranfla- tion as being a Piece of Eloquence, wherein may be fecn not only the Genius of the Perfian Poetry, but the Tranfports of Mahumetan Devotion.

The Tomb of Sephy, like that of is covei'd with a Pall of the rich Tyflue of Terjia, the richeft that is made in any part of the world ; and another over it of fine Scarlet, with a Gold Fringe round about.

The Le&amp;erns, or Desks, which are over-againft it, and are made to fold one upon aÂ» nother are of all fweet Wood:near to which in feveral Niches are a great number of Books of the Law, put up in Bags of Tillue. So that a man can hardly fee any thing more Beautiful and Magnificent. There is fuch a Neatnefs and Gravity mixt together with Pomp and Riches, that 1 never faw any thing in Per/ia that better pleafed me. All the Veflels that belong to theChappelsareofGoldand Silver. It confifts in large Flambeau Branches of four and five hundred Ounces apiece in flat Difhes, wherein they ferve the Poor with Victuals; in Pots tofpit in, in Chafing=Difhes, FireÂ»fhovels and perfuming Pans, and in Boxes for Greale and fweet Odors. But they never make ufe of the Gold Plate, unlefs it be upon Feftivals. In the Evening they light up le&lt;= veral Flambeaus in the Tombs and Galleries, that burn till daylight; which is alfo done in the middlemoft Chappel,and at the Entrance. They alfo light up two very large ones, which they let up upon fbmany Stands. And eight Priefts are paid and entertain'd,to read the Alcoran by turns day and night. Twelve more likewife perform the lame Duty in Sephy s Tomb, and twenty five more in the Monument of Abas. Behind the Chappels, and upon each fide, are very neat Gardens, with Apartments very well furnifh'd and kept in good Repair, with little Gardens belonging to every one,exÂ» tremely pleafant and delightful: upon the left hand is a large Church-Yard,fifteen hundred Paces fquare. In which Church- Yard they bring Bodies to be bury'd from all parts of ^erfta 5 where it is in great Requeft,and every where lookt upon to be Sacred Ground. On the right fide of the Stru(5hire,there is nothing but a high Brick Wall, very broad and very thick â– through the Black-Sea, and 0/Colchis. 409 and ferves for a Damm againft the Inundations of the River ot Cnm, thac runs at the foot of it. The Perfians call this famous place Mdjfouma^hu is, Innocent or 'Pure, by reafon of the pretended Saint that lies there enterr'd, and to whom they like wife give the fame Epithet. For this word Majfouma in the Perfian Theology, fignifies a Perfoti that has acquir'd a Sanctity fo habitual as never to fin more. There belongs to it a Revenue of three Thoufand four Hun dred Tomans, which make eleven Thoufand Pounds Ster ling , that is to fay, fifteen Hundred Tomans for Abas's Tomb, a Thoufand for Sephys, and feven hundred for This Revenue is employ'd to keep the Places clean and neat, to repair the Decays of time, in the Building and Moveables, for the buying or Lights,and maintaining feveral Churchmen, and a great number of Regents and Governors, of Students and poor People. They diftribute Viftuals every day to all that come, and to people that are hir'd. And of all thefe Le gacies and Revenues, three Great Lords of have the Superintendency; every one being appointed his Chappel. He that at prefent takes Care of the fhe&gt;Saints Chappel, is an illuftrious Ancient Perfon, who has been or Collonel of the Courtches,which is a great Body of the confifting of thirty Thoufand Men. And the lame Perfbn is alfo Governor of Com. This City contains alio feveral other Edifices,very beauti ful and fumptuous. It is a very pleafant Place, but for the Heat which is very exceflive. In the Summer the River that pafles by it is no bigger then a fin all Rivulet, but the Winter Thaws fwell it to that degree with the Water that falls from the Mountains, that it not only fills its own Channel,which is as broad as the Seine at 'Paris, but overflows a great part of the City, They call it generally the River of ; but the true Name of it is Jouhad-gan, This City lies in 85. deg. 48. min. of Longitude, and 34.deg. 30. min. of Latitude. The Air is wholfom, but extremely hot,as I faid before : for it fcalds in the Summer, there being no place in all Terfia where the Sun fcorches more violently. It abounds in all manner of Victuals and Fruits, particularly in 'Pi/iachios. The people alfo are very courteous and civil. The moft part of Topographers will have to be the fame place which Ttolomy calls Gauna, or And his Tranflator aflerts it to be the fame with Choama, the others will have it to be Jrbafte, or Hecatompyk. Several Hiftories of ^ Vi ' :410 The Travels of Sir John Chardin into Peril a, of ferfta likewife relate this City to be very Ancient; and that it was built by TahttiMyWhenthe Sun entred into j that it was twelve thoufand Cubits in compafs, and as big as Babylon. I muft confefs there is no doubt but it was very large ; for there are many Ruins and Footfteps of Habitations to be feen round about it : but it is much to be queftion'd whether it were fo Ancient as the Reign of Tahmas. Other Perlian Hiftories deduce its Original from the firft Age of MaÂ« humetifm; and affirm that in the time of there were in that place feven large Villages, and that in the 83 Year of the Hegyra,Ahdcilla Saydon, Cdiff coming into that Country with an Army, joyn'd thofe feven Villages together with new Buildings, enclos'd 'em with a Wall, and made 'em one Ci ty ; and that afterwards this City encreas'd to that degree, that it became twice as large as For Moufa the Son of that Abdalla came from to and brought with him the Opinions of Haly, which they call the Religion of Shia or Imamifm : which was always profefs'd in that place even to Martyrdom, nor would the People fuffer any other and therefore Temur-leng being of a contrary Belief, utterly deftroy'd the City. Neverthelefs by degrees they repair'd one part of it againjbut it did not begin to reflourifli until this laft Age, and fince that Sephy was there interr'd. Abas the Second, his Son and Succelfor, banifh'd thither fuch Perfons as were fallen from his Favour, to the end they might pray to God for his perfbn,and give thanks to heaven for their Lives which he had fpar'd 'em. Soliman at prefent reigning had made ufe of it, to the fame purpofe,fending thither all thofe whom he thought convenient topunifli with Exile,- and the great nun&gt; ber of exil'd perfons of Quality it was, that has reftor'd the City to that Splendor wherein now it ftands. In the Year 1634. an Inundation of Waters ruin'd a thoufand Houfes: and it is but three Years fince,that an Accident of the fame nature had like to have ruin'd it all together. For two thou* land Houfes, and all the Ancient Houfes were laid level with the Earth. The Name is pronoune'd with a double wi, as if we (hould Write the word B^omm. It is alfo call'd din, that is to fay, 7he Habitation The GoÂ» vernor bears the Title of Darogue or Mayor. The 15. we ftaid at Comm to reft our Horfes, and departed the 16. at fix a Clock in the Evening. We traveli d four Leagues over delightful Plains as level as could be, fertile,and well ftor d with Villages; and yet the Soyl of appear'd tothrough the Black-Sea ^ and t Colchis. 411 to be fomwhat dry. We found the people every wherejWere treading the Corn, the Harveft being already reap'd. We lodg'd at Cajfern--ahad y a Town confifting of about three hunÂ» dred Houfes, belonging to the Queen Mother , as her Dowry. The 17. we travell'd five Leagues crofs the Plain. We found it all the way cover'd with a moving Sand, dry, with out either Villages or Water, We lodg'd in a place call'd Ahjhirin, or Sweet Water, becaufe there is in that place a FounÂ» tain of fair Water and Cifterns in the midft qf fix Care'van* ferats. The 18. our Journey reach'd to Caftan, where we arriv'd, after we had travell'd feven Leagues,fleering toward the Souths over the Plain already mention'd : and at the end of two Leagues , we found the Soyl delightful and fertile, ftor'd with large Villages. We pafs'd through feveral, and about half the way left upon the left hand, at a near diftance, a litÂ» tie City call'd Sarou, feated at the foot of a Mountain. The City of Cajhan is feated in a large Plain, near a high Mountain. It is a League in length, and a quarter of a League in breadth j extending it felf in length from Eaft to Weft. When you fee it afar off, it refembles a half Moon, the Cor* nets of which look toward both thofe Parts of the Heavens. The Draught is no true Reprefentation, either of the Bignefs or the Figure ; as having been taken without a true Profpeft. And the reafon was the Indifpofition of my Painter, who be ing extremely tir'd with the former days Travel, was not a= ble to ftir out of the Inn, where we lay. All that he could do was to get upon the Terrafs, and take the Draught from thence. There is no River that runs by theCity,only feveral Canals convey'd under Ground, with many deep Springs and Cifterns as there are at Com. It is encompafs'd with a double Wall, flank'd with round Towers, after the Ahcieht Fafliion; to which there belong five Gates. One to the Eaft, calld the ipyal Gate ; as being near the Royal Palace,that ftands with, out the Wails. Another call'd the â– &gt; becaule it leads diredly to a great Village, which bears that name. Another between the Weft and North, call'd the Gate Houfe Melic ;as being near to a Garden of Pleafure, which was plan ted by a Lord of that Name. The two other Gates are op- pofite to the South-Eaft, and North-Eaft. The one call d Com Gate, and the othct Jfpahan Gate-M caufe they lead to Xxxx tholeThe travels of Sir John Chardin into Perfia, thofe Cities, The City and the Suburbs,which are more beauti. ful thea theCity, contain fix thoufand five hundred Houfes, as the People aflure us; forty Mofcjues, three Colleges, and about two hundred Sepulchres of the Defcendants of Aiy. The Principal Mofque ftands right againft the great Market Place, having one Tower, that ferves for a Steeple, built of Free Stone. Both the Mofque and the Tower are the Remainders of the Splendour of the firft Mahumetans, who invaded 'Perfia. The Houles of Cajhan arc built of Earth and Bricks, of which there few that are remarkable. But the Bazars and Baths are lovely Struftures^ell built and well kept. There are alfo feveral Inns. That which is call'd the with= out the City, joyning to the Gace that looks toward theEaft, is the faireft not only in Cajhan , but in all It is four fquare,every front within-fide being two hundred Geometri cal Paces, and two Stories with an Anti-Chamber, or HollowÂ» nefs below that runs albalong the length ofche two Fronts,rais'd about the height of a man above the Court, and four Inches below the level of the Chamber. It is eight foot deep^av'd with white Marble, almoft as tranfparent as Pophiry. The Stories on the fides contain fifteen Chambers of the fame Fi gure ; the two others had but ten, with a large one in the middle,- having five Chambers. The other Apartments conÂ» filled of one Chamber,fifteen foot long and ten broad, high and vaulted, with a Chimney in the middle, and a fquare tico before,ten foot wide,cover'd with a half Duomo, with a Contrivance for a Chimney on each fide; which was for the Servants to lodge in. The fecond Story was contriv'd like that below, with a Balufter four foot high, that lec in the the Light,and ran round the Structure. In the Geometrical Part of the Draught, you may perceive a Hexagonal in the midft of the Entrance, every Front of which is a large Shop, where are to be fold all manner of Belly'Timber, Wood and Forrage. The Entrance is under a high and magnificent PorÂ» tal, adorn'd with Mofaic Work, like all the reft of the BuildÂ» ding ; and upon the fides runs a where you may lie in the day time as conveniently and as pleafantly, as in the Inn it felf.

Near adjoyning to it ftands the Palace Royal â€¢ and over againft it , another defign'd for the Lodging of Embaffadors.

Which excream Heat is occafion'd by its Situation ; as lying near a high Mountain oppos'd to the South. The Reverberation of which fo furioufly heats the piace in the Dog=Days, that it fcalds again. Befides,there is one greater Inconvenience more troublefome and more dangerous, which is the greac number of Scorpions that infeft thofe parts at all times, efpe- cially when the Sun is in Scorpio : Travellers are terribly threat- ned by em : And yet for my part, (thanks be to God) I ne ver faw any in all the time that I pafs'd through the Country, Neither could I hear of any great Mifchief that they had done. Ic is faid,that Jhas the Great's Aftrologers in the Year 1623, invented a Taltfman to deliver the City from thofe Vermin; fince^, 4. the travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, ' fince which time there has not appeard fo many as before. But there is no Credit to be given to thefe idle ftones; no more then to that fame other, that if Travellers flopping ac GÂ« {han, are but careful at their entrance into their Inns, to fpeak thefe words, Scorpions, lama no Scorpion will come near em. For thefe are meet Tales. However certain it is,that their fting is very dangerous : And therefore it has given occafion to an Imprecation frequent, ly in the Mouths of the Perfians, SMay fling thy Colls. However there is no Body, but has by him fe- veral foveraign Remedies againft the fting of this Creature. This City lies in 35. deg. 35. min. of Lat. and 86. deg. of Longitude. Cartel and wild Fowl are not very plentiful in thofe parts; but it abounds in Corn and Fruits. They car ry from thence to Ifpahan, the firft Melons and Water MeÂ» Ions which are eaten in that City ; which they furnifli with vaft numbers,as long as the feafon for Fruit endures. Several European Authors hold to be fame place, which the Ancient Greek Authors call or elle that which was calld Cteftphon of Country of the farthians.Thz Perfian Hiftoriansaver,that it owes its Reftauration to Zehd--le- ca-ton the Wife of Haron-&lt;%efhid ,Cz\\ff of Bagdat.

The People enrag'd that they had WOrfliipped for a whole Age together a Place in their Opinion more worthy of ExeÂ» elation,ran in a heat to pull down the Monument, dug down the Earth that was at the top i and round about it, and made a common road over it. But what happen'd af* terwards is much more Remarkable. And that is this that one ofthe great ferfianDoftors Undertook to write a Treatife on purpofCjthat there Was never any fuch perlon as Tu^hec buri* ed there. Upon which the People again oifended to fee themfelves made the fport of their Dodors fancies, have left the place as indifferent, and will neither pollute, nor give it Reverence. The Governor of carries the Title of a DaroÂ£ue,zs do all the other Governors of the Gity's of Tar- thia. A Lord that was one of my good Friends, call'd stan--hic , Brother to fev^ral Governors Provinces had the Government of that City, the firft time that I pafs'd through it. The two years of his Government being ended, the Ci y was To well fatisfi'd in his condudl, that they fent fbme of their Members to petition that he might be continu'd two years longer, but their Petition Was rejeded, as being con trary to cuftorn to continue fuch Officers longer then the ufual time. ' The 19. our Horfts were fo tir'd that We were fore'd to ftay at Cajhan. We departed the 2p. and travell'd feven Leagues; the two firft cro(s the Plain where the City was built: the reft over a Mountain which was of a good height, but not difficult to afcend. At the top we met with a very large and fair CardVanferay, and a little further with a wide Lake^hich ferves for aReceptacle to receive the meltedSnow and Rain that falls from the Parts thereabouts ; from whence they let go the water into the Plain ot as they have need. Y y y y41^ The Travels of Sir John Chardin tnto ^ the Great, rais'd up two ftrong Dams about ic, to the end it might hold more Water; and to prevent the Wa ter from wafting. He alfo caus d (everal Caufeys to be made in the fame place for the Convenience of Travellers. Be ing defcended from the Mountain, you enter into a deep Val ley , very narrow and about a League in length : all which fpace of Ground is ftor'd with Houfes , Vine* yards, and Gardens lo clofe one to another, that it feeins to be' but one Village of a League in length. Several de lightful and clean Streams derive their Springs from that Plain, which preferve the Air wonderfully cool all the Summer; fo that it is a place the mod: charming and delightful that a man fhall meet with in that fcorching Climate. For the Sun has fo little Power there, that the Rofes were not then blown ; the Corn and Fruit were alfo then green and but half ripe; and yet they had reapd their Harveft,and had eaten ripe Fruit a Cafbun at month before. We locig d at the end of that lovely Plain, in a there built, which they call'd Carou. Some of our own modern Authors aflert,That this Valley was the Place where Darius was murder'd, which is not im. probable, for that the Hiftory obferves,that Bejfus and Na- barzams, after they had committed that Treacherous Murder upon the Prince, took feveral Roads, the one for and the other for Battriam ; and Cafwi is exadly the Place that leads direflly to thofe two Provinces. The n,wetravell'd eight Leagues; two along the foot of the Mountains between which that Valley lies; and fix in ,a pleafant Vale, ftor'd with a great number of Villages; where we met with feveral upon the Road ; we alighted atone that was larger and fairer then the reft, call'd Jga-I\emal, from the name of a rich Merchant that bpilt it, and feveral other publick Struftures about The ii.our Journeys was not above five Leagues in the fame Plain, where Aga-Kgmal ftands. We travell'd fb hard, that by nine a Clock at night we arriv'd at which is a large Village confifting of about five hundred Houfes, where there are feveral Inns and Gardens, and great plenty of Water, The i],we fet forward late, to the end we might not come to Ifpahan before day.

In a word , they had great reafon to promife themfelves, that he would have rendred both the one and the other Diuturnal as well as Univerlal, in regard his Heroic Vertues had Crowned him with Vidory before he had arrived to the Age of nineteen Years, by the Conqueft of the City and whole Province of lbordering upon the utmoft Confines of the whole Kingdom; and that too, from an Enemy no lefs Powerful than the Monarch ; and atcer- wards when he defended it againft the whole Force of the fame Prince, Muftered together in one Body to regain it.

The fame tranfcendent Virtues in a Breft fo truly Royal, even at the very time that Death lurprized him, fpur d him on to ex tend his Dominions towards the North and Eaft. And the Preparations which he had made for that purpoie, gave the whole World occafion to fear that his Defign would infallibly fucceed. The Chriftians, who had the happineis to live under his Subjection, to this day lament in private his Deceale, not only as a Kin^, but as a Parent. For his Juftice and his Good- Aaaaa â–  nek oThe Coronatio nefs would never fuffer any violence to be offered them, or that they fliould be difturbed for their Religion, which they had free Liberty to exercife during his Reign, as being a Perfon in whom thole Royal Virtues were ftedraft and unalterable: which always prevented the Fury of the Cruel and Impious Mahometans frommolefting the Peace and Tranquillity of their Lives or Eftates. And hence it is that Strangers ftill and ever will bewail his lofs and bear in Remembrance his more than ordi nary Endowments ; as He that by by his Affability and Libera lity invited them continually to his Court and Cities under his Obedience, and employed a great part of the Tribute which he drew from his Subjedls in the purchafe of their coftly Mer- chandife which they brought along with them, paying both generoufly and pundually what they in reafon demanded. Toward the Conclufion of that account which we have given of the Life of this Great Prince, we have fhewn that the caufe of his Death was that fame naufeous Diftemper which good Manners will not permit to be named,and of which the Pollution is yet more unfeemly; and which notwithftanding all the En deavours of Art to conceal it, difplays it felf in the Faces of the Difeafed, and publifhes with Ignominy their frequent Con- verfe with lewd Women: We have alfo told you that his Death happened in one of his Houfes of Pleafure feated in the Province of Teher EJloon, two Leagues from according to the Perfian Geographers lying in 7 8.Degree*,and 15. of Longi tude, and 57. degrees, 10. Minute of twelve days Journey from the Capital City of the Empire, and nine days Journey from the Cafpian Sea : And this houfe of Pleafure inviting feveral of the Country People to fettle round about it, was the Reafbn that at length it grew to be a confiderable Village, to which the 'Perjians gave the Name of Cofroe-Jhaad, or the Habitation of Cojroes, who was a Prince, formerly Governouf of the Province where this Village is fituated; and the fame that built this Palace of Pleafure, in the Reign of Sef the firft. Grand father to the prefent King. But not long after this falling into Difgrace, the King confifcated his Houfe and all his Eftate after he had put the Governour himfelf to Death, of which I ftiall fayno more at prefent, as being a Subject not proper for this Place. We have alfo in the fame Relation fet down the Time of this Prince's unfortunate Deceafe, which happened upon the 26. of the Moon which they call (ftabeia 1077. or ac cording to the Chriftian Account, upon the 25. 1666lyman III. King Perfia. \666. abouc four a clock in the Morning, at what time the firft glimpfe of Daylight-Dawn began to appear, Eternal darknels clofing the Eyes of that Great Monarch at the very Moment that Day began to give Light to his Subjects in their feveral Callings. We have alfo farther related, how that an Hour before, the Principal Eunuchs obferving in the Prince's Eyes the Signs of Approaching Death, thought it fit to put out of the Room all the Women that were with him, for fear left at the moment of his laft Gafp, the Tranlports of their Grief, and their loud Outcries, might difcover a Secret, which it was lb neceflary at that time to conceal. To that purpofe they perfwaded them that the King was afleep, and defired them therefore to retire for fear of difturbing his Repofe. This had been prudently done, if the perfons that Teemed to be fo wife, had had lufficient Re- folution and Courage themlelves. But at the Fatal Moment they could not themfelves forbear to caft forth thole loud fighs, which betrayed the Truth to the Ladies, fo that they had pre- fently alarm'd the whole Camp with their Piercing Cries and Lamentations, had not the Eunuchs belought them to forbear but for a while, at a time when the welfare of the Empire lay at Stake. To which the dilconfolate Princelfes fubmittedas much as the Importunity of their Giief would give them leave. And here we are to obferve by the way, that the Reafon why the Women upon fuch occafions are lb deeply afflided, is not only for the lofs of the King their Husband, but for the lofs of that fhadow of Liberty which they enjoyed during his Life. For no fooner is the Prince laid in his Tomb, but they are all fiiut up in particular Houfes, pleafant enough tis true for their Situation, and where they want for nothing,but what is all in all to them, theironlyhappinels in this World, Converiation with Men. Which is a Satisfadion fo feverely debarred them, that they are not allowed lb much as the fight of a Man. The Eunuchs therefore having confulted among themlelves, in the midft of their fears left the Croud of over-hafty Vifi- tants preffing in at unfealbnable hours, fhonld awaken fulpicious Curiofity, relblved to flay till the Sun was up, and then to give Notice of the Kings Death to the two Chief Mmijlers oi State, who were two Illuftrious Perfonages, that had had the Manage ment of Affairs under the decealed King, with an Authority almoft equal to his own. To which purpofe they deputed two of their Society, the Mehter, whole Oifice in the fcrjwi Court anfwers to that of our High-Chamber lain, according to the mean-ins of the Jrabian word, which fignifies the H'tgheft. The other deputed Eunuch was called the Aga-Kafour, a Perfon already well in years, and the chiefeft of thofe that had the Cuftody of the Kings Treafury ; as to whom the Prince had more par ticularly entrufted all his Jewels. Thefe two came to the chief Minifters Lodgings, as if they had been fent by his Majefty, caufed them to put forth all the Women out of the Room, and then informed them of the Death of Hahas the Second, giving them an exact and punctual Ac count ; which was. That the day before, toward the Evening, after thofe Minifters were retired from the Kings Prefence, the Prince had eaten heartily certain Sweet-Meats which his Wives had provided ,â€¢ after which he feemed to be much better than he had been for fome time before, till about Nine of the Clock at Ni^ht; at what time of a fudden he fell into a Swoon, where upon they ran to him and laid him upon his Bed : That about Eleven of the Clock he came again to himfelf, not without fome difturbance of his Senfes. That after that his Pains augmented, not having received any Benefit from two Medicins that he had taken by the Diredion of his Phyficians: That about Two of the Clock in the Morning the Violence of his Diftemper flackned but returning about Three, put him into a that lafted about half an Hour: but the next half hour he took fome Reft. But toward four in the Morning, his Eyes then faintly rolling in his Head, gave evident figns of Deaths Approach : fo that at the fame inftant he expired without any other Motion, that they could fay, they perceived him die. Nor indeed had he tefti- fied during the whole Courfe of his Sicknefs that he had the leaft Apprehenfion or Fear of Death : Infomuch that he had left no Orders either as to the Difpolal of his Body, nor as touching his Family nor Succeffor, only in the height of his laft Fit, turn ing his Head toward the Publick Apartment, he utter'd with fbme kind of Fury thele words ; me, hut you Jhalldrink a good J 'Poyfon ; behind me a Son who after my Death This News did not a little furprife the two Minifters, who did not believe the Kings Sicknels had been fo mortal, or at leaft that it would have killed him fo foon: and they had juft reafon, both, to bewail their lofs ; but the fecond difplayed more vifible figns of his Grief,as lofing infinitely much more than his Companion. For Habas, obferving a Piece of Policy not ufual among the tperjms,refolved to counter-balance the Power of his Primelyman lit /\/Â«Â£ Perfia. Mtmfter, believing it would be of advantage to the Government that Emulation fhould render his Minifters more* intent upon their Duty : Which was the reafon that he advanced this fe- cond Perfon to that Degree,that he was nothing inferior in Autho rity to the firft, and put into his Hands the moft important Af fairs of the Kingdom. It was very probable that HaSuccelfor, would not be ' of his Fathers judgment, but that all things would return to their firft Method. Which moft fenfibly touched the fecond Mi- nifter, who faw himfelf tumbling into a more Private Condition j and that there was no higher Employment to be expected for him, unlefs it were the Superintendency of the Kings Houflhold; which was nothing comparable to theprefent Offices which enjoyed. So that he could not forbear at firft from manifefting the Excefs of his Grief, but the 'Per/tan Lords being accuftomed to diffemble, he loon compofed his Countenance and modera ted his Sorrows. Which having done, he told the Eunuch, that the Grandees of the Empire fliould be privately called together, and that he would forthwith appoint both Time and Place for their Meeting, which was the Anfwer alio of the firft Minifter to the High Chamberlain. In the mean time the two chief Phyficians Mr^a-Sahid and Mrza-!\oudchek his Brother, confiderable Lords in the Court (for in the Eaftern Countries Phyficians are much more highly efteemed and advanced than in ) thefe Lords, I fay, coming to the Door of the Royal Apartment for the Women, prefently after the two great Eunuchs were gone, there had notice of the Kings Death, and confequently of their own Ruin. For that according to the Cuftom of that Empire, the Life of the two chief Phyficians , or at leaft their Fortune and Eftates depend upon the Life of the Prince whom they attended in his Sicknefs. For the fame Week that the King died, they are exiled to lome remote and prefixed Place, whither they are not fuffered to carry any more of their Eftates along with them than will fuffice for a bare Maintenance; the reft is Confilcated. Which was alio their lot, as Aral I be laid in due place. But neither the lols of their Mafter, nor of their Liberty had fo difordered their judgments, as to hinder them from confulting their own prelervation at liich a ticklifh Conjuncture. Only one thing difturbed them more than all the reft, and that was the Report of the Kings laft words, when he complained of be ing Poyfoned. For there was enough in thole words to condemn themThe Coronatio ^ fucceeding Prince ftould give credit to thofe laft Speeches of a Dying Monarch. To rid themfelves therefore from thefe Fears, they relolved between themfelves, to throw the Election upon the Youngeftof all Hahas's Sons, who being as yet but an Infant, would mall likelihood continue a long time under the Tuition oi his Mother, and his Minifters, from whom they could not exped to fuffer any thing that was Fatal or Dreadful. ., f . . . . And here we muftobferve that Habas the lecond lert behind him two Sons; or at leaft I never heard that he left any more.Nor is it known whether he left any Daughters or no. For what is done in the Womens Apartment is a Myftery concealed even from the Grandees and Prime Minifters. Or if they know any thing, it is meerly upon the account of fome particular Re lation or dependence which the Secret has to iome peculiar Af fair which of neceffity muft be imparted to their Knowledg. For my part I have fpared neither for pains nor coft to fift out the Truth: But I could never difcover any more, only that they believed he never left any Daughter behind him that lived. A man may walk a Hundred days one after another by the Houfe where the Women are,and yet know no more what is done there, than at the farther end oiTartary. _ Now of thefe two Sons of H the Eldeft who was called Sofie-Mr^a,\ms then entring into his one and twentieth Year; be ing Born in the year of the Egire, 1057. for the {uperftition of the (Per[tans will not let us know the Month or the Day. Their Addiction to Aftrology is fuch that they carefully conceal the Moments of their Prince's Birth, to prevent the Calling their Nativities, where they might meet perhaps with fomething which they fliould be unwilling to know. His Father begot him at Eighteen years of Age enamoured of a Slave, or Cherkes, in the Verftan Language j whole extraordinary Beauty and rare Endowments fo won the Affection of that Monarch that flie was the firft of all his Women that he chole for a Wife; For which reafon during her Husbands Life flie w^as called TSlekdctt i^anuniy or the Lawful Dutchefs; tho there were alfo other Wo men, which were his Lawful Wives according to the Law and Cuftom of that Country. This Eldeft Son 5 according to Cuftom was bred up in the Womens Palace, and committed to the Care of certain Eunuchs under the Eye of his Mother and his Nurfe. who was a Lady of great Quality, and the Wife of Mluflaujie-Elmematekj which according to the force of the words, fignifies a WatcherS olyman III. Periia. over Kingdoms. There he was bred up with all the Tendernefs and Pomp, that h,s High Birth required, and enjoyed all the Liberty that could be allowed to a Perfon of his Quality â€¢ which was to go up and down over all that fpacious Palace where he pleaied himfelf: for to go further into the Mens Apart ments is by no means permitted thofe young Princes When he arrived at the Age of feventeen Years, an Accident betel him that rendered his Confinement much more clofe For it happened that an Eunuch brought him fome Peices of Cloth or Tiuue, at what time the Prince being of a haughty Temper, and not thinking them Rich enough, rejeded them with very fcornful and flighting Language: nor was he better pleafed when it was told him that the Peices were fent him by the Order of the King his Father. Which being carried back and perhaps aggravated to the jealous Monarch 5 his Majefty believing that the overmuch Liberty which was allowed the young Prince did but icrve to heighten his Arrogance and aug ment his natural Pride, confined him to the remoteft Part of all the Palace. Some perfons were of opinion that he would have caufed his Eyes to have been put out. But when they found that the Walls of the Place to which he was confined were ordered to be raifed, the more Intelligent Sort believed that the King would not pro ceed to that Extremity of Rigour; for that he would not have been fo careful to prevent the Eicape ofone that was Blind,whole Misfortune would have been fufficient to render him incapable to attempt any Enterprize of that nature. However when the King was fetting forward for Ma^endaran in the year 1665. according to our Computation, his Actions were fuch, that even the Grandees and moft Politick Courti ers began to fufpeft that he had then determined the Dreadful Execution. For he was not gone above Eight Leagues from Jfpahan , when he turned back again of a fudden toward the City with a very fmall Retinue, without imparting his Defign to any one of all his Favourites : but when he arrived, all that he did was to enter unexpected into the Womens Apartment, where after he had ftaid about two hours, he came forth again very Penfive and Melancholy. Of which the Courtiers not being able fo Gonje&lt;5ture any other apparent Caufe, attributed it to Ibme Fatal Refolution which the King had taken againft; the Prince his Son.Tho as it appeared after wards they were all deceived in their jndgments,and that there was another Motive that put him upon this fwift and fudden return. ForThe Coronatio 'p^,. as to what concerned this Young Prince, his Father was fatisfied with his clofe Confinement in a Quarter of the Apartment remote from the reft, in the Company of his Mo ther and fuch Ladies as the King had appointed to attend her without ftinting her any Number : commitmg him alio to the farther care of the Great Eunuch A or the Lord, to obfervehis Aaion, and to prevent him from attempt- ''^Ist^N^rmoWially fignifiesfomeSuperintendant or General Overfeer. And therefore the Perfon laft mentioned, befides that he had the Tuition of the Prince, was Entrufted alfo with the Government of the Womens Palace, and comer-, look the Management of all Affairs of the Royal Houfliold in Jepahan, an Employment which gave him great Credit and cauled him to be refpected both in the Court and City. InWh which Places he was highly efteemed till the Death of his Mafter, be ing as it were the Lieutenant and next to the Grand Superinten dant of the Kingdom, who is likewifc ftil'd the As for the Younger Son, he was about Eight Years oi Age when his Father Died, being Bom in the year of the 069. of an Iberian Lady or Gurgi, as the call them; to whom they save the Title of Nour-NiJfa-lQmum, which Signifies word for word, Dutchefs the Light of W the Young Prince him felf being called by the Name of Ham^eh Tho l never could find or learn the true Signification of this word I muft confefs in the Terftan Language it anfwers to the word Apoftroph in our Tongue j but in that lence I do not apprehend how it can fignifie a Proper Name. Neverthelefs a Proper Name it is, whether it fignifies fomething or nothing, and that muit Asfor the Title of Mirzah, it is as much as to fay the Son of a Prince, as we have obferved in another Place, wnere we have difcovered more at large of the 'Perfan Names and Titles. This Uluftrious Infant, as I have been informed by feveral ot the Great Eunuchs, who fometimes Attended upon him while He was with his Father in the Province of Ma^endaran, where 1 was alfo a little before his Majefties Deceale, was a Prince whofe Blooming Virtues promifed fomething more than Ordi nary. For notwithftanding the tendernefs of his Corporeal Or gans,the Strength of his Soul appeared in all his Actions,difcover- ing fuch figns of Noblenefs and Generofity, as plainly prelaged that one day he would be a Glorious Prince. Now whether thefe Sienal Endowments had begot in a greaterS o i. y m a n III. Perfia. greater AfFeaion for him, than for his other Son : Or whether he werefwaidbythe moft ufual Inclinations of Nature, which generally infufe into Parents moft Tendernefs for their Younger Children, he would needs have this Younger Son of his to ac company him in his journey. Tho others believed that it Was rather to gratifie his Mother, with whofe Beauty the King was ^ extremely enamoured, fo that contrary to cuftom he made her a Partaker with him in his Royal Bed, tho two and twenty years of Age, and carried her along with him where ever he took his Progrefs. And in this laft Progrefs wherein flie accompanied the King, fhe had the latisficlion to enjoy the Company of her be loved Son, to whom the King affigned for Tutor and Guardian a Noble Eunuch, called Aga-Mubank, or the &lt;BleffedLord. Thus this Young Prince hapning to be in this Houfe of Plea- fore, or of Sorrow rather, feeing here it was that his Father ex pired, was at hand to have Received the Diadem which the Grandees of the Aflembly might have prelented him, had the Conlpiracy of the Two chief Phyficians taken effed:. Nor was it their fault that it did not. For they managed their part with all the Prudence imaginable. And perhaps they mioht have laid their Plot before the Kings Death which by the Rifles of their Art, they might eafily forefee. Not that they thought their Lives lb much in danger till they had notice of the Dying Kings laft words, but only to lerve themfelves in their Eftates and Employments. To this purpofe they went to the Prime Minifter and under pretence of Informing him of the Kings Death and the Nature of the two laft Medicins which they had preicribed him, they fell into difcourfe of more Important Affairs; and talking of the Eledtion, they put him in mind how much it concerned him and all the Grandees of the Council to take care of themfelves: that the King fome Minutes before he Died, had made loud Com plaints of being poyfbned by his chief Minifters, but that he left a Son that wolud devour their very hearts: that thefe his laft words and Complaints could not be concealed from his SuccefTour. So that if they gave the Crown to the Eldeft, who befides that he was of the Age to take the Government into his own hands, and was of a haughty and cruel Difpofition, and therefore would not ftick to make ufe of this pretence to rid himlelf of all his chief Minifters and Nobility, to render himfelf by that means more abfolute, and make room for other New Creatures of his own j more efpecially when he came to confider how unkind his Father had been to him, for the two years laft paft, which B b b b b heThe Coronation TT^ould certainly attribute to the bad CounB of his chief Fa vourites Upon this they concluded, that fince he could not chufe but fee that the Eldeft Son would never have any kindnefs for the prefent Grandees, that it would be a great piece of Im prudence, to advance him to that Dignity which would em power him to do all the Mifchief that came into his Mind ; and therefore at fuch a junfture of time their fafeft way would be to s confer the Eleftion upon the Youngeft, ; a Prince of great hopes,and from whom the Grandeur of the Verfian Em pire misht exped a long Continuance for the Future, and they at prefent have no reafonto fear the Difturbanceof afweetand calm Repofe, or thelofs of their Authority under a Prince that would not be capable of the Government in fourteen or fifteen Thefe Arguments thus delivered by the two Lords, firft to the (Prime Minifler, and then to the wrought upon the Minds of Both as effectually as they could defire. Both the One and the Other were convinced, and agreed to advance the Younger Son, in prejudice of the Eldeft. Their in fallible Ruin hovered before their Eyes if the Eldeft came to the Crown: as one that feeing himfelf from a Captive become an abfolute Sovereign, would loon be tranfported by his Youth and Pride, and the pleafure of unlimited Controul to change the Face of Affairs, and to take fuch Refolutions as Humour and Ca- pricio fliould infpire into himAnd who knows,cried they to them- lelves, how far he may attempt upon our lives But above all the Rumour of the Kings being poyfoned, was that which put them all upon the Rack ; For tho they might be all very Inno cent, yet the pretence was fo Plaufible, that the very Terror or the Accufation reprefented the continual fears of Death to their Eyes as dreadful as if they were under prefent Torment, fhould the Succeffour to the Empire give Credit to the Rumour j where as if they Elected the youngeft, they fhould ftill keep their high Stations of Honour and Dignity j have leifure and oppor tunity to advance their Families and raife Creatures of their own; Ruling all-the while almoft with an abfolute Dominion one or thegreateft Empires of the World. But now, that I may not feem to contradict my lelt by fpeaking frequently of the Kings being poyfoned , when 1 have already at the beginning ol this Difcourfe attributed his Death to another Caufe,'' I muft beg of the' Reader to make a fmall Digreffion, which I luppole will not prove unplea- fing, upon the fevcral fufpicions which his Death begotS o l y m a n III. Perfia, in the vanous minds of thoft the nature of his Difeafe. / â€ž . M | Â° 1 }, Crue ^ is then, that the moll certain caufe was that which I have already fet down, that is to fay, the Foul difeafe attended with a Cancer, which feizing the Griftle that forms the Conveyances of fmelling, preyed not only outwardly up- on the Nole, but inwardly upon the Palate,and then falling upon the U-onU flopped up the palfages of Refpiration. Butth^ywho imagined themfelves to be more quick-fighced, and to under- ttand the bottom of things much better, would flill be whifpenng the Curious in the Ear, and I my felf have been one of thole to whom it has been told for a great Secret, that leveral of the chief Officers of the outward Court, and fome of the Eunuchs alfoof the inward Court, or WomensApart- ment, had for fome time before agreed among themfelves to rid themlelves of this Great Monarch, and to that purpofe a made choice of Poyfon, as the moll fecureway, and lefs apt to be difcovered. And that which inlligated them to this evihfli Refolution, was the frantick and furious humour of atdblS â„¢ t 7 ftl11 P roduced extra vaganc and bloudy Tellimonies; which was come to that height, that IvStnT 1116 he was extreme- ly addifted, he had cut the Throat of one of his moll beautiful and legitimate Wives without any offence or other caufe given: that he had done the fame to feveral of his Domeftick Servants; r? readin ^ helike Mand untimely Ends, fulfered themfelves to be tempted into this execrable defignof giving him a Potion, that fhould wafte him by degrees, and give him a llow Death, which Ihouldnbt be perceived till it cametopafs. Others confelfed that in his drunken fits he had committed thofecmel Ads of which he was accufed, yet that never any body attempted to poyfon him for all that ,â€¢ but that ' C . W f r 5 , er a f ecret frame and inward grief for having abandoned himfelf to fuch wild and extravagant Tranfportl that gnawed and devoured his heart However it were, the Rumour of his being poyfoned was never any other than a Rumour, and was always looked upon as a Dream for which there was no ground 5 tho had the bufinefs been more exadly enquired mto, the truth perhaps might have come to light ac cording to the Report. &amp; After the two chief Eunuchs, and chief Phyflcians had chey went alfo to inform the other Lords of the Council, Hill B b b b b keeping~ The Coronation limine the Secret as private as they could for fear the People or the Soldiers ftiould come to have the leaft lulpicion of ir. At the fame time alfo they defired them to confider the neceffity of affembling together for the Welfare of the Empire, ia regard the King was dead without declaring a Succetfor either in writing or by word of Mouth. Whereupon the Lords approved their prudent Management, and agreed upon a Place where to affemble, fuch as fhould give no occafion to any perfon living, no not to their moft familiar acquaintance to take the leaft Alarm. . . . , r . To that purpofe they made choice of the Place before the Gate of the Palace where the King layfick, where not only They, but all that belonged to the Court, were wont to appear about' feven of the Clock in the Morning when the King refides in the Country. Whither repaired the whole Throng of Cour tiers, not knowing any thing of tne Accident. There alfo ap peared the Lords who have their fhare in the Government, and went into certain little Tents, according to their ufual Cuftom, as well to expeft the Kings coming forth, as to be ready at hand to receive his Commands; or for the difpatch of Affairs, which either need no anfwer at all from the King, or upon which they already know the King s mind. For the better underftanding of which, you are to know, as already has been declared in our Treatife of the Government of the ferjiansy that when the King refides in the Country, they pitch him a large Camp in the Form of a City. In one of the extreme Quarters of which Camp they eredl the Royal Pavilions: and about fifty Paces from thence the Tents of ^ Grand Mafter of the Royal Houfhold: near to which they alfo fet up feveral leffer Pavilions richly furniflied on purpole for the Lords to fit down, difcourfe one with another, or for the difpatch of Bulinefs, fuch as I have already men tioned. , Nor is this Order of Encamping ever altered, although the King himfelf be lodged in a Houle. Thus it was an eafie thing for the Lords of the Council to affemble together without giving the leaft fufpicion to others; however to keep their defign the more clolely ftill concealed, they came with their ufual Trains and Habits, and with Coun tenances fo well compofed, that notwithftanding the various Emotions that agitated their different Paffions, there outward ly appeared nothing but fuch a letled latisfaition and content ment of Mind, as would not permit them one among another to dive into each others Brcafts. eboLYMAN III, [{tng Perfia.

The realon was,becaufe it was well known to all the World ' how fevere Hahas had been always toward him â€¢ fo that it 'was to be feared that the young Prince had been deprived of his fight Of which the Report had ran very hot ' ever fince the deceafed Monarch at his departij from I/pahan, difplayed fuch a difmal diflatisfadion in his Coun- c tenance, that portended nothing but fatal 5 and which they had more realon to believe, becaufe the Kins at the be- ginning of his ficknefs, had fent in great haft, without im parting his defign to any of his Council, an Eunuch with private Orders to the fame City.

For you know u faid he, that the facred Laws of the Eled of God not permit- Â«ing any perfon under that unfortunate Circumftance to be ' our Sovereign Monarch, we fhould be conftrained after all to &lt;c apply our felves to Hamzth Mir%a. And what thanks I would Â«fain know, will he then give us for our Election ? Will ' he not have reafon to tax us with our want of Affection, for Â« choofing him at a force put, when we knew there was no ' poffibility for his Brother to govern? Will it pleafe him, do ' you think, to accept a Crown at our hands, which we have 'offered to another? Will he think himfelf beholden to us for ' our iuffrages which we did not give him out of Kindnels or ' Affection to his perfon, but merely out of invincible Neceffi- Â« ty ? And God grant he may flop there, with being only fa- ' tisfied that he ows us nothing. Who knows but that he may ' ftudy Revenge, and whether our Coldnels may not kindle in ' his Breft a Fire that will not be quenched without our Ruin ' and the deftrudtion of our Families?But this is not all that we are ' to confider; when the Welfare of the Kingdom lies at ftake, ' particular Interefts muft give way. Mind therefore my Lords, ''what I have obferved at the Beginning of my Difcourfe. It be- ' hoves us to avoid the Dangers of an which will ' continue long, while time is wafted in Melfages to and fro ' from hence to the Capital City. But Providence hath put in- ' to our Hands Ham^eh-Mir^a, What remains then but to tollow ' the Commands of Providence, and forthwith to advance the ' Favoured of Heaven to the Sacred Throne of Prince of the ' World. The Prime Minifter having thus delivered himlelf, gave no final I occafion to the reft of the Lords to mufe from whence this Opinion of his fhould proceed. But in regard he was a Perfon that had always lived in high Reputation for his Integrity, and for that his being ftriken in years, and his long experience in Affairs rendered him greatly confiderable, they never fufpected the Advice which he had given had been the Effedt of ' e 'j n . tereft; more efpecially becaufe there was nothing propounded but what the whole Aflfembly believed to be very real. At length the greateft part entertained a Propofal fo acceptable to their wifhes with great Joy ; and they who only ha.d in their view their own particular Eftablifhment, were no lefs willing? in purfiiance of the Prime Minifters Counfel, to be thought asS o l y m a n III. Perfia. well affeded to thepublick Welfare, when indeed'rf^^r' ed nothing but their own Grandeur: For the fame Confiderations that had jway d the Prime Mmifter,and the Chief Supermtendant^s we have laid already had got polleffioa of their Minds likewife and infiifed into them an Apprehenfion of the uncertainty ot their Conditions,if Sephte-Mr^a were advanced to the Throne For that the Young Prince, were it only to fhew his Abfolute Power, would Ru e according to his own Fancy, and change his Officers as he pleafed himfelf. Nor could they think other- wife but that fome fecret Inftigations of Revenge would govern his Proceedings againft them, as being perfwaded, thai their Complacency had contributed to his Misfortunes j and that they were fo far from pacifying the difpleafure and complaints hich the deceafed King his Father made againft him, that they had applauded and flattered his Indignation. On the other fide, if the report were true of being poyfoned by the Gonlpiracy of fome of his Lords, it was eafie to conicfture how they that were guilty could not choofe butfeel a Remorfe ofCon- Icience and with what Terror they look'd upon a Succelfor, who being naturally enclined to violence, would readily lav hold upon a Pretence lo plaufible to revenge his Father's Death. But from the Eledion of the Younger Son there wasnofuch Apprehenfion of danger; in regard all things would move in i ir ufual Courfe, and for that his Minority would give them leifure to provide for themfelves, and to make the bit advan- tage ol the Employments which they enjoyed. Thereupon they weighed in the fame Balance the Probabilities, which the Prime Mimfter had fet forth, of the Death of the Eldeft ot the two Princes, and the hazards which the Monarchy would run through a tedious Expedation. And therefore they all with one Voice concluded upon the Eledion of Ham^eh-Mrza. r , ^ an J on g a JJ Grandees there was not any one that tefti- fied fo violent a Paffion for the Eledion of the Youngeft Son, as the bupenntedant General : nor indeed was there any one whofe par- it, as having more to fear , the advancement ofthe Elder,than anyof the reft And moreover he made no queftion, that he would lay it to his t , l , n r OC Furniture, the rich Cloaths, and other things that he defired : all which things by virtue of his Ofhce of Supemtendant, were at his difpofal. On the other fide he roar L kuidnefles for Ae Mother of the Younger Son, Am f 1- ! f l outward Palace, and then by the Aliiftanccof the Eunuchs that attended her in the Womens Apart- 17 C cccc mentThe Coronati he was in hopes to work himfelf To eflFeftually into the ' . /&gt; i â€¢ r J 1 C^h/^ nnirrKf' ti-* ^ ment, he was innu^cs ^ â€” , , / , . .â€” Favour both of the Princefs, and her Son, that he might be m a Condition to continue himfeU for a longer time in that high Credit wherein he had lived, during the Reign ot the Father. To which ourpofe when it came to his turn in Rank and Dignity, which was the third Place of Honour, to give his Opinion, it was with lefs indifference than thofe that preceded him had done. He confirmed all that had been faidby the Support or the Prime Minifter. He added moreover that he could not precifely tell in what Condition was at that time; however that it could not be but very bad, or rather fo deplo rable that it would not fufter either Himfelf, or any others in his behalf, to dream of the Empire; Thatfor the paft Years of 107 5. and 1076. after his Father had fliut him up under a clofe Reftraint, He had been kept very private ; That for him that fpoke, he made no queftion but that had cauled the byes of thePrince to be put out, as not believing him fit to Govern. Of which there was nothing gave him greater Atfurances,than that there had been no mention made of the Prince fince the Kings laft Progrefs to Ma^endaran, at what time the deceafed Kmg, beina upon the Road not above eight Leagues diftant from the Capftal City, brufli'dof a fudden back again in great haft, no man knowing either the Iffue of his Return, nor why he went. And therefore there was no farther reafon to doubt, but that he did it at length with a full determination to rid the world of that Youna Prince. Nor did there need any other convincing Proof of what he faid, than the Eunuch, who not long fince had been difpatched with private Orders, which could only relate to that Prince. And therefore it was an irrational thing to deliberate to which of the two Sons they fhould offer the Crown, fince only Bm^eh-Mr^a was by Heaven preferved to be their Prince. , Thus was this Royal Infant about to have been advan- ced to the Throne to the Exclufionof his Elder Brother. All the Grandees gave their Confents for this Election, norhad one ot thefe who had right to fpeak denied him his voice. There were only two Eunuchs that had not fpoke a word. And w o would have thought they durft have prefumed to havelpoken a word? efpecially the leaft in Credit of the two ? feeing that neither the one or the other having neither Right, Title or Au thority to fpeak, could any one have imagined that they IhouKt have been fo bold to entertain Sentiments contrary to a t e reft of that Illuftrious Family? Or if they fhould have been 10S o l y m a n III. I\tng Pcrfia. daring, was there any likelyhoodThey ftiould have theConfi- dence to dec are them, and to carry it againft fo many Voices ?

Princes, and Lords of Lords whjchyou ' have made to exclude from the Grown Sephie, the Eldelt Son Â« of Habas the Second, to whom it appertains by Law, and to Â« advance in his room Hm^eh-Mir^t, is an affront to Juitice a and che Laws of the Elecl Mejjlah, too vifible to believe you Â« have fliffered your felves to be fwayed to fuch a delign any Â« otherwife than by fome dazling Appearances as have fur- ' prized your Judgments. For I dare be confident that not Â« one amona you all does think the Motives that have been Â« alledaed fufficient. No the Pretence which you have Â« borrowed for the Eledion of Ham^h-Mtr^ais not rational. Â« The true Reafon that prevails in your Minds, if I may be u f 0 bold to tell you, tho you know it as well as my felt, is Â« your defire to govern ferfta for many years to come, and at Â« your own pleafure. It is therefore that you would eledt an ' Infant, under whofe Minority you may be able with permiui- Â« on to exercife an abfolute Authority. For what is alledged of the Eldeft Prince, that without doubt he is either deprived Â« of his Life, or of his Sight, can be look'd upon only as a Â« delufion. For had it been fo, fhould I have heard nothing Â« of it ? I that ever fince the Kings departure from the Capital ' City have always been exactly acquainted with whatever Â« paffed in the Womens Palace; I that have always been a con- &lt;c ftant Attendant in it ; and more than that have had the o- a vernment of the Young Prince?

Would he not have en- Â« larsed his Revenue, and augmented the Splendour ot his ' Court ? Would he have concealed it from me, and the Light Â« of Women,the Lady Mother of the Young Prince ?

In a word, there is nothing in all that which ' you pretend to fear, Styhie-Mtn^a lives and fees, my life for ' yours, God is my caution; and if it be not fo, here is my ' head. You cannot therefore without great Injuftice, or rather ' foul Treafon, forget the Eldeft, and lacrifice him to your ' own Pa/lions, and the Interefts of his Younger Brother. Ra- ' ther let the Younger Brother be facrificed to Him and the ' Interefts of the Kingdom. Do you not forefee how you ' are going about to throw the Kingdom into a difmal Con- ' fufion, and fill it with Divifion ? Think you the reft of the &lt;c Grandees will fuffer themlelves to be accounted Perlbns With- ' out Law,and approve your Votes ? Think you the People will ' take your Crimes upon their flioulders,and endure the Younger 'Brother fitting upon the Throne of the whom ' you could not place there till you had trampled under foot ' the moft Sacred Duties with which Religion infpires us ? On ' the other fide, all the World will rife againft you, to take ' part with the Lawful Heir,- or if that fliould not come to ' pals, you will be laden with Curies, and looked upon as ' the Authors of a moft Execrable Affaffination: You will blufh ' for Ihame all your Lives, and live with perpetual torment ' in your breafts. Ham^eh-Mr^a alfo himfelf, for whom you ' have proftituted your Conlciences, will not he reward you 'for it one day? He will look upon you as Dogs that ad- ' vanced him to his Honour only for the Hounds fees; and ' as fuch who in hopes to fatten your felves during his Mi- ' nority, fbrlbok God, the Law, the Prophet, the Book, the ' Explanation, Right Reafon, and Juftice. I am fure his ' Judgments will purfue you, and that the leaft punifhment ' you can expect will be to be fent naked into fome Defert, ' there to thank God for only laving your Lives. There he ftopt of a fudden with fome difturbance in his Countenance: but immediately proceeds with a luddenEx clamation : ' Ham^eh Mir%a, cried he, to what an extremity do you reduce him ? Would you, my Lords, that I ' Ihould go and ftrangle him with my own hands, and that ' I fliould bring him dead into your prefence ? I have the power, Â« he is under my charge.By that means I fhall be able to prevent ct you from making an ill Choice; You fliall then be conftrained ' to carry the Crown to the Eldeft j and then I leave you to ' confiderThe Coronation ' confider how he will receive it at your hands, when he ' fhall find that nothing could reduce you to your Allegiance but ' fuch a fatal extremity. With this threatning Language he concluded his Speech ; leaving the Lords of the Alfemblyfo furprized that if a Moun tain had fallen at their feet, as they fay in they could not have been more aftonifhed. They could not divine the reafon that fhould induce the Eunuch to fuch a determined Refolution: He was neither inftigated by Hatred, Fear, nor Hope. Not by Hatred, becaule they knew he tenderly foftered his lovely Pupil. Much lefs by Fear, fince he could expeft nothing but a foft Indulgence in relpeil of himfelf from the Perfon that had been bred up in his Arms. Nor could he hope for any of thofe advantages from the Eldeft, whofe difpofition he was not well acquainted with ,â€¢ for tho he might have a kindnefs for him, it could never be fo great as that, of the younger Brother, who had fuck'd it in with his Milk. Therefore they all found that he fpokeagainft his own Interefts, and that it could be nothing elfe but his zeal for Juftice and the Welfare of the Empire, his defire to fatisfie the People, and his Loyalty toward his de- ceafed Mafl:er,that cauied him to ad in that manner. However it encreafed their refped for him, and obliged them to admire his Sentiments lb generous, tho contrary to their Intentions, and fuch as altogether dilapproved their Condudt. It was about half a quarter of an Hour before any one of the Affembly durft lb much as open their laps; but ftill they fate looking one upon another, without fpeaking a word, per plexed between the flhame of recanting, and the fear of the danger which they ran, fhould they adventure obftinately to defend their firft Refolutions. At length the chief Minifter, whether it were that he was more a friend to Juftice than the reft, as there was reafon to conjecture from his wonted noble and unbyaffed manner of proceeding, or whether he feared left any other fhould fpeak before him, which had rendered him guilty, in regard it was his Place to fpeak firft, as he had al ready done when he argued lb ftifly againft How ever it were, the Prime Minifter firft breaking filence thus be gan : ' That true it was, that if the Affembly were infallibly ' allured that the Eldeft Son of II. was no longer in a ' condition to receive the Crown, they might juftifie the ' Eledion of the iecond Son; but fince Mubarek fo confi- ' dently alferted, that Sephie Mr^ had neither loft his life, nor ' his nght, they ought to choole him without any further ' dclibera-S o l y m a n III. ]\ing Perfia. ' deliberation: And therefore from the bottom of liiTlieariT &lt;Â£ he gave him both his Voice and all his choieelt Wiflies, pro ' teftingthat it was their duty forthwith to go and offer him ' the Diadem and the Empire. Upon thole words all the reft of the Lords grew faint-hearted, and had no longer power to defend the Injuftice which they had began. For the condition of thefe Lords renders them naturally fearful, who as illuftrious, and as great Princes as they feem to be, are in effed but ib many Slaves; their Lives, their Liberty, their Honour, their Eftates abfolutely depending upon the Pleafure of the Sovereign ; So that they were fo far from perfifting in their firft Opinions, that they ftrove which fhould be the firft that fhould renounce what they had done ^ and dillembling their Difcontents, they all unanimoufly de creed, ' That fince the Eldeft Son was in a condition to enjoy ' the Crown, which legally appertained to him, that it was Â« their duty without delay to fetch him from the Palace of ' Grandeur, and accompany him to the Throne. And thus was Sephie-Mif^a elefted Monarch of the Perfians contrary to the Intention of thofe themfelves that gave their Voices for him. The Prime Minifter added, that after fo unfortunate an Election of the King, they were immediately to proceed to a fecond, which was the Nomination of a Perfon among the great Lords of the Kingdom, who was to poft with all fpeed to I/paban, to fetch the Prince out of the Palace where he was enclofed, and feat him in his Throne with all the accuftomed Ceremonies, and to caufe him to be acknowledged Sovereign Lord of the Perfian Empire. Now though this Election were not of. equal Importance with the Election of the Prince, yet did it not occafion a lit tle trouble among the Lords 5 who had no fincere and real Amity one for another, after the manner of Courtiers; for every one had their particular defigns, and had an eye upon his Companion. However the Per Jon- to be nominated was to be taken out of their Number, becaufe there was not any of higher Quality than they were then at Court; and they that were of Infenour Rank could not pretend to that Honour. But then again believing that the Perfon, who fhould happen to be entrufted With fuch a weighty Errand, would m all proba- biljty gain a great Afcendant over the young Monarch's favour who to recompence the welcome Tidings of fuch a Meffenger' would afford him a large fiiare of his Affections, their bufinefs Wa#The Coronatio was to caft their Eyes upon fome One whole good nature and generous temper they might beft difpence with; if they could not find out oneofablblute Probity,and Sincerity. For what will not Vice attempt, when furniflied with fuch great advantages ? Or what Impreffions will not an evil perfon ftamp upon a Soul, if I may fo lay, altogether rare, or on a Prince whole tender Years will not permit him a due experience in the Affairs of the World ? So that every one of the Lords took care to nominate out of their number fuch a one as they thought would do leaft milchief, who if he had not a Will to do them good, Ihould have as little delire to do them harm. As for the Prime Minifter, and the Sujxrintendant, who for their high Dignity had moft right to the honour of fuch an important Deputation could not be Ipared, becaule at that juncture of time their Prelence was abfolutely necelfary at Court. The Prime Minifter was to ftay for the difpatch ofBufinefs, and to give Audiences upon Affairs of State, and by his Prefence to prevent any Difturbance that might arife upon the news of HabaAS, Death, if by any Accident it mould happen to be divulged before the time; which would foon have come to light by the abfence of the Prime Minifter, who never ftirs from the Prince's Elbow, if the King be alive. Nor wasitmorepoffible for the Superintendant to ftir, as well for the fame reafon, as for that He, having the fole ordering of all the rich Furniture and Treafures of the King's Houfe, and of all the Convoys and Waggons every day going and coming to the Court with Provifions and other Necelfaries, cannot leave his Employment, for fear any Diforder or Confufion fhould happen. Then again, becaufe it was ftill convenient that the People fhould know no more but that the King was fick, that was it which prevented the Grand Mafter of the Houfhold from being fent,- in regard his Office, like thofe of the two former, obliges him to be always near the King. The chief Aftrologer, and the chief Phyfician were not of Quality fufficient to alpire to that Honour, and much lefs the Two Eunuchs. In deed the Dignity of the Grand Elquire, and Grand Huntfman might in fbme, meafure have claimed it. But in regard they are not properly Officers of the Kingdom, but rather the Kings Officers; they began to caft their lies upon the Generals of the Army, the General of the Slaves, and the teers, chiefly becaule they are luperiour in Dignity to the two latter, and for that their Employments do not tye them to beS o l y m a n III. Perfia. at Court; True it is, they were not very gratefiJcoTthTLoi^ but forona: as before there was a neceffity that Inclination and Artection mult give way to Duty. Of thefe two Competitors, the General of the Slaves ex- pedted the Precedency as his due, in regard his Employment gave him the Preheminency; which he could not diflemble but dilplayed his hopes and expeftations in his very Counte' nance. However he miffed of his reckoning : for he had not one Friend in the whole Affembly ; they knew him too well to be a crafty Knave of a turbulent fpirit, and of a mifchievous humour; and therefore they were all afraid if he fpake firft to the new King, he would not forget his old tricks, but would form fuch Contrivances at leaft againft the greateft part of them, that they fhould nor eafily difintangle themlelves. Upon which confiderations they gave their Voices unanimoufly for the Ge- neral of the Mulquetteers. Not but that they had fome appre- enlions of him like wife, as not having altogetheer the Repu tation of a nncelre man, only he was a Saint in comparifon of the other For his Cunning did not carry him to the full ex tent of Malice. Befides that he was looked upon as a Per- fon^of great Parts, and one that underftood the Court, and the Interefts of the Neighbouring Princes. For which Reafon ? k n* j een ( 0r r 6 Years before in Quality of an Embafladour to the prefent King of the to congratulate his coming to the Crown; and had behaved him- with fo much Grandeur in the Embaffie, that his Mafter gave him fignal Teftimomes of his Satisfaftion. And indeed his AQamantadoes in that Court are ftrangely remarkable, fuch f the * e * de r will hardly credit, when I fliall publifli what I have colleiled in reference to that Embaflie. This Lord then, being thus deputed', the Affembly gave order about lome other things that concerned his journey, and NcwKing nianaÂ§e S aC Courl: in expectation of the ^ Firft, It was ordered that Eleven Perfons fhould accompany the Commiffioner to Ifpahan, that is to fay, two Aftrolosers the Mmch^im-Bacht or the Chief of thofe that profefs that Science, who was called Ur^akeand with him another Aftrologer, one of the moft noted in the Kingdom whofc ame was Mahamed-Saleh. They were to be prefent at the Coronation, with an Aftrolabe in their hands, to take the for tunatehour, as they term it in thePerfian Language and ob erve the lucky Moments that a happy ConftelUuon ftiould Ddddd pointThe Coronation I^^TfoTPtoceedings of that Importance. To thefe they added four of the Principal Officers employed m the cuitodyof the Treafure to carry and take care of what Jewels fliould be requifite for the Ceremony. The other five were not then nominated, in regard that every one of the Principal Officers of State had a right to appoint his own Deputy upon that Oc- ^^Thofe five Commiffioners, who are always Perfons of Qua- liry were in their Matters names to throw themfelves at the feet of the new Monarch, fo foon as he fhould be brought forth of the private Apartment of the Palace, and at the Ce remony of the Coronation to reprefent the Perfon by whom they were deputed. Of which the one was the 'Prime Mmifter j the other the Grand Superintendant ; the third, the of the Slaves â– , the fourth, the Lord ; and the fifth, the (Principal Secretary of State. In the fecond place it was ordered by the Lords, that the General of the Mujquetteers, with his Eleven Attendants, fhould fet forward the next Morning before day, unlefs the Grand Mroioger Ihould find the Conftitution of the Heavens and the Afpefts of the Planets not to be favourable; whereupon they Ihould forbear till a more lucky feafon. That then every one fliould depart, and ftay at a New which is four Leagues from J)ema^aan,ti\\ theTwelve Perfons being all arrived, they 3 might proceed altogether in their Journey. And that for fear 1 left if they fhould depart in Company from the Camp Royal, they Ihould create too great a jealoufie of the caufe of their Journey. . , , . ^ , f , In the third place the Lords ordained that the General or the Mulauetteers Ihould carry a Letter to his Majefty in the name of the whole Affembly, which flhould be read in their hearing, be fore it was put into his hands, that nothing might be inlerted but what was approved by all. r l u In the fourth place they unanimoufly agreed, for the ba rer concealing the Kings Death, that every one fhould Offi ciate in their leveral Stations, as they did before the doleful Ac cident hapned; and pay their accuftomed Attendance about the Palace. That in the mean time they Ihould amufe the People with a belief that the King was onlyfick, and in a fair way ol recovery.

In the fifth place ic was ordered that the Eunuchs with the chicr Phyficians fhould take care to embalm the Body of the deceafed King, to the end he might afterwards be put into a Leaden Coffin according to Cuftom. Laftly, The fame Lords ordained that at the end of Eight Days all the Court fhould depart from the Village of lUfms- Abaad where then it was ; and in regard it was impoffible in lb great a Hurry to travel far in a day,that they would make fliort Journeys to L^achaan ; that they fhould order their March ac cording to the Seafon, and as they thought molt proper, to prevent all occafions that might give the People any reafon too curioufly to pry into the condition of the Kings Per- fon, 5 Toward Evening the Letter which was to beprefented tothe New Monarch was delivered to the It was put up in a Purfe of Cloth of Gold, drawn together with firings of twifted Gold and Silk, with Taflels of the fame, and ? - 1 r t0 a Kn0t ' It: WaS realecl wich fo ft Wax; upon which the Chief Mmifter put his own Seal. Nor was any omitted of all thofe Knacks and Curiofities which the Oriental People make ufe of in making up their Epiftles. By this Letter, of which I was very careful to get a Copy, drawn from the Original, the Lords gave MajeJiy to underftand, ' How the Great Potentate and Ruler Â« whofe place is in Paradife, King II. whofe bright- ' Ininmg Glory God increafe, departed this Life the twenty fixth of the Moon called '^(aheya-e at the beginning of ' the %eturn (that is, of the Re without ccc 'I ma ^ e any Wil1, or Â§ iven an y 0rder touching his Succeffour, or nominated any Perfon to Govern the King- ' dom. &amp; as , ^ oon as the y notice of the Difmal Accident, they affembled together to confider who the Perfon was ^ whom Heaven had Elefted to fucceed the King.

This was the fubftance of the 'Terflan Letter, of which we haveexpreffed the Stile, and imitated the Strain as near as our Language would permit. Moreover upon the Back and the lowermoft Fold was fet the Seal of the Prime Minifter according to Cuftom. ill The next day the General of the Mufquetteers, and the other Eleven Perfons departed, and made all the haft that poffibly they could : Yet not fo fall as they could havedefired, or as Occafions of that nature required. For confidering the vaft number that rode Poft altogether, it was not to be expeded they fliould meet with change of Horfes i befide the danger ot breaking or endamaging the Jewels by a violent Motion, was a thing which the Officers of the Treafury were much affraid of. Thus they travel the hundred and twelve Perfian Leagues ( which make a hundred and forty French) between ahaad and Ifpahan, where they arrived the feventh day after they fet out, upon a Saturday. Which was the third ot the Moon, called Gumadi-el-avel, which anfwers to our fecond of OBoher, according to the Computation known among us j about feven of the Clock in the Evening; at what time the Mer chants andTradefmen in the and fia^as fliut up their Shops, and every body goes to his own home. SomeS o l y m a n III. Perfia. Some perfons of Quality obferving this numerous Troop that came Poft,and knowing the general of the Slaves at the head of them, and the reft of the Commons which they had feen at Court, believed that they rode before, and were come to pre pare all things ready in the Kings Palace by his Order for the Reception of his Majefty, whofe Return that City had long expedted with great impatience. Thereupon they enquired of the General as he paffedby, and of feveral others that followed him ; who made anfwer, that his Majefty was at hand and in a little time would appear in the City. Which equivocation was true, and yet concealed the Secret which he had in Charge. This numerous Train of Lords being arrived in the great Square before the Royal Palace, alig'hted with all their Retinue at the principal Gate of that Magnificent Pile, which they call Hali tyapi or Halys Gate, or by another interpretation, the High-Gate. There they all Stopped except the and the Prime Minifters Deputy. For they tooas foon as they were alighted, went directly to the lecond Gate oppofite in a direct line at fome, diftance to the other, as we fhall fhew in our Dil- cription of Ifpahan, which fecond Gate is the Principal Gate of the Womens Apartment, and is called the Through that Gate it was that thofe two Lords went to the firft Apartment without, appointed for the White Eunuchs. Eunuchs which in truth are pofted there to Guard the Place where the Women are inclofed, but never enter into it, but upon fome extraordinary and urgent Occafion. There the general of the Mufquetteers made known his Quality to the White Eunuch who came to receive him, and defired to go, and defire the Naxjr,that he would be pleafed to come forth with Ipeed, for his bufinefs would admit of no delay. We have already ob lerved tnat this Jga-Nazjr had been entrufted by the Deceafed King, in his Life rime, with the Guardianfhip afterwards Elected Monarchjand with the general Overfight of the Womens Palace; which obliged him to take all the care ima ginable of this Apartment, which is as it were a Corps du Gmrd-, where the White Eunuchs are lodged that watch the entrance into the Womens Apartment. However he hath a Magnifi cent Palace in the City 5 but then he hapned to be attendincr on his Duty in the Palace. He therefore underftanding that a Lord of tLt high Quality defired tofpeak with him, prelently went forth to know what Commands he brought. So foon as he appeared, the General of* c The Coronatio Mufquetteers advanced alone to meet him,while the 1 rime Mi- lifters Deputy out of refped kept a diftance behind The General having drawn the Eunuch afide whilpered iomc words in his Ear, which were never known what they were, or at leaft I could never certainly learn what they were. Some affirm that he difcovered to him the Death of and tne Election of the Eldeft Son of that Monarch, whofe Governour that Eunuch was. Which he was forced to do, becaufe he had no Orders in writing from the King, nor could have, in regard he was Dead. And yet this is always obferved, when any Grandee, difpatched from the Court, demands any perfon within to be let out, he fhews his Command to the Governour of the Place. Others alledge that he faid nothing to him of that weighty Affair, for that it would have coll him his Head, had he declared it to any other before he had declared it to the King. However it were, if he did make any difcovery, it was in few words. For immediately thofe two Lords, the General of the Mufquetteers and the Seeing Eunuch, went forward to the other more remote Apartment, which joyns immediately to the laft Entrance into the Apartment. When they came to that Apartment where lie the Black Eunuchs, who have Liberty to go up and down the inner Houfe where the Women are lodged, one of the Chief among them underftanding the Jga Nazjr was come forth to underftand what he defired: the other defired him to go immediately to Sej)hk-Mr^a and to let him know that the Mejfenger mojl Sublime Command and of tmoft ftaid at the Door, and had lomething to communicate to himof thehigheft Importance, and which was for his Advantage. And there fore, that he would be pleafed to come forth and (peak with him. Which words the White Eunuch delivered to the Black Eunuch in fuch aTone, and with luch a Countenance as di(co vered nothing either of Sadnefs or Joy, from whence he could make any Conjedures either of bad or good Fortune. For confidering the fecrecy of the Affair he came about, it be hoved him to affed a kind of Indifferency. So that the Black Eunuch reported back the MefTage to the Young Prince as he had received it, who at that time was with the Princcls his Mother. t I fhall rather chufe to give the Reader leave to imagin what was the Aftonifliment that feized thofe two Royal Perfons at the fuddennefs of the News, and whence they had reafon toS O L Y M A N III. King of Perfia.' gather a thouland liilpicjons and jealoufies, than go about toex- prels it in words. We learnt afterwards, that for lometime they flood like Statues in a profound filence,' which was firft in terrupted by a loud fhriek of the Princefs, and afterwards by thefe words, which brake forth through the midfl of her fighs while Hie embraced the Prince, Jh thy Life. And indeed flie could not look for any other thing for him than Death, or fome other Misfortune little lefs terrible. She much lefs dreamt that it was to advance him to the Throne. For in two Years that fhe had taken leave of her Husband, then healthy and vigorous, in the Flower of his Age, not exceeding thirty fix Years, fhe had never heard of his being fick, muchlels could fhe believe him dead. Therefore when fhe heard that a Noble Order was come to /peak with the Prince, what could (he think but that this Order came from Ha the Second; and that his Command was either to put to death, or pluck out her Sons Eyes; and that if they preffed him fo earneflly to come forth, it was only to underfland and luffer the Execution of-that Order. All Appearances confirmed this lad Sulpicion. The feverity of the Monarch was known to her, as well as the dilguft which he had taken againft his Eldeft Son, of which he had given Inch publick proofs by the ftrict Captivity to which he had confined him. But lire that moft perplexed her, and augmented her miflrufts, was the Lady-Mother of Ham^eh- Mr^a,' Queftionlefs, faid fhe, that wicked Woman it is, ' who by herCarelfes and alluring Charms has over-ruled the ' King, to deprive my Son of the Crown, to fet it upon hers. Thereupon fhe began to redouble her Shrieks and Lamentations infuch a manner, that the whole Palace rang with her Com plaints. All the Ladies furprized to hear the firfl of the Kings Legitimate Wives in fuch an Agony, ran preiently to condole her Ibrrows, and to intermix their Tears and Complaints with hers. And indeed they had reafon, efpecially the Confidents of the Young Prince, who had an extraordinary Palfion for his Interefts. Friendfhip in others produced the fame Effects, be lieving bloudy Executioners were come to ravifh from their Arms a friendly Prince in his tender Years. So that it is laid that the Women railed liicha general Compaffion, that even the Black Eunuch who was prelent, tho they are a lort of Peo ple endued with favage and remorfelefs Souls, could not refrain from dropping fome few tears, and quitting that Indifferency to which his Truftand Duty obliged him. The /The Coronation The General of the Mufquetteers and the at the fame time heard theWomens Lamentations, and believing it proceeded from themiftakeof the Mother of the Ladies that belonged to the Prince, fenta fecond Black Enunch to allure the Princels, that the MelTenger who waited for the Prince her Son at the Gate had brought him happy tydings, and defircd only to sive him notice of a more Exalted Fortune. Which they both confirmed by an Oath moft folemn among the Perfians, by the Head of the GreatJgrea, by whom they mean Haty, whom they believe to be the real Succeffour to But all .ihole Oaths and Proteftations did nothing avail but only to augment the Miftrufts of the affli^ed Mother. She redoubled her Lamentations more loudly than before; She hugged her beloved Son in her Arms, and intheTranfportsof herlbrrow called down a Thoufand Imprecations upon the deceafed Kine her Husband, calling him the Fatal caufe of all her Tears. Wherein fhe faid Truth, tho he were but a very Innocent Caufe. Sometimes fhe turned to ward the Lordly Meifenger, whom fhe reproached with the fcurrilous Terms of %, and M fometimes toward the Emuchs that wereprefent, whom fhe upbraided tor Allthe while the Young Prince flood immovable; for, as is faid, he uttered not one word j nor did he fhew in his Counte nance any fign of forrow. It is very probable, that it was lb extreme, as to overwhelm him in luch a fore, that he had neither Life nor Motion. While Nature that could not find fufficient fisns to exprefs 'her dreadful pains, flood as it were en tranced , not knowing what fide to take. Therefore the Young Prince fhednot a Tear, becaufe the occafion which he had to weep was fo great: In that manner he flood in the midfl ofthe Lamentations of the Women, who detained him, and drevv him to their knees, as if they had refolved to defend him, and pre vent thofe that came to carry him away from approaching his This Scene had lafled above three quarters of an Hour, for other Black Eunuchs that were fent one after another with Oaths and new Imprecations to affure them that the General brought Orders only that were highly to the Princes advantage, could sain nothing upon the belief of the Mother and the other Women, fo that the Na^rrefolved to go himfelf in perfon to try what he could do to undeceive her. But fo loon as he appeared before the Mother, and with terrible Oaths endea-S o l y m a n III. Perfia. voured to affure her that there was no danger, the Princels ftill holding her Son clofely embraced in her Arms, cried out, And Thou Dog, art thou alio rejl? The difconfolate Princels was not to be comforted for the more Meflfengers^ they lent, the more Oaths they Iwore, thelefs credit flie gave to their Imprecations. She looked upon them all as Artifices to furprize her, and to induce her to confentthat her Son Ihould go forth where Death waited his coming. But at length feme of the Principal Young Ladies luffered them- felves to be over-ruled by the perfualions of the and the horrible Imprecations which he called down upon his head, that there was no danger in the world, and aflifted him to bring forth the Prince; and yet with feme kind of violence in forcing him from his Mothers Arms. Who being reduced to defpair, feeing ihe could not refift the refpe&amp;ful violence that was put upon her, and that flie could no longer hold the dear Pledge of her Life, flie flung from her Seat of a hidden, and after fhe had fnatched the Dagger out of the Sheath that hung at the Young Prince's fide, prefentihg it to the Breaft of the Chief Eunuch, who was next her, and had the Young Prince by the hand. Go, laid flie, in the'Kanie do ft, and what thou hajipromijed. mufl thy felfft? alt jirjl fujfer thepunijhmmt Treafondeferve. Prefently the Eunuch accepted the Condition, and conlented to receive his death at her hands if any thing difmal befel him. Which fbmewhat pacified the Lady, lb that flie delivered the Poniard, and luffered it to be flieathed again at her Sons fide. And then it was that the Eunuch redoubling the Oaths that he had fworn, and the Affurances which he had already given her, that there was no danger, but on the contrary, a profpeÂ£l of all Profperity, fatisfied thole Royal Perlbns, as much as it was poffible, in fuch a dubious Dilemma of their Anxious minds. The Mother accompanied her Son as far as the laft Place, where flie was permitted to go without being leen through the Gate that flood open, and then returned with a lad heart, lup- ported by fome of her Women, and the Prince trembling and quivering was carried , as I may fo fay, by the ChiefEunuch without the firfl Portal, toward the Apartment of the black Eunuchs. Eeeee AtAt the very Inftant that he appeared without, the General of the Mufquetteers, with the Prime Minifters Deputy, who kept at a alliance behind him, threw himlelf at the Prince's Feet, and made three Obeyfances according to Cuftom, knocking the Ground with his Forehead. Then rifing upon his Knees, with his Cheeks all bathed in Tears, which either the Lamentations of the Ladies had drawn from his Eyes, or the Death of the Monarch, of which he brought the News, had made him fhed, he declared the occafion of his coming in thefe words, which he uttered with a loud voice, and very diftin6tly. May your Illujlrlous Head he Jafe ; 77;e Kjng World, jour Father Habas, to whom accumulation of Glory hds found a'Place and lourlllujlrioui Highnefs is chofen Jliled the Lieutenant of the true Soverei For that is the fignifi- cation of the word Falie-Neamet, which was made ufe of in that Expreffion, as being the moft ufual Epithete, as alfo the moft fublime, which the ferftans have been accuftomed to give their Kings. For Vahe denotes a ; that is, an Ablolute Prince in his Dominions, and yet one that depends and holds of another. It alfo fignifies a Mediator almoft in the fame fenfe. Becaufe a Lieutenant of that nature is a Medi ator between the Lord from whom he derives his Authority, and the People to whom he diftributes both Punifhmencs and Re wards in the Name of the Sovereign Supreme. As for it comes from the word Inaam, which lignifies the free Gift of a Lord r * his Slave. So that by the Compound the (perfans underftand a Lieutenant, whom the true and fupreme Sovereign, who is God, has eftabliflied with abfolute Autho rity to dilpence over all the World in his Head his Favour and Benefits, as we fhall more amply and more to the purpofe ex plain it in another place. The General of theMufquetteers thought it not convenient to ufe more words, that he might not delay the Prince, whom he found to be impatient to hear what he had to lay. But then from one extremity he fell into another quite contrary. To thofe Tears that had forfaken him fucceeded Aftonifhment, Joy and ; Sadneis that overwhelmed him anew ,â€¢ and rendered him once again as motionlels as before. He became like a peribn who out of long Darknefs comes of a fudden in a flaring Light. He feemed to be feized with a kind of dazling Amaze, and like one that did not fee, beheld as in a Trance, the great number of Eunuchs that kneeled roundSol ym A n III, l^mg of Perfk round about him, calling him their I.ord and Sovereisnrfhde firft Minutes being over, he appeared more compoled in'his Countenance , and foftly leaned upon the Chief Eunuch, like one that had been waked out of a profound fleep. He began to reflet upon what was paffed, and he found that they were lb far from having any defign upon his Life, that they came to ad vance him to the Throne. Neverthelefs, in regard he could not hear thofe joyful tydings, but as they Were accompanied With the News of his Fathers death, both unlookt for, the furpnfe was equal on both fides, and put him a third time into luch an altoniihment that he flood for fome time in a kind of a Trance. 1 his Grief for fome Minutes contefted with his Toy till at length his good nature overcame the latter. He obeyed theperfuafions of his forrow; not minding what he had sained, but what he had loft: and in the midft of thofe thoughts, over powered by his Affliction, according to the Cuftom of the l wr a tore his Cabaye, or upper Garment, from the Collet to the watte. He wept biterly, not having fhed a tear till that time ,â€¢ tho the Lamentations of his Mother, and the Confter- nation wherein he had beheld all the Ladies of his Palace had given him lufficient cau{e. This fliewed the good nature of the oung Monarch, as I have already faid, for it cannot be ima gined that he difTembledin what he did. He was too youncr to underftand the fly tricks of craft and fubtilty, and being one who had never feen the world, but had been bred up ten derly among the Women ,â€¢ accuftomed only to talk of fine Cfoaths, and Baubles, and to command Eunuchs. Befides that, the dif order of his mind for above an Hour before would not permit him to obferve fuch a regular Condud:. So that althougn he had been ill ufed by his Father, who had fhut him up m a clofe Pnfon, and whofe Death feemed to reftore him to Life, by giving him his Liberty and a Diadem, he could not forbear to bewail his lofs as an Evil that was never a whit the lels for being the caufe of fo much good. Rather muft it then be an efted of Nature, which fhews that fhe is always the Miftris o our Affections, and that the Paffions which fhe infpires will ftill prevail, notwithftanding all the ObftacI.es of Ambition, fn- terelt, or good Fortune. â€¢T h r e Ge 7' ai 0 i the Slaves beholding the Prince oppreffed h fomuch grief, made no Anfwer, fpeaking only,as I may fo y, with his Eyes,from whence he let fall a fhower of Tears and ng ^rjoHger dU the Prince commanded him role of himfelf, and approaching his Majefty, made Eeeee z ufe^The Coronatio TJftTof all his Eloquence to alleviate his forrow. 1 he Eunuch alfo was no lefs fedulous to joyn with him in com, fortius the Young Prince, fo that by degrees the violence of his mourning began to abate. The luftre of a Diadem reprefented it felf before his Eyes with all its gW &gt; lo he fuffered himfelf to be overcome with the Charms of Grandeur, and the fplendour of an exalted Fortune that glittered in his fight, accoiding to the Expreffion in the Perftan Orieinal. Thereupon the two Lords looking {tedfaftiy one upon ano ther, as it were making figns to each other as to what they had already concluded among themidves; and well knowing thtn. as yet the Young Prince underftood not how to ad the King, they asked him, as it were by way of an indirect and glancing InftruÂ£lion what he had to do, whether it were his Majefties pleafure that they fhould attend him forthwith to the Palace Royal, to receive his Diadem, in regard it was of great im portance that he fhould make no longer delay. To which the Prince condefcended, and ordered them to do whatever in their judgment they deemed moft proper and convenient. Upon which the General of the Mulquetteers, attended by the Eunuch, with a great Train ot other Perfons, conduced the Prince to the Apartment where the Kings were accuftomed to give Publick Audience, which they call Tavwleh, where the Deputies of the Principal Officers of State^ the GrandJjlrologer, and the reft that came from the Court were admitted to make their three ufual Proteftations in his Prefence, the Deputies in the Name of their Mafters, the reft for themfelves. After that, his Majefty went into a Bath which was near the Apartment, there to purifie himfelf, as the Law ordains, and to array himfeU in new Habits, while all things were preparing for the Coronation with all diligence. , â–  i i â€¢ In the mean time the Chief of the Aftrologers, witn his Companion that came along with him from the Court, k - tiring to their proper Station, let themfelves to oblerye the Lucky Hour according to the Pofition of the Stars for the performance of this weighty Ceremony. Thus all things were got ready in leis than an hour and a half, through the great diligence as well of the General of the Mufquetteers, as of the NazjrEunuch, who from the very moment that they arrived at the Ladies Palace, and during the time that the Kins ftaid in the Bath, had privately fent wita all - IpeedS o l y m a n III. Perfia. fpeed for the Furniture of Perfons neceflary for the So- lemnity. Which before I declare at large, I am induced to think it will not be amifs to make a defcription of the place where it was performed. And this I fliall borrow from an other Treatife of my own, wherein I have given a full ac- compt of the Capital City of and what is in it moft worthy obfervation. Toward die North, very near the Walls of the Palace, over againft one of the Gates that lead to the principal Entry, is an ancient Apartment, built in a perfect Square, everf fide con taining four and twenty foot. It was erected long ago by King Talmas: From this Bulding to the Gate appears a very large Alley, lhadcd with lofty Maples ^ all along the fides of which from the Entrance to that Apartment are placed at the diftance of ten or twelve Paces one from another, certain ftone Mangers of a convenient height, and plaftered over with Lime and Chalk, to tye the Horles that are made choice of out of the Royal Stables to the number ufually of twelve or fifteen, or fomecimes more upon high Feftival days, or when any Em- bafladours or other Foreiners of great quality are admitted to have their firft Andience of the King. At what time they are conducted through this Alley through the midll of thelc Horfes gorgeoufly harneffed. For all their Caparifons are enriched with precious ftones as thick as they can lie ; the Chains, the Shooes, the Hammers, the Buckets, the Curry-combs, in a word, whatever is ufed in a Stable is all. of pure maffie Gold, as we have already declared in its proper place. On the right and left Hand of the Apartment, were to be feen certain Beds of Flowers and Trees planted here and there at random according to the ferfian manner, where Nature only feems to be the Garderies. Before and toward the South the Garden extends it lelf in Breadth and Length, divided as it were into Beds and Ipacious Plots, parted one from another with tall Trees, and planted with fo many forts of Flowers, that Tome continue blowing during all the three warmer Seafons of the Year. This Apartment is built for the mofl part of Carpenters Work ; nor is the Floor of it level with the Superficies of the Alley, but raifed about three foot above it. The Covering is Flat, fufteined with turned Pillars, overlaid with Gold to aconfiderable thicknefs, feme fix or feven and twenty foot high. The ground-work of the Ceeling is of carved work in pieces anfwering one ano ther, and forming Partitions, where the Gold glifters no lefs thanThe Coronation than in other places. Thus this Apartment is open of all fides, but when the Curtains are let down, which are faftened at the top of the Pillars, equal with the Ceeling without fide. And they always let them down either on one or the other fide ac cording to the Hour that they know the King will come. But when they let them down, they do not fuffer them to hang to the ground as we do ; but draw them with their firings to the next of the great Trees in the Garden, and then faften them to the Bodies of the Trees in fuch a manner at the height of ten foot from the ground, that they ferve inftead of large to prevent the Sun-beams from fhining into the Room, and yet without hindering the Company,whether fitting or Handing,from having a full fight of all that is done within. The Curtains are of Crimfon Linnen, lined with Indian Chite moft gayly painted. The bands wherewith they are tied back, as are all the running firings, are of coarfe Silk. The Body of the Apartment is divided into three parts fepara- ted only by fmall Balifters of Joyners work richly gilded. The two fides make two Halls of fix and thirty paces long, and fixteen broad. Between the two Halls is to be feen a Talaar, or a Balcony of State railed four foot higher than the Halls; in the midft of which ftand a large and deep Font of white Marble, which receives the Cryftal water that continually falls into it from a Pipe of the fame coloured Marble. Xhe whole Room is gilded all over, and that fo thick, that altho it be above a hundred Years fince it was firfi: laid on, there is no thing to this day that appears either Tarniflied or fhel'd off in any part. It is called Talaar-Tavieleh, as we have already hinted, the Hall of the Stables, for that upon certain days, as we have faid, the Hories of State are brought out, and tied clofe by. For Talaar fignifies properly an exalted Balcony, and denotes a Stable, or any other place where they tie Horfcs. This was the Place, and thus adorned for the Coronation of the King. For the next day I had the liberty to go in, to look about me at leifure, and obferve the Magnificence of the Furniture, and of all that had been made ufe of at the Cere mony. The two Halls were Ipread with Carpets of Silk, and all along the fides were placed a great number of low fquare Beds, covered with flowered Tiflue of Gold and Silver. The Taitar or Balcony of State in the middle, was hung and Ipread with Carpets of Gold and Silver: The Cufhions round about it being of a certain Stuff made in Terfta, called Mach-S o l y m a n III. Perfia. melt-zer-haf, which is a fort of Velvet weaved in Flowers and Foliage, confifting of Silk interwoven with Gold. It was alfo rurnifhed with Veffels to fpit in, like thofe in the other Halls, fome of which were embellifihed with fmall Rubies and Turcoifes. In the place defigned for his a Quilt was laid, ftufc with fine Sheeps Wool, four fingers thick, and between three and four foot in length; over which was fpread a very fine Coverlet of Indian Work pinked with Gold, being a moft ad mirable piece of Workmanfhip. This Carpet covered all the Quilt, and hung down four fingers on every fide, by that means hindering the Quilt from being leen; befides that, it was kept tight at the two Corners by two great Apples of maffie Gold fet with precious Hones; clofe to which ftood two little Veffels to fpit in, fumptuoufly wrought. At the other end lay a Cu- fliion of which the lower fide was of Cloth of Gold, inter mixed with red Flowers and green Leaves; As for the upper fide I could not tell what Stuff it was made of,becaufe I could not come near enough to obferve itbefides that, it was all over covered with Diamonds,Emeralds, Pearl, and other Precious ftones, that call a wonderful luftre, fo that it was impoffible to know the ground of that coftly Embroidery. The Room was enlightened with fourteen Lamps all of maffie Gold, not hung up, but let upon the ground as we let our Candlefticks upon Tables or Stands. Thefe Branches, all of Duckat Gold, are lo lubftantial, that there are lome which weigh fixty Marks; and the leaft weigh thirty or forty. Of thefe Lamps there were eight in the Talaa in the Middle, and three in each of the Halls, where were alio eight Candlefticks with two Branches apiece of maffie Gold alfo, three foot high, and weighing more than the Lamps. The place for the Coronation, being thus prepared, they brought and laid upon the middle of the the four- Principal Pieces which are in a manner conlecrated to this Ce remony. The firft was a Scour^je, or Scat which fcrved inftead of a rone, being a little kpare Cufhion Stool, three Geometrical reet in height; the feet of the Pillars that fupported the Corners being faihioned like fo many great Apples; and to fecure the Seat, there ran as many Crofs Bars both above and below. The upper part was fmoothand plain, without any thing that might make the Seat fofter, being all the fame materials with the relt, that is, maffie Gold very thick; the four Pillars alio andThe Coronation TTfthe Feet being plated with Gold,and fet with little Rubies and fome Emraulds.This fame Stool at other times is kept very charily in the Treafury Royal, which is a Dungeon in the torn els of Jfpahan, and fo weighty, that two men can hardly carry it. I law it there by good fortune; having the opportunity to get in, when the Vazjer, ox Farmer (Royal of the City came to open all the MagazinesandClofets, in regard the King was the next day to fhew them to his Mother and his Wives. The fecpnd Piece was a Taag, or Diadem, or Crown, ror 1 can- not find any other word to exprefs it by in our Language; nor could the Terftans, were they to tranflate the word Crown into their own Language, find a more proper word than their own Taa' i which is that Verfian Crown or famous Bonnet, which fome Travellers call the Sophy's tho I know not tor what reafon. I have in another place delivered my opinion lufficiently concerning it. It is a Hat Bonnet, lomewhat like the Mortar-Caps of the Prefidents of the French Parliaments; only it is not altogether fo large, nor fo deep. It is made fome- what ftraiter at the lower end; and carries in the middle a Point that feems to come out of the middle of the Bonnet, but is only fowed on, tho very neatly and artificially. This Point rifes up about a fingers length, and leffens toward the end, tho ac the top it feems to grow bigger again. The Materials of the Bonnet prepared for the new King was of Cloth 01 C j O d; bound about after the manner of a Dhul-handt { which our Writers, for want of Language, erroneoufly call a Inrbant) with one of the fineft and Thinneft Calicuts that India could afford, and Tilfued with Silver upon the brims the breadth of two fingers. The outfide of the Hollow of the Bonnet at the Top was covered all over with an Embroidery of Diamonds, from whence hung down feveral Chains of precious ftones that fliaded all the rell of the Circumference, and dangled down upon the Bonnet, which was no lefs (umptuoufly embellifhed with all the richeft Jewels of the Crown: round about ftood little tufts refembling Herons Feathers, all of Jewellers work, nothing inferiour to the reft. In other parts of the Bonnet were erected little Plumes of Herons Feathers, and Birds of Paradi e. The Dhul-handt was all hung about with ftrings of Precious ftones, Diamonds, Rubies, Emraulds and Topazes faltene to the Heron Plumes, which ftrings covered all the from the top to the bottom, dangling down upon the Calicut Facing to keep it faft, and prevent it from unloolening. Ju over the forehead (hone another Heron-Tuft, much moie aloriousS o l y m a n III. Kjng Perfia. i glofious than all the reft: from the top of which rofe up three Sockets of Precious Stones, wherein were placed little Tufts of Herons Plumes. The third Piece was a Chemchir, or Sword, of which the Hilt and Scabbard were all covered over with Precious Stones pro- portionably to the Diadem. All the Perfian Swords are about three Fingers broad, and bowed backward almoft like a Semi circle. For they who profels to underftand a Weapon in Terfia maintain that a Blade fo bowed cuts much keener, and makes a deeper wound than a ftreight Sword, which they de- monftrate bv the Rules of Fencing, which we have not at this time leifure to examine. The fourth Piece is a Gangher or Perfian Dagger, of which we have given you the Portraiture, as of all the tell j fo that there needs not any farther defcription For the infinite number of Precious Stones would not permit the fight to judge of the Materials of the Sheath, tho there is no queftion to be made but that it was of Gold. Now to tell you the worth of thefe three laft Pieces for as to the firft it may be eafily computed) is a Task which I dare not undertake, becauie I could never underftand any thing of certainty in that concern. True it is, that I have heard a Lord of the Court aver, that as well the Crown as the Sword and Dagger were valued at above a hundred thoufand which amount to near five Millions of our French Money. But I would not advife any perfbn to believe it. Fori know the Per- Jians too well, and particularly the Courtiers of that Country, for there is no People in the world lefs friends to Truth, and who take fo much pleafure to multiply Objects, or to enhance the Grandeur and Magnificence of their Prince. However it is not altogether improbable what they fay : for I have feen one of his Majefties Heron-Tufts, of which fome in Jfpahan valued one fingle Diamond in the middle at and the reft at four and twenty tho If the Royal Diadem had any more than one Heron-Tuft of that Va lue, or if that Ruby were upon it, which by the expreis Com mand of the deceafed King, the Eunuch that had the charge of the Treafury fhewed me at Ma^andera which be of an Oval form, weighed (as the faid Eunuch told me a fixty Caratts, the Chains or Strings, with the Sword and being proportionable in value, the three Pieces might well amount to a hundred thouiand But notwithftand- ing all this to tell you my opinion fincerely, I could ne- Fffff verThe Coronat ver judge them to be worth above three parts of the money. Thefe three Pieces were laid near the Stool, and covered with a rich Toilet. Prefently his Majefty appeared coming out of the Bath, and arrayed himlelf in his ufual Habit, tho more fiimptuous than he was wont to wear; after that being entered into the Room of State, he late down in the Place that waspre- pared for him, and it the lame time they who were appointed to alfift at the Coronation, alcended the and ranged thetn- felves in this Order. Upon the Right fide of his Majefty, at a little diftance be hind him flood the Jga-Nazjr who at that Ceremony performed the Office of High Chamberlain, carrying to that purpofe at his Girdle a little Box of Gold glittering with Precious Stones, wherein were a good Number of Handkerchiefs, and Perfumes for his Majefties fervice when he had 3 mind to make ule of them. A little behind him appeared fix Children from fifteen to fixteen years of Age, who had been made Eunuchs, extremely beautiful, as are moft of the young Children of that Country. They were lb placed as to make a half Circle about the King, Handing upright without fo much as ftirring their hands which they held acrofsupon their Breafts; being lumptuoufly habited in Linnen, whofe ground was Silver heightned with Gold in the fame Order, and as far behind the Children, as they ftood behind the King, appeared a great number of old black Eunuchs, every one holding a long Mul- quet in his hand, of which the Stock was garnifhed with Gold and Precious Stones. Upon the Left hand of the King, which is efteemed the moft Honourable among the Perfi late firft the Commiffi- oner that reprelenced Ttlahamnied-Mehdi, the Prime Minifter ; Next to him the fecond Commiffioner that reprelented Gemchid-^aan General of a Body of the Army ,â€¢ Next to him the Perfonthat fupplied the Place of Mazjoud-Bek, dant General of the Kings Demeans. In the fourth Seat, the PerlonCommiffiohed by Mtr^a-fedreel-din, Principal Secretary of the Empire. Hemireh-Ham^eh-Mr^ah-Daroga, Grand Provoft of Ifpahan and its Dependencies, took the fifth place. And Mirza- efteemed one of the moft Learned among the took the next. Upon his Majefties Right Hand, in the lecond Place (for the firft was left voidj in honour of 'BoctdaaK-Sultan, General ofS o l y m a n III. Kwig Perlia. of the Mulquecteers, whb was prefent but Handing upright/ near the Prince late the Perfbn deputed by MahammedK^m 11- J^aan Lord Chief juftice. Below him two Places were left void for the chief Aftrologer and his Colleague, who were retired to obferve the Lucky Hour. The fifth Place was filled by the moft learned and wittieft perfon that Was in all that great Kingdom, by the judgment of all men, being the Brother of the Prime Minifter, and great Uncle to the new Monarch by his Wife. His name was and his Title Cheik-cl-IJlaam, or Ancient of the For by the word which properly fignifies the Reverence which We pay to the divine Commands, by the ilibmiffion of our Mind and Will, they mean Religion, which they call the Law, by way of Ex cellence. For at this day, as formerly among the Hebrews, all their Politicks depend upon Religion; and it is the Ancient of the Law who holds the Ballance of Affairs in his Hand, which cannot be determined without his Approbation. In the fixth Place lace Mrza-Moumen-Vazjer, or Receiver General for his Majelly in Ifpahan and its Dependencies. I could never hear of any other Grandees but thefe that fate. True it is, that the Halls on both fides were full of Officers that flood ifome to authorize the Solemnity of the Coronation; fbme to be ready to execute the King's Commands, as they fliould receive them from the General of the Mufquetteers, who for that day fupplied the Place of Lord High Steward of the Houfhold icarrying in his hand, as a Badge of his Office, a large Truncheon of Gold, all let with Precious Stones, and a round Ball at one End ; and ftanding at the left hand of the King, from whom he received Orders, or to lay better,to whom he gave directions. For the new King who had never leen any fuch fight before, neither did nor faid any thing but what was dictated to him. About ten a clock at night the Chief of the Aflrologers and his Companion,having been long obferving the Pofition of the Stars, and Conjundions of the Planets, returned at length to give notice that the Fortunate Hour for the Coronation of the King would be within twenty Minutes. Thereupon his Majefty or dered the General, as he had been taught before, to lead them both to their Places. In the mean time he whilpered with the General, who gave him Inftrudions how to behave himfelf upon all the feveral changes of the Solemnity: which the young Prince failed not to follow exactly, for fear of committing any Irregularity, for F f f f f 2 want^ ^im Lorvnation oj- want of experience in an Adion of fo gublick^artd weighty a Concernmenc. When the twenty Minutes were alrriolt expired, the Grand Aftrdloger having winked upon the General to let him know that he might proceed, he told the King; who thereupon immediately, according to his Inftrudions, rofe up; and then all the reft role up likewife. At what time the General threw himfelf at his Majefties Feec, bowing to the very Ground ; then riling upon his Knees he drew out of the Bofom of his Gar ment, the Bag wherein was the Letter which the Aflembly had fent to the New Monarch. Prefently he opened the Bag, took out the Letter, kilfedit, laid it to his Forehead, prefented it to his Majefty, and then role up. The Prince having received it, returned it to him again, and commanded him to break it open and read it; Which he did aloud very diftinctly and leifurely, to the end that all who were prelent at the Ceremony might hear the Contents, and underftand that the Grandees of the King dom had unanimoufly elefted the prefent Prince for King of fV- fia, that they acknowledged him for fuch,and were ready to atteft it if there were occafion. When he had done reading, the King commanded him to fend for the Ancient of the Law, which he did j at what time the Lord Ancient, approaching his Majefty, threw himfelf at his Feet, and after the ufual Proftrations, he rofe up again, took the Letter out of the Generals hand, to acknowledge and au thorize it, to verifie the Seals, and atteft that it was real. For that acknowledgment belongs to him as Chief of the Law, and in all fpiritual matters. Having taken the Letter, and laid it on his head out of refped, he read it, and looked upon the Seals, and then returning juft before the King, he fell upon his Knees, and made three bows to the ground; by that hum ble pofture declaring his approbation of the Letter, and that the advancement of the Prince to the Empire was legal. While the Spiritual Judge was thus employed, the General defired to know the Kings Refolution, whether he would be Crowned by his own name, or alfume any other before his Co ronation. Who made anfwer, that tho he altered his Condi tion, he would not change his Name, but retain that of Sephii which was given him in his Infancy. The General returned the Kings pleafure to the Ancient of th who was rilen from the Kings Feet, where he had left the Letter, At the lameinftanc therefore, the two Lords, the Anc upon his Right, and the General upon his Left, conduced the Prince to the ChairS o l y m A n III. Periia. ^ Chair of Gold, lb often mentioned before, placed in the middle of the Hall, and then the Ancient befoughc him to take his Place. Which he did, according to the Rules of the Law, wherein he had been inftrucled, with his face toward the i^aahha, or Oratory of Mecca. Then the Ancmit fearing himfelfupon his Heels, which is the Pofture ufed by the Mahumetans when they pray to God, or when they are in theprefence of any Perlons of high Dignity, fome few paces diftant from his Majefty diicovered the Sword and Dagger, and then faid a Prayer to God, which he began with a. fhort Confeffion of their Faith, and concluded with a Bene- diÂ£tion upon the Royal Ornaments appointed for the Ceremony of the Coronation. The Prayer lafted not above a quarter of an Hour iat what time rifing up, he took the Sword and girded it on upon his Majefties Left fide ; and hung the Dagger upon his Right. Then having made a fign to the General to take off the Bonnet from the Kings, head, he put on the Taagh or Diadem, uttering at the fame inftant certain Verfes of the ran proper for the purpofe, which he did before when he girt on the Sword and Dagger. This done he ended, and gave place to the great and learned Doctor already mentioned, who prefented himfelf to perform the Kothe, which word in the Original fig- nifies a Prayer. But by this Prayer is meant a Prayer in form of a Harangue; and perhaps they might give it the name of an Oration. By an ancient Cuftom, time but of mind, thefe Prayers were always to be divided into four Heads; to laft half an hour, and to contain always the fame Form. Only the Orator had the liberty to alter the Terms, and the Stile, and to give a new flight to his thoughts. The firft Head is called Hamde-K^oda, or the becaufe the Orator here Ipeaks of nothing elfe, ' But of the Â« Thanks which we always ought to render him for his Graces ' and Favours, fince there is not that moment wherein we do ' not continually receive fome new mark of his Kindnefs. ' That his Bleffings being like the Sources of great Rivers, ' that flow without ceafing, and never flop their Courfe, for ' which reafon the bleffings of God, are called by the Di- ' vines, Flowing'Blejfmgs, our Thanks therefore ought to be &lt;c continual, and always running. That whatever his Su- ' preme Majefty expofes to the Eyes of Men, whether it were ' m 'mes paft, or now at this prefent, bears the Charaders, &lt;c andThe Coronation ' and imprints the Seals of his affeAion toward lis, and teftifies ' that whatever hearts without hirrtlelf, he does it all for the 'greateft good of Mankind, in regard that Infinite Being is the ' beftof all that do beft. Thefe are their Expreffions, and very near the fenfe of the firft Head, which lafts fome half a tjuarter of an hour. ' The fecondHead is called, Nead Berpegamherhou ve doua/ck ' Imaam j The Vralfe, Remembrance, Aknowledgmmt ' 'Prophet, and of the twelve 'Defendants ' And therefore it contains nothing more than the Acclama- &lt;' tions and Benedidions which they give to perlbns which ' their fuperftition has rendred Venerable among them; That &lt;Â£ you are the Fourteenth whom God has chofen pure and unble- ' mifhed; That he has made them fiicceffively Lords of all ' Mortals. That the Faith is not entire, if together with the ' Confeffion of the Divinity we do not likewile acknowledge ' the lending of thefe Fourteen to be lawful, upon whom the ' Heavenly lights are fhed down, to give light to wandring ' fouls, and to fhew to all the way of Truth. Therefore we ' are obliged to glorifie them, to celebrate their Prailes, towifli ' for their perpetual Welfare and Peace, and to their Family on ' Earth all manner of prolperity: that their names may be ex- ' alted above all Created 'Beings. That Curies may be heaped ' upon their Enemies. And that all the Men in the Univerfe ' may be lead away, and become dull at their Door. With feveral other Willies of the fame nature, which I have rendered as much word for word as is poffible. The third Head is that Royalty is of divine Inftitution. Sel- temet e^Hokkam h^pda, that is, that Upon which they obferve, ' That fince God created the World, ' he has always governed his People by Prophets, and in their 44 ftead by Kings, whom he has eftablifbed their Succeflburs. ' That Kings are the Zel-Alla, or the fhadow of God j which ' is that which we call the Image But the word Image is luch an Expreffion as they abhor as Idolatrous,, a Term which they dare not make ufe of; believing at the fame time, that they likened God to any Image,they fuppofed him at the fame time to be Corporeal. They added withal, 'That as at all times we are obliged to ferre God, and to ' obey him, not only by the light and underftanding which ' Heaven has infufed into us at our Birth, but by the Revela- ' tions which we have had from his Prophets, who havede- ' claredunto us his Will, we are in the fame manner, and by Â« theS o l y m a n III. iQ /g' Pcrfia. a u the fame Revelation bound to obey Kings, as being the J^uhc or Sovereign Lieutenants of God, fitting in his place on Earth, and that we ought to fubmit to their Com- ' mands, without examining whether they be juft or no. In ' regard that in fubmitting to their Commands we Ihbmit 'at the ' fame time to the Holy Books in all things, tho they feem Â« contrary to our Reafon and Underftanding, by which We ' ihewed blind obedience which God exads from men ; fome- Â« times trying our readinefs to fubmit to him, by Commands ' that feem unjuft, to render out fubmiffion more acceptable and ' of greater value. The fourth and laft Point is, Duuhaa-Vreray, padchae, Prayer for the IQng, Â« Which contains a great number of Sup- &lt;Â£ plications for the long life of the prefent Monarch of the Â« Verfmns, for his Health, for the eftablifliment of his Throne c * and the increafe of his Conquefts. That fince this illuftrious ' Branch of the Imaanic Race is according to the true Law be- ' come the Lieutenant of the Monarch of all the Earth, and Â«lawful Lord of the World, that therefore his Dominions ' may extend from the one to the other Pole; That his Majefty ' may always appear furrounded with glory like the Sun. That &lt;Â£ his Word may have a conftraining Power. That all his Wiflies ' and Defires may be accomplifhed; and that all things may ' fucceed in a more glorious manner than ever in favour of ' King S EP HIE.Which laft word the Orator pronounced in a louder Tone than he had pronounced all the reft , to the end that all the Throng might hear him diftinftly. And here it is to beoblerved, that he rofeon purpofe at the end of his Oration, in regard that till then, during all the Ce remony that Name had not been uttered before. But at the fame Inftant that they heard the Name of SEPHIE pronounced, all the whole Affembly ftrove which fliouldfend forth loudeft acclamations of joy by repeating the ufual Jlla, or God grant if, which every one repeated five or fix times. After which the Cheik-el-IJlaam, or Ancient of the Law, was the firft that fell, upon his Knees before the King, and bowing his Forhead three times to his Majefties Feet, pronounced a fecond Benediction in few words, which he concluded with zealous wifhes of Profperity i and that he might fo Reign as to extend the Frontiers of his Dominion, and render his Subjefts happy. He made three Bows more at the Conclufionofhis Harangue, which he uttered with a great deal of Eloquence, as they affured +7 oaffured me,tho he had had no time to prepare himfelf, as having been hurried half afleep out of his Bed to affift at the So lemnity. . . - After him all the Grandees, according to their Dignity , and the reft who were of any Quality came and paid their relpeds to the Monarch with the three cuftomary Proftrations. This done, his Majefty rofe from his Seat of Gold and re turned to his former Place, as did all the reft where they fate be fore. For during the Ceremony they all ftood, there being none that fate but the King. In this manner was Sephie the Second Crown d, his Grand father being the firft of that Name among all the Terfian Mo- narchs. True it is, that the firft Founder of this Race was of the fame Name, but he is not numbred among the 'Perftan Kings, becaufe he was never put into the Catalogue. His Modefty would not llitTcr him to accept the Title. For as the Hiftorians tell us, he always look'd upon the Throne to be an Illuftrious Torment, which under the vain appearances of hap- pinefs concealed continual pain and trouble. This name of Sephie has feveral fignifications which amount to the fame fenle and meaning: for fometimes it fignifies a Friend, fometimes elecled, lometimes pure or Which I have faid turn all to the lame lenfe, for Friends are but perfbns feleded from others, and purified, which is the moft ufual fignification,and is not much remote from the other two. As for example, when the Verfians call ( as they often do) the firft man Adam SapeJlla, we may tranflate it the Man, the Friend, or the EleSl, or the 'Purified o Which three Epithites agree very well in their fignification. For the friends of God are his Elect : Nor can they be his Eled before he hath purified them. And therefore it is according as the word is placed, that fometimes it fignifies one thing, fometimes another. As here for example, Ipeaking of the New King of the I fhould rather chule to tranflate Chae Safie, the Kjng EleH, than the JQn^ purified. True it is, that they who would have Safie to fignifie purified, depend upon the Etymology; For that the Root from whence Safe is derived is which properly fig nifies 'Purity. But let this fuffice fot playing the Grammarian. The fubjed; of my difcourfe will not permit me to ftop any longer upon thele Trifles, but only to oblerve by the way, that it was from the word Safie that the Greeks borrowed the word Sophos. It will be more to the purpofe to obierve the miftake of our Writers upon the word Safie. For they would have all the Ov5 O L Y M A N III, /y/;a- Perfia. the Kings of ^erfuno be called So^s. I cannot buTk^Wh^' ifind in their Writings the Grand S and the Sovereign Sophy. For the Kings of Terfta are neither called Sophies in general, nor in particular. Could the Kings of read our European Characters, and fliould fee upon the Letters that are Written to them from fome parts of the Title which is given them of Sophy, queftionlefs they Would fpic up on them, and take it for an affront, r Therefore I would have thofe that Ipeak, when occafion offers, oi Terfta, or whether they be the Minifters of Princes to be careful how they commit this miftake in their Difpatches' to that Court: or whether they be thofe Writers who profefs to give a faithful Relation of a Country where they profeis them- ielves to have been, and pretend to tell us what they have feen with their Eyes, yet vent a thoufand Lies and Stories, and over- conndently impofe upon their Readers; I fay I would have fuch perfons content thcmfelves with only giving us the falfe names of things, but that the things themfelves fhould be really true. Neverthelefs I find that in thofe things they make very grofs miftakes ; and therefore left people may think I decry others to gain the more credit to my own Relations j and to free my felf from the lafh of the Proverb, Th I flhall for proof of what I affert, bring an Example relating to this very Story it felf, which I fliall not take out of any Book of Travels, (for it is not my Intention hereto attack any one of â€¢them ) but from the Judir of Jddref wherein there is a relation of the Death of the late King of and of the Coronation of the prefent King,/o/. 523. I cannot conclude without imparting to you the news Â£c which we have received from the Court of by Letters ' from Legorn, the fifth of this Month. ' They tell us by an Exprefs difpatched from l/pahan the ' Englifli Merchants refiding in that the after a ' debauch of drinking, fell fick at KJ;ur y in his return from ' Cashin, and died four days after. That after his Death was ' known, in the City of Ifpahan, his Eldeft Son, about twen- ' ty years of Age, was Proclaimed by the Principal Minifter ' and other Officers, by the name of Grandfather Sha-Sophy. a That the next day the Governour of and the chief ' Lords of the Court, who accompanied the Body of the de- &lt;c ceafed King, being arrived, and having paid their Homage ' to the Prince, he ihewed himfelf in publick to his Subjects, ' who teftified their joy by their loud Acclamations; and G gggÂ§The Coronatio TT^afterwards he received the accuftomed Preients of the Â« Nobility, as alfo of the Agents of England, and Â« They add that feveral days were fpent in feafting and re- Â« iovcing by publick Proclamation, with a more than ordinary - Magnificence as being a thing which they faw pleafed thehu- ' mour of the Prince, who they fay is more addicted to Ex- Â« pences than his Father, and that he having given Audience Â« to the fame Agents, he had promifed a Confirmation of the Â« Priviledges which his Predeccflors had granted them; and ' alio to enlarge them, as he fliould fee occafion. Had the Author of this News ftudied to frame atalleltory, he could not have contrived it better 5 for that he fpeaks no thing of truth. This Exprefs which they aflure us to have been difpatched from Ifpahan to Legorn, is a-meer Fantome. Not one of the Englifli ever difpatched any perfon in all that time nor at any other time ; I do not know that indeed they ever difpatched directly any Perlon from the Capita City of fta t o that Port of Italy. Nor did ever that Monarch of the fians, whom they fo confidently call ever go by that name in his own Country, nor any other like it. Whereas he fays, that the King fell fick of a debauch, and diedfour days alter, it is of the fame ftamp with the reft. He did not fall fick of a debauch 5 neither did his diltemper carry.him off in four days; for he lay in a languiftimg con dition four Months and more. The place which the Relation- calls Ityur, where he fays the King died, is a perfect Chtmra. I have examined all my Terfian Geography, and can find no fuch place, either great or fmall, that is called by that name. As little of truth there is in what he farther adds, that it was in the Kings return from Casbin that he died. For the King had not been at Cashin in eight years before 5 but it was from the Cafptan Sea that he was then coming back, as has been already related in the Life of that great Monarch. The Author of the Relation paffing forward to theEledion of his Succeffour, goes on with the fame fincerity as before. For the news of the deceafed Kings death was not known in before the Coronation of his Succeflbur, unlefs it were to feme few perfons of the higheft Quality 5 nor was the Suc ceffour proclaimed in that City by the Prime Minifter, nor any other of the Prime Minifters of State, who were a hundred and forty Leagues off at that time. There are no publick Pro- clamations in that Country as among us. Nor was he pro- &gt;, claimedS o l y m a n 111. Pcrfia. claimed, as his Grandfather is pretended toâ–  have been, under the name of Sha -Sophi, fince neither the one nor the other ever bore that Name. That which follows after, ' That theGovernour of Ifpahan, and the principal Lords of the Court, who accompanied the Corps of the deceafed, being arrived there, and having paid ' their accuftomed Homage, hefhew'd himfelf in publick co his Â« Subjects, who teftified their joy by their loud and extraordi- ' nary Acclamations. 1 his whole Period, I fay, contains as many impertinencies as there are words. The Governour of Ifpahan never left the City; lo that he could not then be laid to return the next Morning; nor was the Body of the deceafed King ever brought thither, as being a thing that was never intended. Then for the Lords that accompanied the Corps, the firfl that came to the Court did not come till within twenty days after, others not till thirty or forty. And as for the Acclamations of joy which he mentions, I heard none but thofe of which I have already given an account; and yet I was prefent at the whole Cere mony, fb that no body could be a better Witnefs than my felf. Nor did the Intelligencer know any better which of the Agents, whether the Englif?, French, or Holland Agent had his firft Au dience of the New King, or what Prefents they made him, of which we fliall give an account in the feries of our Difcourfe. Let the Reader now judge, what credit there is to be given to Relations, which are fuppofed to have been fent to that Country, which are only grounded upon uncertain Reports, and Letters of Merchants and Travellers written without judgment, who upon occafion, ipeakingof other Affairs touch upon fomethingthat was tranfadled in that Country. But now to return to our bufinefs. After the^Young King, and thole that flood of each fide were returned to their Places, the General of the Mufquetteers having whifpered fbme few Minutes in the Kings Ear, among feveral other things of lefler Importance, gave out thefe four principal Commands in his Ma- jefties name. Firfl,That both the foft and loud Mufick fiiould play in the two Balconies upon the top of the great Building, which flands at one end of the Palace Royal, called the/Qw/dnV, 'Place. No Nation was difpenfed with,whether 'Perfians,Indians, Turks,Mufcovites,Europeans,or others,which wasimmediately done. And this fame Tintamarr or Confufion of Inflruments, which founded more like the noife of War than Mufick, lafled twenty Ggggg 2 d^ysThe Coronatio days tosecher without intermiffion, or the interruption of Night. Which dumber of twenty days was obferved to anfwer the number of the Young Monarch's years, who-was then twenty ye The fecond was, that the Palace fliould be furnifhed with ufual Guards, to the fame Number, and in the ufual Places as in the time of the deceafed Monarch. The third was, that they fliould go and deface the Name of Bah as out of all the Seals and Signets of State, which are all of Precious Stones, which were brought from Court, in a Purfe fealed up with the Prime Minifters Seal, and that the Name of Sephie ftiould be engraved in the room of the other. That if in any of the Seals the Name of Hahas could not be conveni ently Erafed, that the engraving fliould be entirely taken away, to make room for another Sculpture upon a new Superficies j or if the Pieces were fo delicate that they could not endure de facing, that they fhould be broken to pieces, and new ftones be engraved. The fourth, That all the old Coins and Stamps fliould be broken, and other new Money made with the Name of thepre- fent Prince upon it. And that care fliould be taken to coin with all fpeed againft the next day between fixfeore and a hun dred and forty Tomans, which amount to between five or fix hundred pounds fterlingof our Money. This was done with that fpeed that the Sum was ready the next day in great Pieces, as is ufual, to the value of eighteen pence, for the King to beftow as he pleafed himfelf. The fame day one of thefe Pieces came to my hands; and the Perfon from whom I had it affured me, that there had been fome of the fame bignefs coined in Gold, which I am apt to believe, tho I never faw any. Round about the Edge were engraved the twelve names of Mahomet's Succeffours, with thefe words in the middle, Bende, Shae-dm-Safie-eft; 7k Sove the World according to the true Law Safie. We have in another Pkce explained thefe Infcriptions more exadly and literally. On the other fide was this Perftan Di- ftich: - V Zihad Deftidfhae Aha* fank, Safie %adZikkeh ,faheh That is, Jfter Hahas the Second Corforeal Or thus : Afterb o l y m a n III, K^ing oj' Perfia 7 HabdsthSmrii qmtted Mafler the World couud this Money, Which is as much as to lay, He was declared King, in regard that in thofc Countries, as well as here, none but Sovereigns can coin Money. . 5 Underneath were thefe words : Zarhy fefaham haftad ou ricjtj Coined at Ilpahan the yeur of the Hcgirah 1077. It was almoft near Midnight before the Ceremony ended. At what time the Kingrofe up in his Royal Habiliments, which he did not put off till he was retired into his particular Apart ment in the Womens Palace. All the while there was to be ob served a great alteration in the Countenance of the Young Prince. He looked with a Countenance all in diforder, like a Perlon that was not well in his Senles. And indeed what other could be expefted from aPerfonthat had been all along mued up under a dole confinement, and had never feen the World ? Befides that by a fecret Fatality of the ill humour of his Father, he had been fhut up in a more rigorous Impnlotv ment,than ever was pradiled before toward the Kings Children ? Could he obferve a certain Pofture of Majefty, that fliould have performed all things after a furprizing manner, who had never been inftrudted before ? Much leis, was he able to make any Refkaions upon himfelf. Add to this, that the Young Prince paffed of a fudden from one Extremity to another. He heard himfelf called Mafter of the He that but a little be fore was in condition little inferiour to that of a Slave. True it is, that he wanted for no Conveniences in his Captivity, which was accompanied with all the Pleafures grateful to the Senfes j but thole Plealures became Torments^ whenfowered with the continual fears of Death, or deprivation of his Eyes that continu ally threatned him. And this was that which made him he could not tell what to do. For what may we fay of that laft affault that attacked his very Soul? How many dilmal Apparitions did the dreadful Cries and frantick Lamentations of his Mother and his Wives, and others of the fame Sex prefent to his Mind His Soul, to Ipeak after the Terjtan manner, was like a Sea, which being agi tated by a furious Tempeft, expreffes its dilbrder by the roaring of the Waves, and fhews the difturbancc it was in after the Storm is over, and tho a pleafing Calm fucceed. The Grand Dutchels ( for that Title is given to the Mother of the New King from the very moment of her Sons being Crowned )was not in a wotfe Gondition. They had told her theThe Coronatio the very firft words which the General of the Mufquetteers had uttered, throwing himfelf at her Sons Feet: they brought her the news every Minute of what paffed. But Fear and Grief had (b poffeffed her Imagination that there was no entrance for any other Paffion. It was above a quarter of an hour before fhe would fo much as liften to the welcome news which they brought her; fherefufed obftinatelyto believe. And tho fhe had luch forcible reafons to rejoyce, ftie ftill continued weeping and lamenting according to the humour of her Sex, that are willing to dwell upon forrowful Objeds, and wilfully refufe to put away thofe Idea's from their Minds. However at length fo many Eunuchs came to tell her the news of the Death of her Husband, and the Election of her Son, for whofe Corona tion they were preparing, that flic began to lend an Ear, and to furceafe her fears. Neverthelefs her Soul continued ftill in fufpence between Joy and Grief: For as the good Fortune of her Son and his Exaltation afforded her a happy occafion of Gladnefs, fo the mournful death of her Husband recalled her Tears: So that thofe two Paffions equally prevailing in her heart kept the ballance fo even that her joys and forrows hung in an equal Poife. But at length Cuftom and good Manners turn'd the Scales. So that for a while flie relapfed into her firft Commotions: fhe rent her Garments, calling upon the Soul of the Deceafed, expoftulating with him as if he had been pre- fent, what reafon he had to quit the World and leave her in that forlorn condition; with other moans and lamentations of the fame nature. However fhe gave over when flie under- ftood that the King her Son was returning to her. Thereupon, after fhe had performed the ufual Ceremonies of Purification which the Law ordains, fhe changed her Habit, as did the Prin- cels the New Monarchs Wife, with the reft of the Ladies of Qual ity that belonged to the Court, to receive the King, who till then had lived among them as a Prifoner. So loon as they had notice that the New King was entered into their Palace, they went all to meet him. The Great Dutchels was the firft that paid her duty to him upon her Knees, bowing her Head three times to the ground; which done, his Wife and his Concubines did the lame; and then the reft of the Perfons belonging to the Place, whofe Quality and Employ ments priviledged them for that Honour. I could not learn what was done more the reft of the Night: for I have already informed you how difficult it is to be informed of the Tranf- a&amp;ions in thofe fecret Habitations, that feem to be RegionsS ol ym a n HI. o/'perfiaT' of another World. There are none bur Wom^fTat ^m Tp: proachwithm a League of it, or fome Black Eunuchs, wkh whom a Man may as well converfe with fo many Dragons that can difcover thofe fecrets and you may as well tear out their hearts, as a fyllable upon that Text.

And in regard it continued longer than ordinary, which is generally not above three Quarters of an Hour, it gave an occafion to thofe that were wakened with the din to wonder what was the matter But in regard it was then Midnight, and an unfeafonable time tollir out of the Houfe there were very few, unlefs they were fuch as lived near the Royal Palace that would fo far gratifie their Cunofity as to enquire the Reafon. The reft contented them- leiyes tiU next Morning, at what time they underftood that Sa- phtethe Second was feated upon the Throne as Succelfour to his father Habas decealed. 1 leave the Reader to conjecture how every body was furpri- f F( ? r '7 P arc 1 apprehended fomething fo ftrange upon Je novelty of the Accident, that I thought my felf in a dream. That they could conceal the Death of fo great and Potent a Prince fo long, and yet that it fhould not be known till after the Son was feated upon the Throne and adually Crowned, of which I had never read the like Example. But this was one Mafter-piece of the Verfim Wifdom, never too much to be commended. By means of which Addrefs, the State changed its Malta, without any alteration in Form ; and fliffered one of the moft dangerousRefolutions without being fenfible of it,- info- much that in all Ifpahau there did not appear the leaft fign of Con- fternation. They heard without any difturbance that Hahas was dead without making a Will, and with fatisfadion received the Perfon whom they had Elefted in his Place. There was no body that appeared either very lad or overjoyed: No body that plaid the Cenfurer to find fault with what was done, much lefs any one that was mutinous. For all things ran in their ufual Courle. The Merchants opened their Shops as they did the day before, and every one followed their Occafions, as little con cerned as if no fuch thing had hapned., Methought that then I/pahan was/one of the Places Repub- lick, above the reach of Fortune, and exempted from thofe Ac cidents that trouble the Tranquillity of Mortals. OurThe Coronation ' Our Europeans only took the Alarm upon the news of this great and Hidden Revolution, and they that were in their Houfes in the City kept their doors fliut all the firft part of the Morning. Among the reft the who were retired to their own Home, to the number of Forty. With them was M. Hubert de LureJ^c, who was lent by the Orders of the land Company in the Quality of an Embafladour to the de- ceafed King with Commiffions and Prefents for his Majefty, He was then juft about to return; but underftanding the Change, he who having been long employed by the had been in feveral parts of India, and had there feen upon the death of Princes ftrange Commotions, and dangerous Seditions, wherein many Murders and Roberies had been with impunity commit ted ;He, I fay, made cautious by this hazardous Experience, was not a little fearful of the lame Confequences of fuch a Change, and therefore advifed the Dutch to keep in, to prevent the evil Accidents of mutinies upon fuch occafion in hopes of Booty and Pillage. But the Ingenuity of the and the Excellency of their Government might have fpared him thofe Fears. However when the Superiour of the brought him word about nine of the Clock in the Morning that all was quiet, that he might no longer dilcover his miftruft of the Publick Security; he ordered the Doors to be opened. This Superiour of the Capuchins was the Reverend Father of Mans. At the lame time the New M coming out of the Inner part of his Palace, went and late in the great Hall where he Was Crowned the Night before, and then it was that all the Gran dees, who were then at Jfpahan qualified to receive that Ho nour, were admitted to kils the ground before his Feet. This Ceremony lafted till ten of the Clock; at what time his Ma jefty rifing from his Seat took Horle; and that was the firft time that ever he rode out of the Place where he was born. And according to the Cuftom of the he made a Cavalcade round his Palace very leifurely, and with little attendance, riding in the middle at the diftance of twenty Paces from them that marched before, and thofe that followed after, only twelve Footmen went of each fide, before and behind his Horle ; and all this to the end he might be the better leen by the People. His Majefty had-on a Cab aye, Veftof Sattin and Silver, thick powdered with Violets; the forepart of which upon his Breaft was adorned with long Rows of Pearls and Diamonds, fix of each fide. Over his, Veft he wore a fhort JuJiacoreSol ym a n III. Perfia. without Sleeves of Cloath of Gold^J^h&amp;: bles. Upon htsnght fide ftuck h.s Dagger, of which the Sheath and Hilt were fet with Emeralds and other Precious Stones: nor was his Sword lefs gorgeoufly erabellifted. Upon his Head he wore a Terfian Cap or Uul-bandt, made of very fine Silk and Gold, with a Royal Heron-Tuft faftened before in a Rofe of Diamonds and Rubies. The People from all Parts flock together in Heaps to fee their New Sovereign ; who not being accuftomed to lee fuch Sholes of People,as having always live! remote from Noife and Hurry, feemed, as he had done at the Coronation Ceremony, to look like one that knew not well how to behave himfelf, as being not a little dazled with fo much ludden fplendour. However he ftill looked up, fo that all might fee his Eyes, where fweetnefs fate intermixed with Majelty, which immediately begat both Love and Re ftape'd ^ dld a11 the 0f hiS B0dy Was exa&lt;al y His Stature was Tall, and withal proportionable and grace ful; his Face was round, with a pleafing Air in his Lineaments, a little marked with the Small Pox. His Eyes blue his Hair white, which he therefore dyed black, as being the colour moft efteemed by the Terfans. They who know that all the fol lowers of Mahomet fhave their Hair, will underftand that I mean the hair of his Beard, which at thole years began to fpread its early Down upon his Lips and Cheeks, wherein he was very like his Father, only that he had not fo long a Nofe, nor fo full and open an Eye. The whitenefs of his Complexion which the Sun had not at all altered as yet, had fomething in it' which I cannot exprefs, that was extremely charming. In a word,there was nothing in the Prince which did not then appear very graceful. I fay, then; for now be is very much changed and ftill changes everyday. ' His Majefty having been an Hour abroad returned into the Womens Apartment, from whence he did not ftir out all that day, after he had given Orders, or rather Leave to the General of the Mufquetteers, and the Na^ir Eunuch 5 who were then his chiefeft Favourites, to difpatch fuch bufinels as required haft. ^ He did nothing more all the reft of that day, nor was there any other Pomp or Show, contrary to the general expectation. For the King was willing to defer the time of Publick Reioycing till all the Court fliould be arrived at Ifpahan. In the mean while, there was no alteration to be feen in the City; The HhhhhThe Coronation follovved their bufmefs in the oublick Streets, and the Markets were kept till a little before kiaht And this was obferved not only in the but over all that Vaft Empire. So that this great Revolution made no change either in the Eftate or Bufmefs of any Perfon It was an abfolute Calm, for which we may give two Reafons The one was the Prudence of the Great who underftood fo well to conceal the Death of the deceafed Monarch : The other was the abfolute Authority of the Kings of and the terrible Awe that Superftition infules into the People. At the bare Command of the Prince the higheft in Dignity come and offer their Heads, andfubmit themfelvestothe ftroke ol Death, without daring to prefume to ask the reafon why ? In this manner, nobody appeared eitherpenfive or gladj no body difcovered the leaft fign of difcontent. Not but that I believe there were feveral who concealed their forrows, tor rear of offending the New King. They confidered that Habas the Second of whofe death they had fo lately heard, was fit to govern j that he was kind and gentle to his Subjects ,â€¢ that he was lared abroad; but kept all things in peace and tranquillity at home That he was a lover of Juftice, and took care that his Officers did not abufe their Authority, and oppreG the People; neverthelefs, that afecret Providence had cut him off in the midft of fo fair a Race, and in the flower of his Age, when he had ftreneth of judgment to defign, and force of body to execute. That on the contrary, the Young Prince who was now afcended to the Throne, had never feen any thing, and was as it were but an Apprentice, not only in the AÂ£t of Government, but in all other minces. So that they were likely to fuffer long through the tendernefs of his Age, as they had experienced before in the Reigns of his Predeceffors upon the fame grounds. But they who moft laid to heart the mournful death of the deceafedKing, were the Chriftians. That Prince had always (hewed himfelf kind and favourable to their Religion, ihewing them extraordinary Civilities, and rebuking the Mmifters of the Law, and Interpreters of the Akoran, when they fought to ex- afperate him agamft the Profeffors of our Religion. Which he did more than once j as we do relate in his Life; infomudh as the Ammums would fay one among another, that â€¢he was more a Chriftian than a Not bnt that he was very much devoted to his own Religion, even as much as the moft zealous of his Predeceffors 5 only he thought that the violence of Princes toward the Liberty of mens Confciences waswas a thing neither Acceptable to God, nor conformable to Realbn.That he was not to ceafe being a Man becaufe he was a Mahometan ; That if Providence had exalted him to a Throne, it was that he Ihould carry himfelf like a King, and not like a Tyrant: and that there was nothing more Barbarous nor Tyrannical, than fuch a Condud as not only violated the Law of Nations, but of Nature alfo; which defire that men ftiould live in Society one with another, fo far from being at Enmity that they fhould be mutual Affiftances one to another. Laftly, that God alone was the Lord of the Confcience, and Mafter of the Will: That for his part he had nothing to do but with the outward Government ol the Kingdom ; and for that reafon it became him to do Juftice to all his Subjeds of whatfoever Religion, fince they were all Members of his King dom. 5 He perfifted ib conftantly in this judgment and opinion, that notwithftanding all the endeavours of the Doctors of thzMaho- metan Superftition to incenfe him againft the Chriftians, they could never vanquifh his Relblution. He looked upon them as People whofe falfe zeal rendred them incapable of Right Reafon; or as Perfons byaifed by Intereft, who under the fpe- cious pretence of Religion would make themfelves great among the Multitude; or elle make ufe of the credit which they had already, to make Parties, and Faftions in the Kingdom, and difturb the Government. And therefore he always took delight to leflfen and contemn fuch fort of people. This clearly appeared, when he prevented the Creation of a new Sadre, or Mahometan fo or Metropolitan of the whole Empire, inipefls into all the Ecclefiaftical Revenues which are managed by inferiour Officers under his Authority, and by his Orders: for the word Sadre fignifies the Breaft of the Law. Habas the Second alfo had leverely perfecuted the Cheik-el-IJtaam, or Ancient of th who is another Sovereign in fpiritual Affairs. For it is his bufinefs to take cog nizance of, and to refolve all Cafes of Confcience in Matters of Religion as we have already obferved. The Kincr had like to have condemned him to death, upon an Information, that fome of the Interpreters fliould whiiper one among another, that it would be the bell way to advance to the Throne one of the Sons of the Ancient of the Law, who would be more zealous for their Religion, than the prefent Monarch ; and he had certainly put his defign in execution, had not the pre vented him by offering to his difpleafure both his own and the Hhhhh 2 headsThe Coronation Head of all his Children that attended him. That fpeiftacle ap- peafed his wrath ; believing that perfon innocent whom hefaw fo lowly humbled before him. He had alfo thrown out of favour his or Chap- lain, and Confelfor; for no other reafon but becaufe he continu ally declaimed againft the Chriftians. The Prime Minifter of State that governed during the Mino rity of Habds, was no lels averfe to the Chriftians than any of the reft, as being a zealous Mahm; and therefore he con tinually incenfed his Mafter againft them, and would have had the King have given command that they fhould carry a Mark, like the Jews,to diftinguifh them from Mahumetans but the King continually denied him; and it is reported that the dif- guft which he took againft him for that very thing contributed not a little to his Fall. After thefe great Examples of his Lenity, the Prince being now become more abfolute, not only fuffered the Chriftians to enjoy the free exercife of their Religion; but alfo granted the lame freedom to the Jews; notwithftanding all the fecret and publick oppofition, which the Mor Religious People could make. Nay, it hapned that the King took an occafion todc- preisall that Race of Hypocrites. For being lb tranlported as they were to talk of depofing him, as an Infidel, who kept too much Society with the Profane, the fecret hatred which he bare them from that time forward gave him a plaufible pre tence to ftiew his refent, and that I may ufe the 'Perfian Phrafe, to break their Teeth, that is to lay, to prevent their Biting. As to the Armenians who were his Subjeds, and profeffed the Chriftian Religion,he was wont to tell the Grandees of the King dom, thatitwould bea vilelnjuftice, for People that laboured for the good of the Kingdom, by their Induftry and Commerce, to be excluded from the enjoyments of Peace and that Plenty of which they were the principal Inftruments. Therefore it was not without juft caufe that the Chriftians mourned in their hearts for the lols of lb good a Prince: their misfortune leemed to be without remedy, in regard the New Monarch, whom they faw exalted in his room, was but a young Man, from whom they could not promife to themfelves any thing of aflurance; and tho he fhould be favourably en- clined, and preferve the fame kindnels for them as his Prede- ceifour, he could not, in regard of his want of experience, long continue his good Intentions, by reafon of the daily Importuni-S o l y m a n III. Perfia. 61 ties of his Counfellours, and the perpetual clamours of the ter prettrs of the Alcoran, and the Doftors of the Law. Befidesthat, a Prince of his Age could not well tell where to find a more expert perfon to be his Confident than the General of the Mufquetteers, who was a terrible Enemy of the Chriftians, as well out of his one natural humour, as for that he hated the Superiutendant, whom the Chriftians had for a long time looked upon as their Protestor at Court. But among all the Chriftians none were more afflided for the death of the late King than or Europeans : They had the fame reafons for their forrow with the Native Chrifti ans, ( for the Mahumetans make no diftinftion between the feveral Seds among us) but there was oneReafon of greater Impor tance. For that they were ftrangers, remote from their Coun try, and could not lubfift where they were without the favour of the Sovereign Prince, As for the deceafed King, he had ex tended his favours toward them in a high meafure: he had ufed them more like a Father than a Friend : and his publick affefti- on begat them relpedl: and honour in all Societies. But they could not hope for any fuch favours from his Succeftbur. Their condition under the deceafed King was too advantageous, that â–  they flhould prefume to afpire to that degree again: rather they expected that the change of the Prince would be the change of their good fortune into bad. At the time of this doleful Revolution, there was at the Dutch Embafladour, as I have already oblerved, M. bert tk Latreffe; being fent from by the Order, and on the behalf of the Holland Company, with confiderable Pre- fents for the King and his Principal Minifters, with a defignto renew their Alliance,and to requeft certain Favours of his Majefty, in reference to their Trading in his Dominions, which was interrupted as well by the Governour ofF^rr, which isproperlv Terfa, as the Officers of the famous Port of Bender-Haba/ji, or Habas's Tort or Market, (for that the the firft King of that name was the firft that made it a Place of Trade } to tranlport their Merchandize from Ommto that Place, which is over againft it, and in a more commodious fituation : where the Hollanders have their principal Fa&amp;ory. The Embaffadour arrived at Court in July ; and at his firft coming had his Audi ence in the Valley of Saver in the Province ot Ma^endat aan ; four Leagues from the Cafpian Sea and twelve from Efter- abaat. And he followed his bufinefs fo clofe, and managed it (b well, that in five Weeks he was dilpatched, and obtained of hisThe Coronation hiTMajefty whatever he defired. In he returned to Ifpahan, laden with joy, for the extraordinary favours which he had received, as well in the behalf of the Company, as for the honour had been done to his own Perfon. He intended to be gone in Ottoher, becaufe he was obliged to take poffeffion at Bender-Jba* of the Employment of and to look after other affairs of the Company in in the room of the Heer Henry Wuan Vick, dead between three and four Months before. Allthings were ready for his Journey, and the fourth of OBober was the day prefixed. But this great and unexpected Change which the death of Haha* the Second, and the Election o(Sej)lne theSecond brought,put a ftop to all bufmefs. Nor was it a fmall trouble to him when he firft heard the news, as well for the great love and efteem which he had for that Mo narch who had obliged him with fo many favours, as for that he knew the Accident fell out unluckily for the Profit of his Mailers. ^ _ Firft He found that the long and tedious Umbaiiie to the de- ceafed King, which he had accomplifhed fo much to his fa- tisfadion, would be altogether fruitlefs: for that the Compa ny would be conftrained upon this Change to fend another new Embaffie to congratulate the ISlew King upon his coming to the Crown. In the next place he found, that all that he had ob tained at Court with lb much trouble and expence muft be all loft; fince all the kindnelfes granted by would be in effectual, without an exprefs and authentick confirmation of the Rebnins Prince, which would prove as difficult to obtain as the firft Decree. Laftly, he reflected upon the Favours and Pri- viledges which jHahdshad granted to the Company whicn he ferved, and by which he had been fent; all which he faw loft, without knowing what to hope from his SuccefTour, whofe Youth, and want of Experience, not underftanding the Interefts of State, might eafily be fwayed by the byaffed Counfels of fome Grandees, who minding nothing but their particular pro fit would advife him perhaps to what might prove to the dilad- vantageof the Company. i i - â€¢ j Thefe confiderations and reflections very much dikjuieced the Embaifadours Mind. But in regard it was high time to apply a Remedy to thefe Inconveniencies, he advifed with thole perfons that were of his Council, and having examined the prefent Conjuncture, he relolved as foon as poffibly he could to go and kifs the New Kings Feet, to the end he might prevent the reft of the Europeans^ by having the honour to lee the NewS o l v m a n III. Perlia. New King before them; and then to try whether he could obtain a Confirmation of all thePriviledges granted by his Pre- decetTours to the Company and the Nation. This Relblution taken, the Embaffadour fent after Dinner the Interpreter belonging to the Dutch Houfe in Jfpahan to the General of the Mufquetteers, the only perfon that could at that time procure his Audience, in regard he was the only Perlbn upon whom the New King relied, for what he fhould do or lay in matters of State. The interpreters Inftruftions were,' That afer ' he had moft humbly laluted the General in the Name ol the ' Eraba{radour,he fliould befeech him earneftly to reprefent to his a Majefty the Splendour, Reputation, and Power of the noble ' Company (thofe were terms he ufed) which his Majefty ' had all the realbn to gratifie to his utmoft, in regard of the Â£C great Trade which they drove in the Terfian Dominions. ' Moreover, to let him underftand how highly the faid Com- ' pany was efteemed by his Predecelfours, Huhas the Great of ' glorious Memory, Sephk the Firft, the Second, who ' had granted them particular favours, and always honoured ' them with their Protection. That not long fince, the ' of 'Batavia in acknowledgment of the generous Affe&amp;ion ' which the Monarchs of 'Perjta had from time to time teftified ' for them, they had deputed to kifs the feet of the King now ' gone to Heaven the fleer Hubert with confiderable ' Prefents. That the laid Embaffadour had been well re- &lt;c ceived by the faid Monarch, who had not refufed him any ' thing which he requefted : and that the fame EmbalTadour after ' lb favourable a difpatch, being juft ready to return, had re- ceived the News of the King his Fathers death, and of his ' advancement iothe Throne. ' That thereupon he had refolved not to leave the Kingdom, ' before be had had the honour to kils his Majefties Feet, and ' to appear before him with that humility which became him. ' And that he had not any Prefents worthy his acceptance, be- ' caufe he had made an offering of all that he brought along ' with him to the deceafed King of glorious Memory, to ' whom his moft Illuftiious Majefty was now Succeffour, and ' his Prime Minifters of State, and therefore he hoped his Ma- ' jefty would be fo indulgent as to excufe him, and permit ' him the honour which he with all humility requefted. Laft- ' ly, That he fhould befeech the General of the Mufquetteers ' to ufe his Intereft to obtain leave for hjm with the fboneft that ' he could, to the end he might prefent himfelf at the feet of ?c theThe Coronat 'the new Monarch, and be favoured with a quick difpatch ; Â« I n regard the death of the Director his Predeceflbur, and fe- 'veral other weighty Affairs called him away in hafte to the &lt;( &lt;Port of Habas. That if he would give himfelf the trouble to ' procure that Audience the next day, he would promifehima Â« becoming Acknowledgment, affuring him that the Company Â« would always be ready to remunerate his favour, and be for ' ever obliged to his kindnefs. With thefe InftruAions the Interpreter went to the the Mujquetteers, and having the opportunity to fpeak to him in private by himfelf, laid before him all his Ipecious Arguments according to his diredions. But while he had no other dif- courle but plaulible pretences and excufes, they made no Im- preflion upon the covetous Warriour, who pretending igno rance, or perhaps becaufe he was really ignorant of thofe affairs, made anfwer that he could determine nothing pofitive in thofe matters, and therefore he muft be content to ftay till the Court returned to Ifpahan. But when the Interpreter began to add to his Reafons the Pro- mife of a becoming Acknowledgment, the Luftre of Gold cafl fuch a powerful reflexion upon his Lordly fenfes, that he pre- fently found himfelf infpired with a new accefs of knowledge and underftanding ; fo that there was not any one fcruple that interrupted his performance. He condefcended to the Em- baffadours Requeft, and knew lb well how to manage his bufinefs, that in the Evening he fent for the lame Interpreter, and gave him Order to promife his Maftcr,in his Majeflies Name, that he fliould be admitted to morrow about ten in the Morning to kifs his Majefties Feet. The fame day at the time appointed, the Dutch Embaffa- dour, with two more of the Company, the chief Factor of Ifpahan, and the Secretary of the Embaffie, together with the Interpreter attended at the Palace in an Apartment next to that where the King was Crowned. Where he had ftaid but a few Minutes before he had notice to advance forward to the Place where the King tarried: whither fo foon as he was come with all his Train, the General of the Mufquetteers, who fupplied the Office of Grand Porter, or Mafter of the Ceremonies, con ducted him from the Door of the great Hall before his Maje- fty, at the diftance of two Paces from whom, the Embaffa- dour and the two other Perfbns with him made their Obeyfances according to the Cuftom of the ( Perjlans, which is to kifs the ground three times before his Majeflies Feet.

When they had made their Reverence, and were permitted to fit, the Embaffadour by his Interpreter began with the Prayers and Wiflies of Governour General of Batavia. for the honour and proiperity of his Majefty upon his happy coming to the Crown. For which the King returned him Thanks, and added at the Conclufion, My Lord Embajfadour have any favour torequeji, let him Thereupon the Dutch EmbalTadour took an occafion to proceed, and gave the King to underftand in few words, the Priviledges which his Anceftors had all along granted to the Company j from the firfttime that they came to relide in till that day, re- quefting the fame Protea,ion from his Majefty; an Auchen- tick Confirmation of all the Agreements and Decrees already made in favour of the Company, and a continuation of the fame Kindnelfes. His Majefty replied. My Lord Cuefl and Friend, as alfo all of your Nation; and I will redoublethe favours and kindneffes which my memory done your Company. Upon which the Dutch Embalfadour made a profound Reverence^ as did alio the other two that accom panied him, and replied to the King's obliging words in this manner.

Thofe laft words included his laft leave, which they alio took, with mod fubmiffive Obeyfances after the man ner, the moft relpeÂ£tful that could be imagined. And thus they retired after an Audience of three quarters of an Hour. About Four in the Afternoon, they lent their Interpreter to the General of the Mulquetteers to return him Thanks for the Trouble he had given himfelf, in procuring them fo favourable an Audi ence, and for the continuance of his kindnefs they belbught him to accept as a pledge of their farther acknowledgment a Silver Watch, and fifty Ducats of Gold. The Englifli Agent in 'Perfta, Sir Flowre, uuderlland- ing that the Dutch had had Audience of his Majefty, was not a little lurpriled, but much more vexed to fee himfelf prevented and therefore he was no lefs importunate to have his; and therefore, to the end he might be admitted to kifs the Kings Feet, he took the fame way and method which the Dutch Em- baffadour had done : for indeed there was no-other way: and had therefore the fame fuccefs. For two days after, being accompanied with his Second in the Factory, about Nine of the Clock in the Morning he was introduced by the Mufquptteers to make his Obeyfance to the King; his Interpreter and his Collegue coming behind him. After the nfual Cere monies he prefented the Prince with two hundred half Guineys, according to the felf-interefted Cuftom of the Eaft, where the Kings ftiling themfelves Gods Lieutenants, forbid all People to appear in their Prefence without an Offering. Prefendy he fate down by the Command of the Prince,and bv his Interpreter, and in the behalf of the Englifli Nation and Company,wiflied hiift a long and flourifliing Reign. Afterwards he made a Oioft rehearfal of the great Services which the Englifh Nation had done the Kings of 'Perfia his Anceftors of Immortal memory. For which reafbn thofe Triumphant Monarchshad always fa voured the Englifh Nation more than any other Nation of rope, of which he was affured his Majefty was well informed ; for which reafbn he hoped that his Majefty would continue the fame favours to the Englifli Nation,and grant them a Confirma tion of all the Treaties and Priviledges which had been granted formerly to the Englifh. ' ToS o lyman III. Perlla To which the King returned the fame anfwer which he had donetotheOutch Envoy. Mr,Agm Englt/h Nation are mofi dear to me. Glorious Memory have granted to you Ijhall And if you have any thing farthertoreque/i of your Nation, you may confidently propofe ifreafonable. To which the Agent and his Second returned their humble Thanks, as well for their Mafter as themfelves â€¢ befeeching his Majelty to accept of their Services. To which his Majefty condefcendcd with a Nod of his Head, which was alio a fign of his taking Leave; which they alfo took, making their Obeyfances after their own manner. Now in regard they were beholden to the General of the Mufquetteers for this fa vourable Audience; in regard the King did nothing without his Advice, therefore they fent their Interpreter in the Evening to give him thanks for the favour he had procured them; in ac knowledgment whereof they made him a Prefent of a Rich Jewel, and thirty Ducats of Gold. The fame day the Meehmandar-Bachi, or Chief of thofe that attend upon the Kings Guefts, or Strangers of Quality, who is as it were a Grand Mafter of the Ceremonies, came to wait upon the King, difpatched from the Grandees of the Kingdom to give his Majefty notice, that they came forward, making eahe Journeys with the Body of the dcceafed King, and the whole Body of the Court in his time. That to prevent the People from fulpeding any thing of Fatal, they had given outthat the King was with his Wives, and would not there- toreihew nimfelf: that neverthelefs the Rumour of his Death began to fly abroad; which however could not now be much prejudicial, feeing that his Majefty had taken the Government of the Kingdom into his own hands: that as yet they pre- lerved all things in the fame condition they were in before; and expefted with fubmiffion what Orders his Majefty would be pleafed to lend for their future proceeding. Together with this Deputy there came an Eunuch alfo fent by Hamyeh-Mirya the Kings Brother, to falute his Majefty in the name of the young Prince,to throw himfelfathis Feet, to beg his favour, and to fupplicate him by all that was Sacred in thl MabumetanLzw not to put out his Eyes,- That he would be plealed to fhut up him as clofe as he thought fit, that he would take from him whatever he pleafed, but that for the Law of God he would leave him his fight, that he might not be inca pable of applying himfelf to his Studies, wherein he refolved liiii 2 toThe Coronation '^fpend his whole Life. The King kept the Eunuch with him- felf; referving the aofwer to the young Prince's requeft till he fhould be brought to Court. But he returned an Anfwer the feme day to the Letter which the Matter of the Ceremonies brought, which was compofcd in the form of a Command, and Contained the following Inftrudions, t. That the King approved what had been done, from the Fatal Moment of the King his Fathers death. x.That they flhould make all the haft they could to him without difturbing the Order of Affairs ^ leaving all things in the fame condition wherein they were. u That they fhould take care to caufe the Body of his de- ceafed .father, of high and Immortal Ta- radtfe, to he carried to the City under the charge of Mr^ah-Maajfomn ; and that at the fame time they fhould lend away three other Coffins like that wherein they had put the King, under as good a Convoy, one to Metched, another to Jrdevil, and the third to Kjichan. For the better underftanding thereafon of which Command, the Reader is to know, that the Ttrftans are ftrangely fuperllitious about the Burial of their Kings. For fearing left by lome Magical Art any Enchant ments fhould be pradlifed upon their Bodies to the prejudice of their Children, they conceal, as much as in them lies, the real Place of Interment. To this end they lend to feveral Places feveral Coffins of Lead, with others of Wood, which they call Tahoat, and bury all alike with the fame Magnificence. In this manner they de lude the Curiofity of the People, who cannot diicem by the outlide in which of the Coffins the real body fliould be. Not but it might be diicovered by luch as would put themfclves to the expence and trouble of doing it. And thus it fhall be re lated in the Life of Habtts the Great, that twelve of thefe Coffins were conveyed to twelve of the principal Molques, not for the fake of their Riches, but of the Peribn which they en- doled ; and yet no bodyJcnew in which of the twelve the Kings Body was laid, tho the common Belief is, that it was depofited at Jrdevil. It is alio faid in the Life of That there were three Coffins carried to three ieveral Places, as if there had been a Triple Production from one Body, tho it were a thing almoft certainly known., that the Coffin where the Body was-laid, was carried to this lame City of J^om,and to the fame Place where the deceafed King commanded the Body of Jbis deceaied Father to be carried. ItSo LYMAN III. King of Perfia. It is a very beautiful City, and for its Antiquity gives way to none of the reft; as being thought to be the Gumna of the Ancients. It is leated in the Province of or upon the Frontiers of Media. She prides her felf, as one of her moft glorious Ornaments, in a fumptuous Mofque, built all of Marble and yafper, embelliflied with Gold. In this Mofque are to be feenthe Tombs of the two forementioned Monarchs. The Porphyry of which they are built is overlaid with Plates of Gold, as if the Builders had ftriven to be profule in the waft of that rich Metal. e fliall give you the delcription of it in our 'Perjian Geography. Now the 'Perfians made choice of Metched, and yii'dcv11y lather than of any other Cities for the interment of their Kings, becaufe they believe thofe Cities claim tothem- lelves a lecret and peculiar Sanctity above any of the reft, by reafon thai die Martyrs and Men famous in their Religion have lived and been buried there. For they hold, that J{om and chan were always two fafe Retreats for all the true faithful in their Law, whom in the Primitive Times of Mahuptetifm the Arabians perlecuted unjuftly : and therefore that the Imaans, by whom they mean their lawful Prophets and High Priefts, retired thither to lecure tliemlelves from Perlecution, and there died. This is that which makes them believe that thefe Cities are holy and happy, and that in all their Contrads and Publick Writings they name the firft Dar-el-mouve-el-Din, or tation of9erfom revived in the L ; and the (econd, Mmmnm, or, the Habitation of And for the two other Cities Jrdhilis, called or, the Habi tation of direction. For that a great Saint, who lies buried there, was, as they lay, foitbyGod to direct men in the way ^f truth, and ^Ictchcd is called M gim Jeftmmny â€¢of the Law, and of in the firft lies buried among many other Saints of their Law Clxik-Sefe, Amiem, the firft of the Race of Kings that now Reign in 'Perjla, In thefecond lies the Imaan whom the reverence with an extraordinary fuperftition. Inftrauch that they bdieve die Body of that perfon who is buried by him, is more feoure of his Salvation, than if he were buried near any other Saint lels confiderable. Foi according to their Do&lt;Sbrine, they that lie interred near the Tomb of any great and holy Pedbnase lie under his Protc^bion. TheThe Coronatio The King, who had hourly intelligence of the Advance of the Grandees of the Kingdom, underftanding that they were arrived at J^achan, fent an Exprefs with Commands to the two Chief Phyficians, Ur ^a Satrid, that is to fay, ; and Mrza-Kouchonk, firnamed alio the to diftinguifh him from bis Brother, who was the chief to retire to the Palace Royal at i^ora, which joyns to the Mo/que, where arc the Tombs of the laft deceafed Kings; to betake themlelves to the Apartments allotted for them, there to pray to God the re mainder of their days for the Profperity of his Throne; in ac knowledgment of his Clemency towards them, in that he in- flidted no heavier punilhmenc upon them, than only that flight difgrace; fmce they had deferved to lofe their lives for under ftanding no better to prefervethe life of his Father and their Sovereign. The fame Meflenger carried alfo Orders to Majfoon, or the Lord without 'Blem already mentioned, and the Son alfo of the Prime Minifter; and Moutuely of as much as to fay, Majler of the Wor and ment, to take an Inventory of the whole Eftate of thole two Phyficians, to give it under their Seals what they found in ready Money, and to fend the Inventory when they had made it up to the King. Out of which he allowed them a Revenue of twenty thoufand Crowns a year to live comfortably in the faid City, without ftirring out of the Palace to which they were confined, till the Supreme Power fhould difpofe of their Lives. The whole Body of the Court arrived at Ifpahm within a Week after that, which was three Weeks after the Kings Co ronation. And then it was that the great Officers were admit ted one after another, troubled in their minds, and with hearts laden with forrow. Not one of them that knew what part to ad in this new Court, where everyone flattered himfelf with making an Intereft. However ftill as they came to Town, they went to kifs the Kings Feet ; and to pay him the tBached, which is a Cuftomary term which they ule when they Congratulate the Profperity of any great Perlbn: as if we fhould fay, Let fuch a thing turn to jourblejfmg. His Majefty, as every Grandee had paid him his Submiffions honoured him with a Calatc, or Vefi. This (perjian word, according to its Etymology, fignifies Entire, Ac- compltfhed, to fignifie either the Excellency of the Habit, or the Dignity of him that wears it. For it is an infallible Mark of the particular Efteem which the Sovereign has for the perfon to whomwhom he fends it; and that he has free liberty to approach his Perfon; for when the Kingdom has changed its Lord and Mafter, the Grandees who have not received this Veft, dare not prefume to appear before the King without hazard of their Lives. In purfuanceof this Cuftom, the King fent a very rich Veft to that courageous Eunuch, among others, who was the only perfon who had fet the Crown upon his Head. With this Pre^ lent he alio lent him a Dagger richly fet with Precious Stones. Immediately upon this it was believed that he would be advanced to fome high Employment but herefufed all Preferment with a generous Conftancy: fo that of all the Employments which his Prince offered him he only accepted of the Superintendency of the Affairs relating to the Princefs his Mother. All the Grandees being thus arrived, the King for feveral days following, held a Megeles, that is, an Affembly of his Lords, where the Lords of the Old Court met to compofe a New one. The firft day every one came in his Calate, or Royal Veft which the King had beftowed upon them. But the Nazjr or Superintendant General was not there; becaufe he had not been honoured with that Veft. So that when he found it was not lent him againft the next Affembly, he was then per- fuaded he had not long to live; or at leaft that he fliouldlofe his Employment ,â€¢ he feared that his Majefty had been informed, how that at the time of the Election he had endeavoured to pre fer his Younger Brother. And this fuipition of his was not al together without ground ^ for that indeed fomething had been whifpered to the King about it. Therefore he thought he could not do better than go himfqlf and prefent his Head to the King himfelf before any one was lent to demand it: for that if he thought to prelerve it by con cealing himlelf, helliould lofe it without all hope of pardon^ but if he had the courage generoufly to lay it at the Princes Feet, it might lb happen that he might lave himfelf; nor was he deceived: for this bold Refolution gained the heart of Sephie the Second, and wrought Compaflion even in his very Enemies, and thofe that envied him. For being come to the Alfembly, he ftood upright upon the Terrace among the Croud of Officers, with his head hanging upon his Br^aft, and his Eyes fixed upon the ground, as if he bad been afliamed to fliew his face. This fiibmiffive Pofture of his moved the Alfembly to pity, lb that one of the Lords, who owed him no unkindnels, told the King of it, and begged pardon in his behalf. The King furprifed atThe Coronation at the News, fent the fame Lord who had fpoken to him, to demand of the Intendent General, what he did there ? faid he, to offer his Uajefty the piate mth myhloud the misfortune o dknalion. Thereupon the King fent him a Command to go home; where about four days after he was honoured with the Royal Veft, as the reft had been, and was confirmed for the future in all the Employments which he enjoyed. I have heard from feveral perfons of Quality, and from fome of his own Kindred, that never any Head was in fuch a tottering condition, and that theleaft word that had been let flip to his prejudice had been enough to have ruined him.Buthis good For tune flopped the mouths of his Enemies; fo that there was not one who either durft, or was willing tooppoiehim. Be- fides that, the Young King who had been always bred among Women, and therefore not accuftomed to bloud, was unwil ling to put to death a perfon of whole worth and merit he was well aimed. Tho perhaps another more cruel, and more ex perienced would not have needed any Inftigation to fuch a piece of Fatal Inhumanity. At the fitting of the third Affembly Lalain Efquire, Gentleman in ordinary to the King of and his Majefties Envoy to the Princes of JJia, was introduced, together with one of the three Deputies of the India Company, followed by the Interpreter of the Nation. Now this Deputy had been fick, which was the reafon why they demanded Audience no fooner. For in regard that at the Grand Audience it is neceflary to demand the Confirmation of the Priviledges granted to the Company; Monfieur had not power to treat of any luch matter, but joyntly with the Deputy. Otherwife the refpedl which the have for the chief Nation of the World, would have procured them their Audience before any of the other They made a Prefent to his Majefty of a Cryftal Mirrour enchafed in Gold, Enamelled on the back-fide, and let with Emeralds on the fore part, together with a pair of Saddle Piftols, and a Imall Lion of Gold, embellilhed with Pearls. After they had made their Obeylances they took their Seats by the Kings Order among the Grandees 5 and then being directed to draw near his Majefty, Monfieur Lalatn began with all for tunate Wifhes for the Prolperity of the New Monarch in the name of the King his Mailer, and in few words gave him to underftand.

To which the Kmg made anfwer by his Prime Minifter, (for the make no diftindions between EmhJfadonrs Envoy,, Agmts &lt;%eftdents, &amp;c. but ftill make ufe of the word Heltchi , vvhich comprehends all ) ther, and the French Nation are my do only confirm what ever my deceafed Father, who refts granted the French Nation, but it is our Vleafure which we pall doupon the firft Occafion that prefents it felf. By what has been faid it appears that there Was no altera- tion o the Face of Affairs at the beginning of this New Reign; for that the King did nothing of himfelf, but meerly like an Engine movd as the Springs and Wires give it motion. Every one of the Grandees labour'd to get as near the Kings n as he could, to infihuate himfelf into the Kings Affedi on and to remove his Competitors at a diftatice. The molt Powerful and moft his Favourite however at that time, was Boudak-Saultan General of who con- tmud ftill his MajeftiesDiredor, for that he thought nothing well done but what he either order'd, or at leal approv'd Next to him Gemtchid^aan, as alio the or berlam, had a good fhare in his favour, not to fpeak of his Mother, who in the Inner Palace ruled him as flie pleafed her As for the General of the Mufquetteers, for the firft trial of his favour, he had procured himfelf a Commiffion that brought him a great Sum of Money.

But it was the mine of his Fortune and his Family, as we (hall by and by declare ; in re gard he made an ill ufe of his Power : For that he fent thofe Royal Habits more fumptuous, orlefscoftly, not according to the Rank of the Perfon, and Dignity of the Employment which every one held, but according to the friendfhip and kind- nefs which he Lad for them himfelf. And thus he dealt by the Vaster or Farmer of the Province of Ma^enderan, to whom he fent a Veft of little value, becaufe he had an Enmity againft him; not only to be reveng d of him by that affront, but becaufe he believ'd the indignity and vexation to be fo flighted would tranfport his Enemy to fome other Ad that would promote his ruine, which was the only thing that he moft cordially wifh'd for: and thus it fell out. This Fazier of Maunder an, call'd Mir^a-Hachem, during the Reign of HabdsIf. was in good credit with his Prince. And yet there was not in all Terjtaa perfbn of a more fcandalous Tongue. He would talk of the to the King with a moft dreadful fawcinefs 5 call the Prime Mimfter, Buffle-Head; the Superintendant, a Liar i the Chief Juftice, downright Knave; and then for the General of the Mufqu he laid, he was both a Coward and a Robber. And tho gave little heed to his difcourfe j neverthelefs the perfbns concern'd, were afraid they fhould make an impreffion in the Kings mind to their difadvantage, and therefore they all hated him with a perfect hatred. 1 1 r 1 But now, the King his fiipporter being dead, Mufquetteers, who was become the New Kings chief Favou rite, and had obtain'd a Commiffion to fend all the Officers their Royal Habits, refblv'd to be reveng'd, as believing withal that it would be no lefs acceptable to the reft of the Lords. _ ToS o l y m a n III. Pcrfia. y 5 To this purpofe inftead of a Royal him a plain Habit, worth not above forty Pounds, not doubting but that the Vaster would commit fome extravagance that would haften his deftruftion. Nor did he fail in his Conjedure. For upon his going forth to meet and receive the Habit, and to put it on that the People might fee, that he was con- firm'd in his Employment, when he faw it, and found it to be a thing of no value, he threw it away with fcorn and in dignation, believing it to be a trick put upon him, and done on purpofe to dilgrace him. However his difHain carri'd him no farther ,â€¢ for he conjectur'd it to be fome fnare laid to hurle him headlong into Ruine. Not daring therefore to return to the City in that Habit, and fearing lean: th e People fliouldde- lpi(e him, if they law him fo ill drels'd at the Kings Expence, as one that had loft his Reputation at Court, he lent home for a (Royal Habit, one of the Richeft and moft Magnificent that Hakas had formerly beftow'd upon him, and fo having put it on, he return'd to the City, making the People believe that he had receiv'd it from the New Monarch. This being known to all the Court, the quetteers was the firft that open'd his Lips, declaring that the Vaster of Makenderan was a Dog, that he had thrown away the Kings Habit, with reproachful Language, not forbearing to fay that he had no need of Sha Sefies Habits; whereupon he had made ufe of another which Habas his Father had fent him. The King who underftood not the Stratagems of Court, look'd no farther then the bare Information, not dreaming of any malice in the Contrivance. And therefore upon the Prime Minifter's firft motion, he fent an exprefs Command to the Vazjers Controller to appear at Court. So foon as the under ftood that the Controller was fent for, he began to confider the bad condition of his affairs. He knew well, and upon good grounds, that the Controller was a perfon that would not Ipare to inform the worft he could againft him, becaufe they had Been at variance a long time. Habas the Second had joyn'd them both together in Commiffion of fet purpofe, to the end that through the miftruft that they had one of another, they might be the more careful how they demean'd themfelves in the dil- charge of their duties; and to prevent them from any combi nation to defraud him of his Revenues. The therefore, to prevent his Fall as much as in him lay, difpatch'd away, be fore the Controller fet forward, one of his own Servants with Letters to his ffkil or Agent at Court, wherein he gave him Kkkkk 2 orderThe Coronation order to fpare for no expence in confiderable Prefents to fuch and fuch Lords. 'But,added he at the bottom, offering any thing to that ^fcal a frime Dog of a General of the Mufquetteers ; withal naming fome others to whom he forbad him to make any addrefies. But by mif- fortune the Meflenger crippl'd himfelf by the way, fo that he could not make that haft which was requifite; by which accident the Controller, who follow'd him clofe at the heels,overtook him in a Caravan /eraj, or publick Inn; where finding him laid down, and faft afleep, he would not mils fo favourable an opportunity, but ftole from under his Head the Purfe wherein his Letters were. He read them, and carri'd them to Court, to fliew them to thofe perfbns whom they had lb highly abus'd. Who more enrag'd then before carri'd the Controller to his Majefty, before whom he confirm'd the Information which had been already given him. That the Fof had dif- dainkilly flung away the Royal Habit which his Majefty had lent him, laying withal thefe words, Sha- Sephies Habits, and that he fentfor one of Habai's Veftments, which he wore upon his return to the City. Upon which the King highly incens'd, feveral times repeated the words Gidi, and Segh or Dog, and Scoundrel; with feveral other more outrage ous and bitter Expreffions, ufual among the greateft Peribnages in that Country, who think it no fliame to utter them upon all occafions, and before any perlbns whatlbever. Prefently the King fent to arreft the Vazjers Agent, and at the lame time difpatch'd to his Mafter a Chapar or Courrier extraordinary to arreft him, and confifcate all his Goods. The General of the Mufquetteers not content with this, the next Morning inform'd the King, that this Faster had been High Steward to Imaan-i\ouli-l\aan } that famous Prince, ho- nour'd with lb many Encomiums, and who is reported in the Life of Habat the Great to have wrought fomany Miracles, be- lides that he was Captain General of all hub ass Armies, I fay, he inform'd the King that this Vaster was entrufted with all lmaan-I\ouli-I\aaris Jewels, and yet he would never dilcover to Sefie the I. where that Prince had hid them before he was put to death; protefting he knew nothing of the matter. Which was a vifible piece of knavery, fince there could be no other perfon in the world who could know that fecret but himlelf; and therefore there was no way to conftrain him to tell the truth but by force. Which Incentives lb wrought upon the Young Prince that he difpatch'd a fecond Courrier with Orders toS o l y m a n III. Perfia. to bring the Vazter with his Head and Feet bare, and a Chain about his Neck; and that every day they fhould give him forty drubs upon the foles of his Feet till he confefs'd where the Jewels were. The Melfengers were punctual in the Execution of the Kings Commands upon the Vaster y who not able to endure the Tor ment, nor the hardfhip of the Journey, (for it was then in the depth of Winter, when all the ways were cover'd with Froft and Snow, )died, by that time he cattle halfway, had nine days together , as old as he was, fuffer'd horrible totrure, fted- faft in his refolutions not to make any difcovery. His Eftate be ing confifcated amounted to twenty five thoufand Tomans which make about four hundred thoufand Crowns. In the mean time, at Ifpahan there was nothing but publick Rejoycing, Feafting, Horle-racing, with other Sports and Pa- ftimes oi the fame nature. And when day was fhut in, an infinite number of Lights, which they call in that Country Chiragan, Were hung out all along the Streets, round about the Houlcs, and in the great Squares after a moft pompous man ner, infomuch that the night it felf might truly be calfd an Arti ficial day. The Young King no lels greedily tafted all the pleafuresand delight which the full fwinge bi Liberty, unknown what it meant till then, gave him opportunity to enjoy. Every day he walk'd abroad with his Wives into the parts adjoyning to the City ; commanding the Kjurouk through all the Villages and Towns adjoyning. I\ouronk fignifies a Prohibition to all Men and Boys above feven years of Age, upon forfeiture of Life, to be feen in any place where the Kings Wives were to pals, if he were in their Company . All the ways are hung on both fides with fuch fluff of which they make their Tents, to prevent the Women from being feen. And notice is given to all the Men to retire home at fuch an Hour j befides that, the Guards at two Leagues diftance round about, were ready to prevent any one from coming near the Pla ces fo canvaft in. Such is their fear, left the Wives fhould be feen by the Men. For they never hinder the Women from feeing as much as they pleafe. It is faid, that during the five Months from the Coronation of the King till the year 1078. of the Hegira, which anfwers the Spring of our 1667. the King commanded no lefs then fixty two K^urouks, going abroad with his Wives every time, and vifiting the Places round aboutcfpecially Gioulfa, a TownThe Coronatio Town belonging to the Armenians, feparated from the City only by a River, over which he made leveral large and magni ficent Bridges. Which fhews what power the Women had over the Young Prince, that they could caufe him to make fo many Prohibitions for their fakes i only that they might have the pleafureof hunting, and walking, and breathing in a more fweet and fpacious Air then that of their Confinement. While the Young King deni'd nothing to his Wives, nor his Pleafures, he neither refus'd any thing to his Favourites, nor to thole that' begg'd any thing of him ; infomuch that many per- fons that were laid afide were taken again into Favour. So that the beginning of the New Prince's Reign was like a year of Ju bilee, that fets open the Prifon Doors : They that had never fo few friends at Court might eafily be admitted, provided none of the Grandees oppos'd their entrance. or the fuhmijfflve was one of thofe perfons out of favour, and Pnfoners of whom we have made mention. The deceafed King had confin'd him to his Palace,and had con- fifcated all hisEftate, to the value of twelve thoufand pounds yearly revenue; and this,becaule that although he was blind,he would alfume to himfelf the difpofal and management of a Legacy of fix thoufand Crowns a year, which one of his An- ceftors had left to the Mofquees. For the Teftator having or- der'd in his Will, that this Revenue fliould be at the dilpofal of him that was in the Family to manage it, the perfon to whom the Adminiftration belong'd being dead, this blind Lord thought no perfon more capable then himfelf ,â€¢ and becaufe he was very potent, and of the Bloud Royal by the Mothers fide, who was the Daughter of Hahasthe Great (which was alfo the reafon that they put out his Eyes) he refolv'd to get this Adminiftration by force, under pretence that he was going out of the World, and concern'd himfelf only about Ecclefiaftical Affairs; and befides, had more wit then all his Family. But his Kindred coming to Habas II. and informing him that (Rezj,having had his Eyes put out by the Command of the de ceafed JCing his Father, on purpole to render him incapable of the Affairs of this World, neverthelefs went about by force, and contraiy to Law, to meddle in Civil matters. The Monarch hearing this, grew impatient at his arrogance, and after he had given fome figns of admiration, that a blind man fhould think himfelf capable to manage fuch a a defign, lent to confifcate all his Eftate, and commanded him to keep himfelf confin'd to one fingle Quarter of his Palace. â– iSo l y m a n in.

Butthemoft confiderable who in thefe Halcyon days of the King's early Government were releas'd out of Prilbn, and admitted to return to Court was who had been a Prifoner at K^asbin, and who with a boldnefs altogether furprizing, having made his elcape from his Guards, came ahd threw himfelf at the King's Feet. The ftory was this. So foon as he underftood the News of Hahats deceafe, he conceiv'd great hopes of recovering his Liberty. To which purpole he confider'd with himfelf, by what means he might make his elcape, and get to Ifpahan. He was refolv'd to beg the King's favour himfelf, believing that not any of the Gran dees at Court ow'd him lb much kindnefs as to Ipeak in his behalf ; only one friend he had, and that was the General of the Slaves. He, not forgetful of the ancient and ftridt Friend- fliip that had been between them, ventur'd three or four times in that privacy which the King allow'd him, to reprefent to his Majefty the misfortune of Hali-i\ouli-I\aaTi; but when he faw that the Prince return'd him no Anfwer, he fent to the Lord an account of the ftate of Affairs, and advis'd him to come in perfon, and throw himlelf at the King's Feet: for that confi- dering the mildnefs and fweetnefs of the new Conjun&amp;ure he could run no great dfy/co. Thefe Letters confirm'd Hali-i\p fo much the more in the Relolucion he had taken, becaule he found himfelf fup- ported beyond his expectation. Thereupon he wrote back to the General of the Slaves, return'd him thanks for his kindnefs toward him, befought him to continue it, and to take care that he might have Horfes laid to be ready at fuch places and times. And when all things were ready, he defir'd leave of the Captain of the Guard to let him go a hunting. This being a favour which the Captain had granted him feveral times before, he did not then deny him. Thereupon he rode forth, attended only with four of his moft intimate Confidents well mounted, and well arm'd. Being got into the field, he ftill beat toward IJpahan, pretending to hunt, but little minding whether he put up any Game or no. But at length having drawn off his Guards a good way from the Town, and finding their Horfes tir'd, toward the clofe of the Evening, as if it had been only a frolifk, he put Spurs to his HorfeThe Coronatio Horfe and rode out of fight. As for his Guards they had no miftruft at hrft,ull at length,that they faw he made fo little haPc to comeback. But it was too late to purine him, and as vain to ftaytill he return dj their Horfes being quite tir'd with Gallop ing up and down for four hours and more together. Befides, the refolute Prifoner flew with all the fpeed that Whip and Spur could make, and arriv'd at where he met all his friends at the appointed Rendezvouz, to the number of Fifty perfons, and went diredly to the King's Gate. When he drew near the Place where the King was fitting, the General of the Slaves met him; who was not a little furpriz'd to lee him there fooner then he expected. Neverthelels, without making any fhew of having kept any correfpondence together, he ask'd him his bufinels, who anfwer'd, That his Head at theKjngs Feet. It is replied the Ge neral of the Slaves, Til go and h lytngs mtffion. But Halt-I'youIt-I'yaan , inftead of ftaying for the Kings Anfwer, follow'd the General of the lo clofe that he could hear the King, as foon as he heard his Name, and that he was come, make anfwer aloud, lyouh GheLiy ; him he welcome^ let him come in and then com manding him to enter, he repeated the fame kind words, with a Countenance that teftifi'd his latisfadlion ; and then caus'd him to fit down. Within a Minute after, the King call'd for him, andorder'd him to draw near him; and when he was clofe by him. Hah- i^oult-IQian, faid he, what brings requefl r To which the Lord made anfwer with a wonderful cjuicknels of Wit, I am come hit ferve yourMajefty; hecaufe Slaves theirMafters call. This Anfwer highly pleas'd the Youthful Sovereign, inlb- much that after he had diimifs'd him, he gave Order to the Prime Minifter to give him a fplendid Entertainment the next day, to provide him a Palace, and to furnilh him with money, and all other neceffaries whatever. In purfuance of which Command the Prime Minifter affign- ed him the Palace where lodg'd the Embafladour iromAurang- Zeeh King of the Indians, in the years 1664, and But this Lord, fo loon as he became Mafter of it, pull'd it down to the ground, and built it up again far more magnificently then ever; as you may fee in our IDefcription of Ifpahan. The next day, as he late at Dinner with the Prime Minifter, and wasS O L Y 1VI A N III. Kjng of Perfia. was telling rfie Story how he made his elcape out of his Con finement, he added, That a mad up, the more mad and extravagant which he therefore faid, in regard he had incurr'd the Kings difpleafure byhaif- brain'd, and violent adions, and full of a Tranfportment that truly favour'd of Extravagance. A while after the King fummon'd a or publick Affembly for his fake. There out of a magnificent humour,not ufual but among Sovereign Princes, he caus'd to be fpread upon the ground in the Garden where this Lord was to pafs to the very Hall feventy Pieces of Zer-hajfe which is a very rich fort of Perlian Tiftue, as much as to fay, For hajfen fignifies to Weave or make Every Piece of this Tiffue might be worth eighteen about threelcore or threefcore and ten pound, amounting in all to lome twenty thoufand Crowns. Such perlbns as are thus honour'd by the King, walk without their Shooes upon the Stuffs, which the King afterwards lends them home to their houfe, for a Prelent, as he did to this Perfbn; to whom at the end of a fumptuous Banquet which he gave him, he Ipoke thele words, Hah-E^mh- l\aan, hearken what they are going to read. Upon that the Principal Secretary read a Patent, wherein the King nam'd him Governour of or the ancient HaHriana of which the Capital City is Metjhed, which is one of the chiefell: Governments in TBut whether this Lord had heard lome report of an Invafion threaten'd thofe Parts, he would by no means accept the honour; or whether it were that he did not cace to leave the Court, or which was more proba ble, becaufe he thought it beneath him to accept of a meaner Employment then what he had before his Confinement, For he had been formerly Generalilfimo of all the Armies: and therefore after he had returnd the King his moft humble thanks, BenefaElor of Mankind, faid he, Age; Grant me the favour at the e Jpend days at the Gate of your Majejly. Some few days after he ofFer'd him the Government of Armenia, of which Erivan is the Capital City ; but with his moft humble Thanks to his Majefty he refus'd that likewile, and queftionlefs for the fame Reafons. At length the King caus'd Letters Patents to be made him to be General of all his Forces, and Governour o( Media, of which that which we call Tauris, is the Capital City; in regard that Government is always annex'd to that Employment. L 1111 ButThe Coronatio But at the very time that he had receiv'd fo great and extra ordinary a favour from his Majefty, he took the boldnefs to fliew that he was not yet content, but that he Ml dellr'd fome- thingmore. To that purpofe, faidhe, fence your Majefty does me the favour I humbly implore your Majefty to add my Govermmt fuch and Villages, to the end I may maintain fplendour to which your Majefty has call'dme, viflt me, I may be able to entertain or Rice and Flefli, the ufual Food of the Per flans) this favour at my hands, he may fraying for your Majefty. To which when the King had con- delcended, he flung himfelf proftrate at the Kings Feet, and gave him Thanks. As he was retiring out of the Kings pre- ience, the King having fpi'd certain white Hairs in his Beard, which he wore up to his Ears, Hali-i^ouli-Iyaan, laid he. the Treafury, and hid 'em, in m Tomans ( which is about Eleven hundred Guineys ) fome Paint to colour thy'Beard, and thy Face. Which immediately he did according to the Kings Order, and carried away the Money. And this was another Accumulation of Favour which his liberal Sovereign added to the reft which he had beftow'd upon him. Thus was he made General of all the Perjlan Forces, Go- vernourof Media, and in a word, the firft and moft powerful perlon in Perfea, at which all the Grandees were not a little aftonifh'd: and they all began to grow jealous of him; even they who had been inftrumental to his Advancement. For they could not imagine he fhould arrive in lb fhort a time to that Pinacle of Honour where they beheld him. And indeed they had realbn to be jealous of him. For his Authority made him Mafter of their Eftates; and befides, they knew him to be ill-natur'd, and milchievoufly bent, and as bold and daring as a Lion j more then all this, Cholerick without relpedt or confideration, and relblute to enterprize whatever might latisfie his Fury, or advance his Interefts. From this time forward rill his death, which hapned not long after, as will appear in the Series of this Story, he was always in great credit with the King ;who had a particular efteem for him, lo that there was hardly any thing which he refus'd him. At the fame time that Haly-Myuli-I\dan was under reftraint the Princels Pehri -Pychfar-ddegum, the prelent King's Aunt was alio reftor'd to Favour. For, as it has been faid in the Life ofS o l y m a n III. 0/ Perfia. of the deceafed Prince, whofe Sifter flie was, the King^opunifli her for having been too bufie in fome Intrigue, which I know not what it was, only that it was fuch a one as had highly offended him, had married her to a Muila Doctor of who at that time live! at Ifpahan, the Son of or the Steward of the great Mofque at By him during the Life of Habas fhe had two Children, to whom the Prince for bad her to give fuck, which is the manner of putting to death the Children of the Bloud Royal when the King relolves they fhall not live. But now this Lady underftanding the death of the King, went and threw her felf at the feet of the New Mo narch, who received her kindly, and aifur'd her he would ad vance her Husband to fome confiderable Employment: where in he was as good as his word ; for fome Months after, he made her Husband Sedre lQiaJJ'oh, that is, being a very confiderable Employment,as he that is as it were the Kings Almoner, or he that has the difpofal of all the Gifts bequeath d by the Kings of 'P erfia to the Mofques ; which Employment was worth to him about fifteen thoufand pounds yearly. There remain'd another Sifter of II. in the Womens Palace, who in the Kings abfence was as it were Sovereip-nefs of the Place ; for which reafon they give her a Name tha'tfig- nifies, the white Locks of the Sacred ; which is a figurative fort of Speech to denote the dignity of the perfbn, and the par ticular relpeil which is due to her. This Lady, being defirous to tafte the of Wedlock as well as her Sifter, importunately befbught the New Mo narch that flie might marry the Brother of her Sifters Husband, a Molla, or Doctor of the Law as he was. For which reafon the King made him Sedrc-Mohnfaat, or Pontiff of the Kingdoms&gt; which is a preferment almoft like the other, and very near equal to it in Revenue ; as he that has the difpofal of the Le gacies which are given to the Mofques by private Perfons. Which two Preferments for above two hundred years were both in one. But the King, for the fatisfadion and advantage of his two Aunts, divided them for the benefit of their Husbands who are perfons of no 4 merit, and of very mean Capacities. Nor is it likely the King will fufferthem to hold their Places of too great Importance for their management. And now his Majefty, having fupplied thefe two Pontifical preferments, which were vacant during the late Kings Reign, took care to fill up other vacancies alfo, which he beftow'd upon perfons of credit that were next about him, or their Friends. Lllll 2 ThatThe Coronatio That of Xpurtch't. Bachi, or General of the one of the three Bodies of the Verftan Militia, and one of the higheft Trufts in the Empire was conferr'd upon All the f\_aanas or Governments of Terfia were likewife be- ftow'd upon perfons of worth; In a word, there was not a vacant place but what was fill'd up. For the deceafed King let them lie vacant for a fecret reafon which his Son underftood not, which was to reap the profit of their Revenues. So great, that it is reported the Employments which he fupply'd, and of which the King his Father had all the benefit, brought into the Chequer a Million fterling Yearly. However 1 do not report this for truth; but as having heard it affirm'd by per fons of great knowledge in Affairs, and who could have giv'n a juft account had they fo pleas'd ; which they will not always do. Thefe were the Favours and Bounties of the Young Monarch during the Feftivals of his Coronation. Of which the mirth and jollity was not a little difturb'd by a fad accident that occali- on'd thedownfalof the Grand Provoft. In the defcription of Ifpahan we have obferved that for a long time that City has been divided into two Factions, which are always quarrelling and fighting for Precedency, and An tiquity. And upon Feftival Times there is always a great Con- courle of the Rabble of both Factions in the old or Publick Place of the City, where the two different Factions, ranging themfelves, the one upon the South, the other upon the North fide, batter one another with Stones and Clubs at a ftrange rate. The Grand Provoft all this while makes a fhew of parting 'em, but he does it fo remifsly, that both Parties fee well enough that it is only a Copy of his Countenance ; which makes 'em bolder, and more violent in their milchief. For the Grand Provoft is not at all troubl'd at it by realbn of the great Fines which afterwards he milks into his own Pocket. Upon one of thele fore-mention'd Feftival days, his Majefty being in the Ipacious and magnificent Hall, which is built over the great Portal of his Palace that looks out into the Royal Square, where he late to behold a horle Race, and leveral of his Lords fhooting at a Golden Ball, an Exerciie much us'd among the Terfian Archers, news was brought that about two thouland of the Rabble were fighting in the May dan, or Pub- lick Market place with that implacable animofity that there was like to be a great deal of milchief done. Upon which his MajeftyS o l y m a n III. Perfia. Majefty fentfor the Vanga, or Grand Proand order'd him to take along with him a Guard of Sixty Muf- quetteers if he thought fit, and go and difperfe the furious Combatants. W hich was a Command too exprefs to be dally'd withal. But the Grand Provoft could never accom- plifli it. However away he flew, at the Head of above two hundred Soldiers, and commanded the Mutineers to part and difperfe themfelves. But they believing the Provoft did but only make a fhew, as he was wont to do, fell a fliouting at him, and pairing him with ftones. He would fain have giv'n em to underftand he was then in earneft; but becaufe the Tumult and noife wasfbgreat, that he could not otherwife be heard then by the thunder of his Mufquets, he order'd the Soldiers to fire without Bullets i which they did, but to no purpofe. For quite contrary to his expedarion, the infolent Multitude per ceiving nothing but fire and fmoke, were the more confirm'd in their Opinion, that the Grand Provoft was only come there to fliew himfelfin difcharge of his Office, and that he did not de- fire they fhould part in good eameft. In the mean time two Horlemen came from the King to fee if the Tumult were appeas d; at what time theProvoft, gall'd to the heart that they fhould obferve the little Authority he had over the Rabble,who had put him to a Retreat with their Stones commanded about twenty of his Soldiers to fire with Bullets! Of which Volley there was not a fliot that mifs'd. So that Nine of the Multitude were kill'd upon the place, and others were dangeroufly wounded. The reft, finding now that the Provoft was not in jeft, fled with all the haft they could,leaving their dead and wounded behind. When word was carri'd to the King what had happen'd, fome of the Grand Provofts private Enemies, which the great Lords are never without, and who, unfortunately for him, were tiien at his Majefties elbow, laying hold of the opportunity. How comes it to pafs, Sir, laid they, that Slave, dares thus abufe the Inhabitants ? nothing to do hut thus to dejiroy you Grand Trovo/l prevent the/ediforders ?

Upon this the King, who of himfelf was already troubl'd at the Accident, wasThe Coronation of '^TfaTmore incens'd by chefrexafperacions. Wherefore he immediately difmifs'd the Lord from his employment, and lent him Prifonerto a Houfe, from whence he was releas d lomc few days after at the earneft fuit of the Queen Mother, and fbme other perfons that were concern d at his Misfortune. For indeed he was a man of courage, eminent for his vertue, and one that ftiew'd in all his Actions the Nobility of his Ex traction ; for he was defcended from the Bloud Royal or Geor- V a, the laft Sovereign Prince of that Country being his Grand- father, whofe name was Hemire-Ham^eh-Mir^a. W elhall fpeak more of him in the Progrels of his Story; fortune calling him acrain upon the Stage to aÂ£t a part of more impoitance^ and of greater Authority. The charge of Grand Vrovojl was again luppli d the next day, and conferr a upon a very worthy perion, the Son of Mtr Kajfem-hek, or Lord Wmce (Rohuft. This fame Mtr-KjIfem-bek had been Grand Provoft before the laft that was fo lately put out, and in the time of Habas 11. by tne craft of the Prime Minifter had his Head cut off in the Royal Tiazga of Jfpahan. His Son, who was call'd K^lk-HahSek, the Dogg ofHaly, during the little time that he enjoy'd this Employment,moft worthily behav'd himfe'lf in it: and we muft needs fay, that rais'dhis Father made himfelf eminent again, by driving out all the Thieves, Pick-pockets, and Rabble which in fected that great City. This happend at the latter end of the Year 1077. according to the Mahianctan account, which anlwers to the beginning of our Year 1667. For their Year 1078. began with the Fental Equinox, which his Majefty made a great day of publickre- joyciug according to theCuftom of the Terjians. But this Year that began with fo much rejoycing, and with luch lucky Omens, was not lb fortunate however in the Con- clufion. Scarcity, War, and Epidetnick diftempers affli6ted the moft part of the Provinces during the whole courfe of it. The Court was turmoyl'd with leveral dilbrders, which cofl lome perfons many a troublelbm Hour. And through the negli gence and remifsnefs of the Sovereign, the Grandees erected fo many petty Tyrannies, which trampl'd under foot and pillag'd the poor people as they pleas'd themlelves. So that there was not any perfon but was lenlible of the miferies which ill Go vernment occafions when the Prince only minds his pleafures, and to content his Paffions; and the great ones following his example give themfelves the liberty to follow the fwinge of their own Arbitrary Wills. , Theâ–  S O L Y M A N I II, iywcr Pcrlia.

Nor was the Conjundure without great Probability, in regard that Halt-I&lt;juli-iyaan, General of all the Kings Forces was then very powerful, and that the other was the Son of ^ftan-^aanhis Brother. However he was deceiv'd and the General, quite contrary to his Expectation, hfeder'd all people to folhcite in his behalf, out of the care he took of his own Reputation which he had fulli'd in a high degree had he been inftrumental to reftore a Perfon that was hald by all the world i befides that, his private enmity againft him pre vail d beyond all the Confiderations of Bloud and Confansui- mty. For which the Chnftians had reafon to blefs God be- caule there was no man more their enrag'd and bitter Enemv then he. And it was well for em, during the time he held his Employment, that Habas was not a young man, and that he undertook their Protedion. For it is reported of him, tha when any Chnftian was Cited before his Tribunal by an^' ZTfrU Preendy him befol - e heheard y him ; nd that he was wont to fay. It man to have a Hmth a Mahumetan, to cauje broken. Myjhouldhe notfuffer the Do? In the mean time the King held on his debaucheries every day at the fame rate. But his health did not keep at the fame ftay while he grew every day worfe then other. For the young Prince having plundg d himfelf into the exceffes of Wine and Women he ? OUldhold without fomealteradbn So^ that during the whole courfe of this Year he was always ill' what Phyiickfoever his Phyficians could prefcribe him; for he 1Â°Â° . ^ care ^ lm ^elf. If he fometimes refrain'd Wine by their advice, it was not folong, but that he fell to drinkina iD againThe Coronation asaln before he had time to recover his ftrength. For which reafon he was always pale, and his Body imparted its own weaknefs to his Mind, and render'd him unht for buimels to which the Grandeur of his Quality call'd him. All this while the Des-tth encrciis d at Ifpahuu-y ^nd the poor people cry'd aloud againft the exceffive price of it. And indeed there were many caufes of this Scarcity; Firft, the laft years Harveft did not amount fcarce to the half of what they ex pelled j for the Locuft had devour'd the Ears. Then the whole Train of the Court was come all together of a fudden to Ifpahan before they were expected, lb that they had tak'n no care to lay in their Stores againft Winter. Moreover, at the King's firft coming to the Crown, the greateft part of the Officers of the Empire coming to preient themfelves before Him, and a vaft number of private perfons crouding together about bufinefs, or for curiofity, the Multitude of Inhabitants was encreas d to above half as many again, fo that of neceffity the Price of Provifions muft be double in Proportion. But the chief Reafon that all things were fo dear was the bad appearance of the Harveft at hand, which promis'd no better then the laft year. For in regard the Harvefts in thefe Climates are generally reap'd in the Months of June and July, it is eafie to conjedure in March and Jpril what the year will produce. And therefore the Com Merchants perceiving that there would be an infallible fcarcity of all forts of Grain, enhans'd their Prizes, and would not part with what they had, but ftaid till the Prizes were at the hiaheft, fo that the probability of a dearth to come caus'd a prefent Famine. Laftly, the ill Government was in part a great caufe of the fcarcity, for that the Laws were not obferv'd,and the Magiftrates neglected their duty, without fear of being pu- nifli'd. And this was theRealbn that the Mochte/ek y or Chief of the Government, receiv'd Bribes of thofe that ibid necelfary Pro- vifions, and therefore to gratifie'em he publifh'd every Week the Prizes of things as thofe people defir'd j that is to lay, at an excefllve rate, and three quarters higher then in the time of the deceas'd King. For we are to obferve, that it is a Cuftom in Verfta, that every Saturday the Chief Juftice fets the Price of all Provifions for the Week following, which the Sellers dare not exceed under great forfeitures. This Knavery then of the Judge of the City Government, who ftood in no aw of the fuperiour Government, was the caufe that all things were fold at double and treble the Rate they ought to have been. TheS o l y m a n III. Perfia. The People therefore almoft ftarv'd by this Scarcity, re^ cloubrd their Cries, To that they reach'd the very Gate of the Palace Royal, which movd his Majefties Compaffion to that degree, that he cornmitted the Aftair to Gene ral of all his Forces. Who began his firft endeavours of redrefs with an Ail of Generofity and Juftice, which made him dreaded by all the Merchants and Corn-fellers. He had com manded one of the moll eminent Merchants in to fend him in upon the place, the firft day of the Marker, two hundred Sacks of Wheat, and not to lell 'em at a dearer rate then they were Ibid the year before. Now the Merchant thought that he expeded a Bribe â–  and therefore upon the Market day think ing to exempt himlelf from obedience to his Command he lent him two hundred Tomans, which amount to the value of about a thouland ijiols. Thereupon the being highly otfended, fent for him, and when he came, laid he, is it thus thou goejl about ? Affront thou haji done me receive thy feet. Which were paid him at the fame inftant; andbe- fides, the General condemned him in a Fine of two thouland Crowns; which he took to himlelf, fending the thouiand Piftols to the King. Prelently he order'd a great Oven to be built in the Royal 'Piazga, and another in the publick ordering the Criers to proclaim that thofe Ovens were fixed to bake thofe alive, that fliould fell their bread at a rate above the let price, or that fhould hide up their Com. There was moreover a fire con tinually kept in theleOvens, but nobody was thrown in; be- caule no body would venture the pain of luch a rigorous puniflhment of his Dilbbedience. At the lame time he alio went himlelf to vifit all the Granaries and Store-houfes of Corn and Meal that were in Ifpahan, and having taken an accompt in Writing of their Number, every Week he commanded the Merchants to fend a certain quantity according to the Proportion of what their Store-houfes containd, and not to fell but at a certain Price, and not to deliver their goods to any but luch as brought a Note under his hand. He gave the feme Command for Barley: fo that almoft for a whole years time there was neither Wheat or Barky to be had without a Ticket feafd with his Signet. All the Bakers went for fuch a Ticket. And in regard the General knew full well what everyone of em vented, he would not permit the Baker by vertue of his Ticket to buy any more then what he had Mm mm m occafionThe Coronatio occafiort for. To that purpofe he prohibited the Bakers to fell to any other then thole of their own Precinft, nOrtofell 'em any more then what was needful for their fubfiftance according to the ufual rate of their fpending, to the end that the Bakers fliould not pretend that perfons came from abroad to buy their bread , or that thofe in their Precinds bought more one Week then they did another, and fo that the vent could not be always equally proportion'd. And for the Price, he order'd that the Batman cha of Bread ( the Royal weight of confifting of eleven pounds three quarters) fliould be worth an Jbafji, which makes four Groats. By this good management he wonderfully eas'd the People, who before paid for eleven pound and three fourths of Bread an Jhaffiznd a quarter, or twenty pence; whence it alio came to pals, that there was Plenty fufficient. Thus the Complaints and Cries of the People ceas'd. For the Bakers being oblig'd to furnifli thofe in their Precinds with as much bread as they flood in need of, no body was apprehenfive of the fcarcity, but only that he paid five farthings for that which coft not above four in time of plenty. And to the end that the fame rate might continue, hefent to all the Burroughs, Towns, and Villages, from eight to nine days journey roundabout, to fend in fuch a number % of Waggon-Loads of Corn and Meal to Ifpahan, and there to fell it at the fet price. By which means there came enough to fupply the City for fix Months. More over, when any confiderable Quantity arriv'd, he order'd it to be brought in, as it were, in triumph; the People dancing be fore with their Inftruments of Mufick, and thehorfes being cover'd withHouffes, and gingling an infinite number of little Bells, which together with the Acclamations of the Rabble made a ftrange, confufed, and yet pleafing noife. Some Villages there were that mutiny'd and refus'd to fend in their Corn,- but the punifhment of the Inhabitants of Ifpahanim- cha ftrook a terrour into the reft. For the General had fent to this Place, being a great Town confifting of four thoufand Houfes, two Leagues diftant from Ifpahan, one of his Officers with a Command from the King te fend at the fet Price two hundred Sacks of Meal to the Capital City for their prefent neceffity. The Townfmen made anfwer, 'twas nothing to them if there were fuch a Famine in the City, for that they had paid all their duties and Impofitions for the laft Harveft: that they had fomething elfe to do then to fend their Corn and their Meal to Ifpahan Market, and that thofe that wanted might eomcS o l y m a n III. Per/ia. come to them, for that they were not bouncftxTfell but in their own Town. Thereupon the Officer remonftrated to the Prin cipal of the Village that it was the Kings pleafure, and fhew'd em the Kings Warrant which he had in his hands; to which their anfwer not being with that becoming reverence which became 'em, the Officer laid his hand upon his Sword, thinking to have frighted 'em into obedience. But the Country fellows not underftanding, his hard words, fell upon the Officer, beat him almoft blind, and tore the Kings Command, crying out, 'twas a Cheat and Counterfeit. The General highly offended at this Infolence of the Coun trymen, gave the King an account of it, who order'd him to inflict fuch punifhment as the Offence deferv'd. Upon which he lent two hundred of his Guards, who Drubb'd to excefs the Principal of the Ringleaders. He alfo fet a Fine upon their heads of a hundred thoufand Crowns 5 which was mitigated to a third part, tho after many Petitions and Submiffions, with a Prefent to the General of a thoufand Piftols, which was all paid down upon the nail. At the fame time the General alfo found a way to revenge himlelf upon the Armenians for refufmg him akindnefs which he ask'd 'em; making ufe, for his pretence, of this Commiffion which the King had given him to furniflh l/pahan with Corn. Thele Jrmnians are Chriflians born in l/pahan fb call'd be- caufe they are originally Natives of Armenia, from whence Habcvs the Great tranfplanted 'em into the heart of the Kingdom. At preferit their principal Colony is without the Walls of the Capital City, in a place adjoyning feparated from the City only by the River : the Verftans alfo call 'em, as we do, Jrmeni for the fame reafbn. They alio call the two the one Amen the Great, and the other Amen the Left. Now Hult'l\vuU-t\jan at his firfl:coming to Court, being in want of money to put himfelf into an Equipage, and to go forward with his Buildings, and not knowing where to have it, one day that fome of tht Armenians came to him about bufinefs, de manded of 'em, which were accounted the moll wealthy of all their Country-Folks &gt;Upon which they nam'd him five or fix, and among the reft I\ora Zachara. The General remem- ber'd his name, and two days after, when another came to prefent him fome Petition or other, he ask'd him whe ther he knew the Merchant Zachara who making anlwer that he did, the General bid him go and feek for him. Now the Armenian little thought that the General had meant the rich Mmmmm z Mer-The Coronation l^knt, which the former had mention'd, But another of the lame name, who with his two Brothers manag'd tne Kings Money, and had always confiderable Sums i'rheif hands, to purchafe in Foreign Countries fuch Curioficies of value which might pleafe the'King. This latter therefore the fetch'd. And the General believing him to be the Merchant Zachdra, caus'd him to fit down by him for two hours toge ther, and receiv'd him fo civilly as to make him ftay and dine with him. ^ ^ â€ž , Alter Dinner, l^oga-Zachara, faid the General, canjt do me tlx kindnefs to lend me two hun (which are about athoufand Piftols) I expeEl in f jort Money, and then I will repay thee wi thou fh alt fee I know how to he grateful Xo which the Armenian repli'd. Not thou- fand Tomans, tf your Lordjhij) plea This anlwer pleas d the General, infomuch that he fhew'd himfelf highly latisfi'd, and ask'd him if he could not fend him in the money the fame day. To which the Armenian, underftanding what he had to do, repli'd, Sir, faid he, the money pall fent in, when to command it; hut Imujl % the fafirfi fpeak one word. We are two (Br Majejlies Factors, the one is in the Indies, the Europe; a* , I refide here, as you fee; all the Mon Kjngs, and then it will he requifite that the Receipt which you gweme fhould hefeald with the Icings Signet, you dejire. The General then law he was miftaken, for he could not meddle with the King's Money, and chafing in his mind, dif- mifs'd the Merchant, believing the had nam d this perlon to him, on purpofe to baffle his requeft, by putting him to defire a kindnels of the King's Factor, of whom it was not proper for him to borrow Money. However it was only an Error caus'd by the miftake of the Perfon, where there were two of a name. For in regard that the are only call'd by the Proper names which they receive in Baptilm, never ufing any Sirnames, it happens that there are leveral perfons that go by one and the fame Name. However the General refolv'd to try once more; and two days after he found an opportunity to make a fecond Requeft. For the F^eloanter, or chief and ible Governour of the and who has therefore that Title given him, which fignifies Greatejl, having made fome Preients to the King, for which hisS o l y m a n III. Perfia. his M.xiefty fent him a Royal Habit, put it on, and beingar~ tended by the moft confiderable perfons of his Nation, went to return his humble Thanks to the King, and to kils his feet. After that, according to cuftom, he goes with all his Com pany to pay his Vifits to the Grandees of the Court, and to re turn 'em his Thanks for having contributed to the Honour done him to have the Royal Veft beftow'd upon him. When he came to the Generals Houfe, the Grandee caus'd him and all his Company to fit down, and after the ufual Complements, he defired 'em to lend him two hundred Tomans, affuring 'em that he would repay'em again with Iritereft, and be their Protestor upon all occafions at Court. But they, who knew how ufual a thing it was for the f erjlun Grandees to be borrowing, and how frequently they were deni'd; and befides, as well under- ftanding the humour of the Perfon, to whom a Loane would have prov'd a Gift, made him anfwer, that it would be their happinels to ferve him, but as at prefent their affairs flood, it was impoflible : for that all their Money was either in the Indies, or in Europe, in the hands of their Fadors, and before their return they knew not how to raife fuch a Sum. Very well, repli'd the General, then lend me but half fo much : nay, he came down at length to a third part. But thefe imprudenc perfons fwey'd by their own Avarice, refus'd him alio that fmall Sum, not confidering the Credit he was in at Court, and that he was able to do 'em a great deal of harm. Which lb incens'd the General, that he put em out of the Room before him, calling 'em Dogs, and turning his back upon 'em would not receive their Complement. Three Weeks after he fent a Command in the Kings name to their Chief, to furnifli the City with forty thouland 'Batman-Sha of Meal, which make five hundred thoufand pound weight. To which the Chief of the Armenians anfwer d, that there was not fo much in all the Town: and to fetch it from other places was a thing not to be done, in regard the expence of Carriage would raife the Price of every 'Batman, or twelve pound,to an Abafji and a fourth part; which was contrary to the King's Command; who intended that the abovemention'd weight ftiould be fold for an Ahajfi, which in that manner would be a fifth part lofs to them. The Ac- compt was jufl, and the General knew well enough they Would be lofers at leaft a thoufand Piftols in the quantity of Meal which he demanded; but that was the thing he aim'd at, that they fhould be lofers the full Sum of what they refus'd to lend hirtv And therefore, noc latisfi'd with their realbns, he lent to'The Coronatio to em aaain to let 'em know that they muft furnilli the Quan tity of Meal which the King had order'd; That the Place of of their Refidence was a dependance upon I/pahan, and that they were oblig d to relieve the Capital City as well as others: and that it was his Majefties exprefs Command. But notwith- ftanding all that the General could fay, the would do nothing. They pleaded that they were not oblig'd to that over-chargement j and that by their Agreement with the King they were exempt from all new Impoficions and Tributes, pay ing yearly four hundred Tomans, which come to about two thoufand Piftols, fo that altho there were a real Famine in the City, as thanks be to God there was not, there could no more then that Sum be demanded of them. They were in the right, but they wanted ftrength. The General was refolv'd to carry it on with a high hand, and no lefs was agreed upon then to arreft the Principal Heads of the Town. Of which when they had notice, they fent all their Wives, to the number of above three hundred, to the Gate of the Haram, or Palace of Women, there to wait for the King, and demand Juftice. To which purpofe they took theic oppor tunity when his Majefty was there, and plac'd themfelves be fore the Gate againft the Walls. For indeed, this is the Place allow d to be free for all that come to cry for Juftice, or to Pe tition for any Favour ; nor dare the Guards upon pain of death hinder any Perfons that offer to go thither, where they have liberty to implore with a loud voice the Juftice of the Prince. There thefe Women made fuchanoife, that they were eafily heard to the innermoft part of the whole Palace, fo that the King having underftood the Caufe,commanded 'em to go home, and he would take order in their bufineis. However the GeneraliJJimo ceas d not to prefs the and to threaten 'em with Imprifonment, fo that finding no other remedy, they fent their Wives a fecond time to the Palace, and to the fame Place. Where the Women fet up their throats as they did before; and underftanding that his Majefty was juft coming forth at the Gate that leads into the Royal Alley, thither they ran in heaps with fo much fury, that one Croud of 'em got fo near as to touch the Kings Horfe ,â€¢ nor could the and Lacqueys that went before, and round about the Kings Perfbn hardly keep'em off. For the Women in the heat of their fury began to throw ftones, and one among the reft was fo impu dent as to lay hands upon the Bridle of the Kings Horfe. So that his Majefty, being before not a little ftard'd at the Tumuit,S o l y m a n \11. J^ Perfia. began to be more aftonifti'd at the boldnefs of fuch an action ; and befides, his Youth and want of Experience was fuch that he knew not how to deal with that Sex; only he commanded the Guard, to drive'em away, bid'em be gone, and that he would do 'emjuftice: but for all that, he had much ado to quit himfelf from thofe (he Devils let loofe. At the fame time the Armenians had prefented a Petition, by means of an Eunuch, to the Queen Mother, as being under her Protection, for that theirTown isone of the Placesaffign'd for her Dowry. ThcPrincefs receiv'd their Petition, and pro- mis'd to adt in their behalf. In a word, fo foon as the Mo narch her Son was return'd to her Apartment, {he befought him 1 to remit the Surcharge which he had laid upon the poor Ame- nians in regard that by the Conceffions which the Kings his Pre- deceffors had granted to 'em upon payment of the Sum agreed, they were exempt from all other Impofitions. To which the King anfwered, J God's name let it be Immediate ly the Princefs difpatch'd away an Eunuch to give 'em notice of their difcharge; but the Eunuch, either through negligence, (pr otherwife, not meeting with thole he was fent to, the knew nothing of the Kings Difcharge. For indeed the Chief Heads of the to the number of Forty or Fifty, ignorant of the Kings mercy, and fearing left the General fhould fend to apprehend 'em, werefied to the Grand Portal of the Kings Houfe, call'd that is to fay, the High-Gate, which is a Sandtuary for all thole that are purfu'd by Juftice, and from whence no perfon can be taken without an exprefs Warrant from the King. Toward Evening, as his Majefty return'd from the Women's Palace to the Place where he gives his Audiences, it was told him that all the menians were got together in a riotous manner under the High Gate, and that they cri'd out againft the General for threatning co imprilbn 'em. To which the King made anfwer. thofe Armenians do there? I have Impojltion of Meal which was laid Hali-i\ouli-I\aan by my Order. All which, the General, being prefent, heard, but laid not a word, tho mad in his mind that he had mils'd his aim. Prefently feveral of the Officers ran with the news to the Armenians\nthtC2xc ; but blinded by their Deftiny, inftead of going home, they thought it had been a fnare only to draw 'em thence, and arrell 'em when they had-got 'em out of the Sanctu ary ; fo that they would not ftir, till they faw the King's Grace confom'd under his Seal.The Coronatio With this Relblve of theirs, the fame Officers returnd to the King ; but then the General finding his opportunity, laid he, had I not reajon to reprejent the Armenians were a company of Dogs, fuhmt to your Majejly more for fear i fee that they defjaijeyour dfyyal Word %;[ufmg obey your Orders ?

For befides that he had no defign upon their Lives, but only upon their Purfes; he confider'd that fuch a bloudy Execution, and the lols of lb many induftrious and underftanding Mer chants would be very prejudicial to the Kingdom and there fore falling upon his Knees, and imploring his Majefties Par don in behalf of thole miferable Creatures.

Which came to fifteen thoufand pound fterling. Immediately, con trary to any prefident that had ever been feen in Terfta, the menians were hurri'd from their Sanituary, which till then had bene always held inviolable, and committed into the hands of their Enemy, who lent 'em prifoners to a fair Palace for merly belonging to the Mir-aab, or the Prince of the Wa ters, where they had order to remain till they had paid their full Fine. This Imprifonment made 'em look about 'em, lb that they petition'd the General the lame day for their Releale, and that in acknowledgment of his favour they would give him the hundred Tomans which he had formerly defir'd to borrow, and that for their Fine, they would fummon the whole Town of Julfa, and caule a Contribution to be made for raifing the Sum impos d ;for that as for themfelves they were not able to pay it. ' How! cri'd the General, Dogs as they are, do they ' think the Sum imposed is to be paid by any other then them- ' lelves ? Do they imagine, that they who are rich fliall be ' exempt from the Burthen for the Poor to pay it ? They talk ofSo l y m a n III. Perfia.

The Merchants alone are able ' to pay a Fine of fifteen thoufand pounds ; and therefore no ' more words, nor no more contending, urilels they intend to ' have this Fine doubl'd. Neverthelefs the Armenians perfifted to plead their want of Money, and that it was impoffible for 'em toraife fuch a Sunt But at length there were two Indians who whether Out of their own good Nature, or whether it were at the requeft of the Armenians, who went to the General, and offer d to advance the faid Sum of fifteen thoufand pounds for the pro vided they would engage to repay it with Intereft, to which they agreed; and lb the bufinels was concluded in four days; and all the reft were releas'd but only the Governour, who remain ed aPrifoner ftill for fome Weeks till the whole Sum was fully paid; that is to lay, four thouland for the King, and five hundred to the General of the Army, which make fbme eighteen thouland pounds. And thus you lee what thefe People got by being wedded lb ftiffly to their own Interefts, for refufing the crafty old General the thoufand Crowns, which was all at, firfl: by him defir'd. This Fine fo confiderable was not paid neither by aU the Armenians, but by thofe only who are call'd Gkulfali. And here for his better Information, the Reader is to underftand, that G'tulfa, which is a part of the Suburbs of is inhabited altogether by Chriftians that came out of tho not at all from one part, and therefore they are divided into tWo Ibrts of Colonies. Of which the Principal is the Colony of the Giulfali, lb call d as being once the Inhabitants of Jtulfa a fmall Town in Armenia, built upon the Banks of who built this Burrough when they were tranfplanted to and gave it the name of their former Habitation. Since, and in thefe latter times the other being conftrain'd to remove from the Village where they had before leated them- lelves at one end of Jfpahan, came and fettl'd at the end of this new Town, adding new buildings to it, which make four diftmct, Quarters, the one call'd the Quarter of the Hirvmli, the other ofthe Nakjhivanli, as being Peopl d by the Native Inhabitants of two Cities in Armen and The other two are call'd Shams-abSheik-Sabani, in regard that they who inhabit 'em formerly liv'd in the two Suburbs of Ifpahan, Shams-ahad, or the Habitation of the Sun, and Sheik- Nnnnn Sahana,The Coronatio Sabana, the Habitation of the Ancient Now this Fine of eighteen thoufand pounds was only paid by the firft the reft, againft whom the General had no luch Antipathy, were difcharg'd all together from the Impofition of Meal only for fif teen thoufands pounds weight. The Guehm, who are the ancient or Fire Worfhip- pers, and who live at the fartheft end of the Town, were wholly difcharged upon their pleading Poverty it being well known that they were a miferable fort of People,and under great diftrels. The General of the Army, within afmall while after caus'd a Fine of thirty thoufand pounds to be paid to his Majefty,and in deed upon a much more rational and jufter fee re, by the who are a Ibrt of Indim 'Banians, lo call'd from one of the chief Cities of India, and the firffc that lies next to fperfta toward J^aud -Dar, becaufe the firft that frequented ferjia came from that City. Now two of thefe had Intelligence feveral years fince with the Minifters of the Indian King, and ferv'd him as Spies at Ijpahan, to give him private intelligence of all the Affairs and Intrigues of the IV- Jian Court and Kingdom; nor did they fail to write upoa all opportunities, and at that time taking hold of the opportunity of the Caravan which in the Spring time goes to the they fent Letters by that Caravan, among other things, that Aureng-Zeb ( for that was the Indian Monarchs name ) fhould not let ||ip this advantage of invading ferfia That he could never defire a more favourable Conjuncture, then that which now invited him j That there was nothing to hinder his Vido- rious Mar^h even lo lfpahan it felf^ for that the Prince himfelf was very Young,wanting both Experience and Courage: that he who bore all the fway under him, was an old Tyrant, the General of the Army; but in regard of his Age unfit for War; a,nd for his other Minifters, befides that they were perfons that had neither Courage nor Conduct, they were dilgufted with the Governmem. More then this, that there was a very great fcarcity in the Country of all lihings neceffary for humane fiip- port, efpecially in the Metiopoiis, where there was a general murmuring againft the diforders and bad management of the Governmentand that the general Rumours were, that Ttrfia was attaccmd in leveral places. In a word, that the could never have fuch an opportunity to conquer the Kingdom, and retake t^and-'Dar..

Officers of State, which thofe had prevail'd with a Painter to draw for a good Sum of Money, on purpofe to fend to the Indian that they might be known to the Monarch of that Country, This Plot was dilcover d by a little Slave belonging to the Painter. For about fix Weeks after the fecting forth of the Cara- van, his Mafter having beaten him to excefs, he attempted a Revenge above his Age and Condition. He ran to the Ge neral of the Armies houfe, and defir'd he might be admitted to fpeak with the General in private. But the Servants at firft would not permit him with a trifle of no importance to inter rupt the General, who had always an incredible Crowd of Peo ple waiting upon him, and a multitude of bufinefs upon his hands. Till at length being importunate to Ipeak with him, and urging the weight of the fecret which he had to difcove/, the Guards inform'd the General, who fent for him into his prelence, and demanded what he would have. To whom the Slave made anlwer, with an undaunted courage, that it was no? a fecret to be difcover d, but if he pleas'd to order the People to withdraw, or to retire himlelf, hefhould know his bus'nels in private. Notwithftanding all this the General at that time made little reckningof whathefaid, and they alfur'd me that it was three days'before the General would trouble himfelf to examine him. Till at length the Slave perlevering in his refo- lution never to difcover any thing but to himlelf in private, the General mov'd by his perfeverance, fent for him into a little Ca binet, where he difcover'd that his Mafter had drawn the Por traitures of the King and all the Grandees of the Court, and had fold 'em privately to the Indians to fend into India ; that three Dervicks ( fuch are thofe that out of a Religious Motive make a profeflion of Poverty ) carri'd thofe Portraitures into India, and that they came to his Mafter with the and hid 'em under the tatter'd Garments that they wore; that they hid certain Letters alio in the fame manner at the fame time, but of which he knew not the Contents, and that they went away with the Caravan for Caudar. The General of the Army was at a ftand whether he fhould give credit to the Depofition of this Slave or no. He tri'd him fometimes with threats, fometimes with promifes to lee if he could find him any way tripping or various in his ftory; not knowing but that it might be a talfliood of the Slaves Invention. But when he found himrelolute in the lame tale, and ftill affirming Poljtively the fame thing: and that he N n n n n affirm'dThe Coronation affirm'd it withall the Oaths which among the arc efteem'd to be moft dreadful, and that he offer'd his Life as a Gacre of what he had faid; the General refolv'd to dive into the bottom of the Affair. Thereupon he difpatch'd away two Horfemen after the Caravan, with a Warrant under the Kings hand to feize the perfons that were accus'd of carrying thole Letters and Portraitures. Which two Horfemen in a months time overtook the Caravan, and knowing the by the defcriptions which the Slave had giv'n } brought 'em Prifoners to Ifpahan. When .they were brought to the General of the Army, he fent for the Slave, and ask'd him if he knew thole poor people, and if they were the perlbns that carri'd the Letters and Portrai tures. The Slave alfur'd him that they were the men, and prefs'd 'em lb home that they began to ftagger in their Anfwers. Thereupon the General caus'd their Gloaths to be fearch'd, and their Tatters to be unripp'd, and there, as the Slave had declar'd, he found the Portraitures and the Letters low d up in feveral places. All which were carrid to the King, who having feen the Contents of the Letters fell into fuch a paflionate Rage, that he relblv d to put to death one part of the Indians, and to exterminate the reft out of his Dominions, tho they were above twenty thoufand. But the GeneraliJJimo, and the Chief Minifter endeavour d to appeale him, and humbly reprefented to him, that it was not reafon to punilli the Innocent with' the Guilty. In the mean time they could not make any dilcoveries of the Authors of the Letters; for the notwithftand- ing all the Torments and Tortures they were put to, would dilcover nothing: conftantly affirming, that they knew not who they were, nor their names, nor had ever been at their Houles. That as for what had been found about 'em, they met with thofe things in their Bundles at the Painters, and that the Indians that brought 'em,never told them either their Names, or their Habitations. Now in regard their Names were not lubferib d in the Letters, the General knew not what courfe to take to lift out the truth. He had caus'd the Principal of the to be apprehended, to the number of two hundred, but they were all releasd again except three, who paid for thofe that were guilty, if they tnemfelves were not the very perlons, ( for it never could be made out, and the fulpitions were very flight and therefore being thus in the dark, it was thought lufficient to confilcate a part of fo much of their Eftates as they could difcover, whichS O l y M a n III. King Pci fla. they found to amount to vaft Sums; of which neverthelefs, out of mcer pity they took no more then eight Thoufand To- mans, or thirty thoufand pounds: The reft was left 'em upon their pleading that what lecmdto be theirs, belong'd to Mer chants that liv d itj the Indies. As for the three perfons that carri d the Letters and Portraitures, and the Painter, they were drubbd with a wicncls; nor were they releasd till their Feet were fwell'd as big as their Heads with the violence of the blows. At the lame time Sha-'Maava^I\aan, Prince Governour of Georgia, lent his Son to the Court of Tcrfm to defire the King to beftow upon him the Employment ot or grand Pro- voft of Ifpahan, which appertain d to him of right, according to former agreements between the Kings of fer/M, and the Princes of Georgia. To which demand his Majefty was very umVilling to condelcend, becaufe he had already given away the Place : but his Minifters of State acknowledging the juftnels of his claim, Ipake fo effedually to the King, that the gian was invefted in the Employment, and I\elb-Haly-'Bek was order d to refign, who was recompens d with an Employment altogether as confiderable. For the better underftanding of which paffage we muft ob- ferve, that when Hahas the Great became the Mailer of (which he obtain'd rather by flight then by force by thole inares into which he drew poor Temura^-Jyaan, who was the laft King of Georgia ; he propos'd to him great advantages, provided he would lubmit himfelf to his Empire, and acknowledge his So vereignty ,â€¢ and among the reft that the Employment of Grand Provoft of Ifpahan fhould for the future belong to one of the Children of the Prince of Georgia, and that it fhould delcend by inheritance to his Succelfors to perpetuity. Which has been faithfully all along oblerv'd to this time, and the Son of the Prince of Georgia always holds that Employment. A third Vacancy was alio Hippli'd, that is to lay, the Go vernment of Shamaky, which encompafles one part of the Southern Media, and another of Hyrcania. And this was givn to Sepher l^ouli JQtan, or the Princely Slave of the Armies. It became vacant by the Death of Negef-i\outt-I\aan, one of the braveft Lords of Terjia, generous and ftout, who by his Re- lolution and Courage had rais'd himlelf to that high Dignity. The European Merchants trading in Jewels haveolten tafted of his generous Liberality; for he did not only latisfie 'em for their Jewels, but carrefs'd 'em with Habits, Prefents, and good Chear. During10Z The Coronatio During thefe Tranfa&amp;ions in the Capital City of fer/w, the Frontiers were greatly apprehenfive of a War, that threaten'd 'em from all parts. Courriers came thick and threefold to Jfpdan, fome from the Confines of and Media, who brought intelligence of feveral defigns which the JQJfacks, the Tusheks, and other were fufpeded to be forming againft the Empire. Others from the Confines toward Turkic and India, who brought no lefs unpleafing Tydings. However at Court they fear'd no War but only from thofe two fides, elpecially the latter: for the Turks had their hands full at Candy. As for thÂ£ Indian King, all concurring Probabilities made 'em conjecture that he would engage in a War againft 'P erfia. For befides that he was naturally of a haughty and Ambitious Difpo- fition }that he was quiet at home, and had nothing to fear from abroad, he had a fair pretence to revenge the Affr6nts which his Embaffkdour Terviet-iyaM had receivxt m Terjia. For in the Life of Habas II. we flialigive a full account of that Embafladour, who came to Ifpaha in the year i according to our account, with a Train of eight thoufand men ; as alio of the Prefents which he brought, fo rich as is hardly to be be- liev'd, as well in refpeÂ£t of thofe which the King accepted, as thofe which he refus'd. We fhall alfo there declare the Occa- fion of his Embaffie, and of his ftay in the Court of 'Terjia, the publick Affronts which Hahas put upon him, on purpofe in his Own to affront the Perfon of his Mafter Aureng-Zeehy and to revenge himfelf for his delay in not fending his Em- bafladour before; and laftly, we fhall defcribe the Prefents which the King of Terjia gave the Embafladour to carry to his Mafter. Habas II. di'd about fifteen days before the Embaffa- dour arriv'd at his own Mafter's Court; who therefore not knowing as yet of his Death, and having had an account from his own EmbafTadour of the bad ufage he had receiv'd in the Court of 'Perjta, teftifi'd his refentment with a more then ordinary fury. He prefently degraded upbraiding him for a Coward, and telling him he fhould rather have di d then have fuffer'd fuch affronts. He caus'd all the goodly Horfes which the Verjian had fent him, to the number of Sixcore, to be brought out into the great Tia^a of Dehly, his Royal Re- fidence, and there cut off their Legs. Afterwards, he caus'd all the coftly Stuffs of Gold and Silk, the and all other Prefents fent him by the Terjian Monarch to be publickly burnt, and,S o l y m a n III. Perfia. and, as if he refolv'd to declare open War, he forbad his Subjeas all manner of Commerce with the Vtrfiam either by Land or Sea, and fent exprels Orders to all the Ports of Mia that no Indian Veffels fhouid ftir out of the Kingdom. The news of thefe proceedings coming to made moft people believe that nothing but a War was intended, and every one prepar d for it. But they that had a deeper reach, were not fo pofitiye in their judgments, tho they durft not difcover their thoughts. But he who moft upheld this news of an War, and gave moft credit to it, was GemJ)nd-%am^mlar y AgacieyGeneral of the Slaves, a great Favourite at Court, and as a Friend efteem'd by the General of the Army. This fame Grandee, being one of the falfeft perfons that ever were, during the firft nine Months of the New King's Reign, had conttiv'd fo many dangerous defigns, as well againft the Meaner lort as againft the Grandees, that at lengeh fome of his practices being dilcover d, he became odious to all, and had drawn upon him- IHf the llniverfal hatred of the Courtiers; lo that he was Efficiently apprehenfive that he could not refill fo many Ene- mies k True it is, that he had the favour of the King and the General of the Army; yet was it not fo alfufd that he could promiie himfelf the continuance of it for any long time. Therefore he thought the fafeft Courle he could take at fuch a ticklifh conjunfture was to retire as- far from the Courc as he could undeu ai fpecious and very honourable pretence; And in regard the Government of ppdented him aw opportunity fo favourable to his defign he endeavour'd to have the Grant of it. To that purpofe he labour'd the confirmation of the faife reports that were Ipread of the War which the King of the Indies threaten'd againft Ter/ta. He gave his Majefty Intelli gence, which he laid was moft certain, that the Indian Prince Was coming to befiege Candabar with a mighty Army ; that the better to accomplim his defigns,. and draw the luskes to; his Party, he had fent 'em fifty Lacres of amounting to about fix hundred thoufand pounds fterling, upon condition that they would declare open Hoftilty againft that rengh Zmh himfelf had already tak'n the Field. In a word, he knew lb well how to lay his Stories lb cunningly together, and to render the Terrors and Affrights which he forg'd lo probablej that all the bufinefs was now to apply remedies to thofe Mif- chiefsthat were thought to be lb near approaching, and lb dan- gerous. Thereupon he counterfeits himfelf to be the moft faithfulThe Coronation faithful Subject, and moft paffionate for his Countries welfare in the World. He vow'd that he himfelf fliould be the as they call it, or the Sacrifice that would be offer'd for the fafety of the People, and that he would go himfelf to and there expole his own Pcrlon to the firft Aflaults of his Enemies. He alio engages the General of the Army in this Intrigue; who befides was willing enough of himfelf to re turn him like for like, and to repay him for the kindnefs he had done him,as we have already related. The King therefore per- fuaded by thefe two Lords that were his Confidents, the one the General of his Armies, and the other General of his Slaves, aranted to the latter what he contended for with fo much heat, and gave him a Commiflion to raife men for with hopes of the Government it (elf in a fhort time. Which was no fmall joy to this fame contriver of Wiles and Intrigues,who thereby thought himfelf fafe fhelter'd from all thofe milchiefs which his turbulent Ipirit had brought upon him. We have already told ye that this Lord was always look'd upon as a notorious Cheat, and that in the Keign of II. being fiipported by the favour of his Prince he had put a hun dred tricks upon the Court: that he took money at that time of all that offer a it him : promifing to help 'em to the Offices and Employments for which they fu'd: but that when he had their money, he prefently forgot all his Promifes: that it was his paftime to fbw difcord, and kindle the Coals of Diffention: that he forg'd dangerous Calumnies and Accufations againft his Competitors, and with a brazen forehead utter'd 'em to the King for real Truths. As to other things he was a comely well proportion'd Perfbn, a man of great Courage and Wit, dextrsufly handl'd his Arms, and liberal to Magnificence: fo that he might have pals'd for one of the braveft men in the World, had it not been for that lame black Malignity that in- fe&lt;fted all the reft of his Anions. In a word, there never was in one man a greater Medley of good and bad Qua lities. His good Qualities gain'd him the affection of his Maflers â€¢, his bad ones render'd him odious and formidable to his Equals: and having gain'd the Affe&amp;ion of his Young Sovereign, as he had won the favour of his Father, he praftis'd the lame fooleries under the new Prince as before. One of the firft mifchievous Pranks fell upon Mr^a Ibrahim, or Abraham, Vaster, or ^oyal Farmer of or Media; which is one of the richeft in all From this perfon hewas m boLY ^AN in. I(mr of Perfia. ~ !o5 ne icjueez d four rhouland pounds, and withal brought hiirTinto fo much trouble that hccaus'd him to lofe the gretteft part of his Lftate, and to fall under that difpleafure of his Prince, that he could never fince recover himfelf, nor is k thought he ever will And thus it hapned : The General of the Slaves having a defign to get that Sum of four thoufand pounds, addrelfes himielfto the Nephew of that rich Farmer; for the Uncle was then at Taum where his Employment lay. This was a yOune Gentleman, the Son of Mr^a Sadek or jujl Farmer alfo 7 the Province of Pars, not inferiour to the other for profit. And this Young Lord had alfo at Court the Employment of Erbaeb Tahuel, or Chief Surveyour of the Kings Buildings and Houles in Ifpahan. To whom the General of the Slaves one day taking him afide thus delivers himleli What makes thy Mirza- Ibrahim now at Tauris? Why does he not come any more fit than he to fupply the place of Trime Maho met Mekdy who enjoys it atprefent is a Buffiehead, Chanrelmjr unfit to manage puhltch hufenefs.

If thou wilt give me a thou/and ( or four thoufand pounds) I dare undertake, inflead Vazier of vince to make him Grand of all Pcriii. To this the young Lord, repli d, that he would confider of it: ana no fooner had he left the General 5 but he difpatchcs in all haft a Courrier to hisUncle ? to let him know what the General of the Slaves had piopos d to him. Upon which the Vaster by the lame Courrier fends an Order to his Nephew to pay the Money deman ded j which was done accordingly. Soon after another Courrier arrives at Ifpahan from Myr^a Ibrahim. For he a (Turd himfelf of his advancement to the Chief Miniftry^ and fo much the rather, becaufe he conceiv d himfelf fit for fuch a Dignity, as indeed he was; and therefore to facilitate his Preferment, by the fame Courrier he befought leave of his Majefty that he might come and kils his Feet j fmce it could be no prejudice to his Majefty, in regard his Son was able to fupply his Place. The other Minifters, who knew nothing of the Intrigue, never imagind that fuch a permi/Con could be any way prejudicial to their In- terefts, or that it was only a pretence for the foundation of a more Important Defign. So that his Requeft was granted,and an Order fign'd for him to come and kifs the Kings Feet, leaving his Son to fupply his Place. O o o o o While mm Bi u7 he Coronation WhileThde two Courricrs were coming and going, a re port, that was only whifperd about, came to the Ears of Mtr^ci Jbrahams Nephew, that the General of the Slaves was ready to depart for Caniaar. Thereupon he labours more ex- adly to inform himfelf, and underftanding it was too true, he bethought himfelf of the Thoufand which he had paid him in his Uncles behalf, which were like to be loft if he did not fpeedily look about him. Thereupn he went and gave the General of the Slaves a Vifit, and civilly hinted to him to be mindful of the promife which he made to bring his Uncle into his Majefties favour, and of the Money which he had paid him upon that confideration : that he underftood the General of the Slaves was going to leave the Court, to the ruine of his Uncle's Intereft: or at leaft if the bufinefs fhould fucceed it would not by his procurement; and therefore befbught him to return the four thoufand pounds which he had paid him. At which requeft the General of the Slaves did not feem to be in the leaft offended ; but made anRver, that 'twas all the reafon in the world, and fo appointed a certain time to repay the Sum. Which time being come, he fent him away again with the fame anfwer from one day to another. Still Mtrza him s Nephew follow'd him dole without letting any opportu nity flip: but ftill the young Lord was as careful to fpeak lofcly, or when he was alone, for fear of divulging a fecrct that would have been the ruine of his own and his Uncle's Family. At length the General of the Slaves, afham'd of having put off the young Lord fp many times, and now being run to the end of his Rope, as one that had no more Excufe make, he refolv'd to break off at once with the that he might deliver himielf from his importunate Sollicitor. To this purpofe, one Evening, at the time that he was ready to go to his Prayers, and from thence to Court (for 'tis the Cuftom of the Mahumetans to lay their Prayers in Publick) perceiving the young Lord at a diftance advancing toward him, he took that opportunity when there was a great number of People and fe- vcral perlbns of Quality to hear himat what time, as loon as the young Lord came near him, fetching a deep figh, and lifting up his Eyes and Arms to Heaven, laid he, [hall I do with this man, he purfues me every w will not give me time to Jay my my Haram among my Women; I go; prithee Friend what wouldfi h fat it fie JQng of Perfia, to mate thy Mtmjler ?Solyman II I. /(/^/Perik Tretke ^ to Us Majefly â€¢ the hufmefi d^m^klnrnv Tower. J Youmay eafily judge what a Thunder Clap this was to the young Lord ; he would not for ten times the Sum that he had provok d thofe Expreffions from a man fo ill princiDl'd â€¢ he repented with all his heart that he had preli'd him fo clofe but 'twas too late : for Mirza Plot was thereby difcover d ; and all the Court that knew him rightly believ'd twould coft his Ambition faucej as indeed it fell out. By a Quirk of the fame nature, , the General of the Slaves had already formerly hook'd out of the Na^ir or Lord Trea furers Pocket three hundred Tomans, which make a thoufand pound, at the time that the Court return'd To which purpofe the cunning Fox went to him at his houfe all in a heat, and after he had drawn him afide. faid he erne toajjure you, that your H praBice Enemies had endanger d, is nowfecure.

The fame Prank he plai d Mtr^a that is, Slot, the Nazjr, or Superintendant of the Stables who was drawn in by him for about nine thoufand pounds bv making him believe that he had proteded him againft Potent Accufers, who fought to bring him under his Majeftiesdifplea- fure. But that was not all, for that he was refolv'd to imploy his Credit with his Mafter, as to raife him from being Trea surer of the Stables to be Treafurer of the Kings Demeans, in the room of Mac-Soud-!Bec, who undelervedly enjoy'd the Em ployment, and whole head already totter'd upon his flioulders; for that the King was refolv'd that none of thofe fliould live who had oppos'd his Advancement to the Throne. Upon his Departure alio, that he might leave fome marks behind him of his malicious Cunning, he refolv'd to fet the King's two Chief Eunuchs (who are petty Kings in the Palace together by the ears to the mutual perdition of each other; that is the Mehther or Lord Chamberlain; and the Jga or Over- feer of the Queen Mothers Houfhold. To that purpofe he went to the High Chamberlain, to tell him as a fecret of great Importance, and which the Friendship Ooooo x he'The Coronatio he had for him, obligd him to reveal that Aga Moubarek took all opportunities to flander and accufe him tothe King but that his wickednefs fell upon his own head: for that he had often heard his Majefty fay, that he could no longer endure the Back biting Tongue and Malignity o that perlon ; that he was re- folv'd to have put him to death, and had done it already, had it not been for fome remainder of kindnefs he has for him ; for thefervice he did him at his Fathers death ftopt his dilpleafure. At the fame time he went to AgaMouh and told him alio the very fame Story of the Chamberlains Inveteracy againft him So that the two Eunuchs fofter'd for fome time a fecret and 'implacable hatred one againft the other: both expefting when the effeds of the Princes Anger would break out to the mine of his Enemy, according as the General of the Slaves had fed their hopes. But the time being elaps d, and nothing hapnine of what they were made believe ^ they began to doubt the truth of what he had inform'd 'em. And therefore know ing-the Author of the Story to be a great forger of Lies, they refolv'd to find out the truth. , r n . .. r The Mehther or High Chamberlain was the hrlt that dilco- ver'd it. For being faluted one day with the ufual Comple ments, the Great Chamberlain coldly repli'd, There's that coldly falutes my Ears, hut ft and then drawing him afide. What mhindnefs, faid he, that you jhould go about to procure m me odious to the ^Prince as you do every day: all my comfort is, you will not befojuc- cefsful in your enterprise a* you think for. i r i r Jga Mouharek finding thereby a Gate opened for difcovery, 'Tistot for you, faid he, hut for me to complain. Forts tt not you that have been continually pealing in the J^ings Ears fuch and fuch Jlories concerning me; which had been enough to have taken away my life, had his Majefty given credit to your Tales, but thanks be to Cod they were not behev d. The two Eunuchs were fo ftrangely furpriz d to find them- felves upbraided with the fame unkindneffes, that they began to compare their accufations of each other, with which they were chargd, and that Examination atlaft difcoverd that it was but a (Romance, tho a pernicious Romance, which the General of the Slaves had compos'd to let thofe two Lords together by the Ears, and to make his advantage of their quarrelling. Never- thelels feeing the dark contrivance had not flicceeded altoge ther, they diffembl'd' their refentment at prefent, and laid nothing: refolving to wait for an opportunity of Revenge, which7 S o l y m a n III. Perfia. j which they vow'd fliould never efcape 'cm, wheneverk ofterd it felf. Thefe Eunuchs are very ready at thefe kind of dark Contri vances : there being no people in the World that know how to carry on a private Revenge by clofe and covert means, and then give fire to the Mine of a fudden, fo well as they do: nor did they fail to pay this crafty Deceiver in his own Coin j For it is thought that they were the perfons who mainly contributed to his difgrace and death. Sut now fo loon as the General of the Slaves had receiv'd his Commiffion for the Government of and to withftand the Invafion of the Indians, he began to raife Sol diers at IJpahan, which he caus'd to be exercis'd every day, with fo much exadnefs, as if the Enemy had been at the Gates': and after he had mufter'd together four thoufand, all ftout proper fellows, he declar'd he would raife no more, that Recruit be ing fufficient: and he order'd his bufinefs fo well by the affi- ftance of the General of the Army, that the King, whom they alfur'd that the Enemy was at hand, caus'd his difpatches to be made for Serdaay or Chief General of IQindar, and the Ter ritories belonging to it, and made him Governour of the Pro vince and City it felf, being a famous Garrifon, and the Key of the Kingdom toward India. It is feated upon three rifing Grounds, which defend each other; theTerftans efteemintr k im pregnable, and it is a Proverb amongft 'em. Habitation of fecurity ? Alluding to the wordCandaar, which fig- nifies the fame thing. Before this Lord departed he obtain'd of the King, that his Brother ThereidonSeh, fhould fupply his Place of General of the Slaves, as his Lieutenant, till his Son, to whom the Prince had granted the Reverfion, fhould be of years to manage it himfelf: and not content with that, he alfo procur'd an Order from the King, by which his Majefty gave him leave to come to Court when he pleas'd, without asking leave. And thus Gemjhid- K aan departed well fatisfi'd, conceiving with himfelf, that he had craftily difintangl'd himfelf from all thole troubles which his ill management had brought upon him at Court. Some few days after this Lord was thus departed there was no more talk of the War 5 on the other fide it was evident there would be none. For the report ran about, that Zeeb underftanding that Hahas 11. was dead, and that his Succeffor was but young and unexperiehe'd, fcorn'd the En counter of fo trivial an Enemy. Which (Rodomontado of the IndianThe Coronation jy^Tpdnce to fave his Honour might have held good in the time of the ^fians, who were the at what time they never enter'd into Combat but for Honour. But now Monarchs never fight hand to hand, nor in fingle Duels to try each others ftrength. But they fight Army againft Army, and their only aim is the Conqueft of Cities and Provinces, aflailing whatever they think they can mafter. All the World knew that for three months after the death of Habas II. was known in the Mie the Prince of that Coun try ftill continu'd his preparations of War, in order to the befieging of Candaar ; of which this was an evident proof, for that all that while, all Commerce was forbidden with Terfta as before. Which would not have been, had the Prince abandon'd his defigns of the War, in derifion of his feeble Enemy, whom he thought too young to be the fubjed: of his Triumphs, The truth was, as I have heard from very Intelligent per- fons. that Aunng-Zeeh was diverted from his Enterprize by the Princefs his Sifter, who us'd thefe Arguments to him, That it was not proper for him to hazard the Honour he had won; that till that time he had Reign'd in high Reputation, which he could never lofe fo long as he kept himfelf quiet. That For tune could not make him greater then he was, but that ftie might prove fro ward to his prejudice. That the taking of daar was no luch eafie thing, which his Father had twice with two potent Armies attempted in vain. That the chiefeft part of his Courtiers being Terjtans, they would ferve him very unwillingly, and affift him but coldly; and in a word, That if he did not fucceed in the War, it would be a ftain to his Re putation, which he would never be able to wipe out. Efpe- cially fince his Reputation had no need of this Conqueft to aggrandize it lelf, as being fufficient to lupport it felf without it. To which reafbns of his Sifter the Prince (ubmitted: and without doubt he did wifely; there being nothing lo true as what the Princefs told him, that there was little to be got by the Enterprize, but much to be loft. The General of the Slaves before,now General of the Armies, had not been gone above a Month from Court, when Ibrahim arriv'd at Ifpahan in a trembling and quivering condi tion, after he had been put in fuch great hopes. For he had been inform'd at Tauris, what a Trick the General of the Slaves had put upon him, and how he had difcover'd the whole fecret of his Project. However having receiv'd a permiffion to comeS O L Y M A N III. King of Perfia. to Court, there was anecefficy for him to go: lb that being re duce! to this extremity he was not lb eager upon his journey : he made but How preparations, and delay'd his departure as long aspoffibly he could; excufing himfelf fometimes by realbn of the bad weather, the bad of the Planets, or his own Indifpolition of body. But at length go he muft, but he travell'd fuch eafie days journeys, that he Ipent double the time that he needed to have done; and perhaps he did it to fhun his meeting with the General of the Slaves upon the Road, being upon his march to his New Government. How he was receiv'd at Court you may eafily judge: for there was not one living foul that vouchfafd him a kind look. So that to mollifie the hearts of the Grand Minifters and Potent Lords, he wasfore'dto expend a good part of the Treafure that he had hoarded up, and to luffer himfelf to be delpoyl'd of that which he had pillag'd from the People. And as for the Grand Minifters the better to accomplifh their defign of fqueezing Rich Prefents out of his Coffers, they back'd all Complaints that were made againft him at Court. For you muft underftand that in 'Perjia, every private Perlbn, let his Condition be never lb mean, is allow'dto bring his Complaints againft the Governours, Royal Farmers, and other Perlbns, who have any Authority over 'em. So that when the Grandees at Court have a mind to mine any great Perfonage in the Pro vinces abroad, there ufual Policy is to fupport the Complaints of the Opprefs'd ; and to make em the more Ponderous, they invite all that will come, and then caule 'em to appear at the Palace in fhoals to demand Juftice. Which courfe was taken with this lame Lord. But in regard the Principal Courtiers had no mind utterly to mine him, which had been only a particular benefit to the King; but rather to fhew him, that it lay in their power, to the end they might make their beft advantage of him themlelves, they would not fuf- fer the Clamours of his Impeachers to run too high j but fatisfi'd the greateft part, by cauling him to reftore to his moft dangerous Acculers a part of what he had extorted from them. But among all the reft his greateft Enemy at Court was that Brutifli Old Signior, the Generalijfmo, Hali-Kouli-K^aan, who mortally and lb openly hated him, that he would neither ac cept of his Vilits, nor his Prelents. The realbn of which ani- mollty was, becaule that in the Reign of Habas II. about twel ve years before his death, when the General of the Army, being .thenr : â–  ill H ? in luil 11 ^ X The Coronatio then in his Government of Tauris, fell a fecond time under the difpleafure of his Prince, for the reafons already related, and after a Confifcation of all his Goods, was Tent a Prifoner to Cashin, Mirza-Sadek, Brother of this being at that time Fanttcr ^oyctl of the lame City and Piovince, was ap pointed Commiffioner by his Majefty for the Tale of thole Confifcated Goods: At what time he carn'd himfelf fo rigo- roufly that he took away the very Tomb am or Linnen Drawers belonging to his Wives, and fold 'em in open Market; for in regard the dilgrac'd Lord had feveral Wives, and for that the (perjlan Ladies are all lumptuouily habited; there are fome of thefe under-Drawers that are worth thirty or forty Crowns â€¢&gt;fo that a good number might come to a great deal of Money. This Affront touch'd the General to the Qiiick, and enrag'd him to that excefs againft the whole Family, that he gave it its full fwinge, firft againft the Vaster himfelf, who had given him the Affront.. For after he was reftor'd, and found he had power to do what he pleas'd, he fent for him, and not lb much as vouchlafing to fee him when he arrived, he caus'd him to be fliut up in his Stables ; where to do him the greateft Injury that could be done him in 'Tcrfid } he expos'd him to the beaftly Paffi- on of fix lufty Grooms. Mtrza Ibrahim was not ignorant of all this, and knew how far the Tranfports of his Pride and Cruelty was able to carry him: he law him newly reftor'd, and advane'd to the third dignity in the Kingdom ,â€¢ and that which was of more im portance, that he was the Chief in favour, and that the King liften'd to him as his Governour. For thole reafons he conje- ifhir'd rightly that among thole that fought his mine, there was not any one who. had more Power, or a greater good Will. Therefore he relblv'd to purchale his favour, whatever it coft him ; or if he could not oblige him to do him a kindnefs, at leaft that he would be pleas'd to hold his tongue. To which purpofe he Went to give hima Vifit, defiring he might be ad mitted to pay him Reverence. At firft when the enterd the General of the Army pretended not to lee him, but feign ing as if his head ak'd, call'd for a Couch to lie down, where after he had lain about two hours, he retir'd into his Palace^ leaving a great throng of People that waited without to come another time, and among the reft However Mir^a Ibrahim would not take this for a denial, but return'd the next day ; To whom the General, taking no noticenotice that he had demanded leave to be admitted to make his falutation in the great Hall where he difpatcli d all Comers and Gc)ers, gave him no Anfwer, fo that the poor Lord was forcd to ftand three hours together among the Officers and Common Perfons j and after that he pafs d by him without fo much as looking upon him, and fo took horfe before his Palace Gate. 'Mtrza Ibrahim follow'd him ;and keeping clofe to him, ever now and then gave him the ufual Salute of My yee, and that lb loud that he might eafily be heard. At firft the General of the Army faid nothing to him; but finding the other ftill purllie him, tir'd with his importunate Complements, turning about, Gidifegh, Curfed laid he, do with thee, or thou with me? Go thee more. And having lb laid, he caus'd his Servants to thruft him away. Poor Mir^a Ibrahim leeing himfelf lb courlely usd, made trial of Prelents, the great Spring that moves the whole Court of Terjia. To that purpole he fent the General twothouland Tomans, which the General refus'd; the other believing 'twas too little lent again two thouiand five hundred; which were fent back as before; then he lent three thouland, which had no better acceptance ; after that four thouland, which ftill could make no impreffion in the haughty Spirit of the Exafpera- ted Lord ; So that at length he fent five thouland which comes to twenty thouland pounds. And then, fomewhat liippl'd, he invired Mir^a Ibrahim two days after to his Megetes, or Publick Feaft: neverthelels he fhew'd him no particular Ci vility, nor laid any thing to him, more then what is ufually Ipoken to all the Gue(is,I^ochs-Geldi,T I cjueftion d the truth of this Prelent of twenty thoufand pounds when I heard it related the firll time, not believing that any perlbn would purchaie any mans favour at lb dear a Rate, but afterwards up on farther examination I found it to be really true. And I the rather give this Advertifement to the Reader, that he may not miftruft the fidelity of my Relations, or think that I Ipeak by and not upon any exaft information. All this while the Kings diftemper increas'd upon him, that he could ride no longer, lo that he never went abroad with his Wives but in a i\agta veh, which are little wooden fheds carri'd by gread Camels, wherein they ufually put their Women, when they go to take the Air. In this Condition he continued a month : tho all the while he would not forbear his ufual recreations with his Wives. The P p p p p I\ounmksThe Coronation o J^ourrourks concinu'd in all the parts round about the Prince caus'd all the handfom women to be taken up, i nd brought to his One day the Queen Mother had a dclire to fee the Fortrefs of the City, where are kept all the Curiofities and rarities belong ing to the prefent Monarch, and his Anceftors, whether Pre- fents, or Purchas'd, or Trophies of their Conquefts. To Which purpofe fhe perfuaded her Son to carry her thither j fo that there was a J^ourrouk proclaim'd all over one pare of the City, which was never known, or at leaft never rernembred by any body then alive. Now it haepn'd that one time, as the King was thus fporting himfelf abroad with his Wives, an Accident/ell out, that ren- der'd 'em ftill more unfupportable to the People. His Majefty at that time lay in the Fields without I/pah an, under Tents, in Harveft time, when the flieaves lay heap'd up one upon another in the Grounds, and as he was one that greatly delighted in - Fireworks,fome flying Rockets were prefented him one Evening of an extraordinary weight ( for there are fome that weigh forty pounds )of which he order'd a trial to be made. But their extraordinary weight hindering the Ma/fie Squib from mount ing diredly upwards, as it fliould have done, and fo not flying very high, they made a kind of a Semicircle at a diftancc, which carri'd 'em a great way into the Fields, where they fee the Sheaves on fire, and burnt the Corn together with lonae houles that flood not far oft. So that the lols was valu'd at fixteen thoufand pounds; and the mifery was, that this accident happen d when there was great fcarcity of Corn. Here I cannot omit a fmall Circumflance, which has fbme affinity with what I have already Ipoken concerning that Ipacious place full of Trees, and Alleys that compofe the Avenues to the Palace ; through one of which, calld the Royal Alley, the King and his Train went always in and out, to avoid paffing through the City. The other great Alleys were adorn d with Beds and Borders planted with Flowers and fweet fmelling herbs, which together with the Fountains andRowsof Trees caus da very plealant profpeÂ£t. In the mean time came certain intelligence that were enter'd into the Province of or The Governour of the Province fent Courrier after Courrier to the King for Orders 5 for that the Enemy was already enter'd the Kingdom, burning and fpoiling all before 'em; and that unlefs (peedily oppos'd, the Province would be in danger to be loft. The. S o L Y M A N III. E^ng Perfia. The lushecks are a People that inhabit to thTWorth of fpt^T Poffeffing all that Country between the Cafam Sea and the Indies- under feveral petty Sultans or Princes, abfolute within them- felves. They are called lusbech, at leaft if the Verftan Etymo logy be true, by reaion of the great number of Sovereign Prin ces by which the Tartars are Governedfor as well in the Language pf the Tartars as Turks, which is but a Dialed of it lignifies a hundred, and Beh, Lords ^ to fiiew the great number of Matters by which they are Rul'd. But thofe People rejea: that Etymology, which they fay is both falfe and injurious to em; That the true Etymolgy is Tuft, which fignifies He in both Languages (tho pronounc'd Jus by cutting oft the laft Vowel) and Bek, Lord. So that when they fay 'tis as much as to fay, He the L-ordy or Ifc is t as if thelc People were the only People upon the Earth that are truly Lords. Such is the pride of this Nation, and the high conceit they have of their own merits. One of the principal Lords of the Perfian Court, when he told me this he gave me an account of certain petty King that Reign'd in the Moluccas in the time of the Great, who neverthelefs alfum'd to himfelf a Grandeur almoft equal to his: For he look'd upon himfelf to be the only lawful Lord of the Eaft, and alfum'd to himfelf the Title of fole Monarch of it: Saying withal, that he knew not whether there were any other in the Weft; but that he was well alfur'd, that He himfelf was Matter of that part of the World where he inhabited. For which reaibn he caus'd his Dominions to be call'd by way of Excel lency Moulouk ; that is to fay, the true Kingdoms; for tho we pronounce the word Moluccas after our Manner, over all AJta they write and pronounce it Moul But among all thofe petty Princes that Govern lartary the lefs, there are three who are accounted the Principal. That is to fay, the Prince of Bokora, the Prince of and the Prince of Carechme , or Orquenge, upon which the reft in Ibme manner or other have have their dependence. In the Reign of the Second, which the 'Perfians for diftindjon fake call Ma^i, the pafs d (Reign, he being Grandfather to the prelent King; thefe Juzbecks overrunning the Territories of Corajjon, or and Margiana, were purlu'd by the who made a dilmal flaughter among 'em ;after they had gain'd a moft fignal Vi ctory over the Enemy, killing twelve of eighteen Thouiand, of which their Body confifted, and taking the reft Prifoners. Among thele Captives there was a young Prince, one of the Cheiftaines of the Tartars, delcended from thÂ« Royal Line of PpFFF 2The Coronat Karechme or Orquenge, who was call d the ther-Mher. This Pnfoner, being known to be what he was, among the reft of the Prifoners was carry d to IJpahan, but his ufage was quite different. For Sefii did not look upon him as a Robber but as a Prince who was only a Pnfooer of War, and paid him all thofe Honours and Civilities due to a Perfonage of Royal Birch; affign'd him a Revenue of fifteen hundred To- mans, which amounts to fix thoufand pounds - gave him a ftate- â€¢ ly Palace furnifli d accordingly, a number or OmcerSj and a fuitable Train to attend him. And it was his Plealure, that the Vazier, or Treafurer to the Governor of Ifpahuu flioulci take care of his Perfon, and perform the Office of a Mehmandaar, who is the Perfon, as we njiay fay, that takes care of the Guefts, and is the Mafter of the Entertainment. This Mehmandaarjot ten years together paid this Tartar- Prince by his Majefties Order alt the Refped and Service which the rights of a moft tender Hofpi- tality could reafonably claim 5 and iuch as there could not be any thing fliew d him more obliging in our beft civiliz d Provinces.On the other fide, the Prince underftood fo well how to difguife the natural Savagenels and Barbarity of the Tartars, that you would have taken him for a Terfean, he behav'd himfelf with fuch a Grace, and fo much affability in all things: So that his Majefty obfervincr him endow'd w T ith lo many rare Qyalities, ftraind his afFedion for him fo high, that he admitted him into his Megeles or Royal Affemblies, where he rank'd him equal with the Gran dees of his Kingdom, and for his maintainance affign d hir*^ Pen- fions that were no way inconfiderable. During his abode at JfpahaUy where be had liberty to go and come as he pleas d, only attended by his Mehnenduar and the Guards that were affignd him, more in honour to his Perfon,then for a Watch on his Freedom; he had ftill in his mind a natural hankering after his own Country, his Kindred, and that Sove reignty to which he was lawful Heir. The Magnificence^ the- Mildnels, the Beauty and delights of ^Perjta could not eradicate out of his Breaft this violent aifedion for the place of his Nati vity. For tho it were true, that nothing but Barrennels and a hideous profped overfpread the Country tor which he had fuch a lingring delire 3 however,it was the place where he was born,and where he was to change the condition of a Slave for that of a Mafter. Importun'd therefore by his own ardent defires he wrote privately to the King of Orquenge his Father, and befought him to endeavour his Liberty. Who having confulted what courfe to take, pretends an occafion to fend an Embaflador into (Per-o L Y M A N III of p er j] a /?â€ž who brought to the Prtnce the King his Fathers anfwer. And at length the Pnnceand theEmbaflado? agreed upon the man net of his efcape j And then the Embaflarfor after a ftay of fix Months cook his leave of the Courr. Burthen was that the Prince, whm he rhoiighr the Enabaflidor was got beyond the Bounds of and that it was liafonable for him to make his efcape, laid bis Plot in this manner. He feignd himfelf one day to be very ill, and gave notice of his Indilpofition to the King: He added, that he had trv'd fe vera! medicines to no purpole, and therefore by the advice of his Phyficians, he bebev d there was no other cure for him but by the hot Baths about a days journey from I/pa/wi, whither he eahly obtain d leave to retire: at what time the Trcafurcr to the Governor of Ifpahan, whole Employment would not permit him to ftir out of the City, gave him for an attendant in his Room one of his Matters Domeftick Servants, with a Convoy or ntteen or lixteen Perlbns. ; At the time prefix'd there appear'd under the Trees without the Village near the Baths, whither the Prince pretended to go ror his Health, about twenty Yall young chofen fellows nimble well Mounted, and well Arm'd with certain Led-Horfes 1 relently the Prince knew 'em, and without any further Conful- tation, leaving the fmall number of which were then with him, up he gets a Horleback and putting Spurs to his Horle away he gallops directly forward before his own Troop. There was not any one unlefs his Perfian Guide that foliow'd him, as dreaming of nothing lefs then the accident that had fallen out, neither had they men enough, nor time to call for more aid. And therefore the Deputy Mehmandaar, feeing he had loft the areat Truft that was committed to his charge, all that he could do, in luch a furpnze, wasftill to follow him, and try if his prayers and intreaties could move him to return. laid He, Crime, what is my Ill-fortune, or Ojfence agatnjl you, that you thus go about t llpahan without your f erf on &gt;What expeel Head?Nay, I fear the tying will not b niJJment, hut without doubt in the Bowels to he ripp d out of my 'Belly.

For there is not any Nation under Heaven that ride more fwiftly then thefe Tushecks. When this elcape was known at a great number or Horfe-men were lent after the Prince, but all to no purpole, he having sot the ftart fo far before em; the Court was in an amaze, efpecially the King , who never dreamt that Ahouel-Kazt ever dream'd of Tartary, being verily perlwaded that after ten years,that he had liv'd in his Court,he could never have any more remembrance of his own Country. But as the Tartar Prince could not forget his own Country, fo neither did he forget his obligations to Perfia and the Perfian Monarch. For all his life-time he had a particular affection for that Kingdom, more efpecially when he came to fucceed his Father; which was prefently after his Return. And lo long as he Reign'd, he was not only careful to keep a good correfpon- dence with Sejihi the firft, and Huh us the lecond, but he alio kept infuch awe Suh-haan-]^ooli-l^aan,7he worthy,hy which they mean God-, and Jhdul-ha^^e-I^aan or the Servant of theMajejiy, underftood King of Bohr a ; the only two Princes which fometimes infefted the Confines of Per fia, that they were not able to undertake any confiderable Enter- prife. For when either the one or the other enter'd Perfia, pre- iently he was in the Bowels of their Territories,thereby conftrain- ing em to return with more haft then they went. And thus all the Frontier Provinces, as Bacirtana, Margiana, Drangiana , and the Cafpian Coafts enjoy'd a profound Peace. So that Hahai won by his grateful and conftant affedion, with the fame grati tude repaid the Prince s perfeverance, allowing him all along, as a mark of his eftcem, the large Penfion which he enjoy d in Per fia. But after that, upon the death of the Crown def- cended to his Son Enoueh K^aan, or Hahas the Second, who had not that efteem for him which he had for his Father, thought himfelf no longer obligd to continue the Pen fion, which he had given his Father meerly in kindnels. Where upon Enoueh-Kjian, who look'd upon that Penfion as a fort of TributeS o l y ,m a n III. l\ing Perixa. i Tribute which d^PeHkn Monarch paid the King of Canckme or 0 W to keep him from Plundnnghis Territories, findL himfelf fruftrated of his expedation, thought the fureft way to recover it, or adeaft to recompence himfelf for his loffes,would be to carry the War into the Empire, and to Ravage the Frontier Provinces. To which purpofe he enters into a League with the two other ^ againftPerfia, and the better to cement it, he efpoufes the Sifter of the Sovereign Prince of &lt;Ba\h, and gives his own Sifter in Marriage to the King of which done the three brothers-in-law refolve to fall altogether into the Perfian Dominions. There was only onefcruple that troubl'd the Prince of and Bokora, which was, that the deceas'd King of Orquente, the Father of the prelent King, was a Shia Mahumetan^ according to thePeilian Worfhip, and not a Mahumetan according to the Worfhip both of the Turks and Tartars. Enouch there fore makes open Profeffion of the Religion of his Country, and of having quitted his Fathers belief. But the two Princes miftruft- ing his lincerity, and fearing he would play 'em fomefcurvy trick or other, the better to allure themlelves that he was a true ( Sunnie,that he was real in his proceedings, and that he was from the bottom of his heart a declar'd Enemy of Perfia, they were defirous that he fhould firft begin the War,and fall in with all his Forces into the Kingdom, and the next year they agreed they would all three joyn together to advance their Conquefts. According to this Relolution the Prince of enters the Kingdom, but met with too powerful a refiftance. For Habai II. being inform'd of the Conlpiracies of thefe pettie Kings, had Vow d their Ruine, and not only to 'pel their Incurfions, but to make an ablolute Conqueft of their Territories, to deprive them of Life and Scepters both together, and unite the Province of Balk to the Empire. For.this reafon it was that in the year X66 1 ).according to our account he undertook his Progrels into Maunderan^ndmarch'd againft em. The perceiving the King of 'Perfia at hand,and apprehenfive of his Power,lail'd in the greatCourage which they pretended at the beginning,and thought it their better courfe to fubmit. So that the next year, 1666. they lent every one their Embalfadors to beg a Peace, and by that means in fome meafure alfwag'd the Indignation of that Prince, and lulpended thole deligns which he had contrivd in his thoughts, and which by his death not long after happening, proved altogether abortive. Aftero 'The Coronation ^ThisunfortunatTdeath, the took heart again. Be- fides the weak Government of a young Prince whole age and want of experience .renderd him uncapable to oppofe their de-- figns, was fuch a favourable Opportunity that they could not forbear to take the advantage of it. And therefore the Punce of Oraumge, like a hungry Lion, m the y ear ,66 7- Coter d MerveSata, and the Country round about j where finding no refiftance ; he made ftrange Havock, and carry'd away what ever he found to be of value, not one Governour daring to oppole hira. Nor indeed could the Governours prevent it, forthefe Tartars are like Birds of Prey, flying from the Place they have plunder'd with that fwiftnefs, before a man can fufpect 'em to have been there; befides that they had not a fufficient force to oppofe a furious Multitude, whom Revenge and hope of Booty had flefli'd and animated beyond the lenle ot fear or danger. 1 The Court having intelligence of thefe diforders took a re- folution to apply Remedies; but it was fo remifsly and uowly executed, that they who had an infight into things foreuw it would come to nothing, as indeed it came to pals. The Council of Terfta, under the Kings name, made choice of two Lords, efteernd to be Perfonagesof the greateft Expe rience in the Kingdom, the one called and the other Sheik-Halt-Xaan, both the one and the other already provided of two of the beft Governments in the Empire; the hrft of the Province of J\trmaan, or the other of tQrmoon Sha, which is Caldea. Thele Lords were lent for from their Government, which were difpos d of, the one to the Bro ther, the other to the Son of thoie Lords; and they themielves were lent againft the Jusbeck, with the Title of Generals of the Army. They march'd with four thouland men from to joyn the Army that lay ready in the Province of ; and in regard there was no more talk of the War, the Governour of Candaar, had order to fupply the Generals with what Recruits they fhould think necdlary. Six weeks after the departure of thele Lords, with their fmall Body of four thoufand men; feveral Sums of Money were lent to to pay both the Armies, as well that belonging to the Province as the Indian Recruits. This Treafure was convoy'd only by two hundred Men, in regard there was no appearance of any dan ger upon the Road; and yet, however it came to pal's, the lusbech had intelligence of it. Thereupon they lent out a Party to obferve the motion of the Convoy, and took their opportu-S o l y m a n III. Knig Perfia. opportunity To well, that with three thoufandof their own Peo ple they carri'd ofFche Booty, notwithftanding all the Ipeed that was made to overtake 'em. During theie Troubles Hali-IQ)u departed this Life of a ftoppage in his Bread, for which no remedy could be found, after he had kept his Bed four days. In the Story of Terjta, which we intend one day for thePrefs, we have given an account of his Birth, and his Misfortunes; for it was a won derful thing, that whatever faults he were guilty of, and he committed a great many, Hab II. ftill pardon'd him: he never would reduce him to utmoft mifery, much lels put him to death ; becaufe of the good tydings of which he had been the Meflenger to him. For this fame Lord it was, whom Se- fhi I. the Father of Hahai, perceiving his Diftemper grow up on him, lent to fetch the young Prince out of the Womens Palace, to the end he might have him ready near his perfbn, out of a defign which he had to prefent him to the Lords for his Suc- ceffour. Never had any man run through fo many ftrange adventures in fifty years that he belong'd to the Court, and feventy of his Life; nor did ever any man experience the fickle- nefs of Fantaflick Fortune in her Iports of Profperity and Ad- verfity (b much as he did. At the time of his Decea.ie he was advane'd to the higheft Pinacle that ever his good fortune could raile him. He was in the entire polfeflion of the affedlion and favours of his Matter, who refus'dhim nothing. His Majefty was never weary of his Bounty toward him ,â€¢ and fix weeks before his death had pre- fented him with a Sword, a Dagger, and three Heron Tufts, valu'd in all at fifty thouland Cro\Tns. But thefe outward Marks of Favour were of little value to the high-priz'd Power which he had over the thoughts and addons of the Prince, who dilpatch'd no bufineis of Importance before he had taken his Advice. So that it might be faid, that the General was the true Monarch of the 'Perjlans, while he that carri'd the Title was but the fhadow of the Sovereign. And therefore it was that he liv'd like a Monarch j there being nothing that appear'd about him, chat betray d the leaft dilcovery of a private For tune ; for he entertain'd fifteen hundred men about his Perlbn, befides Officers and Eunuchs, of which three hundred at a time mounted his Guards. He got by his Government of Tau- m, and his Fees, as Generalijfimo, thirty thouland or one hundred and twenty thouland pounds of which he laid afide the one half for the payment of his fifteen hundred men, Qcjqqq whomThe Coronation ^k^n^lwafs twltca^ do have in good Equipage ; the reft wenc to defray cbe charges of his Houfe-keeping. He had alio fee up for his own ufe in his Palace feveral K&amp;tr4\*ane or Work- houfes for ail fojts of Manufaaures, where he had mufter'd to gether Workmen and Artificers in all manner of Traded Goldfmiths, T&amp;ilors, Sadlers, Armourers, Burnifhers, ^ be- fides Riders for his Hoiies, and Matters to teach his men how to handle th-eir Arms. In a word, his Palace was altogether Royal. And in this manner was he at continual Expences; infbmuch, that notwkhftandmg his large Revenue he always poor and in debt. For befides th^t he was of a prodigal humour, having neither Wives nor Children to provide for, hs never fpar'd for Luftre and Pomp upon all occafions that re* quird it. Nor will it be amifs, confidering the high degrtt that he held in f erfta, and the Fantaftick Traverfes as WsU.in his Fortune, as in the Confequences of his Conduit, to give the Reader a Portraiture of his Perfon. He was of a middle ftature, rather enclining to be tall then low: his Afpefl: grim and terrible, yet without any deformity. He wore his Motfjitchips very thick, and about three quarters of a foot long : and tho threefcore and ten years of Age he never us d Spe6tacles,and all his other Senfes equally as vigorous as his fight. He perfomvd his Exercifes as duly as the young men: nor was he inferiour to any other perfon whatlbever in handling his BoW, his Sword, and other Weapons; which made him always to be look'd upon as a brave Souldier '.but the more Intelligent lort ne ver believ'd him a good Captain j looking upon him to be fitter for Counfel then Execution. He was endu d with a mixture of Qyalkies that rarely meet together: on the one fide haughty and Cholerick; on the other, fubtleand a deep diflembler ; he knew the proper leafon to fhew the violence of his Revenge, and how to take his Mealiures to the mine of hi* Cpmpetitors. He could not endure to be contradicted: and it was the misfortune and the greateft trouble in the World to his Servants, that when he ask'd for any thing, it was a crime to tell him it was not to be had: for without reply they muft cither put a force upon the very Seaibns of the Year and Fortune her idf to latisfie hira r or file expect to have their bones broken with Baftinadoes. Setting that humour afide, he was affable enough, elpccially to ftrapgers: to them he was eafie of accels, and readily granted 'cm the favours which they requefted. He could neither write Qpr read in any other Language fhea his own Natural He was a lov&lt;?r of Sciences, tho he underftood 'emnot. He wasS o l y m a n III. Per/k was very much addided to Predidions and Forane^tellina^Ancl' ouc ol: an exciaordinary wane of judgment gave more credit to a Prognolticanon then to found Reafon. The fame day hedi'd he was laid in a Mofque clofe by his Palace; from whence fome few days after, he was carr/d to Uetfhed, there to be interr'd under the proteftion of that great Mahometan Saint, who formerly had liy'd there, and made choice of that place for his Sepulchre. It is a thing which we may well wonder at, were it not a thing frequent among us, in re gard theie ludden alterations are to be feen as well in our own as in the Eaftern Courts. For as loon as his dead body was carri'd out of his Palace, about iix hours after he had giv'n up the Ghoft ;that very Houfe which the day before could hard ly contain the Croud that reforted to it, was lb wholly deferred that there was hardly one of all that numerous Family thaten- viron'd him while alive, left to tell a man what was become of their Mafter. His death caus'd a great alteration at Court, tho no body- was troubl d at it but the King, who had a particular kindnefs for him. But there were an infinite number that rejoye'd at it; eipecially they who having fome fliare in the favour of which he depriv d em the full Pofleffion, now hop d to make more room for themfelves. So that the Grandees at Court began to take new Mealures, and in the midft of thole delufions with which their Ambition flatter'd 'em, every one fanci'd to himfelf more daring hopes. The Death of this Perlbn, which did not a little afflidl the King, was accompanied with other Tidings no lefs unwel come; That the f\almachs, a fierce and untameable People, had declar'd open War againft Whereupon the Go- vernours of EJter-abaat, which is the Eaftern beloughc his Majefty to fend 'em requifite Affiftance. And here it is ne- ceflary that we fhould fay fomething concerning the People, and the occafion of the War. The i\almacs derive their Name from K^ahmck, the principal City of the Country which they inhabit, upon the Confines of the greater Tartary toward the Cafpian Sea upon the Eaft fide. Sometimes they are called Yusbeck-lyahnaki, but for the moft part no otherwile then barely Now fome years ago it hapnd that a great number of mans, or Shefherds that wander together by thoufands up and down the fields, and live in Tents, like Swallows, changing their Habitations according to the Seafons, got together upon Qjqqqq 2 their1 Jbr /L TheirFrontiers, between Orquenge and Efiher-ahaat: and thefe People our Modern Autohrscall which are properly Turks For thefe People, and thofe that hold the Empire of Conftantmople cameatfirft from Tu that is to fay, from thofe Provinces of Tartary, whichare very vaft, altho we have but little knowledge of em. And this is alfo that Country which ought properly to &amp; be call'dTÂ«rfe, and not the Provinces of ^ llaznd Europe, polfelsd by the 0Â«. For the Eaftern Peo ple never call by that name the Inhabitants of thofe Provinces, nor the Monarch that Commands 'em, And there fore it is an error of our Europeans; in regard the People of Turkic acknowledge no fuch appellation, deeming it Barbarous. For that among them Turk fignifies one that comes from thofe High-lands of Tartary, let it be from what part it will The (Per/tans therefore to define thofe Turkmans more diftinftly, ca 'em Sara-Netflm. Sara lignifying aPUinor Down, and thofcihat abide there, from the Verb Nti/lmm, to reft otHefo/e. So that Sara-Netfhin fignifies thofe try. Now ancient Hiftorians,and writers of Travels,who under- flood not the Eaftern Languages or at leaft had but a fmattenng underftanding of'em, call thefe People Saracens, which word was never pronounc d at firft by a French-man, who would furely have pronoune'd it Sarajhins. In regard French-men pronounce with left trouble the Shin of the Afiatics then fome of their Neigh- bours, efpecially the Englifh; who every where write it But to make a true relation of a Country, it is necellary that they who defcribe it fhould know the Language ^ elfe they muft commit a thoufand errors not paffable among perfons of Judgment, of which there needs no other proof, then luch Rela tions of Travels which we have feen printed in this Age: Not to mention any other then thofe of Terfiaj of which there are two which are indifferently tolerable ; Palle s and the Travels of Oleums: though the firft be full of faults, which may be faid to be Monftrous; and the latter be not altogether exempt. And yet they are better then the reft, in regard thole Authors under- ftood the Terftan Language; and therefore it is my Opinion, that whoever publishes his Travels, and Obiervations of a Country, of which he has not learnt the Speech, fhall never make any per- fed and accomplifli'd. And this digreffion 1 did not think would be difpleafing to the Curious. But to return to our ftory, this Colony of Turcmans was for merly Tributary to the Calmachs ; but about thirty years ago they took SanÂ£luary in (perfia, fubmitting under the Government orS o l y m a n III. Kjng Perlia. of thofe Princes who commanded the ^rEmpire, to avoid the oppreffion of the Calmachs and to find out a lefs Barren Re gion, and more proper to feed their Flocks. During all which Interval of time the Cahnach had taken no notice of the Turc mans, but in the year 1667. judging Verfia to be in a weak con dition, under a young Prince, to the end they might have a pre tence ror a War, they fent to demand Reftitution of the Tri bute which the Verfian xMonarch had receiv'd for thirty years to- gether of the Turkman, whom they alledg'd to be their Subjefts So foon as their Commiffioners were arriv d at is the firlt conuderable City of Terfta on that fide, the Go vernor detain'd em, and aflur d em he would both fend to in form the Court of Terjia concerning the occafion of their com ing, and give em an account of the anfwer back. Immediately the Kings Council were all Â©f opinion to rejed, with fcorn a de mand fo afFrontive to the Grandeur ol the Empire. Which Refolu- tion was without doubt the moft honourable and made moft noife, but not the wilcft. For the no lefs highly offended when they underftood the anfwer return d, came towards the end of the Campagne to the Frontiers that feparate the two Domini ons, and there in a moft folemn manner fhot an Arrow into the Territories of die Terfiam, which is the Signal they ufe in decla- ring open War againft any of their Neighbours. To whichWar, what iflue Heaven ordain d we fhall below make known. All thole W ars that threaten d in this fame languifhing and feeble condition wherein it was, were the reafbn that the Court would not liften to the Propofitions of the Bafha of ra, vulgarly tho erroneoufly call'd &lt;Bal^ura, a City feated at the mouth of the Verftan Gulph; wherein for feveral years toae- ther the faid Bajha had afTum'd to himfelf a kind of Sovereign Dignity: while he, acknowledging no Supreme, fb well ma- nag'd his affairs in themidft of thofe two Monarchs, between whom he lay, the Turk and Perfian; that thedefire which both had to ruin him, made for his prefervation. For when the Turk had a defign to fall upon him he offer'd himlelf to the Perfian; at what time the Turk being unwilling that the Perfian his Enemy fliould become Mafter of fuch a Territory, and rather choofing that they fhould remain under Subjeftion to a Neuter Prince, forbore to moleft him; and when the Perfian fummon'd him to give an account for breach of his promifesj with the fame policy he threaten'd to furrender to the Turk. And then the Perfian fearing.lefl: the Turk, already two potent, fliould enlarge his Em pire by the additionofthefeTerritories, were unwilling to give himThe Coronation i^TTdiifturbatice fo highly' provoking: and feveral of thefe tricks did the 'Baflu play during the Reign of Hahas II. After his deceafe, the Turks defirous to take the opportunity of Sephie II. being come young and newly to the Crown,to make an attempt upon Baf-ra in the lame manner as thirty years be fore. Sultan Mourad whom we call Murat, took hold of the oc casion, Sephy I. being newly advanc'd to the Throne, to Be- fiege 'Babylon ; fo that altho he were then bulled in the War of Candta, he undertook that Conqueft alfo, and to that effe6t gave orders'to the Baflia s of Diarhehe, and other Governors on that fide, to march againft JjiJ-yit, every one with an embody d Army, of which he appointed the Baflia of Bagdat or Babylon to be General. Hojfein-Bajha (for fo was the petty Sovereign of Baf-ra call'd) fends away into Perfia to make the fame Offer which he had al ready made lb many times before to II. But he was not in being; and his Succelfor minded only his pleafures,and had no in clination for War. However, the chief Minifters, unwilling to difcover the weaknefs of their prefent condition, anfwer'd the Ambaffadors that they had no encouragement to hearken to their Propofitions, after the Bajha their Mailer had fo frequent ly and fo infolently baffled the Te Monarchy. That he had drawn his own misfortunes himfelf upon his own head, and that his fufferings were no more then what he well deferv'd. However, the Bafha nothing difcourag'd for having mifs'd the Succours which he expected on that fide, betook himfelf to an other Stratagem , and being a perlbn that had heap d a vail Trealure together by his Merchandize, he now employs it to corrupt the Bafha of Bagdat General of the Turkifh Army and the reft of the Grand Officers. Thereupon he treats with 'em, upon condition of being Tributary, for the future, to the Grand Seignior, to pay him every year a hundred thoufand Crowns, and to give him in ready Money two hundred thoufand upon the naile: fbme other conditions were likewile added of fmall im- portance,and fo the Siege being rais'd,and the fent his Son- in-law to Conjlantimple to have the Treaty ratifi'd, which was all that happen'd in reference to this War in the year 1667. Toward the end of the fame yeararriv'd fad tidings at l/pa- ban from the Provinces adjoyning to the Cafplan Sea, that at Shirvan, the Capital City of a Province of the fame Name, and which makes a part of Armenia the greater, were the Ca pital City of Georgia, an Earthquake had overturn'd the greateft part of that City, and ruin'd four Villages near adjoyning : andS o l y m a n 'HI.

'However, he look'd upon the fad fcveftt with a joy- ifol heart, as being that which offerd'him more an opportunity to get rid of Im troubles and perfecutions which he fuftain'd in the Court of (Pe^and to gecout of which he lookt upon as a kind of confinement, or to Ipeak more truly as his place of Tor ment; nor did he neglect the opportunity,but prefented forthwith a Petition to the King and the Chief Minifters, wherein^ de- clar'd that Slmnaky xvas dependent upon his imployment, and therefore befought his Majefty that hfe might return thither to lee what might be done to recover it toot of 'its -Ruins. He back'd his Petition with feveral confiderable Prefents which be made to the chief Miniflers, and ^by tkt jrieatns obtain'd a Grant of his defires. Acad thus did :Â«hat an^rtunate iLord de- for a time the bad efTe&amp;s of)his aaforcuhate Arribition.

Infamy attended him every where j and not only the Grandees but perfons of orditoaty condition took delight *0 make Ipospt with him, as if 'Me hiaid been ont of lihe dregs of the People. Few being a man that Was very Co vetous, and yet one that his misfortunes -had rendred eXtfemely fearful, they who had any chiag to receive of him, and to#h6m heiad made over Affignations upon his Farm,could find no bet ter Way to make him bleed then to abufe and affront him. And I was inform'd by fome perfons who Were able to tell me, that upon fome difbrder at Court how to taife money,the or Chief Jufike gave the King to underftand in a Memorial which heprclented him,that if his Majefty would but deliver up into power Ibrahim, and Mtr^a his Brother, he Would lole his head if he did not raile him a Snm of fix hundred thoufandThe Coronation of choufand Tomans , which are two Millions aqd a hajf Sterlin. It happend that at the fame time when this Memorial was deli- ver'd this unfortunate Lord was in the Hall, where his Majefty late, who thereupon caus d the Memorial to be read aloud. It maybe eafily judg'd in what a taking he was; but without anlwering a word, he patiently endur'd the punifliment of his rafii Ambition, and want of Condudt. In a word, he was a loft man,and his mifery had encreas'd to its full height,had not the conjun &amp;ure of the Earthquake furnifli'd him with an opportu nity to beg leave to retire. So that in fome meafure his good fortune proceeded from an event which at another time might have prov'd moft prejudicial to him. Yet as I have already laid moft prudent perlbns believe, that he has only delay'd his evil Defti -ny for fome years, that his ruin is infallible, and that up on the leaft want of money, he will ftill be the Prey in the eyes of the Hungry Courtiers. The year 1668. according to our account, and 1079. accor ding to the Mahumetan Computation, began with great Rejoy cing,thePrince imagining that the reft of the year would be no lels happy then the beginning. But it fell not out anfwerable to his ex- pedationsmor that of theGrandees of the Kingdom,as well as thofe of meaner Condition,who had any infight into Affairs:tho to out ward appearance they attended at the f eftivals with a chearful countenance,yet their hearts were not fo light: for they found the condition of the Empire grew every day worfe and worfe; that the Enemy was in the Bowels of feveral Provinces, while others were laid defolate by Earthquakes: little Money in the Kingdom, a fcarcity ftill continu'd at IJpahan, where tho there was no want; of any thing, yet every thing was fold at an exceflive rate. The Exchequer moreover was exhaufted, while the new Prince in eighteen Months had drain'd all the Trealures of the Empire. Which happen'd through his Profufionontheonefide, either by reafon of the prodigious Expences that he delighted in, or through the exceflive Prefents which frequently, and many times with out any Realbn at all, he heap'd upon his Favourites. And 011 the other fide, through the little care that was taken of the ma nagement of his Revenues: For indeed he had not made the third part of what his Father was wont to make of em; as having without confidering the confequences', fill'd up all the vacant Employments both in the Court and in the Countrys. Where as his Father never fupplyd thole Vacancies unlels he was thereto compell'd by neceffity, to the end he might have the Money himlelf w ch was due to his Qfficers.But the young Monarch little experiene'dS o l y m a n III. Kj Perlii. i zp experieric'd in Government, imagin'd that the. Coffers which he found full would never be empty. Nor durft any body be fo bold as to tell him 'twas much more eafie to empty then to fill 'em. But at length when they found him wondring that Money was not plentiful with him as it had been, they were conftrain'd to let him underftand the reafon. The Dutchels his Mother, for whom he had an extraordi nary refpe&lt;5t, and who might be faid to be more then his Go* verhefs, fpoke with more freedom to him then any other perfon, and made him condefcend to let her a&lt;5t in the publick manage ment of Affairs. Thereupon fhe took upon her the Govern ment of the Empire, and to fhew her firft Mafter-piece of Po- v licy, flie reduc'd the Monarch her Son from one extremity another. Infomuch that whereas he was fo extremely liberal before, that he was always and upon all occafions giving,! afterwards he became covetous even to pitiful fordidnefs: and was fo tar from being bountiful that he hardly rewarded thofe that did him extraordinary fervices. So that it might be (aid of him, that he was like fome Torrents that over flow the Meadows to day, and the next leave 'em quite dry. All thele diforders oblig'd the Terjta to look backward, and to wifh for the days of the deceafed Kings Reign. And they were taken with the Anfwer which the late General of the Armies, when he liv'd in iuch iplendour and high favour ac Court, made the King ; For one day the Prince and he being private togethet,Hali-^ouli -l {aan laid the King to him, Dojl thou not know who they were that rejoycd at Father ? if I knew who the Dogs were, he rij)pd up. To whom the Lord with his ufual boldnels laid ; Your Majejiy will do well to take care wh left your jelf and me : For I know none but could be acceptable; by which, of'Tr'tjoners Kyngs of Perlla. Nor had the King his Health this year any better then the year before. His Diilemper ftill perplex'd him, tho his fits were always alike, lome quickly off, others more tedious. Sometimes he lay whole Weeks together languifhing in his whence he never ftirr'd out at his ulual times, but a little now and then in the Evening to fhew himfelf: Sometimes he took the Air a Horfeback with a Handkerchief ty'd three or four times about his neck, which in Terjia is the certain fign of a fick Perfbn. However all this while he forbore nothing of his debaucheries, Rrrrr andThe Coronation Tndlilwayrcarri'd bis Women along with him; his moft ufual Walks being upon G'mlfa fide, a Town belonging to the nians, out of which he pick'd all the handfom Virgins to fill his Palace. It is faid, the firft time that he caus'd the young Virgins under twelve and above ten years of Age to be thus cull d out', of twenty that were carri'd to the Palace there was but one'that flrew'd theleaft joy in her Countenance for her good fortune, and fhe was detain'd; the reft who fell a weeping, either becaufe they were thought too Innocent, or elfe believ d to be too cunning, were reftor'd to their Parents.' But to the Father of her that was detain'd the Sum of Eight or thirtyGuinees Penfionwas prefently orderd. For it is theCu- ftom of that Court, when the King makes choice of any Vir gin out of a Family that is not very well in the World, he affigns the Father a Penfion to that value, or near it, during his Lite. I fay, when a Family is low in the World: For as for the Grandees, they count it a great happinefs to have a Kinf- woman in the Kings houfe, where (he may be ufeful to him in his advancement, and do him a thoufand good Offices near his Majefties Perfon. Neverthelefs the Young Prince had forborn Wine all the lall year, by reafon of an Inflammation in his Throat occafion'd by his hard drinking; with which his Father alfo had formerly been troubl'd for the fame caufe. Which was the Reafon that thtl\ourouk or Prohibition of Wine was renew'd, to the end there might be no more fold. For it is the Cuftom of the Grandees in Jfia-, when they have an Intention to abandon Wine, they fend Orders to throw away all that they have, and fo knock out the heads of the VelTels, to the end that if they fliouldhaveadefireto drink it again, they might not have an opportunity to fatisfie themfelves 5 not looking upon themfelves to be Mailers of their Palfions. But notwithftanding all this Abftinence of the Young Princ6, his Diftempers nothing abated. His pale and wan Colour, and his Stomach loathing all manner of Food, were certain Sym- ptomes of his diforder'd Body. His Chief Phyfician knew not what to think : he had eflfay'd in vain all the fecrets of his Art; which was no finall affli&lt;5tiori to him, in regard his life depended upon the Kings: Or if his life were Ipar'd, yet he was lure to lofe his Eftate and his Liberty: as happtn'd to the two Chief Phyficians of HahdsU. and as ic happens to all thofe that attend the Sovereigns, when theydie under their care. TheS o l y m a n III. Perfia. ] The Aftrologers alio began to whifper one another in the Ear, and tell their Confidents, as a great fecret, that the King would never recover,- that they could not find in his Horo- fcope that he had above fix years to live after his Coronation, of which he had already furviv'd a third part; and that he fhould languifh out the two others in perpetual mifery. The Queen Mother,prefs'd by her natural affeftion^nd blinded by the tranlports of her Paffion, forbore to lay the fault upon her Sons diftemper; but quarrell'd with the Phyfician, askina him how it came to pafs her Son was fick, accus'd him of Trea^ fon or Ignorance, believing that fince he was her Sons Phyfician, he was oblig d to cure him. This made the Phyfician at his Wits end,lb that all his Receipts failing him, he bethought him- lelf of one that was peculiarly his own Invention, and which few Phyficians would ever have found out, as not being to be met with neither in Galen nor What does he then do, but out of an extraordinary fetch of his Wit, he begins to lay the fault upon the Stars, and the Mun/hi-Zumes, or Kings Aftrologers, crying out that they were altogether in the. wrong. That if the King lay in a languifliing condition, and/ could not recover his health, it was becaufe they had fait'd to obferve the happy hour, or the AlpecSt of a Fortunate Conftel- lation at the Time of his Coronation. Which Fable was back'd by all the friends which the Phyfician had at Court; and befides that, by one of the Kings Aftrologers himfelf, call'd Mr^a Mmgiim. For this perfon either out of Emulation, or for what other reafon I know not, bearing a private grudge to the Prince of the Aftrologers, whofe bufinefs it was to obferve the favourable Conjundion for the Coronation of the young Prince, and perceiving fo fit an opportunity to difcredit the Chief of the Aftrologers, and advance his own Reputation, fail'd not to lay hold of it. He therefore made it out, or at leaft feem'd to make it plain by long difputes full of Aftrological Reafons, in all the chief Affemblies of the chief Courtiers, that the Moment defign'd for the Coronation of the King fignifi d nothing j and after wards by Arguments as ftrong as the firft, he labour'd to prove that the defect of the Kings health proceeded from his Coronation which had been folemniz'd under an Inaufpicious Afpeit. The firft that gave credit to his idle ftories were the Mother and the Son 5 and the Women that were fuffer'd to be near his Majefty were of the fame opinion likewife, that it was the fault Rrrrr 2 ofThe Coronation oTST Star-Gazer, who had not taken notice that the Afpeft was not favourable at that time. The Eunuchs were drawn into the fame belief, and the Courtiers who are ftill ready to comply with the moft extravagant Propofals, to pleafe their Mafter, declar d no lefs. In Oiort the Phyfician got the day, and by this Chimera fav'd his Credit and his Eftate. â– Twas in vain for the Aftrologer, by the moft convincing Arguments he could alledge, to maintain the contrary. No body gave ear to him; fo that he was conftrain'd, for fear of running himfelf into farther danger, not only to hold peace, but at length to applaud the Sentence pronounc d agamft him * Therefore there was nothing now to be done but to repair a pretended defed, and to feek out proper remedies for the miftake: nor could they find any other Expedient but tb proceed toa fe- cond Coronation of the King, as if he had never been Crown'd before. It was refolv'd alfo at the fame time, that his Majefty fliould quit the name of Sephie, as carrying in it fomewhat I know not what of unfortunate; and that he fhould make choice of another. They gave his Majefty therefore to underftand,that the beginning of his Grandfathers Reign had been accom- pani'd with the fame accidents as his own. That there was a great fcarcity of Provifion in ; that the Turks had declar'd War againft him, and that he had never enjoy d a perfed health. . Thefe two things being thus refolv'd, the next thing was to pitch upon the day. Upon this Point there was a long de liberation, and many Contefts about it. The Aftrologers were confulted: and at length after many Confultations and ferious Enquiries, they agreed that the happy Hour which was to be attended by fo many fortunate Events, would be toward the time of the year that the Sun enter'd the (^am which accord ing to our account was Tuefday the twentieth ol nine in the Morning. At for this fecond Coronation, in regard it vari d little or no thing from the former, it will be needlefs to make a fecond defcription of it: All the difference was, that this fecond Coro nation was folemniz'd in the great Hall, calld or the Hall with forty Wan. Which is that Magnificent Apart ment, the moft ftately in all the Royal Palace, by us defcribd with all poffible exactnds in our defcription of There the whole Court met at the time prefix'd by the Aftrologers with all the Pomp that fuch a glorious Ceremony requir'd.

And by and by the Loud Mufick from the Royal Palace proclaim d to the whole City the News of the Ceremo ny. All the reft of the day was fpent in Paftimes and publick Shews ; and at night Lights were kept burning till Morning, and the Shops order d to be kept open, for the People to walk the Streets as at Noon day. At the fame time all thecals and all the Money Stamps were broken and others made with the new name ofSolemaJ, ; and in the fpace of twenty four Hours fome thoufands of new Crowns were difpers'd abroad. Moreover, to inform all the Provinces of this new Coronation, a Commiffion was given to Mahamed-Sakk tne Kings Aftrologer, Brother to the Chief Aftrologer, and Head of the Society, to write to all the Officers of Terfia, and all that had any Employment or Command irt tha. 531 34- The Coronatio account of the reafon why his rie S wJ this Ommiffion: For .he G^dees and Officers, and in a word, all thofe to whom he directed his Lee ters were oblig'd to fend him lome confiderable Prelent, every one according to his Quality, for the Moujhtelog, or good News which they had receiv'd. ^ _ Royal Habits alio were fent prefently after the Coronation to the Governours, Lieutenants, and Collectors of the Publick Receipts/and all other Perfons of Quality in all the ieveral Provinces. With Patents and Commands in the Name ot Solemaan,zs if a New King had afcended the Throne; |o ftrange- ly had afoolifli and fuperftitious Fancy poflefsd the mind ot this Monarch and his Counfellours. Not but that 'tis very pro bable they aded meerly out of Complaifance. For they were too wile in my opinion, ferioully to appear in an Action lo fan- taftick and extravagant, and which a man fhall hardly meet with the like in any other Hiftory. \ However his Majefty, fo foon as the Ceremony was over, fancy'd the recovery of his Health; and whether it were that Opinion contributed to his Imagination, certain it was that the Phyfick which his Majefty took had iome good Effect, and the King grew better ; but the Kingdom had no advantage by it. On the contrary, the news of Wars arriv'd at Ijpahan from all Parts, augmenting the Terrour, with which that dreadful Comet, that year appearing, had polTefs'd their Minds. i n. That great and remarkable Comet, which was ieen almoit over all the earth, appear'd alio at that time in The Aftrologers call'd it Nia^puk, or as relembling that Figure. For the Tcrjuuis do not give to Comets, as we do, the name which is common to thofe Meteors, but according to the Figure which they reprefent, as we have obferv'd in its pro per place. They affirm'd they never faw, not ever had heard Ipeak of anyone that ever was like it. The Head of it was hid in the Weft, in fucha manner, that nothing of it could be perceiv'd in that Horizon. In our Treatife of the Aftrology,S o l y m a n III. K^ng Perfia. Aftrology, we have given the defcription of to the oblervation made in the Capital City of the Province of Verjia the feventh of March, which was the fecond day of its appearance. But we have not any where mention'd the Ob- fervation that was made of it at for which reafon I thought it would be fomething to the purpofe to fpeak of ic in this place. The Obfervationthen that was made of it in the Capital City of the Kingdom by die Munjhi^iims or Kings Aftrologers the tenth of May, at feven of the Clock in the Evening was' this. It appear d in the Southern part, and followed the motion of the Vrmum Mobile, it extended in length ^ o deg. 3 t.mm. and almoft of an equal breadth of 6 The colour of it was inclining fomewhat to yellow. The upper part of it advanc'd toward the Girdle of Orion, and the River in length from the d^am 72 deg. And its lower Extremity under the Whale, or the winding of Eridanm, where it extended in length 41 deg. 3 o min. and in breadth &lt;5 deg. All the Terftan Aftrologers declard in their Takuims or Alma nacks, which are properly the E of the prelent Year, Ipeaking of this Meteor, that it fignifi'd nothing but Wars' Murders, Seditions, Conflagrations, dangerous Dileafes, over turning of Kingdoms and States, and, in a word, all manner of Calamities. But they fix'd all thele dreadful Effedls far off from Ferjia, upon the Sunnis or Tnrh, and IQifers, which is a name that they give to Idolaters, among whom, according to their belief, they efteem us Chriftians to be the chief. But Time, who is the Matter Aftrologer, has made it appear to the tperjians that thefe feourges were as well prepar'd for them- felves: For what has happen'd this year in that Kingdom has given 'em to underlland that they are the Perfons that muft be imitten with this Cudgel : and that the Little for both thele names they gave that Comet) will as feverely gore their fides, and that a good fhare of fb many lad Influences will fall upon the Dominions of the 'Perjian Empire, as well as in other places. The Governour of J^andaar was one of the firft who felt the fatal Influences of this Comet by his fall and death, which happen'd at the fame time upon this occafion. For the better underftanding of which we muft go back to the Story of his Life, where we left off, to bring him in a few words to his End. We left him going to gandaar with his Recruits; where fb fbon as he arriv d, he found no likelihood of any War. Nor indeedc [he Coronatio indeed did he exped any fuch thing : only he himfelfhad caus'd the Rumour to be fpread abroad to obtain the Govern ment- and to difincuraber himfelf from thofe Troubles which his turbulent and wicked Condud: had drawn upon himfelf. But nofooner was hearriv d in that City but he began to appear in his own Colours, not fo much by fecrec contrivance, but openly and with a lofty pride adinga Petty Sovereign, and affuming abfolute Dominion, taking away by force Virgins â–  from their Parents, Married women from their Husbands to replenifh bis Palace; obferving no meafure, but ufing as his Slaves and Footmen the Sultoons, or inferiour Governours, the ffyyal Farmers, and meaner Officers, pillaging and plundering where ever there was any thing to be g6c. In a word, his. Tyranny grew to that extremity, that in all that fpacious Pro vince there was not any body that was not in an extraordinary Confternation: for without any form of Proceeding, he put to death whomever he thought good, according as his fury or his intereft infpir'd him. Of thefe things Complaints were fent to the Court, and the Cries of that infinite number which he had render'd miferable were fo loud, that they reach'd the Kings Ears. Which the Governours Enemies had lb much the fairer opportunity to improve, confidering how the Clamours againft his exorbitances dayly increas d. Thereupon his Kin dred and thole few friends he had left at Court fent him word, that his Affairs were but in a bad condition, his proceedings being highly refented by his Majefty, and that unlefs he look'd carefully to himfelf, fome mifchievous Backftroke of Fortune threaten'd him. But he took little notice of this good advice; believing himfelf fo well affurd of his Princes favour; and therefore thinking himfelf proof againft all the moft Potent Ac- cufations, he never alter'd his Condud, but rather grew more haughty and difbrderly. The I\aari Governor who had been difplac'd to make way for him,was then at Court; however by the means of his friends he fail'd not to have a ftri6t eye upon all his Adions,- nor were they lefs diligent to conveigh the complaints of the afflicted to the Kings Ear. So that at length all his Crimes were heap'd together; but while the King Was wavering, whether to dif- grace him and caft him from his favour or not, he committed a new Aft of Violence, which added a moft terrible weight to the foregoing Acculations. Between the Kingdom of Kjickntir, and the Province or J\an- daar, lie a certain People call'd Bolluki, who extend themlelves intoS o l y m a n III. Perfia. into India on that fide; which Country is Governd by their own Native Princes; only thofe that are next neighbours to fia, acknowledge the King and are his Tributaries. One of thofe Princes had a very lovely Daughter of whom the Governor of Kjmdaar had heard a great Report, and therefore paffionately defired her for one of his Wives. To which purpofe he fends to demand her of the Prince her Father; who refus'd his Motion: The inaraour'd Governor, not fo difcouragd, lent again, and receives a fecond denial, he fends neverthelefs a third time, but to as little purpofe, for that the Bollukt never intermix alliances but one with another. Upon this the Governor dilfem- bling his Indignation, always profefs'd a great friendfhip for him, and invited him one day to a fumptuous Feaft at I\andaar. The Prince miftrufting nothing came to the Entertainment; but when the Governor had him in his Clutches, he caus'd his head to be cutoff. Upon which, the Prince's Attendants when they under- ftood of his Death, dildaining fo foul a piece of Villany, all en- rag'd fell upon the Governors Guard, between whom and the Strangers there happen d a bloody Combat, wherein three hun dred Terfums were flain upon the place, and between leven and eight hundred of the others. This made fuch a noife that the King began to (hew himfelf highly offended. Nor would the Governors Enemies omit lb fair an opportunity; believing now his Ma jelly would fuffer 'em to (ay any thing againft a man that gave him lo much occafion of inward difturbance, lo that they eafily perfwaded him to revoke the permiflion he had given him to come to Court when he pleafed himfelf. The pretence of which Revocation was grounded upon this, that it was a thing which had never been accuftomed to be done, and which might in the end pro duce dangerous Confequences; and they thought they had gone a great way in gaining that point. For they were afraid, left if the Governor had free acceis to Court he fliould regain by his Prefence, the Kings Favour; which ieem'd no difficult thing for him to do, who had the art fo well to counterfeit his paffionate affection for the Kings' Intereft : and for that the King when the Governor was ready to depart for had teftify'd his Sorrow to part with him, at what time he thus exprefs'd himfelf: Tho thou go'ft to Kandaar, thou vourite, and thou JJ?alt return to my convenient. Which was the reafon of his giving him Letters of Licence to.come when he pleas'd to Court without expelling any new Orders. Sffff TheThe Coronation The Governor receive! the revocation of that Favour, Â»aid at the fame time other Letters from his Brother, and the reft of his Friends, advifing him to be careful in his Conduit; that his Fortune totterd, and was within a little of falling altogether; and that his Enemies had made great advantage of the opportu nities he had given 'em. Upon this News he took a courfe which he thought lo much the more worthy of himfelf, by how much it appeafd to him to be equally prudent and daring; tho by the event it prov d no lefs fatal than raft. He affur'd himfelf that fo foon as he fliould but fee the King, he fhould fet all things right again: that he fliould regain his firft Favour, and fcatter the Fadtion of his Enemies. And therefore without ever Petitioning for any new Order or ex- pefting any Command, nay,againft the very Command which he had receiv'd exprefly forbidding his coming to Court, he takes Horfe, and in nine days arrives at Ifpahan. The fpeed that was made in this Journey was difcourfed of at Ifpahan, as of a thing altogether extraordinary and which was never done before. For of thele nine days one muft be de duced that he ftaid to reft himfelf in a Garden about a hundred and fifty Leagues from Ifpahan. So that in fbme eight days he rode as much ground as ufually takes up three Months ordinary Travelling from IQmdaar to Ifpahan, that is to fay, three hun dred and fifty ^Perjtan Leagues, which are more then four hun dred and fifty French Leagues. However he did not enter the City, but went to a Garden near the Tokfln which is one of the Gates of the City, from whence according to Cuftom he fent to give notice to the King, that the Governor of Kandaar his Slave, fhould grant htm the favour to come andktfs By which action he thought to have carry'd the day from his Enemies, and to have regain'd the Kings Aflfedion. The King was then in the Womens Palace,where the Eunuchs were charged to carry him the news. Which Charge the High Chamberlain and the Princeffes High Steward (thofe potent Eunuchs whom he had endeavor'd to fet together by the ears by his cunning contrivances of falle reports) undertook uponthem- felves, and taking their time to enjoy that revenge which they had prepar'd in their hearts,with an aftonifhment in their faces,fo much the greater becaufe affected,they tell the King of the Gover nors arrival, adding withal. That they Aciion of the Governor might he interpreted, per mif- fion, hut contrary to a pojitwe inhibit couldS o l y m a n III. Perfia. could not hut he a heinous contempt of Majejly, hellion; that Jince the firjl foundation Perfian any Governordurft be jo hold as to q own head, and out of his own humour In a word they reprefented this Order fo foul to the King, that he fent to the Governor of J^andaar, to go and furrender himfeif into the Cu- ftody of OgourlonÂ£\an Grand Porter; and to him lie fent orders to put him into the I\rondou/hake, which is a little Woodden Engine that Pillories the neck, and faftens the right Arm of the Priloner to his Girdle, fo that he has no way to help himfeif with that hand, which is the way to fecure the perlbns of Gran dees that are look'd upon as Criminals. Thus he remain'd three days in the Captain of the Royal Gate's Houfe. All which time the poor Governor conjur'd Hea ven and Earth ;befought of God and Man that he might only be permitted to fee the King ,â€¢ affuring himfeif that with one fingle word he fhould be able to ruine thoie that had deterfnin'd his deftruilion. But they who fear'd no lefs, and dreaded that permiffion, labour d their utmefl to prevent it, and fought by all ways to exalperate the Kings anger already kindled againft him. For as the Governor thought it a knack of State to be permitted to fee the King ; lb on the other fide, his Enemies deemd it no lefs a piece of State-policy to prevent that honour from being granted him. In the m'ean time the Chief Porter being gaind by the Gover nors moans and entreaties, the third day of his imprifonment carry'd him with the woodden Pillory to the great Portal of the Palace that looks towards the Royal Piazza , and there leaving him in the hands Â©f his Servants, went to his Majefty and told him, That the Governor of Kandaac, had his moans and intreaties to bring him dyings : and poor Lord was there, waiting for th kfs Majefties feet. But then the Enemies of that unfortunate Lord, who were in no fmall number about the Kihg, renew'd their Accufations, and took the more boldnefs, in regard the King was no way unwilling to hear their complaints. Every one aggrava ted what he knew the Offender to have moil criminally com mitted ; But above all his Predecetfor in the Government of Kandaar,who the day before and that very day had caus'd above three hundred Petitions to be Prefented againft him by fe- veral Perfons of the lame Province,that demanded Juftice. Thus his Enemies became too powerful for him, fo that after an hours deliberation, the King commanded the Sffif 2j The Corona fortcr^o po and rip up his Guts. Prefently the haften'd to obey the JCin^s OruerSj and as fai off as he could lee the Gate he cries Four, that is to fay, which is the Signal of death. Immediately the next Officer that heard the word, gives him a kick with his Foot upon the Stomach, and threw him out of the Portal into the (Royal There with his Sword he fives him two great Gafhes upon one fide of his NecK; but in regard his head did not tumble as yet, another drew his Dagger, and ftabb'd him under the Ribs into the Imall Guts, and Thus he expir'd weltring in his Blood, which ftream'd from him in a prodigious quantity, as being a very Sanguine Peribn. Now in the midft of the Royal Piazza, over againft the great Portal of the Palace is fet up a large May-pole of an extraordi nary height, on the top of which upon folemn Feftivals and days of publick rejoycing is fix d a Cup of Gold, which is a Prize to be won by the firft among the Horfemen that can fhoot it down with his Bow and Arrows upon a full Gallop: and upon the top of this Maypole it was, that the head of this great Per- fonage was let up by the Kings order f the reafon of which was, as the Terjians laid that pafsd along, to the end his malicious Tongue might not be able at lb great a diftance to fow Dilcord and Dilfenfion. This was the end of GemJlnd-lQtan, who indeed did no way merit a better Fate: for there was not any body that piti'd his fall; or rather, there was not any body that did not load him with Curfes: lb that his Body lay two days in the publick be fore his Majefty gave permiffion for its Interment. He was of a goodly ftature and proportion ,â€¢ had a noble af- pe&lt;Sl, and the Port of a Peribn of Qiiality 5 his Countenance very plealing and winning at firft fight; befides that a vaft Courage, and profulc munificence accompany'd thele outward Graces of the Body. But letting afide thefe two Qualities of his Soul that were laudable, the reft were all as venomous and tainted as thele were Eminent. Four days after this Execution, the Commiffion for Governor of l\andaar was lent to Mahammed-jt\ntd that is to lay, the Lord Slave ofMahixmed. This Lord had been thirteen years a Pri- loner, Banifli'd to Casbin by Habits 11. Of which this was the true Caufe. Hahas 11. being one day abroad with his Women, this Lord, before he was aware was got within the limits that are prohibi ted to men; where the Guard of the CoumiK perceiving him fell upon him, and Baftinado'd him moft leverely. Some days af ter.S o l y m a n III. Kjing Perfla. ter, fo loon as he was able to go, he went to the Palace where the King was fitting in the publick Aflembly, where taking the King afide, with a refolv'd Countenance, laid he, with this Heron Tuft upon Honour which the Gr andees pay th jhould take thee for lefs than thel\&gt;ng of Perfia. become thee to run a rambling over men, and at the fame timeeaufe t their hones broken with ignominious Tne King heard this Reprimand without leeming to beany way difturb'd; only in a carelefs manner order'd an addition of Baftinadoes to be given him befides thole of which he already complain d. Upon which, Generous and Couragious as he was, lofing all manner of Patience, he draws his Sword, and throwing himlelf at theKings feet,Lrt m/aidhe, 'Baftinado me again,here is my Sword topunifh my lelf; your Majefty may do with tÂ£ me what you pleafe,and put me to what Torments you think ' fit, but if a Perfon of my Qtiality mull be lubjeÂ£t to Baftina- ' does, what mull a poor I^eft-Baf exped (for fo they call the Souldiers that compole the Â¥erf an Militia. _) The Monarch plea- fed with this generous Repartee, would neither Sentence him-to Death as he delerv'd by the Laws of the Kingdom, nor to the Cudgel; but only Banifli'd him to Casbm. But he was joyfully furpris'd when he receiv'd the Patent for a Government, which not only rellor'd him to his Liberty, but at the fame time conferr'd upon him one of the moll important employments in the Kingdom. I confefs I know not what may be thought of fuch Politicks as thefe, as hunt in Jails for men of Merit, to advance the difoblig'd by long Imprilbnment to the moll confiderable places of Trull in the Kingdom, and to com mit to his care a Province and llrong Hold which on that fide the Country may be laid to be the Key of the Kingdom. Of neceffity the King mull be llrangely aflfur'd of the fidelity of his Subjeds. For there is no quellion to be made, but that if a Governor of IQmdaar will call in the and fell him that Place, but that he may have feveral Millions of Money for his Service, and have what advancement he pleales himfelf in that Empire, as is apparent by one Example in the time of SephiI. During thele Revolutions in the Court of 'Perfia, four Com- miffioners arriv'd from the MufcoCofaques, who but two Months before had made a moll furious Inrode mmTerfia on that fide where Hyrcania lies,upon the Shore of the Cafftan Sea. But be foreof The'Invifion it will be ncceCfary to tell the Rel- r0n in tlie year 1 664. according to out account thete attiv'd at J/- Jana famous Embaffie from Muficvhetem two Embafla- C wete concern'd, with a Train of about erght bnndted Men: and the Prefems which they made the Krng were yalud by ap- praifment at frye thoufand Tmm or fevenrcen rhoufand five hnn- dl The^onfiftd' of two Coaches cnrich'd with ttroft fumptu- OUS Embroideries.

To which purpofe they liv'd meft wretchedly, and in theMagmh- cent Palace which the King had affignd 'em they laid thert rails amoncr the Coftly Moveables wherewith it was furmihd, like fo many Doss. For which reafon the look d upon the Mofcavkes as the moft pakiy narrow-ibul'd, and infamous among all the Chriftians; and inderifion call 'em thereby expreffing the fmall efteem they have of em; for the ieh are the moft abjed People of all the . rr The King therefore difdaining the Infamy of thele amballa- dors, and feeing that indeed they were lent by their Mafterfor no other reafon then to Traffick, to fell their Furs and other Com modities, and to carry away Stuffs, Leather, and other luch like Merchandizes out of ferfta, but efpecially Mony, ^ abus d em at knerth and made little account of 'em. One of em dy d, and the other return d home with his tatter d Train withoiu any o nourfheWn him, or hardly any anfwer given liim. The Grand Duke highly refented this Affront,but Qitlcmbldhis Choler for the prefent, in regard he durft not meddle with ; but underftanding at the beginning of the Year 1605. t at e was dead, and that the Scepter of Verfta was fall n into the Hands of a Young Prince, herelolv d to take his revenge, tho eS 01. y m a n III. K Perlia. 1 ^5 JnWiUing to enter into open and declar'd Hoftility j and theie- fore that he might ftnke and not be feen, he incites and encou rages the Cojfich next adjoyning to the black Sea; orders 'em to march along the Lake M(Â£otts,md fo to fall into upon cania fide, with this Caution that they ftiould take care how they mention'd him, oracknowledgd that they had anyCorrefpon- dence with him, but only that they had undertaken the Enter- prize upon their own Heads; which is no more than what was reported and believ'd at the Court of Terfa. The Cojfach were eafily perfuaded, and therefore embarking to the number of fix thouiand in forty large Barques, luch as ule the Cafpian Sea (which are long and broad Veffels, but ftial- low built to avoid the Rocks that lie two or three foot under water )and in each Barque carrying two Pieces of they cad Anchor firil near Ereck, a fmall City upon the Borders of Gudan or Htrania, where they landed to the number of four thoufand, and finding the Place without Soldiers, and the In habitants no way prepar d for defence, they pillage and plun der it, and after a great flaughter of both Sexes retreat in great haft with all their Booty to their VelTels, that lay out at Sea as far as they could for fear of being dilcover'd. Moreover, for the more crafty management of their Game they fentfour of their chief Heads, in the Nature of Embaffa- dourswith Letters of Credence to the Court,and the Governour of Shamaky order'd his People to convey em to they arriv'd foon after the news of their Irruption. They were civilly entertain'd,a Lodging was affign'd 'em,and theirExpences defray'd as is ufual for other Embaffadours. Soon after they demanded Audience of the King,but that was deni'd em, becaulcthey were not of fufficient Quality to claim that Honour. However it was concluded that the Prime Minifter fhould grant 'em Audience^ which they accepted. There they fet forth, ' That they were ' Commiffioners fent by fix thoufand of the Cojfachs, that lay at Â« Anchor in the Cafpian Sea 5 that in truth they were formerly ' fubjeft to the Empire of the Mufcovites, but that bdng wea- . ' ried by the oppreflion which they endur'd there, they had ' refolvd to fly their Country with their Wives and Children. Â« and whatever elie of their Goods they could carry along With Â« 'em. That after they had debated whither to fly for fafety Â« and protedion, ferjk was the Place that they had pitch'd ' upon, as being a Monarchy that lov'd Juftice^ and was kind ' to her Slaves. For which-reafon they had concluded to offer ' their fervice to his Majefty, and therefore they were departed U ffr^rnThe Coronatio ' from Sha-Seven, for love of the King, and now they hop d ' from the Generofity of lo great a Monarch, that he would ' liften to their Petitions, afford 'em a Sandxury, and affign 'em ' Lands for their Habitation. This laid, they prelented their Letters of Credence^ which thc'PerJtans could never uncypher, tho they made ule of all the moil cunning and learned Interpreters as well of their own Nation, as oÂ£ Europeans, that were found at The Chief Minifter thus difappointed, made his laft trial upon a Capuchin, who for twenty years together had been ftill employ'd by the Minifters of State of that Kingdom. It happen dalfo when the Paper was brought him, tha.t the Sieur Herbert d' J aver was with him; a Chief of the Dutch Factory at Ifpahan. He was a perfon that for the underflanding of Lan - guages had few that might compare with him ; for beiides that he perfedly underftood all that are at prefent fpoken in the ; he is alio well skill'd in the Ancient and Vulgar Greek,the Syriac, and the Hebrew. They could hardly have met with perfbns more able to have diffipated thele Clouds; neverthelefi they could do nothing; They were Greek Letters, they faid, for the moft part rnter- mix'd with other unknown Charadlers, of which iome were fomewhat like the Syriac : They read fome words here and there, but in regard they could find no Connexion of fenfe, they durft not be certain whether they read right or no. So that they were conftrain d to fend the Writing back to the firft Minifter; the Superiour of the Capuchins giving him this far ther account by the Meffenger, that it was a half half Cafaque writing, that he could not uncypher. They were therefore forc d to give credit to what the Com- miffioners had told 'em by word of mouth ,â€¢ which was always the lame thing that they had faid at firft. To which the Prime Minifter anfwered: ' If what you affure us be true, that you are come to be our Guefts, and to llirrender your ielves Slaves ' to his Majefty, wherefore do you enter with your ' Swords in your hands ? Why have you maffacr'd our Subjeds, laid waft our Cities, and pillagd our Territories? The Cofaques replid in juftification of themfelves that they had been rorcd to do it; for that when they came civilly to defire provifion for their money, the People of the City forget ful of the Laws of Hofpitality, and that Coinmileration which is due to ftrangers, fell upon 'em, and milus'd em â€¢ and there fore the neceffity of felf-defence ought to juftifiethe for endeavouringS o l y m a n III. K Perlla. 14.5 endeavouring to obtain that by force, which they could not get by fair means. At the fame time that they were thus treating with thefe Commiffioners,arriv'd an Envoy from Orom, that is to fay, the great Duke of Mufcovy ( which name I think the give him, becaufe that 1{ujfjiamakes a part of his Dominions) which Envoy prefented Letters from the grand Duke to the King of 'Perfia to this Effed, ' That whereas he underftood ' that a certain number of Cofaques being his Subjects, had ' quitted their Habitations, on purpofe to withdraw them- ' felves from his Obedience, and fought for Protection in 'Per- ' Jla, hedefir'd his Majefty not to receive'em, nor to give any 'credit to their Propoficions; That they were Rebels and Fu- ' gitives who vvould never be true to any other, fince they had ' been falle to their Prince; and that he was ordering Forces to ' reduce 'em to their former Obedience. But if the Muscovite Prince advis'd the not to believe the Cojaques, they were fufficiently affur'd, that they were not to give credit to him j for that the Court were all along of Opi nion that he held a correlpondencc with thole Boot-halers the Cofaques. And the reafon upon which they grounded their be lief was probable enough. For how is it poffible elfe faid the Politicians, that five or fix thoufand Fugitives ftiould come into a Country, with forty Barks, and four and twenty Pieces of Artillery, provided with all forts of Ammunition and Pro- vifion ? Is it not eafie to fee that it is the Grand Duke that fends 'em, to revenge the Affronts, which he is made believe his Embaffadoursreceiv'd ? And as the Grand Duke of Mufc Agent could not infufe a good opinion of his Mailer into the Court of fo nei ther could the Bajha of 'Basra's Envoy prevail in behalf of his. It has been faid, how that 'Bujha had made an Accommodation with the General of the Ottoman Army the laft year, and that he had fent his Son-in-law to Conjlantinople for a Ratification of the Agreement. But when he came there, the Minifters of the Port made him Anfwer, that the General of the Army had treated with the 'Sajha without their Order, and that they would by no means hear of that Agreement, for that the Place mufl ablb- lutely be furrender'd into the Grand Signior's hands. Where upon they ofter d the Bajha's Son-in-law, that if he would contribute to the reducing that place, he fhould be made Go- verour or Baflmof the Territory; and manag'd him fo well, that at laft he confented, and promis'd to make em Mafters ofThe Coronation it. After this, the Minifters difpatch to the fame Generals new Orders to return with their Forces to the Siege of ; fliarply rebuke the Bajha of 'Babylon for having been fo remifs in that Affair,- That the pretended agreement was to the prejudice and difhonour of the Empire ,â€¢ that he fliould repair the fault he had commited j and that they would make him General a fe- cond time, provided he would take the City by force, or con- ftrain ic to a furrender, and that when he had reducd it, he fhould conftitute for Governour Bajha, the Son-in-law of the 'Saf?a of Bafra himfelf. The Bap a of Ba/ra, when he heard thefe Tidings was ftrangely lurpriz'd at the Treachery of his Son-in-law, and fet himlelf to confider which way to divert his terrible ftorm that threatend him. And therefore perceiving in the Spring, that the Turkiflh Armies were preparing to thunder in upon him the next September or October for the heat of thofe Climates will not permit 'em to take the Field fooner he lent beforehand to offer his Territory to the King of upon fuch condi tion as he pleas'd himfelf, provided he might have the Com mand of it during his own Life. The Council of knew the Importance of that place; they faw how prejudicial it would be to Terfia, if it fliould fall into the hands of the Turks, and how advantageous it would be to themfelves to be Mafters of it. So that at another time, and under another Prince, they would willingly have embrae'd luch a Propolal ; but they were afraid to provoke that Bugbear of the Univerfe, that Pannic Terrour of the Earth, confidering the weak Eftate of the Empire under a Prince effeminated by Pleafures, and whole Age as well as his Humour render d him uncapable to under take great Actions. Therefore they gave no Politive Anfwer to the Envoy from Bafra, but put him off from day to day, and affur'd him they would take him into their Confideration, and all to gain time, for they were unwilling to lay we dare not,nor we cannot do it. While thefe things were tranla&amp;ed in Council, they were conliilting at Court the recalling of Boudak General of the Mufquetteers. For this fame Lord as well as the reft whom we have dilcours'd of, in the time of his being a Favourite had abus'd his Power,by which means he had rais'd himlelf many ene mies,whofe number daily increas'd. At firft they began to frame Complaints againft him, fo that his Authority began to lelfen by degrees, and his Prince s affection began to wax cold. Which made him fear the fame ill fortune as had befaln Gemjhid GovernorSo LYMAN HI King of Perfia. 14.7 Governor of I\andaar, and therefore he would not carry things with a high hand, as that Grandee had done, but before theMt- fchief was paft cure, he began to think which way he might retire filently and without any notice taken, to difcharge himfelf of that Envy, which the luftre of his good Fortune had brought upon him. The principal occafion of his loling his Mailers Favour was this. To the Eafl: of Ifpahan, and near adjoyning to his Terri tory lyes the Province of Lour-Eftom, which is held to be a part of ancient Tartlna, extending on Jrahids fide toward 'Bafra. The People that Inhabit it, never mind the building of Cities, nor have any fettl'd Abodes,but live in Tents, for the moft part feed ing their Flocks and their Heards, of which they have an infi nite number. They are Govern'd by a fyan who is fet over 'em by the King of Perjla but chofen from among themfelves: and for the moft part all of the fame Race, the Father Succeed ing the Son. So that there ftill remains among them fome flia- dow of Liberty,-however they pay bothTribute and Tenths.This Province furniflies Ijpahan and the Neighbouring parts with Car tel ; which is the reafon that the Governor of thefe People is greatly refpecled in thofe parts. the third therefore ac his coming to the Crown, commanded the General of the Muf- quetteers to fend Royal Habits and Gommiffions unto all the Grandees. But the General of the Mufquetteers having had fome quarrel with this Governor who is call'd Louy-Munoujhcu'l\jtdn , neglected to do him that Honour, putting off his fending the Kings Prefent to him till fix Months after. The Cyundcsimpatiently brookd the contempt; and beincr fufficiently convinc d who was the occafion of it, for mad- nefslie tore in pieces the Habit which was prefented him, faying withal, I value not the Habits, nor the Commiffions which the King of ferfia's General of the Mufquetteers fends me. His Majefty knew nothing of this for a good while ,â€¢ the thing was conceal'd from him, for fear at the fame time he fliould have inform'd himfelf of the Caufe. But the Prince himfelf inform'd the King; for fome time after he defir'd leave to come to Court and kifs the Kings feet,- which was granted him: .He paid his Homage to his Majefty, deliver'd him his Prelent which was very Magnificent, and aftewards made his Complement that the General of the Mufquetteers having by his order fent Royal Habits to all the Grandees of Terfta, even to the meaneft Officer, had omitted the fending to hrai for feven or eight Months, and after all had fait only by one of his Servants, Ttttt z TheThe Coronation The King took it very ill, and declar'd to the General of the Mufquetteers, that his manner of proceeding did not pleafe him. However his Majefty would not ruine him altogether,having an efteem for him as being the Perfon that had plac d him upon the Throne. And therefore he fpar'd him, as his Predeceflbrs had always done, in being gentle to thofewho brought 'em the foft tydings of their advancement; for they never put 'em to death, as being fatisfi'd with their difgrace and misfortune. The General of the mufquetteers was then at Court in this Condition of his Affairs; but he could not continue long in that pofture; when the death of one of his Relations, or at leaft of one whom he fo call'd gave him a fair opportunity to retire with Credit. This pretended kindfman of his was call'd Abdul 'Bek Chief Porter of the Haram or Palace of Women. The Gene ral therefore as foon as he heard of his death, prefented a Petiti on to the King, wherein he fet forth, that Jhdal-'Beck was his kinfman, that the Imployment which he had executed had con- tinu'd in their Family from time to time, as it were hereditary. Wherefore in confideration that the deceas'd Officer had left no Sons to ferve his Majefty in fuch a particular and ordinary Em ployment, he was willing to lay down, his Commiffion of Ge neral of the Mufquetteers, and his Right of fitting before his Majefty in publick Affemblies, and that he fhould think him- felf more happy to be employ d in keeping the Gate of his Ma- jefties Palace for the Women. The King, who for the reafbns already alledg'd ftill preferv'd fome kind of AfFedtion for him, granted his Requeft. And it was then that he had conferr'd upon him the favour of keeping the Womens Palace-Gate, to fhelter him from the Tempeft that threatned him j and thus he deliver'd himfelf from the Intrigues of the Court. This was he whom Hah as II. had fent EmbafTador to Au- reng Zeb, King of the Indies, after he came to be in quiet Pof- feffionof the Empire. We fliall in its proper place relate how he then carry'd himfelf, tho the famous who was then at the Court, when this Embaffador, appear'd there fpeaks fufficiently of it in his Works made publick to the World, to iatisfie the Readers Curiofity. Upon this Sheik-Hah-I'yaan was recall'd from the War againfl the lusbeks, where he Commanded as General, to be advanc'd to the Charge of General of the Mufquetteers, which was a Noble Employment, as well as to all the reft to which he was af terwards rais'd. He is a Perfon of Courage,and an excellent Cap tain, one of thofe old Heroes that rendred the Reign ofthe Grcac fo Glorious and Triumphant. His Government of Chdhka was at the fame time conferr d upon one of his Sons Icimaan Kjin, who is a Noble-man of Merit and Courage, and worthy fuch an Illuftrious Father, , The Lightning of Royal disfavour fell afterwards upon qt-Sadec, which name of Sadek in the Oriental Languages fig- nifiesj^and is the fame with Sadoc among the Hdmvs. Hewas Brother to Mir^a-lbralm already mention'd, and worfe then he; YdZter or Farmer-Royal of Fan or the ancient Terfia. The Com plaints of Shir as at length threw him out of this Employment. The People had for feveral years with hearty prayers to Heaven implor'd his Ruin, but could never obtain it; they clamour'd againft his Robberies and Violences; whole crouds of Petitioners throng'd to Court with complaints againft him; but his Prefents and his fpecious Letters fruftrated all their Attempts. Nay,one of the principal Occafions of the Dut Embaffie in the year 1666. was to complain of his Vexations, and the ftop which he gave to their Trade. All the World thought that fuch a blow as that would have fetch'd his Head from his Shoulders; but he fended it off by the help of a Sifter which he had in the Womens Palace. So that he was difcharg'd with only a fevere Repri mand which was fent him in a Patent of which the Dutch them- felves were the Meffengers. At length this very year fo many frefh complaints came aginft him, that he could find no more Evafions, neither would his pretences avail any longer, though he ply'd the Court ftill to the value of about thirty thoufand pound; which they took, but ipar d him never a whit the more. He was expell'd from his Employment and all his Goods C011- fifcatcd. It was believ'd at Court that his Eftate would have amounted to feveral hundred thoufand pounds, but they were amaz'd when they found that the Account rofe to no more then 80200 /â€¢ Sterling in Gold and Silver, which he had at home in his Coffers, fix thoufand four hundred pound in Goods, Movea bles, Horfes, Stuffs, Merchandize, and fuch other like Furniture which was not for ordinary ufe. In his Treafurers Coffers was found feven thoufand pound in Silver Money, and eight un- dred feventy five pound in Duckats of Gold. This crafty Lord longforefaw what then befel him; and therefore he had convey'd away his Jewels, and what he ha of moft coftly value, and the greateft part of his ready Money; and had only left thofe Sums at home to dazle the Eye, an make the Court believe it was his whole Eftate. But no bo y could imagine it, and his Majefty fent into all Places belong-^ ^ 0 The Co ingtoliisJurifdidk^an cxp^rOKler to makrdTl^enc'^rch for all Goods and Money, or whatever elfe might be thought to belong to the Offender, and put forth a Proclamation for all to difcover what they knew. The fame was done at jfpahan : but notwithftanding all that extraordinary diligence there was no more difcover'd then about fixty thoufand Crowns; befides Goods that were not moveable, f he King kit him all the Furniture of his Palace: nor did he meddle with his Ward robe, nor with any thing that belong'd to his Women, nor with any thing that was for common ufe in his Offices and Stables. Befide, he gave him liberty to enjoy a yearly Revenue of four thoufand pound Sterling to maintain him fhut up in a Palace a little way diftant from ; whence he was not to ftir himfelf; but might receive the Vifits of his Friends.

After his Fall the King would not confer his Place upon any Lord, as being one of the moft gainful Employments in Terfit, but fent to a certain Terjtan Lord of an ancient Family, who refided at Shiras, whole name was Sefie-KouU-Sultaan a fhort Commiflion, under the Title of vince, till he fhould th.ink fit to fupply the Place other ways. We have told ye how the greateft part of thole that fell into dilgrace in the Reign of Hah as II. return'd from their Exile, and were reftor'd tofavor,at the beginning of the new Reign. In the number of thele was Mir%a Ha one of the moft Learned Lords of fperfia, able to inftrud whoever would be defirous to know whatever is of choiceft Secrecy in that Empire, whether as to the Situation of Places,as to Hiftory or Politicks: and therefore it was that I endeavour'd to benefit by his friendflhip and difcourfe. The Chief Minifter to the deceas'd King made outtheProcefs againft him, and had confin'd him to his Palace in ; whence he never ftirr'd, till after the death of that Monarch. And in re gard he often frequented the Court, and was in great Reputa tion there, he was advane'd to the Employment of Farmer-Roy al of IQrmaan or Caramania. There was alio living in fome three years fince, an ancient Indian Princefs, who was there detain'd a Prifbner. .She was Sifter to the laft King of and was call'd by the name of Saheh-J^oud-pek, that is to fay in the of the Indies, the Little Lady ; to denote a lecond Princefs, that has another above her. This Lady wasretir'd to Vijapour, and toward the end of her days was defirous to make a Pilgrimage to carryingS o l y m a n III. Kjng Perfia. carrying along with her an immenfe Treafure. In purfuance of this Pilgrimage fhe paffed through Verfu. But II. for reafons that never were yet well underftood, having her in his Power, would not permit her to go any farther, nor to re turn out of his Dominions, tho fhe offer'd feveral times confi- derable Preients to obtain that favour. The new Prince, and that year the New Soleimaan, did not ftiew himfelf fo infenfible of the Ladies Prefents, as his Father had done, but condefcended to what Che defir'd, and receiv'd from her a Treafure of Jewels of an ineftktiable value. For fhe took her time one day that the King pafs'd by the Houle where iTie had been lodg'd, and went forth her felf with her Prefents and her Petition. She had alfo prepar'd a fumptu- ( ous Banquet to be made ready in the Court that belong'd to the Houfe, and caus'd the Street to be ipread with Cloth of Gold for the King to ride over; and as he rode along, her Officers came and threw under his Horles feet whole handfuls of money both Gold and Silver, to the value of two thoufand Crowns. Which is a piece of Pomp and Grandeur pradis'd in when any one would honour the Prince after a more fplendid and obliging mariner. Toward the end of the year 166 8.arriv'd in Terjia a new mi of Italian Capuchins,knt by the for the the Faith, for Georgia.

Thefe two meeting together in the Ifland of MUo, the Marcjuifs gave the other an Invitation a-board, at what time among other things falling into difcourfe about Pi racy, 57,-, faid the Marqnifs to the Knight, as I Was inform'd not long after, by fome Gentlemen that were prefent, The Robberies, the Murders^ the Sacrilsdges^ your (Blafphe/tiics, and in a word, Crimes, do they notftrike aTerrour P hope for Par adife P Or do you believ If ho reply d the Knight, Not at all. not a tittle of any fitch thing. Thus you may fee the Natural Difpofition of Pyrates. Concerning whom I will add this one Particular more. While we ftaid for a Wind in the Port of there ar- Hv'd in that Haven two Firft-Rate Men of War. They enter'd in the Night-time. The Admiral coming to an An chor, fir'd ieveral Squibs from his Main-Top-Mall:. This is call'd Giving the (Rocquet, from the Italian word which itgnifies a Squib : And this is done to give Notice to the Chriftian Cdrfairs or Rovers, if any fhould happ'n to be iriT'he T' ravels of Sir John Chardm Petfia, Port, to weigh and be gone before Day. Two were there at that prefent time. They fet Sail early the next Morning, and came to an Anchor behind a Promontory not above a Lea&lt;nie from the Port. The Admiral was a Nobleman of Venfce to whom I gave a Vifit, and defiring to know rfie reafon of his firing the Rocquets, he told me he had Or ders fo to do ; for that the Republick being engag'd to the Grand Sivttior by the Treaty at to clear the Archi- pdaeo of all 0 the Chriftian Rovers, and to fake as many of 'em, as they could, yet in regard of the feveral good Services which the Rovers had done the Republick in the laft War, he took that courfe to fatisfie the Port, without ading to the pre- iudice of the Rovers. And this was the reafon that the Ships of the Republick were oblig'd always to make themfeives known in the Archipelago, to the end the Chriftian Pyrates might keep at a diftance from em, and not approach within ken 5 that fo they might be faid not to have had any fight of 'em. In the Day-time, added he, we are known by our Co lours ; but in the Night, when we enter any Port, we let off thefe Rocquets; and fometimes alfo we fend certain Officers alhore, to difcover whether there be any Chriftian Rovers in Port, and fo give 'em Notice to be gone. . I arriv 'd at Smyrna thefeventh 1672, after being four Months at Sea. In which tedious Voyage we endur'd much Cold, and many a boyftrous Storm. We were in wane of Victuals 5 nor could we have made this Voyage with more Danger or more Hardftsip I fhall not trouble my felf to make any Defcription of Smyrna, where I found nothing worthy Remark, or in any other part of the Archipelago, more than what is to be found in the Relations of Spon, and other Travellers, Men of Learning and Exaftnefs, who have been there fince my time. I {hall therefore content my felf with recounting fome Particulars re lating to Commerce and Hiftory, of which they have not fpoken. r The Enolifh drive a great Trade at and over all the Levant. This Trade is drivVi by a Royal Company fet- led at London:, which is Govcrn'd after a moft prudent man ner, and therefore cannot fail of iuccefs. It has ftood almoft thefe hundred Years, being fii ft Confirm'd towards the middle of Queen Elizabeth's Raign. A Raign famous for having, among other 1 hings, giv'n I ife to feveral Trading Compa nies, particularly thofe of HamborQyiffra, the -â– thrmgh the Black-Sea, and Country Colchis. %Lajl-lndies and TÂ«ri^V, all which remain to this Day. Trade was then in its Infancy 5 and there is no greater Mark of the Ignorance of thofe Times, in reference to Countries, though but a little remote, then the Aflbciation which thofe Mer chants made : for they pyn'd feveral together in one Body, for mutual Condudt and Affiftance. That Company which relates to the Turkilh Trade, is of a particular fort: For it is not a Society, where every one puts in a Sum for one General and United Stock : It is a Body which has nothing in Com mon, but a peculiar Grant and Priviledge to Trade into the Levant. It affumes to it felf the Name of The Com pany. None are admitted into it, but Sons of Merchants, or fuch as have ferv'd an Apprenticefhip to the Tradej which in England is for Seven Years. They give to be admitted into the Society about an Hundred and Twenty Crowns, if undet the Age of Twenty Five Years-j and douWe if above that Age. The Company never comtfiits to any one fingle Perfon their Power, nor the lole Management of their Affairs, but manage their Bufinefs among themfelves by the Plurality of Voices. So that who has fufficient to drive a Trade that will bear an Im'- pofitibn of Eight Crowns, has as good a Vote as he that Trades for an Hundred Thoufand. This Aflembly, thus Democratkaly fends out Ships, Levies Taxes upon all their Commodities, prefents the Ambaflador whom the King fends to the Elects two Confuls, the one for the Other for Ale^o, and prevents the fending of Goods which are not thought proper for the Levant. It confifts at prelent of about Three Hundred Merchants, befides that they bring up in a great number of young Perlbns well defcended, who learn the ' Trade upon the Place it felf. (This Trade amounts to about Five or Six Hundred Thouiand Pounds yearly, and confifts in Cloaths made in England, and Silver which they carry as well out of England, as out of Spain, and In exchange bf which they bring back Wool, Cotton-Yarn, Galls, Raw Silk and Wov'n, together with fome other Commodities of lefs valued Now the Company, finding that Malice which In- tereft begets among Perlbns of the fame Profeffion, would in time be the Ruine of their Society, by Enhancing or Loring the price of Goods on purpofe to under-feil one another 5 and that the fame Malice caufes the Merchants to be at variancfe with the Confuls, the Confuls with the Ambaflador 5 (which is the reafon that many times where Expences are requifite, an Unfeafcnable Stinginefs in the Ambaflador caufes great Impofi- C tions(The Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, tions and Fines, and other fevere Vexations to the Nation) The Company, I fay, forefeeing thefe Mifchiefs, have pru dently provided a Remedy to prevent em. For the Englifh Cloth, of which they fend into about Twenty Thou- fand Pieces yearly, and the chiefeft part of the reft of their Merchandize is fent to the Factors with a Bill or of the Price at what they are bound to fell; together with ano ther Bill of the Price certain for thofe Goods which they give order to be bought} and by that means it never happens that the Merchants receive any Damage in the Profped or Defign of their Profit. For the prevention of thefe and other diforders } the Company oives a Penfion to the Englilh Ambaflador, who refides at the Wort5 to the Confuls^nd all their Principal Officers,as the Mini- fl;er,the Chancellor, the Secretary,the Interpreters,the Janifaries and others. Which Officers have no Power to Levy any Taxes or Sums of Money upon the Merchandize, whether under the pretence of Duties, or Prefents, or any other extraordi nary Expences. But when any thing of that Nature is to be done, they give Notice to the Deputies of the Nation, who are Two Perfons appointed to Aft in the Name of the reft. Thefe Deputies examine and debate with the Ambaflador, or the Conful, What is fit to be given, What Journeys are ne- ceflary to be made to the fort,and what is there to be tranf aÂ£l:ed : Not but that the Ambaflador or Conful may not A6t of themfelves, but they obferve that method to acquit and juftifie themfelves 5 and fbmetimes upon Emergent and Ex traordinary Affairs they aflemble the whole Body of the Na tion. So foon as they are come to a Relult, the Deputies give Notice to theTreafurer to provide w T hat is neceflary, whe ther it be Money, Toys or Curioficies. This Treafurer alfo is fetl'd by the Company, and provides Money for every thing, difcharges pun&amp;ually all manner of Charges and Ex pences, and pays exactly the Wages of every Officer. Thus the Ambaflador and Confuls have no more to do but only to mind the Security of the Englilh Nation, and the good of Trade, without being incumber'd and diverted by their own Interefls. There are alfo many other excellent Regulations and Orders for the fupport of their Trade in the ; by which means they carry it on with Honour and Profit beyond any of their Neighbors. + Thethrough the Black-Sea, and 0/Colchis. The Hollanders alio drive a great Trade at and ? ' more then any other Nation of but they have lit tie to do elfewhere ; all their Dealing in all the reft of the Cities in the Levant amounting to little or nothina Their principal Profit confifts in carrying the their Goods into Europe, and carrying 'em back again.) Thev al io make great Advantage of their Money, of which is very full. This Money of theirs is made of bafe Mettle and notonouny intermix'd with Counterfeit pieces, [t chief ly confifts of Crowns, Half-Crowns, or Eiehreen- penny pieces and pieces of Fifteen Sous. The Crowns and Halt-Crowns for the moft part carry the Dutch Stamp. Which the furks therefore call Aflani, that is to fay Lyons 5 in regard or their being mark'd on both fides with the Figure of a Lyon The Arabians, either out of Ignorance or otherwife, miftak- mg the Lyon for a Dog, give 'em the Name of or 'Dogs. The Quarter-Pieces are almoft all Counterfeit; or at Beft, but Half Silver. However the Turks are fo void of Judgment and Underftanding, that they efteem this Mony beyond that of Spain, which they call Marfillies, by reafe n that the Merchants of Marfeilles firft brought it in great Quan tities into Jurkte. The States maintain a Vtydeat at the Port, with an Allow- ance of Four Thoufand Crowns a Year. Which Reftdent has befides the one Moyety of the Revenue of the Dutch Con- luluiips in the Levant, which fometimes amounts to a confi- derable Sum there being one Dutch Conful at Smyrna, who got Iifty Thoufand Crowns by Duties. When I arriv'd there it happen d that there was a great Quarrel between the Conful and the Merchants: For he accus'd them for Cheats; Appeal- in g ^ Books for the truth of his Affirmation 5 and dehr d they might be view'd i to which the Merchants would by no means give their confent. The deficient not daring to determine this Difference, both Parties referr'd themfelves to the States. But at laft, for fear the coming of the Convoy fhould occafion farther difturbances, the Merchants and the Conful agreed the Duties of the Confulfhip, at Ten Thou fand Five Hundred Crowns, for all that the Convoy brousht in, and Shipt off 5 The French are very numerous in and over all the Levant, there not being a Port of Turlye upon the nean Sea, wherein there are not feveral. They are for the fnoft part all Vrovenqalls. But the Trade which they drive is foI The Trawls of Sir John Chard in Perfia, fo inconfiderable, that one Merchant in each Place m.ght dif- patch all the Bufinefs. At Smyrna, for example, there are bove a Hundred Merchants; and yet the Truth is, that in Tome Years the Effeas that came out of conhgnd to all thofe Merchants did not amount to above Four Hundred Thoufand Livres ; and there are many that have not above Five Hun- dred Crowns Stock :) Befides that they agree bur very badly together, as being a fort of people that Love to harbour Divi- fion and Contention one among another. So that it is no wonder if their Trade decreafe, and turn to lofs rather then profit. For they who better underftand the Nature and Maxims of Trade, affirm, That that fame Dif-union is the Thing which ruins'em in the Levant, fo that if weffiould compare thepre- fent with the former Trade which they drove, we ffiould find it more miferable and pitiful then even I hey add moreover that the Frovenqalls have formerly had in thofe fortu nate Chances and Luckie Opportunities, that it is highly to be wonder'd, that they did not fill their Country with Wealth in that happy Conjun&amp;ure. One of thofe Lucky Seafons be gan about the Year 16^6,and lafted Thirteen ^ears, during which time they drove a Trade, by which they gain'd Four- fcore and Ninety per. Cent. This Trade which was really and truly a great piece of Kna very conilHed in thefe Five-Sous-Tieces that have matle fuch a Noife. For the Turks took the firft that were brought at Ten Sous apiece: At which rate they held up for fome time ; tho afterwards they fell to Seven and a half. There was no other Mony Stirring: All was full of it; nei ther was there any other Mony to be had; for that the French carri'd all the other Money away. This good Fortune fo intoxicated their Senfes, that not content with fuch great Gains, they ftill thirfted after more ; and to that purpofe they fet themielves to alter their own pieces of and made others of the lame fort, but of bafe Mettle, which they Coin'd firfi: at Dombet , then at Oranve , and afterwards at Avignon. More then this, they Stampt far worfe at and Florence ; And laftly they made more of the fame Stamp in the remote Caftles belonging to the of and other private places, which were only Copper plated over. The Merchants of Marfeilles^ to utter this Money, brought down the price themfelves, and put off their Pieces in payment, and to the Mony-Changers at a lower Rate then the Current \ alue. T he Turks were a long time before they perceiv'd the Cheatthrough the Black-Sea, and Colchis. Cheat that was put upon 'em, though fo palpable and of fo great a Confequence ; but fo foon as they found it out, they ^vere fo incens'd, that they laid moft heavy Impoficions upon, the French, ufing 'em no better then Counterfeiters of Money, though the Dutch and Genoefes had a hand in it as well as they. Thereupon they forbid 'em to utter any of thofe Pieces which they call'd Timmins, but fuch as were ftamp'd with the real Arms of France^ which they alio brought down and put at Five Sous apiece. So that all the Merchants, ex cept the Englipj, were loaded at that time with great Quan tities of thole Jimm s. Their Warehoufes were full, whole Ships Loadings of em arriv'd daily, and they began to Coin 'em in all parts. But foon after, this Money being cry d down, feveral of thofe Money-Merchants loft all their Gains, and many much more then ever they got. . The Englifh were the Procurers of this Decry. For had that Money continu'd Currant, their Trade had been ruin'd, which confided chiefly in the purchafe of Silks. And the realbn was, becaufe the 'i/w/w/Vj-Merchants caus'd an advance to be .made upon the price of Silks, not caring what they gave, provided the Sellers would take their Pieces of Five in payment, I have feen above Fifty feveral forts of Coins of this fort of Money. But the mofi: common fort carri'd on the one fide a Womans Head with this Motto, Virtu lis imago : On the other, the Arms of with this Imprefe, Currcas per tot am Afiam, There are no People in the World that have been more fre quently cheated , or that are more eafily gull'd then the 'iHrks; as being naturally very dull, and thick-skull'd, and apt to believe any fair Story : Which is the reafon that the Chriftians have impos'd a f houiand Cony-catching-Tricks, and Cheats upon em. But though you may deceive em once or twice, yet when their Eyes are op'n, they ftrike home, and pay ye once for all. And thole fort of Impoficions which they lay upon Offenders in that Nature, are call d ; which are not always unjuft Impofitions neither ; they being like the Confifcations fo frequent in Cuftom-Houfes: Where for the moft part the Chief Minifters and their Officers devour the People, while the 'Port winks at all the firft time, and only exhorts to Amendment. If the Complaints ceafe, the Offence is ftifl'd ; but if the Clamour grow too loud, the Tort lends to take off the Head of the Party accus'd, and Confilcates his Eftate. By which means the People are fatisfi'd, the Trea- D furyThe Trawls of Sir John Chardin into Perlk, fury is fill'd, Juftiee is done, and the Example remains to ter-! rifie others. The Merchants of Marfeilles affirm, That the Impohnon of thefe Fines was the main thing that Ipoil d the Trade of th^ French in the Levant, as having coft 'em fuch prodigious Sums. But of all the Impofitions that ever I heard of^ there is one which I fhall never forget, that was laid upon the Mer chants, at the time that K de was the Ambaflador of France at the Tort, which happen'd thus. His Excellency had a great defire to turn one of the Skniors Farmers, and to Farm the Cuftoms of and Smyrna. But at the end of Six Months, K find ing himfelf a Hundred Thoufand Franks in Arrear, requefted to'be difcharg'd : which was a favour granted him on con dition he would pay what he ow'd. But in regard he wanted Money, the Turksoblig'd the Nation to pay for hinr. Thereupon he told the Merchants, That he had not tak'n upon him to Farm the Cuftoms, but in hopes to advance the Trade of the French, and to prevent the Squabbles and Diffe rences which daily arofe between the and Them about the payment of their Duties. To which the Merchants fail'd not to make a fair Apology, and to juftifie themfelves by fo- lid Reafon : but all to no purpofe: there was no more to be done, but they mufi: pay down the Hunderd Thoufand i fb that for want of Money of their own, they were reduc'd to that Exigency, as to borrow the Sum of the at Five and Twenty per Cent. for Six Months. And I am certainly aflur'd by perfons that were well acquainted with all the pafla* ges, that it was fo long before the Hunderd Thoufand Franks were paid, that the Intereft amounted to three times as much as the Principal; fo that this A or Impoficion coft the French Nation near an Hunderd and Fifty Thoufand Crowns. Two other Impofitions they paid, during the Embaffie of M. de la Flaye, the Son, which amounted to Two Hundred Thoufand Franky. I liave alio heard that one of his Prede- ceffors for Fifteen Years together took of eery Mer chant-Man that came to Conjlantinople Five Hunderd Crowns, to le-imburfe himfelf of a pretended Expence of Six Hundred Crowns for the Advancement of the Trade of the Nation 5 and when they made it out, that he had repaid himfelf that bum a hunderd times over, he made anfwer, my Accompts, I take no more then Thethrough the Black^Sea, an 0/Colchis. The Venetians Maintain a Co at as alfo fioefesj yet there are few Merchants, Natives in either ofthofe two Republicks, that live there ; efpecially of the Genoefes Who have little or nothing to do in the They were only fetl d there at firft by reafon of the great Trade which they drove in Five-SoM-fieces, in regard of the great nrofr which they gain'd. So that as foon as that Trade was prohi* bited, their principal Merchants retir'd ; Only two or three remain'd at Smyrna, and orte at Conftantinople. Thereupon their Levant Company began to diflblve it felf, and there is no' queftion but the Whole Eftabliftment of the Genoefes had ut terly gone to ruine, by the recalling their deficient from the Fort, And thenConful from Smyrna, had they not been better advis d then to make that Revocation, upon two Confidera- rions. Firft, Becaufe the Turks never fuffer Nations that are fetl-d among 'em to retire for good and all. Secondly, be- daufe fuch an entire abandoning the Country, would have too manifeftly difcovefd the beggerly Reafon that fway'd the Repubhck in an Enterprife that had coft 'em fo dear, and which had given France an Occafion to fliew how highly fhe was difpleas'd at their Gondua. For the better under^ Handing of which Tranfaftion, the Reader perhaps may not think his time ill fpent in viewing three or four Pages. / In the firft place therefore give me leave to obferve That the Genoefes were formerly very powerful in the Levant, as being the Lords and Mafters of feveral Iflands in the Archi- pelago, of feveral Places upon the Coaft of the and leveral Cities upon the [Blacl^-Ssa, Lera alio, now the Su- burlas of Conftantinople, was Under their Jurifdi^ion. Upon w'hich there is no need for me to dilate, in regard the Stories of paft Ages have giv'n a fufficient Account, how and at What time they loll all this fair Extent of Dominion. But the War in Candy, which happen'd in the Year 1^4^. encou- rag'd 'em to revive their Commerce in the Territories of the Grand Signior ; imagining they fliould make themfelves Ma fters of that Trade which the Ve drove there before the War. And to the end they might bring about this Defign with more fpeed and fecurity, they apply'd themfelves to the King of France for his Recommendation, as being the trioft Antient, and moft Confiderable Allie of the Empire. Which was cafily condefcended to by the King's Council, whd aad Affairs in their Heads of greater Importance then Trades In12 In fo much that they did not forefee the gteat Dammages which it would bring upon the French Nation ; of ^h'ch the moft confiderable was the prejudice done to the Articles of the Treaty between the Crown of France and the being a kind of Annihilation of one of the Principal Capitulations, wherein it was concluded, That European^ fbould deftre to fettle in the Levant, Trade, but under the Banners andfroteciion France. How ever the Genoefes being thus recommended by the King, M di la Have, the Father, then the French EmbalTador in Turkic, us'd theutmoft of his endeavours to affift era. Neverthelefs it came to nothing, becaufe, as they fay, it was not profecu- ted with that vigor as it ought to have been. In the Year i 664.. they were very fierce upon it again, en- coura^'d by the great Profit which was got by Pieces of Five- Sows. But they could not then expeft that the French fhould follicite in their behalf as they had done before, becaufe the Face of Affairs was alter'd, as well in refped of Traffick in General, as of the Levant Trade in particular; rather they faw that their Enterprize would be difpleafing to How ever they believ'd, that the King of had fo embroird himfelf with the Tur\, by the Afliftance which he had givn the Venetians and the Emperor, that they did not think his Op- poficion or his Recommendation would ftand em in any ftead. Thereupon they fought the Affiftance of and the Em pire, and as for France, they fatisfi'd themfelves with giving the King a bare Information of their defign. Their Refident inform'd the King that there was a fetting up at Genoa, and that the %eptiblicJ^ had a defign to fend an Am- baflador to the Port, in hopes that his Majefty would favour their Negotiation. But the King faid no more, then only that he wifli'd the ^epHblkk^ aW good fuccefs. Which Anfwer increafing the Sufpicions that the had already conceiv'd, and putting 'em into a deep doubt what Re ception they (hould meet with at Conftantinople, they lent nito the Marquifs of Durai.'z.o, as a Perfon that had the chiefcft Intereft in the Company, to fift out the Truth, and to treat privately with the Filter; to which purpofe he went , with Count Lefley, the Emperors Extraordinary Amballador, as one of his Train, fn fhort, he faw the and treated with him, and by the Mediation of the (aid AmbaiTador, and the Ambaffador of England, who were very active in forward ing the Negotiation, obtain'd that the Genoefes fhould have the + famethrough the Black-Sea, and Colchis. fame Articles with the Bnglifh and Upon which the Envoy, having the Grand Viz word in the Name of his Highnefs, return'd to Genoa, and gave an Account of his Ne gotiation with the Divan. Prefently thereupon the Gemefes fitted out two Ships, and fent the fame Marquifs of Dura^o again in Quality of an AmbafTador. However the firft Conferences which the had with the Vitiier were not fo fecretly carried, but that the in the Levant had private fntelligcncc of the Marquifs's Proceed ings. Immediately they were much troubl'd at this Defign of the Gemefes, fearing it would be a great prejudice to their Trade ; which Was the reafbn that they wrote into France, that their Trade would be much impair'd, if the to be fetl'd in Turfye â– , and therefore that all means were to bs ys'd to prevent 'em. Which Addrefs procur'd a Refolution to hinder 'em, and Inftrudions to that purpofe were fent to the French Ambaflador at the who was then M Jrlaye, the Son. Nofooner therefore was become back from Jclriample,where. he had been about other Affairs, but he receiv'd Orders to op- pofe the Eftablifhment of the Gemefes. Which made him fend back immediately for leave to return. For in no Ambaffador muft appear at Court without Permiffion. But it happen'd that the Grand Vizier was not then in Town, be ing gone toward Theffaly, to haften the Siege of And as for the Cairnacan, who is as it were his He, having private Intelligence of the new Inftru(5tions which the Am baflador had receiv'd from Fra made anfwer. That he could not grant the Ambaffador leave, without the ziers conlent. This the AmbafTador look'd upon as a flat Refufal; and therefore fent a Gentleman to Adrianople with Inftru6Hons, to reprefent to the ChiefMinijiers, That by the Capitulations be tween the Emperor of France and the the was oblig'd not to entertain any Nation, new Comers, but under the Colours of France, and lo it was contrary to the Capitulations to Treat with the for which rea- fon if they did proceed to a Conclufion of the Treaty, He would be gone. Which Meflage, together with fo much of his Inftru&amp;ions as he thought requifite, were fent to the Vizier, and debated in the place where he lay. But the An fwer which the Vi -z .ier return'd, was very harfh and unci vil. Which was not to be wonder'd at in regard the E wasThe Travels rf Sir John Chardm Perfia, was at that time highly incensd tor the Afhont which he had rcceiv'd in 9 hy means oF the Ois Fveply therefore was, 'That the fVt was open for him as well to 'go, as to come : That the Emperor of had nothing to 'do to hinder the Grand Signior from making a Peace with his ' Antient Enemies, or to grant 'em their Capitulations when 'they came to demand enT: and that it might fuffice his Ma- ' jefty to be acknowledged at the under the Titles of Em- 'peror and Chief Monarch of Ch without taking up- ' on him to prefcribe to others what they were to do. The AmbafTador of Genoa arriv'd at at the fame time that thefe Endeavours were us'd to prevent his Recepti on. Which was to him however no furprize, in regard he had already had Intelligence while he was at Sea, that fomc llich thing was in Agitation. Befides, he had Advice, that the Refidentof Genoa in France, having made known to the King, that his Mafters had fent the Marquifs of in the Quality of an Amballador to the King (hould return thisAnfwer j I wifh the Ambaffa ^epuhheh^a good Voyage^ but Ikiiow not what our Ove 'Port this Occafion. I have leen feveral People who were of Opinion, that if the Grand Vizier had not had a particular Peek againft the French , and fome kind of averfion to the Ambaflador's Per- fon, that the Gcnoefes had not been receiv'd into the For that the 'Port had no fuch high value for an Interefl: of Trade,to grant a favour to the prejudice of from which their Hands Were fo fpecioufly ty'd with a fair pretence. After I had ftaid twelve days at I embark'd for Conftantinople, where I arriv'd the Ninth of and Landed without any trouble, any danger, or any expence a very great Qnancity of Rich Goods, which ! brought along with me, be ing more then two Horfes could carry. ' For Nointel did me that favour as to give me leave to put his Name and the Florvre de Lices upon my Chcfts, and then fent for 'em as be longing to himfelf Which was done with the greateft eale in the World. For he prefently fent his Interpreter to the Officer of the Cuflom-Houje, to let him know that he had two Chefts aboard a Flemifh Veflel that arriv'd the day before, v hich belong'd to him^ and therefore defir'd they might be dehver'd Cuftom-free. Accordingly the Officer gave fuch Older, that the Interpreter went aboard the Dutch Veflel, un laded the two Chefts, and fent 'em to the Ambaffador sHoufe, whothrmgh the Black-Sea, and Colcliis. who did me Kindnefles to fend 'eril to my Lodging the next day. (For all AttibafladorS, Pxefidents, and Envoys that refide at' the fort, have the Pnviledge to Import and Export whatever they pleafe ; provided they undertake to own the Goods as belonging to themfeives; nor does the Officer of the Cuftoms dare to take any Cognifance of it. Which is a Civility ahd Oencrofty of the Turks not to be parallell'd irt When I arriv'd at Conjiantinople, M Nointel was prepa ring to attend the Grand SigniDr at Jdriamplc, in order to the Renovation of the Articles. It was an Affair of great Impor tance, and which had made a great Noife the World as having hung in fufpence for Seven Yeats together^ and for that the Titr^sftill ftood upon their Terms and haughtily flighted the Ambaflador notwithftanding that they were then entring into a doubtfull War againft Pola And now I fhall give ye an accompt of the Original of the Differences that were at that time grown to a great Height between and 'Turkic. At the beginning of the Raign of the IV. the pre- fent Emperor of the Turks, who afcended the Imperial Throne at Seven \ears of Age, in the Year i^^.8. the Government was folely in the Hands of Women and Eunuchs, who fill'd all the Chief Places of Honour and Trufl with fuch Perfbns as they pleas'd themfeives. And the Turks acknowledge, that the Ottoman Court was never fo corrupt, nor in fuch a ftran^e Confufion as at that Time. You fhould fee almoft every Month a new Grand Vizier, who after he had been feme few days in his Office^ was not only difcharg'd from his High Im^ ployment, but many times depriv'd of his Life. Now ft is the Cuftom in Turkic y that upon the Advancement of any Vizier, all Perfons of Quality go to kifs his Hands, and carry him fome conftderable Prefent. More particularly all Ambaf- fadors are oblig'd to that Ceremony. But the Father, then Ambaflador of Franc at the Tort^ obferving the frequent Changes of Grahd Viz at that time, concluded that there would be no Reformation of; this evil- Management during the Emperor's Minority, and that all his Vifits and Prefents to the ISletp Vizier, were but fb many Vifits and Pre- fentsloft. So that herefolv'd to fit ftill Qnietly, and to fpare his Compliments and the charge of his Prefents. It happen'd in a fhort while after, that Mahomet 'Pacha, receiv'd the Seals of the Empire, that is to fay, was advane'dqihe Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, advanc'd to the High Dignity of Vt%ter. But the Am- baffador ftillbelievd that his Fortune would be no better then that of his Predeceffors, and that he had but a very fhort Raign â– , but he was deciev'd ; for it fo fell out, that this Vizier upheld himfelf in his Office, till his Death, which hap- pen'd in the Year i &lt;552. , â€¢ , r So foon as he was advanc'd, every one pay d him their Vifits, and made him their accuftom'd Prefents, and among the Reft all the Forraign Minifters, except the French Ambafiador. To which as they fay, he was adviz'd and feveral times moft earneftly prefs'd; but his good Husbandry for the Nation was fuch, that he would not be over-rul'd. However at length percieving that Cuferly fix'd himfelf at Court upon the Ruine of feveral of the Grandees, and that according to all outward Appearances he was like to continue at length he made him both his Vifit and bis Prefents. But then the Vi%ier, hainoufly offended at his Remiflhels, and the little value he had teftifi'd for his Perfon before, had laid a defign to be reveng'd not only upon him, but upon all the French Nation, And this in truth was the Source and Ori ginal of that Mifunderftanding between and as well during that whole time the Grand Vizier liv'd, which was Twelve Years, as alfo during the Prime Miniftry of his Son that fucceeded him. So that the feverity of the fW toward the Three laft Ambaffadors of Haye, the Fa ther, M. de la Haye, the Son, and and the feveral Impofitions that were laid upon the for Twen ty Years together, are to be Originally attributed to a particular and Perf nal Enmity, notwithftanding all the Reafons after wards pretended, of which the Principal and jufteit were the Enterprize of Gigery, and the Succors giv'n to the and the Venetians* Nor was the Vizier long before he found an Opportunity to Thunder forth his Refentments. Such a one, as he could not have wifh'd for a better to advance his mifchievous Defign. For then was the War very hot in and had fe- cretly a {lifted the Venetians at the beginning of the War. Nay more, it is faid, that M de la H had Inftrucftions to hold a private C orrelpondence with the and to give 'em In telligence of theTurkUh Defigns. Nowit happen'd in the Year *659. that a French-Man, who went by the Name of mont, and who had a very confiderable Imployment in the net 1 an Army'j defir d leave of the to go and t feethrough the Black-Sea, an Country c^Colchis. fee Conftantinople, Prefently the gave him a Pafs, and charged him with a great Packet of Letters for the Am- baflador. But the French Man , who had no other defign then to turn TÂ«r^, apply'd himfelf to the of jiantinople, and told him, That he had quitted the Camp of the Chriftians, as being refolv'd to abjure their Religion, and embrace Mabtmat/fm ; and more, that he had a Packet of areat Importance to deliver into the Hands of the Upon which the Caimacan order'd him forthwith to be con- vey'd to Jclrianople, where the Court then lay. Nor was this perfidious Renegade, contented only to renounce his Faith, but difcover'd to the Grand Vizier the fee ret Correfpondence be tween the Ambaffador of France and the 5 and far ther told him, That the Packet of Letters which he had deli- ver'd into his Hands would Cbnvince him clearly of the Truth of what he laid. The Grand Vizier had a jealoufie of this lecret Correfpon dence before, but being no\v in a manner afiur'd in his fufpi- tions through the Dilcoveries of the it may be rea dily conje&amp;ur'd to what a degree his paffion tranfported him againft the Ambaflador of France, incens'd as he was already, and boyling with revenge, efpecially being naturally inhuman and bloody. However at this time he put a curb upon him felf, and fliew'd more referv'dnefs and moderation then could be expected from him. M. de laHaye, who well underftood Defign, and what his Errand was to the Court, and befides was well acquainted with the Grand Vizier Difpofition, hifr Implaca bility, and the Importance of the Affair, made no queflion but the Intercepted Packet would put him to a great deal of trouble and therefore he confulted with his Interpreters and his Secretaries. Immediately the Secretary for his Ciphers took fuch a fright at the Unfortunate Accident, that he re- fblv'd to march off, well knowing that the up on the like occafion of a Letter in Ciphers Intercepted, had caus'd an Interpreter to the Venetia to be Drubb'd to Death. Thereupon , addrefllng himfelf to M. Haye, faid he, J am naturally fo 'very timorous, Drnb- hing-Stich^, there is no fecret which fore feenre me, or let me mahg my Upon which the Am- baflador order'd him to be conveigh'd into a private Conceal ment, and prepar'd to abide the Shock, wliatever happen d. He then kept his Bed, very ill of the Stone, fo that he could F notThe T ray els of Sir John Ghardin Perfia, not eo to Adrianople, though he had receiv'd Orders to appear there. However he fent a Mefiage to who fenc him the Order, to tell him, That he was fick a Bed, fo that it was impoffible for him to Travel ; neverthelefs he would fend his Son in his fteadÂ« But fo it happen'd, that all the Letters which the vJier met with in the Venetian General's Packet, were writ in Ciphers 5 fo that all the Renegado's and Interpreters in the Ottoman Court were fent for in vain ; for there was not one that had a Key to the Lock: which enrag'd the Vizier fo much the more. And as for M. de la the Son, he found him in fuch an ill Humour, at his coming to that up on his returning him an Anfwer, fomewhat more boldly perhaps then the Circumftance would bear, tranfport- ed with paflion, not only caus'd him to be abus'd in his Perlbn, but fent him Prifoner to a Tower adjoyning to the Wall of the City i faying withal, That he Ambajfador's Deputy, though his with in the Amhajfador himfelf. However, the did no harm either to the Merchants or the Interpreters, that went along with M. de la Haye : nor to the Secretary or Chancellor; be ing all difcharg'd at the expence of that fear, into which he had put 'em at firft, by Threats and cruel Menaces of Tor ment and Death if they did not Decipher the General's Let ters. Only one of the Interpreters fell into fuch a Diftemper upon it, that he has continu'd fick every llnce, and 'tis thought he will never recover. The Ottoman Court was then at as I have laid, making great Preparations for the War. So that M de la Haye the Father, underftanding the Vizier was ready to march, and fearing his departure before he had en- larg'd his Son, as it really fell out, ftrovewith his Diftemper, and took a Journey to Adrianople ; to which his Daughter-in- Law perfwaded him, urging him continually, That if he did not fpeedily labour the Difcharge of his Son, he might be in danger of his Life ; and that the was cruel and incens'd; and therefore he ought to ufe his utmofl: Endeavours to pacific his Fury. A Month after the Viziers departure, the Ambafiador ven- tur d upon a bold Exploit, that delerves to be remember'd. A little before Vertamonts coming to there arrivd in the fame place a certain Man, whofe Name was Qrddet, together with his Wife, and another French Man + whofethrough the Black-Sea, and Colchis. wliofc Name was Poutet , fo enamour'd of Wife, that he never forfook her in ail her Rambles. This Qttklet was a great Interpreter of Ciphers, a Man of Learning, but of lit tle Judgment. He had alfo been employ'd to Decipher Cha- rafters by feveral Minifters of State, and divers Ambaffadors; But he was fo much a Beggar, that he could not well be poorer then he was; nor do I know what unlucky Star brought him to Conjiantinople. It is reported however, that he^havino heard of the great Rewards which the promis'd to any one that could Uncipher the Letters, the Wife of this wretched Fellow addreffing her felf to fomc Gentlemen that belong'd to Monfi gave it our, That though his Excellency refusd if he would him felf, he could ha pleas'd Vizier. I am not certain whether it were really fo, as the Thing was related to me: but however it were, la Haye s who well knew the great defire which had to underftand what was contained in the Intercepted Letters, and fearing left they fhould reveal fome Things as well to his own, as to the Ruine of all the in the he lent for the Fellow, carry'd him up to the Terrace of his Palace that lookt into the Garden; and after he had walk'd two or three Turns, holding him in a difcourfe, which what it was, no body knows, he gave a fign to fome perfons plac'd there for the purpofe, who threw him headlong over the Battlements, at what time another Gang, ported near the place where he fell, perceiving he was not dead with the Fall, finilh'd the Work, and buri'd him privately. After this, the French Ambaflador having Audience of the Grand VhJer, he fent for the Intercepted Letters, and defir'd the AmbafTador to explain 'em. To which made Anfwer, That it was well known to all the World, that the Ambafladors and JVIinifters of the Chrifiian never wrote one to another unlefs it Were in Characters, whatever the Subjedl were ; neverthelefs they did not underftand the CharaiSlers themfelves; as having their Secretaries who com- pos'd and writ the Ciphers, and then explain'd them when they had done : That as for the Perfon by him employ'd for that purpofe, he had fent him back into about fix Months ago. Yet if the Grand Vi%ier would permit him to carry the Letters home, he would try to Uncipher 'em, and if it could be done, he would be fure to let him know the Contents, But the Grand Vi%ier having heard this Anfwer, only fmil'd'The T 'ravels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, upon the Ambaffador, and fo prefently rofe from his Sear- without fpeaking fo much as one word. Some few days after the Chief Minifter departed for leaving de la Haye, the Son, in Prifon, but not fo clofely reftrain'd as before, and Monfeur de laHayc, the Father, without any manner of Anfwer. The Grand Signior did not go in Perfon to the War, but remain'd at Jdrianople, where the Ambaflador alio tarry'd, in hopes to obtain of his Highnefshis Son's Enlarge ment ; but no body durft open their Mouths to the Emperor without the Grand Vizier's order. Who having put a quick end to the Tranfylvanian Dilbrder return'd Viftorious to ftantinople. Where lb loon as he arriv'd, he was put in mind of both the Monfeeurs de la Haye. At which the faigning a kind of furprife, Jnd what, laid he. Are Jlill here? Which was as much as to lay, they tpiea/d ; as it appear'd by the difcharge of the Son, which was order'd forthwith : And lo both the one and the other re- turn'd to Conjiantimple without fo much as leeing the Vizier's Face. When it was known in France how unkindly the Vi zier had us'd Monfteur de la Haye the Cardinal difpatch'd a Gentleman to the Prime Minifter, to prevent the ill Confe- quences of Inch Proceedings. Cup whofe Malice augmen ted through defire of revenge, as one that mortally hated the two Monfienrs de la Haye, would fain have fent them back, and oblig'd the Gentleman to have tak'n upon him the Title of Ambaffador in their Room, engaging to interpole lb effedtually, that the Alteration Ihould be approv'd in But the Gentleman would not hear of that Propofition by any means, excufing himfelf fairly and genteelly. And it is moreover re ported that he highly pleas'd the Humor in all their Tranfaaing together. I am forry I know not his Name, which would have been an Honour to this Relation. The Accompt which the Gentleman gave of his Negotia tion, caus d Monjieur de la Haye to be recall'd. However there was not any one fent to fucceed him 5 only he had orders to leave in his Place, as Refident, a French Merchant, that had liv d for feveral Years in Conjiantinople, whofe Name was fieur %okeIy. Nor had France any other Minifter in thofe parts till the end of the Year 166$ The King, who had then tak'n the Government into his own Hands, and Rufd with no lefs Renown then Succefs, hadthrough the Black-Sea, and of Colchis. had already fufficiently reveng'd himfelffor the Affronts oficr'd to the Family of his Ambaflador, and for the heavy Fines and Impofitions laid upon his Subjcds in by lending now- erful Succours to the Enemies of the Empire' All which did but heighten thebadllnderftanding which was be tween the Two Empires, and Things were arriv'd to that Point, that there muft either be an abfolute Breach, or a New Alliance. The Importance of the Trade advis'd the latter; fo that the King refolv'd to fend an Ambaflador to Confiantimple to renew the Articles of Peace. Haye was then at Tans, folhciting for Imployment, and feve- ral Arrears due to him as Heir to his Father, who had been dead in that City fome years before. Now in regard he underftood better then any other Perfon, the Gains and Advantages of a Conjiantimpohtan Embaflie, together with the Splendor and Authority that belongs to it, he made great Fr ends for the Place 5 and to remove all Oppofition and Obftruaions in his way, he offer'd to quit all his Arrears to the Chief Mi- nifter. ^ Thereupon, his Friends at Court alledg'd His great Expe rience in the Affairs of Turkie ; and that his Courage and Re- folution was fuch as was requifite for an Embaffie to the man Port. On the other fide, that it was for the King's Ho nour to fend him thither, were it only to humble the Fixier, who muft now be conftrain'd to honour that very Per fon, whom his Father had abusd and hated 5 JVIeaning Mahamed Pacha, who dy'd in the Year after' he had fetl'd his Son in his Room. Nor can I tell how this Counfel, as bad as it was, came to be embrac'd, unlefs it were in profe- cution of that Defign which the Court always had to bring the Turl^sto a Compliance by force. The Evefnt of Affairs will Ihew that there was fomething of that Nature in the Ma nagement of this Bufmefs. _ Monfieur de la Haye arriv'd at in the Month of 'Kovember 166^. He alfo made a Magnificent Entry, and behav d himfelf for five Years together that he continu'd Am baflador, with as much State as could be expected trom a Re- lolute Minifter, and one that bore the Character of an Am-t baflador from a Potent and Formidable Prince. He ditcours'd of nothing in the Vifits that he made to the Minifters of the Divan but of the Grandeur of the King his Mailer, and the Invincible Strength of his Armies. This offended the extreamly, who lookt upon it as an Affront done to him, and G theThe Trawls of Sir John Cfiardin Peril a, rfie Grand Signior, even in his own Court; and this Forcftail- fnent of his Honour, caus d him to treat the Ambaffador with difdain and contempt. So that when he gave him Audience, he receiv a him with that pride and (corn which was utifuffe- rable, not vouchfafing fo much as to look upon him, or to rife from his Seat according to the ancient Cuftom, and the uftral praciicc at the Reception of Ambailadors either from the Em peror or any other Crowned Heads. And not content with that, he upbraided him in bitter Language, with the Succours which France had fent into Hungary and the Enter- prife of Gigery. Monfteur de la diifembl'd his R efenntient, believing that when he rook his leave, the would fliew him more Civility : but he was deceiv'd; for the dif- mifs'd him with the fame Indifferency, wherewith he had re- ceiv'd him. The Ambaffador refiefting upon the Afflont, which the Vi- %ier had done him at that Audience, fent to him to demand another, upon Condition that he fhould receive him Handing, and forbear any farther Reproaches. The who is the High-Chancellor of the Empire, and the Vi%iers or Chief Controller of his Houfltold, anfwer'd the Interpreter, That he might affure his Mailer, the would receive him, as became him. Thereupon the Ambaffador relying upon a promife, that indeed carry'd with it a manifeft Equivo cation, went to his Audience, but his Reception was nothing different from what it was before. Which difgufted de la Haye to that degree, that he told the That the Emperof of France hzx'mg fent him to the to Confirm the League of Arnity between the two Princes, he would not take the Audience which he had giv'n him for an Audience, becaufe he had not paid him thofe Honours which were due to the Ambaflador of the Greateft and moll Potent Monarch in Cbnflcndom. Moreover he declar'd. That he had Order to give him up the Articles of Peace, and return into in the fame Veffel that had brought him, if he did not treat him an- fwerably to the Grandeur of his Mailer. Which fo incens'd the Fitter, that he fell into a paffion, and vented his Choler in reviling and reproachful terms. On the other lide, the Ambaflador was fo highly provok'd , that fnatching the Arti cles oi Peace our ot the Interpreters Hands, he threw 'em at the Knees of the Haughty Minifter, and riling from his Seat, flung out of the Room without fpeaking a word, or vouch fafing to tarry for an Aniwer. But he was ftopp'd at the Door ofthrough the Black'Sea, and Colchis; of the Anti-Chamber ; at what time the fent for the Mufti, Vam Ejjtndi the Grand Tutor, and the Cap tain 'Bafha,to deliberate what was to be done in an Accident of fuch Importance as this. The Refult Was, That they fhould inform the Grand Signior, who was then gone a Hunt ing Twenty Leagues from Conjiant ; which was the Rea- fon that the Anfwer was delay'd for three days, during all which time, Monfieur de la. Haye lay under Confinement in an Apartment of the Grand Signiors Palace. In the mean while the Captain brought a MefTage in the Viziers Name, That if the AmbalTador would Kifs his Gar ment, he would receive him as he had receiv'd Count Ambaflador from his Imperial Majefty ; that he would alfo re ceive him ftanding, and pay him all thofe Honours which he had paid to that Count. To which the Ambaflador anfwer'd, That he was not to be govern d by Prefidents of any Perfon, when they were prejudicial to the Honour of the Emperor of France. The Captain Bajha demanded what he could object againft the Example of Count rvhofs w.u Emperor of Seven Kjngs ? a Title which the Emperor affumes among the Turks,as being Elected by Seven Eleftors. At length, after many Difpuces on both fides, and that the Grand Signior had given his Anfwer, it was concluded between the VtTjier and the AmbaiTador, That he might return to his Lodg ing when he pleas'd, that the two Audiences which he had receiv'd fhould ftand for nothing, and that he would grant him another with all the Cuftomarv Civilities and Cere- J monies. This Audience was giv'n him in the Month At what time, the Grand Vizier, becauie he would not be oblig'd to rife when the AmbalTador was introdue'd, order'd him to be brought into a particular Room of State, whither he came to meet him. At his firft Entrance he demean'd Kim- felf with an extraordinary Civility, approaching the Ambaf- fador with a fmiiing Countenance, and reaching forth his Hand. On the other fide, Monfteur de la Haye- who was glad to fee fuch a Compliance, anfwer'd his Givilicies and Com pliments with all fuitable Decency, as if he had never ieen him before; and the Audience ended with all the Courtefie and Decorum that could be expelled on borh fides: The Am- bafiador and his Retinue being Treated with Perfumes, Coffee, Sorbet, and Four and Twenty Turkifh Vefts. The next Month he had Audience of his Highnefs, where every thing Was ma-The Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, nag-d according to the ufual Cuftom with all Civility; it not being proper to difcourfe of Bufinefs to the Grand ' 'Uonfmtr de la Baye had Orders to demand the renewing the former Articles of Peace, and Liberty of Trading to the Eaft-lndtes through the Red-Sea, But the Vi^ter would not confent either to the one or the other, upon the Conditi ons that were propounded - and in he itft Conjlantinopley and attended the Grand Siguier to Jdrianople, from whence he departed for Candy. At the fame time alfo Haye follow'd the Court to Adrianople^ where he bad feveral Conferences with the Caimacan in reference to his Negotiation but in regard that Minifter durft not conclude any thing with out confulting the Fizier, Monfi return'd to Confiantinople , having made no farther progrefs in his Bu finefs. Soon after happen'd the Treaty already fpok'n of, which put the whole Affair into an abfolute Confufion, and exafperated both Parties. For on the one fide, the were entertain'd notwithftanding the Proteftations and Threats of the Ambaflador, and on the other fide, the Ambaffador, in his Complaints and Protefls, made ufe of Expreffions that offended the Turkifh Minifters. They had written to him, as I have already related, That tvas Kj-ng Majier to oppofe the Reception of an Grand Signior was pleas'd to fa that it was fufpeient for his Maj Ottoman Court, for the fir ft Chriflendom. To which Monfteur de la Haye made Anfwer, That concern d his High Titles, the E France was holding to God and his ViStorious Which was tak'n very ill, as being the fame Titles which the affumes to himfelfj and which the Turkftbelieve to be only due to his Highnefs. And therefore the Minifters fignifi'd to Monfieur de la Haye, That never any Amb Titles before; neither was it a low'd by the Divan, to any other whaifoever. In the mean time the French fent very confiderable Succours to Can dy, which much retarded the Conqueft of the Ifland, while the Tnrlyr on the other fide opprefs'd the French Merchants with new Impofitions and Extortions. In fb much that their Complaints, which grew louder and louder every day, oblig'd the King to fend exprefs Order to la Haye, re- t turnthrough the Black -Sea, and Colchis. turn to France, and lay afide all thoughts of renewing the League, at leaft if it were not a Thing firft fought and defir'd by the Minifters of the Tort. Which Orders were deliverd to him toward the end of the Year i not a little to his dif- fatisfaftion. However he did not forbear to Vifit the Caima- can at Conjiantinople, telling him that he had receiv'd Orders from the King his Mafter to return homei to which purpofe he expeÂ£led the Arrival of the Veffels which his Majefty had fent, and his leave of thefW, in order to his Departure; re- quefting him withal to write to the Court, that he might be fent for withal Expedition. The Court was then at Lariffa in Theffaly, whither his High- nefs was gone, to the end that being fomewhat the nearer to Candy, he might be a means to haften theConqueft. And therefore, before the Caimacan^ who is as it were the Fiber's Lieutenant, would write, he demanded of Monfieur de la Haye, Whether any other Ambaffador came in his Room ? To which he anfwer'd, Not any i but that the Emperor his Mafter had commanded him to leave a or a Merchant for his Reddent, like the Reprefentatives of landers and Genoefes. The Caim ask'd him, Wherefore no Ambaffador was fent ? To which the other reply'd, itnws not a Thing which he could puhlick; By which Anfwer the Caimacan apprehending that he had fomething of fecrefie to impart to him, gave him a private Audience. And then it was that the Amballador difcover'd to him, the reafons which oblig'd the Emperor of F to recal him, with a Re- folution never to fend any more Amballadors to the j 'Part. Firft, for that the Dignity of the Amballador had not been regarded nor refpedted as it ought to be. . That no heed had been given neither to the Complaints nor Requefts which his Majefty had made for three Years together. That they refus'd to renew the Capitulations of Peace, which was an unlufferable Damage to the Merchants, who were conftrain'd to pay Five i'the Hundred Cuftoms, whereas the Englifh, Hollanders and Genoefes paid not above Three dent. That they had entertain'd the latter in Turkje, contrary to all his Remonftrances and Protefts, and had fore'd the French to pay within lefs then three Years, above Two Hun dred Thoufand Livres, for unjuft and opprefllve Impofitions. To which Monfieur de la tiaye farther added, That if thefe Grievances might be taken into Confideration, fo that the Emperor his Mafter might be allur'd of Redvefs, he did not H queftionThe Travels of Sir John Chard m Perfia, queftion but that his Majefty would reft fatisfi'd and not rccal him. Upon this the Caimacan made anlwer, That he would write to the Caimacan of the Port, who is alio another of the Voters Lieutenants, and one who never ftirs from the Perfon of the Grand Signior and alfo that his Excellency would do Well to write himfelf, which would add the greater weightj and give the Quicker difpatch to the Affair. Neverthelefs all the Anfwer which the Caimacan of the fent to de la Baye, was only this, That he would give an Accompt to the Grand Vi%ier of what he had writ, and that he ihould know his Anfwer with the firft Opportunity. While the Amblffador tarry'd for this Anfwer, Four of the Kings Men of War arriv'd in the Haven of fent to bring back the Ambalfador. And this Squadron (truck no fmall fear into the Turk? at firft ; but finding that Monfmir d 'Almras, who was the Commander, had fent to the City, fo foon as he came to an Anchor, for Fifteen Hundred Weight of Bisket, and that with no fmall Importunity too, they began to flight him under the Want of Provifion, and redlic'd to luch a Condition that he could not fubfift, if they iliould refufe to fupply him. In March i66p.Monfiettr de receiv'd the Grand Vizier's Anfwer, containing a Permiffion to come to the Court; where he arriv'd in the Month of Jpril. And here I (hall pafs over the Motives and Defign of this Journey, not but that I fufficiently know what was difcours'd at ; but becaufe thofe Difcourfes were different from what Mon- Jiewr de la Haye fets down in the Relation which he gave the King at his Return to Paris â€¢, from whence I took the chiefefi: part of this Recital iand where he declares that he had no other end but to take his leave. Nor fliall I fay any thing for the fame Reafon, of what he did at the from whence he wrote to Admiral d'Aimer as, who then lay at Con- flaniinople with his Four Men of War tocome and take aboard him at Vola, in the Golph of Salonica, a Turkifli Ambaffadcr, which the Grand Signior was fending into This Turk^ was nam'd Seliman, being then Jga, Of the Grand Signior s Porter. And when he Was fent to the French King, he was a Fellow that ferv'd for Fifteen or about Six-pence a day. He arriv d in toward the end of the Year 1669. and departed thence the next Year in the Month of Jugujh All Tam had a fight of him, and they that Were acquainted w# him, knew him to be as haughty, + asthrough'the Black Sea. and the Country of Colchis i as brutiili, and as crafty a Turi^ as ever was in the World, the FrovencjIIs that were in the Levant call'd him Monfieur It Hayes Ambaflador, and took the Liberty to affirm that fieitr de la Haye furnifli'd him with Money for his Equipaoe. And they grounded their Aflertion upon this, That Solman\ tquipage was far fhort of the Magnificence of the Turkifli AmbaiTadors. And Monjieur d when he was jecr'd for Soli man's Rigging, had no other way to juftifie himfelf but by faying, That Soliman had not time to make better Provifion for himfelf. Others would put it clofer Upon hint That the Title of AMBASSAD was ndt to be ? found in Soliman s Credentials. But for that he had another fhift, That while Soliman lay at Cale Nicolas near rigo, expeding the Aduiiirars arrival to take hini aboard, the Grand Vizier , fecure of taking , and finding nd farther neceflity to keep fair with , or dread their Af- fiftance , alter'd all Soliman s Titles, Inftruftions and Dif- patches 5 recalling the firft, and fending him others: But that it was moft certain, that the Name and Title of man Aga were beftow'd upon him in theQuality of an Ambafla- dor i of which there needed no farther proof then this, That the Great Turk gave him the Scimitar, and Veftnaent which he gives to his Ambafladors, arid that the Fortrefs of Napoli in Romania fainted him with feveral Guns at his entrance into the Haven. However it were, Monfieur rcturn'd to tinople in July, and three Months after he receiv'd Order to embark, if he could, aboard the Fleet Under the Command of Monfteur d'Jlmeras 5 but if the Caimacan prevented him, that at the fame Inftant he fliould lay down the Title of Ambajjador, to the end the Tu might not have the Op portunity to Glory that they had in their Power an Ambafla- dor of France to abufe at their pleafure. But as I faid be fore, the Men of War were gone befote this Order arriv'd fb that Monfieur de la Haye could not obey the firft part of the Order ; and as to the fecond, he excus'd himfelf, wri ting into France, That the Turks had a great Veneration and Refpeit for him. But this excufe not being fo throughly acceptable at Court, Was the Occafion that Monjieur was peremptorily recall'd. Befides the Trovengals, were fo incens'd againft him, that they fent continually into clamouring that fo long as he ftjould be continu'd Ambafikdor at the the league 17 I ^The Trawls of Sir John Charciin Perfm, Lcaoue would never be renew'd, neither would the Paffagefo the Indies through the (ftecl-Sea be obtain d j in regard the zier had an old Grudge againft his Perfon.

Monficttr Nointel therefore departed out of in the Month of Aitgufi 1 670, together with the Turkifh Ambafla dor, Solman Aga, and arriv'd at in follow ing; the King allowing him four Men of War for the fecuri- ty of his Paflage under the Conduft of M By the way I have heard feveral Perfons of great Sagacity and Judgment affirm, thatM cfe la had wrong done him r and that they were deceiv'd who vainly imagin'd that it was either out of dilrefpedt to his Perfbn, or for want of Good Management, that the Turks refus'd to renew the League at his Sollicitations. Which the Sequel of Affairs has juflifi'd for Truth, plainly demonftrating that the Blame was to be laid upon the 111 timing the Embafly, and the Potent Succors which the King of France fent to at the very Inftant when he had lent his Ambaflador to defire confiderable Fa vours and particular Advantages of the ' M. Nointel made a Magnificent Entry into ; but the Turks were nothing pleas'd with fo much Pomp, al together unfeafonablc, and no way agreeable to the Circum- ftances of Time and Bufinefs. The Court was then at Adrianople, where Monfieur With little difficulty obtaind leave to depart, and to that purpofe embark'd himfejf in the Admiral of the Squadron, Commanded by M Butthrough the Black-Sea, and of Colchis. But foon afcer both the Admiral and the reft of the Squadron were Imbargo'd before the Caftle by reafon of two Slaves that had made their efcapes, as was fuppos'd, into the French Ships. There were it feems about an Hunderd in all, who had broke their Chains, of all forts of Nations â€¢, of which Number was the Chevalier de 'B who had been a Pri- foner in the Seven Towers. The fent to demand the Slaves of M. Nointel, and M. 'Roin went to demand 'em of the Captains of the Men of War, who anfwer'd. That there were none fuch in any of their Veflels: and was forc'd to write from the Vardanels the Vi%ier to attcft the fame under his own Hand ^ who feeraing to be fatisfi'd with h s anfwer, fent an Order to let the VefTels go. Sometime after the departure of M. Haye, M. went to Adrianople. Where he had all the ufual Honours duly paid him but demanded Audience before he had made known the Subjed: of his Negotiation at the which he fhould have declafd before-hand. For it is the Law in Tur- kie y That all Ambalfadors before they fee the Face of the Prime Minifter, or of the Grand fliould fignifie the Occafion of their Coming, what their Demands are, and what it is that they have in Commiffion to Treat about. And the fame Law is obferv'd over all the Of which M. was not ignorant. But he found it in his Inftrudions, That he fhould Negotiate his Affairs in Perfon with the Vi- %ier, and that he Ihould not difdofe the Kings Orders but in a full Divan, when he might alio fpeak to the Grand himfelf. Which was therefore lb relolv'd upon in the Kings Council, becaufe it was faid in That his Highnefs knew nothing of the Severities of the Vizier toward the French Nation ; no more then did the That the Haughty Minifter refus'd to renew the Treaty of Alliance up on the Kings Conditions, out of a particular hatred which he bore the French, and therefore it behov'd him to get himfelf out of his Clutches, and free himfclf from any Dependance upon his Abfolute Authority. But it is a Failing predominant in all the Courts of Europe, that they take falfe Mealures as to the Affairs of Turkey : a certain fign that the and Politicks of the Turt^sare not as yet rightly underftood. How ever molt afluredly thefe Counfcls were ill gn'en, and worfe follow'd. For M. Nointel did all he could to obferve his Or ders, fometimes he would difclofe nothing at all then again he was for dilcovering part of his Commiffion : bur finding I beT/v 'Trawls of Sir John Chardin into Perils he could not obtain Audience, he was forc'd to unbofom him- felf, and to fend a Memorial of all the Demands which he had to make at the Ottoman 'Port. This Memorial he gave to the Interpreter, whofe Name was Tanaiotij a Grecian, and a Man of a piercing Wk, who underftood leveral of the Europe Languages; and among the reft Latin and Italian, which he writ as well as fpcke with great Judgment and Dexterity. He was a Perfon uncaintedly faithful to the GrandVi%,ier, and it appear'd that he was intire- ly devoted to the Interefis of the to the prejudice of the Chriftians. Which firmnels of his, whether it proceeded from a dread of theTurkifh Severity in the punifhment of Treafon and Treachery, or the Obligations of his Birth, or the Influ ences of Turkifli Slavery, I will not here difpute ; however it be, he bears the Title of Chief and of the Ottoman Empire. The Commonwealth of alio made him a Noble-Man of that City for the good Offices he did their AmbalTador the Marquifs of He was Inter preter to the Emperor of Germany, before he ferv'd the who allow'd him a Penfion of a Thoufand Crowns, which as fome fay is ftill privately paid him. And moreover he had the chief Management of the Treaty of Peace between the two Empires, which was not fo honourable for He alfo carry'd on the Treaty of Candy wherein he afted fo much to the Satisfaction of the Grand that at the time of the Ratification he gave him the Revenue of the Ifland of in the Archipelago, worth Four Thoufand Crowns a Year. I have been the longer in giving an Accompt of this becaufe he is a Perfon fo well known to all that have Bufinefs at the Port : as being the only Man that Treats in the behalf with all Chriftians that make their Addrefles to him, of what Quality foever, and whatfbever their Bufinefs maV be. 7 The Ambaffadors Demands were comprehended under Thir ty Articles, of which thefe were the chief. Firft, That the Grand Signior fhould Dominions any European Nation, there, but under the French 'Banne; Italians, except the Venetians Genoefcs, jhould into Turkey, [hould be obligd t ner of France, and thefroteSiion Ambaffador. â€¢ t Thisthrough the Black-Sea, and 0/Colchis. â– ?r This Pnviledge was granted by the to the Â¥rmch in tie Capitulations made in the Reign of the Firft and the French enjoy d em till the beginning of this Age ; at'what time by reafon of certain Pyrates that Cruis'd upon the Coafi: of Egypt under French Colours, the ftruck out that Article m a new Agreement then concluded. Afterwards the Article Ttheft words' P ' mledee gr:,nted a fcond tiM All Nations of Europe, that at the Port mr are in Alliance a with ^ Grand Sigmor, which flail come into Levant under jhall be there merv-d and entertain^ vantages which the French do. But the refufe to acknow ledge thefe latter Capitulations; and therefore making ufe of the former, they alledge moreover, That the words f M com ] are not exclulive 5 and therefore though the Port be obligd to receive all Strangers that (hall under French Colours, yet they do not debar the Grand to entertain strangers, if it be his Pleafure, that come under other Co- lours. Secondly That the French fhall Hunderd Cuftoms, which k no m Englifli, Hollan- ders 5 ana Genoefes do. , T h,rd ^ That the Grznd Signior /hall the French to Traffick to the Indies, lerntortes,more efpecially through th Red-Sea mthout paying any other Duties t thofe Fourthly, That the Grand Signior reftore giom Orders of the (Roman Catholic^ Holy Land, and the Holy Places from whence they wer Greeks Tear 1^38. Fifthly, That the King of France jhall achgiorvleclgd Port, the Sole &lt;ProteSior of the Chrijiian^ Sixthly, That all the (Roman Chriftians within the Dominions of the Ottoman Empire, on andconfeder'd as under the TroteSlmt Â£ t SeVenthly;~q I h^f^oels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, 9eventhly, That the French Con- ftantinople, way have Liberty to (Rebuild Ga- lata, which was burnt down about Eighthly, That all the Churches 'Roman Chrijiians in the Ottoman Empire, may for built, as often as need frail require Trouble of atfyng Leave. Ninthly, That all the French Slaves frail The other Propofals were of le(s Importance in particular, only their Number render'd 'em confiderable. But the look'd upon thefe Demands to be fo extravagant, nay fo ridi culous, that the Prime Minifters believ'd, or elf&amp; pretended to believe, that the King fought only an Occafion to break with his Highnefs. Thereupon the fent to know of the Ambaflador, Whether he had any Letter from the Emperor of France directed to the Grand or Him, which con- tain'd thofe Propofals, fet down in the Memorial which he had deliver'd in his Majefties Name. For that he could ne ver think the Emperor of France would ever give Order to make fuch Propofals to the (port,fo exorbitant, and fo remote fromReafon and Juftice in his Own Name, unlefs he faw em exprefly written in any Letter under his Majefties Hand. M. de Nointel taking no farther notice of the Demand, return'd only for anfwer, That he had Letters of Credence from his Mafter for the Grand and the Vi%ier y which was fufficient, for that his Majefty did not ufe to write about Bufinefs himfelf. And therefore that the was un der a miftake to queftion the Mind and Intentions of the Em peror of France, becaufe it was not Ihown in Writing under his Majefties Hand. True it is, that the Amballador fpoke Reafon, and the Impediment pretended by the was only a Litigious Nicety. However, notwithftanding all that M. de Nointel could fay or alledge to the contrary, he would not grant him Audience, till he promis'd and engag d to fend for a Letter from the King that fliould contain precifely the fame things that were fet down in his Memorial, and that the Letter fhould come in fix Months. It was toward the end of Febri6yi- that ISLointel made this promife : and the next day the lent to . â€¢ him, *through the Blade-Sea, md ^Colchis. 1 1 1 r â€”&gt;â€”â€” â–  him, ro let him know that oh the Morrow he fliould have Au dience ofhimfelf, and that two days after he ftould have Au- dience of the Grand Signior like w ife, upon condition that he would Hot difcourfe of any Bufinefs True it is, the gave him but a cold Reception. For the Ambaffador entring into difc urfe Upon feveral Subjefts, which were all too long and tedious for the Turkifh Humour, they went in at one Ear and out at the t'other ; The for the moft part givina him no other Anfwer but only a fliort or as brief a Particularly MonfieHr ISLointel enlarg'd upOn the Grandeur of the King, and his vaft Forces: which the taking to be a kind offecret Threatning, fiid he, 0/France is a Gredl Mbndrch, but his Sword new Weapon In timating that the King had done no Exploits that deferv'd fuch loud Elogies ; but therein he was hot well inform'd of what had pafs'd among the Chriftian Princes. Neither did Nointel efcape fome other Quips of the fame Nature. For the Ambaflador talking of the Antiquity of the Alliance between France and Turkey, was faying, French Turks true Friends, To which the Vizier fmiling, Ay, laid he, French are our Friends indeed^ bu we 'em bur Enemies. But the next was more home and fiiarp. The Ambaflador being ready to take his leave, order'd the Interpreter to tell the Vtrier. Th peror hisMafter, earnejlly to recommen of Red-Sea. That it nw a Thing Bean upon, and defer d the Port would in that P articular with all Expedition To whom the Virier drily, Can it be, laid He, That your Emp m yoti fay he is, fhould fet his Heartfo affeBionately upon his Merchants P Nor was the Ambaflador better fatisfy'd with the Audi ence which he had of the Grand For after he had made his Reverence, they led him up to the end of the Room of State, Face to Face to his Highnefs, to whom he made his Harangue, which lalted about a quarter of an Hour, But it ffgnify'd little. For the Interpreter explain'd no more then the Senle of it to the Tidier,which the abbrevia ted in two words to the GrandSignidr. Which done, AÂ£ Nointel began to difcourfe of Bufinefs to his Highnefs j con- trary to Cuftom, to the Viziers Requeft , and his Own Pro- tnife. The Grand Signior liften'd attentively to what the In~ ierpreter faidj and for anfwer, looking upon the whdThe Travels of Sir John Chard in into Perfia, npon fuch Occafions is always near the Perfon, This Ambajfador, laid he, addrejfcs himfelf to our Lata. Which word Lala fignifies both a Tutor , and a The Turl ^r made ufe of the word, to denote a Perfon who has a particular Care and paternal affcdion for another. Then again, it is the Cuftom, after the Ambaflador has had his Audience of the Grand for him to Dine in the Divan, where the Ambaffador fits with the Vi%ier ; and the Gentlemen of his Retinue Eat with the Bench-, who are the Greateft Lords of the Empire. There would M. deNointel be talking alfo of bufinefs. Which put the Vizier fo out of Patience, that being fore'd to be fomewhat rude with him, after he had defir'd him to be filent, Anihajfador, laid He f\eep to yopromife, Jhall underjiand whither you are F This was the firil Difappointment of and the fuccefs of his Journy to Adrian He return'd to fiantinople in March 16 /1. from whence he wrote to what he had done at the Port, and upon what Terms he ftood with the Vizier. By which it was apparent to the Court,that the Vizier did but make fport with the Ambaffador and the Upon which it was debated whether they fhouId break with the fort, or whether they IhouM diflcmble fuch an Affrontive Entertainment. And therefore that they might not proceed with too much Precipitancy in an Affair of that Importance, the Chief Prefident of Jix, M. d'Op wasorder'd to aflem- ble at Marfeilles all the Levant Merchants, and others that were verft in the Affairs of Turkey,and to take their Opinions up on what leveral People had ofter'd to the Council. France might refrain from Trading into t Levant, at federal 'Tears, and that it was eajte to do 'Dam mage T urks by Sea, that the Grand Signior (h confiraMd Majefiy his own Demands.

To which they all fent him anfwer, that it was true that the French were fetting forth a very great Fleet But whither it were defign'd againft Turkey or no, they could not tell: but the general Report, and that which they believ'd to be the true ft was,that they were intended againft the ders.

For the King defigning a War with Ho would not engage in another with Turkey at the fame time, which requir'd the beft part of his Navy to maintain. Therefore he refolv'd to fpin out time, and to endeavour an Accommodation i that fo he might not be oblig'd to break with To which purpofe Uonfieur de Lyone wrote to the feror &lt;?/' France admird he fiottld Am* bajfador, fince the Port had never quefliond and Reality of the fropofals of t French Ambaffadors. bis Imperial Majejty would not trou ing anyotherwife then by hisAmbaffador M. de Nointel: if the Grand Signior or hisMiniflers dence, they would do well to let Veffel brought the Letter. With this Letter M d'Hervieu, Interpreter to the and at prefent Conful at Aleppo, was fent, having Orders to deliver it himfelf to the Grand Vizier, and withal to carry the King's laft Inftrudtions to the Ambaffador. He fet Sail from Marfeilles in September, in one of the King's Men of War call'd the Diamond, commanded by the Marquifs â€¢Prw/Zy, but did not arrive at Conjlantinople till following, bad Weather having detain'd him Four Months between and Conjiantinople.

And this was the State of Affairs and Condition of the Al liance between France and Turkey when I arriv'd at nople in March 1672. The AmbafTador departed from the 29th of March, carry ing along with him the Abbot of his Bro ther, a Gentleman, a Confeflbr, a Steward, a Secretary, three Interpreters, two Janifaries, and of meaner Officers a com petent. Retinue. Befides all thefe, he had alfo in his Train, M. d'Hervien, who brought the Letter from M. dc to the Vt%ier one of the Direcrors of the Levant whofe Buiinefs it was to Treat about the Conditions of the tf^ed-Sea- Trade; Two Spanifli Fryers, of the Holy Land, who were to follicite the Reftitutibn of the Sacred 'Places, from whence they had been expeil'd by the Greeks by Authority from the Tort,about Thirty Years before i a Mer chant of Marfeilles, who had Bufinefs at the Port , together with Four French and Italian Gentlemen, who, as I my felf, made that Journey meerly out of Curiofity. The Caimacan alio fent a Chtaus to attend the Ambaffador, to provide hini Convenient Lodging, and to prelcrve that Refpeft to his Per- fon, and his Retinue, which the are fubjeci: to violate upon the flighteft Occafions, if not overaw'd by the dread of Punidirnent. We were Six Days upon the Road ; it being reck'nd Fifty Leagues between and Adriampie. A Road no way to be found fault with, as being very broad and level, over Plains, and a lovely Champain Country : be-, fides that we pafs'd through a great many very near Villages, accommodated with fair and handlom Inns. Welodg'd half a League from in a niofi: plea- fant Situation, upon the River call'd 'Bofna-Lyoy^ that is, the Village of the Bofneans. Ten days after our Arrival, Panaioti^ the Vmiers Interpreter, of whom we have already fpok'n, came to vifit the Ambaflador in his Mafters Name, and to know the King's Refolutions touching the renewing of the Alliance. After which Preamble to M. he told hiiri, That it was the Grand Viz Opinion, that it was not L Convenient:The Trawls of Sir John Chardin Perfia, convenient for him and the Ambaflador to have any Perfonal Interviews and IDifcourlc together, till all A flairs were con' eluded and fully agreed, for fear left any Exceptions or Diffe rences fhould happ'n between em, which though but upon flight and impertinent (pKwSfz/w s, might break or put a flop to the Negotiation, and hinder its good fuccefs. To which naioti added, as it were in Confirmation of the Fillers Judg ment, That Affairs in Turkey were never well manag'd, un- lefs it were by a Third Perfon, in regard the and the Ambaffador being equally concern'd to preferve the Honour and Interefts of two great Empires, neither of the two would be the firft that fhould forego the fmallefl Tittle of their Pre- tenfions; but that a Treaty carry'd on by their Interpreters could not eafily produce thofe unlucky Accidents either in the One or the Other. In fhort therefore, the defir'd that favour of him, that he might not give him Audience, but only to deliver into his Hands the new Articles of Peace and Agree ment. M. de Nointel could have wifh'd with all his Heart, it might have been otherwife : but there was a Neceflity of con- defcending to the Grand Vizier's Pleafure, which was to Treat by the Intercourfe of Interpreters. Thereupon took the Letter which M. de Lyonne had written to the Vizier, ^nd the Memorial of the Conditions upon which his Majefty vVas refolv'd to renew the Alliance, and no otherwife, as the Am- baffador alledg'd â€¢, and fo took his Leave, after he had made a Thoufand Vows and Proteftations to the Ambaffador of the Services he would do in that Negotiation. Particularly he told him, That he took it for fo great an Honour to have the Management of this New League between the and the Emperor of France, that there was no way or means which he would leave unftudy'd that he might bring it to a Conclufion, to the Satisfaction of his moft Chnftian Majefty. But Time difcover'd, that his Proteftations were altogether deceitful and fallacious, and that had not the fame In clinations for the Interefts of Fra as for thofe of the Vizier. Firft then, the Vizier read over the Ambaflador's Memo rial, and then gave it to be examin'd in the It was not fo long by half as that which he had prefented the time before, as not containing above Eleven Heads. Neverthelefs he found it to be very Extravagant. So that when the moft Confiiderable Articles were read, he would ftill cry. The will never grant 'em. Upon others he would pafs Sentence, + faying,through the Black-Sea^ and e/Colchis. faying, This may be granted 5 and we flull endeavour ropafi over luch an Obftacle and to remove fuch and filch Difficul ties. So that he ablbiutely refus'd one part of the Demands' and gave his Opinion of the reft but very doubtfully. Which was a piece of Policy in the G to difcover by the Ambailador's Anfwers, whether it were true that his Inftni- d:ions were not to recede in the leaft from his Memoires. And it fell out according to his defire, for by that means he found that the Ambaifador had private Orders. At the end of April, the two Fryers, Commiffiaries for the Holy Land , were very much troubl'd at a Report that ran among our felves, That they needed not to tarry, as they did in expeflation of being reftor'd to the Sacred' Places, from which the Greeks had expell'd em, for that the having declar'd, Thar he would agree to the Abatement of the Cu- ftoms, and the l^ed-Sea-Trade, on Condition the AmbalTador would not infiftupon the Holy-Land.hc had anfwer'd. That that wm a 'Point to be referv d till the Which becauie it is an Affair of much Curiofity, I fhall here fet down the principal Paffages relating to it , withal in fome meafure to divert the Reader, weary'd perhaps with a long Story of the French Negotiations at the Ottoman Tort, for the Renewing of an Al liance. The Kingdom of Jerufalem was Gonquer'd by the Chriftians in the Year 1 opp. and loft in the Year 1177, At what time a certain King of Syria whofeName was Ne^er-Salab-el-dm- Jofepb reconquer'd it, and expell d all the Weftern Chriftians, efpecially the Kjiights 5 leaving only behind the Oriental ChrU ftians, Syrians, Armenians^ Georgi and Greeks. a time after one of the Kings of Nap/es, of the Houfe of Anjou^ purchas'd of the King of Syria the Sacred Places of Talejline. However the Bargain was kept fecret, the King of Syria being afraid left the Mabumetan Princes his Neighbours, fhould re proach him for what he had done, and quarrel with Jiim about the Sale. Thereupon the Francifcan Monks were fent to take poffeffion of the Sacred Places according to the CortipaA, who continu'd there, and were confirm'd by the Solddns of E^ypt^ and the Turkifli Emperors who afterwards Conquer'd fiine. All this while the Fryers had the Keys and Poffeffion of whatever Chriftian Devotion had Conlecrated at 'Bethlehem, Nazareth, and in all other Sacred Places of the Land. Moreover, the Eaftern Chriftians j who were very tiumerous.4Â° Chafdin Perfia, i j'.. aii numerous, bad alfo their Chappels m feveral of thofe Boly Places as well in the Church built upon the Sepulchre of Chrift' as in thofe that were rear d in the Places where he was Born and Crucifi'd. The Popes likewife who make te their Bufinefs to bring over to their Communion all the Greek*, commanded the Franctfcans that they fhould have all manner of Liberty in the Holy Places, and withal to permit em to build Chappels, to keep Lamps and Tapers burning, and to ered Images and Altars. ,. . . â€ž , This Allurement of fo much Freedom, which the ioy'd in their Churches, fay the was that which entic'd 'em into a defign to make themfelves the fole Mafters of thofe Places; though the Gree moft ftiffly deny any fuch thing. However it were, in the Year 1634. the repair'd to the Port, and there producd feveral Ancient Records, fetting forth their Title to the poffeffion of Mount Calvary, the Grotto of Bethlehem, and other Places. Thereupon the were cited to the Divan ; who appear'd with the Ambaffadors of the Chriftian Printes that were then refident at the and the Caufe was feveral times argu'd before the &lt;Prme All the Chriftians alfo who were in Alliance with the as well Proteftants as Roman Catholicks, interefted themfelves in the Suit; and both fides were at extraordinary Expences. But at length the Greeks gain'd the Catife, and were put into pof feffion of the Holy Places, according to their own defires. The Grand Vizier , who gave Judgment in favour of the Greeks, being dead at the end of two Years, the demanded a Rehearing of the Caufe. Which Was granted^ and it went clearly for the Franc who were thereupon reftor'd to the poffeflion of what the Greek/ got from 'em, but they did not keep it above two Years more. For after that, another Grand Vi%ier, more favourable to the refetld 'em again in all the Places which had been recover'd by the Francifcans four Years before. After that, the us'd great Endeavours to regain the Pofleflion, but all to no pur- pole, the Divan being ftill deaf to all their Sollicitations, Pro- mifes and Offers; and conftantly alledging, That it was not juft, that the Greeks, who were the Subjects, and who paid him the yearly Tribute of Eight Hunderd Thou- fand Crowns, fhould be depriv'd their fhare of the Cuftody of the Sacred Places in falefiine, Which wa:s part of the Demeafns of the Ottoman Empire. Yet for all that, the have f notthrmgh the Black-Seaj and th Country 0/Colchis. 41 not forborn to renew their Importunities-, their Petitions, and their Offers of Money,' as often as they found any feafonable Opportunities to do it. In the Year 1665. Lejley in the Name of the Emperor took all the care and pains imaginable for the Reftoration of the Franc if cans to their Rights, pray'd, pay'd and promis'd Mountains, but all was labour loft. Four Years after, the (procurator Molino in the Name of the Republic of Venice undertook their Caufe with the fame Vigour; fo that the Francifcans had now no other hopes but in the King of France. To which purpofe they deputed two of their Order to his Majcfty, who prefented him with Letters of Recom mendation from Howe, Spain, and the moft part of the Ro man Catholick Princes, to make ufe of his Credit and Reputa tion in the Ottoman Court, for the Reftoration of the into the Sacred Places, from whence they had been expell'd by the Greeks. But there was no need of a Recommendation to excite the King in the profecution of fuch a Pious Att, to which his own Zeal was a fufficient Incentive* Immediately therefore he wrote to M. de U to iniert the Demands of thofe Religious Perlons among the Conditions for the renew ing the Alliance. And after that, both M de la Haye y and M. de Nointel protefted to 'em feveral times, That they had ex- prefs Orders not to Treat with the nor to renew the Ar^ tides of Alliance., unlefs they would reftore the Fcancijcans to the Places they had loft. Neverthelels it appear'd at the end of April, that an Affair of that Nature might be difpenc'd with al, rather then to put a ftop to fuch an Important Treaty for the Cuftody of three or four filly Chappels. Thefe two Fryers told me, how that upon their Arrival at Conjlantinople,M. de laHayc bid 'em reft fatisfi'd ; for that he underftood fo well the Relblutions of the Prime Minifters of the 'Port, that they would never renew the Treaty, upon the Conditions which the King demanded, in regard the Reftora tion of the Sacred 'Places, upon which the King fo firmly in- fifted, was an Article the Tort would never grant. To which, as they inform'd me, they return'd this Anlwet, which inclu ded good Advice indeed for the fuccefs of their own Intercft. If your Excellency, faid they, hpofitive Re ference to the Kefloratioli, and th Port mil confent to itjiiahg no other Demand Grand Vizier be concerted; and declare withal to Minijier, not Treat, till he bo's promised to Greeks tak^n from Mi If your Excellencyobferve M 'The T 'ravels of Sir John Chard in Perfia, the Vizier rvill grant or deny. dinient to the renewing of the Trea re- fnfe, the (Rupture will redound to France'x Me will appear not to have fought Europe will admire his Majefiies fiety an i Verfon hutvmji be fared to acknowledge l^efpeB ^e- Union veds the onlycaufe that Turks. The well-meaning Fathers told me this Story with an extra ordinary Vehemence, which is ufual among Monks. For they believ d it to be one of the moft Noble AÂ£Hons in the World to enter into a War with the Ouoma/i Empire, to force the Great Tur\ to take from the Chriftians of his own proper Subjefts, the Guftody of five or fix petty Chur ches, and beftow it upon Foreign Monks, who not content to make ufe of 'em when they pleas'd, would have the Keys hung at their Girdles. About Mid-May M. de Mointel finding that Sign tor and Vizier were ready to depart for and that there was but little Progrefs made in his Negotiation, went to vifit the ^eifquitab, or Lord Ghancellor : With whom he had three Gonferences, before they could conclude the Treaty. But at the third Gonference, which was upon the of all things were agreed and fetl'd, and the Alliance was renew'd upon the following Conditions. That the French for the future per Gene. Cnjioms. That they fhould have the R,ed-Sea Indies, paying Five per Gent. Cu their Entrance into the Grand Signior'j- farther payments either for their faff age, That the French Capuchins St, George at Galata, burnt down fame Church, together with the Jefuits Appurtenances belonging to the French within Ottoman pire, fbotdd be under the TroteSlion That the Ambaffador jhould h Trot eel or Hofpital of the European Chriftians Galata, fhould have Liberty to fayMafs itiorougiotue Ulack-Sea, and th o/Coichis. 4 3 ihdt au the French Captives that were Turkey, happen to be fallen for the future,fhould vided they were not taken in any Fl Places in Hofiility with the Port. 7 And this was all that was to be chang'd or added in the New Capitulations ; for the Article concerning Foreign Nati- ons was to continue as it was before in the former Treaty. When all things were accepted and mutually agreed, the Ambaffador of France's eldeft Interpreter fpoke to Nointel, that he Ihould not ftir till the Chancellor had made out a Draught of the New Capitulations. Which advice was well giv'n, but the Ambaflador gave more Credit to Panaioti the Grand Vizier's Interpreter, who told him, it would be an Affront to the Chancellor, to diftruft what he deliverd by word of Mouth, by asking him for a Draught in Writing; and that he would engage his Word, and be Security for the performance of what the Chancellor had declar'd. Upon which the Ambaffador fuffer'd himfelf to be over-rul'd j and return'd to his Lodging extreamly joyful and well fatisfi'd, and with all the Chearfulnefs and Gaiety in his Countenance which generally difplays it felf upon the good fuccefs of Biifinefs. Infomuch that fitting down at Table, faid he, the Capitulations are renew d', let to this Renovation of the League. Now the Chancellor had promjs'd to fend a Copy of the Draught in the Evening, to the ehd it might be examiivd, and afterward writtn out fair ; but he fail'd in his promile, nor was the Ambaffador troubl d in the leaft. The next Morn ing however he fent for it: but he was ftrangely lurpriz'd, to find that the Article about Foreign Nations did not oblige, as it ihould have done, all thofe that were under no fettlement already at the Tort, to put themfelves under the Banners and Colours of France. Then Monfettr began to mi- ftruft that he had been deluded. At laff he fell into a Paffion, and prefently call d for his fecond Interpreter, to go and tell the Chancellor, That if that Article were not put down as he Underftood it, he would not accept the New Capitulations. Which his chief Interpreter oblerving, ftepp'd in, and adviz'd him to be wary how he enhanc'd the price as he was going; to do, that it was not fafe to put the Market into the Turks Hands, \ asThe Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfiaj as he did ; and therefore defir'd him to take care how he en- gag'd hitnfelf in a heat to break with the for a Tingle Ai- ticle of little Importance. But fuch was de Impa tience, that he bid the Meffenger go forthwith, and carry his Meflage to the Chancellor; who anfwer'd, That he would report it to the Vizier. The 29th the Ambaflador went to the Chancellor's Houfc 5 who told him, 'That it became not to demand of thd ' Tort a thing which was not in their Power to grant: For that ' the Grand Signior had engag'd to the Englijh, the V ' the Hollanders and Genoefes, That all Strangers that fhould ' come into Turkey, under their Colours, fhould be welcom, ' whoever they were j fllould enjoy the fame Priviledges, and ' in a word be entertain'd as their Friends were. That having ' alfo granted the fame Priviledges to the Emperor,particularly ' for the Imperial Hans-Towns, for the Subjefts of theHoufeof ' Anjtna and the Italians, his Highnefs could not without vio- 'Jating his Faith, grant to the what they demanded; ' that is to fay, That he fhould admit no Foreigners but what 4 came under the French Colours, unlefs they were fuch as had ' their Eftablifhments already confirm'd at the To which ' the dwace/Zw added. That what he had reprefented to his ' Excellency was notorioufly publick, and a moft convincing 4 Argument, and therefore beibught him not to infift any fur- 1 ther upon that Article. To which Nointel reply'd with a Proteft not to renew, unlels that Article were granted in the fame form as he demanded. The return'd, That he would report his Proteft to the and then he fhould know his Anfwer. The AmbafTador told him, He fhould think himfelf highly oblig d, lo that his Conveniency would permit him, if he would be pleas'd but to go immediately and fpeak to the Vi%ier, while he ftaid for his coming back- The Chancellor confented ; went, fpoke to the and re turn'd with this Anfwer. ' The Grand Vizier has order'd me to tell your Excellency, c That you made him promile ye about a Month fince, That ' provided the Tortfliould grant the Emperor of an 'Abatement of the Cuftoms, and a Free Trade through the 1 tf^ed-Sea^he would be contented, as to what remain'd, with ' what was reafonable and juft. That upon that word he had ' granted in the Grand Signior s Name thole two Articles, and ' other Favours which you know ; but now lecing you have ' notihmigh the Black^Sea^ and Country 0/Colchis* ' not kept your wwd- with liim, he declares exprefly: Tb7 'he recalls his own, and will grant you nothing at all This Anfwer was like a Thunderclap. Kointel and thole that were with him flood like Men in a Trance They begg d to refume, and ratifie the Treaty, but it was impofli ble, though they profFer'd upon the place to quit and re- nounce the Article contefted. To which the Chancellor am fwer'd. That he had no other Orders from the then to deliver his Meflage, and that he had no Power to Treat any f rther. The Ambaffador reply'd, That he had a Letter from the TrimeMinipr of Fran which he defir'd only to deliver into his Hands^ and fo to take his leave. The Chan cellor made Anf^er, That for his Audience it might be eafily obtain'd, but as for the Letter from the Prime of France, the Grand Vizier car'd not a Straw to look upon it. Monfieur deNointel returning to his Lodging with that vexa* tion and perplexity of Mind which may be'Conceiv'd with out any great difficulty, propounded to his Council, which were the Abbot his Brother, the Diredor of the Levant pany, and his two chief Interpreters, That lince the and Hollanders had lately given Ten Thoufand Pounds Ster ling apiece, far renewing their laft Capitulations, it would be convenient for the French to give the fame Money for the renewing ol 1 heirs. Upon which the two Interpreters had order to propofe the Sum to the Chief Minifters: but it no thing avail'd. For there are fome Favours obtain'd at the by the Force of Money ; others which no Money will pro cure. And fuch for Example was the Bufineis follicited by the two CommiJJaries of the Holy who offer'd an Hun- 1 derd Thoufand Crowns to the to put 'em in p fÂ» feillon of the Sacred Tlaces, and to expend as much in Prefents to the Grand Stgnior, and Minifters of the But their Money was Orofs, the Divan not being to be brib'd in that cafe. By the way, I fhall lay this farther, in reference to thole JveligioHs Fathers, that their making fuch large Offers was not a thing to be wonder'd at. For they have affur'd me, that the Devotion which Spaniards have toward thole SanSiifi'd 'Places is lo great, that they themfelves would expend whole 1 leafures for Liberty to enjoy 'em again. They affirm'd to me moreover, That the Money expended in the amounts to Eight Thouland Pounds Sterling a Year, of which a tnird part goes in Prefents to the and that the Guar.. N dianChardin Perfia, dian who is Triennial, expends in Prefents at his Arrival no lefs then Two Thoufand Five Hunderd Pounds. The Third of June, which was the Day appointed for the Grand Senior's departure for Polan the Ambaliador went be times in the Morning to the Camp to the auarters of the Grand Vitier, with a defign to oblige the Haughty Mmifter to grant him that Audience which he had refus d him ever fince his Arrival, and to receive the Letter from Monfieur Lyonne. He cafry'd with him alfo M. d'Hervien, to the end that as he was the Perfon that brought it, he fliould deliver it into his Hands. But the Vi%ier was not then in the Camp, being gone to Convoy the Sultanefs, Mother to the to her firft Lodging. Which conftrain d the Ambatfador to go to the Chancellors Quarters, where he waited feven compleat Hours, fometimes in one Tent, fometimes in another, becaufe the Camp was then juft upon Diflodging. At length a little after High Noon, the News came that the was come to the City. Whither the Chancellor went to him, and told him. That the Ambaffador of ftaid in the Camp to Kifs his Hands, and to know his laft Commands. The F/- %ier order'd him to tell his Excellency, That he needed not to give himfelf the trouble of waiting, for that he was then ta king leave of his Wife, his Mother, and his Family, and ftiould not return to the Camp till Night: and therefore that it would be fufficient for him to leave only one of his Interpreters, to whom he would give his Anfwer. Which was. That impart the AmbaJJadors Demands Grand Signior Divan; but that he could Hot do by reafon that tBe Army was upon time, his Excellency might return Conftantinople, await the Grand SigniorV ^efolntion. rvould time write to the Caimacan to grant the Harbour; and for what rema he confided in the Faith and Honour have Jiopp'd hint at Adrianople, without leave. At the fame time the Interpreter had alfo Orders to know the Grand Vi%iers Commands touching certain particular Af fairs relating to Trade in feveral places of the Which he order'd to be difpatch'd the next Morning in manner and form, as the Interpreter defir'd. Anlthrough the Black -Sea, and the Colchis. 47 And this was the Succefs of M de fecond Journey to the 'Part ; upon which both Parties made different llefleai- ons. For the Jurly with great affiirance lay the blame of this Rupture upon the French : Affirming that the Abatement of the Cuftoms was not a thing to which the could juftly pretend. For that if other Nations paid not fo much, as the Enghfi, Hollanders, and Genoefes, yet there were fome Nati ons that paid more, as the Germans and Or if the firft who paid but Three per Cent. had formerly paid Five, theti the French had had fome reafbn to have demanded an Abate ment, Neverthelefs, that the fort, who is Free to beftow his Favours where he pleas'd, having Treated upon their Arrival with the laft Comers upon Terms more advantageous then thofe which he granted to his firft Allies; he was not oblig'd to alter the Conditions of Commerce that had been for fo long time concluded. Then for the reft of the Kings Demands, they faid, That they were Favours which could not be in Con- fcience demanded; as being fuch which the were Id far from having deferv'd from the Port, that they had always oppos'd him in ail his Enterprifes. To which they added. That the French had made their Demands, as if they bad had the Market in their own Hands, threatning, and ading like Lords and Matters, while the French that were in the did nothing but talk of Burning Conftantinople, making War tipon the Grand Signior, and Sacking and his 'Ports. That the Men of War that brought M. tiointel to Conjiantinople, openly proteded the efcape of a great number of Slaves of feveral forts of Nations, that put thcmfelves aboard. And that the French Atnballadors in all the Vifits which they made to the Great PerfonageSj difcours'd of no thing but his Ma;efties Conquefts, and the PuifTance of his Arms. This Defence the Turks made for themfelves. With whom other Nations alio fided, alledging, That the Turks were not too blame, as having fliew'd themfelves upon this Occafion lefs Barbarous then they were faid to be : not having manifefted any thing of violent Refentment either againft the French in the Levant, or his Majefties Ambaflador, of the nu~ tiierous and powerful Succours which they had many tirhe3 giv'n their Enemies ; of the War which they carry'd on, evert in Countries under the Turk?Protection 5 or of their Affronts and Menaces not forborn ev n in the Court it felf.

The of alfo had Or- ders^to caufe him to be Conduaed through the Frontiers of Tartary and to Command the Tartars to detain him, till they underftood that the Tnrkt/h who was in had pafs'd the Frontier^ and was enter'd into The did all they could to compofe all Differences with this Agent, and to prevent a WÂ«r with his Mafter. For the had fome Defigns upon Perfta and the fo that it was only by conftraint if they turn'd their Arms againft On the other fide the folander could not brook the Protedion which the Grand Siguier had given to the Coffach^- For which rea- fon the King demanded that his Highnefs would publickly re nounce the Protection which he had publickly allow'd. To the end that the CoJfachj being terrifi'd by fuch a Defertion, might be compell'd to fubmit the fooner to the Polifh Prince without Fighting, and he by that means regain the Poffefllon of the Ukraine, which is his particular Demeafns, and the Pa trimony of his Anceftors. During the Raign of King ( I{al%ieuskie was fent to demand the Ratification of the Treaty of CoShhin, which was obferv'd between Poland and ; and fome other Things. To which the fort made anfwer.

But M. Wk%Ojkr, being a Perfon of a violent hafty Humour, would not accept of that Expedient, nor of any other which the Turks propos'd. But loudly protefted in a full ' That ' though the King, the Senat and the Republick fliould agree ' to accept a Ungle Ratification, he would prevent 'em from ' doing it, by the Power which he had, as a Gentleman of * Poland. But when the King and the Senat underftood thdt the Grand Sign tor. was turning his Preparations againft them; and that moft afliiredly the next Spring they fhould have him at their Gates, they were both furpriz'd and confounded. Nor did the Agent himfelf know what to do, being deceiv'd by the Rumours that were fpread abroad of the Revolt of the Ara bians, and Sacking of Mecca 5 as alfo for that through the Affurances which M, deKointel had giv'n him that his Moft Chriftian Majefty would fend a Fleet of Fifty Ships into the Archipelago, he had always Writt'n to the Republick to hold faft their own, and not to relinquifli the leaft Tittle of their Demands, in regard that infallibly the Grand Si. nior would iuddainly have his Hands full on every fide. And indeed ^Poland was very defirous at that time not to have diverted his Highnels from his Deligns. For which reafon, they lent an Interpreter to the Port. Who arriv'd the 25 of May with a Train of eight Men, fix weeks after the departure of the Agent ; and had a L odging affign'd him, and Twenty Shillings a day for his Expences. The Letters which he brought were from the Great Chancellor, fuperfcrib'd to the Grand Vizier, purporting , c That Poland 1 was very much furpriz'd to underftand, that the Grand Sig- ' 'ior was preparing for a War againft them; that they e knew not the Realbn, nor had they giv'n him any Occafion; 'That if the Vortwould Ratifie the Treaty of the ' King was ready to do it, and would fend an Ambaflador Ex- traordinary for that purpofe. But that if the Signior 5 perfifted in his Defign of making War, his Majefty was rea- ' dy to defend himfelf; protefting withal that the 4 were not the Violators of the Peace. The Interpreter Was difpatch'd and lent back again in eight days, with Letters td this effect j That 'Poland might fend ah Ambafiador Extraor^50 tfhe Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, â–  i!?' 1 ' f dinary, and chat he fliould be welcom. But in the mean time the Grand Sign tors Army and the at the Head of ir, continu d their March toward In the Negotiation of the Signor there was no thing particularly obfervable. Ortly he had peculiar Infirudi- ons to preis the releafe of fuch Pris'ners as had been tak'n in the War of Candy : but after great Pains and vaft Expenccs he could obtain no more then an Exchange of Eight and Twenty of the Principal for as many of the Which Exchange was made at CajiclloTornefe in the Morea. As for the reft of the Pris'ners to the Number of a Thoufand or thereabouts, the Grand Vizier told the Procurator of That the Otto- man Galleys were deftitute of Slaves, and therefore to releafe a Thoufand at one Clap, would weak'n 'em too much ; efpe- cially at a time when they had fo much need of Rowers to carry Men and Ammunition through the (Black^Sea for fupply of their Army in Poland. However he promis'd that when the Campaigne was at an end, he would order Two Hunderd and Fifty to be releas'd 5 and fo the like Number every year till they were all at Liberty. The Venetians are at that vaft Expence at the 'TW, that it may be truly faid they buy whatever they obtain, and that at a dear rate too There is no Perfon of Credit either in the Court or the Divan, to whom they do not make confide- rable Prefents every year. For the that has no Neighbor to be afraid of, but the fpares for no Coft to be at peace with him. They pay him Tribute, out of fe- veral Iflands in the Archipelago, as and Cerigo.

Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, The Ottoman Emperors are very punctual in the Difcharge of this Dutv, as well for themfelves, as for their whole Fa- milies. They fend every year Confiderable Prefents to thofe Cities, of which they efteem it a High Honour to call them- felves'the Lords and FrotSors: and thefe Prefents are fcnt fometimfis by Land, and fometimes by Sea. In the year 1644. they were put aboard a great Gallion, which was to carry em to Cairo. Several Eunuchs and Women of the were embark'd in the fame Ve(rel, together with the Grand Sim's Delegates, and a great Number of Paffcngers and Souldiers, This Veffel putting to Sea from Conftantinoplc, with feveral other Veffels under her was fet upon not far from Rhodes by the Galleys of and after a fierce Engagement taken.

However the Cargo which they unladed into their Galleys was valu'd at a Million of Money. The News of the taking this put the into a Rage : infomuch that he threaten'd to exterminate all the Chriftians that were in Conj as well Ambaffa- dors and Foreign Minifters, as others. And he thus menac'd all forts of Nations, becaufe, faid he, the Galleys of were Mann'd with Chrifiians and Souldiers from all parts of Chrijiendom. M.

For he nad been kept ,n a dole Imprifonment during the Fvaign of Ofmin, his Brothers the latter of which, after he had caus d his two younger Brothers to be ftrangl'd, when he ^w h.mfelf near his End, commanded alfo that ftould be ftrangl d, who was the only Brother that remain'd. However this Ri- corous Command was not put in Execution, for that Anmrcth not having any Children, Ibrahim that was the only Remainder of the Ottoman Family, was alfo Heir of the Empire. By the way we are to obferve, that the reafon which indued Amu- rat to let Ibrahim alon6, and put his two other Brothers to death, though much younger, was his want of Wit, which rendring him unfit for Governmeht, fecur'd him from any fear of a Rebellion for his fake. So foon as he came to the Throne, he plungd himfelf into all manner of Vice and Wick- ednefs. His Debaucheries, his Extortions, and his Cruelties renderd him Odious and infupportable to all his Subjefo. He feiz'd upon the Revenues of the Mofquees, and private Mens Eftates, without any diftinftion of Sacred or Prophane, and frequently put to death Uich as he thought to be Rich, to th6 end he might with more eafe make himfelf Mafter of their Eftates^ and all this to fupply the inordinate Expences of his Pleafures, and the exceffive Luxury of his Court. The Soul' diers were ill paid j which caus'd em to mutiny, with a Re- folutiort to depofe Ibrahim in the Month of 1648 a11 ^ to fet upon the Throne hfahamed his Eldeft Son, about leven Years of Age â€¢, fo that twelve Days after they ftrangl'd him. I. have already related, how that in the Minority of hamed, the Empire was Govern'd by Women and Eunuchs, who fill'd all the chief Places of Truft, as they thought good themfelves, and particularly that of the Prime Minifter, till they gave it to Cuperly Mahomet who undertook the War of Tranfylvania. His Succeflbr, who was his Son, began that of Hungary, which being ended by the Peace in the Year 1 66 as already has been faid, for the next two Years he clolely purfu'd the War of Candy, where he found a longer and more vigorous Rsfiftance then he expe&amp;cd* Hadthrmgh'the Black-Sea, and Colchis. Had Candy held out another Winter againfl: the 'tis not to be queftion'd, but that the muft have been forc'd to raife his Siege, and then ftrange Commotions would have happen'd in the Empire. The Veterane janizaries were all either (lain or dead in the Siege: The reft would not budge a foot. The Turksmurmur'd at the War ; and cry'd out that the Ottoman Forces were commanded to dafli out their Brains againft a Rock : The People of were for advancing the Grand Signiors Brother to the Throne. His Highnefs was follicited to put the Vizier to death, by means of fuch a Sacrifice to appeafe the Fury of the People and Souldiery. Both the one and the other of thefe Changes had been fufficient to have rats'd the Siege. The Grand Vizier knew all this. So that he defpair'd of putting an end to the War : difmally afraid at once to lofe both his Honour and his Life. It is reported that he tore his very Hair from his Chin. However it is moft certain that it brought upon him a moft Incurable Diftemper, difficult to be nam d. It was an odd kind of feizureof the Heart, or faint ing of the Spirits, caus'd by Fear, Affl &amp;ion and Pannick Ter- rour. For which the Ph)fitians prcfcrib'd him to drink pure Wine without any Mixture ; which he did every day ; nor could any thing but that do him any good. When the News of the Surrender of was brought to the Grand Signior, his Highnels could not believe it; but when the Tydings were confirm'd, it tranfported him to fuch an Excefs of Joy, that rather feem'd to be a fort of Frenzy for the time. And both He and the whole Court frequently re peated thefe words, The Franks have The Turksboafted upon the taking of That they had Conquer d all Chriflendom. Becaule the Town had been defended by Soldiers and Volunteers from all parts of dom ; and they faid moreover. That the Siege had lafted three Years, for that all Chrijiendom had been there, and done the utmoft of their Endeavours. The moft ufeful and provident Preparation which the Grand Vizier made for the Siege, was to make his or Steward of his Houfliold, High Treafurer of the Empire. For he knew the Love and Friendfhip which that Lord had for him, and that for a need he would not fpare his Life to do him Service. And this lame Forefight of his was the gaining of the Place, and the fafeguard of his own Life. For the High Treafurer would not fuffer any want to be in the Camp. Sheep were there&lt;the Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, there in great plenty at a Crown apiece. The Markets were ftor'd With all Things neceflary for Food and Raiment. And Men car'd not what they gave, or what Rilco s they ventur'd, to carry Ammunition to a Place where Money abounded. By the Accompts which the Treafurer brought into the 2)/. van of the Extraordinary Expences at the three laft Years of the Siege, it appear'd that Seven Hunderd Thoufand Crowns had been fpent in Gifts to that turn d Turks, or left the Ifland, to recompence llich Souldiers as had behav'd themfelves more bravely then others; and to pay the Prizes fet upon the Chriftians Heads; which was hall a Guinea for every Head. By that Accompt it appear'd that the had made an Hunderd Thoufand Shot with their great Guns againft the Place ; and that there had been flain before the Place Se ven Bafha's, Fourfcore Captains and Colonels, 1 0400 Jani- faries, befides other Souldiers and Troops of the Provinces, whofe Pay is not charg'd to the State.

Then he remov'd the Court to Adriample, and began the Tranfylvaman War, in re gard the War in Cdndywould have calld him too far from the Grand Signiors Perfon, not being as yet of Age to March at the Head of his own Armies. This Tranfylvaman War was (hort, and honourable for the Grand Vizier by the defeat of Prince and by the taking of Waradin, though it coft him the Blood of the choked Ottoman Troops, and the braveft of their Officers.

'Tis a queftion whether ever there were a more capable to Govern the Empire, then (Pacha. He was very tall, and fomewhat full and plump of Body. His Eyes Urge and wide: His Face well fliap'd ; his Complexion Fair and Smooth: The Air of his Face Modeft, Grave, Affable, and Obliging. He was no Tyrant, mor tally hating Oppreffion, Juftice and Equity appear'd in all his Anions, nor did he fuffer himfelf to be fway'd by his own In- tereft. For whether it were that he did not give his Mind to thirft after Riches, or whether it were that his own Eftate which was very Great, fatisfi'd his defires, he was never known to be Covetous like the reft of the Turks: And this is particularly faid of him, very much to his Honor, that of all thePerlons, that addrefs'd themfelves to him with Prefents, to accomplife their Ends,not any obtain'd 'em by that means. His Wit was of a large extent, penetrating and referv'd: His Me mory happy and prompt: His Judgment found,and always well apply'd : For he ftill fell diredtly upon the Point. He fpoke little and Modeftly, but with that Solidity and Knowledge which it is not eafie to defcribe. The Firft Years of his Mi- niftry were very Honourable and Advantageous to the Otto man Empire, and his following Atchievements much more. This Great Perfonage therefore having obferv'd the Happy fuccefsof his Father in the Government of Turkey, labour'd to follow his example and tread his Steps as near as he could. He began the War againft the E which his Father had projected, and was about to have undertak'n. To which purpofe he march'd to Buda, with an Army of Threefcore Thoufand Men, and befieg'd TSLeu which he took in the Year 166%.

The 17th by Break of Day M. de Kointel went incognito to vifit the Caimacan and to demand a Paffport for the Kings Ship. The Caimacan return'd for anfwer, that he had receiv'd no Orders from the Grand to give him one, and therefore could not do it. At which the Affibaf- fador was very much furpriz'd, and as highly concern'd ; and thereupon complain'd to the Caima of the un- kindnefs toward him. Upon which the made a (hew of taking his Part, and being concern'd for the Unjuftice done the Ambaflador; and then concluded with his Excellency, that they would fend a particular MefTenger and Letter's to the Trime Vizier. As for the C he fail'd not to (end, on his part, to the Vitaer an accompt of all that the Amba{ra- dor had told him, and reprelented to him by Way of Com plaint. On the other fide M. in his Letters tax'd the Vi'z.ier of Breach of his Word. He conjur'd him not to injure his Patience, which he had now contain'd as long as he could j to let him know the Final Refblution of the Port, and particularly to fend him Order for a Pals for the Kings Ship. The Expreflesthat carry'd thefe Letters fet forth at feveral times. The Caimacan s Meffenger departed the i8th of and the M. de Nointefs the next Day. The Mef- fenger found the Court not far from from whence he return'd to Conftantinople the Ninth of yw/y. So foon as he ar- riv'd, his Mafter fent for the Ambaffadors Chief Interpreter and cold him, that the Vizier had given no anfwer to his Exprefs; only had fent him word that he would let him un- derftand the Grand Signiors Pleafure by another way. The Ambafladors Courrier was not return'd the 20th of July, when 1 lett the City; and therefore I know not what anfwer he brought. Acthrough the Black-Sea, and Colchis. At the end of Jam the Ambaflador fent for a Pafs for the Diredior ot the Levant Company, and for my felf; a Licenfe to bring in a Parcel of Wine, and another to be admitted into the Santa Sophia. To which the return'd for Anfwer, That he could not grant any one of the AmbafTa^ dor's Demands, until lie firft knew the Mind.' That it very much troubUd him to refufe him fuch Trifles; but confidering how 1 hings flood between the and the Ambaflador, he fhould make himfelf a Publick Ofi fender to grant Pafles to his Excellency : but that fo foon as he had leave, his Excellency fhould find the great Affeftion which he had for the French Nation. This Refufal troubl'd me extreamly ; for that it feenfd to confirm the Report, which ran about. That the intended to Arreft the Ambaflador and all the Nation. 1 found I had a large Stock of Goods; as much as two Horfes could carry, as I have faid before. My Comrades Baggage and my own was as much as Would load four Horfes more. So that it was to no purpofe to think of efcaping by Flight, much leis of concealing our felvcs. Befides this, three other Confiderations very much augmented my cares and my per plexity. The firll was, That whatibever way t took to get into 'Perfa, I could not get out of in three Months. during which time the Tort would have time enough to fend their Orders to the utmofi: Limits of the Empire to Hop the French,[( they defign'd any filch violent proceedings againft 'em. The fecond was. That nothing of all that I carry'd of great- eft Value, had paid at the Cuftom-Houfe, lb that if I happen'd to be fearch d either at Conjiantinople, or any other Cities of Turkey,I could not expeft any Afliftance from the Ambafla dor. The third was. That becaufe of the Heat of the Wea ther, there was no Caravan that travell'd into till OSio*- her. In the midfl; of this Intricate Perplexity, COP, whole In finite Favour I have always experiene'd in my mofi: prefling Necefllties, fliew'd me a ready way to make my elcape front Con [Iantinomic. The Grand Signior has a Fortrefs about T wen- ty Miles from the River Tanait, over againft that part where the great River difcharges it felf into the Lake which Fort is call'd A%ac. The fW fends thither every Year a New Commander with Souldiers and Money; and they fend by Sea. bccaufe it is not above 1300 Miles by Water; and to avoid the Hazards by Land for fear of the R andThe Travels of Sir John Ghardin Perfia, and Mufcovitcs. Moreover, the which is a fort of ThkMj Veffel that takes the Commander aboard, is not ex- pos'd to the fearch of the Cuftomers, as are the reft of the Ships that Sail into the Blach^Sea, That which is aboard may be laid to be free, there being none but the mander that has any Authority to rake Cognizance of it. T his Saiqne touches at Cap, which is a City and famous iri the Crimean Tartary. Whence all the Veflels that are bound for Uimrelea or Colchis put to Sea in the Months and OBohr, from whence it is not above feven or eight days Journey before ye enter into the Pcrfi au Dominions. There is no fliorter way from Conjlantinople to 'Per/5,-/, nor lefs trou- blefom For the whole Voyage may be made in three Weeks, all by Sea till within about Sixty Leagues, yet is there no paf- fage lefs us'd, nor more unknown, by reafon of the Dangers of the Sea ; nor could I fiind any one Perfon at that ever had undertaken it. I met with a great many that confirm'd my Report, and that had been at the Havens of Mingrelia, where there are great Numbers of and Georgians, the Subjeds of the Per/MH King, who told me that it was not above fix or feven Days Journey from thence into their Territories. The Dangers of this Paffage which difcourage People from attempting it, are twofold : Firft, For that the is very Tempeftuous, to the lols of the moft part of theVelfels for want of skill and good Havens. Befides that the People that inhabit between the Sea and the Territories are naturally barbarous and wicked, without any Religion, and under no Government : So that I ftould never have lb much as dreamt of the Way of Colcbii , whatever might have been the Allurements of Curiofity, or Eafinefs of Palfage, had not the Road through Turkey prefented it felf much more Formi dable, confidering the Mifchievous Circumftances already men- tion'd. But that which moft inclin'd me to the Voyage by Sea, was the Conveniency of rhe Saic bound for which to me leem'd a moft infallible way to get out of without much Trouble, and without any Danger, unlefs it were that of the Blacl^Sea. But that Sea fo nam'd and lo fam'd from terrible and frequent Shipwracks that happ'n in it for want of Skilful Pilots among the made me tremble to think of it Neverthelels I law the Hazards to which I expos d my felf, and the Dangers of the Voyage j however they did not terrific me fo much as the Dangers and Perilsthrough the Black-Sea, and the 0/Colchis. 65 which I have mention d either in (laying any longer fiantimple, or in travelling quite through' ^ The Danger indeed ot the '^lac^Sea was the gtea reft be- caule it threaten'd the lofs of all ; but it was more uncertain.

One of ray Friends to whom I imparted my Deiign, eni gag'd a Greek. Merchant to affift me, who was bound for this, and went in the Saic prepar'd for He was a very honeft Man, befides that my Friend had. fome hank as well over his Eftate as Perfon. So that he obiig'd him to ferve me ' to the uttermoft of his Power, under the forfeiture of his Friendfliip if he fail'd. Thereupon the Merchant un dertook to help me, and did it fo cordially and feduloufly that the Succefs anfwer'd both his Diligence and Fidelity. He cook upon him to hire Cabbins for me in the Saic, never difcover- ing for whom it was ; he put my Goods aboard, forae and iome, as he faw his Opportunity. ' He gave me advice, and neceflary Inftrudions how to make myfclf refpcckxl in the Veflel, and to get good Entertainment at C,ifa^ whither I was firft bound Among the reft of my Dire&amp;ions, he or- der'd me to get good Recommendations to the Officer that was to Command at J%ac ^ and to take along with me the Grand Sigmors Pals. As for the Recommendation, [ did not much fear to get it, but the Pafs drove me to defpair, bccaufe I had already been refus'd it. Thereupon I difcover'd my perplexity to M. befeeching his Excellency to give me leave to make nfe of the Letters ot Recommendation which I had from the Enghp Am- baflador, who was at Tans, when I departed thence, for the Englifh Ambaflador at Conjiantinople, that I might by his means obtain a Pafs as an EngliflvMan Which although Nointel fcrupl'd at firft, yet he confented at length, when I told him the Urgency of my Occafions. So that he caus'd his Secretary both to write and carry his Letter to the Ambaflador, who was very glad to ierve his Excellency in my behalf. And indeed the Ambaflador purfu'd his Kindnefs with the greateft Grace in the World, and with a real AfFe&amp;ion, but without fuccefs. For as the Ca was ready to fign the Pafs, Some-body gave him private Intimation to take a care what he did j for that the Pafs recjuir'd of him was for a~Tbe Trawls of Sir John Chardin into Perfia, a FÂ«Â»f/&gt;Man under pretence of being Englijh. Which fpoil'd all â€¢ and made a Difference between the Ambafladot and the Caimacan, who complain'd of the Surprize j and be tween the EngUfh Ambaffador and whom he tax'd for having giv'n the Caimacan his private Intelli- oence. ^ The i pth of 'july the Gne\ Merchant who was to Con- duft me to Mingrelia, came to give me notice that the lay at an Anchor near the Mouth of the Blacl^-Sea, and only expelled a fair Wind. So that I would prefently have gone aboard, but my Friends did not think it convenient, till the Vefiel was ready to Sail, for fear I fhould be difcover'd for a French-Man: Thereupon I ftaid three days with Sitti- baldi Fiefchi,Keftdent of Genoa, at a Country-Houfe which he had upon the Bofphorus , and four days more at a fait Monaftery of the Greeks. at the end of the Channel upon Europe fide, over againft the Harbour where the Saic lay at Anchor. The ThracianBofphom is certainly one of the Lovelieft parts of the World. The Gree^t call thofe Streights or Arms of the Sea which an Ox may be able to fwim over. This Channel is about Fifteen Miles in length , and about Two in breadth, in moil parts, but in others lefs. The Shores confift of R ifing Grounds cover'd over with Houfes of Plea- fine. Wood, Gardens, Parks, Delightful Profpefts, Lovely Wildernelles Water'd with Thoufands of Springs and Foun- taim. The Piofpedl of Conftantinople., when ye behold it from the top of the Channel, at the diftance of two Miles, is beyond compare, as being to my Eyes, as to all that ever faw it, the moft Charming Profpecl that can be feen. The Paflage through the Bofphorus is the moft lovely and fulleft of Diver- diement that can be made by Water: And the number of Barks that Sail to and fro in fair Weather is very great. The Refident of Genoa told me. He made it his Paftime to tell the Boats that Sail'd to and fro before his Houfe from Noon to Sun-let, in what time he told no lels then Thirteen Hun- derd. There are Four Caftles that ftand upon the Bofphorm well Fortifi'd with great Guns; Two, Eight Miles from the 'BLrekc Sea,and Two more near the Mouth of the Channel. The Two latter were buiit not above Forty Years ago, to prevent the Coffcifhs, Mufcovits and [ Vo from entring into the Mouththrough the Black-Sea, and Colchis. Mouth of the Channel; who before made frequent Inro ds into it with their Barks, ahnoft within fight of nople. The i 7th by break of day I embark'd, our VeiTel being then under Sail. Above Fourfcore Veflels of different Bur thens put to Sea at the fame time. In ours there were about Two Hunderd Men; the Commander of with his Train to the Number of Twenty ; a Hunderd Janifaries, Thirty Ma' riners, and Fifty Paflengers. I had three Cabbins, two for my Comrade and my felf, and the third for our Goods. Our Servants lay upon the Deck. Their Cabbins are very narrow and incommodious j ours being at the Prow. There were in all Thirty two in the Saic, with a great Cabbin for the Cap tain very fpacious and handfomely furnifli'd 5 wherein Ten Perfons might lodge very conveniently. But that which is very inconvenient in the Turkilh Veflels is this, That they make no Provifion of any thing for Subfiftance, not fo much as of Wood and Water 5 for the reft might well be endur'd. Every one has his Liberty to drefs his Vittles three or four times a day. The Fire Place is upon the Deck near the Poop: where they who have any thing to drefs carry their Kettle, their Wood and their Water. So that I havefeen about Eigh teen Pots together upon the Fire. Their Places of Eafement are with outfide of the Ship near the Poop, like Cages, which they take off and hang on as they pleale themfelves. The Saks have no more then one Deck. Nor but two Mafts with aBoltfprit; that is, a Main Mart and Mizen. Thefe Mafts carry but two Sails, and for the moft part but one. They have no Shrouds but one that is very final!, which is fix'd to the Main Maft, and hangs down upon the Dedo They have no Skuttles at the top of their Mafts. So that the Turkifli Seamen never run up to the Yards Arms to furl or loolen their Sails, which is needlefs, becaule the Yards Arm is always below upon the Deck ; fo that when they would take the Wind, they only draw up the Yards Arm to which the Sail is fix'd. The Top-Sail is ty'd to the Yards Arm, and when they would make ufeof it, they pull up the Yards Arm with a Pully faften'd to the Top-Maft-Head. Thus it may be eafily feen that they neither undcrftand the life of the Yard- Arms nor Mafts of a Ship. Neither have they in thele Veflels either Pumps to pump out the Water, nor Capftalls to weigh their Anchors ; but they empty out their Water with Pales: and then when they weigh S An-The Travels of Sir John Gliardin Perfia, Anchor, there are Twenty or Thirty Men that take hold of the Anchor-Cables that run through tvvofmall Pulleys faften'd ro the Prow of the Ship, and draw up the Anchor with all their Might, till it be high enough. When a VelTel enters la den into any Port, they fix four Anchors, two to her Poop; and two to her Prow, and fo let her lie. And this is all I have obferv'd in reference to the Building and Rigging of thefe fort of Veffels among the Turks- As for their Navigation there is nothing of Art, nor Security in it: The beft of the Turkifh or Pilots depend only upon a bare Experience, without any Foundation of Rules. They never make any ufe of Sea-Carts, nor ever make thofe exaÂ£i Obfervations, like our Seamen, of the Ships way every day fet down in Journals, by which Obfervations they know how far they are from the place whither they intend. They underlhnd very little of the Compafs i only they know that the plorvre deLuce always tends toward the North. When they are to make any Voyage they ftay for a good Wind and fair Weather. Nor do they, when that is come, prefently put to Sea till they have ftaid eight or ten Hours to fee whether the Weather will hold or no : and generally they Sail along by the Shore having the Land always in fight. But when they are forc'd to take the Main Sea, then they make ufe of the Compafs: To which purpole they know cither by report or experience upon which hand they ought to have the North, that they may gain fuch a Harbour 5 which is all they have to guide em â€¢, for more then this they know not. Were they to make long Voyages in the open Sea, hardly one Ship would efcape a Tempeft, which they happily avoid, keeping as much as they can within fight of Land, or near fome Harbour. When the Wind is very high, they furl their Sails^ and let the Veflel drive with the V Vaves. If the Wind be contrary, they never ftrive againft it, but vere about, and rather return frorii whence they came, then endure the Violence of a contrary Sea. That which mines 'em, is when the Wind blows em upon the Shore ; for then they are fo out of heart, that they Iplit immediately not knowing what it is to I have heard feveral old Tnrkifb Captains affirm, That there are Fifteen Hunder'd Veflels upon the Ulach^Sea , of which they lofe a Hunderd every Year. The moft dangerous place where Shipwracks are moft to be feard being at the En trance of Bofphorm. f tkthrough the Black -Sea, and Colchis. The Entrance into it is very Narrow, where generally the VVinds encounter one another ; of which there is one that ftili keeps back the VelTeis, which if it be violent dings'em upon the Coaft which is full of lliarp Rocks; to the lofs of fo many .Galleys and Ships that their Number is hardly to be numberd. Tis but a little while fince that no lefs then feventeen Galleys were caft away in one day. And there is no queftion but that the frequent Storms that arife at all feafons in the Sea, the Surges fliort, and cutting one upon another, its ftreight and narrow Channel, and the dangerous Coafts that in part furround it, are the chief caufe of the feveral Ship- wracks that happ'n there 1 . On the other fide there is no doubt alfo but that skilful Pilots and good Seamen would fave above half the Veflels which are there loll. The Third of dHgnftin the .Morning we arnv'd at Cajfa, after a Voyage of eight days, all which time we had very fair Weather and little Wind. Upon the ^ifth we fpy'd the Point of the Tauric Cherfomefe. For the call that a which the Latins call a Teninfula, and they gave that Name to this alraoft Tanric Ifland, becaufe it was firft inhabited by the Scythians of Mount Taurus. It lies toward the Eaft and Weft,being about 250 Leagues in Circuit; that is, 35 Leagues in length, which I ta ! e from the to the and 55 I eagues in the broadeft part. But the that joyns it to the Continent is not above a League in breadth. The Mo dern Geographers call it Crim and Precopenfian tary. As much as to fay Tartary full of Towns â€¢, to diftinguifli the Tartars of this feninfula that live for the moft part in Cities, efpecially all the Winter long, from thofe other pean Tartars, which inhabit without the call'd gays, as alfo Hordes or Hordou , a word which flgnifics an Alfembly, and of which the and generally make ufe to fignifie the Camp of an Army, or the Numerous Train of a Court. The Country belonging to thefe two forts of Tartars,Vrecaps and Nogajs, is that which we call the LeJJer Tartary to diftinguiih it from the Afiatich^ that inhabit beyond the Lake M^otis^ to the Eaft of the Cafpian Sea, and thence as far as China, The Sea-Coaft of this Precopens Peninfula, to fpeak of that part which Ihoots fartheft into the Sea as far as Caffa, confifts of very high Shoars, and Mountains cover d with Woods and Villages. And by the Accompt of the Seamen^ it is from Con- fiantinopk to Cajfa through the Black-Sea, 750 Miles, Tho kno#The Tray els of Sir John Chardin Perfra, know not how they reck 05 nor how it can agree, with what freqiiently happens, for the Sates to make the Voyage in two Days and two Nights juft. And therefore by my Accompt it is no more then two Hnnderd Leagues. Upon our coming to an Anchor, our Veffel fir'd two Guns, and the Commander defen'd for A^icmade all his Musketeers give the Callle a Volfe'v. Which done, he went aflioar with the Officers that were come to receive him in the s Name, Both the Ci~ ty and Port are very free ; for you have Liberty to go in and out, never asking any leave : Nor do they come aboard to fearch the Veffels, But when a Ship drops her Anchor, feve- ral Boats make from the Haven to carry thofe afhoar that are defirous to go. Caffa is a great Town built at the bottom of a little Hill upon the Sea-flioar. It extends it felf more in length then breadth, lying in length very diredly from the to the North', encompafs d with very ftrong Walls,that advance a little into the Sea, which is the reafon that when we take a Profpeft of the City from the upper part of the Deck, it feems to be built like a Half-Moon. The Caftle upon the South fide ftands upon a Rifing Ground that commands all the parts thereabout, being very large, and the Refidence of the The other is not fo big, but well ftor'd and defended with great Guns ^ the Sea wafliing that fide which is next to it. They reck'n about 4000 Houfes to be in Caffa j of which 5200 are inha bited by Mahnmetans, Turks and and 800 by (tns, Greeks and Armenians ; though the are more numerous then the Greeks. The Houfes are b it fmall, and all built of Earth, as are alfo their or Market-places, their Publick StrucKires, Mofquees, and Baths. There is not one Building of Stone in all the City, except eight Churches fome- what gone to decay, formerly built by the This Caff a was once calfd Theodofia, which the built in the fifth Age. Afterwards it fell under the Dominion of the noefes, with feveral other Sea-Port Towns in feveral parts of that Sea, in the Thirteenth Age, in the time of the Holy War, and during the weak and low Condition of the Eaftern Emperors. But Mahomet the Second won all rhofe Places from the Genoefes toward the end of the Sixteenth Age; 'Caffa being taken in the Year 1 574. The Soyl about Cafj'a is Dry and Sandy 5 nor is the Water good ; but the Air is very pure and wholfom. There are very few Gardens about it, nor is there but little Fruit. How everthrough the Blacic-Sca, an Country ofQchctm. ever they bring great Quantities from the Neighbouring VU- iages, though it cannot be faid to be very delicious. How ever I do not know whether there be any other City in the. World where other Provifions are cheaper and better.' Their Mutton is exceeding well-tafted, and not above one Farthing a Pound. Their other Provifions of Bread, Fruit, Wild Fowl, and Butter, is fold proportionably at a cheaper Rate. Salt is as .good as giv'n ye 5 and in a word, whatever is neceffary for Human Suftenance cofts little or nothing; Neverthelefs by the way take notice, that Frelli Fifli is a very great Rarity, and very fmall whatever that they catch in the parts round about the Harbour^ and that only at certain times, as in AntHmu and the Spring. Almoft all the Turks and that live in the Town wear little Bonnets of Cloath fac'd with Sheepskins. But in regard that over all Afia Bonnets are moft dually worn among the Chrijlianf, thofe of are oblig'd to faften to theirs a little piece of Cloath, fuch as the Jews in wear upon their Cloaks^ to diftinguiih 'em from the metans. The Road of Caff a. is flielter'd from the Winds, except it be to the North and South-Eaft: and the Ships lie at Anchor near the Shoar in Ten and Twelve Fathom Water, Ouzie at the bottom and very fafe. There is alio a great Trade driven there, more then in any other Port belonging to the Sea. During the Forty Days that I ftaid there, I law come in and go out above Four Hunderd Sail of Ships, not count ing little Veflels that keep clofe to the Shoar. The moft ufual and mofl: confiderable Trade which they drive confifts in Salt Fifh, and Caveare, which comes from the Lake and is thence tranfported into Europe, and as far as the 'Tis incredible what a World of Fifh is caught in that Lake, confi- dering its extent. And .the reafon which the Country People give for the Infinite Multitude of Fifh there bred and taken, is this, For that the Water of that Lake being muddy, thickj and not very fait, becaufe of the Tanais that empties it felf in to it, it invites not only the Fifli out of and the Sea, but alfo out of the Hellefpont and where they breed and grow fat in a imall time. Several Perfons have affut'd me, That they ufually catch Fifh in that Lake^ which weigh every one Eight and Nine Hunderd Pounds, and of which they make between three and four Hunderd weight of Caveare. 'Tis true, I never faw any fuch large Fifli alive at Caffa j however I am apt to believe it, by the pieces of T Fiftic Jj)e c r'rA'vcls of Sir John Chardin Perils, FiOi which I have feen, and the vaft Quantities which they export into a Thoufand Places. Their Fifhing lafts from her till A^ril. And perhaps it is the Mudd of that Water of U&lt;eotts which makes 'em call it a for other- wife it would be more properly call'd a Lake, in regard it bears \^rels of Burden, nor do the Waters rife or fall, and befides that it continually partakes of a great River and the ^ ea * Next the Exportation of Caveare and Fifli, the molt con- fiderable Trade is ddv'n in Corn, Butter and Salt, with which this City furniflies Cotijiantinople , and feveral other places. The Cajfa Butter is the beft in all The have feveral times defir'd leave to Trade to this Town 5 but it would never be granted. In the Year 167 2. Signer Quirini was at great Expences to obtain it, and he had obtain'd it indeed, but the Cuftomer of Conjiantinople caus'd the Licence to be revok'd upon this Occafion. All the Europeans hweit agreed in their Capitulations, That they (hall pay no Cuftoms, but in fuch places where they un lade their Goods. By Virtue cf which Article the would pay no Cuftoms at Confiant for Goods that came in a fmall Veffel bound for Caff a , which the Farmer of the Cuftoms claim'd. And S obtain'd an Or der from the Defterdar to the not to take any Cog nizance of what was in the (aid Veflel: ('Which Defterdar is the High Treafurer of the Empire 5 and has all the Cuftoms under his Inlpe&amp;ion.) But the Cuftomer feeing this Order, wrote to the That the Trade of the Venetians into the tBlacl^Sea, would be very prejudicial to the Grand Signior and the 'Port, and that the particular Damage to his Highnefs was moft vifible, in regard the Merchandize which is proper for the Blach ^Sea and brought from Venice pays Cuftoms twice, at their coming into the ol Conjiantinople, and going out. That it was the fame thing as to the Com modities that were brought out of that Sea, and which the netians Export, all which the G would lofe if the Venetianf had l iberty to Trade thither, in regard that by Vir tue of their Capitulations, they ought to pay no Cuftoms but where they difcharge their Merchandifes. Befides , that to permk the Venetians an Entrance into the Blac^Sea, was to open a new way for the Princes to Correlpond and Confederate with the Princes whole Dominions border upon thofe Seas who are all Enemies to the And laftly, 'f Thatthrough the Black-Sea, and o/ Colchis. That it behov'd him to confider that fuch a Permiffion would ruine a great Number of Seamen, of the Signiors Sub- je&amp;s, as well Turks as Chriftian^ for that in regard there is more Security in the European, Navigation then in the the Venetians would have all the Carriage of Goods through the Blacky Sea, and every one would Ship his Goods in their Veffels. The Grand Vizier was fenfible of this; and there fore gave Orders to the Governor of Conjiantimpk not to let any Venetian Ship pafs into the The 30th my Grecian Guide unladed my Goods, Baggage, and whatever belong'd to me out of the Ship that brought me to Caff a ^ and Ship'd it aboard another Veflel bound for Which done, he went to the Cufl of Cajfa, and told him, That there were two French 'Papa aboard the Veflel of A'&amp;ac, who were defirous to Embark themfelves in another Veflel, being bound for Mingrelia. That thofe carry'd feveral Trifles along with'em, as Books, and other Things of no va lue, for the Ule of a Monaftery; and that if the Cujiom- Houfe thought fit, that he fliould fend fome of their Offi cers to learch the Ship. For the as well as the Turks,call Tapa's all manner of Ecclefiaftical Perfbns that Officiate in Holy Orders, whether Single or Married ; and therefore my Guide thought fit that my Companion and my felf fliould both take upon us the Title of To that purpofe our Greeh^ made 'em believe, that we were going to the ItalianMifftonaries in and that we were of their Fraternity. However the Cnjiomcr fent his Officers aboard to fearch our Packs ; and our came along with him. Prefently I open'd two Chefts before the Searcher; who put his Hand into one that was full of only Books, Pa pers , and Mathematical Inftruments, and finding nothing more at the Bottom, then what he faw at the Top, fell a laughing, and ask'd the Man that brought him, If fuch Rub- bifh as that were worth carrying out of into With that I fumbl'd out one of thofe Pieces that are worth Three Shillings, like a Man that had not much to fpare, but look'd upon five or fix of thofe Pieces to be agreatTreafure, and prefented the Searcher with it; who refus'd it at firft, but took it at laft, when I told him 'twas only to pay for his Boat, which he could not deny j and fo went away without more ado. My Guide went along with him, and heard the Re port which he made to the Cuftomer, That we had nothingTh Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, but a few Books and Papers, with fome few Toys of Brafs.and Wood that were of little or no Value. At the end of two Hours my faithful Guide return'd,and told me. That to protcft us abfolutely from any further danger of the Cnft outers, it behov'd us to give the Clerk of the Veflcl as much as we had giv'n the Searcher ; in regard the Clerk took an exaft Note of all that was embark'd, and gives it every Even ing to the Cuftomr, who keeps it for a Control : to which I anfwer'd. That he might do what he thought fit. Thereup on prefently calling to the Clerk, Thou feeft, faid he, that the Searcher has found nothing in the Chefts. They have one more full of Papers, and five or fix Boxes of Pictures for their Church. That they did not op n 'em be- caufe the Air fpoils the Colour of the Painting, and becaufe the Pictures were carefully ty'd up in Bundles 5 and therefore I defire thee to accept of this Three Shillings which they give thee, and to put down in thy Note no more then the two Chefts which the Searcher has feen, without taking Cogni zance of the reft. Upon which he let us carry away all that we had, and bid us, Farervel in Name that we carry'd off all our Goods in two Boats, and put em aboard the Ship that was bound for Mi Nor did any Body demand any thing of us. For the Cuftomers, and the Seamen of the Ship which we left as Well as of the other Vefiel where in we embark'd again, really believ'd us to be and that all w T e carry'd with us was of little worth : that the Sacks wherein I told em were our Provifions were full of no thing elfe befide. For there are certain Slights and Shifts which we cannot fo well fet down , that are abfolutely neceflary for thofe that travel Turkey,that they who can make a right: ufe of may pafs fecurely and withouftrouble. For thereby we avoid Forfeitures and ill ufage, and we free our felves dex- troufly from the Cuftom-Houfes, which take 'em all together, are none of the fevereft. But after all, it requires Good Luck, that is to fay, a prudent Conduft and a Contrivance proper to the Genius of the Turks i and a Man muft alfo be fure to watch his Opportunities. The 25th of Attgujiythe Veflel that brought us fo Caffa^ fet Sail for the Fortrcfs of with three of the fame Borden in her Company. The New Commander would not have had her fet Sail till the return of the which he had le nt to the Fortrels, to know whether they were at Peace with the Mufiovites, and whether there were any Pirates or notthrough the Bkck-Se% and Colchis^ not Gruifing uport the Lake Maoris. The People of Caff a reck'n it 450 Miles from thence to though it be not fo much by Land, in regard they travel it eafily in Twelve or Thirteen Days As for the Streight of the Lake Mxotu, or rather the Channel between the Lake and the Black-Sea, it is about five Leagues in length. Which Channel was by the Ancients call'd the Cimmerian Bofphorus ; but now the Moderns call it the Steight of Cafa, and alfo the Mouth The great Veffels that go to Jiac put in at f ale fir a, which is For ty Miles from the Fortrefs, and Twenty from the River Ta- mis ; for that there is not Water deep enough for em to Sail any farther. The Fortrefs of is Fifteen Miles from the River: And it is very dangerous and hazardous to fend either Men or Money to that Place; for they areattack'd by ftrons Parties of the Mufcovites as well by Sea as by Land. Thl Commanders of this Fortrefs make always Leagues with the Neighborhood, though they feldom laft long : for that either of one fide or t'other there arife every day new Occafions to b.eak em. The Tui'kj have two little Fortrefles where they keep Garifon at the Mouth of the Tafia is upon the Banks of that great River which the Ancients call'd Orxentes, and which the People of the Country call being about FoUrfcore Leagues in length. They Fortifie the Mouth of this River with a vaft Chain, to prevent the Mufcovites and from Roving with their great Barks upon the Lake and the Sea. ^ For before thofe two Fortrefles were built, and this Chain faften d athwart the River, thofe People came down with their Boats and Cruisd about all over thole Seas. But there is a flop now put to their great Vetfcls. However in the Night-time, and by the power of Number, they fome- times force their fmaller Barks over the Chain; but 'tis very rarely that they will venture, for fear of being funk by the Shoe from the two Forts. There was alio formerly another Fort three Leagues off from the Merfh call'd Tana, belonging to the River Tanais ; but it is now ruin'd ; nor is it A%ac, as fome would have it to be, which is fifteen Leagues diftant from it. 0 The 30th our Veflel put to Sea, and Sail'd to a place call'd Donflorv, or the Salt-Pits; which are great Merfhes of Salt up on the Shoar fifty Miles from Cafa. We arriv'd there the 31ft m the Morning : Immediately alt the People went to Lade Salt j for there was no Guard kept upon it; and they affur'd us that Two Hunderd Vefiels were Laden there every Year U withThe Trawls of Sir John Chardin Perfia, â€” ' ~ ' with Salr, and that there was enough for twice as many if there were occafion. Thefe Salt-Pits are fupply'd without any Charges: For they only let in the Water into the Merfh 5 which-is a fat and hard Earth at the bottom. here it con geals and becomes a white Salt, which has all the good dua lities of Salt, and among the reft that it preferves the Moi- fture of Salted Meats. They only pay Three Shillings a Day to thofe that they employ to lade the Salt, without any fur ther Examination how much they carry away. About a Mile from the Shoar there is a Habitation of the Tartars ; whither I went with fome of my Servants to buy Provifions, but I did not lee in all that place above Ten or Twelve Houfes with a little Mofquee. Only round about it there was a great Number of Tents, Round and Square very well clos'd, together with feveral Wagons clofe and cover'd, which ferve 'em in ftead of Houfes. The faireft of their Tents were very handfome, being made of Round Poles lay'd a crofs one upon another, and cover'd without with large Furs very light and well ftretch d. The Door is made after the lame Manner, with an opening at the Top, for the Light to come in, and the Smoak to go out. The Door is (hut with a piece of Felt. The infide is Hung with Tapeftry, and the Floor cover'd alfo with the fame. Every Family has one Tent of the fame Falhion and two others. The other is coVer'd with a great Sarpler of Wooll, for their Cattel and Horfes. The other cover'd with the fame, but not fo handfome, and much larger ; in the midft of which is a round Pit five Foot deep and two Foot wide, and there it is that they drefs their Vitrles. Here their Slaves lie, and here they keep their Pro- vi/ions for the Family. The ftore up their Corn and their Forrage, as do all the Country People in the Eajl, in deep Pits under Ground which they call or Maga zines. Which they cover fo exaftly, that you cannot difcern where they have remov'd the Earth, fo that only they that made the Pits can tell where to find 'em. The thefe Pits either in their Tents or in the Field *, and as I have faid they qover thefe Pits lb like the reft of the furface of the Earth round about it, that you cannot perceive w here they broak the Ground. When they remove their Quarters, they do it prefently and without any Trouble ; their Tents being pull'd down and lad'n in lefs then Half an Hour. Their moft ufual Carriage is by Oxen and Horfes of which they breed a Great Number. The People profefs the Mabumtan Religionthrough the Blacic-Sea, and c/Colchis. but intcrmix'd with ilraage Supci ftitions and Ridiculous Opi nions of Fortune Telling and Divination. The 2d of September the Wind blew hard and contrary, fo that we were conftrain'd to return for in regard'the Coaft where we lay was very dangerous. The Seventh at Midnight we put again to Sea with fair Weather,which did not long continue For in the Morning role a moft furious Tempeft, infomuch that we were afraid of be ing caftaway; and that which encreas'd our fears was this, that our Veflel was very deep Loaden, not only the Hold be ing full, but Twelve Foot High above Deck. But the Storm, thanks be to God, was foon over, and that which fav'd us was this, that the Wind was with us. (Our Ships Lading confrfted in Salt, FiiTi, Oy!, Bilcuite, Wooll, Iron, Tin, Copper Copper and Eaithen Ware, in all forts of Harnefs, Arms, Utenfils of Husbandry, Cloth, Linnen of all Colours Habits for Men and Women, Coverlets, Carpets, Leather, Boots and Shooes, and in a' word in all things moft neceflary for Mans Life. There were all forts of Grocery and Pothecary's Ware, Spices, Perfumes, Drugs and all manner of Oyntments.) So that the Veifel feem d to be a little Town, where every thing was to be had ; befides the People that were aboard, to the Number of a Hunderd. The 8th in the Morning we difcover'd the Coafts that bound the Lake Uxotis , which were very High Lands about 30 Miles diftant from us. In the Evening we found our felves near Cape Cuodos which Ptolomy calls llioutingout far into the Sea j the flioar being all very High Land, and feen a great way off! From Cafa to this Point, we fail'd all along in the Channel, from whence to we always kept along by the Ihoar. It is Six and Twenty Mile from to the Channel of the Lake M^otis. The Country on each fide is all in SubjeÂ£H- on to, and inhabited by the 'Ta but fo very thinly that all the Coaft is like a delert. From the Channel of the TalusM.totis to Mingrelia they reck'n it Six Hunderd Miles along the Coaft, which confifts ofplealant Mountains cover'd with Woods, inhabited by the whom the Turks call Cherks. By the Ancients they were generally call'd Za- geans, as alfo Mountaineers. 'Pomponious calls 'em gacians. They are neither the Subjects of the Qort, nor Tri butary to it; their Climate being very bad, cold and moift itThe Trawls of Sir John Chard in into Perfia, it produces no Wheat, nor indeed does it afford any thing that is i are and valuable ; which is the teafon that the Turks leave all this vaft Country to the Natives, not worth theToyl of Conquering, nor the Charge of Keeping. The Veffels that are bound from Conjiantinople and Caff a for caft An chors in feveral places along thefe Coafts, and ftay at every place a Day or two : During which time they Trade with the Cherkjwith their Arms i' their Hands.) For when any of them defire to come aboard, they give Hoftages, and fo they likewile do when any of the Seamen or Perfbns in the Ship defire to go aflioar, which is very leldom, for they are a very perfidious People : and therefore they give three Hoftages for one. The Seamen carry thither all the very lame Commodi ties which they carry into Mingrelia for which they take in Exchange Slaves of all Sexes and Ages ; Honey, Wax, Lea ther, and CW^/-Skins; which is a Beaft like a Fox, but much bigger. Xerdavas, which is a Furr that relenlbles a 'Martin j with the Furrs of other Beafts that breed in the Mountains of Circajpa. Which is all to be had among theie People. They Exchange their Commodities after this man ner : The Ship-Boat Rows clofe to the Shoar, and they that are in it are well arm'd. Nor will they fuffer a greater Num ber of Cherl\! to come nearer the place where the Boat lies then they themlclves are : For if they lec a greater Number approach, they prefently put out to Sea. When they are come fo near as to talk one to another, they fhew their Commodities, agree up on the Barter to be made, and prefently make the Exchange : however it behoves 'em to ftand upon their Guard all the while: For the are Infidelity and Perfidy it felf5 and it is an Impolllbility for em to find an Opponunity to fteal, but they take their Advantage. They are a People altogether Savage : formerly Chriftians; but now of no Religion, nor having fo much as the Light of Nature among 'em. For I look upon their Superftitious Cu- ftoms as nothing ; which feem to be a Mixture borrow'd from the Chriftians and Mahumetans their Neighbors. They live in Wooddcn Huts, and go almoft Naked. Every Perfon is a fworn Enemy to thole that live in the Provinces round about 'em. The Inhabitants make Slaves one of another, and fell one another to the Turty and Ta And for their Ground the V V omen I ill and Manure it. The and their Neigh bors live upon a kind of Pafte made of a very finall Grain like to Millet: and they who have Traffick along thele Coaftsthrough the Black-Sea^ and Colchis. will tell ye a Thoufand Stories of the Barbarous Cuftoms of thefe People. Howevei: there is no fafety in believing the Reports which are fpread abroad either of thofe that live upon the Sea-Coafts, or of thofe that inhabit farther up in the Coun try ; in regard that no body travels thither^ and all that we know is by means of the Slaves that are brought from thence who are all meer Savages^ from whom there is nothing to be learnt of Certainty. This is the realbn why I have made no more Defcriptions of Places in my Map of the which is at the beginning of this Book, chufing rather to leave a fpace for the Circafpans and void, then to fill it up upon the Credit of People fo illiterate, who for the moft part can hardly tell the North from the The Abca's border upon the Cherts, poffefling about a Hun- derd Miles of the Sea-Coaft between and However they aie not altogether fo much Savages as the Cberks, but they are equally inclin'd with to Thieving and Robbery. The Seamen alfo Trade with 'em, With the fame Precautions as with their Neighbors already mention'd. They ftand in need of the fame Commodities as their Neigh bors, and make their Exchanges in Slaves, Furrs, Does and Tigres Skins, Linnen, Thread, Box, Wax and Honey. The i oth of September We arriv'd at i Which is a Road belonging to Mingrelia, pretty fafe in the Summer; and there the Velfels that Trade into lie 5 fo that We faw feven great Ships there, when we arriv'd in the Road, Pre- fently our Captain faften'd his own Veffel to four Anchors, two at the Prow and two at the Poop, and carry'd his Marts and his Yards a (hoar. As for l/gaour it is a defeit place without any Habitations: only according to the Number of Traders that come thither, they build up Huts and Booths of Boughs, as they find themfelves (ecure from the which does not often happen. But befides thofe Huts, there is not one Houfe to be feen. Now before I enter into the Relation of the Hardfliips which I fuffer'd, and the Dangers I underwent in Mingrelia, I fltall give ye a Delcription of the Country and Parts that border about if, without intermixing any thing Dubious, of what I have not learnt by exaÂ£t Information. Colchis is fituated at the end of the To the it is enclos'd with a little Kingdom, which makes a part of Georgiaj which by the People of the Country is call'd lmmtta y byThe Travels of Sir John Chardin into Perfia, by the Turks, Pacha tchcouk^ or K^ouichoul^ as much as to fay, the Little Prince: to the by the 'Blacl^Sea ; to the ifeji, by the Jbca's ; and to the by Mount Cattca- fiu. In length it lies between the Sea and the Mountains j in breadth, it extends from the Abca to the Kingdom of ta. The Corax and Fhafts, famous Rivers in Ancient Hiftory, at pre lent call'd Codours and Rionc, ferve for its Bounds 5 while the firfi: parts it from the Abcas the fecond from Imiretta. The length of Colchis is a Hunderd and Ten Miles at moft. the breadth Sixty. Which I know to be true, not only by the concurring Report of the People of the Country, but alfo as having crols'd it my felf from one end to the other. It was formerly Fortifi'd againfl; the Abc by a Wall Sixty Miles in length, which has been laid in Ruines thefe many Years : So that now the Thick Forefts are its chiefeft Defence, and its greateft Security. The Inhabitants of Caucafus, that border upon Colchis, are the Aland's, whofe Country was formerly the Northern Frontier of Armenia the the the Caracioles or Cara-cherks ' a ^ orC People more Barbarous then their Names. Thefe Cara-cherh/-, as they are call'd by the Turk/, that is to fay, the Ulach^ Circa (pens, are the Northern Circajp* arts. The Turks lo cill 'em, though they are the faireft Peo ple in the World, by reafon of the Foggs and Clouds that continually dark'n their Skie. Formerly they were Chriftians; and fome Relicks of their Cuftoms they retain, and fome cer tain Ceremonies alfo they obferve, yet at prelent they pro- fefsno Religion, but live by Robbery and Rapine, utterly ig norant of all Arts and Sciences, and having nothing that may entitle 'em to Humanity, but their Speech. They are much taller and more portly then other People ; fo furious in their Looks, and fpeaking with fuch a terrible Tone, that you may eafily thence difcern their Difpofitions and their Courage to be no lefs favage Their very Countenances are frightful to look upon ; more efpecially when you come to experience their Civility, and underftand 'em to be the moft refolute f a JP ns -&gt; an&lt; ^ daring Robbers in the World. The Ancient Kingdom of Colchis was not fo fmall a Kingdom as now; for it extended on the one fide to the M&lt;eotk, and the other way as far as Iberia. The Capital City was alfo call'd Colchis, feated at the Mouth of Shafts upon the Weftern fide of the River, and that was the Reafon that was foirnerly call d Colchis $ for that Mingrelia is bounded by this River, to the Eajl, Our Modern have feated ano therthrough the Black-Sea, and Colchis, ther City which they call Faffo, in the place where flood 5 but this I know my felf to be a grand Miftake. All the Oriental People call and the ans Mngrelians ; though I could never underftand the Ety mology of either of thofe Words. The Country it felf is unequal i full of Hills and Mountains, Valleys and Plains, which caufes great variety of Profpeft, and it rifes infenfibly from the Sea-flioar. It is almoft all over cover'd with Woods^ except the Fields that are Manur'd, which are not very many ; and befides, the Woods are fo thick and tall, and the Trees grow fo faft, that if they did not grub up the Roots that fpread themfelves into the Titt'd Land, and the High-ways, the whole Country in a fliort time would be nothing but a Thick Foreft altogether Impaflable. The Air is temperate as well in re- fpeft of the Heat as Cold, but very moift and very unwhol- fom in regard of the extream wet Weather j for it rains there almoft perpetually. In Summer the Moifture of the Earth, being heated by the Sun, infers the Air, and caufes not only frequent Peftilences, but feveral other Diftempers and Dif- eafes. Therefore infupportable to Strangers. For it reduces 'em to a Ghaftly Leannels, and renders em in a Years time yellow, juiceleis and faint. The Natives of the Country,more us'd to the Climate, are not fo much incommoded by it, for the time that: they live, which is feldom above Threefcore Years. Colchis abounds with Water-Streams, which fall from the Mountains of CaHcafut^nddifcharge themfelves into the Sea. The Principal Rivers are Codours, which is that Corax I have already mention'd, the which I take to be the Terfcen of Arrian, and the Thaffem of Vtolomy ; the call'd by the Ancients Afiolphm j the Cobi, by call'd Cobo, which before it enters into the Sea, meets with another River call'd Gatiifcari, which was the Ancient The Tacheur which Jrrian calls Sigamus 5 The that is to lay. The Q{iver Horfe, fo call'd from the Rapidnefs of its courfe, and which the Greeks for the fameRealon call HippM i and the Abafcia to which Strabo gives the Name of GUncus, Arrian that of Caries, and Vtolomy that of Car it us. Thefc two Rivers intermix with Thafis, about Twenty Miles from the place where it difcharges it felf into the Sea. I have fet down as we ^ the Ancient as Modern Names of the Rivers r in regard that all the Hiftorical Geographers, efpecially Arrian, and feveral of the Moderns place 'em ill. But befides thefe Rivers there are are fome others of IdFer note j of which IThe Trawls of Sir John Chardin into Perfia, I fay no more, for that before they fall into the Sea, they lofe themfelves in thofe larger Torrents already mention'd. The Soyl of Colchis is very bad, and produces little Corn or Pulfe. The Fruits are altnoft all wild, without any tafte, and very unwholfom j and yet there grow in almoft as many forts as we have in France. They have alfo very large Melons, but they are worth very little or nothing. The only Fruit that thrives beft in this Country are their Grapes ; of which there is great Plenty. The Vines grow about the Trees, and run up to the very Top of the Boughs. I have feen fome Stocks of thefe Vines that have been fo large, that I could hardly compafs 'em with both my Arms. They prune their Vines every four Years, and as for the Wine of I mud needs lay it is moft excellent. It is ftrong, and has a very good Body ; pleafing to the Tafte, and comfortable to the Stomach. Nor do I know where there is better in any part of Afta. So that if the Country People knew how to make Wine fo well as we do, theirs would be the beft in the World. But they never take any pains at all with it. They only hollow the larger Trunks of great Trees, which they make ufe of in Head of Tubs. In thofe they bruife and fqueezc the Grapes, and then pour out the Juyce into great Earthen Jarrs, which they bury in their Houfes, or elfe hard by. Thele Veflels contain about two or three Hunderd Quarters. And when the Veflel is full, they clofe it up with a Woodden Co ver, and then lay the Earth upon it. For indeed they cover thefe Urns juft after the lame manner as I have told ye that the Eaftern People cover the Pits where they flore up their Corn. The Earth is fo moift in Min in Seed-time, that for fear of fbftning too much the Land where they fow their Wheat and Barley, they never Plough it at all. They only caft their Grain upon the Top of the Earth, and that is fuffi- cient: for it comes up without any farther trouble, taking root a foot deep in the Mould. The moreover affirm, That (hould they Plough their Ground where they fow their Barley and Wheat, it would be fo loft that the leall: Wind would lodge the Stalks, fo that they would never be able to rife again. Their other Lands they plough, and low their other Grain with Ploughs and Ploughlhares of Wood, which make however as deep Furrows as if they were of Iron, by reafon of the foftnefs and moifture of the Earth, as I have already faid. Theitthrough the Black-Sea, and Colchis. 'S , - â–  ' â€” Their ufual Grain Is Gam .â€¢ which is a fort of Grain as fmall as Coriander Seed, and very much refembles Millet. Which they fow in the Spring-time after the fame manner as they do Rice : for they make a Hole in the Ground with their Finger, then put in the Grain and cover ir. This Grain produces a Stalk about the bignefs of a Mans Thumb, and grows up as hifth as tnoft Men are tall ; at the end of which there is an Ear that contains above Three Hunderd Grains : And indeed the Gpm-Stilk 'is very like to the Sugar-Cane. They gather this Grain in O&amp;ober , arid prefentfy lay it upon high Hurdles expos'd to the Sun i which they do to dry it. After it has been Twenty Days upon the Hurdles, they bind it up iti Sheaves; but they thrafli it ohly as they have occafion to boy! it, and they never boyl ir, but juft before they go to eat it! It is ihfipid and heavy. Yet is it prefehtly boyl'd, and in lefs then half an hour after it is put into the Water, they ftir it ifoftly with a Stick; and after it has flood never fd little upon the Fire, it turns into Paft. When the Grain is all dillblv d, and the Paft well wrought together, they leffen the Fire, let the Water boyl away; and the Paft harden and dry in the Skellet where it was boyl'd. This Paft.is Very white \ and fome there is, Which they make as white as Snow. They ferve it upon little Woodden Peels made on purpofe. And this fort of Bread the call Fajia, theMingrelianf) Gomi, being eafilyBrok'n between the Fingers: but it is of a very cold and laxative Quality; nor is it worth any thing, after it is once bold, or when it is heated i fecond time. However the Circajfians , arid who are Tributary to the Turk^,the the Tsiountaineers of Caujcafqs, and all that inhabit the Goalls of the BlacJ^-Sea ftbm the Lake Meotis to Trehifon live ill upon this Paft. 'Tis all the Bread they have, nor have they any other ; and indeed they are lb accuftom'd to it, that they prefer it be fore Bread made of Wheat, as I have obferv'd in moft parts of thofe Countries which I have feert. Nor do I wonder at it j for when Necefllty conftrain'd me to make it my Food, 1 found it fo acceptable to my Palate, that I could hardly leave it, when I came where 1 met with our ufual Bread. Befides, I found my (elf very well; and my Body in a better Condition ofHealth then before. In Armenia and I faw a great many of the Turfyfb and Georgian Lords, and among the reft the Prince of fifths and the Hajha of who fent for this Gram irid eait it for a tielicacy I but it requires good ftore olThe 'Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, of Wine to wafli it down, to correct and temper its cold and laxative Qnalicy. Befides this Gom^ they have in Mingrelia great plenty of Millet, fome Rice, with Wheat and Barley, but very fcarce* The People of Quality many times eat Wheaten Bread for a Dainry j but the meaner fort never (b much as tafte of it. The ordinary Food of the Country is Beef and Pig of which latter they have an extraordinary plenty, and thatfo good that the World docs not afford better. There is alfo Goats flelh, but very lean, neither is it well tailed. Their Wild-Fowl is very good, but very fcarce. While I was there, there was hardly any to be got, by realbn that the Wars had harals'd all the Country. For Filh, there is none but Salt-Fifli, which is brought from Turkey-,Tunny Fifli, and lome few fmall Quantities of other Fifli at certain lealons of the Year. Their Venizon in Mingrelia is the Wild Boar, the Hart, the Stag, the Fallow Deer and Hare : which is lb excellent that there can not be better Food. Partridge they have alio, Pheafants and Quails in abundance, forae River-Fowl, and Wild Pigeons, which are very good Meat, and as big as ourCramm'd Chicken. The Mingrdians catch thefe Pigeons with Nets, and take great Numbers of 'em in Autumn ; for in the Winter they return to the Mountains of Caucafus. The Nobility , of Mingrelia fpend their whole time in the Field : and their chiefeft delight is in Birds of Prey, which they tame and afterwards make ufe of for their fport. And indeed it may be truly faid that thefe Birds of Prey are no where in the World in greater Numbers then in as Lanner-Hawks, Gos-Hawks, Hobbies and others, which build and breed in Mount Caucaftts. The young Ones, as foon as they are fledge, refort to the Forefts round about, where they take great Numbers, and reclaim 'em in five or fix days. But of all their Flights, that which yields the moft delight ful Paftime, is that of the Faulcon at the For River- Fowl and Pheafants they only make ufe of their Sparrow-Hawks. To which purpole, as. they do in and they carry a little Drum at the Pummel of their Saddles to put up the Wild-Fowl with the Noife, and then let fly their Hawks at the Game. When they take any Herons, they only cut off' the Feathers upon their Heads to make Heron Tufts for Bonnets, and then let 'em go again : for the People of the Country af firm, that the Feathers grow again as fair and as beautiful as they were at firft. Befides the Fowl already nam'd, and which â€¢ arethrough the Black-Sea, and of Coklus, are to be found in Utngnlm, there are other ftrange Fowl as well for their Shape as Feathers, altogether unknown in our parts 5 and not only thofe, but a great Number of Eagles and Pelicans. A'J which Caucafus produces, befides a great Num- ber of Wild Beafts as Tigres, Leopards, Lyons, Wolves and Chacallf, which are Creatures much refembling Foxes' only that they are much bigger, and their Hair is much more thick and lhaggy: and lome will have this Chacal to be the Hy*m of the Ancients. For it digs up dead Bodies, and devours both living Creatures and Carrion. They bury their Dead in the Eaftern Country without Coffins, only in their Windina- Sheecs. And therefore I have feen 'em in fome parts rowl great Stones over the Graves of the Deceas'd, only for fear of thefe Beafts to prevent 'em from digging up the Graves, and devouring the dead Bodies. For is full of thefe Cha- calls and Wolves 5 infomuch that they befet the very Houfes themfelves, where they make a moft dreadful howling Noife. The worft is, they make moft terrible Havock among their Cattel and Horfes. The Superiour of the Theatins aflur'd me, that in one VVeek the Wolves eat him up three Horfes and a Colt, clofe by the Houfe. There are a great Number of Hories, and very good ones too, in Mingrelia, of which every Man has a great many in regard they coft em little or nothing to keep. For as foon as they alight, they take off their Bridles and Saddles, and turn 'em a Field : Nor do they ever Shooe 'em, or give 'em any other Food or Provender, then what they graze of them felves. In UitjgrelU are neither Cities nor Towns, only two Vil- ages by the Sea-fide: But all the Houfes are icattcr'd fb thick up and down in the Country ; that you fliall hardly travel a Mile, but you {hall meet with Three or Four together. There are alio Nine or Ten Caftles, of which the chiefeft is call'd fycs where the Prince of Mwgrelia keeps bis Court. This Caftle is furrounded with a Stone-Wall, but fo ill built 'and fo thin, that the leaft Field-Piece will make its way through it: however there are fome few Cannon within it; but the reft ot the Caftles have none at all: being all built after this manner. In fome level and open place in a Wood, they ereft a Stone- rower about Thirty or Forty Foot High, fufficient to contain rilty or Sixty Perlbns. Thisisthe ftrongeftpartof the Tower, where they fecure all the Treafure of the Lord, and of rhofe thatThe frawls of Sir John Chardin Perfia, . ' , v . i ' â–  i â–  that defire his Proteaion. Clofe by this, ftand Five or Six other Towers built of Wood, much lower then the middle- moft, which are the Store-Houfes for their Provifion and where they put their Wives and Children, when they happen at any time to be affaulted. Befide which there are within the compafs of the open place, leve'ral Hutts made ot Carpen ters Work i others, with Boughs of Trees, others of Canes ind Reeds. The fpace is enclos'd with a very thick Hedge and with the Wood it felf, which is fo thick that it is impoffi- ble to come near thofe retirements but by the way which is cut open on purpofe. Which paflagej when they are afraid of art Enemy, they dig up and cover with Trees, that 'tis impoffible to be forc'd Nor do the Colchians ever retire to thefe Caftles, but when they are in fear of an Enemy j for when the dan ger is paft they return to their Houfes. The Houfes in Mingreha are all of Carpenters Work ; and Building is very cheap, by reafon of the great Plenty of Wood. Of thefe Houfes, the Poorer fort contain but one Story: nor have thofe of the Gentry and Nobility themfelves above two. The lower Rooms are always furnifli'd With Beds and Cou ches to lie down and fit upon, by reafon of the great Moifture of the Earth. The Perfons of Quality fit upon Carpets, the meaner fort upon Forms. But their Houfes are very inconve nient and Nafty j as having neither Chimneys nor Windows. The Fire place is in the middle, and the light comes in at the Door. Their Houfes ate built upon no Foundations, which is the reafon that they are eafily Rob'd. For the Thieves dig a hole under the firft Beam that lyes upon the Ground, and fupports all the reft of the Fabrick, and fo creep into the Houfe. And as fooh as the People begin to ftir,they get out again with the fame eafe. Which Inconvenience conftrains the Country Peo ple to have no riiore then one Room for every Family. Where they keep all that they have about 'em, except their Corn, and fometimes their Wine. So that they lie all together, and Houfe their Cattel in the Night. Mingrelia breeds very good Blood j So that the Men are very well fliap'd, and the Women very handfome. Thofe that are of any Quality carry always in their Countenances fome certain Features and Graces that are very Charming. I have feen fome wonderfully well (hap'd, that have had a very Majeftick Air, with an Alp eft and Proportion much to be admir'd. Befides, they have thofe Obliging Glances, that #in thfi Affections of all that behold 'em, and feem as it werethrough the Blaciv-Sea, an cy r Colchis. to command their ! ove. They that are not fb handfomej or in years, paint abominably, Colouring their Eyebrows, their Cheeks, Foreheads, Nofes and Chins; but the refi: only paint their Eyebrows- T hey drels themfelves with all the curiofity they can. Their Habit is like that of the; but their Head-Attire is much like that of the Women, ev'n to thecurlingof their Locks. 1 hey wear a Vail that covers ly the Top and Hinder part of the Head. They are naturally very fuhtie and of clear and quick Apprehenfions. Extream- ly Civil, full of Ceremonies and Complements j but other- wile the wickedeft Women in the World, Haughty, Furious, Perfidious, Deceitful, Cruel, and Impudent. So that there ij no lort of VVickednels which they will not put in Execu tion, to procure Lovers, preferve their Afte&amp;ion, or elfe to deftroy 'em. The Men are endu'd with all thefe Mifchievous Qualities with fome Addition. There is no VVickedne(s,to which their Inclinations do not naturallv carry 'em. But all addicted to Thievery. That, they make their ftudy; that, they make their whole Imployment, their Paftime and their Glory. AfTafli- nation, Murder and Lying are among them efteem'd to be no ble and brave Anions. But for Concubinage,Adultery,Bigamy, Inceft,and all Vices of that Nature^hey are Vertues inMingrelia. They make nothing to take away one anothers Wives by force: and they Marry their Aunts, their Nieces, and their Wives Sifters without any Scruple. He that has a mind to two Wives at a time, marries 'em without any more ado : and many there arc that will have Three. Every Man keeps as many Concubines as they pleafe; the Wives never grudging their Husbands that convenience : for there is feldome any luch thing as Jealoufie among 'em. If a Man take his Wife in the aft with her Gallant, he has a Priviledge to compel him to pay him a Pig by way of fatisfaftion ; which they eat all Three together: and generally that is all the revenge the Per- fon injur'd takes. But this is the greateft: Wonder, that this Wicked Nation fiiould maintain, that to have feveraJ Wives and Concubines is juftifiable : for lay they, they bring us many Children, which we fell for ready Money or Exchange for neceflary Conveniences. Which is nothing to another moft Inhuman Tenent of theirs, that it is a piece of Charity to Murder Infants newly Born, when they have not fufficient wherewith to maintain 'em ,or fuch as are Sick and paft hopes of recovery. And the realbn they give is this, that by fo Z doingThe Travels of Sir John Chardiii into Perfia, 'doing, they putthofe ChiUern out of a great deal of Mifery which they would undergo in a languifliing Dutempei, which in the end muft of neceffity carry 'em off. Such are the Ar- Lniments of thefe Barbarous People that have neither fname, nor Humanity. I am afraid to tell the Truth, left Hiftory fhould want belief in this particular, or that the Truths which I recount {hould be look'd upon as the Exorbitances of Rela tion. But I aver 'em to be really true, as fome adHom which f (hall recite, will fufficiently juftifie. The Gentlemen of the Country have full Power over the Lives and Eftates of their Tenants, with whom they do what they pleafe. T hey feize upon 'em, whether Wife or Chil dren ; they fell'em, or difpofe of'em otherwifeas they think fit. Every Country-Man furnifhes his Lord with fb much Corn, Cartel, Wine, and other Provifions, as he is able. So that their Wealth confifts in the Number of their Vaflals. Be- fides, everyone is oblig'd to entertain his Lord Two or Three days in a Year at their own Expences. Which is the reafon that the Nobility,fo long as the Year lafts,go from one place to another devouring their Tenants, and fometimes the Tenants of other Men. The Prince himfelf leads the fame Life, fo that 'tis a hard matter every day to know where to find him. When the Vaffals of feveral Lords are at difference, their Mafters decide the difpute: but when the Lords are at variance among them- felves, force and main ftrength determine the Quarrel, and the ftouteft Arm gets the better. There is not a Gentleman in Min- grelia but has fome quarrel or other. And therefore it is, that they always go arm'd, and as numeroufly attended as they can. When they ride, they are arm'd at all Points, and their fol lowers alio i nor do they ever fleep without their Swords by their fides and when they go to Bed, they fleep upon their Belleys, laying their Swords under 'em. Their Arms are a Lance, Bow and Arrows, a ftreight Sword, a Mace and a Buckler j but there are very few that carry Fire Arms. They are very good Souldiers, fit a Horfe very well, and handle their Lances with an Extraordinary Dexterity. Their Habit is peculiar ^ and unlefs they be the Ecclefiaftical Perfons, they wear but very little Beard. They Shave all the Top of their Heads in a Circle, fuffering the reft of their Hair to grow down to their Eyes, and then clip it round of art even length. They cover their Heads with a light Cap of Fek â– f tetythrough the Black-Sea, and Colchis. Very thin par'd, and ciic into feveral Half-Moons about the Edges. In the VVinter they wear a furr'd Bonnet i They are moreover fo beggarly and fo Wretched, that for fear of fpoiling their Caps or their Bonnets in the Rain, they will put 'em in their Pouches, and go Bare-Headed. Over their Bodies they wear little Shirts, that fall down to their Knees, and tuck into a ftreight Pantaloon. Nor indeed is there any habit in the World more deformed then theirs, Thev carry a Rope feve- ral Fadoms long at their Girdles, to tye together fuch People or Cattel which they Rob from their Neighbours, or take in War. The Nobles wear Leathern Girdles Four Fingers broadi full of Silver Studs, at which they hang a Knife, a Whet- ftone, and a Steel to ftrike Fire; together with Three Lea thern Purfes, the one full of Salt, the other of Pepper, and the other with Pack-Needles, Leffer-Needles, and Thread. The Poor People go almoft naked i fuch is their Mifery not to be parallell'd; as not having any thing to cover their Nakednels but a pityful forry Felt like to the Ancients; into which they thruft their Heads, and turn which way they pleafe as the Wind fits i for it covers but one fide of their Bo dies, and falls down no lower than their Knees. There are fome, chat are par'd very thin to keep out the Water, which are not fo heavy as the common fort, that are readv to weigh a Man down,efpecially when thorough wet. He that has a Shirt and a pair of pitiful Drawers, thinks himfelf Rich j for almoft all of 'em go Bare-Foot; and fuch of the Colchians as pretend to Shooes, have nothing but a piece pf a Hide, and that untann'd too ; which piece of raw Hide is lae'd about their Feet with a Thong of the fame ; fo that for all thefe fort of Sandals, their Feet are as durty, as if they went Bare-Foot. Almoft all the Mingrelians, both Men and Woriieri, even the moft noble and wealthy,never have but one Shirt,and one pair of Breeches at a time i which laft 'em at leaft a Year: Iri all which time they never wafli 'em above Three times: only Once or Twice a Week they {hake 'em over the Fire, for the Vermin to drop off^ with which they are mightily haunted j and indeed, I cannot fay l ever faw any thing fo Nafty and Loathfome. Which is the reafon that the Ladies carry a very bad (cent about 'em. I always accoafted 'em, extreamly taken with their Beauty 5 but I had not been a Mi nute in their Company,but the Rank Whiffs from their Skins &lt;|uite ftifl'd allniy Atriordus Thoughts;'The Tt ravels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, The Grandees Eat, fitting upon Carpets, after the manner of the Eaftern People Their Napkin is only a piece of painted Cloath, or Leather, and fometimes they only wipe upon the Boards. The Ordinary fort fit upon a Form, with another Form before 'em of the fame height, which ferves for a Table. Ail their Dillies are of Wood to their very Drinking Cups j only among the People of Quality you tfull fee a little Silver Plate. Moieo\er it is the cuftome in this Savage Country, that the whole Family without Jiftinaion, Males and Females, Eat all together. The King with all his Train to his very Grooms. TheQneen, her Women, Maids, Servants and all, to the very L acqueys that attend her. When it does not rain, they Dine in the open Courts, where they rank rhem- felves, either in a Circle, or fide by fide , one below ano ther, according to their Quality. If it be cold weather they make great rowfing Fires in the Court where they eat 5 for Wood-Fifing cofts nothing in that Country, as I have faid al ready. When they are fate down. Four Men, if the Family be great, bring upon their Shoulders a large Kettle full of or Grain boyl'd as I have already related 5 of which, rnoft ufn- ally a Poor beggarly half-Naked Rafcal ferves upon a Wooden Plate, to every one his proportion, which weighs full Three Pound. Afterwards two other Servants, fomewhat but not much better equipp'd, bring in another Kettle full of Grain more white than the other j which is only for the better fort. Upon Worky-Days they never give but only to the Ser vants, the Mafters being ferv'd with Pulle, or dry'd Fifliroa- fted, or elfe Flefli. On Holy-Days or when they make enter tainments. they kill either a Hog, or an Ox, or a Cow, efpe- cially if they have no Venlbn. As foon as they have cut the Throat of the Beaft, they drefs it, and fet it upon the Fire, without Salt, or Sauce, in the great Kettle where they boil their Part. When it has boyl'd a while, they take it from the Fire, throw away the Broth, and ferve it in half-raw, without any feafoning. TheMafler of the Houfe has always (landing be fore him a large Portion of this Vittles: They let before him likewife all the Pulfe, all the Bread, and all the Tame and Wild-Fowl. Who prefencly Carves for his Guefts and his Friends their fliare They feed chemfelves with their Fingers, and that fo naftily, that nothing but extremity of hunger could provoke the meaneft of our Europeans to Eat at the Tables of thofe Barbarians. When they have begun to Eat, therethrough the Black-Sea, an there are two Perfons, that ferve the Drink round the Table; Among the common fort, this Office is perform'd by Women or Maids. 'Tis the fame Incivilicy among rhem, to cali for Wine, as to refufe it. For they rmift ftay till it is prelented, and take ir, when 'tis giv'n 'eni. They never give leis then a Pint at a Draught; which at their Ordinary Meais is thrice done &gt; but at Feafts and Banquets^ the Guefts, and the Gentry Drink on till they are Drunk- The Mingrdians and their Neighbours are very Great Drinkers ; far exceeding the Germans-, and all the Northern People They never mix their Wine , bur Drink it pure, both Men and Women. Bat when they are once Heated, they think their Pints too little, and therefore Drink out of their Difhes, and out of the Pitcher k felf. While I lay near Cotatis, I lodg'd at a Gentleman's Houfe, who was one of the ftouteft Drinkers in all the Country ? and while I ftay'd at his Houfe, he made a Feaft for Three of his Friends i at what time they were all Four fo fet Upon Carowiuig, that from Ten in the Morning till Ten in the Evening, they Drank out a whole Charge of Wine, that weigh'd Three Hunderd Pound Weight. It is alfo a cuftom among thefe People, praftiz'd by all the World, to rife from the Table, and empty as often as they ha^e occafion, and when they return, they fit down without ever Wafliing their Hands. They provoke their Guefts and their Friends, as much as they can, to Drink', it being chiefly at the Table that they obferve Civility, and are free of their Complements. Their difcourfes between Man and Man^ are only Stories of their Robberies, their Wars, Duels, Mur ders, and Selling of Slaves. Neither is their difcourfe any bet ter among the Women : for they are pleas'd with all forts of Love-Tales, let em be never fo Obfcene, or never fo Lafci- vious: and their Children learn their filthy VVords and Phra- fes, aflbon as they can fpeak infomuch that by that time they come to be Ten Years of Age, all their difcourfe with the Women, is the moft beaftly that a Brothel-Houfe can utter. And certainly the Education of their Children in is the moft Vicious and Lewd in the World. Their Fa ther's bring em up to Thievery, and their Mothers to Ob- fcenity. Mingfelia is at prefent very much difpeopfd; there not be ing in it above Twenty Thoufand Inhabitants. Though it is not above Thirty Years ago, that there was no lefs then Fotir- fcore Thoufand; The eaufe of which JDecreafe proceeds front A thdf1 he ffdVtts of Sir John Ohardifl Pcrfia^ their Wars With their Neighbours, and the vaft number of People of both Sexes, which the Nobility have fold of late Years. For a long time there has been drain'd out of Mingreha every Year, either by Purchafe or Barter, above Twelve I hou- land Perfons all which are fold to the and Turks,there being none but they, that deal in that fort of Traffic in thofe parts. They carry Three Thoufand every Year diredly to Conjiantinnpk, which they have in Exchange for Cloth, Arms, and other things which they carry, as I have laid, into Mingrelia. To which purpofe there came every Year Twelve Sail of Ships from Conjian and CWfi/, and above Sixty Fchtqucs from Gorica, Trijf and The Com modities which they export from befides Slaves, are Silk,Linnen Thread, and VVov'n, Linfeed, Hides, Martins, Bea vers, Box, Wax and Honey. The Honey of Mingrelid is very Good; and there are two forts of it, the one Red, the other White; the White is not lb plentiful as the other, but it is much better and more Sweet; Sweeter indeed then refin'd Sugar, very delicious to the Tall, and Crumples between the Teeth Befides their Garden Honey, there is another lort is found in the Trunks aud Clefts of Hollow-Trees in great abun dance ; which the Velfels from Caffa carry into where they make a very ftrong Liquor of it, mix'd with Barley. The 7urksmake great profit of their Trade, lelling for Four, what they buy for one CroWn j but their greateft advantage is by their Slaves. Certainly the Inhumanity of thefe Mingrelians, their unna tural Cruelty toward their own Country Men, and particu larly of fome of 'em toward their own Flelh and Blood, are things hardly to be Credited. They Study Opportunities to fall out wi;h their ownVairals,meerly to find a Pretence to Sell em, with their Wives and Children. They force away their Neighbours Children from the Embraces of their Parents, to the fame end, and fometimes they will fell their own Chil dren, Wives and Mothers: And I have been IheWd feveral Gentlemen who have been fo Prodigioully Unnatural. One of thofe Gentlemen fold Twelve Priefts in one Day. In which Piece of Impiety there is one particular paflage fo ftrange, that it deferves to be related as an Example not to be Parallell'd. This Gentleman fell in Love with a I ady, whom he refol- Vd to Marry, tho he had a Wife already. To which pur- pofe he Courted the Lady, and obtain'd her Good Will. Now it is the Cuftom in Mingrelia, to purchafe their Wives, andthrough the Black^Sely and Vmntr) of Colchis; and they Buy em, according to their Qiiality, their Aoe, and their Beauty. Thereupon the Gentleman not knowing where to raile the Sum which he bad promisd for the Enjoyment of hisMiftrefs, nor to defray the Expences of his Wedding, but by felling of Slaves, and for that reafon reduc'd to Defpair bethought himfelf of a Piece of treachery, the moft Infa^ mous and Wicked that could be. To that purpofe he invited Twelve Priefts to his Houfe, to hear a Solemn Mafs and offef a kind of Sacrifice, upon which the Priefts went very Ghear- fully, never Dreaming that he intended to have fold 'em td the Turks, the like Pradice having never been heard of before in Mingrelia. The Gentleman on the other fide receiv'd 'era very Courteoufly, caus'd 'em to fay Mafs, and to offer an Ox, and afterwards gave 'em an Entertainment. But after he had made 'em to take a Hearty Cup, he caus'd his Servants to feizc em, Bind em, Shave their Heads and their Beards^ and the Night following carry'd 'em to a Turkifli Veffel, where he fold 'em for Houlhold Goods, and other Neceifaries, but finding he had not yet enough to pay for his Miftrefs, and his Nuptials! this Tyger went and fetch'd his own Wife, and fold her to the fame VeffeL All the Trade in Mingrelia is driv'n by way of Barter : for thereisnofetpriceof Money among the People: the curtail Money are the Piafters, Dutch Crowns, and Abajfe's, which are Pieces made mGeorgia, and Stamp'd with the ferfian Stamp, to the value of Eighteen Pence every Piece. 'Tis true that the Prince ot Hingrelia, who died about Twenty Years ago, be gan to Coy n Money of his own. But the Mint did not work long, in regard there was but little Silver brought into the Country, and for that the Country produces none at all, no more then it does Gold, or any other Nletal. I know not what is become of that Gold-Gravel, and Golden-Sand which the People fpong'd out of the Water with their Sheep-Skins, according to the Ancient Stories, and which gave occafion to the Fable of the Golden Fleece* There is no fuch thing in Colchis, nor in the Mountains or Rivers ad;oyning 4 So that which way foever ye go, there is.no poffibility of Reconciling Antiquity with the prefent Times. Mingrelia of it felf is not able to raife above Four Thoufand Men, fit to bear Arms 5 which are alfo all Cavalry for the moft part; there not being above Three Hundred Foot to joyn with thefe Horfemcn. Nor are the Souldiers Marlhall'd into Regiments and Companies. But every Lord , and every GentlemanThe Travels of Sir John Chardm Perfia, Gentleman, leads his own People to the Fight, without Or- der, without Ranks, without Officersj and they follow their Leader, whether it be in Flight, or to the Charge. The Wars of the Mingrelians, and their Neighbours, are indeed but meer Incurfions, and Boots-Halhigs ; and when they make their Inroads into the Enemies Country, they fall on with an Extraordinary Fury ; for they want neither Cou rage nor Refolution. When they have put the Enemy to Flioht, they vigoroufly follow the purfuit, and over-run all the'Country, Burn and Plunder all before 'em, carry away Prifoners of all Sexes and Degrees, and then retreat with the fame Impetuofity. They take as many Prifoners as they can ; fo that when they have Difmounted any one, prefently they leap from their Horfes, bind the Perfon Vanquilh d, with the Cords which they carry at their Girdles, as I have faid, and deliver 'em to the Cuftody of their Servants. He that has taken a Prifoner, has Power over him of Life and Death, he may difpofe of him as he pleafes i but generally they make 'em their Slaves, and fell 'em to the Turks. On the other fide, when thefe People are invaded, they (hew themfelves at the Ford of fome Piiver, where they lay their Musketeers in endeavouring to prevent the Enemies Paflage. At what time, if the Enemy forces his way, they fly to the Woods, leaving the Country to their Mercy : So that the Wars with thele People never laft long. In lefs then Fifteen Days the War is at an end, and the Enemy retreats, after he has ravag'd, and ranfackt all the Country. - The Revenues of the Prince of amount at rnoft, to no more then Twenty Thoufand Crowns a Year. Which arifes from the Cuftoms of what is Imported and Exported out of the Country, the Slaves which he fells, and his Impo- fitions and Fines. All this he lays up 5 for he is not at a Far thing Expence, for his Slaves ferve him for nothing, and his Crown Lands furnifh him with more Provifion for his Court then he can fpend. He often Prefents the King of with Falcons, and all forts of Birds of Prey. For which the King of Perfia fends him Rich Tiffues, Carpets, Tapeftries, Arms, all forts of Cups and Difhes, and fuch other Neceflaries, of which fuch a beggarly Prince as the Prince of may be thought to ftand in need.

I have leen it at a diftance; and it feem'd to be a very great Pile oi Building fo far as a Man may guefs a Mile off: 1 he iatholicos once in his Life goes thither to make the Holy Oyl, which the Greeks call Mirone. I never difcours'd of Re ligion with any Mingreltan, having never found any one that either knew what Religion, Law, Sin , the Sacraments, or Divine Service were. All I could learn was only this. That the Women fometimes light up fmall round Candles, which they fix to the Doors of their Houfes, or of fome Church where they burn at the fame time a Grain of Incenfe and turning toward the Sun, bow their Bodies very low feveral tunes, and crofs themfelves all over from Head to Foot. The Pnefts and Billiops perform the Ecclefiaftical Ceremo nies, fay Mafs, and Baptize. I have feen 'em at the perfor- mance of their Functions, when no Body has been prefent for want of Devotion. But in regard I did not underftand the language which they fpoke, I had rather in ftead of relating what I only faw and heard by report, recite what I met with out ot an Italian Manufcript concerning the Religion of the Mmgreliam and Georgians, written by Father a Mantuan. Superiour of ihe Theatws in Mtngrelta. For that Fryer who made me a Prefent of the Manufcript, had liv'd there wenty ^nree Years, and could not be ignorant either of their Geremonies or their Belief: which made him write at large his own knowledge of the Uinvtelian Piety. And this is that which he Ipeaks more particularly, and as it lies in the Manufcript. B b The~ The Tr^els of Sir John Charclin Perfia, 'SS/W/^fays he, arefall'n into the profoundeft Abyfi of lonorance and Darknefs, that the llnderftanding of Mart Was ever plung'd in : in regard the people have not the leaft yea of Faith or Religion; while the mod p rt look upon Lite Eternal, the Day of judgmcnr, and the Refurreaion of the Dead, to be meer Fables, and Humane Invention. Nor do the Clergy perform any Ecclefiaftical Duties, there being hard ly one of the whole Heard, that can either Write or Read. 'I hey have utterly loft the Knowledge of the true fervice of God : only the Priefts make a publick profeffion of foretelling thinos to come, and make the people believe that their Books do (hew 'em the fuccefs of future Events. With which Im- pofture the fAingrelians are fo obftinately bewitch d, that when any one falls fick, they call the Priefts, not to make Confef- fion of their Sins, or to Recommend their Souls to their Pray ers, which is the leaft thing that troubles the Patient, but to bid 'em look in their Books, and fee whether he (hall die of that Diftemper or no â€¢, to tell 'em the event and fuccefs of it, and what was the reafon that he was vifited with that Sick- nefs. Prefently the Piieft falls to turning over the Leaves of his Book which he carries along with him, and after he has turn'd 'em over and over, and over and over again, he pro nounces with the Voice of an Oracle, 1 hat fuch a (for fo theUingrelianscaW their Images; is angry with him, and has therefore ftruck'n him with that Difeafe ; nor will he be appeas'd without a good Prelent, which if he do not fend forthwith, the Image will certainly mine him. Which Pre- fent is to be either a Pig, or a Goat, or an Cx, or elfe Ready Money. The poor fick perfon upon this, being dreadfully afraid of death, fails not immediately to give the Priefts what they appoint for an Offering to the Idol, who divide the fpoil among themfelves; and in that manner couzen the poor fick perfon. The Catholkos of Mingrelia is the Head of all the Clergy of that Country, of the Abca's, of Citric!, of and Imiretta. Whom the Prince of appoints and depofes as he pleafes himfelf. His Pvevenue is very great, as having Four Hunderd Vaflals under him, who furnifh his Houfe with all Things neceflary for Human life, and many other Super fluities. He fells their Childern to the befides, and as it is his Imployment to vifit the Diocefles under his Jurifdi(5tion, he vifits em indeed, but it is not for the good of his Flock, ro inftrua the people, or to examine the Mifcarriages of the In- fcriourthrough the Black-Sea 7 and of Colchis; feriour Clergy â€¢ Thofe Cares never trouble his Brains nor lius Thoughts i but his main bufinefs is, to rake Money together, to fuck the Blood of the pdor people, and difpoil 'eiti of what they have. And as to the Train that attends this when he makes his Vifitations, it confifts of no lefs then Two Hunderd perlons. The outward San&amp;ity of this Pontiff confifts iti a continual abftinence from Flefh, and Wine only during Lent; and in long Prayers Day and Night. He is fo ignorant that he can hardly read his Breviary and Miffa And there is fo much to be faid concerning his Simony, that it would be a difficult task to make a true recital of it. I Ihall therefore fay no more then this, That he never Confecrates a Bifhop for lefs then Six Hun derd Crowns i that he never fays Mafs for the Dead, under Eight Hunderd i nor any other Maffes under a Hunderd Crowns a Piece. Not long fince the Prince of Vi zier, being fick, made his Confeffion to him, and gave him Fifty Crowns. Which theCatholicos took for fo final 1 a Re muneration, that upon the Viziers falling fick again, and fending for him to make a new Confeffion, he fent him word, that he fhould pay for his firfl Confeflion, and then he would come and hear what he had to fay. There are Six Bifliops in Mingre but thofe Prelates take no care of the Souls of their Flocks, nor do they ever vifit their Churches, or their Dioceffes. They fuffer the Priefis to live in all manner of Errours, and the People to proftitute themfelves to all manner of Vices i they underftand not the Form of Baptilm I they let Polygamy Raign, and permit the Mothers to Bury their new Born Childern alive. And thd they have been often reprov'd for fo much Cruelty more then Barbarous-, Rcmonftrances operate nothing upon 'em; this Inhumanity being become a Cuftom. The Clergy tolerates it, and the Prince near Prohibits any one that pleafes, froni putting it in pradtife. The chief Imployments of the Bifhops, is continual Feafting and Banqueting, where they are Drunk almoft every Day : they are Rich and go Sumptuoufl-yHabi ted their Principal Revenue arifing from what they Spunge from their Vafials, and the price of the Women and Childrenj which they fell to the Turks- They abftain from Flefh, after the manner of the Bifhops, and include the whole Chriftian Religion, within the pradtife of Fafting. They do not believe themfelves oblig'd to any other Duty ; but believe themfelves acquitted of all the preceptsThe Tramels of Sir John Chardin Perfia. j j Precepts of Chriftianity, by Fafting. Their Cathedral Church is indifferent neatly kept, and well adorn'd with Images, after the Grecian manner, drefs'd up and finifi'd with Gold and Jewels. They believe that in Beautifying their Images they (atiifie the Jnftice of God, and that the offering of a Jewei, to an Image wipes away all their Sins. And this is the way which they take, when they have offended themlelves. Their Apparel is very Magnificent,confidering the Country, being of Scarlet and Velvet. It differs little from the fecular Habit. That which makes the peculiar diftinftion between 'em, is the long Beard which they wear, with a black Bonnet Round and High, made after the Fafliion of the Grceh^ Monks. They wear Chains of Gold about their Necks, go a Hunting, and many times to the Warrs, where they Fight no lefs Cou- ragioufly at the Head of their Slaves, then the Gentry and Noble-Men. There are fome of 'em that are never Confe- crated, which nevertheleis does not hinder em from beftowing Orders, as if they were Confecrated. There are in Mingrelia, certain Monks of the Order of St. Hafil, which they call Berres, who wear the fame Habit as the GreehJsAonks, and obferve the fame manner of living. And a Child may be made one of thefe Monks by his Father and Mother only. 1 hey Confecrate him in his Infancy, by put ting, a black Bonnet upon his Head, fuffering his Hair to grow, hindering him from eating Flefh, and telling him upon all oc- cafions that he is a. 'Bene. All this while the fnfant under- ftands nothing more what belongs to his Condition, and all his Life long never minds any thing elfe but to obferve his Falls as others that bear the fame Title with himfelf. There are alio Nuns of the fame Order, who obferve Faft* ing Days, and wear a black Vail 5 but they have neither Nun neries,neither are they under any Vows or Subordination. They that have taken upon 'em to wear the Vail of Sandrity, and to obferve Faftrng, when they are weary of well-doino, quit their Habit and their 1 emperance, when they pleafe themfelves: tor that fame manner of living is wholly at their own difcre- tions, whether they be Maids, Wives or Widows ; whether -/ivorc j ^ ' et erFree or Slaves; no Condition is exempted trom tha t Liberty. r J h n Pt ^ nS of Mingnlia are very numerous 5 and a fort of ferabk Cicatures that live upon whatever they can get, and no morTr!' u' V Y pIeafe themfeIv Â«- There needs no more then to be able to read and fay a Mafs by Heart, to t bethrough the Blaclc-Seaj and Cokhis. be admitted into the Priefthood For the Blflidp hevGr exa mines thofe that he admits into Orders, being many times more ignorant then they : efpecially if the Prieft that defires to be admitted gives him the Value of a Horfe for his Ordina tion. God alone knows the lamentable Condition of thofe Miferable Priefts, and the Validity of their Priefthood ; for many times it is a gieat Queftion, whether they are Baptiz'd, and whether the Bilhops that Ordain em. Were ever Baptiz'd or Confecrated themfelves. Nor is it to be imagin d how thefe Priefts are contemn'd and fcorn'd. They Till their own, and the Lands of theit Lords, being no lefs Slaves then the Seculars 5 they follow 'em to the Wars, and carry their Baggage. Now that which caufes this Contempt is their Ignorance, their Gluttony and their Poverty. Their Poverty is fo great, that they go Barefoot, v and all in Tattars that hardly cover their Tails. So that there is no refpeft giv'n 'em but when they are fate down at Table j for then they are the firft to whom they offer Drink i and they defire'emto blefs the Wine and the Food when they fay Mafs; and at another time when they are fent for to vifit the Sick, and turn over their Books to know what Image the fick Party- has offended, and what Prefent will appeafe him. They are only diftinguiflvd from the Seculars by their Beards, which they let grow very long : for the Seculars wear hardly any at all. There are but few of their Churches which have any Bells, but they call the people together by knocking with a good big Stick upon a Board. The Images in the Cathedrals are very well drefs'd ; being encircl'd by the Offerings of the people, fuch as are Harts Horns, Boars Jaws and Tusks, Phea- fants Wings, and Weapons, to the end the Image fhould profper 'em in their Hunting and Wars The Parifh-Churches are more Nafty then Stables ; the Images mangl'd and brok'n, and cover'd over with Dull and Spiders. Their SanSimtt Santtorum is fo Nafty that I am afliam'd to (peak it. The Ornaments of the Altar are nothing but a tew Nafty Tatter'd Clouts, torn and ftain'd with Wine. Their Cup or Chalice is a Goblet of Wood as Nafty as may Well be itnagin'd 5 and the Cover of the Chalice is a Woodden Plate, as Nafty and as Greafie as the Chalice. When they haveoccafion they wipe it with the Curtain of the SanBttm SanileruM, which is yet more Nafty then all that has beeri said i and t fay the lefs, becaufe I would not offend the Rea der. But the Cathedrals are very clean and well adorn'd. C c AndThe Trawls of Sir John Ciiardin Perlla, And I could wifli, that every Bifliop had as much care of the Education and Inftruaion oi:' his Flock, as he has of the Clean- fing and Adorning his Church. The Worfhip which they pay to their Images, is an Ido latrous Worfliip. For they adore 'em not with a Relative Adoration, but pay their Devotion to the Material Subftance and Figure before their Eyes. The Images which are the fair-. eft, are the beft ferv'd, and moft devoutly ador'd : efpeci- ally thofe that are adorn'd with any thing that is coftly, as Gold; thofe that have moft Jewels and Pretious Stones but above all thofe that are reputed to be Cruel, eafily Provok'd, and apt to Kill thofe againft whom they are Incens'd. Which latter are ferv d with an incredible refpeft : For the People throw themfelves to the Ground, as far off as they can fee the Church that contains thofe Images; thump their Brefts, and befeech 'em to Kill their Enemies, and fuch as have Robb'd 'em of any thing. They are Horribly afraid to fwear by thofe re- ver'd Images, and when they do, there is no gainfaying fuch an Oath. For they believe whatever is fworn by thofe Ima ges. Some there are that will not call thefe Images to Wit- nefs the moft certain Truths, for fear of being Kill'd by 'em ; and they that do Swear, Swear only by thole that have a plea- fing, mild, fmiling Countenance, and are reputed neither Murderers nor Bloody-Minded. Nor do they Worfiiip thefe Images in hopes of any Spiri tual Advantages, or to obtain any Afliftance in order to a fu ture Life : For the Mingrelians acknowledge no other Life but their Prefent Being. And all that they do is meetly out of a Terrible and Servile fear, left the Images fhouid deprive 'em of theirLives, or Vex em withDifeafes, deliver'em over with their Goods, into the Hands of Thieves and Robbers, or the Fury of their Mafters, or fuffer 'em to be made Slaves to the Turks. When they have been Robb'd at any time, they go to the Church where ftands the Image in which they have moft Confidence, make it a prefent of two Loaves, and a Bottle of Wine, bow (everal times to it; and having driven a Stake in to the Earth before it, they Pray to it in this manner. know 0 Image, that I have been Goods, and that I cannot difcover fa great a Grief tothat J thee, and I offer thee this frefent^ end thou mayji take arvay their Lines, exterminate em from the in the Ahyfs y as I have drivnthrough the Black-Sea, and the Countrj 0/Colchts. thee. The Prieft being prefenc at all this Ceremony, takes the Offering, and having hung it about the Head of the'SuppIiant. they go and Eat it together. But of all the Images of whole Cruel Uiage thefe blind People are moft afraid, there is not any fo formidable as thac of Giohas. They relate how this Image being one day carry'd a Journey, and paffing by a Lake or Marfh full of Frogs, thenoile of the Frogs foamaz'd it, and put it into fuch a Fury, that it flew away to a Church that flood upon a Mountain. They report moreover, that it Kills all that approach too near it. So that when any Perfon has oc- cafion to Pray to it, he goes no nearer then juft within fight. Where he throws his Prefent down at a difiance, and keeps himfelf at thelamediftance all the while he makes his Prayer. The Mingrelians are alfo every one very Zealous for the Ho nour and Bravery of his Parifli-Idol; every one vaunting the Exploits oi: the Idol he Worfhips, and how Couragioufly ic has reveng'd him upon his Enemies: or how fpeedily they die that fall under its disfavour! But to the Images of the ^omanCaiholicks, the Mingrdians pay not the leaft Venerati on, nor have they any value for 'em. Only for St. they accompt him their chiefeft Saint, as do all the Mufeovites and Greeks. They have feveral Reliques among 'em, of which the chiefeft were brought 'em as they fay, by the Prelates that fled for Shelter into thofe parts, when Conftantivople was taken by the Tnrl{i fearing left they fliould fall into the Hands of the Infidels. Our Theatin Monks have feen a piece of the True Crofs, about a handful long, and one of the Holy Virgins Shifts. The colour of it was fomething enclining to Yellow, Powder'd with Flowers, and Embroidered with Needle-Work. The length of it was Eight Spans, the Breadth Four, the Sleeves fhort but a Span in Breadth, and ftreight at the Neck. This Shift is lockt up in a little Ebony-Box garnifll d With Sil ver : They have alfo a dry'd Hand of St. enchas'd in Gold, adorn'd with feveral little pretious Stones. Another Hand of St. Oniric ; with feveral Bones fet in Gold and Silver. The Holy Stvadling Cloaths, wherein the Happy Virgin Swath'd Jefa Chrifi. A little Square Box, where lie the Hairs of his Beard, and the Twilled Cord wherewith he was Whipp'd. All which Reliques the Prince of Mingrelia has in his keeping 5 and when he fhew'd em to our Fryers, he fpread 'em upon a Carpet, where any one that would, handl'd 'em without any Veneration or Refpe6K For the Mingrdians have a greater EfleemThe Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, Efteem for the Eachafements, then for the Reliques them- ielves. But as for the Reliques they have little or no Value for em, but handle'em very contempcibly. Their Mafs is after the Greel^ manner, which the Priefts Celebrate, without any other Sacerdotal Habit, then only in their Surplices. And if they have no Shooes, they lay a Piece of a Wooden Plank before the Altar to (land upon. If the Prieft comes to the Houfe of any one that defires a Ma(s, the goodnatur'd Prieft never troubles himlelf to goto the Church to fay it; but prefently repairs to the place where the Wine lies, and takes the firft Plank that he meets with, tho never lb Durty or Dufty, to ferve him in ftead of an Altar; then he Borrows an Old Shirt, or fome other piece of Linnen, to put about his Shoulders, and orders a little Dough to be giv'n, of which he makes a little Cake, and Bakes ft in the Cinders. After that he takes a Wooden Cup, and a Difli for a Chalice and Cover, tho never fo Greafy and Nafty; which he wipes with his Hands in ftead of a Towel j and then fays Mais with out Book. For the Miflal of the Uingrelians is a little Book Written in the Georgian Language: and feveral Priefts carry about 'em thefe Miflals, all torn or Dog's-Ear'd, and fome- times here a Leaf and there a Leaf torn out, and altogether imperfed. But this never troubles 'em. They fay Mais all the while they are Looking for it in the and many times they have done before they can find it: for as I faid be fore, they have it by Heart. Nor is the Office perform'd with any Decency i' the World. For many times, they talk all the while of other matters. During Lent, they never fay Mafs, but Saturdays and Sundays, for that all the other Days it be hoves em to Faft 5 and it is an Opinion amono 'em that the Communion Ipoils their Fafting. They Confecrate Unleaven'd as well as Leaven'd Bread, without any difteience; nor do they ever mix any Water in the Chalice, unlefs the Wine be very ftrong. For they hold that the Communion may be giv'n in Vinegar, as well as in Wine I enquir'd of feveral Priefts (I ftill recite the words of the Manufcnpt) concerning the Form of their Confecration 5 oik I ncycr CQiikl meet with above one that could tell me. Him 11 a et ^ er after Confecration, the Bread and Wine were wubftantially the Body and Blood of Chrift? Upon which the R ['fC hm \j\n r a . Ming,as if I had fpoken to him in â€¢ ' rvi iat u * S therean y one can put Chrift oal V \ Inch, way could he get into it ? How is it poffible hethrough the Black-Sea., and the Cblchis. 10 i he fhould be confain'd in fuch a little piece of Bread ? What reafon fhould move him to leave Heav'n and defcend to Earth ? I never heard the like of the Queftion that you ask. Then I ask'd him, Whether the Mais were effeftual without the words of Conlecration ? To which he anfwer'd. That the Mafs was certainly effe&amp;ual without em, yet that the who did not pronounce the words of Conlecration, did very ill. But as for the Intention of Confecration requifite in him that Confecrates, that s a thing of which the Mingrdian know nothing at all. They make their Viaticum Bread once a Year ; that is to fay, upon HolyThurfday. Which they keep in a Purfe of Lea ther or Linnen that hangs faften'd to their Girdles. But they liave no more Veneration for this Vi then for a Morfel of any other Vittles. As for example, when they go to Bed, they lay it under the Bolfter with the reft of their Furniture, and when a fick Perfon fends for any of this they open the Purie, and take out a piece, and give it the MelTen- ger for the ule of the Perfon that wants it, whether Man, Woman or Child. And becaufe this is ufually very dry, they break it with their Hands upon a Stone, or in a Plat ter, never minding to gather up the Bits or Crums that fall to the Ground j which afterwards they put into a Draught of Wine, .and give it the fick. At the Years end the emp ties out of his Ptirfe upon the Altar the remainder of the ticum, if there be any left i where generally the Mice come and eat it. By which you may conjecture what is the Opi nion and Belief which the Mtngrelians have of the Holy Sacra ments. They anoint the Foreheads of their Children lb foon as they are born, and the Oyl which they make ufe of for this pur- pole is call'd Myrone. But they are not Baptiz'd till a long time after : nor does any one Baptize his Child, until he be in a Capacity to make a Feaft after the Ceremony is over; which is the reafon that many Childern die, without being ever Baptiz'd. And when they do perform the Ceremony, they never carry the Child to the Church, but into a Cellar or Vault, where the Prieft fits down without minding to put on his Sacerdotal Habit, and reads a good while in a Book ; which being ended, the Godfather ftrips the Child, waflies him all over with Water, and then rubs him from Head to Foot; which done, he drefles the Child again, and gives it to eat. And then the Prieft, the Father, the Godfather, and the Gucfts invited, D dcfl e Travels of Sir John Chardin into Perlia, fit down at the Table. There is not one Prieft among em all that underftands the Form of Baptifm, fo that 'tis a Qtje- ftion whether their Baptifm be to any purpofe or no. Which is the reafon that our Theatin Monks Baptize as many Chil- dern as they can : which they generally do under the pretence of fome Phyfical Application : by that means concealing the Office of the Priefthood under the difguife of Phyfical Ope ration. There are very few People in whether Ecclefi- aftical or Seculars, that make any Confeffions; and I think I might well fay there are none at all. For they believe it to be a fufficient Satisfaftion for their Sins to offer a Prefent to their Idols, which is the utmoft addrefs of their Worfliip, and limit of their Religion. They never make ufe of Extream Unftion, which is a thing of which they are utterly ignorant. They do not believe that Ordination imprints a Charader not to be defac'd. And therefore they Ordain anew thofd who have been degraded, as if they had never been in Or ders. They do not allow Marriage to be in the Number of the Sacraments. 'Tis a Contrad by way of Bargain and Sale ; for the Parents of the Maid agree upon the price which the perfon that demands her in Marriage is to give for her. The price of a Woman repudiated is lefs, then that of a Wi dow j and the price of a Widow lefs then that of a Maid. When the Match is concluded, the Party concern'd makes it his Bufinefs to raife the Sum agreed upon for the purchafe of his Miftrefs: which he raifes by the Sale of his Sub;e6ts if he have any, or their Childern to the either for Ready Money or Commodities. However, while he is railing the Sum, he has Liberty to go privately and fee his Miftrefs j nor is it any fcandal if her Belly fwell before (he is married. At length when the Young Man has rais'd the Sum agreed upon by the Parents, he carries it to 'em : and that Day they make a great Feaft together, and that is the firft Day of the Nuptials. The next Day the Parents Conduit the Bride to the Bride groom's Houfe : and ufually give him either in Slaves, Cattle or Houfliold-Goods the value they have receiv d from him : and upon the fourth or fifth of thefe Feafting Days the Cere mony is concluded, according to the Cuftom of the Grce\ Church, only in this, that the Ceremony is perform'd not in the Church, but over the Door. But if any one have mar- r y'd a Barren Woman, or of an ill Difpofition and ugly Hu- i* mour,through the Black-Sea, an &amp;/CoIchis. mour, they hold it not only lawful, but requifite to Divorce her ; in regard it was no Match of Gods making, for that God does always that which is good, and never makes Matches between people that are Barren, or whole Humours are in compatible one with another. There is not a Man among em that underftands the Bible, or that reads it; there being very tew among em that can read or underftand the Georgian ; which is the only Language wherein they have the Holy Scripture written. But as for the Women, they are not altogether fo ignorant as the Men; fo that you fliall have fome of them who will rehearfe feveral Stories of the Gofpel, which they have read and got by Heart. Their Fafts are aim oft the fame which the Greek* obferye* For they obfcrve the four great Lents j The firft before Eafter, being 48 Davs v That before Chrifimas, which lafts 40 Days 5 That which is call'd Sc. Peters Faft, which holds very near a Month 5 and the laft which the Chriftians obferve in Honour of the Virgin Mary , which continues for 15 Days. They make the Sign of the Crofs upon certain Occafions, but they do not believe the Sign of the Crofs to be any Mark of Chriftianity. Only they make this Sign when they drink Wine and eat Pork. Their Prayers are all addrefs'd to their Idols, relating only to Temporal Benefits, their own Profpe- rity, and the Ruine of their Enemies. They offer Sacrifices like the and The friejl prays over the ViÂ£Hm, and then cuts the Throat of it: And when it is Boy I'd, they let it upon the Table. At what time all the people of the Family ftand about it with Candles in their Hands, except the perfon who makes the Offering, who is Kneeling all the while. He firft perfumes the Viftim with Incenfe j which when the reft have like wile done, they fall too, and eat it altogether. They alfb cut the Throats of Beafts and Birds over the Graves of their Relations and Friends, and pour Wine and Oyl upon em. And thele Libations they obierve every day. No Body drinks, till as he holds the Cup in his Hand, he has firft faid a fentence of a Prayer, with his Eyes lifted up to Heav'n, and pouring out at the fame time upon the Ground a fmall quantity of the Wine in the CupÂ» TheyThe Trawls of Sir John Chardin Perfia, They never make Holy -Day upon or abftain from Work , but upon the Feftivals of and Eafter. However the celebration of their great Feftivalsconfifts only in Eating and Drinking to excefs in their Houfes. Their greateft Feftivals which they obferveis, when any Idol is to be carry'd through their Country. Then they put on all the bed Cloaths they have. They make a great Feaft, and get ready a Pre- fent for the Idol which is to pals by. And this, I believe, may fuffice to fliew that there is not the leaft fliadow of Religion among the The Ma- nufcript, from whence I took thefe obfervations, relates their feveral forts of Divination pra&amp;iz'd among 'em; their Super- fiitions and Sundry Cuftomes, which are a Medley of Judaifm, and Pagamfm. All which I left behind me, not finding therein the leaft Grain of Wit or common Sence. But quite the Contra ry, nothing but Extravagance. I (hall only add, that all that I obferv'd in the Religious Ceremonies and Belief or Faith of the Mingrelians, is no other then what I have truly re ported. I fliall only fpeak a word concerning their Mourning, which is the Mourning of people in defpair. When a Woman lofes her Husband, or a near Relation, (he rends her Cloaths, ftrips her felf naked to the Wafte, tears her Hair, and with her Nails claws off the Flefli and Skin from her Body and Face, (he beats her Breaft, fhe crys, yells, gnafhes her Teeth, foams at Mouth, like a Woman mad or poffefs'd, and a6ts her paflion to that degree, that it (eems terrible to the fight. The Men alio ex- prefs their Grief after a manner altogether as Barbarous: They tear their Cloaths, thump their Breafts, and (have their Heads and their Beards. This Mourning continues 40 Days, with the fame Fury as I have defcrib'd for the firft Ten Days, but afterwards relaxing by degrees. During the firft Ten Days, the Relations of the deceas'd, and a great Number of Men and Women come to bewail the Dead, which they do in this manner. The people range themlel ves in order about the dead Corps, and in their torn Habits, thump their Breafts with both Hands 5 crying out ; and fb keeping time with their Thumps and their Cries, they make a difmal Noile; which altogether yields a frightful Spectacle of de- fpair, not to be beheld without a kind of Horrour. Of a udacn you hear nothing, all's quiet, the Mourning ftops, and all obferve a profound Silence; By and by they all begin again with a loud Cry, and fall into their firft Tranfportments.througli the Black-Sea, and the Country of Colchis, i The laft Day, which is the Fortieth, they Bury the Dead. Then they make a Feaft for all their H elations, all their Friends, all their Neighbours, and all thofe that came to bewail the Party deceas'd ; the Women eating by thetiifelves, apart from the Men. The Bifhop fays Mafs, and then feizes as his Right, upon all that the Deceas'd Perfon made ufe of in his Life, hisHorfe, hisCloaths, his Weapons, his Plate if he have any, and all the reft of that fort. So that thele Mournings mine whole Families in Mingrelia. Neverthelefe they are ob- lig'd to this Solemn Performance. The Bifliop fays a for the Dead, for the great profit he receives; and the Mourners come to waile the Deceas d, as (lire to live Forty Days upon what he has left behind. When a Bilhop dies the Prince him- felf caufes Mafs to be faid upon the Forti'th Day^ and feizes upon all his Goods that are Moveable. This is all that I could learn in concerning the Na ture of the Country, and the Cuftoms and Religion of the In habitants. Their Neighbours Live and aft after the fame Fa- Ihion, almofl: in every relpe6t: only they who Live riearer to tPerfia and Turkey, are more Civil in their Manners, and more Honeft and juft in their Inclinations Whereas they who lie nearer the Tartars and Scythians, are more Barbarous in their Cuftoitts, living withuut anyor outward Form of Reli gion, or obfervance of any Laws. I have Ipoken alio of the Ahcas and other People that Live at the Foot of Mount tafm ^ concerning whom I have related as much as I could learn. But now I (hall give an accompt of what I have ieen and heard; fnoft remarkable, concerning thofe other Countries that bor der upon Mingrelia. VVhich are the Principality of Cnriel } and the Kingdom of Jmiretta, The Country of Cuiriel is very fmall; it Borders to the North upon Imiretta ; Eaftward upon a part of Mount fus that belongs to the Turks. To the VVeft upon and to the South upon the BUcl^Sea. It lies all along upon that Sea in lehgth from the River that runs a Mile froni the Caftle of Gonie, held by the diftant only Forty Miles from Shafts. The Country of Guriel relembles Min grelia in every thing as to its Nature and the Mantlets of the Inhabitants; For they have the lame Religion , the fame Cuftoms ; and the fame Inclinations to Leudnefs, Robbery and Murder; Theio5 Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, The Kingdom of Imirclta is fomewhat bigger then the Country of Guncl-, and is the of the Ancients. It is Enclos'd and Sunounded by Mount the Black-Sea, the Principality of and being about c ix and T wcnty Miles in Length, and Sixty Miles broad. The People of Mount Cancafus that lie next to it, are the Georgians and 'Turks, and to the North the Ofji and Caracioles, or Caracherks or 'Black c Grcajpans, fo call'd by the for the reafons already mention'd. Thefe are thofe or Black;iircajjians, which the call who ran- fackt ltdly and G&lt;tÂ«/,and whole devaftations in thole Countries, are lb frequently mention'd by the Ancient Hiftorians, and par ticularly by Cedrenus. The Language which they Ipeak is al- mofthalf Turkilh. Imiretta is a Country full of Woods and Mountains like Mingrelia ; but the Vallies are more Lovely, and the Plains more Delicious; where you may meet much more eafily with Bread, Meat, Pulfe and Herbs of all forts. There are alio in it fome Iron-Mines. Money goes among the People of this Country, and is Coyn'd in the Kingdom j and here ye alfo meet with feveral Towns. But as for their Manners and Cu- ftomes, they are the fame as in The King has Three good Caftles; one call'd feated upon the fide of a Valley, and two in Mount call'd liegia and Scorgia, both almoft inacceffible as being built in places that Nature herfelf has ingenioufly fortifi'd â€¢, the Riverrun ning befoi e 'em.The Prince had alfo not long fince another For- trefs call'd Coi^/^bearing the fame Name as the Country round about it, which perhaps may be the fame place that calls the Region of Cot at cue. But the are at prefent Mailers of it. The Kingdom of Imiretta, has had under its Jurifdiiftion the A be as, the Mingrelians, and the People of Guriel, after they had all Four fhaken off the Yoke of the Emperors of ftantimple firft of all, and then of the Emperors fond. But then in the lafl: Age, fetdng up for themlelves, and revolting one from another, they have been ever fince at continual Wars one with the other. They who lay next the Turkgimplor d their affiftance, who readily took'em into their PioredHon, and then made em all Tributaries one alter anoÂ» thei.

The King of Imiretta, and the Prince of fend their Tribute to the Bafha of Jkal^ikg: but a Chianx gathers it in Mingrelia. When I came to Al^athe report went, that the Turks would take pofleffion of thefe Countries, under the Government of a Bafha , not knowing any other way to prevent the perpetual Wars, that apparently mine and de populate the Countries. However it be now, the formerly forbore to take pofleffion of it, in regard that the Precepts of Mahumatifm, could not conveniently be there ob- lerv'd, becaule the beft nourifliment in thofe Countries is their Wine and their Hogs Flefh, which are both prohibited by the Mahometan Law: befides that they have no Bread 5 and the People live (catter'd upon and down the Country, fo that where- ever the Turh^ fhould build their Fortreffes, they would not be able to Command, within their reach, above Seven or Eight Houfes. Upon which Confiderations they left thofe Pro vinces in their Ancient Condition, and are fatisfi'd only to keep 'em under Subjedion for a Nurfery of Slaves; which yeilds 'em every Year no lefs then Seven or Eight Thoufand. And the fame Reafons and Obftacles moft apparently difcourage the Turks from Incorporating into the Body of their Empire, thofe Vaft Plains of Tartary and Scythia, and the wide Regions of Mount Caucajuf. For if the People that inhabit thole parts, were united into Cities and ftrong Places, there might be a way found to reduce em, and keep 'em in Subjection. But which way is it poflible to fubdue a People that change their Habitations every Month, and all their Life-time wander up and down the Country ? The prefent Prince of Mingnlia is the Eighth, fince that Country firft revolted from the Dominion of Thefe Princes of Mingrelia, all give themlelves the Title of as much as to fay, the Head ofJuJiice ; from a Word, that fignihes Juftice : from whence the firft Race of the Kings of ( PerJia was call'd (pich-Vadian, that is to fay, the firft Juftice. To denote, that they were the firft Men, whom the People of that vaft Country, eftablifli'd over 'em for the Adminiftration of Juftice among 'em; and to maintain every one in the enjoyment of his own Property. The King of gives himfelf the Title of Meppe, which fignifies a ' n the Georgian I anguage. Both which and boaft them- felvesjoS The Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, felves to be defcended from the King Prophet David. The Ancient Kings of Georgia alfo affum'd the lame defcent; and the Kan of Georgia, among the reft of his Tides, calls himfelf, the Iffue of that Great King by his Son. The King of Imiretta, alfo in his Letters aflumes a more Haugh ty and Pompous Title then the other, calling hiiiifelf IQng Kings. Now fo foon as our Veffel was come to an Anchor, in the Road of IfgMHr, as I have already faid, I went a Shoar with the Creek, Merchant, who was my Guide. For I expected to have met with Houfes, where I might have found Provifions and fome other Relief. Nor were thefe hopes without any Ground, to one that faw no lefsthen Seven Veflels together at an Anchor in the Road: but I was utterly deceiv'd; for I found nothing at all. The Goafi: of is all cover'd with Wood. Only they have levell'd and lay'd open, about a Hun- derd Paces from the Sea fide, a certain fpot of Ground, about Two Hunderd and Fifty Paces long, and Fifty broad ; which is the Grand Market of Mingrelia. In this there is one Street, containing on both fides of the Way, about a Hunderd finall Hutts, made up of the Boughs of Trees, faften'd one to ano ther : of which every Merchant takes one. There he lies, and keeps Shop, tho with fuch Wares only as he thinks he fhall fell in Two or Three Days. But as for thofe which he has bought, and fuch for which he does not fee any Probabili ty of a quick Vent, he keeps 'em in the Veflel, there being no kind of Security a Shoar, There was nothing elfe to be had at this Market, nor a Country-Man's Houle to be heard of in all the parts there about. Thereupon my Guide fpoke to fbme of thofe that came to the Market, to bring us fome which is that fort of Grain, by them made ule of in ftead of Bread, fome Wine and other Provifions; which the Coun try-Men promis'd to do, but fail'd in their Words. So that I was furpriz'd, and very much troubl'd to meet with nothing, for our own Provifions began to grow fhort, nor to fee any thing at luch a Market, but a Company of Slaves Chain'd together, and about a Dozen of Tatter'd Fellows, with Bows and Arrows i their Hands, who it feems were the Officers of the Cuftoms, and look'd more ready to Rob, then relieve us. But I was much more furpriz'd and perplex'd, when I heard, that the Turks,and the Prince of were coming into Mingrelia, that the People took Arms, and had begun the War, Pillaging and Ranfacking their Neighbours, and clear- t 'through the Black-Sea, and o/'Colchis. iing the Country both of Cartel and Inhabitants. I muft con- fefs t depended very much upon the in Mingrelia, when I firft reiblv'd to itiake choice of that way. I was %fiVd they had a Houfe where I might be fecure, and that they could much facilitate my paflage into Ferfra. But their Houfe was Forty Miles from Land, and Fifty Five by Sea. However I ient an Fxprefi to the Superior of the Mifftonaries, with a Letter wherein I gave him an account. That I was come into Mingrelia, and that I was going into Terjta about bufinefs ot great Importance. That I had Let ters of Recommendation to him from the AmbalTador oi' the Refident of Genoa^ the Warden of the of and the Sollicitor for the Theatinf at and there fore I earneftly defir'd him to fend me (bme Perfon that might give me neceflary Informations how to proceed in my Voy age. I would have made riiy Bargain with the for Ready Money, but he rather chole to have Cloth. There upon my Guide agreed With him for two pieces of blew Lin- nen, upon Condition that he returned in two days and a half. Which two pieces coft Six Shillings at Caffa. This done, I return'd to the Veffel, very penfive, and forely troubl'd to find my felf in a Country where there was no Provifion to be bought, where Money would not go, nor any Lodging Was to be had. And befides the fight of fo many Slaves of all Ages and both Sexes, fome in Chains, fome ty'd two and tvVo, and of the Officers of the Cuftotiiers that look'd like meer Rob bers and Ruffians, had fill'd my Head with a Thbufand Fears. However I kept a good Heart ftill, and did my utmoft endea vour to diffipate thofe Difturbances of my Mind. All this while I faid nothing to iriy Comrade or to my Ser vants, only that I had been promis'd Provifions; neverthe- lefs 'twas but prudence to be as good Husbands as we could of that little we had. Nor did the Rumours of the War hin der the Merchants in our Veffel from going a Shoar; where they took every one a Hutt, and carry'd their Commodities along with 'em. The 18th at Noon, my Guide came aboard, and brought ine an Anfwer from the Superiour of the Theatins. It was very fhort: For he only fcnt me word, That within two or three Days he Would come to the Veflel with a Bark, and Would ferve rlie to the utitloft of his Power. f f TlieThe T ray els of Sir John Cliafcliti Perfia^ i , The s &gt; th toward the Evening, a great Number of Country People that had made their efcapes, pafs'd by and give us a hot Alarum, That the A he as whom the Prince of Mhjgrelia had call'd in to afllft him againft the pillag'd and burnt ail before 'era, carrying away the Inhabitants, and driving away the Cartel, where-ever they came. Thereupon the Merchants endeavotir'd to carry off what they could in their Long-Boats. But it was late, and the Veflels rid about a Mile from the Shoar; nor could they make above two Re turns. Thereupon every Captain caus'd two great Guns to be carry'd aflioar, which they planted at the Avenues of the Market, and ftood to their Arms all Night. For my own part I cannot exprefs the forrow I was in at fuch an unfortu nate and unexpected Accident. I had hardly Conftancy enough to hold out. And that which drove me almoft to defpair was this, That the Captain difcours'd of going f o Trade among the Abca's and Cherkj, and then to return back to Cajfa. Which was to be three Months at Sea, and not to be laid up till the end of the Year. The Recoyl of my Fortune, which fuch a Refolution fet before my Eyes, the danger of pe- rifhing at Sea, want of Vittles, the impoflibility to get any; all thefe things which I forelaw diftinfHy, were not the great- eft Trouble that perplex'd me. My greateft Vexation was to fee my Friends Concerns, which I thought had efcap'd the Dangers of the 'Blach^Sea and Tur expos d to new Hazards^ and my felf likely to undergo the Reproaches and Scorn of People, that would be apt to lay to my Charge uncxpeded Accidents for Mifcarriages, and attribute unfortunate Con- junaures to my Imprudence. To this I may add the Grum bling and Imprecations of my Servants, that continually rang i my Ears: Some curfing Deftiny, others the Country, others the People that had advizd me to the Blacl^Scj. In a word, I was in fuch a profound Agony, as I thought would have ut terly fwallow'd me up. But COD in his Mercy deliver'd me i He ftrengthen 1 d me with Courage, and I hearten'd up my People j but their patience was loon tyr'd, ready to break forth every foot with the fame extravagance; for the Hunger which we endurd heighten'd their Tranlports even to Brutifli Outrage. The 20th all the People that belong'd to our Veflel, and the reft that lay in the Road, return'd aboard. Chufino ra- rher to leave their Wooll, their Salt, their Earthen Ware, and lush like Commodities, then to hazard their being tak'nthrough the Blaciv-Sea, and Golchk by the Abcis, who as they Were afTur'd were very near at hand. , And indeed their Intelligence was too true. Foi: about Ten a Clock at Night we faw all the Market-place a Fire 5 and the next Morning fuch as ventur'd to fee what was the matter, found nothing but the Aflies, and Remainders of the Conflagration^ So foon as our People were all come aboard, I endeavonr'd to buy of them Bisket, Rice, Butter, Onions, and dry'd Herbs: but no Body would part with their Goods, fearing left they fliould not return to Caff a ; till at length by the power of Money I got of feveral Merchants Sixty Pounds of Bisket, a few Herbs, Eight Pounds of Butter, and Twelve Pounds' of Rice. This was but a fmall Stock for fix People. But good Husbandry made it lafl: longer then I expefted. Fof there was in our Veflel dry'd Fifh in abundance, and we fcarcely fed upon any thing elfe. But I was wonderfully pleas'd when I had prevail'd with my Men to make a Meal without Bread, and lookt upon that Abftirtence of theirs as the Lucky Chance' of a Fortunate Day. The 27th, feeing the Superiour of the did not come, and not knowing what I might hope for from him, I propos'd to my People the Neceflity there was that one of them (hould go and find him out 5 in regard there was nond but he that could preferve us from the Miferies that threaten'd us, and which came thick upon us every day more then other. But'twas the want of Vittles and their own delpair that pre- vail'd beyond all my Arguments. So that one among the reft proffer'd me to go feek out the TAnd it fo happen'd that there was a Bark of Anarguie that lay by our Veflel. Which Anarguie is a Village upon the Sea-Shoar, not above Twenty Miles from Sippias, where thoie Fryers have their Relidence. This Bark being come to take in a Lading of Salt, my Servant went aboard, after I had given him four Duckets in Gold, Money, Mercery Ware, and all the Letters I had for the Su periour of the Thsatins. Which I did, to the end that the Recominendatibh of fo many Perfons, fome of Quality, the reft his Friends, might haft'n him to afllft us in our Extremi ty : befides that I had writteh to him my felf at large, de- firing him to aid us if it were in his Power.

However, I carry'd him into my and there, together with my Comrade, we debated what was beft to be done. We return'd him Thanks in the firft place for the pains he had taken in coming fo far. To which he anfwer'd. That he had come according to his promife, but that the War and the Incurfion of the had made the Roads fo dangerous, that he durft not venture himfelf. Af ter that, I told him. That his firft Complement to me at our firft Greeting, put me at my Wits end : and therefore I bc- fought him to tell me. Whether he were not come to take us along with him, and carry us to his own Refidence ? Who anfwer'd. That he was come to ferve me to the utmoft of his Power, and that he would carry us Home to his own Houfe if we defir'd : however he would gladly let us know the Na ture of the Country through which we were to pals. That it was a Place where there was no Bread to be had and hard ly any other Food to be got at that prefent time: That the Air was very unwhollbm, and the People fo wicked that it was fcarce to be imagin'd. I told him. That we had a Letter of Recommendation to the Prince of Mingrelia. To which he anfwer'd. That this Prince was as great a Cut-throat, and as profels'd a Robber as any of his Subjeds. He told us more over, That about three Years before, returning from he brought along with him feveral Prefents for the Prince, for the Princefs his Wife, for the Vifier, and the Principal Lords of the Court, which he diftributcd among 'em till he had almoft left himfelf nothing j with which the Prince was fo far from being fatisfi'd, that he lent and took away that little that he had referv'd, and although he were at that time phyfitian to the Prince and all the Grandees, the clapt him up foon after in a Dungeon, with a Chain about his Neck, and Fetters upon his Feet, to get more Money from him, and that he could not be releas d cut of the Clutches of that Tygre, till t ^I lie had paid him Forty Crowns. Not that I tell ye this, Gen tlemen, faid he, to fend ye back again, but only to inform ye of the danger ye have thrown your felves into, by letting foot in Mingrciia. \ et after all th is, if you will nieeds go for ward, I will do my beft to preferve your Perfons and your Goods, and to pais ye fecurely into Upon this, I confider'd what the Father had reprefented tons: and I came to this i^cfult with my felf, That the Mi f- chiefs that threaten'd me in Mingre were Mifchiefs to come, and which I was in hopes, though I knew hot which way, to efcape. Thofe which I endur'd were prefent, and my Head and my Heart were both full of 'em I reprefenced therefore to Father Zampi, That whatever Misfortunes (hould happeii to us in Mingrelia, would be kfs then thole would befal us iii returning to Cafa , which would infallibly be our ruine. t defir'd him to confider, that we had neither Provifion nor Vit- tles, that the Veflel where we were was old, and daily took aboard great Numbers of Slaves of all Ages and Sexes, fo that we could hardly ftir one by another in the Ship. That a great Number of Abe as and Min went and came from Morning till Night, that fill'd it with Vermin that would endanger a general InfefHon, and end in a Peftilence. That the Veffel would be two Months before (he recurn'd for Cajfa, at what time the Weather would begin to be unfeafonable and tempeftuous j as being that part of the Year when the Sea, fo dreadful ftormy, was rnofl furioulty exafperated by the Violence of Continual Tempefts ; fo that fuppofe they (hould get fafe to Caffa,and thence to 'twould be four Months at leaft before they could perform their Voyage, and then we fliould be fore d to begin again, and put to find out a new Projedl: which way to pals through Belides running the Rifco of extravagant Impofitions, or exorbitant Cuftoms; and yet after all thele Adventures we (hould be ftilt expos'd to ruine, which was the fame thing or worfe then to run the hazard in Mingrelia, where the Danger could not be greater, but where the Peril could never laft fo long, fince it Was but four Days Journey before we fhould be in a Country where we fliould be fecure. Father Zampi could not gainfay any of my Realons: Be- udes that our paflage could not but be advantageous to hirri- felf in particular, or to his Miffion.

Now the Bark wherein I had fent tny Servant was a long Veffel like a fmall Lighter ., and was bir'd to go and come with Goods: and into this Veflel it therefore was that we put our Baggage aboard, and about a hunderd Crowns worth of Goods which we bought out of the Veffel. Which Purchafe was made at my Intreaty by Fathet Zampy, becaufe he knew what would beft go off in for that Money, as I have faid already, was no otherwife Current or Valuable there then as it was a fort of Merchandize. Our Baggage being Embark'd before Noon, we fet Sail at the fame time. And then it was that I was over-joy'd to find my felf quit of the Ship ; for I could not endure the Stench of it. Befides that the Naftinefs and Infamous Behaviour of the Peo ple aboard made me loath the very fight of 'em. The Veffel was a meet Sink and Dungeon of Slaves, who as foon as Night came j were Chain'd two and two, as well the Boys as the Men. In the Morning they took off their Chains agen, fo that I could hardly reft for the ratling of the Irons, and then the very Objed it felf griev'd me to the very Heart. Every Morning we were fure to fee a Fire a(hoar,which was a fignai that there were people come to fell either Slaves or other Mer chandize. Upon which they fent away their Long-Boat, in to which they who had a defire to come to the Veffel put themfelves and their Wares, and being brought aboard, drove the Bargains as they could agree. And indeed the War in Mingrelia was very favourable to our Merchants 5 for the Abca's brought 'em all their Plunder and Booty to fell: Among the reft there came one day to our Veffel an of Quality, having a Train of feven or eight Men at his Heels, who feem d to be the arranteft liakehels in the World. He brought three Slaves, and his Men were loaden with Booty; and among other Things they had got a Frame of an Idol all of Silver; I caus'd 'em to be ask'd, Where the Idol it felf was ? To which they anfwer'd, That they had left it in the Church, not daring to carry it away, for fear it fhould have kill'd 'em. Our Veffel had Forty Slaves when I left it, which the Tur- hifh and Chriftian Merchants had bought for Arms, Houfhold- ftuff, and other Commodities. They gave 'em what they pleas'd themftlves, and reck nd twice as much as the Goods coft 'em. 7 hey gave no more then Fifteen Crowns for Men from Twenty Five to Forty Years of Age v and Eight or Ten, for thofe that were older, Handfbm Maids from Thirteen to Eighteenâ€”v...-'v-Xr,:--â€” . . ... ^ â– , .- ,, . â€ž. â€ž through the Black-Sea, and t Country Gplcfe. 115 â– - ^ Eighteen we're fold for Twenty Crowns, others for left. Wo- men for Twelve, and Childern for Three or Four. A 'Creci^ Merchant that lay in a Cabin next to mine, bought a Woman and a Child at her Breaft. She had incomparable Features in her Face, and a truly Lilly-white Complexion ; and indeed I never faw more lovely Nipples, and a rounder Neck, nor a fmoother Skin ; which created at the fame time both Envy and Compaffion. So that I could not chufe but caft a mournful Look upon her, faying this to piy (elf, Unfortunate Beauty / neither would I envy or companionate thee, were I in ano ther Condition, and that I did not find my (elf juft Upon the Brink of Danger, threaten'd with the greateft Miferies imagi nable, if there can be a greater Mifery then that of Slavery. But that which furpriz'd me was this. That thefe miferable Creatures were no way caft down, nor did they feem fenfible of the mifery of their Condition. At length when they had bought 'em, their Mafters took from them the Rags that co- ver'd 'em, clad 'em with Linnen and new Habits, and fet 'em to work ; the Men and the Boys to moyl in the Ship, and the Women to low. Nor did they feem to be much diflatisfi'd with their Habit, or the Food which was giv'n, only they did not like Working, fo that the Cudgel was forc'd to walk now and then to quick'n their Lazineis. We had a good Wind, and we made ule of Oars as well as Sails in our Bark. And for my own part, all my difcourfe was with Father Zampi, what courfe I fliould take to prevent my falling into the Enemies Hand, and my being plunder'd and aflaflinated by the Mingrelians. Which difcouri'e at length brought us to talk of thofe Perfons, whofe Letters I had fent him. He told me the French AmbafTador's Letter was a Du plicate of one which he had fent the laft Year for Atteftadons of the Religion of Colchis : but when he gave it into my Hands, and that 1 had read it, I was furpriz'd to find, that having been giv'n me for a Letter of Recommendation, there fliould not be the leaft mention of my Name. Which made me afraid left Father Zamfifhould think, that the Ambal- fador had not that Value and Kindnefs for me, which I pre tended to make him believe. And therefore I thought my felf oblig'd to (hew him the Letter which the Ambaffador had done me the Honour to write to the Prince of Mingrelia, of which this was a Copy.

About Midnight we arriv'd at the Mouth of the River Aftolphus, call'd by the Mingrelians y and which is one of the biggeft Rivers in Mingrelia. There we ftopp'd and fent to Anarghie two of our Seamen, to know what News of the Enemy, and to fee whether the People were not fled, and in what condition they flood. This Anarghia is a Village: two Miles from the Sea, the moft confiderable in all Mmgrelia, connfting of a Hunderd Houfes^ but fo far diftant one from the other, that it is two Miles from the firft to the laft. There are always in this Village that come to buy Slaves, and have Barks ready to carry 'cm away. And it is ai , t at this Village is built in the fame place where formerly a fair and large City, call'd by the Name of Heracka. tthrough the Black-Sea j ?iM a/'C61chis; The fifth before day, the tvVo Seamen retiirn'd, and brought us word that the Ahca's had niade no Inroads within Fifceeil Miles of Anarghia , but that things were quiet without any Dillurbance or Alteration Thereupon Father Xampi defir'd 'em to Row hard, to the end we might come early to the Vil lage, and Land our Goods before we fhould come to be feen by any Perfon All things fell out to our Wifli, and we took a Lodging at a Country-Mans Houfe, whiih was one of the beft Accommodations in the Town. For we had a great many Chefts, the biggeft of which was full of Books. Thereupon Father 'Lamyi advised me to open it, and take out the Goods in the fight of the People of the Houfe, to the end they might have no fufpicion that we fcarry'd any Treafure in our Chefts j but might be ready tb give it oiit that we were only Pcrfons in Holy Orders, for which teafon we loaded our felves with a great Number of Books for our particular ufe. I follow'd his Advice, and found it to be very good. For the People of the Houfe Were amaz'd to fee nothing in fuch a large Cheft but only Books ; and I am apt to believe they conceited there was nothing elfe in all the reft. The ninth a La.y-Thedtin came to fee lis: He was the Phy- fitian and Surgeon, that ferv'd all And the Accefs which his Art had procur'd him to the Prince and all the Gran* dees, had puft him Up tb that degree of Pride, that he valu'd neither Fathers nor Superiour, and in all his Anions and Dif- courfe manifefted a moft inlupportable Superbity. However, I receiv'd and entertain'd him as his Vain-glory feem'd tb re quire. Who thereupon gave me a Thoufand AlTurances of Prbte&amp;ion and Afliftance, and promis'd tb bring us Tidings of the Retreat of the Ahca's, fo foon as he found his Information to be fuch as he Cotlld confide in. Nor did he fail in his Un dertaking fb that he return'd to us the 13th, and brought us the Good News we expeÂ£ted. He told us that he had been with the Prince the Day before^ at what time the Intelligence came tb him. He recounted alfo to Os, that the had carry'd away with 'eni Twelve Hunderd Perions, and a great Number of Cattel, With other Booty i that they had plundered the Houfe of a Tenant to the Thiatint, and taken away three of their Slaves: That the Prinde had fent thtee Gentlemen to the Prince of the Abca'sto make his Complaints, and to threaten 'em for their Pcrfidioufncfs i, for that having enterd Mingre* / m ,under an Engagement and upon Oath to defend it againft the Turkt. they had made ufe of their Fbrces fo Sack and Pillage H h theThe Trawls of Sir John Chardift Perfi^ the Country, and was return'^ and had recreated without doing him the leaft Kindnefs. And thus after he had giveri us a full Accoittpt of the Nevfo that was ftirring, he told Fa-, ther Zampi farther, That we might all go together to their Refidence at Sipfias, and that the Prince and the Cathohcos had order'd him to affure me and my Comrade, That we were Welcom, and that he would provide us Men and tJorfes to Convoy us into Ceorgid. Upon which we refolv'd to depart the next day. â€¢ While we ftaid at Andrghia we funer'd for no want of afty thing j we had Fowl, Wild Pigeons, Porkers, and Goats ia abundance. All which my People had in exchange for Lin* nen, Needles, Incenfe ,Combs and Knives: and they had their Provifions very Cheap too: Wine was alfo very plentiful, for it was then the very time of their Vintage. There was alio at ghia a Lady of Quality, who had made choice of that Place to retire to for fecuricy but a little before. She was a Widow, and her Husband had been Chief Minifter or Vizier to the Prince. Father Zampi carry'd me to her Houfe, where I pre* lented her with fome inconfiderable Trifles, and flie in Ao knowledgment of what flie hadreceiv'd, and in hopes of more, fent me every Day a Loaf of half a Pounds with fbme other of her choiceft Viands. One Day fhe fent me a piece of Wild Boars Flefh, another Day a Ball of Wax, another Day a fmall Quantity of Honey, another time a Pheafanr, and by the Met fenger ftill flie requefted fome Trifle or other, as Knives, Scif- fars, Ribband, Paper, or the like, and fo flie paid her felf double for her Prefents. One Day flie came to give me a Vi- fit, and fliew'd her felf very Complaifantj and fignifi'd her Fancy for feveral other things. But though I did not like this Trade, I kept fair With her however, becaufe I would not want Bread, which was not otherwhere to be had. Father Zampi advls'd me to pretend my felf a Capuchin; and gave out himfelf that I was going to the in Georgia t That I had disguis'd my felf becaufe I would noÂ® be kneswn in Turkey,and to the end I might travel vvhh more freedom. And the better to counterfeit my Difguife, he per- fwaded me to go very meanly, arid to pretend Poverty uport all Occafions. And for my own part} I acted my part very well, but the ill Management of my Servants prevented my Plot from taking Effect. They brake my Meafurcs by the Good Houfe which they kept. For they bought the beft Vittles they could find, let it coft what it would. Injx, through the Black-Seaj and o/ Colchis. Vvord, they repaid themfelves for the Icarcity which they had endur'd. Which Expences of theirs caus'd People to think I vvas not fo poor as I pretended to be. The 14th, two Hours before Day, vve departed from Andr- gbia, and Row'd up the River two Leagues, after vvhich vve landed our Baggage, and loaded our Goods into fix little Carts: and ifiU'd two more with the Provifions vvhich Father Zampihad bought. Thefe Eight little Wagons made a great Noile j for it Was an unufual light in to fee fo many together. So that in lefs then two days the News flew about the Country of the Arrival of certain with Eight Wagons leaden with Baggage. Which News vvas fpread with fo many Circumftances, as were the occa- fion of feveral Misfortunes that befel us, as I (hall relate in the purfuit of my Story. Thus we travell'd four Leagues and a half by Land, and by Sun-fet arriv'd at Sapm. Sapias is the Name of two little Churches, of vvhich the one is a Parifh-Church of Mitigrel the other belongs to the Theatins. It Was beftow'd upon 'em,together with the Church yard wherein the two Churches are enclos'd. Which En- clofure is very large: and where they have alfo built feveral Apartirtlents and Lodgings after the Falhion of the Country : every one of the Fryers having his Apartiment to himfelfi according as they are one feparated from another. The lefler Lodgings are for their Slaves, and two Families of Country- People who ate their Tenants. The Tbeatins came firft into Mingrelia in the Year 1627. vvhere they were admitted as Phyfitians. The Prince who then Raign d was very Potent, and it Was reprefented to hini as a Thing greatly to the Advantage and Benefit of his Coun try, that Perfons who underftood an Art lb profitable for the Advantage of his Health, (hould be fuffer'd to fettle in his Country. Thereupon he made 'eirt Welcoril, gave 'em the Refidence vvhich they enjoy, with Lands, and a certain Number of Country-People to Manure the Ground, and fur- nilh their Society with Corn and Wirie. One and Twenty Years befofe, the Jeluites of Conjiantinopte lent Two of their Fratertiity into this Country, but they dy'd there fo foon, that the reft were afraid to venture any more; The Theatius however for fome Years laft paft, had Houles in Jrid,Circajjia and Jmirettd. Which are all forfak'n and de- ftroy'd, feeing the People no way enclin'd to embrace the tlora^n Religion J and befides they, were over-imploy'd in their PralfleeI 2 O The Travels &amp;f Sir John Chardih Perfia, Pnaice of Phyfick. Moreover, they affiir'd me that they bad long fince abandoti'd Colchis likewife upon the fame Con- fideratkms j only that they ftaid there for the Honour of the Roman Church, which glory'd to have her Miffionaries in all parts of the Earth 5 but more particularly for the Honour of their own Order, out of which there being no other Mifllon into any part of the World, it Would turn to their difcredit ihould they not be able to uphold it. t here were only four Thedtius at S apt as when I arriv'd there, three Priefts and one Laic. The Priefts. prafhs'd only Phyfick, the Lay-Brother both Phyfick and Surgery. For he had been up and down in the World, a Ghirurgeon by Profef- fion. The Theatins affirm, That all the Spiritual Benefit which the Country reaps from their being among 'em, is only Bapti sing of Infants, there being none which are there Baptiz'd, or but after a very odd Fafliion. Unlefs it be in that) they con- fefs, they make no other progrefs among the MingrelianSy who are fo far, fay they, from embracing the Roman Ceremonies, that they do not believe the Eu to be Chriftians, be- caufe they do not fee 'em obferve fo many Fafts, nor with fb ftrift and fevere an Abftinence, befides that they do not Wor- fhip Images. The Theatins very immediate Slaves, will not Communicate with their Mafters in their Religious Exercifes; and they have aflur'd me, they could never Educate any one to ferve at the Mafs. I have feen thefe Fryers (bmetimes Bap tize Childern ; for they Baptize all that they meet with, in Houfes where they have not either been of a long time, or where they do not remember that ever they Adminifterd that Sacrament before. I have tarry'dfeveral Days in leveral Places of Mingrelia with the Superiour of the , and have frequently feen his way of Baptizing. For when they brought him any one that was ill, he call'd for a Bafon of Water, pretending to walh his Hands, and when he had wafli'd 'em, before he dry'd 'em again, with the end of his Finger he touch d the Forehead of the Child, making the Parents believe,' it was only to underftand the Diftemper. He Baptiz'd Childern that were in Health by flirting a lit tle Water in their Faces, while he was Wafhing his Hands, as if he had done it in (port. I ask'd him. What it was he did ? I have Baptizd thefe Childern, faid he ^ happy is it for them that we came into the Houfe. I ask'd him a fecond time. What Name he had giv n 'em ? I give em no Name, anfwer'd he ; for oft-times I know not whether T Baptize athrough the Black-Sea, and the Colchis, i Male or a Female ; there is no Necefficy for the Name, it be ing fufficient to caft a drop of Water upon the Infant, and mentally to recite the Form of Baptifm. In a word, the fbeatim are very miferabic in M they pillage'em. they abufe 'em j nor have they any value or refped for 'em' unlefs it be when any Sicknefs or Wound conftrains 'em to require their Affiftance. The 18th the Pfineefs of Wt^relia'cuae to vifit the kins j and prefejitly fhe Sqperiour of the made hafte to attend her Thgfe Princeifleis of and thofe of the Neighbouring Countries they pall which in the gian Language fignilt?? QiUJen. She was a Horfeback, attend ed by about Eight Women and Ten Men, and feme Lacqueys that ran by her Horfe, But this Twin of her? was very ill elad^ and very badly mounted. She told the or Superior,' That Â£he ijflderftood that the Providon which was ufually fent 'em from ConfimfmPple was come, and that there were Euro peans in the Hpufe, who had brought a long with 'em a con- Ijderable Oyantity of Goods: that flie was very glad of it, and defir'd to fee em that fhe might bid 'em Welcotm Pre' fently I was call'd for to pay my Refpeds tp her ; at what time Father Zampi told me that I muft make her a Prefent the way according to the Cuftom of that Country, to ac knowledge the favourable Viftts of the Prince and Princefs. Upon that I befought hef to tarry till I could bring her one t6 her Palace; to #bicfc (he readily confented. Now (he had been told, that I fpake Turki/h and f erfian upon which {he fent for a Slave that underftood Tm whom (he order'd td ask me a Thouland Qyeftions concerning my Quality, and the defign of my Travels. I made him anfwer, That I was a Capuchin, and Ipoke and afted always as a Religious Per- Ton: but it was plain her jMajefty did not believe me; for all her Difcourfc was about Love i and (lie caus'd the Queftioti to be put, Whether I were fenfible of that Paflloh, and whe- ther I had ever been in Love ? How it could be that a Man could never be in Love, or live without a Woman ? Arid with this Difcourfe (he went on (o pleafingly, that all her Train were ftrangejy delighted to hear her. Though for my, part I could have wifll'd the Prince(s and her Train farther off from me ; For I was afraid (he would have caus'd the Hdiifc to be plunder'd, having three times demanded to fee what I had brought, together with the Theatins Provillon. Which Provifion is yearly fent em from Conflantinople, as I have al - t i readyTheTra-veh of Sir John Chardin Perfia, ready faid, and confifts of Goods and Commodities of feveraf forts; of which they ate oblig'd to fend a good fliare to the Prince, the Princefs, to the Vizier, and the Principal Gentle men of the Country. Father Zampi therefore promis'd to bring her the accuftom'd Prefent the next day, and that I my Iclf Ihould bring her one likewile &gt; and fo latisfi d, God be thanked, fire went away. The 19th in the Morning (he fent to invite me to Dinner, whither I went with Father Zampi and another She was then at a Houfe about two Miles from ours. For flie did not live with the Prince, who could not endure her, but hated her to death, in regard he had been fore'd to marry hen I found her in a Drefs fomewhat richer then the day before ; fhe was likewife painted; and had us'd all her Skill to fet her felf out to the beft Advantage. Her Habit was of Cloth of Gold, the Attire of her Head Glifter'd with Precious Stones: but for her Vail it was altogether Curious and Gay, and of a particular Fafliion. She fate upon a Carpet, having on each lide Nine or Ten Women that belong'd to her Chamber 5 for her Maids of Honour Were, as they faid, retir'd for fafety to a Fortrefs by reafon of the Wars. The Hall was full of jhames half Naked, which compos'd her Court. Before I was admitted, I was ask'd for the Prefent I had brought. Which was carry'd by a Lacquey, who gave it to fome of her Ser vants; confiding of Paftes of Gen Ribbands, Paper, Needles, Twizers, Knives and Scillars, all Neat and Curious. The whole coft about Forty Shillings *, but worth above a Five Pounds in Mingrelia. The Princefs wasextreamly pleas'd ; and when {he had feen 'cm, fent for me into her Prefence. Where the Slave that fpake Turhjfh order'd me to fit down upon a Bench that was clofe by. Prelently the firft thing fhe faid to me was, That fhe would marry me to one of her Friends, and that flie would not have me to leave the Country, for that (he would give me Houfes, Lands, Slaves and Tenants. After that flie fell into the fame Difcourfe as the Day before ; but it lafted not long, becaufe the People gave her Notice that Dinner was ready. The Houle where flie liv'd was in the midil of five or fix others, every one a hunderd Paces diftant from it, without any Fence either of Hedge Or Wall. Before it flood a large Eflrade or Afcent of about eighteen Inches high, cover'd with a kind of a Duomo. 1 his they fpread with Carpets j where alio fate ths Princefsj and her Women about four Paces fromthrough the Black-Sea, and of ColdiiSi from her upon other Carpets: The %akefhamcs that Compos 'df her Court fate in a Circle upon the Grals, to the Number of Fifty. As for the Theatins and my felf there were two Ben ches placed near the Afcent, the one to fit upon, the ochec to ferve us in ftead of a Table. So foon as the Princefs was fate down, her Butler fpread before her a long painted Linnen Cloth, at the end of which he dreft up his Court-Gupboard, which confifted of two great Flagons and two fmall ones, four Plates and eight Cups, fome bigger fome lefler, a Bafon and Eure, and a Skimmer, all of Silver; and at the lame time other Servants fet before all thofe that were feated in the fame place, Wooden Planks to ferve in ftead of Tables; and one alfo was plac'd before the Women. And thus when every thing was order d in this manner, they brought into the Mid dle of the place two Kettles, one very large, carry'd by four Men, which was full of Common ; and the t'other much lefs, which was carry'd by two Men, full of white Com. And I have already obferv'd, that this Com is a Pafie of which the Mingrelians make the fame ufe in their Dyer, as we do of our Bfead. Two other Men brought in upon a kind of a whole Porker boyl'd, and four other Men, every one a large Pitcher of Wine. Of all which they carv'd firft to the Prin- cefs, then to the Women, next lo us, andlaft of all to the Train. After this they ferv'd in to the Princefs a Woodden Platter with Bread and ftrong Herbs to create an Appetite, to gether with a large Silver Plate containing two Fowls, the one Boyl'd, the other Roafted; both ill dreft, and With fuch Sawce that my Stomach would not bear. The Princefs fent me a part of her Bread and Herbs, and bid the Meflenger tell me withal that I fliould ftay and Sup 1 with her, and that fte would caufe an Ox to be kill'd 5 but that was only a Com plement. A fhort while after, flie fent me two Pieces of her Fowl, and bid the Meflenger ask me. Wherefore none of the Workmen,being fuch Excellent Goldfmiths,and Wea vers both of Silk and Woollen came into Mittgrelia, but only Monks, of which they had no need, and whofe Company they fo little defir'd ? Which was a Queftion that did not a little ftartle me ; for the Princefs (pake aloud in and her Slave return'd the Interpretation of his Anfwer as loud. So that I leave the Reader to judge whether or no the poor The at ins were not ftrangely abafh'd to hear the Princefs pro* pound fuch a Queftion. To fay truth, I took the feoff to be pretty well ainvd at my felf, and therefore I anfwer'd as well forThe T ravels of Sir John Chardin into Perfia, forniy lelf as for them, fince [he had addrefs'd her felf alike to all, That the European Artifts work for Money, and that they had Imployment enough at Home to keep 'eni from any thoughts of Oadding abroad, but that they whd were in Orders fought only the Glory of God, and the Sal* Vation of Souls, and that only thofe two predominant Motives could over-rule the Europeans to quit their Country to travel fo far. The Feafl: lafted two Hours ; and when it was half over, the Princefs lent me a Cup of Wine,and bid the Meflenger tell me it was Wine which fhe prelerv'd for her own Drinking, and the Cup out of which (he drank her felf: and this Honour fhe did me three times. But flje wonder'd very much when fhe faw iiie mix Water with my Wine, laying withal that (he had never feen the like done: For flie and her Women drank it Neat, and that to a good pitch. When Dinner was ended, llie fent to know whether or no I had brought along with me any Spices or Porcelane Diflies â€¢,and fix or feven of thefe Mef- fag es I had from her all to the fame purpofe, by which I gueft that the beggerly Princefs did not Carefs me with fo much Ci vility but only for her own Intereft. But all my Anlwers were pofitive Denials j which put her at length into fuch an ill hu mour, that fhe told me flie would fend to fearch my Chefts; to which I only reply'd. That fhe might do it when fhe pleas'd: which I did, as Well fearing left a refufal and unWillingnefs might incenfe her Covetous Humour, as to conceal the dread into which her threatning Language had put met She an- fwer'd me, That (he had only fpoke it in Drollery j and I made as if I had really believ'd what (he faid: but fo foon as we Were rifen from the Table, I defir'd one of the to make hafte home, and give my Comrade Notice of the Prin- cefles words, to the end he might be prepat'd, whatever fliould happen. After Dinner (he fell again into her Difcourfe of Mar- tiage, and told me that within a few days (he would fhew ftie the Lady die had a mind to beftow upon me. To which I anfwer d as before, That Perfons in Orders were never al- Marry. And having fo laid, (he was about to have difmilsd me. But as ill Luck would have it, as I was making my ObeHance, the Princefs efpy'd under my poor and meari Habit, that I wore Linnen much whiter and finer then any was ftiade vaMingrelia. Thereupon fhe came dofe up to me, took toe by the Hand, thruft up my Sleeve to my Elbow, and hold ing toe by the Aril), talk'd to one of her Women with a lowthrough the Black-Sea, and of Colchis. Voice. I was then, I muft needs'confefs, at a cruel Nonplus for the Ladies Careffing Anions no way pieas'd me ; and though flie fmil'd very pleafantly in my Face, yet my Fears were ne'er the lefs. And that which troubled me raoft was, that I could not underftand .what flie iaid, and yet by her Gefture I could perceive (he ipoke of, me with a more then ordinary Earneftnefs and Affedion. Nor did I know,how to behave my felf before fo many People toward a Woman, in whom I confider'd at the fame time the Quality of a Sove- raign Princefs, and the Impudence of a Curtezan. However, till then I felt no more then only a little Difturbance in my Mind. But that which put me into a very great Confterna- tion was this, that the Princefs, addreffing her felf to Father Tyampt, gave him this Rebuke: Ion fa id (he, but 'tis myP leaf tire that yo tipon Sunday-Morning and that New- comer me. The Father would have made her an Anfwer, but the Princefs turning her back, bid us depart. Upon this I return'd to my Lodging very penfive and fad : for her Difcourfe had fill'd me with a Thoufand Fears, appre- henfive left her Avarice and fotne other Motives might fpur her on to do me a Mifchief. And Father admonifh'd me to take it for good warning, and to exped it as a thing that would infallibly happen ; which made me refolve to pre pare for it, infomuch that the Night following we buried all our Goods that were of greateft Value. To which purpofe E caus'd a Pit to be made in the Chamber of the The at in Fryers five Foot deep, where I hid a Cheft of Clock-work, and ano ther of Coral: which were fo well cover tl, that there was not the leaft Appearance that the Earth had been ftirr'd. Af terwards I went into the Church with the fame defign. Where Father Zampi advis'd me to open the of a who had been buried fix Years before, and to commit the Care of a little Caskanet to his Afhes. But GOD, who knew whae would fbon after happen to that prevented me from following that Advice 5 fo that I rather chofe to dig a Hole in a corner of the Church behind'the Door, where I caus'd as deep a Pit to be made as in the Chamber, and there buried a little Box that contained Twelve Thoufand Duckets in Gold. Afterwards I hid in the Roof of the Chamber where I lodg'd &gt; a Scimiter and a Dagger fet with Precious Stones, and fbme other Jewels 5 which Roof was cover'd with Straw. And as for fuch other Things as were of great Value, and light, my K k Com-126 The Travels of Sir Chardin Perfia, Comrade and I carry'd thofe about us; and as for fuch Things as were of lefs Worth, we recommended them to the care of the Theatins. The a 3d I underftood the Kindnels which the Princels had done me, when flie threaten'd to Vific my Baggage. v It was upon a Sunday, part of which I had fpent in Prayer, and in bewailing my lelf, out of a deep fenfe of the Misfortunes that overwhelm'd me, and the Dangers that environ'd me, not finding any Door open for me to make my efcape. I pefied fo certainly to be made a Slave, that I durft not pray to G 0 D for my Liberty. Only I thought it all I could do to beg that I might fall into the Hands of a kind Ma te ; for that if I might have my choice, I fhould ra ther,'chufe the Chains of a Turl{ then the Fetters of a Lady. When we had Din'd, word was brought to the Superiour, That two Gentlemen defifd to fpeak with him at the Door j which two Gentlemen were their Neighbours, both a Horfc- back, in Coats of Mail, and very well arm'd: Nor did the Superiour wonder to fee 'em in that Equipage with fuch a Train, in regard it was in time of War. When he came to 'em, the two Gentlemen told the Superiour, That they came to difcourfe with him, and the that were newly ar- rivd. And fo faying, they alighted. . Thereupon the Supe riour calFd both me and my Comrade forth, who as readily went to wait upon 'em, never (topping to confider whether they had any ill defign or no. But they quickly let me under- ftand their Errand j for fb foon as we accofted 'em,they caus'd us to be laid hold on by their Followers : and at the fame time they commanded the Superiour and the other who were come to falute 'em, that they fliould retire j telling em withal, that if they ftirr'd, they w?juld cut their Throats. Upon which the Superiour in a Panick fear ran away; but the reft would not forfake us, and the Lay-Brother flood briskly to us. He facrific'd himfelf in our behalf; Nor could the Naked Sword which they fet to his Throat affright him from our fides. Prefently our Servants were feiz'd ; and one of them who was refolvM to have made fome refiftance, and to that end drew his Cutlace that hung at his Girdle, was knockt down with a lance, and then Bound and Ty'd to a Tree* J t AfterÂ®through the Black-Sea, and fl/Colchis, 127 Afterwards thefe Afiaffinates declar'd they would fee what We had; to whom I anfwer'djThat they were our Mafters, and we only poor Capuchins, all whofe Riches confifted in Books, Papers, and fuch pitiful Lumber, that they needed not have us'd fo much Violence to conftrain us to fliew it. For I had no other Game to play, being feiz d and bound, and thefe Cut-throats become Mafters both of the Houfe, and all the People that were in it. And indeed through Mercy it took effeft ; for immediately they unbound me, and bid me open our Chamber-Door ; which was in the firft Story; and where there was nothing but What we did not much value whether it were feen or no. For as I have faid already We carry'd our mofi: Coftly Jewels about us j and my Comrade had fow'd his fiiare in the Collar of a large Furr'd Corpf which he wore. And for my own fliare I had made 'ehd up in two little Bundles, and hid 'em in the Cheft where my Books were. For I cur ft not carry 'em about me for fear of being Murder'd or Robb'd, or fold for a Slave. I was there fore fain to defire the Lay-Brother and my Comrade to take the Gentlemen afide, and hold em in a Difcourle of Com* pofition, and to offer 'em a little Money, thereby to gain time to take thofe two Coftly Bundles out of my Cheft, to the end I might hide 'em the beft I could. Which they did, and I went into the Chamber, and Lockt the Door up on me. The Souldiers apprehenfive of my Defign, gave the Gentlemen s Notice, who prefently came to the Door, which was ftrongly Lockt within-fide. At what time my Comrade cry'd out from below, and bid me have a care, for that the Enemy peep'd and watch'd me through the Chinks^ Which made me prefently take away'my two little Bundles from the Roof where I had thruft 'em, for fear they had feen where I laid 'em, and put 'em in my Pocket: biit then perceiving they were about to break open the Door, I flung my felf out at the Window into the Garden, taking fuch a Leap, that had not Neceffity conftrain'd me, I fliould not have taken at ano ther time for never lb much : for it had been enough to have broke a Mans Neck ; but a Man that is feiz'd with a Panick Dread fears nothing but the Objed: of his firft Fears. How ever, being once down, I ran to the end of the Garden, and threw the two little Bundles aiilong the thickeft of the Bufhes t though the Diftra&amp;ion of my Mind would not fuffer me td take a true Notice of the Place where I threw 'em. this, I return'd to my Chambers which I found foil of Rob-8 TheTraych of Sir John Chardin Perfia, bers, fome bf whom were abufing my Comrade, others knock ing with their Maces upon my Chefts with a defign to break â€¢em &gt; but then I took Courage, knowing there was nothing in'em that was very confiderable, and bid em have a care what they did', for that I was the King Envoy ; and that the Prince of Georgia would feverely chaftife the Violence they had offer'd mej and lo faying I fhew d em the King fia s PafTport, which one of the Gentlemen took 4 and would have torn, faying he fear'd no Body, nor valu'd no Man li ving upon the Face of the Earth j but the other prevented him, as having a greater Reverence for the Gold Letters and Gilt Seal. After that he bid me open my Chefts, and he would do me no Injury ; but if I made any longer delay, he would take my Neck from my Shoulders. To which I was about to have reply'd, in ftead of yielding Obedience, which had like to have coft me my Life, for one of the Souldiers had drawn his Sword, and Was lifting Up his Arm to have fplit my Brains. But the Lay-Brother ftppt his Arm. Upon this I open'd my Chefts; but then, Heav'ns blefs me, what work they made! Whatever they had a mind to, 'twas all free Plunder. While they were thus bufie at their Pillage, I was leaning at a Window, and turning my Eyes another Way, as unwil ling to encreafe my Sorrows, I look'd into the Garden, where I perceiv'd two Souldiers among the Buflies, where I thought I had thrown my little Bundles. Prefently I ran ^ke mad to the Place, follow'd by a The at in Fryer but whatever the Matter was, the two Souldiers withdrew when they faw us enter: Neverthelels I was willing to fatisfie my felf whether they were there or no, and fought for 'em, but having mifta- ken the place, through the trouble I was in, I could not then find 'em, lo that I thought they had been found and carry'd away. And you may judge by the Value of thefe two little Bundles, that amounted to Six Thoufand Pounds, what a defperate condition I was in: enough to have broke a Mans Heart: but God fuftain'd me through his Mercy, and fo fup- ported me that I had ftill a prefence of mind and thought that feldom fail'd me in extremity. But the loud Cries of my Com rade and the Lay-Brother, call'd me out of the Garden, into the Chamber; where when I came, I was feiz'd by two Soul diers, who drew me to a Corner of the Chamber, and took what I had in my Pockets, which was no great Matter. Which done, they took me by the Hands, and wou'd ha' bound me.through the Black-Sea, and th Colchis, up me. Upon that I made a Noife, and us'd all the Strength I had, and made figns that they (hould carry me to their Ma- fters 3 and then I told the Chief of thefe Cut-throats, that there was ho Neceflity to bind or kill me, for that I was rea dy to fuffer whatever they were difpos'd to do to me. Who anfwer'd, That they would carry us to the Prince fince we were Ambaffadors. To which I reply'd. That we were rea dy to go without binding, and that we hop'd he would do us Juft ice : for that we had Letters for him, for which no doubt but he would have a very great refpedt. By this time it grew late, and Night drew on ; befides, it was above fif teen Miles to the Princes Caftle: fo that they releas'd us, and carry'd no Body along with 'em but only the Servant, who offer d to make Refiftance at firft, whom I redeem'd fifteen Days after for Ten Crowns. When I was rid of thefe Freebooters, I went to the Gar den, for the Fryer that follow'd me before, when I went to look for the two Bundles I had hid in the Bufhes, had been telling the Misfortune which he believ'd had befall'n me, and no Body queftion'd but that theSouldiers had obferv'd and fol lowed me, and found the Treafure I had lb endeavour'd to con* ceal. Now I had an Armenian Servant at that time, whole Name was AUaverdy ; (and I therefore name him,becaule feveral of my Friends have feen him at after my return from my firft Travels, and for that his Fidelity to me at that time was lb remarkable that I cannot forbear to mention it.) This poor honeft Man follow'd me into the Garden ; but I could not but wonder to fee him throw his Arms about my Neck, with T ears in his Eyes : Sir, laid he, we ruin d our commonMufortme made ws was a little fcar'd at firft, for I took him for fome (Rakehel Han that would have cut my Throat: but knowing him, I was mightily taken with the Mans Affe&amp;ion for me, and bid him forbear weeping, Â©a#, Sir faid he, I have lookt lb well, faid I, that I am too well affur'd of my ill L uck. However, the Fellow would not be fo fatisfi'd, but defir'd me to fliew him the place as near as I could guels, and what courfe I had taken both to hide 'em before, and fince to learch for 'em again. Which I did to latisfie a Ser vant, who (hew'd himfelf fo much concern'd for me, but for my own. part, I lookt upon it to be fo much Labour loft, and therefore never thought it worth my time to help him. More over, it was by this time almoft Night, and I was lb poffefs'd LI withThe Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, with Grief, and my Sorrows did fo perplex me, that I was not fenfible either what I did, whither I went, or what I felt. But I was amaz'd to find the Fellow come and hang about my Neek a feeond time, who at the fame time overjoy'd thruft the two little Bundles into my Bofom. Nor is irto be imagin'd what a Change this Comfortable Return of my Ser vant wrought in my Mind. Though my Confolation did not fo much proceed from the Recovery of Six Thoufand Pounds, which I thought I had loft, as to fee the Care that Providence took of me, the Goodnefs of GGD^ hisPrefence, and his Af- fiftance. This Confideration reftor d me again to my felf in a moment; my prefent Condition neither troubl'd me, nor did the profpeft of future Mifchief difturb me, but manifeftly ac knowledging that only GOD could have thus preferv'd me, I conceiv'd fuch an Aflurance of his Prefervation, that has ftill fupported me in all my Diftrefles. Thus having fav'd the two High-Priz'd Packets, I made lit tle accompt of What they might have taken out of my Chefts; fo that returning to my Chamber, I gave an accompt of my good fuccefs to my Comrade, whom I found reftoring to order the confufion which thofe Robbers had made j by which it ap- pear'd that they had carry'd away only fome few Cloaths, fome Arms, Copper Veffels, and other Trifles. There we agreed together, not to let any Body know that we had found the two little Bundles, to the end they might think we had nothing more of Value to lofe. Which prov'd to be very good Counfel. For the Theatins Servants, thought we had been utterly Rob'd. Tho thanks be to God, the whole that we loft did not amount to above OneHunderd Pound. The 24th in the Morning the Superiour of the Theatinf, and the Lay Brother, carry'd me to the Catholkos, and the Prince to demand Juftice, and would have had me carry'd to each a Prefent. I alleadg'd in vain, that it would look ftrange- ly for us to complain of being Robb'd and Plunderd of all, aud yet to bring Prefents. But Cuftom prevail'd, and I pre- (catedtotheCatholicos, a Knife, Spoon and Fork of Silver in one Cafe,with a Hat which he had fent to requeft of me. Which done, I fliew'd him the Pafs and Command of the Verftan King, as alio to the Prince : but I did not deliver to the Prince - the Letter from the French AmbaHador, in regard the did nftt think it proper. But neither the one nor the other gave me any fadsfa&amp;ion. The Prince told me, that in time of War (as now it happen'd to be) he was not Mafter of the No- 'j' bility.'^ 1 J â€¢ thrbugh the 'Black-Sea, and 151 bility. That at another time he would have done me juftice fpeedily, and to the full : However he would endeavour the Rcftitution of what had been taken from me. The told me the fame Story, and in ftead of afllfting me, b,egan to preach me a Lecture of Confolation. However, they made choice of two Gentlemen to go in their Names and demand what had been tak'n from us. â–  f : - But the moft confiderable Thing that I got by this Days Work, was the Difcovery which I made, that the or Prince had a (hare in the foregoing Days Robbery, and that he had a third part of the Goods for himfelf. Which Difco very ferv'd to make me Underftand the Nature of the Country where I was, and that the Dangers were the more inevitable that threaten'd Us. After our departure, the two Gentlemen appointed to ferve us, went along with us, and lay at out Houle, where it was neceflary to preferit 'em with fomething at their Arrival. And they for their parts made a great fhew as if they had rid about all the next Diyj and the Day fol lowing to ferve us; but all their Riding produt'd nothing : for the 2 (5th in the Evening they return'd to tell us they could do us no good ; nor could they look any farther, for that the Turks were enter'd Mingretia, burnt and fackt all before, and therefore they were oblig'd to return fpeedily to their Ma ilers. I was fo accuftom'd to fuffer, that thele fame dreadful T y- dings hardly mov'd tile. But the Theatins were at their Wits end ; forefeeing that this Incurfion of the would utter ly mine 'em : therefore both they and we prepar'd for flight. At the fame Inftant we heard two great Guns go off', which Was a Signal from the Fortrels of of the Enemies ap proach. tlpon which Signal all the People betake themfelves to flight, carrying away with 'em into the Woods and Strong- Places whatever they are able. The 27th by break of Day We begart our Flight with the reft : but I refolv'd not to meddle with any thing that I had bury'd, or that I had hid in the Roof of the Hbufe, which I held to be more fecure then if I fliould carry 'em along with me. The Theatins had only one Wagon drawn by two Oxen, and two Horfes to carry the whole Baggage belonging to the Houfe and two Childern : and as for the Horfes, the Lay- Brother rode upon one, and ray Comrade on the othet; who Was then fick, which very much retarded our Journey. Two Theatin Fryers and my felf follow'd the Wagcin afoot ana IHIThe Travels of Sir John Ghardin Perfk, the Slaves and the reft of the Servants belonging to the Houfe follow'd us. So that there reraaind but one Fryer to look after it, and a Thoufand Things more which we could not carry away, for want of Conveniency. I my felf left all my Books, my Papers, and Mathematical Inftruments behind me. believing that neither the Turh^ nor Mingrelia/is would trouble themfelves with 'em. The Father, who ftaid behind, fled into the Woods in the Day-time, when he heard any Rumour of the Enemies coming, and return'd to the Houfe ac Night. Now I have already obferv'd, that the Wars of the Mingrelians and their Neighbours feldom laft long, being no more then Inroads for Spoil and Plunder, the heat of which being over, the Enemy retreats back again : and therefore the Inhabitants always leave one or two Perfons in their Houfes, 1 to prevent the Neighbours from pillaging the Corn, Wine, land other Provifions which they cannot carry away. Which 1 Perfons are fometimes furpriz'd by the Enemy, but very rare- â–  ly ; for that they are always upon the Watch; and for that the Woods are fo near and fo thick, that they can ealily run , for't, and hide themfelves when any danger appears. I Twas one of the moft lamentable Things in the World to behold thefe poor People in their flight: Women lugging their Childern and their Bundles: Men ftooping under the Burden of their Baggage : Here one driving his Cattel; ano ther hailing a Cart after him full of Houlholdftuffi The High ways were ftrew'd with People quite weary'd off their Legs, and fo faint, that they were ready to die Of Aged and De crepit People and Childern not able to go, a great Number were to be feen crying out, and making lamentable Moans for Affiftance. It was fuch a fpectacle of Lamentation, Mi- fery and Defolation, that would have melted the Hearts of any but of thofe Barbarians. Yet I muft confels I was not much concern'd at it, not out of hard-heartednefs, but becaufe my Compaffion was all (pent, my own MHeries had fo drain'd me, that I had none left for any Body elfc. Now the Place whither we made our Retreat was a Fortrefs in the Woods, like thole which I have already defci ib'd ; of which the Lord was call'd Sabatar a Georgian, who turn'd Mahumetan, and afterwards became a ChrifHan. He was alio lookt upon to be lefs a Thief and lels a Rafcal then the reft: and we ar- riv d at this Fortrefs after a tedious Journey of five Leagues m deep Mud and Dirt, out of which I could not think the Cart could ever have been drawn j which was the reafon we werethrough the Black-Sea, and the tf Colchis. 153 Vvere forc'd to load and unload twenty times by the Way : not would it be any News to tell ye, That I was twice very neat- being pillag'd and lofing my Life ; in regard I ran that hazard every Day. When we came to the Fortrefs, he that own'd it let us in, and 'receiv'd us kindly enough. For had told him, That I was a Perfon that never receiv'd a Coup- tefie but I made a return for it. He lodg'd us in the place where the Oven flood , in a little fcurvy Htitt, where we were no more (lielter'd from the Weather then thofe that lay i' the open Air j for it rain'd in on every fide. However, it was a great Favour that we had it, and were not crowded as were an infinite Number of poor Wretches one upon another. For the Fortrefs was full of People when we arriv'd : there being in it no lefs then Eight Hunderd Perfons, Women and Childern for the moft part. But here, before I continue the farther Recital of my Mil- fortunes, give me leave to fay fomething of the Occafion of this Incurfion of the Turks,and what I have learnt concerning the late Uingrelian Wars, and of the People of and Gx- riel, in which their Formidable Neighbours the Twr^and IV- jiaa were engag'd. Therein you will find fome Paflages pev- haps not unworthy the Remembrance ot Hiftory and cer tainly 'tis a thing equally to be obferv'd and wonder'd at, That fuch fmall and inconfiderable Kingdoms fhonld continu ally produce fuch Tragick Revolutions. Nor fhail I be accus d to have injur'd the People of thele Countries, while I tell ye how wicked they are, when you have read this part of my Story 'â– )fince the bare R elation which I fhall make in reprc- prelenting 'em (uch, will ^uftifie me perhaps in the Judgment of my Readers. The moftJFamous Prince that ever had, nnce it revolted from the King of Imirett was Un cle to him that Reigns at this prefent. He was Valiant, Gene rous, a Perfon of great Wit, indifferently ^uft and more happy in his Undertakings. He made War upon his Neighbours and vanquifli'd 'em all : and no queftion but he would have made an excellent Prince, had he been born in a better Country. But the Cuftom in his Country of Marrying teveral Wives, and thofe near Relations, was that which tranfported him to fach Excefies as render'd him unworthy of all Encomiums. He remain d an Orphan almofl: as foon as he had out-liv d his Infant Years : at what time his Father dying, left him ^tO the Tuition of his Brother, who was Uncle by the Fathers fide Mm134 The Trawls of Sir John Chardin into Perfia, - - ' ' â–  : â€”â€” â€” â€” â€”. to the Young Pupil, and call'd by the Name of \ the Soveraign Prince of Libardian, a Country that extends it felf a great way into Mount Caucafm This faithfully dif- charg'd hisTruft in the Tuition of his Nephew.

'Tis truej fhe was tax'd of being none of the mod: Faithful Wives, which perhaps might be in revenge of the Foul-play which her Husband openly play'd her ievery Day; Now among the reft of the Women with whom he fell in Love, one was the Wife of his Uncle, who had been his Tutor, and to whom he had been lo highly oblig'd. This Lady went by the Name of of a Considerable Fa mily, which was call'd Chilakg. And as was extreamly beautiful, but wicked and ambitious beyond Imagination, fire was not only content to violate her Conjugal Fidelity, and for two Years together to live in an Inceftuous League With the Prince her Nephew , bur over-perfwaded him at the end of that lea foil to take her away by Force, repudiate his own Wife, and Marry her. Lev an was over-rul'd by her : He took the Adulterels by Force from her Husbands Houfe i He Marry d her, and eight days after fent home his firft Wifeig- nominioufly, without any Train, back to her Father, King of the Jbca's, after he had caus'd her Nole, her Ears and her Hands to be cut off!

That flie had committed Adultery with the Vitier, whofe Name was And the better to make People believe the truth of it, he caus'd this Vizier to be ftopp'd into the Mouth of a Cannon at 'the ftme time that he maim d his own Wife. However, all Men agreed, that there was nothing of Incontinence that had been committed between her and the onlv that he lacrific'd his Wife and his T^rime Minifier to the Hatred and Jealoufie of the Chilajqte. The Love of this wicked VVoman caus'd him to Sacrificed thefe Important Victims: but her Ambition fore'd him to offer up two more pretious Oblations.

Prince George had a great kindnefs for his Wife, as much an Adulterefs, and as wicked as (he was. So that her being cak'n from him by force threw him into a moft furious defpair. He perform'd the Ceremony of Mourning for her Forty Days, according to the Cuftom of the Country, as if flie had been Dead i after which he betook himfelf to Arms, and fell into the Territories of the Prince his Nephew. But was Va liant, and had good Souldiers about hirti, fo that wai conftrairi'd to retire into his Mountains, where he died foon after for Grief and Vekation. The Prince of the Ahccts alfo went about to revenge the Affront and ?njury done him, in the Perfon of the Prjncefs his Daughter, but with as ill fuccefs. He rais'd Forces, began a War againft the Prince of Mingrelia, and tho the confequen- ces of the War did not at all fall out to his Advantage^ yet would he never make Peace or Truce with him nor would he put an end to the War, till he underftood the Death of his Barbarous Son-in-Law. There was alfo a Third Enemy, more formidable but as un- fuccefsful that would notfuffer Levan to beat reft This was his own Brother call'd Jofeph, who engag'd himfelf lb far in the juft Refentments of his Untie and the Prince of the Abca% that he relblv'd to revenge their Quarrel, by caufing the Criminal to be Murder'd. To that purpofe he corrupted one of his Guards an Abca by Birth to Affafiinate him j the Prince's Cup-Bearer being alio Privy to the Confpiracy. The Plot was lb lay'd that 'jofeph fliould go and Dine at the Palace : that the Abca Guard fliould ftand behind him with a Lance in his Hand, and that when the Prince lifted to his Mouth one of thofe great Beakers of Wine which the Drink at the end of the Meal, the Cup-Bearer ihould make a fign to the Abca, who was then to ftrike him through the Body with his Lance. This Plot was within a little bf being put in Exe cution, but fail'd when the ftroak was ready to have been gi ven, Divine Juftice refolving that Lev art's Crimes ihould be his own Murderers and Executioners, which (par'd him a long time before they accomplifli'd it. For the Prince perceiv'd the fign which the Gup-Hearer gave the Guard, and as it were in- ipir'd, threw himfelf down from the place where he ftoodj fo that the Lance never touch'd him at all.

For the Vice- Roy of that part of Georxiawhich is under the Dominion of Perfia, difpoild him of his Principality, and reinvefted in it Levan s Lawful Heir, after he had invaded Mingrelia, and the Territories of Innretta. Which Invafion being an Acci dent that happens to be genuinely appofite to this Recital, I flull only give a (hort accompt of the occafion. The Deceas'd King of Imiretta, who was call'd and who dy'd in the Year 1658. had Two Wives, the Firft was the Daughter of the Prince of Guriel call'd whom he divorc'd for her Adulteries, after he had had a Son and a Daughter by her. The Son, who was call'd Reigns at this prefent King of The Daughter is n Princefs of Mingnlia, the fame that I have giv'n ye luch an accompt of, that would have both Robb'd and Marry'd me to her Friend. The Second Wife which Marry'd was call'd Darejan, a Young Princefs and Daughter of the Great and Famous Taymur Ra^an, laft Soveraign King He had no Childern by her, and left her a Widow after he had been Marry'd to her four Years. They talk Wonders of her Beauty and her alluring Graces. So foon as his Son-in- hawBacrat came to theThrone^e wou'd have had him toMar- ry her. (Bacrat was not then above Fifteen Years of Age ; / s thatthrough the Black-Sea, and th vf Colchis, that the Chaniis of her Beauty could not make thofe deep Impreffions upon his Heart, as being fo young that the Evii Cuftoms of his Country had not yet corrupted him. Which was the Reafon that he abhorred the Propofal, and return'd difdainful Anfwers to her Courtfhip, Darejan therefore find ing flie could not fupport her ielf upon the Throne, imme diately advanced to his Bed a young Perfon of Twelve Years of Age, her Kinfwoman 5 calTd Siftan Darejan y the Daughter of Daitona, the Brother o( Taymur b whom Bacrat Marry 'd at Fifteen Years of Age, as has been already faid. So that Varejan affur'd her felf of the Soveraign Power, and of keeping the King and Queen continually under her Guardian- fliip. But 'Bacratj as young as he w^ perceived hi&gt; Mother- in-Laws Defign, and one Day gave her appatenr Tcftimonies of his Difguft. Upon which Darejan^ to fatisfie Bacrat, al- fur'd him that fhe would forbear to take any Authority upon her. Who being a good-natur'd well-meaning Prince, eafily believ d Varejan, and reftor'd her to his former Confidence, not dreaming of theTreafon that ihe was meditating againft him. To that purpofe flie feign'd her felf fick, and fent for the King to come to her ; who went accordingly with a great deal of Franknefs and VVillingnefs , at what time certain People that (he had pofted in her Chamber, feiz'd and bound him. Prefently flie order'd him to be conveigh'd to the For- trefs of Cotatis, the Principal City of the Country, the Gover- nour of which place was her own Creature. Soon after flie came thither her felf j lent for all the Grandees whom flie had gain'd to her Party, and of whom flie was affur'd, and with them confulted for five Days together what to do with the King. Some advis'd her to put him to Death ; others to pull out his Eyes t which latter advice (he follow d^ and (6 the Prince was depriv'd of his fight. Which happened Eight Months after the Marriage of that poor Prince, which rhey faid moreover he had not fully then confummated.

However, he laid Siege to that alfo, but for want of Artillery, he could do little good againft the Befieged, only that he kept 'em from ftirring forth out of their Walls; and it would have coft him a long time before he could have brought 'em to a furrender, had it not been for the Politick Contrivance of a Lord of the Country, whole Name was Quia C/je^nxe, who brought that to pafs by his Wit, which they could not do with all their Force. He went to the Fortrefs full of a feign'd Defpair, occafion'd by the Prince of Mingrelia ; he made believe that he was reduc'd to that extremity, that he knew not where to find a more fecure Sanctuary : that he came to throw himfelf at her Feet, to beg her Pardon, and defire her Protection againft that Prince. Darejan fell into the Snare. She believ'd what ever Ottia faid, and that his extraordinary Zeal for her In- terefts was true.

Infomuch that it was certainly reported that the Prince of Mingrelia carry'd thence a very rich Booty, and among the reft Twelve Wagons of Silver, Plate and Move ables. For, as it was faid, the Kings of Imiretta had heap'd together fuch a vaft Quantity of Plate, that every thing with in the Palace was of Maflle Silver, even to the Steps and Foot- ftools. Which is no difficult thing to belifeve in a plentiful Country, and where ther^ is a good Trade, And adjoyning to Countries which were formerly very Wealthy, and where it appears that Money was not then in ule, there being very little that is ftirring at prefent.

For fo loon as the Prince of was en- ter'd into the Kingdom of Imiretta, as has been already faid, Darejan who was near Kinf-woman to the and had been bred up in his Houle, and her Husband, fent and offer'd the Kingdom to Archylas his Eldeft Son, if he Would come and drive out the Mingrelian.

Upon which he march'd back again with all his Forces againft the Rebel, defeated and put him to Death, and then return'd to- ward Innretta.

After the departure of the Viceroy feveral Grandees of Imiretta confpir'd againft their new Soveraign. For fome had been ill us'd , others could not brook the Power and high advancement of whom Father had appoin ted to be his Sons Prime Minifter, nor his Domineering Haugh- tinefs and feverity towards 'em.

Prefently he gave advice of what had happen'd to his Father the Viceroy of Georgia. Who fent hira Inftrudions and Counfellors, and afliir'd him, he would come in a little time with an Army td his Afliftance. But the Bafha of A^ahikewould not ftay for his coming 5 for he fell into Imiretta with that fwiftnefs, that the young Prince had much ado to efcape his Avant-Couriers, and to fave him- feif. He went to his Father, where in a few days Intelligence Was brought him, that the Bafha of had put a Gari- fon into the Fortrefs of Cotatu*, the Capital City of and that he was Mafter of the whole Country. Upon which the Viceroy of Georgia turn'd back, not daring to aft any thing againft the Turhg without the King of Terfias Orders. As for the Orders which the had receiv'd from the Grand Signior, the purport of 'em was. That fince the Peo ple of Imiretta and Mingrelia made ufe of their Liberty only to deftroy one another, he fliould take from 'em all the Strong Places he could. The 'Bafha had kept his Inftrudiions very fecret j and having by a Stratagem got admittance into the Ca- ftle of CotatK., he made himfelf Mafter of it, and furnifli'd it with a good Garifon. Afterwards he fent for all the Nobility and Gentry of the Country, and made 'em fwear Fealty to the new King which he gave 'em, who was the Son of the Prince of Gttriel, at that time a Bene, or Monk of the Order of Sr. Bajltj but he quitted his Monaftical Habit, and was Crown'd King. While the Ba/ha was thus difpofing of the Petty Kingdom of Imiretfa, the Prince of Mingrelia came to waite upon him, with the offer of his Head, and Tender of his Subjeftion to the Grand Signior's Commands. That he was and would ftill continue a Tributary to the Court; and that the Prince of Georgia in eftablifliing him, had done no more then reftcr'd him the Patrimony of his Anceftors, which appertain'd to hini of Right. The was appeas'd by his Submifllon, and by the great Preients which he brought along with him.

Thereupon they fent Commiffioners to the Viceroy of Georgia, with their Conlplairits againft him â€¢ at&gt;d conjur'd him, to fend 'em back fiacrat, as Blind as he was' the Georgian Prince was afraid that this demand was no more then only an Artifice of their Treachery, and therefore to af- certain himfelf of the Truth, he made Anfwer, That if the Grandees of Imiretta were really, as they faid they were, in- cens'd againft their new Mafter , ahd refolv'd 'to dethrone him, that they fliojufd pull out his Eyes, and that then when Be was aflur'd they had done it, he would fend away â€¢ Which Conditions were accepted and pun\aually perform'd both on one fide and t' other. The Grandets of Imretta pull'd out their Kings Eyes, and fent him back to the Prince of riel his Brother ; and the Viceroy of Georgia fent eril crat, after he had affianc'd him to one of his Nieces, Sifter to her, whom he had given to the Prince of Mingrella. This latter was very Young, and 'Bacrat was Blind 1 lo that their principal Officers Govern'd; and thence it came to pafs that the Prime Minifters of Miftgrelia and Imiretta had continual Quatrels one with another, wherein they engag'd their Ma tters, and bblig'd 'em to make War one upon another. Li which Conteft the Mmgretian was Vanquiflt'd and taken Prifo- her with his Wife, whom the Viceroy ot had lent hini not above two Months before, and a report was afterwards fpread abroad, that he had not confurrimated the Marriage. She is very fair and very well fhap'd, and tho I have feen many handfome W om en in her Country, I ne^er beheld a more charming Creature. She is moft furely guilty of all the Paf- fions that a Lovers Breaft can feel. For fuch are the Glances of her pafllonately Tender and Languiflling Eyes, that (he never looks but to command Love, and infpire hope. In a word, the Air of her Cduntenance and all her difcolirfes are ir- refiftable Allurements; So that BifliOp Janateile , who is one of the greateft Lords in all Imiretta, was taken with her at firft fight. Who beihg very Rich, ply'd her with Prefents, and gain'd her fo entirely, that now (he fticks clofe to him and that lo publickly^ as if they were Man and Wife. And indeed the cunning which this Prieft made ufe of to retain this lovely Pris'ner ftill in Imirelta, was more then ufual, and a Very pleafant Contrivance. For he made the King his Mafter, theThe Trawls of Sir John Chardui Perfia, poor Blind 'Bacraty ia Love with her, by means of the dayly Encomiums of her Beauty which he continually peald in his Ears and when he had kindl d his Flame, he lay'd before hinr a kind of necefilty of Marrying her. faid he, has loll your Wife, as being carry d o/Akal- zike, jo that GOD knows what is Viceroy of Georgian Niece, to whom yffn that it mil be-a long time before you can therefore yourMajefty will do well 'Trince/s Min- grelia, nor can yon any where M 'Beauty, or more Wit. And thus the King being over-rul'd, follow'd his Counfel, never confidering that he a&lt;5ted more for the Intereft of his Advizer then his own. And as for the Princefs (he was glad of the Bargain. ^ Tis well known that the Prince lov d her en tirely, and that he would never confent to furrender her to the King of Imiretta. And therefore an Expedient was found out to take her away under the pretence of Juftice, which was this. The King of Imiretta had her Sifter with him ; being at that-time a Widow 5 and it was propos'd to her to make her Princefs of Mingrelta, in ftead of her that was fo already, provided (lie could but allure the Prince, and lb order it, as that he {hould be furpriz'd in her Bed. She being the Siftei 1 of a King, Young, Cunning, and Handfom, with little or no trouble eafily debauch'd a Young, Simple and Captive Prince. So that being both taken in Bed together, the Prince was fore'd to Marry her immediately, and at the fame time the King of Imiretta efpous'd the Princefs of Thefc two Mar riages thus accomplifh'd, the Mi had his Liberty, and wasreftor'd to his Country, after he had fworn upon all the Images, never to repudiate his new Spoufe, nor to Marry any other, fo long as (he liv'd. But fo foon as he was return d into his Country, defire of Revenge tranfportirig him, he Challeng'd alike both the and the Perfian. He lent his Ambafladors to the Viceroy of Georgia, and the Bajha of, Jkafailg, Complaining of the In- vafion which the King of ImiretPa had made into his Country, and of his taking from him his Wife. The Baflea was at that time highly provok'd againft the People of for their Treachery, Rebellion and Cruelty to the King which he had appointed for their Soveraign. The Prince of Guriel alfo. Bro ther to that Unfortunate Prince, loudly demanded Juftice. And the .Cruel Darejan inflam'd his Revenge with all hei; r mightthrough the Blaccfc-Sea^ atid the.

Now fhe, vvas lovely, as I have already faid, and her Beauty ftrangely reinforc'd her Arguments. Infomuch that the BafJja promis'd to reftore her to the Throne of Imiretta, together with her Husband, if fhe could get him out of Georgia where he was a Pris'ner, in the Cuftody of the Archbifliop of from whence the wily Darejm found a way to have him ftoll'n and brought to So foon as he was arriv'd, the (Ba/ha took 'em both along with him in his March to ; where he fackt and ruin'd after a moft terrible manner all before him. Where upon the King and Queen fled to a Fortreis call d cbij, feated in an inacceflible part of the Mountains. After that, the Bajha reftor'd Darejan and her Husband to the Throne, and caus'd all the Grandees, and all the People to fwear Feal ty to him ; and fo taking Hoftages, he return'd with a great Number of Slaves ; but little other Booty^ 'in regard it had been no lefs then the third time in five Years that that poor Country had been pillag'd, plunder'd and ranfack'd by the Terjians, ^nd their other Neighbours. As lor the wicked Darejan, (he was deftin'd to be ruin'd by her excefs of Confidence. One of her great Lords having lull'd her into a befotted Credulity, had plung'd her, as I have already related, intoone of the moft miferable Conditi ons that could befal a Woman of her Qnality j and now ano ther by the fame means brought her to the moft Tragick end in the World. This was the mod: perfidious Traytor and Mur derer of the Prime Mlnifter GWiidri who was alio call'd bv the fame Name. For the Murder he had committed had rais'd him to great Preferment. Now this Perlbn never came near the 'Bajha to pay him his Homage, becaufe he had been of the Fadion contrary to Darejan j and was therefore afraid of be ing facrific'd. However, he wrote to the Princefs, as foon as the Tttr^x were retreated, and fent her word, that and they by whom the Prince ftill fuffer'd himfelf to be Govern'd, had put upon him fo many ingrateful Slights and Affronts^ that he would be their vow'd Enemy as long as he liv'd: That if file would engage to reftore him to the Bafhas Favour, and to all his Lands that had been Confifcated, and to ihveft him in the Eftate of the High Steward of Bacrat's Houfliold, he would deliver into her Hands both and his Wife. All which {he promis'd to performs and then the Traytor came and fubmitted himfelf to her. At what time the fr/V/w/jr was P p fo4.6 The Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia : il i â–  â–  - ft i 1 ' iit I fo over-hafty, that nothing would ferve her but (he would prefently beftow upon him all the Marks of Favour and Re- conciliation, Friendfliip and Confidence, which are moft ufual in that Country between Men and Women. She adopt ed him therefore, and gave him the end of her Nipple to fuck. Which is a Cuftom not only in M and but alfo in other the Neighbouring Countries, to adopt in that manner fuch Perfons as they cannot unite to themfelves by Alliance. The Tray tor having this Pledge of Faiths wrote to Bacrat to come with all his Party, and he Would de* liver both her and her Husband into their Hands, either alive or dead. Now the fame Day that was to appear, the perfidious Cot%ia kept his Bed, pretended himfelf fick, and fent to Darejan to vouchfafe him the Honour of a Vifit, for that he had fecret Intelligence to impart of that Importance, that he would not communicate to any but her felf. Thus wheedl'd, away Ihe went, attended only by fome of her Wo men : but as (he was fitting by the Tray tor's Bed, certain Fel lows hid in the Room, fell upon her, and feiz'J her Perfon, her Women in vain endeavouring to proted her. Yet there Was one who took the Princefs in her Arms, and run hef up into a Corner of the Room, where (he ftuck by her, till the Murderers ftabb'd 'em both. With that Cot%ia rofe, and went with his Gang, where Dareja Husband lodg'd i a poor blind Man, uncapable of making any Refiftance. Him there fore they feiz'd, and Cot%ia order'd him to be bound and kept till Bacrat came. Who was no fooner arriv'd, but he demanded the Pris'ner, and hearing him approach, Traytor^ faid he, thrnt rvert the Occafton of putting out Heart. And fo faying^ he order'd himfelf to be carry'd near the Pris'ner, and then groping for his Breaft, he gave him fe- veral Stabs with his Dagger, His Followers compleated the Murther by ripping open his Breaft, and gave the poor Cap tive's Heart into the Hands of the bloody fightlefs who for above an Hour held it in his Clutches, gra(ping and teat' ing it with an unheard-of Tranfport of Fury. Thele Barbarous Tragedies happen'd in the Year \66'}&gt; from which time till the Year 1672, there fell out a Hunderd more in the fame Countries, altogether as Infamous and Inhu mane ; and therefore I pals 'em over in filence, as being Stories rather frightful then pleafing to the Ear.

By which we may find there is a Vijible Providence in the Mo dern Hiftories of thefe Impious People; upon whom Heav'n ft til infli(5ted fuch fevere and fpcedy Juftice: while the Mur derers are always Aflaffinated, and with thole Circumftances Which plainly dcmonftrate that God had a Hand in it, and made the one his Inftrmnents to punilh the other. In the Year \ the 'Bajha of Jkal'z,il{c, perceiving there was no end of Warring between thofe two Petty Soveraigns of Mingrclia and Imerettd, neither by Accommodations nor Re- monftrattces, nor by Commands Or Threats, refolv'd to exter minate 'em, and give their Country to others that better de- ferv'd it.

Upon thefe confiderations therefdre the bf J- kphifyrefolv'd to fettle this young Prince in ; as well in regard the Principality belong a to him as his Right, as for that he had Ibme reafon to hope that he would Govern it well, and root out thole abottiinable Cuftoms that had over riin it: |nd this was the reaibh bf the coming of the Turks into grelia.

The 31ft the Gentleman went with Thirty Men weli Arm'd to wait upon the ft a/has Lieutenant, carrying alona with him a Prefent of Four Slaves, a Silver Cup, together with a Quantity of Silk, Wax and Vittles for Refreflimenr, 1 hat Evening he arriv'd at the Gamp, where he found feve- ral Lords of Mingrelia, who were come, as he was, to fubmit themfelves, for fear of being Befieg'd, and of having their Ca- t es and Lands plunder d and derholinad. The Lieutenant told him that the Orders which his Mafter had receiv'd from the Grand Signior his Mafter, were to deftroy all the ftrong places in Mingrelia, however that he would preferve the Gaftles of iuch Lords as preferv'd themfelves in their Loyalty and Obe- dience.

All that night he beftur d h.mfelt to get ready the Prefent which he was to carry. To which purpofe he fig- nifi'd to all that were fled for Refuge to his Caftle or Fortiels, that the Turkf had given him a Proteaion for Twenty Five Slaves and Eight Hunderd Crowns, which he muft Levy up on thofe that were retit'd under his fecunty. So that from every Family that had Four Childern he took one: which was the mod: lamentable fpeftacle in the World,, to fee little Childern torn from the Arms of their Mothers, ty'd two and two together, and carry d away to the For my own part I was tax'd at Twenty Crowns. ' _ However, Sabatar did not carry any more to the (Bafha s Lieutenant, then what they two had agreed between them- felves: the reft he appropriated to himfelf. Nor could his Wives, his Childern and all the Caftle forbear loud Cries of forrow when they law his Young Son carry d away among the reft. For thofe Childern which are given in Hoftage to the Turkjare no lefs his Slaves; He never parts with 'em ; as be ing ufually fent to Conftantimpk) to encreafe the Multitude of thole handfome young Childern that are bred up in the raglio. The Bajha's Lieutenant receiv'd the Prefent and the Hoftage, and ftill detain'd Sa with him neverthelels. He alfo fummon'd the Dadian 1 hree times to furrender, but the Prince refus'd, For his Fortrefs was well guarded by the Soh- amS)which his Vizier had lent him, and who were more the Mafters of it then himlelf: befides that the Vizier fent him word every Day that he fliould hold out, and that he would be ready in a fhort time to pour down upon the Enemy. At laft the Turks after they had ftay d about Four Days before and; got above Two Thoufand Slaves and much Booty, rais'd their Siege: for they had no great Guns, which was the reafon they did not attack the Caftle. They alfo carry'd along with 'em all the Mingrdian Lords that came to furrender them- felves, and had fworn Allegiance to the new Prince. The Catholicfls was among the number of thole that had tak'n the Oath. Whom the Bajha order'd to be made Vizier to the new Prince, and that they fliould lend in his Name to the Prince of the Sca%to. demand the Princels his Daughter in Maf- riagÂ£'through the Black-Sea., and Colchis. It was thought that the coming of the into Mingrelia, would have refettl'd all things in order,and reftor'd Peace and Tranquillity, by caufing all Parties to lay down their Arms. But it did not fo fall out: they only came and plunder'd the Country ; but put it into more confufion then i: was be fore. For they divided it into two Parties; of which the one was engag'd by Oath and Hoftages to the new Prince, the other ftuck faft to their depos'd Soveraign : Which Divifion made every one betake themfelves to their Arms. Seeing therefore the Affairs of the Country in this miferable condition fo far from any Accommodation, I took a refolution to get into by any manner of way, or whatever the hazard might be. For I ran thofe Rifco's every Day in Mingrelia, that I expcded nothing at length but to be utterly ruin'd. threatn'd Ruine and Deftru6Hon to the Caftles, Goods and Lands of the Lords who had fiirrender'd to the Turk? was ftill in Cuftody : and his Sons that commanded in the Caftle, were the greareft Cut-throats and accomplifh'd Rogues in the World. I languiflfd every Day with forrow and want. It was a Man's whole bufinefs to buy a handful of Grain, and a Pound of Vittles ; and I fuffer'd in my Oven all the Injuries of Weather, as if I had been in the open Field : the defpair of my Ser vants went to my Heart; in a word, I was at the brink of Death. Which was that which indue'd me to venture all hazards to get my felf rid of Ming while I had ftrength and Ability to do it. To that purpole I (ought every where for Guides; promised, entreated, lay'd down my Money, but nothing would do 5 there was no body that would be my Condudtor. The Armies they faid,lay fo thick upon the Roads of Imiretta , the Country between Mingrelia and through which I was of necefllty to pafs, that it was a meet folly to venture, where a man was affur'd he could not efcape being made a Slave. And thefe were all the Anfwers they made me. I propos'd the fetching a Compafs either over Mount Caucafus or along the Sea Coaft, but no body wouli undertake the Journey. 'Tis an incredible thing to think how fearful the are of Death, or of being undone; there is no Reward can prevail with 'em to run the Rifco of a known Danger, how inconfiderable Ibever it be. At length I was conftrain'd to take the way by Sea, and through that is to lay, to fetch a Compafs of Seventy Leagues. T o that purpofe I went to Amrgbia, a Village and fmall Sea-Port, of which I have already152. The 'Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, already fpok'n. There I found a Felouque of the which . I hir'd for Gonia: fo that when I had giv'n Earneft, I return'd to the Theatins Houfe, and to Caftle, to prepare for my Voyage. The Tenth of TSlovember early in the Morning I departed from the Caftle, having agreed with my Comrade what ways 1 would take to recover him out of if it pleas'd GOD to grant me a happy Voyage. I carry'd along with me Eight Thouland Pounds in Jewels, and Eight Hunderd Pi- ftols in Gold, with the few fmall Packs that were left me. The Jewels were hid in a Saddle contriv'd for that purpofe, and in a Pillow : and I took a Servant along with me, the fame whom I had redeem'd out of Slavery. This was a con- ceal'd Rogue 5 a Traytor whofe Villany was not well diico- ver'd by me. I was advis'd not to take him along with me for fear of fome Impofition, or fome wicked Trick that his very Countenance told 'em he would play me; nor w 7 as I well refolv'd with my fclf to be troubl'd with him ; but my Fortune would have it fo, and I could not prevent it. But the Reafons that prevail'd with me more then any other to take him, was, that he brook'd his bad Condition like one that was mad or in defpair ; and I was afraid left in one of his mad or drunk'n Fits (to which he was fubjeft) he fliould dilcover us m Mingretia. Frye the Superiour of the Theatins, bore me Company as he had done all along. And the Lay-Brother undertook to Conduft me to The Superiour and I went afoot, becaufe we could not meet with friore then one Horfe to be hir'd for Money, upon which I loaded my Goods, and let my Servant ride to look after 'em. The Lay-Brother was alfo a Horfeback, and it rain'd as hard as it could pour after two days i infomuch that the Fryer had like to have been drown'd about a League from the Caftle in a deep Ditch that overflow'd its Banks,into which his Horfe fell, and out of which with much ado we recover'd him half dead. I fliall not relate the Hardfliips I endur'd both that and the fol lowing days: as being conftrain'd to march afoot in a rainy feafon through the Woods, full of Water and Mud, where I went for the moft part up to the Knees: only in a word, that twas impoflible for any Perfon to endure more then we did. For my own part I was quite fpent; All that I had left was a lemainder of Courage and Refolution to do and luffer what ever befel me, to fave thole Goods that were entrufted to my Care. In the Evening we arriv'd at wet to the t verythrough the Black-Sea, and Count rj Colchis. 15 5 Veiy Sjcjn 5 ^targbid being fix Leagues frpitt the Caftle of Srf- batar. â–  , The rath J was to have Etnbark'd, but was prevented the News that wasfpread about of leveral Barks of the Uans and Abe as that were Cruifing upon the Coafts of Mw- grelia. Which was very true ; for they had taken feveral Barks,of the Country, and One among the reft wherein I was cpncero 'd. Yet the unfpcakable trouble which this delay gave roe, did not proceed fp much frqm its keeping me in conti nual Fears and Dangers, as that it feem'd to threaten me that I fliould never get rid of'em. The 19th Father Zampi had Intelligence that the Day be fore, they had fore'd Open the Church-Doors, taken away all that was in the Church, had open'd tjie Sepulchcr, and carry'd all that one of the Theatins, who was left to look af ter the Hpufe, had hid in the Tomb, and that there was no- thit^ left ftanding but the Wall- Tljis News put me into a terrible flight, confidering I had left above Seven Thpufand tPifiolsbarVd in the Church. Upon wjhichT difpatfh'd ^vay a Mefleager to my Comrade, thinking to have found him at the Caftle; but he was already gone to the Refi- dence, to know what courfe we mould take to repair fo great a Misfortune, of which he had Notice as foon as my felf. But â€¢ be wrote me word, That Thanks .be to COD they had not fo much as touch'd pur Money, having fqund it in the fame place where ,we had buri'd it. Which. good News wonderfully re- â€žyiv'd .my Spirits, looking upon fo gregc a Favour of the 41- ; mighty as a ftgn of his Attop^ment; fo that I went to encou rage the Xfttfay whofe Feluke I had hir'd to fet Sail with all j ipeed. The a 7th I departed from Ana my Feluke being a Veflel of good Burthen, wherein there were near Twenty Perfons,. the one half Slaves, the reft Turks, which J the ra ther permitted the Mafter to take in, that we might be the bet ter able to defend our felves againft the.

After an Hours Sailing, we got into the Main Sea : For the Langur which we left is very rapid, and runs with a furious Stream; and befides, hemuft be a skilful Pilot that carries a laden Veffei down that River, by reafon of the many Flats, where they ftick upon the Sands.

For the Ceremony was no otherwife then thus, perform'd in a Neighbours Houfe adjoyning to the Lodging where I lay. He fent for the Prieft about Ten a Clock in the Morning; who was no fooner conie, but he went into the Buttry where they kept the Wine, and fate him- felf doWn upon a Bench without any other then his ordinary Habit, and then fell a reading in a Book that was half torn, about the bignefs of a New Teftament in OSiavo. Not that the Child was brought to him when he began to read, for the Father and Godfather did not bring him till a quarter of an Hour after ; and then appear'd a little Boy of about five Years of Age, at what time the Godfather brought alio a little Sear- ring Candle, and three Grains of Incenfe. The Candle the Godfather likewife lighted, and fix d it to the Door of the Cellar, where though it was burnt out before the Child was Baptiz'd, they did not light up another â€¢, and as for the three Grains of Incenfe, they were ftrew'd upon a few Embers, and fmoak'd away. All this while the Prieft read on, very faft, and with a low Voice, and in fuch a carelefs manner as if he never minded what he did. The Father and Godfather went to and agen all the time, and (b did the Child, that did nothing but eat. At length after an Hours reading, thet-e Was a Bucket of warm Water got ready; into which after the Prieft had pour'd about a Spoonful of Oyl of Walnuts, he bid the Godfather undrefs the Child : which was done, and the Child put naked into the Bucket; where, as he ftood up on his Feet, the Godfather wafli'd his Body all over, and when he had well wafli'd him, the Prieft took out of a Lea ther Pouch that hung at his Girdle as much Myrowe, or Oyl of tlndion, as came to the weight of a Pea, and gave it to the Godfather, who Anointed with it almoft all the parts of the Childs Body ; as the top of the Head, the Ears, Forehead, Nofe, Cheeks, Chiii, Shoulders, Elbows, Back, Belly, Knees and Feet: All which time the Prieft read on ftill; nor did he give over till the Godfather had again dreft the Child. Which being done, the Father brought in Wine, Bread, and a piece of boyl'd Pork, and firft gave the Child to eat, then prefented the Prieft, the Godfather, the Guefts, and all the Houfe : and then they all (ate down to the Table ; nor was there hardly one that was not drunk before he wentÂ» t 1through the Bhcic-Sea, and Colchis. I have alfo feen Mais perform'd la the lame place : which is done wirh the farne ( areleflhefe and Irreverence, and altoÂ« gether as has Been related in a Treacife of the Mingrehan Reli gion. And once it was my ftap to fee one very pleafantly in terrupted. For as I was flying with one of the we pafs'd along before a Church where they were faying Mafs' At what time the Pricft that laid it, underftanding that we enquir'd the way of the People that Hood at the Door, Stay k little, cry'd he from the Altar, Imme diately after he came to the Door, muttering his Mafs between his Teeth, and after he had ask'dus whence we came and whi ther we went, he fhew'd us the way, and fo retiirn d to the Altar again. The 29th betimes i* the Morning We put to Sea, the wea ther being clear and fair: and then we could difcover the high Lands of Trehtfond, on the one fide, and of the Abcas on the other, and that very eafily becaufe the beginning ro wind toward the Abcas Coafts, AnaYghia Hands far out in the circular circumference of thofe Coafts anfwering to The is 200 Leagues in length wanting Twelve Or Fifteen , lyitig juft Eaft and Weft. The broadeft part, North and South, from the Bofpho with is three degrees 5 which part is the Weftern end of the Sea ; the Oppd- lite part not being above half fo broad. The Water pf' this Sea feem'd to me lefs Clear, lefs Green, and lefs Salt, then the Water of the Ocean. Which proceeds as I am apt to be lieve from the great Rivers that empty themfelves into ic 5 and for that it is Ihut up in its felf as it Were in the bottom df Sack, lo that it ought to be more properly called a Lake thfen a Sea, like theCdfpian Sea-, With which ic agrees in this, that is common to both, that in neither of the two Seas there are any Iflands. And therefore 'tis in vain to feck for the realbri of its Denomination from the colour of the Water. The Greeks gave it its Name from the Dangerous Navigation dayly experierie'd by thofe that ventur'd into it; by realbn of the T empefts there more frequent and boiftrdus then in other Seas: Axenos fignifying mhofpitable, and that will not fuffer any Perfbn to come Hear it. The Turkj therefore for the fame rfca- fon call it Cara Denguis, or the F Cara which in the Turkifli Language properly fignifies (Blacky denoting alfo furi ous, dangerdus, terrible, and ferving ufually in that Idiom, for an Epithite given to thick Forrefts, rapid Rivers, and fteep and rwgged Mountains. NOW the reafon why the Storms are more Violentj - Â£ cffa (f]ravels of Sw John Chard sn Periia, Dangerous in that, then in other Seas, is firft be- caufe the Waters are eontrafted within a narrow Channel and have no Outlet: the Bofphom not being to be accompted art Outlet by reafon it is fo very ftreight. And therefore the Waters being Violently agitated by a Storm and not know ing where co have Room, and being ftrongly repel 1 d by the fhoar they Mount and rowle aloft, and beat againit the Ship on every fide with an Invincible fwiftnefs and force. Second- ly becaufe there are few or no Roads in that Sea which are fhelter'd from the Wind, but where there is more danger then in the open Sea. . . r , ~ , c . All the Black-Sea is under the Dominion ot the brand S,g- nior , there is no Sailing there without his leave ; fo that there is no great fear of Py rates, which in my Opinion are a greater danger then the Sea it felf. All that Day we fayl'd with a Contrary Wind, which was the reafon we did not make above Six Leagues, however in the Evening we bore into a River call d Jxchuhi'ly deeper and almoft as broad as the Langur, but not fo rapid. The ooth Two Hours before Day wefet fail by the light of the Moon, and by Noon we made the River Phafis, and bore up into it about a JVIile to certain Houfes, where the Mafter of the Feluke was defirous to unlade fome of his Goods. . The River Tbafis takes its rife out of caild by the Turks Fachs â– , though as I obferv'd, the People of the Country call it liioiic, I faw it firft at Cotatis-, where it runs in a narrow Channel very fwiftly, yet fometimes fo low, that it is eafily fordable. But where it difebarges it felt intp the Sea, which is about Fourfcore and Ten Miles from Cot at is, there the Channel is about a Mile and Half Broad and Sixty Fadorae deep: being fwell'd before that, by feveral lefTer ftreams that pour themfelves into it. The Water is very good to Drink, though fomewhat Muddy, thick, and of a Leaden colour ; of which Anian aflerts the caufe to be the Earth that is intermixed with it. He farther adds, and other Authois al io affirm the fame,' that all the Ships took in Water at out of an Opinion that the River, was facred, or believing it to be the beft Water in the World. There are feveral fmall 1 {lands at the Month of the River, which appear very delight ful, as being fhaded with thick Woods. Upon the biggeftof which to the Weft, are to be feen the Ruins of a Fortre's which Sultan Mmat caus'd to be built in the Year &gt;1578. Forthrough the Black-Sea, an o/XDolchis. he had made an Actempr to Conquer all the Northern and Ea- ftern Coafts of the Utacl^Se*. But this Enterprize did not fucceed according to his Defign. For to that purpofe he fent his Galleys up the River Vhafts ; but the King of hmretta ha ving laid confiderable Embufcado\ where the River was nar- roweft, Murat's Galleys were defeated, one funk, and the reft forc'd to fly. The Fortrefs of Shafts was tak'n by the Army of the King of Imiretta, reinfore'd by the Prince's of Uingrelia and Guriel. The Caftle was prefently demolifli'd, wherein there were a 5 Pieces of Cannon, which the King caus'd to be carry'd to his Caftle of Cot at is, where they are now again in the Hands of the Turks by the late furrender of the Caftle be* longing to that place. I fetch d a Compafs about the Ifland of try whe ther I could difcover any P emainders of the Temple of (RJjea, which Jrrian fays was to be feen in his time ; but I could not find the leaft Footftep of any fuch thing. Yet Hiftorians affirm, that it was ftanding entire in the time of the Empire s and that it was Confecrated to the Worfhip of Chrift in the Reign of the Emperour Zeno. I fought likewife for the great City call'd Sebafia, which Geographers have plac'd at the Mouth of &lt;Phafis 5 but not a Brick to be feen, no more then of the Ruines of Colchis. All that I obferv'd conformable to what the Ancients have wrote concerning that part of the 'Blacky Sea, is only this, That it abounds in Pheafancs. Of which there are fome Authors, and among the reft who fay. That the Argonauts firft brought thofe Birds into where they had never been feen before, and that they gave 'em the Name of Fheafants, or Thajiam, as being taken upon the Banks of Shafts. This River feparates Mfrom the Principality of Guriel, and the petty Kingdom of Imiretta. is diftant from it ^6 Miles. All the Coaft is a low Sandy Soyl, cover'd with Woods ib thick, that a Man can hardly lee fix Paces among the Trees. In the Evening I caus'd the Mafter to put to Sea, with a fair Gale â€¢,and at Midnight we Sail'd before a Haven call'd Copoletta, belonging to the Prince of Guriel. The 50th after Noon, we arriv'd at diftant from Qhafi about 40 Miles 5 the Sea-Coaft being all exceeding High-land, and Rocks, fbme cover'd with Wood, and others naked.

So foon as the Felouke came to be Moor'd to the Key, my Servant leap d afhoar with a mod: extravagant Tranfport of Joy: he caft up his Eyes to Heav'n, kifs'd the Earth 5 he be- iftow'd a Thoufand Curfes upon Mingrdia , but to the Country of the Turh^she wifli'd all the Happinefs imaginable. Pre- fently after, leaving me, he went into the Caftle, at a time that I had more need of him then ever. And indeed I had a great Jealoufie that he was gone to difcover as much as he thought he knew concerning me. For when the Officer of the Cuftom-Houfe and the Deputy-Governor came to take No tice what was unladed out of the Felouke, and to demand the Cuftoms, they prefently gave me to underftand, that they knew I was an European, told me the Misfortunes which had befall'n me in Mingrelia, and the Defign which I had to go to Which furpriz'd me extreafnly, perceiving fo well that I was betray'd. Neverthelefs I was not at all troubl'd at it; for GOD through his Mercy ftill infpir'd me with Refblution. Befides, I was fiire of one thing, that my Servant did not know particularly who I was. I had entertain'd him into my , â–  t lerviceibrmgh the Black-Se^ and Colchig. fervice'tis true, at Confianthjople, and hehad feen me frequent ly Vifit the European Ambaffadors and Minifters, and that I was honourably receiv'd, and that all the reft of my time I fpent in Writing and Reading; ib that all he could guefs from thence, was ottly that I might be fome Perlan that Travell'd out of Curiofity. I had given him Inftnuftions alfo to tell the Turks \( they enquir'd, that I was a Merchant^ and that be- ing come into Mingrelia to buy Hawks, to carry into the People of the Country had Robb'd me of all I had, and' that I was going to demand Juftice from the of Akal- %ike. Ahd I kept conftant to this Story, hot knowing any better way to conceal my felf; befides that I would not by any alteration of my Inftrudions, feem to take any notice to my Servant, that I was Jealous of his Infidelity.' The Officer of the Cnftom-Houfe ask'd me feveral Queftions; to which I gave him fatisfaftory Anfwers; however he fent to fearch my Facks, but met with nothing; my Saddle indeed weigh'd fome- what heavy, which causd it to be fufpe6ted ; in regard that the Turkifh Saddles are very light. Whereupon the Officers Poys'd it and felt every where ; but not feeling any thing but Flocks and Hair, they fuffer'd it to pals. As for my Eight Hunderd Pijlols, I carry d the one half about me, the other was in a Portmantle lockt with a Padlock with fome other Trifles that were of no Value 5 but which I knew well enough, the Turlywould be fingring, had tlicy once but fix'd their Eyes upon 'em. True it is, that when I parted from Mingrdia^I had refolv'd to have given that Cloak Bag- to one of the Seamen, fo foon as we fhould land at a Neighbouring Port of which I have already fpoken. For they never meddle With the Seamen's Packs, and very rarely fearch the Feloukgs themfelves. But the Wind being fair, we never put in to that Port ; which was the reafon I did not do as I inrended : for it would have been a piece of Imprudence to have done it publickly in the where there were fd many Paflengers. The Officers of the Cuftom-Honle therefore being inform'd of what I had, went into the and there finding the Cloak Bag, demanded whole it was, to which I prelently an- fwerd, that twas mine, but that there was nothing in it that pay'd Cuftom. However, the Cuftomer commanded me to open it: to which I reply'd. That I would willingly do it at his Hotiie, but not a (hoar before lb many People. There upon the Officers carry d me home, and the Deputy Cover* nor160 The Trawls of Sir John Chardin Perfia, nor went along with him: where the Deputy took one per and the Officers of the Cuftoms Five i' the Hunderd So that they took fromme Twenty Two Piftols in Gold, and what they thought fit befides of the Trifles that were in the Cloak Bag, and among the reft a fmall pair of Piftols, which were all the Arms I had : for which he pay'd me, 'tis true â€¢, but not above half the Value. Afterwards he invited me to lye at his Houfe, to which I anfwer'd, That fure he did but laugh at me to offer me his Houfe, after he had unjuftly made me pay Cu- ftoms for the Gold and Silver which I had, that never pay'd any Duty's. To which he reply'd, That I was mif-inform'd, and that he had done me no unjuftice, for that at Gonie there Was nothing exempted from paying the Cuftom; and therefore as for offering me his Houfe it was out of kindnefsand favour that he did it. I return'd him Thanks, and told him, That fince he was fo forward as to offer me akindnefs, there was one for which I fhould for ever be oblig'd to thank him j that he would fo far afflft me with a Convenience, that I might get fafe to Akahikgfor it being known over all that I had a Bag of Gold, I had reafon to fear being Murderd in the Moun tains, over which my Road lay, for the remainder of what I carry'd about me. That I was a Stranger, and without Wea pons to defend my felf, he himfelf having tak'n from me all the Arms I had left me j and therefore that he would be pleas'd to lend me fome Afllftance. To which he anfwer'd. That I needed not to be in fuch a Panick Fear, for that, Thanks be to GOD, I was now in the Country of the Faithful (the Epi thet which the TÂ«r^f affume to themfelves) where I had no reafon to be afraid either of being Robb'd or Murder'd. That he would Warrant me my Life and my Goods; that I might carry my Bag of Gold upon my Head, and Travel without any danger. But as to what remain'd, becaufe the way to Jkahike was very bad, the two firft Days Journey being to be Travel I'd a Foot, through the narrow and Craggy Paffages of the Mountains, where no Horfe was able to pais, he would appoint me the next Morning, fuch as fliould carry my Bag gage, and conduct me for the firft Days Journey ; where like- wife the firft Guides fliould be reliev'd by others, till I came to Ahglvdhg. Having fo faid, He offer'd me a Third time to come and fpend the Night at his Houfe, and was very importunate with me i and I found afterwards that he did it fincerely and tor my Good. I wifh to GOD I had perceiv'd his kindnefs, but + *through the BlacJc-Sea, and Colchis. 1 6 1 I forefaw not the Danger that my III Fortune was preparing for me. I was fearful that the Cuftomers Defign in inviting me to his Houfe, was only that he might have an Opportunity tofearch my Packs the moreexafily ; befides, that I was de- fperately afraid, left it (hould come into his Head to fearch my felf, having a large Bag of Gold and Pearls in feveral parts of my Cloaths. It was almoft Night when I took my leave of theCuftom- Houfe-Officer at his own Houfe; and my Servant had carry'd all my Baggage to the place where the People were gone to lodge that came along with me in the Veffel j which was a pi- tiful Scraw-lofe, full of Holes in the Walls on every fide, and no lefs nafty and (linking withal. There I receiv'd their Com* piements of Condolement, if I may fo call 'em 5 and to fay truth, unlefs it were my Servant, who had his lhare of the Twenty Two Tifiols, all the reft were forty for my lofs; and every one blam'd^ me for not giving my Bag to fome-body that might have fecur'd it for me. So that I was forc'd to ad the part of one that was troubl'd and griev'd for what had hap- pen'd, though in my Heart I was not a little glad I had fcap'd fo, and all I defir'd was only to fee the return of Day-liahr, that T might get rid of that Cut-throat place. But while I was eating a Morlel of Bisket, in came a Jani- fary to tell my Servant, that the Deputy-Governor would fpeak with him : for the Commander of the Caftle being ab- fent, the Deputy fupply'd his place. Away Went my Servant, and about an Hour after, the fame Janifary came for me like- wife. I found the Deputy-Governor fitting at the Table with my Servant, both very Drunk : and firft of all he forc'd me to Eat and Drink whether I would or no: then he told me. That all the Chriftians that belong'd to the Church who pafs'd through Gonie, were oblig'd to give his Maftcr Two Hunderd Ducats, which makes about a Hunderd Pound ; that I was one of thofe Ecclefiafticks, and therefore mnft pay fo much Money. To which I anfwer'd, That I was a Merchant, and that he was mif-inform'd, and that feeing the Officer of the Cuftom-Houle had let me go, he had nothing to do to take &lt; Cognizance who I was. However, if there were any thing due to the Governor, that I would pay it the next Morning i and that the Night was no time to dilcourfc the Bufinefs: and having lb laid, I was about to rife and be gone. But I was ftopp d by two Janifaries 5 at what time the Deputy-Governor eaus d me to fit down again, and fbrc'd me to Drink very t hard 5The Travels of Sir John Chard in Perfia, hard v teizing me for two Hours together with a Thoufand Impertioencies ; and among other things telling me, Xhat all the Goods of the Chriftians belong'd of Right to the Turks, that the Ualtefe's had tak n two of his Brothers, and that for a Perfon of my Circumftances Twenty was fufficient. I confefs I found my felf but in a fcurvy Condition, having to do with People that were Fuddl'd, and my Servant in ftead of affifling me, fitting at the Table with my Judge, a Thou fand times more my Mafter, then I was his, as of right I ought to have been : yet though Iperceiv'd his Treachery, durft not fpeak a word, for fear of worfe that might befal me. I took him therefore afide, and advis'd him not to lofe the Op- portunity of making me more fenfible then ever of that Fide lity wherewith he had ferv'd me : that only he could recon cile the Bufmefs, and that therefore gave him Power to of- fer Twenty Ducats for an Accommodation. My defign by that counterfeit Confidence, which could do me no harm, was to bridle the Villany of the Tray tor, and to prevent him from ufing Extremity. After that, Iaddrefs'd my felf to the De puty-Governor with Intreaties, menacing Hints, and Remon- ftrances that no body for the future would come near Conie, when they fliould underftand that Patfengers were us'd with fo much Violence and Injuftice. To which the Deputy-Go vernor anfwer'd laughing, ThutGon was none of his Lively- hood, that he had but a Year to tarry there, that he car'd not whether any body came thither or no after he was gone; then, let the Caftle fink if it would i and that he was all for the pre- fent Opportunities, without any regard of the future ; and at length it came to that heighth,that the Deputy-Governor find ing he could not oblige me to fatisfie his Demands, fent for my Baggage; which the Tray tor of a Servant, my Man, was very officious to fetch. Prefently the Governor commanded me to take out the Gold 5 but refus'd to obey him, and told him withal. That I would not give him a Farthing, let him do his worft; for that Iow'd htm nothing: that could not with- ftand his Violence, fothat he might take what he pleas'd, but that I knew the way to have SatisfafHon. Thereupon the Robber fent for Chains and an Iron Collar, which did not a little daunt me, confidering I had to do with Souldiers, whom the fight of Gold and the Wine which they had drank to ex- cefs, render'd unlimited in their Aftions. At the fame time alfo, one of the Souldiers came to me, and whifperd me in die Ear, The more ye peel Garlic^ As muchthrough the Black -Sea., and the Colchis. 163 much as to fay, The longer you delay to accommodate a wrangling Bufinefsj the more you intreague it. My Servant likewife pronounc'd Sentence againft me for a Hunderd Ducats. To be fhort, I gave 'em the Summ, and four more to the Ja- niiaries, who had performed the Office of Bayliffs. The Goods that I had about me, and at my Lodging, the place where I was, and a Hunderd other good Confiderations made me then give way: whereas in another Condition, I fliould never have fubmitted to their Threats, nor fear'd their Chains, but have wrefted my felf out of their Clutches Scotfree or elfe with very little lols. For to fliew that it was more then they could anfwer, the Deputy Governor, as I was about to tell out the Money, conltrain'd me to fwear upon the Gofpel, that I gave it him freely, and that I would not fpeak a word of it to any perfon. Whereupon arofe a frefh difpute, and as hot as the former: for I was unwilling to fwear, as being re- folv'd to have made a loud complaint, and defirous withal to fecure my felf for the future by the obftinacy of my prefent Refiftance. But this fame Highway-Man of a Governor ab- folutely refus'd to take the Hunderd but upon that Condition. And therefore there was no other way, but I muft fwear what he would have me in his prefence, and defire him to accept the Money. The next Day, betimes i' the Morning the under Officers of the Cuftom-Houfe came to my miferable Lodging, and watch'd me all along till I was ready to depart. They had order, ic feems, to make a new Inquifition into my Saddle, and to fearch my Clothes. To that pnrpofe they call d my Man, and told him their Errand in the moft Civil and Courteous Terms they could: and fo they fell to fearching the Saddle a feciond time, I my felf trembling for Fear, all the while it was in their Hands. However they felt nothing that augmen ted their miftruft,- only the weight amus'd 'em. Which when I perceiv'd to be the only thing that gravell'd em, I told em, I had made it fo heavy, that it might ferve me for a Pack Sad dle upon occafion; which was the reafon it was fo unweildy : and that evafion it was thatfav'd me, and fatisfi'd their Curio- fity. After that, I found they had a mind to be (earching my Cloathes; for they took meafide one after another, and told me if I had any thing about me, which the Cuftomer had not feen, that I fhould make 'em a prefent, and they for their parts would never diicover me. Friends, anfwer'd I, never feek tor a far -fetch'd excufe to iearch me, but if you have a mind, doThe Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, do it without any more ado. And with that I open'd my breaft, and fhew'd 'em my Pockets .â€¢ by which Bravado I elcap'd Â» for the Officers thought I would never have been fo bold, had I been afraid of their groaping. Thereupon they forbore to fearch me ; but carry'd me to the Cuftomer, to whom with feigned Tears in my Eyes, and Counterfeiting a profound trouble of mind, I acknowledg'd how that becaufel did not lodge at his Houfe, I had been defpoil'd of part of my Gold. I gave ye good advice, anfwer'd he, for I was afraid what would hap pen 5 and then he importun'd me to tell him how much they had tak'n, and who had done it, aflliring me that fhould have Juftice certainly done me: to which reply'd, that they had threaten'd to kill me if I told. Which was very true, befides that I had fuch an Impatient defire to be out of that I had no mind to be commencing of Suits. Only de- llr'd the Cuftomer to be as good as his word. Which he was, and appointed me two Men to carry my Baggage, and a 'Tn}\ to accompany me to JkaLike. He alfo order'd the two Men to bring a note back under my hand to affure him that was fafely arriv'd at my firft Journeys end; and gave the TnrlÂ± a Paffport, in the form of an order, to make ufe of upon the Road. Which I thus Tranflated from the Original. Guards of the Highway y (provojis. con' duB from Journeys end t Gate of Aflan-Paflia, John for his Money Hosfes and His Terfon and his Goods in Charge to the Inhabitant which he jhall pafs 5 for upon their Lives. The Cuftomer, when he gave the Note to the that was to be my Guide, told me, that he had made me to pafs for the Bajhds Banker, and that I lliould get a white Turbant for my felf and my Servant, that I might be the more refpeded. Which Idid, and fet forward about eight of the Clock in the Morning, tranfported with Joy to fee my felf at Liberty out of fuch a wicked and Dangerous Place in a Country of Free' dom, where I had little or nothing to fear. began then to breath a little, and to recollect and recompofe my Spirits, ha ving been for five Months in continual Tribulations, Anxieties and Agitations of Mind. Taxations, Shipwrack, Slavery, Wedlock, lofs of Goods, of Liberty and Life, where thethrough the Black-Sea, arid o/^ColchiS. 165 frightful Ideas that daily hover'd before my Eyes^ befides a thou^ fand Other real Gaiamities that kept me all that time continually deprefs'd under the weight of my Misfortunes. But that Day [ recover'd my felf, and with a pleafure unexprefflble, F felt my Heart to expatiate it felfj and reafTume its peaceable Motions. I afcended Mount Caucajws with fuch a nimblenefs of Heels, rhat my Porters flood in Admiration : fo nimble is the Man that has no burthen upon his Heart. And I may truly fay without any Hyperbole's or Metaphors, that I was like one, from whofe Shoulders they had remov'd a Mountain, fo that me thought I could have flown f the Air. We Travell'd four Leagues among Rocks; after which I ferry'd over, in a Boat, the River already mention'd that parts the Country of Gmiel from the Turks. The 3d I Travell'd five Leagues a Foot, three Men carrying my Luggage: and frequently we pafs'd by the Brinks of fuch dreadful Precipices, that fcar'd me to look down; We did nothing but Afcend; fo that in Five Leagues we made no more then two Miles of Level way. The 4th I tarry'd in a Village inhabited by Turks and Chri- ftians j where I arriv'd the Day before,in regard the Rain,Snow and- Wind would not permit us to let forward any further. I Travelfd the Fifth an J Sixth, Eleven Leagues. 'Tis true, I had Horfes, but I dare be bold to fay, I did not rideabove Three Leagues of all that way i fori was forc'd to alight every foot: the way being fo rugged and fteep, that the Horfes could hard ly keep their Feet/ The Seventh and Eighth, I travell'd 1 Leagues ; up Hill and down Hill for the Four firft l eagues; the next Eight were all a Smooth Road, but full of Turnings and Windings: and then we got to the Top of Mount after Which we Travell'd Four Leagues continually upon the Defcent. Half Way down the Hill were to be feen the Spires and Tops of the Ruins of feveral Caftles and Churches; of which as the People faid, there had been a confiderable number, till defiroy'd by the Turks. The bottom of the Hill leads ye into a fair Valley Three Miles broad. Rich and Fertile, and full of Villages: being Water'd by the River ifwr, that runs through the middle ofit.- 'Tis known thatis divided by a Chain of Mountains that runalong from one end to the other, of which the highefl: parts Were call'd Taurm, Imam and Caucafm. The firft is that part which advances it felf to the fartheft part of ; and this Chain or Ridg is generally call'd Taurus. I (ay generally, becaufe that every part derives a particular Name from the Nation, to - U u which66 The Ti ravels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, which it adjoyns. The laft part, which is the neareft to lies between the ! Black z Sea^ and the Cafpian between Muf covy and turkey. But thefe three Names are confufedly made ufe of by many Authors, among the reft, who place Caucafws in India. However who reports this in his Geography, affirms that Q.Curtm did it to magnifie the wonders of Alexander 's Hiftory,m regard that Caucafm being the higheft part of all Mount Taurus, and that which the Fables of the Poets have render'd moft Famous, the Renown of his Hero became the greater,whom he makes to force his way over it with his Victorious Sword. And indeed I fhould have thought it had been a fault in Geography, which CK_ committed igno- rantly, as when he brings Ganges from the South, and takes Jaxartes for the River Tanais. I fay I fliould take it for an Error, if I did not find him in his Sixth Book, putting the Mountain Catieafus between Hircania and the River fhafis. But to return to the Defcription of Mount Caucafus, it is the higheft Mountain, and moft difficult to pals over that ever I be held. For it is full of Rocks and dilmal Precipices, through which there have been great endeavours us'd to make a hollow way. At the time when I pals'd it,it was all cover'd with Snow,in many places above Ten Foot deep : fo that my Guides oft-times were fbre'd to make way with their fhovels: for they had upon their Feet a fort of Sandals proper to walk upon the Snow, which I never law but in that Country, the bottom of it being made in the fhape, and about the length of a Racket without a handle, but not fo broad, the Network is alio not fo tight, and the Wood is altogether circular. Which prevents their finking in to the SnoW, for that it bears up the weight of the body, and keeps the Foot from finking above a Fingers Depth. They will alio run with thefe fort of Sandals very faft, hardly leaving any print of their Feet, or any fign which way they have gone, for that the Sandal has neither Toes nor Heels. The Top of Mount Cancafus is perpetually cover'd with Snow,and for eightLeagues in the Road we travell'd in croffing it, altogether uninhabi ted. So that I was forcd to fpend the whole Night in the Snow. Only I caus'd the Fellows to cut me down fome Firr-Trees upon which /lay, after Ihad ordered 'em to make a good Fire. When I came to the Top of the Mountain, the People that were my Guides, made long Prayers to their Images, for their favor to keep the Wind from Rifing. For had the Wind been high, we had without doubt been all Buried in the Snow ; for being loofe and fmall as duft, the Wind eafily carries it away, and M fil^through the Black-Sea^ and CoIchisÂ« i fills the Air with it i but GOD be thanked there was no Wind However, the Horfes would fink fo deep in many places, that I thought they would never get out: for my part travell'd for the moft part afoot, and fecure enough: nor do believe rode above eight Leagues in croffing over this hideous Mountain, which is fix and thirty Leagues, I thought for the two laft days,that had been in the Clouds,not being able to fee twenty Paces before me: befides that the Firr-Trees that grow very thick all over the Mountain prevent any profped at a diftance: only as went down Hill, the Glouds roll'd under my Feet, as far as / could fee, fo that could not but think my felf i'the Air, though felt at the fame time that J trod upon the Ground. Mount Caucafws till ye come to the very top is extreamly fertil in Honey, Wheat, and Gom, (of which I have fpok'n in the Deferi* ption of Mingreha) in Wine, in Fruits, in Pigs, and large Gatteh The Vines grow there about the Trees, and run up fo high, that many times they are not able to climb up to gather the Grapes^ Befides, it was Vintage-time when I crofs'd the Mountain j and I found the Grape, the new and the old Wine, to be extreamly good, and fo cheap withal in lome part8,that you might buy 300 weigh t for a Crown : for the Country People not having Vent for it, left the Grapes to hang &amp; rot upon the Branches as not worth the gatherings The Country People dwell in Wooden Huts: of which every Family has four or five; in the biggeft of which they make a Firr, and fit round about it. The Women grind the Corn, as they have occafion for Breads which they bake in round Stones a Foot or there abouts in Diameter,and fbme two or three Fingers in depth. Theie Stones they make very hot, put in the Dough, and then cover it with hot Afhes, and live Coals over that: and in fome places they bake it in the Embers only.To which purpofe they fweep the Hearth very clean,lay the Dough upon it,and then cover it with Afhes and live Coals as before. Neverthelefs the Cruft is very white, and the Bread very good. They keep their Wine as they do in I lodg-d every Night at fome Countryman's Houfe or other,of whom I hir'd either Horfes or Porters.The Turl{ alfo,who was recommend* ed to me, lerv'd me very dextroufly, and as well as the place would afford. They gave us Hens,Eggs,Pulfe,Wine, Bread, and overcloy'd us with Fruit. For every Neighbouring Houfe brought us a great Pitcher of Wine,a Pannier of Fruif,and a Basket of Bread for theif fliare of what we wanted.For which we never ask'd them what was to pay, nor would my Guide permit me to give em any Gratuity. I fell on like a WbIf,not being able to fatistie my Hunger in lels then two or three hours. For it is not to be imagin'd what an empty Stomachi di The'T. ravels tf Sir John Chard in Perfia, Sroitiaeh I had alKthe while that I was in Mingrelia for three months together, during all which time I could get no Bread, befides that I was al! the while under the Icourge of Hunger, and in continual dread of fome Mifchief or other. But now, thanks be to GOD, I liv'd in lecurity and plenty, and from a deteftable Country where I could not get Victles for Money, was got into another Region where they gave me Meat and Drink for nothing: Nor is it pot fible for any Man, that has not undergone thofe Extremities, to conceive the pleaiure of fo happy a Change. The Inhabitants of thefe Mountains are for the moft part Chri- ftians after the Georgian Ceremonies. They are very frefli Com- plexion'd, and I have feen very handfom Women among em. Be sides, they are infinitely better difpofition d then the and the other People of Mount that are not under the Dominion of the Turks. The ninth Itravell'd five Leagues through a Plain, of which have already fpok'n 5 the Soyl of which is very proper for Tillage: and upon the Hills that furround it great Numbers of Cattel graie. In the Evening Iarriv'd at Akahihg. Akahike is a Fortrefs built upon Mount feated in a holloiv place, among twenty Hillocks or thereabouts,frora whence the Caftle might be eafily batter'd on every fide, though fortifi'd with double Walls, and flanqu'd with Towers, both built with Battlements after the Ancient Manner. Adjoyning to this Fortrefs, which is defended with only a few great Guns, ftand upon the Neigi bouring Hillocks aforemention'd a large Town, confifting of about 400 Houfes all new,and which feem to have been but lately built: fo that there is nothing of Antiquity to be feen, but two Armenian Churches. The Town is Peopl'd with Georgians, Greeks and 'jews 5 the having their Churches, and the Jews a Synagogue. There is alfo in it an Inn newly built of Wood, as are all the reft of the Houies in that place. The Ri ver Kur runs along by it, which derives it Head from the Moun tain Caucafus, and was call'd anciently and by fome Corus. Strabo places the Head of it m Arme in will have it fpring from the Mountains of which are be yond Colchis, which he calls Coraxicie, becatife of the River that fprings from thence, and difcharges it felf into the Which Opinions feeming fo various may neverthelefs be true, and come all to one and the fame thing. For that has formerly ipcluded Colchis-, and becaufe Colchis formerly Was a great King- - dom, as I have already obferv'd. The of lodges in the Fortrefs;, and the Principal Officers and Souldiers quarter in the adjacent Villages. Thisthrough the Blatk-Sea, and ^'Colchis'. This Fortrefs was built by the from whom the Turks took it toward the end of the laft Age. 1 he i .j th about Two a Clock in the Morning I parted frorii Jlytkike, travailing dircdly Eaftward. At the end of three Leagues the Plain of JkaliJke. ftreightens, to the breadth of hah a League, having the Mountains on both fides. In that part (lands a Caftle built by the upon a. Rock, on the right fide of the River i^wr. This Rock below is encom- pafs'd with a double Wall i and round aboiit it lies a little Village like /tkaMhg,which takes up all the Ground between the Forttpfs and the oppofite Mountain; and is call'd 5 havirtg a Garifon and a Cuftom-Houfe under the Command of a SsnrJac. T was in great fear of being there ftopp'd and ex- amin'd, but Thanks be to GOD, they let me pals, without faying a word to nfc. For my Guide was born at a City of Georgia. Sq that upon his Anfwer, to the Captain of the Guard, who ask'd hini. What Countryman he was ? That he was a Georgian of Gory, the Captain let him pafs with all his Train without any farther Examination. The reafon is, for that the Kaan of Georgia. and th'e of hold a very good Correfpondence together, which makes the Turh* (b kind to the Georgians. Two Leagues beyond we crofs'd a Mountain, which parts on this fide 'Terfia honi turkey. We travel I'd along theBrow ofthis Mountain af ter we had crols'd it. There are teveral Villages feated on the top of it : the River i\ur running below through the Vale^ where in feveral parts are to be feen the Ruines df Caillcs, Fortrefle'sand Churches; the Footfteps of the Grandeur of the Georgians, and of the Turkjjh and (perfian Conquefts. After we had travell'd ten Leagues, till it was Night, we ftopp'd at a little Village; The 14th WO travell'd hot above four Leagues, the way being very rugged in thole Mountains, where you meet witH feveral narrow Paths and clofe Paflages, where you cannot force your way ; together with the Ruines of many Fortreflesl We ftopp'd in the Plain df Snrham, at a great Town near the Fortrela, which is call'd by the fame Nanie. It is a very love ly Plain, full of Copies, Villages, Hillocks, Houles of Plea- lure, arid little Caftles belonging to the Lords. The Country is all over well Till'd 5 and in a word, it is a very delightful Spot of Ground. The 15th I travell'd ten Leagues, nine through the Plain, and the other at the paflage of a Mountain fonaewhat high, X x which0 The 'Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia, which iparrs it from Gory. I.faw nothing on every fide but fair Villages, lovely Fields well Mamir d, and every where the Ground very fertile We left upon the right Hand before We afcended the Mountain, a.great City lying almoft all in Rutnes, as not containing above Five Hunderd Houfes inha- bited, whereas torfrierly, by report it contain'd above Twelve Thou land. However, there belongs to it a Bifhop and a great Church, built before the were redue'd under Subje&amp;ion. Night overtook me upon the Defcent of the Mountain, before I arriv'ci at Gory. I went diredtly to the Rcfidence of the Italian Capuchins, Miffionaries of the Con gregation de 'Propaganda Fide 5 to whom I had Letters of Re commendation. Not above three Years ago they had a Dwel ling at Cot at is and then they thought alfo to havefpread them- felves into Mingrelia, and to have fettl'd there. But the Con tinual Wars in that Country, and the Robberies perpetually there committed, the King either not being able, or not ca ring to prevent 'cm, conftrain'd 'em to retire back into gia. So that the Opportunity of meeting with 'em was very acceptable to me ; in regard they were able to give me what Advice and Affiftance I ftood in need of. For that reafon I prefently made my felf known to 'em ; and told 'em. That the King of Terfea had lent me into to do him parti cular Services; that I had his Orders, and a Command di- refled to all the Governors of the Empire to give me Refpe^f, and to ferve me upon all Occafions, and with all Convenien- cies I fliould ftand in need of. Afterwards I acquainted em, That having chofen to return into by the Blacl^Sea, and fo through Mingrelia, I had been furpriz'd by the Wars in that Country, and had undergone a Thoufand Hardfhips; fo that not finding any way fecurely to bring along with me thofe things which I had brought for the King, I had left 'em in the Cuftody of my Comrade, and was come into to defire Affiftance ; and therefore I moll affe&amp;ionately befought 'em to give me the bell Advice they could, and to take that Compaffion of my Hardfhips and Troubles, to which Charity and other Confiderations oblig'd 'em. Upon which the Good Fathers were concern'd for my Mif- fortunes, the hazards I had run, and for the Perlbn I had left in Mimrdia. And they affur'd me to do for me what ever lay in their Power fo (oon as they fhould have permiffion from their General â€¢, for that they had no Power to a6t without firft: eonlulting him, and without his Approbation. That he was atthrough the Black&gt;Sea # and Country Colchis* at Trifflis, the capital City of Georgia, two fmall days journey diftant, and chat my befl: way would be to go and wake Upon him. And indeed they gave me fo many reafons to conftrain me to go 5 that I refolv'd it without ^qy more to do, and to that purpofe hir'd Horfes forthwith. The Superiour alfo or- der'd a Lay-Brother, whofe Name was of Viterbo, to get himfelf ready to beajr me Company, This Lay-Brother was a Perfon of Honefty and Integrity, and both an able Phyfitian and Surgeon. His Dexterity and the good luck he had in Georgia and to cure feveral Difeafes and Wounds which were thought to be incurable, had rais'd him to a high Value and Eftecm over all the Coun try. He underftood the Language very well of all thofe parts, as having travell'd 'em from one end to the other ; be- fides that he was a Perfon of Courage, Patience, Humility and found Judgment. He was the moft pleafant and facetious Company in the World, and after I had teftifi'd to him, that his Society would be of great advantage to me, and a great comfort to me in my return to Mwgrelia, he told me, that I had no more to do then to requeft the Superiors leave, and he would willingly go along with me. The i 6th We departed from with this honeft Father, and rode Seven Leagues for the moft part upon the Banks of the River Kurr. The road was very delightful, through fer tile Plains , where there was a great number of Villages. Among the reft there is one City call'd about Four Leagues from Gory., that lies almoft in Ruins, through the midft of which we are oblig'd to pals. The 17th I travell'd lomewhat more then Six Leagues in a level Road, but fbmewhat Stony in fome parts. By that time we got half way, we came right againft the Metropolitan Church of Georgia. feated upon the Banks of One half of which lies in Ruines, the other feems to be entire, and a very fair ftru&amp;ure. They tell us, that there is within it one part of the Crown of Thorns, a piece of the Tunick, and a piece of the Prophet Elia's Garment. I did not lee the Re- liques my felf, but the Capuchins afliir'd me, they had leen 'em feveral times. Toward the Evening I arriv'd at for the Snow that fell very thick all the Day, hinderd me from getting thither fooner: at what time the Lay-Brother who ac- company'd me, conducted me to the Houfe where the Capu chins' lay. I had no time to lofe, fo that as foon as I came, I acquainted the Superiour with the realbn of my earning.The fray eh of Sir John Chardin into Perfia, which my Letters of Recommendation gave him likewiie to underftand. And indeed my main bufinefs was to let eixi know the dartger in which my goods were, that I had left in Uinmlia, and of what importance 'it Was for me to run all ha zards to get 'em fafe from thence. 1 told the Superiour that therfe were in my opinion two feveral ways to accomplilh my defign, both fafe in fome refpeds, but hazardous in others. The firft was to make my Addreffes to the Prince of to fhew him the Orders of the King his Mailer, and to defire his Affiftance to fetch from Mingrelia what I had got for his Majefties Ufe. The Secdnd was to go privately into the Country, without difcovering my felf, or telling any perfon What I went about. Ndr would I difcover to the Superiour my Approbation of the SecOnd way for fear of preventing his Judgment. He defir'd fome time to confider before he gave me his advice, and requeued me withal to acquaint the reft of the Fryers with what I had imparted to him, for that they moft part of them having been in Mingr and might give farther light as to the management of my Affairs, and pro- lliis'd me he would enjoyn 'em Secrecy under forfeiture of the Holy Obedience. Thereupon I fatisfi'd the Superiour, and gave the fame Relation to the reft of the Monks as I had done to him, conjuring em to give me their beft advice, and all the Affiftance they could in the Misfortune that was befall'n me. The 18th in the afternoon the Superiour carry'd me into his Chamber, together with the reft of the Monks, where he lay'd before me all the Reflexions that he had made upon my bufinefs, and all the thoughts that had come into his Head con cerning it: and the Monks alfo did the fame thing. They al- moft all agreed to try the private Way, without making my felf known, which was, in a word, to go fecretly into Mingre- lia. They told me that if I imparted my Bufinefs to the Prince of Georgia, he would certainly give me allneceffary Affiftance, that he would fend People along with me that would bring away all my goods, in regard he was very much fear'd and refpeiled both in that Country and But this Would be to make a great Noile, which perhaps might prove my Ruin, if they fhould wait for me to Murder me in my return and fob me of all I had', for that the Country through which I was to pals, was all a Country of Murderers and Robbers the moft relblute in the World. Befides that the were very perfidious and wicked : and therefore I had great reafon to lock well to my felf; in regard it was not many years fincethrough the Black-Sea^ and Cmmtry of Colchis. that a Patriarch of Mofcovy, travelling through had been ftrip'd of all ; in which fa ft ic'was thought the Prince of Georgia had a Hand, to make himfclf Mailer of the Wealth which he carry'd along with him. Befides that, I w^s alfo to confider, that though the Prince of fliould abfolutdy obey the Kings Commands, and fuppofing he fhould be real and fincere, yet he would ex peft large Prefents ; and that it would be impoffible to fatisfie him and his Retinue, who were wonderful hungry and fliarp for Perfons of their Condition. I was overjoy'd to find that the Capuchins concurr'd fo ex- aaiy with my Judgment, and thought the very fame Thoughts which I did: fo that it was at laft concluded that I ihould de part privately with my Companion Fryer That I Ihould pretend to be a Theatin, who had been fent by thofe of Colchis, who were by War redue'd to utmoft Miferv, to beg relief from the Capuchm j who had order'd along with me one of their Society to find em out, and bring em away. Which being thus determin'd, I provided for my Journey; and to that purpofe I took out all the Jewels, which I had hid in my Saddle, and my Pillow, and having put 'em into a little Trunk that I carry'd about me, I deliver'd em to the Cuftody of the Superiour. And now we were at a great lofs for Hor- fes, for that no body would venture their Goods into lia â€¢, but at length by the power of Money We obtain'd two Guides and their Horfes; giving fecurity both for the Horfes and the Furniture. The 20th I fet forward with Fryer and a who was a Servant of the Capuchin a Native of Cotatic, and Who had a Thoufand times travell'd the parts there about, and whom the Superiour lent along with nle, to lerve tue upon all Occafions where I fhould have need of a Trufty Perfon. And thus we were five Men, with four Horfe?. Upon two of which rode Fryer and my (elf the other two carry'd our Provifions: and all along we gave it out that we were fent to the Theatins of for my Lacquey, I had difmifs'd him, before I went to Tefflis. This Rafcal had plaid me a Thoufand Roguifh Tricks, and had once endea- vour'd to have ruin'd me ; and I have already related how he lerv d me at Conia. The Capuchi advis'd me to have him fent to Prilbn till my return, and then to prolecute him : But the deep fenfe I had of GOD s Favour towards me, enclin'd me to pardon him altogether. I fear'd to provoke the Wrath of Heaven, fhould Tat a time that Heaven was fo merciful to Y yThe Trawls of Sir John Chardin Perfia, me, have prefum'd to feek the Extremities of Juftice and Ri- oour. And therefore I paid the wicked Rafcal for all the time that he had ferv'd me, and let him go, after I had fully difcover'd all the Rogueries and Mifchievous Qualities that I knew of him, and had given him good Advice to mend his Manners. But my Kindnefs wrought nothing upon him : the Fellow was mad that I had difmifs'd him, and gave me thofe Teftimonies of his Difcontent, that were enough to forewarn me of fome fatal Confequence of his Revenge. So that I could have found i' my Heart to have laid him in Irons: and had I faid the lead: word, the Capuchins would have done it in the Twinkling of an Eye, as being in great Credit ac- Tefflis. But I forbore, prevented by that Fate which Governs all Things. I was wholly inclin'd to pity i for I expefted and defir'd it too much my felf,not toihew it to another : and it was no more then what feem'd acceptable to GOD, And we (hall fee hereafter how he fhew'd himfelf pleas'd with what I had done 5 by delivering me from a Dangerous Snare which the Tray tor had laid for me. I return'd to Gory the 21ft. The a 2d we parted thence, and lay fix Leagues fromtJorj', at a Village upon the Road to which I had Rid in my firft Travels in thofe parts. The 23d we departed by break of Day, and prefcntly left the Hoadof Akghik?upon the Left-hand, At Noon we ar- riv'd at a fmall Village call'd ; lying nine Leagues from Gory, and feated among the Mountains. Two Leagues be yond that, we pals'd a Streight, which is fenc'd with a great Gate of Carpenters Work, and .leparates from the Kingdom of Imiretta from whence we rode one League far ther, and ftopp'd at a little Village. The 24th we travell'd (even Leagues in the Mountains) which were full of Snow that fell in great Flakes: the Moun tains themfelves, which are a part of Mount being cover'd with very high Trees. There we thought we fliould have loft our felves : for the Snow being very deep, cover'd all the Paths and Tracks, that we could not fee our way : but at length we came to a Village call'd where we lay. This Village confifts of about Two Hunderd Houles, all in a diredl line, and fo far diftant one from another, that it is above three Miles from the firft to the laft. The 2 5 th we travell'd not above nine Miles, the bad Wea ther, the Snow, Cold, and Obfcurity of the Air in thofe high | Moun-through the Black-Sea., and the Colchis. 175 Mountains hindring us from going any farther : however, at laft we lodg'd at a Village containing about thirty Houfes. The 2(5th, the Air clear'd up, it had done Snowing, nor was it fo bitter Cold r lo that we travell'd Eighteen Miles among the Mountains cover'd with thick Woods. Yet the Road was indifferent, in regard the Afcents and Defcentswere not very fteep. And wre lay at a fmall Village by the fide of a great River. The 27th we Ferry'd over the River, and travell'd Three Leagues in a Country like that which we had pafs'd the Days before. And delcending the Mountain we came into a large and fair plain extending as far as we could fee; and lodg'd at a Village cail'd Sejano. This Valley is alraoft a League broad from one end to the other; and it is very fertile and very plea- lant, as being water'd with feveral Streams; extending it felf as far as Mingrelia ; and being the moft pleafant part of all retta. The Mountains with which it is furrounded are cover'd with Wood and Villages: for the greateft part of the Moun tains are till'd; and full of Vineyards. In this Valley we found the Air to be as warm as if it had. been Spring, and very little Snow. Sefano lay near to a Caftle belonging to an Ancient Lady, who was Aunt to the King of Imiretta, who lay fick at the time that we arriv'd there. Who hearing that there was a Capuchin come to the Village, fentforhim, to difcourfe with him. For in that Country, they look upon all the Miffiona- ries to be Phyficians. Nor was the Fryer unwillingto vifit her^ hoping to procure fome afliftance from her in our defign. But two Hours after he had left me, 1 was lurpviz'd to be overtaken by another Capuchin with a Horfc and a Guide. The caufe of whofe following me fb clofe was to give me Intelligence, that the Lacquey which I had difmifs'd was come from Tefflis to Gory, where he had dilcover'd all that he knew of my bufi- nelij fwearing to ruin me, and that he was gone, no body knew which way. Which lurpriz'd me very much. For I tniftrufted fome fuch thing. I defir'd the Capuchin therefore to tarry with me, gave him a Thoufand Thanks, and highly ap plauded the great Zeal and AffeÂ£Hon of the Society toward me, which they had teftifi'd by fuch an evident and Gene rous Demonftration : and indeed they could not have given me more apparent tok'ns of their kindnefs. The 2 th we travell'd Five Leagues in the Plain already Wention'd ; which is very full of Villages and Woods, and th^6 The ftraVelsof Sir John Chardin Perfia, the foyl fo cxtreamly fat, that our Horfes had much a do to poach along. After we had travell'd Six Miles, we left the Fortrefs otScander upon the right Hand. The People of the Country call it Scanda, and affirm that the Great built it. For the Eaftern People call that Viarorious Prince by the Name of Scander. They tell ye farther that he built Se venteen Places more which he calfd by the fame Name- And perhaps this might be one of the Seventeen, and the fame which is mention'd by Q- Curtm in his Seventh Book. Which I am inclin'd to believe by its Situation, for it is feated at the foot of a Mountain. It is now of no force j confifting only of two fquare Towers, without any Wall, with fome Lodgings round about; nor does it's Antiquity feem to exceed about 500 Years. About a League from Scander we pafs'd through a Village confifting of about Fifty Houfes. It goes for a City m Imiretta, though it have neither Walls, nor any thing more remarkable then any other Villages; we put in, and lay at a place, a League from thence. The 2 pth and 30th we ftay'd there. For our Guides would go no farther. The news of the Wars of which all the Tra vellers upon the Road gave us Intelligence, melted their Hearts i' their Bellies. They cry'd out we fhould carry 'em to certain Death or Slavery, and indeed they gave us a great deal of trouble. Which I endur'd with as much Patience, and exhorted my two Capuchins to the fame. I lay'd before 'em, that I had let 'em underftand at my departure from Ttfflisj that it was impoffible to accomplilh what I had undertaken without a great deal of Courage and Patience, to vanquifli all the obftacles which we fhould infallibly meet with. That we Were to manage our People gently and mildly, and to win 'em by fair means and large promiies. That when we had once got'em into Mingrelia and that they could not go back, the care of their own fafety would make â– em do what we pleas'd. Thereupon we call'd the two Guides, and the which the Superiour had recommended to me, and told 'em that there was no danger, that we had good Intelligence and Inftruftion^, that we had Lives and Goods to preferve as well as they; and that we had given 'em fecuricy as well for their Lives as their Pei'fo is. To which one in behalf of the reft made anfwer, that we (hould give em a Writing, wherein we (hould en gage to redeem 'em, if they were tak'n Slaves in that Journy, or elfe to give Sixfcore Crowns to their Wives, if they flionidthrough the Black-Sea, and th Colchis. 177 die. To which I willingly agreed, and made 'em large promifes befides. Which put 'em into a good humour to go on. The 51 ft we fet forward; though it Were bad Weather, and very bad Way. Neverthelefs we crofs'd three very broad and rapid Rivers, and at length arriv'd at Where We lay at the Houfe of Bifliop Janarel ; who was not at home, however we were well entercain'd. For his Officers Were ac quainted with Fryer Jngelo, and knew that their Matter had a great kindnefs for him. Cotatis is a Town built at the Foot of a Hill, by the fide of the River shafts,confifting of about 200 Houfes. Thofe of the Grandees, and the King's Palace ftand at a diftance round about. The Town has neither Fortifications nor Walls, faving where it is enclos'd by the River and the Mountain. On the other fide of the River Over againfl: the Town , upon the top of a Hill higher then that under which the Town is built, ftands the Fortreis of Cotat of which I have Ipok'n in my Relations of the laft Revolutions in Imiretta. did not go into it, but I law it plainly from the oppofite Hill. It has feveral Towers, a Dungeon, and a double Wall that appears very high and ftrong. When I came to Cotatis, I enquired what News. And the trueft that I met with, and which every one aflur'd us, was. That the new Prince of Mingrelia, and the Prince of were retir'd, finding that the Tur would keep the Field no longer ; that the greateft part of the Gentry, who had giv'n their Oaths, had forlak'n em, and that the of Dadian was preparing to fall down from the Mountains with an Army. That as foon as the Vizier had intelligence of the Retreat of the two Princes and the Turks-t he had fent 800 Men to Da* dian, had writ to him to quit the Fortreis, and to raife what Men he could, that he had proclaim'd a free Pardon to all thofe that would come and )oyn with him ; laftly,thathe was come to Cotatis, where the King of Imiretta had joyn'd him, with the Nobility of his Country; and that they were march'd to' gether in a Body, with a refolution to fall into the Territories of the Prince of Guriel. Which was that, they all moft ear- neftly defir'd, for that he had been the Occafion of the Incur- fion of the Turks, and of all the Ipoil that had been commit ted during the War. For this realbn the Armies had crols'd the Fhafts Three Days before, fo that the opportunity fa- Z z vour'dThe Travels of Sir John Chardin into Perlia, vour'd me, in regard there was no fear of meecing with any Soidiers. The i ft of Jan. 1^73. I ftay'd at perform the Duties of Devotion. But as we were at dinner, my two fucinm and I, with ray two Guides and my at the fame table, according to the cuftom of the Country, where Mafiers and Servants eat all together, I faw that Rafcal of a Lacquey, of whom I have already made mention, enter the Room, together with an Armenian of and a Prieft of Cotaiis, who Came along to (hew em the Houfe. However I was not very much furpriz'd to fee him. For it was a thing which I daily had in my thoughts, confidering the reafon I had to be jealous of the Rogue j neverthelefs I made no (hew of my fears: yet I could not but believe he was turn'd Turkj feeing &amp; white Turbant upon his Head. The Rogue enter'd the Room with ia wild and furious Afpe&lt;St, and fate him down among my Servants, without fo much as faying, Which affront provok'd me to that degree, that I ask'd him, Wherefore hr cam in fuch a fury r He anfwer d. That from Akalnke, and that he had Days. 'Tis the worft way in the World, faid I; befides that the Mountains are all cover d with Snow, like thole that we paft, when we came from Gonia. You'll find it true, reply'd the Fellow, for you muft go along with me to I have Orders to carry you thither. That may be, reply'd I, if thou haft a greater Power to force me, then I have to hinder thee. For I have nothing to do at neither will I go thither. Boy, faid I, thou art ill advis'd j forbear to give thy felf the trouble to do me a Milchief; for GOD will ne ver fiiffer thy Defigns to prolper to my harm. I paid rhee at Trfflis all thou couldft demand : if thou art not latisfid, fay what 'tis thou requir'ft more. I thus dilcours'd him, to try whether I could reduce him to Reafon. To which he anfwer d. That Tefflis was a Place where there is no Juftice to be had, but that at he flioald have Right done him. I reply'd, That without going fo far, for fo flight a Matter, he might find People enough at Cot at is able to decide the difference. All which I fpokein the mildeft Terms imaginable : which nothing mov'd this Vaga bond, who turning to his Companion, bid him go and fetch the Turhy. The Fellow ran out prefently, but this was only a Trick to fcare me; for I found afterwards, there were no Turhy that tarry'd till they were : fent for. However, I was extreamlythrough the Blicfe-Sea, and Colch'isj extreatnly terrifi'd, and gave my felf over for loft. All this while the Prieft of was ignorant of what paft, for I fpake Turkifh, which he did not underftan J ; and therefore he ask'd Fryer Angela what was the Occafion of the Conteft; whoasfoonas he knew, which was foon after, informed the Prieft. I order'd Fryer Angela to tell htm what I had ofter'd the Scoundrel to releafe me of his Pretenfions, that Perfons of Quality might judge of it, and of the Malice of the Rogue that would force me to Ak$l%ik$. The Prieft and feveral Georgian running in upon the noife that we made, took my part as to the Offer I had made, and defir'd the miferable fellow to take it; but the more they prefs'd him, the more Infolent he grew, and the more audacious in his Threats. Which inflam'd me to that degree, chat I was almofl: befides my felf. Traytor, faid I, Then wi chgdmfs puts thee upon this: I te of God, no Man (hall carry me fo Akalzike, and fo faying, I flew upon him with my Sword in my Hand 5 but my Arms were held, while the Perfidious Rogue, to whom I intended the mifchief, betook himfelf to flight, trembling and in great Diforder. After which I did not think my felf fafe, but was willing to have made my efcape. But Steward ftay'd me, giving me full aflurance, that [ fhould receive no Injury in his Mafters Houle, and that no lariy would come to meddle with me. Thereupon I advis'd with my two chins what courfe to take, the Refult of which was, that Fryer Angela the next Morning fliould continue his Journey for Mingreha, and that Father Jufiin of for that was the Name of the Capuchin who was lent after me, as I have faid, and I, fliould tarry together. But the Principal Reafon was, becaufe we could neither buy nor hire Horfes and we knew we fliould meet with none in Mingrelia j which oblig'd us to tarry and fend away the Horles empty, for my Compa nion to make ule of. The 2d. Fryer Angela let forward with the Horfes and the Men which we had hir'd at Tefflls. And I return'd to Chic ark. Eight Leagues diftant from Cot at is, together with Father Ju- fiin. We made choice of this place to flay and expedt the Hie- eels of Fryer Angola's Journey, becaufe it was jiift oppofite to Janarell's Councry-Houle, where he was with the Queen 5 trora who'Vj we might have afliftance if occafion requir'd. TheThe sth the Bifhop and the Princefs fent for us to come to his Houfe. Thither we therefore went, and din'd with 'em that Day, as we did feveral other times, that we made our Vifits. The Queen was a very beautiful Perfon, as I have faid, but her Demeanor fpoil'd all, free even to Impudence. Her'Actions and Difcourfe were all obfcene, without any re- ftraint upon her felf Leudnefs appear'd in every thing (lie faid; which is no Vice, nor any Scandal in her Country, where Dilfolutenefs is an Evil fo common. Her Bifhop Janarell devour'd her with his Eyes. Never was unchafte Love, more open and lefs referv'd. There was no need of more then look ing upon the two Lovers, to give an eafie guefs at their Fami liarity together. The Queen of is ferv'd like the Princefs of Mingrelia h only her Table is not fo well furnilh'd with Plate, but her Train is not fo mean by much. The 8th a Gentleman whom the King of had lent to Tefflis, arriv'd at Janareli's Houfe i and gave the Queen an account of his Negotiation. He was fent to borrow 800 Crowns, upon the Royal Crown which they offer'd to pawn: the Crown being let with Pretious Stones, and might be worth Four Thoufand fiftols. Yet no body would lend any Money upon it. But the Prince of Georg underftanding the need which the King and Queen of Imhad of the Money, fent 'em a Prefent j to the King, three Horfes, a quantity of Arms, and a Thoufand Crowns in Silver j to the Queen feveral Pieces of Tiffue, Sattins and Taffata's, and Five Hunderd Crowns. And the reafon why the Georgia Prince was fo kind, was to keep their Majefties ftedfaft in their Refolutions to adopt one of his Sons. The 12 th I went to wait upon the King : who was brought back from the Army by reafon he was fallen Sick. He did us a great deal of Honour, fhew'd us Extraordinary Kindnels, made us fit down by him, and dilcours'd us with much Fami liarity. He complain'd to Father Jufiin, for that he and his Companions had quitted Cotatis. Which the Father excus'd by alleadging the occafion of their Removal to have been the continual Wars, by which they had fuffer'd very much. I am forry for it, reply'd the King, but I cannot help it 5 for I am a poor Blind Man, and they make me do what they pleafe themfelves. I dare not difcover my felf to any one whatever, I miftruft all the World j and yet I furrender my felf to all, not daring to offend any Body, for fear of being Affaffinated by every Body. This poor Prince is young, and well fhap'd ; j' andthrough the Black-Sea, and th Colchis. 181 and well flisp d j and he always wears a Handkercher over the upper part of his Face, to wipe up the Rhume that diftils from the holes of his Eyes, and to hide fuch a hideous fight from thofe that come to vifit him. He is of a mild Difpofiti- on, and a great Lover of Jefts and Drollery. He told Father Jnjiin, He fhould do well to Marry in his Country. To which Father jnftin made anfwer, That he could not Marry, as being under the fame Vow with the Bilhops and Monks of Imiretta. How! faid he, interrupting Fatherand burft- ing out into a great laughter, ou Monhj have one nine apiece,beftcles thofe of th The i 6th by break of Day I was to my great fatisfadion wak'nd by my Comrade that came along with me to lia. Who told me, That Fryer Angela, together with the Men and Horfes which I had fent, were arriv'd the ninth at Sippias ; where they were extraordinarily troubl'd, and almoft at their Wits end, becaufe they had heard no News of me fince my departure, and for that they could not either for Love or Money get any Horfes to carry 'em into That underftanding my happy arrival at Teffiis, and that I ftaid near Cotatis in expe&amp;ation of him, he was overjoy'd, and that he forthwith prepar'd himlelf for his Journey, having taken out of the Earth, the Woods, and from between the Tiles of the Houfe the one half of what they had hid there. That he had ftaid till the 'leventh day, to the end he might reft his Horfes; leaving one of the moft faithful of our Servants to take care of the reft, which they durft not remove, for fear of endangering all at one venture. And after he had told me thus far. Ne'er trouble your felf, faid he at length, at what I have told ye j GOD be thanked all's fafe and well. And then proceeding, Saturday the 14th, faid he. We came fafe and well to Cota tis about eight in the Evening : at what time Angela car ry'd me to Janatelle's. By the way, I never heard, faid he, till yefterday, how yout Servant that you difmifs'd, came to threaten ye the firft day of the Year as he did, for had I known it, I fhould ne're have ftopp'd at Cotatis. But then, neither Fryer Angela nor any of our People thinking more of it, de- fir'd me upon Sunday Morning, that they might ftay till Noon, and refrefli themlelves a little. To which I confented, and bid 'em get a good Dinner. But as I fate at Table, I faW the Rogue of a Lacquey come into the Room with Twenty Armed Janizaries, Where's my Mafter? Cry'd the Young A a a Ragamuffin,The Travels of Sir John Chard in into Perfia, Ragamuffin, he would have Murder'd me, but I'll do his Bu. finefs for him now. -A nd fo faying, he lookc about the Room for yee, and not finding yee there, he went into your Chamber, thinking you had hid up yourfelf. I follow d him, and throw ing my lelf at his Feet, What have I done to yee, that you flioald go about to ruine me ? If my Comrade have mif-us'd yee, or not pay'd yee to your content, that's no fault of mine; make your demands, and you fhall have it without more ado, only fend away thefe that you have brought along with yee. It fliall be done, reply'd the Young Tray tor, I'll go and difmifs the Turks,and come again prefently. And fo faying, he went back into the Hall, pointing to Fryer Jngelo, There, faid he to the Janifaries, take that Man, and carry him to the Commander of the Fortrefs; and fo at the fame time the poor Fryer was feiz'd and carry'd away. The Janifaries look'd up and down to fee what Booty they could find j and prefently they fnatch'd up our Felts that ferv'd us for Cloaks: they did not fo much as meet with any of my Arms, and which was a more fignal mark of GOD's Providence, they mift the Bags which I brought along with me, where were above Fifty Thoufand Crowns in Gold and Jewels. As foon as the Janifaries had left the Houfe, I lent a Man after Fryer Angela^ and con;ur'd the Carriers to let us make our efeape with all fpeed. So that we Saddl'd and Loaded our Horfes forthwith, and be took our (elves to flight with all the hafte we could. Thus GOD affifted me, and by his Grace and Favour am at length got hither, with all that 1 was entrufted with in For what the Janifaries took was hardly worth two I might here endeavour to ejcprefs the Joy and Satisfadion which / receiv'd upon the rehearfal of thele happy Tydings, but they are only to be imagin'd, nor is it that which the Rea der defires to know. Father Juft in went prefently to the Queen and Janatelle, to make his complaints of what the lurks had done in his Houfe, and to defire him to labour for the Li berty of Fryer Angela : and about Noon the Father feturn'd and affur'd us, that they had fent two Gentlemen to that purpofe, to the Commander of the Fortrefs. For my part would have been gone prefently, fuch was my dread of the Turks, though without any ground : but there was a neceffity for us to let our Horfes reft. In the mean time, in the Afternoon my Comrade hir d other Horfes to return into and fetch what was left behind ; while Iprepar'd to let forward for with that which he had already brought. Thethrough the Bladc'Sea, and th Cbkhis. 183 The 171 h my Comrade and \parted, taking each our feveral Roads : he for Mingrelia , with Five Men and Four Horfes 5 I for Tefflis, With Father Jufiin^ Three Men and Three Horfes. The 22th at Night, I arriv'd at where I ftay'd two Days to change Gold, as well to affift Father to make preparations for his return to Cot at is , whither he was to carry my Comrade Money, and to accompany him from thence to Telflis, as to get Fryer Angela fet at Liberty, if he fliould be detain'd a Prifoner. To which purpofe, Father departed the 25 th in the Morning for Cot at is, and I at the fame time fet forward for Tefflis. Where I arriv'd thanks be to GOD the 26th in the Afternoon, with the Capuchin Fryer which the Superiour of Gori had lent me, as not being willing to leave me withouc Company. The 6th of February in the Evening, my Comrade arriv'd at Tejflk, with the Servants which I had left in a atin fryer and Father Angela. After I had embrae'd em all, Fryer Angela took me afide, fo give rrte an accompt of the Se ries of the whoIe Adventure. You know, faidhe, after whae manner your perfidious Lacquey caus'd me to be apprehended by the Janifaries, who were lent by the Commander of the Fortrefs to feize me. For the Rafcal had told the Commander how that you ow'd him Three Hunderd Crowns; that you were an Ambaflador; that you had been in to fetch away a vaft Treafure, which you had left there j and that by the feizure of your Perfon, he would meet with a pur- chafe that would enrich him for ever. This Tray tor prels'd the Janifaries, who carry'd me to the Fortrels to bind me, and ufe me feverely ; but they had a greater refpeft and veneration for my habit: and befide there was among 'em an Ke- negaclo who caus'd 'em to be very civil. I march'd along as flowly as poffibly I could, and kept the Rafcals in difcourfe, to the end I might give your Comrade the more leifure to make his efcape; for I made ho queftion but he would cake that eourfe. When they brought me before the Commander, he ask'd the Varlet who had caus'd me be apprehended, whe ther I was his Mafter, who anfvver'd. No i for that he could not find his Mafter; but that alTuredly I knew where he was. I leply'd, I knew not where you were, only that when I left yee, you had a defign to go for The Commander ask'd me afterwards, feveral Queftions concerning your Qyali- â–  ty 5184 Trawls of Sir John Chardin into Perfia, ty ; and told me that I muft pay the Three Hunderd Crowns^ which it was faid you ow'd the fellow. To which I anfwer'd, That you were no more then a poor Perfon in Holy Orders,who iiad undertaken to give me Intelligence of the Miferable Con dition of thofe in Uingrelia. Which when I underftood, I went to give em a Vifit; that I was no farther acquainted with your concerns 5 and that as for Money I had none. And that the People in Cotatis, from the Prince to the meaneft of his Subjects, well knew, that I was a Perfon that made a profef- fion of Poverty. Upon this, the Commander order'd me to be fearch'd, and they found the Girdle which you had fent me to wear, where there was no more then only Six Pound, for by a wonderful Providence of God, your Comrade had not given me any Je wels to quilt into it, according to your appointment. There upon the Commander finding no more then that inconfiderable Sum, faid he to the Lacquey, Where is all the Treafure, ye Rogue, with which thou haft fill'd my Head ? bring'ft thou me hither this poor Fellow to jeer me ? Thou art a cheating Ralcal, and I'll have thee Drubb'd to Death. Sir, anfwer'd the Varlet, trembling for fear, The Wealth is in the Cuftody of my Matter's Comrade, that lies at Dog, as thou art, reply'd the Commander^ Why didft not bring him hither ? And fo faying. He fent him back with the fame Janifaries that had guarded me to the Fortrefs, and commanded 'em exprefly to bring away your Comrade : and indeed I was afraid they would have met with him, but I was overjoy'd, when the Janifaries return'd and told the Commander, that the Perfon had made his efcape. Which made him vent his Rage upon the La quey, who was inaftrange Agony, between Fear and Madnefs: at what time he began to open his Eyes, and to perceive that GOD had confounded his Malice, by his miffing your Comrade with all that he carry'd under his care. There upon I gave an acco'mpt to the Commander of all the Villai nies, and wicked Tricks which the Rafcal had committed in your Service, and how liberal and kind you lud been to him neverthelefs, in paying him his Wages, That Evening the Commander invited me to fup with him at his own Table: for he underftood I was a Phyfitian, and prefently fanci'd himfelf to be ill. So that I made him up fome Medecins, as well for himfelf, as for fome of the Souldiers that were in the Fortrels. He order'd an Italian Renegado be my Guards,at what time your Lacquey would have had himthrough the Biacic-Sea, arid Count rj o/Colchis. 185 laid me in Irons for fear I fliould make my efcape. For the Rafcal ftudy'd a Thoufand Tricks to do me a Mifchief. But the next Day the Qyeen and J Cent two Gentlemen to the Commander to demand my Freedom, as being their Phy- fitian, and the King's alfo : and about Noon there came two Gentlemen more from a great Lord of the Country, whofe Wife lay fick i and he had been inform'd, that I was a Pris- ner in the Fortrefs for Debt. Thereupon he fent to the Com mander of the Fortrefs, to releafe me, and he would pay my Debt: but alas, there was nothing more clear then that I ow'd nothing. However, I muft give Twenty Five Crowns to the Commander ; which being paid, I was fet at Liberty, notwithftanding the Nolle and Clamour of the Lacquey, who prefs'd that I might not be releas'd and told the Commander, That there would be a Thoufand Crowns giv'n to purchafe my Liberty, rather then let me lie. So foon as I was free, they carry'd me to the Lords Houfe, to whom I was beholding for my Liberty; from whence I lent to Cbkark to know what News : by the return of which Meflage, I underftood that you were gone to Tefflis, and your Comrade was return'd to Mingrdia, Some few Days after Father arriv'd at carts, and underftanding there where I was, he came to me â– , and then having repaid the Twenty Five Crowns which the Lord had disburs'd for my Deliverance out of Prifon, we re turn'd to Chicaris. Where in two Days your Comrade arriv'd with all that was left behind of yours in : who told us what Road he had tak'n to mifs To which pur- pole he had Ferry'd over the fhafu fix Leagues from that City 5 at whit time the Ferryman told him. That the Rogue who had laid lb many Snares for us, had giv'n two Crowns to give him Intelligence of your Comrade's Paflage : and that the Villain was under the Guard of four Janilaries, who had order not tÂ© let him elcape : for that the Commander was refolv d to make him perform what he had promis'd him. And thus you fee, faid he, that hitherto all things have luckily fucceeded, and that GOD has confounded that Villain in his Wickednefs, whole Juftice queftionlels will not permit him to elcape the Clutches of t'he Turkifli Commander, without receiving lome Punifliment. It was now late ; neverthelels my Comrade and I could not go to Supper, till we had dilcours'd of the happy IlTue of our Labour, and of all our Misfortunes, of which, what I have recounted, is but a part of the Truth ; nor till we had breath'd B b b Â©Ut18 &lt;5 The Trawls of Sir John Chardin Perfia, out ro GOD our Ardent Thankfgivings for his Infinite Good- nefs, his Omnipotent, and his Miraculous Deliverance : For we expeded no fuch thing, when we were in Tribulation.

The next Day following we caft up the Accompts of our Loffes in this Dit aftrous Journey, and found that it did not amount to more then above one fer Cent. of all that we had fav'd, and fortu nately brought to Tefftif, without any thing being either bro ken or fpoi! d.

Georgia extended formerly from and Emrum to the River Tanais, and was call'd being bounded, as I have defcrib'd it. It is a Country very full of Wood, and ve ry Mountainous, that enclole a greater Number of pleafant Plains that run out in length, but are not proportionable in breadth: only the middle of G is more even and level then the reft: And the River which moft Geographers call Cyrus, runs through the midft of it. It takes its rife in the Mountain Caucafus, a Day and a half's Journey from Akal- â€¢ziki,as has been faid j and empties it felf into the Cafpian Sea. I have feen fome old Perfian Geographies, that place in the Greater Armenia. The Moderns make a particular Pro- vince of it, which they call Cand divide into four parts; Imiretta, of which we have fpoken 5 the Country of Guriel, wherein is comprehended all that is under the Govern, ment of A kg kike â€¢, the Kingdom of which extends it felf very far into Mount Caucafus, and is properly the Ancient Iberia i and Carthuel, which is the Eaftern and which the Ancient Geographers call the Afiaticl^ Albania. The King doms of Caket and Carthuel are under the 'Perfian Dominion: and this is that which the Terfians call but the gians give it no other Name then that of Which is no new Name, as being to be found in the Writings of feve- ral Ancient Authors, although fomewhat corrupted; elpecialfy St Epiphanias, who fpeaking of thefe People, calls 'em Cardi als.

Though others will have this Name To derive it felf from that of St. the Patron Saint of all the Chriftians of the Greek Ghurcli. There are very few Cities in all as has been ob- ferv'd: though there has been many more formerly in the Kingdom of Caket. But now they lie all in Ruines unlefs one which is alfo call d And I heard fay, while I ftay'd at Tefflts, that thefe Cities were very large and fumptuoufly Built, as may be Well enough conjeftut'd, as well by that which is not as yet altogether deftroy'd, as by the ruines them- felves.

Wherein as well the Ancient as Modern Geographers agree. &lt;Ptolomy fixes their Country in the which is now call'd Tartary, to the Weft of between the River and the Hippie Mountains i and there it is that the Northern part of the Kingdom of Kal^t exaftly lies. Quint us fays alfo to the fame effeft, that the Kingdom of was near to the River 'Phdfis. And of the fathe opi nion, fpeaking of the Expeditions of Pompey and I confels, I never faw any Perfon in who had been in the Country of the Amazons ; but I have heard many of 'errt tell Stories of thofe People; And they fhew'd me in the Prince's Palace, a large Female habit of a courfe Woollen Stuff, and peculiar for its Falhion arid Shape^ which they laid was the Garment of an Amazon,that was flaiil near Cahit in the lafi: Wars. Shortly we may hear farther news of thele Famous Warriours ; for the Capuchins of told me, they Would fend two Miffionaries into their Country : the Congregatiori having order'd that they fliould be difpatch'd thither. I had once a long difcourfe with the Prince of Upon this Sub- jeft ; at what timej among other things he told me, that Five' Days Journey beyond Caket toward the Norths there liv'd a Numerous People, of whom they had no knowledge at all i who were continually at War With the which they call Calmac, and the fame with thofe which vve call f w â€¢ that,the (everal People that inhabit Mount Caticafm are sontinaally at Wars one with another j and that it fignifies rid-S The Travels of Sir John Chard m Perfia, thing to make any Peace oj * Truce with 'em, as being a fort of Savages, that have neither Keligion, Government nor Laws^ Therefore they that li- neKt to iaket make frequent Inroads into the Country : which obliges the who is the Eldeft Son of the Prince of (jmgia, to be always ready in Arms to repel thofe Barbarians. Upon the Information which I gave the Young Prince, of what the Creeh^ and (^pwan Hiftorians related concerning the Amazons,after I had difcours'd for fome time upon that occa- fion, his opinion was, that they were fome particular People among the wandring Scythians, as the and who fubmitted themfelves to the Soveraignty of Women, like the Achinefes : that thofe Queens made ufe of Perfons of their own Sex to ferve 'em, and to follow 'em where-ever they went. And as for their riding a Horfeback like Men, it is ea- fily apprehended and as eafie to be credited, and that they alfo were Arm'd. For in the Eaftern Countries, all Women be- firide their Horfes like Men ; and fome of 'em mount their Horfes and ride 'em as well,befides that the Princefles alfo wear Daggers at their fides. But as for the Mutilation of their Breafts, and other particulars reported of the Ania%ons, we re- jed em, and rank 'em among the Fables, with which the lea fing Greekf had the Impudence to fill their Hiftories, according to the Sarcafm of the Latin Poet. The Province of Carthitel contains no more then Four Ci ties, Gory, Swam, Jly and Tefflis. is a fmall City, feated in a Plain between two Mountains upon the Bank of the River Curr, at the Foot of a Hillock, upon which there is a Fortrefs Built which is Garifon'd by Native ^Perftans. It was Built in the lafl: Gnrgifian Wars, about Forty Years fince by ^ufian Can, General of the Army: and an Aujlin Monkj who was then at Gory drew the draught of it. How ever the Fortrefs is a place that is not able to make any great defence ; its principal ftrength confifting in its Situation, ha ving a Hunderd Men within it: Nor is the City that lies under it but very fmall, the Houfes and Market Places being all Built of Earth. The Inhabitants however, are all very Rich and Wealthy. And it is very well ftor'd with all things neceflary for Human fupport at a cheap rate. Suram is indeed no more then a Town not above half as big as the City of Gory ; but the Fortrefs adjoyning is large and well Built, having within it a Hunderd Men in Garifon. Near to Suram is the Country call'd Which in the Georgianthrough the Black&gt;Sea j and th Colchis; 189 ' . â–  - â€”â€”__ â€”1 Georgian Language fignifies Time Caj The Pedple of this Country boaft, That Noah dwelt in this Country after he came out of the Ar^ and that his three Sons built 'em every one a Caftle. I fay nothing here of Aly, becaufe I have fpokn df it in another place. The Temper of the Air is very kindly in ; being ve ry dry, cold in the Winter, and hot in the Summer. Their faii Weather does not begin till May but it lafts till the end of November. The Soyl muft be well water'd, or elfe it proves very barren; but that care tak'n, it produces all forts of Grain, Herbs and Fruits in abundance., Georg is therefore as fertile a Country as any can be imagin'd, where a Man may live both delicioufly and very cheap. Their Bread is as good as any in the World: their Fruit is delicious and of all forts. Neither is there any part of Europe that produces fairer Pears and Ap ples, or better tafted, nor does any part of bring forth more delicious Pomegranates. Cattel are very plentiful and ve ry good, as wÂ§ll the larger fort as the leffer. Their Fowl of 9Uforts i^ incpmparable, efpecially their Wild-Fowl; Their BoarS 'Fleili is as plentiful and as good as any in The Common People live upon nothing elfe but young Porkers; of which there are abundance in all parts of the Country: and indeed there is no better Food in the World, then this Meat: befide that the People of the Country a flu re us, that it never offends the Stomach, let 'em eat never fo much. Which I believe to be true ; for though I eat of it almoft every Meal, yet it never did me harm. The Cafpia Sea, which is next to Georgia, and the iCurr^ that runs cjuite through it, fupplies ic with all forts of fait and frefli Fi(h ; fo that we may truly fay That there is no Country where a Man may have an Oppor tunity to fare better then in this. And with the fame boldnefs we may aflert, That there is no Country v^here they drink more or better Wine The Vines grow about the Trees as in Colchis: and they daily tranfport great Quantities of Wine into Media, and to for the Kings Table. As much as a Horfe can carry, which is 300 weight, cofts no more then Twelve Shillings: I fpeak of their beft Wine for the common fort is cheaper by half: and all other Provifions are at a proportipnable rate. The Coun try of Georgia produces a great Ouantity of Silk ; tho not fo much by half as moft Traveller^ report; But the People of the Country know not how to weave it, and therefore they C c c carrycarry it into Turkey, to Ewrum, and the parts adpyning, where they drive a great Trade. r i â€¢ The Complexion of the Georgians is the molt beautiful in all the Eaft ; and I can fafely fay. That never faw an ill-fa. vour'd Countenance in all that Country, either of the one or other Sex : but I have feen thofe that have had Angels Faces; Nature having beftow'd upon the Women of that Country Graces and Features, which are not other where to be feen ; So that 'tis impoffible to behold 'em without falling in Love. More Charming Countenances, nor more Lovely Statures and Proportions cannot be Pencill'd forth by all the Art of Man, then thofe of the Georgian Women. They are Tall, clear Limb'd, Plump and Full, but not over Fat, and extreamly Slender in the Wafte: Let em have never fo few Cloaths on, you {hall not fee their Hips. That which fpoils all is this, that they all Paint, as well the Lovely as lefs Beautiful. For they make ufe of Paint in ftead of other Ornaments: Never- thelefswhen they Drefs themfelves, they Deck themfelves'i'n Sumptuous Habits and Jewels as our Women do. The Georgians alfo are Naturally very Witty. Nor wou!i| there be more Learned Men, or more Ingenious Mafters in the World, were they but improv'd by the Knowledge of Arts and Sciences: but their Education is fo mean and paltry, that ha ving nothing but bad Examples before their ttyes, thofe Parts of theirs are altogether drown'd in Vice and Ignorance. Which is the reafon that they are generally Cheats and Knaves, per fidious, treacherous, ingrateful and proud. Impudent beyond Imagination to deny their own Words, and their very Deeds j to fet afoot and maintain Falfliood j to demand more then is their Due 5 to counterfeit Deeds and forge Lyes. They are irreconcileable in their Enmities, and never forgive. True it is, they are not eafily provok'd i nor do they readily admit thofe Hatreds which they preferve inviolably when once con- ceiv'd. And befides thefe Vices of the Mind, no Men are more addi&amp;ed to their fenfual Pleafures and Beftial Voluptu- oufnels 5 that is to fay, to Drunkennefs and Luxury. In which filthy Divertifements, they plunge themfelves with fo much the more freedom, becaufe they are fo common, and not lookt upon as fcandalous in Georgia. The Church-men will be as drunk as others, and keep Female Slaves in their Houfes, to make ufe of in ftead of Concubines: at which no body is of fended, as being no more then what is generally praftis'd, and as it were authoriz'd by Cuftom. In fo much that theSupcriour + ofthrough the Black-Sea, and Colchis; of the Capuchittf affur'd me, That he had heard the or Patriarch of Georgia fay. That he who was not abfolutely drunk at great Feftivals, fuch as and could not be a good Chriftiati, and deferv'd to be Excommuni cated. Befides this, the Georgia are likewife very great llfurers ; They never lend any Money without a Pawn, and the loweft Inrereft which they take is Two in the Hunderd for 3. Month. Neither are the Women lefs Vicioiis and Wicked then the Men, They have an Extraordinary Addition to the Male Sex; and certainly contribute more then they, to that Torrent of Uncleannefs which overflows all the Country. On the other fide, the Georgians are Civil and Courteous, and more thfcri that, they are Grave and Moderate. Their Manners and Cu- fiom? are a Mixture of the feveral Cuftoms of the Nations that lie round about em. Which proceeds, as I believe from their Commerce and Dealings with Variety of People, and the Liberty allow'd in Georgia, to obferve their own Religion and Cuftoms, and to defend 'em in their difcourfc. You (hall meet here in this Country with Turks, (Perftans, Indians, Tartars, and -, and the Armenians are fo numerous, that they exceed the Geor gians. They are alfo more Wealthy, and for the moft part fupply all the fmall Offices and mean Employments. But the Georgians are ftouter, more Haughty, more Vain, and more Pompous. Which difference between their Inclinations, their Manners and their Belief, has caus'd a very great Enmity be tween 'em. They mutually hate one another, and never Marry into one anothers Families. Particularly the contemn the Armenians with a more then ordinary Scorn ; and look up on 'em much about the fame Rate as We do the in The Georgian Habit refembles Very much the Garb, their Bonnets being like to theirs;. Their Vefts are open be fore all down the Bread:, and faften'd with Buttons and Loops. Their Hole and Shooes are like thofe of the And for the Womens habit it is altogether The Houfes of the Grandees, and all their Public Edificesj are Built according to the Ferftan Models; nor is Building at all expenfive, as having Wood, Stone, Lime and Plaifter iri great Abundance ; they alfo imitate the Terftans in fitting at their Tables, in their Beds, and manner of Dyet. The Nobility exercife a more then Tyrannical Power over thejr Subjefts far worie then in They will make their PeafimtsThe 'Trawls of Sir John Qhardin Perfia, Peafants labour whole Months together, and as much as they pkafe without allowing 'em either Food or Wages. They chal lenge a Right over the Eftates Liberty and Lives of their Vaf- fals: they take their Childern and fell 'em, or elfe make Slaves of 'em themfelves. But they very feldom fell any of the Rabble above Twenty Years of Age, cfpecially Women. The Belief of the Georgians is like that of the Mingrelians ; as having been converted to the Faith both at the fame time, in the Fourth Age, and by the fame means of an Woman, who was converted her felf to Chriftianity at Butfince that, both the one and the other have loft all fence of Chriftianity ; fo that as I have faid of the they hive nothing remaining of Chriftianity but the Name. So is it as true that the Georgians neither obferve or know the leaft precept of the Law of Jefus Chrift. Ncverthelefs the Geor gians more ftridly obferve their Fafts , and make longer Prayers. While I was at Tefflis, the Miffionaries fent to 1(ome a Relation of the State of their Million, which they fhew'd me; wherein I found one very pleafant palTage, which I fliall fet down among the reft as not being either un- feafonable or impertinent. There was a Woman at Gory, who having led a very ill Life, at length fell dangeroufly ill, infomuch that fhe thought (he fhould die. Whereupon fhe fent for a Prieft, and made her Confeflion, difcover'd to him all her Leud Pranks, and made him great Proteftations, that if fhe recover'd, fhe would never admit of any other Man but her Husband. To whom, the Prieft, faid he, hpovoyee tooivell, to believe yee : to leave off the Company of your Gallants. that yon rvill entertain no more the will allow yee to do upon that Condition, impofe But the Woman difdaining the Propofal of her Confeflbr, put him out of her Houfe and fending for a told him the whole Story, and afterwards made her Confefllon to him. The fame Relation adds, that the Priefts enjoyn their Peni tents that confefs the taking of another Bodies Goods, to bring the Goods to Them, and not to reftore 'em to the Right Ow ners 5 fo that Reftitution is never made. There are feveral Bifhops in an and a Patriarch, whom they call Ca Whofe preferments when Vacant are fupply'd by the Prince though a who generally prefers his kindred and Relations: fo that the Prefent Patriarch is his Brother. As for the Churches in .through the BMcloSea, and Colchis. Georgia, they are fomething more cleanly kept then thole in lAingrelia. And in the Cities you Ihall fee fome that are very decent, though they are altogether as nafty in the Country. The Georgians^ as all the other Chriftians that furround 'em to the North and Weft, have a ftrange humour to build all their Churches upon high Mountains, in remote and almoft in- acceffible Places. Where they view 'em, and bow to 'em at thediftanceof three or four Leagues : but feldom or never go into 'em ; and we may boldly aflert, that the moft part of em are hardly open'd once in Ten Years. They ered 'em, and then leave em to the Injuries of the Weather, and for the Birds and Fowls of the Air to build their Nefis in, 1 could never find out the Reafon of this Extravagance, the Anfwers of all Perfons ot whom I e-ncjuird, being altogether as extravagant! 'Tts the Cuftom. The Georgians however are fully perfwaded, that whatever Sins they have committed, they (hall obtain Pardon by building a little Church. Though for my part I am apt to believe they build 'em in fuch remote and inaccef fible Places, to avoid the Charges of Adorning and Repairing of 'em. And now I come to the Relations and Hiftories of the Con- quefi: of Georgia by the Terftans, which are fo numerous, that I lliould have been filent in this particular, if thofe Authors had agreed among themfelves, or if I had found they had been rightly inform'd. Briefly therefore, here is that which I have met with in the Stories of themfelves. IJhmael the Great, (whom our Hiftorians have Sirnanvd the Sophy) after he had fubdu'd the Countries that lie to the Weft of the Cafpian Sea, of Media and part of and that he had expell'd the Tur{s out of all thefe Places, made War alfo upon the Georgia/jf,though they had fent him numerous Succors at the beginning of his Reign. The event of which War was fuccefsful to him, as having reduc'd 'em to pay him Tri bute, and give him Hoftages. Now as well as the Kingdoms of I\aket and Carthuel , had feveral Petty Kings, calfd Erijiares, Feudataries, and always at Wars one with another. Which was the Realon, or at leaft the Means that moft contributed to the Ruine of the They pay'd their Tribute during all the Reign of and his Succeflbr jahmas, who was a Prince of great Courage, and fortunate in War. During his Reign Luar%a rul'd in that part of Ge- orgia which is call'd Carthnel, and is as I have faid the Eaftern Georgia^ and borders upon Eaftward. This D d d Kin?The Travels of Sir John Chard in into Peril a, King left two Sons behind him, between whom he divided his Kingdom ; Simon the Eldeft, and the Younger. But being both ill fatisfi'd with their Divifion, they made War one Upon another, and in thole Wars both defir'd 'Tahrnas to aflift 'em. The Younger Brother was beforehand with Simon. To whom Talmas return'd for anfwer. That he would put him in poflefllon of all his Fathers Dominions, if he would turn fyidkotjict'df?* Duwict accepted the Condition^ enibrac'd the Mahometan Religion, and went and furrender'd himfelf to the Terftan Army, which was already enter'd his Dominions, to the Number of Thirty Thoufand Horfe; upon which he was preIcntly lent to Irfhw-is, who lay then at So foon as he had got the Georgian Prince in his Clutches, he wrote to SifHOH to the lame effect as he had written to his Bro'* ther, that is to fay, That he fliould quit his Religion, and come to him, if he intended to enpy the Kingdom of his An- ceftors Simon, finding the ferfiato Army prefling too feverely upon him, furrender'd his Perfon, but would not abjure his Religi on. But Tahmaf, being now Mafter of both the Princes, and of the Country of Georgia, fent the Eldeft Brother Pris'- ncr to the Caftle of Genghe near the Sea j and made the other Governour of Georgia, changing his Name from Da vid to, Daond-Can, which denoted him to be of the Profcffion. Which done, he took an Oath of Fidelity from all the chief Georgian Lords, and carry'd away their Childern and David's alfo as Hoftages into After the Death of Tahmas, the (hook off the ferfian Yoak,as did alfo the moft part of the Provinces of and they were at Liberty during the Reign of the cond^ which did not laft above two Years j and during the fiift four Years of Mahomet Kodaben that is, GOD : who fent an Army into to reduce 'em to Obe dience. Daond Can fled upon the Approach of the Army. At what time his Brother Simon, a Prisner as I have already de- clar'd, near the Cafpian Sea, laying hold of the Opportunity to re-enter into his Dominions, became a and was made Can of under the Name of During the Reign of Mahomet , dy'd King of Kaket, leaving Three Sons and Two Daughters. OF which was the Eldeft; a Prince whofe Courage and Misfortunes have render'd him renown'd over all the World, under the Name of Taimuras Can which the gave him. Atthrottgh the Black-Sea, an Country o/CoIchis. At the time of his Fathers Death he rcmainxl in llofiage at the Court of 'Terfia, whither he was carry'd by King Tabm.is as has been faid. He was bred up with the Great, beina almoft of the fame Age, with great Magnificence and exact Care, where he had inbib'd the Cuftoms and Manners of the (Perfians, certainly much better then thofe of the So foon as his Father wis Dead, his Mother, a Beautiful and Prudent Princefs, by the Georgians call'd but riana in the Hiftories of ( ?erfia &gt; wrote a Letter to to this effect, Sir, My Husband is me my Son Taimuras to ^eign in 5 his Brother for Hoftage in his Thereupon laimuras was fent back, after he had tak'n the Oath of a Tributarv and a Vaffal. At the beginning of the Reign of Abas the Great, King of Carthuel already mention'd ended this Life; leaving the Kingdom to Luar%ab his Son, then a Child, Under the Tuition of his Prime Minifter, a Perfon of great parts, but of a mean Extraction, call'd by the Mehrou, and by the Terfans, Morad, who was alfo Governor of and Go- vern'd the Kingdom almoft with an abfolute Authority. This Mehron had a handfome Daughter, with whom was paffionately in Love, and by whom he was as paffionately be- lov'd. Nor could the Father, by any means that he could ufe, prevent the two Lovers from feeing one another. But one Day having furpriz d the Prince and her lock'd up in a Pvoom toge ther, Sir, laid he, 1 befeech yee, Difhonour â– Daughter, nor my Houfe. If your fbe is at your fervice ; but if n, with Upon which Luar^ab fwore he would have no other Wife; which Oath when the Prince had fworn, he fuffer'd her to Live with him as with her Husband. However the Marriage was not celebrated, through the oppofition of the Queen and the Ladies of the Country, who protefted they would never fub- mit themftlves as Subjefts to a Perlon of her mean Birth. ar%ah, nolelsglad of this oppofition, told Mehroit, that he could hot Marry his Daughter. Now the are very Prone to Revenge ; as I have already oblerv'd. Thereupon the King was adviz'd to be before hand with Mehrou, and to put him to Death to prevent his Revenge. To which the King confented ; and to that purpofe had contiiv'd it lo as to make Mehrm Drunk, and to kill him at the fiift Banquet the King ftould make. Of which contrivance was advertiz'd, atiy6 The Travels of Sir John Chardin into Perfia, at the very Moirient it fliould have been put in Execution. For he was already half Tipfy, when one of the Kings Pages, who was one of his Creatures, as he prefented him the Cup, and feem'd to Bow to him out of refpeft, whifper'd to him : Sir, Ton will be Murder d At which he made no femblance of being daunted 5 but rifing up, as foon as he had giv'n back the Glafs, and pretending to go out to make Water (which is no Indecorum in that Country, where the Feafts lad for half a Day together) he ran diredly to his Stable, takes a Bonnet and a Coat from one of his Grooms that he firft met ^Bridles one of the beft Horfes in the Stable, Mounts him and away he Rides.

And concluding, he told the King, that he was the true Monarch of Georgia, and therefore he demanded of his Majefty Juftice, and the Reftitution of his Eftate. But Mehrou had contriv'd a fecurer way then this, to revenge himfelf upon Luar^ab, which was to kindle in the Heart of AI &gt; as an A liter ion for Luwz.ah 's Sifter ; one of f he moft lovely Perfons in all Georgia 5 whofe Beauty has been celebrated by all the ferfian Poets. Inlbmuch that in they fing to this Day the Songs that render'd her Beauty renown'd above all the Charming Beauties of her time, containing a plealant Ro mance of the Amours between and Her Name of Baptilm was Darejan. But the Fici ions give her the Name of Pebry. Mehrou therefore took all opportunities to talk of her to Abas with all the Artificial Language he could in vent, to inflame his defires. Thereupon lent to demand her of Luar'z.ab firft by one AmbalTador, and then by another. The firft was fent back with fair promiles; the lecond receiv d for Anfwer, that the Princeis had affiane'd her ielf to King of Kal^et , who was then a Widower But the more enflam d by thele refufals, lent a third Ambaflador to Luar'z.ab, charging him to demand his Sifter with all manner of fair promiies and foul Threats: and he wrote at the fame tune to Taimuras, not to Marry Sifter, but to come + andthrough the Blaciv-Sea., and ^Colchis. and meet him. on the other fide incens'd at rhefe repeated and Haughty Importunities, inftead of returninp an anfwet to the Ambatfador, affronted and abus'd him to the end no more Ambaffadors might be fent to trouble him anv inore upon that Errand. Abu however was not then in a corv didon to execute his intended defigns upon as being at War w.th the Turkj. Hs diffembl d therefore his Indiana? t.on, and order'd a Carmdite Miffionary, whom he fent into Bmopeto ammate the Chriftian Princes to a War aaainft the Ur^to take Georgia, in his way, and to admonifl,^â„¢ by no means to ;oyn with the nor to give 'em any man ner of affiftance againft the ferftans. To which either out of too much Fear or too much Credulity readily condefcended: but he foon repented his forbearance : for in the Year 1513 Abas fet forward from Jffahan with a defign to make War upon Georgia. However as he was a Prince who among his other Extraordinary Endowments was ex- treamly cunning and referv'd, he manag'd that War like an Amorous Intreague. He gave out that Sifter lov'd him and defir d the Match : that flie had fent him Letters by a confident of her own; moreover that the had been pro- misdhim, and therefore that Lu was both Perfidious and Unjiilt. In the mean time he made his preparations for fome- thmg elfe then to fight a Rival : for all Men plainly peraivd CJ L J Wasre ^ 0 ' v ^ 1:0 reduce Georgia under his Subjedion. He had a great number of Georgian in his Army. He gave Penfions to feveral great Georgian Lords; and corrup- ted the Loyalty of leveral others every day, who engag'd to take his part: He had two of Taimitras'sSom in l-Joftage, and a Brother and Sifter of L mr ^abs. In a Word he wrought with lome of the Frinces of the Blood Royal of Georti/io turn Mahomtans, for the polFcflion of great Employments and Governments. For he thought he (houid eafily compafs his deiigns againft the*Georgians, by fowing Divifions among em; an eafie thing to do, efpecially among People that aie given to revenge. He wrote to Taimm-ds that was ungrateful, a Rebel, a Mad-Man, not fit to Reign and that he was refolv'd to deprive him of his Crown, To Lmmab he wrote the fame thing concerning and at the fame time order'd Lolla Beg, General of his Army, w ho lay toward Media, to enter Geo with Thirty Thoufand lor.e, and to put all to Fire and Sword.i 9 8 The 'Tray els of Sir John Chardin into Perfia, Upon this, Lmrwb and Taimuras werecounfell'd to unite. They met, and communicated to each other Letters: wherein finding the ruin of both refolv'd upon, they fwore one to another either to Perifli, or refcue each other from the danger i and the more to' confirm and ftrengthen their Union, Luanab gave his Sifter, the Incomparable parejan Tai- vrnras. Abts was like to run Mad when they brought him the News; he was ready to have Cut the Throats of ras's Two Sons with his own Hands, and of the other (rian Hoftagcs: nothing would ferve him but he fwore the Death of all together. But at length he kept himfelf within bounds, and minded only to haften his march rather to punifli the Kings that had offended him. Taimuras, fenfible of the approach of the Terfian Army, would have prepar'd for his defence. But he difcoyer'd that a part of the Grandees of his Kingdom were inclind to Sur render. Thereupon he fent his Mother to She was a Princefs that had betak'n her felf to a Religious Life, fo foon as her Misfortune had made her a Widow. Not that they make any Vows, or quit their ufual Habitations, but only put on the Religious Habit, who in thofe Countries make profef- fion of a Religious Life, as I have already obferv d in my Re* lation of the Mingretian Religion, which is the fame with that of the Georgians. Mariana or K^tavana therefore (for (he was call'd by both thefe Names) worn the Habit of a Religious Perfon, to the end (lie might have an excufe to Live more re- tir'd, and uninterrupted in her Devotions. She fet forward with a Numerous Train and Magnificent Prefents j and made fo much haft that (he found Ah as ftill at Iftahan. Where be ing arriv'd (he threw her felf at the Kings Feet, and be- fought Pardon for her Son, which (he did with all the Sub- miflion that flie thought might avail to appeafe the Kings wrath. This Princefs was at that time well advane'd in Years, yet was flie ftill a Lovely Lady, fo that became enamour d of her, or at leaft feign'd to be fo, the firft day he faw her: thereupon he courted her to turn that he might be in a Condition to Marry her. But the Princefs more Wed ded to her Chaftity and Religion, and perhaps not enduring the ftriS Confinement of the ferfian Queens, refus'd the Kings Offers with a Vertue and Conftancy unmoveable, which was to be admir'd in a Georgian. incens'd at her Denial, or at leaft laying hold of it for a pretence, ( for it was thought'â–  through the Black-Sea, and th of Colchis 4 iq ^ he never intended to Marry Kjtav but oiit of defi^n to revenge himfelf upon Taimuras) fent the Princefs Pris ner to certain Houfe at a remote d:ftancc, and caus'd her two Chil- dern which Taimuras fent in Moil: age, to be made Eunuch^ and to turn.

For then it was that he wrote to Iman-K^ooli- i\an, Governour of that City, co force Ketavana to turn Ma- hnmetan, whatever it cod him ^ and to make ufe of Torments, if Promifes, Threats, and Blows would not prevail. Iman- J^poli-Kan fhew'd his Orders to the Princefs, in hopes that that would take efFeÂ£t: but it fignifi'd nothing. Nor were all their Torments more prevalent upon a Soul lo truly Heroick and Devout. She underwent the Pain of Drubbing, fuffer'd the Torments of Shackles and Fire, and dy'd at length upon the Burning Goals; after (he had endur'd for the fake of JESUS CHRiST, a Martyrdom of Eight Years, fo much the more cruel becaiife it was chang'd and renew'd every day. Her Bo dy was thrown upon the Common Lay-Stall of the City. From whence the Jujlin Fryers took it away by Night, embalm'd it, put it in a Coffin, and lent it privately to by one of their own Society^ But to return to the Georgian War, jl&gt;as being enterVl into the Country of Georgia With his Army, guided by and reinforc'd with a great Number of Georgians every dayj Hopes and Promifes inveagling fome, and fear or defire of Revenge attrading others, Luanabrefolvd however to fight it out, hoping lb to fliut up the Terfians in the Woods, that he might eafily there defeat 'em* And indeed at one time gave himfelf over for loft, and thought he had been betray'd. For being advane'd with his Army Five and Twenty Leagues into the Country, Lttanab divided his Forces into two parts, and fliut up the Paffages by felling an infinite Number of Wood) fo that the Perfian Army could neither advance nor retreat. Abas was in a ftrange Confternation, fo that fearing the lofs of his Head, as a Tray tor, Vpon my faid he, I will bring ye out of tbefe S fre Days. And he Was as good as bis Word. For be open'd a Crols-way through the Wood by means of his Infantry, and leaving the Camp which was block'd up by the Getook only the Cavalry along with him. Neverthelels would lead 'em himlelf, and | i 1The Travels of Sir John Cliardin into Perfsa, and havifig pafs'd the Wood, fel into the Kingdom of coMmtttitiggreat Cruelty and Spoil i infomueh that he toin-&gt; mdhded all the I rces that breed the Silkwofms to be de- ftfby'd i bit purpofe to mine pafl: recovery a Country that chiefly fubfifb by making of Silk. When thele Mournful Tidings werfe brought to Luaftab, he gave himlelf ovef for loft, ahd fled into Mingtelia. Oil the other fide, Abas who knew his Corfqtiefts Were riot fecure, fo long as the Georgian Kings were at Liberty, wrote to Lua in thefe Terms: What Reafonurges you to flic ?Tts Taimuras that grateful and (perjidiom (Rebel. fnfrencler felj me, and I will confirm you in Georgian Kingdom; but if yon fail to yield your it, and lay it defert. Thereupon Luar'z.ab in tender pity of his People, furren- der'd himfelf to Abas. The King receiv'd him in moft friendly manner, and with a Thoufand Careffes, replac'd him upon the Throne with all the Pomp and Solemnity imaginable ; which was done the better to deceive the and to make himfelf Mafter of the Country without ftriking a Stroak. He alfo made him feveral coftly Prelents, and among the reft, he gave him a Heron-Tuft of Precious Stones, which he com manded him always to wear, efpecially when he came into his Prefence. I his is an Enfign of Royalty faid he and pleafiire you fhould always wear may know yee to be lying. Now the fame Day that was to fet forward for Teffl'is, faid he to make fix Leagues from this place, and ; n&gt;ill not you hear me Company thither? This was a Snare with fair words to draw the poor Geo King from his Capital City : and he was as eafily deluded to go along with him, in regard he miftrufted not the leaft fowl play. In the mean while Abas commanded one of his Guards, a noted Pick- Pocket, and one of the moft dextrous i' the World at his Pro- feffion, to fteal Luar'&amp;ah's Heron-Tuf from him. Which was done ; and then Luar^ab coming into the King's Prefence, Lnar'z.ab, faid the King, what's Heron-Tuft ? t&gt;id not I recommend it to yee as Royalty ? Sir, laid Luarzab, I /7, Mofi put me be fides my Hits j I h humeri every where that I could imagine, can How! faid the King in a great Fury, of Georgia rm dm h;yCamp f fad W Captain^ 1 â€” -i- l â–  u , through the Black-Sea, and Colchis, 201 Captain of the Watch, and thePrefidevt ofjufiice, com to me. And this was the fecond Aftifiec made ufe of to feize the Unfortunate Luar%ab without ftnking a Scroak. Pre- fently .therefore he was laid hold on ; but durft not puc him to death for fear of a Revolt in He fent him therefoie into AlaJfandcKafiyor Hhoping that the had Air of the Country would killj im : but feeing that would not do, he. remov'd him to Sbi'ras ; and at length took the following occafion to put him to death. The Grand Duke of Mofcovy had been a long time follici- ted by the Georgian Princes to intercede in his behalf to Abas. Who was therefore at the Charge of a Coftly Embaffie meer- ly for that purpofe. Thereupon who was- a Perfon of a quick Wit, and never idle, gave order to the Governour of Shamakj , a City upon the Cafptan Sea, where the Ambafla- dors of Mofcovy firft enter into Verfia, to try what he could do to difcover whether the Ambalfador came only upon Luar%ab''s account or no : and whether the take his part to that degree that there was any likelyhood of a Rupture. To which the Governour fent word , That the Ambaffador came only to ferve Luar^ab ; that he was a very great Lord, and that his Iriftru&amp;ions were very pofitive for a pun&amp;ual An- fwer. Upon which Abas, who was refolv'd not to releafe the Georgian Prince, nor yet could refufe him his Liberty at the requell of the Duke of Mufcovy, wrote to the Governour of Shir as to rid Luar^ab out 6f the World, fo that his Death might feem only to have happen'd by accident. Which was kccomplith'd to his defire, and the News was brought to two Days before the Arrival of the AmbaiTador. Abas made the Courier tell his Tale in publick, at what time he feem'd to be ftrangely troubl'd and furpriz'd : Good GOP, fiid he, this is Unfortunate News Hoiv Death? Sir, anfwer'd the Courier, as he wascajiing his Net, fell into , and fltfld hmtfelf. I'll ma^e an Example of reply'd the King, for talking no more care of him. Soori after the RuffianAmbaflador had his Audience ; at What time, after the Banquet was over, and that they had drank pretty hard, the King fending for him near to his own Perfon Well, faid he, Mr. Amhajfador, of the Rufles my 'Brotherdefires of ? Thereupon the Am- baflador began to unfold his Commifflon, and declare the Purport of his Embaffie ; but when he had once let flip F f fâ– x.al/s Name, I believe, reply 4 the King, ^ the Misfortune that has befallen Xmng treamly griev'd for him: I mjh to GOD 5 for I (hould bam done with aU my could deftre in his behalf. Thereupon the Brother of Luanab was made Governour of Georgia in his Room, being turn'd Mahumetan before that: and call'd by a Per fan Title joyn'd to his or the loyal Prince. Abas alfo left an Army in Georgia to op- pofe Tamum. Who at firft continn'd the War with fuch Succours as he obtain'd from the and Chnftian Princes ioyaing upon the Cafptan Sea, into whofe Terntones he was retir'd for SanBuary : But feeing thofe Petty Affiftanqes did him no good, he went to the Tand implor'd Atd of the Turk: Which he obtaind : and a great Army of Turks was lent into Georgia, who defeated the ?erftan Forces, and re- cftablifhed Taimuras in the Kingdom of But he en- ioy'd it not long j for fo foon as the were retreated, Abas return'd into Georgia^ and chang'd the whole Face of Af fairs. He built Fortreffes which he fill'd with Natural V erf am; He carry'd away above Four and Twenty Thouland Families, of which he plac'd the greateft part in Uafander, or Hyrcama, Uedia y Armenia, and the Province of ferfta, removing into their Rooms both 'Verjians and A . He alfo intermix'd Mildnefs with his Severities, to try how far that would avail to jteep the People in order. He likewife made an Agreement with the Georgians^ which he confirm d by Oath for himfelf and his Succeffors, 'That their Country fhould be free from ' Taxes, that there fhould be no Alteration of their Religion. Â«That he would not pull down their Churches, neither would ' he eredl any MofcheesThat their Viceroy fhould be al- ' ways a Georgian^ of the Race of their Kings, but a Mahom - 1 tan : Of whofe Sons he that would change his Religion, fhpuld ' be Governour and great Provoft of till he fucceeded ' his Father. Abas dy'd in the Year 1628. And fo foon as 'Taimiir &amp;s had Intelligence of his Death, he re-enter'd and caus'd the Georgians to Rebel, who flew their and all the that oppos'd 'em ; he made himfelf Mafter of all the ftrong Forts except Tefflis but could not keep'em. For Sefy, fucceeding his Grand-Father Abas, fent in the Year 1651. a powerful Army againft him, under the Command of Can, a Georgian, the Son of Simon that fame Viceroy whomthrough the Black-Sea, an ^Colchis. whom the Georgians had flain. He was Grand Provoft of If pahan , at Abas's deceafe, and call'd Cofroit King Sefy, therefore, who knew him to be a Perfon of great Va lour, and deem'd hitn highly provok d, made him General of his Army and Viceroy of Georgia in his Fathers Room He de feated the Georgians in feveral Encounters, won back ail Csr- thuel, and part of the Kingdom of Caket, audpurfu'd Taimurss who was forc'd to betake himfelf into two ftrong places in Mount Caucafus. In which inaccefllble FaftnefTes, this Prince no lefs Valiant then Unfortunate, held out for (ome Years} though rather like a Fugitive that fought for his Life, than a Prince that defended his Crown. But receiving no affiftance neither from the Turks nor Chrijlian he went to follicit the Mofcovite, but failing there likewile, he retir'd into Imiretta, of which his Sifter was Queen, with a Refoludon there to end his Life, not finding any hopes of recovering the Inheritance of his Anceftors. There Shanav took him Prifofter, when he Conquer'd that Petty Kingdom of and fet-Â» le'd his Son therein. For Taimuras had always filch a pafiion to Dye in his own Country, that he would not make his elcape into Turkey,which he might eafily have done: and befides he confider'd that being Old, the Turks would not have that ref- peS: for him, as he might expert from the Terpans. Can carry'd him to Tefflis, and wrote Word to the King that the Famous Taimuras-Can was in his Elands. The King lent for him to his Court. Where being very aged, his Travels and Troubles of mind, threw him into a defperate ficknefs. The King lodg'd him in one of his Palaces with a great deal of mag nificence, and order'd his Phyfitians to look to him with great care. Notwithftanding all which he dy'd in the Year His Body was carry'd into Georgia, and Bury'd with all the Pomp and State which is ufual in that Country. ^uftan-Can having reconquer'd built the Fortrefs of Gery as is reported. He reftor'd Peace and good order to the Country, and Govern'd with an exemplary mildnefs and Juftice. He Marry'd the Sifter of Dadian Prince of Mingrelia, though (he were a Cbriftian and Marry d already. Her Husband being Prince of G j whom Levari had de- priv'd both of his Principality and his Eyes, for being in a Confpiracy againft him, and taking his Wife away from him, Marry'd her to &lt;I(ufian-Can neither the Ecclefiaftieks of ha nor Georgia oppofing that M if I may prefume to call it lb. The Name of this Princefs wasThe Travels of Sir John Chardiri Perfia, â–  â–  ' â€”: ' . ; j t I &gt; of whom we have already fpoken in our Recital of the lafl: Revolutions of Imiretta.

His Majefly ap- prov'd his Choice, caus'd the Young Prince to be Circumciz'd, and beftow'd upon him the Government of the City j and this is he who is at Prefent Viceroy of ; being Fourfcore Years of Age, yet very Strong and Lufty, So foon as (ftuJlan-Can was Dead, the Princefs his Wife, had private Intelligence, that upon the advantageous reports of her Beauty, that had been made to the King of Perpa^ he had commanded her to be fent to Court. Thereupon (he was adviz'd to fly into Mingrelia, or to hide her felf. But flie took a quite contrary courie ; for being well afliir'd that there was no place within the Empire of where the King would not difcover her, (he went and lockt her felf up for Three Days together in theFortrefsof Teffiis , which was in deed to deliver her felf up to the Mercy of him that fought her. All which time flie fliew'd her felf every Day to the Comman der's Wives ; and then fending for him to her Apartiment, flie told him that upon the credit of his Wives, that had (eeri her, he might write to the King, that (he was no fucli Amia ble Beauty to be fo ardently defir'd, that flie was far gone in Years, and befides that (he was a little misfhapen; and there fore that (he conjur'd his Ma)efty to let her end her Days in her own Country. At the fame time (he fent the King a Magni 1 ficent Prefent of Gold and Silver, and Four Young Damfels of an Extraordinary Beauty. And fo (bon as (lie had fent her prefent, (he retir'd from the World, not fuffering her felf to be feen by any Body, (lie betook her felf wholly to her Devoti ons, giving great Alms to the Poor, to the end they might Pray to GOD for her Souls Health. But at the end of Three Months there came an order from the King, for to Marry her. Who was over joy 'd at the receipt of the Or- 1 der, for Mary was Rich, fo that he Marry'd her, though he had then another Wife of his own; and he has a very great Value for her by reafon of her great Eftate. Her firft Husband the Prince of Gnml is dill alive, redding in but verythrough the Black-Sea, and Colchis. Old, and very Decrepir. Neverthelefs the Princefs was fo kind to fend him one of her Damfels, to comfort him for his lofs of her; and fhe allows him wherewithal to maintain himlelf, but at a very forry rate : However Hie feems ftill to have fome kind of Affe&amp;ion tor him ; inlbmuch that being upon the Frontiers of Imiretta, fome Years fince ihe fent for him, and kept him with her eight Days. At which when Shanavas-Can feem'd to be Jealous, the Princefs fell a laughing at him ; and ask'd Whether he were not afliam'd to be Jealous of a poor, old, blind, miferable Creature, and altogether as impotent as him- lelf. The gteateft part of the Georgi Lords are Outwardly hometans , fome profeffing that Keligion to obtain Preferment at Court, and Penfions of State. Others, that they may have the Honour to Marty their Daughters to the King, and fome- times meerly to get 'em in to wait upon the Kings Wives. For which the ufual Recompence is a Penfion, or an Imployment. As a forerunner to which the M Religion is always firft of all embrac'd. The Penfion is according to the Quality of the Perfons ; but moft commonly not-above Two Thoufand Crowns Upon which account there fell out a very lament able Accident while I ftaid at T A Georgian Lord had giv'n the King to underfland, that he had a Niece of an extraordinary Beauty. His Majefty com manded her to be brought to his Palace And who (hould be fo wicked and bafe as to carry the Order and ferve if, but the Lord himfelf ! Thereupon he came to his Sifter, who Was a Widow, and told her. That the King of had a defire to Marry her Daughter, and that therefore (he muft per- fwade her to give her confent. Thereupon the Mother ha ving made known to the Young Virgin, the force that was Upon her, (he was almoft at her Wits end. For had ra ther have had a Young Lord that Was her Neighbor, by a Per- lon whom fhe Was extreamly belov'd. Thereupon they took at Refolution to make him a Sharer in their Misfortune, and td that purpofe fent him the News by one of their Doffleftick Ser- VantSi Away comes the Lord Poft, and arriving at Midnight, found the Mother and the Daughter with mutual Tears and a condolling Grief bewailing their hard Fortune. Prefently the Lord threw himfelf at their Feet, and told *em. That for his part he fear'd nothing fo much as? the lofs of his Miftrefs, and that all the Anger of the King of was nothing to him in refpe^t of fuofa a fatal Calamity. That there was but one way - â–  ~ ' G g g ' foiTk tfrawkof Sir Jdfan Chardui mto Perfia, for him to difingage hmfelf out of this Noofe,- which was to be Marry'd immediately, and the next Day to tell her Perfi^ dious Uncle, That the Lady by him demanded was no Virgin. This was agreed upon ; and the Mother being retir 'd, the Marriage was Conlumaiated in a Trice. But the Uncle dif- covering the Plot, gave notice of it to the King. At which the King was fo enrag'd, that he gave Order to fend for the Mother, the Daughter, and the Husband ; who thereupon hid themfelves, and skulk'd upand down for fbme Months But at length finding themlelves too hotly pbrfu'd, beyond all likelyhood of elcaping, they fled to the Bafiia of which place has tak'n em into his Proteftion. The fear which they have in of Accidents of the like Nature, obliges thofe that have handfbm Daughters to Marry efil as fbon as they can, and fometimes in their Infan cy. The poor People Marry theirs betimes, and fometimes in the very Cradle. To the end the Lords whole Vaflals they are, fhould not take 'em away by force, either to fell 'em, or make 'em theif Concubines. For certain it is, they have a very great refpeft for Marry'd Perfons; and though they are but Childern, they are not eafily induc'd to tear 'em out of their Houfes.

Stfian- Darejan remain'd a Pris'ner at where the Bafha's Ihewd her an extraordinary Civility. had alfo a longing Affection for her, from the time that he had loft fight of her. Thereupon his Father lb wrought by his Prefents and Contrivances with the &lt;Bafha, that he releas'd her in the Year i 660. She was carry'd in Triumph to Tefflu, where Archilm Marry'd her immediately, and by that Match entitl'd himfelf to the Kingdom of Ciiket, of which he was actual Viceroy al ready. For the Princels his Wife was Daughter to Can, and Sifter of Heracliut, the only Son whom that Unfor tunate Prince left behind him capable of Suoceffion, in regard all the reft had had their Eyes put out.

This City is one of the faireft in all though it be not To very big. It is feated at the bottom of a Mountain, at the Foot of which upon the Eaftern fide, runs the River Which River, being the Ancient or an Arm of that Cyrus, has its fource in the Mountains of and joyns to Araxes. The moft part of the Houfes built by the River fide ftand upon a hard Stony Rock. The City is encompafs'd with very Strong and Beautiful Walls, only on that fide next the River. It lyes all in length from the North to the South, defended by a large Fortrels on the South fide feated upon the brow of a Mountain , wherein there are none but Native 'Perjiatis , whether Inhabitants or Souldiers. The Parading Place that is before it, ferves alio for a publick meeting Place and Market. This Fortrefs is likewile a Sanctuary of Refuge: All manner of Criminals and People in Debt are there fafe. The Prince of Georgia is oblig'd to pals through the midftof it, when he goes according to cuftom to receive without the Gates of the City, the Kings Prefents and Letters; for that when you come from Perfia to Teffiis, there's no entring into the City but through the Fortrefs. Yet moft certain it is, that the Prince never goes through the Caftle, but he is afraid of being arrefted, and leaft the Governor fliould have fbme fecret order to feize upon his Perfon. And indeed the Kings have very prudently eftablifli'd a cuftom among the of Georgia, and the reft of the Governors of the Provinces of the Empire, that they are oblig'd to go and receive whatever the King fends em without the Gates of the City 5 by which means he may without any trouble or hazard feize upon their Perfons. Tefftkcontains feveral Churches; to the Number as they fay of Fourteen â– ,which is much in a Country where there is fo little Devotion. Six are maintain'd and appropriated to the Service i Theother belong to The Ca thedral, which is call d Sion^ is (eated upon the Bank of the River, built all of fair hewn Stone. 'Tis an Ancient Building welt in repair, like all the Ancient Churches in the Eaft ; which are compos'd of Four Bodies, the middle of which is a great D homo , fuftain'd by Four Great Pilafters, and cover'd with a Steeple. The Great Altar is in the Middle of the Body that lyes to the Eaft. The Infide of the Church is full of flat + Paintingsthrough the Black-Sea, and o/' Colchis. 2 og Paintings after the Gree\ manner,, painted but awhile ago, and by fuch lend Artifts, chat it is the greateft trouble in the World to know what they mean. The Biftop's See adjoyns to the Church, where the Tibikk relldes; For by chat Name they alway call the Biiliops of Tefflis. Next to the Cathedral the Principal Cnurches of Georgia are Tetrachen , or the IVhile- Worh^, which was built by the Princefs and or the fmage of Abagare. The Geor call Ah agar e Angus s, and hold that the Miraculous Portraiture which they aflure us he receiv'd from Jefus Chrift, has been a long time in that Church. They alfo call it the C Church, becaufe that Prelate s Palace joyns to it: and that he feldom goes other where to fay his Prayers, or Officiate. This Church is feated upon the Bank of the River, diredly parallel with the BiHlop's See. The Georgians alio had one more very fair Church at the end of the. City upon the South-fide t but the Prince made ufe of it fome years for a Storehoufe for his Powder. And indeed it was fit for nothing elfe, for long before that, the Thunder had thrown down a good part of it. Thereupon the Prince caus d it to be repair'd j and this Mag ftill carries the Name of the Church of Melete, that is to fay. Which Name was given to it, by reafon that it was founded by one of the Kings of Georgia, to (hew his Repentance, for that he had without any occafion giv'n him, broken a Peace with one of his Neighbour Princes. The Principal Monafteries that belong to the are fiacha-Vt wf, that is, the Monajiery of in which Mo- naftery, the Armenian Bifliop of Tefflis rcfides. They fo call it by the Report of the Armenians, for that a Fugitive Bap a of Turkey turning Chriftian, caus'd it to be erefted in this City. Sourph-Nijhon^ that is, to Ipeak properly, the ; and thence generally tak'n for the Holy Crofs. Bethem, of Bethlehem, Norachen, or the New Worl[ and Mognay. Now Mognay is the Name of a Village of near Irivan^ where they have for a long time kept a certain Skull, which they atfure yee to be St. George 's hence becaufe that part of the Skull is remov'd to this Church, therefore they gave it the Name of the Place from whence they took the Relick. There is not any Mofqtte at lefflis, though the City belongs to a Mahometan Empire: and is Govern'd together with the whole Province by a Mahometan Prince. The have endeavour'd all they could to rebuild one there, but never could accomplifh their defign 5 for the People ftill Mutiny'd, H h h andrrr 97^ 0/ John Chardin mfo Perfia, and by force of Arms beat down the Work 5 and abus'd the Workmen. And indeed the were glad of thefe Seditions of the People, though they would not counte nance 'em openly : For in regard they had not renounced the Chriftian Religion bur only with their Lips, and to obtain Pre ferment they ^could not heartily confent to the Eftabliflitnent of Mahometifm. Now the Georgians are Mutinous, Inconflanc and Valiant, as has been faid : They alfo retain a fmack and fenfe of Liberty. Then they lie near the And this is that which hinders the Per [tan from making ufe of Extremi- ties and preferves to the City of Tefflis and all a hap py Liberty to retain almoft all the Exteriour Marks of their Religion. Upon all the Steeples of their Churches at the Top ftands aCrofs; and they are furnilli'd withfeveral Bells which they ring. Every day they fell openly, and in publick with the fame freedom as other Vittles, and Wine at the Cor- ners of the Streets. All which though the ferfians are mad to fee, yet they know not how to help if. Some few Years fince they built a fmall in the Fortrefs, clofe to the Wall that feparates it from the Grand Pia%%a of Tefflis. They built it in the Caftle to accuftom the People to the fight of Mofques, and of the Priefts, that call the Mz- hometans to Prayer from the Top of the Building. Nor could the Georgians hinder the Building of this Mofque, becaufe they durft not enter Arm'd into the Fortrefs, where there was al ways a good Guard : But fo fooa as the Prieft was mounted to the Top to make Confefllon of his Faith, the People ga- ther'd together into the Pia^and ply'd the Top of the Mofque with fuch Volleys of Stones, that the Prieft was con- ftrain'd to come down again in more hafte then he went up: after which Mutiny, the fe would never fuffer any of their Priejis to appear at the Top of the Mofque any more. The publick Buildings at are very graceful: Their Bazars,or Market-places are very large, built of Stone, and in very good repair. The Ior for the Re ceipt and Entertainment of Strangers, are no lefs beautiful. There are few Baths indeed in the City, by reafon that every Body goes to the Hot-Baths that are in the Gaftle. The Water of which Baths fprings from a Sulphur-Mine,and is very hot. So that the People which make ufe of 'em for Dileafes and Di- ftempers are no kfs numerous then thofe that go for Clean- lineis and Curiofity. The Magazins alfo are well built, andthrough the Black-Sea^ and (/'Colchis^ a Kept in Order, being feated in an open place near the Grand Th^ Princes Talace is without contradiction one of the moft beautiful Ornaments in Tefflis ; being adorn'd with fpacious Halls and Rooms of State that look out upon the River, and the Gardens which are very large. It alfo contains feveral Aviaries, full of Birds of feveral forts, a fpacious Dog-kennel, and the moft lovely place to keep Hawks in that Eyes ever beheld. Before the Talace lies a fpacious Court fufficient to hold a Thoufand Horfe j which is furrounded with Shops, and pyns to a long Bazar right againft the that it is a lovely TrofpeSi which the Tia^a and the Front of the palace makes front the Top of the Bazar. Moreover, the Viceroy of Caket has a palace at the end of the City, which deferves to be well view'd and confider'd. The Out-parts of Tefflis are adorn'd with feveral Houfes of Pleafiare, and feveral beautiful Gardens. The biggeft of which is the Prince's; where indeed there are but few Fruit-Trees 5 but it is full of thofe that ferve for the Ornament of Gardens, and for Shade and Coolnefs. There is alfo a Habitation of Miflionary Capuchins at where the Superiour of the Miffions which that Order has, and hopes to have in Georgia:, refides 5 it being about Thirteen Years ago fince they were fent from %omc. The Title of Phy- ficians which they give themfelves, and which every Body there gives 'em, is the reafon that they are well receiv'd where- ever they deflre to fettle. For Thyficl^ and efpecially which is very much efteem'd, is little known in the Eaftern Counties. They fettl'd firft at and afterwards at Cory. Sbanavas-Can gave 'em a Houfe in each of thofe Cities with free Liberty to exercife' their Religion. They brought him Letters from the (Pope, and the Congregation Fide, and in their own Names made Noble to him- felf, the (princefs, the Cathohcos, and the principal Grandees of the Court, which they continue to do at the end of evefy two Years. Whoever among 'em underftands beft, never ftirs from the ferfon of the Prince to preferve his 'PreteBion, which is their only Safeguafd from the Perfecutions of the Georgian and Armenian Clergy. They have endeavonr'd to expel thefe Miffionaries from time to time, as they faW their Endeavours to draw People to their Religion but in regard there are neither Phyficians nor in they make themfelves neceflaryby the pra&amp;ife of and whichwhich fome of 'em underftand very well, and pradinfe with very ^ood fuccefs. They have permiffion from the to take Money for their Cures, and they make good advantage of it, Vhyfich^ being their chiefeft Subfiftence : They are gene- rally paid in Wine, Meal, Cattel, and young Slaves; and fome there are that give 'em Horfes: of all which they fell whatever they have no need of, or whatever they have to fpare. Were it not for this fupport of fbyfic^ they could never fub- fift upon the Annual i enfion which the Congregation allows 'em of 18 1{oman Crowns for every Miflionary, which make but Five Pounds Ten Shillings. Befides the Difpenfation al ready mention'd, thefe Miflionaries have feveral others both in Spirituals and Temporals; as, to fay Mafs, without any Body to affift at it, to fay it in feveral forts of places, and in all forts of Habits, to give Abfolution of all manner of Sins, to difguife themfelves, to keep Horfes and Servants, to have Slaves, to buy and fell, to pay and take Intereft. In a word, they have Difpenfations fo ample, and of that extent, that they pretend a power to do, and do in effed, whatever is permit ted to the moll priviledg'd Ecclefiafticks. Neverthelefs thefe Miffionaries, with all their Artifices, and notwithftanding all this Liberty, make Very little progrefs among the For befides that the people are very ignorant, and take little care to inftrU&lt;3 themfclves, it is fo rivetted into their Heads, that Falling as rhey obferve it, is the ElTential part of Chrifti- an Religion : 1 hat they do not believe the to be Chrijiians, becaufe they are inform'd that in they do not faft as they do. T his incredible Obftinacy obliges the puchins to faft as they do, and to abftain from Creatures which the Georgians abhor, as the Hare, the Tortoife, and others. They faft Wednefdays and Fry day regulating themlelves ac cording to the Ancient Calendar, that they may be faid to be outwardly no more then Georgian Many People at firft repait'd to their Church at Tefflis^ drawn thither by the Novelty of their Service;, and a little Mufick of four or five Voices, accompany'd with a Lute, and a Spinet. But at prefent there go no more then only five or fix poor People, who get fomethifig by the Miflionaries. They have alio let up a Schoolj butthey have not above feven or eight Scholars, the Childern of poor Parents, who go thither more for Vittles then Learning, as the Fathers confefs'd themfelves. They told me often that they did not keep up their Millions for any pro fit they got by 'em, but only for the Honour of the Ionian + Church 5tor on 'gh the Black -Sea, and t Colchis. 213 Church; which, Cud they, would not be the Cafholick Church had it not Mmifters in all parts of the inhabited World In' a word, thefe Miffionaries have no more in all then tiie two Houfcs already'mention'd. Thg Warsof and bmtel, and the Calamities of thofeCountries have forcd 'cm to quit feveral Settlements which they had made in thofe parts. And their defign was, when I parted from an l[ eVe ' 1 other P ,aces u P on Their Miffion confifted of twelve Perfons, nine Priefts and three Lay-Brothers. ' The City of Teffils is very well peopl'd; and there are as many Strangers refort thither as to any place in the World Por it drives a great Trade, and the Court is very Numerous and Magnificent, befeemmg the Capital of a being neyer without feveral Grandees of Note. As to the Name of the City, I could never learn the Ety mology of the word. They fay, the Terftans gave it that â„¢ C f rrain it is howevcr - th at the do not call it Tcffiu, but Cala, that is to fay, the City or the Fortrefs â€¢, which is indeed a Name that they give to all Spacious Habita tions encompafs'd with Walls. Which makes me think that becaufe they have no other Wall'd City in all the Country, they would give it no other Name but Some Geogra phers call it Tebele-Cala, or the Hot City, by reafon of the Baths of Hot Waters within it, or elfe becaufe the Air is not fo cold nor fo boyftrous as in the other parts of Nei ther could I learn the Time when the City was founded, nor the moft remarkable Revolutions that have befallen it. ' For my part I do not believe its Antiquity furpafles Eight Htm- derd Years. It has been twice under the Power of the Once in the Reign of Ifhmael the Second King of Terfia ; and the fecond time, in the Reign of his Succeflor, be coming Matter of if, at the fame time almoft that he took Tattris, The Perfian Tables place it in 83 Degrees of Lonai- tude, and 43 Deg. 5. mio. of Latitude. It is alfo call'd el Melee, or the Royal City, as being the Metropolis of the Kingdom. â™¦ The 1 oth the Superiour of the gave the Viceroy Notice of my Arrival. I defir'd him fo to do, confidering with my felf, that having Servants and Luggage, and being lodg'd at the Capuchins Houfe, my Arrival could not be coii- eeal d from a Prince who had Intelligence even of the moft I i i trivialThe Trawls of Sir John Chardin Perfia* trivial Things that pafs'd in Tefflts, much more of my Adven tures in Mingrelia, of which many People had fpread a report. Befides, I was glad to fee him, and ftiew him the King of fer n's Pa(fports, directed to all the Governours of Provinces, wherein I was effeftually recommended. For I made no Que- ftion but the 'Prince upon the fight of thofe Orders would make me Welcom, and grant me a Convoy, if I fhould have occafion, for the reft of my Journey. under- ftanding who I was, and that the deceas'd King had employ'd me into Europe upon his own Service and Affairs, order'd the Superiour to tell me in his Name, That I was Wekom, that he was glad of my Arrival, and that I would do him a Kind- nefs to come and fee him as foon as I could ; which I was neither in a Condition, neither was I refolv'd to do fo foon : being refolv'd to ftay till I was ready to depart, becaufe I would not be oblig'd to go every Day to Court. Therefore I defir'd Father Raphael, who was his Phyfician, to tell him. That I was overjoy'd at the Honour which he had done me, and that I would not fail to pay my Duty to him, lb foon as I had put my felf into a handfom Equipage; but that I was fo out of order, that I could not ftir abroad thefe Ten Days. I know not whether Father R made a true Report to the Prince, or whether the Prince believ'd him ; for fo it hap- pen'd, that about Twelve a Clock in the Forenoon, he fent a Gentleman to tell me. That fince I was come to Town in a Week of Mirth and Jollity, while he Feafted every Day at Court, he defir'd that I would come and lee him. I was fur- priz'd and troubl'd at the Meflage and therefore I defir'd the Superiour and Father (Raphael to let the Prince know, That I could not yet ftir abroad, and that he would be pleas'd to con- defcend that I might ftay till the following before I receiv'd the Honour which he was pleas'd to do me. Which Meffage the Capuchins promis'd to deliver, but fail'd. They went to the Court 'tis true, but return'd the next moment, to tell me, That the Prince was impatient to hear what News from Europe. But the truth of it was, that they had an extra ordinary defire to produce me. They were defirous to (hew the King of Tetfia's Agent, whom they afferted to be one of their own Nation, to the end themfelves might be the more relpefled and they defir'd my Comrade and my (elf to put on our moft Sumptuous Habit, and to enlarge for their {akes the Prefent which we intended for the Prince. In which par ticular I was willing to gratifie 'em, and in whatever elfe I + mightthrough the Black -Sea, and Colchis. 215 Of inight conveniently do, as being glad of an Opportunity to acknowledge the fignal Kindneffes they had done me. It was almoll Noon when we went to the accom pany'd by the Superiour and Father Raphael, who attended to be afiiftant to us, The Trince was in a Room of State, a Hun- dcrd and T en Foot long, and above Forty broad, built upon the fide of the River, and all open on that fide. The Ceel- ing, which was all of Mofaic Work, was plac'd upon a great Number of Pillars, Painted and Gilt between 55 and 40 Foot high. The whole Room was fpread with very fair CarpetSi The Trince and principal Nobility were fitting near three little Chimneys, which with leveral Brafiers warm'd the Room to that degree, that the Cold was not felt. when people approach'd near him, caus'd himfelf to be Reverenc'd the firft time, like the King of Himfelf. They fell upon their Knees Two or Three Paces diftant from his Per^ fon, and bow their Heads to the Ground, Three Times one after another. Which manner of Saluting the Eaftern Prin ces, the Europeans have always fcrupl'd to obferve. And in deed it being impoffible that a Man fliould proftrate him felf in a more humble pofture, fuch a Proftration lliould on ly be us'd before GOD himfelf] So that fometimes they cxcufe thcmfelves from ufing this manner of Salutation, by faying they are of another World, and underftand not the Complements of the Country. For my part I made my Obeyfance with three Bows, without Kneeling. Afterward two Gentlemen led me to take my place : but I Would not fit above the Capuchins, though the Gentlemen prefs'd me fo to do, and the Steward of the Houfliold who flood upon his Feet in the middle of the Room. For I Was willing to do 'em that Honour, that they might have Honour done 'em by others. Which the Superiour was fo glad to feej that he would needs have me take place of his Companion. While I Was paying my Obeyfance, a Gentleman who had receivd from me at the Hall Door the King of Letters Patents which I held in my Hand, and the Prefent which I had brought for the Prince, and lay'd 'em in order in a large Silver Voider, let down the Voider at the Prince's Feet. Pre* fently he took the Patent, open'd it, and rifing up from his Seat put it to his Lips, and lay'd it upon his Forehead, then gave it to his Chief Minifter to tell him the Contents. After* wards he view'd the Prefent with a great deal of Curiofity and t i\ J ' ; m!The Trawls of Sir John Chardiri Perfia, and Satisfaction j which confifted of feveral pieces; that t fay A large Watch, with a Lunary Motion, in a Silver Cafe, EngraVd and Gilt. A Looking -Glafs of Chriftal of the Rock , in a Silver Frame. _ f A Gold Enamel'd Box to put Opium Pills in. For the mofi part of the Terfians take thofe Pills feveral times a day. A Surgeons Cafe, furnifli'd with all forts of Inftruments; being a very Delicate and Curious Piece of Workmanfliip. Knives with Handles, Neat and Delicately wrought. The firft Minifter after he had receivd the Patent, with a low Voice gave the Prince an Account of the Contents. And I underftood afterwards that the Prince fhould fay, they had never read a Patent more Eftedual nor more Honourable, and that they had very ferioufly confider'd it. All the Grandees admir'd the Golden Charafter, and the Mw/co-Flourilhes in the Margent which were very large. The Prince caus'd it to be Copy d; and I thought it not amifs to give ye the Tranfla- tion of it as follows.though the Blac/c-Sea, and Colchis. The Vaunt is Writ upon a Sheet of Paper two Foot and a haL long , it is alfo beautifi d with Letters of Gold Blew Red and Black. And therefore I have mark'd in great Letter!' what is written in Letters of Gold, and what is written in the' Original in Coloured Letters, I have inclofed between two little Hooks. ' I.

This Name is to be met with in the Alcoran in a number of places; and it feems that the Impoftor who Com pos d that Book alludes to that Paffage in the Third of dus, He rvhois htsfent me. The place this word Bon over a their Decrees, Statutes, Petitions, and al- moft over all their Writings. And fometimes they add, Alia fa a Alla^ that is to fay, He who is, is COD Moji High, 2. Thcfe words ought to refer to the bottom of the after thefe. Being a Decree from all things as much as to fay. That GOD is ftill above. The Terfians have this Cuftom in any Aft or Decree, never to put the Name of GOD at the bottom of the Leaf; but they place it aE the top upon the fide,and leave a Blank in that part to which it ought to refer. And this fame CircumfpefHon they obferve with great Superftition, believing that they who fail therein, ail of their Refpedt to GOD. They have the fame Refpedt Jor the King and the reft of his Minifters, in their Juridical Writings, their Petitions, and their Publick Ads: for they never infert 'em into the Body of the Writing, but always at the top of the Page upon the Right-Hand. 9. This word Prophetic^ fet at the top, for the reafon al- ready obferv d, is relative to that at the bottom of the Patent: fhe Holy Flight, to fignifie that the Computation of Time Which begins from the Flight of Mahomet from to is an Epoche of Sacred Inftitution, and that it took its Original and it's Beginning from the time that the Perfon whom they call by way of Excellency, The Pro began his Miffion.

Caagon is the Name of an Ancient King of China Nor is there any one over the whole whofe Memory is more Venerable. It feems, by what they report, that he was more particularly Illuftrious in his Country for his Go vernment in Peace and Adminiftration of Juftice, then for his Feats of Arms. Therefore the Eaftern Monarchs afiume his Name to themfelves, as the Roman Emperors call'd themfelves C&lt;tfars.

In the Original it is Hamha that is, Flying 1.8.

The Impreflion of the Seal, Which is at the bottom of the Date in the Tran{lation,is not only upon the back of the Pa tent, but at the bottom likewilc. This is the Seal of the Prime Minifter, who is Call'd Mahomet The Tcrjlans never put their Qualities in their Seals, nor any Title by which they may be known. There is only their own Name ; their Fa thers Name, which ferves in ftead of a Sirname, according to the fafhion of the Hebrews 5 and the Name of their Family when it has the Honour to be defcended from by his Daughter Pafima. For the Mahometans acknowledge no Nobility then to be the Original Branches of that Progeny. I had alfo joyn'd to the King of Ter/ta's Patent a Note of Recommendation from the High Steward of his Houfliold ; which I Was defirous the Viceroy fhould fee, as being affor d that it would work more efFedually then the Patent it felf. Which prov'd to be true ; infomnch that I underftood after wards, that it was to that Note, to which I was beholding for all the good Offices and Honours which I receiv'd at Tefflis / which was as follows.

For fo the Grandees of 'Perfia write to the Inferiour Cfficers: efpecially when thole Officers have their dependance upon 'em. This they do to maintain the difFerence which their Authority and Imployment,puts between 'em : and that there may not be any confufion by their manner of Cotntnunieatioh one with another. iThe Word which I have Trinflated Wardrobe is Which fignifles properly Chief and alfo a Magazine. For the King and the Grandees of Terfia keep in their Houfes Manufactures of all forts of Trades and Arts. They call rhofe places Carcone, or They are like the Gallery of the Grand Duke of or the Gal leries in the Louvre in France. They maintain therein a great number of excellent Maftefs^ who have there a Penfion and their Dyet as long as they Live: and they find 'em Materials for their Work. And they make 'em Prefents, or advance their pay upon every Curious Piece which they finifh. 5. 'Tis out of Pride and Vainglory that they exprels therri- lelves in theie Terms. Worthy the Kjng. As much as to fay, that the Kings Wardrobe is lb full of rare and pretious Jewels, that no body can bring any thing that is fit to be put therein. And therefore Elo quence makes very much ufe of this Circumlocution of Lan guage upon all occafions. So fpeaking of an AmbalXidor that has pay'd his Obeyfance to the King, they fay, kifs'd the Feet of the Slaves of Kjng. In like manner; when they would fay, that the King has pefform'd any great Adion, they fay, The Slaves of a great ASiion. Forms of Speech that fufficiently difcover the Vanity of theEaftern People. I take em to be drawn from the Alcoran^ which the Mahometans affirm to be the foiirce of true Eloquence. There you (hall meet with many fuch like Expreffions. As for Example, fpeaking of the Works of GODj they call 'em, The Works Created the Heavens and the Earth Which, fay the Mahome tans, more clearly exprefles the Power of GOD. For if the Angels have fb much Power as to Create Worlds, how great muft be his Power whofe only Servants and Minifters they ate ? In fhortj all the Orientals are perfect Slaves j their Soveraigns224 The T ray els of Sir John Chardin Perfia, having a right to command their Lives, and Fortunes, their Wives and Childern. But they are fo far from being terrifi'd with their condition, that they Glory in it. The Grandees themfelves count it an Honour to be calFd Slaves: and Sha- Couli, or CoQlom-Sba, which fignifies the Kings Slaves, is as Honourable a Title in 'Perjia, as that of Marquefs in 4. Valineamt, which I have Tranfbted Dipributer of Tem poral Goods, is a compound Word. Vali fignifies a and abfolute Lieutenant, who has the fame Power in the place where he is fettFd as he that Rules the Empire. TheTerfians alfo frequently call their King Vali-Iron, to let yee underftand that he is in Perfia, which they call Iron, the true Succeflbr, Vicar, and Lieutenant of Jli, to whom GOD gave the Do minion of the World, after the Death of is deriv'd from Inara, which fignifies a Favour, poral Grace, or (Bountiful conferring So that by the Word Vali-Neamet, which is the moft ufual Title which the Terflans give their King, fpeaking to his Majefty, they mean, That he is CODS Lieutenant in the diflribute be half all the Benefits and Ulefpngs were the Conduit-Pipe, through rvhich ifs Hhfpngs to the Earth. 5. It is in the (Perfian Moubarec-N has been (aid that the Subfcription, wherein are Written the Twelve Names of the Succeflbrs of Mahom is call'd Nijhan, though Moubaree fignifies Blejfed. I faid nothing to the Viceroy when I pay'd my Obeyfance, nor did he fpeak a word to me, or make the leaft fign. With in a Moment after Dinner was ferv'd in, he fent me upon a Plate of Gold the half of a large Loaf that was before him, and order'd his Carver that brought it me, to tell me, that I was welcome. A little after that, he lent to ask me how the War went forward between the 'Turkj and the Polanders. During the Second courfe he caus'd us to be ferv'd with bis own Wine in the Cup that he Drank out of himfelf. The Wine flood in a great Flagon of Gold Enamell'd j and the Cup was fet in the lower part with Rubies and Turquoifes. The Gentleman that fill'd us out the Wine, bid us in the Princes Name, He Merry, and Eat H When* the Third Courfe was upon the Table, the Prince did us yet farther Ho* 1 nour, and fent us part of the Rpafttneat which was fee before + i,:Â»through the Black-Sea^ and t Colchis. 225 his own Perfori that is to fay, a (phtwo Partridges, and a Quarter of a Hind; and order'd our Attendant to tell us, 'That the Wine would make the Wild ; thwh he had commanded that dee fh All which Honours I receiv'd with low bows, but without making any Anfwer. And the Ca did the fame. For it is the Cuftom among the 'Perfians never to return any other kind of Anfwer to thofe kind of Favours. I {hall fay nothing of the Order and Magnificence df the Feaft, but only this, That there was hard Drinking, that there was a moft prodigious Quantity of Meat, and that they brought it up fbrae Fifli, and fome Flefh, in refpect to the Patriarch and the Bifhop who were there, and profefs Abili- nence from Flefh all their Life-time. We rofe from the Ta- after we had fate: three Hours ; at what time others of the Guefts were already withdrawn : though as yet they had not tak'n away the iloaft-Meat. Retiring, we made a low Re verence to the. Prince, who then fent me word once more, That I wasWelcont ; and caUs'd us to be conduced Home to our Lodging. The 14th, the Prince (ent me two large Flagons of Wine, two Pheafants, and two Brace of P'artridges. The Gentle man that brought the Prefent told me, That the Prince had given him Order to enquire, Whethe whether the Capuchins lool^ care and to tell me moreover. That if I every day to his ^Buttery. In anfwer to which, I defir'd the Gentleman to affure the Prince, me want any thing, and that we would in the Wine which he had fent. Nor indeed could better Wine be tafted: So that we were very Merry with a Surgeon, and two Syrians, that fcrv'd the Prince, whom we fent for to Sup with us. The 16th, the Prince fent to invite me to his Niece's Wed ding, who was Marry'd in his 'P I went about Five a Clock with the Superiour and Father ; but the Cere mony of the Marriage was almoft over, before we came. It was perform'd in the Great Room of St te, where we had Din'd the Sunday before. I had a great defire to have feen her, but becaufe the Room was full of Ladies, there was no Admittance for any but the Prince and bis near Pvelations, the Catholicgs and the Bilhops. M m m This226 TheT ray els of Sir John Chardin Perfia, This fame Cuftotn of forbidding Women the Company of Men, has been only in G fince the Country became flibjeS: to the Perfians j nor is this Prohibition but only in the Cities. For in the Country, and in fuch places where there are no Mahometans, they go without Vails, and make no fcru- pie both to come into Company, and diicourfe with Men at their pleafure. But in regard the Culloms of the Mahometans prevail more and more in with their Religion, we find the Women to be more and more reftrain'd of their Liberty : and that lovely Sex are fore'd out of Confor mity to good Manners to keep apart by themfeives. The Nuptial Feaft was kept upon a Terrafs of the fur- founded with Beds of State, or EJhrades rais'd about two Foot, and fix Foot in depth. The Terrafs was cover'd with a large Pavillion fix'd upon five Pillars, two and twenty Foot high, and about fi ve Indies in Diameter. The Lining was of Cloth of Gold and Silver, Velvet and painted Cloath fb neatly and artificially incermix'd, that by the Light of the Tapers it look'cf like a Waiafcot of Flowers and Morefco Work. In midft of this fort of Room of State, if I may fo call it, ftood a large Fountain fpouting out Water. However, we did not feel the Coldnefs of the Weather : For the Crowd of People, and the large moving Hearths that were in the Room, almoft ftew'd us before we got out. The Floor was cover'd with fair Carpets, and about Forty Branches gave Light to the whole Room. Of which the Four that hung next the of Gold, the reft of Silver ; which Branches ufually weigh Forty Pounds apiece, the Foot being a matter of Fifteen Inches in Diame ter. The Branch about a Foot and a half high, carries a Bowl full of pure Tallow, which feeds two lighted Matches. And thefe fort of Lamps give a very great Light. The Figure, or rather PicW inferted, gives yee a difiina Idea of the Order of this Feftivak The Guefts were rank'd upon Beds of State, or Ejirades. The had his Place upon an Eftrade fomewhat higher rais'd then the reft covcr'd with a Canopy in the likenefs of a His Sons and his Brothers were upon his Right Hand 5 the Biflaops upon his Left: The Bridegroom's Place was betwixt both. As for my ielr and the Capuchins, the order'd us to fit immedi ately next,below the Bilhops. For you muft underftand were at this Feaft above a Hundet'd Perfians. The Mufick flood at the lower end. And now in a fliort time after we were all plac d, the Bridegroom enter'd lead by the Who/ fv /'l /' /l n i-C 1 S'! I r- W d s. 1*. ~ f* * * 1 _ f~ 1 1 â€¢ 2.27 through the Black-Sea,, W the Golchisi Who having taken his place, the Princes Relations, went every one to Complement and Prefent him. Which was alio done by the greateft part of the Guefts, infomuch that it look'f like a kind of Proceffion, which was the reafon it lafted above half an Hour. The Prefents confifted in Money, fome Gold, fome Silver, as alfo in little Silver Cups. I confefs I was deli- rous to knovy how much the Prefents amounted to j but as far as I could find, 'twas nofuch great Sum, as not exceeding above Two Hunderd Crowns. However, let it be what it will, in the height of this Cere mony, Supper was ferv'd up in this manner. In the firft place Table Cloaths were fpread before all the Guefts, and in three parts of the Court before the Tent. Which Table Cloaths were as large as the Eftrades. After which done, the Bread was ferv'd in. Of which there were thfee forts, the one ai thin as Paper, the next about a Finger thick, and the thifd fweeten'd with Sugar. The Meat was brought ia cover'd in large Silver Diflies, but far larger then are made in The Plate and the Cover ufually weighing about Four Hundred and Five Hundred Ounces. They that brought up the Difhes firft into the Room, let 'em down in order upon a Table Cloath at the Entrance i from whence other Officers carry'd 'em before the Squire-Carvers,, who cut off feveral hollow Plates full, and order'd 'em to be lent to the Guefts: the Prin ces being firft lerv'd, and afterwards the reft according to theic Degrees: and the cuftom is to Carve one Dilh to all the Com pany ; then of another, and fo of all the reft. The whole Feaft confifted of three Courfes every one containing Sixty of thole large flat Dilhes a piece. The Firfi: was of all forts of fz/o, or Rice boy I'd with Meat, of which they make fe- veral forts of diftinft Colours and Tafts. The Yellow is boyl'd with Sugar, Cinamon and Saffron. The Red, with Juice of Pomegranates, but the White is moft natural and the beft. This &lt;Pilo is a very good fort of Diet, plealmg to the Taft and very wholefome The Second Courfe was of Meats Bak'd, Stew'd, and Fri- cafly'd 5 and other Ragoo's of the lame Nature. The Third of Roafted. Not but that in all the three Courfes there was an Intermixture of Fifli, Eggs, and Salades for the fake of the Ecclefiafticks. For our parts they lerv'd us both the Flefli and 1'ilh. In a Word, every thing was fee upon the Table, and taken away with that order and filence that was to be admir'd. K very one did his Duty without fpeaking a word. So that you Hi all3 2 Â§ The Trduels of Sir John Cliardin into Perlia, fhall hear three French-Men at one Table make more noife then a Hunderd and Fifty Perlons, that were in the Room at that Feaft. But that which Was moft to be wonder'd at after all this ex cellent order 5 was the Court Cupboard which contain'd about a Hunderd and Twenty Veflels, that appertain'd to Drinking i Bov^ls, Cups, Horns, Sixty Flagons and Twelve Jugs. The Jugs were for the moft part Silver. The Bowls and Cups were (bme of Polifh'd Gold, others Gdld Enamell'd, fome fee with pretious Stones, others only Silver ; the Horns were Em- belliili'd after the fame manner as the Richer fort of Cups; and of feveral proportions. The ordinary ones Were about Eight Inches High, Broad at the Top about Two, Very black and Polifh'd. Some were of 'Rhino Snouts, others of Dears Horns, whereas the Common fort were made of the Horns of Oxen and Sheep. However the Cuftom of making ufe of'em for Drinking Cups, and Embelliflling 'em has been all along obferv'd among the Eaftern People. I cannot tell how long the Feall: lafted i for I did not ftay it out. Only this I know, that though it was Midnight before we went away, the Roaft- meat was not then taken off the Table. Nor did they begin to Drink at firft, till the Third Courfe came, that they began to be Warm, and then they Drank their Healths after this man* ner. They fent to Eight Perfons, who were the Prinze's nea- reft Relations, four upon the Right, and four upon the f eft, Eight Bowls of the fame Bignefs and Equally full of Wine. At what time they rofe and flood up till they had Drank i they that were upon the Right Hand Drinking firft: they on the left hand Pledg'd em ; and then the fame Eight Bowls were fill'd again, and carry'd to the next in the fame order till the Health was gone Round. Which done, they began again Eight Bigger Bowls. For the Cuftom of the Country is to Drink the Grandees Health laft in the biggeft Cups. Which is done on purpofe to Fuddle their Guefts the more Effedu- aflly by that means engaging 'em out of Refped: and Efteem for the Perlons to Drink the more Liberally rill they are quite Drunk. In this manner they Drank all the two laft Hours that I ftay'd at the Feaft, and as afterwards I underftood, from - that time till next Morning. The firft Bowls held no more theh an Ordinary Glals: and for thejaft which I (aw Drank off, they held about a Pint and a half. Neverthelefs they were only thofe that were accounted Moderate Draughts.' The Capuchins and my fclf were exempted from Drinking, and in tr nththrough the Black-Sea, and the Count rj of ColchiSc t tmth, had I Dranfe as much as my Neighbours^ I had dy'd upon the Spot: but the Prince had fo much fdndneis for us as to give order not to carry us any Healths; neverthelefs we had both Wine and Water, and a Gold Tumbler ftanding before us all the whiles But they never fill'd us, but when we call'd for it. When the Healths were began, the Mnfick began to Play : being a confus'd mixture of Vocal and Inftrumental, which fo pleas'd the Company, that they feem'd Ravilh'd With it. But for my part I could hear nothing that was Mufical, but rather only what was harfli and full of diicord. The Prince alfo being in a pleafant Humour,as upon whom theLiquor began to work, fent to the Superiour to bid him fend for his Who with his Comrade were no lefs mad at the Extravagant Fancy of the Prince, though the Chief caule of their difguft was my being there, fearing I ihould make fome Relation of the PaP fage to their Difadvantage, and aggravate their fawning Compli ance upon fuch an occafion; that a Superiour of a Million, ihould condefcend to proftitute himfelf like a Fidler before a Mahometan Prince, in and AlJembly of Infidels and Hereticks, Clergy and Laity, that in the Condition they were in, might well be term'd an Aflembly of Drunkards. However when the Spinette came they fet it upon the Table in the midft of the Room, and the Superiour was orderd to Play ; at what time the Prince having order'd him to Sing and Play together, he firft Sung the Magnificat, the Te Vcum, and Taut it m Ergo, and after that feveral Court-Aires in and for the Church Mufick was then too Grave for the Prince Befides the Spinette was out of Tune, and the Superiour play'd out a Tune ^ purpofe, and being very Old befide, and brok'n with Age and Labour, you may Well Judge what fort of Divertilement his Confort could be. However it was Paftime for the Prince for Two Hours together. During which time, the Steward of the Houlhould came to me, and ask'd me whither the ufeof Inftruments were permitted in ourReligion .''To which when I anfwer'd. It was ; he reply'd that Religion forbid it exprefsly; and though it were generally us'd in yet yet that cuftom did not make it Lawful. He told me moreover that Inftruments were particularly forbid in the exercifeof Re ligion, in regard that GOD requir'd only the Praifes of Hu man Voice. During which difpute, a Bifhop fell in to difcourfe with Father (Raphael upon the fame Subjeft. [ cannot tell all that was thenfaid, in regard I did not well un- derftand the Language, nor would the Father be my Inter- N n n preter.230 The Travels of Sir John Chardin Perfia^ preter. Only he told me thus much, that he was offended to fee the Superiour Divertife the Company at a Feftival with the fame Hymns, which he pretended were appointed for the Ser vice of GOD in the Church. Father alfo added, That he took it very ill, that the Viceroy had us'd his Autho rity fo far, to oblige the Superiour to play upon the Lute, and fmg at every turn to pleafe his Humour j only that their Se curity depended fo much upon his Favour, that they durft not deny him any thing. About Midnight therefore, as I told yee, we left 'em i after we had tak'n leave of the Prince with all due Reverence. Neverthelefs before he would let me go, he ask'd me how his Kinfman the King of did, and drank his Health in a Bowl fet with Pretious Stones: and would needs have both the Capuchins and my felf pledge the Health in the fame Cup. Though I know not whether he did it out of Vain-glory, or to honour the Superiour, whom he knew to be a Subjed of his moft Catholick Majefty. The 17th, refleding upon the Title of King of Spain, which the Prince had aflum'd to himfelf, and finding that it was not incoherent with what feveral Authors alledge, that the niard Originally came out of Iberia , I ask'd the How the prince claim'd Affinity with the King of ? They anfwer'd, That Clement the VIII. having written to and in his Letters call'd him Kinfman to the Second, and the Iberians and Spaniards Brothers, his Succeflors ever (ince retain'd that Imaginary Kindred. And upon that occafion they told me feveral Stories of the Pride and Vain-glory of the Georgians, and of the Viceroy in particular, and fliew'd me the Copy of a Letter which he wrote about two Years fince to the King of Poland. Of which I have inferred the Tranfla- tion in this Journal, as being an Authentick Piece, and proper to (hew that the pride of the is not a little Extrava gant, and becaufe the Crowd of Vain-glorious Titles with . which it is ftuff'd, difcovers plainly, that the Eaftern Nati ons beyond all compare furpafs all others in the World in Va nity.

To which the Prince fa- tisfi d with the Complement, and no lefs ready to grant me my requeft, Commanded the Capuchi to tell me, great Kindnefs for the Europeans, wiffd Icon Id haveJiayd longer at Tefflis, to t clear to me what he profefs'd; bu ther had he any deftre to flop me Kings bujinefs^ and therefore tha to go pleasedj that there was all manner ries, and that therefore I needed he would fend one of his Officers The Fathers told me afterwards that he had held 'em in a long difcourfe concerning his earnefl defire that the would come and fettle in Georgia, to which purpofe they had orders to tell me, that if they would come thither for Trade, he would Grant 'em all the Priviledges and Advantages theyr 2 â€”v, â€” - . . . / - - .... through the Black-Sea^ and Colchisi 233 could defire. That his Territories extended to the Blacl^Sea^ and that bearing a great fway in and being highly efteem'd in Turkey,fuch Europeans. as defign'd to the could not chufe a better Road then through his Territories ^ and that he was afTur'd that when they had once travell'd it, they would always make choice of it for the future. I defir'd the Fathers to return my tnoft humble Thanks to the Prince, for the Kindnels Vvhich he had for our Nation; and to let him know, That I would not fail to give to the Edji-India Company Notice of his good Intentions^ which if he would be pleas'd to fignifie in a Letter, I would certainly take care to have it fent. Laftly, That he would do me a great Honour to grant me one of his Domeftick Servants, to . Conduit me to the next Government, of which I (hould not fail to give an Account to the King and his Minifters, when I (hould be arriv'd at Ifpahan. K The 24th, the Tibilelle (for fo is the Bifliop.of Tejjlu call'd, as I have faid already) came to fee me. He told.me. That the Prince had commanded him to acquaint me, That having con- fider'd upon what I had fent to him about Writing to the French Company for fetling a Tradej and a Paffage through Georgia, He was about to have done if, to inform 'em of the Advantage they might make of a Trade into that Country : but in regard he was no more then a Vaffal to the King of fia, he was afraid his Majefty would look upon it as a Crime to have Written (without his Order to Strangers about Bu- finefs. However, I might affure 'em this, That if they would fend Factors info his Country, they fhould find many forts of Merchandizes that were properfor very cheap befides that they Jfhould be receiv'd with all the Civility ima ginable. In anfwer to which I defir'd the Tibilelle to affure the Prince that I would faithfully dilcharge my Truft. The Prelate ftaid with me about a quarter of an Hour in my Cham ber ; and at his departure I prefented him a very fair Rofary of Coral : according to the Cuftom of Repaying the Vifits of a Perfon of Quality. Nor were the left glad of the Vifit I had receiv'd, then of the manner of my Acknowledg ment, in regard the Bifhop of Tefjlis had never been at their Houfc before. The 0.^th, the Prince fent me a Prefent of Wine, artd order'd the Meflenger to tell me. That he had appointed a of his own Family for my Guide j that he had commanded a Let ter of Orders to be difpatchd that I might fet forward asfoon as I pleas'd. ^ O o o The254 The Tray els of Sn John Chardin Perfia, vÂ«i â€” The a^th, Father (Raphaelmade me fpend two Hours with an old Woman that pradis'd Phyfiek by the help of an infi nite Number of Receipts: Of which he caus'd me to write down fome that he had heard People make the greateft Brags of, in my Table-Book. For the Dropfie, R' half a Dram of the Juice of the Roots of Garden-Chiches, and repeat the Remedy every other Day. To ftop a Flux of Urine, Eat for three days together the inner Skins of the Gyfern of a Capon rolled, five every day. Againft the Biting of a Scorpion, Take a Live-Hen, pull the Feathers off the Rump, and lay it upon the Wound. For then the Hen fucks the Poyfon into her Body, and dies. When the Convulfion begins to feize the Hen, take another, and apply her in the fame manner, and fo another till all the Poyfon be fuck'd out. For the Yellow Jaundlfe, Make a Bed of BoyI'd Rice, and lay the Patient well cover'd upon it; or elfe put him into a Bath of Milk, and it works the fame effed. For External Pains of the Joynts, Take either the Deco- ition or the Perfume of three Drams l&gt;f Hellebore. For Inward Pains of what fort foever. Take Potions of Mummy. For all forts of Falls, Bruifes and Hurts, Take Mummy in Drink, wrap up the Patient in a Cows Hide, and let hitti Blopd. The Wound muft be heal'd with the Powder of the Herb Mullein. For Defluxions and Rheumes to the Head and Throat, Take' Perfume of Yellow Amber. For the Dyfentery, Give the Infufion of the Leaves and! Berries of Myrtle j of elfe the Blood of a Rolled Hare infos'd in Wine. For the Hemorrhoids, Powder the Leaves cf (plantain, artd ftrew upon the part affcded. Forthrough the Black-Sea., and t Colchis. 135 For Pains in the Reins, take the Deco&amp;ibn of the Leaves and Seed of Marfli-Mallows. For Ulcers in the Reins, life Milk. Againft a Pleurcfy, take two little thin Cakes of Ordinary Meal, and boil em in Water with Roch-Allum and and apply 'em as hot as may beendur'd upon the fide; the one behind and the other before; this Remedy nluft be dayly re peated till the Cure be perfected. AgainftaCough, make ufi; of the Root of the Herb call'd Hounds-Tongue or Dogs-Tongue. The moft ulual Cute for Agues in this Country, is to make Plaifters of the Fat of aSheeps Rutttp, Cinamon, Cloves and Cardamomes, and all the time of the cold fit to lay rhele Piai- fters upon the Foreheac^ Stomach and Feet. When the hot fit is over, take off thbfe Plaifters and lay on others, made of the Leaves of Ckhory, Plantain, and the Herb call'd Solannm or Nightfliade, afterwards they take a Sucking-Pig, cut it in two and clap it to the Feet All which tfme the Patient is fed with Bread and Cream of Almonds, eating nothing that is boy I'd. Father Q^dphdet aflur'd me that he had feen 'em in that Coun try cure Agues, by carrying the Patient in the height of his Cold fit and plunging him over Head and Ears in the Water. It is a thing hard to be beleiv'd; and in Truth, to me it appear'd a thing altogether Extravagant, in regard it feem'd ro be lo. Dangerous. However it is obferv'd that the difference of Climates and Temperaments of Countrys produces far diffe rent efife&amp;s in Remedies, fo that the Remedy, if I may fo fey, that Kills in one: Country, ddesbut only ftir a Man in aftother.

One of the moft Ordinary Titles which the Qerfians give their King, is Alempenha , or the and Bafes of the World. y.This is the Eleventh Month of the Year. I gave the Chancellor's Secretary a as his Fee foT jDifpatches of this Nature; Though there be no certain Rule for fuch Fees; but only every one gives according to the Ad vantage which he receives by his Difpatch, and according to his Quality and Condition. Prdcntly my Guide gave me tb Underftand, That he wanted a Horfe, which was as much as to fay that he wanted four Gui to buy one. Which I immediately knew to be a Trick to get Advance-Money out of me, fearing left when I came to that I fhould be fb diflioneft as to recompence him only with a Trifle, or per haps give him nothing at all. For the are not vefy prone to make Acknowledgments, and for the they are ingrateful above meafure. The greateft KindnefTes make no Impreflion upon their Minds: for they forget em, and P p p repay3 8 The Trawls of Sir John Chardin Perfia^ repay with flirewd Turns thofe to whom they owe their Ad^ vancement with as little Check of Confcience, as if they were altogether Strangers. For which reaion it is, that they defire payment before-hand, ftanding very little upon the Nicety of a little Impudence, but demanding a Reward for the fmalleft Service which they do. The 28th I fet forth from Tefflis about Eleveri a Clock in the Forenoon ; the folifh Surgeon, and fome with whom I had made an Acquaintance, accompanying me fome part of my way. My Guide rode before to prevent the Toll-gatherers or Receivers of certain final! Duties which are taken upon all Horfes that go loaden out of the City, from demanding any thing of my Servants. Which fort of Guides are call'd Mehemander, (a word which fignifies care of a Guefi:) and are granted to all Envoys, Ambaffa- dors and Strangers of duality. Their Duty is to provide Lodging, Vittlcs, and Carriage-Horfes for the Perlbns whom they Conduct; and in a word, to difcharge 'em from all the care of a Traveller. They are like Stewards or Purveyors for thofe Perlbns to whom they are appointed for Guides. For they make ufe of their Service in every thing, fend 'em upon Errands, and to carry Meflages to thofe Perfons, to whom a Man would not be troubl'd to go himfelf. Thefe Guides are well paid for their Service â€¢,fo that it is a Kindnefs to be re commended to fuch an Imployment. The Villages where they pafs make 'em Prefents, to be the more fparing in what Money they raiie, to defray the Expences of Travellers which they have in charge, and to prevent their being too waftful and lavifh. They take into their prote6tion fuch Merchants as are defirous to Travel along with 'em ; and befides that, they fecure 'em from Robbing, and exempt 'em from paying fe- veral Tolls and Duties. Which is worth em fomething more. But their greateft Gain is the Preient which muft be made 'em when they are lent back. I was very glad to fee my felf got fafe out For I was afraid I fhould there be put to lome kind of trouble for two Reafons. The firft was, For that the Trince having fent to me two or three times to tell me that he had a great defire to fee what I carry'd to the King, I conftantly refus'd to (hew him, alledging for my excufe, that I had Orders from his Majefty not to expofe em to any but himfelf. Moreover, I obferv'd that this Prince is not altogether lb much a Subjeft to the King of feifia, nor lb fubmilfive to his Orders, as the f otherthrough the Black'Seaj and th 0/ CdlchiSi 25^ Other Viceroys and Governourspf his Empire, befides that the Georgians are very perfidious and covetous of other Mens Goods. 1 was therefore fearful left, if I fhould fhew the high-prit'd JevVels which I had, their Beauty and their Value might tempt him to take'em from me, or that other people might Murder me for the Lucre of fuch a Booty, And this was one Confideration that prevented me from (hewing 'ems The Second Caufe of my Diftruft was this, That the pitchins, to do me the more Honour, out of a defign to bring, a greater Reputation to themfelves, had fet me out for a Per- fon that was very Rich and Powerful, fo that there ran a Re port over all the City, that I had immenfe Sum?. Which made the Cuftomer look about me j fo that he demanded great Duties from me. But thofe Duties were not the thing that di- fturb'd me, for by the Kings Patent I was fully difcharg'd. But I was afraid left the Prince Would make ufe of that pretence to view my Goods whether I would or no. And this was that which encreas'd my Fears, and made me infill upon having art Officer to conduft me. For my reafon told me,that filch a Pro- vifion would render the Viceroy more refponfible for any Acci dent that fliould befall me, and that my Guide Would fecure both my Perfon and my Goods. And indeed the greateft part of my Fears were diffipated when I faw my felf quite free of Tefflps j for then I began to conceive good hopes of all the reft of my Journey. That Day I travelfd two Leagues through a Paffage of the little Mountain that lies to the South of the City j and lay at a Great Village call'd or the 'Place of Onions., built upon the River The 1 ft of March, I travell'd Eight Leagues in a fair Plain, where the Road was indifferently ftreight, leading to the North-Eaft. Within three Hours I came to a Village conflfting of about a Hunderd and Fifty Houfes, call'd Cupri-Kient, or the Village of the Bridge. Becaufe there is a very fair Bridge that ftands not far from it, built upon a River call'd This Bridge is plac'd between two Mountains, feperated only by the River, and (upported by Four Arches, unequal both in their Heighth and Breadth. They are built after an Irregular form, in regard of two great Heaps of a Rock that ftand in the Rivei, upon which they have laid (o many Arches. Thole at the two ends are hollow'd on both fides, and ferve to lodge Paffengers 5 wherein they have made to that purpofe little and Por tico's with every one a Chimney. The Arch in the middle of the River is hollow'd quite through from one part to the other,240 T hi Travels of Sir John Ghardin into Perfia^ â–  ^ â€” â–  with two Chambers at the Ends^ and two lafge Balconies co^ ver'd, where they take the cool Air in the Summer with great delight, and to which there is a Defcent of two pair of Stairs hewn out of the Rock. Adjoyning to this fair Bridge there {lands an Inn now ready to go to decay. However the Structure is Magnificent, having feveral Chambers with every one a Balcony that looks out upon the Water. Neither i$ there a fairer Bridge, nor a more- beautiful Inn in all Ccor- 07V. The Second, we Travell d Nine Leagues among Mountains â€¢ very rugged and difficult to crofs. So that We were twelve Hours ere we got to our Journeys end, though we Travell'd at a good rate. About Sun-let we arriv'd at a great Village call'd MelikcKent, or the Royal Village, built upon a point of one of thole High Mountains. The Third, we Travell'd eight Leagues i' the Mountains where we were much perplex'd, and where we did nothing but afcend and defcend. At lenaEh we lav at a Village as bifr as MeliktZenf. &amp; Â§ The Fourth, we Travell'd only three Leaoues: and before Noon we came to a Town that confifted of about Three Hun- derd Houfes, call'd Dily-jati. It is feated upon a Rjver call'd Acaljiapha, at the Foot of a High and Dreadful Mountain, which together with the reft that we pafs'd the preceding days, was a part of Mount T There was every where great plenty of Water, and here and there fome Plains that were but fmall, but very fertile. The Goodnefs of the Soyl thereabout is not to be imagin'd 5 nor the Number of Villages t.iat are to be feen on every fide. There are (everal that ftand fo high-rais'd upon the points of the Rocks, that you can hard ly have a fight of cm. The moft part are inhabited by gian and Armenian Chriftians, but not incermix'd. Thofe Peo ple having fuch an inveterate Antipathy one againft the other, that they cannot live together, nor in the fame Villages. In all thefe Mountains are neither Inns nor publick Houfes â€¢ how ever, Travellers are lodg'd in the Countrymens Houfes very conveniently, where there is plenty both of Meat and Drink, tor my-part I wanted nothing, for my Guide rode ftill be- rnTAni We Tn e ^ 0 r ab0lIt half wa y'' fo when I came J i? I J ftl11 found a lar g e Chamber, empty Stables, a good Fire, and Supper ready. The firft days Journey I woulu have paid my Landlord, but my Guide would not per. ' Â£c n 8 Twas not the Cuftom, and that I fliould ratherthrough the Black-Sea^ and the Colchis, 2.11 rather give Him what I intended the Man of the Houfe. Which was the reafon, that the next Days, I only caus'd iomcching to be given in private to the People where I Lodgd. And indeed 'tis very good Travelling with thefe Guides: for they caufe yee to be diligently attended. All Night long my Cham ber was guarded by the People of the Village who kept Watch, as well in Obedience to the Commands which were laid up on 'em, as for my Security, though there was no danger to be The moft part of the Houfes of thefe Villages are in truth rid more then Caverns: For they are KolloW places made in the Earth. The reft are built of great Beams of Timber up to the Roof, which is made like a Ferrals, and cover'd with Turf. Only they leave a hole open in the middle, to let in tbe Light, and let out the Smoak which hole they ftop up as they pleafe themfelves. Which fort of Caverns have this Con venience, that they are very warm in the Winter, and cool in the Summer : nor is it an eafie thing for Thieves to break in to 'em The Borough of Dily-jan, and all the Country round about for fix Leagues diftance to the North and bouth, and very far to the Eaft and Weft, belongs to ; and is call'd the Country of Cafac. It holds of and depends upon that Kingdom after the fame manner as that is to fay, it is always Govern'd by its own Natural Princes from Father to Son. Jbas the Great fubdu'd it, at the fame time that he Con- quer'd Georgia. The Inhabitants of are Mountaineers^ ftout and fierce : Originally defcended from thofe that inhabit the Mountains to the North&gt;Eaft of the Sea. The Fifth, we Travell'd five Leagues over that dreadful Mountain^ already fpok'n of. There are two Leagues from the Town of Dily -jan, which ftands at the very Foot of the Hill to the Top, another of even Ground to theTop of allj and two Leagues of Defcent again. A tedious Days Journey, which I thought would have kilfd me. For I was troubl'd with a terrible Dyfentery, which forc'd me to alight altoge ther ; and then two Men held me up as I went, and a third lead my Horfe. The Mountain is moft dreadfully laden with Snow, there being nothing elfe to be' feen at the Top, nei* ther Tree nor Plant. The Road alfo lay through a narrow Path of Snow, hard'nd by the Feet of Horfes and Travellers 5 lb that if they did but flip their Feet out of the Path, the CLq q fun I ! I t f r ii /TheTravels of Sir John Chardiri Perfii, lunk up to the Belly in the loofer Snow. Nor is there any pa fling over this Mountain when the Snow falls, or when the WincT blows, for then the print the Feet is loft, and it is impofllble to find the way. Which is the lofs of many People and Beafts every Year. Nor does this Snow ever melt, the Mountain being continually cover'd with it. It feparates Georgia from Armenia and I was no fboner over it, but I found a Country quite of another Form and Fafliion. For whereas on the other fide there was nothing to be feen but very high Mountains, and fome few fmall Plains between 'em, and a Woody Country very well Peopl'd, here on this fide we faw fpacious Plains, with little Hillocks cover'd alike with Snow, bare of all fort of Wood, but what was planted about the Villages. We lodg'd at Kara. a great Bo rough feated at the Foot of the Mountain which we crofs'd over, and upon the Banks of the River Xengui. Which Ri ver waters one part of Armenia the Greater. In making the Geographical Defcription. of the Country as I pafi'd along, I never mind any Author^whether Ancient or Modern, finding em all fo oppofite one to another, and al together dark and confus'd. Which was the fame thing that Strabo laid of the Authors that preceded him ; and whoever will take the pains to compare thofe that have'follow'd him, either with the Ancients or among themfelves, will be of the fame Opinion. As for example in or Ajfyrid, which at prefent they extend almoft to the Sea, though Herodotus, Pliny-, Strabo^ â€¢Ttolomy, and the other moft Cele brated Ancient Geographers enclofe it between the of Arabia and Mefofotamia. I have alfo obferv'd one thing in the Government of Terpa, which has made me fince believe, that although Authors have let different Bounds and Limits to the Countries, yet that they might have all written very true and juftly, and as Things flood in their Times, when the Governments were enlarg'd, or confin'd within narrower Bounds, as the Supreme Gover nor pleafes, or as neceffity requires 5 for then the Province that gives the Name to the Government, has not the fame Limits, nor obferves the fame Situation as before. And therefore I will mark out the Extent and Situation of the Country where f pafs'd, as I found 'em ; and if I muft follow the Ancient Authors, it fhall be only thofe of the Geography. Some there are among 'em who divide into Three parts. The firft which they call properly by that Name, the fecondthrough the Black-Sea, an o/'Colchis. fecond Which they call Turcomannik and the third to which they give the Nariie of Georgia. But the greater Number di vide it only into two parts, the Upper and the Lower. The Lower which is fdmetimes call'd the Lejfer, fometimes the We ft cm, bur generally the Lefler, is tinder thfe Dominion of the Turks. The Upper, which they fometimes call the fometimes the Great, but ufually the Greater; is a Province of Terfia. To thefmali or Lejjer Armenia they affign for Bounds, the Great Armenia to the Â£&lt;*/?, to the South, the Sea to the Weft, Cafpadocia to the North, and they place the Great Armenia between Mefopotamia,Georgia, and Ar menia the Lefs. Which Situation agrees in pirt with that of the Ancient Geographers, who enclole Armenia the Lefs, be tween Ca[&gt;padocia and Euphrates, and the Greater, be tween Euphrates and Tygris. But it no way correfponds with that of fome Authors, as is to be feen, who put Syria, the Shoars of the Mediterranean Sea, and the Banks of the in Armenia, of which they make Edeffa to be the Capital City. Neither do Authors differ lefs about the Denomination of this Country j while fome derive the Name of from Ar- juenins a %hodian, or Thejfatian. Others with far more Rea- fon from Aram, which might have fome Relation to the He brew word Ram which fignifics High or Elevated, either be- caufe the Country lyes High, and for that feveral of the Ea- ftern Mountains make a part of it, or elfe becaufe it fell as his fliare to Aram the Grand-Child of ; who therefore call'd it by his own Name. And therefore Hayton who was King of the Country derives this Name of from But how uncertain foever this Etymology may be, I had rather give credit to it, then to another Story which he reports of Armenia, that is to fay, that it was the Province where najjar planted the Greateft part of the Jews which he took Prifoners in the Conqueft of TThe Holy Scripture, where ere it has occafion to mention it calls Certainly it is one of the mofi: lovely and mofi: Fertile Countries of Afia. It is water'd by Seaven large Rivers, which is the reafon in my opinion that obliges the moft part of the Inter preters of the Old Teftament to place the Terrcftrial Paradife in this Province. However it were, is renown'd for fe veral other Famous Accidents and Events. There is not any other Country wherein were fought fo many Bloody Battels nor with greater Numbers on both fides. It has had particular Kings of its own at feveral times 5 though they could not pre- ferveThe Tray els of Sir John Cliardin Perfia, ferve their Dominion, while as Hiftories aflure us, all the moft Eminent Captains that ever invaded fubdu'd it under their Subjedion in their feveral turns. It was the Theatre of the laft Wars between the Turks and ferfians ; while the Tm ly fought to have had it all entire 5 though at length they were content to (hare it with the Perfian yet not fo but that they have had the greateft part. The 6th, 1 continu'd my Journey, half dead as I was with Cold and a Dyfentery. But the hopes I was in to meet at E- rivan with all neceffary Aecommo Jations for my Cure, made me haften thither, notwithftanding all the Pains that I felt. So that we Travell'd Four Leagues and arriv'd at a confide- rable Village feated at the Foot of a Mountain upon the River Zengui. We lodg'd at a fair Monaftery built be tween the Village and the Mountain. This Monaftery is an Ancient Foundation between Eight and Nine Hunderd Years ftanding. The Cloifter is built after the Fafhion of the Coun try, encompafs'd with High and Thick Walls of Free Stone. Near to the Monaftery are to be feen the R nines of Towers, Caftles, and Ramparts in fo great a Number, that it renders very probable what the People of the Country report, that 'Bichni has been one of the ftrong Places of I lodg'd in the Convent, where the Monks receiv'd me with great Ci vility, and put me into the faireft Apartiment they had, only I could by no means prevaile with 'em to let me have a Fowl to make a little Broth, becaule it was their time of Lent. So that my Guide was fore'd to ufe his Authority, even to the holding up his Cane to procure me a few Eggs. Toward the Evening I had a defire to Drink fome Coffee, which my Guide brought me boyl'd with a little Sugar; and of that I Drank Four fmall Glafles as hot as I could , which done, I lay'd me down well cover'd before a good Fire. To which feeble Re medy it pleas'd GOD to give fo great a Blefling, that I flept without Interruption all that Night, and the next Morning found my felf wholly cur'd of this Diftemper. The 7th, I fet forward by break of Day, after I had made a fmall Prefent to the Monaftery. All that day we travelfd over Plains all cover'd with Snow as the day before. And indeed it is not only troublefome but very dangerous to travel through thofe deep Snows. The Mifchief is 'that the Beams of the Sun which lye all the day long upon it, moleft the Eyes and Face with fuch a fcorching Heat, as verv much weak ns the Sight, whatever Remedy a Man can apply j by + wearingthrough the Blacli-Sea, and th Colchis. 245 wear ; o the People of the Country do, a thin Handkerchief of Green or Black Silk, which no way abates the Annoyance; Then another Danger there is, that when Travellers meetj there arifes a Difpute, who fliall be forc'd into the Snow. For the Road is fo narrow that two Horfes cannot go abreafl:: fo that if equal Parties meet,they fall to blows for the way,and the weakell ' 'e is forc'd to yield. Then they unlade their Horfes, an^ d^'ve 'em into the Snow, where they fink up to the Bel lies to give paflage to the others. But my Guide conftrain'd all that we met to unlade, which was to me a very great Eafe. Thus v afsd through many Villages and Towns, and Night coming we arriv'd at Eri^w. 'Tis a - -J matter to defcribe the trite Road from Te'flk td this City, in regard of the many Turnings and Windings, and rhe frequent Occafions to afcend and defcend the greateft part of the v Only ! oblerv'd that we fiill kept on to the SoutI From Tefflis to Erivan it is reck'ned to be about Eight and turty Leagues. Erivan is a great City, but ill-favour'd and dirty; and of which the Vineyards and Gardens make the greateft part, there being no Ornamental Buildings within it. It is feated in a Plain encompafs'd with Mountains on every fide. Two Rivers run by if, Zengui to the North-Weft, and lal^to the South-Weft. Which Queurk-boulak fignifies Forty Fountains; the River being faid to rife from fo many Springs; nor does it run a long courfe. But we fliall fay no more of the City, nor of its Figure, the Draught being fufficient to give an Idea of it. The Fortrefs it felf may pafs for a fmall City. It is of an Oval Form, being about Four Thoufand Paces in Compafs, and containing Eight Hunderd Houfes, inhabited only by Na tural (petfians. 'Tis true, the: A have Shops therein, where they Work and Trade all the Day long ; but in the Evening they fnut up their Shops, and return Home to their Houfes. This Fortrefs is furrounded with three Walls of Earth, or Bricks made of Clay with Battlements, flank'd with Towers, and ftrengthen'd with very narrow Ramparts, according to the Ancient Manner, and therefore without any Regularity, after the Eaftern Falluon. And indeed it had been a hard matter to have made a Regular Fortification in a place that would not admit of it, in regard the Fortrefs extends it felf to the North-Eafi upon the fide of a dreadful Precipice, broad and fteep, abo -ve a Hundecd Fathom to the bottom,where the River R f f tuns*ThTray eh of Sir John Chardin Perfia, runs. And therefore this fide being impregnable and inacceA fible, has no other Fortifications then I erraffes furnifli'd with Artillery. However, a Garifon of no lefs then Two Thou- land Men is always kept in pay for the Guard of thisFortrefs; which has as many Gates as Walls, all plated with Iron, and ftrcngthen'd with Port-Cullices and Courts of Guard fortify'd. The Governor of the Provinces Palace being within the Ca* file, (lands upon the Brink of the Precipice already men- tion'd i and is very fair, very fpacious, and very delightful in Summer. Near to the Fortrefs, about a Thoufand Paces diftant up on the North-fide, ftands a Hillock which Commands it, the upper part being fortify'd with a double Wall, and planted with great Guns, and capable to lodge Two Hunderd Men. This little Fort is call'd Queutjhy-cala. The City ftands about Cannon-Shot diftance from the Fpr- treis j but the fpace between is fill'd up with Houfes and Mar- ket-Places; but fuch pitiful thin Structures, that they may be all remov'd away in one day. There are (everal Churches in this City ; of which the prin cipal are the Epifcopal See, call'd or Two and Catovike. Which two Churches have ftood ever fince the Raign of the two lafl: Kings of The others were Erefted fince j and are fmall, funk deep in the Earth, and not unlike fo many Cata-Combs, or Burying-places. Near the Epifcopal See ftands an old Tower built of Free- Stone, of which you fee the Draught in the Sculpture. I ne ver could learn when it was Erefted, nor by whom, nor for what ufe Yet there are Infcriptions on the outfide, of which the Chara&amp;er refembles the Armen the could not read it. The Workmanfhip of this Tower is all of An tique-Work, and lingular for its Architefture, as may appear by the Figure. The infide is all empty and naked: but on the outfide and round about it feveral Ruines lb difpos'd, as if formerly there had been fome Cloyfter there, and that this Tower had ftood in the midft of if. Before it appears a great Market-Place, and not far from it an old Moique built of Brick, but very much decay'd. They call it T)euf-Sultans Molque, from the Name of the Founder. Three Hunderd Paces diftant is to be ieen the Maydan-, which is the Name in Afia for all the Grand Market -Places, This in Erivan is four-fquare. Four Hunderd Paces in Dia meter, and planted round with Trees; being the place ap-through the Black-Sea., and Colchis. pointed for all manner of Exercifes both for Horfe and Poor, as Camt/eU^ Racing, VVreftling, and Managing of Horfo for War. There are ittany Baths in the City and in the Fortref?, and many Inns: of which the faireft ftinds about Five Hiindcrd Paces from the CafUe, built by the Governor of Armenia fome few Years ago. The Portal is Eighty Paces in depth, and forms a fair Gallery, full of Shops, where are Ibid all manner of Stuffs. The Body of the Strudure is fquare, containing three great Lodgings, and Sixty fmall ones, with fair Stables, and very large Warehoufes. Before it lies a Market place fur- rounded with Shops, where are to be fold all forts of Provi- fion for the Belly i and upon one fide a fair Mofque and two Coffee-Houfes. The Elevation of Brivan is in 40 Deg. i 5 Mia. The Lon gitude in 78 Deg. 20 Min. The Air is good but a little thick and cold: and the Winter lafts long , fo that fometimes it will Snow in April. Which conftrains the Country-People to bury their Vines in the Winter, and never to dig 'em up again till the Spring. The Country is delightful and very fertil. The Earth produces her Fruits in great Plenty, efpeciÂ» ally Wine, which is very good and cheap. The alfo have a Tradition, That Noah planted a Vineyard near to Erivatiy and fome there are who pretend to know the Place, and fhew it about a fmall League from the City. The SoyI produces all forts of Provifion, which is therefore fold at a ve ry low rate. The two Rivers that run by the fide of it, and the Lake of which we dial I take an occafion to fpeak, ftirnifh the City with Excellent FiOi, and among the reft with Trouts jand Carps that are wonderfully good, and famous all over the Eaft i of which I have feen fome that have been rhree Foot long : And then for Fowl, no place in the World where Par tridges are more plentiful. The Lake of Erivan lies three fmall days Journeys off to the North-Weft; by thecall'd Dciia -Shiri /i, or the Sweet- Lake i by the Armenians, Kiagar-co which fignifies the fame thing: and the rcafon why it is fo call'd is from the ex traordinary fweetnels of the Water. It is Five and Twenty Leagues in Circuit, and very deep i affording nine forts of Fifli which are there tak'n j the faireft Trouts and Carps which are eaten at Erivan^ being caught in this Lake, There is a fmall Ifland in the middle of it 5 where ftands a Monaftery built about 600 Years ago, of which the Prior is an Arch' bidiop,The T navels of Sir John Ghardin Perfia, bifliop, who takes upon him the Title of Patriarch, refufing to acknowledge the Grand 'Patriarch. Our Maps take no Cog nizance of this Lake j a wonderful thing tome, that among all our Travellers into Perfia, not one fhould make any men tion of it. By which defeft it may be judg'd that thofe Au thors were little curious after the Rarities of the Countries through which they pals'd. The River takes its fource from this Lake, and crofling one part of meets with the River Jraxes near the Cafpian Sea, into which at length they both difcharge themfelves Erivan, by the report of the is the mo ft Anci ent inhabited place in the World. For they affirm that and all his Family dwelt there, both before the Deluge, and after he defcended from the Mountain where the Ark refted; and that here was alfo the Terreftrial Paradife. But all this is a Story without Foundation, and reported by Perfons equally ignorant and vain-glorious. Some Authors there are who af firm Erivan to be the City which calls and makes to be the Capital City of Others hold it to be the Royal Jrtaxate The Hiftory of calls it Erit%e : but that of Armenia, which is to be feen in the famous Monaftery of the Three Churches, aflerts, That this City was formerly-call'd Vagar-Shapat, which fignifics ('word for word) Vagar-s City. But that which renders thefe Pieces of Anti quity very much fufpeded, is, That the fame Hiftory, fpeak- ing of the Etymology of Erivan, derives it from an word which fignifies To fee ; and fays farther, that that fame Name was giv'n to this City, becaufe the Territory belonging to-it was the firfl; Place that Noah difcover'd when he defcend ed from the Mountain of Ararat. And yet it is well known that the Armenian is a Modern Language, that has not been in life above thefe Seven Himderd Years. Nor do we find any thing in the Hiftory concerning the Original of Nekhet do I believe it to have been built before the Conquefts of the Arabs in Armenia-, and that which makes me believe it is this, for that neither in the Oity, nor in any parts adjoymn^ round about it, there are any Footfteps of great Antiquity to be feen. The Tar/y became Mafters of it in the Year 1582. and built the Fortrefs ftill to be feen. The retook it in the Year 1 604. and fortify'd it againft the Violence of Can- non-Shot. In the Year 16115. it held out a Siege of four Months 5 at what time the Rampart withftood the Batteries of the Tur\ with that Impregnable Refiftance, though but of + &gt; Earth,through the BJack-Sea, and of Colchfe, ^ . Earth, chat the Befiegers were forcM to raife their Siege. Af ter the Death of Abcis the Great, they return'd and carry d the Place, but were not long Mafters of it. For Sophy retook it in the Year 1635 , fince which time it has never been be- lieg'd, ~ Two Leagues fern Erivah (lands that famous Monaftery of the Three ChHrches , the Sanduary of the Armenian Chriftiaiis, if I may prefume fo to call it 5 and the place to which they pay their greateft Devotion. I have caus'd a Draught to be inade of it at large^ and have added a Geometrical Ground- Plot , and a fmall Sketch of the outfidc of the Principal Churchy to give a more diftinil Defcription of the Monaftery.^ and more eafie for Apprehenfioii. The Armenians call it Ecs~ Mtax&gt;in, or the Defcent of the duly begotten So)?, or the Only be* gotten Son is defcended. Which Nanle, fay they, was given to this Place, heczuk Jefas Chri/i fliew'd himfelf vifibly in this place to Sc Gregory, who was the firft Patriarch of it. The Mahometans call it ZJtfh-Clifpe, or thtThree Churches ; for that befides the Church belonging to the Convent, there are two others adjoyning to it. The firft ^nd the principal 5 call'd Ecs-Mia%in, is ^ very fubftanrial and dark Scructure, all built of large Free-Stone. The Pilafters^ which are Seventy two Foot high, are mifliapen Piles of Stone ^ as are alio the Duomo, and the Roofs. On the innei-fide are to be feeri no Ornaments either of Sculpture or Painting. Tlie Chappels ftand upon the Eaft-fide j befides three at the lowrer end of the Chiirch. Of which the middlemoft is very fpacioiis, vvith an Altar of Stone after the manner of the Eaftern Chriftians very well adorn'd. But there is not any Altar in thofe upon the Sides, only one ferves for a Veftry, and the other for a Treafury. Irl the Ve- ftry the Mdnks that belong to the Place (hew yee (everai Pieces of Church-Furniture^ very beaiitiful and rich, as Crofles^ Gold Chalices, Lamps and Candlefticks of Silver of an extra ordinary bignefs. The chiefeft part of which Wealth was the Munificence of Papal Liberality ^ and Tefiimonies of (Rome's Credulity, as well as of Armenian Diflimulation. There are. alfo to be feen in the Tre^fury, feveral Shrines of Silver and Vermillion Gilt. The principal Relicks belonging to the Place, by the report of the Moiiks that have'em in keeping, are the upper part of the Body of St. an Ann and a Thigh of St. Caiana an Arm of St. Or gory, Sirnattvd the lllnminator, bccaufe he Converted Armenia \ a Rib of St. James B'i(hop of JcntfaUm j a Finger of St. feter, and two Fingers of St. phri S f f theT he'Travels of Sir John Char din into Perfia, the 'Baptifi. Whofe Body, as of this Monaftery affirm, lies in a Church belonging to a Convent of their Order near to Er%erum : That Leontius, Bifliop of gave it to their firft (Patriarch, and that after it had Jain Three Hun- derd and Fifty Years at Echs-Miaxin, it was Tranflated to the place where they fay it now lies. But the of Echs* Mia%in, who are the great Dolors of the are fo ignorant by their own Confeffion in my hearing , that they never heard of thofe Hiftories which relate how that the Body of Sr. John the 'Baptiji was burnt to A(hes by the Command of Julian the Apoftate. I omit to fay. any thing of thole other Relicks which they pretend to have in their Treafury, as be ing the Relicks of Saints very little known to this part of the World. I fliall only therefore add this farther, That the Monks belonging to the Convent affirm for a great Truth, That once they had the two Nails that fafteifd the Sacred Hands of JESUS CHRIST to the Croft, which are ftill preferv'd, the one at Diar-Beh^e , the other in ; and that the Great took out of their Treafury the true Lance, and the Seamlefs Garment, to enrkh the Treafury of the Kings of Terfia at Ifpahan. In the middle of the Church Hands a large Iquare Free- Stone, being three Foot in Diameter, and five Foot thick. The Armenians alfure us, as an Article of their Faith, That this was the place where St Gregory their Apoftle law CHRIST one Sunday in the Evening, while he was at his Prayers, and where he fpake to him. They farther afcertaio us. That SUS CHRIST drew round about this Saint with a Beam of Light, the Defign of the Church of Echs-Mia^in, and order'd him to build it according to the Model which he had there drawn. They add, That at the fame time the Earth open'df in that part where the Stone lies, and that CHRIST caft down to Hell through that Hole, all the Devils that were in the Temples of Armenia, and utter d falfe Oracles, and that Saint Gregory caus'd the Hole to be cover'd with Marble. They add. That Ahas the Great carry'd away the Marble, and put it into the Royal Treafury of and caus'd this Scone to be let up in the Room of it. Concerning which I made a dili gent Inquiry at Ifpahan, nay I askd the Superintendents of the Treafury themfelves; but! could not find that They under- ftood any thing of it. Amenian Tradition tells yee alfo of another particular in reference to the Center of this Church, which I lhall fet down, though as fabulous as the reft, That ^â€¢ thisthrough the Bkck'Seaj and th of Colchis, s 5 i this was the trtie plate, where Kaah built that Altar, and of- fer'd that Sacrifice^ which is meation'd in the Eighth Chapter of Genefis. The Great Steeple has befcn : newly rebuilt^ containing Six Bells, the biggeftof which weighs taoo Weight. One of the fmaller Bells fell down about Forty Years fince, and was never hung up again, for want of Money, 4s the Armenians fay: and indeed it is certain that they are very Poor. ThS' firft Monaftery of this Church was built by the T'#en- &gt; ty Ninth Patriarch of Armt\iia, This the Jdtttfr rUiti'd; and if we may believe the Chronology of the Pk^, it has beetl Five times levell d with the GroundÂ» It ii at ptfefifit built of Brick 5 the Patriarchs Apartiment lying to the Eafh There are befides in the Convent Lodgings fdt all fttangfefs thai:, coin â‚¬ to Vifit it, and for 80 Monks belidej but ufilally thiJi-d are hot above Twelve or fifteen. And here it is that lhe Patriarchs of Armenia are oblig'd to refide. Bliti to fay Truth, the AVa* rice, Envy and Ambition with \Vhich they are p^flefs'd iri ihis Age, finds 'em fo much bufinefs, that they fpend all thfeir Hme in Rambling oVÂ£t (pei-fta and This Patliireh Has Twenty Bifhopricks under him.

Which City they call Ardajhat, from Ar- taxerxes, whom the Eafterns call Ardeflnr. Among the Ruines of which, as they fay, are alio td be feen the Ruines of the Palace of Tyridates, built about 1300 Years ago. They fay moreovef, that there is the Front of a Palace which is not above half Ruin'd, where there ftill remain four Rows of Columns of Black Marble, every one of Nine Columns, that thefe Columns encompafs a great Heap of wrought Pieces of Marble^ and that the Columns are of that bignefs, that Three Men can hardly enfold 'era in their Arms. They call the whole place, where this heap of Ruines lies, or the Throne of Tyridates. I fliall forbear to (peak of the other Monafieries, or of the particular Stories which the recount concerning 'em, or of the Relicks that are there pre- (erv'd j among which they number up the or the Napkin which a Woman of that Name brought to wipe the Sweat from Chrift's Face : the Bodies of St. and St: Simon, which isall meer Idle and ridiculous Fable: for in truth the Armenian Tradition has nothing of common Sence. Nor fliall I fpeak any thing of the Belief or Worfhip ; for it is well known what they are, as having been for feveral Ages wrapt up in the Opinions of the Monophyfites, who in the Eaft are call'd Jacobites, of which at this day they underftand nothing at all, being altogether drown'd in Ig norance. Twelve Leagues from Erivan to the Eaft, is to be feen the Famous Mountain, where almoft all Men agree that the Ark of Noah refted ; though no Body can bring any Solid Proof to make out what they affirm. When the Air is Serene, this Mountain is not to be (een at more then the diftance of two Leagues, as High and as Great as it is; and therefore I aai apt to believe I have feen far higher; and if I am not deceiv'd, that part of Caucafm which I crofs'd over, as I Travell'd from the f Blach c Sea to Akahikg, is higher then this Mountain The Turkf call it Agridag t the High or Maflie Mountain ^ but the Armenians andPerftans call it both by the fame Name MafiS. VVhich word the Armenians derive from Mas or the Son of Aram, who, as they fay, gave to their Nation both its Original and Denomination. The derive it from A%iSya VVord which in their Language fignifies or Dearly-'Bdoved 5 and they will have this Mountain to be lo call'djthrough the Black-Sea, and t Colchis. 253 call'd, by reafon of the choice that GOD made of it to bear, the happy Ark that inclos'd all Mankind. Thefe are forc'd Etymologies as much as any can be, and fuch as we may well compare to the meer Tinkling of Bells. This Mountain is call'd by two other Names in the Books : that is to fay, Cou-nough, or the Mountain of and or the Happy Hillock. But the Holy Scripture gives it no particular Name, only it fays, That the refted upon Mountain o/' Ararat, which is Armenia. Thefe are thofe Moun tains fo famous in the Greeks and Latin Authors, which they slFert to be part of Mount Taurus,and call by the Names of Gordian, Cordean, Cordueman, Card , , and every Author altering the word according to the Pronunciati on of his own Language. The Armenians have a Tradition, That the Ark is ftill upon the Point, or higheft: Top of this Mount Mack. They add moreover, That never any Body could afcend to the Place where it refted ; and this they firmly believe upon the Faith of a Miracle, which they fay, happen'd to a certain Monk of Echs-Mia%in, whofe Name was afterwards Bifliop of Nifibis. They report, That this Monk, poflHs'd with the common Opinion that this was the Mountain where the Ark refted after the Deluge, refolv'd to afcend to the Top, or die in the Attempt; that he got up half way, but could never go any farther ; for that after he had clamber'd all the Day long, he was in his Sleep miraculoufly carry'd back to the place from whence he fet forward in the Morning. This continu'd a long time ; but that at length GOD giving Ear to the Monk's Prayers, was willing to fatisfie his Defires in fome meafure: to which purpofe he fent an Angel to him with a piece of the Ark, with Orders to bid him not toyl himfelf any more in vain, for that he had debarr'd from Mortals accefs to the Top of that Mountain. And this is the Tale which they tell; up on which I (hall obferve two things. Firft, That it has no Coherence with the Relations of Ancient Authors, as Jofephm, Berofus, or Nicholas of Damafcm, who allure us that the Re mainders of the Ark were to be feen, and that the People took the Pitch with which it was befmear'd as an Antidote againft feveral Diftempers. The fecond, 1 hat whereas it is tak n for a Miracle, That no Body can get up to the Top, I (hould rather take it for a greater Miracle, that any Mm (hould climb up fo high. For the Mountain is altogether uninhabited, and from the Half-way to the Top of all, perpetually cover'd with T t t Snott j, | gjfi</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100023512011.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>ORW.1986.b.10</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023512011.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: Printed Collections</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>ORW.1986.b.10</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'The travels of Sir John Chardin into Persia and the East Indies, through the Black Sea, and the country of Colchis.
