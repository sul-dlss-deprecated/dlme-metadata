The correspondence discusses developments in the conflict between Abdul Aziz ibn Abdulrahman ibn Faisal Al Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd (Ibn Saud)] and the ruler of the Emirate of Jabal Shammar, Mut-ab Ibn Abdul Aziz [Mit‘ab bin ‘Abd al-‘Azīz]. The murder of Mut-ab by his uncle Sultan is reported in the file on folio 54 and a detailed account of the killing is contained on folio 103. The subsequent murder of Sultan is also reported in the file on folios 230-232.Throughout the file, the correspondence discusses the rise in power of Ibn Saud (and the relative decline of the Rashidi tribal dynasty) and Ibn Saud's desire - often expressed through Shaikh Mubārak Āl Ṣabāḥ, the ruler of Kuwait - to form a closer relationship with the British Government.On folios 145-191, the file contains a detailed report written by the British Political Agent in Kuwait, Stuart George Knox concerning a trip he made to the village of Anta'a in February 1908.The file contains an English translation of a pamphlet produced by Suleiman Bassam, a prominent merchant in Mecca said to be a strong supporter of the Rashidis and an opponent of Ibn Saud. The pamphlet contains a history of the Rashidi tribal dynasty and information about the Emirate of Jabal Shammar.The file also contains copies of correspondence sent between the Ottoman Governor (Vali) of Basrah and Shaikh Mubārak as well as a report written by William Henry Irvine Shakespear, Knox's successor as Political Agent in Kuwait, after he had met Ibn Saud in Kuwait in February 1910.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001c4#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001c4#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001c4#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
