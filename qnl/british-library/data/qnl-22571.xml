It was adopted and has been in force since then. I enclose herewith eight copies of the note signed by me. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Adviser to the Government.© 1 A BAHREIN ROYALTY AOCOWTIHG PROCSDURE IN COHNECTION VYITH HANDLING ARABIAN CRUDE OIL R2CEIYED AT ZELLAQ, The Bahrein Petroleum Company 9 Limited 9 has arranged to purchase crude oil produced in Arabia from the California Arabian Standard Oil Gompanyo The installations and arrangements for the handling of this oil and the royalty accounting procedure to be followed during the time it is so handled are outlined below: - lo The crude oil is to be transported by barges from A1 Khobar 0 Saudi Arabia^ to Zellaq^ Bahreinp and discharged into four crude oil measuring tanks now at Zellaqo The oil will be run from these tanks by pipe line to a Juncture with the Bahrein gathering system at Gathering Station Noo at which point it will be comingled with the stream of oil being pumped from the Bahrein field to royalty measuring tanks NoSo 152 and 153« So In order to avoid any 'slack' and to permit any necessary subsequent ohecking D the pipe line from the Zellaq tanks to the Juncture mentioned above and from such Juncture to tanks NoSo 15S and 153 will be filled with Bahrein crude oil before any Arabian oil is run from the Zellaq tankso For record purposes 9 certified tank gauges will be taken of royalty measuring tanks NoSo 152 and 153 and of all refinery crude oil storage tanks 9 and the quantities of all unfinished stocks in refinery tanks ascertained and certified by a Bahrein Government representative,, prior to the receipt of the first Arabian crude oilo 3o The measurement of each delivery of Arabian crude oil out of the Zellaq measuring tanks will be witnessed by a Bahrein Government representative and recorded on a delivery ticket certified by the State Engineero 4. The amount of Bahrein crude oil run from field storage on which the gross royalty payable to the Sheikh of Bahrein will be calculated will be detezmined by certified runs of the comingled crude oil from royalty measuring tanks Noso 152 and 153 9 with a deduction of the exact amount of Arabian crude oil measured and run from the Zellaq tankso 5o Since the measured quantity of Arabian crude oil deliver ed out of Zellao tanks will enter into the calculations only in connection with runs from royalty measuring tanks Noso 152 and 153 v all crude oil at any time remaining in the Company 9 s field storage and pipe lines f including the line from the Zellaq tanks to the Juncture with the Bahrein gathering system, will be regarded as Bahrein oilo* (p) / Pa^e 2. q 6. The Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltdo f may deduct from the gross quantity of orude oil run from field storage the quantity of oil used In Its operations other than the oil used In oonneotlon with the refining of imported oil. The Bahrein and Arabian orude oils are very similar In oharaoter and under any given refinery treatment the quantity of oil used as fuel will vary directly with the quantity of orude oil being treated. Hence it may be assumed that the total oil so used will ^ be made up of Bahrein and Arabian oils in proportions baaed upon the respective quantities of each handled 0 This is also true with respect to oil used in trans porting the comingled crude oil and the products there- fromo Therefore the fbllowing principles will govern deductions in the Bahrein royalty accounts for oil used in operations: - a) A record will be kept and certified of all oil used directly or indirectly in the refining of the comingled orude oil and in transporting and handling such oil and its products within the Sheifch's territories. A deduction will be made of the total quantity of oil so used except the proportion thereof used in connection with the refining of Arabian oil, such proportion to be ii; determined by the ratio which the total quantity of Arabian orude oil measured and run at Zellnq bears to total runs from royalty measuring tanks Noso 152 and 153. b) Oil used as fuel in handling Arabian crude oil at Zellaq and in transporting the same from Zellaq m t0 the Juncture with the Bahrein gathering system will not be deductible. c) Oil used in operations not in any way connected v/ith the refining of Arabian crude oil, such as oil used directly and solely in connection with the production, handling and transportation of Bahrein crude oil itself, will be deductible in full as heretofore.

His Britannic Majesty's Political A^ent, Manama, Bahrein Island, ✓ Dear Sir, ROYALTY ACCOUNTING IN RELATION TO ARABIAN CRUDE OIL. ——— . Would you kindly refer to our letter No. PA-420 &gt; I of September 17th, 1938, with which were forwarded copies of a memorandum outlining the procedure to be followed in the importation of Arabian crude oil received at Zellaq and the principles to be adopted insofar as the importa tion and refining of such oil might affect royalty account ing in respect to Bahrein crude oil. We have been advised that in the near future the California Arabian Standard Oil Company villi complete their new oil terminal at Ras Tanura. Thereafter, in addition to the_Zellaq deliveries described in our letter No. PA-420, deliveries of Arabian crude may also be made to us by tanker and received at Sitra terminal. It is the purpose of this letter to outline the manner in which this oil so received will be handled and taken into ac count so far as Bahrein royalty problems are concerned.Measurement: • One of the large tanks at Sitra terminal, pro bably No. 903, will be reserved exclusively for Arabian crude oil. One of the 12' submarine lines from the Sitra pump-house to the wharf will also be devoted to the hand ling of Arabian crude except on occasions when it may be necessary to use the line for the shipment of fuel oil as explained more fully below. Before each receipt of Arabian crude oil, the pipe line from the ship making the delivery to tank No. 903 will be properly isolated by blinds or seals, or both, and the outlet of the receiving tank closed and sealed. A low gauge will be taken in the tank before discharging, and a high gauge at the completion of dis charging, Thus the exact amount of oil delivered on each occasion -will be measured and converted to volume at 60 o F. in the usual way. Occasionally it will be necessary to use the 12' line ordinarily devoted to Arabian crude oil for the shipment of fuel oil. Following such use, the fuel oil left in the line will be displaced by Arabian crude oil from tank No. 903, except that in order safely to avoid contamination of the fuel oil system with crude oil it- 3 - will be necessary to stop the line wash short of a com plete displacement. This may leave up to 500 barrels oil of fuel/in the .pipe line. The inclusion of a minor amount of fuel oil in the pipe line will not affect the accuracy of the volumetric measurement of the amount of Arabian crude oil delivered in the succeeding shipment. The gravity of the oil in the tank, however, will be slightly affec ted and on such occasions the ship^ cargo will be sam pled in order to ascertain the exact gravity of the oil received for the purpose of converting the corrected volume of the delivery to tons. Calculations in Bahrein Royalty Accounting;:- After shipments of Arabian crude oil are re ceived and measured, the oil will be pumped from tank No,903 to Refinery crude feed tanks Nos, 131 and 132, where it mil ,be commingled with oil being delivered from royalty measuring tanks Nos. 152 and 153, The principles of determining the amounts of Bahrein oil used in the Company's operations and deduc tible in the royalty account, will be identical with those outlined in the memorandum forwarded with our letter No. PA-420, except that Arabian crude oil re ceived at Sitra will have to be taken into account.- 4 - These principles, accordingly modified, are repeated below: (a) record vdll be kept and certified of all oil used directly or indirectly in the re fining of commingled Bahrein and Arabian crude oil and in the transporting and hand ling of such commingled crude oil and its products within the Sheikh T s territories, A deduction will be made of the total quanti ty of oil so used except the proportion there- of used in connection with the handling and refining of Arabian oil. Such proportion shall be determined by the ratio which the sum of the total quantity of Arabian crude oil i.ieasured and run at Zellaq plus the to tal quantity of Arabian crude oil delivered into Sitra tank No, 903 bears to the sum of the total runs from the royalty measuring tanks Nos, 152 and 153 plus the said deli veries into Sitra tank No. 903, (b) Oil used as fuel in handling Arabian crude oil at Zellaq and Sitra and in transporting the same from Zellaq to the juncture with the Bahrein gathering system and from Sitra to tanks 131 and 132 will not be deductible, (c) Oil usedin operations not in any way con nected with the refining of Arabian crude oil, such as oil used directly and solely in connection with the production, handling and transportation of Bahrein crude itself, will be deductible in full as heretofore, ^ For the convenience of those concerned, we are sending with this letter illustrative charts of the faci lities which are being and will be used for the reception and handling ol Arabian crude oil. These charts are re ferred to as Nos. BR-628-1 and BR-696, Would you be so kind as to convey copies of- 5 - these charts and the information contained in this letter to the Bahrein Government and let us know at your convenience whether any further infomiation is desired or whether they are now in a position for mally to signify their approval of the procedures out lined here and in our previous communication referred to above.

Dear Sir, The S.S. 'El Segundo 11 which has been transporting crude oil from Ras Tanura to Sitrah Terminal has been ordered to go for a complete survey on or before December 1st. During the time the 'El Segundo' is out of service we will resume crude oil shipments from Khobar to Zellaq by using the tug 'Arab' and one barge. Since one barge will be insufficient to meet the demands of crude required, from time to time we will place in service the S.S. 'Ketty Brovig' or equivalent, to take occasional cargoes from Ras Tanura to Sitrah. The transport ation of crude will start from Khobar to Sellaq about November 1st. The present plan is to have the n El Segundo' out of service for about three months. We would appreciate it i^ you could have Mr. Furber take gauges at Zellak under similar conditions that were in force previously. The accountii^ procedure will follow that laid down in our letter No.PA-200 of March 21st which was subsequently approved by you in your letter No.C/292-10/l of May 3, 1939. Mr. Furber will also have to do some gauging at Sitrah. (v • V^ The Company realize that it is an inconvenience for the Bahrein Government to gauge at Zellak and Sitrah and during the time that the barge is in service, we are willing to pay extra for this service. Will you please advise what you consider a fair compensation for the additional work that your gangers will be put to. All port clearances will be handled as in the past through the Director of Customs. Thank you for your kind cooperation. MHL:LA. Yours very truly. cc: C.D. Belgrave Esq., MWT. New York. WK. New York.

PCM:B■ — 'Translation of a letter dated 16th DEil Hejiah 1356 (26.1.40) from the imler of ^atar to the Assistant iolitical Agent, Brn. I have received your letter No. 40-1940 dated 22i]d January 1940 and noted your remarks about the launch which was carrying the cases mentioned by you and the other boats which you say have been driven by the storm to Buwais in the coast of '^atar. I immediately sent a car with some men on my behalf to investigate the matter and tox take the necessary action, ihe following is what has come to my knowledge:- On the morning of the day of the storm the people of Ttuwais saw a launch drifting uncontrolably near the diore of Fuwais. It was driven by the strong current and the wind to dangerous places therefore, in spite of the storm, they hastened to its rescue and reached it while about to hit the rocks and break down. They did their best until they were able to turn it away from the direction of danger and towed it to a safe place, flhen they brought the launch on shore they saw in its hold the cases mentioned by you, one of which was broken and its contents scattered. The ^mir of the village ordered that the cases be taken to house for safe keeping until he reports the matter to Ai me. I understand that some of the employees oi the Bahrain Oil Go. have been there and have negotiated with the iimir about the matter but he was unable to do anything before reporting the matter to me. The persons whom I have sent there have tound 110 cases with the 4mir and 5 cases he gave to the men who came to him from the Bahrain Oil ^o. and one case was broken and they did not find anything in it. ihe cases ana the launch have been taken possession of and I will make the necessary arrangement to send them and the launcn to you. lou realize that these poor people have done their oest on a stormy day until they were able to rescue the launch 1 rom breaking on the rocks and that they deserve to be given the fees usually given xxixx for such matters and which are customery and accepted by all. You may also be aware that those who «alve sunken goods or things driven by the wind receive, according to custom, have of the goods which were Salve., i therefore request you to After compliments,deal equitably with these poor people by giving them what they deserve for their labours and for exposing their lives to death on that stormy and bitterly cold day. I am sure that you will arrange to make the Company pay their dues in the light of the extent of the stonn and the condition of these poor people as compared to that of the Jompany. I understand that the steam launch and the two small boats have been rescued somewhere else than iiuwais.

The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited has requested me to ask you if you would be agreeable to Dr. R. A. Kennedy taking over the duties of Chief Local Representative on my leaving until some other arrangement can be made. At the same time the Company feels that under the present circumstances where men are liable to leave Bahrein at any time for war service, it v/ould be advisable for a Deputy Chief Local Representative to be appointed so that another employee would be familiar with the duties of the post and ready to act as relief, maintaining a continuity of contact and ideas. For the Deputy position the Company has requested me to submit the name of Mr. Arthur Ayto who will be taking over the majority of my purely Company duties and v/hose familiarity with personnel matters would be of assistance to Dr. Kennedy in the meantime. It would be arjpreciated if you could inform me at an early date as to whether those proposed are acceptable to you in order that duties may be turned over before my departure Yours truly, Chief Loc THE 3AHREI entative )LEWi COMPANY, LTD.c\ Telegram 'Q' Political Agent, Bahrain.

Attention of Capt. J.B. Howes Dear Sir, I attaoh hereto a draft of the answer we propose be made to the questionnaire put forward by Wing Commander W. F. Langdon of the Air Liinistry through Mr. Ballantyne. Do not hesitate to call upon us for any further information, or for assistance, that we can furnish. Forwarded through:1. Yes with our Dubbs thermal naphtha reformer at 750 pounds and 1040 Fahrenheit from either or both Bahrein or Arabia crude we can produce aviation fuel approximating DTD-230 except requiring 5^ to 6 CC lead per Imperial Gallon. (STOP) This is straight reformed unblended naphtha having unleaded octane about 73 or slightly better. (STOP) We can now produce 50,000 to 60,000 barrels of 42 U .S .G-allons per month of this product. (STOP) By addition of maximum Polymer stock this quantity could be increased by about 7000 barrels per month which would increase unleaded octane of blend to 76 or oetter but account poor susceptibility quantity of lead per gallon to meet DTD-E30 would remain approximately same. (STOP) Potential gum by Atlantic method copper dish 2 milligrams. (STOP) Sulfur point 05. (STOP) Prefer not make doctor sweet account impracticability segregating stocks to avoid slight contamination. (STOP) 2. Present rate stated above will require about two weeks test runs and minor changes. (STOP) No further increase in production possible with present basic refinery plants. (STOP) 3. Production 100 octane impossible with present plants. 4. Increasing production DTD-230 would require completely new crude unit and reforming unit and tankage and other facilities which probably could be ready for operation within one year. (STOP) To produce 100 octane by alkylation would require new equipment which would require same period and could produce about 9000 barrels per month in addition to DTD-230 as aoove. (STOP) 5. All foregoing production figures based upon contiiuing to run one million barrels crude per average month. (STOP) Any increase either DTD-230 or 100 octane can be figured in same proportion as foregoing. (STOP) 6. Suggest Air Ministry discuss with Anglo Iranian refinery men London who are quite familiar our situation as Production plan outlined above is only one of several possible methods. (STOP) 7. Would like to know approximate size cargoes likely to be lifted so can study method handling. (STOP)(w) - E - 8. V/e have enough TEL on hand to produce 50,000 barrels DTD-230 and we maintain normal stock of 12 million cubic centimeters. (STOP) 9. All foregoing assumes first consideration given to production aviation gasoline but from practical viewpoint must recognize this would unbalance remaining production which might require some arrangement for moving to enable continuous refinery throughput. (STOP) Anglo Iranian Cozen or Spearing can explain this or see my report to Jones Air Ministry on which you assisted two years ago. (STOP) 10. Give assurance every assistance possible from us. (STOP) 11. Also point out to all concerned that this refinery has all tanks full to safe capacity and serious likelihood shutting down next few days account delays in ships to lift products.
