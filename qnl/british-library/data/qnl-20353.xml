The Under Secretary for Poreign Affairs (Wakll al Kharijla), the Head of the finance Department (Wakil al Mai fa) and the Vice President of the Legislative Assembly (Wakll ash-Shfiri). The President of the Council of Ministers in the absence of H.M. the King becomes ex officio Viceroy of H.M, (Haib al 'Am), but when H # M. is present he will be President of the Council of Ministers only. The Presidency of the Council at the present time directs the Viceroy's Office (Hyabat al Amma) and the Ministries of Interior {Wazarat ad-Dakhilla) and foreign Affairs (Wazarat al Kharij£a) and the War Departments (al ! Askarfa) # The Council cf Ministers shall have a general office (dlwan) which will be under the charge of a chief responsible for the administration of its affairs. This office shallissue instructions to the Ministries (Wakalat) and Departments (Idarat), whether emanating from the Council of Ministers or from the President thereof either in his capacity as President or in his capacity as Viceroy of H.M. during the latter 1 s absence. The Council of Ministers derives its authority from H,M. the King; the Ministers (Wukalaa) are jointly responsibleresponsible to H,M # the King for the general policy of the country, and each of them is responsible also for the affairs of his Ministry (Wuzara), cle 6, The decisions of the Council of Ministers will be taken in accordance with the opinion of the majority.

The Colleagues responsible must produce such an explanation on request; in the event of a refusal to produce an explanation,and when difficulty is experienced in bringing about agreement between the party asking for it and the party responsible, the matter should be referred to H.M, the King so that the party asking for the explanation may be freed from responsibility # Article 9 #Ss &amp; The President of the Council is the channel thagt which Royal Orders are issued to the Government Departments (Dawair) and Ministries (Wukalat), and he is the authority to whom those Departments (Dawair) should address themselves in their official dealings. Should any Minister (Wakll) or other Head of a Department or any subordinate happen to think of a new matter,which may be beneficial or which may serve to avoid an abuse, Y /hen such a matter is not provided for in the regulations of the Government nor laid down in the relevant arrangements, he should submit it in writing to the President of the Council for the latter to consider it, add his observations thereto and refer it, together with the observations, to E.M,the King for his gracious command as to what should be done in the matter. If the President of the Council should direct one of the Ministers (Wukalaa) to execute an order which is not provided for in the regulations laid down, nor issued as a decision of the Council, or issued as a decision of the Council but has been disputed or opposed by the Minister (Wakll) responsible for its execution, then the opposing Minister (Wakll) must execute the order immediately provided that it is communicated in writing and supported by a Royal Command the number and date of which must be mentioned. If the Royal Command supporting it is not mentioned the matter should be referred to H.M. the King, The Council is to meet nightly when the majority of the members are present at one place. It must in any case meet once a week during the day time or at night for dealing with all questions submitted to it, which questions are to be prepared and classified by the Dlwan, Article 15 .article 13 # In the event of one of tlie Ministers (Wukalaa) 'being absent when any matter arises requiring his presence in that it concerns his Department (Daira), the matter should not 'be postponed; the necessary decisions should 'be taken in respect of it and communicated to the Ministers (Wukal&amp;a) including the absent one, according to the usual practice. If the absent Minister has anything to say against the decision taken in his absence, he should immediately submit his views to the President and to his Colleagues so that they may defer execution of the decision pending consultation and meeting. If the absent Minister has nothing against the decision, it must be carried out; if he has not opposed the decision within twenty four hours after learning of it, his silence will be interpreted as approval unless he has some legal (sic? legitimate) excuse for delaying his opposition. Otherwise the decision will come into force. rticle 14.

CONFIDENTIAL. E 1010/640/25] Section 1. February 23, 1932. vf jfo r~ ^ Dili- WmimMu 1 ! 'IT Memorandum by Sir A. Ryan on the Situation in Hejaz-Nejd as it affects- His Majesty's Government. (A.)— Position as regards various Questions of Interest to His Majesty's Government. 1. Transjordan Frontier Question. —This has temporarily been reduced to the proportions of a nuisance, but one which causes infinite trouble all round. It tends to envenom all our relations with Ibn Saud, and might again produce a dangerous situation if he decided to countenance raiding on an important scale from Hejaz-Nejd, or went further and decided to have a fling at Transjordan as a definite means of escape from his troubles. We must suffer the nuisance, unless we are prepared for drastic remedies, like driving the Amir Abdullah and Ibn Saud into direct relations and letting them settle their tribal differences between them; and/or attempting a readjustment of frontiers so as to give the Wadi Sirhan to Transjordan (or perhaps neutralise it) and clear up once for all the question of Akaba and Maan. The difficulties in the way of any remedies so^ radical are notorious. 2. Persian Gulf Questions. —Our main objective is to induce Ibn Saud to remove the embargo on trade between Nejd and Koweit. I do not know whether Colonel Biscoe made any headway with this during his recent interviews with Ibn Saud. The proposal to exercise pressure by increasing transit dues at Bahrein appears to be in abeyance. 3. Arabian Air Route. —We have reduced our demands on Ibn Saud to a minimum, viz., facilities for the landing of service aircraft at suitable emergency landing grounds. The question of similar facilities for civil aircraft remains in the background. Fuad Hamza's reaction to my latest representations in January was very sticky, but Colonel Biscoe seems to have obtained more satisfactory results from his conversations with Ibn Saud and Yussuf Yasin. I have no- details as to what he asked for or as to how far he got any firm undertaking. 4. Shell Benzine. —No redress has been given for the outrageous raiding of stocks last autumn. The Hejazi Government have defaulted on the contract made with the Director-General of Finance in order to patch up the affair. My representations in January have produced no effect, the proposals made to Gellatley, Hankey and Co. having been of an entirely unsatisfactory nature. 5. Other Money Matters. —All efforts to get the settlement of the Govern ment of India claim on to a satisfactory basis have failed. It is presumably not of primary importance to obtain payment. As for the Eastern Telegraph Company cable account, the sums involved are not large, but the habitual failure- of the Hejazi Government to make proper monthly settlements is a constant source of trouble. They have of late been keeping the arrears down to some extent by paying doles on account. The situation would become really serious only if Imperial Communications lost patience to the extent of refusing to work the cable. Minor money matters, like the failure of the Hejazi Government to^ pay British and British-protected chauffeurs, are tiresome, but hardly of major importance. 6. Pilgrimage. —The maladministration of the pilgrimage gives rise to many complaints on the part of Indian and other Moslems. They are often apt to be exaggerated, but the fact remains that, apart from his one great achieve ment of making the pilgrim routes secure, Ibn Saud has done little to effect any permanent improvement in pilgrimage conditions, and tends more and more to exploit or tolerate the exploitation of pilgrims. If a good opportunity offered, it might be worth while to attempt an agreement under certain main headings to secure the temporal interests of pilgrims. [381 z—1J2 7. Slavery.—It is impossible to verify the claim made by Fuad Hamza on behalf of Ibn Saud that he has taken serious steps to prevent slave traffic m accordance with the obligation accepted by him in the Treaty of Jedda, an obligation which he has firmly refused to repeat in his treaties with France and Italy. He is wholly recalcitrant regarding the maintenance of slavery m his dominions. He resents the continued exercise by the British Legation of the right of manumission preserved by way of modus vivendi in the letters annexed to the Treaty of Jedda. Frequent efforts are made to obstruct the repatriation of slaves manumitted by the Legation. The question has been brought to a head by the case of the slave Bakhit, whom Ibn Saud claimed as his property, though not as a member of his household or army, and to whose manumission he objected on the strength of an alleged oral agreement with Sir G. Clayton qualifying the letters attached to the Treaty of Jedda. 8. Deportation of British Subjects and Protected Persons .—Although His Majesty's Government do not question the right of the Hejazi Government to deport British subjects, &amp;c., without stating reasons, the arbitrary conduct of the Hejazi Government in the matter is a cause of not infrequent hardship. 9. Akaha and Maan.- —The question of the juridical status of this area is in abeyance. There is no urgent reason for reopening it on our side, unless it is found essential to thrash out the subject of the de facto boundary south of the Jebel Tubeik, or unless serious inconvenience results from claims by Ibn Saud to regard tribesmen from the disputed area as his subjects. The question should not, however, be disregarded in any estimate of our general position vis-a-vis of Ibn Saud. 10. Hejaz Railway. —This question is also in abeyance, and the reasons for leaving it so are even more cogent than in the case of Akaba Maan, owing to the sensitiveness of Moslem opinion, inflamed by the illusory idea that the railway is a Wakf. Otherwise it would probably be in the interest of all concerned if the former proposal to recondition the railway as a whole, without reference to claims to Moslem ownership of it, could be made practical politics. 11. Naval Visits. —Greater freedom in the matter of visits to Hejazi and Asiri ports, other than Jedda, is desirable, but not, in my opinion, essential for any practical purpose. 12. Treatment of Foreign Representatives in Jedda. —No complaints are made regarding any lack of personal courtesy towards foreign representatives. Their official position is, however, impaired in three distinct ways, viz., by the continued failure of the Hejazi Government to produce a Ministry for Foreign Affairs worthy of the name, by the denial of access to any place except Jedda and the jealousy with which the Hejazi Government regard intervention on behalf of foreign subjects, especially Moslems. The last of these points is a matter of considerable practical importance, as is shown, inter alia, by the line taken by the Hejazi Government over the matter of the Shell benzine. The foregoing list is a general summary of the more important specific matters requiring consideration in any general estimate of the position of His Majesty's Government vis-a-vis of Ibn Saud. It reveals a generally unsatisfac tory position, but not (apart from the repercussion of the Bakhit affair) an acute one, except in so far as the settlement of the questions at 1 to 4 inclusive, and perhaps the Eastern Telegraph Company question at 5, may be regarded as urgent. I have prepared the summary while travelling and largely from memory. I do not think I have omitted anything of first-class importance, but the list would need revision, if required for more than the present purpose of a general review. It might be expanded in various directions, e.g., it does not deal with matters like the state of the port at J edda and the vexatious character of certain customs regulations. (B.)— Position of Ibn Saud. Ibn baud is almost certainly on the down grade. He has perhaps not reached the limit of ambition and may, therefore, be tempted into dangerous enterprises, but he has reached the limit of what he can achieve without embroiling himself with His Majesty s Government or else trying conclusions with the Imam of the Yemen. People used to ask whether his system could survive his disappearance from the scene. It is now a question whether he can maintain it during his own lifetime. He is still physically robust and there is no reason why he should not last another twenty years or so, though it may be true that he tends towardsimpotence and finds it disconcerting; and it is now certain that he suffers from dyspeptic troubles. The reasons for the deterioration in his political position are manifold, but may be summed up as follows :—&gt; {a) He has made a complete mess of the Administration of the Hejaz, his tenure of which goes back only six or seven years. The population has no guts, but discontent with his regime is widespread. (5) He indisposes extreme Wahabi opinion by his modernising tendencies, although there are no certain signs that his position in Nejd and its Dependencies, based on personal ascendency and reinforced by his suppression of the 1929 revolt, is seriously impaired. {c) He isolates himself in the Arab world by his individualism, his hostility to the Hashimites and his dislike of any manifestations of Arab nationalism {e.g., the Arab alliance project) not tending towards his own domination. {d) He antagonises large sections of Moslem opinion by his religious intoler ance, fundamentally that of a Wahabi, though with a difference, as manifested, e.g., in the desecration of shrines. (e) He unfits himself for a real place in the family of nations by his intract ability, his excessive jealousy of his independence and his dislike of any form of foreign penetration. His attitude regarding slavery affords a test of his remoteness from a world in which all civilised Moslem Powers and most enlightened Moslem opinion agree that slavery is an outworn institution. I say only ' a test,' because no one, except Great Britain to some extent and potentially the League of Nations, if Ibn Saud sought membership, minds very much about slavery as it exists in Arabia. {f) He has no advisers fit to help him in organising a modern State. He clings to Abdullah Suleiman, a glorified office boy, but the only Nejdi in high position in his Central Government; deplorable as a Finance Minister from any European point of view, but excellent as a grand extortioner and evader of liabilities. Fuad Hamza is clever and modern-minded, but not experienced or strong enough to create order out of chaos and himself too mad on the idea of independence to take large views. The other Syrian, Yussuf Yasin, is a useful secretary but fundamentally a fanatic. Hafiz Wahba, a sensible but easy-going man, is out of the picture and hates the Syrians. These and perhaps a few other non-Nejdis are genuinely devoted to Ibn Saud's cause; most of the minor Syrians and other alien odds and ends are in his service for what they can make out of it. He has scrapped the one man, also a Syrian, personally ambitious but useful, who seemed likely to make a moderate success of the embryo regular army on European lines. {g) At the back of all, just now, is financial stringency operating on a small scale, but fatally, because Ibn Saud and Abdullah Suleiman between them have destroyed what little credit the country might have had; because the Hejaz has no serious resources other than the diminishing pilgrimage; and because the Hejaz has to carry a great part of the burden of Nejd. The Government as such is unquestionably bankrupt. There is no means of verifying or disproving the belief held in some quarters that Ibn Saud has collected a substantial reserve for his own purpose at Riadh. (C.)—Position of His Majesty's Government. It is a common superstition in the East that Ibn Saud subsists by the favour of His Majesty's Government. As a present-day proposition this is absurd, but it is true that Great Britain is the only Power that really counts in Arabia. Ibn Saud's greatest achievements in the international sphere have been the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda on equal terms and the establishment of normal diplomatic relations. It is a question of major policy whether we should follow one or three broad courses, viz. :— (a) To give positive support to Ibn Saud, on the ground that he is, in spite of everything, an element of stability, about the best example of his type and reasonably well disposed, so long as he is not crossed;■ (b) To let the present situation evolve on its own lines, maintaining a generally friendly attitude towards Ibn Saud without really helping him, and recognising that we can hope for no real satisfaction in regard to matters like those enumerated in part (A) of this memorandum; {c) To stiffen our attitude all along the line, at the risk of definitely antagonising Ibn Saud, and, perhaps, promoting his downfall or perhaps driving him into mad adventures. Alternative (a) is ruled out by the fact that we cannot help Ibn Saud in the only way that would be really useful to him, i.e., by financing him in one way or another; and because we cannot back him against other Arab rulers. There is much to be said for alternative (b); because the problem of Ibn Saud, though important, is but a small factor in the present world situation; and, unless he seeks further aggrandisement at our expense or at the expense of our special interests in Arabia, it matters very little whether he survives or collapses; but in this alternative we must be prepared to tolerate the Transjordan nuisance and to go easy with everything else, including the questions of Koweit and the Arabian air route, unless Colonel Biscoe has already got them on to a definitely better basis. There is something but perhaps not so much to be said for alternative (c). If Ibn Saud's bluff is to be called, now is as good a time as . any other to call it. He is weak and our grievances against him are solid. We could make out a case for rigidity good enough to appeal even to many Moslems, though many others would rally to his support on the general principle of defending any Moslem cause against any European Power.

(P'N [E 1467/44/34] tion 2. § Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—{Received March 23.) No. 128. Confidential.) i r) Tehran, March 9, 1932. I HAVE the honour to report that the police authorities of Tehran have recently arrested a number of Persians, apparently on suspicion of being concerned in a plot of a revolutionary nature. Ever since the arrival of the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs in Tehran last January, I have received reports of arrests made and] heard many rumours as to their true cause. Shortly before the arrival of Tevfik Ilu§tu Bey, indeed, I observed that the police officers stationed in the streets of Tehran were armed with rifles; enquiries elicited the unconvincing explanation that they were issued in order to show extra respect to the important visitor. 2. I believe that about forty persons in all are under arrest. A good many of them are minor employees of various Ministries, such as the Ministry of Post« and Telegraphs, of National Economics, of Justice, and of Foreign Affairs. A few Armenians are also among those arrested; a fact which no doubt gave rise to the least plausible of the many stories circulating in explanation; namely, that the cause of the arrests was a plot by Armenians to murder Tevfik Eu§tu Bey. One of the secretaries of the Prime Minister has also been arrested. 3. Another rumour explains the arrests as being due to the discovery of an elaborate spying organisation in the pay of the Minister of Court; this rumour is probably traceable to some of the many Persians who are envious of the great man's success and would not be sorry to see him share the fate of Firuz Mirza and others. Yet another story connects the arrests with a plot to establish a republic, and leaflets advocating this form of government are said to have been distributed from an aeroplane. The most probable story appears to be one which connects the arrests with a Bolshevik plot for the overthrow of the present regime. The Persian press has denied that anyone has been arrested at all; a statement which no one believes. 4. Two other developments during the past two months are worth mentioning, and may be related to the foregoing facts. One is that a considerable number of the principal personages belonging to the important tribes in the south r such as the Qashqais, and the Khamseh Arabs, have been summoned to Tehran, where they are either in prison or under surveillance and obliged to remain in Tehran. One of the chief men of the Persian Kurds has 1 also been summoned to the capital. The second development is the expulsion from Tehran of certain preachers who presumed to speak critically from their pulpits of recent enact ments of the Majlis, especially the new law concerning marriage. 5. One of the most trusted agents of the Qavam, who is the titular head of the Khamseh tribes, has had the unpleasant experience of being incarcerated for four days in a dark cell without being told exactly what his offence was. He was shown on many occasions a document purporting to have been written by him, containing treasonable matter. It appears to have been established that the writing was a forgery, and he was then released. 6. These proceedings are to some extent covered by elastic police regulations, though, theoretically, an arrested person has to receive a formal trial. It is not likely, however, that irregularities will even be the subject of a protest. I reported in my despatch No. 734 of the 30th December last the execution of the Jew Haim at night after five years in prison; this outrage seems to have caused no outward disturbances. 7. The general impression I retain from these events is a feeling that the Shah's mind is not at rest. This disquiet affects all sections of the Administra- [416 z—2] | |w*tion. A contributory factor is the personality of the present chief of police, a new broom who is trying to sweep very hard (' clean ' would be inappropriate). It -seems paradoxical, but is, I am assured, nevertheless true that the general effect of these arbitrary arrests is excellent, in the sense that Persians, on the whole, feel that they are really being governed by the strong hand of a ruler who will stand no nonsense. Whether any hidden store of popular resentment is at the same time being engendered remains to be seen I have, &amp;c. U. H.

FEISAL.A (3.) Commendatore Sollazzo to the Emir Feisal. {Translation.) Your Royal Highness, Jedda, February 10, 1932. I HAVE the honour to assure your Royal Highness that the second para graph of article 6 of the Treaty of Friendship between Italy and the Hejaz, Nejd and Dependencies is intended solely for the purpose of determining the procedure to be followed in the handing over of the property of Italian pilgrims deceased in the Hejaz. This will take effect without prejudice to the procedure relating to the estates of deceased persons who were not pilgrims, which will be accorded the reciprocal treatment that is the basis of the usual practice between independent States. I have, &amp;c. GUIDO SOLLAZZO. (4.) The Emir Feisal to Commendatore Sollazzo. (Translation.) Sir, Jedda, February 10, 1932. IN reply to your note of to-day's date regarding the estates of our subjects who die in your territories and those of your subjects who die in our territories, I desire to assure you that the procedure in regard to them will, as you have stated, be on the basis of reciprocity in conformity with international usage. His Majesty's Government will therefore arrange to take charge of the estates of your subjects who die in our territories and, after the legal procedure has been completed and the relative taxes collected, to hand them over, in the absence of a legal administrator of the deceased in our country, to the Italian repre sentative at Jedda. The Government of His Majesty the King of Italy will reciprocally under take to take charge of the estates of our subjects deceased in Italian territory and, after the completion of the legal procedure and the collection of the relative taxes, to hand them over, in the absence of a legal administrator of the deceased in your country, to the competent representative of the Hejaz for that territory or, failing such a representative, to His Majesty's Government. I have, &amp;c. FEISAL. (5.) Commendatore Sollazzo to the Emir Feisal. {Translation.) Your Royal Highness, Jedda, February 10, 1932. IN the course of the negotiations which have happily concluded in the Treaty of Friendship between His Majesty the King of Italy and His Majesty the King of the Hejaz, Nejd and Dependencies, I had the honour to explain the point of view of the Government of His Majesty the King of Italy in regard to the traffic in, and the manumission of, slaves, which is as follows ; — 1. The Government of His Majesty the King of Italy, in virtue of the high principles which inspire their action in the struggle against slavery, consider it necessary that the Government of His Majesty the King of the Hejaz, Nejd and Dependencies should assume the obligation of co-operating with thern,^ employing all the means at their disposal, in suppressing the slave trade. Such &lt;;o-operation is destined to strengthen that spirit of mutual assistance and collaboration between the two Governments which animates and guides the joint •and determined action of all civilised nations against slavery. • Similarly, the Government of His Majesty the King of Italy desire that tneir representatives at Jedda may be assigned the power to manumit and repatriate any slave who spontaneously applies to them. I desire to assure your Royal Highness that the exercise of such a power by our representatives shouldnot be at all considered as an interference in the affairs of your country, but as a means whereby the co-operation of the two Governments in regard to the problem of slavery can be more actively and closely carried out. I trust that His Majesty the King of the Hejaz, Nejd and Dependencies, will appreciate this attitude on the part of the Government of His Majesty the King of Italy and the reasons which induce them to maintain their point of view in this matter. I have, &amp;c. GUIDO SOLLAZZO. (6.) The Emir Feisal to Commendatore Sollazzo. (Translation.) Sir, Jedda, February 10, 1932. I HAVE considered your note of this day's date regarding slavery. The Government of His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd and Dependencies, while appreciating the humane sentiments which have induced the Government of His Majesty the King of Italy to make the request contained in the note under reference, desire to make the following explanatory statement on this subject:— 1. The suppression of the illicit trade in slaves constitutes one of the most important questions to which our Government have directed their attention. His Majesty my Sovereign, from the day on which he ascended the Throne of the' Hejaz, has displayed particular interest to the end that the entry of slaves into his territory should be prevented; it may, in fact, be said that for several years no person has been able to import slaves into this country. The Government will spontaneously persevere in this line of action. 2. As regards the paragraph numbered (2) in your note, His Majesty's Government are using on their own initiative their endeavours within the country to reach the end which is enjoined by our Islamic law with its principles of supreme justice and its pure sentiment of humanity. The reason for which our Government abstain from granting the power requested in the paragraph numbered (2) of your note is that such action in our territories is a sole and exclusive right of our Government. I have, &amp;c. FEISAL.1 No.1609/4/39. aj/j BRITISH LEGATION, JSDDA, May 30th, 1932.

THE Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, London, and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the under-mentioned document. 2. Copy is being sent to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla, and His Majesty's Minister, Jedda. Bushire, June 29, 1932. Enclosure in No. 1. Political Agent, Bahrein, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. (Confidential.) Sir, Bahrein, June 26, 1932. I HAVE, the honour to say that matters have apparently come to a head between Ibn Saud and the powerful Qusaibi family. In a conversation with the adviser before a third person, Abdulla Qusaibi, who is notoriously hot-headed, stated all the brothers had combined and signed a letter to Ibn Saud saying that they would not supply him with any goods on credit unless he made some arrange ment for settling their outstanding debts, which amount to some 17 lakhs of rupees. Abdulla Qusaibi expressed himself with unusual heat, and stated that they had even given an ultimatum to their Royal master to the effect that, if their demands were not met, they would remove their families from Nejd to Bahrein and apply to be registered as Bahrein subjects. 2. I have little doubt that the situation is perfectly correctly described. Abdul Aziz went to Jedda with the thinly-veiled intention of extracting some money from Ibn Saud, and it is obvious from other information I have received that he has completely failed. I have also noticed that the usual shipments on behalf of His Majesty were not being made by the Qusaibis, but were being made by other firms, and news has been received of a consignment of 17,000 bags of rice due to be shipped shortly through Bahrein to the mainland under arrangements to Haji Abdulla Zainal, the brother of Muhammad Ali Zainal, who was formerly Kaimakam of Jedda. This consignment is to be paid for in instalments, though it is very doubtful that they will be any more successful in extracting payment than the all-powerful Qusaibis have found themselves to be. 3. The Qusaibis are undoubtedly pledged to the hilt with Ibn Saud and can ill afford to break with him, for any repudiation or delay in settling his debt of 17 lakhs, coming on top of the sum they have lost in the insolvency of Habib Rosenthal, may have a disastrous effect on them, and render it difficult for them to pay the instalments due to pearl dealers in Bahrein. However foolish Abdulla may be, Abdul Aziz, the senior partner and creator of the firm, has great intelligence, and I do not doubt that he will find some means of bringing Ibn Saud to terms, even though it may take time, though his task will be facilitated when the firms who are taking their place discover the difficulty in obtaining payment from their august client.

A report received from the authorities in Transjeraan at the end of last month stated that 400 Hejazis drawn f^om various tribes hut with the Billi element preponderating, had crossed from Sinai into the Hejaz via Akaha with the announced intention of raising a revolt in the name of the Sherifian family against the Government of 'Itin Saud. 490. This party which consists of Hejazi trihes- -man who migrated into Egypt and Lower -falestine since 1927, is at present under the leadership of Hamid ibn Arfada (Eafadah) of the Billi trihe. They are well supplied with money in the form of Egyptian notes ( the origin of which is open to cofasiderahle speculxation) hut although their number has now in- -creased to some 700, appear douhtful as to their subsequent reception and in no hurry to push further south into the -^ejaz. They are at present located some 40 miles south of Akaha. On 23th May His ttighness the Amir Ahdulla of iransjordan issued a proclamation disassociating himself with the movement, while in the Eejaz, 'Ihn Saud who doubtless considers the influx of anybody with ready money a hopeful sign, has been in communi- -cation with the Amir of Dhada and ordered him to keep in close touch with any further movement of the self styled rebel party.

It is known that the first objective is Dhaba, but as yet the rebels have made no combined movement and fought no actions . This long period of inactivity is not likelyto improve their ohances of success. 541. Ibn Saud has few troops in Norhtern -n-ejaz and the small garrison at Tabuk (Sq.f.iv) Dhaba (Sg.g.iii) and Wejh (Sg.g.iv) are mutinous. In add- -ition there is a serious shortage of supplies and ammunition in these places. The King however has chosen Dhaba for his advance base^ and on the 10th June re-inforced it to the extent of twenty armed cars carrying troops, about eithy five rifles and jsaxs one thousand rounds of ammunition. A boatload of food- -stuffs was also landed. 542, Fortunately no Transjordan tribes have join- -ed the rebel force and steps have now been taken by the Transjordan Government to prevent if necessary, the 3eni Attiyeh ( who migrated from Hejaz in March} returning at this critical time.

(g) I am very glad to 'be a'ble to 'begin this letter by congratulating you most warmly on your y /ell deserved honour. a great personal pleasure to me to know that the 'fount' has played on a man like yourself with* whom I join hands across to thank you for yours of : v _ y 20 promising me a regular supply of Dickson's reports. These are most interesting to read here. You will have heard of my adventures since February. It took nearly two months to dispose of the sequel to the affair of the slave Bakhit and then I was kept hanging on in England to lend a hand with the Hejazi mission. I did not get hack to Jedda until May 3CU All the clouds had rolled by and courtesy reigned supreme, but I tumbled into a new crisis of sorts, resulting from the invasion of the Hejaz by a rebel band from Sinai under a Hejazi exile named Ibn Rifada. You will see an account of this in the next Jedda Report. which I have only just seen announced in the Times# It is I have long owed Your ut.Col.Sir H.V.Biscoe, K.B.E.BRITISH LEGATION, JEDDA, HEJAZ Your visit to I'bn Sa'ud in January certainly seems to have been a great success. I saw some of the papers at home and have recently heen studying others. I am afraid that I share the auspicion of the Sheykh of Kuwait about the prospect of a settlement of the blockade question by discussion between commissioners but it seems worth trying, if it can be reduced to a practical proposition. I still await instructions as to the next move. The question of landing grounds was advanced a stage in conversations with the mission in London. It seems now to be largely a question of hon) much are prepared to pay to get what they want. I await news from the Foreign Office on that subject also# I am sometimes a little disturbed at the extent to which Ibn Sa'ud and the Sheykh of Kuwait now swwm to treat with each other direct. I suspect the former of pursuing a deliberate policy of ignoring our special position, but if you are satisfied that there is no danger in that direction, it seems a practical way of doing business. By the way, I am sending you a ~ ' 'o51 BRITISH LEGATION, JEDDA, HEJAZ. the Foreign Office on the coimnunication I made to Yusuf Ytsin on June 5 alDout the message Ihn Sa'ud gave you for HJvUG. Please do not think that I was 'belittling the importance of your visit. The fact is that the matter was delicate in a small way, as I had to gloss over the principal reason why an acknowledgement was not sent at the time viz. 9 the strain on relations in February and March produced by the Bakhit affair and the Hejazi onslaught on Myself. Gan you tell me anything about Ibn Sa T ud ! s purchase of dhows for 'naval 11 purposes in Bahrain ? On my return here I find everyone talking of one of them which had come here. I gather that it had an auxiliary engine and one gun of sorts. It y /as sent to Wejh, before I could get a proper view of it, with arms etc., in connection with the Ibn Rifada affair.

Whether it led to. or is likely to lead to, anything very definite I do not know. The only two questions in vfriich I was really interested were the Kuwait 'blockade ani the landing ground, which seemed to me important now that it is definitely settled that the air route is coming down to the Arab coast. As regards the blockade I do not know that I myself am very optimistic about any result coming from the appointment of commission ers, but the people at home seem to be so exceedingly unmindful of their definite promises in this matter and so exceedingly reluctant to take any action whatsoever that I thought it would at least brings matters to|8|head and draw attention to it, and that, at any rate, it has done, and you will presumably get some instructions of sorts to approach the HeJaE Government on the subject. r j?here is a fatal tendency at home to make specious promises whenever any difficulty arises and entirely to forget them iririen the difficulty/difficulty Is paseed, a state of affairs which does not enksnce our reputation. As regards the landing ground, Yusuf Yasln was most definite and said that Hie Majesty would agree to a landing ground on any island if he could get only the actual expenses; however, they seem to have opened their laouths wider now. The civil air route is definitely going to be trans ferred to the Arab side with effect from the let October, so it would seem desirable to obtain as many facilities for , Airways as possible. I do not think there is much reel objection to Ibn Saud ani the Shaikh of ituwait settling utiat I may term 'desert Blatters' together, namely, thefts of camels, petty raids, etc., and we may be quite certain that if the, natter is one of any Importance the Shaikh of i£uwalt will come hurrying to us to intervene on his behalf without delay, so that 1 do not really think therejis very much chance of Ibn Saud being allowed to ignore our special position in Kuwait. Personally 1 an much more afraid of Iraq than I am of Ibn Saud, since the former have a much greater hold over the Shaikh owing to his extensive properties in Iraq, and will I think, when the Mandate expires, bo much more difficult to deal with, I know notliing more about the motdr dhow than was reported in my April Summary and no more have been bought In Bahrain. The Qusaibis have now apparently come to the end of their tether and refuse to act as agents for Ibn Saud any more. The question of the Bahrain transit dues, which I hoped would die a natural death has suddenly become acute. I am told, though I cannot prove it, that there is some hanky- panky over the business and that the imports for vihich it is desired to obtain overside delivery arejbeing bought by Muhamad Tawil on his own account. Anyhow, you will since havehave got my despatch in which I have suggested that we •hould take up the whole question and Inform Xbn baud that he can either waive his right to free transit or pay port dues, itiiohever he likes. He will doubtless reply that he is in a position to make his own port, hut think this is largely hlitff. Firstly, Has Taniirah is a horrible place to make; secondly, he has not got money enough to make it into a proper port; and thirdly, I believe there is no water there. Actually he is onljr asked to pay 8 per cent, foj / : ■ the facilities at Bahrain which is not very much, and on a oommodl'ty like rice, it does not in any way affect the price | to the ordinary consumer. ■ jj I am hoping to go home for tuo Month®, but the dai;e im not yet fixed and I am not sure when I shall get offr If, however, ^e are 'both hozae at the eacae time I very Much tope that ite ahall meet. %■ h r- ■ , /C/te CM^ 11 ifj SgCRET. 7/ Extract from 'Iraq Command ffortnightly Intelligence Summary ■ n o«14 of 13tli July 1932« / ' ' • ■ / / Retriel forces in HEJA2 « ^ / Reference paragraphs 640, 541 and 542 of 1932. /i On 30th June, the advanced troops of Ibn Rafada's ,/y*! party were located between HBDA (H,37»Sq«b«I t .) and HARAIBA (H.36.Sq.h.xi.) and were proceeding south, The force has been in Hejaz territory over five weeks and has made no effort to try conclusions with Gorernment troops. An unconfirmed report states that this inactivity is according to plan; Ibn Rafadis first rale being to create sufficient diversions in Horthern HEJAZ to cause re-inforcement of garrisons there with Government troops from MECCA, MEDINA and YEHBO IQ.37# Sq.h.v.), while the discontented tribes in these districts were to be encouraged by propaganda to rebel. These tribes are stated to be ready to revolt and a more active role must now be assumed by Ibn Rafada. The rebels are experiencing great difficulty in obtaining food supplies owing to the TRANSJORDAH authorities' closing the frontier to all cars, camels and men. (Authoritys Headquarters, TRAHSJORDAN and PALEST IKS). Disposition of Ibn Sa'ud's Forces . Ibn Sa'ud's forces are reported as followai- (a) DHABA (H.37.Sq .z. i.). 280 troops with 20 carfi, machine guns and 1 field gun. (b) RDWEILA (G.38.Sq.a.xii). 120 troops with a few machine guns. (c) T^K (H.37.Sq.h.ii). 70 troops, 7 cars and a few machine guns.(Garrison inclined to be mutinous). (d) ....(d) Ihn Sa'ud has also raised a force of Akhwan camelmen in SAJIU On 12tli July, this force was reliably reported to be at EL ALA (G#37.Sq # o.v.) and the numbers were given as 1,490 men with 450 rifles. It is under the coiamand of Abdulla ibn Aqayil, The object of this force may first be TBI MA {G.37.Sq. a.vi.)# where the governor has been flouting Ibn ia'ud^ authority for many years. (Auth or itys Headquart er a, TRANSJORDAN and PALESTIHE). On 9th July, a Bedouin, who had accompanied a Najdi force from HAIL (G.38.Sq.a. i.) to MUSTA-JIDDA (a.37.Sq, c.xii), arrived in BAGHDAD• He said the force consisted of 14 standards ('baraiq') of Anaiza and Harb tribes and militia and that the whole was under the command of Abdulla ibn Aqayil, The force was concentrated at MUSTA- JIDDA on 27th June and he reported that Abdulla ibn Aqayil intended to march on TSIMA, where he understood the governor, Abdul Kerim ibn Rumman, had fortified the town and filled in the neighbouring wells for a distance of four camel days as a precaution against possible attack by Sajdi forces. She Bedouin also added that it was oosraon talk in the force that ibn Rumman, the Governor of TEIMA, had been giving money presents to shaikhs, including the Beni Atiyah, and that this money was from outside sources in EGYPT. He ended by saying that the force would wait at MUOTAJlDDA for ammunition from HAIL and would then proceed to TEIMA, arriving there on 9th July; the final destination was to be ITorth HEJA2 which they hoJ)ed to reach about 15th July. The morale of the men in the force was only fair, but that of the leaders was hi^i, % (Authority's S.S.O. BAjSHDAD).

As this force went to EL ALA and not to fElJIA, it is more than probable that TBI MA I is definitely fortified against Ibn Sard's men. In this connection, the following extract from the Head quarters, TRAKSJORDAH and PALESTIHE Sunmary of Intelligence Fo # 6 of 1932, paragraph 59, is of interest: 'Since the commencement of the Ibn Saoud regime, this town (TSIMA) has remained Independent. Its governor, Abdul Karim ibn Rumman, has always refused admission to the King's soldiers and officials, but nevertheless receives them hospitably in a guest tent outside the walls, these are twelve feet thick and are built of mud and sand.

Mr. Hope Gill to Sir John Simon.—(Received June 9.) (No. 205.) Sir, Jedda, May 11, 1932. IN my immediately preceding despatch is transmitted a translation of a speech delivered by Ibn Saud in Mecca on the 12th April, as reported in the 44 Umm-al-Qura.' I understand from some who were present that much more was said in the same vein of religious emotion, but that the newspaper has succeeded in adequately reproducing the main gist of the matter. 2. The occasion was the customary Royal banquet given to some 500 repre sentative Moslems three days before they set out to observe the day of pilgrimage at Arafat. Neither the Indian vice-consul nor, I think, any of the Moslem foreign representatives were present, although they were invited. A number of prominent Indian pilgrims attended however. 3. The speech as heard and retailed has been badly received and is severely criticised, the remark : 'By God, I fear the foreigner once, but I fear those who pretend to be Moslem three thousand times,' being regarded as particularly offensive. My Turkish and Iraqi colleagues are highly incensed at the uncomplimentary reference to the Saudi regime's predecessors, to £&lt; the bloodshed then done, the sins committed, and the peace violated.' I am credibly informed that when Ibn Saud came to Jedda after the pilgrimage he shocked a number of leading Jeddawis by greeting them with the words : ' I could cut the throats of every one of you.' 4 All observers are agreed that Ibn Saud is at his wits' end to obtain money y and many affirm that he is feeling insecure. He certainly seems to have lost much of the poise and balance which distinguished him in the early days of his Hejazi adventure. His present state of uncertainty, with its symptomatic lack of control of ideas and expression, but not yet of action, seems to me to be caused by a very real fear for his financial position, an increased feeling of futility amid the complexities of government, and a growing sense of the hostility which surrounds him in the Hejaz and the Moslem world outside. It was noticed that during the forty-eight hours which he recently spent at Jedda he remained outside the town, which he normally never fails to visit for some inspection or other; indeed he hardly put foot outside the palace building. 5. The effect of these obsessions is aggravated by ill-health. At my short formal audience of the 1st May Ibn Saud was listless, and looked a very different man from what he was a year and a half ago. His face had yellowed under the skin and was pouchy, puckered, and much more lined. Dr. Naji-al-Asil, who has had a number of private audiences in Mecca, confirms my impression that Ibn Saud is physically very unwell and mentally obsessed by problems which he cannot solve and which he now fears to face. It is probable that he will return to Riyadh as soon as he decently can, probably in less than a month's time. 6. I may here mention that on the 1st May Ibn Saud was polite, but distant. He smiled once or twice, but had nothing to say. I purposely allowed two long pauses to lengthen in order to draw, if possible, some reference to current topics, such as the Minister's absence. Ibn Saud at length broke the first silence with a comment on the weather, which had already received adequate comment. I broke the second one myself with a request for permission to leave. I have, &amp;c. C. G. HOPE GILL. [489 i—1]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT [E 3216/640/25] No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received June 28.) v (No. 236.) Si r} Jetpia, June 7, 1932. ' I HAD the honour to report in my telegram No. 60 of the 30th May my arrival in Jedda on that day. In view of the circumstances of my recent absence it mav be worth while to give a short account of certain matters connected with my return. 2. I reached Jedda in H.M.S. ' Hastings ' on the morning of the 30th May. I was met on board by Hamdi Bey, the Director-General of Military Organi sation, who had been sent from Mecca to present the King's compliments, and who was accompanied by a junior officer. I was welcomed at the quay by the Governor of Jedda in person, attended by all the principal local officials holding subordinate posts. 3. As this was my first landing in Jedda from a warship since my first arrival, I cannot be certain that the sending of Hamdi Bey to meet me was in the nature of an extra courtesy, but I got the impression that the Hejazi Government were anxious to show the maximum of politeness on this particular occasion. In order to show my appreciation, I made the official announcement of my return more than formal. I enclose a copy of my note to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and a translation of the Acting Minister's acknowledgment^ 1 ) 4. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin arrived in Jedda on the evening of the 2nd June. He visited me the next morning and expressed in the most cordial terms the King's satisfaction and his own at my return in good health. He went on to congratulate me on the anniversary of King George's birthday and delivered the message embodied in my telegram No. 64 of the 3rd June. 5. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin came again in the afternoon to the reception held by my wife and myself to celebrate His Majesty's birthday. The gathering of Europeans, local notables, Indians, &amp;c., was a large one for Jedda, and both Sheikh Yusuf and the Governor were full of friendliness. 6. I am afraid that Sheikh Yusuf Yasin's journey from Taif to Jedda was undertaken primarily with the object of pressing me in connexion with the Ibn Rifada incident, which so unfortunately came to a head just before my return. It is nevertheless gratifying to have evidence of so strong a desire on the part of Ibn Saud and his Government to treat the episode arisiDg out of the Bakhit case as dead and buried, at any rate for the time being. I think that their general attitude has been a good deal affected for the better by the reception accorded to the Amir Feisal's mission in London and more especially by the telegram addressed by His Majesty the King to King Abdul Aziz on the occasion of its departure. 7. I am doubtful as to how far the present atmosphere of affability can be expected to survive future strains, but I need hardly say that on my own side I have contributed my full quota to the flow of courtesy. There has been no reference on either side to the Bakhit affair and its aftermath. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW EYAN. (') Not printed. [489 ee—2]urn tfo. 61/11 E 30. H.M's CHaarge d'Affaires, Jedda.

' WITH reference to Mr. Hope Gill's despatch No. 205 of the 11th May, commenting on Ibn Sand's speech at his pilgrim banquet on the 12th April, I have the honour to state that the King seems to have created somewhat of a sensation by another flight of eloquence when he addressed a company of Hejazi notables in Mecca on the eve of his departure for Taif on the 23rd May. According to private accounts of the gathering, His Majesty indulged in extremely strong language about the abuses complained of by pilgrims, and, while excusing the irregularities practised by exploiters of the poorer sort, criticised in the severest terms people in intermediate positions, and most of all those of the highest class, including, it is said, his own officials. He is reported to have spoken of chopping off heads as a remedy, which he had thought of applying at once, and with his own hand, but for which on the present occasion he was substituting a warning; and to have attacked the younger of his hearers for their inclination to read Egyptian political literature and to tread in the materialistic ways of Europe. 2. There may be a good deal of exaggeration in the version which I have summarised in the preceding paragraph, but the speech seems, nevertheless, to have been intended as a cautionary sermon for the special benefit of the Hejazis. The ' Umm-al-Qura ' published on the 27th May a long account of it, in which it is possible to detect the boom of menace in the sea of somewhat militant piety to which Ibn Sand has accustomed his Moslem hearers. &lt;£ You know,' he said, ' that we entered the Hejaz only after we have been fought against in our home. By God, we do not withstand anything unless we are first attacked, and if we are attacked we defend our religion, ourselves, our nation and home; and God grants us success, which is a blessing from Him. When we arrive at a place we order its people to follow the commands in the Holy Book and the traditions of the Prophet. We are only warriors in the cause of God.' 3. The King, according to the ' Umm-al-Qura' report, described his readiness to enquire into the state of the people and his care for their welfare. ' 0 people of this holy land sacred land,' he cried, 'by God, I look at the old as my father, the middle-aged as my brother and the young as my son. What I say is what I believe and God is the best witness.' He went on to define his attitude towards modern civilisation. He would depart in nothing from the commands of God as conveyed by the Prophet; he would accept what was beneficial and permitted by Islam, opposing what was contrary to it. There was no civilisation preferable or better than that of Islam. 4. Presently the King delivered himself of the following passages :— ' You must advise ignorant people and guide them to the right path. If he follows the advice, thank God; but if he refuses he will be responsible for his sin. ' I swear by God that I like peace and endeavour to maintain it, but in case I am afflicted, I keep still till the very end, and if the time of defence comes I will defend the religion and country. ' If there is nothing to ride on except spear-heads, the compelled one cannot help riding on them. Then there will be one of two alternatives : either happiness or martyrdom, and each of them is a blessing from God. We are prepared to meet either of them with open arms and cheerful faces, as this is the tradition of the Prophet of God and his friends after him.' 5. The King went on to divide people generally into three classes, the helpers, the indifferent, whom efforts should be made to guide in the right way, and the opposers, whose punishment would be great in this world and in the next. [516 n—3]Tie called upon his hearers, as being the chiefs and leaders of the nation, to submit any complaints to him and to give him their guidance, bearing in mind, however, the injunction of the Caliph Omar to one who sought to advise him, that it should be ' between me and him.' He would investigate any complaint he received. His hearers should engage in useful work. ' The land of God is so vast and broad, you should go round about and do some work, eschewing laziness, which brings evil results.' He had brought them together to counsel them, so that the stupid might not be tempted by clemency to persevere in error. He warned them against apostasy and deviation from Islam in these holy lands. Any ; that he saw guilty of such deviation would be severely punished, as would be those who were tempted by the devil to commit subversive actions. These he would treat as dynamite. Anyone who had a grievance against another could appeal to him, even though the complaint was against his son Feisal; and, if he neglected the complaint and upheld his son, then his own conduct would give just ground for complaint. 6. His Majesty ended his speech, as reported in the ' Umm-al-Qura,' with a prayer that all might enjoy the blessing and freedom of Islam; a renewal of his warning to those likely to be tempted by the devil (' for I am one who keeps his ^ord, and, if I say, I do, and, if I do, I continue and do not care for the consequences '); an intimation that he had wished to punish some of those who strayed from the faith or had evil intentions against the country, but had preferred to give a general warning; and a final exhortation to the inhabitants of the holy place, who, more than any others, should adhere to God's commands and the traditions of the Prophet.

CONFIDENTIAL, /j A I QmmiTF^ S ection 1. ^ J [E 3505/76/25] Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received July 13.) (No. 258.) Sir, Jedda, June 21, 1932. SINCE writing my despatch No. 234 of the 17th June, I have heard various reports, most of which rank no higher than rumours, but which are worth recording, in connexion with the Ibn Rifada affair and its repercussions or possible repercussions elsewhere in the Hejaz. The principal sources are my Indian vice-consul, who recently maHfe a short stay at Taif, and the French Charge d J Affaires, with whom I had a most unusual amount of general conversation on the 8th and 20th June. 2. There has undoubtedly been much malaise in Hejazi circles for some time past. It was stimulated by the King's trenchant address to the notables at Mecca on the 22nd May, which has formed the subject of a separate report. The news of Ibn Itifada's adventure fell on a soil of public opinion prepared for every kind of untoward eventuality. Fear of Ibn Saud, fear of war and doubts as to the stability of the regime are among the characteristic symptoms of the general uneasiness. ^3. Old friends fought shy of the Indian vice-consul at Taif. The King received him, but confined himself to conventional conversation on topics like the weather and my health. The Khan Bahadur saw, however, the president of the Legislative Council and picked up various items of information, from which it would appear that the King is perturbed not only by the situation in the north, but by the state of feeling among the naturally unruly tribes round Taif. It was said that many of the leading men had been imprisoned, and that some were released 1 after a few days, while others were detained. The King was also said to be looking suspiciously towards the Yemen, to suspect Hashimite activity in that direction, and to be contemplating measures in Asir, including the despatch thither of one of the family of the IJIrector-General of Finance. 4. It was reported that the King had summoned the well-known military leader, Khalid-al-Lowai, from Turaba for consultation, and that a few days later fifty lorry loads of soldiers, which had been standing by outside the palace,, left Taif, possibly to be placed under Khalid's command. The vice-consul saw personally a certain Sheikh Abdullah Jefali, who played a role in the last war in the Hejaz, mainly, I gather, on the commissariat side. This person was expecting to be sent to Medina. The Amir Neshmi, who has apparently been in these parts,, is said to have been despatched with a force to Wejh. What with these movements and the turn out of tribal forces from the regions of Hail, Jauf, &amp;c., the vice-consul's informants estimated that Ibn Saud was mobilising at least 5,000 men, with the object of inflicting a crushing defeat on the present rebels and giving a salutary lesson to all and sundry. 5. The arrest of Faudhi-al-Kawokji seems to have created no small sensation. It is undoubtedly connected with the Ibn Rifada affair as an immediate cause, but it has its own background of rumour. It is suggested {a) that the Amir Feisal had incurred the King's displeasure before he left for Europe (compare Mr. Hope Gill's telegram No. 56 of the 8th May); (h) that there is a split among the influential Syrians, and notably a great enmity between Fuad Bey Hamza and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, owing to an intrigue between the tormer and the wife of the latter; (c) that Faudhi is a prot^e of the Amir Feisal;; and [d) that Yusuf Yasin took advantage of the absence of the Amir and Fuad to procure Faudhi's arrest on receipt of the news about Ibn Rifada. There is said to be yet another lady in the case in the person of the Amir's latest wife who is described as being a woman of Nejdi and Turkish parentage, born and educated m Oonstantmople, strong-minded, and determined to make a man of the Amir who is alleged to be much under her influence and to have agreed to discard his other wives m her favour. Finally, there was talk in Mecca and Taif of other arrests besides that of Faudhi, but of these I have no particulars 1516 n—1]2 6. Most of the preceding paragraph must be regarded as doubtful, but it is not quite such small beer as might appear at first sight. 1 am assured that, whatever the reason, Fuad Hamza and Yusuf Y asin are seriously at loggerheads, and any quarrel between these two is a quarrel between an ambitious moderniser and one who is out and out the King's man. It is not impossible that the Amir Feisal, a man of no great character but some intelligence, swollen perhaps with the vanity of having been Viceroy of the Hejaz, might become the stalking horse of a party formed to pull the Hejaz out of the morass in which the King's attempts at administration and economic depression have landed it. The report that all is not well between the Amir and the King deserves some support from the fact that he expected to be detained at Riyadh on his return from his tour, an expectation which he is said to have announced to his friends before he left, and which he confessed to me vaguely in conversation in London. There is, in fact, tinder enough about to take fire, if the Ibn Rifada affair precipitated a serious situation. 7. This brings me back to Ibn Rifada, whose position and prospects are still shrouded in mystery. My French colleague is convinced that the Government here are concealing facts, and that the situation in the north is more serious than they will admit. I think he is going less on any known facts than on a plausible theory that tribesmen may well be supposed to have rallied to the invader, and that underpaid garrisons, notably that at Tebuk, have long been so discontented that they might easily go over. On my suggesting that, if the situation were really serious, the King would probably take it in hand himself and go at least as far as Medina, M. Maigret developed the theory that Ibn Saud dared not leave Taif owing to the doubtful loyalty of the tribes round that place, of whose restiveness he had heard tales similar to those brought me by the Indian vice-consul. 8. I take the opportunity of mentioning one matter of actual fact. You will remember that, on the 4th June, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin mentioned to me the arrest of a launch from Suez at Wejh. On the 8th June I found that my French colleague had been approached about this by a certain Ansara, who had brought the launch to Wejh. M. Maigret was at first cautious, but he told me, on the 20th June, that he had ascertained that the vessel was under the French flag, although Ansara was, he said, an Egyptian, not a Syrian, as I had heard elsewhere. He then took the matter up with some vigour with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, but has not so far got any explanation of the arrest except that it was due to contravention of unspecified regulations. No one can, or will, tell me what the launch carried, but the Hejazi Government evidently attach importance to her, as they have detained her and her crew since the 31st May at the risk of disagreeableness with the French. Ansara himself is said to be on his way to Taif, whether as a free man or as a prisoner, I know not. As I write, I learn that he has got as far a§ Jedda by car. 9.

Sir A . Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received August 3.) (No. 294.) gi rj Jedda, July 1$32. ' IN my despatch No. 250 of the 17th June I reported on a speech by Ibn Saud, which revealed his attitude towards the townspeople of the Hejaz, and in my despatch No. 258 of the 21st June I dealt with various matters bearing on the uneasy internal situation in this country. .This reflection in the public mind of this uneasiness has been greatly stimulated by the somewhat drastic proceedings of the police and the Government during the last couple of weeks. 2. It is stated that on the night of the 25th June the Director of Police of Mecca, a powerful and arbitrary official, created no small emotion by posting armed men all over the town, with the ostensible object, it appeared afterwards, of merely raiding a house where country wine was supposed to be made, and in which four tins of wine were actually found. 3. The same report reproduces a story for which I should be sorry to vouch, and quote only as an example of the sort of gossip that goes about in an excited and fearful atmosphere. It is said that the King sent back some soldiers who had come from Khurma to Taif, and that the Amir Khalid-bin-Lowai had explained that His Majesty did not require them, that the English would bring Ibn Eifada to Taif for delivery to the King, who would strike off his head, and that the English had further promised to turn the ' dirty pig ' Abdullah out of Transjordan and send him to Iraq. 4. More importance attaches to certain police proceedings in Jedda on the night of the 28th June, when a large number of residents were arrested. Some of them were released at once, some others within a few days; but several were sent to the interior. I need not quote the rumours on this subject, as the Govern ment took the unusual course of publishing a communique in the 'Umm-al-Qura ' of the 1st July. I enclose a translation of this document, minus the pious exordium which explains that this holy land is a place for prayer and work, not for propaganda^ 1 ) 5. It is interesting to note that the avowed object of the raid in Jedda was to discourage the circulation of rumours, a subject on which I have had conver sations with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, in circumstances described in the correspondence arising out of the Ibn Rifada affair. One of the persons deported to the interior is a well-known Hadhrami sheikh. I believe him to be entitled to British protection and am keeping his case in mind, although I do not feel that I can prudently intervene on his behalf at the present moment. 6. The public execution in Jedda on the 1st July of a murderer, a man of the Juheina tribe, has also created an impression, though, apart from the barbarity with which it was carried out and the fact that the man had excited interest some weeks before by escaping from prison, this incident need not call for much comment at a normal time. The man seems to have richly deserved his fate. 7. It was reported at the end of June that the playing of football had been prohibited. It is not clear that any formal prohibition was enacted, but there was a strong belief in interested circles that persons who continued to play might be arrested. The feeling against football in high quarters is due to a belief that it brings young men together in clubs and affords an opportunity for subversive talk. There is probably some foundation for this belief. 8. What emerges from all this is that the authorities are nervous at the state of public feeling, and have taken action which aims as much at intimidating the townsmen as at repressing particular activities. The former object has been achieved in Jedda. The people hardly dare to talk and are shy of foreigners. My French colleague goes so far as to speak of ' une terreur g^Wrale.'' It is [542 c—1] Not printed.likely to be intensified by the appointment as head of police of an arrogant official who held a similar post at Rabigh. This man, Syed Kurdi, is believed to come from Eas-al-Ain, near Aleppo. The town is said to be full of spies. Even the innocent-looking and in itself legitimate census excites .mistrust. Apart froin the common oriental fear that it is a prelude to conscription or taxation, there is widespread doubt as to whether it is safer to declare oneself a Hejazi and put oneself at the mercy of the Government, or to claim foreign nationality and risk their vindictiveness. There is talk of other arrests, including that of a clerk in the now vacant German consulate, who is said to be a Turkish subject. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN y255. 502/165/25).

As you are aware, the matter was taicen up in London hy the mission presided over 'by His Royal Highness the Amir leysal. In amplification of the reply which was given to the mission, my Government instruct me to explain, (a) that, apart from such wholly exceptional cases as arose during the world war, it is not their practice them selves to maice loans to foreign Governments; and (To) that it would be impossible in any case, in present financial conditions, to obtain the necessary parliamentary sanction for a loan to the Hejazi Government. I am. to add that, for the reasons which were explained to the mission when they visited the Bank of England on May 13,it would not be possible for the Hejazi Government at the present time to raise a loan in the City of London. While compelled after very close consideration of this matter to adhere to the attitude taken up during the mission's visit, my Government particularly wish me to express their warm appreciation of the kind assurances of regard, which accompanied His Majesty's message.

Sir, Jedda, August 30, 1932. WITH reference to paragraph 6 of my telegram No. 165 of the 21st August, I have the honour to state that Ibn Saud came to Jedda to-day for the inside of the day—■' to take leave of the foreign representatives before proceeding to Nejd,' was the formula used. He received the representatives in a series of formal audiences in the forenoon. His graciousness, when my turn came, left nothing to be desired. I had not seen His Majesty for fourteen months and had in the interval heard very varying accounts of his physical state. On this occasion both Mr. Wikeley, who accompanied me, and I myself were struck by his appearance □f good health, though Mr. Wikeley thought he had put on a good deal of flesh in a part of his anatomy which I was not noticing. He was quite lively in the oackchat of compliment. 2. I had not intended to seek a further audience as I felt that I could neither avoid nor usefully discuss the situation between Hejaz-Nejd and Trans- jordan until you had considered it further. Fuad Bey Hamza, however, was keen on my doing so, and I authorised him to say that, although I had nothing to lay before the King, I should be grateful if His Majesty would receive me in case he had anything to say before we left for Nejd and England respectively. The audience was arranged for this afternoon. At the outset, I presented to the King Commander A. R. Farquhar, of H.M.S. ' Penzance,' which, by an unintended coincidence, arrived at Jedda on the same day as Ibn Saud. 3. After Commander Farquhar had retired, the King and I, with Fuad Bey interpreting, engaged in a general conversation on the present situation; but one so very general that it wxmld be useless to weary you with its details. The King reaffirmed all his familiar principles, his friendship for and belief in Great Britain, his desire to receive and to be guided by her advice, &amp;c., and proclaimed tiis unshakable fidelity to them, subject only to the qualifications that she must safeguard his honour and his interests. I gave all the usual replies, vdth illustrations drawn from various sources, including the attitude observed by His Majesty's Government during the Ibn Rifada affair. 4. The fact is that both His Majesty and I were talking, and talked for an tiour, platitudes with a purpose. That of the King was to prove that no gentle- nan, however reasonable, could feel safe with a person like the Amir Abdullah 3ver his border; mine to instil the idea that to the practical British mind the Ibn Rifada affair appeared a matter which had been finished with, that permanent snmity was not a practical basis for the relations between rulers and that a fresh start should be made. We might have come to closer grips with the real subject 3f the conversation, if I had not had to make way for the Soviet Minister, who bad already been kept waiting a quarter of an hour. 5. As it was neither of us put a name to the Amir Abdullah, who so filled Dur thoughts, but the King mentioned King Faisal as a most commendable monarch with whom, thanks'to His Majesty's Government, he was on the best of terms. It is all the rage now in high Hejazi circles to represent the King of Iraq as a good Arab, un homme serieux, in contrast with his brother Abdullah, who is regarded as the incarnation of intrigue and untrustworthiness. 6.

' WITH reference to Mr. Hope Gill's despatch No. 140 of the 20tli March and previous correspondence relative to the financial situation of this country, I have the honour to forward a translation of a regulation published in the 'Umm-al-Qura'' of the 17th June, regarding the mode of settlement of Government debts. The wording of the regulation is in some respects obscure, and I should not like to vouch for the complete accuracy of the translation. The principle appears to be that all debts (meaning, presumably, debts dating from before the current financial year, although this is not stated) will, except as provided in articles 1, 2, 5 and 6, be paid by drafts on customs, where such drafts have not already been issued in respect of them, and that such drafts will be accepted in payment of 25 per cent, of the duty on newly-imported goods. Claimants who are not themselves importing merchants are to nominate such merchants, in whose name the drafts will be issued. I understand that, as might be expected, the market for drafts on customs is very poor, but it is too soon to judge of the practical effect of the regulation. 2. I have reported elsewhere on a representation made to me by the Acting Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the discouraging advice alleged to have been given by His Majesty's Government to the business friends of a M. Ydlibi, who is interested in enterprise in this country. I suggested, in this connexion, to Sheikh Yussuf Yasin that the Hejazi Government were themselves destroying any credit they might have. This led the sheikh to give me on the 26th June his general views about the financial situation. He spoke of the poverty of the Hejaz and the conditions in other countries, referring, inter alia, to the loss imposed on so many people by Great Britain's abandonment of the gold standard. 3. I explained to Sheikh Yussuf at some length that what I complained of was not the effects of the poverty of the Hejaz, which might well necessitate special arrangements with creditors, but the financial methods employed, which were such that no creditor knew where he stood. I had not, I said, pressed him on the subject of claims in which His Majesty's Government were interested, because we had been absorbed in the Transjordan frontier, but I ran him through the list in order to illustrate my thesis. It had been announced last autumn that one-fourth of the whole revenue would be assigned to the payment of old debts, and I had in January given Sheikh Fuad Hamza my views as to how the Government might be expected to deal with the floating debt problem. The arrangement of last autumn seemed to have been lost sight of, and there was now a new regulation which I did not quite understand, but which seemed to produce certain definite effects. 4. I told Sheikh Yussuf that article 1 of the new regulation seemed to me to be a grand arrangement for creditors who had special arrangements. I expected to hear at any moment that Egyptian Shell had been paid the amounts due for the benzine which the Government had acquired in peculiar circumstances last September, and in respect of which the Director-General of Finance had made and then dishonoured a special agreement. I was interested, however, in other claims, about which no special arrangements had been made. I gave, as one example, the small sum due to His Majesty's Government for the Hejazi share in the expenditure on the MacDonnell investigation. Was it really intended, I asked, that I should take out drafts on customs and get a local importing merchant to discount them for me? The sheikh replied in a rather shocked tone that the regulation did not apply to the case in point. I referred also to a subject on which I had spoken to him on the 12th June, but with which I have not felt it necessary to trouble you, namely, the action (successful in some cases) of the [542 s—2]Directorate-General of Finance in trying to get chauffeurs employed in Govern ment-controlled motor companies to accept one-third of the arrears due to them in full settlement. , 1 5. If the Hejazi Government would only adopt some sensible method of dealing with the floating debt on a moratorium basis and stick to it, I should not be so hard on them. As it is, the prospects of creditors are pretty desperate. I hope that, if the political situation grows easier, I may be able, before going on, leave, to bring up to date the position in regard to the specific claims in which His Majesty's Government are interested. If so, t I will report on the particular cases as may be necessary. I have, &amp;c. ANDEEW EYAN. Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from ' Umm-al-Qura 'of Safar 12, 1351 {June 17, 1932). Decision in respect of Debts. (Translation.) THE following has been received from the Press Department: — The Ministry of Finance makes the following declaration regarding debts due by the Government: — 1. Debts concerning which an arrangement has already been reached with the creditors will be dealt with in accordance with that agreement. 2. With regard to debts in respect of which the Directorate of Finance has given to the creditors drafts on the customs, 25 per cent, of the customs revenue will be set aside for the creditors in payment of the amount due to them. These drafts will remain valid as issued. 3. With regard to debts in respect of which the creditors do not hold drafts of the customs, the Directorate of Finance is prepared to give to the creditors in person drafts in payment, so that the drafts may be set off against the customs duty payable by the creditor at the rate of 25 per cent. 4. Every Government employee whose salary is in arrear may take a draft on the customs, as may any merchant who does not import goods through the customs. Such an employee or such a merchant must make an agreement with another merchant (presumably one of those who do import goods) and forward his name to the Government, whereupon a draft will be given to the specified merchant in respect of the amount due to the (original) merchant, which will be set off against the customs duty payable by him (the specified merchant?) at the rate of 25 per cent. The said merchant (No. 2?) is not allowed to sell the draft to another person. 5. In the case of soldiers, police and chauffeurs in the Government employ ment, who are still in that employment, the Government will give them, in respect of their arrears of pay, supplies in kind—a suitable quantity for each month— until all their claims are liquidated. This is in addition to the salaries which will be paid to them and to all other employees. 6. Debts due by the Government in respect of house rent will be settled in accordance with the special regulation in respect of delayed payments of houseTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (A rabia). CONFIDENTIAL. [E 4402/76/25] ' No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received August 30) (No. 350.) Sir, Jedda, August 15, 1932. WITH reference to my telegram No. 159 of the 12tli August, I have the honour to forward herewith a precis of the large number of articles, &amp;c., published in the first number of the ' Umm-al-Qura,' that of the 5th August, issued after the defeat of Ibn Eifada at Jebel Shar.Q These documents give a better idea than anything I could myself write of the storm raised in this country by the Ibn Rifada affair, not so much because of the importance of that affair in itself as because of the universal belief that the Amir of Trans Jordan is the real enemy, and that it was he who launched the rebellion. You will note the insistence on the word £&lt; jihad,' a familiar term to Europeans. Hardly less significance attaches to the. recurrence of the word ' munafiqun ' or hypocrites, the name given by the prophet, as Hughes says, 4 'to those residents of A1 Madinah, who during his first stay in that city ostensibly joined Islam, but in secret were disaffected.' Their memory is execrated by all good Moslems. 2. The various telegrams addressed to the King mark doubtless the response to an impulse from the centre, but no one who knows the history of the Akhwan and the independent spirit of people like the Ulama of Nejd can suppose that Ibn Saud has simply turned on a tap which he can as easily turn off. He and his advisers still hold by the theory that, when he made war on the Akhwan in 1929, he was choosing between two evils and elected to reduce his own subjects rather than embroil himself with Great Britain and Iraq. It is suggested, and indeed it has been definitely stated to me by Euad Bey Hamza, that the King, if confronted by a similar dilemma to-day, would not go against the Akhwan for the sake of Transjordan or the Amir Abdullah. It is fortunately recognised that the factor of Great Britain remains common to the two situations. I believe Ibn Saud to be sincerely anxious to avoid a conflict with His Majesty's Govern ment. Hence the decision, which I recorded in my telegram No. 162 of the 15th August, to head the Akhwan off with a promise to explain the situation to them further and to report progress two months hence. I have reported in other despatches on the King's insistence on the view that there can be no real peace unless the Amir Abdullah is eliminated. 3. I do not say that, if the Akhwan simmer down now, they will necessarily boil up again to the same extent in October or that Ibn Saud will necessarily press his views regarding the Amir to their logical conclusion. I do, however, see possibilities of grave danger ahead, having regard to the strength of the religious feeling which has been aroused, and the hatred with which the King regards the Amir, whose complicity in the Ibn Rifada affair and other attempts to destroy his regime admits of no doubt in His Majesty's mind. 4. The ' Umm-al-Qura ' of the 12th August contained nothing of interest equal to that of the special number of the 5th August. The following are the principal items — {a) A further telegram, again undated, from Ibn Aqil, a summary of which was given in my telegram No. 160 of the 13th August. I enclose a translation of this.^) (5) An article intended to elucidate some of the historical aspects of the Ibn Rifada affair. I enclose a brief summary of the principal facts alleged in this.Q {c) An article on the aftermath of the Ibn Rifada affair which describes the still growing ferment in the interior; the receipt of further messages from the Qahtan country, Abba, Jizan and Jauf; the continued insistence by the forces at Taif on their previous demands; ^ August 30, 1932.

(d) The text of the loyal memorial of the townsmen, which had already appeared in the 44 Saut-al-Hejaz ' and which is noted at the foot of the first enclosure in this despatch. 5. I may mention one other matter dealt with in the { ' Umm-al -Qura' which bears on the relations between the King and the Amir Abdullah. A short article headed 'For Amusement ' in the number of the 5th August referred ironically to a projected Arab conference, as being a thing for which the name Arab is too great. Its members would be fugitive hypocrites and brigands meeting by order of ' the big devi] ' and under the supervision of his assistants It would discuss the means of fomenting disturbance. Its decisions would be misleading, deceits, &amp;c. Its results would be to reveal still further to the Islamic and Arab worlds the evil intent of the participators. In the number of the 12th August there appears a caution to the effect that the reference was to a report in a Transjordan newspaper about an ' Arab conference for Trans- j or dan,' which, according to the paper in question, was to be held at Amman to discuss injustice in the Hejaz. I have seen many references in reports from Jerusalem to the pan-Arab Congress which has been contemplated in certain quarters for some time past, but I know nothing of any proposal to hold a separate conference at Amman. The caution in the last number of the £&lt; Umm-al-Qura ' would appear to suggest that the editor did not wish the article published on the 5th August to be taken as applying to the projected pan-Arab Congress which, so far as I am aware, has not as yet attracted much attention here. 6, I am sending copies of this despatch and the enclosures to His Maiesty's High Commissioners at Jerusalem, Cairo and Bagdad.

On what ground, he tinnV the Egyptian Government put a stop to a normal maritime trade m « food-stuffs carried on by Egyptian subjects ? The cargoes were manifested to the y i ports under the control of the Hejaz Government. It was for the Hejaz Government to ensure that they were not deflected to ports under rebel control. What we were todt a f king was than would be expected in time of war. Mr. Smart remarked ^ that, precisely because there was no regular state of war, stronger measures could be taken, since the rebels had not acquired the status of belligerents. Bedawi Pasha maintained that the Hejaz Government were responsible for the control of their own coasts. 3. It had been suggested, he continued, that the dhow &lt;£ Taif ' should: be sent back from Kosseir to Suez, where a board of assessment could estimate the owner's damages. Who was going to pay the bill ? He particularly disliked the idea of putting escorts regularly on vessels proceeding from one Egyptian port to another. This appeared to him excessive. What right had the Egyptian Government to impose escorts on Egyptian vessels pursuing a normal trade ? 4. Mr. Smart urged that the Egyptian Government could by an act of sovereignty impose restrictions in the interest of relations of ' bon voisinage.' The Government of Transjordan and Palestine had imposed an absolute veto on ^P or t food-stuffs to the Hejaz. He quoted the ' Gazana ' case, when the Mixed Court of Appeal in 1927 had held that the Egyptian Government, in the interest of neighbourly Moslem relations, were justified in preventing the shipment of arms to the Hejaz—at that time a cockpit of the Ibn Saud-Hashimite struggle. Bedawi Pasha made a distinction between this question of tranship ment of an arms cargo in an Egyptian port and interference with a normal trade movement. He added that such a partisan attitude on the part of the Egyptian Government m favour of Ibn Saud came perilously near to Egyptian recognition oi Ibn Sand's Government. For political reasons with which he was not con cerned, the Egyptian Government did not wish to recognise the present Heiaz Government and they had to be careful not to take action or issue regulations winch would seem to involve recognition. 5. The oriental secretary urged the consideration of political expediency. It was desirable that Egypt should not give any opening to those who were suggesting that she was favourable to the rebels. He argued that, a deflection to a port under rebel control would constitute an irregularity in respect of the •declared manifest of the offending vessel, the Egyptian Government might possibly devise some system of guarantees. Bedawi Pasha undertook to consider tins question as sympathetically as possible, but he expressed the hope that we should recognise the real difficulties «5f the Egyptian Government, [542 p—112 6. The matter was again discussed with Bedawi Pasha and with the Under- Secretary of State, Ministry of the Interior, by the acting oriental secretary on the ist August-. I attach a statementQ of the measures which the'EgyptiaTi authorities finally declared themselves prepared to enforce. In the course of this discussion reference was again made to the Egyptian Government's wish to avoid any implication of recognition of the present Hejaz Government such as might be suggested by official intervention on King Ibn Saud's behalf as against his rebellious subjects. This consideration would seem to have notably limited the Egyptian Government's action. 7.

IBN SAUD has been more given to deeds than words during the three or four months which have elapsed since his parting speech at Mecca, which was reported in Sir A. Ryan's despatch No. 250 of the 17th June. He has no doubt the more readily granted, if he did not command, an interview with the rising young ' Saut-al-Hijaz.' This was published in its issue of the 12th September. 2. Leading question and rambling answer is the form adopted, thus: Question: 'What, your Majesty, is the military situation on the northern frontiers since the annihilation of Ibn Rifada and his party and the purification of that district?' Answer: 'You are aware that those who encouraged Ibn Rifada have injured themselves and exposed him and poor Bedouin to death, so that they have become an example to everyone who may take warning there from. Our position on the northern frontiers is that peace exists everywhere there and that our frontier guards and forces are ready to punish anyone who may think to move his lips for the disturbing of peace. You are also aware that I have greatly endeavoured to keep peace throughout my countries, cities and villages, and even in the deserts, so that no property may be lost; and if anything is lost, I issue orders for making accurate search till I catch the offender and punish him in accordance with the Shari'a laws. This fact is in my consideration the first principle to which I incline, even if it causes loss of much time and of things dear to me.' Question: 'What is your Majesty's position towards neighbouring Governments ?' A nswer: '' All people who know me are aware that I endeavour to keep peace and prefer it, so long as it is for the safety of the lives, honour and countries which are in my charge. This is my principle, and I pray God may grant me success in the future also. You will therefore see that I am in the evident position of peace and friendship with the Governments neighbouring on the Hejaz-Nejd and its dependencies.' 3. The third question refers to the Arab Conference at Jerusalem and to another which is expected to be held shortly (presumably that at Bagdad), and asks what His Majesty thinks of them, in view of the fact that his country comprises the greater part of the Arabian Peninsula, and that its geographical religious, historical, linguistic and political qualifications entitle its inhabitants to play a leading role. The answer is evasive and anodyne : ' You are aware that my first task is to follow the ancestors, to ensure that everyone receives his right, to render people of all classes comfortable, to establish peace, to improve the condition of the country, and to make the regulations necessary for its administra tion. As regards the position of my countries towards the neighbouring Govern ments, this matter concerns me as well as the Arabs, who undoubtedly will not remain far from each other for ever. I think that their inclination to hold one conference after another is the result of the firm belief, which has penetrated deeply into their blood, that they have to co-operate and work hand in hand for the restitution of the honour of Islam, and to behave as good and useful members of human society as their grandfathers did, for the leading of the people to laws, knowledge, the arts and everything to their advantage. This is their natural right and none can blame them for it. The Arab Conference which was held some months ago was due to the necessity of creating understanding between the Arabs, and I hope that the discussions and objects of the next Arab Conference and the wishes of its members will be united and free from the personal and material interests which have hitherto prevented Arabs from co-operating and uniting.' ^ a A l ked finall 7 chances of success of the next Arab Conference are and whether, if invited to join an Arab Alliance, he would accept, Ibn Saud is as discreet as he is pious. The future is in God's hands, he replies, but if, he [599 m—1]repeats, the .decisions of that conference were to be free from taint of personal and material interests and were directed solely towards ' the advantage of the Arabs,' then no Arab would hesitate to co-operate. 'Although I am weak,' he concludes, ' and there is neither might nor power save in God alone, yet if ever I am invited to anything which may redound to the honour, benefit, welfare, and unity of the Arabs, I will be as an individual man of the Arab nation, caring neither for rank nor position, which foster conceit, but affording every possible assistance to that end.' 5.

WJTH reference to my telegrams Nos. 180, 181 and 182 of the 22nd September, announcing the formal adoption of a new style and title by Ibn Saud for himself and this country, I have the honour to transmit herewith translations of— (1) A circular memorandum from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to the foreign representatives, dated the 21st September^ 1 ) and covering (2) A certified copy of Royal decree No. 2716 of the 18th September^ 1 ) which makes the change effective as from the 22nd September and charges the Council of Ministers with the elaboration and submission to His Majesty of a new Constitution, a rule of succession to the throne, and a system of government; and (3) An extract from the Mecca Umm-al-Qura' of the 16th September^) explaining the genesis and execution of what is described as a popular movement of appeal to the King and giving the text of the four leading petitions as telegraphed to Riyadh. 2. The ' Umm-al-Qura ' of the 23rd September publishes the text of a number of other petitions and avers that Ibn Saud received in all over 700 such petitions at Riyadh. I will not weary you with them, except to say that they seem to emanate from all quarters and all classes, also from the guilds, among them the jewellers, brokers, tax collectors, criers to prayer, tent makers, butter sellers, butchers, tinsmiths, upholsterers, and eunuchs. The petitions which I enclose are themselves sufficiently wearying, but I have reproduced them in full to show their exact nature^ 1 ) The first, and the best reasoned, is signed by Fuad Hamza and fifteen of the most prominent citizens of Mecca and Jedda: the second, a short one, by twenty-eight leading personalities of Mecca, including a few shereefs; the third, equally short, by representatives of six Hejazi tribes and the town of Tabuk; and the fourth, the most ebullient, by Abdullah Suleiman and a mixed bag of eighty-two Nejdis, Hejazis and domiciled Indians, Javanese and Hadjramis. 3. It is of particular interest to note that, according to the 'Umm-al- Qura' 1 of the 23rd September, the sequence of events was as follows: First, a general conviction was come to throughout the country that the Hejaz and Nejd, so united in the face of recent events, were brothers; then, the sixteen signatories of Fuad Hamza's petition met at Taif and elaborated its details; they thereupon telegraphed to their friends and colleagues throughout the country, requesting their support; result, 'the news spread like lightning, the whole nation arose and held meetings, and, after long discussions, decided to co-operate, and sent telegrams to His Majesty the King imploring him .... '—to grant, in short, the requests formulated by those sixteen. 4. In spite of its widespread nature, the secret of this move was well kept, and it came as a surprise to the foreign residents and representatives. It can safely be stated that it was no popular movement, born of impulse, but one stage-managed either by the King and his officials, or by Fuad Hamza and some of the latter with the King's knowledge and consent. Before ever the petitions were sent, it was generally realised that the answers had already been decided upon. Only that concerning the succession to the throne gave rise to speculation. This difficult question the King has temporarily shelved for study by the Council of Ministers. Its outcome is entirely problematical. [599 m—2] ( l ) Not printed.5. As far as I can at present surmise, the main reasons for this unification —the word 'tauhfd' is somewhat significantly used, which also epitomises % prime Wahhabi tenet of the 'oneness' of God-—are (1) dynastic, to consolidate the Hejaz as a Saudi possession, to the final discouragement of Hashimite or Republican aspirations; (2) financial, to cover the absorption of the resources of the Hejaz in those of Nejd and perhaps to facilitate the publication of a single Saudi budget of a kind that may create confidence in the money markets- (3) imperial, to assimilate Asir yet more closely to the Saudi rule; and (4), to some extent, constitutional, to enable juristic minds like Fuad Hamza's to clear away at a blow the tangled undergrowth of the dual Kingdom and set about building a tidier and more critic-proof edifice of State. 6. ' Union Day'—' Id-at-Tauhfd,' as it is already called—was celebrated on the 22nd September with parades of yelling schoolboys and a reception by the Amir of Jedda of the foreign representatives. At Mecca the Viceroy publielV thanked the population for their zeal and sincerity, and he came the next day to Jedda, where the foreign representatives and local notables were invited to meet him at tea. I confined myself to requesting him to convey my personal respects to His Majesty. I have, &amp;c. C. G.

IN my telegrams Nos. 175 and 176 of the 12th September, I reported that the Hejazi authorities had requested me to return to them a slave who had taken refuge in this Legation from the household of the King's brother, the Amir Muhammad. I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a manuscript letter from Sheikh Ali Taha conveying the message from Fuad Hamza in which this request was made. 2. On receipt of your telegram No. 117 of the 15th September, I decided to use the same channel and an even more non-committal method of reply, in order to give Fuad Hamza every opportunity to side-step from his position rather than to dig himself in, but without failing to make him realise what he was up against. The King and the Amir, of course, had left for Riyadh a few days previously. I accordingly instructed Mr. Wikeley to have the attached message to Fuad Hamza read verbatim in Arabic to Sheikh Ali Taha, who took it all down. 3. Having heard nothing further, I caused the sheikh to be reminded on the 20th September that I was expecting to be able to embark the man on the 25th September. On the 21st September Sheikh Ali Taha himself rang me up to say that there was no objection to his embarkation. This he confirmed orally to Mr. Wikeley, who took the slave on board the steamship &lt;£ Talodi' on the 25th September, after receiving a further assurance from Ali Taha that the port authorities had received the necessary instructions to allow him to pass. Another slave who had taken refuge on the 18th September was embarked at the same time. 4. I am not yet in a position to say what passed behind the scenes in prelude to this happy denouement. Much must have depended upon whether the categorical wording of the Hejazi note of the 18th January last and of Fuad Hamza's letter of the following day was Fuad Hamza's own or whether it came straight from the horse's mouth. If the former, the Under-Secretary must have exerted himself with Riyadh on behalf of almost as restrictive an interpretation of the ' Clayton undertaking ' as we might ourselves be supposed to hold; if the latter, Ibn Sand must have impressed just such a restrictive interpretation on his brother Muhammad. Whatever the process, the result betrays an appreciable approach of the Hejazi view-point to our own, and should serve still further to simplify this legation's practical task in repatriating slaves who seek refuge. Such cases will nevertheless take delayed effect when the Treaty of Jedda is reviewed by Ibn Saud a little before the 17th March, 1934, less than a year and a half hence. I have, &amp;c. C. G.

He stated that it would no doubt be within my recollection that his predecessor, Ferit Bey, had raised early this year the desirability of our Govern ments exchanging any information of common interest about the Hejaz-Nejd which might reach either Government. (This proposal was recorded in my despatch No. 82 of the 1st March to Mr. Morgan.) 2. Munir Bey was accordingly authorised to inform me that the Emir Feisal of the Hejaz-Nejd, when he visited Angora in June last, had placed an order for 100 rifles of Turkish make and two mitrailleuses, which were to be delivered to his father. King Abdul Aziz (Ibn Saud), by two Turkish officers, who were about to proceed to the Hejaz to inspect and repair some old cannons dating from the time when the Imperial Ottoman Government ruled over the Hejaz. In reply to an enquiry on my part, whether there was any question of the supply of ammunition, his Excellency replied in the negative. 3. Munir Bey then said that on the 9th May last a Turk, called Mesout, whose name appears on the list of 150 people whose entry into Turkey is forbidden, had made opprobrious remarks about the Ghazi in one of the restaurants at Nicosia in Cyprus. Eepresentations which had been made by the Turkish consul to the local authorities had met with no success. His Excellency therefore appealed to me to take such steps as might be possible. I explained to him the inherent difficulties in a case of this nature, and added that if he would supply my department with further details, the matter would be considered; but I held out little or no hope of being able to give his Government satisfaction in this particular matter.

I HAVE the honour to report that the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, irza Mohammed Ali Khan Feroughi, arrived in Constantinople by Simplon- -ient Express on the 26th October, and left the same day for Angora, where he .11 stay until the 2nd November. During his stay he will be the guest of the irkish Government, and will assist at the ceremonies given in connexion with e anniversary of the proclamation of the Turkish Republic. 2. Feroughi Khan is accompanied by Abbas Guli Khan Garib, Musa Khan fendiyari, Hasan Khan Kayat, ex-Under-Secretary of State at the Persian inistry of Economy, Gulam Eiza Khan, head of the Eastern Department of the jrsian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and Colonels Muhsin Khan and ehmet Khan Diba. 3. At Constantinople Feroughi Khan informed the representative of the Hakimiyeti Milliye ' r that the purpose of his visit to Turkey was to return the sit paid to Tehran in January of this year by Tevfik Eu§tu Bey- He added that [ questions of major importance between the two countries had been settled, mversations would take place about economic matters and about a projected mmercial treaty. He also hoped to renew a Treaty of Neutrality, Non- jgression, and Collaboration. Falih Eifki Bey, in a leader in the &lt;c Hakimiyeti illiye ' welcoming Feroughi Khan, attributes the improvement in the relations tween Turkey and Persia to the establishment of a new regime in each country, ^publican Turkey adopted the policy of peace and friendship with neighbouring ates, and Feroughi Khan, who as Ambassador at Angora had been able to nvince himself of the sincerity of Turkey's policy, had played his part in plaining Turkey's aims to his Shah and in bringing the countries together. 4. It is an interesting commentary on Persian mentality, as revealed by r. Hoare s despatches, to note that, in the course of an interview given to the Republique ' by Feroughi Khan, at which the Persian Ambassador was present, e latter interrupted an historical retrospect of the quarrels between the two untries, alleged to be due to the sinister influence exercised by Sultans and lahs, to call all to witness that foreign countries especially had profited by these tarrels, and to declare that in future the friendship existing between the two ster nations, each of which had wxm its national independence, would be proof jamst every external assault. 5 At a banquet given in honour of Feroughi Khan on the 27th October, rdial speeches were made by him and by Tevfik Ru§tu Bey, attributing Turco- 3rsian friendship to the bonds of mutual interest and to the efforts of the rulers the countries who brought about the Treaty of Neutrality and Friendship of e 22nd April, 1926, which opened a new era in Turco-Persian relations fruitful agreements and understandings. 6 I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's Minister Tehran.

We did not touch upon the actual change of the ountry's title to 'Saudi Arabia,' but Fuad Bey offered a few remarks on the uture Constitution. 2. He thought that the council had two years' work ahead of it to draw up new Constitution and to replace all the old legislation with modern laws. He fas going to advocate a kind of 'States-General,' to be summoned annually by he King from among the leading men of the country. After discussion of past xperience and future policy, this body would annually leave an Executive Jommittee to carry on the work of legislation and government. He considered bat the post of Viceroy should be replaced by that of Prime Minister. The hari a would be maintained as the common law of the country. cu hange • ^ 3. As regards succession to the throne, Fuad Bey declared that the King ad already made it known that his eldest son should succeed him. The Council f Ministers would simply give formal and constitutional shape to this decision. I have, &amp;c. C. HOPE GILL. [627 x—2] vI'l' 1 I REt-OBNCY. EASTEEJST (Arabia). i On t. November 25, 1932.

THE manager of the local ' Dutch Bank,' a branch of the Handel Maatschappij of Amsterdam, has imparted the following items of financial interest:— 2. During the months of May, June, July and August his office was busily employed in selling to about a dozen of the smaller merchants of Jedda and Mecca, against, gold, drafts on Bombay, Cairo and London. They amounted, in round figures, to £150,000 sterling, and were divided about equally between those three markets. Mr. Jacobs was of the opinion that the drafts on Bombay were required to finance purchases of rice and other comestibles in time for the coming pilgrimage season, that those on London were mainly for the purchase of cotton goods, and that those on Cairo were connected with gambling on the gold exchange. He made a point of stating that these figures excluded the business preparations made by the really big local firms, such as Haji Abdullah 'Ali Ridha's, who conduct their own banking business. Nor, he thought, did they include savings of the more fortunate Government servants placed abroad for greater safety. 3. If Mr. Jacobs's figures are approximately correct, as I take them to be, they show that there was evidently still plenty of money in private hands; at the same time they betray an implicit faith in the size of the next pilgrimage, which seems only too likely to have been misplaced. A couple of months ago the bazaar gossip placed the coming Javanese pilgrimage with confidence at 40,000. Last season it was 4,500. Next season, according to the shipping company, which has reason to know best, it will be 1,500. Stocks are now heavy, and unless other countries send unsuspected quantities of pilgrims, it will be very difficult to get rid of the accumulation. 4. Mr. Jacobs was very despondent about Saudi Government finance. During next month, he said. Government commitments mature to the tune of £40,000 gold. He will have to handle these debts, but sees no hope of obtaining payment. On the contrary, he foresees trouble and complications arising from the fact that the greater portion of them has been discounted and re-discounted in Europe. This, I understand, to be the case with £15,000 owing to the Standard Oil Company through Messrs. Sharqieh (Limited), and £10,000 to German firms represented by M. de Haas, the German consul; these are Mr. Jacobs's figures. The other £15,000 are owing to the Marconi Company, also through Messrs. Sharqieh. Apart from these, Mr. Jacobs is aware of £5,000 gold owing to his own firm, £15,000 to the Shell Company, through Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., £25,000 to the Qusaibis, and £30,000 to the Soviets for oil—a total external indebtedness, according to Mr. Jacobs, of £115,000 gold. To this figure we can add £10,000 owing to the Government of India, £2,500 to the Eastern Telegraph Company, and £1,700 to His Majesty's Government—a minimum grand total of some £125,000 gold. 5. Mr. Jacobs is convinced that there is no money left in the Treasury, the recent rebellion having cost Ibn Saud at least £40,000, he thinks, and used up his reserves. The Saudi Government have nevertheless recently scraped together the following sums for export: £1,500 and £1,300 for an Isotto-Eraschini car apiece for the King and the Viceroy, and a few hundred pounds to induce M. van Leeuwen to return from sick leave to his unfinished duties of financial adviser. 6.

It will no doubt be published m the Mecca press. ?' i^ l rec ^? ^he steps by which the entire administration of Asir was eventually handed over by the Idrisi to Ibn Saud in 1930, affirms that since then peace and prosperity have reigned, but admits that friction has recently been caused between the Idrisi and Ibn Saud's Amir or Governor. The friction is stated to be purely personal, however, but so intense as to have caused the Idrisi to appeal to Ibn Saud, with protests of loyalty, to change his Amir. The memorandum concludes with the information that a committee of enquiry has been ordered, and by expressing the hope that there will be no need for militarv operations. J - p , ^ ner ^ main ^ahya nor armed and moneyed Hejazi conspirators ot the Dabbagh gang are behind the Idrisi, these hopes may well be -justified for strong Saudi reinforcements have been despatched by sea and from the interior. S e r^ r ? er T are stanc ^ n S b y at Qunfida by Ibn Saud's orders, the latter, under Unalid-bm-Luwey, are further inland, while the committee of investigation comprismg Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman's brother Hamid and the Tripolitan Khalid-al-Qarqani, are approaching Jizan. The garrison of this place, under Ibn baud s Amir, is thought to have now surrendered to the Idrisi after being besieged, waterless, in the old Turkish fort which overlooks the town, but their wireless station has apparently been damaged and the Government have no certain news of them. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the Chief Commissioner at Aden and the Acting Commissioner at Port Sudan. I have, &amp;c. C. G. HOPE GILL. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum. (Translation.) is known that in accordance with correspondence, decisions and discus sions exchanged in the month of Jumad-ath-Thani, 1349, between Sayyid-al- Hasan-al-Idrisi and the Legislative Assembly of the Idrisi Province on the one side and the Government of His Majesty the King on the other, Sayyid Hasan and his Legislative Assembly ceded the administration of the country, as was recorded in the Treaty of Protection concluded at Mecca oh the 14th Eabi-ath- Ihani, 1345 (the 21st October, 1926). His Majesty accepted this cession in accordance with the gracious Royal decree issued on the 29th Jumad-ath-Thani, 1349 (the 21st November, 1930), in which the nature of the administration, duties and authority of Sayyid-al-Hasan, the Legislative Assembly, the Amir of the territory and the director of its finance are defined. The new arrangement started to function as from that date. 2. During the period since the new arrangement came into force nothing 0&lt; n C t0 - entan ^ e ^e procedure of administrative and financial affairs, and all have enjoyed the prosperity, peace and good arrangement that took the place [655 g-1]of the old anarchy. No complaint was made against the dispositions of the Amirs and officials who, in accordance with the Royal instructions, have had all possible regard for the position and honour of Sayyid-al-Hasan. It appears that personal friction has come between Sayyid-al-Hasan and the present Amir, Fahd-bin- Zuair, caused, according to the allegations of the former, by the fact that the latter thinks little of him, and does not appear before him with due respect'nor dutiful to his person and position. 3. It seems that some who have selfish objects and wish to fish in troubled waters took occasion of this personal friction to intrigue between Sayyid-al- Hasan and the Amir, that both of them, according to the documents which it has hitherto been possible to obtain, now regard each other with very different eyes, and that the Amir has tried to interfere with Sayyid-al-Hasan in matters not mentioned in the text of his instructions. The Sayyid has protested and complained of the Amir's ill will towards him in the following matters - -Ill-treatment by the Amir, in that the Amir does not show the respect due to his position, and that he does not speak politely to him. Second. —That the Amir places obstacles in the way of the regular payment of Sayyid-al-Hasan's allowances, and that he does not help him when he complains. Third. —-That the Amir opposes his meeting certain tribesmen who belong to him. Fourth. —That the Amir forbade mention of the name of Sayyid-al- Hasan in the Friday prayer. Fifth.—Th&amp;t the Amir prevents the Sayyid from flying his private flag. Sixth. —That he refuses to consider the question of reducing customs dues in the port of Jizan in response to the general financial crisis. 4. The Government of His Majesty the King being desirous to put things right before harm is spread and before rogues blow the fire of insurrection, have thought it best to be ready for emergency, and to place at the disposal of the authorities in that locality the military forces required to keep peace and restore order if necessary, pending the completion of close enquiries into the complaints referred to above. It now seems to them that they need not be worried, and that the matter is much simpler than they first thought. 5. Sayyid-al-Hasan-al-Idrisi telegraphed to His Majesty the King on Friday last to confirm his loyalty and that of all inhabitants of his territory, and to say that the matter is only a personal one with the Amir and his attitude, that none has ever dreamt or thought of making a disloyal movement or rebelling against the present jurisdiction or separating from the body of this kingdom. He urgently requested His Majesty to depute a new Amir, upon whose arrival everything would be restored to order. Orders have been issued for a reliable body to investigate the matter thoroughly. The Government of His Majesty the King hope that there will be not the slightest need for military operations or the like.

There is also more than meets the eye in the liquidation of drafts on customs. Large numbers of these are extant, and those which have been issued to Government employees in lieu of arrears of salary (see Sir Andrew Ryan's despatch No. 298 of the 12th July) are now changing hands at 30 per cent, of their face value. A month ago they stood on the market at 34 per cent. 8. The whole financial position is so unsatisfactory, and any explanation of obscurities, where all is obscure, would be of so little avail, even if it were forthcoming, that I have not thought it worth while to question the Saudi Arab Government on these and other points. The moment, moreover, is not propitious, with the rebellion in Asir in full swing. Should Sir Andrew Ryan not already have your instructions as to the treatment of these questions of Government indebtedness when he returns next month, I have the honour to enquire what action you would wish taken, in view of the enclosed memorandum, in regard to both the capital sums outstanding and the interest now offered. 9. I should add that the Dutch financial adviser returned to Jedda on the 6th November. He was not consulted in any particular regarding this memorandum, which was, in fact, issued a few days prior to his return, and has not yet been communicated to him by the Finance Ministry. 10. I am sending a copy of this despatch and enclosure to his Excellency the Viceroy of India. I have, &amp;c. C. G. HOPE GILL. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum. (Translation.) THE Government of His Majesty the King have taken great care concerning the debts due by them, and His Majesty the King and his Government have paid special attention to a search for the best means for reaching a settlement of the question of these debts in a manner which meets both the ability of the Treasury to pay and the confidence of creditors. As a result of careful search made last year, His Majesty the King was pleased to issue orders for a precise arrangement to be made in regard to the Government Treasury, causing the estimated income to be divided into different parts, of which one part was assigned for the reim bursement and settlement of these debts. 2. It is not unknown that the fact which caused the Government to adopt this procedure was the financial strain prevailing all over the world and the shortage oi revenue of all Governments, caused by the irresistible crisis which entangled economic affairs and confused and paralysed financial matters. There is no need to give proof of what the Governments of the world have suffered in general as a result of this dreadful crisis, as this is known to everybody. When the Govern ment made their decision last year, namely, to postpone the settlement of debts tor one year, ending the 10th of the month of November, 1932, they took the most nopeiul view of the matter and felt optimistic that the beginning of the end of the crisis was coming, that the estimate made by the Government for their annual budget might be realised in full and the Government would thus be able to settle all claims due by their Treasury; but unfortunately the situation did not improve during last year and Governments and nations continued to suffer from the strain, anxiety and confusion m financial and economic affairs It has become the duty of tne Ireasury m every kingdom to take new effective measures for fighting the crisis and parrying its dangers on the one hand, and for meeting the claims of creditors on the other. &amp; ^ ^ Treasury, in dealing with creditors, has followed a course in which the necessities of the economic situation were taken into consideration. It was based on hel pin g any creditors who might choose to have the debt due to them quidated by means of deductions to be allowed from the original amounts of ^nf S P aya { ) j e 0I ! ^ oods ^ported into the country. Although we admit that this method could not be made applicable to all cases of creditors the Government3 fep J found it inevitable to follow this method. It was eventually established that the method was not a bad one, and that it helped not a small number of creditors to ! 1! have the whole or part of their debts reimbursed. lJ ; 4. When the final account was made up after eleven months of the arrange- 3 ment introduced by Royal order regarding the division of the estimated Treasury lllt ! revenues, it was found that most of the item debts chest, mentioned therein (as ^ deriving) from the capital value of the estimated revenues, had been discharged . in meeting the drafts on customs which had been given to creditors. That item | 3S slightly exceeded 14 million miri piastres, and in view of the falling values of M silver coin the net gold value of the item debts diminished by 50 per cent, of its * value estimated in the budget. This item equalled the amounts appropriated to P 10 !; creditors by the drafts on customs. 5. When the Government found that they would not be able to settle all debts N due from them, as had been expected, they made all possible endeavour to obtain W such amount as would suffice for the payment of their debts, but they have not 11 ^ succeeded in finding the desired solution. The Government was therefore bound to advise creditors before the time fixed for payment of the fact that it was beyond 4|| the ability of the Government to pay the amounts which were expected to be paid out of revenue, and in view of this fact they wish to explain the matter to those NUl whom it concerns, showing, meanwhile, the precautions which were taken to avoid this state of affairs, but which have failed. 6. As a result of their endeavours, the Government have succeeded in obtaining a sum which enables them to pay 5 per cent, in respect of profit (interest) for last year only; this sum is ready on demand and will be paid to those concerned M shortly. It is hoped that the Government will succeed during next year in settling the whole, or the greater part, of these debts, subject, as mentioned above, to the state of the revenues improving generally. 7. In conclusion, the Government of His Majesty wish to express their regret for being obliged to follow this course, which they would have preferred to avoid, following another had there been no such general distress, and they trust that creditors will remain confident of their definite intention to take every action that may lead to the complete settlement of these debts. They assure them f of their true desire to do so. (Seal) Ministry for Foreign Affairs.I Bb.ff. 324-jJ/38.

(No. 480.) Sir, Jedda, December 17, 1932. WITH reference to my telegram INio. 220 of the 1st December regarding the rebellion in Asir, I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a lengthy extract from the Umm-al-Qura of the 2nd December entitled ' The Jizan Affair ' and of a short communique published in the same paper's issue of the 9th December under the heading ' News of Events at Jizan. 'Q These documents bring up to date the history of the Asir revolt as seen from the point of view of Saudi publicity. But there is a mass of fact and motive behind them which is at present hidden. Some I have been able to gather from other sources; the rest can only be conjectured. The present is a suitable moment to attempt an interim survey. 2. The Province of Asir has for some years been commonly regarded as a likely source of trouble for Ibn Saud, but generally in connexion with the Yemen and the steps which the Imam Yahya might be expected to take to recover a territory which some have supposed to have been filched from him. Trouble has but seldom been foreseen in connexion with the tribes of Asir itself and never yet in connexion with the attitude of its present ruler, the Idrisi. He and his tribesmen could have been likened to fat trout in a pool, lorded over by a not-too-voracious pike, but both watched by a hungry old pike No. 2 lying in the border reeds. 3. The expected has not yet happened and, as far as I at present know (though there are increasing rumours to the contrary), pike No. 2 is still motionless. It is the trout who are up in arms and pike No. 1 is busy trying to eat them up. It is difficult to say just what roused them. Asir is a relatively thickly populated country (say, 1 million) and moderately rich in agriculture, lying as it does in the northern fringe of Arabia Felix. It has been the fashion in the Hejaz, and even amongst its more disgruntled inhabitants, impatient of Saudi rule, to regard Asir as happy and prosperous under that rule. It is unlikely that crops have failed and that depression has made its people discontented. All reports point to the contrary, while it must be said in favour of the Saudi regime that its hand has always been understood to lie lightly on the people of Asir. Whether the Saudi treatment of the Idrisi himself has been as politic now seems more than doubtful. When Fuad Bey Hamaz handed me his memorandum on the 16th November, he made a rather laboured point of informing me that the six points of disagreement which the Idrisi alleged to have arisen between himself and Ibn Saud's Governor had originated in lacunae in the latter's instructions which he had tactlessly sought himself to fill. As these points of complaint included lack of due respect to the Idrisi, non-payment of his allowances, surveillance of his visitors, omission of his name from the Friday prayer and prevention from flying his flag,' there is reason to disbelieve Fuad Bey's statement. My impression is that of late there has been a deliberate policy to undermine the Idrisi's status. My conjecture is that it dated from the proclamation of the unity of Hejaz and Nejd and its Dependencies as ' Saudi Arabia,' from the thousand and one petitions for which the Idrisi was a noticeable abstainer; and so with the Asiri tribesmen. One of the objects of this change of title was no doubt to consolidate the Province or Protectorate of Asir as a part and parcel of the United Saudi Kingdom. It is very possible that the Idrisi and his subjects saw this and abstained from all participation from a feeling of resentment. A general tightening up of Saudi control would be the natural result. 4. Whatever the background of revolt, there seems little doubt that the Dabbagh conspiracy, which has a hand in it, only began to m^ke headway in Asir [683 d—21 f 1 ) Not printed.in about September last, having either completely failed to make headway earlier in the year, or having been forestalled and thrown out of gear by the untimely opening of the Ibn Rifada show. I lean to the former view, supposing that had they made any headway they might well have expedited their programme during the two months for which Ibn Rifada lasted, but that internal conditions in Asir were not sufficiently favourable then. However that may be, it is clear from the various sources of information that the Dabbagh branch of the Hejazi Liberal party has had a considerable hand in the present revolt. It may have been the prime mover, but it is more likely only to have supplied opportune assistants who were in a position to introduce a certain directive force, a few arms and a little money (though it is said that Asir has no need of arms), the promise of much more and encouragement to look for moral support and perhaps future freedom from the Amir Abdullah; whether or not his name was taken in vain there is no present means of judging. But it is to be noted that the Imam Yahya has, so far, either had nothing to do with this revolt or has hidden his tracks very cleverly. I suspect, the latter. 5. Turning to the attached papers, which are chiefly interesting for the light they throw on Saudi methods and mentality, one finds that in the ' Introduction,' pp. 1 and 2, the. writer (who may be Sheikh Yussuf Yasin) is at pains to convince that any revolt against Ibn Saud is a revolt against Islam and the Arabs, but he was premature in stating that the Idrisi had already come to his due end of cc destruction and annihilation.' In the 'Beginning of the Affair,' pp. 3 and 4, he stresses ad nauseam Ibn Saud's magnificent patience, which might, however, from the evidence here given, be more properly qualified as criminal negligence, a point to which I will recur later. Passing over for the purposes of this despatch the writer's account of the ' Conspirators' Objects and Plan,' pp. 4 to 6, we find at the bottom of p. 6 what was apparently the Saudi Governor's first note of warning of trouble in Asir in a telegram to Ibn Saud dated the 26th September. He makes here the only unfriendly reference to the Imam Yahya which is made throughout the exchanges of telegrams which now follow, reporting that he was said to be mobilising troops to send either against Jizan or the Beni Hasan (one of his own tribes). ' (But the Imam seems to have been always mobilising troops these past three years; to have kept people guessing.) The Governor is also suspicious of a change of heart in the Idrisi, since before the Ibn Rifada rebellion,' but this last may be an editorial interpellation; the whole series of telegrams shows, to my mind, signs of having been heavily edited for publicity. Ibn Saud's reply of the 29th September, for instance, on p. 7, is much too good to be true. Down to ' so I ask you to be kind &lt;ind gentle to the Idrisi was almost certainly written ex 'post facto, but the final If he has evil intention, God will cause him to be defeated, while if what is said is false, it is in the nature of most rumour ' rings true. 6. For a month after this,exchange of warning and precept there seems to have been no further cause for alarm, so far as can be judged from the one-sided evidence here given, but on the 27th October began a rapid exchange of telegrams, pp. 8 to 13, comprising increasingly serious reports from Saudi officials at Jizan, wnicn end on the 5th November with the words '' we have enough water for some days and upon God we rely,' when they were besieged, and uniformly placid Saud, of which that of the 1st November is typical* ' £ Accept the Idrisi s apologies and show him the greatest respect. Facts must become known Be very careful to show him respect and regard.' (On the 6th Jizan capitulated to the Idrisi). It is difficult to understand Ibn Saud's attitude, unless it was due to extreme caution bred of fear that anv warlike preparation on his part might bring the Imam openly into the field against him. His telegrams as published show him to have been pacifist to a degree which allowed the initial stages of revolt to develop unchecked. If they Ire apocryphal, as seems probable, the fact remains that he appears to have taken no action to lorestall the trouble so clearly foreseen and reported by his officials. He had very few troops m Asir, it is true. About the 25th October his armoured car detach ment, which had been stationed m Asir since the Jabal Arwa trouble of last year, had actually returned to Mecca. If as much attention was not paid as prominence has been given to conspiratorial activities in Asir, Ibn Saud must be accounted either as a very negligent commander or as fearful of rousing the Imam or as mvitmg revolt for ulterior purposes of his ownIt r^i\i ® e f ore leaving the telegrams on pp. 7 to 13, two exchanged between Ibn ^ Saud and the Idnsi may be noted. The latter's, of the 28th October, is brief and asks why his nephew. Ah, had left Mecca. Ibn Sand's long reply of the : 29th October explains that Ali is a danger to his uncle and that therefore Ibn Saud was keeping him with him as one of his own sons and had taken him to 1 Riyadh. nJ ^ ^ was not un til the 5th November, the day Jizan was attacked, that the - mission, comprising Sheikh Hamad Suleiman, Under-Secretary of Finance, and Khalid Bey A1 Qarqani, a Tripolitan exile, who is anti-Italian and has long had friendly relations with the Idrisi, set out from Jedda to investigate the Idrisi's complaints, although it seems probable from internal evidence that these vaini! 'Co^plai^ts had been made to Ibn Saud some time previously. It was not T -- until the 6th November, the day Jizan fell, that the first reinforcements left for the south, by car by way of Jedda and the coast road. It is a bad track and some 450 miles to Jizan. At the same time Shereef Khalid-bin-Luwey set out srestiii- ^ rom Turaba for Abha, accompanied by a nephew of Ibn Saud, his sister's son, ds tfi'' ^'kdul Aziz-bin-Musaid, and collecting tribal contingents under their war . ft standards on his way to an estimated total of about 5,000 camelmen. He m apparently did not reach Abha until the 25th November, or even later. The crow-flight distance is 200 miles. About the 25th November a similar force left Riyadh under the Amir Khalid-bin-Muhammad, eldest son of Ibn Sand's elder % brother. From the 6th November to the end of the month some 2,000 reinforce ments continued to flow through Jedda, composed mostly of regular troops from the town garrisons, but with some street-loafer mercenaries too, and accompanied by several hundred lorry-loads of arms and ammunition. Some of the earlier Mjt contingents went by dhows and two Government launches, and one of the last by a specially-chartered German ship, which spent ten days for its pains on a reef imtoi off Jizan. On the 17th November the coastal corps retook Jizan, also Sabya. On the refer® 23rd, there seems to have been a general counter-attack by the rebels, of the results Wfi of which reports are still very contradictory. The revolt, meanwhile, seems to have ieitkf become widespread and general, and the Saudi columns have made very slow, if Hseeit any, progress. The last communique, dated the 9th December and attached at p. 22, ve kept | stated that the column ' charged with the liquidation of any vestige of insur- ftitli rection in the coastal region of Asir ' was then at full strength and at Jirzan and Sabya; there are, I think, no more regular troops that can be spared, the last contingent of all which passed through Jedda in early December having been composed of tribesmen from Nejd. The communique placed Shereef Khalid-bin- Luwey still at Abha and stated that letters had been sent to all the tribes and the ^butl Wrisi himself, inviting them to surrender within six days. In spite, therefore, 0 t tenor of the telegrams exchanged between Ibn Saud and the Idrisi and given on pp. 14 to 17, the latter had consistently been deceiving Ibn Saud, had ma( * e his hay while the sun shone, and was still at large. The communique made Aitlief 110 m ention of the force from Riyadh under the Amir Khalid-bin-Muhammad. 2e of fell Such information as I have regarding it is non-official, though reasonably reliable, ly-; 1 am inclined to think that it may be the nucleus of a much larger Nejdi force watert d^tined to strike at Sana from the east if and when the Imam Yahya shows his .|o^ : hand. . i, : 9. The last point to which I would draw attention in this despatch is the Luiirf cur ^ ous exchange of telegrams between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya, repro duced on pp. 18 and 19. The Imam's telegram of the 15th November was either very corruptly received or has been rewritten for publication, for its Arabic is poor and ungrammatical and is well below his normal standard. The Imam tells Ibn Sand that the Saudi Governor of Jizan had taken refuge at Midi, whence he had given orders that he should be driven out. The next issue of the Umm-al- Qura tries to put things right by explaining that the telegram was corrupt and that what the Imam had really said was that the Idrisi had taken refuge at Midi, and that he (the Imam) had given orders that the Saudi Amir should, if possible, be released; which explanation holds no water, for Jizan was not retaken until two days after the Imam sent his telegram, if its date is correctly given, both it and the Saudi Amir being still in the Idrisi's hands. Be that as it may, the s not Imam goes on to preach patience to Ibn Saud reminding him that haste is of the 3 Sp &lt;levil, and warning him against the ' deceits of foreigners,' with special mention 0 f lit of the fate of four places which the French now hold, Fez, Tunis, Algiers and aud's ^ kff inst I®,4 Syria, and of one in the Yemen which Aelius Gallus took in the days of Caesar ^ Augustus; so tactful is the old Imam and so careful to avoid direct reference to' - the English and the modern Italians If his telegram is a masterpiece, so also is Ibn Saud's reply, sent after the retaking of Jizan. He equally tactfully' reminds the Iman that it was the Idrisi who, in the first instance, sought his, Ibn Saud's, protection, that Asir, in fact, is a Saudi protectorate, and that his concentration of forces is purely precautionary, for use against just such foreign interference, in fact, as that to which his brother had referred. It cannot be n seriously thought that these two rulers really fear a British or Italian landing. ' They use this fantasy as a comely veil to their rival skirmishes for position. It may be taken for granted that they are watching each other very carefully. A false move on either side might lead to war. j{8i 10.

Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received January 18, 1933.) (No. 487.) HIS Majesty's Minister at Jedda presents his compliments to His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit to him copy of his minute of the 26th instant respecting a conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza on the subject of the rebellion in Asir. Jedda, December 29, 1932. Enclosure in No. 1. Minute by Sir A. Ryan. FUAD BEY HAMZA called this morning for the first time since my return. After politesses of some length, 1 asked about the news from Asir. He said that all was well north of a line inland from Madhaya, a small port some 25 kilom. south of Jizan. It had been necessary to administer punishment to the Njua tribe (presumably the Naj'u described in Handbook of Arabia, I, 441), some hundreds of whom had been killed. I understood Fuad to be confirming what Hafiz Wahba had told me on the 23rd December, namely, that the troops had reached Sabya after fighting. These are the troops of Khalid-bin-Luwey's column, but Fuad said that Khalid himself had died (of illness, he said) on the march from Abha. Fuad said that the country from the above line southward to the frontier had still to be pacified owing to the uncertain activities of the Masariha and other tribes in the Abu Aris region. Hasan-al-Idrisi was with the Masariha. On my mentioning Ibn Musa'ad, he said that he was still at Abha. He was to be appointed Governor-General of the whole area and would be replaced in the Governorate of Hail, which was at present held by an acting man. 2. Fuad said that he had never attached any importance to the Asir rebellion, which would simply end in the death of several hundred tribesmen and the widowhood of as many women, but he wished to speak of another aspect which might be of more interest to me, viz., the attitude of the Italians, with whom His Majesty's Government had an understanding about Arabia. He said that on Wednesday, the 21st December last, an Italian sloop, the name of which he could not give, had put in at Jizan without previous notice of any kind. After some hesitation over the establishment of contact in those conditions, the local Governor had seen the commander and had pointed out to him the impropriety of the visit. On this the sloop left on Thursday afternoon, but only to go into other territorial waters, those of the Farsan islands, and thence to a small island off Madhaya, where it spent the night. Next day, Friday, the 23rd, she visited Madhaya twice at an interval of some hours. The Saudi Government regarded their proceedings as a gross breach of international practice and had taken the matter up strongly with the Italian Minister here, who was in communication with Eome. Signor de Peppo had expressed the view that the proceedings of the sloop had not taken place under authority from his Government. If this proved to be the case, it would diminish without destroying the importance of the affair. Fuad said that he had the King's instructions to communicate the facts to me. I said I would note them and convey the communication to His Majesty's Government, but could not comment on the action of friendly foreign authorities. 3. Fuad Bey spoke at some length of other external activities behind the Asir affair and. replying to a question by me, said that they were an important factor in it. He did not openly accuse the Italians of complicity, but what he [683 s—1] EASTERN (A rabia). CONFIDENTIAL. [E 361/2/25]2 said was obviously directed against them to a large extent. He spoke, inter alia, of the role of Seyyid Marghani-al-Idrisi, who had been an Italian agent in the past, had helped the Saudi Government in framing up the treaty with Asir in 1926, and had subsequently reverted to his role of Italian agent. He spoke in the same connexion of the Ad Dabbagh machinations, and mentioned various people whose names are familiar to us, including that of Abdurrauf-as-Sabban, who had attended a meeting of the principal conspirators at Amman last May, and Muhammad Amin-ash-Shanqiti, who he told me was a man of Moorish origin, formerly resident at Mecca. 4. I told Fuad Bey that I had been concerned about the activities of the Ad Dabbaghs since early in the year, when Sheikh Yusuf Yasin had first spoken to me about the procedings of Husein-ad-Dabbagh. At that time it was only a question of publications, and I had made reservations regarding the invocation by Sheikh Yusuf of article 2 of the Treaty of Jedda, but had taken the matter up with Aden. It had been discovered that the Ad Dabbaghs were in fact engaged in subversive schemes and, as he already knew, action had been taken to eliminate them from Aden. I understood also, I said, though I could make no official communication, that Abdurrauf-as-Sabban, who seemed to have been in communication with the conspirators, had been dismissed from his post in Trans- j or dan. Having just come from London, I said, I wished to assure Fuad Bey, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the King that there was no change in the policy of His Majesty's Government, which was to prevent, as far as they were concerned, any use of their territory as a base of hostile activities. I mentioned, as a further instance, that I had taken advantage of my recent visit to the Sudan to assure myself that the conspirators were not making use of that country. 1 repeated that Fuad Bey would not expect me to offer my comments on anything he had said about the Italians. As for myself, my principal interest in the matter was a desire that nothing should stand in the way of the object that he and I had at heart, namely, the establishment of a sounder position between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan. I was anxious that the situation should not be clouded by an c&lt; atmosphere of suspicion,' stressing this phrase as meaning that I was not prepared to endorse the Saudi view that there were grounds for more than suspicion, but that the mere existence of such an atmosphere was detrimental to the purpose which His Majesty's Government were pursuing steadfastly, even though recent events might complicate matters. 5. Fuad Bey said he had arranged to return to Mecca in the afternoon, but hoped to return to Jedda early in Eamadan. I said that I was glad to have had a general discussion with him, but that I had not yet had time to study all my files, and that I also wished to consult His Majesty's Government on one or two points. It would suit me very well, I said, to continue our conversation any time after the 1st January. A. R.

IN his telegram No. 2, Saving, of the 24th February, Mr. Hope Gill reported briefly on an alleged commercial understanding arrived at between the Saudi Government and the Soviet during my recent absence from Jedda. So much secrecy has been observed regarding the negotiations, that I can add little at present to the telegraphic report as regards the actual facts. The following particulars are, however, worth recording :— 2. There were two main factors in the position between Ibn Saud and Soviet Eussia last year, as follows :— {a) The Russians had supplied in the latter part of 1931 benzine and petroleum to the value of some £30,000 and had received no payment. (&amp;) It was understood in the spring and early summer of 1932 that the Russian Minister was endeavouring to negotiate a general agreement with the Soviet Government which at that time seemed to turn on the possibility of the Soviet accommodating Ibn Saud with goods rather than money, in return for a removal of the embargo on direct Russian imports into the Hejaz, which, though it had become to some extent ineffective, still greatly hampered Russian trade. I would refer more particularly to the correspondence ending with my printed despatch No. 255 of the 20th June last. 3. The negotiations conducted by M. Turacoulov last year seem to have produced no result. He brought off the deal reported by Mr. Hope Gill, using as a lever the claim at (a) in the previous paragraph. It is affirmed that the Soviet Minister has secured a partial or total removal of the embargo, in return for an arrangement whereby the old debt to his Government will be met by a partial or total remission of the customs duty on the new goods to be imported. What is not clear is whether what is contemplated is a permanent removal of the embargo or only its removal to the extent of allowing the importation of a quantity of goods such that the agreed remission of duty will suffice to pay off the old debt. The new goods are apparently to be sold on the market, but nothing has been revealed as to the selling machinery to be set up. There is a conflict of information as to whether the Saudi Government have made any preliminary arrangements with their own merchants. According to one account, a deputation of Jedda merchants were consulted during a recent visit to Mecca. According to another version, rather better supported, they were summoned to Mecca in connexion with the proposed national bank, on which I am reporting separately, and were left to discover from their own sources in Jedda how matters stood with the Soviet Legation. 4. Whatever the true facts and the dimension of the deal, it has already created a good deal of excitement in commercial circles here. It is understood that among the goods to be imported from Russia are flour and sugar, the intro duction of which into the market will hit trade with other countries, including Australia, which has of late been an important supplier of flour, and India, which has done an important, though latterly declining, general trade with the Hejaz. I hear no definite mention of petroleum products in connexion with the arrange ment with Russia. It seems unlikely that they would be excluded, but the Saudi Government may be unwilling to commit themselves or their merchants to bringing more Russian benzine, &amp;c., at present, having regard to their position vis-a-vis of Shell and American interests. 5. It is worth noting that the Russian Minister's negotiations last year seemed to be conducted largely with the Minister of Finance, whereas the recent arrangement is said to have been made with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. [739 x—2]As you are aware, there is constant antagonism between the Minister of Finance and the two highest personages concerned with foreign affairs^ viz., the Amir Feisal and Fuad Bey Hamza. According to secret sources of information, there is some reason to think that the Minister of Finance may attempt to hamper the Russian trade by devious methods, but this can only be a matter of speculation at present. 6.

Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received March 21.) (No. 69. Very Confidential.) Sir, Jedda, February 28, 1933. WITH reference to my despatch No. 30 of the 21st January relative to the arrival in this country of Abdul Hamid Shedid, an agent of the ex-Khedive of Egypt, I have the honour to state that this gentleman appears to have made considerable progress with his negotiations with the Saudi Government, and is understood to be leaving Jedda to-morrow to report to Abbas Hilmi Pasha. 2. I am credibly informed that an agreement has been reached, ad referendum, in the case of the ex-Khedive's representative, and, perhaps, in that of the Saudi negotiators also, for the creation of a national bank here with a capital of £1 million gold. It is stated that the ex-Khedive will provide half this amount, that the Saudi Government will be technically entitled to subscribe £250,000, and that the remainder will be offered for public subscription in the Hejaz. It is suggested that the Saudi Government will not, in fact, subscribe, and that the ex-Khedive has in view another source for the £250,000 which they are entitled to put up. It is further stated that the promoters will lend the Govern ment £200,000. The bank will operate as the State bank, receiving all revenue collected by the Government. It will be authorised to issue notes, but it is not clear that these notes will be brought into compulsory use at the outset. 3. I cannot discover what, if any, economic concessions have been promised to the ex-Khedive. It may be noted in this connexion that the Saudi Government appear to be in negotiation with other interests regarding concessions, notably for the exploitation of oil and gold. In these circumstances I am greatly at a loss to understand where Abbas Hilmi Pasha and his associates hope to make their profit. It has been suggested that, if they can get favourable terms regarding cover for note issue and succeed in bringing the issue into general use (which can hardly be done without making the notes the only legal currency in the near future), they may hope to draw substantial quantities of gold and silver out of the country. This might be a profitable once-for-all transaction, but it seems inadequate as a basis for permanent business. As for ordinary banking business, I imagine that it will be uphill work to develop it on a profitable scale, even with the support of the Government, in competition with the Netherlands Trading Society and Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., both of whom do regular banking and have extensive foreign connexions, as well as with the numerous local firms, who do banking of a sort on their own account as a side-line. 4. The enterprise looks on the face of it so dubious as finance that one is tempted to look for political motives on the part of the ex-Khedive. I confess that here again I am nonplussed. If, as some think, he aspires to the Throne of Syria, I cannot see that Ibn Saud's influence would be of much value to him. If, as others suggest, he aspires to the Caliphate, it would be to my mind impossible for Ibn Saud to associate himself with such a pretension. It is barely conceivable that the ex-Khedive may be counting on the decline of Ibn Saud and on being able to establish a 'cinch' on the Hejaz. I enumerate these possibilities or impossibilities merely in order to explore this aspect of the subject as fully as I can. When I was recently in Cairo I found Sir Percy Loraine distinctly sceptical about the political ambitions attributed in various quarters to Abbas Hilmi Pasha. 5. It is said that the promoters hope to rush the project through in time to start business on the 1st April, and to make something out of this year's pilgrimage. 6. I have based the foregoing summary on a mass of more detailed informa tion. As it is mostly derived from sources which I do not wish to compromise, I would ask you to regard the whole of this despatch as highly confidential. If the scheme materialises in the near future, it will have to be made public. [739 x—3]7 7. I may advert in this connexion to one matter on which I have too little information to make it the subject of a separate report. There has been much gossip of late about the possibility of the Nizam of Hyderabad coming to Ibn Sand's assistance in consideration of his being allowed to recondition the Prophet's Birthplace at Mecca. In my despatch under reference I mentioned the greater readiness of Abdul Hamid Shedid to talk to my French colleague about the Nizam than about his own business. It is conceivable that the ex-Khedive may hope to bring the Nizam into his combine (see the reference to &lt;c another source ' in paragraph 2 above), but this is a matter of pure speculation. The only facts I can adduce are that there appears to be increasing interest in the Hejaz in Hyderabadi circles, and that the interest of the Nizam in the Prophet's Birthplace is fairly well vouched for. There is, however, nothing in these facts in themselves to suggest the Nizam's possible participation in the ex-Khedive's scheme, rather than a separate deal between the Nizam and Ibn Sand. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade, to His Majesty's High Commissioners at Cairo and Jerusalem and to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. P.S.—Since I drafted the above, it has become doubtful whether Abdul Hamid Shadid will leave to-morrow. This is understood to be due not to any serious hitch, but to delay in receiving final advices from the Kinff, who is still at Riadh. ^ A.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 68 of February 28, I have the honour to state that the Mecca newspaper Umm-al-Qura of the 3rd March published the text of a decree of Ibn Saud, dated the 28th Shawwal, 1351 (the 24th February, 1933), sanctioning an agreement between the Minister of Finance and Dr. Jeelani regarding the concession for the proposed railway between Jedda and Mecca. The JJmm-al-Qura published also what purported to be a summary of the principal provisions of the agreement. I enclose an abridged version of this. 2. The Umm-al-Qura summary presents various peculiarities, which may, or may not, be peculiarities in the concession itself. There is no reference to a &lt;c cahier des charges,' except in so far as paragraph 12 may be supposed to fore shadow something of the sort later; nor is there any mention of two matters which must have been the subject of agreement, viz., the price of tickets and the division of receipts. No mention is made of the interest on the loan provided for at paragraph 8, which is apparently to be a charge on capital, but the parties may well be in agreement that none shall be paid for reasons of Islamic piety. 3. This report supersedes my previous account of the concession except as regards matters not mentioned in the enclosed summary. I have still to learn whether Dr. Jeelani has made definite arrangements in India. It has been suggested to me that the people described to me as the £C Hades Syndicate ' are merely those Indian Moslems who adhere to Wahhabi doctrine and call themselves Ahl-I-Hadith, to show that they rely only on the Traditions of the Prophet, as opposed to the teaching of the orthodox schools into which Sunni Moslems are divided. I have also again heard it suggested that the Nizam of Hyderabad is behind the railway scheme, but I still believe this to be false. 4.

J ^ irj 7 Jedda, March 3, 1933. ' WITH reference to Mr. Hope Gill's printed despatch No. 51 of the 15th February and previous correspondence relative to the relations between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya, I have the honour to forward translations of an article published in the Umm-al-Qura of the 17th February and an official communique published on the 24th February. 2. The first of these papers purports to describe the results achieved by the emissary sent by Ibn Saud to the Imam in November. It is pretty vague, but you ^ c will observe that the Imam is stated to have accepted '' four points '' stated by Ibn Saud, subject to additions of his own. I am not clear at the moment as to afc what past negotiations are referred to in the immediately preceding passage in which Sheikh Muhammad-bin-Dileym and Sheikh Madhi-bin-Turki are it mentioned. What is more important is the concluding statement that the Imam ' has asked for the despatch of accredited representatives to negotiate a definite liUKC SCll . agreement. 3. As Ibn Saud's emissary left Sana very early in January, the letter described in the Umm-ul-Qura of the 17th February must have been written some ? time before the escape of the Idrisi into the Yemen threatened a fresh strain on the relations between the two rulers. I reported by telegraph at the time my conversations with Fuad Bev Hamza on this subject on the 3rd and 9th February. The communique of the 24th February, which I now forward, confirms m an ' i[l1 amplified form what Fuad Bey told me on the second of these dates. It states inter alia that , the King has promised amnesty not only to the Idrisi, but to all lyemte fos fellow-refugees, on condition of their immediate return to Saudi Arabia. It wmit re p r esents the situation in Asir itself as having been completely restored to imp- normal. k 4. I have no further information up to date regarding the actual surrender of the Idrisi. It would be unsafe to take it for granted until it is known to have taken place, but it looks as though any serious danger of armed conflict between Ibn Saud and the Imam had been averted for the time being. ^ . 5 I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to His Ma3esty s High Commissioners for Egypt and Transjordan, to His Majesty's Chief Commissioner at Aden and to the Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Sloops.

No one who has a touch of sense or religious belief can deny that by co-operation and collaboration power is strengthened and the ambitions of enemies are weakened. We believe we have already pointed out to you that if those who have imitated the Europeans had not made easy the way for foreigners to conspire against Islam in such manner as they could have never thought of, Islam would have been amply strong and beyond reach. . All your feelings which have been actuated by Islamic zeal are exactly the same as ours. We hope that you will believe this to be a fact on our part. Mischievous deceivers have found us unyielding and ungovernable. We have paid no attention to their decorated trifles. Far be it from the truth that those defeated can be met by us with anything but detestation! Although when the late Sheikh Muhammad-bin-Dileym and Sheikh Madhi-bin-Turki and their companions came to us, we found them turning somewhat away from us, yet we revealed to them some primary facts which were the basis of everything. We agree to the four points indicated by you and have added some necessary details.' His Highness has asked His Majesty the King to send authorised delegates, who should be empowered with final particulars regarding the agreement. The time when this may be accomplished is probably very near. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Extract from the Mecca Umm-al-Qura, No. 428 of Shawwal 29, 1351 {February 24, 1933). (Translation.)

THE following official communique has been received from the Press Department:— After effecting the punitive measures undertaken by Government troops, consisting of people of the valleys, Asir troops and the troops sent from the Hejaz, the situation in the Asir Province has returned to normal. When the Amir Abdul Aziz-bin-Musaid went there, he assured the safety of those who sought it and punished those who refused to offer submission, V ]? Z t&gt; P eo P^ e K-ish, Haqu and Bil Ghazi. All then obeyed and the Sheikhs of Bil Ghazi who were still alive asked for security and have been granted it All other tribes of the Masariha, Beni Shubeyl and Bil Harth have also onered submission. As regards Hasan-al-Idrisi and Abdul Wahhab-al- Idnsi, who were the cause of the insurrection, they fled to the frontier of hisr Highness the Imam Yahya. Telegraphic communication has been exchanged between His Majesty the King and his Highness the Imam Yahya on the subject of the returning of all fugitives to the frontier. His Highness has mediated in the matter of granting pardon to all of them, including Hasan. His Majesty, in answer, proclaimed complete and general pardon to all on whose behalf his Highness the Imam had asked for pardon, if they returned to the country at once. The Amir Abdul Aziz-bin-Musaid has deputed to Midi, Ibn Shuheyl and Ibn Qadhi as representatives on his behalf, and at the request of his Highness the Imam Yahya, to take over all the fugitives who fled to these parts. People have returned to the farms, the ' Zakat' (' alms ') collectors have been sent out to perform their duties, and trade has begun to restore itself gradually to its previous state. The Government express their regret for the event that the devil misled the weakminded and exposed them to the punishment they had to suffer. On the other hand, we thank God for the victory and the success bestowed on his faithful slaves against those who have acted unjustly and oppressively.

IN my telegram No. 95 of the 13th May I had the honour to inform you of the publication of an official communique relative to the designation of Ibn Saud's eldest surviving son as heir to the Saudi Throne, a step which was decided on in principle, when Ibn Saud's dominions were declared to be a single kingdom, but which has evidently needed much preparation in various quarters. 2. The procedure followed has turned primarily and essentially on the acceptance of an oath of fealty in a form known as Bay a. This oath was drawn up on the 11th May and subscribed to in the first instance by the Amir Feisal as President of the Council, certain religious dignitaries, the members of the Council of Ministers and the members of the Legislative Council. I enclose a translation of the material part of this document, ( l ) following on a pious exordium. It was presented to the King who approved of it. The communique, issued the same day and published in the Umm-al-Qura of the 12th May, intimated that the necessary further ceremonial would take place on the 15th May. An elaborate programme of the ceremonial was drawn up and circulated. 3. The ceremonies in Mecca on the 15th May were staged impressively in all respects, except for the absence of Hamlet. The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia sat in Riyadh, while his brother Feisal received the Baya on his behalf. At 8 a.m . the latter repaired to the Great Mosque, where, surrounded by high personages and delegations from Medina, Jedda and Taif, he attended the pre liminary prayers. A salute in honour of the King was fired, and the Amir proceeded to receive the general Baya in an adjoining hall by shaking hands with each of a numerous concourse of people. After this he held a reception at the headquarters of the Government to receive congratulations, the offerers of which were regaled with refreshing drinks. After the afternoon prayer congratulations were offered to the King. The Amir Feisal gave a banquet in the evening. On the 17th May he and a number of princes, including his younger uncles, two of his brothers, a cousin and three of his nephews left for Riyadh to convey the Baya to the Amir Saud and to offer their own homage. They were accompanied by a delegation composed of three members of the Legislative Council. 4. On the same day, the 15th May, the local Governors in the Hejazi towns received the Baya of the leading inhabitants in a manner similar to that observed by the Amir teisal at Mecca. There would appear to have been no corresponding ceremonial in Nejd pending the arrival of the Amir Feisal. The whole procedure presents peculiarities, which probably represent the resultant of conflicting principles. It has been very expressly linked up with the decree of the 18th September, 1932, which, when declaring the union of Saudi Arabia, provided inter alia that the existing Council of Ministers, acting with other persons at the discretion of the President, should prepare a rule of succession to the throne to be submitted for the King's assent. The only documentary Baya so far would appear to be that signed on the 11th May by the members of the Council of Ministers and others. This was duly submitted on the same day to the King and it might be thought that his approval completed the designation of the Amir Saud as heir. It was obviously thought either politic or necessary, however, to obtain the acceptance of the nomination by a much wider circle on the 15th May. Even now it would appear that strictly speaking only the people of the Hejaz have publicly sworn or endorsed the Baya. On the 13th May the King sent a long telegram to the Amir Saud, full of pious exhortations, to which the Amir replied Not printed. [823 x—2]next day with equal piety and at even greater length. Both King and heir are all for Islam in this correspondence, but its most interesting feature, in the present connexion, is a passage near the end of the King's telegram, echoed in the Amir's reply. It was, ' People will perform the Baya to you in the Hejaz on Monday. Your brother Feisal will accept the Baya on your behalf. He as well as the members of the family will go to your side to convey to you the Baya of the people of the Hejaz, and in order to perform the Baya with you on their own behalf.' 5. All these proceedings and others of a minor nature which I have not mentioned doubtless kept statesmen in Mecca very busy. It was not until the 18th May that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs addressed a communication to the foreign representatives, which took the form of a third person note, forwarding the text of the first communique. Before I had got off the congratulations authorised in your telegram No. 62 of the 16th May, I received a further com munication, a translation^) of which I enclose, together with a copy of my reply.(') It may be of interest to add that the Soviet Minister was present at the ceremonies in Mecca; and that my Dutch colleague, who rushed in with congratulations on seeing the first communique in the press, received a reply in which the Amir Saud spoke of his desire to devote himself to the interests of Moslems and Arabs, but said nothing about foreign relations. 6. I have dealt somewhat minutely with certain legal aspects of the designation of the heir apparent, not only because of their constitutional interest, but also because there is a political side to the anxiety shown to commit the people of the Hejaz to acceptance of the measure, independently of the steps which have certainly been taken in Nejd to ensure the consent of theologians there and tribal chiefs. Much erudition might be expended on the historical traditions which have been followed. I will not trouble you with any long disquisition on a subject for which my knowledge does not suffice, but it may be of interest to add short notes on three questions, viz. :— {a) Whether it is in accordance with the strictest Islamic doctrine that a ruler should designate his heir during his lifetime; {h) whether an heir, if selected, can properly receive Baya before the ruler- ship falls vacant; and {c) whether Baya is in its essence a religious act or even an act appropriate only to a successor to the Caliphate or Imamate of Islam. 7. As regards {a), I understand that there is ample precedent for the designation of a future heir, even though it be admitted that in pure theory his accession must be ratified by some form of election or acceptance when it takes place. Indeed, as you are aware, many Moslem dynasties have been and are carried on in accordance with rules difficult to distinguish from rules of succession of the kind common in Europe. I cannot resist the comment that, so far as I know, the first well-authenticated designation of an heir, or at any rate of a relative as heir, was when the Caliph Muawiya, that Muawiya who lifted his hand against the Hashimites, provided for the succession of his son Yezid. 8. As regards (&amp;), I believe that there are precedents for this also. I think Mr. Philby told me, before he left, that there had been at least one in the history of the House of Saud. However alien to our own conceptions it may be that fealty 1 should be sworn to one who remains a subject, this procedure has an undoubted significance for Moslems, as the oath is binding from the moment it is taken and entails strong sanctions, which may be summed up by saying that any subsequent violation makes the violator an outlaw and the shedding of his blood lawful. 9. As regards (c), there is no doubt that, however much Islamic countries may have adopted in practice European ideas of State organisation and sovereignty, there is always an underlying theory that temporal power is in principle the concomitant of a religious position. It is already suggested that in the present case Ibn Saud aims at perpetuating a religious position, which in Nejd counts for more than his kingship, and which is comparable to, though not described as, a Caliphate. As against this, you will note that the present Baya has express reference to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Even the Imam of the Wahhabis has to adapt himself to practical conditions, and what Ibn Saud has done has been to endeavour to consolidate his regime in that kingdom, perhaps ( 1 ) Not printed.Ud., 1^' with an eye on its possible extension to all Arabs, but hardly to all Islam. He has not, you will observe, gone to the length of establishing a general rule of succession. He has merely provided for the first succession after his death, or, it might be, abdication. r aofti I have, &amp;c.

' WITH reference to my despatch No, 66 of the 28th February last relative to an alleged agreement between the Saudi Government and the Soviet, I have the honour to state that I asked Fuad Bey Hamza on the 18th March whether he could tell me how matters stood. I explained that I felt encouraged to ask him for any information which he could properly give, because the Saudi Mission had taken His Majesty's Government into their confidence in London last May, and because I preferred to get news from him rather than from the bazaars, where various rumours had been circulating. I reminded Fuad Bey that His Majesty's Government had defined their own attitude last ye^r in a way which showed that they did not stand in the way of any agreement between this country and Soviet Russia, and that after my return to Jedda, the King had shown further confidence in His Majesty's Government by sending me a message explaining his position. 2. Fuad Bey said that the Saudi Mission had been approached when m Moscow. The Russians wanted, I understood him to say, three things^-a removal of the embargo on trade from Russia to Saudi Arabia, a treaty of friendship and a commercial treaty. They had expressed readiness to accommodate the Saudi Government on terms of short or of long credit. Fuad Bey did not go into details of what these alternatives meant, but I gathered that the Soviet authorities had proposed arrangements (presumably for a loan in the form of goods to be supplied on credit) for a long period of years, and that the Saudi Government were unwilling to commit themselves for more than say three years. 3. Fuad Bey admitted that, following on the Moscow conversations, there had been a renewal of negotiations here, but said that only one thing had been agreed, viz., the removal of the embargo on trade. This removal had not, however, yet become effective, as the Soviet Government had undertaken not to ship goods until the authorities here had had time to organise selling arrangements. 4. Fuad Bey referred back to the petroleum products transaction of 1931. He said that in that year the Soviet Government were already pressing for a removal of the embargo on trade, and that the King, feeling unable at that time to give them satisfaction, had sanctioned the particular transaction to show that his attitude was not due to ill will. Fuad Bey made no mention of any arrange ment to pay off the debt in respect of the goods supplied in 1931 by remitting duty on goods to be imported under the recent arrangement. 5. My conversation with Fuad Bey took place at a moment when 1 was much taken up with matters of more immediate concern to me. I cannot, there fore, reproduce it as accurately as I would wish, but I think I have got the essential facts right is the above summary. He asked me to treat what he was telling me as confidential, and I undertook to do this. 6.

' WITH reference to my despatch No. 69 of the 28th February, I have the honour to submit a few further items of information regarding the ex-Khedive's scheme for a national bank in this country. 2. Abdul Hamid Shedid did not get away on the 1st March as he had intended, owing to delay over the forwarding of the King's final decision. There appears to have been no serious hitch, but an eleventh-hour attempt to dissuade Ibn Saud was made by certain merchants, whose spokesman, young Hussein Aweyni, made a fruitless journey to Riyadh. The Dutch Financial Adviser has also shown himself very hostile to the scheme, but I do not think that his opinion counted for anything. It is probable that M. van Leeuwen's dislike of the project is quite honest, but it is possible that it may be accentuated by sympathy with the Netherlands Trading Society. 3. Abdul Hamid Shedid finally left on the 10th March. He gave me to understand after dinner at Mr. Philby's house on the previous evening that his agreement with the Saudi Government was quite definite and that it only remained to organise the bank. He explained that it would not confine itself to the Hejaz—1 million, he said, was too much for this country—but would operate in other Near Eastern countries and would have its headquarters in London, where he himself will be managing director. It is now pretty generally known that Mr. Philby is likely to be the conseiller of the bank in this country, but I would ask you to regard this information as strictly confidential until it reaches you from other sources, as my most definite information was confided to me in a very personal conversation by Mr. Philby himself. 4. The Umm-al-Qura of the 17th March announced the conclusion of the agreement and promised full particulars as soon as it should have come into force. Nothing further was published up to the 30th March, the date of the last issue I have seen. 5. I know nothing about the latest plans of the promoters of the bank. The delay in Abdul Hamid Shedid's departure destroyed any prospect of rushing the matter through in time to start business here on the 1st April. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN.

IN paragraph 5 of my despatch No. 23 of the 17th January, I stated that, so far as I could make out, the frontier between Azir and the Yemen appeared to abut on the sea at the mouth of the Wadi Tashar and to run inland in a direction which I proceeded to indicate. On re-reading the relevant papers I find that 1 was probably too guarded as regards the terminal on the sea. Although it is quite uncertain whether the frontier has been agreed as regards its whole length and certain that it has not been delimited, the Saudi official communique published on the 6th January and forwarded with my printed despatch No. 10 of the 8th January, speaks definitely of the ^vV^adi Tashar, to which the Saudi troops claimed to have advanced, as being the furthest district on the coast. It may therefore be assumed that the mouth of the Wadi in question is the boundary point in the eyes of the Saudi Government and the Government of the Yemen probably take the same view. 2. I think it worth while to draw attention to this point, even though it is unlikely to have escaped you, as it may be important for naval purposes to have a definite indication of the coastal point at which Saudi Arabia ends and the Yemen begins. In this connexion I may add that I now learn privately from the commanding officer of H.M.S. Penzance that the Island of Ashik, which I mentioned in paragraph 5 of the enclosure in my despatch No. 104 of the 9th April regarding naval visits to the Farsan Islands, &amp;c., lies off the coast 30 miles south of Jizan, 11 miles north-north-west of Medi and about 2 miles south of the mouth of the Wadi Tashar. 3.

No. 1 Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received July 4.) No. 182. Secret.) ir, Jedda, June 14, 1933. WITH reference to my despatch No. 119 of the 18th April, I have the honour to state that Ibn Saud again came to Jedda early on the 10th June, in anticipation of an early departure for Riyadh. He gave his usual series of formal audiences to heads of foreign missions that morning, beginning with me, as the Soviet Minister was in Mecca. His Majesty appeared to be in good form and was as affable as usual. I presented Mr. Calvert. 2. Following on general conversation of the usual anodyne character, the King observed that the autumn was his busy time in Nejd, as it was there that the leading people flocked about him, each expecting the personal attention of the Sovereign. He went on to say that within a year to two his son Saud might be trained enough to relieve him of this burden. I took the opportunity of con gratulating His Majesty in person on the action he had so wisely taken to provide for the future of the throne. The King, in thanking me, stressed the fact that he had not taken the initiative, but yielded to the appeal's of his people. 3. The King's remark about the Amir Saud derives some significance from a report which reached me on the 3rd June in a form too uncertain to be worth reporting at the time, that the King was contemplating abdication and was only waiting for the return of the mission he had sent to the Yemen. Without wishing to exaggerate the probability of such an event at some not too distant date, I think that it should be borne in mind as a possibility. To an European, it may seem unlikely that a man of 53 with Ibn Saud's past should contemplate such a step at the height of his achievement. I am not sure, however, that it would be alien to his character to retire in favour of the son, whom he has so spectacularly installed as Heir Apparent, hoping perhaps to guide the steps of his successor during the remainder of his own life. It is nearly three years since Fuad Bey spoke to me of the King's desire to reduce his burden of responsibility, and ' to reign rather than to rule.' This forecast proved false, but there have been faint indications of a slow movement in that direction. Ibn Saud has tended to lead a somewhat easier life than of old. He has left more in the hands of his advisers, though he still controls them all in major matters. He has accepted now consti tutional forms, which, though they appear to us rather illusory at present, are not wholly unreal. Last year he made new secretarial arrangements at Riyadh, which involved the transfer to the Amir Saud of his own chief secretary, Ibrahim- ibn-Muammar, who has now gone as Charge d'Affaires to Bagdad. 4. I collect these indications for two reasons. Slight as they are, they lend support to the idea that Ibn Saud may end his active career, or at any rate his public career, by abdication rather than by death. Secondly, and this is of more interest to His Majesty's Government, such an intention would help to explain the rather marked tendency which Ibn Saud has shown during the past year to seek to compose various differences which might militate against the success of a new ruler; to disarm hostility among his own subjects; and to reduce the possi bilities of quarrel with neighbouring countries like Iraq, Transjordan, the Yemen, and perhaps even Koweit. 5. I sought a further audience with the King on the 11th June to discuss business. I will report what passed separately in connexion with the subjects I raised, in so far as it may be necessary to record it. The King broached no subject of his own. 6. Ibn Saud returned to Mecca late on the 12th June. During his short stay. His Majesty gave a great deal of time to Captain H. C. Armstrong, who is writing his biography and whom he consented, as a result of correspondence through the Saudi Minister in London, to receive in Jedda. Captain Armstrong [851 d—1]V arrived on the 7th June. He hacl a general conversation with the King on the 10th June and had four further audiences on the 11th and 12th June of an average duration of some two hours each. The King has been most forthcoming, and both parties appear to be exceedingly pleased with each other. I have avoided any appearance of promoting Captain Armstrong's enterprise, but he is staying with my wife and me on the strength of old friendship. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to his Excellency the Viceroy of India (Foreign and Political Department), His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad, His Majesty's High Commissioners at Jerusalem and Cairo, the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, and to His Majesty's Chief Commissioner at Aden.

' IN paragraph 32 of the Jedda report for March, enclosed in my despatch No. 102 of the 7th April, I mentioned that Ibn Saud had given a dinner to notable pilgrims on the evening of the 31st March. As you are aware, this is now a regular feature of each year's pilgrimage season. On the present occasion, the King entertained some hundreds of guests of various nationalities, including several Indians. I understand from my Indian vice-consul that the attention shown both to Shia and to Indian pilgrims has been a feature of this year's pilgrimage. In the case of the Indians the King and the Minister of Finance, who is largely responsible for dispensing such attention, had the advantage of the presence of Jemal Pasha Ghazzi, who has been conducting since last year an intensive pro-pilgrimage campaign in India and was able to make play with the intimacy he had established there with various participants in this year's Haj. 2. It is the King's custom to speak at great length at these annual banquets. The published version of his address on the present occasion occupied a page and a half of the Umm-al-Qura of the 6th April. I enclose a short summary prepared in the Legation. 3. The King preached from his usual text, the need for unity m Islam, but he seems to have restrained almost entirely the tendency which he has sometimes shown in the past to give offence by his utterances regarding people who do not share his views. I understand that the published version of his speech represents the original pretty accurately, although the actual language used in certain passages may have been more emphatic. I have heard only one definite suggestion of any important omission. According to my Persian colleagues the King gave as one of the reasons why he could not aspire to the Caliphate the fact that so many Moslem countries are under alien denomination. He is said to have included in the number Egypt as being under the thumb of Great Britain. If he really said this, it cannot have been pleasing to all his Egyptian hearers, though it might gratify some of them. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to His Excellency the Viceroy of India (Foreign and Political Department), to His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad and to His Majesty's High Commissioners for Egypt and Transjordan. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure in No. 1. Sumnfiary of the Speech delivered by His Majesty King Abdul Aziz-ihn-Saud at the Banquet given on March 31, 1933, at the Royal Palace at Mecca. (As published in Umm-al-Qura, April 6, 1933.) THE Arab people, His Majesty said, enjoy one great blessing from God m the teachings of the Prophet, which have descended on them like the fertilising rain on the earth, and have been the means by which they have spread their influence over vast territories. All Moslems were indebted to that great Teacher for the good that they had; and if they would but adhere to the commands of God, as given in the Koran and the sacred writings, they would be successful [795 q—2]and united, but if they set aside these commands they would become separated and degraded. And this, the King went on, is what is happening now; and he drew a picture of the sad condition of the Moslem world in general and the Arab people in particular at the present time. Some people imagine, he said, that the only remedy for this state is for Moslems to adopt European civilisation; but this was not true, for the teachings of the Koran guarantee prosperity, unity and happiness to those who follow them, because they make no differentiation between King and commoner, save in respect of piety alone. Nor were foreigners alone to blame for all the calamities which had overtaken Islam, for amongst Moslems themselves they found some who were misguided and who were willing to aid them to work against Islam. &lt;c I am the Herald of Islam,' the King concluded. He was an Arab Moslem who served Islam and who worked for the spread of Islam and for Moslem unity; and he was prepared to sacrifice himself and his family in the defence of Islam! He did not aim to be a chief on earth; of greatest importance to him was to make God's word supreme, and in pursuit of this he cared for no difficulties. Many had opposed him since he first put forward this aim, but had been vanquished. What did they want of him? His actions were clear; he followed the Way It had been said that he claimed to be Khalif over all Islam. He made no such claim. A Khalif must enforce the commands of the Islamic religion over the whole world of Islam, and this was possible in the time of the Khalifat; but was there a man who could so do at the present time ? It was clearly impossible and all he himself desired was unity and co-operation among Moslems. Behind him were more than 400,000 warriors; if he wept they wept; if he rejoiced they rejoiced, and if he commanded they obeyed his commands ' These were the Troops of Unity, the brethren of all who obeyed God, ready to fight for God and expecting nothing from it except to satisfy God; and this was the force destined to confirm the Religious Law and Islam throughout the territories over which he ruled.(/lit THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT ^ _ Ud!

I took the opportunity of presenting Mr. Oppenheim to the King. After ii he had retired. His Majesty left it to me to start the business conversation. I I reviewed at some length the events leading up to the recent recognition of each ii other by Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah, stressing the evidence they had afforded i: of the friendship of His Majesty's Government towards the King and his ii Government. I said that a further stage was now impending. It might be attended by difficulty, one of the reasons being that His Majesty's Government had expressed readiness to accept a definite responsibility for the execution of undertakings entered into by the Amir and Government of Transjordan. This made it necessary that they should not only know the nature of such under takings, but should assure themselves that they were such that His Majesty's Government could discharge the obligation implied in their guarantee. I asked the King to bear this in mind, when questions were referred to him during the negotiations and to remember that, if at any point His Majesty's Government took up an attitude distasteful to him, it would be due not to lack of friendship, but to a desire to avoid future controversy. 3. Ibn Saud replied, also at some length and with animation, but his state ments were not closely reasoned and I observed the same curious appearance of preoccupation as at my formal audience of the loth April. His main thesis was the familiar one that he expected his friends, the British Government and myself, to see him through and that there need be no difficulties, if they were willing to do so. He described himself more than once as the older friend, meaning that he was an older friend of His Majesty's Government than the Amir Abdullah. He suggested that as the Amir's delegate would have the support of British officials in Transjordan, his own representatives should have mine. 4. I persevered in my attempt to impress on the King the consideration that His Majesty's Government must make certain that they could ensure the execution of any undertakings they endorsed. I pointed out, d propos of a reference by the King to Arabs generally, that the Arabs were a large family in which family quarrels occurred and that His Majesty's Government came into their affairs from outside. They desired to do their best for all Arabs, but they stood towards different sections of them in a variety of relationships. They dealt with His Majesty as an independent ruler. They considered the feelings of the Amir Abdullah and his people, but they had authority and responsibility in regard to them. I cited as an illustration a recent incident. The authorities in Transjordan had been trying to round up one Karayim-bin-Atiya, in order to put him out of the way of harming the King. I had just heard that the King had recently entertained this man as his guest. I said I had no objection to this. It was an Arab way of doing things. My point was that if the same man were shown favour by the Amir Abdullah, it would be my duty to deprecate it. ' 5. The King was voluble in explanation of his attitude towards Karayim, which he put down to the fact that he had been asked, and asked by the Amir Abdullah himself, to be forgiving towards the Beni Atiya. I repeated that I had mentioned the incident only as an example of a case in which he was free to show favour to a late enemy and in the counterpart of which His Majesty's Government [795 q—1]2 would not be free, if they had promised to secure the execution of a treaty article precluding the Amir from showing favour to an enemy of the King. Arab ways, I observed, were not our ways. I mentioned extradition as a subject which might give rise to difficulty unless we were sure that the terms of an extradition treaty were such as could be carried out. I glanced at the difficulty of determining nationality, a question which for obvious reasons I did not wish to discuss in detail at this stage, and mentioned the case of the Atun, over whose nationality we had been at loggerheads for eighteen months as an illustration. 6. This conversation is hardly worth reporting. I record it merely to show that, while doing my best to prepare the way for successful negotiations between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan, I have tried to disabuse the King and his advisers of any idea that treaties, in regard to which His Majesty's Government are to have responsibility, can simply be copied from the text of the treaties with Iraq. My object has been to show that His Majesty's Government must consider their own future responsibility with great care, if the treaties are to breed friendship and not renewed controversy. 7. With regard to what I have said in this and my despatch under reference regarding Ibn Saud's state, I may mention that my Italian colleague told Mr. Furlonge spontaneously that he had found the King distrait and disinclined to initiate subjects of conversation, though he had been charmed by his smile. My impression is that the King is suffering from a good deal of nervous strain. He seemed tired and unusually anxious to end the conversation summarised above. It is true that it was rather long and that His Majesty was probably overdue for his mid-morning meal, but I have never known him show quite so much polite anxiety to see me go. 8.

You will see by the second that the question of the disposal of Hasan-al-Idrisi has been settled in a manner very favourable to him. When speaking to me on the subject on the 15th April, Fuad Bey expatiated on the King's longanimity and generosity. I admitted the justice of these praises, adding that the King had also shown ! qualities of statesmanship, of which generosity was a part. This was not 1 insincere, but the fact remains that His Majesty's display of statesmanship - on this occasion indicates readiness to go to great lengths to avoid a quarrel with fc the Imam. It is also possible that he believes, on reflexion, that Hasan-al-Idrisi will be less dangerous as an exile in the Yemen than if he returned under any conditions which left him free to tamper directly with tribes in Asir. 2. Fuad Bey emphasised the point that Asir would not be governed as before, but as ' Asir Tihama,' meaning that it would become a province under that name. He added, confidentially, that the King's cousin, Abdul Aziz-bin- fl: Musaid, would not remain there permanently, as was at one time expected, and that it was intended to make Turki-as-Sdayri, at present Governor of Jauf-Skaka, Governor-General of the whole of Asir, to reside at Abha, with a subordinate Governor at Jizan. 3. The second of the enclosed communiques expresses the expectation that Abdul Wahhab Idrisi, the brother of Hasan and one of the prime movers in the revolt in Asir, will return with other ex-rebels to Saudi Arabia. I doubt whether this expectation will be fulfilled, but I can hardly suppose that Ibn Saud, having yielded in the case of Hasan, will quarrel with the Imam over Abdul Wahhab, &amp;c. It looks {a) as though the situation in Asir had been stabilised at any rate for the time being, and (&amp;) as though any danger of conflict in the near future between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen had been averted. 4.

Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Extract from the Mecca Umm-al-Qura of April 14, 1933. Official Communique from the Press Department. (Translation.) THE Government have previously announced that no traces of the insurrec tion which was fomented by conspirators still remain in the Asir Tihama, may praise be to God. The fugitive tribesmen have returned to their own districts, the situation has been restored to normal and the markets of the tribes have been opened as usual; orders have therefore been issued to the additional military forces to return. The Amir Abdul Aziz-bin-Musaid will shortly return to Abha after completion of the contemplated administrative reorganisation. His Highness the Imam Yahya has approached His Majesty the King with a view to obtaining pardon from him for Seyyid Hasan-al-Idrisi, and His Majesty had agreed to this. His Highness has again approached him to get permission for Seyyid-al-Hasan to choose a place to settle in, according to his wishes. Despite the explicit terms of the treaty concluded between His Majesty the King and His Highness the Imam Yahya, which require that Seyyid-al-Hasan and others should be handed over. His Majesty the King has taken account of the sincere friendship existing between him and His Highness the Imam Yahya, and has desired not to refuse his request. His Highness having given an understanding to His Majesty the King that As Seyyid will behave well and will remain under his supervision and control. Furthermore, in consideration of the rank of the Idrisi's family and the long-standing connexions which have existed between that family and the Saudi family. His Majesty the King has not wished to coerce them, especially as His Majesty by the might of God has no fear of Seyyid or anybody else, whether he stay in his territory or elsewhere. For these reasons His Majesty has accepted the undertakings of His Highness the Imam Yahya, and has given him right to choose whatever place he thinks fit for Hasan Idrisi to settle in. His Highness the Imam Yahya has asked His Majesty the King to be kind to the family of the Idrisi, as they are in a state of destitution, and to grant them a certain competence. His Majesty has therefore issued orders to pay Seyyid-al-Hasan-al-Idrisi a pension of 2,000 riyals monthly for his livelihood. It is expected that Seyyid Abdul Wahhab-al-Idrisi and all his companions will submit and return and that none will stay with A1 Hasan except his family, in view of the general amnesty which has been granted. -vr'' ^✓ T HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJEST Y'S GOVERNMENT , v*\3 EASTERN (A rabia ). |V pj£ '■siptNG Y, j May 17, 1933. CONFIDENTIAL. flH S ection 1. %k [E 2491/840/25] ^ ^ Sir John Simon to Sir A. Ryan (Jedda). (No. 124.) Sir, Foreign Office, May 17, 1933. WITH reference to your despatch No. 289 of the 16th July, 1931, I have to inform you that the question of the possible entry of Saudi Arabia into the League of Nations has been under further consideration. 2. On the 3rd March the Saudi Arabian Minister referred to this subject in a conversation with Sir L. Oliphant, and requested the views and advice of His Majesty's Government. The following points were raised in the ensuing discussion :— (a) The Hejaz had originally come within the wording of article 1 of the Covenant of the League, which runs as follows : ' The original members of the League of Nations shall be those of the signatories which are named in the annex to this Covenant''; but the name had completely disappeared from the title of Ibn Sand's present dominions, and it therefore seemed that, if at any time Saudi Arabia were to ask for admission to the League, this request would have to come as from a new country. The Minister entirely agreed in this view, and saw no objection to such a procedure. (b) The League of Nations requires to be satisfied that an applicant State has established and well-defined frontiers. Sir L. Oliphant referred to the settlement which was reported to have been reached between King Ibn Saud and the Imam of the Yemen as to the Asir-Yemen frontier, but expressed some doubt whether this and the provisional nature of the frontier with Transjordan would be adequate to satisfy the League. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba replied that the Asir-Yemen frontier was not entirely fixed, but the differences were of a very minor character, and he did not anticipate trouble from them. {c) Continuance of slavery might be severely criticised at Geneva. The Minister at once appealed to the precedent of Abyssinia, and added that he himself had raised this possible difficulty with King Ibn Saud,. who felt that, if his country were a member of the League, the League might help him in the matter of anti-slavery measures. 3. The Minister said that, above all, he wished to avoid a situation in li, which, when Saudi Arabia had applied for membership of the League, her request should be rejected. He was certain, however, that if His Majesty's Government were to champion the Saudi cause, the candidate whom they supported would be successful. It was explained to him that the result of any application for League membership could never be regarded as certain before hand, and that His Majesty's Government rarely, if ever, promised their support to a candidate in advance. 4. On the 11th May Sir L. Oliphant received a further visit from Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, who on this occasion stated that, while the Saudi Government did not wish to ask for a definite promise of support from His Majesty's Government, they would be glad to know whether an application by Saudi Arabia for member ship of the League of Nations would be favourably viewed by His Majesty's Government. He was again referred to the objections stated in (b) and (c) of the preceding paragraph, and, as he had only raised the question in an entirely informal manner, agreed not to press for an immediate answer. 5. In the light of these two interviews the arguments both in favour of and against the admission of Saudi Arabia into the League have again been considered. Two of the objections which were originally seen to the Saudi candidature and which were set out in paragraphs 3 to 5 of Mr. Arthur Henderson's despatch No. 137 of the 8th April, 1931, still remain valid. Saudi [795 r —i]2 Arabia is a primitively organised State, whose admission to the League might not bring with it an accession of strength, but rather tend, if anything, to weaken the authority of that body. Secondly, in spite of the intentions attributed to King Ibn Saud by Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, there seems no reason to anticipate that any serious effort is likely to be made by King Ibn Saud and his Government to put an end to the institution of slavery as part of the social structure of Saudi Arabia. The Abyssinian precedent is not a safe one to invoke in this connexion, since, apart from the fact that the general attitude of the Abyssinian Government towards the possible abolition of the institution of slavery is probably less unsatisfactory than is likely to be that of the Saudi Government, an application by the Saudi Government for admission to membership of the League is not likely to attract at Geneva the general political support which was responsible for the election of Abyssinia in 1923, and such an application might, indeed, meet with powerful opposition. Finally, a further and serious disadvantage, from the point of view of His Majesty's Government, is that, if the Saudi candidature were successful, this would undoubtedly increase the discontent felt in Egypt against her exclusion from the League pending the negotiation of a treaty settlement with His Majesty's Government. 6. You will appreciate the fact that the argument based on the indefinite character of the Saudi frontiers is not strong, since, unless the Saudi Government were formally and finally to renounce their claims to the Maan-Akaba area— which seems in the highest degree improbable—it would, as you are aware, not be to the interest either of His Majesty's Government or of the Transjordan authorities to accede at this moment to any request from the Saudi Government for the delimitation on the ground of the Hadda frontier between Transjordan and Nejd, or for a more precise definition of the de facto frontier between Transjordan and the Hejaz. In point of fact, the somewhat doubtful character of certain of the frontiers of Saudi Arabia might not in itself lead to serious difficulties at Geneva. The most important of the undelimited frontiers are those between Saudi Arabia and Iraq and between Saudi Arabia and Trans jordan. But the fact that the frontier between Saudi Arabia and Iraq was undelimited did not prevent Iraq from being admitted to membership of the League of Nations last October, while the similarly undelimited character of the Hadda frontier, and the purely de facto nature of the Maan-Akaba frontier between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan, which affects both countries equally, has never, so far as I am aware, been questioned at Geneva in connexion with the 'administration of Transjordan by His Majesty's Government under the Palestine mandate. Meanwhile, recent reports appear to confirm the Saudi Minister's statement that the frontier between Asir and the Yemen has now been | practically agreed upon between King Ibn Saud and the Imam, and that there Ijy is no important area in dispute. As regards the south-eastern frontiers of Saudi |! Arabia, Ibn Saud, by recognising under article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda the pi special relations between His Majesty's Government and the Arabian rulers of 11 the Persian Gulf, may be regarded as having virtually recognised the boundaries |'laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 1914. In these circumstances, ' except possibly for the Saudi claim to the Maan-Akaba area of Transjordan, it seems unlikely that serious difficulty would arise at Geneva over the frontiers of Saudi Arabia, and it is undesirable that the question should be raised prematurely. Since, however, the frontier difficulty has on past occasions been mentioned as one of the possible objections to the candidature of Saudi Arabia for membership of the League, there is some danger that the Saudi Government may attempt to obtain a demarcation of the Transjordan frontier by linking up the two questions and by representing His Majesty's Government as refusing to remove one of the principal defects which render Saudi Arabia ineligible for entry into the League. If any move of this kind is made or appears likely to be made, you should refer to me for further instructions. 7. Meanwhile, if the Saudi Government show signs of wishing to press their application. His Majesty's Government will not feel justified in actively discouraging them from doing so. Both Iraq and Persia have undoubtedly strengthened their international position as a result of their membership of the League, and it is not unnatural that Saudi Arabia should wish to follow their example. Provided that the Saudi Government realise the objections which are likely to be raised to their candidature—particularly in connexion with the existence of slavery in their country—and provided that they do not expect Hiss 3 iiiMajesty's Government to sponsor them, there seems to be no strong countervailing % reason why they should be deterred from seeking admission. In dealing with ^^iti any further enquiries on this subject, therefore, excepting those of which the ^possibility is considered in the previous paragraph, you should adopt an attitude s ^itf of complete but sympathetic neutrality; and, while giving the Saudi Government e )Mt :(; 'any information they may require, you should refrain from anything which might ss ^%be taken as a rebuff. At the same time, you should not minimise the obstacles in 7 is piij, the way of their candidature, and should do nothing to encourage them to proceed hastily in the matter. 'Mulls I am, &amp;c.

' SINCE I wrote my despatcli No. 331 of the 2nd August last incidental reference only has been made in reports from this Legation to M. van Leeuwen. the Dutch expert who entered the service of the Saudi Government in April 1932 as financial adviser. I have now to record his final departure from Jedda on the 18th May. _ 2. M. van Leeuwen returned from sick leave in or about October last. This leave interrupted what was to have been a year of continuous service, to be followed by a period of leave on full pay before his contract finally expired. I believe it was agreed that he should draw no salary for the period of his absence last year, and should make up for the time lost by serving for an additional three months at the end of the vear originally contemplated. 3. Unfortunatelv M. van Leeuwen's health has continued to be precarious. He has had several bouts of illness during the spring, and this has been the immediate cause of his leaving for good. It must be attributed in part, however, to the hopelessness of his position in the Administration here. I do not think that he has at any time been allowed to do more than write academic reports, and it has been increasingly evident of late that he could play no effective role in a department dominated by the personality and methods of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman. . , 4. Things were not improved by M. van Leeuwen s condemnation ot tne National Bank scheme projected by the ex-Khedive and his associates. By the time this was launched he had lost patience to such an extent that he abandoned his previous attitude of discretion and expressed his adverse opinion to outsiders like myself. Saudi circles were very ready to think that his hostility to the scheme was due to apprehension lest it should damage the position of the Netherlands Trading Society, which is, as you know, the only organised bank here and in which he was formerly employed. The suspicion may have been increased by the fact that, for reasons of health, he had gone to stay indefinitely with the Netherlands Charge d'Affaires. 5. It was to be foreseen that no adviser could reorganise the finances ot this country in a year, least of all in a year so inauspicious as one beginning in April 1932, when they were already in a desperate condition and the whole world as well was in a mess. It is, however, lamentable that M.. van Leeuwen, of whose capacity I cannot judge, but who was an honest and industrious man, should not have had a chance of doing anything at all. He had no axe to grind, and I do not think that the Netherlands authorities made any attempt to use him for their own purposes. The Dutch Charge d Affaires has assured me that since he presented M. van Leeuwen to the King he has scrupulously refrained from meddling in his affairs, and has not seen his reports. I believe this to be true, and I shall be all the sorrier for M. Adriaanse if, as is possible, he has to concern himself with the final settlement of account between the Saudi Government and their late adviser. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW EYAN.

[E 3612/2/25] No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—{Received July 4.) (No. 186.) Sir. Jedda, June 18, 1933. WITH reference to my despatch No. 120 of the 18th April, relative to the situation in Asir, I have the honour to state that the TJmm-al-Qura recently announced the arrival of the Amir Abdul Aziz-bin-Musaid, after completing the organisation of Asir Tihama, or Tihamat Asir, as it appears now to be called for choice. According to a later report he reached Mecca on the 13th June. 2. The TJmm-al-Qura devoted a good deal of space to Asir in its numbers of the 9th and 16th June. The article in the issue of the 9th June is worth summarising. The writer reproaches the foreign press with confusion of language in speaking of the theatre of the recent revolt as Asir. He distinguishes between what has hitherto been officially called the Idrisi territory, i.e., Tihamat Asir (so named on the analogy of other tihamas or coastal regions) and what he calls either Asir tout court or Asir-as-Surat. The latter name is unfamiliar to me, but ' Surat' occurs, apparently as a place name, in another recent article in the same paper, which touched on the boundary between Saudi Arabia and Yemen and which I have brought to your notice in a separate despatch. 3. The writer explains that Tihamat Asir corresponds to what was known in Turkish times as the districts of Sabya, Jizan and Abu Arish. He defines it as being bounded on the north by the districts of Qunfida, Birk, Muhail and Rijal-al- Ma (a tribal name, as you know), on the east by Asir-as-Surat or Asir and on the south by the districts of Medi and Haradh; and as having a coastal extension from Qahma to Musim, near the Wadi Ta'shar {cf. my despatch No. 113 of the 14th April). After enumerating the principal localities in the area and the tribes inhabiting it, he refers to the past existence of the two Amirates of Abu Arish and Sabya, the eviction of the Sherif of Abu Arish by Muhammad-al-Idrisi, the eventual appointment of the latter by the Turks as Kaimakam of Sabya, Jizan and Abu Arish and the later disputes which ended in the triumph of the late Idrisi Hasan over his nephew Ali, who was given asylum by Ibn Saud. 4. All this leads up to a brief account of the relations between Ibn Saud and Hasan-al-Idrisi since 1926 culminating in revolt which the Government repressed 'without great trouble and without taking strong military measures.' The writer refers to knavish suggestions that certain persons may be trying to stir up a further movement. There is no sign, he says, of anything of the sort, as is proved by the return of Ibn Musaid, the demobilisation of the Saudi forces, the organisation of a new Administration and the appointment of Amirs. He goes on to say that Tihamat Asir, comprising the three districts already named, is to be governed by an Amir, assisted by a council consisting of the officer commanding troops, the Amir in charge of finance, the Qadhi and seven notables. The Saudi Amir at Abha will have a right of supervision. 5. The Umm-al-Qura article of the 16th June is historical and may be intended to be followed by others. It is based mainly on the relevant portion of a general work recently published by Fuad Bey Hamza in Arabic, under the title, ' The Heart of the Arabian Peninsula.' It deals at some length with the obscure history of the Sherifs of Abu Arish and the old rivalries between the Turks, the Imams of the Yemen and the Sauds for ascendancy in that area. The article i of no contemporary interest, except in so far as it tends to support the distinction which the Saudi Government are anxious to enforce between Asir proper and Tihamat Asir. As you are aware, that distinction seems to have received recent expression in the agreement reached in 1920 between the then Idrisi and Ibn Saud, which has never been published. Put in a nutshell, the Saudi thesis is, I think^ that Ibn Saud has a prescriptive historical right to Asir proper but rules the Tihama by virtue of arrangements with lawful rulers, the Idrisis, whose [851 d—2]elimination has been justified by the revolt of Hasan-al-Idrisi, after he had voluntarily delegated his rights to the King. It will be necessary to bear this thesis in mind in following further negotiations between Ibn Saud and the Imam regarding their frontiers. Both rulers have pretensions in Nejran and Beni Yem area and there have of late been various rumours, unsubstantial, but not lightly to be rejected, of armed activity in that remote region. 6.

Sir, Foreign Office, July 27, 1933. THE Minister of Saudi Arabia, at an interview at this Department on the 21st July, made representations regarding a possible outbreak of hostilities between King Ibn Saud and the Imam of the Yemen, on the same lines as those made to you by the Saudi Arabian Minister of Finance and reported in your telegram No. 140 of the 20th July. 2. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba explained that King Ibn Saud had come to the conclusion that a conflict between himself and the Imam was inevitable. The Imam had opened the negotiations with the Saudi delegation recently sent to Sanaa by demanding the whole of Asir, not for the Idrisi, but for himself. King Ibn Saud was also convinced that the Imam and Italian sources were supplying the Idrisi with arms and munitions preparatory to an attack on Asir, which would be supported by Yemeni troops. The Imam's plan.in that event, according to Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, would be to take over Asir from the Idrisi, in the event of the Idrisi's attempt being successful. An attack by the Idrisi on Asir would thus involve hostilities between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, and in that case King Ibn Saud was determined that it should be in a fight to a finish. 3. In these circumstances, Sheikh Hafiz Wahba had been instructed by King Ibn Saud to ascertain what would be the attitude of His Majesty's Govern ment. He realised that there could be no question of His Majesty's Government involving themselves in hostilities with the Imam; but King Ibn Saud was anxious to know how far he could count on the moral support of His Majesty's Govern ment, and whether it would be possible for them to give him assistance by means, for example, of a loan or of the supply of arms on favourable terms. In return. King Ibn Saud would be prepared to treat all British interests, both in Saudi Arabia and in the Yemen, if he should conquer it, with the greatest generosity. Though he did not say so in so many words, Sheikh Hafiz Wahba appeared desirous of implying that King Ibn Saud might, in addition to giving His Majesty's Government satisfaction over British interests generally, be willing to offer special concessions. 4. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba also enquired whether anything could be done to prevent the Imam and the Idrisi securing arms from Italian sources and to discourage the Italian Government from giving them support in other directions. 5. The Minister was informed that the whole situation which he envisaged appeared still quite hypothetical. The Imam was old and was reported to be ill; his country was known to be impoverished; it seemed frima facie unlikely that he woud embark at this moment on so hazardous an adventure as a war with Saudi Arabia. Apart from this, much would depend on the circumstances in which such a conflict broke out. It might be that the Imam was trying to goad King Ibn Saud into initiating hostilities, and it would be obviously a grave mistake for King Ibn Saud to fall in with such a manoeuvre. It appeared highly important that King Ibn Saud should exercise great patience and should do all possible to avoid hostilities. 6. So far as Italy was concerned, the Italian Government and Italian private manufacturers were legally entitled to sell arms and munitions to the Imam. It was indeed well known that they had been doing so for some years. It was doubtful whether the Italian Government had any considerable influence over the Imam, and whether their intervention, if they did intervene, would greatly affect the situation for better or for worse. It seemed therefore a mistake to exaggerate the importance of rumours of Italian assistance to the Imam or to the Idrisi. [851 dd—1]7. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba was informed, in reply to his enquiry as to the ^ attitude of His Majesty's Government that it did not appear possible for them ^itel to give King Ibn Sand any material support which would be of use to him, with- Je, out themselves becoming involved in hostilities with the Imam, which (as the Minister himself recognised) was out of the question. Moreover, if King Ibn ^{19 Saud desired His Majesty's Government to exercise their influence with the Italian Government to induce them to observe an attitude of neutrality, it was ' jtiii clear that His Majesty's Government must themselves remain strictly neutral. f ^ 8. Throughout the interview every opportunity was taken to urge counsels J; ^ of moderation upon the Minister. It was also suggested to him that an incursion ^ by the Idrisi into Asir, even supported by Yemeni troops, could well be treated m,;,, by King Ibn Saud as a rebellion in his own territory and thus as an internal 'A matter, and that actual hostilities with the Imam might by this means be avoided. 1 9. At the conclusion of the interview. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba was assured that, while the situation seemed too hypothetical to make it possible for His -i, Majesty's Government to make any definite pronouncement as to their attitude, the whole question would be most carefully considered and instructions would be sent to you as soon as possible regarding the reply which you should make to the 1 Emir Feisal's memorandum and to Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman's representations. P® Subsequently, I addressed to His Majesty's Ambassador at Rome my telegram 11131 No. 181 of the 24th July, which was repeated to you under No. 93, and ^®' al instructions as to your reply to the Saudi Government were embodied in my telegram No. 94 of the 26th July. 10. On the 25th July, the Saudi Arabian Minister again called at this Department. He said that he had reported to King Ibn Saud by telegram the s^P! result of his previous interview, and had now received a reply from His Majesty, disclaiming any intention of taking aggressive action against the Imam and kW containing instructions to convey to me the following supplementary information, iwl 11. As His Majesty's Government were aware, an agreement had been iWii reached between King Ibn Saud and the Imam in the winter of 1931-32 regarding ait,tat their common frontier, under which His Majesty had abandoned to the Imam ifMai the Jebel Arwa and all the territory to the south of it, retaining the area known i W as Nejran and all the territory to the north of it in Saudi Arabia. Somewhat :ikM later, a further Saudi mission had been sent to the Yemen to negotiate a general ifk treaty settlement. The Imam, on an unconvincing plea of illness, had kept the mission waiting for thirty-five days without receiving it. Meanwhile, the Asir rebellion had broken out, and the Imam began a gradual occupation of Nejran. LWj] This Saudi mission had achieved nothing; but, after the suppression of the Asir rebellion. King Ibn Saud had agreed with the Imam to pardon the rebel leaders ^ and to allow the Idrisi to remain as a refugee in the northern Yemen on the condition that the Imam undertook to prevent his intriguing against Saudi ,Lj a Arabia. A third Saudi mission had then been sent to the Yemen to try to reach L[ flam a general settlement. It was then that the Imam put forward a demand for j fI J To ' all the Idrisi's dominions.' This claim was no doubt purposely vague, but King Ibn Saud interpreted it as a demand for the whole of Asir. 12. There were now two danger points. The first was in the coastal area, where the Idrisi was collecting supporters in Yemeni territory, whence he might . 1 at any moment make an incursion into Asir; Sheikh Hafiz Wahba did not, how ever, seem to regard this danger as seriously as on the previous occasion. The other danger-point was inland in Nejran; the greater part of Nejran was now -occupied by the Imam's forces. IB. King Ibn Saud regarded Nejran as having been definitely allotted to Saudi Arabia by the frontier arrangement of 1931-32, even though this arrange ment was not a formal treaty. He was now receiving appeals from the people of Nejran, who were suffering from the Yemeni occupation and definitely objected to .Zeidi rule. King Ibn Saud could not ignore these appeals, and, unless he took ;action, Yemeni aggression was likely to continue He therefore felt that he must defend ' Nejran and turn out the Yemeni troops. It was preparatory to taking such action that he desired to know the views and attitude of His Majesty's Government. 14. This latest information communicated by the Saudi Minister appears to put the matter in a somewhat new light. The frontier arrangement of 1931 -32 was apparently a vague one, and it is not clear, either from the information supplied by Sheikh Hafiz Wahba or from that given to Sir Andrew Ryan by Fuad3 .Nif Bey Hamza and reported in Sir Andrew's despatches Nos. 168 and 193 of the ^tfjl Sth June and the 23rd June respectively, that King Ibn Sand's claim that Nejran is definitely to be considered as Saudi territory can necessarily be accepted %ij .as indisputable. It is to be observed that no reference to a settlement on this [11 W point is contained in the official Saudi proclamation regarding the results of the negotiations of 1931, a translation of which was enclosed in Sir Andrew Ryan's stiici despatch No. 486 of the 19th December, 1931. Nor does it appear, from the information at my disposal, that Nejran had in fact been in the effective occu- Btt ■ pation either of King Ibn Sand or of the Imam in recent years. It is, therefore, ulktnot absolutely clear that King Ibn Sand, in contemplating the ejection of the V Yemeni troops from Nejran, can in fact be considered to be defending what is s J, indisputably his own territory in the same way as would be the case if it were Wi! a question of resisting a Yemeni or Idrisi incursion into territory in his K effective occupation. It may, indeed, be that it would be more correct to regard such action by King Ibn Sand as an attempt to occupy territory, the ownership / of which has hitherto been doubtful. Without further information, however, ?i-as to the status and recent history of Nejran it is somewhat difficult to express ^ '.an opinion on this point. W 15. Before taking his leave. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba reverted to the enquiries : : which he had made at the interview recorded in the earlier part of this despatch, * r ^as to the assistance which His Majesty's Government might be able to give to rer: '-King Ibn Sand. He explained that His Majesty had in mind an understanding between himself and His Majesty's Government—which should, however, be ^ - kept strictly secret—by which His Majesty's Government would promise him l, %their moral support and he, on his side, should guarantee all British interests the Yemen should he prove successful against the Imam. In reply to this Wt,statement, the Minister was informed that the arrangement proposed would be ®r:something very like an alliance between the two countries. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba .pit replied that King Ibn Sand did not expect armed assistance from His Majesty's t ill G overnment, but only desired material help in two directions, namely, a loan and tetehe supply of arms. 16. The Minister was informed that, as he was aware, the question of a lialk loan to the Saudi Government was most carefully and sympathetically examined Mtiilast year, when the matter was raised here by the Saudi mission headed by the fajiEmir Feisal, and that it had then been found impossible to accede to the Saudi | ew iGovernment's request. The position in this matter was unchanged. As regards (UgitiJ'the supply of arms, there was no reason, as Sheikh Hafiz Wahba knew, why the Saudi Government should not buy arms from the manufacturers whenever and L ^(Wherever they wished. It appeared, however, that King Ibn Sand was in fact ^suggesting that His Majesty's Government should arrange the supply to him of ' g arms on especialjy favourable terms (to this the Minister agreed); this suggestion ■. appeared to amount in fact to a request for financial facilities in a different form, i and the reply of His Majesty's Government could only be the same as that which ^■^they had been obliged to make to the Saudi Government's request for a loan. lilW filj 0^ offi I am, &amp;c.

Sir John Simon to Sheikh Hafez Wahha. Sir, Foreign Office, July 31, 1933. I HAVE considered the representations, which you made in your interviews here on the 21st and 25th July, regarding a possible outbreak of hostilities between your Government and that of the Yemen, and your requests for information as to the probable attitude of His Majesty's Government in that event. 2. I am not altogether clear as to the circumstances which have led King Abdul Aziz to fear, as I understand to be the case, that such hostilities are imminent and that the prospect of finding means to avoid them is not favourable. His Majesty's Government, anxious as they must always be to see peace preserved in Arabia, would deplore such hostilities, and they welcome the assurances which you have given that King Abdul Aziz is determined to do his utmost to avoid war with the Yemen, and they earnestly trust that his efforts to do so may be successful. 3. As you are aware, I have already suggested to the Italian Government that they should urge counsels of moderation on the Imam of the Yemen and should take all possible measures to secure that no kind of assistance or encouragement is given to the Imam or to the Idrisi from Italian territory of a nature to increase the likelihood of an outbreak of hostilities. I have pleasure in informing you that the Italian Government have now assured me that they will take action in the sense which I had suggested to them. They add that, according to their information, the Imam Yahya has no wish to embark upon a quarrel with King Abdul Aziz. 4. I understand that King Abdul Aziz desires to learn whether, in the event of his finding it necessary to defend his territories against incursion by the Idrisi or by Yemeni troops. His Majesty's Government would be prepared to assist him, either by means of a loan or by supplying him with arms and munitions on especially favourable terms. You are aware that, in response to the request made by the delegation headed by His Eoyal Highness the Emir Feisal, which was sent to this country by King Abdul Aziz last year. His Majesty's Government then considered carefully and sympathetically whether they could give His Majesty any form of financial assistance and that this was unfortunately found to be impossible. The circumstances in this regard remain, I regret to say, unaltered, and His Majesty's Government are therefore unable to accede to the requests of King Abdul Aziz which you have laid before me. It is scarcely necessary for me to add, however, that, should the Saudi Arabian Government arrange to be furnished with arms or munitions by private manu facturers in this country. His Majesty's Government would put no obstacle in the way. ^ . T . 5. His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Jedda reported to me on the 20th July that representations in. regard to this matter had been made to him by the Saudi Government in a generallv similar sense to those which you have made here, and I have instructed Mr. Calvert to convey to your Government a reply on the lines of this note. I have, &amp;c. JOHN SIMON. [851 hh—1]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT eastern (A rabia)./ confident] al. [E 3960/1795/25] fl ^ Jalyj 20, 1933. -m :tion 2. No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—-{Received July 20.) (No. 198.) Sir, Jed da, June 30, 1933. WITH reference to my despatch No. 188 of the 20th June, relative to Hashimite properties in the Hejaz, I have the honour to state that Nasir Bey A1 Gaylani called on me on the 29th June, and left with me copies of two papers, viz., (a) a rescript from the King to the Amir Feisal, as President of the Council of Ministers, and (&amp;) a letter from the Amir, as Minister of the Interior, to the agent of one branch of the Hashimite family. I enclose translations of these papers. Nasir Bey regarded them as eminently satisfactory, and on the face of them they appear to restore very completely the rights of all the Ashraf with one exception. This is the Sherif Khalid-bin-Sadiq, who would appear to be the Sherif Khalid implicated last year in the Ad Dabbagh conspiracy. 2. I consider that the only course now to adopt is to let the interested parties judge by experience whether the decision of the Saudi Government is as favourable as it appears to be on the surface. I have no reason to doubt this, as I believe Ibn Saud to have been genuinely desirous of making a beau geste, but there is just a possibility that subordinates may show themselves less well- disposed. In any case .very definite progress has been made, and I give great credit to the Iraqi representative for his handling of the business. 3. Nasir Bey seemed doubtful about the position as regards the Amir Zeyd, King Hussein's youngest son, who, as you know, has certain interests independent of those of the rest of the family, derived from his Turkish mother. He agreed with my view that he could well afford to await developments in this connexion. In any case, this is a matter of even less concern to His Majesty's Government than the claims of the elder brothers. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad and His Majesty's High Commissioner for Transjordan at Jerusalem. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Ihn Saud to A mir Feisal. {Translation.) {After compliments.) June 6, 1933. IN accordance with the representations submitted to us by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, we give orders for the removal of restrictions on the properties of the Ashraf with the exception of the properties of the Sherif Khalid-bin-Sadiq, and for the restoration of the position to what it was before the recent measures, and to issue instructions to this effect, to the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs and to the Sharia Court, and that the Ashraf may (be allowed to) manage their affairs with their agent as they like.

Royal Legation of Saudi Arabia, Dear Mr. Rendel, London, July 28, 1933. JUST a note to give you the desired information. 1. On the 7th Rajab, 1346 (1927), when our representatives (Ibn Mady and Ibn Duleim) met those of Imam Yehya in Sanaa, our representatives proposed that the eastern frontiers be settled thus : Najran and northwards to belong to King Abdul Aziz, and Wayla and southwards to belong to the Imam; and that the southern frontier of Assir from inland to the sea was to remain as it was. In the meeting held on the 9th Rajab, the Imam's representatives accepted this settlement, except where it related to the Idrissi territory. 2. In a letter from Imam Yehya to King Abdul Aziz in Rabi Thani 1350 (1930-31), in which the Imam claimed Jebel Aro, he based his claim on the agreement reached with Ibn Mady and Ibn Duleim regarding the frontiers. 3. In his cable of the 18th Shawwal, 1351 (1933), to King Abdul Aziz, the Imam asked that there should be no interference with the Yam, again basing his request on the agreement made with Ibn Mady and Ibn Duleim. 4. The people of Najran have been the subjects of King Abdul Aziz for some time. They were also the subjects of his ancestors and still hold the documents they granted to them. These documents have been submitted to King Abdul Aziz, and confirmed by him. Indeed, as late as Ramadan 1351 (January 1933) the people of Najran sent a deputation to Ibn Musaid in Abha reaffirming their submission and renewing their assurances of loyalty. 5. The people of Najran never had any connexion with Imam Yehya or any dealings with him until his recent occupation of their land. I may add that His Majesty King Abdul Aziz has just received a cable from his delegation at Sanaa saying that Imam Yehya still insists on being given the Idrissi territory, and that it is their firm belief that he, Imam Yehya, is bent on aggression. Such being the case. King Abdul Aziz awaits the opinion of the British Government. Yours sincerely, MAHMOOD R. ZADA.

' WITH reference to your circular of the 31st March last, I have the honour to submit a report on personalities in Sa'udi Arabia. It is the first report of the kind since this post became a Legation, as I found it impossible for various reasons to take action on earlier circulars on the subject. 2. You will appreciate the difficulties of compiling such a report in a country like this. Their very nature has made it desirable to err on the side of comprehensiveness, in order to collect in a single document information derived from very scattered sources. I have included persons like provincial governors, of whom very little is known, but who occupy key positions, many of the aliens who crowd the Sa'udi stage, and a certain number of expatriates who have been busy in the wings. In some cases, where relationships are interesting or important, I have dealt with family groups. This gives a confusing appearance to the rather formidable index, but I think that it will contribute to the utility of the report. 3. The report owes much to the researches of Mr. Hope Gill during his stay here, and to the personal knowledge of the Indian vice-consul and certain other members of my staff. 4. The typing of this report has been delayed by pressure of more urgent work. The report contains information up to the end of April 1933, with a small number of additions based on important information received in May. I propose to furnish the lists of amendments, &amp;c., called for in your circular despatch under reference early in 1934, but I would ask to be allowed to postpone this until I have been able to obtain suggestions from the British authorities in the surrounding countries, to whom copies of the report will doubtless be circulated in print. I am already greatly indebted to those authorities for information gleaned from their general intelligence summaries, &amp;c. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW EYAN. Enclosure in No. 1.

Royal Family. (1) 'Abdul- Aziz ibn 'Abdur-Rahmdn al-Feysal dl Sa'ud. —King of Sa'udi Arabia, commonly known as Ibn Sa'ud. Born probably in 1880. Accompanied father on flight from Riyadh upon its occupation by Ibn Rashid in 1891. Grew up under tutelage of Sheykh Mubarak of Kuwait, who gave asylum to family. Seized opportunity in course of local warfare in Eastern Arabia to deliver surprise attack on Riyadh in January 1902 with very small force and retook it. Became recognised head of the family although his father 'Abdurrahman survived until 1928. Extended his authority gradually over whole of Nejd and Qasim and in 1914 took the coastal province of Hasa from the Turks, who then made an agreement with him. Entered into treaty relations with His Majesty's Government through the Govern ment of India in 1915. Took Hail in 1921 and finally destroyed power of Beni Rashid. Next fought King Huseyn, an old enemy. Took Mecca in 1924 and completed conquest of Hejaz by compelling abdication at end of 1925 of Huseyn's son and successor 'Ali. Acquired suzerainty over 'Asir in 1926. Converted position into one of practical sovereignty in 1930 and recently reduced 'Asir to status of ordinary province, following on repression of a rebellion there. Has thus become ruler of territory, seaboards of which extend from just south of 'Aqaba to just north of Medi in Yemen and from Kuwait neutral zone to north of Qatar Peninsula. Ibn Sa'ud has measured his titles by his acquisitions. He became in 1902 Amir of Nejd and Imam of the Wahhabis; in 1921 Sultan of Nejd and its Dependencies; in January 1926 King of the Hejaz; in 1927 King of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies; and finally in September 1932 King of the Kingdom of Sa'udi Arabia, defined as a single and united State, comprising his existing dominions, though without express mention of 'Asir. The hero of this spectacular aggrandisement is a man of fine presence, some 6 foot 3 inches in height and handsome except for a blotch across the left eye due to neglected leucoma. He combines a strong character with courage, much native shrewdness and a charm which, though now a little stereotyped, is still attractive. He is feared rather than loved by his subjects on all of whom except those of the Shi'a persuasion he imposes at least the forms of Wahhabism. His own Wahhabism is sincere, but tempered by a readiness to compromise when his temporal position requires innovations contrary to the prejudice of extremists or sometimes even to the original principles of his sect. On his own ground he is an efficient ruler and a hard one, a Napoleon of the desert, but too much of the desert to cope quite successfully with the problems with which his conquest of the Hejaz and his attainment of an international position have confronted himV 0 B?' In diplomacy he is normally fairly honest, but difficult. He is as well disposed * s towards foreigners as is compatible with his fundamental relief that Islam is all in all. His relations with Great Britain have been mainly friendly, but he is a friend who expects much for love. He has tried a strong constitution very high %«l|by living hard and by innumerable marriages. It was reckoned some years ^ 1 ago that he had already had over 200 wives, though never more than the permitted four at a time. He is thought to find the natural decline in his powers in this direction disconcerting, but seems otherwise a hale man, except for digestive troubles and the effects of nervous strain. §2 Was made a G.C.I.E. in 1920, but does not now greatly prize an honour which he considers too reminiscent of a past connexion with the Government of India only and in some sense vassalish. The King's eldest son Turki died in 1919, leaving issue. The following is a list of the King's immediate relatives,many of whom also have issue. Philby's 1 rabia is 97 probably the best authority on the Sa'ud family as a whole, but does not claim 1 h ; to be absolutely accurate. 23(1! Sons. All Amirs. (2) Sa'ud ibn 'Abdul- Aziz. —Born of a lady of Sa'udi stock. Probably not more than 32, if as much. Has for some years been Viceroy of Nejd and seldom it in leaves it, though he went to consult an oculist in Egypt shortly after the Mahmal incident' of 1926. Was last in the Hejaz in 1930. Said to have had some schooling from Dr. 'Abdullah Damluji and Sheykh Hafiz Wahba, but to be in the main untutored. Eesembles his father in physique and appearance. Also suffers from eye trouble, but has inherited Ibn Sa'ud's ' magnetic smile.' Hp May in other respects be a chip of the old block, but has had little opportunity 5 of displaying his quality to Europeans. Is strongly Islamic and may be more Ufr fanatical than his father. i ii J: Sa'ud is sometimes inaccurately described as Heir Apparent. A report in . J, 1 ''February 1928 that he had been declared to be Ibn Sa'ud's destined successor was ! 1 not confirmed. When the Kingdom was unified in 1932 it was announced that ]fa rule of succession would be established. It is reported that Ibn Sa'ud has since J?designated Sa'ud as his successor and has obtained the assent of the family, [ ' m perhaps also of a wider circle; but no public announcement has been made, —tr P.S.—Sa'ud's designation as Heir to the Throne was formally announced 5 on the Uth May, 19S8. rojdp (3) Faysal ibn 'A bdul-Aziz. —Viceroy of the Hejaz in his father's absence and Mm iii permanently President of the Council of Ministers, Minister for Foreign Affairs, offllthe Interior, and, in theory. War. Born of a lady of the family of 'Abdul-Wahhab in 1# t in or about 1905. Educated partly by Sheykh Hafiz Wahba. Eeported intelligent . Ltlnitand has at least had more opportunity than his brothers of cultivating his .ggioiii intelligence and powers of observation as he has lived mostly of late years in jioij^the comparatively civilised surroundings of Mecca and has travelled in Europe; Jifin 1919, when he was in England; in 1926 when he visited England, France, Holland and perhaps other countries; and in 1932 when he headed the Sa'udi tl mission which visited London and many other capitals. In physique a much feebler version of his father and elder brother owing to excessive delight in the i 1 !:„ 1 harem from his youth upwards; possibly also to the use of alcohol and possibly | to a tubercular tendency, though neither is proved. Very listless and rather 3r I nervous in European company, but can rise to an occasion, as he showed in 1932 by playing his part in London, albeit that of a figurehead, with a good deal of ■ -distinction. His decorum is not known to have broken down until he reached ^ • Kuwait, where his indulgence in night-life scandalised the Sheykh and his subjects. Is supposed to have succumbed much to Syrian influences, though he seems to have got tired of Fuad Hamza during their grand tour and there have been recent signs of diminished intimacy between them. Believed not to see eye to eye with his father and joined in the onslaught by Fuad, Philby and others f ^ on Ibn Sa'ud's principal henchman 'Abdullah Suleyman in October 1931 gpro® 1 ; Although 'Abdullah Suleyman had the best of this in the end, the King has adice 01 continued to treat Faysal with consideration. Eeceived many decorations during lishis tour in 1932, including an honorary G.B.E. (4) Muhammad ibn * Abdul- Aziz. —Aged about 21. Headed the Sa'udi forces which entered Medina in 1925. Was made acting Viceroy when the AmirFaysal went abroad in 1932, but got beyond himself and was replaced by his brother Khalid. Met Faysal at Kuwait on his return and shared in the bout of dissipation there. (5) Khdlid ibn 'Abdul-*Aziz. —Aged about 18. Acted as Viceroy of the ^ Hejaz in 1932 (see (4) above). (6) to (18). Children of 16 and less. The names and order of age are not , quite certain. The following is an approximately correct list in alphabetical order, from various sources: 'Abdullah, 'Abdul-Muhsin, 'Abdur-Rahman, Bandar, Fahad, Mansur, Mash'aL Musa'id, Mutayyib, Nasir, Sa'd, Sultan^ '^0 Talal. Two of them, Mash'al and Sultan, are said to be adopted sons, of the ^itj, 1 family of the Beni Rashid (q.v.). 1^0 Brothers. All Amirs. F? (19) Muhammad ihn 'A bdurrahmdn. —Said to be a little older than the King 'S Di and to be a hard and stubborn man on whom Ibn Sa'ud keeps a tight rein, ' fas Reported in 1926-27 to be a fanatical Wahhabi, married to a daughter of Ibn fj to re(li Bujad (q.v.); to be in sympathy with the extremists, whose opposition to Ibn Sa'ud was then growing; and to have left Mecca in anger. Was, nevertheless, in charge at Riyadh in autumn of 1926, and was said to have got increased powers w] there. Now seldom heard of except on the occasion of journeys between Mecca f J nl] , and Riyadh. Might play a role in the event of his surviving the King, though ^ ! said to have acquiesced in proposal in 1932 to make Sa'ud heir. Has several sons, one of whom is married to a daughter of the King. pW (20) 'Abdullah ibn 'Abdurrahman. —Aged about 40. Described as neat and Lrof' spruce in appearance and as ambitious in character, so that King keeps him also well in hand. Seems to like ships, as he visited H.M.S. Emerald by special kterGc request in 1926 and H.M.S. Clematis with King's younger sons in 1928. Lgfe (21) and (22) Ahmed and Musd'id. —Younger lads of under 20, the children -n'isir of the old age of 'Abdurrahman ibn Faysal. . . j. 9 f t'j 7 A 1 A A pASS Arazf Branch. Also Amirs. Certain of the King's cousins are dealt with in separate notices, but a general mention may be made of the 'Araif as being members of a senior branch . of the family by virtue of descent from Sa'ud ibn Faysal, an elder brother of the f jLJ, King's father and a former ruler at Riyadh. Their generic name of 'Araif is one applied to raided camels, subsequently ' recognised,' as the root implies, and ■'' recovered by their owners. It seems to have been given to them because they had Kre ^ remained in the hands of the Beni Rashid, but escaped to Ibn Sa'ud in the course i! ™ of battle in 1904. Some of them rebelled against him in 1910, but the present ** members of the family form portion of the King's posse of satellite princes. Although inconspicuous, they might produce a claimant, by right of senior ^Aiigi descent, to the throne. Various names are given in the Almanach de Gotha and Ws. Philby's Arabia. The most important of these princes, who bear individually the surname of al-'Arafa, would appear to be— i-Mi (23) Sa'ud ibn 'Abdul-'Aziz ibn Sa'ud ibn Faysal. —Married the King's ^ I1()ri sister Nura. Seems to play a certain role in Ibn Sa'ud's entourage. Probably L the same Sa'ud al-'Arafa who was described in a recent report from Kuwait as '; J *! being, according to a reliable informant, a friend of the 'Ajman tribe and ':%of' secretly hostile to Ibn Sa'ud. Pi ion 2. 'Abdul-'Aziz ibn Ibrahim. Governor of Medina. Little is known of this official except that he is believed to come from Hail and is of considerable age. Has the reputation of being a severe and arbitrary Governor. mm - %e' 3. 'Abdul-'Aziz ibn Mu'ammar. Governor of Jedda. A young man of apparently not more than 30. Comes of a former ruling family, probably of part of Qasim, but was brought up principally at Riyadh. Was Governor of Yanbu' for some time and earned a good reputation there. Was appointed to Jedda in August 1932, with the title || e r of Amir, on the death of Hajji 'Abdullah 'Ali Riza, a leading local merchant who had been governor with the old title of Qaimmaqam since King Huseyn's time. Ibn Mu'ammar seems likely to be a successful governor. He is good- |b wLrlft ' looking and pleasant, but pretentious, probably on the score of his blue blood. He h * is keen on riding and other forms of sport, and promised to try his hand at polo ^ ^ on receiving from Mr. Hope Gill a parting gift of sticks and balls in return for I , a dog's-head walking stick. Seems reasonably intelligent for a young man of his ^upbringing. Not related to Ibrahim ibn Mu'ammar {q.v.). ^4. * Abdul-' Aziz ihn Musd'id. 5^ Second cousin to the King. Governor of Hail since 1925 or earlier. Said by l: the Sheykh of Kuwait in March 1932 to be only 40, but to have aged greatly owing to worry. Was much in evidence in 1929 as one of the King's right-hand men at the time of the Akhwan rebellion. Came into prominence in February i 1930, when, apparently without the King's authority, he conducted a raid on the ^scale' of a punitive expedition, which it was, in fact, intended to be, into ee N Trans Jordan. Disavowed by the King at the time, but maintained in his a % governor ate. Was in November 1932 put at the head of the principal force ^ despatched to reduce the 'Asir rebels, and proceeded from Eiyadh to 'Abha and 28,%jizan, where he assumed supreme command of the forces in 'Asir. Said then to ^be intended for the Governorate-General of the whole 'Asir area, but now unlikely ?sbito remain longer than may be necessary to clean up and reorganise it. A man for fcftoccasions requiring drastic action. Ha# 5. 'Abdul-'Aziz ibn Shuheyl. Governor of Tebuk in or about 1929. Probably, despite a discrepancy of 0 Sname, the same ibn Shuheyl of al-'Aridh in Nejd who took over that governorate ! in 1926. Later Governor of Turaba. Appointed Governor of Taif in September ^1932. Commanded the troops sent from Taif in connexion with the repression of 'the revolt in 'Asir in November-December 1932, and has since been concerned in the arrangements which it was hoped would end in the surrender of Hasan al-Idrisi to Ibn Sa'ud. atei^ &gt;Abdul-'Aziz {ibn Hamud) ibn Zeyd. !'■ Inspector of Beduin in Transjordan frontier area. Probably about 40. Comes of a Hail family said to be related to the Beni Rashid. Said to have been educated in Constantinople. Sent to 'Amman in summer of 1926 to discuss ie l ct ;claims in respect of raids, and attended with two other Sa'udi delegates an abortive conference at Ma'an in September. Was one of the two Sa'udi delegates ^ l! on tribunal which sat at Jericho from February to May 1927 in accordance with • the Hadda Agreement. Was later an Assistant Governor of Jedda. Sent to 'Amman in August 1930 as Sa'udi agent at the MacDonnell investigation )' ^ regarding raids. Appointed Inspector of Beduin in the frontier region in January 1931, and has since the 3rd June, 1931, held meetings at long intervals ten with Captain Glubb, his opposite number in Transjordan. Personally amiable, but will take no responsibility without reference to the King. 0- 7. 'Abdul-Kerim ibn Rummdn. ft I# Governor of Teima. Little information is available about this man, whose family is not mentioned in the 1917 volume on personalities in Arabia. Seems to be important more as a town Sheykh than as a person having necessarily much influence with Beduin, according to a statement made by the Sheykh of Kuwait in 1932. Said to have maintained the quasi-independence of the Teima oasis even ^against Ibn Sa'ud. Came into some prominence at the time of the Ibn Rifada rebellion in 1932, when he appealed to the Amir 'Abdullah, with whom he appears to have been in correspondence previously, for assistance against the danger of attack by the Akhwan mobilised to repress the rebellion. Reported to be still defiant in January 1933, when he disobeyed the King's order to return , | certain land to a man who had appealed to the King, and imprisoned the man ^ instead, possibly, it was suggested, because he thought the man likely to murder ^ him with the Royal approbation. Kjjl8. 'Abdullah ibn Blayhid. A leading figure among the Wahhabi Ulema. Comes from Hail. Qadhi of ^ | Mecca after its occupation by Ibn Sa'ud, and was described in Eldon Rutter's8 account of him (1925-26) as a 'bent and wizened little man.' Appointed jjofa Grand Qadhi of the Hejaz in January 1926. Was instrumental in May 1926 in obtaining a fatwa from seventeen Ulama of Medina in support of the Wahhabi Lfcia policy of destroying tombs. Head of the Nejdi delegates at the Moslem Congress i of June 1926. Again visited Medina in November of that year in attendance on 1 the King and in the company of 'Abdullah ibn Hasan (see 16 (1)), bent on jiju purging the place of iniquity as Mecca had been purged. Vacated post at Mecca * in 1928 and returned to Hail. Was thought at that time to favour the extremists ^ of the Akhwan movement. Still visits Mecca at intervals. Thought to be ■I 1511 embarrassing in high places owing to his frankness and fanaticism. Signed the ^ pronouncement by the Ulama of Nejd in favour of Jihad at the time of the Ibn Rifada rebellion in 1932. gdS' 9. 'Abdullah ihn Jiluwi. m m Governor of Hasa. A first cousin of the King's late father. About the i jgp same age as the King, whom he has served consistently since he helped him to mo : recapture Riyadh in 1902. Bore a part in the wars subsequent to that event. Stated by Philby to have been appointed Governor-General of Qasim in 1908, but has been employed in Hasa for several years past. Said to have been instrumental yfi in 1927 in arresting temporarily the rising discontent of the Wahhabi extremists, f Faysal ad-Dawish, &amp;c., in Nejd. Has the reputation of being a strong and severe ,n i Governor. Corresponds with the Sheykh of Bahrain and seems to keep in touch with some of the Trucial Sheykhs. iteof liiallw! 10. 'Abdullah Kdzim. Ljsck A Hejazi said to be of Cossack origin. About 50 or a little more. Was employed in the Mecca Post Office in King Hussein's time. Appointed Sa'udi jAW Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs in 1926 and still holds the post. Went Mi to Port Sudan in March 1926 as one of Ibn Sa'ud's delegates to negotiate about ptol the E.T.C. cable and showed himself an obstructive negotiator. Was again pretty Wft sticky in taking delivery of Marconi wireless in 1931-33. ihm igbssa 11. 'Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn 'Aqil. ■ In 1926 Governor of Jauf, but had vacated the post by March 1928, when he J was put in command of a force sent to quell the disturbance created at Wejh by Hamid ibn Rifada. Probably identical with the ibn 'Aqil who was mentioned in f W May 1931 as a possible candidate for the governorship of Tebuk, but was not n ' T appointed. 'Abdullah ibn 'Aqil commanded the Akhwan mobilised in June 1932 W &lt; to repress the further rebellion of Hamid ibn Rifada. r u 12. 'A bdullah ibn Muhammad al-Fadhl. Rjj Vice-President of the Legislative Council. Probably rather over 50. ^ofofc Principal member of the Fadhl family q.v. Was formerly a merchant in Jedda. Described in 1917 as ' anti-Sherif and pro-English' and as going by the sobriquet of ' Englisi ' in Jedda. Put in prison at that time in Mecca for some unknown offence. Played no particular role subsequently (and was so little valued t for brain-power as to be known as ' the Sheep ') until ex-King 'Ali sent him on i g ,! a delegation to negotiate with Ibn Sa'ud at Mecca. Went over definitely to . Ibn Sa'ud and acted as his representative at Rabigh for the 1925 pilgrimage, in which employment he is said to have feathered his nest. Attached to the King's - m( son, Muhammad, as adviser when the young 'Amir occupied Medina later in 1925. Figured as a Hejazi delegate at the Moslem Congress in Mecca in June 1926. ^ Obtained about the same period, in partnership with Indians settled in Mecca, Ijiowii a contract for motor transport, but lost it. Did better as purveyor to the ^isni;. Government. Sent on an unsuccessful mission to Eritrea in 1927 in connexion i jj, with negotiations for the recognition of Ibn Sa'ud by Italy and proposed treaty W 1 ! ( arrangements. Also had some part in the treaty negotiations with Great Britain, i J Became assistant to the Viceroy at Mecca and so on to appointment to his present L post in or before 1929. A/Vent in that year on a mission to Persia. Alleged in ;s||L J? the same year to have done nicely in the company of 'Abdullah Suleyman by L ^ cornering benzine, &amp;c., Just before new duties were imposed. Appears to enjoy u the King's confidence in a high degree and to steer an even or waggly course L ^ii between rival factions. Not impressive in appearance or conversation; still 'W somewhat of a sheep; but wears his recent dignities with an acquired air of dignity, sobriety and sagacity, which may be a part of his success. May still ring, have commercial interests, but has long been dissociated from the business of the ' 161 other Fadhls. r oiirtt 13. 'A Mullah an-Nafisi. •JlJ | Important as being Ibn Sa'ud's agent at Kuwait, where he is established as % v a merchant and once did a large business in rice, &amp;c. Now elderly and less active. ^ at liSeems sensible. 14. 'A hdullah Suleymdn al Bassdm. A Nejdi, presumably a member of the Bassam family of 'Aneyza, described in Philby's ' Arabia ' as having been formerly staunch adherents of Ibn Rashid. ^Appointed Inspector-General of Customs in 1930. Was said then to be a eil tlot penniless man of no character who had lived for two years as the guest of his Jasiiiii namesake the Minister of Finance. Now said to be on very bad terms with the hiil latter. Another al Bassam was mentioned in October 1932 as the consignee of atlilif; goods shipped from India to Uqair. 'Strong stoy 15. 'Abdullah ibn Suleymdn al Hamddn. Minister of Finance. Aged about 46. Of plebeian 'Aneyza origin. Started life in a small way with the Qusaibis, originally, it is said, as a coffee-boy. Spent ten years as clerk in their Bombay office. Returned to Nejd some twenty years Me i ago. Said to have gone bankrupt as a broker. Recommended by the Qusaibis to Appoil replace his brother, who had died, as a clerk in the King's Diwan. Rose to be Isieihead of the Diwan. Became Director-General of Finance and had acquired toiiegi complete control of all financial matters by September 1928, when it was remarked Was»hat he travelled in greater state than the King himself between Mecca and Jedda. Has since been the most powerful of the King's advisers. His position was strongly assailed in October 1931 by a cabal, which included the Amir Faysal y Fuad Hamza, 'Abdullah al Fadhl (perhaps a doubtful enemy) and Mr. Philby. Was sent for a time to lend a hand with the Tawil mission in Hasa, but had his rc ^' : place kept warm for him and returned to it. Was promoted in August 1932 'eatedi! f roni being Director-General of Finance to the post of Minister of Finance for the toe Hejaz and Nejd and its Dependencies, thus obtaining the title of Wazir, hitherto MM 1 enjoyed only by the Amir Faysal. Continues to be supreme in the financial isedii administration and has his finger in many other pies, being in effect Comptroller of the Privy Purse, Grand Master of Ordnance, Quarter-Master-General on occasion, general manager of the King's establishment of slaves and pilgrimage- organiser. Probably entirely faithful to the King, whose needs he supplies at the expense of others having demands on the Treasury. A man of rather mean Iw appearance, but emphatically a 'live wire.' Ready and energetic in conversation and full of ideas about development. Detested by Fuad Hamza and not loved by many. Has for some time been very friendly with the Indian vice-consul, and has asf of late been at pains to cultivate relations with His Majesty's Minister. Has f 8 !, enriched himself and has built a pretentious house outside Jedda, which the King ^ made use of in April 1933. Has provided posts for two relatives, viz., his brother ^ Hamad {q.v.) and Muhammad, Director of the condensers at Jedda. ^ , 16. Ahdul-Wahhdb, Descendants of. : f t The following seem to be the most notable of the descendants of the founder of Wahhabism :— prf (1) 'Abdullah ibn Rasan. —Is one of the leading Wahhabi Ulema in Mecca. 0 Played a role in 1926, with 'Abdullah ibn Blayhid {q.v.), in the Wahhabi purging jjif! of the Holy Cities, and was in 1929 thought, like him, to favour the Akhwan jjjjifi!' extremists. Signed the pronouncement of the Ulama in favour of Jihad at the time of the Ibn Rifada rebellion in 1932. Now Grand Qadhi. Proud and fanatical. ujjSl (2) Muhammad ibn 'Abdul- Aziz ibn Sheykh, nicknamed as-Sahabi, formerly up#; Governor of Taif, transferred to Riyadh in 1932 as Assistant to the Amir Sa'ucL 14 [8861] c10 (3) 'A hdul-Latif Family. —Four sons and a probable grandson of a descendant named 'Abdul-Latif were among the ten signatories of the declaration i'L of Jihad referred to under (1). No. (2) and the mother of the Amir Faysal (q.v) ft also probably belong to this connexion. k 17. 'A bdul- Wahhdb, Seyyid. A man of 50 or over. Holds the post of Naib-al-Haram at Mecca. Was ^ formerly Deputy for 'Asir in the Ottoman Parliament, but has never been there. M 111 Of no apparent political importance, but a familar figure in high circles. A jolly little pock-marked man, whose deserved reputation as a raconteur is set off by his appearance. 18. '/I hdul-Wahhdh Abu Malha. Iliiil^ A personage of consequence in 'Asir, possibly of the Sheykhly family of Malha near Sabya, although this cannot be affirmed. Was described in 1927 as Director of Finance in 'Asir, and was in that year one of four delegates sent by Ibn Sa'ud to negotiate with the Imam Yahya. Probably still has the title of f Director of Finance and commanded the Sa'udi forces which entered Sabya in ^ November 1932. p®^ 1 19. '^4 bdur-rauf as-Sabbdn. tiilp i4 Born in the Hejaz forty to forty-five years ago. Grandson of an immigrant ^ from Egypt. Educated in the Hejaz and in Egypt. Associated with his father, L e t] Hasan, and others in what was in 1917 the principal hide and skin business in Jedda and Mecca. Impressed the Hejazis at that time by his knowledge and European manners. Was made Director of Education in Jedda, but was dismissed and 110 reverted to trade in cotton goods and skins. Edited in 1925 the anti-Sa'udi paper * Al-Umma in Cairo with the help of one of the Dabbaghs. Given a post by the Amir 'Abdullah as manager of his estates in Transjordan in or before 1931. Was ^ an active supporter of the Hizb-al-Ahrar al Hijazi, and was concerned in 1932 in the press propaganda and financial arrangements of the outside promoters of movements against Ibn Sa'ud. Seems to have gone at least once to Eritrea in this iitit connexion. Was dismissed by the Amir 'Abdullah in the autumn of 1932 as a mi\ result of these political activities, but went on with them. Now excluded from ti % Egypt, Palestine and Transjordan, and has retired to Bagdad. Seems to be one a f i| of the most energetic of Ibn Sa'ud's Hejazi enemies abroad, and may be expected to continue his efforts, wherever he is. I ■ :il 8 20. Ahmed 'Abdullah 'Ayshdn. I'lltt Stated to have brought money from Transjordan to Aden in April 1932 for ij Huseyn ad-Dabbagh. Presumably a member of the Mecca family, two members of which were mentioned in 1917, one as a wealthy merchant, the other, a young . man of 20 named ' 'Abdullah ibn 'Ashan ' (perhaps identical with the subject of this notice), who associated with King Huseyn's sons and was specially intimate ^ with the Amir Abdullah. 'Abdullah 'Ayshan is one of the persons now excluded from Egypt, Palestine and Transjordan on account of other anti-Sa'udi activities. lf ^ pisioi 21. Ahmed Sa'id al-Kurdi. Director of Police in Jedda. Presumably of Kurdish origin, perhaps distilled through Syria. Was previously Director of Police at Rabigh and gave offence to the Legation by trying to commandeer a car which was taking the Nawab of Bahawalpur to Medina. Was transferred to Jedda in 1932 and confirmed in the post early in 1933. Is said to have stated that he would know how to put the fear ^ of God into the inhabitants of Jedda. Is believed to be anti-foreign, but has not ^ ^ yet put the fear of God, further than it already exists, into the European community. Seems to be supported by persons in high quarters, including &gt;,3 probably Mehdi Bey {q.v), and, not improbably, the Amir Faysal and Fuad Bey Hamza. A man to watch but not to judge too hastily. Rides a horse, a thing now : ^ unusual in Jedda, and looks well on it. ^ in f lint iiiDl* IH 4;11 !NJ ofii;.: 22. 'All al 'Amdri. Hj|| Of Nejdi origin, but settled in the Hejaz before Ibn Sa'ud conquered it. Probably about 50. Formerly a merchant. Became Director of Customs in Jedda in 1926 and, later, Inspector-General of Customs. Feathered his nest and put a good deal of money into building a house, which he presented or sold to the King, but for which, if the latter is the case, he has never been paid. This is the house 1 atycalled the 'Green Palace' outside Jedda. Appointed member of an s %y Inspectorate of Government Departments in 1930 and Assistant Governor of Jedda early in 1931. Exercised some authority in this post, but does not appear e,lr isii to count for much nowadays. Probably a rascal, but cheery even now that he has gone poor again. 23. 'Alt Ridha Family (or Reza as they spell it themselves in English). ^ ,, A rich merchant family in Jedda, of Persian origin. Have very important ^■'i business connexions in India and elsewhere, and are agents for the Turner JSC !p Morrison Line, which has a monopoly of transporting pilgrims from India by I J 1 ; 1 : sea. The best known members of the family were Zeynal 'All Eidha, who died ai some years ago, his son Qasim, formerly a M.P. in Turkey and a man of parts, leil W|and 'Abdullah 'All Ridha, who combined business with the post of Governor of Jedda from King Huseyn's time until he died in 1932. The principal members of the family now in Jedda are :— (1) Yusuf ihn Zeynal 'All Ridha, a pleasant man of 45 or 50, who has been in of ^ much in India; and iediitiH Muhammad ihn 'Abdullah 'Ali Ridha, a bullet-headed but agreeable lad ^ of little more than 20. edgei!; Other members of the family are met with elsewhere. The family has Syrian wasiiifamily connexions, 'Abdullah having married a Syrian or Syro-Persian lady, and eaitiSj his son Mohammad having married last year the daughter of a well-known but imif decayed Syrian merchant in Jedda, Sadiq al Khoja. The latter is also connected •befoul with Huseyn Awayni (q.v.). con Mm 24- A li Taha. xtoErl Assistant Governor of Jedda since 1928, and, in addition. Assistant Under- itimcff Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs since early in 1932. A Hejazi of Wt about 40. Rose from a small post as secretary to the Governor. Cadaverous i Sb and unhealthy, with a mouthful of gold teeth. Speaks Turkish well. Well meaning, and not without intelligence, but frightened of his own shadow. Completely ineffective, except on the rarest possible occasions, in connexion with foreign affairs. Normally serves as no more than a transmitter of messages to and from Mecca. 25. M. Amin Shanqiti. miljtit: Said to be a recent import from Shanqit, somewhere in North-West Africa, ^ofc, At one time resided in Mecca, and became later a member of the Idrisi's Council, J# apparently with the sanction of Ibn Sa'ud. Was a signatory in this capacity of jg p ec i|; the decision which signed 'Asir away to Ibn Sa'ud in October 1930. Latterly ! SODS ifi concerned in anti-Sa'udi activities in connexion with 'Asir. Came to notice in 10; that connexion in July 1932, when it was reported that he had returned to 'Amman from Damascus, whither he had gone on the Amir 'Abdullah's business and to be a bone of contention between the Amir and his Government. Seems to have been back in 'Asir at the time of the rebellion of November-December 1932. 26. M. A min Tamimi. Dg A Palestinian from Hebron, son of an official at Tulkaram. Came to the }(# Hejaz in 1927. Had known Fuad Hamza in Palestine, and was employed by rf him in the Sa'udi Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Attached to Sheykh 'Abdul- 0' 'Aziz Ibn Zeyd for the purpose of the MacDonnell enquiry, and left with him in August 1930. Fell out with his chief, and was accused inter alia oi selling a cypher. Returned separately to the Hejaz and was re-employed in the Ministry jajii; for Foreign Affairs. Was probably still protected by Fuad Hamza, but left the )$/ Ministry in or about May 1931, and served for a short time with Sharqieh [8861] c 212 * Icoiif ill Bo ear ®(1 (Limited) in Jedda. Was by then very much under a cloud, and, according to his own story, had to use a ruse to get away on the 6th August, 1931. He had been accused of some irregularity in accounts, and may already have been under .suspicion of stealing documents. Tried later to sell certain copies of British 1 i secret papers to the Embassy in Constantinople. Surrendered these voluntarily to the Residency at Cairo in June 1932, but may still possess Sa'udi documents A very nasty young man, unlikely to return to Sa'udi Arabia, but worth ; mentioning because of his approaches to British authorities elsewhere. Was 1^! mentioned by the Amir 'Abdullah to General Wauchope, on the 6th September, ^ 1932, as one of a number of important and dangerous members of the , ^ ?i Independence party in Palestine, against whom precautions should be taken. ■ 27. 'A qil Family of Mecca. 9 , ifj It is difficult to place various bearers of the name of 'Aqil, who may or may not be related to the Muhammad ibn 'Aqil, mentioned in 1917 as a respectable Mecca merchant, whose grandfather, a learned and holy man, had prophesied that the English would take Mecca. A person of the same name, one of a Hadhrami * family deported from Mokalla in 1928, died at Aden in 1931, leaving sons of ^ whom one, viz. ^ (1) 'Isa ihn Muhammad ihn 'Aqil was secretary to the Imam's son, Ahmed. ^ More definitely connected with Mecca are the following :— • Ishuy ibn 'Aqil, said to be son of a sister of Huseyn liili ad-Dabbagh. Arrested at Mecca in June-July 1932 and deported to Eiyadh. | Lfl (3) 'Ahhds 'Aqil, one of the conspirators against Ibn Sa'ud, said to have : 1 come on pilgrimage with two other conspirators and to have gone later to Mokalla to buy cartridges at Bir Ali. The last-named may be identical with— (4) 'A qil 'A hhds Bardaghash, mentioned in reports from Aden as a Meccan or, according to others, an 'Asiri, associated with the Dabbaghs. 28. Ba-Juhayr Family. t i £ 1 1 P ortant merchant family among the numerous Hadhramis settled in Jedda. The most important present member of it, Ahmed Ba-Jubayr, was suspected m 1932 of complicity in the ad-Dabbagh plot, and was arrested and deported to Riyadh m June-July, but was subsequently allowed to return. A&amp; he had apparently been born in the Hadhramaut, it became a question whether the Legation should intervene, but his relatives themselves very sensibly oreferred that it should not. J F 29. Ba-Ndjd Family. A mcrehant family of humble Hadhrami origin, long settled in the Heiaz. They have considerable property in Egypt, and are still wealthy. The principal members are the following:— ^ r r (l) 'Ahdur-Rahmdn, the patriarch. Probably over 70, and lives a retired lite, but is still going strong as a man of business. T .. {%) Ahmed, son of (1), had quarrelled with him before 1917. Was Kmg Huseyn s Minister of Finance in that year, and was ridiculed for his airs, besides being condemned for his private vices. Returned to Egypt, but returned to tne xiejaz m lUo^. (3) M. Sdlih Ba-Ndjd, another son. (4) Sufydn Ba-Ndjd, a slave of the family, but now sole manager of the property. He was treasurer to (2) whilst he was Minister. Is a Jedda notable; lives a quiet lite and is respected, though he is a slave. All these are well-known in Jedda, where (4) is concerned in a motor ^ transport concern. The family appear to enjoy considerable favour under the %]( present regime. 1 30. Ba-Sdhi Family of 'A sir. The principal member of this Hadhrami family, Muhammad Yahya, played 'ilife an important role m Asir at the time of the Great War. They would appear |Q Itai iitj % 1 m13 7. i s ur ik to be still people of consequence there, as three of them were concerned in the arrangements for the practical annexation of 'Asir by Ibn Sa'ud in October 1930, co{)i es j -viz. (1) Muhammad Yahya 'Awadh Ba-Sdhi. —A member of the Legislative a lt Council which signed the decision. Probably the same as the person named above. ^alM Seems to have tried to dissuade the Idrisi from revolting in October 1932. (2) 'Abdul-Qddir ibn Muham7riad ibn 'Awadh Ba-Sdhi, also a member of % the Legislative Council. Seems to have helped to get the Idrisi to fall in with % the plans of the Dabbagh conspirators in 1932. (3) Muhammad 'A bdullah Ba-Sdhi. —One of the Idrisi mission sent to Mecca to complete the arrangements for annexation in 1930. 31. Bujdd (or Humayd) Family. [J ^ A leading family in the notoriously fanatical Ghutghut section of the 'Ateyba tribe. A confusing effect is produced by the use in past reports of the names ^ S Sultan ibn Bujad, ibn Humayd ibn Bujad and ibn Bujad tout court, but they would appear all to apply to one and the same man. This is assumed in what ^ follows regarding:— (1) Sultdn ibn Humayd ibn Bujdd. —Once one of Ibn Sa'ud's stalwarts and one of the commanders of his troops when they took Mecca in 1924. Had a daughter married to the King's brother Muhammad. Noted early in 1927 as one of the extremists who were then inclining against the King. Became reconciled 1 with him later, but finally stood in with Ibn Sa'ud's opponents in the Nejd i , m rebellion of 1929 and was accounted second only to Faysal ad-Dawish in importance. Was one of the earlier leaders to fall into the King's hands and was imprisoned at Riyadh in the spring of that year. Appears to be still in close confinement, as no record has been found of the death of Sultan ibn Bujad, the best known of the names cited above, and ibn Humayd ' was mentioned u, in a recent report as one of the prisoners who were receiving more lenient i mk treatment than before, though, unlike the others, he was still not allowed to see lb his womenfolk. May still prove important, as he had a strong hold on his tribesmen, some of whom have been reported sullen over his imprisonment. (2) Naif ibn Faysal ibn Humayd. —A pretender to the chieftainship of the frr 'Ateyba, but moved to 'Iraq in 1924, having been ousted by No. (1). Played with f M the idea of recovering his position in June 1929 and sent a minor relative, 'Obeyd, ™ to spy out the land, but was apparently dissuaded by King Faisal from going ahead. Mentioned in 1932 as being still a refugee in 'Iraq and as a possible aqiidii agpiraiit to the hand of Mazyuna, sister of iaysal ad-Dawish, but the jseisi engagement or marriage was denied. 32. Dabbdgh Family. A Mecca family of £ 'Moorish' {i.e., some North-West Africa) origin, jttkfe Appear to be Seyyids. Became prominent in 1932 in connexion with plot behind ill, lithe revolt of Ibn Eifada and the preparations for the retarded revolt in Asir. The family is numerous. Certain members of it still reside in the Hejaz, including two who were arrested and deported to Riyadh in June-July 1932, jiz. :■— (1) Ibrahim ibn 'Abdullah and (2) 'Isa ibn 'Abdullah. More important are the following persons abroad :— (3) Huseyn ibn 'Abdullah, brother of the above. Migrated to Mokalla in or about 1926. Has since done school-mastering in South-West Arabia and has been an active intriguer against Ibn Sa'ud. Went to India in 1927 to enlist support for the Hizb-al-Ahrar al Hijazi and their National Pact. Sought, and probably enlisted, the support of Shauqat Ali, who, with his brother, had been jji violently at loggerheads with Ibn Sa'ud at the Moslem Congress of June 1926. gt Went to Egypt and perhaps to Transjordan in 1929. Said to have attended ^ Moslem Congress at Jerusalem in December 1931, when persons concerned in Hizb-al-Ahrar seem to have devised a pendant organisation called Jami'at ad Dif'a lil Hijaz. Was using Aden as base early in 1932, but left in summer gi owing to adverse attitude of British authorities and seems to have since worked mainly in Eritrea. Now excluded from Egypt, Palestine and Transjordan.14 (4) M. 'AU ihn 'Abdullah, another brother. Less conspicuous, but also very active. Took a hand in the actual revolt in 'Asir. Reported drowned at Jizan, but report was contradicted later. (5) M. Tdhir ihn Mas'ud, uncle of the above. Born in 1890. Had some employment under King Huseyn. Obtained British-protected passport at Cairo in 1926 on strength of alleged subjection to Sultan of Mokalla. Author of letter from Lahej to Amir Shakir of the 20th February, 1932, which fell into hands of Sa'udi Government and revealed plans of conspirators. Seems to have gone further east, as he arrived at Aden from Singapore early in June 1932. Has since been very mobile, visiting Eritrea, Egypt, Palestine, Transjordan and 'Iraq. Now excluded from Egypt, Palestine and Transjordan. Was understood in January 1933 to be heading back to Massawa, and perhaps thence to Aden and the Hadhramaut. Other members of the family need not be enumerated, but they all seem to hang together and to have attaches with Hashimites. One, Mas'ud, a hanger-on at 'Amman, was closely concerned in the Ibn Rifada affair and was killed with fuii Ibn Rifada. The family also have attaches with the Idrisis, although there is ^ti nothing to explain one mention of (3) above as Huseyn bin 'Abdullah ad-Dabbagh al-Idrisi. 33. Dawish Family. \ A leading family in the Mutayr tribe. Its best-known member, Faysal ad- Dawish, famous as a raider, as one of Ibn Sa'ud's principal lieutenants and as a rebel against him, died as a State prisoner at Riyadh in October 1931. His name is, however, still potent in Eastern Arabia, where he was regarded as more than an ordinary sheykh—a kingly man and a king maker. This gives importance to his sons, two of whom have figured in recent reports from Kuwait. (1) Bandar ihn Faysal ad-Dawish. —Still a young man. Said to be looked to by the Mutayr as the leader they desire, but to be himself very cautious and unwilling to move at present. Reported in December 1932 to have countered a question by Ibn Sa'ud as to whom the Mutayr wanted for a leader by saying cc No one but Your Majesty.' (2) Al-Humaydi ihn Faysal ad-Dawish. —Visited Ibn Sa'ud at Riyadh in the autumn of 1932, when the King was making efforts to reconcile the ex-rebel Mutayr and 'Ajman, still hostile to him, and was well received and rewarded. The ladies of this family seem to count. The political agent at Kuwait, who had befriended them when Faysal was surrendered to Ibn Sa'ud in January 1930, was visited by various of them on several occasions in 1932. They included Faysal's mother, who hid bitter hatred of the King beneath copious praises; a sister, whose rumoured marriage to a Harb Sheykh was regarded as an augury of reconciliation between his tribe and the Mutayr, but was afterwards denied, and a cousin, still a woman of considerable charm and humour, who had been married to Sheykh Mubarak of Kuwait, to a deceased son of Faysal ad-Dawish and, lastly, as prize of war, to Ibn Sa'ud's brother 'Abdullah. 34. Dehlavi Family. An Indian family long settled in Mecca. Wahhabis by faith. Still British, but allowed to own real property, and so much identified with the Hejaz that two members of it sat as representatives in the National Conference of June 1931. They were— (1) 'Abdullah Dehlavi, elder brother (about 57 years old); under Sherifian regime was member of various committees; is a trusted adviser of Ibn Sa'ud, whom he has supported from beginning. Together with (2) is prime mover in the 'Ain Zubeyda Committee. (2) Obeidullah Dehlavi, younger brother—aged about 53. Chiefly concerned in management of the family Motor Transport Company ' El-Nijah.' He is an intimate friend of Sheykh 'Abdullah Suleyman, and like his brother is a trusted adviser of the King. Both brothers interest themselves privately in affairs of the Sa'udi Government, but are not office seekers.15 35. Fadhl {al-Fazal) Family. Nejdis of 'Aneyza origin long settled in the Hejaz. An original 'Abdullah had at least five sons, all now deceased, with one possible exception. Each of these had issue. Members of the first and second generations after the original ' Abdullah were concerned in firms doing important business in the Hejaz and if]] India, where they had a high reputation, enhanced by their position as business iemor agents of Ibn Sa'ud, until 1930. Family differences and bad trade led to the J I; collapse of their business at Bombay and Karachi in that year. The two partners nJ' most actively concerned in the business in India absconded to the Hejaz, where a ■Jg , third tried to dissociate himself from the partnership. The affairs of the family ei J; have for some years been the subject of very complicated litigation and have j engaged the attention of various British authorities for reasons too long to recapitulate. The family still have influential connexions in the Hejaz, and ttt several members of it have been given employment by Ibn Sa'ud. Apart from : 'Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn 'Abdullah, who is the subject of a separate notice, 6 the following deserve mention :— altkif (1) Muhammad, son of the 'Abdullah just mentioned. In business in Jedda luMl and does a tidy trade in benzine, &amp;c. (2) Ibrahim ibn A hdurrahmdn. —One of the two who absconded from India in 1930. Appointed a member of the Legislative Council in October 1930. Became later a secretary to the Amir Faysal. Was called on to resign, ostensibly on grounds of ill-health, by Amir Faysal. He is now living in Mecca and engaged lenfci in trade in an unimportant way; but is still said to enjoy the confidence of Amir llej Faysal. j^i (3) Muhammad ibn Abdurrahman ibn 'Abdullah. —Was a partner in the firm which collapsed in India in 1930, but resided in Jedda and tried to dissociate himself from the other partners, his brother and cousin. (4) 'Abdullah ibn Ibrahim ibn 'Abdullah. —Private secretary to the Amir Faysal in 1926. Afterwards one of the partners who absconded from India. SaW Selected in 1931 for the post of Charge d'Affaires in Holland, under scheme which vena did not materialise for having a Legation there with the Sa'udi Minister in ibd London as Minister. Appointed Treasurer to the Government later in 1931, as a ileaierl: result of the cabal against 'Abdullah Suleyman. (5) Ibrahim ibn Suleymdn. —Son-in-law of father of (4), and has taken the flail place of (2) as Rais-i-Diwan of the Amir Faysal. Is an important official and nim enjoys Amir Faysal's complete confidence. d ill 36. Fahad ibn Zu'ayr. Late Governor of 'Asir. Was head of the mission sent to 'Asir in May 1930 Sail t0 jnake the arrangements which subsequently culminated in its practical annexa- ii tion by Ibn Sa'ud. Was later appointed Amir, though probably not the first to lif hold the post. Eeported to Ibn Sa'ud with increasing urgency in the autumn of ded 1932 that the Idrisi was getting beyond himself. The Idrisi, professing complete iferfi loyalty to the King, complained bitterly of Fahad's rough treatment. The King, anxious to placate the Idrisi, steered a middle course and sent a commission to fa# investigate. Before it could reach the spot the Idrisi had gone into open revolt and Fahad had to escape from his seat of government at Jizan. Little else is known about him, except that, wherever he now is, he seems to have been superseded. jjl $ 37. Farhan ibn Mashhur. A chief belonging to the Syrian Ruwalla tribe, and hardly within the scope 0 o; - of this report. Nevertheless, deserves inclusion because of the important role he has played in regard to Sa'udi Arabia. Quarrelled with his own paramount chief j in 1926, severed his connexion with Syria and embraced Wahhabism. Was concerned in raids from Nejd into 'Iraq and Transjordan in and before 1929. r Took a leading part in the rebellion against Ibn Sa'ud that year, in association lime 11 more particularly with the 'Ajman. Described at that time by the Political Agent , at Kuwait, who saw him personally, as a tall man of about 40, speaking Nejdi GW Arabic, with an occasional break into Damascus patois. Escaped into 'Iraq on the iji collapse of the rebellion and became the subject of an acrimonious controversy, owing to Ibn Sa'ud's contention that not only the 'Iraq Government but His ■in'' Majesty's Government were bound by definite undertakings to surrender him.16 Arrangements were finally made for him to be shephered circuitously from 'Iraq to Jedda, but he broke away in Syria and has since remained there. His Majesty's Government maintained their consistent theory that they had no responsibility and Ibn Sa'ud grudgingly allowed the controversy to be laid during Nuri Pasha's treaty-making visit to the Hejaz in April 1931. Ibn Mashhur has since kept quiet, but he is a man of energy and likely to reappear some day. His natural attaches are still probably with the Hashimites and Nuri Sha'alan, although his adventures have clouded his relations with both in the recent past. 38. Fawzdn as-Sahiq. Sa'udi agent in Egypt. Aged about 45. Belongs by origin to the 'UqeylJ the guild, as it were, of recognised caravan-guides. Educated in a Turkish school at 'Amman. Is by profession a dealer in camels and horses and still appears to do this business. Was Ibn Sa'ud's agent in Damascus prior to 1924. Moved in that year to Cairo, where he occupies a similar position, not officially recognised in any way, although he does passport work, &amp;c. Is described by Mr. Smart as a devout Moslem, plain, slow, courteous and old-fashioned; politically rather innocent, but possessed of a certain native shrewdness. 39. Fuad Bey Hamza. Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs. A Druze from the Lebanon, born about 1900. Educated in Turkish schools in Syria, the Teachers' Training- College, Beirut, and the Syrian Protestant College, Beirut. Was Inspector of Schools at Damascus for a time. Obtained a post as clerk under the Palestine Department of Public Health in 1921. Resigned after a few months and took service under the Department of Education as a teacher in Acre. Transferred in 1922 to a secondary school in Jerusalem as teacher in English and remained until 1926. Studied simultaneously at the Law School, got a Certificate of Legal Studies in 1925 and qualified in five subjects, including Constitutional History and Public International Law, for the Diploma, but did not complete the course. Had a uniformly good record in Palestine, but was mixed up in politics and the Druze insurrectionary movement. May have feared arrest, although he was not, in fact, in danger of it. Left for Egypt on the 2nd December, 1926. Apparently was to go to India on a Syro-Palestinian delegation, but was drawn to the Hejaz, where, after giving English lessons for a time, he was taken into the Ministry for Foreign Affairs by Yusuf Yasin, then acting for Dr. 'Abdullah Danluji. Became Acting Minister in July 1928, when Dr. Danluji left on a mission, never to return. Had probably worked earlier to undermine Danluji's position. Remained Acting Minister until the Amir Faysal became titular Minister with Fuad as Under-Secretary, but still effective head of the Ministry in December 1930. Retained his post, with a seat on the Council of Ministers when the latter was constituted early in 1932. Prefers to call himself in English Deputy Minister. Visited Europe for the first time as a member of the Sa'udi Mission under the Amir Faysal in the spring of 1932 and did all the real business. Was made an honorary K.B.E. during the visit to London. Fuad Hamza is alert, intelligent, well informed on matters pertaining to his work and industrious. Speaks English well and Turkish, but is hampered by lack of more than elementary French. Equally devoted to his own ambitions and to the cause of Arab nationalism, serving Ibn Sa'ud as its exponent, though inclined sometimes to despair of the system of which he has made himself part. Keeps in touch with other Nationalists in Palestine, and probably Syria. Is used by the King as his instrument for foreign affairs, and makes the most of his position, but probably does not enjoy Ibn Sa'ud's full confidence, so that his power varies. Very hostile to 'Abdullah Suleyman and took part in the unsuccessful drive against him in 1931. Conforms to Wahhabism without conviction. Would like to see Sa'udi Arabia, a name of which he was one of the authors, develop on modern, more or less constitutional lines. Likes drafting laws. Would go to great lengths for the causes he has at heart, but is seldom, if ever, dishonest in diplomacy. Rather bumptious and sometimes difficult to deal with, but responds to personal handling. Sometimes spoken of as anti-British, sometimes even as pro-Soviet; probably wrongly, except in so far as his attitude towards foreign Powers is determined by Arab nationalism. May have put by a modest amount of money, although the only traceable record of anything j hi i i17 S approaching corruption is an allegation in 1929 that he bought large stocks of 101! tobacco before promulgating a decree imposing new duties. 3 Taufiq Hamza, Fuad's brother, serves under him in the Ministry, but does rW : not merit a separate notice. Speaks French. 140. Gdbil Family (more correctly Qabil, but they use the other spelling). 1 ^1 i Important merchants in Jedda of African slave origin. Take their name from an extinct Jedda family, one of whom owned the father, later a freedman. The firms consists of the two following brothers :— (1) Suleymdn Amdn Gdhil. —Aged about 60. Worked up an important M business connexion with Medina, India, &amp;c., in his early days. Paid President ! -^ 0 f the Municipality in Turkish times, and held the same post under King Huseyn. Had at that time a poor reputation for honesty. Took a leading part in the movement by notables of Jedda and Mecca to compel King Huseyn's H: abdication in October 1924. Went to Port Sudan in March 1926 as one of the d * delegates sent to negotiate about the Eastern Telegraph Company cable and was more helpful than his colleague, 'Abdullah Kazim (q.v.). Figured as a Hejazi delegate at the Moslem Congress in Mecca in June 1926. A Vicar of Bray under three successive regimes, but can be outspoken, as when he displeased the King let by his frank criticism of fiscal policy at the cc National Conference' of June act I 931 - Described in 1928 as a lively and entertaining host.' Still pleasant to SiV meet and apt to be met in Eoyal circles. Speaks moderate Turkish. (2) 'Abdul-Qddir Amdn Gdhil several years younger than Suleyman, m 1- whose wake he follows at a distance. i. 1M i m 41. Hdfiz {Hdfidh) Wahba. [fat Sa'udi Minister in London. An Egyptian born probably between 1885 and itfc 1890. Educated at Al-Azbar. Mixed up in Nationalist and pan-Islamic politics mr. in early manhood and was closely associated with 'Abdul- Aziz Shawisn. npoi Definitely anti-British at time of Great War and said to have been deported from India. Later started a school at Kuwait and passed thence into Ibn Sa'ud s Mg ] service. Became tutor to the Amir Faysal and accompanied the prince to London r ; in 1919. Was one of Ibn Sa'ud's delegates at the abortive Kuwait Conference r; in 1923-24. In supreme charge of the civil side of the Administration at Mecca in 1925, with a viceregal title, and did well. Read the King's inaugural address at the Moslem Congress in Mecca in June 1926. Much employed on missions and 'i,:: negotiations during the ensuing years. Inter alia took part in negotiations witn i;: Sir G. Clayton in 1925, 1927 and 1928 and expounded Ibn Sa'ud s views and fears regarding Italian policy in the Red Sea, Bolshevik activity and Hashimite sovereignty in neighbouring countries to the Residency at Cairo early in 1928. 1 During all this period waged a ding-dong struggle against the Syrian influences around the King, and had ups and downs. Was occulted towards the end oi 19 b, ^ but returned to favour soon after and became Assistant Viceroy beside the all# Amir Faysal. Thought to have indisposed the Amir by his masterfulness as a tutor and his disregard as Assistant Viceroy for the Amir s position. Relegated ipti^ i n j u i y 1 928 to the post of Director-General of Education. Went to London m t 1929 to represent Ibn Sa'ud at the International Postal Congress. While there was selected for the post of Minister in London, but did not take up the post lor over a year, during which interval he went on a sort of undefined mission to lit Kuwait and was also employed much about the King's person, though he appeared on the whole to have lost ground to the Syrians. Has during his tenure ot the Legation in London represented his country on international occasions, at jeDce; Geneva and elsewhere, and has only once been back in Sa udi Arabia. Was f designated in 1931 to be Minister at The Hague, but the arrangements have never jjiili: materialised for reasons of economy. . . Hafiz Wahba has sown his political wild oats. His anti-British sentiments [Jf ; are supposed to have undergone a change in or before 1928, when he was reported yii' as being accustomed to say that, as regards Egypt, he would always be against jji; Great Britain, but, as a servant of Ibn Sa'ud, believed the King s interest to lie ^ in friendly relations with His Majesty's Government. He has certainly shown .S himself well-disposed in London, and has on occasion been distinctly helpful. He • Ijfl is a good propagandist for Ibn Sa'ud on the lecture platform and m society. [8861] D18 Neither taciturn nor talkative, he appeals by his sense of humour and looks any thing but a Wahhabi (except that he abstains from alcohol and tobacco) at the Hyde Park Hotel or the Savoy. Likes the theatre too. Speaks moderate English, but is not fluent. A useful servant to the King, whose respect he commands, but not probably his entire confidence. 42. Hamad Suleymdn. Under-Secretary of State for Finance, brother of 'Abdullah Suleyman, q.v., and has worked under him. Acted for him as Director-General of Finance during his relegation to Hasa towards the end of 1931. Was appointed Wakil or Under- Secretary when 'Abdullah was made Wazir or full Minister in August 1932. Has been employed on missions in 'Asir, notably in November 1932, when he was sent with Khalid-al-Qarqani to investigate the differences between the Idrisi and Ibn Sa'ud's Governor. They were too late to reach the spot before the Idrisi went into open revolt, but have since been standing by in 'Asir. 43. Hamdi Bey. Director-General of Military Organisation. Perhaps 40 to 45. Believed to be an 'Iraqi Kurd and to have risen to non-commissioned rank in the Turkish army. Was a colonel in the army of King Huseyn, but passed to the service of Ibn Sa'ud and was officer commanding troops at Yanbu' before 1928. Became Officer Commanding in Jedda in that year. Appointed Director-General of Military Organisation in 1931 in succession to Faudhi Bey Kawokji. Presents all the appearance of a man who might be good in a rough and tumble; none of having the education necessary to create anything serious out of the embryo regular army, as Faudhi Bey might have done had he not lost favour. Hamdi seems to be a man of indifferent character, with a gift for intrigue, which he displayed in connexion with the vicissitudes of the British Staff of the Hejaz Air Force in 1931-32. Acts on occasion as A.D.C. to the King, attending him on his visits to Jedda and being sent to meet sloops, &amp;c. 44. Hamud al-Bagdwi. Officer in charge on the Kuwait frontier, with headquarters at Jariya. Appointed to this post in August 1932. Fourth person to hold it since 1930. A man of very evil reputation, described as having been chiefly responsible for all the raiding and killing in Kuwait territory eight or nine years ago. Known in Kuwait as the 'butcher' of 'Abdullah ibn Jiluwi, Governor of Hasa, and apparently chosen for his present post to tighten up the embargo on trade between Kuwait and Nejd, responsibility for which had been transferred to ibn Jiluwi. 45. Hamud ihn Ibrahim. Appointed Governor of Yanbu' in August 1931. Known only from the announcement of this. 46. Hamza al Ghauth al Madani. Understood to be consul-general designate for Java. A Hejazi of Medina, aged over 40. Said to have been educated in Turkish schools and to have frequented Turkish society. Sided with Turks at time of Arab revolt, and edited an anti-Huseyn paper at Medina in their interest. Continued to be anti-Huseyn after the success of the revolt and fled. Said to have been sentenced to death by default during his absence. Seems, nevertheless, to have been given an important post at Damascus, which he continued to hold under King Faisal's regime there, even after King Huseyn had launched against him an accusation, probably trumped up, of having stolen valuables from the Prophet's Tomb. Was in Ibn Sa'ud's service by end of 1923 and was one of his delegates at the abortive Kuwait Conference of 1923—24, an appointment which led to a revival by the 'Iraqi delegates of the robbery charge. Became Assistant Governor of Medina after its occupation by Sa'udi forces in 1925. Was later employed in the Palace. Selected in 1931 for the proposed consulate-general at Batavia, to the creation of which the Netherlands Government agreed, but which has never been opened, probably owing to financial difficulties. Filled in time as a member of the Legislative Council, whence he was transferred to the Amir Sa'ud's Diwan in September 1932. Came in King's train to Mecca in March 1933. Much of a palace man evidently.19 % 47. Hashim Daghestani, called Sayyid Hashim. l0 S A Hejazi, aged perhaps 50 or more, descended from a family of Mutawwifs iec() % who derived their name from the fact that they looked after the pilgrims from Daghestan. This was a lucrative business in the good old days, and Sayyid Hashim was formerly well off. He seems to have lost a great deal during the war between Ibn Sa'ud and King 'Ali, and has also lost heavily by being loaded up with now worthless roubles. Was formerly employed in the Awqaf Department, apparently in King Huseyn's time. Appointed ' Chief Revenue Officer ' under % the new regime in January 1926, and was later local Director of Finance in Sstf Jedda. Ejected from this post and appointed a member of the Inspectorate of Government Departments in 1930. Has since been employed in various financial n connexions and hunts in couples with Sheykh 'Abdullah Suleyman, but his real '^ importance lies in the fact that he is said to have an independent position as a sort of personal secret service agent of the King, and to correspond with the latter, when His Majesty is in Nejd, about persons and things ii^ the Hejaz. Is on intimate terms with the Indian vice-consul, to whom he sometimes supplies o|),| information. This connexion was of some value during the early stages of the tiiiti 'Asir revolt of November-December 1932. itoy )r e llll ' } re ^: 48. Hithlayn Family. BdjP r People of importance in the 'Ajman tribe, much concerned in the Nejd revolt :fl tii,- of 1929. Its principal member, Dhaydan ibn Hithlayn, was slain treacherously in mtoft April of that year. The following other members of the family deserve stfai, mention:— (1) Naif ihn Hithlayn (nicknamed Abu '1 Kilab).—Succeeded Dhaydan and carried on the revolt, but surrendered in January 1930 to the British authorities '*5' in Kuwait, and was in due course handed over to Ibn Sa'ud. Has since been a State prisoner at Riyadh, closely confined. (2) Hdzim ihn Hithlayn also took an active part in the revolt, and was one of two leaders who in July 1929 visited Kuwait in the hope of enlisting support. iaitffi wr as fighting together with Naif in October. Eventual fate unknown. (3) Khdlid ibn Muhammad ihn Hithlayn, described as a ' debonair and lespoE handsome young warrior.' Is one of the Mutayr and 'Ajman Sheykhs living in mo : 'Iraq under King Faisal's protection. Visited Kuwait in 1932 at the time of the moil Ibn Eifada affair apparently to size up the chances of new anti-Sa'udi action, iwti ' ■ 49. Huseyn al 'Awayni. A young Syrian merchant established in Jedda. An enterprising fellow, who moii derives some importance from being a friend of Fuad Hamza and Yusuf Yasin and having connexions in Manchester; notably with another Syrian, 'Abdul- Ghani Ydlibi, the naturalised British head of a small company there. This association was close early in 1932, when Ydlibi visited Jedda in order to work gpjiiU up business and with great ideas of getting concessions of all sorts. They claimed loolsrf to have important support in Lancashire, and specifically that of the Calico ^1 Printers' Association (Limited). It was understood in 1932 that 'Awayni was [ I d I ^: leaving Jedda for good, but he returned. His last important appearance was in 0 February or March 1933, when he went to Riyadh on behalf of certain merchants ^rji: to try and dissuade the King from proceeding with the concession to the ex-Khedive's group for the creation of a National Bank. A man likely to have .^i ups and downs of fortune, in dealing with whom commercially great care should • y be used. 0 3' 50. M. Huseyn Nasif. -rtjUfi 0 Ijjjl A well-known Hejazi of Jedda of Egyptian origin. Aged about 50 or more.. Inherited much property from his father, 'Omar Nasif, who was a notable personage in Turkish times, as well as the agency in Jedda of the Sherifs of the I 'Abadilah branch. Occupies the largest house in Jedda and was once very J J, prosperous, but is now probably less so. Was said in 1917 to have lost favour with King Husevn, who had previously been accustomed to stay with him when 93 i [8861] 1 1 D 2\ 20 in Jedda. Was said also to be desirous of British naturalisation at that time. Described as having been a Wahhabi by conviction, even before the Sa'udi invasion. Deported to 'Aqaba during King 'Ali's short reign. Figured as a Hejazi delegate at the Moslem Congress in Mecca in June 1926. Was given the privilege of putting Ibn Sa'ud up during the years following the fall of Jedda, but has not done so since the King acquired the ' Green Palace.' Has not held office, as was expected, under the Sa'udi regime, perhaps owing to doubt as to his trustworthiness. Kather a dark horse nowadays and may both dislike ;and be disliked by the regime, but keeps quiet. Said to be a good Arabic scholar •and possesses what passes in Jedda for a remarkable library. An aldermanic figure. r 51. Ibrahim ihn Mu'ammar. Head of the Amir Sa'ud's diwan, or secretariat, at Riyadh. Was formerly a well-known propagandist and press correspondent for Arabic papers and seems i 11 ® 11 to have spent some years in Egypt and India. Probably identical with the f||i s ] ' Muammar Bey ' mentioned in the Jedda report for February 1926 as having ^ been Nejdi representative in Egypt and having just been appointed 'head of I j the Foreign Political Intelligence Department and chief adviser to the King.' y Would appear to have become head of the King's diwan soon after, probably 5 in July 1926. Little known in European circles, but probably important in Ibn Sa'ud's entourage. Was transferred in September 1932 to the diwan of the Amir Sa'ud. This transfer, if effective, need not be regarded as relegation to an inferior post, as it may quite well have been part of a plan to equip the Amir for his probable role of successor to the throne. (See 1 (2).) Ibrahim ibn Mu'ammar was described by the Indian vice-consul in 1928 as a good-hearted and pro-British man. Selected in May 1933 for post of Charge d'Affaires at Bagdad in place of Rusheyd Pasha {q.v.). M! uif Iptact il mk mil Btol mik is Itote hImi ptol lUni 52. 'Id Rawwdf. | ji |Sw Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, formerly Sa'udi consul in Damascus. Born about 1898. One of a Sherari family which migrated from Jauf to Damascus in 1910. Family not highly considered in Damascus, but 'Id's father maintained close connexion with Ibn Sa'ud and was helpful to him in negotiations with the Turks. He, the father, made a fortune in camel- dealing and left wealth to his two sons. 'Id was also a camel merchant before W being appointed to his Damascus post in 1929 in succession to his brother Yasin. | ™ Had then only had primary education, but was stated last year to be busily J™ improving on it. Was considered by His Majesty's present consul in Damascus * rather stupid, though pleasant and useful. Well informed on local currents of thought and pushes in Syrian nationalist circles, without apparently carrying much weight, the idea of an Arab Empire with Ibn Sa'ud as a suitable ruler for it. The brother Yasin Rawwaf, whom he succeeded, is said to have become pi® Governor of Medina m 1929-30. He was appointed second assistant to the ^ Viceroy of the Hejaz in September 1930, but has faded out of Sa'udi official life and now lives at Damascus. P.S.—-'Id Eawwaf was superseded as consul at Damascus by Rusheyd Pasha {q.v.) in May 1933 and appointed an Assistant Under-Secretary of State for : Foreign Affairs. 53. Idrisi Family. ^ Founded by Ahmed al Idrisi, a native of Fez, who became a notable religious teacher at Mecca and created a Tariqa, or school of religious doctrine. Moved on to Sabya, in 'Asir, where he acquired land and died in the odour of sanctity . about 1837 and where his tomb is still venerated. The Idrisis supplanted the j.'^ Sherifian family, which had ruled at Abu 'Arish in the time of his son Muhammad Poi and Muhammad's son 'Ali. The branch of the family most identified with | ^ 'Asir is descended from these two, as appears from the following table, which is ^ not necessarily complete or accurate as regards order of birth :—21 Ahmed, the founder Muhammad 'Ali 1011 3ll % 'hk i u (3) 'Ali (4) 'Abdul- (5) 'Abdul- 'Abdur- Hasan I, I,J | Wahhab 'Aziz Rahim or Ahmed (1) Muhammad, died 1923 (2) Hasan The numbered members of this branch deserve further notice. flliy (1) This Muhammad was a notable man in his day. Born in 1876. Studied pinWlin Egypt and at Kufra. Organised opposition to the Turks in 'Asir in and isertog after 1904. Made treaties with His Majesty's Government through the Eesident 1 ay,at Aden in 1915 and 1917. Came to terms with Ibn Sa'ud in 1920, when he ijr ceded to him any rights he might have in the country about 'Abha. StotWj (2) Displaced (3) in 1926, after complicated events. Accepted in that year arhku the suzerainty of Ibn Sa'ud by a treaty signed at Mecca. Accepted in October iplany 1931 the practical annexation of 'Asir by Ibn Sa'ud, retaining a simulacrum only (2),) | of quasi-sovereign rights. Joined in the rebellion against Ibn Sa'ud in November affod 1932, and on its collapse in due course took refuge in Yemen. After strenuous A|i re ; efforts to obtain his surrender, Ibn Sa'ud agreed recently that he should remain in the Yemen under the Imam's supervision, and accorded him a pension. Appears to be a man of weak character, very amenable to influence. Was described some years ago as ££ monkish.' (3) Succeeded his father in 1923. Was upheld by the Masariha and other tribes in 1924 against an attempt to displace him by his cousin Mustafa. No. (6), V' who established himself temporarily at Hodeyda, then an Idrisi possession. 'Ali, : in turn, lost Hodeyda to the Imam in 1925, and was displaced by (2) in 1926. Returned to Mecca in August 1926, and seems to have lived mostly there until he was suddenly arrested and deported to Rivadh in the summer of 1932, under a tai .suspicion, apparently, of intending a cowp in 'Asir. Recently attempted to lelifik escape. Was foiled, but did not die, as was rumoured. )tet« . (4) And (5) were very active in organising and conducting the 'Asir revolt of November-December 1932. The original Ahmed has a numerous posterity through another son, variously v called 'Abdul-A1 or 'Abdul-Mutal. His descendants have been principally ; associated with Dongola, where his tomb is a place of pilgrimage, and with Egypt. ■; The following table shows only those of the branch who have come to notice in il f connexion with Arabia in recent years : id i# J it of W Ahmed, the founder !

Works normally, it is alleged^ in the Italian interest, but played an apparently pro-Sa'udi role in 1926-27, at ^ the time of and after the establishment of Ibn Sa'ud's suzerainty over 'Asir. Visited Mecca at least three times from September 1926 to September 1927.-pi i 11 Was thought perhaps to aspire himself to the post of ruler of 'Asir. Visited His Majesty's agent and consul in Jedda on the 15th September, 1927. jjllii! Mr. Stonehewer Bird described him at that time as being the King's unofficial :i adviser in regard to 'Asir and Yemen. He found him a man of intelligence and |pasli3 broad views—pro-Sa'udi, but not pro-Wahhabi. Accused by the Sa'udi Government in 1932 of again serving Italian interests, and of being concerned in the political plot behind the 'Asir revolt. 1 [tiiii 1 (9) Much concerned in the 'Asir revolt of November-December 1932. Was pi at Jizan at the crucial time, and attempted by a letter and a visit to Kamaran to iai get His Majesty's Government to recognise what he represented as the restoration of Idrisi rule. Withdrew early in 1933 to Massawa, with his relative M. Al- f jl-fi 'Arabi, No. (7). IL 0I All members of the family have the title of Seyyid. There is a close M connexion between the family and the Senusis, whose founder was a disciple of W® the original Ahmed al Idrisi. The spiritual relationship has been reinforced by [itogl intermarriage at various times. The Idrisis have also a connexion with the iiif® Mirghani family, whose head resides in the Sudan, and is chief of yet another Tariqa, once powerful and still important. Ipiitol iin Ibjii 54. Ismail Ghuznavi. Of Amritsar in India. This Indian Wahhabi has played an important rf anti-British political role in India since 1919. No full account of him would ip, be appropriate in this report, but he deserves mention in it because of his frequent itWlm visits of long duration to the Hejaz. Was a delegate of the Indian Ahl-al- . ; :rafe Hadith, the Indian equivalent of Wahhabis, at the Moslem Congress in Mecca in June 1926. Was concerned in the arrangements for creating the Dar-al-Kiswa, or Holy Carpet Factory, in Mecca, and apparently incurred the King's displeasure ilifolk in connexion with purchases for it in 1929. Now has close relations with Ibn Mk Sa'ud, whom he serves as an unofficial agent in India, principally for purposes im connected with the stimulation of the pilgrimage, but also, perhaps, the encourage- uk ment of Wahhabism. Notwithstanding his record in India, he has of late been yissaid useful to the Legation in Jedda, having established relations with the Indian in g vice-consul, to whom he was formerly hostile, and shown readiness to help in adl adjusting the difficulties of Indian pilgrims. In March 1933 the Indian Govern- Is ment refused his permission to come to the Hejaz, considering that the general ipjt] danger of his activities must outweigh other considerations. The man is apparently devoted in an anti-British spirit to the cause of Islam, which he identifies with Ibn Sa'ud; but his political activities may also have a Bolshevik ^ aspect. fcni] 55. Jemdl Pasha Ghdzi {Ghazzi). A man of about 50. Of Syrian origin, but born at Gaza in Palestine; hence his surname. Graduated in the Turkish Staff College. Said to have been a member of a Turkish Military Mission lent to the Sultan of Morocco in 1910, to have seen service later in Gallipoli and to have been A.D.C. to Enver Pasha, to whom he claims to have been attached up to shortly before the armistice. Went to Basra after the armistice to manage the property of his wife, the daughter of j u, J £1 TlP .Vl 1 Tl rl rVWH ^\J I cn fori T TI /I IO m fT^o-n r\-nr^r\ TTz-vl 1 rvnf ' a rich landowner there. Visited India more than once from Basra. Fell out with his wife and applied to Mustafa Kemal Pasha for employment, which was ^ refused, possibly because of his past association with the C.U.P. Entered the 0 service of Ibn Sa'ud and commanded the artillery during the siege of Jedda. Went to 'Asir in 1926 and was reported late in that year to be running Hasan al-Idrisi in company with Ahmed es-Senusi and Mustafa al-Idrisi. Was reported Into kk S 'tinj ai-iansi m company witn AUmed es-benusi and Mustafa al-Idrisi. Was reported in 1927 to be an Italian agent, trying to undermine Ibn Sa'ud's position in 'Asir. ;3 Re-employed later in the Hejaz. Was serving in the Amir Faysal's household early in 1931 as a sort of chamberlain, and was then scandalously spoken of as M. le Procureur. Accompanied the Turkish Prince Ahmed Tewhid to India, , 1 with the permission of Ibn Sa'ud, in May 1931. Travelled a good deal after- W wards, posing as Minister of War in the Sa'udi Government. He appeared in ^olejjjj; Jerusalem in November 1931 and played an ambiguous part in connexion with the Uinti: then impending Moslem Congress. Whether he eventually attended it or not is ) SeJ; not known in Jedda. Returned to India in June 1932 and continued alone the of'jLJ propaganda in favour of the pilgrimage which he and Prince Ahmed Tewhid % had initiated in 1931. In a secret report from India of February 1933, he is e% stated to have expressed in one quarter the intention of enlisting Indian Moslem 'C ^ ~ f ; % ' Jemal Pasha is presentable though unpleasantly fulsome. He speaks French, ofS: interest in Ibn Sa'ud's claim to 'Aqaba. Returned to the Hejaz for the 1933 ll3 pilgrimage, J some English and probably other European languages. He is almost certainly a ga man of loose and untrustworthy character. His recent activities in India give J him a certain importance. He is doubtless rewarded for his propaganda in I t j iV favour of the pilgrimage, but should not be regarded as a responsible agent of Ibn Sa'ud for any other purpose. He is a mere hanger-on. 56. 'Khdlid Al-Hakim. Tl^'l A Syrian or Palestinian, said to have served as an engineer officer in the Turkish army. Has been mentioned several times since 1926 as an intermediary for the purchase of arms, &amp;c., by Ibn Sa'ud in Europe, acting apparently as a on^, merchant, though he has also been in the King's official employment. His dealings ygl in respect of arms appear to have been with German firms, perhaps with Italy and with Poland, where Ibn Sa'ud placed a very large order in 1930. Reported in August 1927 to have been dismissed, from what post is not clear, but accompanied Dr. Damluji in July 1928 to take part in the still-born conference at Haifa on the Hejaz Railway. Last heard of as being in Haifa in the Sa'udi interest in Ml an connexion with the proceedings of the Preparatory Committee of the proposed 111 oft Arab Congress. Appears to be in with Kamil al Qassab and other exponents of iuseofk the idea that Ibn Sa'ud should dominate the congress, even if it is held in Bagdad, fa IiiiBrother of Hasan Bey Al-Hakim, director of the Arab Bank at Jaffa, ingress :i! tyj57. Khdlid Al Qarqani. Kinra ii A Tripolitan, who is said to have served under the Senusi, fought the Italians relate; and retired into exile in Egypt, where he has a daughter married to Abdur- ipalljfef Rahman 'Azzam Bey, formerly a desert fighter in the Senusi cause, now a apsjk member of the Egyptian Chamber. Al Qarqani was brought to Ibn Sa'ud's teW; notice, it is said, by Sheykh Hafiz Wahba, and came to the Hejaz in 1930. Was isiitli appointed in September 1930 First Assistant to the Viceroy, but apparently afe:: soon vacated the post and went into business with the German merchant, after- ieliii war ds honorary German consul, de Haas. Was re-employed by the Government ^ to accompany the American engineer Twitchell on his tours of survey for water )E jfand minerals. Was sent with Hamad Suleyman {q.v.) to 'Asir in November 1932 f Istat to investigate the dispute between the Idrisi and Ibn Sa'ud's Governor. This okf j mission could not be accomplished by the two delegates, who are still standing by in Asir. Khalid al Qarqani is spoken of as a man of character and an honest one. . 58. Khatih Family. Understood to be a Mecca family. Three of them became prominent in 1932 iw in connexion with the activities of the political organisations behind attempts to lorff: undermine Ibn Sa'ud; viz., the Hizb al Ahrar al Hijazi and the Jami'at al Dif'a ;oEiiJf ! lil Hijaz. Actively connected with the organisation are— ,3# (1) 'Abdul Hamid al Khatilj, and (2) } A hdul Malik al Khatih— i Eitf who appear to be permanently settled in Egypt and to have property there. (2) ij# may possibly be identical with a man of the same name who was described in 1917 ,fas a Javanese of Mecca, well educated, who had been correspondent of the Mokattam and had influence with King Huseyn. A third person, viz.—- )e# (3) Huseyn Ali al-Khatib— ' lived at Lahej in 1932 and seems to have squandered in riotous living at Aden, &amp;c., positii' money given him by Huseyn ad-Dabbagh for the purposes of the plot against ai# Ibn Sa'ud. It is understood that Fuad al Khatib, formerly Foreign Secretary to King n and now secretary to the Amir 'Abdullah, is not related to this family.24 59. Ldmi Family. A Sheykhly family of the Jiblan section of the Mutayr tribe. Concerned in :: f |f the Nejd rebellion of 1929. Not apparently of great consequence, but worth 'i 1 j mentioning, because Jasir ibn Lami was one of the Akhwan leaders who ' t ( surrendered to the British authorities in Kuwait in January 1930, and was in due course handed over to Ibn Sa'ud. He has since been a State prisoner at ^ r Riyadh, and is one of those who were recently reported to be receiving more lenient treatment than before. f#' 61 60. Ldri Family. BiW Persian Bahais long settled in Jedda. (1) Muhammad 'AU Ldri, the head of the family, is a charming old gentle- | ir !J man, now close on 70, probably. Was the principal carpet merchant in Jedda and | rich, having an important connexion with Egypt. Health now impaired, but is ;; still in business and highly considered. Has in the past acted as Persian consul, P®' as did his father before him. Reads poetry and likes to commune with nature. (2) Ahmed, son of the preceding, is in the business in Jedda. Was in charge of Persian affairs in his father's absence in 1925, and was reported to have come jifflof 1 much under the influence of the then Soviet representative, Hakimov. Urged Ibn Sa'ud at that time, according to Ibn Sa'ud himself, to join in a great Eastern :ito Union against the imperialistic Powers, with Persia and Afghanistan in it and piistat Russia supporting. pW® (1) has two other sons in the business, one in Jedda, one in Egypt. Unless ■ ; ,uv j there was a mistake in the name, one of these would appear to have been the C£ Persian trading consul ' mentioned in a Jedda despatch of the 22nd November, 1927, as the would-be buyer of goods which arrived in Jedda in the Russian steamship Tomp at that time and were denied clearance from customs after having been landed. iad i jntrik 61. Luwey Family. |y yi Enjoy the title of Sherif. People of importance in the 'Ateyba tribe, chiefly iatlet because of the considerable role played by Khalid ibn Mansur ibn Luwey, who died, apparently of illness, on the march from 'Abha to Sabya to repress rebellion ^ in 'Asir in December 1932. He had broken with the Hashimites, it was said,, j' , owing to a quarrel with the Amir 'Abdullah, who had slapped him on the mouth with a shoe. He had gone over to Ibn Sa'ud some years before 1924, and was one of the leaders of the forces which occupied Mecca in 1924. Although supposed at a later date to be in sympathy with the extremist Wahhabis in Nejd, he con- * tinned faithful to the King and was apt to be called on for military service in times , of special emergency. The present head of the family is his eldest son, (1) Sa'ad ihn Luwey, who, immediately on Khalid's death, was appointed to r 1 ^ succeed him in his command and as Amir of Khurma. (2) and (3) Huseyn and Zdmil. j It was stated at the time of Khalid's death that he had left three minor sons in addition to the above. 62. Mahmud Hamdi Hamude. Director-General of Public Health. A Syrian of Damascus, born about 1882. Studied in Beirut and Constantinople. Spent in all sixteen or seventeen years kmi Niie PtimK Mead pi® an in latter place. Served in Turkish army during and up to end of war, after L la which he settled in Syria. Held post in some hospital there under the French and ^ was professor of rhino-laryngology at Damascus. Left Syria, apparently for ? aSl political reasons, and joined Ibn Sa'ud in Nejd early in or before 1925. * Appointed to his present post in January 1926 and represented Ibn Sa'ud, as ^ King of the Hejaz, at the International Sanitary Conference of 1926. Seemed ^ likely to be eliminated in August 1927 with other Svrians and was said to have % resigned but to have been kept on pending an audit of accounts. Evidently weathered this storm. Was Sa'udi representative at meeting of International Health Office in autumn of 1932, following on accession of Sa'udi Arabia to Rome ^ Convention. Speaks good Turkish and moderate French. Probably has reasonable Mci medical attainments, but gives no impression of real capacitv as Director-General [N of Public Health. ^ hi K25 ^ C| 63. Mahmud Shalhub. Director of Finance in Jedda. Comes of a Mecca family, one of whom described in 1917 as controlling the distribution of Zemzem water, a very lucrative job. Mahmpd, who must be over 50, was employed in Turkish times as r a Government clerk in Mecca, and was later chief clerk in Huseyn's financial ^ department. Continued to be employed in Mecca under the new regime and was appointed to his present post in 1930. A decent seeming man, but plays important role in a domain in which 'Abdullah Suleyman is supreme. was no 64. Mehdi Bey. armiij Director-General of Police with headquarters in Mecca. Said to be an hit}. 'Iraqi, formerly employed as an officer in the Turkish army, then in King Huseyn's. What little is known about him to the Legation is unfavourable. He asp} appears to be arbitrary and ruthless and to wield considerable authority, not always deferring even to the Viceroy. This account of him is given with reserve. tj:; 65. Ibn Mubarak. A man of this name would appear to be Governor at Burayda, but is only in^ known to the Legation from a reference to him in a letter from Ibn Sa'ud to the Sheykh of Kuwait of the 30th December, 1931. The post is important, as it is the administrative capital of Qasim, not including, however, 'Aneyza, which has its own Governor, probably hereditary, and depends directly on the King. tot 65 a. Ibn Mubarak, Governor of Dhaba. Little known to the Legation, which cannot even trace kill his first name, but worth mentioning because of the importance of his post in stall relation to Egypt and Transjordan, and because he was one of the leaders of the forces, with advanced base at Dhaba, employed against Ibn Eifada in 1932. Is possibly a tribal personage rather than an administrative Governor, and may be of the family of Huseyn ibn Mubarak of the Harb tribe, who was a power at tejkti Eabigh at the time of the Arab revolt, r in 111 I orp 66. Muhammad Khan Ghazi Khan. ^ An actively anti-British Indian, who, like Ismail Ghuznavi, cannot J!'; appropriately be dealt with at length in this report, but has resided much in I 1 ' 1 Mecca, and has been associated more particularly with the Holy Carpet factory •; or Dar-ul-Kiswa, a rallying-place for Indian sedition-mongers. ^ 67. Muhammad ibn Sultan. Commander of Ibn Sa'ud's camelry in the Hejaz. As such, played an important part in the suppression of the Ibn Rifada rebellion in 1932. Was also a powerful and much-feared element in the machinery set up to Wahhabise public morals in Mecca until its rigours were relaxed. 68. Muhammad at-Tawil. A native of Jedda of Egyptian origin. Got a small post in the customs in Turkish times and rose to be Director of Customs in Jedda under King Huseyn Played a leading part in the movement of the Hejazi notables to compel Huseyn's abdication and the accession of King 'Ali in October 1924. Remained in theory :: Director of Customs only, but wielded great influence under 'Ali, and was 11 ll described as being cc practically dictator ' in November 1925, after his triumph !1 in a dispute with Ahmed Saqqaf, the Prime Minister, who decided to leave. Promised at that time to devote to the cause of the Hejaz every penny of J?; ' certain economies ' which he had effected while Director of Customs. Left the ^g Hejaz on the fall of Jedda, but returned in 1927 or early in 1928 and started a l'' motor transport business. Was said in 1928 to have been president of the Hizb-al-Ahrar al Hijazi, but made his peace with Ibn Sa'ud after an absence at sts Riyadh, which was described in February 1928 as a deportation. Was slow to ft receive official employment, and was perhaps considered unsuitable for such i# employment in the Hejaz, but was in September 1930 placed at the head of a * ^ commission to study and reorganise the financial and economic situation in Hasa. Has remained since then in this employment, despite rumours of assassination [8861] eor flight. Appears to have tightened up regulations and trodden on Qusaibi;^ 1 Jj corns in the process, but not to have made the Hasa customs as paying as he hoped. ^. A capable and well-reputed man, liked by the authorities at Bahrain. 69. Muhsin al-Firm. ^ Principal chieftain of the Eastern Harb tribe in Nejd. Mentioned early in ll#^ 1929 in connexion with raids alleged to be in preparation against 'Iraq. DoeslK not seem to have joined in the rebellion against Ibn Sa'ud later that year, and . has since been at enmity with the Mutayr owing to his having fallen upon them during the revolt and made off with camels of theirs. Said in 1932 to have refused , to lead his tribesmen against Ibn Eifada, owing to resentment at the holding up ;' of a caravan of his by Ibn Sa'ud's officials some time before. Utir 70. Mustafa Badruddin. pi Director of Customs in Jedda. A North African or of North African pff origin. Probably between 40 and 50. Was given a small post in the Jedda custom-house some years ago, and later became Director of Customs at Yanbu'. Transferred to Jedda in the same capacity in 1930. A man of little ability, but i tas was reported not long ago to be disconcertingly honest. If so, he has not seriously M infected the custom-house as a whole with this malady. 71. Mutlaq as-Sur. i MiCej An important Mutayr leader closely associated with the late Faysal pi ad-Dawish and one of the sheykhs concerned in the Akhwan rebellion of 1929 pile who are now living under King Faysal's protection in 'Iraq. Visited Kuwait in (|||.] December 1932 and February 1933. Appeared to the Political Agent to be in ^ close touch with the Mutayr tribe, and may be watching for an opportunity of promoting or taking advantage of Ibn Sa'ud's downfall. 72. Muwaffaq al Alusi. 'H Born about 1895. Comes of a Bagdad family noted for erudition. Studied j at the Sorbonne and became a professor in the Law School at Bagdad in 1926. ',j m Became Director in the 'Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1928, but resigned jy in 1930, owing to a quarrel with the then Minister, Dr. 'Abdullah Damluji. ^ Came to the Hejaz in April 1931 as a secretary in Nuri Pasha's Mission to ^ negotiate treaties with Sa'udi Arabia. Went on to San'a with Taha Pasha ^ Hashimi to negotiate with the Imam. Seems to have broken later with Nuri J t . Pasha and came to the Hejaz in the autumn of 1932. Was appointed Legal Lv Adviser to the Sa'udi Ministry for Foreign Affairs in November 1932. Quarrelled LJ, in January 1933 with Fuad Hamza, the immediate dispute having arisen, it was said, over the placement at a dinner given by Fuad to Sir G. Buchanan and Sir ' - Andrew Eyan. Was anyhow transferred to the post of counsellor to the King in that month, joined him at Riyadh and returned with him to Mecca in March 1933, so he seems able to hold his own. A well-spoken man of good presence and ■ p refined appearance, evidently quarrelsome, however, and in any case perhaps too j.'J 11 ? European by training and outlook to remain long in the Sa'udi service. P.S.—He left in May 1933 and is unlikely to return. » 73. Neshmi. ; Formerly Amir of Jauf. Said to be a Nejdi; to have been originally a maker ^ of native foot-gear; to have been in Medina while the Hashimites still held it; Ijesty and to have escaped to the Sa'udi side, where his knowledge of the situation in ^ Medina was so useful that he was given a command. He appears to have been employed at Tebuk and perhaps at Yanbu' in the ensuing years. He became ht|, j notorious in February 1930 for a large-scale raid into Transjordan similar to that ^ of 'Abdul-'Aziz ibn Musa'id {q.v.) about the same time. He was apparently at the time already Governor of Jauf, a post from which the King dismissed him ^ about the end of the year, not, it was explained, because the man was bad, but jii^ because the King desired to eliminate causes of quarrel with His Majesty's ^ Government. The Amir Neshmi, as he is commonly called, remained in the :| e | Northern Hejaz and has appeared to play a certain role, but it is not clear that he has ever been re-employed officially. Has been little heard of recently and may have gone elsewhere. ji ^ ilii27 % % 74. Oheidullah, Maulvi. An Indian permanently established in Mecca. Has had a lurid past in India, ^ I having been at one time closely connected with the Bolsheviks and been involved in the Silk Letter conspiracy, &amp;c. Was mentioned in March 1927 as a man who I , was attracting modest notice in Mecca as a lecturer on the traditions of the % Prophet, and as belonging to the class of migratory agitators 'whose flight is Kabul, Moscow, Berlin and Constantinople/' Appears now to carry much weight yk. as a religious teacher and is much frequented by Indians. Probably uses his ,4'j influence in a definitely anti-British spirit, but has not come to notice latterly as a direct participant in conspiracies in India. ' 75. Othmdn 'Arab. A Hejazi, whose past connexion with the Hejaz is not known to the Legation. Came to notice in 1932 as one of those concerned in the Dabbagh conspiracy of lonjji against Ibn Sa'ud. Was described as a man of 50 to 55, fairly wealthy, normally resident in Egypt, but in the habit in 1931-32 of visiting Jerusalem and holding ustoiji telephone conversations with the Amir 'Abdullah and Abdur-Rauf Sabban. Was supposed to be an intermediary between the Hejazi conspirators in Egypt and lelasil Amir. Was certainly concerned in the anti-Sa'udi plot and is now excluded from Egypt, Palestine and Transjordan. 76. Philby, H. St.-J. B., C.LE., since 1917. Born in Ceylon 1885. Educated at Westminster and Trinity, Cambridge. Passed for Indian Civil Service in 1907 and had normal career in India from 1908 to 1915, when he was detached for service in 'Iraq. Sent on mission to Central ? j ^ r; Arabia in 1917-18, visited Ibn Sa'ud and crossed Arabia Peninsula from 'Uqayr to Jedda. Employed in Ministry of Interior in 'Iraq in 1920-21 and as British ^ representative in Transjordan from 1921 to 1924, when he fell out with His Majesty's Government and tendered a welcome resignation from that post. Retired on a pension from the Indian Civil Service in 1925, but had already ,, embarked on the recent career which entitles him to a place in this report. Came u 'J; to Jedda in November 1924, shortly after the accession of King 'All, by whose father, Huseyn, he had been decorated in 1923. Was said, in 1924, to believe 1^1 republicanism was the nostrum for the Arab world. Was regarded on his * arrival in Jedda as having necessarily been sent on a mission by His Majesty's asks I Government, so much so that they officially denied it. Was one of the would-be I peacemakers between 'All and Ibn Sa'ud in the last two months of 1924, but was nklert repulsed by Ibn Sa'ud. Appeared at one moment in 1925 to hover towards the if* Hashimites, but had long believed in the star of Ibn Sa'ud, whom he visited near 'Ml Mecca towards the end of the year and for whom he plumped finally, if indeed he inga® had ever really hesitated, after the fall of Jedda. Has since devoted himself to Uii' the King's cause in the press, in his books and in every other way. Resided selortci principally in Jedda until 1930. Was prime mover, though not principal share holder, in Sharqieh (Limited), whose business he directs in the Hejaz. Embraced Islam in August 1930 and has since spent much time in Mecca, but was away from fcasep ^e Hejaz during most of 1932, when he effected an enterprising journey across ser g the Rub'a-al-Khali and then spent some months in England. Mr. Philby has been variously judged and his influence in Arabian affairs variously estimated. He was for some time in and after 1924 a, thorn in the side of British authorities and was described in 1925 as clinging tenaciously to his religion, ' £ a simple dualism in which the spirit of darkness is represented )r igiEj| by His Majesty's Government.' Need now no longer be regarded as anti-British, except that he would still sympathise with Ibn Sa'ud in any quarrel with His |J# Majesty's Government, and will still rail on occasion against the British Empire as a system. He would as soon sell British goods as Standard oil or Ford cars e arsJ an d he got Ibn Sa'ud's wireless contract for Marconi's in 1931. His influence ^ with the King has been exaggerated by some into a legend, while many still 0fl ^ e ^ ev€ ; him to be a British political agent. He has much access to the King and jlil the King values his advice on certain occasions, but he presents no appearance liV heing in Ibn Sa'ud's confidence on major political occasions. He is still jjjj;} one of the King's greatest foreign admirers, but in the last two years has r e# conceived doubts of Sa'udi administration, especially that part of it for which jji 'Abdullah Suleyman is responsible and doubts even of the King's capacity to J direct his own machine. P ^ ^ [8861] E 228 77. Qattdn Family. (1) Yusuf ihn Salim Qattdn, said to have been originally a servant in a coffee-shop in Mecca and afterwards of the original Qattan family whose name , he took. Became a guide for Javanese pilgrims. Eose to be president of the r Mecca municipality under the Turks, but was still so uneducated that he was ^ said to be unable to tell ' the letter Alif from a telegraph pole.' Became Minister ^ of Public Works under King Huseyn. Was said in 1930 to be full of schemes connected with the pilgrimage and the advancement of his son No. (2) below, r* 1 Has also come to notice as one of the agents concerned with the properties of i^ er the Sherifian family. jlijjir (2) 'Alias Qattdn, an ambitious young man of 30 odd, who was himself president of the municipality in Mecca in 1930 and still occupies that post. L K He is the right-hand man of Sheykh 'Abdullah Suleyman, Minister of Finance Lg and is chief organiser of the hotels recently opened at Mecca, Jedda and Medina.' 78. Qusaibi Family. - An important merchant family in the Persian Gulf. The Legation is l^ili indebted to the Political Agent in Bahrain for an account of them, which was ftli drawn up in June 1931, and of which the following is a summary :— Rj Said to be descended from a butcher of Eiyadh. Composed of the five P®' brothers mentioned below; children of the same mother by two brothers, Hasan and Ibrahim, who married her successively; partners in business and property; iW engaged in trade between Bahrain their headquarters, Hasa and Nejd.' Accounted, despite their acquisition of wealth, extremely plebeian and 3]®' disqualified by Arab custom from intermarriage with women of better birth. pge (1) 'AMul- Aziz ibn Hasan, simple and wise; the mainstay of the firm; M 0 reputed pious; respected by Ibn Sa'ud. P® (2) Aldur-Rahman ibn Hasan, more enlightened and a wonderful fellow for pearl dealing. Possessed of some knowledge of French and English and 5^ accustomed to go to Paris on pearl business. Sensible but conceited. (3) 'Abdullah ibn Hasan, intelligent and sharp, but of mean and low I 11 ' 81 character and meddlesome. Inclined to be boastful and disliked by Ibn Sa'ud. N® (4) Hasan ibn Ibrahim, very foolish and gruff and as low a character as (3). Hot tempered. pill (5) ipermanently resident in Hasa. Not personally known lion to Captain Prior. Said to be a good 'mixer,' but similar in character to pi (3) and (4). » %! bli III to When the above information was supplied in 1931 the Qusaibis had great influence owing to their position as agents of Ibn Sa'ud in Bahrain and buyers of his requirements for Nejd, as well as to their wealth and their hold on many to whom they had lent money. Their most distinguished debtor was the King himself, who owed them in 1930 something like £80,000, and who, although about M half of this had been paid off by June 1931, still owed them the balance. [7 Abdurrahman was given in the latter year a roving commission to try and raise 58 the wind for the Sa'udi Government in Europe, but failed completely. The m relations of the Qusaibis with the King no longer seem to be as close as formerly. They resented the reforms introduced by Muhammad at-Tawil (q.v.). They were Wa driven by bad business to press the King for money. He has of late employed other persons to buy for him, but he is not known to have deprived the Qusaibis Np of their general agency for him at Bahrain. pof Kt{ 79. Rashid Family. |f^ Former rulers of Hail. Little is known of the remnants of this family once m so powerful and later so fallen, even before its final collapse, that it was ' accounted infamous, even in such a land of violence as Arabia, for its record of domestic murders.' It deserves attention, however, because of'the possibility of its reappearance on the scene, e.g., if the Shammar tribes from which it sprang should go against Ibn Sa'ud. It is understood that, after the fall of Hail, the King pursued a policy of absorption, not of annihilation and that many persons belonging to the Beni Rashid, or connected with them, passed into his entourage. Two lads who are being brought up with his younger children and are included in29 the list of his sons are said to be the children of a Rashid lady, whom Ibn Sa'ud married after their birth. Their names are— (1) Sultan and 7* (2) Mish'al— H the latter of which corresponds with that of an infant child of the last ruling ibn Eashid, as given in the 1917 volume of Personalities in Arabia. Two other ?l,| persons have come to notice, who are said to be related to the Beni Eashid, viz.— (3) Mansur ibn '^a/, who is said to have been taken into Ibn Sa'ud's service and to have served for a term as Governor of Tebuk; and his brother— rtotj; (4) Nasir ibn 'Asaf, who also served Ibn Sa'ud, but was reported to have deserted into Trans Jordan in 1931. It is regrettable that the information regarding the remnants of the Beni Eashid is so meagre. 80. Rifdda Family. Chiefs of the Billi tribe, with an urban establishment at Wejh. The most notable recent member of the family, Suleyman Afnan, played a not inconsiderable role during the Great War, but was killed in a raid in 1916 and left two sons, Ibrahim and Ahmed. His brother Salim, who had died earlier, left a son, Hamid. The cousins in this generation were at enmity. Hamid made a bid for the , Sheykhship on his uncle's death. He was one of several Hejazi Sheykhs who f®? approached the Residency in Cairo in 1924, complaining both of King Huseyn's ® tyranny and his inability to protect them against the Wahhabis. He came into 1/ greater prominence in 1928, when, having returned from Transjordan and taken i to to brigandage, he attempted a coup at Wejh, hoping to dislodge his cousin stajofl Ibrahim, who was Governor there and head of the tribe. After a further period of exile he came into still greater prominence in 1932 by invading the Hejaz at foifcll the head of a rebel band. He and two, it was said, of his sons were killed, but andEiji! there may be survivors of this branch. At the outset of the revolt Ibrahim visited eited the King at the head of a loyal delegation. He continues to reside at Wejh, [ ra | though it is not known whether he is still Governor. The family have attaches with a section of the Billi established in Egypt. irjs mii rii( 81. Rushdi Malhas. Editor of the Umm-al-Qura, the more important of the two weekly newspapers published at Mecca and the unofficial organ of the Sa'udi Govern ment. A Palestinian from Nablus, of whom little else is known to the Legation. usafe. 82. Rusheyd Pasha. aiirf Consul in Syria, stationed at Damascus. Aged well over 50. A native of ii\t Hail, said to be related to the Beni Rashid and to 'Abdul-'Aziz ibn Zeyd (q.v.). •orf Was semi-official representative of Ibn Rashid in Constantinople before the Great .oit War. Said to have promoted Turkish efforts to curb the rise of Ibn Sa'ud at that tiemifi time. Was attached during the Great War to Jemal Pasha in Syria, and was itfltP- employed in Damascus, where he showed bitter hostility to the Hashimites. Eetired to Constantinople after the fall of Damascus. Eventually made his peace : with Ibn Sa'ud and returned to Sa'udi Arabia. Was selected in 1931 to be the I first Sa'udi Charge d'Affaires and consul-general at Bagdad, but has never u 0 |j^: proceeded, possibly because of difficulties over finance, aggravated by hostility on the part of 'Abdullah Suleyman. Showed signs about the end of 1932 of intending to leave for Bagdad overland, but is still in the Hejaz. P.S.—Appointed consul at Damascus, instead of Bagdad, in May 1933, and left Jedda for his post on the 24th May. p|; 83. Sadiq (or Siddiq). The King's chauffeur. An Indian or of Indian origin. Born in the Bombay oftlf Presidency; is about 36 years old; came with Ibn Sa'ud from Riyadh in 1925; [0: had been in his service since about 1924. He was probably introduced to King 10^ by either the Qusaibis or al-Eadhls. Worthy of mention in this strange country, at#: not only because he is said to be the only chauffeur the King will trust, but because jo list he has been concerned in buying transactions, which have carried him at least30 Lfl# once as far as London. Quite a clever fellow and said to have amassed some 4$\ £20,000. Was recently reported to contemplate the creation of a canning industry Ltiie 1 ' at Wejh. Probably holds the speed record for Arabia, as he did the journey by car between Riyadh and Mecca in thirty-one hours a year or two ago, and is said o!r to have reduced this recently to twenty odd. Some feat for a distance of about ^ 600 miles over Arabian cc roads.' iffl*' I |P 84. Salih ihn 'Abdul-Wahid. Lattt Governor of Qaf. Transferred from the Governorship of Al-'Ala to his !i f ^ present post in 1931. A man of no great standing, but of some importance as s f being the Sa'udi Governor nearest to the Transjordan frontier and not a nice Pti neighbour by all accounts. Probably identical with man of the same name whose r B appointment as Ibn Sa'ud's representative with the Idrisi was announced in June 1927 and who played an important role in the Idrisi's entourage, e.g., at the time ^ of the negotiations regarding the Red Sea Petroleum Company's concession in the Farsan Islands. 85. Salih Ihn Ahu Bakr Shata. a ^ 011 ^ ^ ponies of a learned family in Mecca, where he was born. W 80 Much employed on committees for Waqfs, grain distribution, &amp;c., under the Hashimite regime. Fled to Jedda after the Sa'udi capture of Taif. Was one itrf c of the Hejazi notables who compelled the abdication of King Huseyn in October itW 1924 and rallied in due course to Ibn Sa'ud. Became one of two assistants to the Aimr Faysal in his capacity as Viceroy. Spoken of in 1930 as a possible Minister or Education in a Cabinet then rumoured to be in contemplation, but, if the rumour was true, the project was not pursued. When the Cabinet was eventually organised on its present lines early in 1932 and the Amir Faysal was given the Ministry of the Interior, as well as others, Salih Shata was made his chief assistant in that Ministry and is still the administrative head of it. 86. Sdayri Family. Take their name from the district of Sdayr in Nejd. Are related to Ibn Sa ud through the fact that his mother was a Sdayri. He has, moreover taken two wives from the family. Three members of the family have come to notice in recent years, viz. :— (1) A hdullah as-Sdayri, Governor of Tebuk since about the beginning of 1931. (2) TurU as-Sdayri, appointed at the same time Governor of Jauf or Skaka to which the seat of government was transferred shortly before or after. Has just been chosen as Governor-General of 'Asir to reside at 'Abha and will be succeeded at Skaka by— (3) 'Ahdul-'Aziz as-Sdayri, Governor designate of Jauf-Skaka. Little is known of No. (3), but (1) and (2) have been men of might in their setting. 87. Sha'ibi Family. Important in Mecca as the Keeper ship of the Key of the Ka'aba is hereditary in the family. The prerogative is very lucrative because all persons entering the Ka aba are supposed to make a present to the Keeper according to their means. The family are admittedly descendants of the Quraysh tribe, but not of the Prophet. It is claimed that the pedigree is continuous from pre-Islamic times and that the right to keep the key also dates from that early period. According to one story, there was a blot on the escutcheon in the 19th century, when the male descent failed and the succession passed through a lady of the family who married a slave. The late Keeper's physical appearance suggested that this might be true, but there is no proof of it. Another branch of the family, claiming similar descent, formerly lived m Tunis, but now resides in Mecca. The present Keeper of the Key is— F (1) Muhammad ash-Sha'ihi, an elderly man, probably the nephew of the late Keeper, who died in January last and whom this relative was appointed to suce^rl31 ca^yj The following two persons, who have come to notice in connexion with the idtk; activities of expatriated Hejazis against Ibn Sa'ud, are not improbably members Oa^ of one or other branch of this family :— (2) M. Huseyn Sha'iha. —Accompanied Huseyn ad-Dabbagh {q.v.) on his visit to India in 1927. (3) Hasan Sha'iha. —Mentioned in reports from Aden as a Hejazi, who was in 1932 intimate with Huseyn ad-Dabbagh, and had been a school-master at Terim tfAll in Hadhramaut before coming from Mokalla to Aden in March 1932. If of Qeifc sufficient age, he may possibly be identical with the man of the same name, who iran^ was a member for Mecca of the Turkish Parliament for some years, fled from sam^ Constantinople to Mecca in 1916, and at first supported but afterwards turned against King Huseyn. ly^ 88. Sherifian Family. Also called Hashimites by virtue of descent from the great-grandfather of the Prophet, but this name seems to be more particularly affected by the family of King Huseyn. There have been in the past and are in the present numerous families claiming this descent through one or other of the sons of 'Ali, the fourth ! I ' Caliph and son-in-law of the Prophet. There are in Arabia itself many ; individuals bearing the title of Sherif, which is held to imply descent from Hasan, the elder son of 'Ali, and whole clans known collectively as Ashraf. The ? 11 ; strains most conspicuous in the Hejaz trace this descent through an intermediate ^ common ancestor Hasan ibn Abu Numey, who was Grand Sherif of Mecca in the latter part of the 16th century. Three groups of his descendants are accounted J 1 ; 1 specially important, viz.— salwi The Dhawi Zeyd, snujjp The Abadila, a particular branch of whom are the Dhawi 'Aun, and ifil The Dhawi Barakat. All Grand Sherifs of Mecca in the 17th century were drawn from the rival Dhawi Zeyd and Dhawi 'Aun. The last Grand Sherif belonging to the former Areii was 'Abdul-Mutallib, who held the post three times at long intervals. The lelaJ majority belonged to,the Dhawi 'Aun, of whom came the late King Huseyn and lily 1m his sons. Although the most important members of the Sherifian family now live outside Sa'udi Arabia, their connexion with the Hejaz is so close as to justify this » general notice. The following list, very incomplete, shows those who have come T to notice in recent years :— of Jiff (A) Dhdwi Zeyd. ^ | (1) 'AU Haydar. —Now elderly. Formerly resided in Constantinople. , Worked in with the Young Turks and was at one time Minister of Auqaf. Appointed Grand Sherif to supersede King Huseyn in or about 1917, but was naturally unable to assume the post effectively. Sought early in 1926 for British : support in obtaining post of Regent or Governor of Hejaz under Ibn Sa'ud. Moved later that year to Beirut, where he still resides. Has several sons, the eldest of whom Abdul-Mej id is married to a daughter of his namesake, the ex-Caliph, and showed signs of political ambition after the Armistice. One of 'Ali Haydar's wives and the mother of two of his younger sons is of British birth. Yet another son studied at St. Andrew's and had the distinction of acting as best man at the marriage of a Scotch divine at St. Giles' Cathedral. Civilised people, important to keep in mind, though of no obvious political importance at present. piJslii (2) Ja'jar, brother of the above. Also lived in Constantinople. If alive, jriol 1 may be identical with the elderly Sherif 'Ali Ja'far who lived at Lahej in 1932 and was described as a descendant of 'Abdul-Mutallib. M {$) Sharaf 'Adndn Pasha al GMlih Formerly frequented both jlli!- Constantinople and the Hejaz. Spoken of in 1925 as a possible ruler of the Hejaz, if Ibn Sa'ud won the war. Elected president of the Moslem Congress at -0:) Mecca in June 1926, and was later the vehicle of Ibn Sa'ud's refusal to hold another owing to attitude of the 'Ali brothers. Hepresented Ibn Sa ud m 1927 at conference at Jizan to deal with the R-ed Sea Petroleum Company s concession in the Farsan Islands. Described in 1928 as ' grizzled and doddering. Still 15 apf 1 resides in Mecca, but apparently a back number.32 (4) Sharaf Ridha, usually called Sherif Sharaf tout court. —Appointed Acting Minister of Finance under Ibn Sa'ud in January 1926. Resides in Mecca and is now a member of the Legislative Council. (5) Khdlid. —A nephew of the 'Ali Ja'far mentioned at (2). Implicated in the conspiracy against Ibn Sa'ud in 1932 and was active in and around Aden. (B) Dhdwi 'Aun. (6) 'Ali ihn 'Abdullah.- —Formerly Grand Sherif. Dismissed by the Turks in 1907. Resides in Egypt. Described' in June 1932 as an active supporter of the Hizb-al-Ahrar al Hijazi. 'Ali ibn Huseyn. —Ex-King of the Hejaz. Succeeded King Huseyn on his abdication in October 1924, but was compelled to abandon untenable position in Jedda in December 1925. Resides mostly at Bagdad. (8) Faisal ibn Huseyn. —-King of 'Iraq. (9) 'Abdullah ibn Huseyn. —Amir of Transjordan. (10) Zeyd ibn Huseyn. —'Iraqi Minister at Angora. Had a Turkish mother, a granddaughter of the well-known Grand Vizier Reshid Pasha, and has property*interests quite distinct from those of his brothers. All these, except perhaps (10), have issue. So had King Huseyn's brother Nasir, now deceased, who left six sons and four daughters. (C) Dhdwi Barakat. (11) Sharaf ibn 'Abdul-Muhsin. —Seems to have served King Huseyn in Egypt, but entered the service of Ibn Sa'ud and became Amir-al-Arban, or Director of Tribes. Appointed President of the Inspectorate of Government Departments in 1930. Recently returned to Mecca from Egypt, but his present official status is not known, as the inspectorate is understood to have been abolished. p (D) Apparently of the Abadila stock though not of the Dhdwi 'Aun. (12) Shdkir ibn Zeyd ibn Fawwdz. —Formerly Governor of Taif, a post f which seems to have been hereditary in his family. President of the Beduin i Control Board in Transjordan and intimately associated with the Amir 'Abdullah, with whom he has thrown in his lot. A tenacious enemy of Ibn Sa'ud I and much less of a play-boy than his master. 5 r (13) Hamud ibn Zeyd, brother of the preceding.—Lives quietly at Taif. t (14) Sharaf ibn Rdjih, a cousin of (12) and (13).—Said to have also [ been Governor of Taif at one time. Now resides at Bagdad. Identified both in L Jerusalem and Bagdad as being the Sherif Sharaf mentioned by Tahir ij ad-Dabbagh in February 1932, in a letter which fell into the hands of the Sa'udi | Government, as a man who might be enlisted in the conspiracy against Ibn Sa'ud. C (E) Even less easy to place, but perhaps of the A badila. (15) 'Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Mansur. —A younger member of a family, two of whom were prominent in King Huseyn's time and had great influence in the Harb tribe. This 'Ali has only come to notice as having been one of the persons arrested at Mecca and deported to Riyadh at the time of the Ibn Rifada affair in 1932. (16) 'AU ibn Huseyn al Harithi. —One of the Sherifs of Muda'iq, near Taif. Took part in the Arab revolt and is remembered as one of the conquerors of Damascus. Described by Colonel Lawrence as having been at that time an attractive young man, physically splendid and full of courage, resource and energy. Seems to have resettled in the Hejaz, as he was arrested at Mecca and deported to Riyadh at the time of the Ibn Rifada affair in 1932. (17) Muhammad Mohanna. —One of the Jedda family, one member of which was Chief of the Controlling Department in 1917, and was then described as a 'bottle-nosed bandit,' while his brother, still alive ; was said to have acquired wealth by smuggling and general robbery. This Muhammad is only interesting because he was arrested at Jedda and sent to Riyadh at the time of the Ibn Rifada affair.j/Hjl (18) and (19) M. 'All and Muhammad al-Bedeywi (a corruption of Bedawi), e ^ Members of a family distantly related to King Huseyn and formerly important i T in the Juheyna tribe and in the coast towns of the Northern Hejaz. Despite the j Si similarity of name, they would appear to be two distinct, though closely related, H persons. Both were mixed up in the Ibn Eifada affair in 1932. M.'Ali became an object of attention in Trans Jordan and was more or less arrested in July to the displeasure of the 'Amir. Muhammad seems to have been in trade at Suez and Dhaba and was concerned in attempts to get supplies by sea to Ibn Rifada. It esupj, was probably he who was reported killed in the defeat of the rebels. l m 89. Suleymdn Shefiq Pasha Kemaly. intenjj ^ former Turkish officer, now over 60. Rose to high military and adminis trative rank in the Turkish service. Served the Turks as Governor of 'Asir and Vali of Basra before the war. Was one of Damad Ferid Pasha's Ministers of War during armistice period. Left Turkey later in consequence of his anti- i Tiifi r Kemalist associations and fetched up in Jedda in February 1926. Employed pij later in that year by Ibn Sa'ud and promised to be important among his advisers. Expounded views about future of oil, &amp;c., near Wejh and in the Farsan Islands to acting British agent in August 1926. Became apparently Inspector-General of fe:; Government Departments, but met with opposition and was put in charge of roads in 1928. Was responsible for heavy expenditure with little result on portion of the Mecca-Jedda road. Appears to be now no more than a pensioner of Ibn Sa'ud and lives mostly at Taif. A back number. Brother to, but not known -- : to be specially intimate with the once well-known Turkish diplomat Ghalib ., V Kemaly, who was stated in 1927 to be vice-president of the Russo-Turkish ^ . company, with headquarters at Moscow, which shipped the Tomp cargo to Jedda. te oi fe- . 90. Suwayt Family. Leaders in the Dhafir tribe. Two members of it have figured in recent reports from Kuwait, viz.— (1) J a'dan, a disgruntled man, hovering between allegiance to King Faisal ( ; j r or to Ibn Sa'ud and too proud to come to terms with either; and (2) 'Ajemi, recognised as chief of the tribe by Ibn Sa'ud. wi l| iem yofi91. M. Taufiq Bey Sherif. Syrian ex-officer in Turkish army, of remoter Yemeni origin. At one time uiethi secretary to Ahmed as-Senusi. Later head of the divan of the 'Amir Faysal at aid to k Mecca. Figured as an 'Asiri delegate at the Moslem Congress in Mecca in June Idem® 1926, and was appointed Secretary-General after an election hotly contested by li 0 v the 'All brothers, who complained that 'Asir was not, in fact, represented and that Ibn Sa'ud was packing the congress. Went to India later in that month to combat the 'All brothers and make propaganda for Ibn Sa'ud. Floated in and out of the Hejaz in subsequent years and had hopes of great preferment with a mandate to reorganise the administration. Had very variable relations with Ibn Sa'ud during this period. Finally broke with him so acutely that in June 1931 he decamped secretly in a pilgrim ship bound for India. The Sa'udi authorities :aW accused him at that time of being concerned in a plot for circulating forged ['0 rupees on a large scale, but did not pursue the charge, which may have been oiieO- trumped up. He later published violent attacks on the Sa'udi Administration. J®PI Has since ranged about in India and countries beyond the land frontier. Engages in trade as well as political adventure. Intelligent and active, but volatile; a uda'ii superior type of adventurer, who might again make his peace with Ibn Sa'ud and ft play a role in this country. Closely associated in the past with Mahmud Nedim,, former Turkish Vali of the Yemen, who seems to have gone to earth in Constan- ^ r tinople in his old age, after a long and curious post-war career; and with Ismail Ghuznavi (q.v.). May still be in touch with the latter, despite his breach with Ibn Sa'ud. 0$ ■' ^ 92. A bu Tuqeyqa Family. P 0 j# Formerly chiefs of the Tihama, mainly Hejazi, section of the Huweytat tribe, Jiv with an urban connexion at Dhaba. Rafi'a, their common ancestor, was chiei ot j ]e til the tribe prior to his death in about 1870. One of his many grandsons, Ahmed [88611 F34 1U7(j, ibn Muhammad ibn Rafi'a, was chief in 1917. He came to notice in 1924 as one'ipired of several Hejazi sheykhs who approached the Residency in Cairo with a if a complaint of King Huseyn's tyranny and his inability to protect them against th^allal Wahhabis. He appears to have been Governor of Dhaba in 1927, but in that year, git the family were apparently in serious trouble with the Government, as it is ^ 1 that Ahmed and four others were ' killed by Ibn Sa'ud,' and others fled to Egypt; Numerous members of the family were concerned in the rebel invasion of the Hejazfjas 1 by Ibn Rifada in 1932. Seven of them lost their lives in that adventure and iWjrff more were reported by the Sa'udi commander to have been slain after Ibn RifadaV^ il defeat. Among the survivors was, however— : j| 1.^ (1) Muhammad ibn [ -^ ] ^4 hdurrahim ihn Alwdnihn Rafi a, who was regarded,fliW as co-leader with Ibn Rifada. He escaped, and after many vicissitudes leftii^ 'Aqaba for Egypt early in October 1932. May be the person against whom an d^ exclusion order was made in Egypt rather later, but whose name is given asi^ 1 Muhammad bin Ahmed. pji Another probable survivor is— (2) Mahmud ihn Ahmed ihn Rafi'a, who ratted on Ibn Rifada early in the ito rebellion and tried to make his peace with Ibn Sa'ud. uJ Although the above summary cannot be verified at all points, it is inserted inM view of the obvious tenacity of the family hatred of Ibn Sa'ud, and the survival of (1), who seems to have been an active leader and may crop up again. ifa 93. TurMihn Madhi. Mm Was in 1932 Inspector-General of 'Asir and was associated with Fahadrf' ibn Zu'ayr in efforts to make Ibn Sa'ud realise the gravity of the situation preceding the open revolt of the Idrisi at the end of October. Identical with the ^ 01 person mis-named at the time 'Abdullah ibn Turki ibn Mahdi, who, with Abdul- W Wahhab Abu Malha and two chiefs of Asiri tribes, was sent on a mission to the ® ^ Imam Yahya in June 1927. Took part in further negotiations with the Imam ™ early in 1928. Would therefore appear to be one of Ibn Sa'ud's experts in 'Asir |M and Yemen affairs, but no further information regarding him is at present available. ii«g( 94. Weis, Leopold, alias M. Asadullah ' Vyce.' An Austrian convert to Islam. Born at Lemberg in 1900. Record a little obscured by confusion at one time between him and a German aviator of the same name. Appears to have embraced Islam with numerous Germans in or before 1926, under the auspices of Dr. Jabbar Khair, who introduced him to Ibn Sa'ud. Came to Mecca apparently in 1926, and spent most of his time in the Hejaz, including a long sojourn in Medina, until he left in 1932 for India, intending to go ultimately to China. By profession a journalist. Suspected of Communist attaches; so much so that Dr. Jabbar Khair himself came later to the conclusion that his converts were Communists turned Moslem to be able to penetrate Moslem communities. Speaks Arabic and fair English. Married several Arab girls, one of whom is now with him in India, where he is said to be on a lecturing tour. 95. Yahya an Nasri. Principal quarantine doctor at Jedda. A Syrian, like most doctors, now employed by the Sa'udi Government. Probably about 40. Studied in Constantinople and Beirut. Previously quarantine doctor at Yanbu'. Pleasant and well regarded by the Legation. Speaks Turkish and French. 96. Yusuf Yasin. Probably born about 1898. A Syrian from Latakia, said by his enemies to be of Yezidi origin. Was at school in Jerusalem in 1917. Joined King Faisal at 'Aqaba and went with him to Damascus. Left on the approach of the French and joined King Huseyn in M;ecca. Attached by him to the Amir 'Abdullah at Amman, with whom he remained six months. Formed so low an opinion of the Amir that according to his own account he broke with Huseyn in consequence. Joined Ibn Sa'ud in due course. Came to Mecca in 1924-25 and started the Umm-al-Qura newspaper. Figured as a Nejdi delegate at the Moslem Congress35 of June 1926. Remained editor of the TJmm-al-Qura for some years, but was also official Director of Publicity. Took part in negotiations with' Sir G. Clayton in 1925, 1927 and 1928. Acted as Minister for Foreign Affairs in absence of Dr. 'Abdullah Damluji in 1926 and 1927. Reported in 1928 to have worked to undermine influence both of Damluji, who resigned that year, and of Hafiz Wahba {q.v) Employed in various negotiations and again acted at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, for Fuad Hamza early in 1931, and for the 'Amir Faysal and Fuad as well in 1932, but has for some years been principally important as a personal secretary to the King, who made him head of the political section of his diwan in 1930, and whom he always accompanies. Was notorious for his obstructiveness during the Clayton negotiations, and is naturally obstinate and hair-splitting in discussion, but can on occasion be amiable and even conciliatory. Takes his cue, in fact, from the King himself, to whom he appears to be genuinely devoted, and who probably trusts him as much as any of his near advisers except 'Abdullah Suleyman. Is probably a more convinced Wahhabi than most of the King's alien entourage and is also a strong Arab nationalist, with fewer ulterior motives than Fuad Hamza, having a simpler character and less European knowledge. Has the eyes of a fanatic. Works very hard. Though a very useful factotum to the King, is rather a butt in high circles. A facile and sometimes intemperate writer, still responsible for contributions to the Umm-al-Qura. Speaks only Arabic well, but can manage a little English. 97. Zawdwi Family. A Mecca family, worth mentioning because one of them, viz., Yusuf 'AU az-Zawdwi appears to have been concerned at Cairo in 1932 in plots against Ibn Sa'ud; and because this or another Zawawi may have been in reality the person who went to France in the summer to buy arms for the conspirators. The man who went to buy the arms was first described as being Muhammad Pasha az-Zawi [sic'], and was afterwards identified at Aden as being Hamid Pasha al-Wadi, then head of the Amir 'Abdullah's diwan. It is difficult to reconcile this with what is known of Hamid Pasha al-Wadi's movements about that time. Anyhow, whoever went to buy the arms, whether Zawi, Zawawi or Wadi, was associated with another person ' Abdul-Qadir Hamad ba-Hamid, and the names may have got mixed up.ill' THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—(Received Auqust 16.) (No. 237.) Sir, Jedda, July 26, 1933. WITH reference to my telegram No. 140 of the 20th instant regarding the present position between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies, in translation, of the confidential note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and of a document, purporting to be a telegram sent from Eiadh by King Abdul Aziz to Amir Feisal at Taif, both of which were left with me by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, Minister of Finance, upon his visit of the 20th instant, the nature of which was recounted in my telegram under reference. The absence of Fuad Bey Hamza at Jerusalem has left the Ministry for Foreign Affairs with no really responsible and capable official, so that it is not a matter for surprise that Ibn Saud should have instructed his son to entrust his appeal to His Majesty's Government for advice to so experienced a Minister as Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman. 2. I do not propose to retrace the conversation, which has already been,. I think, sufficiently outlined in my telegram under reference, save to record the exceptional earnestness with which the Minister described the very delicate relations now subsisting between this country and that of the Imam Yahya. He reiterated the charge of bad faith and of a deliberately provocative policy which, if pursued much further, would soon leave Ibn Saud no alternative but a resort to force. Ibn Saud's policy was pacific, but any encroachment upon his territories would be resisted ' until not a man is left alive.' 3. The claims for the restitution of territory that have so thoroughly upset the Saudi Government are defined in the telegram from Ibn Saud to Amir Feisal as '' the territories of the Idrisi and the districts of Qahtan and Hamazan in Asir.' I am not clear that this is a cool demand for the evacuation of the whole of Asir, but it unquestionably means a very considerable slice of that province. Qahtan is a little obscure, and Hamazan I have so far been unable to identify. The Handbook of Arabia, vol. I, Chapter V, on Asir, p. 132, states 'in the south-eastern interior of the region live the six Qahtan tribes, each an autonomous unit, and none of them to be confounded with the nomad Qahtan of the south western region of Central Arabia.' Yet no mention of the Qahtan is made in the list of inland tribes at p. 134, though they are referred to at the foot of p. 137 as breeders of horses and the most enterprising traders of the interior. It would therefore seem likely that the perturbation of Ibn Saud arises from attempts of the Imam to suborn these tribes from their nominal, and perhaps divided, allegiance to King Abdul Aziz. I have recently received reports, in which I do not at present place much reliance, that Imam Yahya, through the intrigues of his eldest son, by subsidy and by the taking^pf hostages, has, indeed, established himself strongly with the tribes of the Naj^tn. 4. Copies of this despatch are being sent to His Majesty's Ambassador at Rome, His Majesty's High Commissioners for Egypt and Transjordan, to His Majesty's Chief Commissioner at Aden and to the senior naval officer in the Red Sea sloops, and a paraphrase of my telegram under reference is being sent to His Majesty's High Commissioners for Egypt and Transjordan. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVEET. [879 q—1]2 Enclosure 1 in No. 1. ■ jS otM Minister for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires. (Translation.) (Confidential.) The Hon. Charge d'Affaires, Taif, July 10, 1933. i I HAVE the honour to inform you of the following, requesting that you would be good enough to communicate it as soon as possible to the authorities ? g concerned in His Britannic Majesty's Government. The fact is that for the past year continuous news has been received by us regarding the export of arms and 'jl ammunition from Asmara, but we are not certain of their source. Various « rumours have been current latterly regarding the arrival of quantities to the t ] Idrisi from Massawa in consecutive consignments, and that there is a hope that t0 ' arms will be forwarded from the Italian colonies, and we have confirmed this through persons who are in the country of Imam Yahya, from Massawa and from news we receive from Jizan. This matter must not be treated lightly. This fact was further confirmed to us by the change of the Imam Yahya during his negotiations with our delegation, as explained to you by our representative, Abdullah-al-Suleiman, and it appears that the Imam Yahya wishes to provoke us and to excite us to oppose him. We have therefore decided to discuss the matter very frankly with the British Government, believing that they are interested in the matter, whether on our part for the sake of our friendship with them (His Majesty's Government), or for the sake of the Yemen, or for other parties whose intentions and desires the British Government are not aware of, and if the matter interests the British Government as we think, we therefore ask them two things :— First: To agree with them (His Majesty's Government) upon the case of the Yemen, and we will give them (His Majesty's Government) under takings in respect of certain affairs which interest them, and they to give undertakings to us in respect of affairs which interest us. Second : To seek their (His Majesty's Government) assistance in every case in accordance with the friendship which exists between two friends. The supplies and ammunition which have been supplied, and will be supplied, to the other parties cannot come except from two sources : either from the Italian Government or from certain Amirs of the Islam and Arabs and who have certain intentions and desires. If this matter interests the British Government, we should like to know to what extent the British Government will assist us in tiiis case. The position is critical, and what should be avoided will occur shortly, as it seems to us, if God wills, and we must take the necessary precautions and preparation. Our preparation will be only to oppose Yahya and the Idrisi together, but we cannot do anything with foreign parties, so long as the friendly communications and relations existing between us and the British Government are as we know them. As the matter is important and urgent, I request you would be good enough to furnish me with the reply as soon as possible regarding the opinion of the British Government in this connexion. With highest respects, FEISAL, Minister for Foreign Affairs. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. (Translation.) Ibn Saud to Amir Feisal. My son Feisal, July 16-17, 1933. WE have received the following telegraphic message from the delegation at Sana and forward it for your information :— A1 Amri and A1 Mitahhar came to us on Monday, deputed by the Imam Yahya as representatives, to enter negotiations with us, and after the exchange of compliments we started discussion. They said to us that they had somethingM our to say concerning the frontier, and we asked them to explain their intentions clearly so that we may know them and understand their meaning, but they requested us to postpone this till the next meeting. The second meeting was held to-day, and after a long preliminary discourse on the good faith of the Imam ^1, kv Yahya, and that he does not like misunderstandings between the two countries, ; they (the representatives) informed us with shame in their faces that they want eto| f : the restitution of the Idrisi's territory and the districts of Qahtan and Hamazan istW in Asir to their original home (country), because they are part of the territory of the Imam Yahya. They added there is no difference between both parties, and ir S( J that His Majesty the King did not enter the Idrisi's territory until after the if (w Idrisi had taken refuge with him. Now the Idrisi is completely routed, so that tlele 18 there is no reason t0 Prevent His Majesty the King from restoring the said territories to their original country. They also proposed other trifling matters. \[. 0 We answered them that we definitely do not agree to discuss anything connected J Liji: with the territory (?

They J appeared to be annoyed at this, and informed us that they would communicate VCi our speech to the Imam Yahya and would give us a reply. We also wished to ^ discuss with them the question of the Idrisi remaining at Zohb Ha jar and his ^5 misdeeds, but they did not answer this.

WITH reference to my printed despatch No. 240 of the 27th July last, relative to the present situation between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a further note from the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs, which, like its predecessor, the enclosure to my despatch No. 237, was handed to me by the Minister of Finance. 2. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman had not left Taif when the special messenger sent from Jedda with my note No. 109 (the enclosure to the despatch under reference) arrived, so that he had already seen the communication and was aware of the nature of the advice offered by His Majesty's Government when I called on him on the morning of the 30th July. 3. Our conversation on this occasion was of a general nature. As I reported in my telegram No. 146 of that day, he declared the situation in the Najran district continued materially unchanged; that the Saudi delegation remained, unwillingly, in the Imam's capital, a suggestion to resume negotiations on the recovery of the Imam having been made by the Imam's representatives; that the desires of Ibn Saud remained steadfastly pacific and that he would not be the first to start hostilities, but that, nevertheless, there was a limit to a policy of patience. I strongly impressed on Sheikh Abdullah the great importance attached by His Majesty's Government to a studiously unprovocative attitude on the part of Ibn Saud, and alluded to the dangers which an armed clash between the two parties would arouse. He rejoined that Ibn Saud's own inclinations fell in with the counsel of His Majesty's Government in every respect, but forbearance would be construed by the King's enemies as weakness. He handed me the note as I was taking my leave. 4. Sheikh Abdullah's visit to me of this morning, in which he informed me of the enforced detention of the Saudi delegation at Sana, the prevention by the Imam of communication between the delegation and its own Government, and between Hamad Suleiman, a member of the delegation, and his brother, the Minister himself, has, I think, been sufficiently reported in my telegram No. 149 of to-day. . i ui i. 5. I have been at some pains to ascertain, as far as may be possible, the extent of the territorial demands of Imam Yahya, in view of the declaration of the Saudi Minister in London that the restitution of the whole of the Asir had been the opening bid of the Imamic delegation at the abortive conference at Sana. Little seems to be known, with precision, by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, or, as already reported by Sir Andrew Ryan, by Fuad Bey Hamza either, of the geography of this somewhat Caledonian country, and the Minister of Finance has had recourse to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for information he admits he at present does not possess. He is, however, clear that the whole of Asir has not been demanded, although the territories to which claim is laid, the lormer territories of the Idrisi, or, roughly, Tihamat Asir, with the districts o^ the Beni Qahtan and Hamazan, form the lion's share of the province^ Hamazan remains obscure, but Sheikh Abdullah states that it is a district, inhabited by a number of tribes, adjoining that of the Beni Qahtan. A perusal of recent press reproductions of parts of Fuad Bey Hamza's book, in so far as Asir is concernea, fails to shed more light, but I think it may be agreed that the approximate territorial demands of the Imam now stand out with sufficient distinctness tor practical purposes. . . , 6.

WITH reference to your confidential letter No. 109, dated the 4th Rabi- ath-Thani, 1352 (27th July, 1933), I request that you would be good enough to communicate the following to the British Government;— 1. We appreciate the trouble taken by the British Government in approaching the Italian Government in this respect, and we express our gratitude for the same. 2. Outwardly Italy may deny, but the fact is that Massaua has become a main centre for supplying the Idrisi and the Imam Yahya with arms and ammunition and encouraging them both together. This has been confirmed to us. We have learnt from another source that Soviet ships carried arms and ammunition to the Yemen coasts. Will the British Government remain neutral in this matter ? b If the movement of the Idrisi takes place in the future, it cannot be regarded as internal movement, because we previously on the first occasion considered it to be of this nature, but after we granted pardon to the Idrisi in accordance with the request of the Imam Yahya and his undertakings to prevent him (the Idrisi) from taking any hostile action. In this present case of hostile action by the Idrisi in the future, it would mean that he would undoubtedly be encouraged and assisted by the Imam Yahya and supported by the second party. We could not keep silent about the source supporting and encouraging this action. 4. We overlooked the incidents of Najran and the violation by the Imam Yahya of our frontiers, and took no action in respect of such aggressions, and all this was by the might and power of God and not through our weakness or failure, but due to our hope to reach a satisfactory solution through our representatives sent to the Yemen. Yahya adopted a disgraceful attitude towards our representa tives and used all manner of rudeness, insolence and excess in his demands. We wish now to take no action before we are certain as to the advice of the British Government and the limit of the connexions they may entertain with incidents which may occur in future. We still await their advice in this connexion 5. The inability of the Government to repay to the British Government the cost of arms is not due to our negligence or failure, but unavoidable circumstances and general economic conditions are the main reasons for this. We fully believe that the excellent disposition of the British Government is greater than this in view of the friendship existing between us. I therefore request that I may receive as soon as possible the advice of the British Government in respect of the fore going, together with the information which they may have received regarding the attitude of the Italian Government in this connexion.

( fe- ■ (0-13 Oehfl&amp;WTMl HEOOfiOS, Section 3. ||4 V No. 1. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—(Received August 16.) (No. 233.) Sir, Jedda, July 25, 1933. WITH reference to my telegrams No. 141 and No. 143 of the 21st and 22nd July respectively, relative to the case of two girls who took refuge with this Legation on the 15th July as escaped slaves seeking manumission, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a memorandum prepared by Captain B. W. Seager, in which the course of events is succinctly summarised. 2. The case presented certain unusual features from the outset, but the attitude of the local authorities was not of a nature calculated to assist a prompt and detailed study of it. The discussion described by Captain Seager as having passed between himself and the representative of the Governor of Jedda, corresponded very closely with that between Sheikh Ali Taha and myself, and in each case was most harmonious in character, although it was plain, from the unusual energy with which the local authorities were pursuing the question, that powerful interests were involved and that considerable pressure was being brought to bear upon the Governor. 3. In spite of the assurances of the Saudi authorities, I felt bound to insist on a full enquiry into the facts before the girls left the shelter of the Legation. It was a little difficult to detect a motive which would lead free girls voluntarily to declare themselves slaves, whilst the motive actuating a slave-owner in representing runaway slaves to be free in order to obtain possession of them again was not so far to seek. The girls' story, moreover, was circumstantial and consistent, well-told and tenaciously held. 4. I invited the co-operation of the local authorities in a full investigation, and, as this was withheld, authorised the enquiry to proceed at once independently. The proposal made by Sheikh Ali Taha that I should agree to the case being investigated by the local Sharia Cpurt I felt unable to accept, particularly as he attached the condition that the girls should in the meantime be handed over to the local authorities. I, however, referred this question to you in my first telegram under reference, as I felt that a ruling on a point, which, so far as we are aware here, has never arisen before, would be useful. 5. The memorandum describes the course of the investigation and the eleventh-hour confession of the girls. I saw Sheikh Ali Taha shortly after the true facts had been established, arranged to hand the girls over to him, and pointed out that much ado would have been spared the Legation if the Saudi authorities had shown a readier response to our request for their collaboration— with which Parthian shot the incident closed. 6. The question of principle, in regard to the Sharia Court, remains, and I would be grateful if, in due course, I might be favoured with your views for guidance should a similar case arise in future. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVEET. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum hy Captain Seager. ON the morning of the 20th July I received a telephone call from Sheikh Ali Taha, the Deputy-Governor and Assistant Under-Secretary tor Foreign Affairs, who, speaking in his capacity as Deputy-Governor, intorme me that two sisters who had taken refuge in the Chancery building on the [879 q—3]15th July last were not slave girls, and therefore he would be glad if they could r f j be handed back at once to the local authorities. In reply, I told him that his 18 f } news was rather surprising, as, according to the girls' interrogatories, there if J seemed little reason to doubt that they were slaves. However, in view of the ® rltt r fact that the local Government contested the case, the Legation would be glad, as usual, to see any alleged relatives or guardians of the girls at the Chancery, W f, who would doubtless soon prove their claim to our satisfaction. Ali Taha ^ demurred to this, and stated that detailed enquiries made by all the local J authorities concerned, including the police, had elicited the fact that the girls fc 0 ! were free and had never been slaves. He added that if we could not accept the IP ! local Government's word for this, we could send the girls to the Sharia Court, where they could soon be identified as ordinary citizens. I hastened to assure Sheikh Ali Taha at this point that we had no reason at all to doubt that the local b 1 ' 0 ^ Government's enquiry had been comprehensive and painstaking, but that we, on our side, wished to complete our own investigations. In these circumstances, I prayed him to assist us by allowing the case to take its normal course, viz., by ^ the early attendance here of an alleged relative or relatives, guardian oV guardians, with whom we could amicably discuss the matter in the first instance, i I asked the sheikh here to co-operate with us in a matter which, on the face of it, I f 51 c appeared comparatively simple. But Sheikh Ali Taha again demurred. He said that the girls were free, and, if necessary, the local Government would give jiffltsta the Legation a certificate to this effect. In reply I pointed out that these girls had taken refuge at the Chancery; that we had at the moment every reason to ®^ believe that they were slaves, and, in these circumstances, all we asked for was lltowoid for their co-operation in assisting us to complete our own formalities. I thanked itico him for his offer, but told him that, though we appreciated the Government's 1 Ise good faith, we could not. for the time being, solve the problem in this way. (At jiegi this juncture Sheikh Ali Taha rang off, saying that he would return to the charge ■ fl fk later, after he had consulted his chief.) fctol 2. I took the opportunity of this respite to send for the two girls. I told iljestrs them that we had now heard that there was every reason to believe that thev were iiti not slaves, and that, if it were found out later that they were in fact free I i girls, the consequences to them would be serious. Neither blandishments nor iesk wiles, nor hectoring nor intimidation would shake them. The younger sister km burst into tears during the cross-examination, but separately and jointly they reiterated that they were slave girls, and that their interrogalion papers, drawn iia up five days previously, represented the true history of the case. 1 saw that it ife was useless to continue. I sent them away, and told them to talk over the matter ito together for a quarter of an hour, when I would send for them again and expect ipir] to hear the truth. (I made it easy for them to confess gracefully and without penalty, and dilated on the fearsome consequences of an obstinate persistence in their story.) 3. bheikh Ali Taha rang up again a few minutes later. W^e went over the same ground I persisted that alleged relatives or guardians should visit the Chancery m the first instance, while he insisted that the two girls should be sent to the Sharia Court at once. As no progress was made, Ali Taha rang off A few minutes later I went to discuss the matter with head of Chancery when we were mterrupted by a telephone call from Sheikh Ali Taha, who asked for an interview with Mr. Calvert. I told him that I would speak to Mr. Calvert and oive him a reply m due course. &amp; 4. In consultation with Mr. Oppenheim I sent for the two girls as arranged and again saw them separately and jointly. We saw the younger sister first. 1 asked her to remember our previous talk, and to tell me finally whether she was a slave girl In reply she stated clearly and categorically that she was a slave girl, and had been treated as such m her master's house. I put further questions, but again nothing would shake her testimony. We then saw the other sister, and repeated the process, with the same result. Further questions were put to both o them but they remained adamant. In view of their immovable attitude, we t^T^i^ e Ar X TT reported thmatter t0 Mr - Calvert, who agreed to see hneikh All Taha at 12-45 p.m. thp mnrnL S ^n? r t I ir a ^i e f 1 T li i rie? 0n j the Same evenin g (the 20th July), and on .•« thfi kfll i 7 '. m . 0 u t0 get a™? 161, information about the girls' ?hTt M tw a g master g house. The result of these enquiries indicated that (a)there was reason to believe that the girls were not slaves; and they3 €&gt; „ lf were reputed to be of bad moral character. As soon as I heard this I made every ; rt) ?ieffort to get hold of the girls' alleged relatives in order to complete the : il1 ^investigations before the local Government returned to the charge. I discovered 'Nlthat a British Indian well known to me occupied a house next to that of their ia f4( ('alleged master. I urged him to get into immediate touch with any of the % girls' alleged relatives and to send them to me at the earliest opportunity. On •^Jllsthe evening of the 21st July Sheikh All Taha asked for a further interview with 'U^Mr. Calvert, when it was arranged that the further meeting should take place '^iiotiat midday on the 22nd July. tltil 6 - At 9 A M ' on tJle morning of the 22nd July the girls' alleged mother, fe:* uncle and two brothers called on me at the Chancery, where, in conjunction with MitiljMr. Oppenheim and with the assistance of the Legation translator, a detailed |Im^Investigation was held. e a% 7 - '' h® girls were summoned and confronted with their alleged relatives, lalunput for two hours no progress was made, in spite of repeated questioning and 1%. cross-examining. This was in part due to the stupidity of the alleged relatives Uli^and to the defiant and obstinate attitude of the girls. Eventually it was decided Uit to q uestion eac ^ w i tnes s separately and alone, which would, at the same time, give ijjJthe girls an opportunity of talking over their difference with their alleged relatives in the corridor. No progress was made for another half hour, until, all ^' expedients having apparently been exhausted, both girls were summoned and ut .J questioned for the last time. Without further ado thev brazenly confessed that ' they were not slave girls, and that they had taken refuge at the Chancery in .i.,;!', order to avoid a beating or worse at the hands of their brother for an act of ,®- indiscretion committed when he was away in Taif. e W g This eleventh-hour confession was a veritable anti-climax. It is assumed that the girls had patched up their family differences in the corridor, and had mtilconfessed when it suited them. As it was nearing midday, I informed Mr. Calvert of the result of the enquiry, and at 110 p.m ., on instructions from ''■■His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, I handed over the two girls to a policeman, who nebthad been sent round to Chancery by Sheikh All Taha. wiij 9. This case could have been settled very much earlier if the local ilaiJiikauthorities had co-operated with us and sent the girls' relatives to Chancery k iiittwo days previously. This they would not do, with a result that the incident ■Ijishowed signs of assuming more serious dimensions. As for the girls, they proved id pjiconsummate and facile liars, and succeeded in holding their relatives at bay for Isiclose on three hours. This case would appear to create a precedent. It would be I (^interesting to know what our position would have been if these girls had in fact jjaiiii'een slave girls and had maintained their claim to the end. irf jiiiiil 'fdrf'l tsW [i# ioW iWeij perrl iii all# fi Mljailj ate pi(I c THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF H IS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT 3 EASTERN (A rabia). &lt;4 ^ August 24, 1933.

It was further stated by the Italian Government that, according to their information, the Imam had no desire to pick a quarrel with His Majesty King Ibn Saud. 2. I am to emphasise that this clearly shows that the Italian Government are prepared to act in the spirit of their understanding with His Majesty's Government, that both Governments should refrain from intervening in conflicts in Arabia and should exert their influence in the cause of peace. 3. Apart from other considerations (which would, however, lead them to the same conclusions) His Majesty's Government are bound by this undertaiking to urge upon His Majesty King Ibn Saud the importance of adhering to his welcome and statesmanlike decision to avoid hostilities with Imam Yahya if possible, and they are under an obligation, if hostilities should unfortunately break out, to maintain an attitude of strict neutrality.

The pretext first advanced by the Imamic delegates to delay the departure of their guests, according to my Saudi informants, viz., that negotiations could be resumed upon the recovery of the Imam from his present sickness, was, indeed, a postponement to too remote and indefinite a date to be acceptable. Imam Yahya's illness seems not only genuine, but serious, and you will doubtless be already aware of the reports that the King of Egypt and the King of Iraq have each sent two of their private physicians to his aid. 3.

We are very grateful for the reply of the British Government indicated in the two notes under reference relative to the situation between the Government of His Majesty and the Yemen, and their attention to this case for the cause of peace and friendship. 2. The intention of approaching His Britannic Majesty's Government m this respect is for three matters only :—- (a) The firm friendship existing between us and His Britannic Majesty s Government causes us to lay before them all difficulties which may confront us either with the Arab Governments or with the other Governments, for consultation between two friends, for exchange oi views and for knowing the attitude of the British Government towards those difficulties. [879 aa—3]I (b) In view of what we understand about the agreement between the British Government and the Italian Government by which they have undertaken not to interfere in the Arab coast, we find that the Italian colonies on the African coast have become an asylum to the Idrisi party, and that he receives money and arms from that place, and this is contrary to the known attitude. We therefore wish to enquire from the British Government whether any change has happened to this agreement, to cause the Italian colonies to become the centre of such action. The reply of the British Government shows that this agreement still remains outwardly, but the fact is that we have become certain that hostile actions still continue. We therefore wish to know the advice of the British Government in respect of this suspected attitude on the part of the Italian Government. (c) We explain to the British Government hereunder the attitude which we will follow with the Imam Yahya in respect of his repeated aggressions, and if he agrees to and accepts them it will be as desired, otherwise God may excuse us; people and humanity may acquit us of meeting him with the same :— (1) We will request him to make apology and to give necessary satisfaction to us in respect of the treatment with which he treated the Saudi Arab delegation at Sana preventing them from communi cating with us, detaining them as though they were criminals and preventing them from returning to us. This fact cannot be tolerated by the honour of any nation all over the world and cannot be allowed by the general rules and laws of Governments or tolerated by (manlv) self-respects. J/ (2) His treatment of and assistance to the Idrisi and placing 1 him in the extremities of the frontiers is contrary to the treaty which was concluded between the Government of His Majesty the King and him (Imam ^ ahya), and which was signed by the representatives of the Go\ernment of His Majesty the King and his representatives, and was ratified by His Majesty the King and by him. His insistence upon the stay of the Idrisi in the extremities of the frontiers clearly shows the intention of taking evil action, picking quarrels and creating disturbances. We are therefore compelled to request that the Idrisi may be delivered to us in pursuance of the treaty or he may be deported far from the extremities of the frontiers (3) We cannot agree to keep silent till the end in respect of ^ajran and the entry of the forces of Yahya within our frontiers, but his advance and aggression should be stopped, and we may then come to an understanding about the delimitation of the frontiers which have already been agreed upon and confirmed to us by the Imam Yahya. It he does not agree to come to an understanding in this connexion the position will then be difficult and should not be neglected.

This is what we wish to demand from Imam Yahya at the present time and we explain it to His Britannic Majesty's Government so that they may be aware that we do not desire hostility in any case. 4. We wish to say that, if His Britannic Majesty's Government have any observations, we are prepared to listen to their views in view of the friendship existing between us. r With highest respects, FEISAL, Minister for Foreign Affairs.3 Enclosure 2 in No. 1.

I AM requested by the Government of His Majesty the King to inform you of the following, with a view to its communication to the authorities concerned ir His Britannic Majesty's Government:— 2. The Imam Yahya, in one of the meetings which were held between the delegation of the Government of His Majesty the King and the Imam Yahya, said that the Italian Government's representative (who has been deputed for the purpose of renewing the treaty which was concluded between the Imam Yahya and the Italian Government, which expires in a year and a half, and who (the representative) was at that time in Sana and is said to have left a week before the return of the delegation without arriving at any useful result), asked the Imam Yahya in one of their meetings about his point of view regarding the Idrisi's territory and Asir. He added that the Italian Government have certain views and intentions in regard to these territories, and that they have not recognised them as belonging to the Government of Ibn Saud. The Imam answered him saying that he also had not recognised Ibn Saud s claim either to the territory or to Asir. Both of them demand them (the two territories) for themselves. He (the Imam Yahya) asked the Italian representative to com municate to him the advice of his Government as to how he should attain his intentions and whether this should be done in a military or in a peaceful manner. Immediately after that, the Italian representative asked his Government tor their advice, and he subsequently informed Yahya that his Government did not wish to express their views in this connexion, but that they requested that the Imam should give his own opinion first and state his intentions and objects. I e Imam Yahya then changed the subject and did not tell the delegation about the remainder of the Italian Government's reply. There is no doubt that the Imam s intention was only to pick a quarrel and to threaten. He requested the delegation very strictly not to mention this statement to any one. , . , , 3. The Imam Yahya sent a letter to His Majesty the King through the Saudi Arab delegation, requesting him to recognise Haj ran as belonging e Imam Yahya and that other matters could be postponed until . e delegation communicated the contents of the letter to His Majesty the Kmg y wireless from Jizan. His Majesty the King replied that this was impossib e an that he could not agree to it unless they came to an agreement over all the ma ers in dispute. No reply has yet been received about this from the Imam Y anya. [907 m—2]4.

WITH reference to Mr. Hope GilFs despatch No. 160 of the 31st March, 1932, paragraph 4, relative to the activ ities of Mr. K. S. Twitchell in regard to the Jedda water supply, I have the honour to report that water has again been brongfrT^ the wells at Waziriya, and the event was ceremonially inaugurated on the 26th August in the presence of the Minister of Finance, local notables, and a large gathering of townspeople. As the result of the discovery of a fresh spring, to the south-east of the wells themselves, work has been in progress for some months past, under the direction of Sheikh Muhammad Dehlavi and experts of the Mecca water supply of Ain Zubeyda. The water has been led through the old pipes, put down in Turkish times, and now falls into the Idarus reservoir, situated on the outskirts of one of the poorer quarters of the town. The present rate of flow, according to Mr. Twitchell, who still shows active interest in this undertaking, is 40 gallons per minute, and this, he says, it will shortly be possible to increase to as much as three times that amount on the completion of work on a second conduit which runs alongside the first, but which is not yet connected over its entire length. 2. Mr. Twitchell points out that here there is an ample and cheap water supply sufficient for the needs of the town, whose present rate of consumption he places at 38 gallons per minute. Although other local experts would estimate the local rate of consumption at probably not more than 24 gallons per minute, it may be conceded that the new source of supply is more than sufficient, is cheap (for it costs nothing at the Idarus reservoir), and at present is reasonably safe at source. The Indian Medical Officer attached to this Legation recently conducted an analysis of the water, chemically and bacteriologically, and pronounced it to be fit for consumption. The total water consumption of Jedda, therefore, may be expected to increase, particularly as the poorer classes are able to draw as much as they require for the mere trouble of carrying it away. 3. From past experience, however, considerable doubt is expressed as to the prospects of Waziriya water becoming a permanent factor in the town s water supply. The doubt is not diminished by reports that, although from Waziriya to Eas Qaim (a place 5 kilom. from Jedda) the conduit has been cemented and is at present fairly sound, over the remaining distance the pipes are old and rotten and require constant care to prevent leakage. Sheikh Muhammad Dehlavi has unsuccessfully approached the Jedda municipality in an endeavour to get the pipe-line thoroughly repaired, and has now placed the matter before Ibn baud, stating his preference for a cement conduit oyer iron piping. 4. In the meantime, the sea-water distillery, or condenser plant, continues to supply the town with drinking water of a kind at the rate of about 8^ gallons per minute, and the English engineer in charge anticipates no great reduction in demand for his product, in spite of its greater cost, on account ot the lack oi confidence in Waziriya water on the part of those who are able to attord the 5. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and to the Department of Overseas Trade. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT.

At the time the ratcf of exchange was fixed the quotation of the dollar according to demand and supply stood at 85 per cent, premium. A fixed exchange had to be within certain limits of the real exchange or there would be a margin for the black exchange. The limits might be 15 per cent, more or less but not as much as 25 per cent. Therefore the rate chosen of 171 approximated within the safe limit to the real exchange. The second part of the Exchange Control Commission's work was to fix limits to the balance of payments; if the balance was unfavourable, then buying must be stopped until there was more or less equilibrium. The Executive Power has taken steps to eliminate any form of black exchange. With regard to the pressure from agriculturists for the devalorisa- tion of the peso, the matter had been discussed from the point of view of sales and purchases in Europe, and it had been decided that the advantages that might be derived from internal depreciation of the peso would not balance the danger that would be incurred. There were two ways of depreciating currency; one was to increase the actual currency, as had been done in the United States; the other was to fix a low exchange vis-a-vis foreign currency. Both had been rejected in high political circles in the Argentine Republic, and it was thought better to keep currency stabilised and to wait until the world situation improved. Indirectly the internal purchasing power of the peso had been raised 20 per cent, by a reduction in the circulation. Externally the peso had lost about 25 per cent, in depreciation. The country was suffering from the process of readjustment but was definitely making progress, except for the enormous increase in taxes during the last five years. The purchasing power of the peso would be maintained in favour of the producers and the working class and the burden of taxes would be reduced as soon as it was possible to gain relief from the heavy burden of internal debt.IBN SA'UD AND THE FUTURE OF ARABIA 1 By Captain C. C. Lewis During the last two years, in which I have had an oppor tunity of making a close study of Ibn Sa'ud's actions, his speeches, and the man himself, I have come to the definite conclusion that he now considers himself to be possessed of a divine mission, and the number of isolated but correlated facts which support this theory is considerable. Prior to 1929 no such conception had occurred to him and the genesis of the belief can be traced to the suppression of the Akhwan rebellion of that year. From 1900, when he, a youth of twenty, was living under the protection of Sheykh Mubarak of Kuwayt, until the present day, Ibn Sa'ud's career has been the successful career of a great man—great by any standards. But when he sallied forth from Kuwayt and with only ten companions succeeded in capturing Riyadh, and finally recovered the whole of Nejd from the Rashidites, the guiding motive of that brilliant campaign was not to spread the light of Wahhabism, but to regain the land of his fathers, and the fact that his conquests led to the founding of the Second Wahhabi Empire was but incidental. It can be argued with force that the subsequent policy of Ibn Sa'ud affords strong corroboration of the contention that his motives were political rather than religious. He was faced with the alternative of linking up the fortunes of the Second Wahhabi Empire with Moslem Turkey or with Christian Great Britain, and he chose the unbelievers. From the conquest of Nejd in 1901 the political situation in Arabia resolved itself into a race for the hegemony of the Arabian Peninsula between Ibn Sa'ud, Ibn Rashid, and the Hashimites. Ibn Sa'ud was continually extending the confines of Nejd, and the manner in which he captured the important province of Hasa—and thereby gained an outlet to the Persian Gulf—and evicted the Turks, bag and baggage, was a splendid victory over a European Power. His part in the Great War really does not enter into the discussion this evening, but I am inclined to agree with Mr. Philby, that but for the death of Captain Shakespear whilst fighting for Ibn Sa'ud against the Rashidites, and the 1 Address given at Chatham House on January 23rd, 1933, Professor H. A. R. Gibb in the Chair.JULY 1933] IBN SA'UD AND THE FUTURE OF ARABIA 519 inevitable change in British policy which that unfortunate event caused, the necessity for the subsequent exploits of Colonel Lawrence in the Hejaz would have been obviated. It is now necessary to endeavour to form an opinion as to Ibn Sa'ud's motive for the invasion and capture of the Hejaz in 1925. It has been said of him that the greatest hatred of his life is his hatred of the Hashimites, lock, stock, and barrel, but with that suggestion I am only partly in agreement. Ex-King Husein is dead; Ali is throneless; with King Feysal, Ibn Sa'ud is now on terms of excellent friendship and has signed a Treaty of Bon Voisinage, as a result of which there has not been a single raid on the 'Iraq frontier for the past year; all Ibn Sa'ud's venom is now concentrated on the Amir 'Abdullah. That is a matter with which I shall deal at greater length later. It was in 1911 that Husein and Ibn Sa'ud first fell foul of each other. Husein, elated by the successes which, as a vassal of the Ottoman Empire, he had gained in Aslr and the Yemen, marched into Nejd with a large force to extract from Ibn Sa'ud an acknowledgment of the suzerainty of Turkey; he captured Ibn Sa'ud's dearly-loved brother, Sa'd, and used him as a lever to extract the required pledges and an annual subsidy of 6000 Mejtdieh from Ibn Sa'ud. Husein's success whetted his appetite. For some reason which has never been made clear, he cast covetous eyes on a place called Khurma on the Hejaz-Nejd border but well inside Nejd. Three times his troops were defeated, a fact which occasioned no surprise in view of the circumstance that the redoubtable Khalid ibn Lu'ayy was Governor of Khurma; he was the best of Ibn Sa'ud's chiefs. (I understand that he died the other day in Asir, where he had been sent to suppress the rebellion which is always breaking out in that province.) In 1919 Husein deter mined to attempt the capture of Khurma in style and, with the full consent of Lord Curzon, who warned Ibn Sa'ud off, Husein despatched an army of 4000 men, with the appropriate artillery and machine guns, under the command of the Amir 'Abdullah who afterwards became ruler of Transjordan. This force, not having considered it necessary to post sentries at night, was literally cut to pieces at Turabah. I think that only about ninety-six people escaped from that massacre. In 1921 Ibn Sa'ud added Hall to his dominions, an addition of considerable importance because it drove a Wahhabi wedge between King Husein, the father, in the Hejaz and King Feysal, the son, in 'Iraq, and put an end to the Rashldite regime in Hall, which had lasted for close on a hundred years.520 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS [JULY Students of Arabian history have always been somewhat mystified by the fact that Ibn Sa'ud did not follow up the victory of Turabah by an invasion of the Hejaz in 1919; the road to Ta if and Mecca was open to him, but he declined the oppor tunity. When he did actually invade the Hejaz in 1925, his perhaps not unwilling hands were forced and he had no option in the matter. The storm of hatred that broke out among the Wahhabis on the assumption of the Caliphate by Husein could have been controlled by no human force and the Hashimites disappeared from the Holy Places of Islam, regretted by none, save the Sharifs. This somewhat prosaic narrative of history throws into bold relief the fact that, up to 1926 at any rate, there is no evidence that Ibn Sa'ud attributed his successes to the divine will of Allah. In 1929 came the Akhwan rebellion. (I should perhaps say that the Akhwan are Wahhabi Bedouins who have definitely settled on the soil and have entirely given up their nomadic habits.) In 1929 they were completely out of hand. Their leaders sent an ultimatum to Ibn Sa'ud stating that, inasmuch as the building of a fort by 'Iraq on the Nejd frontier was con trary to the terms of the Treaty of Muhammarah and the 'Uqayr Protocol, they proposed to invade 'Iraq whether their King agreed to this or not. Ibn Sa'ud was on the horns of a dilemma. If he sanctioned the invasion he committed himself to a conflict with Great Britain, in view of the mandate which we had accepted for 'Iraq; if he did not sanction the invasion, he had no other course open to him but to chastise his recalcitrant subjects. He chose the latter and wiser course, but it was a very near thing. The Akhwan defeated Ibn Sa'ud's troops in at least two battles, but eventually their forces were scattered or killed. The Akhwan rebellion presents Ibn Sa'ud in the light of a ruler indelibly stamped with the hallmark of genius. He was, like Bismarck, thinking not of the time but of the future. He knew it would be impossible for him to have a really serious disagreement with Great Britain, especially at that time. From the suppression of the Akhwan rebellion in 1929 Ibn Sa'ud began to dream dreams of a united Kingdom of Arabia with himself as King and Caliph and all his subjects professing the Wahhabi creed. But what perhaps is more important is that, in reviewing his own career and the countless occasions when he had succeeded in causes apparently lost, he could not come to any other conclusion but that Allah was guiding his footsteps. Even a more sophisticated monarch could not1933] IBN SA'tJD AND THE FUTURE OF ARABIA 521 attribute the numberless occasions on which he has succeeded with incalculable odds against him, merely to blind chance, and Ibn Sa'ud is fundamentally a simple-minded man. These mental processes of the King did not take place in a day, but it has been obvious since 1930 that his mind has turned more to religion. That he is turning more to religious and spiritual matters is clear from the way in which he is emphasising the puritanical restrictions of the Wahhabis. For example, on January 8th, 1931, there was an Accession Day Celebration to celebrate his coming to the throne, and after it the Ulema of Nejd protested against the worldliness of the affair; Ibn Sa'ud publicly confessed that they were right and he was wrong, and neither last year nor this year has there been such a celebration. Again, smoking is entirely forbidden amongst the King's entourage and at any function which he attends. There have been numerous police raids in Mecca, Medina and Jedda, with the object of seizing liquor, and punishments ferocious to European eyes have been meted out to offenders. Not long ago a wretched Hadhrami stole a piece of the black stone from the Ka'ba in Mecca, because he thought that it would be lucky, but he discovered that any luck coming his way would have to be in Paradise, as his head was chopped off. A Hejazi who murdered his father and mother and then appealed to the King for clemency on the ground that he was an orphan, was executed at the same time. In his speeches Ibn Sa'ud has been particularly severe on backsliders. At the last Pilgrimage banquet oration he said, ' I fear Christians once but I fear so-called Moslems three thousand times.' This gave great offence to Mohammedans elsewhere, notably to the representatives of Persia and Afghanistan. Ibn Sa'ud has been definitely very much more strict on the observation of all the Wahhabi tenets recently. One more small example is that no music of any description is allowed in the Hejaz. Many Hejazi had brought in gramophones, so there was a police raid in which every single gramophone needle was seized; there is now not one to be had in the whole of the Hejaz except in the foreign missions. I will now tell you a little of the inner history of the Ibn Rifada affair. There was no paper in England, and I did not see even a vernacular paper outside Arabia, which got anywhere near the truth about the plot. It was exceedingly interesting and showed again that Ibn Sa'ud is definitely a very great man for getting himself out of difficulties. On June 14th last year a complaint was received from Ibn Sa'ud that certain rebel5 22 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS [JULY subjects of his had crossed the Transjordan frontier and had come into the Hejaz with the object of making trouble for him. On June 20th a telegram arrived from the High Commissioner for Transjordan saying that about 400 or 450 of the Billi tribes men (a tribe in the north-west of the Hejaz) had crossed to the Transjordan frontier on the narrow neck of land which runs between the north of the Gulf of 'Aqabah and the Sinai Peninsula; they had come along on Egyptian territory, not through Trans jordan, but it was admitted that there were between 400 and 450 of them in Hejaz territory. Ibn Sa'ud was faced with difficulties m several respects. In the first place, he had been having trouble in Asir; he had also been having trouble with the Imam Yahya; then the tribes about Ta'if were restive; and on top of that this number of men were coming down into the north of the Hejaz, where the financial position was very bad owing to lack of ram. Ibn Sa ud's spy service was exceptionally good and it was a strange matter, in view of what I shall mention later, that these 450 men had swoUen in three weeks to 1250 men, who could only have come from Transjordan, because the Admiralty had sent H.M.S. Penzance and H.M.S. Hastings to the north of the Gulf of 'Aqabah in order to help Ibn Sa'ud. It id not suit our book at all that there should be a successful rebellion in which it was suggested the rebels had come over soil of which Great Britain had accepted the mandate. The rebel force was quite an unknown quantity, inasmuch as Ibn ^a ud did not know to what numbers it would eventually grow. He did nothing hurriedly. He collected the Akhwan from the nearest settlements; he collected ten thousand at Ta'if and six t ousand at a place called A1 Ula on the old Hejaz railway from Damascus to Medina, which Colonel Lawrence blew up. For a distance of some ten to fifteen miles inland along the east side o t e Gulf of Aqabah there are some high hills which are quite impracticable for men in any numbers. The rebels had got in t e hills half-way between Muwaila and 'Aqabah itself. Ibn au despatched the six thousand Akhwan gathered at A1 Ula to haba, a place a little north of Muwaila, and they swept up rom there to the Transjordan frontier and exterminated Ibn Kifada and all his followers. Only a few escaped into Trans jordan. As a lesson to any others, the head of Ibn Rifada was cut off and used as a football by the boys of Dhaba. It is difficult to interpret the psychology of the double number o t e Mecca newspaper, the Umm-al-Qurd, which was published m onour of the defeat of Ibn Rifada. The Umm-al-Qurd is theIBN SA'UD AND THE FUTURE OF ARABIA 523 official organ of the Hejazi Government and is edited by Sheykh Yusuf Yasin, the head of the political section of the King's Diwan. Many people believe that the whole of the important matter in this issue was submitted to and approved by Ibn Sa'ud before it was published. For many reasons it is really of vital importance, not only as affording a clue to the King's mind but also as showing which way the Arabian wind is blow ing. Ibn Sa'ud was attacked in this Umm-al-Qurd by his own son, the Amir Sa'ud, Viceroy of Nejd, and by the Ulema of Nejd, for exercising a restraining influence on the Akhwan : ' Are you becoming less of a Moslem that you restrain true believers from attacking the hypocrite and prate to us of policy and administration? ' It is interesting to note the precise implication of the Arabic word used for ' hypocrite ' ; it is the word used by the Prophet himself to describe those who, whilst outwardly professing the true faith, were at heart idolaters. The word here undoubtedly refers to the Amir 'Abd'ullah. The Akhwan themselves waxed bitter in print. ' Have you, oh Imam, summoned us from our tents in our thousands to exterminate a rat from a hole like Ibn Rifada, or is it your intention that after we have slain the rat we shall proceed against the real enemy? ' Another important thing about this number of the Umm-al-Qurd was that for the first time in any official, semi-official, or demi- semi-official document published by, or under the auspices of, the Sa'udian Government, the word ' Jihad ' was used. The essence of the use of the word in this case was that the Jihad was to be of a Wahhabi Power against a Moslem, albeit a non- Wahhabi country. The word was used repeatedly throughout the whole number. It was an immensely clever piece of diplo macy for Ibn Sa'ud to have this published, in spite of the fact that he was attacked, knowing the effect it might have on the Foreign Office and on the Amir 'Abdu'llah. The Amir 'Abdu'llah is the second extraordinarily important factor in Arabian politics. He has never forgotten, nor will he ever forgive Ibn Sa'ud for the ejection of the Hashimites from the Hejaz in 1925. There can be no doubt, to an impartial observer, that 'Abdu'llah was deeply implicated in the Ibn Rifada rebellion. Ibn Rifada was an exile from the Hejaz, belonging to Wejd, who had been exiled for rebellion against Ibn Sa'ud five years previously. It is a fact that Ibn Rifada and three of his leaders dined with the Amir of 'Aqabah before they entered into the Hejaz. The Sa'udian Arabian Navy (a524 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS little dhow with one gun on it) captured another dhow at 'Aqabah in which they found a box containing a secret cipher and incrimi natory letters from high officials of the Amir 'Abdullah. In one of the letters there was written, 'You must press on and take either Muwaila or Dhaba or we cannot send you any more money or rifles.' Shortly afterwards, under strong pressure, the Amir 'Abdullah published a proclamation to say that he strongly disapproved of the affair, but one knows that these proclamations are not infrequently used in diplomatic circles to get out of an unfortunate faux pas. Soon after he blotted his copybook again by giving an interview to an Indian notable, a report of which was published in the vernacular press of Egypt and Palestine, in which he said that he would never rest until Ibn Sa'ud was turned out of the Hejaz. Possibly some of you may have seen the article in The Times of July 14th, 1932. This gave great offence to Ibn Sa'ud. None of the facts nor the implications in it were correct. From all the evidence in his possession it is not surprising that Ibn Sa'ud does not feel favourably disposed towards the Amir 'Abdullah. It is difficult to see how it is possible for there to be peace and freedom from raiding one way and the other on the frontier, so long as the Amir 'Abdu'llah remains ruler of Transjordan. In view of the fact that Great Britain has accepted the mandate for Transjordan and is responsible for the foreign policy of that country, it is not to be wondered at that Ibn Sa'ud looks with a certain amount of suspicion on Great Britain. He may well view with amazement the appli cation of the doctrine of laissez faire by Great Britain to the anti-Sa'udian antics of her protege. The Akhwan are the third important factor in Arabian politics. Mr. Philby numbers them at about 50,000 fighting men, but Ameen Rihani puts the number at about 73,000. For years throughout all the Arabic-speaking countries the Akhwan have been a bogey with which to frighten not only the children but also the grown-ups, but I think myself they are little better than a myth. They are of poor physique. They are certainly fanatical and brutal fighters, fanatical, perhaps, in view of the comforting Wahhabi tenet that if you are killed in battle you will enjoy a large number of houris in Paradise, whilst if you survive you will share in the loot; brutal, as is shown by the fact that they put to death every man, woman and child from Muwaila to the Transjordan frontier while they were ' chas tising ' Ibn Rifada. For months afterwards there was not a» ^ 1933] IBN SA'tJD AND THE FUTURE OF ARABIA 525 living thing for the whole hundred and twenty miles. Never theless a sound military appreciation of the Akhwan must lead one to the conclusion that untrained fighters, however brave they may be, have no possible chance against any trained troops. I should very much doubt whether the Akhwan were better troops than the Shabana of 'Iraq; I would have backed any of my own companies of Shabana against double the number of Akhwan. Whether they are a terrible menace or not, the fact remains that Ibn Sa'ud has them under very firm control and can now ride them on a single snaffle. There is no tangible evidence to justify the belief that they would ever invade any country outside their own without express orders from Ibn Sa ud, and he would never be likely to give the order. The two attacks they made recently onTransjordan were tragedies for the Akhwan. In this connection I should like to draw attention to a mis take which I have come across in a book entitled The Middle East, by Major Poison Newman. Perhaps it is my legal train ing, but I do not like to see something in a book which is not only inaccurate but is capable of being proved inaccurate. Hav ing read the book I discovered that the authority for the state ment was the Amir 'Abdu'llah, who is naturally partisan. Major Poison Newman says, ' Undoubtedly the object of the raid was to increase the Wahhabi territory and revenue. There is not one scrap of evidence to show that Ibn Sa'ud ever approved of or had anything to do with either of the Akhwan raids. The Akhwan will never forget the words addressed to them after the last raid, from which out of one thousand, five men returned. ' Think not, ya Akhwan, that we consider you of much value. Think not that you have rendered us great service and that we need you. Your real value, ya Akhwan, is in obedience to Allah and then to us. When you go beyond that, you will be punished. And do not forget that there is not one among you whose father or brother or cousin we have not slain. Aye, Wallah, and it was by the sword that we conquered you. And that same sword is still above your heads. Beware, ya Akhwan. Encroach not upon the rights of others. If you do, your value and that of the dust are the same. We took you by the sword and we shall keep you within your bounds by the sword, insha/Uah.' 1 The latest step Ibn Sa'ud has taken has been to change the name of his dominions from the ' Kingdom of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies ' to the ' Kingdom of Sa'udian Arabia.' This is the master-stroke of Ibn Sa'ud's career. I 1 Taken from Ibn Sa'ud, by Ameen Rihani.526 international affairs [july count myself among those people who consider that this idea emanated from the King himself, because no one possessing even a superficial knowledge of the Bedouin could suppose that it was a change brought about voce populi. I have brought with me several of the petitions which were published in the Umm-al- Qurd. It was stated in the editorial that Ibn Sa'ud consented to the change, about which he knew nothing before. I will read one of the petitions in order that you may appreciate the language it is couched in, the high-flown language of the Arabs which is really rather beautiful. ' In the Name of God, the most Merciful, the Compassionate. There is no Might nor Power save in God, the High, the Great. Praise be to the One God. On this day, the 12th Jumada al Ula, 1351 a.h. [13th September, 1932], the undersigned have gathered to discuss and consult upon a question concerning dignity, honour, grace, union and harmony, and to take a decision in this respect and to submit it to His Majesty King 'Abdu'l-'Aziz ibn 'Abdi'r-Rahmani al Feysal al Sa'ud, may God grant him success and prolong his reign. God the most Almighty has distinguished this country from its sisters, the other Arab countries. It is thus the most honourable, the highest ranked, the most strongly peopled, the most populous, the most independent, the best capable of facing calamity and evil-doing and the readiest to pursue beneficial and profitable ends. God has granted its people distinctions of which others have been deprived. Thus they are one Arab race in origin, in customs, traditions, religion, obedience [Islam] and history. The whole country can thus become united and be one completely united race. Its people can be one nation, without difference between those who come from the Tihama, Nejd or the Hejaz, from the East or the West. This being the state of the country and its people and this being its distinguished position amongst all other countries inhabited by Arabs; and as its present governmental systems do not tally with the nature of the unity possessed by it and its people; and as its present name, ' The Kingdom of the Hejaz-Nejd and its Depen dencies/ does not express the racial, governmental and national unity which should appear in it, but only exhibits certain names of geo graphical regions of the Arab lands which fail to represent the actual fact referred to above, and does not reflect the wish which the people of this nation have in their hearts, namely, the union of and agree ment between all Arabs of different countries and from remote homes; and as the above-mentioned systems of government do not show the general connections which exist between the inhabitants, neither do they indicate the joint obligations which exist between them, for the dignity and honour of the country (as was demonstrated by the cooperation shown during the recent Ibn Rifada happenings), while1933] IBN SA'UD AND THE FUTURE OF ARABIA 527 they should show real union between the two important parts of the Kingdom under the shade of His Majesty the King—the present people most humbly submit to His Majesty their earnest desire and request that he may be pleased to issue his imperial decree sanctioning the change of the present name of the Kingdom to one more appro priate to actual conditions, more indicative of future aims, and one more clearly commemorative of the one who was the cause of this unification and agreement, namely, the person of His Majesty the redeemed King; changing the name of the ' Kingdom of the Hejaz- Nejd and its Dependencies' to that of the ' Kingdom of Sa'udian Arabia,' which designates the countries inhabited by those Arabs whom God has helped His Majesty the King 'Abdul-'Aziz al Sa'ud to bring to union. And as stability, permanence and steadfastness are amongst the principal conditions to which nations aspire in their political and social life, without which they cannot hope to face con tingencies and mishaps, and without which no country or nation can stand firm, as is seen in the history and fall of nations, governments and countries which have neglected such grave matters, petitioners humbly beg His Majesty the King, may God prolong his life, to grant another request, to the effect that His Majesty may be pleased to issue his gracious order approving the drawing up of a constitution [literally ' regulation of government'] and the succession to the throne so that everyone, friend or foe, near or far, may know that this sovereignty is firmly established and cannot be disturbed by storms or events. His Majesty, may God prolong his life, is the best qualified person to appreciate the important matter, its far-reaching benefits within and without the country, and the consolidation of its moral and material state. We pray that God Almighty may help His Majesty the redeemed King, for the welfare and prosperity of the country.' There are sixteen signatures to this petition, of which the first is that of Sir Fu'ad Hamza, who was knighted when the Amir Feysal came on his mission to London to raise money. It is not an extravagant thought to add the word ' creed ' to the statement, ' one Arab race in origin, in customs, traditions, religion '; it is possible that at the back of Ibn Sa'ud's mind is the pious hope that at some future date all his subjects will be one in Wahhabism. I suggest that this petition does not bear the semblance of having come from the wild Bedouin of the heart of Arabia. I should like to read you the Royal Decree published on September 18th, 1932, in answer to these petitions and in answer to the unanimous wish of Ibn Sa'ud's subjects. ' After placing our reliance on God, and as a result of the tele grams sent to us by all our subjects in the Kingdom of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies, in accordance with the public528 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS [JULY desire in our country, and wishing to unite the parts of this Arab Kingdom, We decree the following :— 1. The name of the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd and its Depen dencies shall be changed to that of the ' Kingdom of Sa'udian Arabia' [Mamlakat 'Arabiyat as-Sa'udiya], and our title shall in future be ' King of the Kingdom of Sa'udian Arabia.' 2. The change shall take effect as from the date of its announce ment [September 22nd]. 3. This change shall not affect the treaties and international obligations and agreements, which will remain effective and binding. Neither shall it affect the contracts and agreements made with individuals, which will continue to be effective. 4. All previous regulations, instructions and orders given by us shall remain in force after this change. 5. The organisation of our present Government, whether in the Hejaz or in Nejd and its Dependencies, will provisionally continue in its present form until a new organisation is laid down for the whole Kingdom on the basis of the new unification. 6. Our present Council of Ministers shall start immediately to lay down a basic constitution for the Kingdom, a rule for succes sion to the throne, and a regulation for the organisation of the Government, and shall submit them to us for our orders. 7. The President of our Council of Ministers has the right to add to the members of the Council of Ministers any person or persons of intelligence, while the above-mentioned regulations are being prepared, in order to benefit from their opinions and to obtain enlightenment from their knowledge. 8. We choose Thursday the 21st of Jumada I, 1351, the first day of the equinox, as the day on which shall be announced the unification of this Arab Kingdom.' There are two comments to be made on this Decree. You will have noticed, discreetly tucked away, is a statement about a rule for the succession to the throne. That is an adroit move. There are three possible candidates, the King's eldest son, the Amir Sa'ud, Viceroy of Nejd, the King's second son, the Amir Feysal, Viceroy of the Hejaz and Minister of the Foreign Office, and the King's brother, the Amir Muhammad ibn Abdu'r-Rahman, who really should have succeeded to the throne in place of Ibn Sa'ud. Ibn Sa'ud has thrown this matter of the succession on the Council of Ministers. The British have always been very fond of constitutions—we come, we see, and we constitute—- but I would suggest that one of the finest constitutions at present existing in the world is that in Sa'udian Arabia, which has an Assembly of sixteen people, eight of them appointed by theI933] IBN SA'tJD AND THE FUTURE OF ARABIA 529 King and eight of them elected—I should perhaps add that they are elected by the King. That, in my opinion, is an ideal form of constitution; you get sixteen members appointed by the King. I should like to summarise shortly my own views on the future of Arabia under Ibn Sa'ud. Ibn Sa'ud is a genius. It is by no manner of means an exaggeration to say that he is the greatest Arab since the Prophet. He is very fond of saying, ' The English are my friends; but I will walk with them only so far as my religion and honour will allow.' But he is genius enough to know when to continue the walk even though it is necessary to allow a certain amount of elasticity, both to his religion and to his honour. In several matters repeatedly, perhaps almost once every six months, he has come up against Great Britain, and he has an uncommon instinct for choosing the occasions when he can stand his ground and beat us, because for some reason, perhaps not connected with Arabia, perhaps a Labour Govern ment, we cannot do anything at the time. He always chooses such occasions and always wins, increasing his prestige every time. Otherwise he lodges a strong protest and gives way. At the beginning of last year, for instance, there was trouble about a slave who took refuge in the British Legation at Jedda. Great Britain is the only country that has the right to manumit and repatriate slaves who get into the Legation by the Treaty of Jedda which Sir Gilbert Clayton signed, but royal slaves are exempt from the purview of the Treaty and therefore have to be handed back. This slave was claimed by Sir Fu'ad Hamza as being a royal slave. His Majesty's Minister took an elaborate statement from him by which it appeared that he had come from Nigeria in childhood with his parents on pilgrimage. It took two years to get across Africa, and after many vicissitudes he had got to the Hejaz, where he was stolen and sold as a slave. He had then been stolen again and sold once more. He even tually fetched up in Medina in 1924, and when Ibn Sa'ud con quered Medina in 1925 his capturer had presented him to the King. But in fact the slave had never been in the King's house. He had been in the house of Sheykh Yusuf Yasin, who purchased slaves for the King. So Sir Andrew Ryan said that he was not a royal soldier or servant in the meaning of the Treaty of Jedda. Sir Fu'ad refused to give way and sent ten Nejd soldiers and officers down to the quarantine jetty with orders to shoot the slave on sight. They would not go to the extent of shooting a slave if he was on British soil. The Legation, the Legation car and the launch were British soil. Meanwhile the Foreign Office530 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS [JULY arranged to send H.M.S. Pcuzunce to Jedda. Finally, a game of cricket was arranged between the Europeans of Jedda and the sloop, and the soldiers thought no one would play cricket if the serious business of getting the slave through was to be done, so the men in charge simply took the slave down and walked him through and he was taken off to the sloop. At the time there was very serious trouble. The King sent a strong protest to the Foreign Office and even threatened to withdraw the Hejazi Minister in London unless the slave was given back. He was told to withdraw the protest or there would be trouble, and knowing that the Amir Feysal later in the year was going to London in the hope of raising a loan, he withdrew his com plaint so as not to spoil his chances of getting the money, and the whole affair ended amicably. I told you about Khurmah and how, although he had been warned off by Lord Curzon who sent an emissary to say he was not to defend it, he not only defended it but killed 3900 out of the 4000 men sent against him. He always manages to pick the right time to take a firm line. Even now he has one or two little aces—or bombshells—up his sleeve, such as the Hejaz Railway and the Arabian air route. The only route for Imperial Airways to India, in the event of not being able to fly over Persian territory, is via al Hasa and the Persian Gulf. Then he has always had a claim to 'Aqabah, and the strange thing is that the agreement by which he agreed to accept the de facto boundary between Transjordan and the Hejaz, leaving himself the right to raise the legal question at a later date, was based on the 1918 military survey map, in which the boundaries between Trans- Jordan and the Hejaz and between Nejd and 'Iraq were fixed with regard to meridians, and it has since been discovered that the map on which the survey was founded is thirty miles wrong. Many of these things are purely matters of opinion and I certainly do not wish to appear dogmatic. But it is my firm belief that Ibn Sa ud wishes to become the paramount chief of all Arabic-speaking countries. That is his great ambition, and that all his subjects should profess the Wahhabi creed. That is why I draw attention to the word for ' unity ' in the petition. He believes himself to be possessed of a divine mission to have all his subjects converted to Wahhabism, which is far and away the sternest sect of Islam. But I do not believe he will ever risk or bring about any war in which Great Britain could possibly be implicated in furtherance of that ambition. If he achieves his ambition it will be by peaceful means, not by means of war.1933] IBN SA'UD AND THE FUTURE OF ARABIA 531 The only war which one can visualise as being within the realm of practical politics would be against the Imam of the Yemen. When he was having trouble in Asir, the Imam thought it an admirable opportunity to raise the frontier question and sent some of his warlike Yemeni over the border, as a result of which Ibn Sa'ud ceded to him a mountain north of Sana. It is difficult to believe that he would have ceded this but for the trouble he was involved in elsewhere in his dominions. There would be no dangerous repercussions from a war with the Imam. The Italians have to a certain extent lost interest in the Yemen. They have a treaty with the Imam, and because of the tension between the Imam and Ibn Sa'ud they refused to enter into any treaty with the latter until last April, when they not only entered into a treaty of commerce, paying attention to fishing and other rights in the Red Sea, but also sent a Minister to Jedda, whereas before there had only been a Consul. If there was war between Ibn Sa'ud and the Imam I doubt if the Italians would take any part. It is difficult to see how it could affect Great Britain so that we should feel called upon to interfere. We should no doubt, in diplomatic language, advise counsels of moderation, but that would be about the limit of our interest. But when Ibn Sa'ud dies the whole political position in Arabia will be changed. There is not one of his possible suc cessors who could contain the dissentient tribal elements for a week. The Amir Sa'ud is a fanatic and an anti-European. The Amir Feysal is quite useless; he is titular Minister of Foreign Affairs but he does no work in connection with it at all. The Amir Abdu'r-Rahman, the King's elder brother, is not really powerful. No one has the personality of Ibn Sa'ud, and there fore there will certainly be very grave trouble when he dies. So I think one can with all sincerity repeat the Bedouin greeting to their King, ' May Allah bless the Imam 'Abdul-Aziz and grant him a long life.' Summary of Discussion. Q uestion : What tribes was the Amir 'Abdullah supposed to have lent to Ibn Rifada ? C aptain L ewis replied that the Amir could not be said to have done anything so definite. There were Hejazi tribesmen living in the north who periodically migrated into Transjordan for grazing. They were subjects of Ibn Sa'ud and had been giving him trouble, so to get out of his power they stayed in Transjordan. When Ibn Sa'ud asked the Transjordan Government to hand them back this was refused, but the Government said they would be put in a place away532 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS [july from the border. One of the first things that happened when Rifada's rebellion broke out was that two hundred of these tribesmen came down and stole the camels of the Akhwan who were chastising Rifada. The support given to Rifada could not be described as a tribal move ment. Captain Glubb, the officer on the frontier, was told by the tribesmen that the British Government had not only consented to Ibn Rifada's rebellion but were financing it; they had been told this by 'Abdu'llah's emissaries. S ir J ohn C hancellor said that he had known King Husein and the other Hashimites, and that the Amir 'Abdullah had been a friend of his when he was High Commissioner of Palestine and Transjordan. He would not be surprised to learn that 'Abdullah had encouraged the Transjordan tribesmen to invade Hejaz territory, because the expulsion of Ibn Sa'ud from the Hejaz was the dominating motive of 'Abdullah's policy, and he had found it impossible to induce Amir 'Abdullah to give an undertaking that he would formally recognise Ibn Sa'ud as King of the Hejaz. Ibn Sa'ud was certainly a powerful ruler and he was generally frank and straightforward in his dealings; but he was a disagreeable neighbour to Transjordan. In spite of an agreement which he had made to that effect, he refused to allow his officers in the frontier area to have direct communication with the officers of the Transjordan Government, and, as large numbers of Transjordan tribes crossed the border into Hejaz territory for grazing every summer, this restriction led to many difficulties and misunder standings that might otherwise be avoided. Ibn Sa'ud no doubt controlled the tribes in the Hejaz and Nejd. But his rule was purely personal. His life might come to an end at any time, and he believed that none of his sons was fit to take his place as ruler of the Hejaz and Nejd. It was difficult to see what would happen on his death. As regards the three oldest Hashimite brothers, he believed that the Amir 'Abdullah's ambition was to become King of the Hejaz; King Feysal would probably like to become King of Syria and 'Iraq and perhaps also of Transjordan; Ali had bad health and was less ambitious than his brothers. A few years earlier rumours had been prevalent that Ali might be selected as King of Syria by the French; but the French had apparently abandoned the idea of making a King in Syria. The chances of the Hashimites, who were not popular in Mecca, succeeding in their plans seemed remote, even if Ibn Sa'ud's sons proved to be as ineffective as was generally believed. He did not see how the Hejaz Railway could be described as an ace in the hands of Ibn Sa'ud, as suggested by Captain Lewis. Ibn Sa'ud had refused to consent to the reopening of the railway from Ma'an to Medina unless the whole of the Hejaz Railway was handed over to him. That was a preposterous demand to which neither the British nor French Governments could assent. He understood that both France and Great Britain had agreed that all profits on theV 4^ 1933] IBN SA'UD AND THE FUTURE OF ARABIA 533 Hejaz Railway should be credited to Waqf funds. There was, for the time being, however, little prospect of profits accruing. The Hejaz Railway was at present about £100,000 in debt to the Government of Palestine in respect of the working of the sections of the Hejaz Railway running through Palestine and Transjordan. C aptain L ewis suggested that many difficulties arose from the fact that Egypt and the Hejaz were under the Foreign Office, while Palestine and Transjordan were under the Colonial Office, and the Persian Gulf was under the India Office. He recognised that his own admiration for Ibn Sa'ud was not shared by everyone. The return of any member of the Hashimites to the Holy Places of Islam would be universally execrated, in view of the treatment accorded to pilgrims b}/ Husein and Ali. The Hejaz Railway had been built, not by Turkey but from the Waqf funds given by benevolent Moslems in every country in the world, including India. The profits, if any, were therefore at the disposal of Ibn Sa'ud for the poor of Mecca and Medina. The British Government realised this and had given definite orders that certain claims to Waqf funds arising from Transjordan and Burman donors who were dead should be accounted to Ibn Sa'ud. Ibn Sa'ud was in a position to say that he would not open that part of the railway unless the funds from it were to be handed over to him for distribution in accordance with the wishes of the donors. Incidentally, Junkers had offered to rebuild the railway right to Mecca and to build a road alongside it, on the understanding that at the end of four years' working the whole thing should be handed over to Ibn Sa'ud's Government. He thought it was an ace up Ibn Sa'ud's sleeve to know that the British Government had actually embarked on a solemn agreement with another country based on an error in British survey work. That fact would certainly militate against the British case if a claim were brought before the Hague Court. The High Commissioner had recently instructed the officials at Jedda to lodge a protest with Ibn Sa'ud for infringement of the frontier at Hadithah and Hazim Wells; shortly afterwards Ibn Sa'ud had made an equally strong complaint that Captain Glubb had gone through his territory with five cars. The surveyor had then reported that Hadithah was on Ibn Sa'ud's territory, although the British authorities had always considered it to be in Transjordan. The boundary was not a straight line but went north round the Wadi Sirhan. Q uestion : Why was the proclamation of Sa'udian Arabia such a master-stroke? If none of Ibn Sa'ud's successors could carry his cloak, would not the subsequent confusion be worse following an artificial connection ? C aptain L ewis said that Ibn Sa'ud had gained recognition of his annexation of Asir by including all his dominions under the one name No. 4.—VOL. XII. u534 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS [JULY 1933 of Sa'udian Arabia, which had been accepted without reservations by Great Britain and Italy. The latter had now appointed a Minister to Jedda. The Hashimites, who were enraged at the linking of the name Sa'ud with the whole of Arabia, had no legal complaint. The new name had a meaning for the outside world which the old name had lacked; people who had never heard of the Hejaz knew of Arabia, Q uestion : How did British salesmanship compare with that of other nations ? C aptain L ewis replied that in his experience the leaders of British industry deserved no sympathy because they would not take the trouble to study the psychology of prospective customers. Of the 3000 motor-cars in Arabia only eleven were British. All the soap sold was French or German, because what the Arab wanted was not a creamy complexion but something that was cheap and would make a good lather. There were no manufactures in Arabia, where the people existed chiefly on fleecing pilgrims, so there was plenty of opening for importers, but the British firms did not think it worth while. T he C hairman said he was depressed about conditions in Arabia and about the attitude of Ibn Sa'ud, who was not a natural ally of Great Britain. There had been cause for dissatisfaction. In the Ibn Rifada affair a country under British protection had undoubtedly been concerned and no British dementi had been issued of the reports which reached other Arab countries that the British Government was behind the rebellion. It was only fair to say that Ibn Sa'ud himself had given a dementi in the communique in which he thanked the British Government for the services rendered by the Navy in the Gulf of 'Aqabah which had prevented supplies from reaching Ibn Rifada. He feared, however, that Ibn Sa'ud was hardening towards the foreign Arab States, particularly those under British protection. He was therefore relieved to hear Captain Lewis say that Ibn Sa'ud was determined to avoid any serious complication with Great Britain. The question as to what would happen on Ibn Sa'ud's death was exceedingly grave. The Hejazi population was very hostile, not to Ibn Sa'ud but to Nejd domination, and there was every possibility that there would be a strong movement for breaking apart. That brought in the question of 'Abdullah and King Feysal and it was difficult to see how a serious situation could be avoided. With regard to Yemen, opposition was based on religious sectarian grounds as well as on the temperaments of the two rulers. It was fortunate that the soldiers of the Yemen were only accustomed to mountainous country and those of Ibn Sa'ud to the plains, as this would restrict the operations of either on the other's territory. He would have liked to hear more about the trouble in Asir, which seemed to be a focus of opposition. There were undoubtedly other fingers in that pie.I vy,\ THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (A rabia).

Jedda, August 29, 1933. IJS continuation of my despatch No. 273 of to-day's date and with reference to my telegram Tso. 161 of the 24th August, relative to the possibility of the outbreak of hostilities between King Ibn Saud and the Imam of the Yemen, I have the honour to report that Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, who has been in Jedda since my meeting with him on the 24th August, vesterday requested a further interview with me. I accordingly called on him in the afternoon at the Khuzan Palace. 2. He produced a sheaf of telegrams which, he explained, he had just received from the Amir Feisal with instructions to read them over to me. I was not offered copies of these telegrams, as on previous occasions, but perused them, with the Minister of Finance, sentence by sentence. As the telegrams were six in number and, of these, four were long and not a little involved, it may be that the following summary may not be in every respect complete, but I believe, in the main, the contents of the telegrams, particularly in regard to the more important points, have been adequately retained. 3. The telegrams were prefaced by a short note, also in the form of a telegram. It was carefully read by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman and stated that, from information received in Eiyadh, it appeared that Imam Yahya was mobilising his forces in the Yemen and that therefore Ibn Saud had ordered the Saudi forces on the north-east of Nejd to proceed to the south-west, i.e., to Asir, as a reinforcement to the troops already there. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman here explained that the military forces of Saudi Arabia are divided into three zones, or commands, the north-western (which had dealt with the Ibn Eifada rebellion), the north-eastern and the south-western. He described this measure as a purely precautionary one, and, in reply to a question, informed me that the orders had been issued three weeks ago. He added that he had heard, but not officially, that, should the situation deteriorate and the use of force become inevitable. Amir Saud, the King's eldest son, would probably be appointed to command the troops operating in Asir. He was unaware whether the troops of the North-Eastern ' Command ' had yet arrived in Asir, but thought not. 4. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman did not enlighten me as to the address to which this telegram, if telegram it was, had been sent, but I inferred that it had been sent by the King to Amir Feisal at Taif. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman then proceeded to read five telegrams, all of which, he informed me, had been sent by Ibn Saud to Imam Yahya. It would appear, although the Minister of Finance himself was not clear on the point, that the Imam's letter to Ibn Saud, entrusted to the delegation who wirelessed the contents to Riyadh (as reported in my telegram No. 158 of the 19th August), and to which Ibn Saud replied at length, had, indeed, elicited a reply from the Imam in which he stated that he was quite unable to grasp the meaning of Ibn Baud's telegram or understand the demands he was putting forward. To this, Ibn Saud rejoined, in the first of the five telegrams read by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, that, although he considered his position perfectly understandable, yet for the sake of clarity he would put each of his mam points in a separate telegram. In this rather lengthy introductory telegram he recalled the measure of agreement reached previously and embodied in the treaty between them, and called attention to the signal gesture of conciliation, affording proof of his desire for a permanent settlement, in his action over the Arwa mountains dispute. 5. Of the four telegrams embodying his desiderata, the first dealt with the Tihamat Asir, a question which Ibn Saud regarded as concerning himself and the Imam only and one which had been definitely settled by their treaty. The [907 p—1]2 intention here would appear to be to exclude the Idrisi from any consideration in respect of a territory which had previously been an essentially Idrisi sphere. 6. The remaining three telegrams were somewhat more complicated. Ibn Saud set forth at length his claims in respect of the Beni Yam, with whom many of the tribes of Nejd were intimately related—which could not be said of the Yemen's relations with that congeries of tribes. A division of the various sections in accordance with their individual affiliations was proposed. The treaty was repeatedly invoked with reference to the Najran, Ibn Saud maintaining that the agreement concluded between the Imam and the Saudi delegates, Ibn Duleym and Turki-al-Mahdi, provided for a division of that territory, from Weileh to the south to go to the Yemen and from Weileh to the north to Saudi Arabia. This was the agreement to which the Imam Yahya had set his hand, yet which had so far only been honoured in the breach. 7. The protection and assistance offered by the Imam to the Idrisi drew bitter words from the King. Ibn Saud had allowed the Idrisi to remain with Imam Yahya, upon the conclusion of the treaty, for two reasons : Firstly, because of his (Ibn Saud's) affection for his brother the Imam, and, secondly, because the Imam had given a guarantee for the good conduct of the Idrisi whilst within his territories. This guarantee, also, had not been observed, for the Imam must be only too well aware of the activities of the Idrisi in fomenting discontent along the frontier. The Idrisi was, after all, a very paltry fellow. Had not he been driven out of Jizan, horse, foot and artillery, at the time of the Asir revolt, by a. mere 300 Saudi soldiers! He was, moreover, a liar and cheat, and Ibn Saud would tolerate no more of his mischief-making, but would ruthlessly punish should he (the Idrisi) pursue his present tactics. It was suggested, therefore, that the Idrisi should be expelled from the Yemen before further complications occurred and the relations between the two rulers were involved in the trouble. At any rate, Ibn Saud added a little significantly, all the necessary measures had been taken to deal with the Idrisi and those who were assisting him. 8. This summary is necessarily bald and somewhat simplified. I may perhaps record that I became increasingly conscious of the determination with which Ibn Saud was putting forward his demands. The telegrams, it seemed to me, contained noticeably less than the usual seasoning of pious utterances with which he is wont to lard his communications. He seemed to mean business. The telegrams were sent some ten days ago and so far no reply has been received from Sana. The delay in communicating them to me was explained by the absence of Amir Feisal recently, with his family, in Khurma, a village some little distance east of Taif, and Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman's own absence for a time in Nejd (where, however, it may be mentioned, he had not seen the King). 9. I questioned Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman concerning the treaty between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen in regard to the frontier in the Najran area. He admitted that he was unable to tell me whether the agreement was a written one or whether it was merely a verbal understanding. He informed me that a number of the leading tribal personages of the Beni Yam had recently been to Riyadh for a conference with the King. 10. It may be perhaps inferred from the stand now taken by Ibn Saud that his attitude is stiffening slightly. Feeling reassured as to the security of his northern and other frontiers and enriched by the recent arrival of a handsome sum in ready cash, which he no doubt regards as the earnest of more to come, King Ibn Saud may now conceivably feel more able to take a strong line. 11.

His Britannic dtti Majesty's Embassy, while stating that the two Arabian Monarchs were again in teitrf telegraphic, communication, represented that, according to a report received from the British Charge d'Affaires at Jedda, the Imam had demanded of King Ibn nljl' Saud the cession of Nejran and the postponement of the other questions at issue; ^.i. that, according to the Saudi interpretation of an agreement concluded in 1927 | va l(,i between the two States, Nejran and northwards was to belong to the Saudi it of® Arabian Kingdom, while Wayla and southwards was to belong to the Yemen; €lll . that the Imam had accepted this settlement except where it related to the Idrisi territory; and that the Imam's recent request would therefore appear to constitute a repudiation of the agreement in question. His Britannic Majesty's. IrfCe Embassy finally asked what was the Imam's version of the dispute regarding Nejran and the above-mentioned agreement of 1927. 2. In reply to the above communications, the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs have the honour to inform His Britannic Majesty's Embassy as follows:— The information in the possession of the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs, is to the effect that there was no question of any detention of the Saudi delegation at Sanaa, such as that described in His Britannic Majesty's Embassy's pro -memoria of the 3rd August. This information was implicitly confirmed by a Saudi official communique, published in the semi-official Jedda paper Umm -al-Qura of the 11th August, which makes no mention of such a detention, and states that the Saudi delegation had left Sanaa, as the illness of the Imam did not permit him to continue the conversations already begun; the communique added that, as was stated in His Britannic Majesty's Embassy's note verbale of [907 cc—2] il 2S7 THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT■ib« the 30th August, Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahia were continuing to maintain telegraphic communication, with a view to reaching a settlement of the questions outstanding between the two States. 3. In accordance with the request contained in His Britannic Majesty's Embassy's note verhale of the 30th August, the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs have already taken steps to ascertain the Imam's point of view regarding the agreement said to have been concluded between him and King Ibn Saud in 1927 in regard to the frontiers between the two States. Pending, however, the receipt of this information, the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs deem it useful to submit to His Britannic Majesty's Embassy certain observations on the existence of such an agreement. In the first place, the fact remains that neither during the Italo-British conversations held in Rome in 1927 nor in the correspondence subsequently exchanged between the Italian and British Governments regarding the relations between the Yemen and Saudi Arabia and the general situation in the Arabian Peninsula was mention apparently ever made, or recourse ever had, to the agreement referred to above. In the second place, the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs are able to communicate to His Britannic Majesty's Embassy the following information, which recently reached them from an authoritative and entirely reliable source at Sanaa, at the very moment when the negotiations with the Saudi delegation there were commencing. The latter delegation did, in fact, refer to an alleged agreement regarding the frontiers, concluded some years ago between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, but the Yemeni Government represented to the Saudi mission that this agreement did not, in fact, exist, and that all that had taken shape was a mere draft, prepared by the Amil of Midi with some Saudi delegates on the occasion of the dispute regarding Jebel Ayir—a draft which was never approved by the Imam. The Saudi delegation were invited by the Yemeni Government to produce the text of this agreement, but they were never able to do so. In the third place, it is known that during the months previous to last May the Imam's eldest son, Seif-el-Islam Ahmed, undertook a military police expedition in Nejran to subdue certain tribes. These operations in a territory which, according to the alleged agreement of 1927, was under the sovereignty of Ibn Saud, did not prevent the latter from subsequently sending a delegation to Sanaa to negotiate with the Imam. This suggests that the possession of Nejran by the Saudi Arabian Kingdom was at any rate not clearly stipulated in any agreement between the Yemen and Saudi Arabia. The Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs, however, may have occasion to communicate further information as a result of the enquiries which they have already set on foot. 4. The Royal Government is in agreement with His Britannic Majesty's Government in considering the present tension between the two Arabian kingdoms as being of a grave character; and, with a view to contributing their share towards the maintenance of peace in that region, they consider it incumbent upon them to submit, in the same spirit of frank and friendly collaboration as that which marked the Rome conversations in 1927, the following further considerations to His Britannic Majesty's Government:— The principal question which divides the two Arabian kingdoms is that of the sovereignty of Asir, a territory in which King Ibn Saud has, since 1926, exercised rights of occupation and possession, thus modifying the pre-existing situation to the detriment of the interests of the Yemen. In their note verhale of the 10th September, 1931, the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs had occasion to recapitulate the past history of the question, setting forth in detail the subsequent interventions of King Ibn Saud in that territory, first by the imposition of a Saudi protectorate (in 1926) and then by the transformation of the protectorate into an annexation (October 1930). As mentioned in the above note verhale, the de facto situation created by King Ibn Saud in Asir resulted in an exchange of views between the Italian and British Governments, which agreed to postpone any formal or direct act of recognition of the sovereignty of King Ibn Saud over Asir. The Royal Government have already had occasion to represent to His Britannic Majesty's Government that this action of King Ibn Saud in Asir might provoke natural and comprehensible reactions on the part of the Imam, and accordingly to indicate the desirability of restraining King Ibn Saud from^0(1 proceeding on the path on which he had set out. The Foreign Office replied that ■ they saw no possibility of an outbreak of hostilities between the two Arabian kingdoms, and that they did not consider that there were for the moment any %% grounds for preoccupation. ofiv Since then the situation has been aggravated. As a result of the recent ^Ui], revolt of Asir tribes against the Saudi Government (a revolt during which the Imam maintained a correctly neutral attitude), King Ibn Saud completely t ij eliminated the family of the Idrisi from participation in the government of Asir licit and transformed that territory into a mere province of the Saudi Arabian nt, l :; JKingdom. ers %; cons idering the present situation, the Royal Government, as they had id ^ ' occasion to state in their note verbale of the 10th September, 1931, referred to , 4 J J above, are of the opinion that it is impossible to disregard the foregoing events, , since the situation itself originated in the absorption of Asir by King Ibn Saud w f} against the will of the local population and without taking into account the / vaunted rights of the Imam. [ 0 y The attitude of absolute intransigence characterising Saudi policy in regard J to Asir was illustrated in a conversation which took place last May between the j f Eoyal Minister at Jedda and Fuad Hamza, the Saudi Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in which the latter categorically stated that 'Asir is an l - Mr integral part of the Saudi Arabian territory and kingdom, whose ownership H^ok*thereof is not open to question.' 6. The Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs must further draw His toil-Britannic Majesty's Embassy's most serious attention to the fact that, while ^•' v negotiations between the Imam Yahia and Ibn Saud are still proceeding, the Wt fB latter has taken the initiative in warlike preparations which leave little doubt as fiitedkito his intentions. He is, in fact, concentrating considerable forces on the Yemen kw frontiers, reinforcing the base at Jizan, enrolling troops in Nejd and Tehama, transporting troops and war material into Asir (availing himself, among other isprewl things, of the steamers of Besse and Co., of Aden), acquiring arms and munitions lobiBpd distributing arms to the tribes. It is natural that such steps should provoke the Imam to take the necessary i ea b: precautionary and defensive measures. 7. The Italian Government are confident that the British Government are in agreement with them as to the necessity of avoiding at all costs a conflict ^ liii between the two States. The origin of such a conflict would be found in the wee]] ^ suppression of the buffer State, the existence of which was held by the Rome conversations to be necessary for the very purpose of preventing acute friction j, iy . between the two Arab kingdoms. The conflict would, it is unnecessary to state, 1 hold the possibility of grave consequences and disorders throughout the Arabian ]llies Peninsula. 8. The Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs are disposed to regard as a ^ r 1 , [satisfactory consequence of the British action at Jedda and the similar Italian 56111 action at Sanaa the fact that, despite the return to their country of the Saudi delegation which were despatched to Sanaa, negotiations between the Imam and [ c011 ll King Ibn Saud have not been broken off, but are continuing by means of f telegraphic correspondence between the two Arabian Sovereigns. ^fof The Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs have the honour to assure His Britannic Majesty's Embassy that, in accordance with the conclusions of the Rome conversations of 1927, they have taken urgent steps to use fresh counsels inkif of moderation at Sanaa. SaP The Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs nevertheless, having regard to ifyiiW paragraphs 1 and 2 of the conclusions of those conversations and to the In#; indications contained in the previous paragraphs of their present note, consider it necessary that fresh counsels of moderation should also be urged upon King Ibn Saud, having due regard to the de jure and de facto elements in the Lirf/ situation, so as to induce him, on the one hand, to suspend his preparations for war, and, on the other, to recede from the intransigent attitude which he has adopted, so that, by recognising the necessity of finding between the parties an lS i« equitable settlement of the question of Asir, the necessary atmosphere may be ^ created for the successful progress of the negotiations.

(No. 290.) Sir, Jedda, September 12, 1933. WITH reference to my despatch No. 275 of the 29th August last, relative to the strained relations at present existing between the rulers of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, and the recent telegraphic exchanges that have taken place between them, I have the honour to inform you that from my conversation with Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman on the 7th September, briefly reported to you by telegram the same day, I understand that his correspondence with the Imam Yahya has so far yielded Ibn Saud scant satisfaction. The series of telegrams addressed to the Imam, the gist of which was reported in my despatch under reference, embodying all the main heads of the Saudi case, had been carefully designed to leave no doubt or ambiguity in the way of an equally considered reply by the Imam. A repy was, indeed, in due course received, but beyond a Koranic text and a platitude, contained no more than a bare, and rather dismissive, acknowledg ment. The Minister of Finance did not dwell on the matter at any length, but I gathered the impression that the failure of this attempt to elicit a reasoned reply had been received by Ibn Saud with chagrin and a deepening of his resolve to seek, if other means failed, a solution by a resort to force of arms. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman state(| that, in his personal opinion, matters would now be allowed to rest where they were until the King had completed his military dispositions, whereupon he would confront the Imam with an ultimatum. 2. That this was no idle speculation seems daily more and more evident. I have reported by telegram and in my despatch under reference that, as long as five weeks ago, Saudi forces of the North-Eastern c 4 Command '' were ordered to proceed in the direction of the Najran district, if, indeed, they were not to enter the district itself, and since then rumours have been current to the effect that recruiting has been actively carried on of late in the Medina and Taif districts,, and that the forces so collected have been drafted south. 3. I have to-day reported by telegram that over 700 soldiers were embarked here and left by steamer yesterday for Jizan. So large a force can scarcely be explained by the normal requirements of garrison duty in Asir or of replace ments and reliefs. Ibn Saud's military preparations are, it seems certain,, approaching completion, and unless the Imam Yahya can be persuaded to adopt a more conciliatory attitude, it is to be feared that an armed clash cannot be very distant. 4. These more recent developments have naturally excited a good deal of interest and a certain measure of apprehension locally. I enclose herewith an extract from the Egyptian Gazette of the 6th September, in which the Jedda correspondent of the Ahram fairly accurately summarises the course of events, as far as they are generally known here.C) I'also enclose a further report, which appeared in the Egyptian Gazette of the 2nd September, in which the Ahram's Rome correspondent records information obtained from a reliable source as to the nature of the first letter addressed by the Imam to Ibn Saud after the rupture of negotiations at* Sanaa and confided to the Saudi delegation to deliver to the King. In paragraph (&amp;) of my telegram No. 158 of the 19th August, and from the Minister for Foreign Affairs' note to me, forwarded under my printed despatch No. 263 of the 17th August, it will be observed that the Saudi Arab Government assert that this letter proposed that Ibn Saud should recognise Najran as part of the Yemen, and that the consideration of other questions in dispute should be postponed. From this press report, whose general accuracy it may be possible for His Majesty's Ambassador at Rome to verify, it would appear that the Zeidi overture was conceived in, perhaps, not quite such intransigent terms as Ibn Saud would have us believe. (M Not printed. [907 dd—4]5. Events seem to be steadily marching towards a climax and from the determination which Ibn Sand is pursuing his military plans the possibilities of a peaceful settlement and the efficacy of sedative counsels are just as steadily diminishing. 6. Copies of this despatch and enclosures are being sent to His Majesty's Ambassador at Rome, His Majesty's High Commissioners for Egypt and Trans- jordan, the Acting Commissioner, Aden, and to the Senior Naval Officer in the Red Sea Sloops. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT. Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from the Egyptian Gazette of September 2, 1933. Y emen -S audi R elations. THE Ahram's Rome correspondent learns from a reliable source that when the Saudi delegation which had been to Sanaa, the capital of the Yemen, to discuss outstanding questions between the Saudi Kingdom and the Yemen with the Imam Yahya, and which was for some time kept virtual prisoner, returned to Mecca and Riad, the capital of the Nejd, it carried with it a lengthy letter from the Imam to King Ibn Saud regarding the questions which the delegations had gone to discuss. Although the contents of the letter are not yet fully known, declares the correspondent, it is certain that the Imam has expressed a desire to conclude a treaty of defence with King Ibn Saud. It would appear, he continues, that the Imam's viewpoint on the subject is that he would like a treaty with King Ibn Saudf but that he is about to conclude a treaty of friendship and ' c bon-voisinage ' with Britain regarding the nine protected settlements, and he believes that the conclusion of a treaty between him and King Ibn Saud would obstruct the progress of negotiations between him and Great Britain and might be given an unsuitable interpretation by Italy and Russia. The Frontier Question. The Imam's opinion of the frontier question is that the inhabitants of the district of Najran, the subject of dispute, are neither Sunnis nor Zeidis, and that they have never actually been subject to the Yemen or to the Nejd, and that, there fore, he considers that the occupation of this district does not constitute a violation of pledges or transgression on Nejd. As regards Asir and Tihama, the Imam maintains that although these two territories were handed over to King Ibn Saud by their original rulers, A1 Aid and the Idrisi, yet there are historical considerations which induce him to consider these two territories as part of the Yemen. Nevertheless the Imam has suggested an alternative solution of the problem, namely, that the Idrisi should again be allowed to rule over these two territories and should be given the choice to conclude a treaty with whichever side they wish. King Ibn Saud's opinion on this subject is not yet known. All Moslems in Egypt are Sunnis. The great majority of Moslems in Iraq and in Persia are Shias. The Sunnis make their pilgrimage at Mecca and Medina, whereas the Shias go to Najaf and Karbala in Iraq. The Zeidis are neither Sunnis nor Shias.i THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (A rabia ). fcV t September 30, 1933. CONFIDENTIAL. fl V U S ection!

I HAD a conversation this morning with Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, assisted by M. Zada, about the Najran situation. I explained that I was puzzled as to the exact significance of the expression ' Najran,' and as to the precise nature of the present situation. As regards the latter, Fuad Bey Hamza had expressly told me in June that the operations of the Yemeni forces, while giving ground for anxiety, were confined to what was admittedly Yemeni territory. He had distinguished hour b e ^ ween ' Najran ' as being Saudi and the Beni Yam as being Yemeni, and, on my pressing him, had identified the admittedly Yemeni territory with the u N geographical name of 44 Jauf.' The last information he had ' given me before we oth left Jedda was that Seif-ul-Islam Ahmed and his brother, operating against the local tribes, had sustained a reverse and been driven back, but were preparing a counter-attack. It was now suggested that the Yemenis were in Saudi territory, but I could not find any precision as to when they had altered the situation, as described to me by Fuad Bey, by crossing the alleged frontier. 2. Sheikh Hafiz admitted that the use of the name ' 4 Najranin Arab geographical parlance was very vague. It merely meant the area on the confines of the Yemen, but could not be defined as having geographical boundaries. He it ife admitted also that the 1927 agreement was an oral arrangement, but it was an iMti: agreement which the Imam himself had invoked on several occasions and notably imwhen asserting his claim to Jebel Arwa in 1931. The sheikh and M. Zada atetjfe agreed that there had been a definite change in the situation since the early onsil summer. The Yemenis had succeeded in their operations against the tribes, and ifatiou |j!i flushed with this success, had pushed on into Saudi territory, advancing to the neighbourhood of Badar, without meeting with opposition, and then stopping short. Sheikh Hafiz's first telegrams regarding the actual presence of the Yemenis in Saudi territory had reached him about the beginning of August, u. The Imam's attitude, according to M. Zada, was that Ibn Saud had no officials or ielD ^ forces in the invaded area, and that he (the Imam) was free to do what he liked 3. Sheikh Hafiz agreed with me that, as regards the frontier, a distinction must be made between (a) the frontier between Najran and the Yemen, which, in the Saudi view, was settled in 1927; and (b) the frontier between what is now called Asir Tihama (i.e., the late Idrisi's territory) and the Yemen, which was settled in 1931. I did not gather that the frontier at (a) was expressly confirmed incete i n the 1931 negotiations, which had turned only on Jebel Arwa, although, as stated above, the Imam had invoked the 1927 agreement when claiming itioflft Jebel Arwa. Sheikh Hafiz agreed that Saada was Yemeni, but said that Waila tie# was Saudi. bevel-' 4. I confined the conversation to an elucidation of the facts, as viewed by i, the Saudi Government, and avoided any mention of the merits of the quarrel oi* of IK Ibn Sand's military preparations. Sheikh Hafiz and M. Zada, while describing tpfthe situation as recorded above, appeared to share the general ignorance f 0 regarding; the exact geography of the region. ANDREW EYAN.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 286, I send you herewith a record of a conversation between a member of my staff and the head of the African Depart ment at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, regarding the relations between the Imam Yahya and King Ibn Saud. 2. I have the impression that the Italian Government are greatly disturbed over the situation in Asir. Indeed, Signor Suvich mentioned it himself to me the other day and said it looked as if we were heading for war. It would accordingly be of great assistance to me if all the arguments of the Italian Government {i.e., those contained in their various notes verbales and in the enclosed record of con versation) could be carefully examined with a view to seeing whether any of their desiderata can possibly be met. Should this not be the case, I think that a full and reasoned reply to their representations would in any case be appreciated. In view of the delicacy and complexity of the subject, I submit for your considera tion that it might be desirable to'hold a meeting of experts, either here or in London. 3. Nothing has so far appeared in the press, but it is fairly evident that this silence would not be maintained in the event of actual hostilities between the Yemen and the Hejaz-Nejd. 4. I am sending a further despatch to you on the subject by bag. I have, &amp;g. E. GEAHAM. Enclosure in No. 1. Relations between the Imam and Ibn Saud. I ASKED for an interview with Signor Guarnaschelli last night and told him, in effect, that the Foreign Office did not desire to reply at length to the Italian Government's note verbale of the 21st September, partly owing to the fact that manv of the issues were still obscure, and partly owing to the Italian Government being already aware of their attitude in regard,to Asir. Signor Guarna,schelli did not seem' to think that the Italian Government were entirely aware of it so i referred him to our note verhale of the 24th July 1931. I then gave him verbally a literal translation in French of the second paragraph of Foreign Office telegram ^No 314 I Signor Guarnaschelli thanked me for my commumcation but w^ quite obviously disappointed with it. He said the Italian Government s note had been drafted in no polemical spirit (a remark with which I that it was a reasoned expose of their attitude, and that he had hoped it would not have been entirely without effect in London. He then repea e o me ,® w ® known Italian arguments in regard to Asir, laying stress on the fact that the Imam had not coifmitted any aggressive act against ^ Jrant induce him to recognise Ibn Saud s position there. | A '• j t ^ at T mam But he replied that was not, and never had been, part of had just as much claim to it as Ibn Saud P 0 ® SI ^ ■i i i £ ar as Asir is the coastal belt by Jizan, and remained Najran.) As for the Jemtk ?oThe effect that the S~ GovemLent had never said that a agreement did exist, but [935 i—1]2 Signer Guarnaschelli observed that we could hardly admit the possibility of a ' Gentlemen's Agreement ' between Arabian monarchs?) Hence it was no good Ibn Saud complaining of a non possumus attitude on the part of the Imam. The question at issue was the status of Asir. The Imam had never recognised Ibn Baud's annexation; there was absolutely no reason why he should; but Ibn Saud was apparently using this refusal as an excuse for making war on him. The Italian Government had the most disturbing accounts of Ibn Saud's military preparations. They could not dismiss the possibility that he was out to smash the Imam in the same way and by much the same methods as he had smashed King Hussein. It might not actually be a question of occupying Sanaa. The Imam himself was, of course, also arming in defence, and his tribes were war like. Also Ibn Sand's finances were none too good. But a heavy defeat would discredit the Imam, might even cost him his throne, and would earn for Ibn Saud the title of te Ghazi.' In any case a war would be lamentable from every point of view (I assured him that this at least was an opinion entirely shared by His Majesty's Government). Well, continued Signor Guarnaschelli, why couldn't we do something rather more positive than just counselling moderation? The situation was very grave; anybody could see that it was going from bad to worse. Our influence with Ibn Saud was clearly very great. If it had sufficed to induce him to conclude a treaty with his deadly enemy, Abdulla of Transjordan, surely it would suffice to make him come to some sort of terms with the Imam ? Provided the question of Asir was not definitely and finally closed so far as we were concerned, we would not find the Imam unreasonable. An agreement might be arrived at on various ^ases—reinstatement of Idrisi with liberty to conclude a treaty with either side {see cutting from Egyptian Gazette enclosed in Jedda despatch No. 290), partition of Asir, not necessarily in equal portions, &amp;c. There were, indeed, obvious lines of compromise, if only we told Ibn Saud firmly that he had got to behave, and the Asir question was not absolutely closed. I said nothing which could possibly be interpreted as showing that we regarded it as in any way open, but promised to report faithfully his point of view, which was very friendlily expressed. During our long (and I fear rather discursive) conversation, Signor Guarnaschelli referred once or twice to 'a Great Empire' and 'a small State,' and though he was too polite (or too politic) to say so, I had a feeling that he was trying to represent us as bullies. Again when he referred to the ' rancune ' of the Imam if he was forced to climb down absolutely, it was quite possible to infer that he was also referring to Italian rancour as well. This part of the conversation, however, dealt with Aden, and I have recorded it in a separate minute (see Rome telegram to Foreign Office .No. 285).

Rome, October 6, 1933. Enclosure in No. 1. 0.^1 Note verbale. )fc (Translation.) WITH reference to the contents of the second and third paragraphs of . His Britannic Majesty's Embassy's note verbale No. 221 of the 6th July, 1932, the ifc Eoyal Ministry for Foreign Affairs have the honour to bring the following to id I {(i the notice of the Embassy :— 2. The captain of the port at Massawa has informed the Government of the Colony of Eritrea that, according to reports received from the captains of Italian vessels navigating in the lower Eed Sea, and particularly on the route from Massawa to Hodeida, the safety of shipping in that zone is gravely impaired by the discontinuance of the Centre Peak Light, more especially on account of the currents around that island, which, by causing considerable deviations of route, may give rise to accidents, should the discontinuance of the light be prolonged. The captain of the port has accordingly requested that steps be urgently taken for the restoration of the light in the interests of the safety of shipping, particularly on the route from Massawa to Hodeida, which is continually used by steamships and sailing vessels, both of Italian and foreign nationality. 3. The Government of the Colony of Eritrea have acceded to this request and taken the necessary steps for the restoration of the light, the operation of which has been resumed as from the 1st October last. The lighthouse zone of Massawa has already taken steps to issue the necessary wireless notice to navigators containing particulars of the light. 4. In bringing the above to the knowledge of His Britannic Majesty's Embassy, the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs need hardly add that the presence of an Italian staff on the Island of Zebait (Centre Peak), which will ensure the operation of the light, implies no modification of the international juridical status of the island itself, which, together with that of the Islands of Abu Ail and Jebel Taiz, was considered by the Italian and British Governments in 1928 during the negotiations for the Eed Sea Lights Convention, when the conclusion was reached that the question of the sovereignty of those islands should remain in suspense.

FROM your Excellency's despatch No. 753 of the 5th October there appears to be some danger of a serious misunderstanding between His Majesty's Govern ment in the United Kingdom and the Italian Government with regard to the present dispute between King Ibn Saud and the Imam of the Yemen. You have from time to time been sent such items of information received from various sources as appeared to throw light on the origins or details of that dispute. I realise, however, that where the issues are so complicated it may not be easy to construct a complete picture of the position from such fragments. I therefore send you this statement of the views of His Majesty's Government regarding the present Arabian crisis in the hope that, although it may not be possible to meet the wishes of the Italian Government entirely in this matter, you will at any rate have sufficient material from which to give them a full account of the position as it is seen from here. 2. There is one important point in regard to which the views of His Majesty's Government and the Italian Government seem to be particularly at variance, namely the question of Asir. As stated in my telegram No. 314 of the 29th September, I had hoped to avoid further controversy on this subject, but from the Italian note verbale of the 21st September, a copy of which was enclosed in . Mr. Murray's despatch No. 722 of the 22nd September, and also from the record of a conversation with Signor Guarnaschelli (enclosed in your despatch under reply), it appears that the Italian Government are still anxious to press the point. The attitude of His Majesty's Government towards Ibn Saud's gradual absorption of Asir into his dominions has not changed since the date of Mr. Arthur Henderson's despatch No. 892 of the 17th July, 1931; His Majesty's Government consider that as a result of the agreements of 1926 and 1930 Asir has become, both de facto and de jure, an integral part of Ibn Saud's territories. The Italian Government have never recognised this absorption and it was purely out of deference to their views that His Majesty's Government agreed to postpone a formal expression of their own recognition of Ibn Saud's sovereignty over Asir, although they reserved their right, which they have since exercised, to correspond with the Saudi Arabian Government on matters connected with Asir (including the Farsan Islands). With regard to Signor Guarnaschelli's geographical definition of Asir, it may be remarked that the 'coastal belt' to which he refers is what is known as ' Tihamat Asir,' which, according to the official Saudi account, constitutes the Idrisi's proper dominions, recognised by Ibn Saud as such until the rebellion of 1932, whereas the interior of Asir, known as Asir-as-Surat, which stretches from this coastal belt to the border of Nejran, is claimed by Ibn Saud in his own right as a result, it is believed, of his agreement with the present Idrisi s predecessor in 1919-20. 3. But whatever may be the geographical truth regarding Asir, His Majesty's Government consider the arrangements made by Ibn Saud and the Idrisi in 1926 and 1930 as valid engagements binding upon both parties. Unlike the alleged agreement of 1927 regarding Nejran, the agreements of 1926 and 1930 regarding Asir were recorded in writing and duly published (as shown in Sir Austen Chamberlain's despatch No. 131 of the 29th January, 1927, and Mr. Arthur Henderson's despatch No. 192 of the 16th February, 1931). Further, whatever view may be taken of the reasons for the rebellion of the Idrisi in 1932 r the fact remains that, in spite of the attempts made by Ibn Saud to effect a settlement by negotiation, the Idrisi conducted an armed revolt against Ibn Saud and may thus be held to have forfeited the privileged position which he previously enjoyed It is most unlikely that Ibn Saud will ever agree to give up Asir, unless he is obligecT by force of arms to do so. and the Italian proposal for the erection of a buffer State between the Yemen and Saudi Arabia could probably be put into [935 n—1]2 effect only—if at all—by the armed expulsion of Ibn Saud from the province rpi Considerable though the influence may be which the Italian Government believe ' His Majesty's Government to possess with Ibn Saud, it is certainly not powerful t enough to persuade him to abandon Asir without a struggle, and even to suggest n such a course to him might well deal that influence a blow from which it would , with difficulty, if ever, recover. II al 4. Finally, even if the Imam may not actually have attacked Asir (although on certain maps the town of Badr, which was at one time reported to be 1 i threatened by Imamic troops, is shown as being well within Asir), he is stated to 8 ' / have laid claim to a large part of that province as recorded, for instance in ! paragraph 5 of Mr. Calvert's despatch No. 248 of the 1st August {Eastern ^ {Arabia), August 16, Section 4). Further, his retention of the Idrisi in the W' neighbourhood of the Asiri frontier, where he can do the most mischief, is in itself ' sinC an act of doubtful friendliness, against which Ibn Saud has already protested as ^ mentioned in paragraph 2 {c) (2) of the note of the 5th August from the Saudi ^ Minister for Foreign Affairs to Mr. Calvert {Eastern {Arabia), August 24 jsl10 Section 3). ' iHis 5. As regards the alleged agreement of 1927 and other frontier arrange- P, cel ments, there is little to be said which has not already been communicated to you bv ^ v despatch or telegram (in particular my despatches No. 660 of the 10th August p : and No. 860 of the 10th October and letter of the 3rd October). Further enquiry, r e( both in London and in Jedda, has failed to elicit any more substantial information,' but such information as there is tends to show that there was probably an oral arrangement regarding Nejran, which was concluded in 1927 and divided the ^ regions east of Asir between Ibn Saud and the Imam in an uncertain proportion ^ and possibly regulated other sections of their common frontier as well. The Imam himself is said to have appealed to this agreement at least twice (see ^ paragraphs 2 and 3 of the enclosure in my despatch No. 660 of the 10th August). |®t Lastly, there are two points in connexion with Nejran, which are worth noting: one is the arrangement which Ibn Saud is said to'have made with the tribesmen m early last year, under which they obtained a virtual independence (see my ®n( despatch No. 860 of the 10th October); the second bears on the expedition of ®ii Seif-al-Islan Ahmed, the Imam's son, in the spring of 1933, which is referred to 8, ] in paragraph 3 of the Italian note verbale of the 21st September. During the iffin earlier part of the Yemeni operations in or near Nejran the Saudi Deputy iiss Minister for Foreign Affairs maintained to His Majesty's Minister at Jedda that in t there had been no violation of the frontier at all. But it is possible that this iSaud attitude was dictated partly by the hope that the resistance of the tribes concerned fite, to the Yemeni troops might render intervention unnecessary. [ISig 6. In point of fact, the only frontier arrangement which is definitely known tin to have been concluded between Ibn Saud and the Imam is Ibn Saud's decision isnf of 1931 acknowledging the Jebel Arwa to be in the Yemen, contained in the itfes enclosed copy of Sir Andrew Ryan's despatch No. 486 of the 19th December, hh 1931.Q But in judging the Imam's conduct in the present crisis, His Majesty's bgn Government have attached little importance to any of the accusations of frontier jioald violation made against him. The facts are too confused to permit of any bpoi conclusion on this point and His Majesty's Government are not prepared to give any opinion upon it, far less to embark on a controversy over it. And in so far stal as they believe Ibn Saud, rather than the Imam, to be in the stronger position in L ( the present dispute, they base that view not on any alleged agreements which |tion may have been concluded between these potentates, but on the present behaviour of the two parties concerned. 1^ 7. After Asir, the second main point of difference between His Majesty's L Government and the Italian Government appears to be with regard to Ibn Saud's immediate intentions. These must necessarily be, in the last resort,' a matter of ^ speculation, 'but 'after considering all the evidence supplied by His Majesty's | r Charge d'Affaires at Jedda, His Majesty's Government are of opinion that L Ibn Sa.ud does not desire to undertake a campaign against the Imam, much less L ■ operations on the scale envisaged by Signor Guarnaschelli, since both the financial ^ ( -and the political strain would involve him in grave risk. In particular, it is ^ becoming increasingly difficult to collect the Nejdi tribesmen for further warfare L, in the south.- To represent his present military preparations as the deliberate ' prelude to an attack on the Yemen similar to that launched against the Hejaz I 1 ) January 15, 1932, Section 1.t ^ LLf Sow ' ^ ^ s '. therefore, an exaggeration. The most likely interpretation of those preparations is that given in Mr. Calvert's telegram No. 163 of the 7th c .34 September, a copy of which was enclosed in my despatch No. 775 of the 12th September, namely, that having failed to secure any but the most evasive replies to his representations to the Imam, Ibn Saud intends to exact a satis- ilta % factory answer by supporting his final demand with a threat of force. As % indicated m my telegram No. 318 of the 3rd October, the Imam does not yet seem to have responded to Ibn Sard's full statement of his case. S0 5 the question arises whether His Majesty's Government 'can in fact, as the Italian Government suggest, restrain Ibn Saud from his My present course by exercising their influence. It may be said at once that the mijiip' analogy of the treaty between Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah is not applicable asag; here, since it is evident that in the case of that instrument His Majesty's iopstii Government were in a position to exert their influence over both parties at once (irii; all( ^ ^ lus bring about a rapprochement. In the present instance, unless the Imam shows signs of being willing to negotiate, there appears to be little hope fc l{ J that His Majesty's Government will be able to restrain Ibn Saud. They will Mite a ^ nlcs t certainly not be able to do so before his preparations are completed, and, | 0 {.: : r in their view, the only moments at which they are likely to be able to make their . :; ! influence felt at all are either when the Imam definitely offers to settle by negotia- / ^ tion the outstanding differences between himself and Ibn Saud (a move which, -according to the present evidence, he has not yet made) or at the actual moment * when Ibn Sand's ultimatum has been delivered. At either of these junctures ^ it will be for His Majesty's Government and the Italian Government to intervene 1111M31 ' with all the persuasion at their command to induce the two rulers to listen to reason and to settle their differences by negotiation. Failing a conciliatory reply from the Imam before Ibn Sand's military preparations are complete, there appears to be no prospect of an earlier solution of the crisis, and His Majesty's Jpovernment feel that their intervention would be entirely ineffective, unless kill they were prepared in their turn to threaten Ibn Saud with forcible action, if ndepeifii ^ ^ no t come to terms with the Imam—a course which appears to them both 01M unwise in itself and unjustified by the facts of the position as they see them. jHiii 9. I realise that the attitude outlined above affords little material for a iteir 1 reassuring answer to the representations of the Italian Government. At bottom, ntiir this is so because His Majesty's Government feel unable to accept either the life; Italian thesis regarding Asir or the Italian Government's interpretation of jpl: Ibn Sand's intentions or their reluctance to criticise the Imam's conduct in this dispute. I hope that Mr. Jebb's reference in his conversation on the 4th October with Signor Guarnaschelli to the 1931 correspondence between His Majesty's ■listf; Government and the Italian Government regarding the status of Asir will have given sufficient indication of the views of His Majesty's Government in regard to that question to enable you to avoid further discussion of that point. If, however, ; J|: your Excellency feels that it is necessary to repeat those views, the account of ' them given in this despatch will assist you in giving a full definition of them. I would prefer, however, that apart from a brief reference to the 1931 correspondence, you should base your reply to the Italian Government on the considerations set out in paragraphs 7 and 8 above, and in particular on the !ltI y view taken by His Majesty's Government of the intentions of Ibn Saud and the rlt j Imam's evasive conduct, and also regarding the appropriate moment for inter- st# vention. You should assure the Italian Government that His Majesty's Government are no less anxious than they to avert a war between Saudi Arabia igpr#'? an( j t | ie Yemen; but that in view of the respective characters of the two disputants and their present conduct of the dispute, it appears to His Majesty's Government unlikely that their intervention would, at present, have any effect, eplfc They are, however, willing to exert to the full whatever influence they possess either when the present deadlock in the telegraphic correspondence between the Ibfll two rulers is resolved or at latest before the actual outbreak of hostilities, and r eof they feel confident that they may count upon the continued co-operation of the ^ I# Italian Government when the moment arrives for this intervention. gioP, | 10.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 295 of the 19th September last,, regarding the strained rel atio ns at present existing between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, I have the honour to inform you that, as reported in my telegrams Nos. 173 and 176 of the 25th and 29th September respectively. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman described the general situation as unchanged. 2. The exchange of telegrams which for some time encouraged the hope that an amicable settlement would be the ultimate issue of present differences, has unfortunately been interrupted, and no further correspondence has taken place, if the Minister of Finance is to be believed, since the Imam Yahya's unsatisfactory reply, to which I referred in my despatch No. 290 of the 12th September. In consequence, Saudi preparations for a settlement by force of arms are being energetically pushed forward, and the Minister of Finance himself is actively engaged in the despatch of men and material to the south. His statement that Amir Feisal-bin-Saud had been appointed commander-in-chief, with his head quarters at Abha, I have already reported, and to this he added, in reply to my question, that if later developments made it necessary Amir Saud would himself supersede his cousin in the command. Indeed, I learn from a source usually fairly well-informed, that Amir Saud has already left Riyadh in the direction of Asir,. but has not unfurled his standard as such a proceeding would be tantamount to a declaration of war. The same source, although unaware of the appointment of Amir Feisal-bin-Saud, mentioned that three important personages, viz., Ibn Jiluwi, Feisal-bin-Lawey and the Amir Muhammad, brother of the King, had all been given a command in Asir. 3. There are many minor indications of widespread activity. A number of tribal leaders recently arrived in Jedda by Khedivial mail steamer from Yanbu for Asir, and recruiting in those northern littoral districts is reported to be active. Ibn Saud, it is further stated, has pressed into service and drafted to Najran all available camels in Nejd, including even those belonging to the Royal family. 4. During Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman's call on me on the 29th September, I took the opportunity to enquire concerning the report, which had appeared in the Egyptian press, and which was stated to have emanated from Aden, that a clash had recently occurred at Salla (a place I have been unable to identify, unless it be Senta) in the Tihamat Asir between Saudi and Yemeni forces. He professed to know of no such happening and said the report was probably due to an incident, now more than six weeks old, when a force of some 300 Saudi soldiers was. employed to exact taxes from a small but recalcitrant tribe inhabiting a village, whose name he had forgotten, immediately south of Jizan. The tribe had been brought to order and its tribal chiefs were now in prison at Jizan. 5. He then volunteered the information that fighting was still going on in Najran between the tribes and the Zeidi forces, and that as the former had been reinforced by certain tribal elements from the Wadi Dawasir, they were now getting the upper hand. The Imamic forces were withdrawing, not rapidly it was. true, as to abandon Najran would be to admit defeat, but the district was being, steadily cleared At my remark that the Dawasir tribe is related by blood ties to ; the Beni Yam of Nairan, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman stated that the Yam (as he called them), really consisted of elements of Yam proper, Dawasir and Mirri, a. congerie inhabiting a fairly wide area. . . .. ^ ^ * 6. His last reference to this subject was to reiterate his personal belief, to which as vou are aware he has previously given utterance, that Ibn Saud would allow events to take their course until he was militarily ready to enforce upon the Imam his demands Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman added that he was also of the opinion that, war or no war, Ibn Saud would maintain his army m Asir m [935 z—1]ft 2 readiness until he obtained complete satisfaction. This, it might be supposed, , would involve a heavy drain on the Saudi exchequer, but the Minister of Finance t* made the statement with some emphasis. 7. The dangers in the situation, therefore, have not diminished. It would be unwise to venture a forecast, but it is to be hoped that the offers of mediation and appeals to avoid a fratricidal war, which, it is reported, have been made by a number of leading Arab personages in different countries, including Prince Omar Toussoun of Egypt, will avail to bring about a peaceful settlement. 8.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 186 of the 2nd November, summarising the reply of Ibn Saud to the representations of His Majesty's Government made orally by me to the Minister of Finance on the 30th October regarding the present dispute between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a complete version in rough but, I believe, reasonablv accurate translation of the telegram read over to me by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman at our meeting of the 2nd November^ 1 ) I refrained from comment on the contents of the communication, limiting myself to an expression of thanks and a promise to convey the King's reply without delay to my Government. 2. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman went on to refer to Saudi preparations in Asir as being now practically complete. Units of the forces under the command of Amir Feisal-bin-Saud were now disposed somewhat nearer to the frontier with the Yemen, and he considered they would be readily available should they be called upon to resist a sudden incursion into Asir by Imamic troops. The Commander- in-chief still had his headquarters at Abha, in the vicinity of which the major part of the Saudi army was centred. He was accompanied by a mobile wireless set, and was in constant touch with Ibn Saud, who was, of course, similarly equipped. There was also a wireless set at Jizan, probably in addition to the wireless station known to have been established there by Marconi (Limited), as Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman stated that the set at Abha and that at Jizan were'the two portable sets presented to Ibn Saud by Sir Francis Humphrys in 1930. 3. Saudi military authorities have also had their resources in respect of communications considerably augmented recently by the arrival at Jedda towards the end of October of two large motor launches.' These, named the Nejd and the Riyadh, were purchased by Ibn Saud at Bahrein and made the voyage under their own power. They were at once put into commission for the transport of troops, and left for Jizan on the 1st November, carrying a number of soldiers estimated at 500. 4. No ultimatum, such as was foreseen by the Minister of Finance, has yet, as far as I am aware, been sent by the King to the Imam. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman was unable to inform me whether, if an ultimatum were issued, it would at once be published or become generally known, but, as I have reported in my telegram No. 183, he spontaneously promised to inform me privately as soon as he himself had news of its issue. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosure to His Majesty's Ambassador, Rome, His Majesty's High Commissioner for Transjordan, the Acting High Commissioner for Egypt, the Acting Chief Commissioner, Aden, and to the senior naval officer in the Red Sea sloops.

Section 1 [E 7639/7639/25] No. 1. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—{Received December 12.) (No. 338. Confidential.) Sir, Jedda, November 22, 1933. I HAVE the honour to report that Talaat Harb Pasha, who is described in No. 45 of the List of Leading Personalities in Egypt, enclosed in Cairo despatch No. 68 of the 9th January, as a Senator and chairman of directors of the Banque Misr, is understood locally to be flying from Suez to Jedda, with stops at Wejh and Yanbu, on or about the 2nd December, in a De Llavilland Dragon aeroplane belonging to Messrs. Misr-Airwork; a ground engineer sent by the latter to prepare the ground for landing arrived by steamer on the 19th November, and the agency work for it has been entrusted to Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), Jedda. 2. Talaat Pasha's objects in this visit, which is not expected to exceed four days, are said to be threefold, viz., {a) to fix up local representation for the two pilgrim ships, which, I understand, have recently been purchased by the Egyptisn Government for the conveyance of Egyptian pilgrims to and from the Hejaz; (&amp;) to organise the sale of Egyptian products in this country, in particular the cotton goods which are said to be produced nowadays by a subsidiary company of the Banque Misr; and {c) to explore the possibility of the Banque Misr opening a branch in Jedda to assume the functions of a State bank for the Hejaz, in view of the apparent demise of the ex-Khedive's project (see the correspondence ending with your confidential despatch No. 266 of the 5th October). 3. To these objects may, perhaps, be added a fourth, namely, that of demon strating one of Misr-Airwork's aeroplanes to Ibn Saud. You will recall that this company last year proposed to send an Avro to Jedda for this purpose (see the correspondence ending with the Acting High Commissioner for Egypt's Savingram to you. No. 91 of the 19th August, 1932), but did not proceed with the scheme. Their object at that time was to sell Ibn Saud light military aircraft, and it seems probable that the recent reports of tension between him and the Imam Yehya have led them to consider the moment opportune for a serious effort to this end. Local gossip is rife on the subject, the establishment of an air service between Egypt and Jedda being suggested in some quarters, whilst other and unkinder ones suggest that Talaat Pasha's idea in arriving by air is to be able to leave the country quickly in the event of war with the Yemen materialising. 4. The aeroplane, if and when it arrives, will be the first machine of any sort to fly in or near the Hejaz since the ill-fated Wapiti, whose crash was reported in Mr. Hope Gill's telegram No. 201 of the 14th September, 1931. Its arrival may serve to focus local attention on the parlous condition of the Saudi Air Force. The latter still consists of the four Wapitis and five old HH. 9's ~ bougETTrom His Majesty's Government; but the former, which alone might be made to fly, still remain, as they have remained since the time of the crash referred to above, in their ramshackle hangar, with absolutely no attention except an occasional greasing by an inexpert hand; while Ibn Saud remains without a single pilot capable of flying the machines, and without a single competent air-mechanic. No attempt has been made to develop any ground organisation, and projects, which have been reported on various occasions from this post, of engaging Turkish pilots and/or training Saudi subjects in Turkey, have remained unrealised. 5. With Saudi finances still further depleted by the war-preparations, the scale of which is easily the greatest yet made, the prospects of Ibn Saud being able to afford the heavy and continuous expense of employing competent pilots and ground staff, and of his embarking upon the essential refitting of his present niachines and the ground organisation necessary for any extensive flying, are receding further and further into the future. The prospects of his buying new machines seem even more remote, however tempting the opportunity thus to steal [991 m—1]2 a march on the Imam, unless the realisation of a State bank project should bring: with it a substantial loan or credit arrangements. The advent of a financier will in any event, be awaited with no little interest in this country. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Department of Overseas Trade and to his Excellency the High Commissioner for Egypt. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CALVERT.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT CONFIDENTIAL. [E 7969/234/25] EASTERN (A rabia). December 28, 1933. S ection 1. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—{Received December 28.) (No. 351.) Sir, Jedda, December 5, 1933. IN my telegram No. 197 of the 15th November I had the honour to indicate certain aspects of the local financial situation which might have a bearing on the Saudi attitude towards repayment of their debts. I submit herewith a somewhat fuller review of the situation. 2. All indications are that the j Saudi Government are making the most determined efforts to reduce expenditure to a minimum and to lose no chance of augmenting their income, in order to leave themselves the widest possible margin for the heavy expenditure entailed by the military preparations now being undertaken. The latter are, of course, on a scale unparalleled in the history of this country, for tribal contingents from every quarter of Arabia have now been sent south, together with all available munitions, including even such items as a battery of field-guns from Medina brought in by the* Turks before the Great War. The tribesmen receive little or no actual pay, but need equip ment, food and transport; a recent Mecca estimate put the present expenditure under this head at £5,000 a day. The figure is doubtless exaggerated and will be reduced in any case once the army has been transported to the required area, but even a tenth of this figure would be a sufficient drain on the Saudi income. To minimise it, the Government have recently taken to themselves importing such necessaries as paraffin, rice and sugar through certain old and trusted local firms such as Haji Zeinal Ali Ridha, with whom the Minister of Finance has been in relations since his Bombay days. This practice has hit other merchants hard. 3. The revenue has diminished almost to vanishing pcu£it. As you are aware, the bulk of it is derived from two sources, pilgrim s and customs receipts. ( ( The pilgrimage of 1933, 20,000, was the worst since the inauguration of the Saumregiine, and the prospects for 1934 tend to suggest that little, if any, improvement can be looked for. At present three pilgrim ships have arrived from the Straits and Java, bearing exiguous cargoes of pilgrims, and bookings are reported poor. The decline in the average value of pilgrims is moreover noticeable. Better-class and rich pilgrims are becoming rarer, and the tendency seems to be more and more for the pilgrimage to be confined to peasants, who bring with them the minimum sum necessary to do the pilgrimage in the cheapest manner. This reduces the total of their purchasing power and with it that of the shopkeepers and other classes of Hejazi who live by them. (V; 4. The decline in customs re ceipts cannot be measured, for no statistics are available,Tut must be considerable. The decreased number of pilgrims, the uncertainty of future numbers, the decline in the purchasing power of the people, the excessive increase of customs dues last May (see Jedda despatch No. 154) and the heavy stocks still held by local merchants as a legacy from the last eighteen months, have all contributed to the reduction of imports. Figures contributed privately by the Director of Customs are remarkable; during the first eight months of the current Arabic year (April to November 1933) the number of packages imported through Jedda was 9,847, as compared with 48,735 during a similar period last year. 5. Customs receipts are in any case heavily mortgaged by the system of drafts which the Saudi Government have adopted to an increasing extent in the last two years as a means of satisfying creditors without paying them. Fuad Bey Hamza told me on the 1st December that no such drafts had been issued since the beginning of the current Arabic year. My information suggests that this statement is not entirely accurate, and that certain favoured creditors^ notably the importing firm mentioned in paragraph 2, have, in effect, received [991 ee—1]such drafts; and that, moreover, these new drafts are ' 100 per cent.' ones i.e., allowing the importer to admit goods free of all duty until the amount of the draft is paid off, instead of the ' 25 per cent.' once formerly issued which merely entitle him to write off one-quarter of the amount of duty on each consignment while paying the remaining three-quarters in cash. In any case, the total of the drafts issued previous to this Arabic year and still unredeemed must be very large. The Soviets are stated to hold such drafts in respect of their 1931 importation of kerosene and benzine, but to be holding them until such time as they can import with less certainty of loss. 6. All Government revenue is collected—one might say snatched—at the earliest moment and remitted to Riyadh. Forced loans on merchants, which were such a feature of the autumn of 1931, have not been in evidence, principally because of the lack of merchants rich enough to afford them, though this method was recently resorted to to pay Mr. Philby for a consignment of tyres. A tendency to impose new taxes, for example, on motor launches and on water- carts, is, however, noticeable. 7. Meantime other Government expenditure is cut down to the barest minimum. Official salaries are even more in arrear than usual; for many months employees were being paid on the principle '' one-third cash, one-third kind, one-third carried forward,' but even this has now been modified to ' all carried.'' Bribing is consequently even easier, cheaper and more prevalent than before. Money is refused for all kinds of necessary and even profitable expenditure; the condenser engineer laments the lack of essential spares, and the piping necessary to supply Jedda with good water is not forthcoming. Even contingency allowances for Government offices have of late been held up. Redemption of debt, in such an atmosphere, seems the height of improbability. 8. The currency position reflects the general situation : the Saudi rial, which a year ago stood at 18^ to the £ gold and two years ago at 17^, is now fluctuating round 26. The value of its silver content is understood to be about 30 and, while at the moment it is showing a slight tendency to rise, as it does each year before the pilgrimage on account of the demand for it created by the arrival of pilgrims, the general opinion is that, after the pilgrimage, it will depreciate to nearly 30. 9. Despite the catalogue of depression in the preceding paragraphs, there is some reason to believe that the regime is in reality far from bankrupt and thaTTts protestations oF poverty are the result of Semitic cupidity and dislike of disbursement, far more than of actual lack of money. The Minister of Finance has been noticed to be far less worried than he might be expected to be and the Royal Family still seem able to afford luxury cars. The money, however, it is agreed, is not in the Hejaz, but where it has been remitted so steadily and so long by the faithful Minister of Finance—Riyadh. 10.

Hostilities, of course, still continue in Najran between certain elements of the Beni Yam and the Imamic forces, the most recent development in that area, according to Fuad Bey Hamza, being the defeat of the Yemenis at Wadi Habuna, south-east of Badr, by a section of the Beni Yam under one Husayn-bin-Jabir (or Jabir-bin- Husayn), and the occupation of the valley by the tribe.
