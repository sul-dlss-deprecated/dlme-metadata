The four-gallon kerosine oil tin is used as a measure of capa city; it is chiefly used for the sale of water, but clarified butter, fat and date syrup are also sometimes sold by the tin. Of the smaller weights^is the habbah . equivalent to 3 grains Troy, used in the sale of gold and silver.. Gold is normally sol by the mithqal »a ttari of 18 habbahs. or 54 grains, and also by the Turkish pound and fractions thereof. Silver is sold by the mithc ; al Shirazi of 24 habbahs. or 72 grains. The mithqal * attar! and the mithoal Shirazi are also both used for drugs and silk thread, but for this purpose they are not divided into habbahs . but only into halves and quarters - the nicities of weight being arrived at by using the two mithqals and their fractions in con junction. Perfumes, as also gold thread, are sold by the tolah of IBQ grains. In the pearl trade the following weights and measures are most commonly used in Kuwait. Wholesale purchases of pearls from the captains of pearling boats are made chiefly by size. For this purpose, after any exceptionally good pearls which it is desirec to dispose of separately have been removed, the remainder are assorted with reference to size by being passed through a eerie of perforated brass or copper bowls, the standard set of which consists of four; the perforations of the largest, called ras . are *18 inch in diameter; those of the second, batn. *15 inch; those of the third, dhail. '13 inch; and those of the fourth, rabi* ah . *11 inch. After being assorted into ras. batn. etc., they change hands at a previously arranged rate, at so much the mi thgSl * Arab 1 , which is equivalent to 450''grains. The ordinary pearl then usually passes from one dealer to another on a more precise kind of estimate based upon weight; in Kuwait the Bombay mithqal ; equivalent to 75 grains Troy, and subdivided into 24ratfrls each of 16 analis . is usually employed. The unit in the dealer's system is called a chau. and, although derived from a weight, it is not in itself a weight. SBhe number of chaus in a pearl is found by squaring the -weight of the pearl in nlthcals \ and multiplying, the result by 330. The chau is divisible into . s 100 ddkrahs . and the. dukrah into 10 o adams . There are cither kind of chaus also occasionally used, and obtained by an identical S process- from other mitiyials f such as the Poona ni . trnal of 68 i grains. The normal unit of length is the d hlra* or cubit of 19 inches, but for rope, which is also sold by v/eight, the ba* or fathom is-usually employed. There is no square measure in use; and a plot of ground is described as being so many dhlra* s. according to the sum df its sides. J7 irTBODUCTIOH tsT - jj The year under review was unfavourable w trade,owing to the strained relations which existed between the Shaikh ^ of Kuwait and the Ruler of Najd, as a result of which all trade with Central Arabia was entirely suspended throughout the greate part of the year, and a feeling of great insecurity existed in Kuwait town itself,which was not conducive to commercial enter- prise. Peace was re-established with ITajd in March, but there not time for its effect to be appreciably felt before the close of the year..The pearling season, on which the prosperity of a large number of the inhabitants of Kuwait depends, was not a successful one, the number of Kuwait boats visiting the fishery was small,'and, owing to the state of insecurity mentioned above I the fleet was not allowed to go so far afield as usual,consequenj ■ tly the catch was small. In addition to this the prices realised] for pearls was not high. The figures given in JcMx 8 are iio real criterion of the amount of pearls exported, as compared with other years, as they only show those exported by steamer, no figures being available for the large number exported by (S dpCctt G* &amp; £ sailing craft ,on 6 i’JOTyr-sx p o'RT . 6 The total imports by sea amounted to £ F-6 , and the exports .

Of the export trade 38'? per t^Q S cent was with Persia, 25^8 per cent with India, 25*2 witn ‘iraQ. and 10*o per cent with the Arab coast. The export per-centage % for Persia was much above the average, doubtless owing to the deflection to that country of a considerable amount of goods which would.normally have found their way to Central Arabia.

Besides float- and-weight nets and lines, traps or tidal weirs,constructed of reed hurdles, are also employed;the fish enter them with the /X/ flowing tide and are left behind at the ebb.The majority of the fish caught is consumed locally, but a small proportion is dried| and exported to Basrah and elsewhere. / &lt; ^ • fTJT^TTT '''TT’Vtf / -l 1 Ti-VX W W ^li. U - «. V Neither Kuwait nor its environs^can boast any agricultural resources. There are no date plantations, no fields-and not manyj kitchen gardens. A few small villages to the south east of Ivuwaij supply a limited guahtity of vegetables and melons.

The above crops are mostly irrigated, but a small amount of wheat and barley is grown by rainfall alone. The agriculture of Jahrah might be considerably increased if Bicre money were sunk in it. The next most important agricultural centre is the island of Failakah ut- tho to*TdcvT:iiu 5^ where wheat and barley are grown with some success on the clayey patches, also melons, lucem and some vegetables. There are some »' date trees towards the south of the island^but they are not in a flourishing condition, and the agriculture of the island generally is inferior to that of.jahrah. Except in the island of Faikakah, less cultivation was done than usual,, owing to the unsettled state of the country, and the village of Jahrah was entirely evacuated for several weeks in the autumn. * MIlvEibiLo . The only mineral product worked is gypsufn mortar, which is manuf factored by the simple process of firing rubbish in broad shallow excavations.

The capital itself has a population of a little over 50,000 souls of whom the great majority are Arab s« The Persian community, however, has greatly increased in recent years and now consists of about 10,000. There are over 4,OQQ negroes and a few Jews* Outside the capital the✓inhabitants of the principality are. all Arabs and are mostly nomads, the only peSaanently settled villages being Jahrah, Which is situated near the foot of Kuwait Bay, about two miles inland, and dista' twenty miles by road from Kuwait town and has a population of about five hundred souls; Zcr, with a similar population, o n tiie island of Failakah at the entrance to Kuwait Bay, and the ft IA 'Trt flK—, snail villages of Hawaii, Hirohah, Fan^a«, AHu Hula if all, HulaiHil and Shu’afbah, all to the south and south-east of Kuwait. ^ ' ^OlaiSTIC Al'IliALS. The most valuable domestic- animals are camels, of whioh there are large numbers, sheep, goats and donkeys; of the latter many of a large white breed, originally from Itasa, are found in the town; theses are sometimes over thirteen hands in height, and a good one will sometimes fetch over £45. There are also some horned cattle and horses e /3 n? rxioi'n.
