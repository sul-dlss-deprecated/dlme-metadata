An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 160-162; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled. A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out. There are a large number of fold-outs as many of the folios are A3 in size and have been filed in a way which means they must be folded out to be viewed.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains proclamations and public notices issued by the Government of Bahrain.
