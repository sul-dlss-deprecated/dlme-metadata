Kemball reports that none of the Sheikhs of the region (Ra's al-Khaymah, Ajman, Umm Al-Qaiwain and Abu Dhabi) have been to see him, as all have been attending to Abdullah bin Faisal at Al Buraimi. Kemball writes that he believes Sultan bin Saqr of Ra's al-Khaymah has been agitating Abdullah bin Faisal to invade the Imam of Muscat's districts, and that by aligning himself to the Wahhabi leader, he will gain supremacy over the 'minor chiefs' of Umm Al-Qaiwain and Ajman.The letter includes a number of enclosures:1. The translated substance of a letter (folio 115) from Abdullah bin Fysul [Faisal], son of the Wahabee Ameer [Wahhabi Emir] and chief of the expedition from Nedjd [Najd] to Brymee [al Buraimi], dated 25 March 1853;2. The translated substance of a letter (folio 116) from Sheikh Sultan bin Suggur [Sultan bin Saqr], Joasmee [Qasimi] chief, to Kemball, dated 25 March 1853;3. The translated substance of a letter (folio 117) from Kemball to Abdullah bin Faisal, dated 30 March 1853;4.
