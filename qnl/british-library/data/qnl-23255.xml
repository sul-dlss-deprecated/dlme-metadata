His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, The Agency, BAHREIN ISLAND. $¥ © A.P.O. MAIL Dear Sir, With reference to our conversation of 8th October, 1944, the Company as well as C.C. Bechtel McCone and the employees of both Companies have been using the Army Post Tor mail to and from the United States and Canada. The use of the army facilities was offered and accepted approximately eighteen months ago because of the saving in time over regular mail service. It is believed that the saving in time is still large and accordingly, the Companies wish to continue to use the Army Post Office for both their own and their employees’ mail, provided the facilities are continued, until regular mail service again becomes normal. our use of the A.P.O. has been raised by Major Estes of the Persian Gulf Command and in order to answer Major Estes, there are certain points on which I will appreciate your advice. These are: regular internal United States rates are charged and United' States stamps are used, such stamps being obtainable from the A.P.O. Since it may possibly be considered that the use by the Companies and their employees of this service results in a loss of revenue by the Bahrein Post Office, I will appreciate your advice if there is any objection to our continued use of this service. for transmittal. The size of package accepted and the method of forwarding depends upon the availability of space at any given time. Normally, the Army forwards packages of one pound and under by air and packages over one pound by sea mail. However, under present operating conditions all packages are being for warded by air. The question of any claims which might result from (1) For all mail handled by the Army Post Office, (2) In addition to letters, the Army accepts packages We desire to continue to use the A.P.O. service for our employees in the forwarding of packages, not only because2 October 17, 1944. of the shorter time involved but because experience has shown that parcels forwarded by regular mail have been subjected to a large amount of pilferage. It is our understanding that under defence regula tions, all goods of non-Bahrein origin exported require an export permit. I will appreciate your advice as to whether you will require application for export permit on all packages wnich may contain goods of non-Bahrein origin or whether the permit*on certain items or size of package may be waived. It is my opinion that virtually all of the packages contain sou venirs, bric-a-brac, rugs, etc., from this area. (3) Incoming packages as well as the mail have been coming directly from the Army Post Office at Muharraq to Awali without customs examination. The volume and size of these packages has been relatively small and the packages usually contain^ clothing and other personal effects which are in short supply in Bahrein. The subject of customs examination has been discussed with Mr. G.W.R. Smith and he is of the opinion t/iat since the volume is small and it may be expected that availability of A.P.O. service will end within a reasonable length of time, no appreciable loss in customs revenue will result in our continuation of the present practice. I will appreciate your advice that there is no objection to our con- inuation of tne present method of handling incoming packages. Yours very truly, For W.P. AKD2RS0N Chief Local Representative THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LTD.No.C/1520. Political Agency, Bahrain, 29th October 1944. proa The Political Agent Bahrain. To The Hon'ble the political Resident in the Persian Gul.?, Camp Bahrain. Sir I have the honour to refer to my predecessor's letter No.C/484 dated April 7th 1943 and to enclose a copy of a letter addressed tc me by the Chief Local Representative of the Bahrain Petroleum Company on the subject of the carriage of mails to anl from America. 2. The time taken for a letter to reach the TT.S.A. by American Array Post is a matter of days while the time taken through the Government of India Post Office is a natter of weeks if not months. I consider it would be very unwise to insist on all letters passing through the Bahrain Post Office for the delay in receiving lecters would have a very serious effect on the morale of the American workmen in particular those employed on the hundred octane plant construction. It is of course impossible to estimate the loss In revenue caused to the Post Office but It cannot be very considerable and therefore I suggest that the present procedure with regard to letters be permitted to continue until the termination of host!- lities. 3. I can see no satisfactory reason why large packages should be sent by air mail ami propose to inform the Chief Local Repre sentative that whatever space may be available a slight limi tation of one pound must be strictly Imposed. This will allow for the sending of souvenirs to relatives in the States and wil/ effectively prevent the export of prohibited articles except In negligible quantities.4. The last paragraph of the Chief Local Representative^ letter under reference raises two points. Firstly the question of censorship of letters and packets and secondly the customs examination of packets. I have discussed the question of customs examination with the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and the Chief Local Representative at my suggestion raised the question with the Director of Customs with the result stated in his letter. I suggest that if the Bahrain Government are satisfied that there is no need for us to take exception to the present proce dure, as regards the question of censorship I feel that the let ters which travel through American Army channels are adequately censored and that there is no need to insist on a further exami nation here ; in fact it would not be advisable from a political point of view. I advise that the whole procedure now in force be permit ted to continue except that air postal packets should have a weight limitation imposed of one pound. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Agent, Bahrain.•/ ' k \V Dhahran, Saudi Arabia November 2, 1944 His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, The Agency, B&amp;hrein Island Dear Sir: The Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd., have kindly foiy^rded to us for our inforr.ation a cony of their lett er to you Ho. C/HA-T&lt; i 0 f October l r ~, on the above subject. Hith the express permission of the Saudi Arab Government, this Company has also taken advantage of the opportunity arforded by the A.P.O. mail service to obtain prompt and regular communication between ourselves and the United States. The service is of great value to both the Company and our American employees and we naturally hope it will continue to be available to us until regular airmail service nas become re-established. Our A.P.O. mail is disoatchod in Company launches to Hr, hodstrom in anama and by him is turned over directly to the Army Post Office at I Juharraq. As the Bahrein Post Office is in no • ay involved in the handling or transmission of the mail we assume that there is no objection on the part of the Bahrein Government to the practice which we are following and that there is no appreciable loss in revenue involved. However, we feel that we should acruaint you fully of wnat we are doing. Because of various complications involved, we have not undertaken to handle outgoing marcels post packages for our employees via the A.P.Q service. He may do so later but if so we will be pleased to advise you to that effect. If there is any objection to the tr sins miss ion of A.P.O. mail through Bahrein as described above or if there are any points on which you desire more complete information, \ ill you kindly let us know.

The position is most irregular but we cannot make Americans pay for a service they do not use, and it is not anticipated that the loss in revenue to the Indian Postal administration will be considerable. A limitation of one pound might, however, be imposed on all parcels sent through United States Military Authorities. I understand most of the parcels sent contain souvenirs for relatives in the States and the irapoyition of this limitation while preventing the export of prohibited articles except in negligible quantities would still allow such souvenirs to be sent. 4. The Eastern Gulf Oil Company, who have a number of American employees at Kuwait, have now applied to the Political Agent, Kuwait, for similar facilities in respect of their office and staff mail. As similar consider#tions apply, and we cannot deny to this company the facilities accorded to the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the Arabian American Oil Company, I have instructed the Political Agent, Kuwait, th n t the facilities requested can be accorded subject to the following provisos: (a) that it will cease when mail services are restored to normal. (b) that parcels are to be limited to one pound in weight, and (c) that the mail should be posted from Kuwait to Brsra in an outer cover or bag through the Kuwait post office. (d) that any local censorship rules in force should be complied with. (c) will ensure that the Indian Post Office at Kuwait loses no revenue, and we are in a position at Kuwait to insist on this proviso as, unlike at Bahrain, there Is no United States Army Post Office at Kuwait. 5. I should be grateful for a reply by telegram on the suggestion made in paragraph 3 above for the limitation on weight of parcels. 3d/- GEOFFREY PRIOR Political Resident, Persian Gulf.

My comments are as follows. 2* Employees of Oil Companies are engaged in work vital to w^r effort under difficult conditions and extension to them of facilities enjoyed by United States Army Forces seems desirable. Army Postal service can deliver letters to U.S.A. in as many days as Indian Post office takes weeks. 3. Both Companies have asked for concession only until mall services become normal and it has been made clear to them that it will cease when regular services are resumed. 4 . There is little likelihood that argument of convenience and speed in transmission as between British and / American air services would continue to apply in post-war period. 5. Americans are unlikely to ask for continuance of similar exceptional arrangements since it would then be impossible for them to refuse similar concession to us anywhere else. 6. Legal position i s in our favour as Indian Post Office has monopoly at both Bahrain and Kuwait and Section 4 of Indian Post Office Act of 1898 applied under Order-in- Council prohibits operation of any other postal service at both places.

Reference correspondence ending with my Printed Letter No. C/879, dated the 15th September, 1945, regarding the United States Army post Office facilities for American employees of Bapco and Aramco. Anderson spoke to me today on this subject and said that he thought A.P.O. facilities would be no longer available for his employees in this area after another month or so; and that he considered equivalent facilities were essential in order to avoid discontent amongst Bapco employees — an opinion with which I generally agree. He asked me to do what I could to obtain such facilities. He added that the only alternative to A.P.O. at the moment was to send letters to the united States of America via Lagos and test letters had established that they took about two weeks or so to reach the United States. Since letters sent from here to England and vice versa take only 4 or 5 days, he thought that to send letters to the United States via England would be the quickest route. 2. • I should be grateful if the Government of India could be asked to arrange through the Indian posts and Telegraphs Department for the expeditious carriage of mails from here to the United States and if I could be informed whether this can be done. 3. I also gathered from Anderson, and in respect of the retwrn service it would seem obvious, that the co-operation of the American postal Authorities would also be required.

The alternative route via U.K. requires Rs.2-0-6 per half ounce and ’is taking according to our records, 15 to 20 days. (I was mistaken in the information I gave the other day. I quoted a rate of Rs. 2-11-6, whereas the correct- 3 * 3^6 is Rs. 2-0-6 as above.) The A.P.O. rate of 6 cents is obviously heavily subsidized and we cannot hope for such a low rate after A.P.O. closes finally in a few months time. The rate of Rs. 2-0-6 is a bit steep but it would not be too bad if the time was good, say 4-6 days. It is to be hoped that this rate will come down considerably and the time of delivery materially improved as conditions re turn to normal.

The Bahrain A.P.O. facilities to the United States of America have terminated and were due to terminate on the mainland also, but due to ARALiCO representations they have been restored at Dhahran. They will probably terminate there in two or three months* time when mails will probably be carried by an American civil air-line. 3. The Chief Local Representative now requests to be allowed to send BAPCO U.S.A. mail ton the same con ditions as before to the mainland for despatch to the United States of America by A.P.O. as a temporary measure and for so long as the facility continues. Reasons given for requesting an extension are that the British air mail service is not yet normal, and that the effect on the morale of his American employees vis-a-vis their compatriots at Dhahran will be bad if they have to use our facilities involving a longer delivery period of about two weeks and at a cost of Rs.2.0.6 for an £ ounce against 6 cents (3 annas). The rate is probably a subsidised one. 4. The following are my comments:- (a) Bad effect on morale:- I do not think we need by unduly concerned provided we can give a speedy efficient service. Unfortunately at present delays occur. Even to England letters often take up to 10 days, and a week is exceptional. As regards the Bahrain post Office please see my Memo- randum No.67-14/3,&gt;. dated the 8th January, 1946. (b) High Rate:- ^The British rate seems high and I suggest the possibilities of a reduction be considered. (c) BAPCO*s U.S.A. mail is being sent abroad for posting:- The mail could be dispatched by ARAMCO under their complicated system with the Saudi Government and treated as their mail. Excluding consideration of loss of postal revenue to the Government of India post Office, I think the procedure would be objectionable and if once started it might be difficult to retrieve the position. I, therefore, am unable to recommend it even for a period of two months. It seems certain, however, that ARAMCO mails will be carried from Dhahran by an American Line and it may not be possible in the long run to prevent /BAPCO * sBAPCO* s using it. The next step will probably be a suggestion for the initiation of a postal service between here and Dhahran, but we may wait, I suggest, for BAPCO to raise the question. 5. As considerable delay does occur in transport, I suggest the cause of these delays be investigated in the United Kingdom and Cairo with a view to their removal. 6. I should be grateful for instructions as to what reply I may return to the Chief Local Representative. ATTESTED . Sd./- A.C. GALLCWAY Political Agent, Bahrain. for Assistant political Agent, Bahrain.

MAILING FACILITIES FOB BAPCO EMPLOYEES File 009.351 Dear Sir:. ^ Please refer to my letter PA-21^ dated 29th December, 194-5, in the above connection. You will remember our discussion on the further use of A.P.O. facilities by employees of this Company which in volved permission to send mail from here to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, for onforwarding by the A.P.O. facilities there. It is my understanding that you were going to develop this matter and advise further. Our employees seem to have become reconciled to the use of the regular mailing facilities now available, and also the time of delivery via the United Kingdom has improved some what recently. In view of this, and also in view of the fact that even if arrangements could be made at this date to send mail to Dhahran for oncarriage by A.P.O., such arrangements would last only for a very short period before the Army Post Office there was finally liquidated, it is my feeling it hardly would be worth-while to pursue the matter further. The Company appreciates any efforts you may have made in this connection.

I duly referred the matter to my higher authority, but have received no reply to date. As you say, circum stances have overtaken us and I am asking for the matter to be dropped. 3. As regards rates and delay in transit, these points I also put up and hope to be able to give you a favourable reply in a short time. X 4.

The fact remains, however, that postal air facilities from Bahrain to the U.S.A. are comparatively Both slow and expensive, and if we wish to avoid loss to the British interests mentioned above by the Company s adoption of a device such as that mentioned in paragraph 3 of my reply to the Political Agent, Bahrain, urgent measures are called for to afford a speedier and cheaper air mail sergice between Bahrain and the U.S*A« 3d.

Position is that ©11 air mails from India, and similarly from Bahrain, for ths United States of America are for^rded via united Kingdom, which is the most expeditious civil air route available for the purpose. This route was adopted in October 1945 in preference to the former route via West Africa, ©s Service on thr*t route was found to be irregular and mails were subjected to delay. Since thg adoption of the route via united Kingdom, the transit time has been considerably shortened, the average in respect of air mails despatched from ferachi during November and December 1945 being 10 days# The importance of maintaining a speedy service between India end United States of America has already been streesed upon the British Post Office (London) and it is hoped tlvt they will take all practicable steps to secure the greatest possible expedition. It should* however* be mentioned that the transit time by a civil air service can in no case compare favourably with that taken by military &amp;&amp; planes# 3# As regards charges, these were also substantially reduced (by 11 annas per % oz#) In October lest when the United Kingdom route was adopted# Such charges are fixed on the b©sis of payments re$ul*ed to be made to for sign Administrations for the conveyance of mails by their air services and it is regretted that no further reduction in tb* existing rates can be effected at present. The rate of 3 annas, referred to in the politicrl Agent, Bahraini letter of 8th January 1946 seemes to be a highly subsidised one, and Dionne 1 civil rates from India can never compare with it. Sven for surface postage the rate from India to UnitedNstates of America is 3^ annas for the first ounce.

Mr. Anderson spoke to me about this today and he is confident that he can get them back from the American Army authorities for his own employees, but he says that he thinks the privileges will be withdrawn in a month or so, and he is most anxious that a good postal service should be available to America for his employees after that. He states that,at present, letters to America go via Lagos and take a considerable time but that, if they were sent via England, they ought to reach the United States within a week or 10 days.

Sub-postmaster tells me he receives bags addressed to him (15 up-to date) - civilian mail - his brother, an employee of Bapco, collects them at ttuharraq and brings to the P.0. Outward mails from Bahrain do nop go through P.0. He wants to know what arrangements should be made to collect and deliver mails for the U.S.A.T.C. e.g. contract. 2. Sub-postmaster also tells me that letters for the U.S.A. do not have Bahrain stamps affixed - but have U.S.A. stamps, are put in a sealed bag and do not go through the P.0, at all. / i think this contravenes the international Postal Convention (I don't know the correct name). t.7.

Arrangement seems at first sight to bring no revenue to Bahrain Post Office as U.S.A. inland revenue stamps are being used on Oil Companies’ mail, vide A.P.A.’s note at page 5 of note sheets, and we might reply that the two (Dil Companies should ma£e arrangements direct with the U.S.A.T#C. for the collection and delivery of their mail. But from query regarding wia weight of mail bags in enclosure to p.u.c# it seems that Indian Postal Authorities are going to collect revenue on these bags and P.M. Bahrain will have to arrange for their collection and delivery to U»S*A*T#C# We m ^y therefore suggest to P.M. that contract between him and U.S.A.T.C. should stipulate collection and delivery of mail by U.S.A.T.C. from P.0. Manama. There should be no difficulty regarding the collection and delivery of mail bags between P.0, and Oil Companies as Aramco office is close to P.0, and Bapco run a bus service which passes it several times a day.

I think point has still to be cleared up with Post Master of whether Posta- Authorities are getting any revenue out of arrangement, and how much? If Post Master engages an outside contractor to collect and deliver mails to U.S.A.T.C. it is going to cost quite a lot. P.A. 10/11/45.
