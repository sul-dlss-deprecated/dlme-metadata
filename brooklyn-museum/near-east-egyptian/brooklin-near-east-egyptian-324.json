Ptolemy II Philadelphos, like his father Ptolemy I Soter, the founder of the dynasty, continued the practice of building and decorating temples in traditional Egyptian fashion. </p>\r\n<p>While this is not to say that the Macedonian rulers did not have Greek artists portray them according to Greek artistic conventions, here the Greek ruler is shown in a purely Egyptian guise, wearing the traditional <i>nemes</i>-headdress of the pharaoh. The style of the relief, including the deeply cut navel, the horizontal treatment of the torso muscles, the \"golf ball\" chin, and the upturned smile, is common in representations from Dynasties XXIX and XXX (circa 399\u2013342 <span style=\"font-size: smaller;\">B.C.</span>) and was readily adopted by the \r\nPtolemies into their iconographic program.
