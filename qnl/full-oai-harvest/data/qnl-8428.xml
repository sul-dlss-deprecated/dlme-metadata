The file begins in 1931 with an objection from the Persian Government of the flying of a British flag (the Red Ensign) at buildings in Persian territory, operated by the Imperial and International Communications Company. Subsequent correspondence discusses:The question of whether the Imperial and International Communications Company is entitled, as a private concern, to fly the national flag.The significance to the Persian authorities of flag staffs as claims of territorial sovereignty.Instructions issued to British consular properties in Persia in 1932 to remove flag staffs from their grounds, and to instead fly their flags from the roof of consular buildings.National holidays on which foreign missions and consulates might fly their flags in Persia, with a list of dates on folio 78.Reciprocal measures, imposed by the Government of India, limiting the flying of flags by Persian officials in India.The file’s principal correspondents are: the British Legation at Tehran (Major Percy Charles Russell Dodd, Reginald Hervey Hoare; Hughe Montgomery Knatchbull Hugesson); the Foreign Office (George William Rendel, Lacy Baggallay); the India Office (Charles William Baxter); the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Vincent Biscoe; Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard William Craven Fowle).The file contains a small number of items written in French.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Cable and Wireless Ltd</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bandar Abbas</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Henjam</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial flags</topic></subject><subject><topic>Bilateral relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Embassies and consulates</topic></subject><subject><topic>Public holidays</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0003d9#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0003d9#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0003d9#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
