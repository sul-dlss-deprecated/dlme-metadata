I‘AMLAH. Ori{&lt;inally a Lur tribe of the Pusht-i-Kuk that tied from the Wall ahuui 100 years ago and settled at Shush, where they have since remained, they cultivate wheat, rice, and barley on lands, which they leased fr^*^ the Shaikh of Muhammerah. During the war both chiefs, (ihuiam Reza Khan and Saifullah Khan, icmlered much assistance to the British and were in receipt of a subsidy. ior some time past Khallaf ibn Shinaiyir, agent of the Shaikh of Muhaai- merah in the Mianab, has coveted these lands occupied by the *Amlah tribe, and in January, J92»‘i be succeeded in persuading the Shaikh of Muhammerah to write to (jhulam Reza Khan explaining that his lease had expired and that he must remove his tribe, (ihuiam Reza Khan refused, and in March troops were sent against him by the Shaikh under the command of Abdul Hamid, his second son and Deputy Governor of Ahwaz. The attack was successful, (ihuiam Reza Khan being defeated and harassed on his retreat by the Sagwand tribe, which fact provides a further instance of the lack of cohesion amongst the Lur tribes. Ghulam Reza Khan and Saifullah Khan are now living with the ( hena- nah section of the Bani Lam, and though safe conduct and a promise of settle ment on other lands has been offered by the Shaikh of Muhammerah, it is more probably that the two chiefs will return to the territory of the Wali of Rusht-i-Kuh, to whom they are related. The tribesmen still reside on their own lands and are more or less controlled by the Shaikh’s agent Khallaf.‘ANAFIJAH. An Arab tribe, said to be related to A1 Kathir, once powerful and of primary importance in Southern ‘Arabistan, but now greatly diminished in numbers, and associated with the Bait Sa'ad of Al Kathir. The former boundary of the ‘Anatijah tribe ran along the right bank of the Shatait river from its confluence with the river l)iz to a little above Chahar Dingeh; thence it crossed to Kut Bandar on to the river J)iz, and. passing by Khair- abad on the Shaur to the left bank of the river Karkheh, followed the Karkheh to a point some ten miles above Nahr Hashim; from this point it ran to Khar Ishtireh opposite Aliwaz, and then kept along the right bank of the Karim to the mouth of the river Diz. The ‘Anatijah are now almost confined to the right bank of the Karun between Band-i-Qir and Wais with a few scattered in the Mianab. The tribe is politically allied to the Hamaid, who would follow them in war. It is controlled by the Shaikh of Muhammarah through his agent Khalaf ibn Shinaiyir.The Lur tribes, which encamp on the plains of Northern ‘Arabistan during the winter months, are all of this confederation, which numerically is the strongest of the four principal divisions of the Lurs. Their general policy, however, is not of a very advanced type, and its striking features are a more or less unremitting feud on the part of some of its branches with the Persian Government, general acts of hostility against each other, and strained relations with the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh. An example of the lack of cohesion between these tribes was given during the war, when the Sagwand were successfully raided by British troops in 1916 and finally driven out of the Dizful neighbourhood by the Bahrawand. With the exception of the Sagwand tribe, which is recorded separately, the Arabs of ‘Arabistan rarely come into contact with the Lurs; this is fortunate, as their life is a constant repetition of forays and raids, thieving and broken bonds. No better description of a Lur can be given than that he is an adroit and incurable thief. The little that is known about these tribes is mentioned in the tribal lists against each tribe separately; the tribesmen are poor fighters, but adept raiders. Serious and combined opposition need not be ever expected, from this quarter.A once powerful tribe of the southern province of ‘Arabistan that has been broken by the Shaikh of Muhammarah and is now completely under his control. Owing to their proximity to Ahwaz the tribe recognises the Shaikh’s representative. Shaikh Abdul Jiamid, at that place as their chief and revenue is paid direct to him by the minor Shaikhs of the tribe. During the war in 1915 the Bawieh were affected by the jihad preached at the instigation of the Turks and seriously impeded our advance against the Turks by cutting the pipe liue and thus causing us to retain more troops on the Kanin than would otherwise have been necessary. At this time in conjunction with the Cha'b the Bawieh intended to attack Nasiri; the ( ha‘b however, tailed to come up to the scratch, and the Bawieh, who came in contact with the Shaikh's troops at Nasiri were compelled to retire. The result of this reverse was that the Bawieh made their submission to the Shaikh of Muhammarah and arrangements were immediately set on foot for the payment of allowances to the tribe for the protection of the pipe line through their territory. In September of 1915 a subsidy of £1,000 was sanctioned for the Bawieh, who for this sum agreed to guard their length of the pipe line. In the same month British troops were sent to garrison Band-i-Qir, when nearly all the Bawieh Chiefs turned out to welcome the column and accompany it to its destination. Owing to lack of water in 1921 the tribe was reduced to poverty and compelled to sell rifles and animals in order to live. The Bawieh claims descent from the Arab he.ro, Muhalhal, and &lt;ler their ancestry superior to that of the Cha‘b. const-A‘B (AL GUBBAN). A numerous ami once powerful tribe, vvhi(jh immigrated to Southern ‘Arabistan at the end of the 16th or beginning of the 17th century. At the time of their arrival ‘Arabistan was a subject of dispute between Teheran and Constantinople, as to whether the southern province should or should not form part of the dominions of the Shah. The Cha‘b had previously been subject to Ottoman rule; they had* however, no preference for cither, but when they spread eastwards they found themselves obliged to pay tribute to the Shah. For the next two centuries the Cha‘b committed acts of piracy with impunity, though naval operations were repeatedly attempted against them by the East India Company* but without success. In the beginning of the 19th century a rival to the Cha'b in the Muhaisin appeared, who determined to throw off the yoke of the Cha‘b, to whom it was sub ject, but it was not till 1898 that the Cha‘b shaikhdom was finally extin guished and the Muhaisin inherited their possessions from the Karun to Hindian. In the early days of the war in 1915 the Cha‘b were affected by the- jihad preached at the instigation of the Turks. They took no active part against our troops, but their attitude was decidedly rebellious and they actually made an agreement to join the Bawieh in an attack on Nasiri; in this, however, they failed the Bawieh at. the last moment. Of the four main tribes that were hostile to the British, namely, the Cha‘b, Bawieh, Bani Tamim and Bani Turuf, the Cha b held out longest and for that reason the Shaikh of Muhammarah sent a force of 3,000 Muhaisin to attack them; the Cha'b were defeated and caused no further trouble during the- war. The action took place on the 5th June, 1915, at the village of Umm-as- Sakhar. where the Cha'b were collected in force and defeated within four- hours. In the event of possible future expeditions against the Cha'b it is worthy of note that the canal system furnishes the key to the topography of the Fallahiyah district, and that canals which it is desired to close are quickly and effectively dammed at their heads with earth and brushwood. In addition the Jarrahi river forms the main artery of inland communi cation by water, and boats of considerable size can navigate to the upper most limits of the Fallahiyah district, and even beyond, from the Persian Gulf by the port of Buzieh and the Khor Musa* though the Jarrahi is not connected by a navigable waterway to either. The Jarrahi, however, is the principal means of communication between Muhanmiarah and Falla hiyah, being joined to the Karun at Marid by the Fallahiyah-Marid canal. About 300 ballams are said to have their headquarters at Fallahiyah town. The tribe is divided into three main divisions Dris or 'Asachrah, Albu Ghubaish and Khanafarah. Though Dris and Albu Ghubaish are under two separate chiefs, they invariably tight under one ffag. The tribesmen cannot be described as altogether, settled, nor are they wholly nomadic. Where they own arable lands, they cultivate wheat, barley and rice; they also own buffaloes, cattle, sheep and even donkeys; there are numerous date groves along the banks of the canals, which they cultivate, whilst in the marshes they move about in canoes fishing and shooting wild fowl. The tribe is under the control of the Shaikh of Muhammarah, who- collects revenue through their chief Shaikh, ‘Abud ibn Dhuwaiyib.DAGHAGHLEH. Previously an Arab nomadic tribe living in tents on the Karkheh and tributory to Hawizah. Later it was known as a section of the ‘Ana- fijah till a short time back, when the Shaikh of Muhammarah ordered the tribe to settle at Mubatihah. and sever their connection with the ‘Anafijah. The tribe# which is actually under the Shaikh’s agent, Khalaf ibn Shinaiwir, would follow the ‘Anafijah in war, whilst that tribe in its turn would support the A1 Kathir.BAN1 HARDAN. A small tribe that has settled on the right bank of the Kanin above Aminiyah. The tribe has fallen on hard times and is of little or no import ance. It is controlled by the Shaikh of Muhammarah.TRIBES or HINDI AN, ZAITAN, BANDAR MA’SHUR AND JARRAHI DISTRICTS. With t,h« exception of half the Jarrahi district, which is inhabited by part of the vast Cha'b tribe, these four districts are comprised of sec tions of tribes, Lurs, Persians and Arabs, who for various reasons have wandered from their own lands and settled in these south-eastern districts of ‘Arabistan. Seeing that they have long deserted their main tribes or confederations, and attached themselves to the Shaikh of Muhammarah, to whose authority they submit and to whom they pay their revenue, they are included in this report as tribes of the district**, in wdiich they reside, and indexed as such, the district taking the place in the index of the main tribe or confederation. Such details as are known of their origin are mentioned in the remarks column of the tribal lists against each tribe separately. Each district is under the control of one of the Shaikh of Muhamma rah’s agents, who is responsible generally for law and order and the col lection of revenue. At the present time (1923), the Shaikh is represented as follows:— Hindian. Z.iitan. By ‘Agha ‘Abdi al S.unur. Lives at Hindiau Town. By Mir Abdullah. Lives at Suwairch. Bandar Ma'slmr. By Ahmad ibn Sulaiyah. Lives at Ma shur. I Jarrahi. oy Mir Cholaii. Lives at Khalalabad. Zaitan is in reality no more than a plain dividing Hindian from Behbhan and forming part of Hindian district. It is however sometimes considered a separate district and is now ruled by Mir Abdullah, who was previously the Shaikh’s agent for Hindian, but was removed by the Shaikh for failing to collect sufficient revenue. It is understood that in actual fact ‘Agha ‘Abdi is the Shaikh’s representative of both Hindian and Zaitan but that Mir Abdullah still continues to control the tribes from Deh Mullah to Zaitan, whilst ‘Agha ‘Abdi holds himself responsible for those between Deh Mullah and the sea. Fighting in these parts is not a common occurrence, but about 25 years ago, when Mir Fadhl a powerful Chief of the Shuraifat, was to all intents and purposes Chief of the Hindian district, he incurred the jealousy of Shaikh Khaz'aL, who bribed the Bakhtiari to attack him, the result of which was that Mir Fadhl was killed. Mir Abdullah w^as appointed by the Shaikh to succeed him, but some 10 years ago he was attacked and driven out by Mir ‘Ali and Mir Jabir, the sons of Mir Fadhl. Mir Abdullah tied to Bandar Dilam and for the next two years the district w^as ruled by Mir Fadhl’s sons. Shaikh Khaz'al, however, then despatched Mullah ‘Abdul Saiyid from Ahwaz with troops and guns to attack Mir ‘Ali and Mir Jabir, who were compelled to flee to the Jarrahi district. Mir Abdullah was reinstated by the Shaikh. Mir Jabir now controls the Qanawati sec tions in the Jarrahi district, whilst his brother lives in retirement in the same district. Of other hostilities entered upon by these tribes it is recorded that all to a man joined the Shaikh in his attack on the Bani Turuf about 3 years before the war. It is said that they have an undying hatred for the Bani Turuf and would at all times support the Shaikh against the Bani Turuf, if called upon to do so. The tribes are moderately contented and are particularly satisfied with the appointment of ‘Agha “Abdi, preferring him to Mir Abdullah. They are not overtaxed, though they claim that higher revenue is demanded from them annually.AL KATHIR (CHATHIR). An important Arab tribe of Northern ‘Arabistan, which inhabits the country between the Shatait branch of the Kanin and the Karkheh. Owing to the fact that in addition to these rivers the Gargar, the Diz and the Shaur run through their lands, cultivation is good and cattle and buffaloes plentiful. The tribe was originally divided into two Baits, Bait Sa‘ad under Shaikh Parhan al ‘Asad and Bait Karim under Shaikh Haidar ibn ‘AH. These two Baits were frequently considered as separate tribes. Whether this was or was not the case, the two Shaikhs undoubtedly controlled the policy of Northern ‘Arabistan. Since their exile the two Baits have been brought under the power of the Shaikh of Muhammarah and are ruled as one tribe by his agent, Khalaf ibn Shinaiyir. Most of the sections of this tribe are offshoots of the Bani Lam, a factor worthy of comment, lest there should ever occur fighting in which the Bani Lam supported one side and the Shaikh of Muhammarah the other. There has always been a long continued antagonism between Shaikhs Parhan and Haidar; this reached a climax in 1904, when Haidar was defeated and plundered. On this occasion Farhan received the support of the Sagwand, but Haidar made relations with that tribe by marriage and was able to count on them for assistance. In 1908 Haidar with the aid of the Sagwand and the moral support of the Shaikh of Muhammarah thoroughly defeated Farhan and regained the support of his Bait, which had largely deserted his cause. In September, 1915, during the war Haidar was not only suspected of secretly instigating raids against Farhan but also of being responsible for cutting the pipe line. Farhan on the other hand appeared to have cast in his lot with the British. In August, 1916, Haidar was attacked by our troops and his camp burnt; he himself however, managed to escape to the Pusht-i-Kuh, since which date he has never returned to the Bait Karim. Khuraibit ibn ‘Ali al Ghafil was appointed shaikh of the tribe in August, 1917, but was subsequently removed and fled in 1922 joining Haidar in the territory of the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh. Farhan remained with Bait Sa‘ad till 1922, when he too was compelled to flee and took refuge with the Bakhtiari at Ab Bid. The two Baits, therefore, have both come under the complete control oi the Shaikh of Muhammarah. In the past the Bait Sa‘ad were responsible for the insecurity of the Dizful-Shushtar road. Bait Sa‘ad is frequently known as A1 Kathir of Shushtar.Families. Armed Men. Rifles.KHAMIS. A1 Kliamis, i.e., sons; of five, is an Arab tribe of little importance in habiting the districts of Itamuz and Fallahiyah. Tbe tribe is under the rule of the Bakhtiari, to whom they pay revenue. About 1840 they migrated to the country between Hawizah and the Karun, but they have since returned to their own lands.BANI LAM. A powerful tribe, which is best known in the ‘Amarah Liwa of ‘Iraq. The tribe claims close relationship with the Bani Turuf, in that both are descended from Hatim Tai of the Hedjaz, famous as the most hospitable man of the ase. The connection is reached as follows:— Hatim. I Nawwar. * I I Turuf. Lam. If this assumption is correct, the two tribes, which lie side by side and have never been under V e complete control of the Shaikh of Muham- marah, are unlikely to be really hostile to one another, and such a powerful combination must not be overlooked, though owing to tribal jealousies, feuds and greed on behalf of the tribes and sections for extension of lands, the two tribes need never be considered seriously as one powerful and combined force. They would, however, in all probability join together, if the occasion arose, in opposition to the Shaikh of Muhammarah. In addition to the sections jis recorded in the subsequent lists a large number of the present tribes of ‘Arabistan are of Bani Lam origin, not ably Cha‘b al Dubais, Cha'b al Sitatlah and other sections of A1 Kathir, Marawunah, Albu Ruwayah and other small tribes, which outwardly have no connection with the Bani Lam. Of the sections mentioned in the lists as Bani Lam the majority are gradually drifting away and being treated as separate tribes. The Chenanah and Khasraj alone retain their close connection with the Bani Lam. and will always create discontent between their Shaikh Ghadhban and the Shaikh of Muhammarah. It is very un likely that any of these tribes and sections of Bani Lam origin would ever take up arms against their own tr be. The Bani Lam, therefore, with its sections spread over Northern ‘Arabistan and the Bani Turuf could form a combined opposition to the Shaikh of Muhammarah, which it would be difficult for him to break; the possibility, however, is improbable. Of the Chiefs, Shaikh Ghadhban al Bunaiyan alone outstands as a leader and a danger to the Shaikh of Muhammarah and his tribe. At present, however, Shaikh Ghadhban s control over the Bani Lam in ‘Arab istan is very doubtful, though during the war he undoubtedly influenced the Chenanah and Khazraj sections in spite of his assertion in 1915 that he had no authority over them. Until quite recency lie was deposed from his tribe but he was reinstated in 1922 and given land in the ‘Amarah district. His sole object, which he openly admits, is to regain his lost sections, the Chenanah and Khazraj. The Shaikh of Muhammarah, how ever, is working against him and presents of money and clothes to the Chiefs are helping towards their throwing in their lot with him. But, as is the case wi'th all tribes, in times of peace they follow the man, who cau give them most, whilst in war if their own tribe is engaged they follow their tribe.MUHA1SIN. A settled tribe of Southern ‘Arabistan, whose Chief is me Shaikh of Muhammarah. Part live in Persian territory and part in ‘Iraq on the banks of the Shatt al ‘Arab., where they are occupied in the cultivation of dates. The whole tribe would undoubtedly follow the Shaikh of Muham- marah, though their peaceful mode of living is gradually depriving them of the wild, restless spirit so characteristic of the Arab tribe and it is doubtful if their support would be of great assistance to the Shaikh, if opposed to tribes who live by the sword or to an organised European force. The tribe is said to be descended from a certain man, Muhaisin, and ids son-in-law Kasib. These individuals, according to tradition, belong to a tribe of the Muhammarah district which was compelled to emigrate by the encroachments of the Cha‘b and settled on the Tigris under the name of Al Hussain Pasha. Kasib and Muhaisin with some followers, having purchased some land in the neighbourhood of the modern Muhammarah from the Cha‘b, eventually returned to settle near the original seat of the tribe, and the headship of the tribe which they founded, remained in the family of Kasib. Haji Yusuf ibn Mardau, a descendant of Chasib, ultimately became Governor of Muhammarah on behalf of the Cha‘b Shaikh and his son. Haji Jabir was Shaikh of Muhammarah when it was occupied by British troops in 1857. After the peace between Britain and Persia, Haji Jabir was made ndependent of the Cha‘b Shaikh by a Persian Prince, the Ihtisham-ud- Dauleh, who governed the province; and after the Cha'b Shaikh had been captured and sent to Teheran, the Fallahiyah district was added to Haji Jabir’s dominions. Constant fighting ensued between the Muhaisin and the ^ha‘b, in which the Dris section of the Cha'b inhabiting the island of ‘Abadan sided with the Muhaisin. In 1860 Zia-ui-Mulk, the Persian Governor of ‘Arabistan., countenanced the Cha'b party, and the result was the seizure and temporary removal of llaji Jabir to Teheran; two years later, however, having been released, he was reinstated with the title cf Nusrat-al-Mulk by Prince Kaj-shnd Mirza, the new Persian Governor. Prom this time onwards the Cha'b Shaikhs have never been entirely free of Muhaisin control. Haji Jabir died in 1881; his successes were largely due to the fighting qualities of his son ‘Isa, w^ho pre-deceased him. Haji Jabir was succeeded by his son Miza'l who, by playing off one pretender to the Shaikhship of Fallahiyah against the other, and putting in first one rival and then another as Shaikh, succeeded in becoming para mount Shaikh of the Muhaisin and Cha'b tribes. The hereditary Wali of Hawizah, who formerly ruled the whole country between the Karun and Tigris, also fell under the power of Miza‘1. Miza‘1 received from the Per sian Government the title of Mu‘izz-ul-Saltanah. He fell a victim in 1897 to a conspiracy organised by his cousin Salman ibn Mansur, to which most of the tribal Shaikhs were privy. Khaz'al, the youngest and only surviving son of Haji Jabir, succeeded his brother. The title of Mu'izz-ul-Saltaneh was continued in his favour, and to it was added the military title of Sardar-i-Aqdas. By this time the Cha'b Shaikhdom was broken up and finally extinguished in 1898. when the Muhaisin inherited the Cha'b possessions from the Karun to Hindian. During the war the Muhaisin may be considered the only tribe in ‘Arabistan that was consistently loyal to the British and the Shaikh of Muhammarah, whose interests were one. In 1915 when a jihad was being preached at the instigation of the Turks and all tribes of ‘Arabistan were in a state of rebellion, the Muhaisin on two occasions went out to fight for the cause of the British and the Shaikh, first against the Bawieh, who had cut the pipe line and secondly against the Cha'b, who, though they had made no active opposition, had adopted an attitude so rebellious that the Shaikh considered it unwise to allow them to remain unpunished. It is possible that he feared lest the old rivalry between the Cha'b and Muhaisin would recur and that if the Cha'b received assistance from the Bawieh, whose attitude at that time was doubtful, they would regain their former supremacy and entirely wipe out the Muhaisin. Though the Shaikh knew that he had the support of the British, he also realised that the British needed ail their forces to attack the Turks, and therefore his wisest policy was to strike first. In the action against the Cha'b in June, 1915, the Muhaisin gained a decisive victory. As regards their numbers on this occasion it was estimated that the Muhaisin put a force of 3,000 in the field. This is less than half the num ber of able bodied men, as recorded in the subsequent lists, but it must be remembered that no tribe would ever put all its men into the field and pos sibly not more than two-thirds, that possibly not more than that, number were armed and that the Muhaisin are a settled tribe of cultivators, a large number of whom live quietly on the banks of the Shatt al Arab between Basrah and bao, and tor that reason would be unlikely to go to war with as large a percentage of their men as tribes of the nature of the Bani Turuf or Bani Lam. All credit, however, is due to Shaikh Khaza'l and the Muhaisin for their loyalty to the British during the war. Sliaikh Khaza'Fs heir is hi- eldest son, Shaikh Chasib, who is unpopular with the tribesmen, but wb ever their Chief it is doubtful if the Muhaisin would ever desert the Bri + if only for the sake of retaining their lands oa the Shatt a! ‘Arab.SAGWAND. One of the principal tribes of the Bala Girieh Confederation, who in autumn pour into the plains of Dizful, advancing as far south as Shush. Certain sections of the tribe are found in the Dizful district at all times of the year. During the war a vast amount of ruffianism and extortion was experi enced at the hands of the Lurs, and partly owing to their proximity to Shush and therefore their accessibility to our troops and partly owing to their extortion of 1,300 tomams from a British caravan and a theft of eleven mules the Sagwand were successfully punished in April, 1916. In 1917 an attempt was made to redeem the tribe from an irresponsible rabble into a body of men under some measure of discipline and a force of mounted police, known as the Sagwand Levy was formed to maintain order in the neighbourhood of Dizful and the roads leading in and out of it. Organised on Persian lines this force of 45 mounted men, drawn from the Sagw r ands, was trained by a British officer. A shadow of this force is still in existence in the form of sowars provided for the use of the Deputy Governor of Dizful. The tribe, however, stili retains its raiding characteristics and in 1920 much trouble was experienced in this respect with the Khasraj and Che- nanah sections of the Bani Lam. In 1921 Sadiq Khan, Chief of the sections in the Dizful area, was dismissed by Muaj r yid ad Dowlah, the Governor-General of ‘Arabistan, who appointed Mir ‘Ali Khan and Reza Khan in his place. The imme diate result of this action was that Mir ‘Ali Khan was killed and at least 3,000 Sagwand left with Sadiq Khan. In the spring of 1922 the Lur tribes were fighting amongst one another over Sadiq Khan; he has, how ever, since returned.♦ BAN1 SALIH. A considerable tribe of partly marshmen and partly cultivators of wheat and barley, which is to be found in the Hawizah district. Owing, however, to its proximity to the Bani Turuf it is inclined to be oversha dowed by that tribe, which it would in all probability follow in war. It is allied to the smaller tribe, Shurafah, which is dependent of the Bani Salih. It is said that a great number of tribesmen from the ‘Amarah Liwa have lately migrated to the Hawizah district and joined the Bani Salih. The tribe pays its revenue to the Shaikh of Muhammarah through his agent Shaikh Sahar.SHURAPAH. A small tribe which ha*, settled in the Hawizah district and allied itself to the Bani Salih. The tribe claims to have migrated originally from the Hedjaz, and it is asserted that it was part of the Bani Hussain section of A1 Dhafir, a nomadic tribe on the borders of the Muntafiq.BAN1 TAMIM or BANI MALIK. A numerous tribe that claims to be descended from the Gliazaiwi family of Damascus, from where they came and settled in the Shatrah district of the Muntafiq. From here they are said to have been driven out by Shaikh ‘Ajil al Sa‘dun and moved to Hawizah, where they encountered the Bani Turuf, who drove them on further to the lands between Hawizah and the Karun. In this territory the tribe has since remained with the exception of a few sections, who settled in the Hindian district. Up to a few years back the Bani Turuf and Bani Tamim were con stantly at war with each other, but their differences are said to be now settled. Long-standing feuds, however, are not lightly forgotten, and it is doubtful if the two tribes would unite in a common cause unless against an invading force, from which the lands of both were in danger. The tribe is more settled than the Bani Turuf or the Bani Lam, for though the majority of the tribesmen are nomadic and wander with their sheep and camels to the most suitable grazing lands in their area, a great many of the tribe encamp on the left bank of the Shatt al ‘Arab in the date season belween Nashwah and Da'aiji, where they own date planta tions. In the early days of the war, when the tribes of ‘Arabistan were affected by the jihad, the Bani Tamim threw in their lot against the British and the Shaikh of Muhammarah. They did not appear to have taken any active part in the fighting against our troops, as the Bani Turuf, but they acted with treachery, which caused them to be treated as our enemies.e BAN I TURUF. A powerful tribe of the Ilawizali district, which claims descent from Hatim Tai, famous in the Hedjaz as being the most hospitable man of the age. This theory is supported by Shaikh Ghadhban ibn Bunaiyan of the Bani Lam. who asserts that the Bani Lam and Bani Turuf are closely connected through their ancestor Hatim, the relationship being reached as follows:— Hatim. I Nawwar. i Taruf. Lam. If this assumption is correct, the two tribes, which lie side by side, are unlikely to be really hostile to one another and such a powerful combina tion must not be overlooked, though owing to tribal jealousies, feuds and the greed on behalf of the tribes and sections for extension of lands, the two tribes need never be considered seriously as one powerful and com bined force. Of its leading Shaikhs ‘Asi and ‘Aufi succumbed to large bribes offered during the war by Muhammad Pasha Daghastani and were expelled from their tribe by the Shaikh of Muhammarah. They now r live together at Halfayah in the ‘Amarah district of ‘Iraq always ready to curry favour with the British Government and the Shaikh of Muhammarah in order that they may be reinstated in their former positions as paramount Shaikhs of the two large Baits, into which the tribe is divided. In 1915 during the war the Bani Turuf showed hostility to the British forces and actually made an attack against them on the right bank of the Karim for which they were severely punished. Though the tribe pays its revenue to the Shaikh of Mukaimnarak through his agent, Salih ibn Ghadhban, the Shaikh can hardly claim to have complete control over the tribe, which has never yet been entirely subject to his authority.r ZIRGAN. A small and unimportant tribe of Southern ‘Arabistan that is poli tically allied to the Bawieh. Qasim ‘Ali was their Chief during the war; he was, however, consi dered one of the mainsprings of unrest in the summer of 1916, his depen dants having committed a raid on the Shushtar-Abgah road in June, and was arrested in September of the same year. His arrest had no adverse effect on the attitude of his tribe. ;</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0001b9_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/C213</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0001b9</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/C213</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Tribal List: Arabistan (Northern and Southern) 1923'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1923/1923</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-10-06T21:16:13</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (55 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the first folio with 1 and terminates at the last folio with 55; these numbers are written in pencil, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
