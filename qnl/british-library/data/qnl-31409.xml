Before foreign aeroplanes whether Dutch or French use either Bahrain or Gwadur formality of obtaining permission from Shaikh of Bahrain and Sultan of Muscat will have to be obtained. Before I left Karachi Sultan complained strongly to me that Dutch and French aeroplanes flew over Gwadur and might use it as an emergency landing ground without having obtained permission of his State. I soothed his feelings and have just received a letter from him asking us on his behalf to request the Dutch and French Governments to apply to him for formal permission* Reference paragraph 2. I concur. In addition to necessity of testing route by practical experience before Dutch or French can use Shargah, Shaikh’s concurrence will have to be obtained as present agreement only covers Imperial Airways’ machines.

Vith reference to your notes Hos.1359 of the 24th September and 1412 of the 4th October, regarding certain facilities desired . for Aircraft of the Royal Dutch Air Transport Company (K.L.li.) in the Persian Gulf, I have the honour to inform you that the request of the Hetherlands Government for the regularisation of the position as regards Netherlands aircraft flying over Gwadur and landing there was duly forwarded to the competent British authorities for transmission to the Sultan of Muscat. I hope to be able to inform you in the near future of the reply returned by His Highness. 2 ‘ 1 uncters tand that since the date of your notes under reference, the Netherlands Government have obtained from the ■ ersian Government renewed permission to fly along the Persian coast of the Gulf. In these circumstances, I have the honour to enquire of you whether the Netherlands Government wish any longer to pursue the question of facilities along the Arab coast of the. Gulf and still desire application for facilities to be made on their behalf to the Shaikh of Bahrain, as requested in your note ol the 24th September. 3 ‘ 11 w0 ld not in an y case, I fear, be possible to afford tne Royal Dutch Air Transport Company facilities at fas Island. -he aerodrome there which is not more than an emergency landing ground on the military air ica route, is not used by Imperial Airways. 4.

You should add that His Majesty’s Government have in their turn appointed Imperial Airways Limited to act as their agents for the purpose of maintaining the aerodrome and ancillary services and collecting the prescribed fees. 3. You should also draw the attention of the French Government to paragraph l(ii) of the Air navigation Regu- -lations for Civil Aircraft made by His Highness which lays down that aircraft engaged in regular services shall not fly over the territories of Muscat and Oman on the xiorth His Ey cp liency side/ j ’’’he Right Honourable / ' ) Hir George Clerk, K.C.M.G., C.B., etc. etc. etc Yiri s.I nide of the Tmlf Onan or land at frvmdur except under a special authorisation issued by His Highness, and request them to noMfy the “Air I?ranc«“ Company that thev should apply as soon on ponnihlo for the yrant of + he necessary special authorisation for each aeroplane en- yap*ed on that route in order to regularise the position arising from t-he passare of their aircraft over Muscat territory and their use of the aerodrome at (hvadur. fou sh uld explain that as a consequence of the appoint ment of His Majesty’s Government to he his agents for the maintenance of the aerodrome at Gv;adur and the ancillary services connected therewith His Hiyhhess has decided +hat all transactions and correspondence with foreign air companies or pilots in regard to the Air Navigation Regulations shall he conducted through the Nri + ish political authorities in the Persian Gulf. r ’he applic ation of the Air Prance Company for the necessary auth orisations should therefore he made through His 'Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire, who is also Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 4.

In view of this renuirenent I have '-he honour to request that the Hoyal Dutch Air Lines (K.L.H) way be informed that they should apply as soon as possible for the grant of the necessary special authorisation for each aeroplane engaged on that route in order to regularise the position arising fron the passage of their aircraft over Muscat territory and their use of the aerodrome at Gnadur. I should explain that as a consequence of the appointnent of His Majesty’s Government to be their agents for the maintenance o^ the aerodromes at Gwadur and Huharraq and the ancillary services connected therwi+h, His Highness the Gultan and His Kxcellency the Gheikh have decided that all transactions and correspondence wi + h foreign air companies qr ! pilots in regard to the Air Navigation Peculations shall he conducted through the British Political authorities in the Arslan Gulf. r &gt;ie application of the Poynl Dutch Air Lines for the necessarv authorisations should therefore be made through His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General,at Bushire who is also Political Resident in the Persian Gul f. 5 * ' r ° n wil1 observe that it has no^ hitherto been possiile to complete paragraph (c) of Schedule Ii attachedattached to the Conditions governinp the use of the aerodrome at Owadur (charges for attendance and faciliti for aircraft enframed in public transport). r, hi*s oninaion is, hov;ev-r, of no practical importance at present since 7. understand Imperial Airways Limited have a enecial comprehensive arrangement with the ’’oval Dutch Air Lines to cover all such charges as could he included under this heading. 1 ^ case of Schedule II attached to the Conditions governing the use of the aerodrome at Auharraq no charfres have yet hf^en dete.rmined owin/? to the fact that, as regards aircraft engaged in public transport.

Please obtain the necessary authorization from the Ruler of Bahrain for the landing of aircraft at Muhapraq. The Shaikh’s permission is contained in enclosure to your letter No.C-171 of 30th April 1933. In view of our rights under the Bahrain Civil Air Agreement, this permission need not be invoked, but you may find it convenient to refer to it. All that is S.6.

(2) I am not quite clear whether it is intended that permission shall be given to the K.L.M, to fly over the territories of the Sultan. If not, their machines after leaving Bahrain will have to fly round the tip of the Has Musandum peninsula, thus considerably increasing the length of their flight to Gwadur, which is already a very .i,or% one, and will be entirely over the sea, in land machines. It may be that the K.L.M., by permission of the Iranian Govern ment, intend to continue using Jask; but even so, if they have to fly round the peninsula and not across it, the length of their flight will be appreciably increased. If permission is granted to the K.L.M. to fly over the peninsula, they will necessarily have to be given permission to fly over the Trueial Coast, since it is only the extreme tip of the penin sula which belongs to Muscat, and further South there is a corridor independent of Muscat, running from the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman. If it is intended, to permit the K.L.M. to fly over the Trucial Coast and the Arabian territories of the Sultan, then for authorize tion for the latter area, please see Muscat Civil Air Agreement paragraph II. 1 (i).(3) Our Air Agreements on tne TruciaX Coast, however, are limited to our Agreement of S2nd July 1932 for Imperial Airways and Royal Air Force only with the Shaikh of Sharjah, and to Royal Air Force air facilities with some of the other Shaikhs. This being so, presumably before we could give permission to K.L.St. to fly over the Trucial Coast, or use any aerodromes there, we should have to extend our present Agreements with the Sheikhs of that ares. (4) PI ease therefore do not approach the Sultan’s deputy in the matter of the Arabian territories of the Sultan pending instructions from the India Office and the Government of India. sd* T.C.Fowle Lieut.-Colon el.
