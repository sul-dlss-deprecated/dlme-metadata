During the night of SO - 21sw March, Ameer Habib Ulia, on a fishing expedition near Jaiabad, murdered in his tent. T ^urlerers were successful in getting through the cordon of gu rds. Eamily of Nadir, Minister of V/ar, placed in irons, under suspicion of murder; released by Ameer at Kabul. Nasrulla, brother of Habib t T lla, had himself proclaimed Ameer at Jaiabad. The present Ameer, Aman Ulia, formerly Ain-ed-douie, t Kabul, proclaimed King by the people. As the treasury and war materiel were at Kabul, Has raila perceived ms position to be untenable. He renounced the throne m favour of Ain-ed-doule, was taken to Kabul and imprisoned. In consequence of the independence of the country, the Treaty Df Abden-hamans with the British is declared by the present Ameer to be null and void. He assumes a very friendly attitude towards the Germans. In May, he despatched Missions to Bokhara and Tasnkent. All enemies removed from positions of State. Advanced democratic system of Government established. Disturbances prevailed in India upon hie accession to power. There was also passive resistance, causing the English to adopt sharp measures. In spite'o ^ • 5 of differences of r:li lous belief, the Indian people were here united. Large crowds of manv thousands osse^hled at Delhi; the Lnglish threw bombs amongst them, and used guns and machine- guns. Exceptional condition of affairs everywhere. Damages to •main lines of railways, as well as telegraphs. The Ameer is indignant at ill-treatment of Mussulmans in India by the British. He believed India to b.: on the eve of a revolution, and considered it a favourable opportunity for the declaration of war by Afghanistan, and the extension of his rule to the sea. He had the frontiers occupied at the end of May, and proclaimed a holy war, the main forces being despatched against Peshawar under command of a recently appointed War Minister, formerly Haib Talar. It was s-tat d that the latter was to tame up his position on the frontier for defensive purposes, until completion of mobilisation; however, he crossed the frontier with a few officers, until driven back by the English frontier officer; a few hours later, arrived English reconnaissance aviators, who were fired on; they were followed by bornbin.f' aeroplane^', which carried out a raid upon the camp.

In my opinion, the proposal ought, especially upon political considerations, to he supported as far as possible, perhaps in conjunction with the A.A. (Si .} von PALIS AY. When the last members of the 'German-Afghan Expedition' (formerly unde: Captain Uiedermayer), left Afghanistan separately and in disguise, in orde to proceed to Turkey through Persia, then occupied by the enemy, it was necessary to leave behind the whole of the valuable and extensive baggage of the Expedition, in order not to expose it to certain loss. This baggage, together with 30 mules and a few horses, was 1 ft at Herat, the western capital of Afghanistan, under the guardianship of two Austrian soldiers serving with the expedition, and in agreement with the Axghan Governor—General, who was friendly to us. The baggage includes the diaries and documents of tne Expedition, records of extreme military, scientific and political value, in addition to geological surveys, photographs, etc. Since the last officer of the expedition - Lieutenant Vagner - left Herat in October 191 ^ no further r liable news has reached us from that region. It would be extremely regrettable if the above-mentioned articles, representing the whole gains of an expedition covering H fears, should not return into Gemian hands; at least an attempt should be made for their recover^. The Afghans have alwaVs been friendly to us, and it is not to be supposed that, up to the present, they have delivered our 0 a £ga,ge t o the Engl i eh . It would not in any case be advisable to deal officially withEntente for permission to remove the goods, for, as soon as the English knew of their existence, the^ * 7 Quid o all ir their power to obtain possession of them, rather than to let them fall into our hands . The routes into Afghanistan are for the present still closed against us; the one via Constantinople - Eantzasus - Turkestan is in the power of the Entente, the other via Bolshevist Russia to Turkestan is not yet practicable. The War Ministry is in treaty with the Enter.te on the subject of the despatch of German commissions to German prisoners of war still in Russian territories i n S ib e ri a an d Tu rke s t an . The plan is to send Lieut.Wagner - with a reliable Persian now in Berlin, who has already served with the Expedition, - to Turkestan. There they could arrange suitable measures, or proceed to Afghanistan in disguise, make enquiries as to the baggage, and bring it back to Germany. Lieut.Wagner seems particularly suitable for this task, as he knows the lan uage, and has already accomplished the journey from. Afghanistan to Turkey through Persia, under the most difficult conditions and in disguise. I respectfully beg to propose: That tbe importance of the enterprise should be pointed out to the authorities, and that it should be supported, so that the two gentlemen mentioned above travel to Turkestan under the protection of the P/V. Commission, and may be able to arrange the necessary measures there.

A fine old fellow, but said to be a very sly old fox, but strongly anti-English. In the afternoon Amir Hish bed's brother, confidential agent of the Democrats, passed a note to the Professor written in Drench, and begged him for a secret interview, refused the Persian as interpreter. Therefore v/eber. Then he told us that one third of the population were adherents of his party; that they were ready to strike immediately, and he advised doing so soon. Said the Governor was also ready, as he had great possessions on the Gulf, where he had suffered great injuries from the English. Y/hilst Amir Hish lied's brother was here, he was visited by the Swedes. Nystrom is ^oing tomorrow to Herman shall with 250 men, in order to escort Prince Heuss. At 10 o'clock the Governor sent his carriage for us. At the interview we noticed that he is really on our side, but is in horrible dread of the Turks . as he is insanely avaricious, and anxious about his possessions. Departure. Halt at Hissar. 1 kilometre outside Sultanabad we found awaiting us gendarmerie, priests, 2 carriages and saddle horses of the Governor, a brother of the Shah.

Expressed himself quite frankly I that they were now all German Officers already. (Ifote - This apparently refers to the Swedish officers generally).

The Hindus of the English Consulate -sent us word that in the event of 4fc Scholuch (rising) they would If at once deliver arms over to us. After dinner we sent Ahmed Aga, our. town spy, to spread the report in the bazaar that the Germans had noticed that telegrams of theirs had been intercepted, that they were furious about it, and that at the first disturbance they would have all telegraph officials hanged. Perhaps in consequence of this report, there oame shortly before 10 o cloc^ a cypher telegram from Riedermayer of 650 words, the gist of which was that the Teheranis were fearfully nervous, a declaration of war was not to be thought of for the present, all se fi°^ s c , 8 . t ®^ to be avoided here.

Poles for Wireless were prepared: Gendarmerie informed. Pasting expects to be able to begin in about 3 days. Engaged HasOan Aga finally as head trooper. Pirst telegram by our wireless. Were all at Glerupp^ in the evening. He had a telegram from Teheran to say that he is also to march off to Teheran on 19th with all the Gendarmerie. On the top of this good news we drank mightily again. Telegram from Hiedermayer that entry of Russian troops threatened, that they and we are to prepare for the worst, if tolegj.aph was destroyed that to be signal for us to strike at once. Thereupon interview with Democrats. Saget-ul-Islam is expediting enlistment and equipment of our 20 mounted guards. Letter from Governor to say that wireless station forbidden, confiscation of our printing press. We sent for Chief of Police and were^rude. Bohnstorff has departed. Actoed Aga has become Commissioner in Julfah, so that we had no news from tho town today, above all what is being done by the Saiyids whom we have bought over. Seiler was with a relative of the Governor’s who has just come from Europe, and is going to stir him up for us against the Russians. Pasting has typhoid, it is distressing that wireless must stop.

Telegram from iTiedermayer to prepare us for the arrival of an open telegram from Prince Reusa, stated that the working of the wireless must be suspended, and spoke of a possible necessitj' of evacuating Ispahan, Were all absolutely beside ourselves. Sent very sharp telegrams to Teheran, one containing Professor’s resignation. Visit from Amir Kujahid 1L who had come direct from Europe. Seemed to be very much on our side. Bakhtiari leader. At mid-day the threatened telegram which absolutely drove us into a ^ fury because it had been sent via the Indo-European into the bargain. The Teheranis must have gone absolutely crazy, could not have disavowed us and exposed us to ridicule in a worse manner. At 6 o’clock Seiler left for Teheran. Professor and 1 went secretly, only with Uirza and Hadji Hassan to a house in the neighbourhood in order to meet the great pax’s on of Sehdeh.

Enraged a prince, Ismail Ilirza, who is to reconnoitre the way via Yezd to Birjand and to leave the day after tomorrow. Thanks to the skill of our agents, our emissary for Birjand has been unmasked as pro-Russian. For tactical reasons we merely told him that the journey was n$ longer necessary. Engaged new emissary for Birjand: goes tomorrow. Telegram of encouragement from Djafar Sadeh to Teheran signed by all the Ulemas and 3 Bakhtiaris.

Seiler demanded written guarantee from Premier, that we shall not be handed over to any enemy power, money for necessaries, and the private money taken away from the others. Nassim left in a rage. poor Roever went with him hoping that if he paid a debt of about 5,000 Marks for Kawam he would be allowed to remain. Becker (went) to Hiedemayer. He wants to postpone the matter until Wassmuss comes with help, or the English come so as to get us to Bombay. rr e are all convinced that the Russians will take us direct to Russia from I spall an, as they are convinced here that nothing is to be gained from open violence against us. Word from Hassim that departure not until day after tomorrow. Roever has obtained permission to remain he re • Then came Hassim-ul-Hulk with whom cur departure was arranged for tomorrow morning. As soon as this was settled, Professor and Seiler were commanded to the ’♦farewell audience”, to make the proposals for our remaining here. Came back very quickly with the news that Kawam, Soulet and Fath-ul-Mulk go with us tomorrow morning to Abadeh to negotiate with P.F. That looks as if we are considered simply as articles of merchandise, for he said that if they do not agree, we are to return. At about 10.30 p.m. Seiler suddenly came in beaming and told us that Muntaair had just been here again, also beaming with joy: our transfer to Teheran has been cancelled by the Government. Bo not know what the real reason is, but are very glad, as our anxiety at the thought of falling into the hands of the Russians . had been very great. Nassim came during supper and declared we must all go to the Ark (Fortress, Gendarmerie, Barracks, Prison). Of course we all protested. Finally we agreed that • Niedermayer should go there tomorrow morning and see if it is fit for human habitation. Niedermayer went early and soon returned: the place in itself is bearable but extremely dhty. We have little hope of obtaining our freedom, as all here are probably pro-English. The Ark is a tremendous place: we are quite in the centre, where there are many other prisoners. I wonder why the fools set so much value on usi Confinement apparently not so strict here. Seiler and Fusting still with us three. In the morning shouting among the Gendarmerie. They had struck because they had no money.

A: ter few days the Gorman Consul came to tell him that the American Government had decided to set him free, and lie was allowed to travel to New York with other German officials who were to be deported. Detectives accomosnied them .-ill the way. He mentions that the Amir of Afghanistan had, a year previous to this, applied to the British Go verm,i ant for a 'safe conduct' for him (this is of course untrue) but it was only due to America having become a belligerent that he was now allowed to oroceed on his way. Their ship was over hauled at Halifsix but they were shown every consideration and no further incident occurred until their arrived at Bergen. I suppose it still remains unexplained row this men obtained a 'safe conduct'.

Reliable information has been received that Fritz ledier and Vilhelm Paschen of the Neidermeyer Expedition have escaped from captivity and joined Kuchik Khan. Having been informed of this, Neidemeyer instruct, ad Pas chen^^gefttouoh with Tims, also to take the neces sary steps for getting into, communication with Afghanistan, and if possible, to recover the luggage of the Neidermeyer Expedi- tion, which is lying at Herat. Conunent; It is known that in^arch 1918 Neidemeyer desired •that ItaippMr should remain at Herat until the conclu- sion of peace, so as to avoid risking the valuable luggage there. It would therefore appear that his present instructions indicate anxiety as to the safety of the baggage while in Afghanistan, rather than any urgent need for using it. The instructions to Paschen to get into touch with Tiflis in the first instance perhaps indicate^ that any attempt to move the baggage will be made via the Trans-Caspian Railway to Krasnovodsk^thence via the Caspian, Baku and Tiflis. Alternative routes which might be adopted are via the Orenburg - Tashkent Rail way, or by road awross Persia.

He was caught wi£h 2 Indians and one Persian in August 1916 leaving by almost the same route. A small party of the Sistan Levy Corps under Captain A. D. Wise, 27th Light Cavalry caught the party at Sehdeh. • They were handed over at once tC an escort of the 28th Light Cavalry under Captain Walker who took them down to Birjand and thence to Sistan, where Lieut Voigt was detained for 2 months. In due course he was forwarded to India, The party had bombs amongst their baggage. 265 English sovereigns, one Turkish pound and one German 20 mark piece were found on the persons and in the kit of the party. These have been ordered to be confiscated the Government of India as being undoubtedly German Governments money. The ki note-books also have been confis cated by the Government© The binoculars, presumed to be the ££££££^£££^£ 1 ^^ received from Captain Wise and are being forwarded to you by xxxKijqB parcel post* TheThe purse was of no value and was thrown av/ay 0 Nothing has been discovered about the of the two watches and other small articles mentioned in your list* If they were taken from the prisoner at the time of his capture, it is surprising that he should not have at once brought the fact to while at Sis tan and I believe received various articles of kit and bedding which were considered necessary for his welfare* (Sd) i^B* Prideaux Lt-Colone!

To, The Bi^it Honourable H.E. the Chancellor of the German Snpire. Your Excellency, I reached Kabul on the 2nd of October 1915 aa I informed you in one of the letters written from Kabul. Since then I am doing my best to perform my duty but very unfortunate hinderances have not allowed to accomplish much. Still the hope of future and the sense of duty keeps me at the helm. No doubt the slow ways of the people and the Government came in my way but the greatest difficulty proved that I had practically not a sing le farthing to start the work. I hoped that if only proper start was made I could have got my own means. God so wished- is my only consolation. Now my only request is that please send at least twenty thousand troops for purely Indian work and the chief conrc&amp;nder should have clear instructions to cooperate with me and help me and not to oppose me. IHien your Excellency has once left the Indian work to me I feel sure that at least up to the time that the perfect freedom of India is achieved I shall receiv^very help from your august Government. I am glad to add that Molvie Barkatulla has proved in valuable to me. You may also be {j,ad to know that I am on very friendly terms with the Af^jhan Government as a whole and also with every individual member and I am heartily thankful for the great regard they have for me. Every higji personage says that if suffioienl German Turkiah help in army arrives, Afghanistan will at once join and I have not the least doubt about this statement. I think if the war is sufficiently long and if you really desire to crush your bitterest enemy- the English there can be no better step than to send sufficiently large force to India and Afghanistan. In the meantime however every thing will be aone by me in the holy cause. ^ith hope to see something grand achieved.War Office, Whitehall, S.W. July 27th My dear Shuck'burgh, You will no doubt have noted among the enclosures to Indian Foreign Secretary’s letter No. 46 m dated the 15th June a translation of shorthand note found at Birjand in Voignt’s pistol holster. This docuiiient seems to me to be one of very considerable importance, and I enclose a copy of a short note which I have written about it. The question of the date of the document is a very material one, and I have CO\yo t cfm stated in the note my principal reason for that it Kabul . Others features in the document point to the same conclusion. 1) It is described as 'orders for furthe r working of tthe expedition in Persia, and I ’ do not think this phrase would have been used had the document been written in Hay 1915 before the expedi t ions had been formed or started. 2) It is highly improbable that Voight when he was capturedu Q if ^ Z. / I in August 1916^after leaving Afghanistan ^would still be carrying highly confidential orders dated May 1915: on th s other hand it is perfectly natural that he should be conve ing to the germane in Persia orders dictated by Uiedejs^^ye) on the eve of his departure from Kaoul. This document may give us ideas as to what the Germans a try-ewMi do s^jould they succeed in pushing another and stro er expedition into Persia this year. I think however that we should have no difficulty in defeating their schemes. . Yours sincerely .. t ^ * J.E. Shuckburgh Esq, India Office. V111 be : on th. be convei ede^iyei ermans 71 and stro ver that heroes* .. 1 ^ • ®( 3 -Mote on document found at i^irjand on a holster capt Lieutenant Yoight. rom This document throws new light on the objects of the German 'expeditions 11 to Persia and Afghanistan. The translation of the last sentence gives the date of the document as 'After verbal discussion before leaving for Kabul at the end of May'. It is, however, quite clear that this is a mistake either in the original cypher or in the decypher, because the message states that all the effects of the expedition are ready for removal via -eshed - hermanshah - Baghdad. It is, therefore, evident that the note was written prior to Niedermayer 1 s departure from Kabul, which we know to have been on the 22nd May, 1916. Voight, on whom the message was found, was with Niedermayer in Afghanistan and was captured at Behdeh (38 miles H. of Birjand) on the 8th August, 1916, and is now a prisoner in India, He was, as is now clear, taking 'orders for the further working' of the expeditions under Geiler in Kerman, and Zugmayer in Baluchistan both of ^whom n had^,^ee^arresteS^y the Persians in April or e^rly May, 1916, and sent to Shiraz; (Seiler escaped on 4th November, 1916). The first part.of the document is not clear either (a) Niedermayer had reason to anticipate the arrival of 5,000 men, who were to enter Afghanistan; or (b) Niedermayer had come to the conclusion that only if 5,000 men were available/eouldthe achieve anything in Afghanistan. ' bailing the arrival of this force, further work was to be confined to Persia. The frequent references to the Mekran Coast point to the real objective of the German activities in Persia. Emphasis is*4 \ S 1. ia laid on the importance of occupying this coaet after the conclusion of peace until permission should he received from * I Berlin to evacuate it. it ia suggested that the German plan * i ^ was to extract a concession for a port, say at Chahbar, and a railway connection with the Berlin « Baghdad line. The remark that the winning over of Persia would be of t no value unless that country should become a theatre of war, is hard to understand. it may mean that hiedermayer realised that his mission would be unproductive unless backed up by regular troops. The most important statement in this document is '‘On the conclusion of peace to make the most of all possible opportunity to send Fassting* with wireless to habul, as later we shall hardly be likely to be able to get into the country”. This looks as if some agreement haotbeen come v to with the ;irair who may have agreed to accept German support after the war: but even if this is not the case, it is clear that our vigilance over Afghanistan may have to Oe increased rather than relaxed on the conclusion of peace.^putenant Colonel F.

Meshed, Uth May 1917. With special reference to your telegram No. 27376, dated 30th April 1917, the statement of Abdul Wahab, the German agent arrested here last week, throws no recent light on Niedermeyer’s whereabouts. It tends to confirm, however, previous information on the subject, and to my mind indicates his flight as in westerly direction and precludes any probability of his having passed by Pamirski post. Abdul Wahab’s statement is briefly as follows. He is a Bahai and a native of Bushruyeh, and at the entry of the German Mission to Afghanistan was employed as a savar of the maliyat department at Tun, where for the first time he heard of the Germans from a party of Cossacks who were searching for them and whom he assisted in obtaining supplies. On his way to Duhuk, whither he had been despatched by his superior, he fell in at Fathabad with the Germans who detained him on suspicion of being a Itussian spy, and forced him to accompany them to the Afghan frontier. Learning that Cossacks were in pursuit he was afraid to turn back and thus accompanied the Germans into Afghanistan. fl. Niedermeyer, 2. von Hentig. 3. The German party consisted of ■ 4. Reyer (whom he calls Roghal, a young, tall, man.) Wagner. 5. Vogt. 6. Name unknown who died before Kabul, (one Chaush.) Native adherents were Ali Akbar alias Mirza Hussain, Jamshid, Nasrulla Khan, Wagner's factotum, Abbas Ali, Agha Karim, Asghar^Hamadani, Hajji Karam, and Nur Muhammad. Some 20 to 25 Persian savara who had accom panied the party deserted with their horses and rifles before the Afghan frontier was reached. Abdul Wahab was with the Germans on their way from Herat to Kabul, and during their stay at Kabul. In his account of their departure some inaccuracies are observable. He states that the 1st party to leave consisted of Vogt, Mohendro Partap, Barakatulla, Kazim Beg, and 2 others who appeared to have the status of officers (Abdul Aziz and Hassan Ali). With the 2nd party were von Hentig, Pteyer, 2 Afridis and the Persian Jamshid. This party remained behind at Panjsher, he heard subsequently they had gone towards Chinese territory, and the main party with Niedermeyer, which he accompanied, proceeded towards Mazar-i-Sharif. At Sar-i-Pul (he is somewhat hazy as to place names and thinks it might have been Shiburghan; Ahmad Barbari assert s it was Sar-r Pul) he was told that he was to return to Persia with Ali Akbar alias Mirza Hussain and after dark was conducted to a garden outside the town, where, in company with several Turkomans ho saw Niedermeyer, disguised in Turkoman dress, talking mz fi low tone with Mirza Hussain, as AH i\kbar will in future be referred to. A Turkoman guide was assigned to the two Persians and they set off on horseback. The presence of the Turkomans, the secrecy observed, and the evident pre parations for a journey, all indicated that Niedermeyer himself was about to separate from his companions. Mirza Hussain, in reply to a question from Abdul Wahab, stated that Niedermeyer was going to China. Abdul Wahab thinks that this answer was intentionally misleading ; the Germans knowing how little reliance was to be placed on Persian discretion, and telling them as little as possible of their movements. Mirza Hussain assumed the direction of the journey, and tne two men with their guide reached the Persian frontier, apparently not far from Chacha, after some 12 days. Abdul Wahab states that his horse was sent back with the guide, and I heard of this horse myself in October last at Karatigan when enquiring as to the passage of any of the German party. The two men then separated, Abdul Wahab proceeding to Meshed en route for Tabas, and Mirza Hussain to Tehran, no doubt with a commission from Niedermeyer. Mirza Hussain appears to have been a capable man, deep in the confidence of Niedermeyer. By race a Tabrizi Turk, he had joined the German Party in Persia, and, from Afghanistan, had more than once taken messages for them to Tehran. On one occasion he had returned via Russia, Tejen, and Sarakhs, and was reputed to have been an escaped prisoner from Siberia. Wagner has been trying to get into touch with him through Abdul Wahab. The latter professes to know nothing of his whereabouts. The letters and papers captured in connection with Abdul Wahab have been placed in possession of the Consul-General who is reporting in detail on the affair. In the present memo, I am only concerned as to the extent to which Abdul Wabab’s statement bears on Niedermoyer’s movements with reference to previous information. 2. Obviously Abdul Wahab had no information as to Niedermeyer after his own departure. At the same time his statement affords valuable confirma tion to that of my agent embodied in my Memo, of tho 22nd of September last regarding the assistance furnished by Abdul Majid Khan, tho absconding Governor of Shiburghan, and the arrival of the party on Persian soil. Bates are exceedingly hard to come by, but the date of the Germans’ departure from Kabul is known, and there is no inherent improbability in the report of another agent. (Telegrams 18-F. and 19-F. of the 10th and 12th July last) regarding the report of a disguised German or Germans’ passage to Russian territory, especially in view of reports from other quarters of Niedermeyer’s reputed movements (to Bokhara to stir up trouble). The next link in the chain appears to be the report of two Germans disguised as mullahs leaving Muhammadabad, a village adjoining the gates of Meshed, for Tehran, coupled with the coincident statement from Herat that a letter announcing Niedermeyer’s safe arrival at Meshed had come to hand, and with the fact that Munshi Nizam the Meshed Chief of Police on the occasion of Niedermeyer’s stay in 1918—subsequently banished for German phile conduct—was secretly staying at this village (Telegram 38-F. of 6th September last). The interval of time is a natural one. The fact that although in the case of the Chacha Germans and the disguised mullahs, I was able to give the Russians timely warning, no arrest ensued, does not, .in view of the difference of our friends’ methods from those of Sherlock Holmes, cause me any great surprise. In the former case the Military Agent had no hope of their capture when once within the Russian border, and in the latter the erection of a barricade at the entrance to Nishapur by the Cossacks, with the information gratis to all and sundry that it was intended to stop two German officers in disguise, was quite sufficient to turn a man, acute enough to perform in 1913 the complicated rites of the Meshed pilgrimage undetected, from future possible traps on the main route.If, therefore, Niedermeyer was one of these men I can see no reason why, granted a certain amount of luck, he should not have safely reached the Tur kish forces of Tehran, and thence made his way to Constantinople. In this case, however, I should have expected him to arrive before April 10th. An ounce of fact is worth a quantity of suppositions, and a single well-attested statement would upset the above theory founded on the data quoted, with the addition of various corroborative statements which have come to hand from time to time, many of which were noted in Meshed Diaries of the period. The case of Deyer has baffled me. I have always imagined that he ac companied Niedermeyer. Abdul Wahab’s statements would appear to contra dict this, not only in respect of the division of the German party at Kabul with regard to other particulars of which he is obviously at fault, but with regard to proceedings subsequent to the departure from Kabul. I should have been in clined to place Reyer as the companion with whom Niedermeyer reached Constantinople. I can see no foundation for the statement that members of the mission had perished by the way. As far as I know all have been accounted for—-captured, anchored, or absconded; i.£., assuming that Reyer reached Constantinople with Niedermeyer. The same appears to be true as regards the native members of the Mission. E. A. E. REDL, Liut.'Col., 0. S. 0. S?98GSB - 35—10-6*17 — GCBP Simlakt m\ of war.

MGHAIilSTAII : Captain NIEDERMAYER, head of the German mission to Afghanistan, arrived in Constantinople a week ago on his way back to Germany with the rest of the mission, which has entirely failed and which has been recalled. Informant travelled with NIEDERMAYER in the train, and had a long conversation with him. NIEDERMAYER had been to Kabul and was there 8 months, and the mission did everything in its power to persuade the Ameer to break with the British. NIEDERMAYER went disguised as far as Parmiski Post as a Persian, and was there actually interviewed by Russian officers. Most of the men of his mission had been killed in one way or another in Afghanistan. *****!z l\J 'l^U aERIiAN MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN. The German Government sent NIEDERMEYER to KABUL early in the war with a view to endeavour to get the EMIR to declare war against GREAT BRITAIN, The EMIR, however, was too afraid of the British Government and refused to act, although NIEDERMEYER remained 6-8 months at KABUL, working hard. He even went so far as to accept the Mussulman faith. NIEDERMEYER was a great friend of Major, now General SYKES, whom he knew in PERSIA. From Kabul NIEDERMEYER went to the PAMIRSKY PASS where he was arrested by the Russians, but he managed to escape, despite the fact that General. SYKES endeavoured, it is said, to capture him. In an open fight he lost a good number of his men. He has orders to proceed to BERLIN immediately. It took five months for him to travel from KABUL to ALEPPO. NIEDERMEYER was interviewed by B. on the BAGDAD Railway while going to CONSTANTINOPLE.

(2) A cypher document. 2 . In paragraph 22 of my Diary No. 1 for the week ending 6 th ultimo it was reported that this man had fallen out with his fellow servants and was trying to obtain a passport to leave Herat for Persia. In this he ultimately succeeded, and Wagner apparently seized the opportunity to send a letter to a German friend at the American Legation in Tehran whom he described to Ahmad as wearing spectacles and having no beard. Ahmad was given by the German £1 with which to pay his expenses to Tehran, a sum hardly sufficient for the purpose in these times, and was told that he would receive an ample reward upon delivering the letter. He is still under observation here, but has up to the present made no statement of sufficient interest to report beyond the above particulars, and it is doubtful whether there is anything more to be got out of him that we do not know already. 3. Copies of this letter and enclosure 2 are being forwarded to His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran, and at the request of the Russian Consul-General and Colonel Scauratt, Staff Officer of the Russian troops in Meshed, I have also supplied them with copies of the cypher message.

Confidential person is Nurullah Khan who possesses a common code with me. The leader of the j part expedition vid Meshed is Herr Paschen^ * who will shortly stay with the robber Muhammad QurshabadI For me it is of the greatest importance to be kept posted regularly of all events having the slightest political or military significance in the Khorasan and. Frontier countries. Important matters must be telegraphed, for this you can conveniently demand and employ the code with Herr Paschen. Important are reports of general situation, movements of Russian and English troops and survey a nee of the Afghan frontier. You yourself might explore out the elements in our favour perhaps cautiously link up connection with Afghanistan and ascertain the feeling oJLthe present Emir in Herat . we need very soon reliable new T s on this point. All expenses to my charge. Your service will be recognised as military service. Some of my names are—Husain Khan, Mohd., Huber and Menard.

These requirements are quite neces sary and very reasonable. I arranged working between (?) and Sardar Nosrat, and the Prince at first approved, but later as usual Ihtisham interfered and made Prince upset arrangement. When this fell I had all present together and a second less satisfactory arrangement involving compromises was agreed upon by all. It is Ihtisham’s one endeavour lo render harmony of Administra tion impossible and to create maximum of friction. With that aim he inter feres in every one’s business and I have met no one of any party who has good w r ord for him. I have done my best for seven months but cannot undertake to carry on with him longer without probable serious trouble. My relations with the Prince are excellent, hut he is simply childish tool in his hands. Complaints against Ihtisham are reaching me from every quarter. Beg to urge steps be taken for his removal at earliest possible date as I distrust him myself in every way. Addressed Tehran ; repeated Bushire, No. 17.Enclo. No. 2 of Serial No. 301.

[Repeated Shiraz (No. 118), Bushire (No. 22).] Reference my telegram 36. Yesterday I saw Kurdistani and Sardar Nasrat separately. There are two questions. One the arrears due on Farman Farma for financial year 1915-16. Farman Farma sent a very curt (?) answer to Kurdistani when he asked him whether the arrears should be received from the former agent or from Sardar Nos rat. Farman Farma said he better first collect * revenue. This was not mentioned by Sardar Nosrat. Second. Repeated orders have been sent by the Persian Government to commute and collect all revenue fixed in kind at market rates, and Kurdistani was eventually obliged to send notice to all concerned including Farman larma, but at the same time he informed him that he had protested It is impossible to carry this order into execution, and in many cases it would be unjust. Persian Government will have to accept some compromise as they did three or four years ago. If enforced it would be an additional 10,000 Ts. to F s revenue assessment. In his case Persian Government has ordered question to be suspended for some (?) months and he has been informed to this effect. Correspondence which has been shown to me does not reveal any . malice or unreasonableness in actions of Kurdistani. He has protested against the commutation and collection of revenue in kind in the way directed, but we must collect all just revenue, and if F. who is. apparently making the most of his position, and certain ^wasi-Russian interests are let off (?), collec tion from others will be impossible. Understand that Sykes’ Muntashir-us-Sultaneh seems to be in direct com munication with Kurdistani and Farman Farma on this subject, Perhaps Sykes would like to know this.

He suggested the appointment of Sirdar Bahadur Bakhtiari with adequate following to keep order till the South Persia Rifles are organised and trained. I pass these statements on for what they are worth as Kurdistani’s sincerity and aims are not known by me. Bakhtiari Governor would be un popular and there would be perpetual (?) friction between his followers and South Persia Rifles.

I think the letter is probably genuine, as it was evidently considered genuine by the Khan of Borazjun. If so, it confirms the view of Soulet’s probable methods of settlement of the road question which has been held by the friendly Khans and at Bushire. Possibly however the fall of Baghdad and the withdrawal of the Turks from Persia will spur the Soulet on to assist ing the Persian and British Governments rather more actively.

This individual was wounded in the leg when fighting against us in September 3915 and is the same man whose accidental despatch to Bombay last August delayed Colonel O’Connor’s release. He appears to have learnt something during his captivity. 4. I think these documents show that there is much alarm and dissensions j in the camp of the hostile Khans, and tends to confirm the view which His | Excellency the Darya Begi expressed to me the other day, namely, that they could offer no serious opposition, and that he could easily collect a force and suppress them provided he was supplied with two guns (and perhaps two machine guns) and with gun and small arm ammunition.

European Peace O^Wwra?.--According to what has been read in the English papers, the German Government, after the brilliant successes which it has achieved in Bxmmania, considered it proper to show to its enemies its good and humane intentions on the one hand and proofs of its power on the other. With a view to this it announced that it was ready to make peace with its enemies, and instead of making any terms it simply declared that it would make such a peace as would prevent hostilities from taking place in Europe in future. Besides this it made it known that the Powers in Central Europe agreed that the German Government have always safeguarded their rl ghts, and had done nothing detrimental and injurious to the interests of neutral States. After the German Government made this announcement, the United States of America asked the Allied Governments to express their views in this connection. At present the above two notes by Germany and the United States of America are the theme of all discussions in papers and meetings. The British Prime Minister in a long speech said that such a peace would be productive of many disastrous and dire results. But he at the same time left it for the Bussian and French Governments first to reply the German j peace proposals. The said Prime Minister states that he is afraid lest the German Govern ment should have made this proposal in order to hoodwink them, and put them off their guard. Despite the despondence and hopelessness of his countrymen, he has told them to fight and bring the war to a successful issue.. He reminded them of past mistakes, and appealed to them to assist in bringing the war to a success ful issue. -• ; . . . , . . Lastlv, from the statements of the said Prime Minister, it appears that he has welcomed the German proposals, and he is considering them with much pleasure. . , We have received a report recently that differences and disagreements have arisen between tbe Allied Governments, and some of them have abandoned thpir alliance with England Although we cannot say that such an important and’serious^report is true without reliable authority, yet it is probable that such a disagreement will take place over the peace overtures.14 f*r f - '&lt;t; i 1 2 . State of Affairs in Persia .—The belligerents are fighting on Persian soil everywhere. The northern provinces are completely in the hands of the Russians, who are in sole control of those parts. The western provinces are in the hands of the supporters of our “ nation ”, ^ i.e., Nizam-us-Saltaneh, and the victorious German and Turkish armies. Musher-ud-Douleh is the Governor of Hamadan, and Sardar Muhi is appointed Governor of Burujird, while Nizam-us-Saltaneh himself at Kirman- shah has been selected Prime Minister. A Cabinet and deliberative .Assembly f have also been formed there. A Bank has been established called “ the Imperial Bank of Persia ” and new money coined in the name of His Majesty Ahmad Shah. In the south Ispahan and Shiraz are in the hands of the British Govern ment officials, but from Kazerun as far as a point one farsakh from Bushire the country is in the hands of the Mujahids of the South, and free from the influence of the enemy. 3 Fighting at Dashtarjan .—An engagement took place between the force which was despatched by the British from Shiraz under the command of Path- ul-Mulk, and the Kazeruni, Kaluni and Abdul Muiahids on the night of the 9th Rabi II. jo The result of this engagement was the route of the force and its flight to Shiraz. Some 25 of them were killed and a large quantity of war material fell into the hands of the Mujahids, including 97 rifles and provisions. According to news recently received Path-ul-Mulk has been imprisoned. Hujabr-i-Ashar stayed at Kazerun to assist the Mujahids for some days and returned to his encapment as his co-operation was not necessary, but he was given certain promises to N asir-i-Diwan. 4. Shiraz .—According to a written report received by us, Sufi, the Indian, who had immigrated into our country some years ago with a view to rendering services to his country, and to Persia, and also was imprisoned during the dis^ turbances in Shiraz, has been poisoned in the British Consulate, and made a martyr.

The other was the landing of material and timber at Shief, and also your own coming to Angali in company of Darya Begi. The people of Borazjun are greatly alarmed and perturbed. I beg to inform you that Muhammad Reza Dirisi saw and requested me, if I had any correspondence with you, to enquire from you whether you desired to have any relations with Muhammad Reza Dirisi or not. I replied that you were very unkind to me, and that if necessary I sometimes write and address my applications to the Director of Telegraphs. I told that if he desired I would make the same enquiry through the Director of Telegraphs. He agreed, but he said that I should do so myself without saying that he had asked me to do so. He said that he wanted to know the opinion of the British authorities about himself. I have told you what exactly passed between us, and informed you of the conversation we had. I have not ascertained what was his object in making this request. Shaikh Muhammad Hussain and Mirza Ali Kazeruni no longer receive the salary, which used to be paid to them by Wassmuss out of the loan made15 to him by Zair Khidhar and Shaikh Hussain. Even Mirza Muhammad Reza’s salary is sometimes received, and sometimes not. i Almost the same is the case with the salary of Mulla Ali, the Postmaster at Borazjun. A copy of “ Nida-i-Haq*’ published by Muhammad Reza Dirisi, has been forwarded to you herewith. Enclo. No. 3 of Serial No. 303. Dated the 11th Jamadi I 1335 (=the 5th March 1917) (received 8th March 1917). From— Zair Hussain Zair Haidar, Tangistani, Baghak, To—H G. Chick, Esq., C.I.E., His Majesty's Vice-Consul, Bushire. T respectfully beg to state that H. H, the Resident and yourself have never called upon me to render you a service and I have not made such proposals. Now if you are in earnest, and you are in a position to take action, it is the best and the most favourable opportunity. My meaning is that if Ahmad Khan of Angali is telling you the truth and if you deem it expedient to do so, you may write a letter at once and summon me to Bushire. When I come to Bushire I will write letters to the Chiefs in Tangistan asking them to come to Bushire. The Chiefs and their followers should he given salaries. If Ahmad Khan speaks the truth he should attack Ahmadi with a Gov ernment force by Shief and I with my followers, who get salaries, will advance on Choghadak by way of the Mashila in company with a Government force. Y ou should ask His Excellency Darya Begi to act as Commander-in-Chief, as he is well acquainted with the people and affairs of these parts. When Choghadak is occupied you should make that place your head quarters. If Ahmad Khan refuses to take action, I will be ready to do as I have said . . .If you deem it advisable you may write a letter to me and summon me to Bushire and, if not, please conceal this letter so that no one may know of it. Purther as regards the telescope, you had written that at present you have no excellent telescopes and that you have binoculars. I thank you for your kindness. If you think that you will he able to obtain a good telescope in 20 days’ time, it matters not, as telescopes are better for field use, otherwise please hand the binoculars to the bearer of this letter and for this act of kindness I shall be highly obliged to you. If you send me a reply please send it by the same bearer, and if you cannot send the reply now please tell the hearer to go away and return for it next time. Please do not hand the letter to any one else. Please convey my best and most respectful regards to His Highness the Resident. S. G. P. I., Delhi—762 P. &amp; P. D.—28-3-17 -6.iieUornayer.

They were detained at Mazar Sharif, the Capital of the Turkistan province, by the Governor. Later on uhe Amir ordered them to come to Kabul and they arrived about the end of August. It is commonly reported that this party had been taken prisoners by the Russians and were confined in some Cantonment in Russian Turkistan whence they made their escape from Russian territory but I cannot say for certain. YJhen they reached Kabul they were given a house in the City and an allowance of Rs.2/- a head. They do no work beyond some kind of ornamental painting on the wall of the Civil Hospital. After some time, some of the party were removed from the house first given them to the 'Mahman Khana' or Guest House. They are free to move about but always have a guard with them, probably both to protect them and to prevent them getting into mischief. About the end of August a second party of Germans Turks, Persians and two Indians, numbering with followers 70 or 80 persons, arrived in Afghanistan. They came througli Herat where they were detained for some time by the Governor and were then brought on to Kabul!-. Among them are nine men of importance. 5 ik of these are Germans, two are Indians and the a Turk. When they first arrived in Kabul, the Amir wasat Paghman owing to there being cholera in Kabul. They came to Paghman twice and I saw them. They were not in uniform but one of the Germans wore a helmet with a spike. I could see from their gait and bearing that the Germans and the Turk were soldiers. They can all talk and read and write Persian. The name of the Turk is Kasim Beg, a Turkish military ofiicer, a Colonex or Major. One of the Indians is no other than the notorious Barkat-ullah. The other is a Sikh who says that he is the so* of a Raja from the neighbourhood of ^ Aligarh in the U.P. He calls himself Partab Singh or something of the kind.' Shown a photo of Ajit Singh taken in 1907, says the man resembles the likeness and after seeing the description of Ajit Singh, says that it Nate by L.

'The party came through Meshed, Persia and Herat, all being armed but I do not know exactly what arms tftey have. Neither can I say exactly what the object of the party is in coming to Kabul. \^en they came out to Paghman to see the Amir a council -as formed consisting of lLs,»»nali» /coir's brother, iBBtoaMU&amp;an, taif son Oordor Uj orrci Yussf fisaf Khan, da ■ the Coomander-in-Chief and the SwmCL- ' h0 is called Loinab. This council assembled end receive the visiter, end after some time the Mir io.ne tn assembly, The first meeting -a. about tb, miceWOctober and was held within closed doors and lasted about five or six hours. There were all kinds of rumours as to what happened at the meeting but I do not know what actually took place. The second meeting took place a week later in similar circumstances. Nadir Khan the Commander-in- Chief told me that the party brought photographs of the Kaiser and the Sultan of Turkey but I could learn nothing further from him. After the return of the Amir to Kabul at the beginning of December, three or four other interviews have been accorded to the party in the 'Kothi Bilkusha', the new house built by the Amir. Thissecond party of visitors is accommodated in Baber, a suburb of Kabul. They are given food free and Government carriages are placed at their disposal. They do no work and have nothing to do with the Amir’s troops. But 1 recall that when they first arrived, a Turkish officer named Khaira Effendi who had been training the Amir's troops for many years, took out a party of troops on the pretence of training and met the German visitors on the road as they approached Kabul and accprded them a salute. The incident was reported to the Amir who dismissed the Turkish Instructor and disbanded the troops concerned for acting without his orders. The party appear to be well off and it is said that they brought some small presents for the Amir, such as watches. I do not know whether they brought moneymoney. It is said that they have a wireless telephone. The rumour in Court circles is that this party of Germans came to instigate the Amir to fight against the British and that the Amir formed the council I have described and included his brother and son, who are anti British, in it in order that all the members of it should share with him the responsibility for maintaining neutrality. i[This Document is the Property ot His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with unless required lor official nse.] ivO.L T TAHY - Eecyoher.
