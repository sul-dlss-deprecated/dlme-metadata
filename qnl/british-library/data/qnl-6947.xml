From Brevet Lieut.-Col. A. T. Wilson, Indi, t0 ™ nlss ™™ :v ^ Mesopotamia, Baghdad, to the Secretary of State for India, India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W. 1. 1 Sir o. 3 )/7a/19. Office of the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, T , , . 15th November 1919. r t if Tf t 9 enclose herewith an interesting and valuable note by Miss u. -L. .Hell, C.B.E., entitled Syria in 1919.' A few comments thereon in so far as it directly affects these territories are perhaps called for from me. 2. The fundamental assumption throughout this note and, I should add throughout recent official correspondence which has reached me from London, is that an Arab btate in Mesopotamia and elsewhere within a short period of years is a possibility, and that the recognition or creation of a logical scheme of Government on these lines, in supersession of those on which we are now working in Mesopo tamia, would be practicable and popular; in other words, the assumption is that the Anglo-French Declaration of November 8th, 1918, represents a practical line of policy to pursue in the near future. 3. My observations in this country and elsewhere have forced me to the convic tion that this assumption is erroneous,^ and though I am aware that in holding this view I differ from authorities and observers both at home and abroad who possess a breadth of vision and a wealth of experience to which I can lay no claim, I venture, probably for the last time, in my present capacity, to lay before His Majesty's Government the considerations which have led me to this conclusion. ^ I believe it to be impossible in these days to create a new sovereign Mohammadan State by diplomatic or administrative means out of the remnants of the Turkish Empire. 5. On local grounds because I believe the sentiments of the majority of Mohammadans in this country to be hostile to any practical interpretation of such a conception that we can devise. The warlike Kurds in Mesopotamia, who number nearly half a million, will never accept an Arab ruler, and they are potentially a powerful disruptive force. The Shiahs of Mesopotamia, who number about 1| millions, will accept no form of Arab Government based upon Sunni domination, and no form of Arab Government has yet been envisaged, except the Divisional and Provincial councils provisionally approved and now in process of formation, which would not involve a practical monopoly of power by Sunnis. As far as I Imow the Young Baghdadi party in Syria does not include amongst its members a single Shiah. i m i A , The Shiah Community would be reluctant to see the Turks return but a Turkish Administration would have less difficulty in asserting itself in the provinces than an Arab Government; the tradition of the past 200 years and the prestige oi the Sultanate and Caliphate are still strong. 6 If an Arab Government were constituted by decree of the League of Nations or bv other extraneous authority, and maintained for a period by our arms and our monev it is my belief that the Arab public at large would after a very few years actively favour the return of the Turks to the continuance of an amateur Arab Government The Jewish and Christian Communities, who number about 200,000, but have an influence disproportionate to their numbers, would probably adopt a similar attitude ■ such a demand would be most difficult to combat and might spread to nracticallv the whole of the former Turkish Empire. It is not improbable that the British commercial communities in Mesopotamia would lend such a movement their support, in their own immediate interests. 10 615 75 12/19 F.O.P. [180?]2 7 Three-quarters of the population of this country are tribespeople with no previous tradition of obedience to any Cxovernrnent except that^ of Constantinople, and with an almost instinctive hostility to Arab ' Eifendis in positions 01 authority; this hostility has been repeatedly demonstrated during the past two years in Mesopotamia. T therefore regard the creation of an Arab Government on the lines advocated by Yasin Pasha and Naji Bey as inconsistent with effective British Administration or indeed with effective control of any sort. For some years to come the appoint ment of Arab Governors or high officials, except in an advisory capacity, would involve the rapid decay of authority, law and order, followed by anarchy, and disorder, and the movement once started would not be checked; fanaticism not nationalism would become the ruling motive. Our financial stability depends on our ability to collect taxes, and if revenue-paying districts do not accept the Government that we set up we shall at once be bankrupt. We must, therefore, go slowly. Effective British Administration is vital to the continued existence of Mesopotamia as an independent State or administrative entity. 8. The disruptive forces at work all over the world are not less active in the Middle East than elsewhere; if we raise members of the Sharifian family to pre-eminence in the Arab countries we shall have before long to support them by force of arms against a formidable group of dissentients. Bin Saud, Bin Rashid, The Imam, The Idrisi, and other Arabian potentates will never recognise their supremacy and within a few years will be in active opposition; nor can the Sharifian family reckon on popular or democratic support. 9. To sum up, I believe that any form of Administration that we adopt based upon the conception of an Arab State is bound within a few years to result in the retrocession of a considerable part, if not the whole of Mesopotamia to the one Islamic Power which still commands general respect, viz., Turkey, unless we are prepared to utilize our armed forces to support an ineffective and unpopular indigenous administration against its internal and external enemies. 10. The probable effect of the creation of an Arab State on Persia also merits consideration. The fresh responsibilities which we have recently assumed in Persia depend in my view for their successful initiation and execution upon the existence of an effective British Administration in Mesopotamia. 11. To revert to the all-important Kurdish question, which fills much of our local horizon at present. It is very noticeable that Turkish propaganda during the past 12 months has been little in evidence amongst the Arab elements of Mesopotamia, but has been exceedingly active amongst the Kurds, w T ho number approximately from one-fifth of the total population of the three Wilayats. The repatriation of Christians, the repeated announcements of European Statesmen regarding an Armenian State, the action of European Powers at Smyrna and elsewhere, are all subjects which Turkey has not failed to turn to our disad vantage. The fresh graves of 5 Political Officers scattered along the Northern Border of the Mosul Wilayet testify to the success of this propaganda, nor have we yet seen its full development. 12. The atmosphere of resentment thus created has been favourable to the spread of Turkish pan-Islamic doctrines against which we have no effective antidote; our promises to Armenians, the arrests of Kurds by British Military Ofncers in S^ria, Aintab, Urfa, and elsewhere, Greek aggression in Smyrna, these are tacts which our qualified assurances to Kurds do not go far to counterbalance More recently the behaviour of French troops in Syria and elsewhere, and the pro- Armenian attitude of United States' representatives, have tended to harden popular leelmg against us as the representatives of an anti-Moslem League. Tn this atmosphere il is difficult if not impossible to create the fringe of jmtoriomous Kurdish States which has been authorised, and indeed until the Northern Boundary of Mesopotamia has been decided on, it is difficult if not impossible to give the local Chiefs such assurances as will iustifv them in throwing m their lot with us. &amp; 13. Our financial stake in this country is now so great that we are it seem' to me, committed, m our own national interests, to a degree of responsibility in relation to its affairs which must inevitably conflict sharply with the early creation even m name of an Arab Administration.3 follows : 1 - Capital SUnk 111 this coulltr y ^ the end of 1919 may be estimated as M 'SMUaneous assets, including Port (Hewett's report) £ Railw ;i ! / f 1 erred to Clvil Administration 2 000 000 Road to Sn mg aSSet .

At the present moment there are in Mesopotamia about— 200 British Officials of Civil Administration of whom 60 have their &lt;e ' lu&lt;li ° e ''''''i-- '- J 'I'' quasi military 200 British-born subjects in subordinate positions in the Civil Adminis- 80 ditti^ ^^h Mmriwraa^firms 1 ^ 8 and 0ther qUaSi military de P artm e^s). 50 European Foreign subjects. 4,000 to 5,000 Indians drawing over Rs. 200 in the employ of the Civil j dmmistration or of British firms or in business on their own account or m the employ of native firms. This excludes Labour Corps personnel. The presence of this large body of British and foreign subjects in the country involves Ilis Majesty s Government and its representative on the spot in ^reat responsibilities, and cannot be without effect upon the attitude to be adopted towards constitutional experiments. 17. The currency of this country consists of Indian Currency Notes to the value of about 20 crores of rupees and current rupees and small coin to the value of about 7 crores, together with about 4,000,000^. in Turkish gold which is scarcely in circulation. The reserve of coin which is held in Mesopotamia against the local current Indian Currency Notes is about ^ crore of rupees, a figure considerably below the safe minimum. t Any diminution in the authority of Government would shake the local financial edifice to- its foundations and would involve widespread disaster to British and local trade interests. 18. I readily recognise that there are many other factors besides those referred to above requiring the consideration of His Majesty's Government, many of which are necessarily beyond my purview. I have nevertheless ventured to place the foregoing local aspects of the question before Government in the hope that it may yet be possible for His Majesty's Government not to commit itself to a policy which must in the practically unanimous opinion of its Officers in this country and of the local public operate disastrously to the interests of this country. 19. I believe that the Divisional and Provincial Councils provisionally sanctioned and now in process of formation, if allowed to develop and assisted to assume a due share of local responsibility, will in a comparatively short space of time give the public at large that measure of participation and control of their local destinies which is necessary to ensure stability of the administration, and will serve h805 1 B 2as a training ground for the development of administrative talent which may e people of these countries ultimately to control their own destinies. Man} years will not elapse before the people of this Country will be at least as wel! equippec the people of Egypt or India now are for Western forms ol Government, but toi the present the population is so deeply divided by racial and religious cleavages, and the Shiah majority after 200 years of Sunni domination are so little accustomed to hold high office, that any attempt to introduce institutions on the lines desired by the advanced Sunni politicians of Syria would involve the concentration of power in the hands of a few persons whose ambitions and methods would rapidly bring about the collapse of organized Government. 20. Finally, if I may be permitted to make a personal reference, I beg leave to assure Government that by birth, by training and by temperament, I am in sympathy with a democratic as opposed to a bureaucratic conception of Government, and if I find myself unable to advocate the immediate introduction of a logical scheme of Arab Government into Mesopotamia it is because I believe that the results would be the antithesis of a democratic Government and that the creation and maintenance at this stage of an indigenous Arab Government is inconsistent with the changes which we are now endeavouring to introduce into the Governments of India and Egypt,,changes the necessity for which I fully recognise and with which 1 am broadly speaking in sympathy.' 1 have sent a copy of this letter with enclosures to the Government of India.

Their protest was effective; the loans were discontinued, to the bitter disappointment of the Moslems, who saw in the action of H.M.G. confirmation of their dread that Moslem interests would always hold an inferior place in our councils A permanent and increasing source of controversy is the language question. English, Arabic, and Hebrew are all three recognised as official languages in O.E.T. oouth, and all proclamations and regulations emanating from the central administra- tion are issued in triplicate. This is strongly objected to by the Moslems, who hold that Hebrew should have no official recognition. The Zionists have recently demanded that orders issued by the Jerusalem Municipality should be in Hebrew as well as in Arabic. The municipal body, not elected but appointed by the British Administration, is composed of some 12 to 14 members, of whom only two are Jews; the Mayor is an Arab notable. The Chief Administrator requested him toi comply with the demand of the Zionists, and the Mayor, with the municipal body almost solidly behind him, refused to do so. No solution of this deadlock had been reached, nor did either side show signs of giving way. If both parties would exercise forbearance, it is conceivable that the Zionists might obtain a good deal of what they want without forcing the Moslems to relinquish much of what they have got, but I could see no tendency to moderation among the latter, and no intention among the former to go forward with caution. Mr. Weizmann's representative in Jerusalem, Dr. Eder, rejects the idea that Zionism can be allowed to proceed slowly. It will be necessary, he maintains, to impress upon the Arabs that the Zionist regime can effect without delay great improvements in the- :L ' ' ' ' i-L The increase of material I noimtrv bv which Arabs will benefit no less than Jews, well -beine he regards as the most persuasive of arguments, and no doubt u,p to a point he fs right. He relies upon the close affinity oi the two civilizations and see* no reason wliy races so nearly akin should not merge completely, ibe immigrant j™U bring wiSi them the advantage of Western culture which by the tact of their being orientals, they are better fitted than Europeans to impait to the Arabs Thev will not attempt to turn tiheir Arab fellow citizens inu&gt; a bad imitation of Occidentals, and by working hand in hand with them along xamiliar lines they will ultimately extend a common civilization from Palestine to Mesopotamia. It is easy to criticize the exponent of such an ideal, not the least among obvious obiections being that the Western Jew does not as a rule set much store on the mentality of the Ea^t or wish to maintain it, but it would be correspondingly difficult to deny the enthusiasm and the high hopes for the realisation of a national existence which inspire men like 13r. Edcr. He is himseli an inteiestmg, if peiliaps a rare example of reversion to type, i hough a Jew by birth, his father was a Free thinker, and the son received in youth no religious training, nor any instruction in Hebrew. Not being endowed with a gift for languages, he has no intention of learning either Hebrew or Arabic. He has never previously been in the East, yet he and his wife have left their home in London and propose to settle pei manently in Jerusalem. Already Dr. Eder says that he feels at home among Arabs, admires their virtues and would be content to be as oriental as they. Every Moslem with whom I conversed touched on one of the points of Dr. Eder's argument, but in a different spirit. Their chief pre-occupation is that they will be unable to compete with the better education and greater skill of the Jewish immigrant from Europe. Some of the old-established Jewish families share this fear. Of the local Jew the Moslem is not afraid, nor would he refuse to him a share in Palestinian administration, always provided that the Jew held office in virtue of his being a Palestinian and not in virtue of his being a Jew. The Christians will be as little pleased as the Moslems at the advent of a Zionist State. A combined society has been formed with a Moslem president in Jerusalem and a Christian President in Jafa to oppose the absorption of the country by the Zionists. Anti-Zionism is the only bond which holds it together. There is one point on which Zionists and anti-Zionists are in agreement. Both are dissatisfied with the part which the British Government has played in the controversy, the Zionists because we have not given their cause sufficient support, the Moslems because we have supported it too much. This sentiment among Palestinian Moslems, coupled with a universal dislike of the partition of Syria between different mandatories, for which they hold us to be largely responsible, has given their opinions an anti-British tinge from which Faisal has benefited auto matically. Union with an independent Arab State would be preferred to a British mandate burdened with obligations towards the Jews, and it is significant that among Faisal's followers the Palestinians at Damascus are the strongest advocates of an Arab State without foreign control of any kind. But not even to avoid partition, nor as a possible escape from the threat of Zionism would a French mandate be acceptable to Mohammadans, either in Jerusalem or in Damascus. T reached Damascus about midnight on the 7th October, after a railway journey of some 16 hours from Ludd. Early next morning I walked through the bazaars to the Mosque of the Umayyads and received my first impressions of the Arab administration which had been in existence for 11 months. The most salient feature was that the town was many degrees dirtier than it had ever been in Turkish times. The bazaars were littered with vegetable and other refuse and secluded corners were no better than receptacles for filth of all descriptions. Not quite so easy to define was the sense that the political atmosphere had changed. Under the Turks every foreigner was a potential consul, and as such worthy of respect; under the existing regime he is an equal who, lest he should suppose himself to be anything better, must be kept in his place. In crowded quarters I found this process to be attended with inconvenience. The Chief Administrator of O.E.T., East, Ali Ridha Pasha Rikabi, is a Damascene. He is an ex-Turkish Official and has held posts of importance in Basrah, Baghdad, and elsewhere, but at the beginning of the war the Ottoman Government regarded him with suspicion as a member of the Young Arab Party He maintains unimpaired, as chief officer of the Arab State under the Amir Faisal, the traditions of the Turkish service. He is inefficient, corrupt, and courteous. He is believed to be an upholder of complete Arab independence, but except for an7 ardent hostility to the Frenph h* ssr '• ~ i I ■ • . 1 ext reinely uncertain Ohief of t^Milftaxy Counoii anCl YasiT p' ^ difierent calibre, is Yasin Pasha class. lli s family came originallv from i, 1 ' 1 '' 11 'I ? ^bdadi of the lower middle therefore be of Turkish! though not of nn neigh 1 bourJlood 0 f Kirkuk, and to may employ of Muhammad Pasha Daghl^ Sn wh^^ , V 18 father was the teei. absent from Baghdad in ' Turkic v. ; i n ' 18 between 35 and 40 has is a late adherent to the Irab cause H. y SerV1Ce for the last te n years He the occupation of Damascus and was lefT^hlv^T 8 m tl i' e Turkl sb army until retreated.

The extremists are convinced that British admunstration m the Iraq is and must remain the opponent of political liberty and 11 s a British mandate no attempt will be made to set up responsible Arab government They say that they receive innumerable complaints about existing conditions from correspondents in Mesopotamia and from Mesopotamians who, according to them, are coming over in great numbers in order to escape from the tyranny of British Rule. The more moderate members of the League are equally certain that grave discontent exists among all the classes in the 'Iraq and they assured me, in particular, that the Shi'ah tribes were bitterly hostile to us, but in conversing with me they laid the blame on our native officials and police. When I asked what kind of people were coming from Mesopotamia to Syria in the numbers described I never elicited any definite answer. It is probable that they are chiefly ex-Government employes who have not found a place under the existing administration, and that their number is exaggerated. As regards the allegation that the Shi'ah tribes are disaffected, it is universally denied in Baghdad and by the local officers who are in touch with the tribes in question. I understood that the charge made against our native officials was due to a desire on the part of my interlocutors not to wound my susceptibilities by attributing blame to British Officers. If it is true that the native officials are at fault, it is difficult to see how any relaxation of direct British control can mend matters- Chief among the grievances which were cited to me is the continuance of a military form of administration, which is indeed at the root of all complaints. A good deal of capital is made out of the retention of commandeered houses in Baghdad, as well as out of the banishment last February of certain persons who were sowing dissension in the interests of the Turks—if I remember rightly these were 7 in number and all but one were Turks and ex-Turkish officials, but when8 I mentioned that the bamshments had been made at . the 1 Zadaffnd magnates, I was met with the rejoinder that families like the ^aqib Zadah and the Jamil Zadah are of no account with the younger group oi politicians There has recently been a split in the Ahd al Jraqi by three Baghdadis, all of whom I met. Isma'il Haqqi, a man of about 35, was a divisional commander in the Arab army and is now head of the Technical Department. Subhi Ha im who may be 5 years younger, is Mudarns al Mukakim al Askanyah, ^alar al Dm of the Bait Mamun, aged about 25, is in civil employment in Damascus Ihese three told me that they deeply regretted the universal discontent with British rule which they believed to exist in Mesopotamia. They recognised that the country cannot do without our help and protection, and they offered to come themselves to Baghdad to serve as intermediaries between ourselves and the inhabitants. Tney would expect to be given office as they would be obliged to reliquish the positions they hold in Syria. They expressed a hope that Sir Percy Cox would return to Mesopotamia as High Commissioner when civil government was instituted. I was told by all Political Officers in Syria that they believed from what they heard from the 'Iraqis who are with Faisal that 'the appointment of Sir Percy would do more than any other measure to allay their mistrust. The Amir Zaid said the same thing ' He too spoke to me with great earnestness of Mesopotamian grievances, his chief source of information being the reports brought back by Naji Beg buwaidi. I do not think that the Mesopotamian League is a negligible factor. As long as the Arab State continues it will carry on an active propaganda which might at any moment raise difficulties in our path, and if, on the withdrawal of troops from Syria, disturbances occur in that country it will be the first object of the more extreme among its members to advertise their grievances by inciting Mesopotamian malcontents to open revolt against a British mandate. Judging by the experience of last January it would be impossible to say with confidence that efforts in this direction would meet with no success in Baghdad, Karbala, and Najaf. It must always be remembered that in the rural districts it has not up to now produced any apparent results. At the same time I feel certain that the propaganda proposed by the cave would be of no use to us. I was favourably impressed by Isma'il Haqqi, but, to the best of my belief, neither he nor his friends have any personal influence in Baghdad, while if they took office under us their opinions would at once be discounted. With Yasin Pasha I had two long conversations. I asked him to explain to me what his programme would be for the future government of 'Iraq. He replied that he would give me his personal views, but that he thought we should find it necessary to consult all leading Arab politicians, especially those who had had experience of self-government in Syria. It was obvious that Mesopotamia could not for the next 10 years be left without foreign guidance, and equally obvious that no foreign nation except England had any claim to act as adviser. In that respect the country had a great advantage over Syria. No one gives anything for nothing, and if we provided for immediate requirements we should ask for guarantees. This is to say r we must for the present control the administration. Economic developments would be easy and rapid. He refused to believe that Great Britain would not be in a position to furnish unlimited capital, and he brushed aside the objection that the local population was not sufficiently numerous to carry out the vast scheme which he contemplated. An Arab Amir must be set up as head of the State and whatever existing opinion might be, Abdullah would sweep the board the moment he appeared in Mesopotamia. It was true that Sir Percy Cox was at present better known there than any of the sons of the Sharif, and even possible that he had a greater name, but that was only because he had lived and worked in the country for 3 years. He should be appointed High Commissioner. The Amir would be assisted by an advisory council appointed by himself with the advice of the High Commissioner. This council would consist mainly of British officials, but there was no reason why suitable Arabs, if such were to be found, should not find a place upon it. The ministers would all be Arabs appointed by the Amir with the advice of the council The country was not ready for representative institutions; nevertheless in the provinces an Arab Wali, with a British Adviser, might well be assisted by an elected majhs, it being clearly understood that the powers of the majlis were strictly limited to local matters. These councils would train the people in the uses of repre sentation and in time lead up to a central elective assembly. It was probable that there was not yet in Mesopotamia a sufficient number of trustworthy and capable men to fill the high offices of the State, but that difficulty would be met by calling in9 Ejen from outside. ?^S^a£S«}?.ss^SS55 wn 11 ! m was a matter of vital importance 0 uT' 18 , pur P? sel y neglected educa- wou d be content to leave both soverXntv « „ h ^ S ° aS to sa &gt;' tllat he would provide the young men of the % ri ^ admlIllstratl on m our hands if we Ssi a nT n a /r ration ^^« I n^f I 5&gt;K» ed ^ ti0,, ' whicl i wouTd scnools in iurkish times: no matter how ♦i.,-, P s - /'ere were plenty of them and sought to improve them eraduallv Witt, f 6 ' w . e . should hav e continued system of primary and econdarTsS .Tl to estaM ish a good funds the origin' of whkh he did nS snedfv^ / 'iV t0 fo ? nd and endo w (with university training.

The troops are paid about 31 a month, and it is not unusual for men to desert in handfuls, whole villages at a time after every pay day. No one supposes that the Arab army would face regular troops : it is not even believed that the Damascus garrison, 2,000 strong, would stand up to the Bedmn if they were to come in force after we withdraw. It is a reflection upon asm s adinmistrative capacity that he should not have done better with the army Me has had large sums of secret service money at his disposal, but these he has used m propaganda, reserving a heavy percentage for his own pocket. The Arab leaders know that the army will be no good to them against the French, and they rely on guerilla warfare and local levies. The whole country is armed to the tune of an average of two rifles per man, with ammunition sufficient to last a year. At a. moderate estimate there are 75,000 rifles in Damascus alone, but in and round Aleppo arms are said to be less numerous. Damascenes are exceedingly anxious at the prospect which lies before them. At the end of the year the subsidy to the Sharif will cease and the financial position of the Arab Government will be extremely precarious, but even if it can contrive to keep itself in existence and succeed in preventing open disorder it is anticipated that the French in the coast provinces will foster disturbances, either by the con tinuance of propaganda within the Arab State, or by provocative acts towards Moslems in the area under their administration, and that on the first breach of the peace their troops will cross the frontier on the plea of restoring order. Christians of all sects believe that massacre is inevitable, and their fears are shared by most of the British officers in Syria. During the last 50 years the breach between Moslems and Christians had gradually closed; since 1860 massacre had been unknown in JSyria until the 28th February of this year, when some Armenians were massacred [1805] 0i. hv rpoent events, especially by in Aleppo.

It is impossible to en} • livino 1 is that of nervous expectation in which Christians and Moslems alike ■Atri'i rrh roiin-inns conflict. The Greek Catholic lati iaicn. known and trusted for years, told me that in of British soldiers kept the people fom those which invariably accompanies religious conflict. The Greek (a i 1 , ^ Monseigneur Qadhi, a man whom I have known and trusted for yeais, or ' the Christian Quarter only the presence of British soldiers kept the peop e nTtl )s attacks of panic which spread like a contagion to the Moslems and hrm^ ttu arms in self-defence against the imagined danger. No one who is famiJiar cti iilo 111 scl L-tl&amp;ltJllLc cigdiUbL Liir: grim insanity of massacre can fail to put an ominous interpretation upon tne^igns of the times, and if it is true, as I believe it is, that the initial incitement must a 1 \\ a} s be supplied from outside the populace itself; there are grounds for sharing seigneur Qadhi's conviction that it will not be lacking. ' The chord of fanaticism, he said, ' has a greater resonance than the chord of nationalism. The extreme party will reach the time when they can no longer play on nationalist sentiment ; already it is almost worn out. Most Damascenes are tired of the long uncertainty which directly affects their prosperity. When they refuse to respond to the demands made on their patriotism, no alternative will remain but to revive the old religious hatred.' I did not add that Faisal himself, in one of his less responsible moments, had declared that if the nations of Europe attempted to separate Palestine from Syria he would proclaim a Jihad. The Patriarch's description of Damascene feeling was confirmed by all the local men with whom I conversed. Comfortable, ease-loving Damascus is tired of a Government which is perceptibly worse than that of the Turks. Under the Arab regime there is less public security; the law-courts are a trifle more venal, the high officials no less corrupt than their predecessors, though this is not a source of serious complaint, for nothing else is expected of high official?;. Worst of all, trade lan guishes. In'the mists of personal inconvenience Faisal's romantic halo is growino* dim. It is quite possible that Damascus if left to itself would accept the hated trench mandate if it would bring with it an assurance of peace and quiet and reviving prosperity. Indeed in the safe seclusion of the haram I was told as much by mv old friend the head of the noble and wealthy Kilani family The more ambiUous among the magnates have another grievance. They dislike the upstart band of Baghdadis and Palestinians who are in authority over them, partly no doubt It Yfl r 610 S f are m S ^ h s P oil as ma y be available, partly from an uneasy feeling that the aliens—for at this point the conception of Arab unity beoomes obscured—are in fierce pursuit of an exaggerated political ideal for the attainment of which or on the off chance of its attainment thev are nrenared m =»+ Q province m a blaze.

Kamil Qassab and Hashim al Atasi called on me m Damascus; the former is an Alim with ^ administrative experience, the latter a capable looking man who was a Qaim- maqam under the lurks. Both are violently anti-French and both, like Dr. Shah- bandar, expressed their conviction that a native government, different from the present one comd carry on administration; but not without foreign advice in finan cial and technical matters. I should judge my friend Dr. Shahbandar to be a wiser man than any of these, the more so because he conceded sorowfully that an Arab government such as he had in mind must at the last resort accept French assistance rather than fall into the bottomless pit to which its unguided steps would lead it. Abdul Rahman Shahbandar has not given up all hope that America could be induced to accept the mandate, and this was the general delusion among those Syrians who had definitely made up their mind that we should refuse it if it were offered to us; in the first fortnight of October they were not very numerous. He thought that he and his friends had an untried arrow in their quiver, and he intended to go to the United States \Afith two others, one of whom was a Professor at the Beyrut College, and lay the Syrian ease before the American nation. I gave him a private letter of introduction to Senator Lodge, together with my blessing-—both for what they were worth—and after he had left I devoted some moments to considering whether the tour of the American Commissioners last July had not been on the whole the most criminal deception which had been practised on the Syrians. My Damascene friends were anxious to show me some of the things which they had made themselves^—that phrase of one's childhood exactly fits my impression of their gratification at seeing institutions grow up under their own hands. I was therefore invited to inspect the Madrasat Banat al Shuhadah, the School for the Daughters of Martyrs, where orphans are educated whose fathers fell fighting in Faisal's army. It is run on private subscriptions by a committee of ladies presided over by Naziq bint al 'Abid, a girl of 21 belonging to one of the best families of Damascus. She is a niece of 'Izzat Pasha, who was the all-powerful Secretary of 'Abdul Hamid for a period of years, during which he earned great wealth and the bitter recriminations of the C.IJ.P when it came into the saddle. In spite of their threats 'Izzat managed to escape to Europe, where he had already lodged a respect able part of his fortune. Sitt Naziq was educated in a mission school at Beyrut, speaks English, and is the most advanced lady in Damascus. She aM her mother sat unveiled among a company of men, a select company, but none of them related to the 'Abid family. Another Mohammadan lady of the committee was present, and she also was unveiled. The school building was admirably clean and airy, the sani tary arrangements left nothing to be desired, and the teaching, so far as I could judge from listening to a lesson in each class, was cheerful and intelligent The mistresses were mostly Christians educated in Beyrut and speaking fairly good English. Besides the orphans there were an equal number of girls of good Damascene tamilies who pay for the education they receive. These girls 16 to 18 years old, were not seen by the men of the partv. Girls and children were brought out into the large garden which surrounds the house to sing patriotic songs^ In one of a^chorus oi the elder girls addressed the orphans, reminding each one that her father died in the cause nf liberty and bidding her never to forget that she was hint ul Arabi, while the Children replied that they would never forget their birth, nor King Husam who fnncrht for their race nor finallv (this stanza was speciallv prepared for the American Commlsion) pSnt Wilson who laid down-save the mark-the principles of freedom, ^ ^ place was not quite s0 satisfactory. It was the municipalmuseum, which is in process of being installed in the Madrasat Malik al Adil. The repairs to the building had not been completed or the exhibits arranged nor aid anyone, not excepting the curator, know anything about them, though they were familiar local finds, some of which were of merit. Across the street is the library of the Malik al Dhahir, one of the most beautiful monuments in the town. It also is to form part of the Museum buildings. The pages torn from Kufic Qurans, sole relics of the treasures of the mosque which were rifled for the German Emperor in 1898, were still, as I remembered them before the war, folded across and stuffed into a corner of one of the bookshelves. But if Mithraic reliefs, Roman glass or Kufic parchments were not receiving the care which a European curator would have lavished on them, the pride and joy of the exhibitors could not h'ave been surpassed. The institution was, as they said—and in more senses than one—genuinely Arab. Far more remarkable, to my mind, than any Arab institution was the existence of the committee of ladies which directed the school. Damascus, up to the time of the war, was very backward as regards the position and activities of women, and nothing resembling a philanthropic committee of this kind would have been con sidered within the bounds of possibility, either by the men or by the women them selves. Even now the Moslem women of Jerusalem hold that they have advanced further along the path of emancipation than their sisters in Damascus. During last winter a society of ladies, under the presidency of the wife of the Mayor, Kadhim al Husaini, and of the Sitt Nasirah Haddad, has organized relief work among the poor in Jerusalem. The Bait Husaini is one of the best families in the town, while the Sitt Nasirah is the widow of one of the Khalidis, a family as respectable as the Husainis, and on his death married a well-known barrister. She has been assiduous in paying personal visits to the houses of those who were in need of relief, and her example had been followed by the daughter of the Mufti. It is a New Jerusalem in which well-born ladies visit the poor. The Sitt Nasirah complained of the great drawback of not being able to interview men freelv if her work required; in this respect she was somewhat more restricted than the' Sitt Naziq. The next'genera tion, she said, would never wear the veil. Although she disclaimed any wish to take part in politics, she had just come from Damascus, where she had presented the Amir Faisal with a small gift, a picture of the Haram, on behalf of the ladies of the society The episode is not without significance, for it shows that Faisal is the natural recipient of homage in the eyes of Palestinian Arabs, and also that Moslems, m respect of their womenfolk, have embarked on the slippery slope which admits of no haJtmg-place between domesticity and active participation in politics. The passage will be rapid, though it will not be completed without a period of ffreat diversity. It so happened that the very next woman T saw in Jerusalem after the . itt Nasirah was the wife of one of the notables (the Bait Nashashibi), sister-in-law ? an eX ; , P uj 7 ! She had begun a perfectly respectable career as a slave girl in the thf w • ^ l ' where T she had s P ent ^ years, to which she looked back as ^e happ'est she had known. It would have been little short of an insult to suggest w . .fVi S ^ uld V1Slt . a * tarvin g Peasant, and she would have been overcome by unforgettable^ self-reproach if a strange man had seen her unveiled. Midway between the two stood the sister of one of my Damascene friends, Izz-ud-Din Saiujiyah who is betrothed to the Sitt Naziq. I went to a small luncheon party at well over £ T H invited ^ Tazi ^ d one or two men - The sister, a stout lady, was plrsuaded to sTrwTfw 'Tv, d but after much coaxing ste was persuaded to sit down to table with us, in my honour.

His Turkish training has stamped him Turkish, the military Teutonized Turk, not the efiendi. He speaks moderately good English, but prefers to talk in Arabic He is trenchant and dogmatic in giving expression to his opinions. He met me at the point of the sword, but when he found that I wished to play audience, not adversary he became rather more expansive and ended by being almost cordial. It was not,' however, a genuine cordiality, nor would it be safe to say what aspect or mood of his is genuine. Wary, aggressive, and alert, he was the most forcible personality I encountered. He is a self-made man, but he has by no means completed a task which is also his first preoccupation. There is no room for his ambitions in any Arab pro vince unless, as would probably meet his views, it were to remain an integral part of the Ottoman Empire. If, or when, the Syrian State founders, Yasin will betake himself elsewhere, carrying his bat. But wherever he goes it will not be to Meso potamia under a British mandate, nor, with the best will in the world, could we make use of him. Next to Yasin comes Ja'far Pasha al 'Askari. He is Governor of Aleppo, but he happened to be at Damascus while I was there. A Baghdadi, he has about the same social status as Yasin; his father was Mukhtar of one of the quarters of the town. He was educated partly in Germany and speaks seven languages fluently—Arabic, Turkish, Persian, Kurdish, German, French, and English. He was taken prisoner in the Western Desert of Eoypt, and has fought with the Sharif's Army from a very early stage of the rising. He has run Aleppo since the beginning of March and done it well, though the moving spirit of his administration is said to be Naji Beg Suwaidi. He is a man very little over 30, tall and fat, genial, jovial, excellent company, and as bitterly anti-French as Yasin, to whom in other respects he bears no resemblance. He has the singular merit of honesty. I cannot call to mind any man of his calibre in Mesopotamia, and it is my belief that we ought to be able to find a place for him; but, like all 'Iraqis who might come to us from Syria, he would have to be handled with great tact, for in Aleppo he has had complete independence. As Governor of a big Mesopotamian district, if such posts were subsequently to be created, he should do well. My impression is that he would be amenable to control if it were exercised without too much show of authority. I did not see Nuri Pasha Sa'id, who, according to report, is on the same level as [18051 0 i—— ■mm H Yasin and Ja'far. His father was an accountant of Baghdad. He was in Basrah at the time of the occupation of that town, volunteered for service with the Sharif, and was one of the earliest of his adherents. He is said to be the best of them, a moderate man of considerable ability. He was in Europe with raisal. _ Mahmud Pasha Mukhlus, divisional general, has the reputation of being an excellent soldier, but is without other attainments. He comes of a small Mosul familv, but his mother was of the 'Ubaid tribe. He was an otficer in the Turkish army and gave himself up after the battle of bhu. aibah. He arrived m the Mijaz immediately after the rebellion began and boasts that he and Mr. Lawrence were the first officers of the Sharif s army. He is about 30. I found him friendly and pleasant, but he is said to be fanatical, and he belongs to the extreme group of the Ahd al 'Iraqi. He would be difficult to use here, but I had the impression that it would be worth while to make the attempt, if he would come to us. For he is a man, and the sex is less numerous than is commonly supposed. 'Abdullah Dulaimi, another Mosuli of about the same age and social standing as Maulud, is a colonel in the Arab army. He also belongs to the extreme party. He is a great friend of Zaid, but Faisal does not like him and thinks that he has a bad moral influence over his brother. He has been given permission to visit his family in Mosul and at Zaid's request I offered to take him with me from Aleppo, but though he expressed great gratitude, he did not join me there. I had several visits from Ibrahim Hilmi, a Baghdadi of 25 or rather younger, editor in Damascus of a paper called ' Lisan al 'Arab.' His knowledge of Arabic is so scholarly that Pere Anastase, one of the best judges, tried to induce him to return to Baghdad to assist him when he was editing our vernacular paper. He is pro-British, and has published in the Lisan a number of articles favourable to our administration. He discussed the possibility of his paper's obtaining a circulation with us and urged that such advocacy as his, coming from Syria and not from the Government press in Baghdad, would make an impression. He is probably not without hope that we would ultimately subsidize the Lisan. He hinted that he would be willing to undertake editorial work in Baghdad if we would offer him high enough terms, but his requirements would not be modest. He is however a capable young man. I sent for a former Baghdad acquaintance, Rashid al Hashimi, who left us abruptly last autumn. The reason for his departure, he explained, was that one of his brothers was arrested by G.H.Q. on a suspicion, which proved groundless, of connection with the Turks. Rashid took alarm and made off. He and another brother, Muhammad, belong to the violently anti-European section of the Ahd al 'Iraqi. Rashid is a secretary of Yasin's, and is said to be in the confi dence of the latter. Some weeks ago, in a public speech, he prophesied that the Tigris would run with blood; whose blood was not specified, but since it could only be Arab or British, 'Ali Ridha Pasha Rikabi judged the phrase to be inexpedient and condemned Rashid to a short term of imprisonment. His connection with us began in 1916, when he came to us in Basrah as a Nationalist fugitive from the Turks. We made him an allowance till after the fall of Baghdad, in spite of the fact that he had, under pressure from the Turks, written a violently anti-British article in a Baghdad paper before he fled to Basrah. He subsequently failed to obtain an appointment under the British Administration. Never of stable mind, he appeared to me to have become scarcely responsible. I met other Damascenes who had been fugitives with us in Basrah. Faiz al Ghusain, for whom Sir Percy Cox had a great liking, is now practising as an advocate. He is a reasonable and a moderate man. 'Izz-ud-Din al Sarujiyah, who for some months edited the vernacular paper in Basrah, holds a post in the Department of Public Instruction in Damascus. He is engaged to the Sitt Naziq al 'Abid. The British I.O., Captain Brunton, considers him to be untrustworthy. He was used for intelligence purposes and was found to be intriguing with all parties and furnishing intelligence impartially to all, including the French. I cannot set this information aside, though I should have thought, from what I know of him, that 'Izz ud Din could not hope to find sufficient scope under a French regime. His interests are, however, mainly literary and scholastic. Another Damascene, Muhammad Kurd 'Ali, whom I have known for a great' number of years as a prominent member of the Young Arab Party and Editor of the ' Muqtabas,' a paper which was constantly being suspended, has an unpalatable war record. ^ He carried on a violent anti-Arab and anti-British campaign in the ' Muqtabas ' until the fall of Damascus, when he became as violently anti-Turkish.V befits ^ grou ^ Instruction and his brother Ahirmd pdit« a ' M f k ^fP aitnieil t of Public unimpeachable Arab Lntfments Muqtabas which is adorned with fcSf.T V 1 !

Nuri comDl^ tn ^P Amarat raids the last, according to him, having been led by Mahrut ibn Fahad nnTlw tv, 0 g u St - He said th at Mahrut had carried off a number of camels and that these must be returned by Fahad before any definite negotiations could i ^ ' It was un . se emly, he observed, that tribes in alliance with the English t . tV enmity with one another, and he thought that we should force Fahad h^H n t f PeaCe &gt;: r ^ e adde d that we had no reason for gratitude to Fahad, who had not done a hand s turn for us, not even m the simple matter of dislodging jaimi, and he hinted that we had supplied him with money and arms to attack the Kuwallah. I replied that subsidies on our side of the desert fell far short of those given by the Arab Government (Nuri gets 2,500Z. a month), and that I did not believe that official intervention could stop raiding until the Beduin turned into cultivators, a^ period which was still some way off. At which Nuri laughed and said it was about as near as the end of the world, and that if we could do nothing with Fahad he would organize a combined raid of Ruwallah and Huwaitat which would settle the score. The turn of affairs at Jauf may delay this project, and I understand that Pahad's account of the raids of the last few months bears no resemblance to that of Nuri. If, as I believe, we should maintain a strict unconcern with desert warfare which we are unable to prevent, and desert frontiers which we cannot delimit, neither should we use desert quarrels to serve our aims In the long run it will not pa}' - , for we shall involve ourselves in responsibilities which it must be our object to avoid. Nuri was right in thinking that Fahad has now little hold over the sections of his tribe. Incidentally Jazza'ibn Mijlad of the Dahamshah is now in Nuri's tent, but with few followers. The Beduin have never held so high a position with the Government of Syria as they hold now. Faisal dare not deprive himself of their support. He subsidizes the Ruwallah and the Huwaitat heavily because of their fighting qualities ; to the Bani Sakhr he gives nothing, although they hold the first desert stretch of the Hajj Railway, because he does not think that they will provide him with men. I should say that from the Ruwallah he will get nothing for which he does not pay exhorbitantly, and the Huwaitat are too far off to be of much service. Nuri has a life-long experience in the arts of self-protection, the only arts to which he has devoted his attention. In these he excels. When the subsidy diminishes Nuri's enthusiasm for the Arab cause will melt away. That period at least cannot be deferred till the end of the world. It will occur when our subsidy to the Sharif is discontinued, i.e., at the beginning of next year. I have already mentioned the Greek Catholic Patriarch, Dimitri Qadhi. In a Ion? and confidential talk he spoke very frankly about the French. He has lived for many years in Paris and speaks French admirably. He said that his own leanings were towards the French Government, since his community had in the past received innumerable benefits at its hands, but he greatly blamed the conduct of the French during the last eleven months, and was unsparing in his criticism of M. Picot, whom he pronounced to be wanting as much in capacity as in tact. f' 18051 D 216 With the recall of Picot and the appointment of y^ivela^dM should be fundamentally changed; it is regrettable t la . pro-French, A year ago practically'all the Christians, Orthodox ^uzes. and together with 25 per cent, of the Moslems.

The - n ui a A has recently been deprived of his civil, as apart from his military turn ions, oj account of scandals which the French local authorities could not o\erlook. . available funds have been used for propaganda, which goes far to explain the Mnii comings of the administration. The arrival of the American Commissioners ga\e a fresh impetus to political reward and punishment, and their departure was the signal for reprisals against all who had favoured a mandate other than that of France. A well-known Beyruti Christian of the Orthodox Church told me that at the beginning the French had very fair cards in their hands, not the worst of them being the natural jealousy of Damascus which is felt in Beyrut. Beyrutis have no desire to be mn by Damascus—they consider themselves far more advanced socially and economically. An independent Arab State offers them no particular attractions, nevertheless propagandists of the extreme Damascene party are now getting a hearing. I travelled from Beyrut to the Raiyaq junction with some French officers, one of whom T discovered to be the Arabist, Dr. Mardrus. They all, and Dr. Mardrus more emphatically than the rest, condemned the policy which had been pursued by France. There was scarcely a French officer in Syria, they said, who did not wish to leave the country and never return to it; they failed to understand what their Government was about. Dr. Mardrus observed that if France hoped to make profit out of Syria she would be disappointed—the Arabs would see to that. The political colour of Aleppo struck me as being somewhat different from that ot Damascus. There is something of the same tinge of jealousy of the Baghdad group in the mmd of the local magnates, but at lea^t the Arab Administration however composed, has done better for Aleppo than for Damascus- to the casual observer the greater cleanliness of the town is at once evident.

Ihsan Beg speaks fairly good GeriW 7 i spent an hour with another very wealthy Aleppine, Fnad Bev al 'Adli His political views were not of great interest, being highly coloured by a personal grievance. He is hostile to the Arab administration because he is being turned out of certain Waqf lands, wrongfully seized by him during the war. A national, no less than a foreign government does not acquire unmitigated merit by acts of j lJ.ol/lL&gt;0, The famous 'Alim, the Shaikh al Zarkah, on whom I called, expressed his indignation at our having given the Arabs so little help. Our obligations towards the t rench in this respect weighed for nothing with him, nor do they weigh with any bynan. The Shaikh al Zarkah, now an extremely old man, has been^treated with great consideration by Faisal, who holds his reputation in high esteem. He was the first Qadhi after the occupation, but quarrelled with Shukri 'Ayyubi and resigned. ^ I saw too Eauf Bey, Commandant of Gendarmerie, who is a Baghd?/li of a Kubaisah family. He came with other Baghdadi officers, and the talk was too general to be interesting. Captain Sir E. Paul, who has been lent to the Arab Government to organize Gendarmerie and police, speaks well of the former and cannot condemn the latter too strongly. Sir Robin's immediate superior in Aleppo is a pro-Turk, who allows him no hand in executive matters. The head of the department is Haddad Pasha, a Christian, of whom everyone speaks well—he was not in Damascuis when I was there, having accompanied Faisal to London—but orders from Damascus are apt to lose efficiency before they reach Aleppo. With Naji Beg Suwaidi I had long conversations. He explained his reasons for resigning the post of Mayor of Baghdad, which he held for a few days in July. He said that he had been treated with great courtesy by those in authority, but that he had perceived at once that the time had not arrived when he could profitably to himself or to us work under the Mesopotamian administration. As long as Military rule obtained, the government of the country must be out of focus. He bad taken advantage of the postponement of his scheme for an elective municipality to offer his resignation, but his underlying feeling was a conviction that we could not as yet put real responsibility into native hands, and without it he would not hold office. When Civil Administration was instituted he would be delighted to come back if we desired, and he expressed a fervent hope that Sir Percy Cox would be in charge. He did not mention that his wish to meet the American Commissioners had anything to do with his resignation; it is however the general impression in Baghdad that this was its primary cause—a specific instance of the disturbing hopes which the Commission aroused. , t. • u It was also a misrepresentation of facts to describe his scheme as having been postponed. A Committee to consider his proposals had been sanctioned by the Civil Commissioner, although these proposals were drawn up after a very inadequate study of the subject. Naji left Baghdad before the Committee had had time to18 meet Naii Beg assured me that all classes in the Iraq are now against us. I ajn not now concerned with the truth or falsehood of this view, but merety with the fact that it is held in Syria, and has created there a teelmg untnendl^ to us. ^J 1 b strongly in favour 'of an Amir of the Sharifian House for Mesopotamia and looks SluirtL obvious selection. He thinks son.e form « J^t've ^bly essential and dismisses Yasin's objections to it on the ground that Yasm has scarcely anv acquaintajice with the 'Iraq. His own suggestion would be an assembly composed partly of elective native members and partly of British a ^ yis ® r s by us. The idea does not uommend itself as a general proposition but 1 do not know how Naji Beg would work it out in detail. The object at which he would aim in constructing a Civil Government was that it should always be the native official w jo dealt directTy with the native and for the present, always the British official who had tfie final control, and though I am fully aware that m fact the native, when.it is a question of official business, prefers to deal direct with the Englishman, nevertheless it is difficult to see how an indigenous Government can be set up except on the lines indicated by Naii. He is pleasant and outgoing, a good talker, with excellent manners. He has the confidence of the British Political Officers m Aleppo who have seen his work. They say that he and Ihsan are by far the most capable and hard working men in the district, and thiat if Ja far s administration has been more successful than any other it is because he has had Naji behind him. Naji never spares himself, is at his office morning, noon, and night, and shirks no expenditure ot pains. . _ . „ Before I left Aleppo, I had a long talk with Dr. Altouuyan, whom I knew irom of old. He is an Armenian doctor of considerable reputation who owns a small hospital besides having a large private practice. He remained in Aleppo during the war,, and did useful medical work for the Turks. He laid before me the Armenian programme for the future of their race. He regarded it as representing a simple piece of justice and has no doubts as to the possibility of carrying it out. He looks forward to the provision of a national home for Armenians which may or may not cover all the wilayats in which Armenians are, or were, to be found. As a beginning, the district from Cilicia to Sivas would be sufficient, and over this restricted area he hopes that France wll be induced to take the mandate if America refuses. Already expectation that the U.S.A. will be responsible for the welfare of the whole of the Armenian wilayets is fading. In the republic of Van he thinks it is our duty to leave British troops, or if we cannot do that, to supply the local Armenian population with plentiful ammunition. He did not seem to have any recent information from Van. If the French take the mandate up to Sivas they must send troops into the country, but in any part of Armenia which may fall under a foreign mandate he believes that foreign troops would be needed only for the first years, after which time Armenians would be ready to defend their own rights and preserve order. He reckons that 2,000,000 Armenians now in South Russia and the Balkans, or refugees elsewhere, would return the moment a foreign mandate is arranged. These immigrants would alter the balance of population and put the Armenians in the majority. The government must be entirely in their hands; for the first decade no Moslem must be allowed office. Armenian must be the official language and if subsequently Kurds or others are permitted to hold office they must learn that tongue. The standard of education is much higher among Armenians than among Kurds, thanks to the instruction which almost all Armenians have received at Mission schools; they are therefore more fitted already to take charge of the Administration. If neither France nor the U.S.A. .will accept the mandate, he would be content with any Christian Power, however feeble—Italy or Greece—rather than the Turks. The one thing that is excluded is that Armenia should be placed again under the Ottoman. He laid stress on the point that north of Diyarbakr the Kurds are mostly Qizil Bash, not Moslems, and that they have always shown themselves friendly to Armenians. If there must be a Kurdish Pro vince, let it be a strip from east of Urfah running south of Diyarbakr. He said also that local Armenians felt very bitterly that we' have not fulfilled our obligations towards them since the occupation. Refugees who are repatriated to 'Aintab or Mar'ash find that all their possessions are in the hands of the Turks, and are given no help towards getting them back. Nor have any steps been taken to punish those who were chiefly responsible for the massacres, though this point formed a provision in the treaty. It is interesting, but not encouraging, to compare Dr. Altounvan's programme with the reports of Ma jor Noel. I have attempted to oive a picture of the Svria which I saw in 1919. No doubt it is a very summary outline, for one cannot see much in a fortnight, but I had at19 war. 8^1900! whe^ l' wa^fir ^ quaintance . with the country before the sprouted and withered more than'onee Tl,^ i Nat i onali st hopes have after the Constitution of 1908 fnll 1 'f tllr( J n gh a period of rapid growth much talk and a CsSr^m cL ornurttt ay alm0St aS ra P id - In ^ of progress had been made .,1,1 I patriotic organizations and societies no real 1914 that K remember i learln g from Muhammad Kurd 'Ali in May Government.

The Arabs themselves would have been less nmicult to handle. A year of irresponsible authority has not benefited the country nor made it easy for those who have been in power to aceept such control as many of hern recognize that they need. Here the Arab Government is not entirely to blame. JKaisal has repeatedly asked Lord Allenby for advisers, and Lord Allen by has as often been obliged to refuse on account of our agreement with the French. If we have held to the letter or our contract in this matter, in other respects the French have just grievances against us. The vigorous anti-French propaganda carried on by the Arab Government has been paid for by the subsidy which we are still giving to Kino- xiusain, it is no justification in French eyes that the anti-British propaganda in It sopot ami a has been supported by the same funds. Until recently weiwere selling siii plus arms to the Arab State, and in early October we were still selling equipment; the F rench are right in thinking that arms and equipment have been acquired for use against themselves. Still greater is the blame which attaches to His Majesty's Government for not having made it clear to the Arabs from the first that we were absolutely debarred by our engagements with France from accepting a Syrian mandate. I can testify that in March, when I had frequent conversations with Faisal in Paris, he had had no official information on this head. It was not conveyed to him until July, and he expressed the 1 greatest consternation on receiving it. The American Commission did nothing, and could do nothing, but encourage vain hopes. The result has been a disastrous prolongation of unrest and intrigue on the part both of the Arabs and of the French, and increased bitterness on either side. It is also deeply to be regretted that our officers in Syria were left in doubt of the ultimate intentions of the British Government. It was not until the summer that they received definite instructions. In May Colonel Cornwallis and Colonel Brayne, independently reviewing the situation, assumed the acceptance of the mandate by ourselves as a possibility. With whatever sincerity they and those under them may have played the game of temporary neutrality, it was inevitable that their attitude to the Arab administration should have been influenced by the uncertainty, which they shared with the Arabs, as to what the final status of the country could be. All uncer tainty helped to strengthen Arab hopes. The oysters have been eaten and put down in the bill; it is useless to speculate by whom and in what proportions the bill will be met. A more profitable line of thought lies in the direction of considering how the twelve-month existence—even if it fail to exist longer—of an independent Arab State has affected and will affect Mesopotamia. It is true that the Arab administration has left much to be desired, and equally true that it has been artificially financed by our subsidy to the Sharif; but it has nresented, nevertheless, the outward appearance of a national Government; rmbliV business has been kept sroing, tramways have run, streets have been lighted, people have bought and sold, and * normal world has been maintained. British Officers in Aleppo consider that Ja'far, Naji, and Ihsan have run a very creditable administration, and their opinion cannot be set aside. Whether it could have gone on indefinitely or not, for a year it has actually gone on, and if it crumbles undermmaammmasam 20 the present arrangements its failure will be attributed, not to British indifference and French ambition. When we set up C1 7 l1 a( ^ lniS ^ 1 ^ in this country, the fact that a responsible native Government ^sted for a yea Syria will not be forgotten by Mesopotamia^ Nationalists and if we ^ek to of those 'Iraqis who have done best in Syria, they will claim gre T ^|- ^ and they will expect to be treated as equals. Moreover, the example of india an? 01 Egypt will be before the eyes of the Arabs of Mesopotamia. In both countries it ia safe to predict that the advance towards responsible native government will be rapid and it will be the more noticeable because it will be accompanied by a con espond g withdrawal on our part from the position of authority which we have occupied hitherto, a movement almost impossible jtolfeffect with perfect preservation ot digm y. I was deeply permeated, during the week I spent in Egypt m September, by a sense of the unpalatableness of the task which lies before us, and I regard that country as an object-lesson to us in Mesopotamia. Looked at purely from our point ot view, it seems to me to be preferable to take up from the first a position from which we snail not be called upon to retreat. An advisory power to which the native administration comes of its own free will, and urged by its own necessities, is on safer ground than one which is forcing guidance and instruction on reluctant subordinates. We have stated that it is our intention to assist and establish in Syria a.nd in Mesopotamia indigenous governments and administrations. As regards Syria the promise has now materialized, but if it had not yet taken form I believe that the events of the past year in Syria and Egypt have left us, no choice with regard to Mesopotamia. Local conditions, the vast potential wealth of the country, the tribal character of its rural population, the lack of material from which to draw official personnel will make the problem harder to solve here than elsewhere. I venture to think that the answer to such objections is that any alternative line of action would create problems the solution of which we are learning to be harder still. G. L. B.
