I am asked by the Manamah Town Council to ascertain the probable salary of a doctor, from either Egypt, Syria or Irak, who could undertake the duties of a Municipal doctor in Manamah. Th* Council decided at their last meeting that they would like, if possible, to have their own doctor, if terms could be obtained which suit their pocket. Their wish for either a male doctor, or preferably, if^ obtainable,a female doctor. Could you give me any information on the subject^or,if not^have you any objection to the President of the Council writing direct to the Health Authorities in Egypt Syria and Irak in order to make enquiries! In this connection they also enquire whether I could inform them, roughly, how much it costs to provide the drugs which are used for the 'tictoria Memorial Hospital throughout one year. t J 1si DEPARTMENT.

B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain* Memo. Haji iibdullah Oosaibi, at the last Beladiya meeting, brought up the question of medical services in Bahrain and stated that the fees charged by the Agency Medical Officer were excessive. He charges, so I am told, Rs. 10/- for a visit by day and Rs. 20/- for a nightvisit. Haji Abdullah Gosaibi,and others of the Council decided that this amount is too much. I pointed out that as he was not in any way connected with the Belddiya it was not their affair but I mi° s &amp; s k®d.hy the President to discuss the matter with you. The Beladiya consider that hes fees should be reduced to half the present amount. They also pointed out that the hospital was built mainly from funds provided by the Bahrain Government (by Shaikh Isa ) and further the do 9 tor received a salary from this Government. I explained that his salary was for certain specific duties. I gather that they would like to obtain &lt;£n assistant doctor, who would be a municipal official and who would work under the supervision of the Agency doctor using the present hospital and dispensary. As I am not altogether clear as to the position of the Victoria Memorial Hospital I informed them that I would refer the whole question to you. Perhaps at the next meeting you would give your views.

He ’would apparently be an ideal man, but it is very doubtful whether he could go,as he has a good position here. If he would,it would be at a salary of not less than £.75 sterling per month,but a less experienced man,not able to perform major operations,might,I am told,be found for £.40 or even less.

INTRODUCTORY. 1. The need in India for medical aid by women is so well-known that it appears scarcely necessary to offer an apology for the publication of a handbook of information regarding hospitals staffed by women. This need has been recognised since 1885 when the Countess of Dufferin opened her Fund for the Provision of Female Medical Aid and the years that followed have only shewn the immensity of the held open to women workers in this direction. To indicate briefly some of its paths we may mention the relief of purdah women who may not for any purpose attend male hospitals; the • relief of gynaecological diseases among all classes of women who are forbidden by eastern customs and prejudices from consulting male doctors on such matters; the relief of the terrible conditions of childbirth, including attend ance on women in labour, advice and help to the country midwives in emer gency, the training of midwives and the supervision of their work: the training of Indian women in medicine and nursing; and in addition the wide avenue recently opened up in connection with public health. We have in India an enormous wastage of infant life. It is estimated that about two million babies under one year die annually. This is due partly to ignorance and bad treatment during pregnancy and childbirth, partly to carelessness after birth, and partly to bad domestic conditions and the prevalence of such diseases as malaria, tuberculosis, etc. The services of medical women for organising measures to overcome these conditions would be of great benefit but while there is a tendency to employ women in a subordinate capacity as health visitors there is little provision as yet for the organising and supervising of such work by medical women. Considering the comparatively small number of medical women available and the need for economy as regards funds it would be well if women’s hospitals could be utilised more than at present in such preventive work, and be more closely associated with schemes for Infant Welfare and midwife supervision. Endowment Fund. 2. Hospitals staffed by women in India are rarely Government institu tions. The only such Government hospitals we are aware of are the Cama Hospital, Bombay, the Dufferin and Lady Lyall Hospitals, Agra, and the Victoria Hospital for Caste and Gosha Women at Madras. Others are built by private generosity, sometimes assisted by charitable funds, such as the Dufferin Fund, and often aided by the Local Government or Local Funds; many are built and carried on by Missionary Societies. The upkeep of hospitals not definitely under Government, Municipalities, or Missionary Societies is often a very difficult problem, and we would strongly urge those responsible for founding such institutions to ensure a certain income by putting aside an endowment fund at least equal to the cost of the building. This will still make it necessary to secure grants' in aid for upkeep from the District Boards, Municipalities, charitable societies, etc., but it will make it possible to carry on the work with economy; while without an endowment fund it may be necessary in times of stress to close down the hospital. Moreover, the efficiency of a poor hospital is always hampered and many lives are lost for want of a little necessary expenditure. In big towns a hospital of this kind may itself contribute largely to its own upkeep by charging room rent and small attendance fees to well-to-do patients. For success in this aim, however, several things are necessary,—an efficient and popular doctor,—a cheerful and contented staff,—plenty of single wards with plain but convenient arrangements for families,—and a sufficiency of medical and surgical appliances.2 How can a hospital be made popular? is a question often asked. In our experience the essential factor is kindness on the part of the doctor and staff and their power of inspiring confidence. The Indian woman is not very experienced or critical as regards modern methods of treatment, but affection for her medical attendant makes her very ready to feel better with the result that popularity may exist without efficiency. This is not said to give the impression that efficiency is not of the first importance in a hos pital, but rather that lack of gentleness and patience on the part of the staff may drive away patients from an otherwise well organised hospital. Overlapping. 3. There is one matter which needs careful attention from those about to open hospitals. Since the need for medical women is so great, especially in connection with maternity work, and so many tracts of country are still unsupplied, it is sad to see two or more women’s hospitals in one small town competing against each other and neither perhaps doing full work. Yet this is a common sight. We are aware of one town in Southern India, not very large, which already has two women’s hospitals entirely staffed by women and two women s hospitals partly staffed by women, and is now contemplating open ing a third hospital entirely staffed by women. A gift of money given by a private individual to build a hospital is often intended to commemorate the name of his family or some deceased relative in his native place. But even so, the intention is to found an institution which by producing widespread benefit will draw back on the founder streams of real gratitude and blessing. Would this object not be gained more effectively if the hospital were built m e ?u t0 7 n j e ^ e there was 110 rival instifc ution, even if not the native place ot. the founder . In large towns there is often room for two women’s hospi- of the city' ^ ° f importance that the ^ should be P laced in different quarters Purdah. 4. The question of Purdah is an important one. In the early days of women s hospitals some of the Local Committees of the Dufferin Fund believed that the benefit of Dufferin Hospitals should be restricted to purdah women c y '„l T ® tw , W f ‘A at onl y f would the hospitals become popular amon R this class That belief has not been justified. It has been found that even purdah ladies of good class are satisfied to be in an ordinary hospital staffed by women it they are given a coUage ward where they can live apart with their servants and friends, sharing in the benefit of the hospital but not in e lite of the other inmates. Non-purdah women are freely admitted to the attoidance'of Zt' 1 thlS Way Z 0nlj ; A women of all classes obtain the attendance of their own sex in hospitals but the doctor draws upon a larger circle of patients and gams wider experience of her profession • lastly— a factor of wide importance,-she is able to train Indian girls as nurses and small'comnmnity.

In fact it is usually impossible to secure an ideal site m a city. 11 The asoect should be such that sunlight can reach all parts of the site 'The prefadfng winds should be able to sweep through it. It should not be in a hollow and the soil preferably should be sandy. 12 The minimum amount of space on the site should be 300 square feet for each bed and preferably a great deal more. CONSTRUCTION OF HOSPITAL. ' T . A , p „b ou t to build hospitals in India should banish from their mi nds thI impr!ss°on sometimes entertained that Indian patients should be minds the impress conditions in hospital as in their own homes. It more or less ,... . their homes are frequently so unfavourable that jf teC Sf* e rle sary A poo^ndian at home has to contend with bad air P \nsufficfen» food,' insufficient clothing and fuel in cold weather and all these conditions militate against his recovery.4 In founding a hospital the intention is to provide a place where the sick poor and in some cases the sick well to do can by grouping them together be treated with the greatest possible efficiency and economy. There is always a certain amount of danger from this grouping together of sick people. This is due to the fact that organic matter and germs are given off from their bodies and excretions; that in a hospital ward excretions, dressings and soiled clothes have constantly to be exposed; that floors, walls, and furniture are likely to absorb the organic matter and harbour the germs; and that sick people whose powers of resistance are below par are very likely to absorb germs and organic matter. The result may be the onset of acute disease or it may be merely an absence of satisfactory convalescence. Over 50 years ago these bad results were very marked, and in 1812 Sir John Pringle says Hospitals are the chief cause of mortality in the Army.” During the Crimean War the mortality in one hospital at Scutari was 42 per cent while lying m hospitals were constantly swept by epidemics of puerperal tever. Modern knowledge has shown how to guard against the bad effect ot segregation, and it is for this reason that great attention has to be paid to the budding and organising of a hospital. With the modern knowledge which medical men and women possess it is not likely that a return to the mortality of 42 per cent, will occur. But even the best and most up to date doctors cannot prevent the mortality from being much higher than it should be it the hospital is badly built without due consideration of modern principles. 14. In deciding the plan upon which a hospital is to be built there are ceitain preliminary considerations of the greatest importance:— Hygiene.~-A\\ sick people are much affected by good or bad hygienic conditions. Bad conditions will lead to a high death rate. Cleanliness.—Sick people are constantly exuding germs and if these are allowed to lodge m the walls, floors, etc., the hospital will become a veritable death trap. The problem is how to prevent o, w th I lod S ement germs with as little waste of energy as possible. 6 aff. The success of the Hospital depends on the staff and the wU 67 T Vy T th u eir dutieS - Therefore, provide for their station and hXts 7 aCCOrdin S to their 15. Hygiene. cma ^ entl ^ l ° n ‘ It IS agreed that in a hospital ward 1 000 cubic feet nf space are required for each patient and 80 feet of floor space. Heifrht nftor 4 feet, does not add to the respiratory capacity of the ward The’ above (1) Every ward should have cross ventilation, that is entrances and ex.ts for air on opposite sides of the wards, and if possMe tCe should be on the long sides of the ward. u 11 P°ssiDle these (2) Other ventilation than only windows should be provided owine to the tendency of patients to close the windows when it becomes u £ u Clemestor y windows near the roof are usual ThZ s muld be continually open and should be fitted with wire gauze L P Cof rain KM • GlaSS is Pessary except (3) If a ward is kept properly ventilated arrangements must be made Z ftSg” ' “ ld ~‘ h » P-Sing .«S£ teg* (4) In calculating the amount of cubic space necessary the natients friends must not be forgotten, if /is intended to let them sTav &gt;n. It is a common sight to find a hospital ward, correctly.«, r-w—' planned for say. 10 patients, “fi K PerS ° nS each woman having an average of 1 child and 1 Inena. (51 In very hot climates electric fans are a great comfort to the patients V ^ even if only turned on for an hour or two a day. seldom remember to flush the closet. , The dry system is still far the more common There a ^ eral of employing'it and the simpler are usually the best. There are certain general principles which should be remembered , , u , . m The latrine should be raised above the surrounding level and should ( } hat a good roof to prevent the storm water getting in and washing faecal matter about. , ,, (21 All angles inside the latrine should be rounded and floor and walls should if possible, be of impervious material or at least presen a smooth surface and be washable. This is to prevent the lodge- ment of germs. (3) The floor should be on a slight slope and should have a sha flow dra V ^ leading outwards to a well made soakpit. Man} patients esp cially those of high caste will not use the receptacles provided They sit about the floor, hence the need for swabbing out frequently. „ . v ( a\ a cover should be provided for each receptacle or a pan oi earth V placed near and the patient instructed to cover the dejecta with earth. This is to prevent flies sitting on the dejecta. Of the different receptacles the simplest are a series of earthen vessels Ot the Cline . fr JL fl renewe( j The vessels should be frequently painted T' lth “ a , hsideoeal veselm a slab of smooth material on which ihf pal nts mt and ttre is a hol in the wall opposite each vessel through whi?^the sweeper removes it. He empties it and washes it into an iron cask which has a well fitting lid and this cask is removed daily by the Municipal authorities, a fresh one being put in its place. .... , . This system when well carried out is simple and hygienic—when badly carried out is very terrible. The sweeper may fail to remove the vessels cariiea out are use( j the patients sit on the floor and flies r t 8 ^nH—the A sweci»er'may fail to replace the lid of the iron cask which is at'oiK-e attacked bv millions of flies,-the municipal carter may fail to change the iron cask wdiich overflows and makes a horrible nuisance the cas.^s may ! 1 „ i o trail of f iecal matter follows the cart across the compound. All heLmtfo unes exceprthe last two can be prevented if one of the superior ^ilv insnect the latrines. As regards the last two something can be done ff thflmad oflL hospital makes herself a persistent nuisance to the local mUn The a reare two simple methods of disposing of refuse in India which have been found by experience to work well in connection with the refuse of Women’s Hospitals situated in places where conservancy is lacking, or meffi- ciently carried out. ‘ 1 Bv Incineration.— Where all hospital dressings and all excreta are ^ consumed daily in a properly constructed furnace by mixing with dry fuel. Anyone employing this system is advised to consult some properly qualified sanitary oificer before erecting an incinerator, the design given in Lukis and Blackham s f rop 1 - cal Hvgiene is a good one. Special attention should be paid to the conditions laid down m that book for the proper incineration of night soil.,4 * 2. By the Trench method .—This is only applicable in country places where there is ample open ground near the Hospital. In this method refuse and excreta are buried in the earth in shallow pits. Walking patients can use the pit as a latrine. The path leading to it from the Hospital compound should be narrow and efficiently hedged with thorns so that there is little inducement for people to use any ground but that provided for the purpose. If trenches are dug about 2 feet deep a fresh portion must be made every day, the sweepen carefully covers over and fills in the portion used, before opening a fresh pit. Land once trenched should not be used again for this purpose for at least 4 years. (c) Water.—In many Indian towns there is now a supply of filtered water laid on in pipes. In such cases all that remains is to arrange for taps being placed in convenient situations. When there is no such water supply a well must be sunk in the compound placed as far as possible from the wards and equally from the latrines. The sides of the well should be smoothly built, it should have a roof, and walls of wire gauze to prevent mosquitoes from breeding in it. There should be a door kept locked and no one but the hospital bhisti should be allowed to craw water. Otherwise the patients’ friends will lower their own vessels and possibly contaminate the water. The well should have a masonry parapet and sloping platform around it to prevent storm water washing in. (d) Kitchens .—These should be at as great a distance as the size of the compound will permit from the wards and especially from the latrines. 1 here should be at least 2 kitchens—-one for the Brahmin cook into which no one but herself and fellow caste people should enter and another in which non-caste people may cook. The Brahmin, however, will cook for all castes unless meat forms a part of the diet. It is convenient to have near the kitchen a shed with a number of little cooking places in which patients’ friends can cook. Phis will save the hospital diets as many patients who are on ordinary diet would prefer and can afford to provide it themselves and have it cooked by friends. (e) Laundry.—The dhobi should have a house for himself and his family apart from the room used for washing clothed. 1 smallest hospital two rooms should be given up for the laundry m one of which the soiled linen is placed after the dhobi has taken it over from the Housekeeper or Matron. This should contain a fireplace and large copper for boiling the clothes. The other room is the ironing room hospital * ' e C ean c o ^ les are folded and placed until taken over by the It is convenient to give the dhobi an enclosed piece of ground near the well 'h ' T/ 1 severa J? n,&lt;s built A supply of running water from the .well should be passed through the tanks while the dhobi is washing Provi- then/to'the dhobF ^ made f ° r boihng illfected clothes, etc., before handing 16. Cleanliness. There are certain definite rules to be followed in con structing a hospital in order that cleanliness may be maintained with as little output of labour as possible and that germs may have little opportunity of lodgement These rules app y to all parts of the hospital where patien's are iSfollows l espe ° y t0 the ° perating r00m and labour r ° om - They (1) The floor and walls (at least the lower 5 feet) should be of some impermeable or non-absorbent material, or if that is impossible washed down. materla whlch ha s a smooth surface ind can Fortland cement laid in large slabs makes an excellent floor Marble is also good I lies are sometimes used and are easily kept clean. Mud floors, crumbling cement floors and uneven f ^27 wooden floors are dangerous. A five feet dado of marble or tiles is excellent for the wall. If the cost of this is prohibitive the dado may be painted and vranished over which gives a smooth washable surface. (21 All angles, the roof with the walls, the walls with each other and with the floor should be rounded. A dram should be provided to facilitate swabbing out. (31 The windows should be flush with the inside wall— there should be no window sills. Doors and windows frames should be quite plain. . £ (4) Cupboards in wards should be avoided with the exception o one for ward medicines. It should have washable shelves and walls. O Vt n ff ouarters —It is a great advantage to the hospital if a house can be provided for the doctor close ft hand. It should not be situated actually in the hospital compound, because the doctor’s position is one of great respon- sibilitv and if she is constantly in the midst of her patients and hab frenuent interruptions her health or her nerves are likely to sufter _ The doctor’s house should preferably be in a separate compound with a d'fferen outlook The door of communication should be kept locked and on } Matron or house-surgeon should keep a key. This does not prevent the doctor from interviewing her patients and their friends as muc ^ f a i?“ e d S *f y were it inures that she has some privacy and some change. If this advice we followed we should hear of fewer breaks down among women doctors in In la. The doctor’s house should always be large enough to enable her to accom- modate a relative or friend. . . ,, The house-surgeon requires 2 good-sized rooms, pantry and bathroom n q Lritphpn r ind servants godown. * If the hospital is a large one ant ifcanbe arranu-ed for her to get her food from a common staff kitchen much frouble wOl te saved. Her quarters should be in the hospital compound but in a building apart from the wards. ^ &lt; Thp Matron should have similar rooms in the same building as the nurses i • ‘i Iso be a buildin* apart from the wards. The nurses should have^a ^ommon^si tt ing Zn wTthhbrary, games and pictures. A piece o nri cbmdd be attached to their quarters where they can play tennis or Enton The quarters should be'airy, well-ventilated with fireplaces or stoves 1 for heating in cold weather and fans for cooling in hot weather. It must be rememtered that nurses who are constantly working among sick people i- h1pi tn ] )e infected Their work is necessarily irregular, at times very bird an^tryfog The physique of Indian girls is not very strong. Ex- perience shows Urere is 1 high mortality when they take up nursing and it fs very urgent that those who promote hospitals should consider carefully how to preserve the health of the young girls they engage, the supply of whom is all too small for the need. 17 staff.—In deciding on the staff to be employed the two chief points to be considered are economy and efficiency. It is not infrequently the case that economy is secured at the expense of efficiency; indeed sometimes the purpose of the organisers is defeated because a badly paid and inferior staff fail in careful administration with the result that waste and extravagance are allowed There is ample opportunity for waste m hospital administration. The building may be allowed to fall into disrepair—furniture may be left un- niended—valuable instruments and appliances are neglected-the most ex pensive dressings or drugs are used unnecessarily-pilfering of oil, coal, food and bedding gSes on unchecked-so that if any appearance of efficiency is to be retained large sums have to be spent yearly which would have been un necessary if the administration had been carried on by a careful head administrator.8 A women’s hospital, if not directly under a municipality or a mission, is usually managed by a Committee. If the hospital is a small one, 40 beds or less, it is best that the medical woman in charge should be the Secretary to the Committee. In this way work is simplified. Another Treasurer should, if possible, be provided. If the hospital is larger the medical woman cannot without injury to her work carry on the secretarial duties and another Secretary should be found. In practice business men make the best Honorary Secretaries. In every case it is advisable that the medical woman in charge should have a free hand in the internal administration of the hospital. An Indian Staff understands divided authority far less than a European Staff, and should the members of the Committee allow themselves to become a court of appeal in petty matters discipline will certainlv become slack and efficiency will suffer. There are 4 classes of medical women in India : — (1) Those with overseas qualifications, who would expect a salary of Rs. 400 to Rs. 800 per mensem. (2) Those with Indian University degrees, who would expect a salary of Rs. 200 to Rs. 450 per mensem. (3) 1 hose with certificate or apothecary qualifications who would expect a salary of Rs. 150 to Rs. 300 per mensem. (4) Sub-Assistant Surgeons who are paid from Rs. 50 to Rs. 150 per mensem. It it is. intended that the hospital should be supervised by the Civil Surgeon of the district it is sufficient to have one of the two latter classes, or even the second class may be employed. Those medical women with overseas qualifications usually expect to have independent professional control of their hospitals. Where they are qualified for this the advantages are many. Women of the class for whom the hospital is intended will come more readily 1 ,. are . cer l' a i n that no men will be present. Another point is that the t ml Hospitals treat comparatively few women as in-patients and those chiefly for general diseases. There are usually no nursing arrangements because no nurses are available. Hence the work runs on different lines from that of a women s hospital where many of the patients suffer from special diseases requiring special facilities for examination and treatment, and where the domestic prejudices and customs of the women require consideration A Civil Surgeon in supervising a Zenana Hospital is a little apt to overlook these facts and keep the administration too much on the lines of the Civil Hospital Unless the medical woman has energy and initiative she is apt to let things drift, or if she tries to alter the state of affairs she is sometimes put down by her Committee as a troublesome and unsatisfactory employee If the medical woman is in charge of her hospital she will develop it on the lines that her experience of Indian women shews to be necessary in order that it may be of use to all classes of the community and especially in childbirth and diseases due to it while the Civil Surgeon as a member of the Committee will make a most valuable adviser. iniLLetJ In every hospital with over 20 beds the medical woman should have an asf istaiit. Otherwise her usefulness is limited as she must either refrain f rom operating or she must operate with an unqualified assist' i,i „ the anaesthetic—a dangerous proceeding. ^ .sistant to give Whenever possible a matron or nursing superintendent shnnlrl i .. , to organise the nursing.

Should it not be possible to retain a pupil compounder it is well to give each pupil nurse a course of training m pharmacy. * SOri-L-lO CDF-lfr3-23 -200D.O.No: Political Agency, Bahrain, the 8th June 1931.

C V ' / ??2y I enclose for your consideration a cg/y of correspondence with the India Store Department arising out of your letter of the 2nd November, No.1927-19/235, regarding the indent for equipment for the Bahrein Government Hospital. I understand that if the transaction is entrusted to that Department an appreciable reduction in the total cost ought to result, even al owing for the 3/ departmental charge. Moreover the Department can give valuable assistance in the way of checking prices and arranging for inspection and shipment. The stipulation that the estimated expenditure should be covered by a deposit is, I gather, in accordance with the customary procedure in connexion with indents from the Government of India and Provincial Governments. Will you please let me know whether the Bahrein Government agree to the orders being executed through the India Store Department on the conditions stated and are prepared to arrange (presumably through their banking representatives in London) to place a deposit with the High Commissioner for India to cover an approximate estimate of The H' Hon’ble Lieut-Col.Sir T.C.W.

(Sgd.) J. P. GIBSONP.Z.7941/38 Office of the Hifth Commissioner for India . S.6132/38. WFW. 29th llovemher, 1938. Sir, With reference to your letter No.?.Z.7645/38 dated 19th November 1938 regarding the purchase of equipment for the Government Hospital at Bahrein, it is doubtful v/hether the special terms obtained by this Department would be granted by the suppliers to other buyers. I am further to mention that no check on the prices quoted by the firms could be exercised unless the transactions were carried through by this Department. The High Commissioner would no doubt agree to this Department dealing v/ith the indents and arranging purchase, inspection and shipment on the usual terms, i.e. payment of departmental expenses at the rate of 3/ on the cost of the stores plus freight, provided that the Government of Bahrein are prepared to make a deposit v/ith the Office of the High Commissioner of sufficient funds to cover the estimated cost of the indents including freight charges and departmental expenses. I am, etc. Sd. W.P. Webb for Director-General, India Store Department. The Under-Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.-\ I am directed 'by the Secretary of State for forward for your consideration a copy of a letter addressed to this / Office hy the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf regarding “ , 7''V la.^ed 2nd November 1938.) the purchase of equipment for the Government ^ Hospital at Bahrain. The Secretary of-State would be grate- / ful for any assistance which you can give in the direction suggested by the Resident. I am ? etc. Sd. J.P. Gibson The Director-General, India Store Department, Belvedere Road, Lambeth, S.E.l./*?\ /&gt; M ‘fill you please refer to yo\ir letter No. 1632/10 dated the 15th November 1938? 2. The India Office have been looking into this matter in London and they have been told by the India Store Department there that it is doubtful v^hether the special terns obtained by f that Department would be granted by the suppliers to Other buyers. They say that the High Commissioner for India would doubtless agree to the India Store Department dealing with the indents and arranging tor purchase, inspection and shipment on the usual terms, i.e. payment of departmental expenses at the rate of three per cent on the cost of the stores plus freight, provided that the Bahrain Government make a deposit with the High Commissioner’s office of sufficient funds to cover the estimated cost of the indents including freight charges and departmental expenses. The India Office say that even allowing for the three per cent departmental charges there should be an appreciable reduction in the total cost if the India Store Department deal with it and they advise that the Department can give valuable assistance in the way of checking prices and arranging for inspection and shipment. 3. Will you therefore please let me know whether the Bahrain Government agree to the orders being executed through the India Store Department on the conditions stated and whether you are prepared to arrange to place a deposit with the High Commissioner for India to cover the approximate cost? If so the India Office will ask the Department to proceed with your orden as expeditiously as possible. Yours sincerely, U C.
