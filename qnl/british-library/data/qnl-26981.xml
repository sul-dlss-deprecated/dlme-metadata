I propose awaiting their views before taking any further action as regards through communication with India via Mirjawa. Fact that appli cation has only been made verbally by an official of Ministry of Foreign Affairs would seem to imply that Persian Government are not very sure of their ground.

While reply proposed hy government of India seems generally suitable for use when the time comes, it is perhaps doubtful, in view of considerations explained in your telegram No. 58 (of March 30th) and general unsatisfactory state of Anglo-Persian relations, whether it would not be best to postpone it until con clusion of telegraph agreement.

Your telegram dated 3rd March, Indo-Pereian Telegraph traffic via Duzdap and direct wireleae ccmunication. I informed Communicatlone Company of negetiatione in case they desired to make repreeentatione and have received reply indicating that Company rely on Government of India to protect their intereete on linee suggested in telegrams exchanged between Bhore and Kerehaw in August last in return for their undertaking maintenance of Gulf cable system, Ae regards wireless, Company realise that it adY be more difficult to refuse Persian request but hope that it may be poeeible to restrict service to limitrephic traffic*INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 20th August,1930. Dear Mr. Hihherdine, I have received from Sir J. Bhore a reply to the telegram I sent to him on the 13th instant, regarding the blocking rate. He says that they appreciate your fears and would like, if possible, to help. When the Indo route is closed, the line between Karachi and the Persian frontier will become part of the Indian Telegraph System, and the Government of India could not maintain it as a separate administration. No transit charge, therefore, would be leviable by India in respect of transit over this portion of the System and, under the International Telegraph Regulations the Government of India would be unable to adopt a higher terminal charge for traffic between Europe and India passing over this route than is applicable to traffic passing over routes worked by the Communications Company. Bhore goes on to say that, when the route is closed, the Karachi-Duzdap section might be reduced to a single outlet and maintained on a standard necessary only for local traffic. It would therefore be unsuitable for the transmission of international traffic and, if pressed under the Convention to give facilities for international traffic by that route, the Government of India would be able to reply that sufficient facilities exist via Bushire and the Gulf cable. He thinks that there is nothing to prevent the Communications Company fixing transit charges on the A.H.Hibberdine,Esq., Gulf Electra House, Moorgate, S.C.2.Gulf section at rates sufficiently high to stifle competition, hut he suggests that it might he desirable for you to obtain legal advice on this point. The above, he thinks, may perhaps dispel the fears of the Communications Company in respect of traffic exchanged between Karachi and the U.G.A. via Tehran wireless. He points out that the practice of the Government of India is to have one uniform terminal and transit charge for all traffic terminating or transiting Europe, but a higher terminal in all other cases. In the event of direct wireless working being established between Tehran and the U.SJV.it would therefore be possible to adjust the Indian terminal on traffic to Karachi so as to make the through rate by such route equal to the rate charged by the Communications Company. This, however, might involve the fixation of a terminal so high as to cause considerable criticism. You will, I think, regard this reply as very satisfactory for, although the Government of India necessarily cannot commit themselves to any particular action in a hypothetical case, the whole trend of Bhore f s telegram shows clearly that the Government of India are anxious to help and to work in close co-operation with the Communications Company.
