YnK billK^Z OOI n bUL^k iJIb THICY DUY I?\l G- THE YS^R 1569 1940 19^57 J G enert.1 Situation Liic in this district pursued an even tenour in 1939 ho uistrubunces or agitations occurred anu no reforms or developments were embarked upon. Even the outbreak of war in Eureope produced, in this general inactivity, peculiarly little efrect. It is true that the steady rise in the cost oi living was given further impetus, the boycott of foreigners ana in particular oi this Consulate was intensified ana the remnant of the export trade finally dislocatea but no fresh evils came into being and anxiety over the future problem of obtaining supplies from abroad was only one of a few small clouds on the horizon. Local A dministration rciis, now designatea the Yth.Ustan, was deprived of an able and honest administrator by the death in December of Abul nassan Pirnla. He was appointed Governor General (Ustanaar) only in January and in view of the constant going and coming ol minor officials it is doubly unfortunate that this province should not have enjoyed for longer his beneficent rule. U. to the end of the year no one had been nominated to succeed him and in the absence of a Governor (Parmandar) the practical direction of affairs fell more than ever into the hands of the military authorities and the General Officer commanding the Pars division became the virtual Ustandar. Military intervention in civil affairs led to no increase of local initiative, for the army is obsessea even more than the civil administration with dread of the Shah’s displeasure/displeasure and action, at any rate of a 'beneficial Kind, was paralysed 'by the pernicious precaution of always referring to Tehran 'before taking the pettiest decision. ConL-iunicutions. No work was undertaken of any major importance. The bhiraz-Firuzahad road progressed no further than Firuzahad and the Kazerun-Basht-Behhehan road is not yet open to traffic. The military road from Shiraz to Befrbehan via iirdakan is closed to civilians after Tul-i-Khosrovi. In the spring the Shiraz-Isfahan raod was put in good condition for the Benefit of the foreign delegations visiting Iran for the Grown frince’s wedding But little has Been done to it since and the surface, especially Between Shiraz and x-ersepolis, is rapidly deteriorating. petrol pumps and oil depots were installed By the a-uiglo Iranian Oil Company at convenient intervals throughout the whole length of the road from Bushire to Tehran, xi. :ri culture. as a result of the plentiful winter rainfall grain crops were excellent. Fruit suffered from late frosts in April. Sugar Beet in nearly all parts of the district was attached By caterpillars and only a poor crop was oBtained. The cotton crop was good But much distress was caused By the Shah’s prohibition of the cultivation of rice, ior the waterlogged lanus suitable for rice can rarely Be put to an alternative use. Trade. The export trade in the produce oi Pars suc.i as gum tragacanth, reugum insoluble, lamskins, almonds, seeds and licorice roots, struggled feebly in the toils of inuumBeraBle governmental restrictions until the war gave it the death Blow./( 5 ) ■ blow. Shipments to Germany in the first half of the year were affected under the clearing agreement and to Italy under private barter arrangements. The suggestion of German importers that gum and licorice should be shipped from Bandar Shah via the U.S.S.R. was rejected by local merchants who foresaw much trouble and little profit and efforts were later initiated to find an outlet in India. The import trade, apart from a few consignments of barter goods from Italy, had long since succumbed to the difficulties created by the exchange and monopoly regulations and practically all foreign supplies were drawn from Tehran. British trade remained nil and signs of the British drive to increase exports were not apparent up to the end of the year. In spite of all things, however, the returns of the Shiraz branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran for the year ended September 20th 1939 showed that satisfactory profits were being maintained. Industry. The cotton mills of Isfahan and Shiraz, the woollen factories of Isfahan and the silk factories of Yezd all continued to work satisfactorily and supplied all local requirements. Difficulties however were anticipated for the future in obtaining the requisite supply of dyes from Germany. The sugar factory at Merv Dasht was expanded to cope with a production of 100,000 tons and the usual party of Czech technicians arrived for the sugar-boiling season with only a slight delay. The machinery for the grain silos at Isfahan and Shiraz which was to be supplied from the U.S.S.R. did not arrive although the silo builaing at Isfahan was finished Aytoy Kampsax in 1938 and the one in Shiraz is nearing completion. The Khollar wine factory produced some 250,000 litres of wine from the 1938 crop and succeeded in main taining the good quality of its products# Military Affairs and Public Security. The strength of the Shiraz garrison was brought up to about 8000 men. Mechanization made no progress. Of the three anti-aircraft guns reported to have arrived in the spring one was seen at the time tout none were heard of since. Considerably more attention was given to musketry and the three rifle ranges were in constant use. Rumours of movements of troops to the coast after the outbreak of war were not substantiated. The road guards (Amnieh) were incorporated in the array in March but no outward change was apparent in their functions or efficiency. Nevertheless, except for a few hold-ups and robberies in isolated parts, public security was remarkably good. Public Opinion and the War. The sentiments of informed Persians were over whelmingly favourable to the Allies. This no doubt is largely due to the tact that if a Persian speaks a foreign language at all it is usually either French or English and only very rarely German. Commercial circles in Shiran and industrial circles in Isfahan which have corae under strong German influence in the last few years, regarded the war as an unmitigated nuisance which was likely to lose them much money. They also considered that after the aefeat of Poland it was being needlessly prolonged. Only amongst army officers was there any definite body of pro-German feeling.© The Persian 'broadcasts from Angora, to which every Iranian wireless owner listens, nelped enormously to consolidate public opinion in favour of the allies, but reception towards the end of the year became very disturbed. Control of Foreigners a nd Foreign I nterests. The strict control of all foreigners which was expected to follow the outbreak of war did not take place. On the other hand special instructions were received by the Governor General to keep a watch on German activities ana at the beginning of November the heaa of the German community in shiraz, and the only potential emulator of v&lt;assmuss, was arrested for espionage and was stil± in custody, without trial, at the end of the year. Tribal settlement areas continued to be strictly guarded against the inquisitive eyes of strangers. Indian army language students were given little trouble by the local authorities but appear to have arouses considerable suspicion in Tehran. Towards the end of the year the employees of Kampsax began to encounter difficulty in obtaining permits to travel from the north to the south of Iran unless specially guaranteed to the authorities by the company. In August the C.M.S. schools in Isfahan and Shiraz were ordered to be hanaea over to the Iranian authorities at a weex’s notice but were later given a year’s respite when the difficulty of running them without their English staiis became apparent. .The archaeological ext-Edition of the University oi Chicago closed its worx at persepolis in November and tj.e Iranian Department of antiquities took over choice ox tne excavations. feathery— weather Report The maximum temperature v^&amp;s 98°P on July 81st &amp; august guru.
