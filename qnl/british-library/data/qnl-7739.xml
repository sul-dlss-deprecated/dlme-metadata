This strait, consisting of a two-mile wide eastern channel and a sixteen-mile wide western channel separated by Perim Island, connects the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean.The views were sketched from on board ship. The central sketch shows the profile of Perim Island, while the upper sketch appears to show a flare or beacon of some kind, with thick smoke billowing from its peak. This object is inscribed ‘Shrinka’. A number of other inscriptions, some of which are illegible appear to denote certain parts of the evidently rocky strait.InscriptionsRecto, in pencil:Upper centre: ‘Shrinka’Left edge: ‘2nd’, ‘3rd’Centre: ‘W’Right edge: ‘129’45 mm from right, 70 mm from upper: ‘Perim Island’30 mm from left, 35 mm from lower: ‘1st’Lower left corner: ‘Straits of Babelmandel. 12 Novr 1850.’Temporal contextThis sketch is part of a series of six drawings over consecutive days, 11–13 November 1850, during the journey between Aden and the Red Sea.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bombay Civil Service</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Augustus Fortunatus Bellasis</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">artist</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bab-el-Mandeb</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>South Africa</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023482667.0x000006#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
