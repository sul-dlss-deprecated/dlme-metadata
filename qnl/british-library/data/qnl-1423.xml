Political Department. From, COLONEL K. PIIAYRE, c. u., Political Superintendent, Prontier Upper Sind. To, CAPTAIN C. W. nAPPISON, Political Agent, Klielat. Jacobabad, 4tli August 1870. S ir, In acknowledging the receipt of your Diary from 4th to 10th July last, I see that under date Priday, 7th July, His Ilighuess the Khan has commenced a correspondence with Ibrahim Khan of Chagkansoor, in Seistan, or Kuchansor as it is written in the Caubool Diaries. In a letter from Ibrahim Khan to His Highness he states, that he and his people were originally subjects of Khelat, and asks his aid against the Persians. 2. If you will refer to the following Caubool Diaries, you will sec that J. Caubool letter 23rd January 1870. Seistan generally, and Chagkansoor 2. Do.

Last year, when I wrote to His Highness asking him to obtain general information for me, regarding Persian aggression in Seistan, through the Nooshky Sirdar, he most kindly and promptly did so ; but I never contem plated his corresponding with the Seistan Chiefs themselves, and I have not observed until now that he has done so. At all events, it is safe not to run the risk of clashing with any arrangements that the Government of India may have made with the Ameer of Caubool about that important frontier, and therefore I lose no time in asking you to make the requisite arrangements. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) Pv. PHAYKE, Colonel, Political Superintendent. U. S. F. True Copy, P. PHAYRE, Colonel, Political Superintendent; L T . S.
