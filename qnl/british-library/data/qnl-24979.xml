Relations with Ihn Sa'ud. ’Abdul ’Aziz ibn Sa’ud, the present Hakim of Najd, may be said to have begun his reign in 1901, when he was proclaimed governor of Hiyadh by his father ’Abdul liahman. The Sa’ud family were at that time in exile, hav ing been driven out of their dominions, in 1891, by their hereditary foe, ibn Rashid. In 1902, ’Abdul ’Aziz with the help of Mubarak ihn Sabah, Shaikh of Kuwait, recovered Riyadh in a daring raid which he led in person and by 1900 he had so far re-established the old supremacy of the Sa’ud as to carry hostilities to the gates of Hail. During the years succeeding his return to Riyadh he acted in close alliance with the Shaikh of Kuwait, who had every reason for desiring the curtailing of Rashid influence. For the Rashid were allies, and in a remote acceptation of the term, vassals of the Ottoman empire subsidized and hacked by Constantinople, and they represented in Arabia the Turkish policy of centralization which the Shaikh was covertly resisting in his own territories.^ His geographical position on the shores of the Persian Gulf had placed him in relations with the British Government; since 1899 we had had a friendly understanding wdth him and had promised to support him against Ottoman aggression. But the existence of this connection made us unwilling to see him drawn into the confused and uncertain feuds of the interior, and acting on the principle laid down in 1897 that we were “ not disposed to interfere more than was necessary for the maintenance of general peace in the Persian Gulf”, we had discouraged him from embroiling himself in Central Arabian affairs. Ibn Sa’ud, in spite of his growing importance, was outside the limits of our interest, thus appointed, and it was not until 1911 that special attention was drawn to him in our official reports. In that year Captain Shakespear, the Political Agent at Kuwait, while on tour, met him by chance in the desert and was hospitably entertained in his camp, ihn Sa ud expressed to him a desire to.be received into a recognized relation- ship^with Great Britain ; he referred to Colonel Felly’s visit to Riyadh in 1865 and to the overtures made to us by his father ’Abdul Rahman in 1904 when a British Agent was first appointed to Kuwait. He spoke in strong terms of the hatred which the Arabs entertained for the Turks and of his own lesentment of their occupation of the Hasa, a province which he was parti cularly anxious to regain, not only because it formed part of his ancestral dominions, but also because it would give him access to the sea and control o^ er tribes from Riyadh to th e coast. He regarded with grave apprehension2 tiic a^uircs^iTe policy of tlic new rcs^iniG in Turkey and would welcome, if he recovered the Hasa, a British Agent in one of his ports, and he added that our trade would benefit from the increased security which he would maintain on the caravan routes. Captain Shakespear could make no other rejoinder than that the British Government confined its interests to the coast and had never challenged Turkish claims to the ordering of affairs in Central Arabia, with which wo had no concern ; that we were moreover on amicable terms with Turkey and should be averse from anything in the nature of intrigue against the Ottoman Government, but in his comments on tlie report of this interview, Sir Percy Cox pointed out that as the Porte seemed disposed to be intractable in the adjustment of matters relating to British interests in the Gulf, we could not afford to ignore ibn Sa’ud’s attitude. His personal authority had greatly increased, and it would be well to entertain cordial if distant relations with him. The Foreign Office, however, decided that it was impossible at that time to swerve from our policy of strict non-interference. Two years later ibn Sa’ud, without the assistance which he had tried to obtain from us, though he was credited throughout Arabia with having secured it, overran the Hasa, ejected without difficulty the small Turkish garrisons and established himself on the coast at Qatif and Ojair. Captain Shakespear, on his return to England in June 1914, from a long projected journey across Arabia in the course of which he had visited Riyadh, bore witness to the strong personal domination which ibn Sa’ud’s vigorous and commanding personality had established, and from other reports it was clear that he was regarded beyond his own frontiers as the coming man. He proved more than a match for the ineffective efforts of the Turks to retake the Hasa; they resorted to diplomacy and opened negotiations with him through Saiyid Talib of Basrah. Early in May TaTat Beg had formulated in private conversation at the British Embassy the expectations of the Ottoman Government in terms which seemed to his hearers little consonant with actual conditions. He proposed to estab lish a strictly delimited frontier between ibn Sa’ud and ibn Rashid, place repre sentatives of the Sultan at Riyadh and at Hail, and rely upon the guile of these officials to control without the aid of force the actions of the two Amirs. As for the Hasa, ibn Sa’ud wmuld be appointed Mutasarrif of the province, but the collection of the customs would remain in Turkish hands and Turkish garrisons would be replaced in the ports. Nothing was more certain than that ibn Sa’ud appearance on the coast must ultimately bring him into direct contact with ourselves whether we welcomed it or sought to avoid it; and this anxiety underlay and possibly accelerated the action of the Porte. But at the moment Turkish fears w r ere groundless. We were concerned wholly w ith the conclusion of prolonged nego tiations with Constantinople touching interests in Mesopotamia and the Gulf which w T ere of vital importance, and were less inclined, if possible, than before for Arabian adventure. We made a friendly offer of mediation w r hich was refused, and w r hen, in April 1914, the Amir met the British Agent, Colonel Grey, outside Kmvait, he was given to understand that we had recently con cluded a comprehensive agreement with Turkey and could hold out to him no hope of support. Ibn Sa’ud was thrown back on his own resources, but these were considerable, and the secret treaty which was signed in May by himself u „ a, v ima an( ^ the Wali of Basrah, fell short of Tal’at Arab Bureau. 8th October 1916. -r* &gt; ,. . .. r-r j. i Beg s anticipations. He accepted the title of Wali and Military Commandant of Najd which was offered to himself and his descendants as long as they should remain loyal, and engaged to fly the Turkish flag, but he was to have charge of the customs, on behalf of the Ottaman Government, raise his owm levies and provide the garrisons for Qatif and Ojair. Deficiencies in the Najd budget were to be met from the customs, and no revenue from any local income was to be paid to Constantinople until such time as there w~as a surplus—an eventuality of doubtful occurrence. But w r hile exercising in his own territories an authority which was in all but the name that of an inde pendent ruler, his correspondence with foreign Powers was to be conducted solely through the Porte, and in case of war he was to come to the assistance of the Sultan.3 welcome, e added e would 10 other he coast Central amicable at ure of ie report disposed its in the mthority relations e at that tried to &gt; secured sons and spear, on y across bie strong rsonality regarded a match isorted to Basrah, e British l seemed to estab- ,ce repre- e of these nirs.

As a strict Wahabi, the new VVali of Najd looked with abhorrence on the loose religious principles of the Turks and was far from admitting their pretensions to represent and direct Islam. He had, in conversation with Captain Shakespear, spoken with unexpected vehemence on this point, saying that in his eyes the infidel was preferable to the Turk, since the latter broke the rule he professed to follow while the former acted in accordance with his own law, and to the same listener he declared that he had accepted the terms of the agreement only because he was assured privately that even the small measure of sovereignty accorded to Arab Bureau, 22nd July 1916. Turkey would never be claimed. The Kuwait treaty was put to the test by the outbreak of the European war and found wanting. The disquieting attitude adopted by Turkey on the outbreak of war between Germany and the Entente Powers produced a profound altera tion in our policy towards the Porte. It became necessary to reckon up our assets in Arabia, and early in October Captain Shakespear, who was in England, was ordered to return to the Persian Gulf and get into touch with Ibn Sa’ud so as to prevent if possible the outbreak of unrest in the interior, and in the event of war with Turkey to ensure that no assistance should be rendered from that quarter. Before he could reach his destination war had . been declared. A message had been despatched to ibn Sa’ud informing him of Captain Shakespear’s impending visit, recognizing his position in Najd and the Hasa and guaranteeing him against reprisals by sea or land if he would commit himself to enter the lists against Turkey. The Turks, on their side, lost no time in approaching the Amirs of Central Arabia. Their scheme, which was that ibn Itashid should aid in the campaign against Egypt while ibn Sa’ud opposed the British advance in Mesopotamia, showed that they were as unaware of the feeling towards them which prevailed among the Arabs as they were ignorant of the conditions of the desert, where the network of tribal feud permits no man to withdraw his forces on a distant expedi tion without fear of attack on his unprotected possessions . Ibn Sa’ud, apparently in order to gain time, took advantage of his abiding enmity with ibn Rashid and launched into open hostilities against jiim. In vain Enver Pasha urged him to abandon private quarrels, sent him a gift of money for the expenses of co-operation with the Sultan’s armies, and ultimately entrusted Saiyid Talib with the task of bringing about a re conciliation. At this juncture Saiyid Talib was busily engaged in endeavour ing through the intermediation of Shaikh Khaz’al and His Majesty’s Consul at Muhammareh to drive a bargain with the British Government providing for his adherence to us in the event of war with Turkey, but the terms which he put forward were so extravagant as to be impossible of acceptance, and he was still hesitating over Shaikh Khaz’al’s advice to him to abate them when the declaration of war left him stranded. Then it was that he saw in his proposed deputation to Najd a providential means of escape from Basrah where his position had now become highly precarious, and he left hurriedly for Ibn Sa’ud’s camp, via Zubair. Meanwhile the Wahabi Chief, in response to Turkish ex hortation, had pleaded that he could spare no troops for the ’Iraq till he had reduced ibr Rashid to his rightful state of vassalage. To the British message he replied that he was unshaken in his long-standing desire for intimate rela tions with us. But he was not unnaturally reluctant to take open part with us until he was satisfied that our change of front towards himself was likely to be permanent, and in spile of his personal confidence in Captain Shakespear it was with some misgiving that he consented to his visit. The meeting took place on December 31st at Khufsah near Majma’ in Sudair. Ibn Sa’ud spoke with great frankness. Before compromising himself wholly with the Turks he asked that our assurances of support should be embodied in a formal treaty,4 the terms of which were drafted forthwith. They included a guarantee of complete independence on our part and an undertaking on the part of ibn Sa’ud that he would have no dealings with other Powers except after reference to the British Government. He informed Captain Shakespear that he had been in communication with the Sharif and with the heads of the northern ’Anazah confederation and that they were resolved to stand together. He was holding in detention a party of four envoys sent by the Turks to urge him to join ibn Rashid in a jihad against us, but after consultation with Captain Shakespear the Turkish mission was dismissed with the reply that ibn Rashid’s forces were camped within two days of ibn Sa’ud and that there could now be no question of peace between them. On January 17th a messenger arrived from Mecca bearing a letter from the Sharif’s son ’Abdullah who wrote that the Sharif had been called upon to proclaim the jihad and was temporizing till he heard what line ihn Sa’ud proposed to take. Ibn Sa’ud made answer that he saw no advantage to the Arabs in joining the Ottoman Government and had himself dismissed a Turkish deputation empty-handed. Upon the reports sent by Captain Shakespear from ibn Sa’ud’s camp, Sir Percy Cox was authorised to proceed with the negotiations for the treaty, but on January 24th battle was joined between ibn Sa’ud and ibn Rashid and' Captain Shakespear, unarmed and present only as a spectator, met his death. Ibn Sa’ud’s version of the disaster was that he was shot dead by a Shammar rifle-bullet, but this statement is in any case based only on second-hand in formation, as it is undisputed that Captain Shakespear had taken up a position in a different part of the field than that where his host was located. Since then various and divergent accounts of what happened have been recited, one of little more value than another, but the balance of evidence goes to show that he was first wounded in the leg and disabled, and soon afterwards killed in the charge of ibn Rashid’s cavalry which overwhelmed the flank on which be was posted. In tbe sauve qui pent which ensued it is feared that he was either abandoned or forgotten, but the precise circumstances of his untimely death will probably never be ascertained. Ibn Sa’ud expressed profound regret for tbe loss of one whom he regarded as a brother, and always refers to him with respect and affection. The action was indecisive: both parties claimed the victory and both were temporarily crippled and forced to retire. It w r as an unexpected and a somewhat disconcerting result, for ibn Sa’ud’s preparations had been made on an exceptional scale and his forces were said largely to outnumber those of ibn Rashid, though he was inferior in cavalry. The accounts given by the Arabs attribute his defeat to the treachery of the ’Ajman. Ibn Sa’ud’s personal courage is beyond question, but he not uncommonly falls short as a tactician, and Mubarak of Kuwait pronounced him to be a poor leader in battle. But if he had not dealt ibn Rashid a crushing blow, he had at least put him out of action and prevented him from joining the Turks, as he unquestionably would have done. The intervention of ibn Rashid in the early part of the Mesopotamian campaign might have added considerably to our difficulties. Nevertheless Captain Shakespear’s death was a heavy price to pay for the advantage of immobilizing him. The two chiefs held apart without further hostilities till the summer when an agreement dated June 10th w^as concluded between them. Ibn Rashid recognised ibn Sa’ud’s claims, except that of overlordship which he could scarcely Arab Burc«, herewith encioMi be e f P ec * e d t° acknowledge, and undertook not to play a treacherous game towards the Turkish Government but to incline towards whichever Government was in alliance with ibn Sa’ud. He confined his own jurisdiction to Hail and its villages and the Shammar tribes, while ibn Sa’ud w T as acknowledged to hold all Najd from A1 Khahaf to Dawasir. A1 Khahaf is no doubt the Kahafah of Hunter’s map, a little north of latitude 27°. In a tribal country the adjustment of frontiers can never be very exact, but it is clear that ibn Rashid renounced all pretensions to the Qasim, a province whose rich oases had frequently changed hands. It is of interest to note that the tribes reckoned as subject to ibn Sa’ud are the Mutair, ’Ataibah, Harb, Bani ’Abdullah, ’Ajman, Hurrah,'X 5 Manasir, Bani Haja, Subai, Sahul, Qahtan and Dawasir, but this catalogue must not be taken as exact, for the Mutair are mostly in Kuwait territory and the ’Ataibah and Harb come for the greater part under the Sharif. After Captain Shakespear’s death ibn Sa’ud sent an immediate request that another officer should be accredited to him or, failing this, that negotia tions should continue through his agent in Basrah, ’Abdul Latif Mandil. No suitable officer was available, but ibn Sa’ud was advised to sign a pre liminary agreement on the lines of Captain Shakespear’s draft and leave all details 'to 'be settled later. He signed and returned the new draft which had been sent to him but with some important modifications concerning which it seemed better to postpone further discussion till a meeting with the Chief Political Officer could be arranged. For the time therefore the conclusion of the treaty was suspended, ibn Sa’ud being wholly engaged with internal affairs His position at home at this epoch was the reverse of secure. Bus reputation among the tribes had suffered from the unsuccessful operations against ibn Rashid during which he had incurred much loss in material and equipments, and during the greater part of 1915 he was engaged with a dangerous rising in the Hasa on the part of the ’A]man. He nimseli believed that the revolt was instigated by the Turks and Ibn Rashid, but it is doubt ful whether his view' w as correct. Mubarak of Kuwait w r as convinced that there w T as no evidence to support it, but Mubarak, during the last few’ years of his reign, was not a lenient critic of ibn Sa’ud’s difficulties. His opinion is so far borne out that the troubles with the ’A]man seem „ . to have begun with the occupation of the Arafc Bure..a, 26th Jaly 1916. Hasa by the Amir ia 1913. Up to that time the tribe had been on good terms wuth him and had generally recognized him as suzerain, but the extension of his direct authority to the Hasa, which is their headquarters, had strained their allegiance. He attempted to impose a poll tax upon them and stopped them from taking dues from caravans passing through the country, a toll which they had been accustomed to exact in the days of the Turks. The discontent of the ’Ajman was fanned by members of ibn Sa’ud’s family who had long been at enmity with him, the ’Araif, grandsons of his uncle Sa’ud. Two of the ’Araif cousins, Fahad ibn Sa’ud and Salman ibn Muhammad, had taken refuge w r ith the Bahrain. The Shaikh made a half-hearted attempt to patch up a tion in 1914, but the ’Araif refused his mediation and sought the of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, from whom they received when hostilities were renewed with ibn Sa’ud in 1915. Shaikh of reconcilia- protection some countenance The rebellion now assumed serious proportions. Ibn Sa’ud sent for more troops from Riyadh and asked help from Kuwait, but before the arrival of either reinforcement he attacked the ’Ajman by night near Hofuf and met wdth a reverse, due partly to the cow r ardice of the Ilofuf towm levies. His brother Sa’ud w’as killed and he himself wounded. For a time his fortunes were at a very low T ebb. He was in want of money and arms, and for all practical purposes was besieged in Hofuf. Ibn Rashid, oblivious of the agreement recently signed, seized the opportunity to raid the Qasim, but his advance was easily stopped, and the arrival of a force from Kuwait under the Shaikh’s son, Salim, turned the balance in the Hasa. The ’Ajman were routed in September, harried on their retreat northwards by the Bani Khalid and forced to take refuge in .Kuwait territory, where they remained until Shaikh Mubarak’s death in December. Fahad ibn Sa’ud w’as killed in the retreat : Salman made his peace with ibn Sa’ud at the end of the year. During the struggle w e had facilitated the despatch of ammunition to ibn Sa’ud from Bahrain and done what w’e could to restrain Abu Dhabi : in October we presented ibn Sa’ud with 1,000 rifles and gave him a loan of £20,000. The Turks had not yet abandoned all hope of winning him over, and in July previous to ibn Rashid’s raid a Turkish emissary, Salih al Sharif al Hasni, communicated with him and proposed a meeting : but his request was refused, and on December 2oth ibn Sa’ud met Sir Percy Cox at Qatif and the long delayed treaty was completed and signed. Subject to certain safeguards it provided ibn Sa’ud with a dynastic guarantee in the dominions now in his possession and promised him the support of Great Britain in case of unprovokedaggression from foreign Powers. On his side ibn Sa’ud engaged to hold no correspondence with any foreign Power and to grant no concessions to foreigners, to keep open the roads to the Holy Places and to commit no aggressive act on other Shaikhs under our protection. Ibn Sa’ud was unaware of the exceedingly confidential correspondence which we had been carrying on with the Sharif during the winter of 1915-1010, but the results to which it led could not leave him indifferent. Relations between the Hijaz and Najd had been dictated by conflicting sentiments. The Sharif had even mere reason than ibn Sa’ud to fear the Turks, but he was jealous of ibn Sa’ud’s position as an Arab Chief, and the feeling was reciprocated in'Riyadh. The fluctuating allegiance of the tribes is a rich source of discord in Arabia, and the absence of any defined frontiers enhances the uncertainty of claims and obligations. In 1910 the Sharif ’Abdullah, asserting that he acted on behalf of the Ottoman Government, marched to the borders of the Qasim for the purpose of re-asserting an authority which was probably a thing of the past and must at the best have been shadowy. The tangible results of the raid do not seem to have been more than a re-insistance on the Sharif’s suzerainty over the distant sections of the ’Ataibah, a tribe which had once been under ibn Sa’ud but had largely seceded to the Sharif. 4. smull tribute to Mecca from the Qasim villages ■was stipulated for by ’Abdullah before his withdrawal, but it is unlikely that it was ever paid. Prom 1913 the Sharif show r ed strong anti-Turkish proclivities, and before the outbreak of war he and Ibn Sa’ud drew together. They were in correspon dence when Captain Shakespear paid his first visit to Riyadh in the spring of 1914. In January 1915, they were acting in concert, and ihn Sa’ud told Captain Shakespear that in his view the Khalifate would revert to the family of the Prophet, of which the Sharif was the representative, if it dropped from the hand of the Sultan of Turkey. In November 1915, ’Abdullah reappeared in Najd, with what object is not very clear. His ow r n explanation was that he was sent on a mission to ibn Sa’ud, with the further purpose of collecting dues in the Qasim and Sudair. Except for a doubtful suzerainty over wandering sections of the ’Ataibah, the Sharif does not seem in Beduin estimation to have rights in either province, his limits eastwards being some where between Longitude 44° and Longitude 45° at Sba’arah, Huwadmi, Jabal Dhurai and Jabal al Nir. ’Abdullah is not reported to have advanced much beyond Sha’arah: he collected dues from the ’Ataibah, subdued the small allied section of the Buraih (by origin Mutair) and returned to the Hijaz : but ibn Sa’ud, barely emerged from a perilous contest in the Hasa, not unreason ably regarded the expedition as inopportune and even suspicious. (These sentiments were reflected in his conversations with Sir Percy Cox in December. He reminded the Chief Political Officer that the Wahabis recognized no Khalif after the first four, and w as careful to add that if the Sharif should assume the title it w^ould make no difference to his status among other ruling Chiefs.) In June of the following year the Sharif rose in open rebellion against the Turks and declared the independence of the Arabs. Ibn Sa’ud, writing in July to the Chief Political Officer, Arab Bureau, 2nd August 1916- acknowledged the receipt from him of official news with regard to the Hijaz, expressed his satisfaction at the discomfiture of the Turks, but put forward his own apprehensions that the Sharif might proceed to claim authority over parts of Najd, and in support of this fear observed that in declaring the inde pendence of “ the Arabs ” the Sharif appeared to treat them as a compendious whole, an attitude which he regarded with anxiety. In August he wrote again, saying that he had now received a letter from Arab bureau, 9lb Auguat 19:6. t ’ le Sllarif in wLich the latter announced the occupation of Mecca and asked him for his help. Ibn Sa’ud gave a summary of his reply, and a copy of the original Herewith eneloaed. letter haS sinCe 1)6611 received. ° He assured the Sharif that he would render all assistance which was in his power, but asked for a written undertaking that the Sharif w r ould abstain from trespassing in his territory or interfering with his subjects. Ibn Sa’ud went on to ask Sir Percy Cox w r hetker hi&amp;relations with the Sharif might be regarded as a matter which affected the two chieJs alone, or wdiether they touched on our interests, in which case he would be guided by our wishes. According to Arab reports received at Kuwait the Sharif wrote three times to ibn Sa’ud asking for aid, and on two occasions sent him £2,000. Not improbably there is some truth in the rumoured remittance of small sums. The Sharif’s answer, dated September 5, to ibn Sa’ud’s letterwas, to say TT „ , ,. . , the least of it, unconciliatc ry and aroused Herewith forwarded to Arab Bureau. , . ,. , . .. T - r * / . , .. , his lively indignation. His letter and the draft undertaking which had been sent with it for the Sharif’s acceptance were sent back with the observation that ibn Sa’ud’s request could emanate only from a man bereft of reason. About the same time ibu Sa’ud received a letter from ’All Haidar acquainting him with his appointment as Sharif in place of Husain by the Ottoman Government, and calling on him to join the * J^acZ, but in his reply ibn Sa’ud express- ed the resentment telt by the Arabs towards him and towards the Turks. The Chief Political Officer dealt at length with the Hijaz question in * u rw* im* a letter to ibn Sa’ud dated October 19th. He pointed out how important it was to the Arab cause, which it was the policy of the British Government to support, that all the great Arab chiefs should work together and in co-operation with us in the common task of expelling tbe Turks from Arabia As to ibn Sa’ud’s own position he need have no misgivings for he had been acknowledged by us to be an independent ruler and the Sharif must recognize the full import of the treaty. The British Government had no reason to believe that he enter tained any hostile intentions against the tribes and territcries of Najd. In the negotiation over the treaty in December 1915, Sir Percy Cox had discussed with ibn Sa’ud the possibility of his giving us assistance against ibn Bashid. The Hakim of Najd then thought that ibn Rashid would either come in or maintain a strict neutiality, if however he show ed himself actively hostile, ibn Sa’ud would atlack him and incite the northern ’Anazah against him. This intention how ever he failed to carry out. During the spring and summer of 1916 be w as occupied w ith a rebellion of the Murrah, following on, ami perhaps connected with, that of the ’Ajman, which endangered his communications with the Hasa. Though a large proportion of the fighting men of the Shammar had gone north with ibn Bashid against the ’Iraq, no effective attack was made on Hail in their absence. In late June or early July, ibn Sa’ud’s son, Turki, raided Jabal Shammar, and the news may have hastened Ibn Rashid’s retreat from our frontiers. In September or October Turki renewed hostilities against some of the Shammar Shaikhs and an allied section of the Harb, but the affair resulted only in the capture of a small amount of booty, and ibn Sa’ud’s doctor, passing through Bahrain, brought a messnge to the effect that the Amir could do nothing against the Shammar as long as the fugitive ’Ajman remained on his flank. The true reason for his inactivity was no doubt his ow r n insecurity at home, but the implacable hostility w hich he entertained tow ards the ’Ajman, whom he regarded not only as rebels but as the murderers of his brother Sa’ud, threatened to become a problem, of some difficulty. When Shaikh Mubarak died in December 1915, ibn Sa’ud pressed his son and successor in Kuwait, Jabir, to drhe out the ’Ajman Shaikhs. Jabir made a temperate reply. He was unwilling to eject the ’Ajman, fearing that they w r ould be thrown into the enemy camp ; but he could not hold out against ibn Sa’ud’s insistance without creating an open breach and he expelled the tribe in February 1916. As he anticipated, they turned for protection first to Ajaimi and then to ibn Rashid, but in May they asked and obtained permission from the Shaikh of Zubair to settle quietly near Safwan and subsequently several of the leading Shaikhs made submission to us. When ibn Rashid returned to Hail only tw T o of the ’Ajman Shaikhs remained w ith Ajaimi and they had little or no following. Ibn Sa’ud’s ardent desire to direct his energies upon the extermination of this tribe was not one with which we had any sympathy, at all events at the present juncture. i |Shaikh Jabir, new to his office, could not hope to exercise the influence over ibn Sa’ud which bad been possessed by that practised and weighty diplomatist his father : moreover for some years before Mubarak’s death relations between Riyadh and Kuwait had been growing cooler. Ibn Sa’ud bitterly resented , Mubarak’s attitude during the negotiations between himself and the Ottoman Government in the spring of 1914. According to his account the Shaikh had at first counselled him hTaccept the Turkish offers, but when he reached Kuwait in April Mubarak changed his note, without explanation, and advised ibn Sa'ud not to come to terms with the Turks, refusing, at the same time, to be present at his meeting with the delegates. So indignant was the Amir that he expressly stipulated with Captain Shakespear that Mubarak should not be con sulted in the negotiations with ourselves. The asylum given to the ’Ajman was ^ 0i , A .. , Me another grievance, and in 1916 ibn Sa’ud Arab Bureau, 8th Apni 1916. complained of the incidence of the transit dues which had been, from time immemorial, levied in Kuwait. While ibn Sa’ud’s anxiety as to the ambitions of the Sharif, and h's growing estrangement with Kuwait showed that the chiefs allied with ourselves had not reached a satisfactory understanding with each other, there was evidence that the Turks were still active in Arabia, News was received from ibn Sa’ud and from other sources of the despatch of an agent (Muhammad) Taufiq ibn Eara’un of Damascus, for the purpose of buying camels for the Ottoman Government ; the emissary was well chosen, for he was a personal friend of ibn Sa’ud and had visited Najd on the same business the previous year. Rut on this occasion the Amir was pressed by us to prevent Arab Bmeau, i9th September 1916 . him from obtaining camels : he accord ingly arrested ibn Fara’un, confiscated 700 camels which had been purchased in the interior and sent them to Kuwait. Various reports, some of which „ , , ^ came from ibn Sa’ud, indicated that Arab Bureau, ereuit i ei.c ose another attempt to stir up ibn Rashid against us was in the wind. Rushaid ibn Lailah, ibn Rashid’s representative at Constantinople, joined him at Hail with a few German and Turkish officers, a small body of Turkish soldiers and some guns; accounts varied as to the exact composition of the mission, but its presence in Hail in some form seemed fairly certain. Ibn Sa’ud had written in September that he would be glad of a personal interview with the Chief Political Officer to discuss the question of co-operation with the Sharif or offensive action against ibn Rashid. In October he repeated the request urgently, and on all grounds it seemed advisable to accede to it. Sir Percy Cox met him at Ojair on November 11. Ibn Sa’ud explained to him his position in detail. He had lost considerably, in men and material, in the fight with ibn Rashid in January 1915. Since then he had been almost continuously in the field, first against the ’Ajinan and then against the Murrain Most of the normal trade of ISajd was with Syria, and the tribes were accustomed to sell their camels to Damascene dealers: the strict blockade imposed by ibn Sa’ud—the seizure of ibn Eara’un’s camels bore witness to its reality—grew more and more galling : the Najdis grumbled, the tribes were restless, all asked wherein lay the advantasre to themselvee of their Chief’s attitude, and it was increasingly difficult for him to keep them in hand. 'With regard to the Sharif, Sir Percy Cox was able to give ibn Sa'ud the fullest reassurance. Our treaty with the Amir had been communicated to Mecca, and when the Sharif announced to us his intention of proclaiming himself king of the Arabs on November 5, we had insisted on a formal admission that he claimed no jurisdiction over independent rulers. The news - of the coronation at Mecca, had not yet reached Central Arabia and was not discussed. During conversation with the Chief Political Officer at Basrah ibn Sa’ud made a passing remark about the Sharif’s calling himself “ Sultan ”, but his mind seemed to be set completely at rest on hearing that his rights were safeguarded by us and that the Sharif had explicitly denied any design on the independence of himself or his compeers. Ibn Sa’ud having expressed to the Chief Political Officer at their meeting at Ojair his inclination to pay a brief visit to Shaikh Jabir of Kuwait before returning home, the project was cordially encouraged as appearing eminentlyexpedient, and Sir Percy Cox recommended that he should he presented with the K.C.I.E. at a majlis which was to be held at Kuwait where the Shaikh was to be invested with the C.S.I. When he intimated to ibn Sa’ud that this honour was to be accorded to him, the Chief Political Officer was authorised to inform at the same time that his rights had been carefully reserved in all dealings which the British Government had held with the Sharif, and ibn Arab Bureau, herewith forwarded. Sa’ud in his reply said that IlO Was entirely satisfied on this point. The majlis took place on November 2Cth. The Shaikh of Mubammerah had come to Kuwait for the occasion and many Beduin were present, including the friendly headmen of the Shammar Aslam, and Dhafir, and Shaikhs of the Mutair. The Chief Political Officer, in presenting the decorations, alluded to our satisfaction in feeling that the great Arab chiefs were bent with us upon a common purpose. The Shaikh of Muhammerah followed him with words which were warmly pro-British, and ibn Sa’ud struck the key-note of the meeting in a speech which was as spontaneous as it Avas unexpected. He said that the Turks had placed themselves outside the pale of Islam by the iniquities which they had committed on other Moslems. He contrasted their policy with that of Great Britain, pointing out that the Turks had sought to weaken the Arabs by fomenting their differences, whereas the British Govern ment encouraged them to unite in their own interest. He praised the action of the Sharif and urged the obligation of all true Arabs to co-operate with him in forwarding the Arab cause. When he had brought his speech to an eloquent close, the three chiefs, Kuwait, Muhammerah and ibn Sa’ud, swore together that they would work with us for the achievement of a common end. This scene made a deep impression on the local notables and on the Beduin Shaikhs present who wall no doubt carry the tale far and wide. During the receptions at Kuwait, ibn Sa’ud showed in all his utterances how clearly he had grasped the principle which guides our relations with Arabia. He quoted as an example of our benevolent policy towards the Arab cause the fact that we were ready even to promote a reconciliation between himself and ibn Bashid if the latter would abandon his attitude of hostility. The arrival of ibn Para’un’s 700 fine camels, each branded with the wasm of that well- known dealer, gave a dramatic completeness to the Kuwait gathering. From Kuw r ait ibn Sa’ud went to Muhammerah as the guest of Shaikh Khaz’al who co-operated most heartily in the endeavour to make ibn Sa’ud’s visit profitable to him. The two chiefs arrived at Basrah on the evening of November 2(3. Early next morning the Chief Political Officer accompanied by two chief military representatives of the Army Commander present in Basrah went on board the Shaikh s launch and presented ibn Sa’ud with a sword of honour and a message of welcome from the Army Commander. The day was spent, in exhibiting to him the Base Camps and organisation and the latest machinery of warfare including the aircraft in which he took an eager interest. Dhari ibn Twalah and Humud al Suwait, Shaikhs of the Shammar Aslam and the Dhafir, were present, while Shaikh Ibrahim of Zubair and several Sunni notables of Basrah and refuges from Baghdad had an audience with ibn Sa’ud on the launch. The Kuwait Durbar and ibn Sa’ud’s visit to Basrah have placed us in a singularly strong position. Three powerful chiefs have made public protesta tion of their friendship with each other and their confidence in the British Government. A telegram received from the Sharif, congratulating them upon their zeal in the Arab cause and regretting that he had not had time to send a representative to Kuwait, confirmed the identity of his aims with their own, and in a further message he apologized for any deficiencies in his previous letters, on the ground that while he was in the throes of war he might un intentionally fall short as a correspondent. The dream of Arab unity Avhich engaged the imagination of the Liberals of Damascus during the year before the war, has been brought nearer fulfilment than dreams are wont to come, but the role of presiding genius has been recast. Instead of the bril liant, unscrupulous Saiyid Talib, gyrating in the blast of his own ambition, the chiefs of Eastern and Western Arabia have united at the instance of the British Government.Besides this knitting together of Arab leaders, the meeting at Kuwait has produced certain immcdinte results. In the first place the extent and nature of ibn Sa’ud’s share in future hostilities with ibn Rashid, if such should occur, was agreed upon. He undertook to maintain 4,000 men under arms .. if ibn Rashid moved in force towards the ’Iraq he would move up parallel with him towards Zubair and join the friendly tribes and a contingent from Kuwait. He informed the friendly Shaikhs that he would support them if ibn Rashid threatened to attack them in strength. If, however, ibn Rashid should remain at Hail, ibn Sa’ud would harass and attack him as opportunity offered, using the Qasim as a base. In view of the strain upon his resources during the last two years, he has been given 3.000 rifles with ammunition, as veil as rcur machine guns, and granted a monthly subsidy of £5.000 to cover the expenses he will incur in maintaining his men in the field. Active co-operation with the Sharif was not considered practicable, but ibn Sa’ud was ready to send one of his sons with some 40 men to Mecca as a sign of good-will, if the Sharif would make a special request for them. Secondly, a letter was written by ibn Sa’dun, in the name of the three chiefs, to ’Ajaimi ibn Sa’dun urging upon him the harm which he was doing to the Arab cause by his present attitude, Arab Bureau, herewith enclosed. inviting him to enter into commumcation with them and promising him friendly consideration and an opportunity for honourable submission. Finally, with the co-operation of Shaikh Jabir of Kuwait and the diplo matic skill of the Shaikh of Mukammerah who was throughout of the highest service to the Chief Political Officer the delicate problem raised by the presence of the ’Ajman among the friendly tribes reached a satisfactory solu tion. For the period of the war a truce between ibn Sa’ud and the ’Ajman was agreed upon and instructions were drafted defining the position of the , , fugitive Shaikhs with respect to all tribes Arab Bureau, herewith enclosed. , .. ^ , under our protection. On his return to Basrah, Sir Percy Cox called in the ’Ajman leaders. They had been pro foundly disquieted by the advent of ibn Sa’ud thinking that it augured ill for themselves, but the principal and more courageous headmen met the Chief Political Officer at Zubair and accepted the proposed terms, in return for which they were promised a monthly allowance similar to that received by the other friendly Shaikhs of the Shamiyah They evinced little doubt that the remaining headmen of the ’Ajman, including the two wffio were still with ’Ajaimi, would come in as soon as they heard of the happy issue of their own venture. Letters have been written to Fahad Beg ibn Hadhdhal informing him of the Kuwait meeting and inviting him to join the league of Arab chiefs in expelling the Turks. These have been sent through a man from Fahad Beg’s tents who w as in Basrah at tie time of ibn Sa’ud’s visit and went to see him at Muhammerah, where he received advice and instruction from Shaikh Khaz’al in full measure He was entrusted also with letters from the Sharif which have been waiting opportunity of despatch to Fahad Beg, Hachim al Muhaid, ’Ali Sulaiman of the Dulaim and others, and with presents in money to guide Fahad Beg’s decision and to encourage the amicable disposition of the Shaikh of the Dahamshah, Jaza’ ibn Mijlad. Communications of the same nature are on their way to ’Ath ah al Qulal of Najaf and Muhammad ’Aii Kamunah of Karbala. Enclosure No. 2.

(Note by bin Sa’ud.—This is a verbatim copy of the paper executed between myself and bin Rashid.) In the Name of God the most Merciful and Compassionate. This is the agreement between me Sa’ud bin Abdul Aziz bin Rashid and Abdul Aziz bin Sa’ud. That is to say.I, bin Rashid, hold jurisdiction over my territories, i e., Hail and its villages and over the Shammar tribe as they belong to me (bin Rashid) and the control of them rests with me. All the demands of bin Sa’ud from them (Shammar) in respect of losses, etc., and everything that they may oue to the subjects of bin Sa’ud I, bin Rashid, am answerable for it. That Najd and all the interior from A1 Kahaf to the valley of Huwasir and all territories of bin Sa’ud and the encampments of Mutair, ’Ataibah, Harb, Bani ’Abdullah, ’Ajman, A1 Murrab, A1 Manasir, Bani Hajar, Sabai, A1 Sahul, Qahtan and Al Duwasir and everybody included among them are subjects of bin Sa’ud. I, bin Rashid, have nothing to do with them. I, bin Rashid, will protect all Beduin of bin Saud and his subjects who may be in my terri- torry. The casting of lots of Shammar w T ill be as usual. And similarly bin Sa’ud will protect my adherents and I, bin Rashid, will not interfere with bin Sa’ud at all. Nor shall I act treacherously with him vis-a-ois the Turkish Government. It is incumbent upon me to incline with him to whichever Government is allied with him, and I have no intention to oppose his views. And hereafter there shall be uninterrupted brotherhood and friendship between us. I hereby give you, bin Sa’ud, my uord upon my honour and on the oath of God that there shall be no deception or treachery and I will not betray you or deceive you as regards what we have mentioned above. Upon this bond is the assurance and the oath of God and God is witness of what I say. SA’UD bin ABDUL AZIZ AL RASHID. (Seal.) Enclosure No. 3. Translation of letter from Abdul-Aziz ibn Abd-er-Hahman al-Faisal to Sir Percy Cox^ dated 21st September 1916. Alter compliments. After paying respects and enquiring about your precious health, I beg to say, in case you enquire about me, that I am quite well, thank God, and pre serve my regard and friendship for you. And my affairs, thanks to God, are prospering. Previous to this, I sent you several letters, but have not yet received replies, may the motive be favourable. And I beg to state that in these days, my son Turki has proceeded to wards Hayel to take his revenge of them. On his way, about one day’s run from Hayel, he came across several parties of ibn Rashid’s Arabs, who had come to him for refuge with him from the Shammar and Harb and Hatim and God helped Turki against them, and he pursued them getting from them much booty and killing a lot of their men ; I am consequently pleased to tell you this. I am awaiting the good news of your victories over the enemy, and the victories of the Great Government and her Allies. With regard to the news from the Hejaz and the fighting of the sons of the Sharif against the Turks, encounters and skirmishes have taken place between them, but I have not yet ascertained the true facts and, inshallah, I will certainly apprise you of them after ascertaining same. And I beg to inform you with effect to ’Ajman wLo are located at Safwan that you are aware of their relations with me and that nothing during that time prevented me from punishing them except the hot weather ; for if we wished to march against them via the coast of the sea, water w ould have been abundant in Kuwait sides, where they had certainly confederates and spies w r ho w r ould have warned them, and they would have cleared off before we could reach them, moreover the distance w as great. On the other hand on the inland side our towns are barren and devoid of w : ater. It is only now and later that we can operate w r hen tke w r eather is cool.They have in these days sent to me messengers with letters asking that I will amnesty them. But I know that they do net really aim at a truce nor will they make confidence in me, on account of their bad deeds in the past which are not hidden from you. They hope to deceive me and thus attain their purposes, and by w'asting time make off to any other place they like. More over they are ignorant, their knowledge and control being in the hands of Dhaidau and Khumsiyis, who is now wdth bin Rashid’s men and with bin Saedun. The former is their overlord and they do not act without his orders, while the latter is influencing in any way he wishes. I have, however, granted them amnesty, provided they coine to the direction of Najd, and provided their Shaikhs come to me. It is probable that they will accept that. My intention is to clear them off from this direc tion, for if they remain on this side, they may cause disturbance in one of the two following ways :—Either they will be at the bidding of bin Rashid and bin Sa’adun at any time they like, or else they will certainly aggress on my tribesmen, who will then be forced to pursue them. As I have mentioned above, it is known to you that operations on this side which are in your hands will harm some of the tribes. If therefore you think it better that they should clear off from the side of Zobier and Kuwait, I should find it, too much more convenient as I depend firstly on God and secondly on you, and am acting in pursuance of your orders to me, and secondly because the harm caused by their remaining there will be great. Interested people or persons ignorant of the real facts may say to you : “ I am afraid that if they go they w r ill side with bin Rashid or with bin Sa’adun, and then some hostile action on their part may ensue. As regards the possibility of their joining the said individuals they are looked upon as some of their very subjects, and it is only by the previous machinations of bin Rashid that they have become so, may God confound them. Therefore I wished now to express to you my thoughts, and there is no doubt that you are more careful on my interests than I am myself. Also your policy must have been well acquainted with their affairs in relation to bin Rashid. I have, to say the truth, stated too much, for which I request you to be so kind as to forgive. May the Creator keep you safe and may He protect you. (Seal.) Dated 22nd ThiUKidah 1334—21st September 1916.

In the Name of God, the Compassionate and Merciful. After profound salams: This is to enquire about your august health. As regards ourselves, w 7 e are, thanks to God, quite well and happy. ° While expectant of good news of your success and prosperity, we received with the hand of affection your letter, announcing your well being, and w r ewere very glad to read it, aad hoped for continuance of same. As regards your expressions of desire and wish for close relations, this is a proved and well known fact, more manifest than the sun at noon. May God perpetuate uninterruptedly this friendly attitude so long as days and years endure. As to your good news regarding the hostile operations conducted by your honoured son Turki against certain Arabs, and his victory over them, we thank God for this success. Inshallah, you will always be prosperous and victorious. Further we beg to offer complete salams to your noble father, your brothers, and all your sons. Here, our son Jasib and his brothers present their deep salutations. Please continue always sending your letters, informing me of your well being, and also keep me informed of your requirements, which will be duly carried out. This is for favour of information. Salams. 21st Dhil-Hijjah 1334, Oth Octohev 1916, Postscript. We beg, merely for the sake ot information, to write to you what occurs to our mind, namely that it is acknowledged and known that our three famines, i e., yours, al-Sabah’s, and ours, are completely united, and are considered as one dynasty, the interests of which are all the same, for thus runs adage, “ wish for your friend what you wish for yourself”. With reference to this Power, Great Britain, their regard for Your Excellency, and their kindness to all is not hidden. Their motto being to appreciate the merits of their loyal friends. We cease not (and God is witness) to behold their friendship for you. All representatives of this Great Government are statisfied wdth you, especially His Honour Sir Percy Cox, w'ho always manifest to his satisfaction with Your Excellency. Therefore we request Your Excellency to grow more and more in your loyalty to this Government, for they appreciate their obligation to their loyal friends. Even the humblest merit does not pass unrecognised by them, and their justice is famous. Though to apprise you of such facts is a liberty on our part, we were merely by way of correspondence desirous of telling you (although you are well aw r are of the attitude of this Government and of the inner intentions of their sincere representatives) that we desire that our three families should adopt one policy, and should consider the only interest of this Great and Just Kingdom. Abdul Aziz ar-Bobai will certainly apprise you of the strength and organization which he has seen to exist in Basrah, which are increasing daily. Further Postscript. As regards your previous letter, it duly reached us, and because it w as in reply to our letter, that is why we were slow to answer soon. Your demand^wdiich you mentioned with effect to the ’Ajman was, by the Grace of God and according to what we heard, performed in the mode you wish, they did not dare to do anything on account of your brother Shaikh Jabir’s attitude. The union of our three families is, by God’s will, becoming more com plete day by day. There exists, moreover, affection on the part of your brother, Shaikh Jabir, towards you, even more than that of his late father though the latter w^as accepted as the father of all. But, truly, Shaikh Jabir desires to confirm by any means his regard for you. Inshallah you will, by and by, behold what will increase your confidence in his regard and' concord. You are doubtless certain in your mind that we are °exertin°&gt; / 514 ourselves very fully in cementing the friendly relations of our three families and descendants, for we feel it is our duty and obligation to do so and your man Abdul Aziz ar Eobai will certainly corroborate the regard and accord he has experienced from us. And we are pleased to learn from your brother, Shaikh Jabir, that you have a mind to proceed to the place of all, Kuwait. Please God this good news, which I was glad to receive, will take shape, so that, inshallah, we may meet you happy and in good health, and may be fortunate to see your countenance. AMIN. Enclosure No. 5. Translation of a letter from Sharif Hussain of Mecca to Abdul Aziz ibn Saud^ 6th Zill Qoiada 1334. After compliments. Your Honour’s letter of I3th Shawalhas reached me and the contents have been understood, and what you mentioned about the continuance of your good health has pleased me. But as regards your observations, they can only emanate from a man bereft of his reason or of an absent mind. But thank God we are capable of enduring more than this from persons of less amount than you, and this time it is one duty to hear it also from you. But O ! Bather of Turki, if you believe in God and in the Day of Judgment it is to be denied that you should not busy yourself with what there is no cause for. You see that I am coirvinced that we are co«partners except in regard to ■what God has forbidden. This is the right and the truth and there is no mystery behind it. If you realise this and rid yourself of doubt and suspicion (which are not right on the part of people like yourself) this is what is to be expected from the sagacity and perspicacity of persons such as you. Be it otherwise, I shaU realize that God has given you up, and there is no method in His will. But the request will demonstrate the truth. At any rate w r e are waiting to see how you have carried out what we communicated to you in our letter sent to you by Homaidhan, which dealt with the Asaiba and their news. This is what had to be explained and on (?) of the above it has been written. Seal of Sharif. P. S .—Your letter and its enclosure are sent by us enclosed herewith so that you may reflect in what you wrote to us in them. As regards what you desired us set forth in the enclosure, if God has dispersed your doubts there is in my opinion no need for it, while if your doubts are still being revived by the intentions of ibn Baraqn and people like him, then there is no use in it, for the result in writing in that sense will be that I shall receive from you a letter asking for its cancellation, just as you have asked me now to cancel what you wrote to us in this sense, and which Nasir bin Barhun brought to us under your confirmation, and which is in our hands. And God is with us and with you in good fortune. Seal of Sharif of Mecca. Enclosure No. 6. Translation of letter from ibn Sa'ud to the Sharif of Mecca) dated 13th Shawai 1334 = 15th August 1916. After presenting you with profound salams, and praying for thee that God may rest on you his blessings always, and after offering our obligatory regardsand respects to you, we beg to state that, previous to this, a letter was des patched to your honour, in which we told you what was sufficient. Your Honour (may God preserve you) knows that everything is based on its foundation, and the foundation of religion and of the world is Truth. And we (may you be preserved) in the first place deal with you and correspond about matters of which some are not true ; but it is not, please God, with any intention that there should be any estrangement between us. But we see that whereas many of our enemies and interested people are with you and you believe what they tell you and become suspicious of us, yet we are convinced that the real facts will be proved, in contrast to the gossip of enemies and people in general, which cannot endure ; and we have dealt with you in a manner which should neither displease you nor cause prejudice to you, and we will follow you for better or for worse. After the departure from here of your men bin Homaidhan and bin Twaiq, the messengers whom we had sent with bin Earoan, our intention was that they should incite the ’Ainzah against bin Rashid, returned to us. It is known to you that on their arrival in Syria, the Turkish authori ties lavished gifts on them, particularly in camels, and gave them large presents. No doubt from information which has reached me, they have exaggerated matters and are pleased (with their experiences). But our servants have, undoubtedly, apprised us of deeds done by the Turks, at which every Moslem and Arab closes his eyes with disgust. It became established and known to me that their only aim is the annihilation of Islam and of Moslems and especially Arabs ; and it is therefore incumbent that we should resolve to be sincere to you and to co-operate with you in any case, so that, inshallah, we may attain our subject, and that God may con found our enemies. Thus we shall not be blamed and shall he concentrating our energies and shall not have cause for regret. Well, O, Sayid 1 Now you are aware that even in the invocation we say “ O my God, forgive me and my parents In the past there existed a misunderstanding between us, which was increased last year by brother Abdullah and by his treating our brothers with contumely and his abuse of our religion and our chiefship. You know that the Rasul (may God bless him) said, “ In the event of a calamity happening, ransom ye yourself with your possessions without sacrificing your life, and if the calamity increases then pay the ransom with your life without sacrificing your religion ”. Now, if you (may God make you prominent) are a man desirious of our services, and if you desire us to co-operate with you, and that our forces be united, sooner or later, and that we should be, like a building, cemented with each other, these we desire you to give us a promise and your word on the lines of the paper enclosed with this letter, so that our mind may be at rest, and that we may exert ourselves, and in order that the feelings of our subjects may induce them to help us in anything we desire. By God, you should understand that we do not mean by these words any thing more than :— (i) That God may help you and us, that w r e may co-operate in the question of this religion, and (ii) That we are afraid of what we have seen of the actions of the pre sent Government towards Arabs and tow ards the mosques, which they have turned into quarters for troops. Their only object is the destruction of Islam and Moslems. Also when we saw r their activities in these expeditions, we were exasperated at it. But if our object was to attain worldly ambitions or achieve our own interests, you are aware of how others are exerting themselves. All that weA 16 i desire we can have, but God refuses that we should prefer our worldly interests to the zeal of lloslems and Arabs, and — (Hi That we rest assured in regard to your attitude, as we already mentioned, so that we may actually co-operate with you to our utmost power for the benefit of us all. Except on these terms, there can be no permanent understanding between us, especially regarding the question of interference with our tribes and subjects. So we request you to accept what we say and hear with it as advice and that you will perform what we ask in order that, inshallah, the purpose may be achieved and that co-operation may be afforded. This is what was necessary for your information. Please convey our salams to your noble sons. Here, our respected father, and our brothers and sons salute you. May you be preserved in safety.

Previous to this I sent you some letters dated 15th Shawal 1334 (15th August 1916), 10th, 13th and 22nd Ehill Qaadah 1334 (9th, 12th and 21st September 1916j in which I informed you in good time what was necessary to be communicated, but I regret to say that I have not received answers to them as yet and am indeed wondering at the non-arrival of replies, for your honour is aware that the continuance of correspondence during such days is a matter of the greatest importance. I therefore hope that the answers are on their way to me. You have already been informed that I have detained bin Earoun in custody and seized the camels he bought for the Turks. I have also made more strict the blockade against trade, and communications generally, with the Turks everywhere in my territory. In opposition to this action of mine, the Turkish Goverment sent to bin Rashid 25 (twenty-five) German and Turkish officers accompanied by guns (cannon), arms, and other necessaries and also about 300 soldiers and bin Rashid’s agent in Constantinople, Rashid bin Laila, and two days after arriving in Hail, the aforesaid Rashid proceeded with two German officers and a Turkish officer towards Iraq. Up to date I have not got information as to the movement of Bin Rashid and the soldiers mentioned above; but I am watching their movements and surely they will attempt some advance. I would also state that I would like to have a conference with you for which I have made up my mind to be in Hassa on the 10th of Muharram 1335 (7th November 1916). I request you to send an immediate answer as to whether I can have a chance of meeting you at the place you will fix and the time at which you can get leisure or else you will let me know your opinion. According to information I have received about the movement of the troops in Medina, they have given up the idea of marching to Holy Mecca and have fortified Medina with trenches. They have also taken steps to protect the railway and have also kept troops in Medina for defence, and the remaining soldiers whom they wanted to send to Mecca have returned to Syria. This is all I know and only wish the permanance of your friendship and the continuance of the news of your welfare. May God preserve you.17 &gt; Enclosure No. 8.

Your Honour stated that His Britannic Majesty’s Government, in their dealings with His Excellency the Sharif, were careful to reserve my rights, and that His Excellency the Sharif has no intention to interfere with my country and territories, which are confirmed as under my control since years. I am, anyhow, tranquil thanks to the presence of Great Britain, and the state of affairs between me and His Excellency the Sharif will he according to your wish, viz., that I should agree with His Excellency, though, thanks to God, my accord with him has been manifested since old times, for His Excel lency is the Father of Arabs. I am waiting to-day for your presence in the majlis which will be held by His Excellency, my dear brother, Shaikh Jabir: and I’ll be honoured by your delivering to me the Eminent Order. Our meeting with our brothers, Shaikh Khaza’al Khan and Shaikh Jahir, is one of the greatest fortunes and pleasures though, thanks to God, we see one soul: and you will, inshallah, see all what will please you in our eternal union. In conclusion, I offer best wishes for your Honour, together with my heartfelt thanks. May you be preserved. 23rd Moharram, 1335. (Seal.) Enclosure No. 11. Translation of letter from Abdul Aziz ibn Abd-er-Rahman al Faisal to Shaikh Ajaimi al Sa'adoun, dated and despatched on or about 30th November 1916. After compliments. As regards ourselves, thanks to God, w'e are quite well and happy, and our affairs are, through the generosity of God, very prosperous and such as would please you.19 Brother ! God has facilitated my arrival at my town Kuwait on the 22nd instant, in good condition of health and happiness. And my object is to meet my honoured brother, Shaikh Jaber, on his succession (as Shaikh of Kuwait) and to renew, inshallah, the perpetual alliance and co-operation for our benefit, prestige and happiness and, thanks to Providence, this our meeting coincided with the presence of our exalted brother, Shaikh Khaz’al Khan, so that we were greatly pleased. We have all determined unanimously to do what -will conduce to the honour of Arabs and enhance their greatness. And this your present attitude is a dangerous one and harmful to your own interests and those of the Arab race generally ; it is therefore incumbent on us to explain to you the portent of it, for you, my brother, are regarded as one of ourselves, and belong to one of the noblest of Arab elements and we wish ^ou prosperity and tranquillity and dignity just as we wish them for ourselves, in regard to every desirable circumstance which promotes the reputation of Arabs, honours them, and preserves their dignity: and this end will not be attained except by meetings and undertakings and sincere co-operation between us all. And according to our expectations and our confidence in your zeal and characteristic Arabian qualities, you will be obliged and gratified by whatever promotes the good name of the Arabs and their honour, and enhances their reputation. And we all expect from your Honour accord with us and a meeting with us on this basis, because we believe in your Arabian zeal, and because such a meeting will have a beneficial and desirable effect and an auspicious result for all of us. You should explain to us all that is in your mind and we will put ourselves in your place in regard to all matters affecting you which concern you in respect of honour and interests. If then you accept our views as above, this is the object of our desires ; if not, we shall be absolved from responsibility for we have explained matters to you by way of advice and guidance and we pray to God for a satisfactory and auspicious result. This is -what had to be explained. We request you to convey our salaams to brothers. Hue, the respected friends already referred to salute you. And may you be preserved safely.
