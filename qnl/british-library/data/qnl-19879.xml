Repeated to India, No.18; and Bushire, No.61. Dated l?tk receired 18th April 1923. The ouestion of Bahrain has arisen in a new form. A motion has been introduced by three Deputies, one of them bitterly anti-British, to give Bahrain the right to return a member to the Med;]lias. A demand for immediate discussion t was rejected, but the question was referred to a commission to report on this and other places not yet entitled to elect Deputies. It would of course be possible to make represent- -ations to the Persian GoTernment, and demand rejection of the motion. I hesitate to do so without your instructions and myself doubt the expediency of representations as they might not avail to stop the motion, and would certainly revive the oontroverey which we consider was termlnatea by correspondence with the Persian Government in 1906.

Please give your views, in regard to the last paragraph, as to the likelihood of Sheikh Isa issuing such a proclamation,- The question for consideration naturally arises as to what punishment persons aiding and abetting this audacious attempt of the Persian G-overnment should be liable, viz. imprisonment or deportation and forfeiture of land and goods. The threat. If made, should be carried into execution, and this might prove embarrass- -ing if Bahranis and Persians voted in large numbers. It would seem advisable that the proclamation should state that it issued with the consent and approval of the British Government. If the Sheikh should ask why Political does not himself deport, rejoinder would be that as the Sheikh's sovereignty is deliberately aimed at, appropriate actionin which he will have ths full support of th© Politi Agent, should come froai him# Say nothing to the Sheikh at present, but in your telegraphic reply to endeavour to appreciate his attitude in the event anticipated, and that of local Bahranis and Persians, Knox#Telegram P.X. From Political, Bahrain. To Resident, Bushire, N0.5S-C. Dated 22nd received 23rd April 1923. I doubt whether the Sheikh would be disposed to issue the strongly wordeti protest suggested in your telegram of the 19th April. Moreover he could not threat- -en punishment as he has no jurisdiction over Persians here. He could probably be induced to write me a letter requesting H«M •Government to protest vehemently on his behalf and to take the necessary steps to protect his U uvl position. This would/ua free to(?) issue a proclamation if desired. I do not anticipate that Bahranis will take any part in this affair. I believe that the leaders of Persians for many reasons do not desire the Persian G-ovt.'s i interference ,.but the soi disant Nationalist party might conceivably be (three groups mutilated). Punishment by imprisonment would be embarrassing and (?) the Sheikh of Bahrain would be unlikely to request me to deport; we could do so however if I had powers suggested in your letter No.29-S. of January 20th, addressed to Foreign. The letter from the Sheikh of Bahrain auggest- -ed would justify our action. If early sanction of Govt, could be obtained to the proposals contained in your letter No•894-S. of December 5rd 1922 addressed to Foreign, do you not consider that it would strengthen our position? The Sheikh of Bahrain recently complained to me in-this connection of the numbers of Persians immigrating nowadays, who are both indigent and undesirable.

Persian claims to Bahrain have also been raised locally by the Karguzar, Arabistan informing the Consul at Mohammerah that under instructions from the Foreign Ministry passengersi to Bahrain must have local passport, and idahrainis travelling from the interior to foreign places 'should also be treated as Persian subjects'. I have similar complaints from other ports on the Persian littoral. I think now that som&lt;? action on our part is unavoidable. I consider that the strong proclamation by the Sheikh, as suggested by the Minister, would be useful and should be issued in repudiation of this dual attack on his sovereignty. I hope that the Sheikh will agree to this course willingly; if not, I think he must be induced to take a stand, but consider this may depend on how far Government is prepared to coerce Bahrain, (i.e. your endorsement No.459.E£t., not yet received but quoted in telegram under reply) and approval by His Majesty's Govt. He has power to deport Persians who might aid and abet this attempt on his position in defiance of his wishes, and should be urged to use it. fis regards passports, it is for consideration whether the time has come to take retaliatory measures suggested by the Minister (see his telegram No.264 of 8-11-22., and your despatch No.37/4-30 Ext. to the Secretary of State for India, dated 11-1-23.). Last January the Minister was anxious not to use this weapon, hoping that the new Persian Government might turn out friendly. But the position has now altered. I am reluctant however to suggest use of what may provB to be a double edged tool, and would 7c©rtciinly b© accoptGcl as a. cl0cl8.rat.ion o.' war* on tli© ' question of tha status of Bahrain. It might perhaps be better to keep this power in resop to be used if and when the battle has been frankly joj as a last resort. . . . tk KjM t ^ He. sits ^ www ; a /o./i ^ Knox.The Residency, Bushire, the 26th April 192?:. n.o .No. /^-s. ^ cte^* P1 ev. f- o r ef er to your t el or; ram ^ o . 515-.

No.429. Dated 11th May 192S. Please refer to my telegrams Nos.424and 425. I propose to take the following action with a view to pacification of the island: Arrest Q,asaibi and take him to Kuwait where he can be handed over to Bin Baud's agent for Customs negotiations, and returned to Nejd for his mastfer to deal with. I would send a letter to Bin Saud telling him that his agent has caused serious trouble ih Bahrain, and that I hold that agent responsible for bloodshed which has bean caused, for it is unthinkable that Persians are the aggressors. I may have to get rid of a Persian or two as well, but will act after appreciation of causes that led to present trouble. I would at the same time warn Dowasir headmen in Bahrain that if there is any recrudescence of trouble, I will have their boats Kept out of this pearling season, and to help them to be respons- -ible for their coreligionists, would express readiness to deport at once to A1 Ahsa any turbulent ringleaders whom they choose to point out. With regard to the return of any agent of Bin Saud to Bahrain, I would point out to him that we have warned off French, Grermans and others and we do not propose to allow him to upset status quo, and that he must consult us about new agent, who must have definite instructions to confine himself to purely commercial ends and hold strictly aloof from Consular functions and internal administration of Bahrain. This would be best done from Kuwait where I propose to go on as soon as I can safely leave Bahrain. I see the possibility of putting the Customs1 1*' 11. i questionx at Kuwait in the way of settlement. Daly*8 recent letters from Bahrain encourage me to hope that we can either get a proclamation out of thee Sheikh or permission to deport foreigners, and would ask permission for free hand to settle Bahrain difficulty in one of these ways, whichever appears the most feasible. The time of the proclamation, whether from us or the Sheikh, preferably from the latter, would be postponed until after departure of the gunboat from the island, for I entirely share the view of advisability that Sheikh should appear to act of his own free will, and I do not despair of carrying him with me. If you agree, kindly have instructions sent to the S.N.O. Persian Gulf to give all assistance in his power. I have warned him of my requirements. Knox. Telegram ?• From ^ Resident, Bushire.

His Highness listened carefully to what I had to say but did not offer any comment- He said however that there was also a question being raised about Bahrain• T told Lis Highness that I was quite aware of this and that very likely he would shortly receive an official connunication from me on the subject* For the moment I was withholding any representation because I understood that the motion brought forward in the liajlis for authorising Bahrain to return a deputy to that Assembly had been shelved and apparcnoly removed from the Agenda of the Chamber. As His Highness had however mentioned the subject, I thought it t.o be my duty to him as a loyal friend, to warn him in a friendly way The Most Honourable The Marque a3 Curzon of Kedleston K.G., etc.. etc etc, poreign Office*p 4 way of the undesirability of this question being raised or of any attempt being made to revive Persian pretentions to the Sovereignty of the Island. I reminded His Highness of the history of the Island, with which he seemed very imperfectly acquainted, and of the fact that since 1783 no form of Persian administration ♦ had been exercised in Bahrain* that au that time the Persians had been finally driven out of the island by the Arabs, that they had never made any attempt bo re L.o&gt;.V:.e xt, and that later on the island had become a British pro tectorate. That was the present situation and His Ua^esty's Government would unhesitatingly reject any attempt on the part of Persia or any otner country to claim the sovereignty of Bahrain. I therefore trueted that the Persian Governraont would he careful to refrain from any action in that sense which would he inadvisable at any time, hut espeoia^y at a ■ raomont when His Highness, as he had told me several txnes, aimed at a restoration of the old relations of friendly and mutual confidence hetwoen Great Britain and Persia. , t pr. this Despatch (bo the Govern- I am forwarding copies o,.

I yesterday discussed this question unofficially and in detail with the Minister fcr Foreign Affairs and made clear the fundamental point at issue. Ee pointed cut that public feeling in regard tc this island, which cnoe beicnged tc Persia, made it quite impossible for any government to attempt tc waive tneir claim to sovereignty or even tc effect a ecmpromise. On the other hand he assured me that it was not the intention of the government now In power tc raise toe question. In reply X expressed my inaoility to s^e wi material benefit Persia could obtain by reverting to euch a barren issue, which had already been argued seme ten times in the last 80 years. They might Just as well put in a claim tc Delhi cr Smyrna. V7e should, of course, challenge any such renewed claim and repudiate it in fact and law and in relation to the existing situation; should they endeavour it hv re -conquest, such action wculd be an to enforce it oy re-Guu^ act of war against Great Britain. Ihe Minister for Foreign Affairs admitted t i cs-iid but again urged the mcral the truth of all I had saio. but fc _ , , impossibility of abandoning a claim, so long maintains . without producing adequate reasons fcr such a ouI tnen asked him unofficially and without pre judice tc either of us whether he thought the Persian Government would be prepared to go to arbitration and if so whether the award of the court, which could net 'but be in our favour, would be accepted and dispose of the difficulty once and for all. He gave an affirmative reply to both questions. The claim, dates from 1822 and has always been ct cause of trcuble; if we can achieve a i mal settle ment by arbitration, there seems to be much to be said for it. We have learnt by experience that no written arguments, however sound, will affect Persian policy, on the other hand, it appears from tne i 'crei E n Minister's altitude that the decision of an impartial unpire would te accepted. Furthermore, cur case should be easy tc present, and I know of ne reason why the result should he anything hut favouracle. Would such a solution receive the approval of His Majesty's Gcverr^ent? The matter could he arbitrated privately or by the Hague tribunal or t.ie league of Hations, as might seem best.iPY. j . 9890/67/91) Lord Curzen to Sir P. Lcraine (Tehran), Foreign Office, 8th Octcber,1923, 2,45 p.m. Bahrein. I do not consider that the settlement cf the Persian claim to this island by arbitration can be entertained at this moment and under sivistxng ccn- ditions. Had it occurred to me that you might take any aoticn, such as that set forth in your telegraw of the 4th instant, I would have explained the position to ycu. What further aoticn, if any, should be taken depends ^whether or no ycu Uftdertcok to refer trie suggestion to me» If you gave no such undertaking no action appears necessary unless and until the Persians make another move, when a categorical note in the terms of that of February 19th, 1906, will have to be sent in» In the contrary event it will, I think, t e beet for you merely to give them to understand that, having reconsidered the matter, you have come to the conclusion that His Majesty^ Government W ould not consider such a solution at the present tinle * I desire to avoid shewing the Persian Government that your views on this subject * n+ ia therefore undesirable to shared by me and it is ^nere sendsend in a nets similar to that of 1906 it you have, in fact, undertaken to refer the suggestion home.[This Document is the Property of H is Britannic Majesty's Government. 1 PERSIA.

SIst October 1923. Sir, In your telegram 110.341 of the 24th instant you asked to be informed of the nature of the objections to your suggestion that the Persian Government's claim to :ahrein should be referred to arbitration. 2. The main reasons for my objection to this procedure lie in the more recent history of Bahrein, which is fully treated in Lorimer's 'Gazetteer of the Persian' Gulf', volume I, port I ahaJterS. The Bahrein islands, which had previously from time to time been under Persian domination, were formally annexed ■o rex bia in 1753, hut in 1783 the Persians were expelled by an arah horde led by the Sheikhs of Utub. Since that date, in spite of periodical attempts by Persia to reassert her authority over the islands, Bahrein lias oeen ruled by an oxab sheikh. The inhabitants have no racial affinity with the Persians and have never expressed any desire to be ruled by them. Moreover, the Sneikn o.- Balire in considers himself to be under British protection, and His Majesty 's Government have eleven times m course of the last century repudiated tne Persian Government 's claim to sovereignty over ahrem. I-^is Majesty's Government were now, on uie propoohL o_ one n ^v-1 nvi*i- fn poree to refer the soversit-nty Persian G-overnment, , . , i • _ •m-i /avo ^ Q-n 'ho no doubt tliax t- i 'j-r\ Q-rlntrstion. oneie ocui uo j..iu over Banrem uO auiuu., the Sheikh of Bahrein would consider himself tu have been deceived by His Majesty's Government, on whom he hac count-ec- zor mm, Bart, C.M.G., &amp;c. &amp;c. •orotection from attack of his neighbours^lis woula oe aiole i&gt;o oite in support of his expectation of British help the events of 1871-72, when the decided attitude of tne British Cfoveminent and the constant presence of British ships in Bahrein prevented an attempt by Turkey to encroach on the independence of the State; he could also point to the similar action by His Uaiesty 1 s G-oveminent in 1386 and 169C. 5. Fu.rtherrnore, if we v. ere now to agree to ar bitration, the belief in British pod-faith not only to the Sheikh of Bahrein but also to the rulers of the other Arab States on the Persian Gulf littoral, who have ex clusive agreement with His Llajesty's G-overnment, would be very seriously shaken and a general belief mignt be encouraged that Great Britain was now so weak in the Middle East that she allowed her predominant position in the Persian Q-ulf to be challenged by a cni^'o.-i -te powGx like Persia. 4. Again the acdeptance of arbitration about Bahrein would form a dangerous precedent, which mipt lead to a similar challenge by the Sultan of Mejd re- .■•axding Great Britain's sped el position in novu,. Ox, indeed, by other powers in other parts of the world, 'he Persian Government might quite logically on 'one seme grounds, ask for arbitration regarding aosul because that town formed part of the Persian Empire under Shah Abbas. 5. Apart from the above considerations 'oaere exists always the somewhat remote danger that we r.ugho be unable to prove to the satisfaction of the arbitrators whoever they might be. that Great Britain has a right to exercise over the islands that sovereignty, which she at present actually enjoys op -&gt; y,u.o.. 6. Should the Persian Government at. any oime officially suggest the reference of this question to arbitration, you should not. however, enter into any argumentIP , a.igi^,;8no v/iun uxiern on 'one subject, but should reply with a clank reiusal to this preposterous suggestion, and add that His Laic sty's G-overment have never admitted the ^ownership or soverei-nty of Persia over Bahrein, that sue a a. claim is, in uiieir view, entirely/' inadmissible, aii.o. t.aat Hi ; Lagesty f s Cfovemment consider the island of Bahrein and its inhabitants to be under British protec tion, and. must decline to entertain any further represen tations on the subject.

In August 1923, Shaikh Khalifah, with some four or five companions, proceeded to Baghdad to interview King Faisal and the High Commissioner on hehalf of Shaikh Isa. He succeeded in obtaining an audience with the King hut it does not appear that his representations received any attention. He did not succeed in his attempt to inter- -view Sir Henry Dobbs. 4. Early in March 1925. Shaikh Khalifah. with a few companions. left Bahrain and arrived at Dilwar on the Persian Coast near Bushire and proceeded to Tehran. It was then believed that his object was to interest the Persian Government on behalf of Shaikh Isa,and it is now known that he possesses documents signed by the lesser members Sir P. L. Loraine, Bart., H.B.M's. Envoy Estraordinary and Minister Pl.nipote ^tiary^the^I . I V a 3) memlsers of the A1 Khali fall family appointing him as their Agent. 5. It is unlikely that Shaikh Khali fall will command any respect from the Persian Government whether he advocates the cause of Shaikh Isa or the Persian claim to Bahrain as he is of dissolute habits and much addicted to drink. It is however possible he may bring himself to notice in Tehran and for this reason it has been considered advisable to furnish the above details of his character and career. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department and to the Political Agent, Bahrain.

Sir, Z have the honour to report that on the night of the 27th/28th August 1925 Sheikh Hamad bin Mohamed A1 Khalifah forcibly coiomandeered a jollyboat belonging to •--ome Shi ah villagers of JASARAH on the Forth-we stern coast of the main island, and left Bahrein territory with 4 followers for an unknown destination. This clandestine departure was made without Sheikh Hamad's permission and attended by the following circumstances:* About a fortnight before Sheikh Hamad's return from Europe, a Shiah tenant of a date garden situated near the residence of Sheikh Hamad bin Mohamed at JASARAH brought three donkeys to the police station in Manama, which he alleged were the property of Sheikh Hamad bin Mohamed and had been discovered by him ( the ft tenant ) in his garden damaging the trees. The matter was reported to the Bahrein Court, which sent a suramons to Sheikh Hamad bin Mohomed, requesting him either to appear in Court himseli or to appoint a Vakil for the case. The fidawi returned with a report that Sheikh Hamad had refused to sign the summons•umxnons, end had declared in a rage that he would never attend the Bahrein Ceurt himself , er appoint a valcil. The caee wa« ©f couree proceeded with in the absence of the defendant, the damage aseessed and two of the donkeys sold to pay it and their own upkeep in the police station - The third donkey was sent hack to Sheikh Hamad tin Mohamed, but as he refused to take it, it was finally sold and the proceeds credited to Government• A letter was at the seme time sent to Sheikh Hamad bin Mohamed by Sheikh Mohamed bin Rashid { Judicial represent- -ative during Sheikh Hamad* s absence in Europe ) s^tating that the Court was unable to overlook his action in this case 9 but that the matter was being postponed until Sheikh Hamad 1 s ^ return. Owing to Sheikh Hamad 1 s constant occupation in other and more pressing affairs, the matter was not taken up serious** -ly until about a week ago# Sheikh Hamad told me ( as I had known before ) that in this affair Sheikh Hamad bin Mohamed had merely acted upto his character and reputation for truculence, rudeness and insubordination which were too well known to Politj A Agents in the past to need further description. It was decided that Sheikh Hamad should send a letter to Sheikh Hamad bin Mohamed requesting him to appear in Court personally on the 29th August to explain his conduct, that the letter should be despatched on the 28th August and that on the day previous Sheikh Abdullah and Sheikh Salman should visit him # prepare him for what was coming, and explain that he was required to do nothing more than all other members of the A1 Khalifah had been doing for the last two years viz* to attend the Bahrein Court when called upon to do so- The only result of the visit was an intemperately worded letter to Sheikh Hamad on the 27th August followed by the departure described above on the same night, before Sheikh Hamad*s letter summoningBummoning him to the Court was despatched •» Sheilsh Hamad is conTinced that Sheilth Hamad bin Mohomed is suffering from a touch of insanity - Tke circum- ••stances of the present case certainly seera to confirm this diognosis •• Sheikh Hamad bin Mohomed has left his house with numerous women, children, serrants and animals all unprorided for« Regarding this behaviour as an act of wilful disloyalty and disobedience t Sheikh Hamad has decided that property of Sheikh Hamad bin Mohomed shall lie confiscated to the Bahrein Government® His eldest son Khalifah bin Hamad, new in Tehran, a^ppears to have inherited some of his fathers insanity - His grandson however Mohomed bin Khalifah bin Hamad is a young boy of quite a different stamp - He has written a letter to Sheikh Hamad disclaiming all sympathy with his father and grandfather and expressing loyalty to Sheikh Hamad* The latter proposes to leave him in charge of his grandfather* s house and to give him a small allowance out of State funds* In the meanwhile it is possible that Sheikh Hamad bin Mohomed may make his way to Persia to join his son at Tehran# Sheikh Hamad does not want either of them back again in Bahrein except on terms of absolute submission# He would feel very displeased if Sheikh Hamad bin Mohomed went to Bin Saud but this is hardly likely, as the latter would be almost sure to have nothing to do with him# I have the honour to be, sir &gt; Your most obedient servant.

To understand fully the motives which prompted him to take such a decisive and ill- advised step it is necessary to look back 55 - ears in the history of Bahrain! In the years 1868 and 1869 the follow- -ins events occurred (videpages 895-899 Vol.1 Historical Parti, Gazetteer Persian Gulf):- Sheikh Mohammed, the present Sheikh Hamad's father, after a rule of 25 years in Bahrain, fled, at tlie approach of a British fleet,to ^atar, and his brother Sheikh nli (father of Sheikh Isa) was declared Sheikh or hahram cj U e British authorities in his stead. After loss t a.i rule. Sheikh Ali was himself defeated and killed b; his brother Sheikh tohamad in an engagement on Bahrain island. A second British fleet then visited the island, captured Sheikh Hohammed and installed Sheikh Isa, son ol wheikh as Sheikh of Bahrain, which he has remained ever since. Sheikh Hamad bin tohwmnad is the eldest son of his father, and of a wild and headstrong temperament, he has never submitted to Sheikh Isa's rule, more tnan once o.eniy declaring; id™®*** the latter a usurper ana himself the Tr_ 'i' ^c yh ^t ti !i?al 1 v treated oheikh •11 ■ R q &gt;1 T , S 3 1 n He lictS ^leioux rightful Sheikli of Bahrain. . . r,11 n t itv with still more » s assumption oi autnorn^ Hamad bin Isa s rsist -ently refused to recognize that the disdain, and has per e Hon'ble Lieut.

I trust that it will he clear from the above that the refusal uf Sheikh Hamad hin Mohammad to si^n a summons from the Court in the present case was not the result ol any fit of anger at the seizure of' his animals, but merely a further example of the refractory and contumacious attitude he has persistently adopted in the past. It was impossible therefore for SheiJdi hamad bin I S a to disregard it. Not wishing however to precipitate matters too much by the despatch without previous warning of a letter calling upon him to attend the Court, Sheikh Hamad hin Isa arranged for his brother SheiJch Abdullah and his son Sheikh Salman to visit the old man and endeav- -our to prepare him for what was coming. i Although the unfortunate result was to a large • 4., r t a ttonf 1 v suspect oiieikh extent due to his own perversity, stro ^ . • t i fripiiteniriF him and suggesting to Abdullah of deliberate^ fn&amp;uteni g him that he should leave Baiirain and join mullah had been very friendly and helpful since ■hnt this incident, I thiruc, shews his return from Europe, out tui- - « o-nr^ oo unreliable as ever, that he is as unstable and as unre The departure of Sheikh Hamad bin i-oha^mnad is no ■ t tl ink to revive any old dissensions among the 1 ii-'elv .
