The interest accruing from these secu rities (approximately Fs.763/- per annum) is distributed by the Resident on behalf of the Administrator General. According to the decision of the High Court the income is to be transmitted annually to the Political Resident M to be applied by him in charity according to Mohammedan usage as he may think proper with liberty to the said Political Resident to pay over the said income or any part thereof to such person or persons as he may think proper for the purpose of being applied as aforesaid'. In the past the income from the Fund has been expended for various charitable purposes such as: (1) Upkeep of the testator’s mosque, caravanserai and water tanks at Bassidu, prior to its abandonment. (2) Doles to the caretakers of the testator’s mosque at Lingah. (3) Doles to the testator’s slaves. (4) Payments for 'Rouzakhani' during Muharram. A great part of the population of the area where the late Haji Khudadad lived has now migrated to the Trucial Coast and Bahrain, and part of the Fund is therefore to be transferred to those places, for expenditure on medical facilities or other charitable institutions which may be appropriate.

The funds were to be spent on Shia charities, but as no Shia charities existed in Bahrain, the annual allocation there of 350 Indian rupees was handed over to Dr Ralph Holmes of the Victoria Memorial Hospital in Manama, where it was to be used to assist poor Shias.The file includes:lists of individuals in Bahrain to whom money was paid (indicated in Indian rupees) from the Haji Khudadad fund;statements of expenditure incurred by the Political Agency in Bahrain from the Haji Khudadad fund;annual letters from Haji bin Ruqiayeh [also spelt Rokeya, Roqiyeh, Ruqieh, Rogya] requesting his inheritance from the estate of Haji Khudadad, followed by annual instructions from the British Residency to issue payment to Haji bin Ruqiayeh of 20 Indian rupees;correspondence concerning the expenditure in Dubai of money from the Haji Khudadad fund on beds for the Dubai hospital.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Victoria Memorial Hospital, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Al Maktoum Hospital, Dubai</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Haji Khudadad bin Mohammed</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Charities</topic></subject><subject><topic>Hospitals</topic></subject><subject><topic>Shīʻah</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00012d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
