I suggest that a branch office of this Agency should be opened at I ina al Ahmedi to deal with shipping as Abadan Reach deals with shipping for Khorram shahr. T ina al Ahr- edl is 35 miles fror Kuwait as com pared with Abadan’s 10 miles. 3. I propose that Taylor and one clerk from Agency should open office and that new grade B 4 or B 5 \ officer should be appointed to Kuweit to replace both Taylor and the Head Clerk here who recently died. 4. In addition to shipping Taylor would handle registrations -under Grdef in Council, visas, estates, % pensions and general day to day enquiries of oil company employees. He would continue to refer all important decisions to re and not have separate status but sign ' f 0 r Political Agent Kuwait ”. I propose that the establishment be styled ” Office of H.V.

The company is embarking on a housing programme to be completed within twelve months and Taylor would get improved Quarters as they become available.

The proposed office accommodation is so compact and convenient that so far as can be foreseen at present a ^arrash would not be necessary. Company would urovide cleaning.

I should be grateful if you would telegraph average number of ships calling monthly at Abadan and proportion of British ships. Jalcins.No. C/2P4U/47) Political Af*ncy, Kuweit. December ] 0 , 194°. Dear Sir Hu ert, Your teleprara No. 304 of December .7. 2. Services r^nder^d to British shipoirr are laid do^n in a buff book entitled 'Instructions to Consul?, Merchant Shippinp and Seaman, of vbich a cony is in the Bahrein Apency. When a ship comes into port her master deposits the ship's articles which are endorsed and a fee charged. Fnpapementp and discharges of seaman are recorded in the articles aeainst naynrnt of a f&lt;*e. Th» local rate of exchange for advances to seamen is also entered in the articles• Stowaways, deserters, sick seamen end seamen otherwise left behind, alive or dead, are also dealt with as are disputes on board between th* master and m^mb^rs of the crew. When required an enquiry can be conducted on board and in serious cases what is misnamed a 'Naval' Court summoned. 3. On the basis of services to British shippinp a * n* X consider that there is a stronp case for ooeninp an off ce in Ahmedi particularly as it is over 30 mile? -r r om Kuweit as compared with Abadan Reach's 10. But as I mentioned in in my t*l^rram No. 273 of November 30 I consider that we should place our services at the disposal of foreign shinning because if we do rot do so amroachei will undoubtedly be made for the aooointment of foreign, representatives as has already happened with the United States. 4* Further as I oointed out in my note No. c/^79 ('Vl^) of December 1, of which I have row sent a copy to the Department, an office at Mina a? Ahmadi should h*»!p us in regularizing the situation with the Kuwait Oil Company. There has b*en some mention of waiting for a 'definite issue' to regularize relations between the Sheikh, th- Oil Company and ourselves but I myself wonder whether a policy of reaceful penetration would not be more rewarding than one of a him show down. Many past shortcomings have arisen from the fact that this Agency was not in a position to play its proper role and I myself feel that if we can show to the Company that we are both in a position and determined to discharge fully all our responsibilities then a chanp* of practice , if not of heart, should be made easier for them. 5. One of the ways by which we can give the Company a clear indication of our intentions is by opening an office at ' ina al Ahmadi. I did not ask Jordan for his views on this proposal but from the alacrity with which he showed me suitable accommodation and telephoned, unasked, the next day to confirm It, it is clear that a branch office of the Agency would be most welcome there. The present 30-mile trek to Kuweit suits nobody and is in fact a grave inconvenience for the company's staff. 6. In addition to the effect on the Kuwait Oil Company His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, K^C.I.F., C.S.I., Political Resident, Bahrein.j&amp;r. Corrpany the effect or the comnany ooeratinp in the Neutral /one should be salutary. MacPh-rson, much more than Jordan* 3s used to dealinp with local authorities direct, nls past experience with the Saudi$ has not accustomed him to regarding British political officers as the channel of approach to local authorities and as a former British rurject he is no doubt bound, to some extent, to show himself as more American than the Americans as an direct business methods. An office at Mina al Ahmadi should serve as a reminder to ftacPhereon and should be an Invaluable observation post on activities in the TJeutral Zone. I am sending a cony of this note to the Department.

I trust however that consideration of proposal will not be deferred. I learn privately that one of the reasons the company has in the past failed to use the services of the Agency was the very slow pace at which the Agency worx-ced. This was excus able then but now that we have the staff I consider we should show the company that we are more than able to Keep up with them. 3. 70 shies berthed at Mina al Ahmadi last month and so far 22 have berthed this month. In addition neutral zone Americans are going into Ahmedi for relaxation. They provide an admirable source of infomoation on the Neutral Zone that by $ being so far away in Kuwait I am unable to tap. 4.
