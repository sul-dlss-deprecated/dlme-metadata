The Iraqi Government took no steps whatever to prevent the tea entering into Iraq. The consequence was that dhows instead of landing tea at Kuwait merely landed it at Basra.

The allegation of arms smuggling is one which, it is submitted, we cannot dismiss lightly. The recent papers on the subject are attached. The Political Resident consistently decries the reports that arms are being smuggled in substantial quantities from Koweit into Iraq, and it is impossible to reconcile his reports with the assertions of Taufiq Suwaidi and Major Edmonds that Kov/eit is an open market v/here arms are bought and sold freely and cheaply. Undoubtedly the Iraqis must be called on to give chapter and verse for their allegations, but if it is at all true that dealings in arms proceed uncontrolled in Kov/eit there is a clear case for making a gesture by having some system of regulation introduced. The obligation undertaken by the Sheikh’s predecessor in 1900 (Aitchison Vol.XI p. 262) to prohibit absolutely the import and export of arms is presumably still binding, even though nothing may be done on our side to see that it isThe question of simiggling generally from Koweit into Iraq is one of considerable difficulty which has defied all attempts hitherto made to solve it. The position is that Koweit - pending the production of oil -f produces 'nothing but grass' and is dependent absolutely on its entrepot trade with the interior. Saudi Arabia has been closed to it since about 1924, though some progress has been made towards the negotiation of agreements by His Majesty's Government with Saudi Arabia on behalf of Koweit v/hich will remove the blockade. Onl[y Iraq is left. The landing and transport charges for goods passing to Iraq through Koweit are such that there jis really no opening for legitimate trade with Iraq. But illicit trade pays, owing to the great difference between the Iraq and Koweit tariffs. There is no legal obligation on Koweit to stop the smuggling. The responsibility for that rests entirely on Iraq which alleges it cannot control smuggling v/ithout Koweit's cooperation. The Iraqis complain of the great expense they would have to incur in order effectively to control their desert frontier, but the real reason for their failure to control it effectively seems to be twofold - (a) fear of arousing the hostility of the tribesmen of the lov/er Euphrates, v/ho are the chief participants in the actual smuggling, and (b) a reluctance to deal firmly v/ith the organisations in Iraq (traders and possibly some officials) which benefit from the smuggling. Unwilling to incur the odium and expense of effective measures of control, the Iraqis for years past have tried to get the Sheikh to co-operate, i.e. to share the odium if not the expense. In 1932 and 1934 they suggested proposals, resembling those recently put forward in London/ cf. P.Z.988/38. C P. Z.4986/34_7 / P.Z. 2615/37/ /-A 7^ Minute Paper. Department. W /”for 's viev/s on customs union__ of. P.Z.1041/35 J London, for a form of customs union or alternatively for raising the Kov/eit tariff to the Iraq level, combined with suggestions for limiting the quantity of imports into Koweit. Both the Sheikh, and also His Majesty’s Government, made it known that such proposals v/ere inacceptable, on political and economic grounds. In 1935 a determined effort v/as made by His Majesty’s Government to mediate a settlement, and in June they gave advice, indeed 'strong advice', to the Sheikh to accept a British Customs Director (who would be given v/ide powers in the regulation of imports) and to co-operate with the Iraqis in running a preventive service. He was warned that if he refused co-operation the Iraqis were determined to enforce a rigorous blockade which would kill all his trade with Iraq. The Sheikh refused to accept the advice; he said he could not endanger his position by approving any measures which would weaken the economic position of his subjects; he was hov/ever quite prepared to face anything the Iraqis would do, knowing that his people would then blame Iraq and not him for their misfortunes. The Sheikh came to London shortly afterwards and attended a meeting in the India Office with India Office and Foreign Office representatives to discuss the question. The utmost that could be extracted from him was a declaration of his willingness to extend the manifest system v/hich he had been prepared to adopt for exports by sea to exports leaving Koweit by land. In October 1935 the Iraq Government/ 4.38 7173 Wt 8900/111 10,000Government declared that the Sheikh^ offer was inadequate, and decided to introduce improved preventiv^ measures, though not a complete blockade, A tentative move was made by the Iraq Government in November 1936 for a settlement of outstanding questions v/ith Kov/eit, but the Sheikh went no further than to declare his willingness, once a Saudi-Koweit trade agreement v/as in operation, to discuss an anti smuggling agreement with Iraq, In November 1937 a discussion 7/as held at the Foreign Office at v/hich the Ambassador at Bagdad and the Political Resident v/ere present, and the eventual result of which was that in January last the Sheikh v/as warned by us that the Iraqis had most extensive measures (armed cars, aeroplanes &amp;c.) under contemplation for a rigorous control of the frontier, and that as the result would seriously affect Koweit trade it would be in his own best interests to come to an agreement with Iraq in the matter of smuggling. The Sheikh v/as apparently unmoved - and majr have suspected a bluff, for we have heard nothing further of the intensification of the Iraqi frontier preventive operations. There matters rest, and we are told (P.Z.6763/38) that the recently formed Council in Kov/eit 'most of whom are general merchants' (and so thrive on selling goods to the smugglers) have the same reactions as the Sheikh. The position is not a very satisfactory one for His Majesty’s Government, v/hose protege is certainly not behaving as a good neighbour. But our pov/er of intervention is limited - and v/e failed to get our advice accepted by the Sheikh in 1935.

( jLrO Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of The Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Dept. State to forward for the consideration of the Government of india, a copy of a letter from the Foreign Office relative to certain conversations recently held with the Foreign Office by the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of Koweit, with particular reference to the prejudice to the security Copy to P./. (with copy of V a P.Z.7094/38) BusMre of Iraq and the loss to Iraqi revenues stated to be caused by smuggling of arms and of dutiable goods generally from Koweit into Iraq. 2. On the subject of the alleged smuggling of arms from or through Koweit^_ into Iraq the views of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf have recently been -expressed in the corres pondence resting with his demi-official (P.Z.7094/38) letter of the 7th October, No. C/744. It is clear from this correspondence that the smuggled arms do not enter Koweit by sea but come (if they enter Koweit at all) from Saudi Arabia. The information available to the R.A.F. in (P.Z.5537/38) Iraq does not suggest that the arms are dealt with by Koweiti middlemen, while (P.Z.5537 and 7094/38) the Political Resident finds it difficult to understand why arms traffickers on the way from Saudi Arabia to Iraq should enter Koweit territory at all. Even ifit is the case that the alleged illicit arms traffic is carried on hy isolated parties passing through the desert parts of Koweit on their way from Saudi Arabia to Iraq it seems unreasonable to expect the Sheikh, with the means at his disposal, to control traffic across the Saudi-Koweit frontier when the Iraqis, with their greatly superior resources and the frontier customs police organisation which they now maintain, are apparently unable to check the illicit traffic in arms across their own frontier. •3. It will however be seen from the enclosures to the Foreign Office letter that the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs and the British Adviser in the Ministry of the Interior are convinced (though definite evidence was not adduced by them) that the smuggling of arms across the Koweit-Iraq frontier has assumed serious proportions, and assert that it is facilitated by the fact that Koweit has become a recognised market for the sale of arms where they can be bought freely and cheaply. The Secretary of State feels that it is impossible to dismiss lightly this very definite conclusion formed by the Iraqi authorities, contrary though it is to the views expressed by the Political Resident in his letter of the 7th October, referred to above, and should there be any/Draft Paper, 7090 Wt 41703/86 10,000 3.38 7090 Wt 41703/86 10,000 3.38 Department any foundation in fact for their description of the situation in Koweit, he would share the disquiet with which j it is viewed hy the Foreign Office. Even though it may he admitted that the responsibility for the control of their own frontier rests with the Iraqi Government, it is clear that His Majesty’s Government could not expose themselves to the reproach 1hat they are tolerating the existence, in a State under their protection, of a traffic in arms which directly or indirectly contributes a menace to the security of a neighbouring State. I am therefore to request that the Political Resident may be asked to make further investigation into the matter in the light of the Iraqi Minister’s contentions, so far as may be possible ! pending the production of any detailed evidence which the Iraq authorities may be able to supply. Even if further examination tends to confirm the ! statement made by the Political Resident |in his express letter of the 21st July No. 427.S. to the A.O.C. Iraq that ‘‘^nobody in Koweit from the Sheikh downwards, obtain any profit from this traffic, or is in any way engaged in it,** the Secretary of State feels that it is desirable, if only to provide an effective answer to the/the Iraqi allegations, that we should satisfy ourselves that the control of the sale of arms in Koweit is adequate, and it will he observed that the Foreign Office have promised that further consideration should he given to the suggestion made hy Major Edmonds to this effect. The Secretary of State will therefore he glad if the Government of India will consider, in consultation with the Political Resident, whether some stricter form of control is necessary and if so wild; measures can he devised for the purpose. In seeking the consent of the Sheikh to action of this nature it would he relevant to remind him of the proclamation issued hy his predecessor in 1900 in pursuance of his undertaking to prohibit absolutely the importation of arms into Koweit or the exportation of arms therefrom (vide Aitchison XI pp.262 f.) 4. The representations of His Excellency Taufiq Suwaidi on the general question of smuggling from Koweit into Iraq are discussed in paras. 3 and 4 of the Foreign Office letter. The complaints of the Iraqi Government against the Sheikh on this account are of long standing, and ware made in the past, and particularly in 1934 and 1935, -mediate a cottlomeft^ does not^encourage the Secrotory-of St f W •—fro hope thfrt any solution aa&amp;Hre found until/Draft Paper.

But the situation in which a State under the protection of His Majesty f s Government profits from smuggling goods into the territory of an ally of His Majesty 1 s Government is patently unsatisfactory, and as the negotiations for the removal of the Saudi blockade are bound to take some further time the Sec etary of State would be glad if the Government of India in consultation with the Politic;!

Sir, Foreign Office. S.W.l. 19th October, 1938. I am directed by Viscount Halifax to transmit to you herewith for the consideration of the Marquess of Zetland a copy of a memorandum which the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs communicated to the United Kingdom Delegation at Geneva before his recent visit to London to serve as a basis for his discussions here with His Majesty’s Government. It will be observed that in Section 3 of this memorandum Taufiq Suwaidi raised the question of the legal status of the Sheikhdom of Koweit and made certain alternative suggestions for the solution of the problem of the smuggling and illegal arms traffic which is alleged to take place from Koweit into Iraq; these were: (a) A customs union between Iraq and Koweit: (b) The cession to Iraq of the northern part of Koweit in order to facilitate police operations, and (c) Combined preventive operations. It will be seen from the enclosed copies of the records of the three conversations which Taufiq Suwaidi had in this department that His Excellency indicated that he did not wish to insist on discussing the question of the international status of Koweit, but that he strongly urged that a further effort should be made to remove what the Iraqi Government considered as their legitimate grievances in the matter of smuggling and arms traffic from the Sheikhdom. 2./2* It will further he seen that Taufig. Suwaidi, while ready to accept the statement of the British authorities in the Persian Gulf that no arms are imported into Koweit hy sea, maintained that there was at present nothing to prevent the purchase of arms in Koweit and said that it was common knowledge that arms traffic from Koweit into Ira^ takes place on a large scale# The Iraqi Government may possibly in due course produce the evidence of this for which Taufiq Suwaidi was asked, hut it appears to Lord Halifax that in view of the positive statements on the subject made not only hy Taufiq Suwaidi hut also hy Major Edmonds, the adviser in the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior, who accompanied His Excellency on the second of his visits to the Foreign Office, there is every likelihood that Koweit is in fact used as a centre at which arms can conveniently he bought. This is a position which causes Lord Halifax some disquiet, having regard to the serious view which His Majesty’s Government have in the past always taken of their responsibility for checking the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf and to the harmful effect on security in Iraq which illegal importation of arms into that country must he expected to have. His Lordship trusts, therefore, that early and sympathetic consideration may he given to the suggestion, made hy Major Edmonds, that the sale of arms in Koweit should, he subjected to some strict form of Government control. 3. as far as other forms of smuggling are concerned, it will he seen that it was not possible to give Taufiq Guwaidi any promise oi satisfaction along the lines which he had suggested in his memorandum, and that Major Edmonds/Edmonds then made a further suggestion to the effect that, since the main cause of smuggling into Iraq is the low level of the Koweiti tariff, the difficulty might 'be overcome if the Koweiti customs tariff were increased to the level of the Iraqi tariffs I am to add that in a subsequent conversation Major Edmonds expressed the opinion that if it proved impracticable to raise the tariff level of all goods imported into Koweit, it might remove at least the main causes of friction if an increase of tariff were made on the products, such as tea, sugar, etc*, which are at present smuggled in the greatest quantities* 4* Lord Halifax is of course aware that it is for the Iraqi Government in the first place to ensure that smuggling into their territory does not take place, and he has not failed to impress this fact on them, both through His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad and now in London* Nevertheless, it is impossible to deny that the consistent refusal of the Sheikh to take, or even to discuss, any practical measures to cooperate with the Iraqi Government in this matter is not consistent with the relations which normally exist between neighbouring sountries# Nor can it be denied that His Majesty’s Government must ascept some degree of responsibility in the matter since, but for their protection of the Sheikh, the Iraqi Government would no doubt find the means of inducing him to adopt a more accommodating and friendly attitude. In view, indeed, of the special relationship of His Majesty’s Government to Koweit, and of their alliance with Iraq, His Lordship regards the existing position as particularly unfortunate, since it inevitably raises doubts/doubts in Irag as to the extent to which it is possible to rely on the friendship of His Majesty’s Government, end their willingness to provide their ally with reasonable assistance in the protection of Iraqi interests. I am therefore to express the hope that careful consideration may be given to the possibility of taking some action on the lines suggested by Major Edmonds. If no such action proves practicable, Lord Halifax will be grateful for any alternative suggestions that Lord Zetland may be able to ma^e with a view to checking smuggling from Koweit, and thus removing what the Iraqi Government undoubtedly consider to be a legitimate grievance.

His ixcellency then explained in some detail his anxiety at the dangerous policy which he felt that the French Government were pursuing in this matter. He hoped that the French Government could be persuaded to proceed at an early date with the ratification of the Franco-Syrian Treaty, and that they would not insist on setting up a Siecial regime in the Upper Jezirea which would have no -ernanenee and would be a danger to Iraq. 7. ^s regards Alexandretta, Hia Fxcellenc* hoped that His Majesty’s Government would be able to support, at some suitable moment in the future, a proposal for a new settlement/settlement, on the toaeis oi‘ the pfortltion of the Sanjak between lur*cey end byrta.

Copy No. [Amended Copy.] Record of Conversation with the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs held at the Foreign Office at 6 p.m. on October 4, 1938. Present: Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs. Major Edmonds (British adviser to the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior). Mr. Baxter, Foreign Office. Mr. Crosthwaite, Foreign Office. Mr. Baxter enquired whether the Iraqi Foreign Minister wished to begin by discussing in detail the matters which formed the subject of the aide-memoire handed by his Excellency to Mr. Butler at Geneva, or whether there were any other matters arising out of that morning’s conversation with the Secretary of State which his Excellency wished to discuss. The Iraqi Foreign Minister said that he would like to discuss in detail the subjects dealt with in his aide-memoire. Aerodrome Guards. As regards the question of aerodrome guards, Taufiq Suwaidi referred to the delay which had taken place in giving effect to article 4 of the annexure to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance. It was true that various proposals had been made since the entry into force of that treaty in 1932, but some of these proposals were not in accordance with the provisions or the intention of the treaty. Discus sions had taken place at Bagdad in 1935, and a certain measure of agreement had been reached, but there were still two outstanding points on which the views of His Majesty’s Government had never been received. It was with a view to providing a solution of the whole problem that he had now suggested that the aerodrome guards should be detached either from the regular Iraqi army (in which case the commanding officer would be a British officer attached to the British military mission) or from the Iraqi police. In either case, the Iraqi military or police forces would be placed under the control of the British Air Officer Commanding, and in addition, if the forces were to be provided by the Iraqi army, there would be a British commanding officer. He thought that a solution on these lines would be entirely in accordance with the treaty. Mr. Baxter drew attention to the provisions of the treaty article, stating that the special guards should be provided ‘ £ upon such conditions as may be agreed upon between the high contracting parties,” and that the Iraqi Government would ‘ ‘ secure the enactment of such legislation as might be necessary for the fulfilment of the conditions referred to above.” Various efforts had been made to reach agreement as to the nature of this legislation to be introduced by the Iraqi Government. The last proposals, it would be recalled, had been handed to the Iraqi Government by Sir M. Peterson in May last. It did not appear that the Iraqi Government had yet replied to that communication, and it was there fore only now that His Majesty’s Government learnt that these proposals were unacceptable to the Iraqi Government. As regards the proposals now put forward by Taufiq Suwaidi, it was regretted that neither was entirely welcome to the British authorities concerned. The main difficulty was, to speak perfectly frankly, the problem of the control of these aerodrome guards. His Excellency had stated that they would be under the control of the Air Officer Commanding, but in certain respects these guards, being part of the Iraqi military or police forces, would also be under the direct control of the Iraqi Government. It seemed to the British authorities concerned that this divided control might lead to difficulties and disputes between the British2 r and Iraqi authorities, wtiicn it would be in the best interests of both the British and Iraqi Governments if possible to avoid. His Majesty's Government, however, realised the difficulties in the way of reaching an agreed settlement on the lines hitherto followed, and had therefore been giving active consideration to an entirely difterent solution of the problem which, if it proved practicable, would no doubt be welcome to the Iraqi Govern- ment; that was that His Majesty’s Government should wmive their right to ask the Iraqi Government to provide special guards, and that the Royal Air Force should themselves provide for their own ground defence without maintaining the present levies or any other force composed of Iraqi subjects. Before dehnite proposals to this effect could be made, however, various practical difficulties would have to be examined. During a recent tour of the Middle East undertaken by the Under-Secretary of State for Air, a senior officer of the Air Ministry accompanied him to discuss this problem with the authorities in Iraq, but unfortunately, owing to the international crisis, they had to be recalled when they had got as far as Palestine. But the British authorities would continue to consider the question as rapidly as possible. Taufiq Suwaidi said that this was an entirely new suggestion, and he could not say how the Iraqi Government would regard it. Fie would at once telegraph to Bagdad and might possibly receive some indication of the Iraqi Government’s views in the course of a day or two. Registration of Land Occupied by the Port of Basra. The Foreign Office representatives regretted that they were not yet in a position to discuss this problem, and that if it proved impossible to give his Excellency a reply before he left London a reply would, in any case, be sent to him at Bagdad at an early date. Taufiq Suwaidi said he was sure that, if the Iraqi Government repaid the outstanding instalment of the port loan, there could be no objection to registering the land in the name of the Iraqi Government. Fie hoped that it might even be possible for His Majesty’s Government to agree to his proposal without insisting upon the immediate repayment of the loan. Such a gesture on their part would be much appreciated in Iraq. Koweit. (The Secretary of State, in the course of his meeting with the Iraqi Foreign Minister in the morning of the 4th October, had told his Excellency that His Majesty’s Government would find it difficult to admit any Iraqi claim, if the Iraqi Government were ever to put forward such a claim, to sovereignty over Koweit ; and the Iraqi Foreign Minister had agreed not to insist on discussing this point, to which a reference had been made in the aide-memoire which he had communicated as a basis for discussion.) Mr. Baxter referred to the reference in Taufiq Suwaidi’s aide-memoire to Koweit as a centre for extensive arms traffic and smuggling. He would like to consider, in the first place, the statement that there was an important illegal traffic in arms into Iraq. Hitherto, he believed, His Majesty’s Government had not received any evidence to show that any such smuggling of arms was, in fact, taking place. In fact, the British authorities in the Persian Gulf seemed to be fairly sure that no arms were now entering Koweit, at all events by sea. He asked whether the Iraqi Government were able to produce any evidence to show that smuggling of arms did, in fact, take place through Koweit. Taufiq Suwaidi replied that the Iraqi Government were convinced that arms smuggling from Koweit into Iraq had, in fact, assumed serious proportions, and he thought that the Iraqi Government could produce evidence of this. He was, in any case, quite certain that arms were on sale in Koweit in large quantities and at very cheap prices, and that there was nothing to prevent anyone who liked from buying arms freely in the open market and trying to smuggle them across the Iraqi frontier. Major Edmonds added that, to his personal knowledge, as a result of his conversations with Iraqi tribesmen, it was quite a frequent occurrence for an Arab to buy a rifle in Koweit for £5 or £6 and to travel with it to Iraq, where[430 e— 2 ] b 2 3 « he would sell it for about twice that amount. The fact was that Koweit had become a recognised market where Arabs, whether would-be smugglers or not, went to purchase arms. He was quite prepared to believe that the British authorities in the Persian Gulf were right when they said that no arms entered Koweit by sea, but it was absolutely certain that somehow or other these arms were ^available for sale in Koweit. Mr. Baxter said that His Majesty’s Government would certainly be prepared to give the whole question their earnest attention if the Iraqi Government would, in fact, be good enough to produce all the evidence in their possession. At a later stage in the discussion, Major Edmonds suggested that His Majesty’s Government might be prepared to consider a solution whereby substan tial restrictions would be placed on the sale of arms in the Koweiti market. He thought that in Muscat, before the war, His Majesty’s Government had insisted that all the arms available for sale in that territory should be collected and stored in one special warehouse under Government supervision, and that the sale of these arms should be subjected to some form of Government control. He suggested that some such system in Koweit might be the most effective method of dealing with the situation which had arisen. Mr. Baxter said that this suggestion would receive further consideration. As regards other forms of smuggling, Mr. Baxter wished to point out in the first place that it was really entirely for the Government of a country to see that smuggling into its territory did not take place. The Iraqi Foreign Minister had put forward three suggestions. The first was for a customs union between Iraq and Koweit. This did not seem to His Majesty’s Government to be an acceptable solution, since such an arrangement between a large State like Iraq and a small State like Koweit might be expected to undermine the independence of the smaller State. Taufiq Suwaidi said that he did not think that there was much foundation for this fear. He said that for many years now the Iraqi authorities had run the Koweiti postal administration. This had not, he thought, made any difference to the political position of the sheikhdom, and he did not see why it should make any difference if the Iraqi authorities also took over the Koweiti customs administration. Koweit would, of course, be offered a fixed annual sum in lieu of its present customs revenue. He thought that the Koweitis themselves would be very ready to accept such a suggestion. Mr. Baxter said that the Iraqi Foreign Minister’s second suggestion, that the northern frontier line of Koweit should be fixed further south so as to give the Iraqi preventive services more space in which to operate, seemed also to be unacceptable. This suggestion would apparently involve the cession to Iraq of about one-third of Koweit, and it was difficult to see what compensation could be given to the sheikh elsewhere. Taufiq Suwaidi said that, if the suggestion of a customs union between Iraq and Koweit were found to be possible, it would not be necessary further to consider this alternative. Mr. Baxter proceeded that, as regards the Iraqi Foreign Minister’s third solution, he understood that the proposal of combined preventive operations had already been put forward some months ago. The Sheikh of Koweit had stated on that occasion that he was willing to negotiate with the Iraqi Government when he had reached an agreement with the Saudi Government regarding the raising of their blockade. These negotiations had been proceeding fairly satisfactorily of late. Taufiq Suwaidi interjected that he did not see what these negotiations between Koweit and Saudi Arabia had to do with Iraq. In reply to the question whether the Iraqi Government had any special measures in mind in connexion with the proposed anti-smuggling agreement with Koweit, Taufiq Suwaidi seemed to think that it might be possible to induce the sheikh, who had no armoured cars, &amp;c., to contribute to the proposed joint preventive operations, to share the cost of these operations. It was pointed out to him that the sheikh would not be likely to agree to any such proposal.4 Mr. Baxter informed Ins Excellency that His Majesty’s Government had in S„ r f e T, d f' eXpert rep ^ Tt ’ f r° m which 11 a PPeared that the Iraqi authorities might be able to give smuggling from Koweit a decisive blow if they were to take ad . dltl ° nal measures . e.y .,control by aeroplanes and armoured cars, o ether with drastic measures against those organisations or individuals in Iraq by hi™ l F:reedency StmS m smu &amp; glin g on such a large scale as had been suggested Taufiq Suwaidi thought that the Iraqi Government had already taken ill such measures as were in their power. There were numbers of armoured cars heT,^ r P ° ' Ce eng f? 8d m anti-smuggling measures, and all this was involving H' 8 ^;Xi d0 c e v' lmeI '! ln ■‘T, 1011 ? expenditure. The position apparently was that t . ■ ' 1 01 Koweit would take no action whatever, because, of course, he had othuig to gain from doing so; on the contrary, he was, if anything, making a urge profit for a large part of the customs levied on goods entering Koweit FrnmV'T ht sub ? ei I ue . nt l v be smuggled into Iraq) went into his own pocket, rom the Iraqi point of view it was an unbearable situation. , Major Edmonds suggested that the difficulty might be overcome if the Koweit i customs tariff were increased to the level of the Iraqi tariff. The main cause of the Sheflfb 1 of T 8 ‘ ^ 116 K0W , eit , i ‘ ar ; ff WaS so low - He tho *ight that possibly the bneikh of Koweit was precluded from raising it by his treaties with His ^he Sheikh of Ko nme t nt ' /fi,' 4 7®* 1 n P0Ssible to agree to a customs union between I L 7 n t d the Iraq ' 1 Gov8rame ut. co uld it not at least be arranged that the two Administrations, even though remaining entirely independent should impose the same tariff, i.e., the Iraqi tariff? ' ' ' ho J au fiS Suwnid i added that in that case the Iraqi Government would no doubt wish to assure themselves that the higher tariff was being applied in Koweit n if L .T 38 m , theo J7' and also that smuggling into Koweit was not taking place on a large scale. He thought that this difficulty might be overcome if an Iraqi customs official, perhaps one of the British officials attached to the Iraqi customs administration, could be attached to the Koweiti customs administration. Mr. Baxter undertook that this suggestion would be examined further. Iraqi Government’s Wish for a new Port on the Persian Gulf. I , t f r ' &lt;K r drew attention to the fear expressed by the Iraqi Foreign Minister if Ar h h re S ou d be serK ; us interference by Persia with navigation on the Shatt- Surelftbev di e H nqU ; red th ? natur u ° f u he Irar B Government’s fears on this point, peace-time^ d d eXP&lt;! S ° me h ° Stl 6 3Ct ° n the part of Persia - at a11 events in Taufiq Suwaidi replied with references to the violent tendencies of Persian po icy as directed by the present Shah. He referred to the difficulties that had already arisen with Persia regarding the Shatt-el-Arab, and to the use of that waterway by Persian warships. Mr. Baxter suggested that in time of peace it was improbable that Persian warships would commit hostile acts against Iraqi shipping using the waterway between Basra and the sea Such an act of aggression teemed very ui l.kely a least so long as the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance was maintained. In time of war a so the Persian Government seemed to be unlikely to adopt a violently hostile attitude towards the British and Iraqi Governments, since they would be^anxious to maintain the revenues resulting from their sales to us of Persian oil . On the other hand, His Majesty’s Government fully appreciated the desire ml he v,. I a aql Government to secure an additional commercial outlet on the sea. ey had no desire at all to stand in the way of such a project, and they had carefully gone into the Iraqi Government’s wishes. The information at the disposal of the British authorities concerned showed that Koweit itself was not suitable for development as a modern port, and such development would be very expensive; it would involve dredging on a large scale, and the construction of a long breakwater, m addition to the provision of ordinary harbour works. Any other place in Koweit Bay would be even less suitable, since at present ships could not anchor nearer than 3 miles from the shore, and when the south-east wind blew lighterage would be impossible. On the other hand, Khor Abdullah appeared from the charts (which would, however, require confirmation, since they were based on a5 ^odprnor^ a ^° t0 ver ^ we ^ to development as a w fr lp w? 1 ' J her ? seemed t0 be a de ep water approach of at least 21 feet the r^LY y K and f ^ Water anchora ge next the shore. Khor Abdullah thus ^ ( ° )e m J lc 1 the best site from the point of view of the Iraqi Government. -I s development would almost certainly be less expensive, and it would be nearer lie Iraqi railway system. Ihe Iraqi Government would, therefore, do well, in the ist place, to examine the possibility of meeting their requirements by the con struction of a port at Khor Abdullah. 1 aujiq Suivaidi that the Iraqi Government would certainly examine the possibilities of Khor Abdullah, but if they decided to develop a port on that inlet they might require certain concessions from the Sheikh of Koweit, and they would like to be assured in advance, before embarking upon any expenditure, &amp;c., that the Sheikh of Koweit would be prepared to agree to an alteration in the existing frontier, in so far as this might be necessary. Mr. Baxter suggested that first it would be necessary for the Iraqi Govern ment to decide exactly what they would have to ask from the Sheikh of Koweit. If they wished the sheikh to cede to them a part of his territory, e.g., the small island of Warbah and the navigable channel between that island and the open sea, they would have to make an offer to compensate him elsewhere. For this purpose it would be desirable that the Iraqi Government's offer should be made as attractive as possible to the sheikh; it would be well that the compensation offered should quite evidently exceed in value the territory which they were asking the sheikh to cede. Taufiq Suwaidi asked if he might get into direct touch with the Sheikh of Koweit on this question. Mr. Baxter replied that His Majesty’s Government would prefer that any official approach should be made through them. Taufiq Suwaidi urged, nevertheless, that he might be allowed in the first place to approach the Sheikh of Koweit, whom he knew personally, and discuss the matter privately with him. He was sure that this would be the best procedure for reaching agreement. He, as a fellow Arab, would know how best to put the matter to the sheikh, and induce him to accept some reasonable arrangement. But he would like to be able to tell the sheikh that this private approach was being made with the knowledge and approval of His Majesty’s Government. The official proposals would be made later, and through us if we wished. Mr. Baxter replied that he must maintain the view that any official approach should be made through His Majesty's Government, and added that further con sideration would be given to the proposal that a preliminary private discussion should take place between Taufiq Suwaidi and the sheikh, with the knowledge and approval of His Majesty’s Government. Foreign Office, October 5, 1938.[430 1—1] THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Iraq). CONFIDENTIAL. [E 5944/1982/93] Viscount Halifax to Sir M. Peterson [Bagdad). (No. 568.) . . Foreign Office, October 11, 1938. THE Iraqi Foreign Minister called on me again on the 10th October at the end of his official visit to this country. 2. His Excellency first mentioned the problem of smuggling from Koweit into Iraq. He had, since his previous conversation with me on the 4th October, discussed this difficulty with the competent Department in the Foreign Office, and he wished to press for the adoption of a solution, one of several that had been discussed, whereby the tariff in Koweit should be increased to the level of the Iraqi tariff. He reminded me that I had at our previous interview expressed the hope that, if legal issues concerning the status of Koweit could be set aside, it might be found possible to reach some agreement on other points affecting relations between Iraq and Koweit, including this question of smuggling. I assured his Excellencv in reply that his suggestion would be carefully examined. 3. Taufiq Suwaidi then referred to British policy in Palestine, and said that he had been a little disappointed with the result of his recent conversation with the Secretary of State for the Colonies. He appreciated that the Woodhead Commission had not yet completed their report, and that it was therefore impossible for His Majesty’s Government now to reach a final decision as regards their future policy. At the same time, he thought that His Majesty’s Government ought now to decide on the policy which they would adopt if the commission were to report that partition was impracticable. He had put forward his own suggestions to Mr. MacDonald, but had received no indication that they were likely to be acceptable. Alternatively, the Woodhead Commission might report in favour of partition, and he wished to enquire whether, if His Majesty’s Government decided to proceed on that basis, it would be possible for Arab Palestine to join with some neighbouring Arab State. He thought it was clear that a small Arab State in Palestine would not be able to stand alone. 4. I replied that I had read with interest the record which the Secretary of State for the Colonies had made of his conversation with his Excellency regarding Palestine. It was true that His Majesty’s Government were not able to take a new decision regarding their Palestine policy at this moment, before they had received or considered Sir John Woodhead’s report. The whole situation, however, would manifestly have to be considered in the near future, and I thought, if I might say so, that his Excellency’s recent conversation at the Colonial Office had been most helpful. The suggestions which he had put forward would certainly receive full consideration in due course, and I personally had every hope that a solution of this difficult problem might be found, which would be reasonable and fair to all concerned. As regards his Excellency’s further question, respecting the position of Arab Palestine after partition. I thought it would be premature to consider this aspect of the problem at the present stage. 5. I proceeded to refer to the remarks which his Excellency had made at our previous conversation regarding Alexandretta. I explained that His Majesty’s Government would not feel able to take the initiative in endeavouring to secure a final settlement of the Alexandretta problem on the basis of partition between Turkey and Syria; but I added that, if it were at any time found that partition was acceptable to Turkey and France, as the parties chiefly concerned, His Majesty’s Government for their part would not see any objection to such a proposal. 6. I added that there was another point which his Excellency had raised at our previous conversation; he had asked that His Majesty’s Government would use their influence with the French Government in favour of the early ratification of the Franco-Syrian Treaty, and against any suggestion for the establishment of special regimes in Syria. His Majesty’s Government would be prepared tor bring to the notice of the French Government the anxiety which his Excellency had expressed, more especially as regards the position in the Jezireh, and to ask tor any information which the French Government could give them as to the progress of negotiations. Taufiq Suwaidi observed that he had hoped that His Majesty s Government would have felt able, not merely to pass on the Iraqi Government’s views and misgivings, but also actively to endorse them. I replied that an enquiry on the lines suggested would no doubt suffice to induce the French Government to examine carefully the Iraqi Government’s point of view, and that I thought that he would regard this as satisfactory. , ? th® 11 r j[ se .d the question of the Iraqi Government’s participation in the Empire Air Mail Scheme. I said that I did not intend to go into details but only to say that this question had now been under consideration for a very ong time, that the original British proposals had been modified on several occasions to meet what were believed to be the Iraqi Government’s wishes and that I understood that the latest British offer represented the limit to which the British authorities were prepared to go. We therefore hoped to hear soon that the present proposals, which were thought likely to benefit the interests both of Iraq and of this country, were acceptable to the Iraqi Government Taufio Bagdad 1&gt;ep ied that he WOuld certainl y look int &lt;&gt; the matter on his return to 8. Finally, Taufiq Suwaidi expressed his thanks for everything that had been done for him during his week’s visit, which he had greatly appreciated. I am, &amp;c. HALIFAX.1* Although the Treaty of Alliance between Great Britain and Iraq came into force in October 1932 f effect has not yet been given to Article 4 of the Annexure, 2. - The Iraqi Governn nt has never accepted as binding the secret and unpublished letter from Nuri Pasha to Sir rinois Humphrys , dated 30 April. 1930, on account of its unconstitutional ch racter, and because its terms are inconsis ent with ^oth the text and the intention of Article 4 itself. 3. - ’he Iraqi Gove nment considers it es ential that the guards or the protection of the British air bases should be drawn from —ij'.--:-•- .-i uAc Iraqi forces. It has therefore be n unable to accent various proposals which have been put forward in the pact £&gt;r a special 'Air Defence Force' which would, except in name, be indistinguishable from the present Levies, the existence of which it was the intention to terminate. I theregfre request His Majesty’s Government to agree tnat the guards shall be detached from one or other of the following Iraqi forces: (a) The regular Iraqi army (in which case the Iraqi Government agree that the Commanding Officer shall be a British Officer attached to the British fililltary Mission); or, (b) The Iraqi Police who, through the Directorate General, are under the control of the Ministry of the Interior. 27.9.38.■» 6v,C\ C\1 • A.- iY 20 T OF BASRA. r ?he continued registration of the lands occupied &gt;y tde ort of ra i / ■ e of His • jcrr.y s aovernirjent as amer, is an anachronistic survival from the days of the Mandate. It is considered that registration in the name of the Iraqi Gove nrnent should no longer be delayed. I therefore request His Majesty’s Government to agree unconditionally to the change of registration. If the fact that the Port loan has not yet been completely repaid is considered to be an obstacle, the Iraqi ov - • . ‘ repay the balance of the loon without elay.NO. 3 KUWAIT. 1. - Kuwait presents a two-fold ait presents a two-fold problew (a) it has become an entrepot for extensive arms traffic and smuggling; (b) it bars Iraq’s access to the open sea 2. - His Majesty’s Foreign Office is alreaay familiar with problem (a). The activities centred in Kuwait have for many years caused grave financial loss to Iraq in the shape of loss of customs revenue and extraordinary ex enuiture on preventive measures. The arms traffic also gravely complicates the task of maint, ining law and order, particularly in the tribal areas of the Euphrates. 3. - As regards (b), Iraq's only channel of access to the sea is at present the Ghatt-al-Arab. The Iraqi Government feels that it is of vital importance to secure ah alternative for the following reasons: congested with the development of the Anglo Iranian Oil Company. If oil is discovered in the sra Wilayat, developments of equal magnitude may be expected, and these must not be restricted by the ^hatt-al-Arab bottle neck; (c) after completion of the Tell-Kochik- Baghdad section of the railway, the Government proposes to extend the line as far south as possible with a view to inaugurating a fast messenger service to India, and shares the view of the original (a) the recent dispuie with Iran has emphasised the unreliability of the Shatt line: Iran is in a position to interrupt it at any time; (b) the Shatt tends to become more and more promoters....promoters of the Baghdad railway, that the terminus snould be on the sea and not on the Shatt-al-Arab. 4. - Just before the War of 1914 - 1j18, Kuwait was an autonomous ciadha of the Wilayat of Basra. The Iraqi Government, as the successor of the Ottoman Government in the Wilayets of Mosul, Baghdad and Basra, considers that Kuwait should properly be incorporated in Iraq. If incorporation should take place, Iraq would agree to maintain the local autonomy of Kuwait with a guarantee in the form of a special statute, but of course without prejudice to Ira i sovereignty. 5&gt;. - If His Majesty’s Government will agree to the incorporation of Kuwait in Iraq, the two problems referred to in paragraph 1 will be automatically solved. If not, the solution of each must be found separately. 6 . - Solution of the smuggling and orrns-traffic problem can be sought by one of the three following methods, arranged in order of effectiveness: (a) A customs Union between Iraq and Kuwait, Kuwait to receive a fixed annual sum in lieu of its present customs revenue: (b) the northern frontier line of Kuwait to run from west to east at about lat. 29o 35', instead of about 30o N. as at present, so as to give the Iraqi preventive services more space in which to operate south of Zubair, Shaiba and other villages south of the Hammar Lake; (c) combined preventive ooerations. V. - As regards direct access to the sea, two alternative positions for a port and railway terminus suggest themselves for....for inveetiagation:- (a) a suitable site to be selected on Kuwait Bay; (b) the inland extension of the Khor Abdullah, named on the map Khor Zubair. If the first alternative is found preferable, it would be necessary for Iraq to lease from Kuwait a site for a ^ort on the Bay, and a corridor for the railway line. The second would involve a slight rectification of the frontier - that proposed under paragraph 6 (b) above would be more than ample - at the eastern end - so as to give sufficient room at Uimn Qasr (a probable site) and lerve the whole of t e Khor Abdullah in Ira Pending further investigation the Iraqi Government would be glad to be assured that His Majesty’s Government, in principle, would be disposed to consider favourably either alternative.1. - The Iraqi Government believes that the real interests of the British mpire and of the Arab world coincide so closely that co-operation in the Near East is both possible and desirable. As the ally of Great Britain, Iraqiin particular would wish that in a time of world crisis, His Majesty’s Government should be able to count on the loyal end active assistance of all the rabs, and not have to divert any part of their forces to that region to repress disorder or to counter a threat from any Arab element. The Palestine affair is poisoning what might be a most healthy political condition of the Near East. The Arabs, the Sa* -aaabad Governments and the whole of the Islamic world look upon the policy hitherto followed with feelings of dismay. 2. - Even the Royal Commission, which, for the first time, suggested partition and the formation of an independent political Jewish State in Palestine, did not claim that this was an ideal solution. They clinched their argument in favur of it as against, for instance, cantonisation, by expressing the opinion that partition offered 'one supreme advantage - the possibility it offers of eventual peace'. The event, however, has shown beyond all argument that the nremise on which the Royal Commission based its conclusions was false. The very suggestion of partition has fanned the flames of race-hatred to a degree of heat never before reached. 3. - The Ira i Government has n numerous occasions made representations to His Lin jesty’s Government in this connection both..( 62 - both on behalf of the origint l Arab inii; bitants of Palestine on whom it believes the policy hitherto followed to be inflicting the gravest injustice (representations which it is not proposed to repeat in the present aide-memoire) and * l so on the general political grounds surnm rised in prragraph I above. His Majesty’s Government have been good enou hi to assure the Iraqi Government in reply, that these representations would be considered with the greatest attention. 4. - The Ira .^i Government is therefore genuinely perplexed and disturbed - (a) to note that, in spite of the considerations set forth in the three preceding paragraphs, on every occasion that a spokesman of the United Kingdom has occasion to make a declaration on Palestine, the uncomoromising statement is repeated that His Majesty's Government adhere to the view that partition offers the best solution; and (b) to learn, on vhat it believes to be respectable authority, tret the Woodhouse Technical Commission styled itself ” Partition Commission and refused to h&lt;ar any evidence intended to show that no scheme of partition could be practicable or equitable. . - There thus aopears to be a grave danger that alter the Woodhouse Commission has reported, the aly solution in the field will be one for partition, i«e. a solution that could only be forced through at great cost in blood and treasux'e, and with unfortunate poliiical consequences. b. - I ask to be enlightened as to why His Majesty's Government (in spite of the reactions to the proposal lor partition, which of course they could not foresee in July, 1937, when they issued their statement of policy, but which have since become manifest), have continued to concentrate on study of partitionpartition to the exclusion of any other proposal which might offer possibilities of an agreed solution. Two such schemes can be mentioned: - (a) the scheme sponsored by Colonel Newcombe, and already agreed to by many influential i-.rabs and Jews of moderate vieww (details have alre?dy been communicated to His Majesty’s Government); and (b) a scheme for the division of Palestine into a number - perhaps between IP to 20 - of small federate^ cantons (rather on the lines of a scheme understood to have been propounded at one stage by Lord Hunciman for Czechoslovakia). 7. - I earnestly beg His - ajesty’s Government to have detailed schemes worked out on these two bases in addition to any scheme for partition which may have been worked out by the Woodhouae Commission, in order that all possible alternatives may be simultaneously studied by a conference of Representatives of all interests involved, in the hope that an agreed and durable solution may emerge.Copy. NO. 5. ALSXAIIDPvSTTA 1. The Iraqi Government maintains its ox in: 71 QC i^nH^t^thte 'best solution of the Alexandretta question, holm fo^wapticfel reasons and also in the best interests of A rah -TurS slT” rel^tTOhs, would be division betY/een Syria and 'Turkey. 2. miring the course of my visit to Paris early in September, 1938, I ascertained from Monsieur Georges Bonnet that the French Government, ‘‘•hough unwilling to take any initiative in this direction, would have no objection to the Iraqi Government’s doing so at an opportune moment, and also that it had no objection in principle to division. 3. The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me this month at Geneva that while Turkey considered the reopening of the question at the present moment inopportune, they would not attempt to bind the Syrian Government and would continue to consider the Iraqi Government as eventual mediators in the matter. Monsieur Aras further promised to use his influence with the French Government, to ratify the Franco-Syrian treaty not later than November, 1938. 4. In view of these assurances and the declaration of Monsieur Paul Boneour in the Sixth Committee on September 20th 1958 that France intended to ratify the treaty shortly, and that the delay v/as due to only trivial points of detail, I refrained from raising the embarrassing question of the irregularity of the arrangement regarding Alexandretta, made direct betv/een France and Turkey, an arrangement entirely inconsistent with the previous decisions of the Council of the League. 5. The Iraqi Government trusts that His Majesty’s Government will use its good offices, whenever a suitable op ortunity offers, to secure the reopening of this question with a view to settling it finally on the basis of division.No. 6 . SYRIA. ( ^kyi IL e / i oo » i i i 1* - The Iraqi Government is seriously perturbed by the delay in the ratification of the Franco-Syrian treaty. It understands that this delay is due, not to rrdnor matters of detail as Monsieur Pf-uI Boncour gave it to be understood in the Sixth Committee of the Assembly, but to fundamental additions and alterations which the French Govern ent wishes to impose, and to v/hich the Syrian Government can never agree. ^-he date for the complete emancipation has been fixea for January 1940, the preparations for the taking over of complete responsibility by the Syrian Government are in ceitain essential pariicula s, notably, the formation of a regular national army, far less advanced than they were in Iraq at the corresponding date - viz. June 1930, 16 months before our entry into the League. 2. - Of the new proposals which are delaying ratification, the one which causes the Iraqi Govern ent the gravest preoccupation on its own account is one for a special regime for the upper Jazira. E ,p rience has conclusively shown that special regimes set up in opposition to the permanent and unalterable conditions can have no : ermanence and frequently lead to disaster. io set up a special regime in the upxjer Jazira would, furthermore, expose it to the same political fate as Alexanuretta, or, in view of the heterogenous nature of the inhabitants, worse. 3. - Reference is invitee to paragraph 3 oi aide-memoire No.5. on Alexandretta, recording the promise of Monsieur Aras to use his influence with the Freflch Government to ratify the Franco Syrian Treaty this November. 1 request His La^esty’s Government simi larly to use their influence ior early rectification, ana against any suggestion for the setting up of s^ec-al regimes in Syria (especially the upper ^azira) which can only pr mote aiscora.INDIA O^ICIS 4th October 1938 ?.Z. 6804/38 My dear Crosthwaite, I pm sorry not to have been able to let you have our views sooner on the minutes you sent me relntin^ to certain matters affecting Koweit which the Iraoi Foreign Finister wishes to discuss. Subject to the following suggestions we agree generally with the minutes:- Note D. Intern^tional status of Koweit. It might be recalled, for Lord Halifax’s information, that His Majesty’s Government in 1914 recognised the independence of Koweit in return for its assistance against Turkey. Note a. Smuggling. We suggest the addition of the following sentence to para.9 - 'In November 193o the then Foreign Minister, Dr.Naji al Asil, made enquiries during a visit to Koweit into the matter of arms smuggling from Koweit into Iraq, and declared himself sati sfie'‘ / Crosthwaite, sq., Foreign Office.1 ’ lot i*) satisfied, after a discussion with the Sheikh, thrt the reports on this subject received by the Iraq Government were entirely erroneous ,, . Para. 7 (i). It seems to us that a customs union between Iraq and Koweit would be open to ^rave objection as a danger to the political integrity of Koweit, and we think that His Majesty’s Government ought not to offer to put the suggestion to the Sheikh. Te suggest that the last sentence of this section should be deleted and the Iraqi Foreign Minister told that the proposal is inacceptable. Para. 8 , last sentence. would prefer that this should run - ’‘Be that an it may. His Majesty’s Government would have no objection, subject to Koweit’s territorial rights not being infringed, to even the most stringent measures of frontier control , the result of which might, v/ell be to influence the Sheikh to desire negotiations for a special agreement with the Iraqi Government forthwith.” The warning given to the Theikh l^st winter that the Iraqis were contemplating vigorous preventive measures had apparently no effect on him, possibly because he thought([£$) {cftT it wn .8 bluff, as the sequel spp.nrently showed. It would be useless to repeat the warning, and it is really for the Iraqis to demonstrate that they mean business. Yours sincerely,US1 3./ NOTHING TO BE WRITTEN IN THIS MARGIN. NOTE D. International status of Koweit. This question was first raised by the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs in a conversation with Sir M. Peterson on the 12th Anril last. 2. His Excellency observed that in the Anglo-Turkish Convention (unratified) of July, 1913, Koweit was recognised as being an autonomous kaza of the Basra Vilayet and thus as forming part of the Ottoman Empire. Koweit was not, therefore, at the time an independent State, and since the sovereignty of the Basra Vilayet had subsequently passed from the old Ottoman Empire to the new Iraqi Kingdom, it appeared that Koweit now in fact stood in relation to Iraq in the same position as it had stood in relation to the Ottoman Empire at the time when the Anglo-Turkish Agreement had been negotiated. His Excellency added that Iraq had, in fact, never recognised any change in the status of Koweit3. The question was later gone into at the Foreign Office, when it was found that the arguments advanced by the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs had, in reality, little force. By the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923 the future of all territories outside the boundaries of the new Turkey was left to be determined by 'the parties concerned.^ The location of the frontiers of Iraq, with the exception of her frontier with Turkey, was therefore a matter depending solely on the subsequent decisions of the Allied Powers. It can be shown, however, that there was .never any intention on the part of those Powers to include Koweit in any shape or form within the boundaries of Iraq nor is there any decision that Iraq shall include the Basra Vilayet as such. On the contrary, it is clear that the frontiers of Iraq have always been considered (e.g. for the purpose of the z 5 K &lt; 2 tn x H Z Z ill h* 5 UJ m o F- 0 Z X h- o z Treaty/NOTHING TO BE WRITTEN IN THIS MARGIN Treaty of Alliance of 1922, which was accepted by the League) to be the de facto boundaries which have been in force since Iraq became a separate country, and further that when in 1952 the frontier between Iraq and Koweit was fixed by an exchange of notes, this exchange of notes was a formal confirmation of the line previously existing and that the line was the frontier of Iraq, leaving her no rights beyond it. 4. It will thus be seen that in order to establish any claim to Koweit, Iraq would have to show some decision of the Allied Powers giving her rights over Koweit and that the fact that Iraq may not have formally recognised the present status of Koweit does not really affect the matter at issue.

Kuwait presents a two-fold problem for Iraq: (a) it has become an entrepot for extensive anas traffic and smug; ling; (b) it bars Iraq's access to the open sea. 4. Just before the War of 1914-1918, Kuwait was an autonomous qaoha of the Wil&amp;y&amp;t of Basra. The Iraqi Govern ment as the successor of the Ottoman Government in the filay&amp;ts of Mosul, Baghdad and Basra, considers that Kuwait should properly be incorporated in Iraq.

This question falls into two parts: smuggling of arms and other forms of contraband. The Iraqi Government have in recent years made frequent complaints of arms smuggling from Koweit into Iraq, without however producing any positive evidence in support of their accusations. The Koweit authorities have consistently maintained that there was no truth in these statements and the attitude of His Majesty’s Government has hitherto been to support their view, in the absence of any concrete evidence to the contrary. / ?, Air Headquarters in Iraq have recently reported that, according to information in their possession, there is extensive arms smuggling into Southern Iraq via Kov/eit. These reports have been denied by the authorities in the Gulf, who state that a) there is no traffic in arms from Koweit into Iraq, b) in view of/c of the fact that Koweit is not situated on any of the overland routes, and that no arms enter Koweit by sea, they are of the opinion that the allegation that arms of non-Koweiti origin are smuggled into Iraq via Koweit is unfounded. They consider it probable, however, that there is extensive arms smuggling from Iraq into Saudi Arabia. K The position is, however, uncertain, and in view of the reports which have reached Air Headquarters in Iraq, it is impossible to state definitely that there is no traffic in arms between Koweit and Iraq, although there has as yet been no concrete evidence to show that this is the case. ^ His Excellency might be reminded that His Majesty*s Government are naturally concerned to suppress the traffic in arms and have always taken all possible measures to prevent arms smuggling in the Arah States under their protection. As regards Koweit, the British authorities in the Persian Gulf are satisfied that ... NOTHING TO BE WRITTEN IN THIS MARGIN.NOTHING TO BE WRITTEN IN THIS MARGIN. that the measures taken are adequate to prevent illegal traffic in arms from Koweit into Iraq. His Excellency^ statement cannot therefore be allowed to stand without comment. If, however, the Iraqi Government can produce any evidence to shew that the smuggling of arms does in fact take place through Koweit, His Majesty's Government will certainly be prepared to give the matter their earnest attention*NOTHING TO BE WRITTEN IN THIS MARGIN.4 So far as other forms of smuggling are concerned, Taufig Suwaidi must first be reminded that it is really entirely for the Government of any country to see that smuggling into its territory does not take place, ^ H.E, has suggested three possible methods of solving the problem: (i) a customs union between Irag and Koweit. This would seem open to objection from the political point of view, since such an arrangement between a large State, like Irag, • i and a small State, like Koweit, might be expected to undermine the independence of the Principality. Moreover, the introduction in Koweit of the higher Iragi tariff level might make Koweit’s genuine entrepdt 9 ^trade more difficult. ^ 2 a ^ H.M.G. would be quite prepared to put the j:,, d w l-v?tv A-^J\r^- * suggestion to the Sheikh, but they hardly consider that his reply is likely to be favourable. (ii) Cession to Irag of all Koweiti north territory/of about latitude 29° 35 *. It ....and...« It should he pointed out that Ihis apparently involves the cession to Iraq of about one- third of Koweit, and that, as it was difficul to see what compensation could be given to the Sheikh elsewhere, any arrangement on that scale is likely to meet with insuperable difficulties. (iii) Combined preventive operations. H.E. will recall that, at the beginning of the year, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr informed him that the Sheikh had stated that he was willing to negotiate a special anti-smuggling agreemert with the Iraqi Government once he had reached ! agreement with the Saudi Government regarding the raising of their blockade. These negotiations have been proceeding fairly satisfactorily, and it is hoped that agree ment may now soon be reached. ^ H.M.G. fully realise, however, that if the position regarding smuggling is at all as serious as is suggested in H.E.’s memorandum, the Iraqi Government may feel unwilling to wait until the negotiations between Ibn Saudw w. SllyiLt ' k- '&gt;*■ ^ / ' ! *j :V ‘ ! ' h.; ( .U ^ ^ ^ -v^- ftl St*. W. C ^ W | 0 O and the Sheikh are in fact completed, H,M.G, have never objected in any way to any measures taken by the Iraqi Government to put down illegal traffic from Koweit, so long as Koweit f s territorial rights are not infringed. Here, it could be intimated to H.E. that, according to expert opinion given to H.M.G. in confidence (by Sir John Ward, Director of the Port of Basra), the Iraqi authorities could give smuggling from Koweit a decisive blow if they were to take certain additional measures (daily patrols by aeroplanes and armoured cars on the land, and by revenue cutters at sea). It is furthermore to be considered whether, since smuggling on a large scale could not continue without at least the assistance of organisations or individuals in Iraq, more drastic measures could not be taken to check the traffic inside Iraq. Be that as it may, H.M.G. would have no objection to even the most stringent measures 'l of frontier control, and if the Iraqi Government would elaborate a scheme which they would.... _________________would be prepared to apply, H.M.G. would willingly approach the Sheikh again, and endeavour to persuade him that it would be in the best interests of Koweit to start negotiations for a special agreement with the Iraqi Government forthwith.kQ. 3 - Ku^IT, U Kuwait preseats a two-fold problem for Iraq: (a) it has becoae an eatrepot for extensive ar.ns traffic and smuggling; (b} it bars Iraq's access to the open sea, &amp; His Majesty's Foreign Office is already familiar with problem (a).

Kuwait presents a two-fold problem for Iraq.: (a) it has become an entrepot for extensive arms traffic and smuggling; (b) it bars Iraq’s access to the open sea. 2. His Majesty’s Foreign Office is already familiar with problem (a). The activities centred in Kuwait have for many years caused grave financial loss to Iraq in the shape of loss of customs revenue and extraordinary expenditure on preventive measures. The arms traffic also gravely complicates the task of maintaining law and order,particularly in the tribal areas of the Euphrates. 3. As regards (b), Iraq’s only channel of access to the sea is at present the. Shatt-al-Arab. The Iraqi (xovernment feels that it is of vital importance to secure an alternative for the following reasons: (a) the recent dispute with Iran has emphasised the unreliability of the Shatt line: Iran is in a position to interrupt it at any time; (b) the Shatt tends to become more and more congested with the developaent of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company. If oil is discovered in the Basra Wilayat, developments of equal magnitude may be expected, and these must not be restricted by the Shatt-al-Arab bottle neck; (c) after completion of the Tell-Kochik-Baghdad section of the railway, the Government proposes to extend the line as far south as possible with a view to inaugurating a fast passenger service/7./ service to India, and shares the view of the original promoters of the Baghdad railway, that the terminus should he on the sea and not on the Shatt-al-Arab. 4. Just before the War of 1914-1918, Kuwait was an autonomous qadha of the Wilayat of Basra. The Iraqi Government as the successor of the Ottoman Government in the Wilayats of Mosul, Baghdad and Basra, considers that Kuwait should properly be incorporated in Iraq. If incorporation should take place, Iraq would agree to maintain the local autonomy of Kuwait with a guarantee in the form of a special statute, but of course without prejudice to Iraqi sovereignty. 5. If His Majesty’s Government will agree to the incorporation of Kuwait in Iraq, the two problems referred to in paragraph 1 will be automatically solved. If not, the solution of each must be found separately. 6. Solution of the smuggling and arms-traffic problem can be sought by one of the three following methods, arranged in order of effectiveness: (a) A customs Union between Iraq and Kuwait, Kuwait to receive a fixed annual sum in lieu of its present customs revenue: (b) the northern frontier line of Kuwait to run from west to east at about lat. 29o 35', instead of about 50o N. as at present, so as to give the Iraqi preventive services more space in which to operate south of Zubair, Shaiba and other villages south of the Hammer Lake; (c) combined preventive operations.7. As regards direct access to the sea, two alternative positions for a port and railway terminus suggest themselves for investigation:- (a) a suitable site to he selected on Kuwait Bay; (b) the inland extension of the Khor Abdullah, named on the map Khor Zubair. If the first alternative is found preferable, it would be necessary for Iraq to lease from Kuwait a site for a port on the Bay, and a corridor for the railway line. The second would involve a slight rectification of the frontier - that proposed under paragraph 6 (b) above would be more than ample - at the eastern end - so as to give sufficient room at Umm Qasr (a probable site) and leave the whole of the Khor Abdullah in Iraq. Pending further investigation the Iraqi Government would be glad to be assured that His Majesty's Government, in principle, would be disposed to consider favourably either alternative.pile copy 7 * r* Copies Circulated DepaptmSf IS58 (69 groups) fC jo 3797 &lt;&gt; i;.K CYPHER QP TBLEQHAM .

My dear Baggallay, A week ago the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke to me about the vexed question of smuggling from Koweit. He revived the proposal that the Iraqi Government should take over control of the Koweiti customs, impose the Iraqi tariff and compensate the Shaikh for whatever he might lose through such an arrangement. I made little or no comment other than to say that I would consider the matter. I see now from the Embassy archives that similar suggestions were put forward by the Iraqi Government so long ago as 1932. The Shaikh, however, was obstinately evasive and avoided giving a direct reply. In the early part of 1934 an effort was made to persuade him to send a representative to a conference at which int e r alia ideas of this kind were to be discussed, but he wriggled out at the last moment and the conference was abandoned. In the autumn of the same year two highly-placed Iraqi officials visited the Shaikh and discussed the same proposals with him, but he was quite unable to accept them. Variations of the same proposals were put forward once again by the Embassy in February 1935, but the Foreign / 44 VOffice, in their telegram No. 77 of March 1st, 1935, indicated that they were open to the gravest objections from the political point of view, ''since they would lead to the acquisition by Iraq of a degree of influence in Koweiti affairs which is quite incompatible with the declared policy of His Majesty’s Government as regards the independence of Koweit. H.L. Baggallay, Esq.Koweit M . In these circumstances, it does not seem that it is possible to offer to Taufiq Suwaidi any hope that his idea could be received favourably either in London or Koweit and, subject to any suggestions which you may care to make, I think that the only thing I can say to him is that His Majesty’s Government are still trying hard to have the Saudi blockade of Koweit raised and that, once this has been achieved, there is good reason to hope that smuggling from Koweit into Iraq will be really stopped (see paragraph 5 of Rendel’s letter to Clark Kerr dated Koweit, February 22nd 1957, a copy of which was sent to you with Clark Kerr’s letter (54/30/37) of March 1st, 1937). I have sympathy with the Iraqi point of view in the matter of smuggling from Koweit. Iraq is put to a lot of trouble and expense maintaining frontier control, and the continuance of smuggling embitters Iraqo-Koweiti relations and alternately Iraqo-British relations for we have a special position in regard to both the countries concerned.

They went so far as to say that the import of the te* concerned into Basra, either direct or vie Kuwait, wee •paralysing' the tea trade in Iraq. In paragraph 4 of hie letter Ho. 314/5/37 of 2Cth April, 1937, enclosed with your letter of 13th lay, Hie Sxcellency wrote that it had been suggested to him that an end might be put to the traffic in question if the Iraqi Government were to re quire certificates of origin in respect of ell tea imported into Iraq. In your letter IVo. H.583-H/36 of 22nd October, 1937, His Excellency was informed that the Government of India agreed to this suggestion, and that if His Excellency ssw no objection. Government would be obliged by his approaching the Iraqi Government accordingly. In the same letter His Excellen cy was informed that it was being suggested to me that a similar proposal should be made to the Kuwait Governojent, and this suggestion was contained in your letter to nie of the same number and date. 4.

Sot only did they not do eo, but apparent ly they did not even Inform Hia sscellency that they were taking no action in the matter, it was not in fact until about the P5tn February that the Iraq Government gave a reply to His excellency - vide his despatch Ko. 161/9/38 of 26th February to the Governnient ol India. 1 note, vide paragraph 5 of His Excellency's letter, that the 'Iraqi Government indulge in their usual tactics of attacking Kuwait, In the present ins tance, they aseert that control of the Kuwaiti Customs authori ties would not be strong enough to prevent the smuggling of tea into the htste.

Sven goods conveyed by camel to Basra would cost Rupees forty per ton for transport only. The Ruler of Koweit could not be expected to forego customs dues unless reciprocal arrangements fcr free or reduced, transit were made by Iraq, so that expense on account of Koweit customs must be added. Landing charges in Koweit, owing to the long distance carry by landing boat, and 'It would surely be wiser for tie Sheikh to I do not agree, for reasons which I give below The economic rate for motor transport in this subsequent The Hon f ble Lt.Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.S., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf2 subsequent man-handling, are high, being Rupees five per ton* Therefore to convey a ton from Koweit to Basra would cost between Rupees 50/- and Rupees 60/-, which incidentally in the latter case is as much as is charged for transporting it from London to Koweit. Whereas the Basra port dues on merclandise landed at Basra is about Rupees four per ton and landing charges are tai fils per bag or twenty fils per case* 3* More over , I am info rmed by the Agent of Gray Mackenzie and Company and the Briti sh India Steam Navigation Company and the Striok line Steamers, that the cost of transporting a ton from Karachi, C.I.F.

Government had represented to His Majesty's ambassador Baghdad that tea, unauthorized for export from India, was being imported into Iraq, either direct to Basra or via Kuwait and thus 'paralysing* the legitimate trade of tea in Iraq. '3. The Government of India on this asked me to approach His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait to forbid the import to or transit through Kuwait of tea unaccompanied by a certificate of lawful exportation from India. To this the Shaikh agreed without reservation (vide my letter under reference). 4 Caotain de Gaury now informs me as follows: - ^ , * (a) that on the 24th of December 1937 a dhow ex India belonging 11 to Mohammed Thanayan, master AMul-Asls Wlshal, haring Been refused permission by the Shaikh to lanr. tea at Kuwait, since his cargo had no certificate of lawful exportation, RECo. iPOL 9EIPT. proceeded to 2 3 JAN 1938 /— 2 - to Basrah, where 340 bags were lai.ded without difficulty • (to) That on the 5th January 1937 a dhow belonging to Khalid Abdul i-atif was also refused permission to land tea at Kuwait for similar reasons, ti.at the dhow proceeded to Basrah wliore it sanded 250 bags of tea again without difficulty. 5, In these circumstances there is not unnaturally a considerable amount of feeling in Kuwait both against the Sheikh and against our sieves. Unless, therefore, the Iraq OOTormnent, who it will be seen orginaliy raised the question, can be induced to stop the import of unauthorisea tea, I do not see how we can expect the Shaikh to continue to injure the trade of his State by prohibiting the import ox' the •&amp;ea in question. I suggest, therefore, that on receipt of information by Captain de Gaury of the next consignment of unauthorised tea being allowed to be landed at Basrah, vie should inform the Shaikh forthwith that he is released frora his engage ment* I would be grateful for telegraphic instruction on this point sd.

It &lt;3-oes not appear to me that the Shaikh of Kuwait was under any legal obligation to take this action, and his readiness to oblige the Government of India - he made no demur as to taking the necessary action - is another proof of the friendliness which he has towards us, more especially perhaps in- view of the long delay which has occurred on our part in the matter of settling the questions of his date gardens in Iraq, and of the Saudi Blockade of his territory.■ &gt;’ ?« . . c .p ■■ y 4- * «.* k j - r i *7 ' i / j ^ ^v- ^ •W' • 1^3 $ Translation of an article appearin g in the^ iraqi newsnarer ^Al-Bjlad 1 * dated, Baghdad 28th iaoveipber 1937 ♦ AH IRAQI-KUWAITI COKFEBa^OE TO COMBAT StfUGGLIKG .

Meanwhile feeling on the Iraqi side is growing more bitter as time goes on, and there appears to be a real danger that if no steps are taken on the Koweit side to arrest smuggling into Iraq, the Iraqi Government may soon decide to impose a rigid blockade of the frontier. The situation has in fact become so difficult 4136b 1000 10.35 that it was felt desirable to take advantage of the/the recent presence of Sir Archibald Clark-Kerr, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad and Sir Trenchard Powle, done to improve matters. A record of the discussion will be found immediately below, and it will be noted (paragraph 13) that it was agreed: (a) That there would be no advantage in asking the Iraqi Government to agree either to the demarcation of the Iraq-Koweit frontier, or to the establishment of a standing Frontier Commission at this stage; (b) That His Majesty’s Ambassador should, on his return to Bagdad, ascertain the precise intentions of the Iraqi Government in regard to the proposed blockade; and (c) That when this information is received the Sheikh of Koweit should be warned, in the clearest terms, of the measures contemplated by the Iraqi Government to put an end to smuggling; that every effort should be made to impress upon him the extremely inconvenient consequences to which he would be exposed if he maintained his present attitude and that it should be suggested to him that it would be in his own interests to choose the lesser of two evils and to agree to meeting the Iraqi wishes for the suppression of smuggling.

The aeroplanes would patrol the whole frontier at dawn every day and any movement across frontier would be reported by short v/ave wireless to cars (distributed at wireless station bases) which would then round up people observed by aircraft- Further patrolling would also be carried out by cars and the cutters would patrol coast.

Brenan ) 2. ^ r. endel said that the situation between Iraq and i.oweit, and particularly in regard to the question of smuggling, had beco^ so difficult that it seemed desirable to take advantage of the presence in this country of 3ir A. Clark ierr and 3ir T. owle to have an informal interdepartmental discussion to see whether anything could be done to improve matters. There were two questions for discussion, an immediate one regarding a recent incident of a fairly serious character when Iraqi/ r/■V Iraqi police had penetrated a long way into Koweiti territory, ani a general one, i.e. the whole^situetion between Koweit and Iraq and the policy which ought now to be followed. 3. Aa regards the first, it was clear from the Acting political Resident*s telegram Mo. 994 of October 18th and agdad telegram No. 938 of -ctober 20th - the text of which was read out to the meeting - that Iraqi police had penetrated some 30 miles inside the Koweiti frontier. It was generally agreed that this case was so well established and so serious that a protest would certainly have to be made to the Iraqi Government about it. Sir T.Fowle and the India Office representatives were anxious that this should be linked up with the question of the establishment of a frontier commission, or at least with arrangements for the demarcation of the frontiexj. sir A. Clark kerr and the Foreign Office representatives, however, felt that it would be useless to do more than to make a formal protest, as there would be no hope, in existing conditions, of iU&lt;U“ *l\t L jiueocA tv Ofu** fc a* tvirU KUcU flu Pd.

It was agreed that telegraphic instructions should be sent to Mr. icott to make a strong protest about this case aa soon as possible. 4. Turning to the general question of smuggling, r. Rendel drew attention to the extremely unsatisfactory character of the present situation. The sheikh of Koweit took the line that he was under no obligation to take any steps to stop smuggling. This was perfectly correct, and the dheikh was entirely within his legal rights in allowing the smuggling to go on. But as a result of this the Iraqis were becoming increasingly ill- disposed towards him, and it was becoming impossible for His k'ajesty's Government to obtain fro^ the Iraqis the settlement of any outstanding questions in which the sheikh of Koweit was involved. The most important of these was the question of the Sheikh’s date weak ground in pressing the Iraqis to settle this question, where we h f -)d entered into a gardens in Iraq. We were unfortunately on \ perpetual//\ perpetual OowrnitrTent which we had failed to get the Iraqis formally and specifically to take over in 1924, though it was more or less covered by a general provision of our treaty* The Sheikh’s attitude on the smug;ling question had very greatly increased our difficulties* 5. 3ir A* Clark Kerr strongly confirmed this statement. He explained that, if the Sheikh had shown the slightest willingness to meet the Iraqis over the question of smuggling a year ago, it would have been easy for him to secure a satisfactory settlement of the date gardens question. Hikmat Juleiman, the then Prime Minister, had been perfectly ready to conclude a comprehensive settlement with Koweit, which would have disposed once and for all of all these questions. The Sheikh’s insistence, however, on his legal freedom to allow smuggling to go on, and refusal to make any satisfactory offer to the Iraqis with a view to the suppression of smuggling^ even afterjthe Saudi ^ Uwt£t blockade of Koweit should have been lifted, had completely wrecked any hope of this comprehensive settlement/settlement, and had made it nruch more difficult Ju /. ?ktAj{c .MH d^uiri fU.*( fUu fy'** A&lt;t*4A&lt;*tZ C*- fhai' '^UfuLkAsO /4t*AJi*y9 A^lwiAtw flu#* Vu^AA A M Ca+iax. jne fa tfn Ayvixx^tjJL ftmlo , ft* RtAtfaL.

Fowle and the India Office representatives having insisted that smuggling was carried on mainly by Iraqis for the benefit of people in Iraq, fcr. Remtel replied that, even if this were so, Koweit must obviously bear the main responsibility for the smuggling, since it was through Koweit that the goods were imported. Moreover, the dheikh himself had admitted that, if smuggling were stopped before the 3audi blockade was lifted, his State would be ruined. This gave a clear indication of the extent to which his State was at present engaged in smuggling, and the amount of profit derived therefrom. It was credibly reported that the Sheikh was at present putting aside at least £90,000 a year v Meanwhile, the only result of the Sheikh’s present attitude was likely to be that the Iraqis would impose a rigid blockade which would cut off all trade of any kind. It would surely be wiser for the/the SheikJi to reach an agreement with Iraq, which would allow for the continuance of legi .rate trade - of which a good deal would still be carried on with Southern Iraq - if only for the sake of avoiding Basra port dues etc., and which would also lead to a settlement of his outstanding difficulties with Iraq, such as the question of his date gardens, than to drive the Iraqis into imposing a rigid blockade, which would ruin the prosperity of his State. 7. 3ir T. owle took the line that, even if this happened, the dheikh would have no one the prospect). ter. Sendel replied that, however this might he, his Majesty’s Government would be unable to escape all responsibility. Koweit was of political and strategical importance to them, and if it fell into ruin they would, in the end, suffer as much as anyone. moreover. His Majesty’s Government could easily be represented by ill-intentioned but himself Government need not therefore be disturbed by UmiM j*** ** ,A *1 ^ ftMd, . people/people, both in the Arab countries and in Europe, as haying failed to avert a situation where one of their special proteges was ruined by a powerful neighbour. There was every reason therefore why His Majesty’s Government should seek to prevent such a situation from developing. 8. 3ir A. Clark Aerr confirmed that the Iraqis were becoming so tired of the situation that they were seriously contemplating the immediate imposition of a rigid blockade. Sir John Ward had already worked out detailed plane for such a blockade, which would probably include air patrols, searchlights at short intervals on the frontier etc. It was probable that the moment the Iraqis finally realised that the Sheikh was determined to do nothing to meet them, these plans would be put into effect. Mr. Rendel drew attention to the fact that it would be extremely difficult for us to secure the lifting of such a blockade once it had been imposed, and expense had been incurred in putting it into effect. 9./(ier 9. 3ir T. Powle aaid that he thought the situation might be eased if the Iraqis would at l^aat agree to the demarcation of the frontier between Jkoweit and Iraq. Sir A. Clark Kerr and Mr. Rendel pointed out in reply that there was no reason why the Iraqis, from their point of view, should agree to anything at all in regard to Koweit. Their answer to any such proposals would be 'What are we going 'to get out of this?'. The Iraqis were at present so annoyed with the Sheikh of Koweit that they would certainly do nothing to meet his wishes without a very substantial quid pro Quo * This the Jheikh of Koweit had steadily refused to offer them. 10. Sir T. Powle urged that it was in accordance with international custom that a frontier commission should be appointed. Would not this furnish a good reason for pressing the Iraqis to agree to it? Mr. Rendel pointed out that this argument only applied when nations were friendly. Frontier commissions had only been established with Iraq’s/Iraq*a other neighbours after general settlement had been reached with each. This was so in the case of Turkey, Syria and Persia, where it had been impossible to do anything about frontier commissions until general relations had been established on a satisfactory basis. 11. Sir a. Clark Kerr pointed out that, in the case of Koweit, the Irakis regarded the oheikh as a thoroughly unsatisfactory and unfriendly neighbour who was nothing but a nuisance and for whom they were not prepared to do anything at all. The Sheikh was no doubt within his legal rights in refusing to co-operate over the suppression of smuggling, but he might have to pay heavily for insisting on those rights. 12. 3ir T. owle emphasised the importance of not exercising any pressure on the aheikh. The position of His majesty’s Government would become impossible if they tried to oblige him to follow some course of action, and he were to refuse to do so. It was/was not their policy to put pressure of this kind on the Persian Gulf rulers under their protec ion. Mr. Rendel reminded the meeting that His Majesty’s Government had not ao long ago deposed the reigning Sheikh of Bahrein; but Sir T. Kowle regarded this case as not constituting a valid parallel. He agreed however that it would be reasonable to put clearly before the Sheikh the choice of evils with which he was faced, provided he was allowed to choose freely between them. 13. After considerable further discussion, it was eventually agreed (a) that there would be no advantage to be gained in asking the Iraqi Government to agree either to the demarcation of the Iraqi-Koweit frontier or to the establishment of a standing frontier commission at this stage, since they would inevitably refuse both suggestions; (b) that His Majesty’s Ambassador should, however, on his return to Bagdad ascertain the precise intentions of the Iraqi Government in regard to the proposed blockade, and Inform His Majesty’s Government and/and the Political Resident in detail of the particular fonn that that blockade was likely to take; (c) that the Jheikh of Koweit should then be warned in the clearest terms of the measures tne Ira^i Government contemplated taking in order to put an end to the smuggling by instituting a blockade, and that every • effort should be made to impress upon him the extremely inconvenient consequences to which he would be exposed if he maintained his present attitude; (d) that (the Jhelkh should be urged evils, and to agree to meeting the Iraqis’ wishes over the suppression of smuggling, in order that, if possible, some comprehensive settlement might be arrived at between him and Iraq, which would at least provide for the continuance of legitimate trade and possibly that, on the receipt of further information as to the precise measures which the Iraqi Government proposed to take with a view to instituting a blockade, the necessary for this reason to | choose the lesser of two &lt;|vu/vt&lt;i4U^ ItlatiTwa settle the date gardens question; (e) finally \ instructions/instructions to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to give effect to conclusions (c) and (d) above should be drafted by the India Office and Foreign Office in consultation.CONFIDENTIAL.

I fear that it would be of no \mlue to inform Iraqi Government of nature of settlement now being negotiated between Koweit and Saudi Arabia and to refrain at the same time from any suggestion that His Majesty's Government will move the Sheikh to conclude similar agreement with Iraq when smuggling agreement with Saudi Arabia is in working order. All the more so because there now seems little prospect of early settlement with Saudis. Bare assurance that Sheikh was ready to negotiate anti smuggling arrangements with. Iraq, after agreement with Saudi Arabia, will make no appeal to Iraqis. and Koweit - Iraqi problems, my original proposal for submission of Koweit-Saudi draft to Iraqi Government was made mainly in the hope that it would be taken as an immediate earnest of our good will and afford a means of setting on foot discussions for comprehensive settlement, so much to be desired. When I made it there seemed to be more than a good chance of achieving this. But so many months have passed since Prime Minister first asked for our help that I fear we have allowed a good opportunhity to Having regard to the differences between Koweit - Saudi( (¥1 slip and I doubt now that even if I were authorised to follow procedure (to which my original proposal was gradually whittled down) suggested as a pis-aller in my telegram, ho. 50 of February 10th the atmosphere necessary to negotiation of a comprehensive settlement would be created. In these circumstances the best course would probably be to abandon my proposals and to resign ourselves to shelving all questions outstanding between Iraq and Koweit (apart of course from current frontier incidents) until Koweit has concluded agreement with Saudis because if I now return to the charge aboau the gardens I shall certainly be asked about smuggling and shall have no reply. 7/hen Saudi agreement has been concluded Sheikn might be invited to act as described by political agent Koweio in paragraph 5 of Mr. Renders letter of February 22nd to me from Koweit and, if he does I can then go ahead with question of gardens« Addressed to Foreign Office.

(a) His Majesty^ Ambassador at Bagdad has been told that if the Iraqi Government raise the question of a Koweit-Iraqi anti-smuggling agreement in response to any representations which he may make to them about the date gardens belonging to the Sheikh of Koweit in Iraq, he may reply that the Sheikh is quite willing to discuss an anti-smuggling agreement, but desires before doing so to conclude the discussions which are at present taking place for an agreement on the same question between The present position is as follows: Koweit and Saudi Arabia, and may add that His/ M.J.Clauson Esq.His Majesty's Government agree that the simplest and most expeditious course will he to take one step at a time and will continue to use their good offices on these lines. (h) His Majesty's Ambassador has reluctantly agreed to take up the question of tht date gardens on the understanding that he can use the language indicated above about the anti-smuggling agreement but v/ishes in addition to be able to inform the Iraqi Government at need of the basis of the anti smuggling discussions which are taking place between Koweit and Saudi Arabia. (c) The Political Resident deprecates the suggestion that the basis of the Koweit-Saudi discussions should be communicated to the Iraqi Government on the ground that the fact that this information had been so communicated might come to the knowledge of the Sheikh, who would regard the action taken as something very like a discussion of the smuggling question, upon which he does not at present wish to embark.yjTJD 3. I am afraid that I have 'been holding up the papers over here in the hope that some development would take place in the Saudi-Koweit discussions which might enable some progress to be made with the corresponding Koweit- IraQi discussions. But nothing has happened since Bullard reported that Fuad Hamza proposed to discuss the stion with Ibn Baud during the pilgrimage and the discussions do not seem likely to lead to any result for the time being. In these circumstances, and as a further telegram has been received from Clark Kerr asking for an early reply to his last enquiry (see paragraph 2 (b) above),I feel that we must try to make some move to eliminate the deadlock which seems to have arisen, especially as the gap between what Clark Kerr has been authorised to say and what he wants to say has been narrowed considerably already. 4. Would it not be possible in these circumstances for the Political Resident to be asked, in view of the fact that no reliance can be placed on the early conclusion of a Koweit-Saudi anti-smuggling agreeiient, to arrange for a further communication to be made to the Sheikh in the following sense: ”His Majesty’s Ambassador in Bagdad is about to ’’take up again with the Iraqi Government the ’’question/’’question of the date gardens belonging to the ’’Sheikh in Iraq. He has expressed the opinion ’’that the present time is comparatively favourable 'for representations of this kind provided only ’’that some indication can be given to the Iraqi ’’Government, should they raise the point, of the ’’extent to which the Sheikh is willing to go in ’’regard to an anti-smuggling agreement, and that ’’the representations should be made as soon as ’’possible. It is obviously in the Sheikh’s own ’’interests to facilitate the task of His Majesty’s ’’Ambassador in any way he can. It is already 'understood that the Sheikh does not wish to embark ’’upon discussions for an anti-smuggling agreement ’’until the corresponding discussions with the ’’Saudi Government are finished (whish may not of 'course be for some little time). It is also ’’understood that the Sheikh is willing that His ’’Majesty’s Ambassador should inform the Iraqi ’’Government, if the question arises, that he ’’(the Sheikh) will open discussions for an anti- ’’smuggling agreement with the Iraqi Government 'when the Saudi discussions have been concluded 'and/1 'and the arrangement reached is in working order. 'This is all right asTar as it goes, hut His 'Majesty f s Ambassador, who is in the hest position 'to judge of the chances of reaching agreement with 'the Iraqi Government about the date gardens is 'in addition most anxious to be permitted at need 'to inform the Iraqi Government of the basis of 'the discussions now taking place between Koweit 'and Saudi Arabia. The Iraqi Government would 'probably have no difficulty in obtaining these 'particulars from the Saudi Government, but it 'would be much better that they should obtain 'them from His Majesty's Ambassador. In these 'circumstances His Majesty's Government suggest 'that the Sheikh (as the person whose interests 'are mainly affected) should consider afresh 'whether there is really any reason for withholding 'his consent to the communication to the Iraqi 'Government of particulars regarding the 'discussions now proceeding with Saudi Arabia. 'In making any such communication, His Majesty's 'Ambassador could make it clear that although the 'Sheikh/'Sheikh had no objection to informing the Iraqi 'Government of the basis of his discussions with 'the Saudi Government, this did not necessarily 'mean that he regarded the agreement now under 'discussion with Saudi Arabia as forming a 'suitable basis for any corresponding agreement 'with -Lraq.' 5 Perhaps you will consider the possibility of telegraphing to the Political Resident on these lines. should be sent as soon as possible, in view of the delay that has already occurred, and of the fact that the golden moment which Clark Kerr foresaw some time ago may be rapidly slipping away, if indeed it has not already slipped away altogether. For this reason, I feel that Clark Kerr ought if possible to be placed in a position to furnish the Iraqi Government with any information they may ask for about the Koweit-Saudi negotiations (or alternatively should know definitely that he cannot do so) before he embarks on his representations, and not merely told that if, as a result of his representations, the Iraqis raise 6 I think it is desirable that any instructions the/&gt; the point, the matter will be further considered. In the latter case the further delays which might becopy * (E 628/29/91). Air Mail - K.L.M. British Embassy, Bagdad. 19th January &gt; 1937. a 26 My dear George, It was as far back as the 14th of November that I asked in my telegram No.289, for authority to make some proposals to Hikmat Sulaiman about Koweit smuggling. 2. Since then I have said that I thought that, if this .were done, the atmosphere would be favourable for sa comprehensive settlement and that we ought to act * * quickly. I have explained that it seemed to me to be profitless to have a shot at any of the Koweit questions unless we could make simultaneous proposals about smuggling. I did not mean that all these questions should be jumbled together. All I meant was that, if only we could get things started by the throwing at Hikraat of something decent about smuggling, I thought that I had a chance of getting everything settled. 3. I still hold this view strongly and I urge that I may be allowed to get things started without any more loss of time, that is to say while the present rosy relationship with the Iraqis lasts. I do not suggest that the first fine gush of friendship on Hikmat's part shows any signs of passing, but I hate to see the weeks slipping by when we might be taking advantage of it. Lf-Jtl Your telegram No. 16 of the 15th did not provoke any happiness in me, for I had been encouraged by the India Office telegram No.29 of the 6th to hope that my suggestion for a comprehensive settlement was as good as adopted. G.W. Rendel, Esq., C.M.G* 5./n 5. I agree that it would be best to have settled the question of the date gardens on its merits, but I feel that at present there is next to no chance of bringing this about in the way you suggest. It must be remembered that Yasin’s undertaking was a personal one and that he never went further than to tell Charles Bateman that he would recommend it to the Council of Ministers. I do not think that Hikmat would relish any suggestion that he is bound by such an undertaking* 6* If I go to Hikmat on the date gardens question alone he will get all excited again about smuggling and I shall be embarrassed to find any excuse for making no proposals* You will remember that he has told me through Edmonds that he is willing to go further than his predecessors to settle the gardens if only I will help him about smuggling* I want to take him at his word and I want to do this quickly* 7* As to the instructions in your telegram No*16 I have therefore confined myself to telling Naji that the time will soon come when we shall take up with him the Bateman note* I was not surprised when he said that he had not read it* But he undertook to do so and to discuss it at our nest meeting* 8* I should have put a lot of this into a telegram to you if I had not received today your telegram No*19 and allowed myself to feel encouraged again. As regards Fowle*s No*63 of the 16th - I hope that he will be successful in persuading the Shaikh. 9* In any case, as I must have made clear to you, there was no questioning of M bargaining ,t in my programme* Yours ever, (Jntld^A.C.

My dear Williams, Would you kindly refer to Bushire telegram of the 14th December, No.884, of which a copy was sent to you on the 15th December, P.Z.8909/36, about Koweiti-Iraqi relations. We are not entirely convinced by the argument put forward by the Sheikh against starting discussions with the Iraqi Government on the subject of smuggling control, and I if the Foreign Office concur, we propose to send to Colonel Fowle. You will no doubt wish to reply at the same time to Bagdad telegram of 6th December, No.312. As regards (b) of this telegram we assume that the Foreign Office remain of the opinion expressed question should not be mixed up with the other questions outstanding between Koweit and Iraq, and if so we would suggest that the Ambassador should be informed accordingly and requested to lose no time in urging the Iraqi Government to tackle this question on the lines of the proposals in Mr.Bateman’s note of July last. He might perhaps tell the Prime Minister that the Iraqi i Government could show their desire for / / enclose a copy of a draft telegram whichI 4 V good relations with H.M.G. in no better way than by disposing satisfactorily of this long-standing question. As regards (a) of his telegram the Ambassador might simply be referred to the telegram being sent to the Resident. As regards (c) and (d) we note that the I&amp;nbassy merely say it would be ’’profitless” to do anything until (a) can be tackled. Fowle comments on this in paragraphs 3 and 4 of his telegram of the 14th December and we feel there is seme force in his comments (though his reference to international practice may not necessarily be valid). We cannot in any case see what harm could be done by action on the lines proposed in Foreign Office telegram No.279, and f there would always be a chance of the I Iraqi Government accepting the suggestion I to try out a frontier committee in connection with the incidents at present under investigation. We would therefore suggest that you should conclude your OUaA. /Wt- reply to dal onsl FowLe by urging him once more, if only because it could hardly do any harm and might do good, to act on the lines indicated in Foreign Office telegram No.279.

Moreover, in view of Iraqi Government's apparently forthcoming attitude, it may be unnecessary to broach smuggling question simultaneously as proposed in your telegram No. 296.

Unless you see strong objection, therefore, please take action accordingly. 2. I agree that it would be most undesirable for establishment of frontier committee and commencement of demarcation (if agreed upon) to await detailed agreement on anti-smuggling proposals which will obviously take time.

SMUGGLING '.VITH IRAQ . (a) News was received and confirmed on 20th December that another large band of land smugglers was recently rounded up by an Iraq Patrolling Police force close to the southern shore of the Hamar lake, and all their goods caotured. (b) It appears that the smugglers were as usual tribesmen hailing from Iraq, and that they formed an initial secret dump in the Dibdibba region of the desert some sixty miles west of Kuwait - about 10th December they apparently hired camels from the Bedouin and sent their goods across the Kuwait border in the direction of Iraq. The camel men with some 140 camels proceeded to Khashaim Zaiyid, a spot on the southern shore of the Hamar Lake. (This is same place where thefirst round-up took place in October last) and began to unload the smugglers’ goods there on night of 13/14th December. (c) Whilst doing this they were suddenly attacked by an Iraq Police Patrol. The camel men at once fled losing 10 cameli killed in the dark and all the cargo. (d) Next morning pursuing police cars came up with 80 camels which were going south, in the vicinity of Rumaila and captured the lot, one of the party, an ANOUZE, admitting that it was they who had been engaged in carrying the goods captured, the previous night. (e) The remaining 60 camels which had been engaged in the attempt, and which with their owners had scattered in the night, got away. (f) The men captured with 80 camels, it is said, numbered 20, and were all men of the Amaze and Dhafir tribe, except for2 , / 2.82) 1 Rashldi and 1 Mutairi tribesmen, who owed allegiance to Kuwait. (g) The actual owners of the rt stuff” (all Iraqis) were not it seems with the caravan when it was rounded up but had gone ahead to await the party's arrival with Ballams which had been sent to convey the cargo across the Hamar Lake. (h) The goods it seems were destined for the Town of Medina near Kurna, from which place hailed the owners of the cargo. (i) The above smart piece of work on the part of the Iraq Police deserves special commendation,and will deal a second paralysing blow at the smuggling fraternity, who as reported in my last Summary are in moribund condition, and at their wits’ end to know how to circumvent the very active efforts that are now in force to trap them. The Shaikh has expressed his delight in no uncertain terms at this fresh coup on the part of the Iraq Police.CONFIDENTIAL . No. 21-S of 1936.

(a) The anti-smuggling activities of the Iraq G-overnment continue to he most successful, and the Euphrates smuggling fraternity are having a very poor time indeed now. (b) The writer estimates that smuggling into Iraq has now been reduced by quite 80 &gt;- t of its former figure, since Yasin Pasha decided to take the strong measures he has done on the Kuwait frontier. (c) The Shaikh on 14th December again expressed himself to the writer as most gratified with the state of affairs, and triumphantly pointed out that what he had advocated many months ago as being the one and only solution for the evil, had practically ^scotched' the smuggling already, and after only some two months of serious effort. He opined that if the present methods were continued and not allowed to slacken off, the trouble would be settled for good. The Shaikh pointed out also that the effort as far as numbers of men and guards were employed, was remarkably small, and must be costing the Iraq Government scarcely anything, which entirely belied the previous statements of certain Iraqi politicians, that to successfully stop smuggling from Kuwait, would cost a fortune, and necessitate a strong cordon of troops along the- frontier. As far as one can see no troops at all are being used and the v/hole successful business is being managed by a few smart Customs preventive police equipped with 4 Ford armed cars and wireless Ford Car, and two Ford lorries for accommodating escorts. It is the excellent methods employed and the fact that the smugglers now know that the Iraq Government is at long last taking serious steps on the frontier that have so successfully done the trick.Copy.

Bushire. the 11th UoTember 1935. From The Hon*ble Lieut.-Colonel T.C.Fowle. C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. To His Majesty t s Secretary of State for India, The India Office, London, S.W. 1# V KUWAIT - * IRAQ. SMUGGLING . Sir, I have the honour to refer to Mr. Batemans despatch No.527 of 2nd October to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. 2. The present juncture appears to be a favourable one for summarising briefly the subject of Kuwait - ’Iraq Smuggling as dealt with in the numerous despatches and telegrams which in the course of the last three years and more have been exchanged between the various authorities concerned. It is common ground that under International Law and practice the Shaikh of Kuwait has the undoubted right to refuse cooperation in anti-smuggling measures with the ’Iraq Government,who are responsible for carrying out such measures as they think fit. 3* His Majesty’s Government however, considered it of considerable importance that the Shaikh should in practice afford cooperation for the following main reasons* (a) to exercise a good effect on the ’Iraq Government who- 2 - who regarded Kuwait as under our influence, and looked to us to exert this influence in order that the question might be settled in an amicable manner* (b) To preserve amicable relations between Kuwait and •Iraq* (c) To avoid the possibility of complications between these two States into which His Majesty^ Government might be dragged. His Majesty’s Government considered for instance, that if Kuwait were to suffer severely from what ever anti-smuggling measures ’Iraq might adopt they - His Maj -sty• s Government — would be compelled eventually to inter vene on behalf of Kuwait* 4. The measures which His Majesty’s Government considered the Shaikh should take were in the nature of an effective check in some form or other (various schemes were explored at various times) on the export of goods by land and sea from Kuwait. 5. The Shaikh, while accepting a measure of cooperat ion by sea (the smuggling on which was carried out by Kuwaitis) was unwilling to cooperate with the ’Iraq Government on land - where the smugglers were practically all •Iraqis, and where by far the greater volume of smuggling took place. He raised various objections to the various schemes put forward, amongst others that his giving effect to some of them would affect his sovereign rights. His main reason, however, for refusing cooperation was as follows. .Vhether Kuwait trade wifch ’Iraq qas stopped by (*) the t Iraii3 at the frontier or (2) by himself at Kuwait, Kuwait would of course suffer. if his subjects Suffered under (l) they WC ' 1 naturaliy hDld him fr ee of any responsibility in the matter.3 3c©) matter* If, however, they suffered under (2) they would hold him responsible, and he would become the object of considerable unpopularity which might result in more or less serious internal troubles* 6 * The Shaikh explained that provided the ’Iraq Government, in whatever anti-smuggling measures they adopted, kept within the law (the ’Iraqi customs officials have been guilty from time to time of highhanded and illegal acts in Kuwait territory and territorial waters) he certainly would not expect His Majesty’s Government to intervene on his behalf* 7* His Majesty’s Government, however, in spite of these arguments were generally of opinion that n pres sure 1 * should be applied to the Shaikh to induce him to cooperate* 8 * Taking the above situation as it appeared to me I held, and hold, the following views most strongly* It is of course very desirable that the question should be settled amicably between the two States, but as a first point British interests are not directly concernedt if British goods intended for ’Iraq cannot enter Kuwait they w&amp;ll be taken to Basra* For His Majesty’s Government to bring •pressure * 1 to bear on the Shaikh in order to induce him to cooperate would have a most unfortunate effect on the Ruler himself, his subjects, generally throughout the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, and probably further afield in other Arab countries of the Middle East, whose Press in these days takes considerable interest in this part of the world* However excellent the intentions of His Majesty’s Government might be this action would give the impression to Arab public opinion that we were pressing hard a small state Which was under our protection in the interest, of a large*.- 4 7m @) laxgcr state which was not. Moreover in the last resort •preasure** would mean a direct order to the Shaikh from His Maje 8 ty # s Government to fall in with their views, and if he refused (as I thought from the strength of his feelings on the subject was extremely likely) I did not see how His Majesty^ Government proposed to enforce this order, and a deplorable situation would then be brought about between the Shaikh and His Majesty’s Government. I felt also that there was considerable weight in the Shaikh’s arguments touched on in the last sentence of paragraph 5 above, and pointed out that should the Shaikh give way under our 'pressure* 1 , and should feeling in Kuwait turn against him, the responsibility for the consequences would - at any rate to a large extent - be His Majesty’s Government’s. 9. With regard to the argument put forward in para graph 3(c) above. My views were that any blockade which might be initiated by the ’Iraq Government was on an entirely different footing to the Saudi blockade, since His Majesty’s Government had no respondibility whatsoever with regard to the former, but had given a definite assurance to the Shaikh that they would do their best to get the latter removed. In view moreover of the Shaikh’s definite state ment given in paragraph 6 above, I did not see how His Majesty’s Government could be compelled to interfere on his behalf if the 1 Iraq Government actually instituted this blockade. 10. In view of these condiderations I urged His %jesty f s Government that our approach to the Shaikh on the 't subject should not proceed beyond 'strong advice', which if disregarded would place the responsibility for the consequences entirely5 entirely on hinu In deference to my views His Majesty*s Govern* ment (vide p&amp;ragrapli 4 of India Office telegram Ho* 724 of 6 th March 1935 to me) concurred* Sometime later both His Excellency the Ambassador (vide my telegram Ho*512 of 15th June 1935) and the Government of India (vide their telegram Ho* 1492 of June 6 th» 1935) concurred generally in my views* 11* The Shaikh then proceeded to England last June for medical treatment, and opportunity was taken of his presence in London for him to have conversations with the India and Foreign Offices the result of which is detailed in India Office Printed Letter Ho*P*2.4923/35, dated 19th July 1935. Briefly the Shaikh was persuaded by His Majesty f s Government to the extent of instituting a manifest system for goods leaving by land for •Iraq as well as by sea* The further proposal of a British Customs Director, however, he definitely refused to consider* 12* The measure of copperation which the Shaikh is willing to give has now been placed before the *Iraq Government (vide paragraph 3 of Mr* Bateman*s despatch) who are of opinion that it does not go far enough, and are therefore instituting measures to curtail, and if possible to end altogether smuggling from Kuwait* 13* With regard to these measures* The •Iraq Government have always made great play wi th the considerable expense which they would be put to in instituting anti smuggling measures* As long ago as Hovember 1934 I pointed out (vide paragraph 6 (a) of my letter Ho*l046-S, dated 20th November 1934) that they could quite well commence operations- 6 3°f operations with active patrola of a few cars carrying machine guns, and armed crews, the maintainence of which would cost little, and that if these measures were not effective they could try more extensive ones# His Majesty^ Government thought this suggestion a reasonable one (vide paragraph 4 of telegram No.47 dated 9th February 1935 from His Majesty^s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty’s Ambassador, Bagdad)# The measures which the ’Iraq Government have now instituted, as detailed in paragraph 6 of Mr. Bateman’s despatch, and from information which I received in Kuwait, appear to be precisely those which I suggested could be adopted# The Iraqi Government moreover (vide Yasin Pasha’s conversation with Mr. Bateman) are of opinion that these measures are proving extremely effective# This view is confirw raed from what I heard in Kuwait from Colonel Dickson. According to the latter* s information t he capture of the smuggling caravan described in paragraph 178 of Kuwait Intellig ence Summary No. 15, has had a most salutary effect. As far as the Shaikh is concerned, far from being upset at the success * of the •Iraqi anti-smuggling activities, he appears to be positively relieved, since their efficiency presumably precludes any further representations to him from His Majesty’s Govern ment on the subject of cooperation regarding which his feelings are as strong as ever# 14* I cannot help feeling that the course of events so far has justified the attitude which I have taken up with regard to this question. His Majesty’s Government having relinquished the policy of 'pressure'on the Shaikh t© cooperate with ’Iraq, have done all that was practible tn the circumstances by giving him7 (3o%) him 'strong adYice** This adYice he has only adopted in • s- part (vide paragraph 11 above) and the responsibility for the consequences is therefore entirely his* The f Iraq Government have in consequence instituted certain anti-smuggl ing measures which are eeonomical and efficacious* The Shaikh on his side in quite content to face these measures provided always that the 1 Iraq Government keep within the law- an assurance on which point has been given hy them (vide first sentence of pi ragraph 6 of Mr* Bateman^ despatch)* 15# With regard to paragraph 8 of Mr* Bateman's despatch* The repereussions in Bagdad of the latest developments of the smuggling question are of course outside my sphere f but I venture to give it as my personal opinion that our case with the 'Iraq Government in the event, as Mr* Bateman suggests, of our hearing further from them is an excellent one* The Shaikh, as we have informed them more than once, is an independent Sovereign in special treaty relations with us* In the present instance there was nothing in these treaties in particular, or in international law in general, to compel him to cooperate, and His Majesty's Government therefore took the only steps open to them by giv ing certain advice which the Shaikh did not adopt* The 'Iraq Government must therefore follow the example of all other Governments in the world, (more particularly of those governments which - like 'Iraq - choose to erect high tariff barriers) and institute effective enti-smuggling measures* (In point of fact they have already done this)* On his side the Shaikh must take the consequences of the measures* (He is in fact quite prepared to do so)* If the case had been different, if it had been a matter of the 'Iraq Government from demanding some action qedjafceigoel&amp;lie Shaikh under some article ofcl tit *qo U-j y;I«sD s ^ $oivh&amp; eixiT ^eotYh® %ciot&gt;&amp; 8* zid 701 ^llidifi^c]8«ac 94£ baja (evods XX 4^'ia^7^q &amp;bi?) t7aq ' ^*xl* tti?

Ministry for Foreign Affairs, r Bagdad, 12th November, 1935• The Ministry for Foreign Affairs present their compliments ^ to His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy, Bagdad, and, with reference to the Embassy’s note No, 422 dated 20th August, 1935, have the honour to explain to the esteemed Embassy that it appears, from careful enquiries undertaken by the ’Iraqi authorities concerned, that motor launches of the 'Iraqi Customs and Excise Department did not cross over to Kuwait waters- The Ministry wish to remind the esteemed Embassy of their exposition, contained in their note No. C/1501 dated 25th August, 1934, of the position of ’Iraqi Customs motor launches, and in particular of the contents of paragraph 3 of the note in question explaining orders Issued prohibiting the crossing over to Kuwait waters and imposing heavy punishment on any official acting in contravention of the said orders. The Ministry assure the esteemed Embassy that ’Iraqi Customs and Excise officials are very strictly complying with orders issued to them, and are unlikely to venture upon any contravention thereof. It therefore appears that the complaint of ’Abdullah al Fawadiri &lt; nd his companions is not biased on actual facts, but was a natural consequence to the legitimate measures adopted within ’Iraqi territory for the prohibition of smuggling and the pursuit of smugglers - measures which no doubt hamper the ac ivities of smugglers who consequently attempt to seek relief from their effects by putting forward such complaints. The Ministry avail themselves of this opportunity to express their highest consideration and esteem. His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy, Bagdad.‘ \ 3 \\ Notes. Register No. \ V % Ihr SECRET.

It will he seen from the Baghdad despatch dated ?th October, which is now- submitted, that the Iraqi Government have definitely decided that the Sheikh’s offer to set up a manifest system for goods travelling overland is not an adequate basis ttnJr for further negotiations, and put into force a rigorous preventive system against smuggling. This is definitely disappointing, but in view of the steadfast refusal of the Sheikh of Koweit to appoint a British Director, which was one of the things that has been considered essential by the Iraq Government, and 3330 1000 12.34 was/* 4 ' was indeed pressed on the Sheikh hy His Majesty^ Government, it is not perhaps altogether surprising. It seems clear that there is no more to he done. It is a pity that the Baghdad Embassy have been so Inke warm in pressing the matter on the Iraq Government, but even if they had been more warm in their support it is perhaps unlikely that the extremely hostile attitude of the Iraq Government generally to the Sheikh would have failed to prevail. Mr. Bateman reports that he understand the measures to be taken by the Iraq Government are to be merely preventive, and that strict instructions have been given that there shall be no incursions into Koweit territory. He has also 'heard of no steps by the Iraqi Government calculated to interfere with the water supply of Koweit'. It has all along been recognised that His Majesty’s Government could not prevent the Iraq Government setting up a preventive service, or indeed practically instituting a blockade, which appears to be what they intend. Indeed, the Sheikh himself has .always accepted this as quite legitimate. His Majesty’s Government, however, always felt that it would be incumbent on them 4m\. to do their best to prevent the Iraq Government criifeiwg 7 interfering with the Sheikh’s revenues from his date gardens, or with his water supply. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, in his telegram of the r'fVty^said he proposed to make a communication to the Iraqi Government (at a time when it seemed that action by them was imminent) to make clear His Majesty’s Government’s position in the matter.

JUGGLING WITH IHAC, . One has much pleasure in recording the following very satisfactory case of a caravan from Jahara (origin of goods Kuwait) being rounded up and captured by Iraq irregulars under Shaikh Muttashar the son of Ajemi Pasha as Sadun, assisted by Iraq Preventive Police on or about the dnd September. The incident gave great satisfaction to the Shaikh when he heard about it on his return from Europe, and greatly encourages one to hope that at long last the Iraq Government have decided to adopt serious and fair measures to tackle the smuggling problem by the employment of Bedouin and police, working on the Iraq side of the frontier: The incident in question occurred on the southern shore of the Kammar Lake in Iraq, between Ghabishiyeh and Aluwi Hailway stations, and is briefly as follows: (Facts obtained from one of those who took part, and from an official report furnished by the Deputy Huler to the writer)- (a) A dump of sugar, coffee, tea and other minor articles, had been secretly formed west of Jahara by a certain band of smugglers, and was at the end of August moved forward across the Iraq frontier, by camels working in fours and fives, so as not to attract attention. (b) On the day selected for the venture the smugglers loaded up 2GC camels (on the Iraq side of the frontier) formed a convoy and proceeded to the South end of the Hamar Lake where marsh men in ' , mas-hoofs ,, were in readiness to take the goods over. (c) The smugglers were a mixed lot, and consisted of Sham ar, Jhafir, Hashaida and Ilutair elements (tne Hashaida being Kuwait subjects).S&amp;*jf - 8 - (d) The venture appears to have been a private one, and payment was to be by results, but if cargo was captured the Bedouin escort were not to be held responsible. (e) When nearing the Hamar Lake the c aravan broke up into two parties of ICC camels each. (f) The first party got as far as a place called 'Khashm Zaid n when it was suddenly fired upon by about ICO irregulars and desert Police assisted by 3 armoured cars (it is said). The surprise was complete. The first party of camels and goods were captured but the second party dropped their loads and made off in the darkness. In other words all the cargo was taken but only 96 camels. (g) Humour says that 5 of the smugglers were killed in the first volley, but according to one of the smugglers (a Mutairi) whom I secretly interviewed, one Hashidi only was killed, None were captured. (h) of the captured camels 3 are said to have died of wounds and 93 were brought to Zubair ana sold for I.D.151 to a merchant named Rashid al Lilhirn. The latter who is supposed to be in with various smuggling organizations is reported to have secretly sold the camels back to their respective Bedouin owners and at cost price.Dated Dec. 193 Date.

I SEEN c POLITICAL COWWlTTEtt 23 SEP 1935 Previous 'payers :— Koyieit-Iraa Smuggling Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. Please see submission at P.Z, 4140/35' H.M.G. aimed at a solution of the smuggling problem on a basis of the establishment of a system of manifests for goods exported from Koweit to Iraq both by land and sea, and the appointment of a British Director of Customs at Koweit to work in close collaboration with a Customs Preventive cordon on the Koweit frontier, to be established by the Iraq Government. 2. The Sheikh of Koweit rejected these proposals, and our telegram of £3rd June at P.Z. 4140/35, was sent in a last minute effort to persuade the Sheikh, before he left Koweit for his holiday in this country, to modify his ir attitude, and^agree^f to the Conference suggested by H.M.G. to be attended by £&amp;• Koweiti, Iraqi and/ 3643 1000 3.352 . and British representatives on the basis of the proposals mentioned above. The result of our telegrem of 23rd June, was that the Sheikh, without committing himself to H.M.G.’s proposals, asked for an opportunity of discussing the smuggling problem at the India Office on his arrival in London. A meeting attended by representatives of the Foreign Office and the India Office was accordingly held here with the Sheikh on 15th July, and a record of the discussion at the meeting will be found at P.Z. 4923/35. The Sheikh was persuaded at the meeting to agree to the establishment of a system of manifests for goods exported by land as well as CustomsTs^elfniv^rked under his direct control, and •we ape, in his view, of sufficient standing and capacity to deal efficiently with the issue of manifests, etc. H.M.G. considered that the Sheikh’s acceptance at the meeting of a system of manifests for goods exported by land, represented a substantial advance on his previous attitude, ana the Foreign Office accordingly telegraphed to instructing the Ambassador, unless he saw the strongest objection, to approach the Iraq Government and endeavour to secure their acceptance of an arrangement on the lines now agreed to by the Sheikh, the details of which could be worked out later. The action taken by the Ambassador on receipt of this telegram is reported in Sir A. Clark Kerr’s telegra m of the 27th July (P.i. 5261/35)• 3 It will be seen that the Ambassador did not feel able to press the Iraqi Minister for Foreign by sea, although he continued to maintain his refusal to consider the_ appointment of a British Affairs/(3Z2) 3436 b 5000 1.35 Minute Paper. Department. f.2.^44 5r 3. Affairs to recommend the acceptance of the Sheikh’s proposals. It appears that Sir A. Clark Kerr rtferottoa the Sheikh’s acceptance*. the Customs Director Iks an essential element in any successful scheme of co-operation, hut in his telegram he also refers hack to a telegram of the 19th February from Sir Francis Humphreys, the late Ambassador, which advocated a quota system for goods imported into Koweit, a proposal which has since been rejected by H.M.G. as quite unacceptable. The Ambassador also felt unable to associate H.M.G. with a the Sheikh's latest proposals, regarding these as half v measures which dad not promise success, and arguing that H.M.G. would be placed in an invidious position in the event of their failure to produce a satisfactory solution. I do not feel that this is really a valid argument. This is surely a case where a partial solution is better than no solution at all, and the Iraq Government’s acceptance of the present proposals would not necessarily preclude them from asking for something more, if these proposals, after being given a fair trial, were found not to work satisfactorily in practice. The presentation of the Sheikh's latest proposals to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, has at least had the effect of postponing the institution of the threatened ^/blockade of Koweit. (P.Z. 5246/35). If The Iraqi Government have not yet expressed their views on the Sheikh’s proposals, and it will be seen from the Baghdad despatch of 20th August now received, that according to Yasin Pasha, the Prime Minister, iiuri Pasha failed to pass on to the other members of the Iraqi Government/*r._: pi 4. Government, the memorandum containing these proposals which had been communicated to him by the Ambassador on the abth July last. Yasin Pasha has now been given a copy of the memorandum, and the matter is under consideration by the Council of Ministers, but it seems most improbable, particularly in view of the lack of support of the Embassy, that their reaction will be at all favourable. The position will have to be reconsidered by H.M.G. when the . . . T Iraqi Government reaches a decision. N fy The second half of the Baghdad despatch of 30th * August deals with the recent case of turingement of Koweit territorial waters by the Iraqi customs launch from Fao, which has been subject of a protest to the Iraqi Government There have been several previous cases where the Fao customs launch was reported to have violated Koweitc. waters, and in the circumstances it seems that the Embassy would have been justified in talcing a much stronger line ■K with the Iraq Government than they have done in the rather mild note of which a copy is enclosed in the despatch.

I asked for and was promised an expression of the viev/s of the Iraqi Government. I did not feel able to pre ss the Minister for Foreign - Affairs to recommend the acceptance of the Sheikh 1 s proposals for the following reasons: (1) Similar proposals were rejected by British advisers in February last for good reasons (see Sir Francis Humphrys 1 telegram No. 47o) (2) The appointment of a competent customs controller at Koweit had hitherto been regarded by all concerned except the Sheikh as essential for the success of any scheme of co-operation. (5) In view of (1) above, I was loath to associate His Majesty 7 s Government with half measures which do not promise * success for the reasons given in paragraph 8 of my despatch No. 198. &lt; i r~ Minister for Foreign Affairs has proposed to Iraq Government that future cases where infringements of Npweit frontier are alleged against Iraqi preventive forces should be investigated by the British President of the Basra Court of Sessions. By this means he hopes to obtain impartial and reliable reports on which Iraqi Government could take action.

H.M.G. had had long experience in dealing with similar questions, and he instanced the case or illegal smuggling into the U.S.A. as a case where one country (Ii.iM.G-.) had agreed to help another country (the U.S.A.) to stop smuggling by instituting a system of manifests and by(35?) allowing- British vessels to be searohea lor contraband outside /American territorial waters, altnougn H.M.u 45 aihe ho weio, nad been under no legal obligation to do sc. The friendly attitude adopted by H.M.l. had been much appreciated by the U.S.Government and had had a generally beneficial effect on the relations between them and H.m.G. '.That suggested was that his nxcelleiicy should follow their example in this case, and take an equally broad and farsighted point of view, and that he should in his own interests cooperate with Iraq, rather than rush into a quarrel which might have much mere serious consequences than were apparent at present. They did not suggest that the Sheikh should give up any of his rights or independence, but that he should take certain steps voluntarily. He quite realised that any measures oaken by His Excellency to check smuggling would involve financial losses to his people, but it was better to cooperate with Iraq in suppressing smuggling and thus preserve legitimate trade rather than be subjected to an Iraqi blockade which would put an end to all trade of any kind. Ill. LklTHvlilT E said that it was understood that the Sheikh had intimated to Colonel Dickson, at his last interview before leaving koweit, that he had certain counter proposals to make on this subject and would be interested to know what these were. mH- S-IEIKH 01 HOTEIT said that there was really no analogy between the position of Howe it and the question of illegal smuggling into the U.S.A. mentioned by Mr. Rend el. Howe it had no cultivation nor industry, nor anything else to provide a living for her people except the trade which she was at present able to carry on. King Abdul Aziz had stopped smuggling across his borders himself and Persia had also taken certain measures, and so could the Iraq Government if they wanted to do so. It was impossible for His Excellency himself to do it for them, and he did not see why he should accept a responsibility which was really theirs. Vf\O • 1^. HSKDEL said that Iraq could certainly prevent the smuggling, but that if the Iraq Government did this in their own way and took similar measures to those talien by King Abdul Aziz, it would be very serious for Koweit. THE SrZIEil said that he was quite prepared to accept what the Saudis had done. He was also prepared to help the Iraq Government against smuggling by sea by instituting a manifest system, but by land the Iraq Government must take their own measures. ILn. LAIlBh'AlTE said that Kis Excellency 1 s offer to institute a system of manifests by sea was much appreciated. The Iraq Government had however emphasised that their real difficulties were by land. He asked whether His Excellency might not be prepared also to institute a manifest system by land as well as by sea, on the assumption that the Iraq Government on their side would establish, say, four Iraqi Customs posts on the frontier through which trade could be canalised. He emphasised that the India Office were most anxious to safeguard Koweit in this matter. THE SHEIKH pointed out that the difficulty on land was that Koweit supplied goods to several countries and that there were several routes leading from Koweit. If a man wished to take goods to Iraq he might say that he was going not to Iraq but, for example, to Syria, and it was quite impossible to say whether he was telling the truth or not.4. MR. LAITHWAITE said that a person leaving Koweit by land would have to pass either through Saudi Arabia or Iraq. Saudi Arabia was not at the moment in question. Under the manifest system suggested a person would be required, if he went to Iraq, to cross the frontier at one of the four Customs posts, to have with him a manifest for any dutiable goods which he carried and to pay the appropriate duty to Iraq v/hether his ultimate destination was Syria or not. The Sheikh’s responsibility would have been discharged by the issue of the manifest. THE SHEIKH said that in that case he was quite willing to give manifests to all those who passed out of Koweit en route to Iraq. The manifest would state tne quantities of the goods carried, but would not mention the route to be travelled, or the point at which the frontier would be crossed, since the Koweit authorities could not be responsible for the actual route that tne man might take. His Excellency agreed, however, with a suggestion by Mr.Ward that the manifest might also state that it was given 'for Iraq', but he said he knew that no one going to Iraq would ever tell the truth as to his destination, or take out a manifest, since little or no profit could be made if customs duty had to be paid at the Iraq frontier. His Excellency agreed, however that if any man were caught by the Iraq authorities carrying goods without a manifest, the man himself would be held responsible and would have to take the consequenc es. MR. LAITHWAITE said that an arrangement such as that suggested by the Sheikh would be of great value, and that his//v &lt;g&gt; 3 5. his offer of it was much appreciated by H.M.G. -h fhv agreed. He added that the details of the system would require working out and that it would have co be put to the Iraq Government. The idea was that there should be, as it were, gates in the Iraq frontier, for the passage Q-c legitimate trade, and that any merchandise not going through these gates would be sto^rped by the Iraq authorities. It would be better to have a wall with gates than a wall without any opening at all. enquired whether His Excellency had any organised customs service at present which would be capable of issuing manifests. A responsible official would be necessary to issue manifests not only for Iraq but also for Saudi Arabia (if a solution of the question of the Saudi blockade were reached on the basis suggested by the Sheikh of Customs posts and manifests) and also, once the Kuwait Oil Company commenced operations, to deal with imports b- ic. His Excellency said that he already had at Koweit two special Customs officials, one for trade by sea and one foi trade by land who worked under his direct control, and were persons of sufficient authority and standing to issue such manifests. ME- HALTOH reverted to the question of the counter proposal which the Sheikh was said to have mentioned to Colonel Dickson at Koweit. H.M.G. had understood from the latter T s report that His Excellency in discussion of the matter in London might be able to make some counter o.ixer as an alternative to the Iraqi intention to impose a blockade. His Excellency had now accepted Mr.Laithwart e l s suggestion in regard to manifests but had he not some further/ o&gt;(3&lt;o\) 6 . vurthcr propooc.1 oi his own to make? Ti-E SHEIKH said that he had no fiirther suggestions to make, hut that he was prepared to accept the manifest system if the Iraq Government wanted it. Colonel Dickson and Colonel Fowle had referred to the appointment of a British Customs Director hy H.M.G., for which he saw no necessity. MR. LAITFvYAITE suggested that if Koweit had a British Customs Director it would be easier to work with the Iraq Government, who had British Customs experts themselves, and easier to convince the Iraqis that Koweit was really prepared to cooperate than if the Sheikh only had Customs officials with purely local experience. He emphasised that the Director would be the Sheikh’s servant, appointed not by H.M.G. but by His Excellency himself. H.M.G. in making this suggestion had been solely concerned with Koweit interests. MR. RENDEL added that the British Customs officials in Iraq had been able to help Iraq trade a great deal. Several independent States, for example Siam, employed British officials and it would be no reflection on the Sheikh’s independence if he- did so. THE SHEIKH said that Koweit, which derived its Customs revenue from the trade at one port only, could not afford to pay for such a Customs Director, but MR.LAITHWAITE reminded His Excellency that Iraq had offered to pay the cost. His Excellency expressed his dislike of having at Koweit an official paid by the Iraq Government, but MR. IA1THWAITE said that though Iraq might provide the money, there would be no question but that the Director would bo in His Excellency’s own service and that he need not bo paid by the Iraq Government direct. The/7. The source of the payment need not be known. HIS 3XCELLEhCY then said that he would not mind paying the Director himself. It was not a question of money. What he objected to was the proposal itself, and ho did not see the necessity for it since smuggling could be stopped without it. The Iraq Government could take the same measures themselves as Ibn Saud had done. MR. LA I TEv ; /A ITE said that this might lead to very serious complications which H.M.G. wore most anxious to avoid. H.M.G.&gt; however, much appreciated the suggestions which His Excellency had now made for a settlement and as the Sheikh was reluctant to agree to the appointment of a British Customs Director, they would make a further attempt to reach a settlement with Iraq on the basis of those suggestions.8. (2) Sheikh of Koweit's Date Gardens in Iraq . HIS EXCELLENCY reminded the meeting of the pledge which H.M.G. had given him in 1914 that his lands in Iraq would be preserved for himself and his successors and that they should be free from all taxation. He explained that the Iraq Government had imposed a tax on the produce of the land exported from Iraq, but that this tax was not being paid by the exporters themselves but had had to be defrayed for the last few years out of his own pocket. His Excellency had given details of his expenses to Colonel Dickson, but nothing had yet been done by H.M.G. MR, LAITHWAITE said that H.M.G. had fought hard to reach a settlement with the Iraq Government both on the question of the Sheikh’s title to his lands and on the question of taxation and would continue to do so. Mr.Rended added that he had talked to Huri Pasha on the important question of title a few days ago and had impressed upon him the importance of settling this matter quickly. Huri Pasha had premised to attend to it on his return to Bagdad.9. (3) Saudi Blockade of KoTYeit. THE SHEIKH said that in 1929 he had received a letter from H.M.G. concerning his trade with hejd, promising that if His Excellency would prevent help heing given to Eaisal al Duwish, H.M.G. would endeavour to reach a solution of his trade difficulties with King Abdul Aziz. His Excellency had carried out his part and had even fought with Al Duwish’s people, but H.M.G., for their part, had as yet failed to make any progress towards a solution of the blockade. A Saudi deputation of 83 persons had recently visited Koweit, but His Excellency thought that no good had come of the conference which had taken place. MR .LAITriHAITE said that for some time H.M.G. had been trying hard to reach a solution of the blockade question with King Abdul Aziz, and that, as the Sheikh would remember the proposal for a conference regarding it, which had now materialised, had originated with the late Sir Hugh Siscoe. He reminded the Sheikh that matters had been held up for more than a year owing to a misunderstanding about certain correspondence between His Excellency and the King of Saudi Arabia. After briefly recalling the proceedings at the recent Conference at Koweit, he said that H.M.G. regarded it as satisfactory that the Saudi delegation had gone so far as agreeing even on the principle of a. system of manifests and Customs posts. H.M.G. entirely agreed that the Saudi demand for a guarantee as a condition of agreement on this basis, that not a single Koweit smuggler would cross the frontier was quite unreasonable. The India Office and10. $3 Foreign Office had already made strong representations to Fuad Bey Hamza regarding this guarantee in which they had emphasised that Kovv r eit was however prepared to give an honourable undertaking to do all in its power to suppress smuggling. They would continue to do their utmost for Koweit in the matter. HR. REKDEL said that only that morning he had again spoken to Fuad Bey Hamza and that Fuad Bey hah telegraphed on the subject to King Abdul Aziz. His Excellency expressed thanks to H.M.G. for the action which they had taken.Chief Local Representative of Kuwait Gil Company. (4) Finally THE SKEIKH said that he understood that Colonel Dickson, the Political Agent at Koweit, was due to retire in February 1936 and that in that event he would like Colonel Dickson to be the Chief Local Representative of the Kuwait Oil Company, in which capacity Colonel Dickson would be of the greatest assistance to His Excellency in view of his experience of Koweit and his fluent knowledge of Arabic. He added that the matter was one in which he would regard an affirmative decision as a favour to himself personally, and that he trusted that H.M.G. would be able to meet him regarding it. His Excellency was informed that his proposal had already been reported to H.II.G. by the Political Resident and that it was at present under consideration by them. Full weight would be given to his remarks regarding it.Prom secretary o£ state i’or ,Poreign affaire To H.M. Bagdad. Repeated political Resident, Busdire. political Agent, Koweit.

On the other hand, the Sheikh of koweit had now announced his intention of coming to England for the sake of his health and was expected to arrive very shortly - probably about July 8 th. It had been arranged that the whole question should be discussed with him on his arrival and that he should be very strongly advised to reconsider the question of reaching some agreement with Iraq on this matter. I therefore hoped that the Iraqi Government would not take any action of too drastic a character at any rate until we had had a chance of discussing matters further with the Sheikh. Meanwhile, however, the Iraqi Government were of course perfectly free, as they always had been, to taJca any legitimate measures on their own territory against smuggling from z;oweit, e.g. by the establishment of a chain of frontier posts, etc. 4 . Nuri pasha said that if It were only a question of a /comparativelycomparatively short delay he saw no objection to deferring drastic action until His Majesty*s Government should have had an opportunity of speaking to the Sheikh, as regards the action to prevent smuggling, the trouble was that the British authorities in the Gulf brought unfounded accusations against the Iraqi Government of violating Koweiti territory, when they had not in fact done so. In the case of one incident, for instance, the Iraqis had offered that the British judge at Basra should go to the spot to decide whether they had or had not violated Koweiti territory, but the matter had not been pursued. Huri pasha was satisfied that no violation of koweiti territory had occurred. I said that I could not discuss this point as I had not got the facts before me. I was not referring to disputed cases of this kind, but to ordinary anti-smuggling measures on undisputed Iraqi territory. To these of course there could be no possible objection. 5. The matter was not further pursued, but I got the Impression that the Iraqis certainly mean to take very severe measures against the Sheikh if ho does not do something to help to discourage the kowelti smuggling trade, but that they are prepared to wait a month or so on the chance of our being able to bring the Sheikh to reason meanwhile.

The second telegram (No .557 of 24th June) repeats a telegram from Koweit reporting Colonel Dickson’s interview with the Sheikh at midnight on Sunday. As we anticipated the Sheikh’s reaction was not very encouraging, but paragraph (c) of the telegram suggests that there is still seme faint chance that he may be prepared to compromise with Iraq on this question. The Sheikh asks that H.M.G. should hold up final orders to the Ambassador at Bagdad (i.e. in regard to the reply to be given to the Iraqi Government) until the Sheikh arrives in London on 4th July', accepts the (Iraqi) blockade; or, can satisfy Iraq by some counter offer. It seems most desirable/desirable that the door should be kept open a little longer for an amicable solution of this question while any hope of it still remains, and I understand from the Foreign Office that they entirely agree with this view and are prepared to instruct the Onbassy to postpone informing the Iraq Government that the Sheikh has rejected the Conference proposals until we have had an opportunity of discussing the matter further with the Sheikh in London. On the other hand the Foreign Office are now most anxious to send some reply to the Embassy at once. The Iraqis have been pressing the Embassy for the Sheikas answer to the proposals for a Conference, and the Embassy have been placed in a most embarrassing position owing to their inability to reply. The Foreign Office are, I understand, sending us over a draft telegram to Bagdad explaining the position and authorising the Ambassador if necessary to give an interim reply to the Iraqis to the effect that H.M.G. have had some difficulty in persuading the Sheikh to agree to the Conference,but that it is proposed to discuss the matter further with the Sheikh as soon as he arrives in London on 4th July., (3% ^ FOREIGN OFFICE, June 1935. i/ ^ • j / Sir A.

In the course of a long conversation with me yesterday evening Nuri Pasha adverted to this question. He said that he thought that the Iraqi point of view had never been properly represented to us. The Iraqi Government did not in the least wish to oblige the Sheikh of Koweit to take any particular measures, though they greatly resented the support which they were convinced that he was secretly giving to the smuggling organisations. All that they wanted was to have a free hand to deal with the smuggling in their own way. Recently an incident had occurred where some smugglers had been killed and the Iraqis had been accused of violating Koweiti territory. This was not the case, and the Iraqi Government had offered to send a British official down to verify the facts, but the proposal had not been accepted. 2. I told Nuri Pasha that I could not accept his statement regarding the Sheikh of Koweit’s interest in the smuggling. Our information was that the smuggling was mostly organised by an Iraqi organisation in Basra. The Iraqi Government were of course perfectly free to take any measures they liked on their own territory to deal with the smuggling, but they had been represented to us as wishing to go very much further, and Nuri himself had implied that Koweit had been behaving very badly. This seemed to show a misapprehension of the legal position. The problem was constantly arising of smuggling into a State with high tariffs through a neighbouring state with low tariffs. In suchif 61 such cases there was shsolutely no legal obligation under international law for the state with the low tariff to take any measures to prevent smuggling. The same situation had arisen during the prohibition regime in the United States when British territory had been used as a base for liquor smuggling# His Majesty’s Government had then been under no legal obligation to take special measures merely to enable the United States to enforce their own internal legislation. 5# But while this might be the legal position, it was clearly desirable to arrive at some arrangement, and, just as His Majesty’s Government had come to an agreement with the United States Government with a view to securing a reasonable measure of co-operation in preventing liquor smuggling, so we had been trying to devise some system by which Koweit might co-operate to a reasonable extent with Iraq with a view to preventing the smuggling trade* 4. The difficulty was that the only absolutely effective method of doing this would be to raise the Koweiti tariffs (Nuri immediately agreed on this point). But this was impracticable - firstly because the Koweiti tariffs were limited by treaty, and secondly because the only effect would be an immense rise of prices in Koweit, and the Koweiti administration could hardly be expected to face the unpopularity and odium which this would involve merely in order to enable a neighbouring country td carry out its own tariff legislation. I felt, however, fairly hopeful that the local conference now about to open to discuss this question might find some solution. We had ourselves suggested various methods, such as a system of manifests, trade control posts, the appointment of a British Director of Customs at Koweit, etc*, and I felt that there was thereforetherefore a reasonable hope of a satisfactory settlement 'being reached* 6 * Nuri Pasha said that* if so* this would he most satisfactory. All that Iraq had really wanted hitherto was a free hand to deal with the smuggling in their own way. But if the smuggling could he eliminated by agreement so much the better. Hitherto it had been most difficult to deal with the question in view of the support which the Sheikh had apparently been receiving from His Majesty’s Government. 6 . I tried to disabuse Nuri Pasha of the idea that we were taking sides in the dispute* and I repeated my statement of the legal position as described above; but we agreed that no further action was called for until the results of the Impending conference were known.

A* CYHIER TELEGRAIvI FROM SECRETARY OF STATE ADDRESSED TO POLITICAL RESIDE1TT, BDSHIRE, No. 1933, REPEATED TO POLITICAL RESIDENT, KOWSIT, No.1934, GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, FOREIGN AND POLITICAL DEPARTMENT, No. 1935, AND AMBASSADOR BAGDAD, No.1936, DATED E3rd JUNE, 1935. — XXX SECRET . IMMEDIATE. 1933. Your express letter of 2nd June and your telegram dated 15th June, 512. Koweit smuggling. 2. I have gone into question again in light of Sheikh*s attitude and should be glad if you would take into account following considerations: (a) We do not admit validity of Sheikh*s arguments as regards Director of Customs and he appears to confuse ' smuggling with legitimate trade. (b) Moreover, while Sheikh rejects His Majesty’s Government’s strong advice and says he is prepared to face blockade by Iraqg he somewhat inconsistently looks to His Majesty’s Government to limit blockade in respect of certain matters, i.e. Koweit dates produced in Iraq, and water supply. Though presumably the strict blockade contemplated by Iraqi Government primarily means prohibition of imports from Kov/eit, they have also contemplated cutting off Koweit water supply (see Baghdad telegram of 19th February, No.47). His Majesty’s Government are unable to guarantee that such a step would be held to exceed Iraqi Government’s legal rights, though on/2. on grounds of humanity alone we should of course seek to dissuade them from taking it. In any case prospect of Iraq seeking to apply such extreme measures of coercion seems apart from other considerations to make it impossible for His Majesty’s Government to wash their hands of the dispute, and Sheikh’s request that we should secure immunity of water supply and dates produced in Iraq affords good ground for urging him afresh to reconsider his intransigent attitude. (c) Prospect moreover that His Majesty's Government could if an extreme strain is placed on Koweit Iraq relations succeed in obtaining satisfaction over ownership of date gardens would almost vanish. ’Ifhile this and smuggling problems are distinct in theory Iraqi Government are unlikely to keep them separate in practice, and final ailure over date gardens would be both expensive to His Majesty's Government and damaging to them in the Gulf. (a) His Majesty's Government have in all discussions gxven full weight to arguments advanced by you and Government of India against direct intervention. They quite agree that it may be possible to let matters take their course for some little time. But they remain of opinion that intervention will be necessary sooner or later if (as is essential) they are to maintain their control of Koweit's relations with her neighbours and avoid the odium of iallure to protect her which would inevitably fall back on His , ajesty's Government despite any disclaimer of responsibility. it has been for this reason that they have been so anxious to find a via media. (e) If Iraq is now allowed to apply sanctions it will be quite impossible in practice for His Majesty’s Government to/&gt; 3. * to ensure that these are kept within legitimate limits or to secure any real aatisi'action from Iraq if they are not. That cannot fail to do us damage locally. (f) Moreover, if sanctions are sufficiently effective to make Shaikh sue for terms there can be no question that terms asked by Iraq will be far more severe than at present. (g) You will, apart from this, appreciate that if serious situation develops later and Sheikh then asks for our support. His Majesty’s Government might well be reluctant to risk grave breach with Iraq,in which their interests are so great, merely in order to extricate Sheikh Irom dilficulties of his own making which can be avoided by his adopting a less intransigent attitude now. 3. If in light of above, and in particular of paragraph 2(b), you are prepared to approach Sheikh further, we should welcome it and trust that you will do all in your power to make him see reason. 4. Since above was written I have seen Bagdad telegram No.169 of 22nd June to Foreign Office. If Sheikh really proposes to leave for Bagdad on June 24th, notwithstanding advice to the contrary which you instructed j olitical Agent to give him in paragraph 3 of your telegram No.495 of June 3rd and if you decide that he should be approached on above lines you will no doubt consider desirability of instructing Dickson to make further attempt to dissuade him from going to Bagdad at once or if this fails to accompany him to Bagdad and to make further appeal to him before any communication is made to Iraqi Government by Sir A.Clark Kerr./ Decyphe .

There seems little question that land smuggling exists ana that it is on a considerable scale ana for some time past enaeavours have been made to reach a magus vivenai between Iraq ana the Sheikh of Koweit with the object of suppressing or reaucing it. Unfortunately, all enaeavours to reach an agreement or even to bring the parties together have failed. The Iraq Government have shown themselves somewhat grasping. The legal responsibility for suppressing che traae rests with them; the trade is organised to a large extent in iheir territory, ana tnere is reason to uelieve that their failure to establish a lana cordon, which would be the best means of checking it, is purely aue to their lack of control over tneir frontier tribes. They have, however, made little, if any, effort to take action themselves ana have throughout trieu to put the onus of suppression on the sneikh. The sheikh takes the line tnat his finances would be very seriously affected by the suppression of smuggling; that the responsibility is Iraq's; that the intioduction of a manifest system or of a special preventive service or the appointment of a Director of Customs to work in liaison with the Iraq customs would be injurio-us to his prestige, and tnat he would prefer 'to let the Iraqis ho their worst, In the confioence tha t/- 2 - that his population will support him if they regard him as the victim of Iraqi intrigue. 2. The Foreign Office and India Office have consistently aimed at reaching a via media on the basis of concessions by both Koweit and Iraq. The Ambassador at Baghdad ana the Resident in the Persian Gulf nave equally consistently lookea at the natter purely from the local point of view ana taken the line that it is best to let Iraq and Koweit fight out this matter themselves. The Government of India, after discussion with the Resident, lent a general support to his viewsJ The view taken by the Departments here is that this is impracticable. H.M.G. will have to come in to settle the dispute sooner or later; very important interests are concerned in Iraq, which we cannot imperil over a matter such as Koweit; it is equally important that we should maintain our special position, etc. in Koweit. 3. The latest developments in the situation were discussed at the Foreign Office on 18th June (note of discussion attached) in the light of the sheitch’s refusal to agree to a conference with Iraq or to accept a via media which had been worked out in consultation between the Foreign Office and India Office. The Resident's comments on his attituue are contained in his express letter of 2na June on P.Z.4125/35 and in his personal telegram to Sir Findlater Stewart of 17th June. i- 4. in the light of discussion with the Foreigiji Office the Department felt that it was difficult again to approacn the xtesident before a final decision was oaken and the Foreign Office now concur with the manuscript amendments shown in the draft telegram attacneu/Minute Paper. 3 Department. attached. The amendments are, I think, not unreasonable. As regards the first of tnem, the Sheikh’s arguments are hy no means watertight and it may be as well to indicate that we think so and not expose ourselves to the suggestion from the Resident that we have merely brushed them aside. As regards the date gardens, it will be remembered that we are endeavouring to persuade the Iraq Govt, by a payment of £2,000 to give the sheikh a good title to certain date gardens in Iraq, the permanent possession of which was guaranteed to him by H.lv:.G. in 1914. If it proves impossible to get Iraq to give him the necessary title and he is deprived of the gardens, the liability for compensation will fall back on H.M.G. The Foreign Office are right in thinking that a period of strained relations between Iraq and Koweit will not conduce to a settlement of this point anu might even lead the Iraq Govt, to assist the parties who are endeavouring to dispossess the sheikh. H.M.G. would be directly concerned in * that event. 5. a draft private telegram to Colonel Fowle is also attached. It is desired, if possible, to issue the present telegrarrsby the week-end. The Sheikh will shortly be leaving Kow'eit. . C . 3Mr. Walton, Koweit-Irao in^ . The latest telegrams were discussed at the Foreign Cilice at some length yesterday in the light of the views expressed in Colonel Fowle’s personal telegram to 'the Under secretary of state. It transpired that this was provoked hy the very unfortunately worded telegram No. 160 of 15th June sent to Baghdad an (^repeated to Bushire, of which a copy is helow. Mr. Bendel, in whose absence the telegram was sent, entirely agreed as to the unsuitability of its terms. 2. I took the line: (a) that we agreed with tne resident as to the unsuitability of the communication to the Iraqis proposed in Baghdad telegram 165 on P.z.4134/35; (b) that, our efforts to find a via media having apparently failed, there was nothing for it now but to let matters take tneir course, at any rate for the present, in the hope either that tne Iraqis would lino it impracticable to enforce a blockade, in which case they would become more reasonable, or tnat tne inconvenience caused to the Sheikh by the blockade would be so great that he would be prepared to make concessions which could not be secured from him now; but that it was important that should regard themselves as primarily charged with the interests of the sheikh rather tnan of the Iraq Government, and that the best course would therefore be that we should merely reply at this stage to the Iraqis that the sheikh was unable to accept the proposals which had been put forward, without further comment, on the Iraqis reverting to the subject H.M.G. would inform them that/that in these circumstances they were at liberty to take such legal ana legitimate measures as they thought fit on Iraq territory, but that H.M.G. wouia take a very serious view of any infringement of Koweiti sovereignty or Koweiti rights. 3. fhe Foreign Office representatives said that while sympathising with the India Office view they took a very serious view of the situation which had arisen. They thought that the Resident had been very wooden in his handling of it and that he had displayed complete failure to give due weight to the arguments aavanced by H.M.G. in favour of the via meuia ; nor were they convinced that he had really exerted himself to bring tne sheikn rouna to the point of view expressed by H.M.G. The Foreign Office were most anxious in these circumstances to take up the matter with him again, one important factor was that in their view it woulu be entirely within the rights of the Iraq Government to cut off the water supply to Koweit ana to interfere with the export of proauce from the Sheikh’s Iraq gardens, etc. Ssskwd reasons for taking so serious a view were as follows;- (a) They remained entirely unconvinced that H.M.G. would not have to come in to settle this question sooner or later; (b) the sheikh’s position was much weaker than he thought. If we now told the Iraqis that they could apply legitimate pressure, etc. there was every probability that the pressure applied would be both illegitimate and very severe and it would in practice be quite impossible ior us to uo anything to help him. we should be faced with a repetition of the difficulties we had w ith/with the Persians over Arab dhows. The Iraqis would controvert the detail of the Sheikh's complaints and we should he unahle to establish the facts; (c) It was conceivable that the Iraqis might be unable to enforce their blockade. In that case, they might modify their attitude, but they would be likely to take it out of the sheikh in other ways, e.g. over date his/gardens, etc. assuming, however, that they were in a position to enforce the blockade and that the sheikh sued for terms after six months or a year, in the view of the Foreign Office the rraqis, encouraged by success, would then be likely to insist on terms far more severe that they were now contemplating. (&amp;) fee 'seriouq effects on our posf-tion--ln Ke-wei?t haa-tu be LuirsiUerai; we were telling tne Iraq Government on the one hand that the sheikh was under our protection and tnat they must not interfere with him; on the other hand that we were not in a position to bring any pressure to bear on the sheikh in a matter which unquestionably was calculated to produce a very serious situation between the two states and between Iraq and H.IuG. The Iraq Government might be forgiven if they took the line that this was an impossible situation and that H.IvAG. could not have it both ways. (e) Finally, the effect on Ahblo-Iraqi relations of a really serious breach in which we felt that the Sheikh of Koweit had a legitimate grievance had to be considered. The importance of Koweit was very great. But the formal obligations of H.M.G. to Iraq were also B^eat c,nd her interests in that country very considerable. The possibility, particularly if the situation had been brought/Drought about by the Sheikh's intransigence, that H.IW.G. would not be prepared to face a serious rupture with Iraq over the situation which hau arisen was one which could not be overlooked, though clearly no decision could be taken on this so far ahead. 4. In. Rend el was anxious in these circumstances that we should telegraph in the terms of the draft attached to the Resident. 5. ihCter considerable further discussion, I said that I would submit the Foreign Office views and the question of some further interim conmunication to the Resident. If we were in fact unable to protect the Sheikh's water supply or his date garden produce that might make a difference to his attitude, on the other hand, as he had conmitted himself so far he might even so decide to take his chance. If he did we were merely postponing the evil day for a very short time longer. The Foreign Office agreed tha.t it might be necessary, in hie light of the Resident's reply, to abandon any hope of an agreed settlement at this sta^e, but said that they would feel definitely more at ease if a final appeal had first been made to the Resident.

They do not, however, wish to bind themselves beforehand not to discuss the third clause relating to the adoption of common preventive measures, discussed in the course of the conversation referred to above, since the negotia- tors may possibly be able at the forthcoming meeting to arrive at some other bases for common measures better fitted to secure the desired purpose, to replace those mentioned in the third clause in question. The ’Iraqi w ovarnment can see no objection to the conference being held at Kuwait on the date stated in your above mentioned letter. I avail myself of this opportunity to express my highest consideration and esteem. Yours sincerely, (sd) Yasin A1 Kaahimi. Mr. C.H.

Whatever real reasons of Shaikh’s attitude may he, his arguments in his letter of May 28th to you are either fallacious or irrelevant. 2. As to first, it has never been denied that Koweit is under no legal obligation to cooperate with Iraq in stopping Smuggling. Whole point is that it would be both politically wise and to best ultimate economic interest of Koweit to cooperate in agreed and moderate measures rather than oblige Iraq to take initial action which must cause Koweit infinitely more serious loss. Outstanding example of wisdom of friendly and successful cooperation in such cases was cooperation of H.M.G. with U. S. Government during last stage of prohibition period in U.S.A. Have you made full use of this analogy?34:j'iA 5000 1.35 Draft Paper. Department 3# Second argument, on which whole of remainder of letter seems to depend, completely confuses smuggling with legitimate trade and is meaningless unless all Koweiti trade with Iraq, on which Koweiti prosperity is stated to depend, is assumed to be carded on in violation of Iraqi law. Such illicit trade will be stopped in any case, but Shaikh could still save legitimate trade if he were willing to agree to reasonable measure of cooperation. 4# Business of director of customs would of course be just as much to protect and develop legitimate trade of Koweit as to cooperate in checking illicit trade. There is no parallel between Saudi proposal for resident Saudi inspector in Koweit to protect Saudi interests and proposal cf H.M.G. for customs director who would be servant of Koweiti Government working in interest of Koweit. 5* If Shaikh persists in his present obstructive and unreasonable attitude, H.M.G. will not only no longer be eb le to dissuade Iraqi Government from imposing virtual blockade on Koweit, but will be quite unable to guarantee that Iraqi Government/Department. Government will not place embargo on export to Koweit of produce of Shaikh’s date gardens and/or of fresh water from Shatt-el-Arab. Shaikh should clearly realize this. 6. Shaikh apparently has little conception of weakness of his political and economic position between his two powerful neighbours. Continued independence of his State depends ultimately on suppert and protection of H.M.G. But his continued disregard of the advice which, in his own best interest, H.M.G. have been offering him may make it impossible for them to continue their protection and must much weaken their power to support his cause with Iraq and Saudi Arabia. ?• Before agreeing to leave Iraqi Government a free hand against the Shaikh, H.M.G. would like to see these arguments once more put forcibly before him. In any case it seems desirable that he should be given a time limit in which to consider the gravity of the dangers towards which he is heading. H.M.G. therefore propose to wait until June 26th before withdrawing their opposition to the Iraqi Government taking 313 K A 5000 1.35 all legitimate measures against Koweit Meanwhile/;U3'iA 5000 1.35 Draft Paper.

He said with some emotion that he was being ^athloom (oppressed) and that his letter was meant as a Dakhala (an Arabic term used by a man appealing for protection from his overlord for his life) to His Majesty^* Government* He accompanied this by the very expressive gesture of removing his head dress as if to lay it at my feet* 4. In these circuraatancea it would be worse than useless to pursue the matter further with the Shaikh. The only course now left is to inform the Iraq Government that in spite of our representations to the Shaikh the latter much regrets he is unable to agree to the Iraqi proposals - such of his reasons as seems suitable may be given* That the Iraqi Government are therefore free to institute their blockade and pro video these measures are legal His Majesty's Government have no intention of assisting the Shaikh* The latter it will be noticed at the end of his letter states that he quite understands he cannot ask His Majesty’s Govern-, ment for intervention t except in thejmatfer of produce from his and his people's gardens being imported into Kuw it, and with regard to the drinking water from the Ghatt-al-Arab* i&amp;teg£gd. ad.

After Complinen te, During your present visit to Kuwait we have had various conversations at which Colonel Dickson was present, in the course of which you strongly advised me on behalf of His Majesty’s aovermaent to accept generally certain proposals for stopping smuggling from Kuwait into XiU^ These proposals include the appointment of a Customs Director in ihiwait with special powers, which powers might include the restriction on the import of certain articles into Kuwait, the formation of a preventive service by me, working in co-operation with a fully organised frontier service organised by the X 8 A 4 Government, and a system of land manifests* The whole cost of the above measures to be met by the IHA .4 Government. Further you Informed me that the details of these proposals would be discussed at a conference over which you would preside, Kmait being represented by one Kuwaiti official ahd one British official, and XIU. V by one XiU^X official and one British official. You also warned me that if I did not accept the XHa J proposals, the IRA 4 X Government would institute a complete blockade of my State and might even place restrictions on the boats of ray people which fetch drinking water from the &amp;hat al Arab. as X informed you verbally, I regret with all my heart that X am unable to accept the advice of the High well Oovemiaent* 1 know/that the High Government will doubtless be disappointed at this and I would be very grateful if xajjjmM,- e - you would forward thle ay letter to the Oovemaeait of Indie to be placed before Hie Ssoelleney the Viceroy, who I hew had the honour of asoting when he peeeed through ay State last yaar, fron whom I heye just reoeiTed the hojiour of e 'Kherite* on the occasion of the Jubilee of Hie Majesty Oeorge V. I would be Grateful also if you would eend a copy direct to Hie Majeety'e OowaHunent in honacn of this ay letter. My object in making this request is because I wish to BKhe a personal eocplanation giving the reasons why I am unable to follow the advice of Hie Majesty’s wove roman t, since 1 do not wish His Majesty’s Oovemasnt to think that in not following their advice, 1 aa actuated by » spirit of obstinacy towards His Majesty’s Uovemaent or by ill will towards IRAh* My reasons for not being a bis to follow the adviee of the British Government are as follows*.- jjx the first place I know that the XR&amp;h Governiiant has no legal right to ask sie to do what they wish n© to do, though this would not have prevented m from helping as a good neighbour, if it had been posable• In the second place, whether the smuggling is stopped by me in Kuwait or by the blockading forces, there will be gije^ous loe® to ay small Btate, which grow© nothing but grass, and which therefore entirely depends ©n trade with the interior, in order to get money where with to buy food and clothing from inaia&gt; tor Its po ; u- I 1 stion numbering about 100 f 0 u 0 people. - « a _ hxr rvuiAtm. of action by the incurred by ray own action in agreeing to the proposals of the XiU- » - the IKik-4 Govemxasnt, the results would be as follows:~ i^lrstly -Kts^mit would definitely loss all her trade with the Interior, since It would be the business of the new Birector of Customs to arrange this. Secondly * The whole of Arabia would understand that Kuwait had surrendered her liberty to and so had become a vassal of hers« thirdly - 1, the Shaikh, would be regarded as a traitor by all the members of my family as well as by all the people of Kuwait, and 1 would be execrated, and possibly have to meet great difficulties and troubles, fourthly * Bin &amp;aud would hi self say that *Ths shaikh of Kuwait haa surrendered his iitate to XRfci** He would tell his people that when it war a case xxx of his asking for a single representative to reside in Kuwait to collect transit dues, I the .shaikh, refused though now at the the request of IBAh Ocwremmsnt I had consented to a Christ ian Director of cuetoms with vary large powers. It will not be forgotten that in refusing Bin Baud’s request on the grounds that such would have been interpreted as placing Kuwait under ft'ejd control, X had tbs support and sympathy of His Majesty’s Oovemment, fifthly - With Kuwait trade gone, and I,the shaikh, a traitor to my people, there will follow an exodus 'Hajir” from the town, of my loading citizens, notables and mer chants. If however the loss is occasioned not by my fault, my family and my people will support me in my troubles, Bine© therefore I am unable to agree to the IKAsi proposals, there would be no benefit in holding the con ference sugg ested by Hie Majesty’s Ooremiaent. If the IBAQl Government therefore wish to impose a bioclcada, X cannot of course stop thorn, and provided the measures they takm4 take are lawful and on their aid© of the frontier, I realise that X can make no eomplalnt to Hla Majesty's Goyernmerit, and shall put ray trust In God. All I ask from His Majesty's Goyernmeat Is that the r\ , _ procedure of my date gardens in IRA^aa well as those of any of my subjects, which Is sent to iCuwalt, and the drinking water of my people, which comes from the Shat al Arab, should be immune from Blockade measures. In conclusion it will be seen that what X consider to be the honour of my State, Is Inyolwed In this matter; and X am sure that the High British Government which has due regard always for her own honour, and which entered the great war for the protection of a small State like Belgium, will consider my explanations said representations with sympathy.

It will be observed that the note revives the question of the suppression of smuggling either by raising the Koweiti tariff to correspond with that in force in Iraq or by limiting Koweiti imports to quantities reasonably required for local consumption. 3. Both of these proposals were, as you are aware, put .forward by Taufiq-al-Suwaidi (then Minister for Foreign Affairs) during his visit to London in October, 1938, and were later communicated by Your Lordship’s department in a letter (E 5705/75/91) of October 19th, 1938, to the India Office with a request that they should receive careful consideration. At the same time, it was suggested to the India Office that if action on the lines of these proposals was not considered practicable, alternative plans for dealing with smuggling should be put forward. 4. I have not been informed what, if any, decision has been reached as the result of this correspondence, but it appears from his telegram No. 80 of January 29th, to the Government of India, that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf sees /strong The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.0.S•I., G.C.I.E.,strong objection to advising the Shaikh of Ko-weit to consider action of the kind desired by the Iraqi Government. The alternative measures suggested in the same telegram were rejected by the Iraqi Government in 1935 as altogether ineffective and inadequate and it would, I foresee, merely be irritating and profitless to offer them to the Iraci Government again. 5. I agree with the views set cut in paragraph 5 of the Foreign Office letter ?Tc. E 5705/75/91 of October 19th, 1938, to the India Office and, in view of the considerations set out in my despatch under reference, it appears necessary that the whole question should now again be carefully examined at a very early date, for undoubtedly the Iraqi Government have got a legitimate grievance. 6.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs present their compliments to His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy, Bagdad, and have the honour to state that smuggling activities based on Koweit and the problems resulting therefrom have been causing considerable losses to the Iraqi Treasury and have for the last four years been the subject of considerable correspondence between the Ministry and the esteemed Embassy. As the esteemed Embassy are aware-, the Iraqi Government had put forward several proposals for the settlement of the problems existing between them and Koweit, but it has not sc far been possible to reach a satisfactory and reasonable solution of these problems. The Iraqi Government feel fully confident that it is the oninion of His Majesty's Government that the problems in question should be disposed of by negotiation with due regard to the principles of justice and the exigencies of the situation, and also that it is their desire in common with the Ministry that an end should be put, in an amicable manner, to the smuggling activities the continuance of which will ultimately affect the good relations obtaining between the two parties. Accordingly, and for final settlement of these problems, the Ministry suggest that the British Government should assume responsibility for the administration of customs in Koweit by placing them under the direct control British officials to regulate imports into Koweit, either by the quantitative limitation of imports having regard to local consumption, or by the imposition of duty on imports /into / / / /into Kov/eit at the rates leviable by the Iraqi Government on goods similar to those being smuggled or imoorted into Iraq, or by some other means as will ensure the prevention of smuggling. The Iraqi Government believe that such arrangement ^ will stoo the continuous smuggling from Koweit. Otherwise the Iraqi Government should be allowed to enter into direct negotiations with the Shaikh of Koweit for the settlement of this affair, Having on all occasions given evidence of their -good will and helpful attitude towards Koweit and its Shaikh, the Iraqi Government had hoped that in return the Shaikh of Koweit would adopt the necessary measures to stop smuggling activities. It is however to be regretted that nothing of the sort has been done. The Ministry wish to assure the esteemed Embassy that in the event of the Iraqi Government finding themselves compelled to adopt measures for the prevention of smuggling activities based on Koweit, such measures as may be adopted by them shall not affect the status quo in Koweit. The Ministry avail themselves of the opportunity to express their highest consideration and esteem.

My dear Baggallay, At Mendel’s subbestion I am sending you herewith a copy of his letter of February 22nd to me about smuggling from Koweit. Yours ever (Initialled). A.C.K. H.L. Baggallay, hsq.Kuwait. The 22nd February, 1937. My dear Archie, I have hau a preliminary and informal talk with de Uaury about the smuggling etc. He points out of course that he cannot express any definite views or discuss the question officially without Towle’s approval, but one or two points have emerged on which I think it is worth sending you a line without further delay. I will begin by recording my own statement of the position, as it is relevant and it may be useful to have it on record. ‘X u + 2. I explained that it really seemed essential that we should be able to make some constructive proposals to the Iraqis at once. Kightly or wrongly they were thoroughly worked up about the question of smuggling from Kuwait. It would not help to go on pointing out to them that under international practice the responsibility for enforcing the Iraqi tariff rests with the Iraqis only. The effect of a purely negative attitude on our part or on that of Shaikh, would, in present circumstances, simply be that the Iraqis would make it impossible, as they unfortunately easily could, to get any settlement of other outstanding questions - especially that of the date gardens, where, owing to the mistakes of our predecessors, we were now in a very weak position vis a vis Iraq. No doubt the Shaikh would say that that was our trouble not his ana that we were pledged to save the situation for him. r&gt;ut the thing had to be dealt with from the point of view of practical politics, and the only real hope of making progress and establishing satisfactory relations between Kuwait and Iraq was not to stand too rigidly on the letter of the law but to try to meet the Iraqis half way by showing some genuine good will, and showing it soon. « u ‘X 1 3. lour proposal therefore, as I understood it, was that you shoula be authorized to go to the Iraqis and tell them at once (i) that negotiations were actively proceeding, through His Majesty’s Government, between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for the re-establishment and regulation of Saudi-Kuwait traae, (ii) that until these negotiations were concluded - which we hoped would be in the near future - the question of the proper regulation of Kuwait-Iraqi trade could not usefully be tackled, but (iii) that, as soon as a Kuwaiti- Saudi settlement was reached, His Majesty’s Government would be ready to urge the Shaikh of Kuwait to conclude a corresponding agreement on similar lines with Iraq for the regulation and ”canalization' of trade between Kuwait and Iraq. 4. de Gaury immediately replied that the snag about this was that conditions were not analogous. Trade could be re-established between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia because Kuwait was a natural port of entry for goods for northern Hasa and Neju and there was no other satisfactory harbour nearer than Bahrain. (I interrupted here to say that I thought Has Tanurah was likely to be rapidly developed by the Calarabian company - but even so of course it is a long way South East). Therefore there would still be trade even if Saudi duties remained/ Excellency Sir Archibald Clark-Kerr, K.C.M.G., British embassy, BAGHDAD.remained as high as at present, which was not certain, as local tariff arrangements might always be reached to facilitate trade. -but once all goods from Kuwait had to pay full import duty into Iraq, there would be no reason to send them via Kuwait. In fact Kuwait would have no raison d’etre as an entrepot for Iraqi imports. « 5. The Shaikh’s attitude was, then, that he could and would completely stop smuggling into Iraq once his trade with Saudi Arabia was re-opened; hut that this would in fact stop all trade between Kuwait and Iraq - so why devise elaborate and cumbersome machinery for its ’’canalization'? 6. I replied that I did not think the cases were so very different. I saw little prospect of Saudi duties being reduced, and in either case-it would no doubt be of doubtful advantage, once full import duties were levied on the land frontier, to import through Kuwait goods which could equally well be importea to Saudi Arabia or Iraq direct. but I thought there would still be some trade e.g. in order to avoid the payment of basra port dues etc., and I thought that proper arrangements ought to be made to enaole legitimate trade to exist. Anyhow I was convinced that, on wider grounds, it would be good policy for the Shaikh to agree, even if the effect in the end should be much the same as total prohibition. 7. de Saury thought that it would probably be much simpler for the Shaikh simply to promise to stop all smuggling into Iraq - a promise which he saw no reason why the Shaikh could not fulfil, since he has absolute patriarchal power in his principality - as soon as an agreement for the re-opening of Kuwaiti trade with Saudi Arabia should have been concluded. 8. I objected to this that it would be a virtual admission that alb smuggling was carried on at present with the Shaikh’s connivance, and would be making an offer from which it might be difficult to retreat. 9. de Saury eventually said that if we all attached real importance to an arrangement being made quickly for the 'canalization' of Kuwaiti-Iraq trade, corresponding to that now under negotiation for the canalization of Kuwaiti- Saudi trade, he saw no insuperable objection himself, though he still thought the, arrangement would be valueless and cumbersome and that a total stoppage of smuggling (and of trade; would oe preferable. 10. I said I would discuss the matter further with Kowle, to whom I am taking a copy of this letter tomorrow. 11. de Saury made several interesting points which I have left to the end, as they do not, I think, affect the main argument. One was that, however much the Kuwaitis may profit from smuggling he is convinced that the main organization is Iraqi, and that a numuer of highly placed Iraqis, and also Iraqi police, particularly in Hejef and Kerbala, are 'in' on it. There has, of course, been a lot of material on this already, and I am not sure that the embassy and the Gulf authorities have always agreed about the facts. besides it is obvious that the Kuwaitis must have an/I an initial responsibility since they import and resell the goods. But I think it seems probable on the face of it that a goou many Iraqis are well in on the business, and this ray perhaps partly account for the reluctance of the Iraqi Government to take more drastic measux'es on their siae of the frontier, and for their insistence on the difficulty and expense of such measures. As I think we once said in a letter or despatch from the foreign Office, it is difficult to see why it should be much more difficult and expensive for the Iraqis to blockade Kuwait than for the Gaudis to do so. There seems no doubt that the Iraqis have at least been conniving at a good deal of smuggling which they could have stopped. I understand for example that there is a very great deal of smuggling back into Iraq of Iraqi cigarettes, which are exported from Iraq to Kuwait in bond and free of excise. Naji al Asil apparently tola de Gaury that he knew about this. But the Iraqis could surely either prohibit or tax the export of their own cigarettes to Kuwait, particularly as all shipments have to have manifests’? 12. Another point that de Gaury made was that if the oil revenues here came up to expectations, and trade in, e.g., sheepskins, continued to improve at the present rate, then the question of Kuwaiti-Iraqi trade relations with it the whole smuggling business ought to become less important, and therefore easier to settle. But I pointed out that it was nevertheless very necessary to get something settled soon - or at least to make some real step forward in the airection of a settlement even if that settlement was not of much practical value, since what was mattering at present was the psychological atmosphere, which was very bad and was making the settlement of other more difficult questions quite impossible. 13. I hope this talk may have served to clear the air. 14. I am giving a copy of this letter to de Gaury (as well as to u'owle) and enclose a duplicate in case you should like to send it privately to Lacy Baggallay. Yours ever, (Signed). G.W.

The l8tt « r consisted of the Director-General of the Ministry ol Finance, the Accountant General, and the Director-General of the Ministry of Economics. , v Jhc questions raised by the Government representatives were (e) flight of capital, and (b) exchange control* (a) was raised owing to some uninformed comments which have appeared recently in the vernacular press. The banks were unanimous that they had seen no signs of any serious flight of * proposal to prohibit the exoort of gold was dlecucsed and this recurs later in this Note. The view expressed by the banks was that whilst prohibition could be made effective in the case of shipments by recognised routes it would be impossible to prevent smuggling on a large scale oving to the geographical position of the country with which view the Government representatives were in accord. It was pointed out that the gold which has been leaving Iraq for destination ' probably, at least in p”rt, reforwarding to Oyria. of which the volume in the past three months or so has been considerable, was almost if not entirely in transit from India v,smuggled out) and 3audl Arabia and Persian Gulf* (Xir own comment! begins - HIt l ® estimated that gold sovereigns smuggled from India ^Karachi) during the last few months reached a total of half a million sovereigns* worth £1,000,000/- mostly Imported by passengers on regular passenger boats and dhows*' Comment ends* (b) ihe Government representatives had no fixed ideas as to what form exchange control should take and how it should be applied and solicited the views of the banks* The latter stressed that any control intro uced should not apply to sterling and linked currencies, sterling and rupee payments which are the principal items, being already effectively controlled in Great Britain and India* Furthermore, it was pointed out that any form of control over sterling operations might run counter to the Iraq Currency Laws and regulations and the Government representatives acceoted those views. There remained, therefore, only the question of hard currencies which, in Iraq at the present time, boils down to u.3*dollars almost entirely* The Director-General of Finance said that the Commercial Secretary of the British Embassy had out it to him that the British Government could not be expected to continue as in the pest to provide Isrge sms of dollars for Iraqi requirements as long as a free market for that currency exists here and dollars created by Iraqi exports are not sold to the / London Contro!. It was recognised, therefore, that unless there was full cooperation in this matter betwe n Iraq and the British Government, the former might find themselves dependent for dollars solely for those which resulted from their own exports to/ / /% P.Z. 561 **4r- to U.3.A. The Govermuent representative b supply would about cover their normal co for Imports f 1*011 U. 3*A« But* in additionvia large sums (amounts unspecified) for Government America - largely aeroplanes and Britain is not at present in a position to supply* Director-General of Economics said that as the oil payable in London were * &gt; ' 4 ~ necessary dollars must estimated th$t that pamerbC^ 1' jce^pirement -ey^require purchases in amaments etc. which Great The Royalties ^intended for this purpose”, the be provided by London - presumably because these royalties were originally stipulated payable in gold. We offer no comment on this expression of opinion* The same official also said that a third category of requirements existed for which dollars ’must” be provided, i.e* imports into Iraq of Japanese manufactures* It was made clear that, in the personal opinion of the banking rep resent a three present, there was not even the slenderest chance of the British Government being willing to provide from their own resources, dollars for this purpose* The unreasonable nature of such an expectation was made clear* The Accountant General exoressed the view that it was useless to place a control on dollar dealings unless gold was also controlled, otherwise, gold could be shipped to U.S.A# for conversion into uncontrolled dollars. The Iraq Government are reluctant to introduce a measure to control gold export which they know they cannot fully enforce. The gold question opened up a wide field for discussion and some conjecture and we do not propose to go into that fully here* Shipments of gold to U.S.A* would be costly when freight, loss of interest, and particularly insurance are considered. We do not know «*hat premiums would be, but assume that they would be heavy* Another possible means of creating dollars with gold would be to export geld to India to purchase dollars from the Reserve Bank — which we understand is possible* If so,it is presumed this could be stopped by action of the Government of India* Our own comment: begins - 'Another method of creating free dollars in U.S.A* would be to ship Iraq produce invoiced and drawn against at prices below real value with a private arrangement that the difference between the amount of the drawing and the real purchase price should be credited to a free dollar account in America in the name of the Iraqi exporter*' Comment ends* Government representatives stressed that to meet the British Government’s view, they would like to devise a scheme which would achieve this by 'administrative” means and without resort to legislation* Their desire, therefore, was that the banks should put forward their suggestions for attaining the desired objective on those lines* The real desire of the Government is in our view to meet the wisnes of H.B.M.'s Government without thetnselves taking any action which would lay them open to criticism in Parliament or the press* We are giving this question study and shall discuss it fully with the Commercial Secretary and write you further* (Sgd* ) P.J.H* Baghdad, November 26, 1940* H-GEJ\ NOTE* At the request of representatives of are considering what they could propose as thfe muyt pfaclTcal means of effecting a control over dealings in foreign exchange* (Throughout this note ”foreign exchange” is understood to mean currencies outside the Sterling hlock t namelys dollars f Swiss francs etc.)* It appears to the Banks that no scheme is likely to meet with the approval of all concerned or could constitute control unless it embodies the following points:- r P.Z. 561 T? overtQent the l^anks a) All future foreign exchange operations to be restricted to the authorised banks with adequate penalties for any infringeraent 9 b) The Customs Department to require exporters to produce a Certificate from one of the authorised banks that the relative exchange has been sold to them in every case where the medium of exchange is other than one of those of the sterling block, (the question of exchange arising from other causes than export can be dealt with later)* As the Bank of England will grant foreign exchange to Iraqi interests for purpose of import into Iraq only and that only to cover imports from the actual country whose currency is concerned (viz. imports only from U.S*A* in dollars, or from Switzerland in Swiss francs), it is suggested, as an additional safeguard against attempts to re-export in contravention of this condition, that in the case of all imports in those currencies regulations should be framed to ensure that all Customs Bills of Entry other than those retained by the Customs Department themselves should be delivered to the Bank handling the relative credits to be retained by them and that under no circumstances should the Customs Department issue copies to an importer unless his application is countersigned by an authorised bank. This would need to be worked out in detail with the Customs Department. Further, although the following may not come strictly within the province of the banks, it is thought that it should be assumed that the Bank of England would not be willing to release foreign exchange for the purpose of the import of non- essentials into Iraq and it is suggested that, in order to minimise difficulties for Iraqi importers, the Committee of Supply should draw up a list of Iraq’s essential needs which would be agreed between the two Governments. ^quests for exchange to pay for any goods not on that list would require the countersignature of the Committee of Supply before the authorised banks would make special application to the ;ank of England for such purpose. It is desired to emphasise that the foregoing represents personal ideas and that the local Managers here cannot commit the banks to any definite undertakings without the prior sanction of their respective Boards. Neither are they aware of the future policy of the Bank of England in this matter and the latter would, of course, have to be consulted. In view of the desire expressed by you that a way should oe found to deal with this whole question ^administratively anu as the Banks naturally are not aware of the scope of administrative powers, it would appear that they cannot proceed further with the drawing up of a scheme until they are iniornea / whetherwhether the points mentioned above would prove acceptable to Government.

Exports from Iran to U.a.A. are on a considerable scale and, in order to retain the dollar exchange arising from them the merchants consign them to Iraq and draw against them in Iraq dinars which they duly sell to the Iranian Control. The agents in Iraq for the exporters then forward the goods to America drawing against them in dollars. These dollars are either sold here in the black market or may be deposited in America and from there remitted to Ja l an or countries bordering on Germany or elsewhere. As exchange control in this country would not bring these dollars within our net unless exporters were required to provide to the Customs at the time of export proof that the relative exchange had been sold to an authorised bank.

Dear Bureau, P.Z. 6106 I940 i 3eptember, 1940* With reference to our letter No* 390/13/^° of June 13th regarding gold smuggling, we enclose details of further shipments of gold carried from Bahrain' to Bagdad hy British Overseas Airways. You will see that though the movement was still considerable in June and July it^fell away in August and is now limited to spasmodic shipments* 9* We also enclose conies of letters received from the Ottoman Bank regarding the efforts they have made to check the sale of rupees on India, which might he used to purchase gold* They can, however, hardly he exoected to maintain an attitude which is prejudicing their own hanking business and assisting competitors who do not have similar scruples. The Eastern' Bank is, we understand, co-operating with the Ottoman Bank in refusing to arrange for the purchase of rupees not intended for genuine commercial transactions. The Imperial Bank of Iran, on the other hand, continues apparently to accept such transactions without question* 3. In the last paragraph of the Ottoman Bank’s letter dated 24th August the suggestion is made that the traffic in gold smuggled from India might he effectively checked if the competent Indian authorities prohibited the opening of rupee credits in India by the sale of sterling from Iraq except through the three British hanks established here (orovided, of course, the three hanks were instructed by their Head Offices to adopt the same policy as regards the verification of the purpose of any credits which they were asked by their clients to ooen in India). We submit this suggestion for what it is v/orth and should be grateful if we could receive your comments as soon as possible as it seems unfair that two British banks should continue to be unduly penalised by the spontaneous action they have taken in the public interest. 4* The price of sovereigns in Bagdad n«w stands at Intelligence Bureau, Home Department, Government of India, Simla* about/PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL. OTTOMAN BANK, BAGHDAD. 24th August, 1940. Dear Sir, On several occasions in the past we have discussed the question of gold coin which has been passing through this country of late for destination Palestine and, possibly, Syria. The gold is believed to have come from India, Saoudi-Arabia and countries bordering on the Persian Gulf. The abnormal demand for rupees in Basrah of late is doubtless connected with this traffic. For record purposes, we give you below the instructions which we have issued to our Basrah branch in this connection ’’There is reason to believe that part of rthe abnormal demand for rupees on India which now prevails in your market is for the financing of shipments of gold in . transit through Iraq for destination Palestine and very possibly Syria also. Information obtained here is to the effect that the gold comes from India, Saoudi Arabia, ana countries abutting on the Persian ^ulf. You should be particularly careful to avoid in any way assisting in financing gold from India . The export from that country is, we are given to understand, forbidden and any export of gold must therefore be smuggled. This Bank must not, of course, be a party, however indirectly, to illegal operations of such nature. We have not received any request from the British Government in this connection although we have passed on to Mis Majesty’s Embassy all information which has reached us. Nevertheless you should not take part in a business, however, lucrative, which might not be approved of by the British Government or might, however indirectly, be contrary to British interests. For gold emanating from the other countries named, the same objections do not apply as far as we are aware. We think it would be advisable to obtain a signed statement from each purchaser of rupees, other than for small and regular or known business, setting out for what purpose the rupees are required. ” In commenting our Basrah branch have made the following observations (i) (i) Some merchants buying rupees are prepared to sign declarations that they are required for genuine commercial transactions when our branch believe though without proof that they are actually for gold business. Refusal to sell in the face of such a declaration antagonises customers whose general business is of value to the Bank.

Dear Sir, SALE OF RUPEES ON INDIA. Further to my letter of the 24th instant, I attach herewith, for your information, copy of a letter I have received from my Basrah Branch regarding the above subject. . . - The position really is as follows • There are no Laws or Regulations to prevent the Banks in this country selling Rupees freely, but we do feel there is a moral obligation on us to do our utmost to prevent any infringment of British interests such as indirectly financing the illegal export of gold from India. We feel, however, that can never be completely achieved without legislation on the subject such as was proposed in my above quoted letter or in the attached annexe. Yours faithfully, (Signed) F.J. HARRIS. Regional Manager. ENCLOSURE. CR 40/408 Basrah, PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL. August 26th, 1940. SALES OF RUPEES ON INDIA. With reference to our C.R. 40/400 of 22nd instant the position concerning the sale of rupees is still not very clear. As already informed you, for all sales of rupees we have been requesting our clients to make a statement in writing showing for what purpose the rupees are required. This in itself has already caused a certain amount of hard feeling with one or two of our clients who reluctantly have stated that the rupees were required to pay for goods imported from Bombay and/or Karachi to Kuwait and/or Basrah and occasionally to Saoudi Arabia. They also state on the form that the merchandise does not include Gold. We are in a difficult position as we feel sure that the statement is not always strictly correct although in some cases it is. This morning, clients who are not great importers have requested cheques on Bombay to cover Importation of rice and other merchandise to Kuwait. When v/e asked for details of the value/value of the rice, also what the other merchandise consisted of, our clients refused to give any information. In due course they went to the I.B.I. who from today have decided to request a similar statement to that required hy us. They also refused and in due course the E.B. were approached and issued the necessary cheques. ‘T | This is not an isolated case and last week many of our clients went elsewhere “because we would not accommodate them. We think you will appreciate that the position is . delicate and unless some arrangement can be made we must either be prepared to lose our Nedjdi clientele or else sell them rupees on false statements. ' Even should the three banks decide only to sell against written statements that the rupees are for genuine business, it will not check the gold movement, and again what can we do when we know a statement to be false but yet the client is able to obtain his requirement elsewhere on the same statement. The only real solution is to open credits or else make mail transfers to be paid only on presentation of certified invoices. Your comments on the situation will be greatly appreciated. (Intld.) ?.??.

It will be obaerved that the note revive© the question of the auppreaaion of aimiggling either by raising the Kovelti tariff to correspond with that in force in Iraq or by limiting Koweiti Imports to Quantities reasonably required for local consumption. 3. Both of these proposals were, as you &amp;re aware, put forward by Taufiq-al-auwaidi (then Minister for ^orei 5 jn ^ff&amp;irs) during his visit to tendon in October, 1938, and vero later comsitsiioated by Your Lorlahip*© department in a letter (X 3705/75/91) of October 10th, 193% to the India Cffioe with a requeat that they should receive careful consider©tion. At the seme time, it was suggested to the India Office that if action on the lines of these pronoeale was not considered practicable, alternative plans for dealing with smuggling should be put forward. 4. I have not been informed what, if any, decision has been reached as the result of this correspondence, but it appear* from his telegram He. 80 of January 29th, to the Government of India, that the Political Heeident in the Persian Oulf sees strong objection to advising the qhaifch of Xoweit to consider notion The Bight Honourable The Vieeount Halifax, $C*G., 0»C.d*l., 0•• 1 • »•,2 action of the Vlad desired by the Iraqi Government.

The India Office letter of the 9th November was only received here at the end of November and we have since then been giving the matter our most careful consideration, but have not yet received any views from Fowle. It seems. If I may say so a little hard that the Govt, of India should be expected to produce a solution at almost a moment’s notice for a problem,whlch has completely baffled all the other authorities Including His Majesty's Govt, who have been attempting to deal with It for the last 3 or 4 years. We have, as you will have seen, sent a telegram on the subject to the Resident,which may or may not produce some further suggestions. If the India Office find this tele gram rather unhelpful towards a solution, I am afraid we can only plead that, while we agree that something ought to be done, we do not at present see what can be done without sacrificing the financial stability of Kuwait and thereby accept/ some responsibility for the future. The position of Kuwait in this matter appears to me to be somewhat similar to that of Pondicherry and the other French Settlements in Indla,whlch have for ing- 2 - many years derived their whole prosoerity from the fact are that their free ports/lying on the coast of a country^ which has adopted a policy of high tariff and protective duties. Recent investigations showed that they were deriving on wards of a crore of rupees per annum from smuggling into British India and in order to prevent this we have been compelled to undertake drastic preventive measures^which have been expensive but have paid for themselves many times over. All appeals for French co-operation in preventing smuggling have, as you probably know, entirely failed and we have been forced to the conclusion that the remedy lies with the Govt, of India and not with the French Govt. Similarly it would seem that the remedy in the case of Kuwait really lies with the Iraq Govt., though the situa tion is of course complicated by the fact that H.M.G. have some responsibility for Kuwait f s foreign relations. ?*y L\a Ia/wU**? object^ is mainly to assure you that we are not being in any way deliberately obstructive over this, but simoly do not - - - - in'* , | hi i Mil iiii»i mwi— see at present any solution for tne difficulty. Perhaps if later on an oil industry is developed at Kuwait, the Sheikh may cease to be dependent on illegitimate trade with Iraq.

Could you please refer to the record of a conversation held at the Foreign Office on October 4th 1938 with the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs received as an enclosure to India * ^ office Express Letter No.P.2.7136/38, dated the 8 th November flu. ptyH? . Q- 1938. ♦* J 0 oXCj H^sf- MJfJU 2. With reference to that part of the conversation which dealt with Kuwait I have the following comments to offer. * Mr.Baxter referred to the reference in Taufiq Suwaidi*s aide-memoire to Kuwait as a centre for extensive arms traffic and smuggling. He would like to consider, in the first place, the statement that there was an important illegal traffic in arms into Iraq. Hitherto, he believed, His Majesty’s Government had not received any evidence to show that any such smuggling of arms was, in fact, taking place. In fact, the British authorities in the Persian Gulf seemed to be fairly sure that no arms were now entering Kuwait, at all events by sea. He asked whether the Iraqi Government were able to produce any evidence to show that smuggling of arms did, in fact, take place through Kuwait.’* With regard to the sentence: ‘♦The British authorities in the Persian Gulf seemed to be fairly sure that no arms were now entering Kuwait, at all events by sea. H The British __ authorities / R.T.Peel Esquire, M. The India Office, London*n-), - 2 - 8198 1938 ~70 V I C? O O of the SenioF^faval Officer and authorities in question consist myself# The Senior Naval Officer was certain that very few if any arms enter Kuwait by sea - vide Admiralty letter to the Foreign Office, No.M.03097/38, dated the 4th August 1938. I am equally certain that no arms are smuggled from Kuwait to Iraq by land - vide my Express Letter N o.427 ^1, dated the 21st July 1938, to the Air Officer commanding, British Forces in Iraq, especially para graph 7 in which I summed up the situation. In these circum stances could not the Gulf case have been put a little stronger ? ^hat I feel is that unless our case is put strongly the Iraqi Government will continue to return to the charge with their customary vague accusations for which they can produce no proof. 3 # ' Major Edmonds added that, to his personal knowledge, as a result of his conversations with Iraqi tribesmen, it was quite a frequent occurrence for an Arab to buy a rifle in Kuwait for £ 5 or £ 6 and to travel with it to Iraq, where he would sell it for about twice that amount. The fact was that Kuwait had become a recognised market where Arabs, whether would-be smugglers or not, went to purchase arms. He was quite prepared to believe that the British authorities in the Persian Gulf were right when they said that no arms entered Kuwait by sea, but it was absolutely certain that somehow or other these arms were available for sale in Kuwait.•• You will see that Edmonds seized upon the point that no and implied arms entered Kuwait by sea, jftmpiaritig/that arms did enter by land, jftth regard to the rest of his remarks. I have no doubt that he is perfectly correct in stating that an odd rifle or two can now and then be picked up at Kuwait. It is not this ,however, against which /^7! -3- 8198 which the Iraqis complain but against a jkeg on a large scale from JOiwait. 3cLmon&lt;i8 , implication that Kuwait town is now a thriving arms traffic centre is entirely without founda tion. 4 . Jith regard to other forms of smuggling. * Mr.Baxter informed His jSxcellency that His Maj esty # s Government had, in fact, received an expert report, from which it appeared that the Iraqi authorities might be able to give smuggling from Kuwait a decisive blow if they were to take certain additional measures, e.g., control by aeroplanes and armoured cars, together with drastic measures against those organisations or individuals in Iraq who must be assisting in smuggling on such a large scale as had been suggested by His Sxcellency.^ I was glad to see that Baxter pressed the point that the Iraqi Government should take anti-smuggling measures in Iraq itself. These measures the Iraqi Government could easily put into practice but refuse to do. In this connection please see paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of my letter No.316-S, dated the 27th i March 1937, to Clark Kerr. You will see that Edmonds himself, Sargon oi the Iraq Poliwe and Haji al Asil, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, were all of the opinion that the Iraqi authorities could take certain anti-smuggling measures behind the lines in Iraq itself. In point of fact the Iraqi authorities have taken no such measures. 5.

It consists of correspondence between the Foreign Office, Colonial Office, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent at Kuwait, and HM High Commissioner (and later Ambassador) at Baghdad, as well as communications received from Al Sabah and representatives of the Government of Iraq.The bulk of the correspondence concerns efforts by HM Ambassador at Iraq, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the Political Agent at Kuwait, to broker an agreement between the two parties. This included discussion of Iraqi proposals to assume control of Kuwaiti customs, to instigate joint border-controls and a manifest system for goods transported by land or sea, or to impose Kuwaiti tariffs on imports at the same rate as Iraqi tariffs. Later correspondence discusses the negotiation of an anti-smuggling agreement between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and a proposed customs union between Kuwait and Iraq. The correspondence makes reference to on-going negotiations over the Kuwait-Iraq border, and the Iraqi date gardens owned by the Shaikh of Kuwait.There is a small quantity of correspondence from 1941 between the Government of Iraq, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the Ottoman Bank at Baghdad, regarding currency smuggling, money laundering, and the purchase of Indian rupees.The file includes dividers which give lists of correspondence references contained in the file by year. These are placed at the end of the correspondence (folios 2-3).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Borders</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ottoman Bank</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Smuggling</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0001a5#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
