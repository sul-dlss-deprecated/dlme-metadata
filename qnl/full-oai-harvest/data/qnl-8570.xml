An English translation of the law is included in the file (f 58). The file’s principal correspondents are: HM Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Tehran, Horace James Seymour; the British Counsellor at the Legation in Tehran, Nevile Montagu Butler; and the Foreign Office. Correspondence includes: concerns raised amongst various British Government officials over the new law; a letter detailing concerns about the new law, sent by Seymour to the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Enayatollah Samiy (ff 26-28). A letter sent by Butler to the Foreign Office, dated 1 October 1936, contains an extract of French text: a portion of a memorandum written by the Armenian lawyer Raphael Aghababoff (ff 54-57).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Death penalty</topic></subject><subject><topic>Smuggling</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00003d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00003d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
