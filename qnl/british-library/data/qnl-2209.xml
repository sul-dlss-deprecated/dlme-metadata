The usual procedure, which will no doubt be followed, is that the party is met at the station (Victoria, I presume) by Major Crankshaw (the Secretary of the Government Hospitality Fund) and by a representative of the Secretary of State. Major Crankshaw then conducts the party to the hotel (I think it is to be the Hyde Park Hotel). If/ Captain T.Hickinbotham, Political Agency, Bahrein.' (B ^ 2 . If we have a draft programme from the Government Hospitality Fund by Friday I will send a copy to Bagdad to catch Belgrave there. Colonel Loch is anxious that the Sheikh should go to Scotland, but I am afraid it is unlikely that a visit can be fitted into the official programme. We are inclined to think it would be the best plan for His Excellency to go up on his own account, if he is so disposed, after the conclusion of the official visit, e.g. in the week beginning June 29th. We should, of course, be glad to assist in regard to the facilities suggested by x^ated Colonel Loch in his letter of which I enclose a copy. 25. 5.36 Perhaps you would kindly consult Belgrave and let me know by air mail if he agrees with this suggestion in principle. If so, we will start the ball rolling with the Scottish Office. The questions of an Audience, investiture, presentation of sword, etc., are being taken up in the proper quarter, but we have nothing definite as yet. There appear to be precedents for presents&lt;tions and I imagine the sword will be graciously accepted: it is possible that the King might be pleased to present a signed photograph to the Sheikh at the same time. We/3. We will let Belgrave have a line at Bagdad if anything transpires in time. Otherwise we will post him on arrival here. I am afraid there is one snag that has arisen in regard to the entertainment of the party. We understand that there is a firm rule which debars the Government Hospitality Fund from entertaining as Government guests the wives of officials in the suites of distinguished visitors - so that, while Belgrave*s hotel bill is paid, Mrs.Belgrave*s cannot be. We understand, however, that in such cases the hotel is ready to give favourable terms to the husband if he arranges to have his wife with him. Would you kindly let me know by air mail whether Mrs.Belgrave is in fact intending to be with her husband in London during the official visit - or if she is going to stay with relations or anything. If Belgrave would wish her to be with him at the hotel we could see about making provisional arrangements accordingly. We have asked the Foreign Office about the swords and daggers which the party will be carrying. So far as we can make out there is not likely to be difficulty of any kind or any necessity for special permission from the numerous countries en route. 1 /IHDIA OI^PIGE, ^ WHITEHALL, S.W.l P.Z.3473/36. 23rd May, 1936. IMMEDIAT E. Sir, 1 am directed by the Secretary of State for India to inform you that His Excellency the Sheikh of Bahrein is proposing to pay a visit to England this summer arriving about the middle of June. The Sheikh is the ruler of a state in the Persian Gulf which is of peculiar political and strategic importance to His Majesty's Government (with whom he is in special treaty relations) and his attitude towards His Majesty's Government has always been most satisfactory. The Political Besident in the Persian Gulf has recommended that His Excellency should be entertained as a guest of Government; the Government of India support this recommendation, and Lord Zetland concurs in it. As regards the period during which His Excellency should be a Government guest, Lord Zetland would have recommended on the basis of earlier precedents that the period in the present case should be one month. His Lordship understands, however, that in recent years it has been generally considered that 10 days or a fortnight was a sufficient period for the entertainment of distinguished visitors from overseas, and that the Amir Saud on his visit to this country lefet summer was .entertained officially for a period of a fortnight. He accordingly r ecommencis that the Sheikh of Bahrein should be entertained by His Majesty's Government for a fortnight from the date of his arrival in England, The Secretary, arrangements/ Government Hospitality Fund, Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1y (£) 1 2. arrangements tor his accommodation and entertainment being made by the Government Hospitality Fund during this period and charges m connection with it being debited to His Majesty's Government in accordance with the standing arrangements in force. His Lordship further suggests that among the items of entertainment might be included a Government Dinner, which need not be large, and might consist of not more than 25 - 30 persons. More detailed suggestions in regard to this matter will be made to you in due course. It is understood that His Excellency will be accompanied by about 6 persons and will have with him his European Adviser, Mr. Dalrymple Belgrave. it will therefore not be necessary to attach any special political officer to the party as was done in the case of the visit of the Sultan of Muscat in 1928. Your Department will be informed at the earliest possible moment of the precise composition of the party and the precise date of arrival. , 1 to enclose for your information a copy of a letter which is being sent to the Foreign Office.

May 25th 1936. My dear CLauson, Just a line to ask if you would kindly send me a programme of the Shaikh*s movements as soon as it is settled. In particular 1 should like to know (i) the date of the Investiture and (ii) whether he will be coming to Scotland. If he comes North, I would suggest that, even if he is no longer a Government guest, it would be greatly appreciated if Government would ask the Lord Provost of Edinburgh and the Provost of Linlithgow to show him some informal courtesy. If they could be put into touch with me, I would gladly help them. I had thought of his seeing the Castle, St. Giles and Parliament Hall in Edinburgh and the Palace in Linlithgow (after a meal with us here). I know that he would be delighted if the Railway Authorities would take him across the Forth Bridge slowly in an inspection trolley and then return below the bridge in the ferry. Possibly Stewarts and Lloyas would show him their works at Coatbridge. Yours sincerely, (SD.) G.
