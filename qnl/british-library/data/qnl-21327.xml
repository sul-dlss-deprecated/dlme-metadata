General Description. Modern Persia occupies the western and larger half of the great elevated plateau, rising between the valleys of the Indus and the Tigris. This plateau is traversed by ranges of mountains which, with few excep. tions, run with surprising regularity from the south-east to the north-west and so perfect is the air parallelism that it actually influences the direction of the atmospheric currents in all the central and western provinces. In the Bampur or south-east corner of Persia this normal north-westerly direction is broken by the eoa»t ranges, which run either from south-west to north- cast or west and east, parallel with the sea. There is a general tendency for the land to rise towards all the seaboards and towards the western and northern frontier. Between the coast ranges and the sea there are scarcely any lowland or alluvial plains, except those of Arabistan at the head of the Persian Gulf and a few strips north of Bushire and east of Bandar Abbas, but in the interior extensive level tracts everywhere occur between the parallel ridges. Those of Isfahan and Shiraz, in the west, maintain an altitude of about 5,000 feet, rising south-eastward to perhaps 6,000 ; but eastwards and north-eastwards the land falls continuously to the two great depres sions of Sistan and Khorasau, which are probably not more than 1,400 to 2,000 feet above sea-leval. Here the plains become more extensive, but also more arid, the grassy valleys gradually yielding to sandy, saline swamps and wastes. In the east a perpetual struggle for the mastery goes on between the arable tracts and the shifting sands, which latter threaten to swallow up Yazd in the very heart of the country. Still further east the sands them selves yield to dreary saline marshes, which are termed kavir. Here all the water from the surrounding streams, and from the slight rainfall, is collected in the depressions, where it forms a saline efflorescence with a thin whitish crust, beneath which the moisture is retained for a considerable time. Thus are-produced slimy quagmires, covered in winter with brine, and in summer by a thick incrustation of salt. The most extensive of these saline wastes is the Dasht-i-Kavir, which, with its southern continuation the Dasht-i-Lut, occupies a great part of Eastern Persia. The northern desert is more salt than the southern, and is apparently separated from it by a distinct water- parting. There are other large formations of a similar character, such as that west of Yazd, while the ordinary kavirs are innumerable. The rivers of Southern Persia, draining into the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, diminish in size from north-west to south-east. Thus by farthe larger are the Karkhah, Karun and Jarahi, flowing from the Kurdistan and Luristan highlands, through Arabistan, to the head of the Persian Gulf. Coast line. The southern frontier of Persia is formed by the northern coast of the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf. The eastern end of the Arabian Sea, known as the Gulf of Oman, is connected with the Persian Gulf by the Straits of Hormuz, so called after an island of that name, which lies a few miles from the Persian coast. _ . . The boundary between Persia and Baluchistan (Long. 61° 29 E.) is in Guattar Bay, a little to the westward of Kuh Darabul, a detached table- topped hill, about 500 feet high, to the north of the centre of the bay and 9 miles inland. From this point to Ras-al-Kuh the coast runs west for about 250 miles with a slight northerly trend. The country is barren, although not absolutely desert ; the shore is in parts low, with ranges of mountains some distance inland, but there are many high rocky points and hills near to the sea ; there are several villages, hut no town of any im portance, and the population is scanty. There are anchorages* in this section at Chahbar, Pazim Bay, Jask, and Ras-al-Kuh. From Ras-al-Kuh to lias Bistana the Persian coast makes a semicircular sweep for about 300 miles, first in a north-westerly direction to Bandar Abbas, and thence south-west to lias Bistana. The Oman peninsula, jutting for wards towards this recess in the Persian coast, forms with it the straits of Hormuz. The narrowest point is to the eastward of Musandam, an island on the Oman coast, whence it is only 29 miles across to the Persian shore. Ranges of high mountains, at a moderate distance from the sea, extend along the whole of this section and form good landmarks. There are villages and towns with a mixed population ; the fishermen and seafaring portion being Arab, and the cultivators, etc., chiefly Persian : most of the towns have date groves, and some cultivation near them, but other trees are scarce and small. There are several islands, the most important being Jezirat Hormuz, and Kishm or Jazirat-at-Tawila. The former is circular in shape and about 4 miles in diameter, nearly covered with hills varying from 300 to 690 feet high. Kishm, 60 miles long and from 6 to 19 miles broad, lies parallel to the coast and is separated from it by Clarence strait, which is from 1 to 6 miles in width. There are anchorages* in this section at Hormuz Island, Bandar Abbas, Larak Island, Kishm, Henjam Island, Tamb Island, Kung and Lingah. From Has Bistana to Bushire the coast runs for nearly 300 miles in a north westerly direction ; it is bold in appearance, with ranges of mountains along its whole extent, which rise, in places, close to the sea. On this part there are many towns and villages, mostly with date plantations and some cultivation, at all of which small supplies of cattle and poultry may be obtained. The maritime population is Arab; the agricultural, Persian, or a mixed race of the two. There are several islands in this section. Of these Kais, which is oval in shape, 81 miles long, east and west by 4| miles broad, is under the Shekh of Charak. Shekh Shuaib Island is about 13 miles long by 2£ wide, and is inhabited by fishermen, but some cultivation is carried on. The best anchor ages* in this section are at Mughu Bay, Charak Bay, Tawana, Kais Island, Kalat-al-Abeid, Chiru, Hindarabi Island, Bandar Basatin, Shitwar Islet, Tabiri, Kangun, Dayir, Ras-al-Mutaf and Bushire. f For details as regards anchorages, vide Section III.Kurdistan, rsian Gull, )asfc oftlt ibiaa Sea, tlie Straits uiiles fm |/ E.) isii red tatlfr i liayanJ west for s barren, ranges of mts and any im- i section ic\re,a\ar t Abbas, dug for straits of island 01 ,au shore a, eiteni re villa^ g port* the tom are scans it Horn® 3 and about o 691) fed allel to ft o 6 mildeii ndar Abba igah, iinanorlt itains alos rt theraf cultwaft ,ained. ^ draco of ^ icb isof il: the Shebl- | wide,* .besta^ iwana, \ .

Jezirat Kharag is passed 31 miles west-north-west trom Bushne. It is 4 miles long from north to south by about 2 miles broad, and has a range of table-topped bills running its whole length ; excellent water is easily procurable here from wells close to the beach. Close to Kharao is the barren uninhabited island of Khargu. There are anchorages* in this section at Kharag, Kanawa and Dilam (Bandar Dilam). Land Fkontiers. On the west the long frontier of some 700 miles, between Persia and inkey, from Mount Ararat to the Shatt-al-Arab, was roughly determined by an Anglo-Russian Commission, between the years 1843-65, as existing some where within a strip of territory varying from 20 to 40 miles in width, the actual hne being left to be determined by the two Governments implicated Hus hue, however, never has been precisely fixed. Roughly speaking the western frontier of Southern Persia runs east of Khanikin, Mendeli and Zorbatia, along the Jabal Hamrin watershed, to the west of Hawizeh and thence to the junction of the 11 afar channel with the Shatt-al-Arab, whence to the sea the Shatt-al-Arab marks the boundary between the two countries c- vr,,, east the Briti . sh Government, at the request of the Shah, appointed Sir f. Goldsmid to delimitate the Sistan-Afghan boundary in 1872 and accordingly lie carried out the task entrusted to him. Subsequently a Persian official was sent to demarcate the froutier as laid down by Sir F. Goldsmid in concert with an Afghan deputy, but the Persian Governor of Sistan obstructed the proceedings and finally dismissed the officers. The frontier as then laid down is now fully accepted, but misunderstandings regard in o- tne De mand water-supply are frequent, owing to that river havinS since changed its course. ^ The Sistan-Afghan boundary maybe taken as running in a straight line from the Kuh Siah hill, 17* miles north-east of Bandan, to the southern limit of the Naizar (formerly the reed covered area, but now bare), alono- what was formerly the main arm of the Helmaud to the Band-i-Sistan and thence in a straight line to the Kuh-i-Malik Siah, which is the meeting point of British Baluchistan, Persia, and Afghanistan. The most easterly arm. of the Helmand, which was the main arm in 1872, and which as already stated forms the frontier, now contains little or no water, the river baviuo- formed a new channel more to the west, the Rud-i-Perian, which leaves the old bed some 10 miles north of the Band-i-Sistan. The Perso-Baluch frontier, from Kuh-i-Malik Siah to Kuhak in Masbkel was delimitated by an Anglo-Persian Commission in 1896, Colonel T. h! Holdich being the British Commissioner. It runs from the Kuh-i-Malik Siah in a general south-east direction to the highest point of the Kacha Kuh. From here its direction is marked by the watershed of the Mirjawa range, the junction of the Talab and Mirjawa rivers and the bed of the Talab river, to a point on the Hamun-i-Mashkel •For details as regards anchorages, vide Section III,4 Am.t 1 mile east of the Gorani date groves, from wh.eh point it runs a little north of east for 11 miles and then turns south, jnaiuUin.o| this latter direction as far as the western end of the mam watershed of the S.ahan range.

Ihe boundaiy then t rns east along the main watershed of the Siahan range, and thence along the watershed of a subsidiary range, which runs m a south-east direction from the Siahan to Grawag. From here the south-east direction is continued to a hill on the right or south bank of the Mashkel, about 6 mi es above he -function of the Mashkel and Rakshan rivers. From this point the bed o he Mashkel river defines the boundary to a hill on the left or north bank of the river, about 1| miles below the junction of the Gazbastan stream with the Mashkel, and almost immediately south of Kuhak fort. The third section, from Kuhak in Mashkel to Guattar on the coast, being the Perso-Makran frontier, was defined with great difficulty by bir ih Goldsmid in 1871 and is generally observed. It runs for the first 22 miles in a straight line, a little east of south, to the Persian village of Patkuk. It then turns west along the Sagarkand and Hindwan watersheds, leaving the village of Kullan on the Persian side, to the Hindwan pass. Here it turns south and south-east to Sham, from which point it runs along the bed o£ the Kuluchki river to its junction with the Hamzoi torrent. It now follows the bed of the Hamzoi torrent and the watersheds of the Shiraz and Talar hills to the westernmost peak of the Nakuh range, in the vicinity of the Persian village of Peshin. From here the boundary runs along the water-parting of the Mazan Kaur and Dasbt rivers to the junction of the Kastag and Ghistan torrents. From here it runs to the northernmost Jambki peak, continuing westward along the ridge connecting the two Jambki peaks and the Puru hill. The line then follows the waterparting between the Kalaki and Saman torrents to the southernmost ridge of the Jambki hills, ana continues thence slightly west of the Darabul or Drabhol hills to about the centre of Guattar Bay. Mountain system. The main characteristics of the relief of the land and the normal direction of the mountain ranges have already been given on page 1. The general elevation of the mountains of Persia is far greater than was formerly supposed. The most extensive and loftiest range appears to be the Kuh- i-Dinar, traversing the western province of Fars, in the normal direction, at an elevation of perhaps 17,000 to 18,000 feet. Although unexplored, it is perfectly visible from the Persian Gulf at a distance of 130 miles over intervening coast ranges known to be 10,000 feet high. In travelling from Shustar to Isfahan, across the Bakhtiari country, 10 mountain ridges have to be crossed by passes varying from over 1,000 to 8,650 feet. In South-East Persia the great ranges Kuh-i-Lalazar and Kuh-i-Hazar are continued eastwards by a high range, under various names, holding up the Iian plateau in this part of Persia. Detached from it is Kuh-i-Bazman, while further to the east, in Sarhad, is the volcanic Kuh-i-Taftan or Kub-i- Chehel Tan, still in the solfatara stage.Rivers. From the Kuh-i-Rang or Jehan-Bin, a mountain cluster nearly 13,000 feet high, in the heart of the Bakhtiari country, spring the two most famous rivers iu Persia, the Karun, a corruption of Kuh-i-Rang, on the south, and the Zaindah Rud on the east. The former drains towards the Persian Gulf, the latter flows past Isfahan and eventually becomes lost in the Gav- khaneh, more commonly known as the Kavh-i-Isfandiran, a salt marsh lying midway between Isfahan and Yazd. The head waters of the Karun are in a peak called Haft Tanan. Fourteen miles lower down is a spring in the Zardah Kuh, called Sar-Chashma-i-Kurang, from which a great volume of water rushes out of a hole in the bare cliff and joins the main bed, 5 miles distant. From here to Shustar, a distance of 75 miles as the crow flies, the Karun follows a sinuous course of 250 miles, falling 9,000 feet in the interval. Its normal width, even in its upper reaches, is from 50 to 100 yards, but it is sometimes compressed between perpendicular walls 1,000 to 3,000 feet high, whilst in one place, at the bridge of Ali Kuh, its volume is contracted within a rift only 9 feet across. For the first 100 miles of its course it runs south-east. Then, with a sharp bend, it turns south-west and cuts a 50-mile channel through transverse ranges ; after that for nearly 100 miles more it flows north-west, in a direction inverse, but parallel, to its original course ; it then turns south, enters the plain of Akili by a gorge, crosses the Kuh-i-Fedelek above Shustar, by means of another defile, and finally debouches upon the plains of Arabistan. The most important of its tributaries, in this upper section, is the Ab-i-Bazuft, or Rudbar, which flows from the north-west in a bed running almost parallel with its own upper waters. Other noticeable confluents are a river from the east receiving the over flow of the Chighakhor lake, and a stream from the north, called Ab-i- Beheshtabad, or Darkash Warkash, which drains the Chahar Mahal. The Ab-i-Sabz (also called Dahinur, Dinaran and Ab-i-Gurab) flows in near Dopulan. The Ab-i-Bors, from the lofty Kuh-i-Dinar range, flows in from the south. From this point to Shustar are many smaller tributaries, including several salt or naphtha tainted streams. Attempts have been made, in the past, to divert the waters of the Karun to the bed of the Zaindah Rud. This project was initiated by Shah Abbas in the 16th century. Major Sawyer estimat ed that less than one-twentieth of the entire work had been completed before its abandonment. Emerging from the hills immediately to the north of Shustar the river bifurcates ; the Ab-i-Shateit, or Karun proper, turns sharply to the south, while the Ab-i-Gargar, an artificial canal, bends to the east, the 2 streams reuniting at Band-i-Kir. Here also the Karun receives its main affluent, the Ab-i-Diz or Dizful river. At the point of confluence the Ab-i-Diz is about 80 yards wide, the Ab-i-Sbateit about 150, and the Ab-i-Gargar about 60. The Ab-i-Diz is joined, at a point 12 miles above Band-i-Kir, by the Shapur or Shaur river, a tributary which formerly flowed direct into the Karun, joining it at one time a little below Wais and at a later period near Ahwaz. From Band-i-Kir to Ahwaz the river is open to steam traffic, but between there and Bandar Nasri the channel is interrupted, and naviga tion is impeded, by the Ahwaz rapids. At Muhammera the Hafar, a channel 2 miles long, connects the Karun with the Shatt-al-Arab. The Bah- mishir, the original mouth of the Karun, runs down to the Persian Gulf from a point about 2 miles above Muhammera, parallel to the Shatt-al-Arab,G There is a rise an ! fall of tide of about 9 feet, and the water throughout ilfH course is rumoured to be growing shallower. Between 10 and 12 miles above the Bahmishir is a third, dried up, bed of the Karun, the Karun-el-Amieh. The Kaban or Gobban canal runs from the Karun-el-Amieh to Falahiah, on the Jarahi river. This canal is said to be still navigable for small native boats, at seasons, up to Falahia. The Karkhah rises in 3 branches, all east of Karmanshah. The three united streams, under the name of the Gamasiab river, wind in a general westerly direction to Besatun, where the Ab-i-Dinawar joins in from the north. It then flows south, south-west and eventually south-east through Luristan, being fed in its course by many streams of more or less volume, including the Kara Su, the Karind river and the Ab-i-Shirwan from the west and the Kashghan or Madian Bud and the Ab-i-Zal from the east. Eight miles above its junction with the latter stream it flows through a chasm 150 feet deep and so narrow that a Kurd leaped across it in the presence of Major Bawlinson. There is a bridge here known as the Pul-i-Tang. In Luristan the Karkhah is known as the Saidmarra river. It leaves the mountains west of Dizful within TO miles of the Ab-i-Diz. At this spot it is a rapid mountain stream, and, at its entrance into the plain, was formerly crossed by a bridge, the remains of which are Pa-i-Pul. The road from Zorbatia to Dizful crosses the river here. The fords are dangerous and constantly changing, the safest point varying accord ing to the season of the year. The river is lowest from June to October. The Karkhah now quits the direction of Dizful, and takes a more southerly course for about 40 miles to the ruins of Karkhah-i-Aiwan. At this point it divides itself into four branches, and is easily fordable in summer and autumn. A little south of this spot, it bends west of south, and con tinues in this direction through the rich plain of Arabistan, becoming lost eventually in the marshes which surround Hawizeh. Formerly the Karkhah had two outlets into the Tigris, one by the A1 Khud bed at Amara, the other a little below Kurnah into the Shatt-al-Arab ; but these appear now, as a rule, to be dry. The water of the Karkhah in the upper part of its course is celebrated for its purity. The Jarahi, Gerahi, or Jalahi, rises under the name of the Kurdistan river, at Sadat in the Kubgehlu hills. Thence it flows south, and passes the ruins of Kurdistan (where it already has a breadth of about 350 feet), and the village of Deb Dasht, through Tang-i-Tekab (Tang-i-Teka), a narrow defile, into the plain of Behbahan, through which it winds about 4 miles from the town.* Thence it flows north-west, as far as Kbalifahabad, south of Bam Hormuz, where it is joined by the Ab-i-Ala, or Alai river (Ab-i-Ram Hormuz ? ) and shortly after by the Tazang river. From this point it takes the name of Jarahi, and becomes a broad deep stream, not at any period of the year fordable,* flowing between steep and high mud banks to the south-west. It now divides into two branches—one of which, generally termed the Nahr Busi, runs into the sea at Khor Musa, near Bandar Mashur; the second continuing its course through Falahia (or Dorak) is eventually lost in irrigation, except a small artificial channel, the Dorak canal, which finds its way into the Karun, at Sablah, 10 miles above Muhammera. The upper portion of this river, as far as the junction * Between Belibaban and Javzun it is fordable in several places.7 The tb Q a genecJ 1 the norll, 1 Luristsu, iludingtli t and t!i Sight milii a 150 f« i of Majoi t Lurista 's of tk s entrant which are ere.

Tt is navigable from the junction of the Ab-i-i\.la for country hoats. The 1 ah, Ilindian or Zohreh river lias its source from two main branches. The northernmost of these, the Khairabad river, rises, with many tributaries, in the Kuhgehlu hills and flows in a general south-west direction. The southernmost and larger branch rises in the Kuh-i-Anar, north-west of Shiraz.^ In its upper reaches it is known as the Shaspi and lower down as the Zohreh river. Flowing at first in a north-west direction, through the iang-i-Khast, it reaches the Telespid plain, and again entering the hills gradually changes its course to west and south-west, joining the Khairabad river near Zaitun, nearly midway between Behbahan and Bandar Dilam. After traversing an outer range of sandstone hills, it falls into the Gulf about 15 miles south-west of Hindian, to which town it is navigable by small vessels rip to 20. tons. Its breadth is about 80 yards at Hindian in February, and it is not fordable till some 9 miles higher up. In passing through the lovy hills south of Zaitun its water becomes tainted and bitter, and is scarcely drinkable at Hindian. The Ruhilla, Rudhilla or Shat-ban-i-Lemini is a stream in Pars, which iises in the vicinity of Kaia Safed and traverses Shahpur. In the plains it is fordable only at times near the village of Kala Sirhan. It is there a sluggish stream, 100 yards wide, 3 feet 6 inches deep, with a firm sandy bottom, flowing between banks 12 feet high. Lakes. The Daria-i-Mahalu, elevation 5,000 feet, is a salt lake to the south-east of Shiraz, some 20 miles in length, into which flows the stream irrio-ating the Shiraz plain. ” The Daria-i-Niriz, or Bakhtegan, lies further to the north-east. It is very fantastic in form, being almost divided into two lakes by a big project ing promontory hitherto unexplored. The northern portion is known as Lake Tasht or Nargiz and the southern as Lake Niriz. Its chief confluent is tlm Band Amir or Kur river, formed by the united streams of the Polvar and Faruab or Puruab, both of which flow from a north-west direction. The Gavklianeh, or more correctly the Kavir-i-Isfandiran, is a salt marsh, to the north-west of Yazd, which eventually receives the waters of the Zaiudah Rud, after they have irrigated the Isfahan province. The Hamun-i-Helmand, to the north of Sistan, is a lake formed by the waters of the Helmand. Formerly the waters of the Harut Rud and the Farrah Rud, flowing from the north, formed a second lagoon, but this has not been the case for many years, these two rivers now giving little or no water. P 1 or 6 months in the year there is no water except in the western corner of the Hamun, which is known as the Daria-i-Sahri. The Jaz Morian lies betwen Bampur and Kahnu, and receives the drainage of the surrounding country, the Haliri, Bampur and other rivers becommo- lost in it. In the spring it is of considerable extent but in the late summed and early autumn it is generally dry. 2.—HARBOURS. Chahbar.— ^. 25° 17'0' N. Long. 60° 37' 30' Chalibar Bay is a great hay or inlet, 7| miles broad at the entrance, by 10 miles in depth. The shore on both sides is rocky, with cliffs in places, to about 4&lt; miles inside the entrance, but the whole of the rest is low and swampy.A range of mountains runs about parallel with the coast 8 miles inland, upon which is a conspicuous quoin-shaped peak, 2,400 feet high, which bears about north by west from the middle of the bay. Chahbar point is low and rocky with sand hills, off which a rocky spit extends for three cables, the coast to the eastward of it is a low cliff rising towards Kmj, On the extremity of Chahbar point is a small square tomb, and the shore thence trends to north-eastward for l mile, forming a little bay, at the head of which stands the town of Chahbar. The south side of this little bay is shoal with rocky bottom for two cables from the shore, as far as a small date clump just outside the fort. Beyond these trees, near which is the best landing, the beach is sandy. The land rises close to the northward of Chahbar town to a high tableland, the south brow of which is 840 feet high, and almost precipitous in places. Its base is on the north side of the little bay in which the town lies, and forms cliffs near the sea, extending from 11 miles north of the town to Tiz point, acliff of light colour, 210 feet high. The cliffs fall back to the north-east from this point, and become the south side of a great valley in the hills, upon the north side of which are higher cliffs, which trend to the eastward, leaving the shore low and swampy. The fort is square with towers at the angles, and is 300 yards from the shore; around it lies the town. Close to the southward are gardens with many fruit trees and a few date palms, extending for a mile inland. At a short distance to the north-east of the fort is a large white tomb with a dome, conspicuous from the sea. The place is said to be healthy. In 1897 the population was about 2,500, which, with its trade, will prob* ably increase. Supplies .—Good water at the telegraph office^ brought through pipes;, good water also in wells among the gardens. Sheep and bullocks can be procured from the country by waiting for them ; also vegetables, fish, etc. No coal can be obtained. Transport .—Garmsir or a Dasht ” camels in abundanee, but not close at hand owing to absence of grazing. Telegraph .—At half a mile south of the town is the telegraph office, avail able for messages to all countries. It is a fine building with flat roof and can be seen across the land when to south-eastward of the place. At present a detachment, of 50 Indian native troops, is stationed at Chahbar to protect the telegraph buildings. Anchorage .—The anchorage is with the tomb on Chahhar point S., and the white dome E. to E. by S. in 4 fathoms, sand, 1 mile off-shore. Native ves sels anchor in 2 fathoms about half a mile from shore. There is good anchorage during north-westers, on the west side of the bay, in 4 fathoms, 4 cables off-shore, with. Kuhlab point bearing S. Caution —Chahbar point should be given a bertli of 7 cables when pass ing, to avoid the spit extending from it. In the valley north of Tiz point, about a mile from the sea, is a mud fort with a few huts and some trees and cultivation. At the entrance of the valley there is a small hill, on which a Persian fort is built, and in front of this a shallow lagoon, which can only be entered by fishing boats at high water. From Tiz the coast is low and swampy all round the head of the bay; at 6 miles from Tiz point is the mouth of Khor Namak, which becomes a small \ river after rain. / Has Kuhlab (called Has Mutahaddim on the chart), the west point of Chahbar Bay, is of low cliffs, and has no reef off it; from it the cliffs tread9 for two (a !

There is a good anchorage in north-westers in 4&gt; fathoms, half a mile off shore, with the point bearing S. Soundings. —The depth at the entrance of Chahbar Bay is 8 fathoms and decreases regularly to 6 fathoms off Tiz point, muddy bottom. To northward of this point a rocky bank runs out for 3 miles, having 2 fathoms on its edge and 4 fathoms outside; it extends to northward for about 5 miles. Ras- Kuhlab has 3 fathoms at 2 cables from the beach, with 5 fathoms at 7 cables, and the cliffs north of it have T fathoms at half a mile, but beyond them the west and north sides of Chahbar Bay are shoal, there being only 3 fathoms 2 miles from the shore. Tides. —It is high water, at full and change, about 9 h. 30 m., springs rise 9 feet. The stream is not perceptible. Pazim Ba’v, about 21 miles W. N. W. of Chahbar, lies between the two promontories, Ras Pazim and Ras Rashidi. It has 5 fathoms water in the entrance, which soon lessens towards the low shore at the bottom. A vessel may anchor in this bay in 4 fathoms, mud, close to the point, with Rashidi east extreme bearing S. S. YV. Ja.sk. — Lat. 25^ 38' 19' N., long. 57° 45' 40' lA—Jask east bay is the great bight between Ras Jagin and Cape Jask. The east side of the bay is low, the sandy beach drying off upwards of half mile, opposite the entrances of the creek. Khor Lash is a large creek 8 miles north-west of Ras Jagin. At the head of the bay the hills approach within a mile of the shore, and the coast range ends here in a ridge of white cliffs called Kuh Ushadan, 1,720 feet high, which from the westward has a quoin shape. There is a hamlet, with a few date-trees, lying between it and the sea. The west side of the bay is rocky, about 15 feet above the sea, and level, with a sandy beach, scattered rocky ledges, and low cliffs in places. It ex tends in a N. E. by E. | E., direction from Jask point to the head of the bay. Anchorage. —East of Cape Jask there is good anchorage and shelter from westerly winds all along this side, close to the shore, in 8 or 9 fathoms, the 20 fathom line being miles off. The bay is open to the eastward,’and there is generally a light surf on the beach, which becomes heavy during the monsoon, although there may be only a slightly perceptible ground svvelh The anchorage east of Caj)e Jask is good during a shamal, when the wind would be about west. Much swell would roll round the point, and make a ship very uneasy. In a winter easterly gale it would be quite ex posed. A vessel, to avoid fouling the telegraph cables, should not anchor south-west of the line of the stone beacon near the cable house in one with the telegraph building's flag staff, which is 80 feet high. The beacon is 30 feet high and painted in black and white bands. . The East. Bay is only used during N. IE. gales, when landing is impossible in the West Bay ; on such occasions the best landing p]a3e is on the sandy beach, which commences at the cable house and extends for 1 mile to the cliffs. The principal and best anchorage however is in the West Bay. Cagie Jask {Maksa) is the south-west extreme of a low projecting cape dividing the bay just described from a great bay on its west side, known as Jask Bay or Jask west bay. It has a small rudely built tomb, 15 feet above high water, on its extreme point.10 There is a little rocky point in Jask Bay nearly 2 a north of the tomb, beyond which the coast forms a small bay, where there is good andin ? i mile north of the telegraph office. Between the tomb and the landing place, a shallow flat extends N. W. by W. ^ W. from a distance of 1 \ miles off shore, with 3 fathoms on its outer edge and fathoms inside. Telegraph. —A range of telegraph buildings, in three blocks, stands half a mile north-east of the tomb. Messages can be sent from here to all parts. At present a detachment, of 50 Indian native troops, is stationed at Jask to protect the telegraph buildings. A fortified residence has been built near the landing place for the Persian Governor, who has a guard of 4-0 soldiers. Supplies. —The best water is got from wells, 1 mile north-east of the telegraph office, near some conspicuous date groves. There is also a good supply of rain water, stored in reservoirs near the telegraph buildings. A considerable village is situated on the west shore, extending from the telegraph buildings north for about a mile. A few sheep, fowls and vege tables can be got, but not in large quantities. Fish plentiful. There is fortnightly communication by the Persian Gulf mail steamers with India and the Gulf. Jask west bay. —From the landing place the shore is of low sand-hills, and runs north for 3£ miles to the entrance of Jask creek ; it then curves round to the north-west and west, having sand-hills for the first 3 miles, after which it is a mere strip of low sand all the way to Ras-al-Kuh, with mangrove swamps inside it, and admitting several creeks; the largest of these, Khor Hamad, 8 miles east of Ras-al-Kuh, is frequented by boats. At a considerable distance inland may be seen many^ date groves scattered along the coast. The bar of Jask creek is almost dry at low water, and it has dry sands nearly half a mile off the mouth, but the water is deeper inside, and the inlet is used by native boats. It has a winding course of 4 or 5 miles, the land near it being a man grove swamp. Anchorage.—^etsi of Cape Jask. On the west side of Cape Jask a con venient anchorage, for vessels not drawing more than 16 feet, is with Capo Jask bearing south in 3^ fathoms, three-quarters of a mile off-shore. A beacon, made of three posts with a large square board, black with white disc, has been erected on the shore as a guide to the anchorage; when bearing S.&lt;-E. by E f E„ it leads clear of the north end of the flat. Jask fort is 6^ miles N. £ E. from the old tomb ; it is now quite ruinous, with a few houses and date-trees near it, and a range of white sand hills to the south-east. It stands 1 mile from the coast. There are about 200 men here, cultivators and herdsmen. A small traffic with Maskat is carried on. Tides. —It is high water, fall and change, at 9 h. 30 m.; rise and fall 9 feet. r Ihe stream is weak, the flood setting to the westward; it increases ia strength as Ras-al-Kuh is approached. Ras-al-Kuh is a very low point, about 29 miles W. N, VV. of Cape Jask, at which the coast suddenly changes its direction to N. N. W. All the land for several miles inland is swampy, except the low strip of sand forming the shore. A vessel may anchor a mile to the south-east of the point, and half a mile off-shore, in 6 to 10 fathoms, but there is little or no shelter in a shatnal, which blows here about west by north. Jezirat Hormuz is an island of circular shape, about 12 miles south east of Bandar Abbas. It is about 4 miles in diameter and is nearly covered with hills, most of which are about 300 feet high, one sharp peak near the centre 01 the island being 690 feet. The present village of Hormuz is built11 ]e nortlolj is ^ooiilail: wl tlielaaii 'imilisi sWsli 'e to alljr DnedatJasl &gt;eeti built 8 t tO soil® ith-east oft ; is’alsoa;: ildings, ding fromt )wls and fg mail st« Band-bills,* uryes roaal after wlic: agrovesra lor Hamai rable dista ,, Tbek rly half a it sed by wti being a® i0 Jaak a c is wilt Ca ire, Ab® disc, bask S/E. by 1 is DOW f ,f whites ,re aboiii* is carried ' rise aids i increa® 1 W. of &amp; W, Alf sand for®- iint,aods shelter 11 niles ^ arly £&lt;!fi ea L'near'' ouz^' alraorst entirely of mat huts, and contains approximately 400 men^ who are employed in fishing and collecting salt. They have about 20 fishing boats, and a few larger craft, which trade to Maskat and Bandar Abbas, chiefly with salt and salt fish. There is a guard of a dozen men in the fort. In the hot months most of the in habitants leave the island for Minab (Minau), where they are employed in the date harvest. Little is to be got here ; there is water only in reservoirs, generally in very small quantity, that coming down from the hills being saturated with brine. J/ic/wrage.—The anchorage is with the fort about West, half a mile off, in 4 to 5 fathoms, mud, or nearer for small vessels, It is quite sheltered from every wind, except the nashi, for which the native boats shift round to the westward of the fort. I he strait, between the fort and mud flat extending off the mainland, is 8 cables wide, with a depth of 10 fathoms j the flat on the north side of the strait is deep-to, the channel being at this part close to the island. Nearly all round the island there are 5 to 7 fathoms close to the edge of the icef, and 12 fathoms 2 to 3 miles off on the south and east side, so that the soundings are a sufficient guide approaching it, but there is deep Water close to the flat that extends from the west side of the island. Caution is necessary when approaching Hormuz as it is very indifferently surveyed and the soundings are scanty. Bandar Abbas (Lat. 27° 10' 29' iV., long. 56' 16' 47' E.) is a large town to the north-west of Hormuz Island. It stands on the beach and has •A front of about half a mile. The Governor resides in a large fortified building, with a wall and towers, which is in good repair. It is a place of great trade and has a peculiarly fluctuating population, as during the hot season (which is here almost insupportable), most of the population migrate to Minab, etc. During the cold season there may be 8,000 to 9,000 inhabitants. The landing at low water is bad, as the beach dries off a long way. There is a wharf in front of the custom house. Communications. —Bandar Abbas is the port of Karman ; many baghalas belong to it or call here on their way from Bushire to Bombay. The Persian Gulf steamers call here weekly both on the up and down passage; there is a British post office. There is also a weekly (Persian) post to Karman and Yazd. Supplies. —Cattle, vegetables and rice are procurable, forage scarce and dear. Water, fair, from Naoband, 2| miles distant. The bazar is a good one No coal. Anchorage .—The anchorage is in 4 or 5 fathoms, mud, about 2 miles from the shore, according to draught, With the centre of the town bearino- N. W. by N. Small ships can anchor closer in during fine weather. The hold^ ing ground is good and the roadstead well sheltered, except from the south east. Larak Island is miles long by 3£ broad, of oval shape, with a low sandy point on the north side. It is barren and covered with rugo- e d hills. On the north side there is an unfinished fort and a little vilkTo-e containing about 80 fishermen. The anchorage, on the north side between the low point and the village, is in 13 fathoms, about £ a mile off-shore, it is sheltered only from the shamal and is not generally recommended. Kishm is a large and well built Arab town, situated to the north of the easternmost point of Jezirat-at-Tawila, and contains about 4,000 inhabitants. Near the south end is an old Portuguese fort which is conspicuous from seaward. Supplies. —Water is easily procured from wells near the beach, and cattle, vegetables, etc., can be obtained.12 Anchorage.—Vast of the town there are several banks of rock and sand frith and 3 fathoms on them, the outer of which is U miles ofi-shoie ; this shoal is quite steep-to on the outside, and has 5 to 7 fathoms ^wee it and the beach. There is also a $4 fathoms rocky patch, a quarter of a mile east of the town, frith 7 fathoms close to it. At 1 mile south of the town shoal water extends half a mile from the shore. # The anchorage for vessels of moderate draught is with the Poituglese fort south, about three-quarters of a mile off, in 4 or 5 fathoms, mud, in ap proaching which a vessel would have to pass over 3^ fathoms. Larger vessels must anchor about 1 \ miles off-shore in 6 fathoms. ^ The anchorage is well sheltered in a shamal, and there is no heavy sea with a nasfii. . T&gt; . . , + , . Jezirat Henjam is a barren hilly island south of Kishm. It is 5 mi es long and broad. Near the north end is a remarkable table-like hill, o. U feet high, which is visible 20 miles, but does not show from the southward. The hills decrease in height towards the south end of the island, which is comparatively low. There are 2 small ruined mosques near the north point, the easternmost frhite, the other red. There is a large Arab village near the eouthern part, the people of which own a number of pearl boats and keep some goats. The island is covered with coarse grass and brushwood. After rain some water can be had from the ruined reservoirs at the north end, and there is a well of fairly good water near the village, about a quarter of a mile from the south-east point of the island. Oysters are to be got on the rocks at lofr water. A few provisions may be obtained. There is anchorage with the low north point bearing W., 3 cables from the shore, in 9 fathoms, sand; this is sheltered from all the prevailing winds, but the bottom is hard, and a vessel is liable to drag her anchor; especially as the tides are strong, with an eddy close in, during the ebb. The anchorage to the W. of the N; point, with the red tomb bearing S., is generally preferable, the bottom being more regular. This anchorage is partly sheltered from the shamal, which blows from the south-west, or a vessel may shift from one side of the spit to the other, if necessary. Baside is a village on the north-west point of Kishm Island, containing a population of about 350 ; it belongs to the British. There are three (ioveni- meut water reservoirs and a jetty, extending to low water mark. A few provisions may be procured. Good water is obtainable only in limited quan tities. Parallel to Basidu point, and about 4 cables from the shore, there is a deep gut of 12 to 16 fathoms, in which ships should avoid anchoring. The be§t anchorage is just inside the gut, on the belt about 2 cables in breadth, which lies between it and the 3 fathoms contour line, in 7 to 5 fathoms at low water, and either opposite the jetty, or thence as far as the store-house, about 3£ cables off shore. The bottom is clay, very good holding ground. It is advisable to moor, as the winds blow strong against the tides, and a vessel is apt to foul her anchor. Jezirat Tanb is 165 feet high and 2 miles across. The best anchorage is on the south side of the island in 6 or 7 fathoms. A vessel might also anchor on the east side, in 10 fathoms, half a mile off-shore, when she would have less tide and be sheltered from the shamal, but exposed to the nashi. Jezirat Abu Musa is an island of rectangular shape, about 2| miles long by 1£ broad. The anchorage is indifferent, being in deep water; the b^-st is off the south-east corner in 12 fathoms, very close in.IB and gg les oS-sIok •ms ^rterofaii: of the In e Portoji s, miidjb oms, Lai;: no heavji It is 5 sij like hill, I southwai island, wit north pi lage near ft ats and he rod. voirs at ft age, aboo! •s are to: tables fro ng band ; especial e ancliorai is genera tly sheltei ty sliiftfa ; contains ,hree nark, M imited q® re, there I boring, J js in hresi 1 5 fatbo® 1 ie store'^ ding f ie tides, 111 Kung is a large fishing village, 3^ miles north-east of Lingali. It extends for half a mile along the sandy shore, is chiefly built of mat huts, and contains between 2,000 and 3,000 inhabitants, who own many boats. The anchorage is in 5 fathoms, mud, miles off the shore, and is sheltered from all winds except the suhaili. At one time an important Portuguese trading centre. Lingah {Lat. 26° 33' 5' N., Long-. 54° 53' 45' E.), one of the most Nourishing towns on the Persian coast, is well built, extending in a narrow strip a mile along the shore, and surrounded by date palms, with a further cluster of houses a little way inland. It contains about 1,200 inhabitants. The town is partially defended on the land side by an insignificant wall with towers, outside of which there are many domed water cisterns. A breakwater has been built in front of the town, inside which baghatas and boats lie at low water. A native agent of the British Government resides here, also an a^ent for the British mail steamers and a post master* The Persian Gulf Tuail steamers call here weekly* Supplies.-—Qtoo&lt;\ water is obtainable, also cattle, poultry, vegetables, rice flour, etc. Firewood Can be procured but not enough for steam purposes. * Anchorage is in 5 fathoms, 6 cables off-shore, the holding ground o-ood clay bottom ; it is sheltered from all winds except the suhaili, Close outside the anchorage is a khor y or belt of deeper water, with 7 and 8 fathoms beyond which it shoals again to 5| fathoms. Ships can also anchor off Jisha (about 3 miles south-west of Lingah) in 4 fathoms, clay, about 6 cables off-shore. There is also anchorage off Bistana (15 miles west-south-west of Lingah), quite close in to the shore, in 4 fathoms; boats are partly sheltered from the sh&amp;mal, but a ship can get but little shelter. Muguu is a large bay lying between Ras Bistana and Ras Yavid ; it is free from danger and affords good anchorage in all winds but the suhaili • the holding ground is good, being mud, and the water under 10 fathoms. ^ The shore is low and sandy, with a rocky beach towards Ras Bistana, the laud sloping gradually up from it to the foot of the Bistana and Yarid hills between which the slope ends, 2 or 3 miles from the coast, in precipitous broken ground. In this bay are the towns of Duan and Mughu. Ras ifarid is a low broad cape, with no definite point, the coast bendino- round very gradually. On this cape is a rugged mass of dark coloured volcanic hills called Jebel Yarid (elevation 1,200 feet) visible for 35 miles. From Ras Yarid the coast bends round to the east and east-north-east' to wards Mughu. The town has several round towers and a date grove behind. The anchorage, for a shamal, is opposite the town close in, 4 fathoms, nearly a mile off-shore, bottom clay. Water maybe obtained here, also cattle, and a few vegetable, etc. ^ Charak Bay. From Ras Yarid the coast sweeps round north-west for 10 miles to the town of Charak, and then turns west-south-west for 4 miles to Tawana point, forming Charak Bay, the soundings in which are under 10 fathoms and regular. Charak contains about 1,000 men and sends 100 boats to the pearl fishing* Good water is procurable here. The town has several towers and a grove of date-trees behind it, over which stands a small fort on a hillock north of the town. The anchorao’e is in 4 fathoms, mud, with Tawana point W. \ S. and the hill fort about N. by E. Some swell is felt here in a shamal. la easterly winds the shelter is good. A small vessel can also anchor off Tawana, 4 miles west-south-west of Charak.14 Kais, an island of oval shape, 8| miles long by 4^ broad, lies 9 miles off the mainland to the west of Charak. The north-east point is low and sanely and has a large village on it, called M ishi. The best anchorage is off Mashi point. Jirza is a small village on the mainland, about 131 miles west of Tawana. It is situated in a bay, where shelter can be found from a shamal } by a vessel anchoring close in under the land. Kalat-al-Abeid is a village On the coast, 4^ miles south-west of Jirza. The anchorage, close to the shore, in 4 to 5 fathoms, sand, is sheltered from the shamali and partly also from the ndshi. Chiru is a Small town, with a fort and large date grove, situated in a bay formed by a projecting: low sandy point. It is a capital anchorage and easy of access in a shamal, but exposed to easterly winds ; it is clear of danger, with soundings under 10 fathoms. Hindarabi Island, opposite Chiru, is 4 miles long by 2 broad. There is a small walled village near the centre of the north shore, off which a vessel might anchor iu 6 or 7 fathoms, rocky bottom, but this would be exposed to the shamal. Bandar Basatin is the name given to a low point, projecting from the rocky hills, about 25 miles north-west of Chiru. Vessels can anchor about half a mile to the east of this point, sheltered from the skamal and other pre vailing winds. Shekh Shuatb Island and Shttwar Islet lie south of Bandar Basatin. A vessel may find shelter by anchoring off the north-east or north-west extremity of Shekh Shuaib, according to the direction of the wind. Shiwu is a village on the coast, 14 miles west-north-west of Bandar Basatin. The anchorage here is said to be tolerably sheltered from a shamal if close in. Bandar Baid Khan is a sandy point on the north coast of Naband Bay, about 35 miles north-west of Shiwu. To the east of this point is a bay, where small vessels can anchor in a shamal. Tahiri is a village in a small bay, 21 miles north-west of Bandar Baid Khan. By anchoring close to the shore, in about 6 fathoms, a vessel would be sheltered in a shamal, but there is little or no shelter against the south-easter; the holding ground is good, Dayir is a moderate sized town, in a slight hay, 25 miles west-north-west of Tahiri. There is excellent anchorage here in a shamal, in 8 to 10 fathoms, | to 1 mile off-shore, with muddy bottom. It would be quite open to the kam. Auli is a village on the coast 2| miles west of Dayir. A vessel may anchor here, in 6 or 8 fathoms, | a mile off-shore. 1 Ras-al-Mutae is a great shoal which extends to the south-east and east for 18 miles. Vessels can anchor off the tail of Mutaf bank, quite sheltered from the shamal, \n 4 or 5 fathoms. There is no good shelter from the shamal between this and Bushire. Bushire (Abu Shahr), (Lat. 28° 59' 7'' N., Long. 50° 50' 3' R, of Resi- dency flag staff), the principal seaport of Persia, is a town of about 15 000 inhabitants and occupies a low point of land at the north end of the Bushire peninsula, which is 11 miles in length from the town to Ras Halila and 3 miles broad m the centre. The peninsula is separated from the mainland by the mashila, a salt water swamp, 12 4 miles long by 3 to 6 broad, inundated by the sea at high tides.

On the land side there is a wall with many tower? useless for defence. I he town stands on a rocky ridge, which does not exceed 40 feet m height; a large badgir, with its top 90 feet above the sea, is the highest building in the place, and maybe seen at a distance of 10 miles, ihe landing place is at the embankment in the creek, along which wharves are built, where baghalaz discharge their cargo. The Residency is a laro-e building at the south-west corner, with a flag staff close to it, near which are the flagstaffs of the Dutch and Turkish consuls. The Persian Governor’s residence is a square fort at the south-east corner. ^ ^ eet k’fgh, begin near the Residency, and extend south by west half a mile from the town, forming a broad point, called Ras-ash-Sha^ab neaily 4 miles south-south-west of the town. Mufka, 2 miles from the town is a small fishing village, between which and the Residency cliffs, the shore forms a shallow sandy bay. A tower, 40 feet high, intended for a lighthouse has been built just to the north of the village, which is a good mark when making for the inner anchorage. From Ras-ash-Shagab the coast trends gradu ally south-south-east for about 2 miles to Rishire point, which is of low cliff the north-west point of a small bay, having cliffs all round. On these are the* mounds of Rishire fort, 80 to 90 feet above the sea. The telegraph cable bouse, painted white, stands on Rishire point, on the east side of which there islanding in calm weather. . A he telegraph buildings, with flag staff, about § mile inland are con spicuous. Imamzada tomb or mosque, about 150 feet above the sea, standsina little village, on the highest part of the peninsula, about a mile north-east of Rishire fort. Outside the walls of Bushire, the ground is swampy, and is overflowed at extraordinary high tides, for upwards of a mile to the south except a narrow strip along the west coast. South of Imamzada the land is very broken as far as Halila. The east coast of the peninsula runs from the town in a curve for miles to Ras Fudar, which is about 30 feet high. From here the edge of the swamp (or mashila) runs south-south-east for nearly *5 miles to a low point. Along the belt of land, between the swamp and the rising o-round towards Imamzada, are groves of date-trees and cultivation. The caravans cross the swamp to the mainland, about a mile to the north of the point. A little to the south of the point there is a small fort and village called Tan^ak from which the edge of the swamp runs to the south behind Halila Bay! To the north-east of Fudar, and separated from it by the creek, is the swampy island of Muharrak. It is nowhere more than 3 to 4 feet above the sea and is partly overflowed at high springs. Jezirat Shekh Saad is a low island 4 miles long north and south, on the east side of the harbour. It has a large village and a small tower, 50 feet high, at its north end, about 10 feet above the sea The village has many large boats, and the inhabitants carry on the traffic between Bushire and Shif. No water here except after rains. Slnf is a low rocky point, U miles east of the tower on Shekh Saad •’ it is about 2o feet high and being the only adjacent landing place on 'the mainland many of tne supplies from the interior are shipped from here to Bushire. Last of Shif the country is low, barren and partly swampy for some mdes, and to the north of it there are extensive swamps as far as Ruhilla. Ras-ash-Shatt 10 miles north-west of the Residency, the point which forms the shelter to Bushire harbour against the shamal, is a narrow strip of sand, hardly above the sea level, inside which is an extensive swamp intersectedV 16 by numerous creeks, extending many miles inland and to the east. All these creeks have deep water inside, but only 2 to 3 feet at the entrance. There is a small detachment of Indian native troops as Residency guard | and to protect the telegraph office. # ^ 4 The Persian Government keep a garrison ot about 4l)() troops and some field guns here. The population is chiefly a mixed race of Arab and Persian, that of the country round being almost exclusively Persian. Considerable trade is carried on with Basra, India, Great Britain, Turkey, Egypt and European ports. Communications. —The mail steamers call here weekly on their way from India to Basra, and also on the return voyage; other steamers run to India, and direct to European ports. There is a weekly postal service between Busline and Tehran. Telegraph messages can be sent to any part of the world. Supplies.—G&amp;ttXe, vegetable, fruit, etc., obtainable. Water from Halila Bay, or from a well south of Ras-ash-Shagab. There is a large rain water reservoir on the sea front, but its contents are infested with reshta or guinea worm. The water, from the wells used by the inhabitants, is brackish and lias a purgative effect on strangers during the first month of use. Eirewood very scarce. _ S 1 Anchorage .—The anchorage is in an open and almost unprotected road- 1 stead at a distance of miles from the shore ; it is much exposed to gales, and in bad weather is inaccessible. Every cargo has to be embarked or disembarked in native baghalas, and the process of lading and unlading is in consequence very slow. The inner bay, on the western side, was formerly used as a harbour, there being deep water close up to the town. A bar, however, has formed opposite its entrance, and boats drawing over 10 feet of water cannot pass. The use of a dredger, and the expenditure of a few hundred pounds, would remedy this. Khor Deira, or the inner anchorage, is a belt of deep water between Rakat-as-Safli or “ the inner bank,” which extends off the town, and Rakat* al-Aali or “ the outer bank,” which extends southwards from Ras-ash-Shatt, The inner bank consists of a series of dry sandbanks, lying off the north end of the town. There are several small channels through it, which are used at high water by boats from the creek. The north-west point of these ! shoals, called Ras-al-Marg, is the chief danger to vessels entering the harbour, being a lee-shore in a shamal, and steep-to ; the deepest water in the anchor age is close to its edge. It is the west end of a long narrow sand bank, dry at low water, called Lafka. The soundings of the inner anchorage, where nearly all vessels anchor, are 3 to 4 fathoms at low water, over muddy bottom ; it lies close outside Lafka bank and is about half a mile wide. The anchorage is the better sheltered in a shamal, the farther a vessel is to the eastward, and it will be more convenient for boat work. A ship should anchor with the flag staff S. by E. k E. in 3 to 3£ fathoms, miles from the town, and about 2 £ cables from the edge of the Lafka bank. The holding ground is everywhere very good on this anchorage. A vessel drawing 19a feet has been brought in here at springs. Vessels drawing more than 13 feet, however, must wait for high water. 'Ihe outer anchorage is iu 4 fathoms outside the tail of the outer bank with the town bearing E. by N. It is used by vessels of too large a draught to enter the inner road ; on this bearing boats can easily fetch off with the prevailing winds. This anchorage is exposed to the shamal and sharJci. licles .—It is high water at Bushire, on fall and change, at about 7 h. 80 m. The spring rise and fall varies from 6 to 8 feet, and the neaps rise17 ^ tlie ^ tte entrap 18 ttesideiicj t 'O troops i5 !

In summer the day tides, and in winter the night tides, are the greater, the second tide being, in either case, almost imperceptible. * .The winds affect the tide considerably, the sJiamnl making it later and lowering the general level of the water, while the sharU causes high tides and prevents the water from ebbing. The July spring tide is the highest in the year There is anchorage off Jazirat Kharag or Kharij Island, which is 31 miles north-west of Bushire. Excellent water is obtainable there from wells close to the beach, also a few cattle, vegetables, etc. Dilam is a town and fort, standing on the low coast, about 74 miles north-north-west of Bushire. It is the port of the district of Behbahan, grain cotton, wool, ghi, etc., being exported, chiefly to Bushire and Kuweit. Mud flats dry off from the town, rendering landing difficult. Cattle, etc., are obtainable here. Water is indifferent. The anchorage in 4 fathoms, soft mud, is about Sf miles off the town. It is sheltered from a shamcU. Muhammera is a town of growing importance, on the north bank of the JJafar, about a mile from the entrance. The Hafar is a channel on the east side of the Shatt-al-Arab, 40 miles from Fao, by which there is direct com munication with the Karan river. It is about 2 cables wide and 2 miles in length, with a depth of 3 to 4 fathoms. Population of Muhammera about 7,000. There is an Indian post office and a bazaar. Vessels can lie off the town close to the bank, but there is no room for them to swino-, and they gimei ally anchor in the Shatt-al-Arab near the entrance of the channel. . ^here are two channels from the Persian Gulf into the Shatt-al-Arab (the united stream of the Euphrates and Tigris), but only the Khor-al-Kafka, the western one, is used by steamers. It is 11 miles in length from the outer buoy to the extreme of the land south of Fao. It has a general depth of 8 to II feet at low springs. There is a bar, with only 7 feet at low water, 9 miles from the outer buoy ; thence the water soon deepens to 12 and 15 feet, and there are no further obstructions. At high water springs vessels of 17 feet draught can be navigated up the Shatt al-Arab as far as Basra, 70 miles from the outer buoy. 3.—COMMUNICATIONS. Roads. ; nw *&gt; inner rater, orer® 5 ) ^ i nk, sel a oretk' ; olar^ ;ck offtf and^ e , at ^ ] the The figures in the margin indicate the section and page of the Persian Route-book, to which the reader is referred for a fuller’ description. In many cases, however, the details of distances, supplies, etc., are from later information than that given in the Route-hook. The numerous mountain ranges of Persia, the general regularity with which they run parallel to one another in a north-west direction, and the peculiarity of their configuration have a most important bearing ’ upon the means of communication between the various portions of the Empire. Thus the distance from Bushire to Shiraz, as the crow flies, is under 100 mileg 0 whereas that traversed by the road is 178. But in addition to the difficulties presented by the broken nature of the ground, the long intervals existing i u most parts between water-supplies of any description must also be borne in mind. The Dasht-i-Lut, with its north-west continuation the Dasht-i-Kavir A S f pra . cticaJ] y i m pa s sable for troops except in very insignificant bodies! Alter heavy rain a few hundred men might be rapidly pushed across, but, a 3/ IB it wotild be impossible to keep them supplied by tne desert routes, snob a body would partake of the nature of a flying column and would always be in a most precarious position. . „ i ^ Accordingly the possible lines of invasion of Southern Persia, b} lana, may be divided into 2 groups: those o{ the North-East and those of tb, IN or tli-West. The former consist of the various roads from Mash had and Herat towards the south, all finally uniting in Sistan ; the latter of the Baghdad and Tigris Valley routes and of the various roads Irom Baghdad towards Karmanshah, from Tabriz towards Hamadan, and from iehran towards Isfahan and Vazd. , . A northern invader would have the advantage of the better bases, roads and climate, and of more fertile regions from which to draw supplies, but on the other hand he would be operating on exterior lines, while the Power holding India, and having command of the Persian Gulf, would be able to meet his 2 advances in detail. The whole of Sistan is intersected with canals and watercuts, at best bridged here and there by a few boughs of tamarisk, barely broad or stable enough for one laden mule to cross at a time. Thus, between Sehkuha and Nasratabad, a distance of 20 miles, more than 20 canals and watercuts are crossed. The watercuts, being deeper and enclosed by banks, would be the more serious obstacle to the passage of troops, and, in the event of military operations in Sistan, it might be advisable to carry a certain number of 12 to 15 feet planks for the purpose of crossing them. It would be advisable to distribute hand pumps to any force sent to Southern Persia, in order that halts might be made between the existing stages, which, in very many cases, are too long for troops. ^ ^ j Commencing from the west the first main route into Southern Persia is that from Baghdad, via Khanikin, to Kar- Baghdad to Karmanshah vid manshah : distance 220 miles. This is a Khanikin. ^ mule and camel caravan road and also the Section II, pages o and 6 (a). pilgrim route from Persia to Karbala and Nejaf. A concession was granted in 1895 to a German syndicate to con struct a cart-road from Baghdad to Tehran, via Khanikin, but no work was ever undertaken. From Baghdad to the Persian frontier, 5 miles beyond Khanikin, is a distance of 99 miles, the road running for the most part over a level plain, Just before reaching Khanikin, however, the Jebel Hamrin range of low barren hills is entered by a narrow pass, the pathway being only wide enough for single animals. The ascent to the summit of the pass is only 400 feet in 10 miles. Blasting would be required to make this part passable for guns. Between Khanikin and Karmanshah the road crosses the Zagros range ; the sternest gradients are the Tak-i-Gherrab, between Sar-i-Pul and Karind at the Hist mile, and.the Nalshikan pnss, between Saiarabad and Mabidasht at tbe 200th mile. The latter would require improvement before guns could }USS. In many parts the road lies over clay soil and would be difficult m w 't weather. Just beyond Karind it is rough for 3 miles and then swampy over numerous streams. A lil tie work would imnrove this.

From Karmanshah to Tehran is nominally a chapur route, hut service is absolutely disorganised, and it is better to hire horses right through. To Burujird, vide page 23. To Khuramabad, vide page 22. This alternative route, distance 2261 miles, joins the main road at the Karind river, 175th mile. Water all the way, but no supplies after Mendeli, 79th mile. Sheep and goats could be collected from nomads after 120th mile. A track runs from Kut-al-Amara* to Karmanshali, via Badrai and Deh Bala, distance 209| miles.

A^ara, and 77 miles from Sar-i-Pul on the BagU Appendix to Section II, dad-Karmaushah road), distance 136 miles, page 50. As far as the 56th mile this route is traversable by all arms ; forage is abundant and water frequent; to the 13rd mile the country is well wooded. Inhabitants are scarce, and supplies are almost non-existent till the 49th mile. After the 56th mile the road descends to the valley of the Saidmarra river and is more difficult, traversing passes barely practicable for laden animals : as far as the valley of the river it is void of trees, but water is frequent and forage procurable. The Saidmarra must be forded at the 93rd mile, it is practic able for laden animals only from July to October. Thence to the junction of the Karmanshah road, 122nd mile, the track is mostly good, and could easily he made passable for artillery. On this section, wood, water and forage are abundant, and supplies procurable. Wheat and barley ripen according to elevation from May to July. Indian corn is seen only at Maidaa Rud and Shirwan, ripening in September and October. r lhe spring is the oest season for the passage of troops. Cavalry could move with ease and rapidity owing to the abundance of forage. Del. Bala to Mol.

Thence over an almost level plain to Dizful. As far as Kalata the road is most easily traversed from March to June, forage beiflg then abundant, the crops standing or just reaped, and the tribes with their flocks and herds camped adjacent to the tracts traversed by the road. During the autumn forage is less plentiful and the tribes move to the remoter valleys. The Tigris plain from Kalata to the Karkhah river is only practicable for troops from October to March, being almost deserted during the rest of the year. In October the tribes of Pusht-i-Kuh descend from the mountains, bringing with them large flocks and herds ; the Indian corn is then ripe and the desert always provides a certain quantity of grass. In February, luxuriant herbage is abundant, but it dries with tbe first beats of March and April, during which months the tribes migrate to tbe bill country. From June to September the beat is very great. Water is procurable throughout, except in the tract between the Jik and Karkhah rivers : it is, however, frequently impregnated with salts and sulphur. In the winter the direct road from Deh Bala to Kalata should not be attempted, but the level road by Zorbatia followed (see below). The passage of the Karkhah river from November to May would require special arrange ments if the fords were impracticable. Skilled local guides are absolutely necessary for the passage at any season. A track runs from Kut-al-Amara to Dizful, vid Badrai and Zorbatia; Kufc al-Amara to Dizful. distance about 223 miles. In early spring Section II, page 3, Appendix to Sec- when there is grass on the desert, large herds tion II, page 62. of cattle are driven from Persia to Turkey by this route. From Zorbatia to Tumtuma, 135th mile, it is a desert road, bearing the same characteristics as the eastern portion of the Deh Bala- Dizful road. 'Water is plentiful and less salt than on the rest of this route ; forage abundant; supplies in winter and early spring only, the road being impracticable at other seasons. The south of this route is protected by swamps and deserts, throughout, from any organised enemy, the Arab tribes only having to be reckoned with. Tbe north also may be considered secure from any enemy r , but the nomad tribes of Pusht-i-Kuh, the intricate mass of hills to the south of the Kabar Kuh affording no feasible base or line of advance to disciplined troops in any strength.

The work of construction was entrusted by the Bakhtiari Chiefs to Messrs. Lynch Brothers, all details being left to that firm’s discretion. This road is now open to traffic. In places the gradients are rather steep, a good mule track being all that is intended for tbe present. * Auiara is on the left bank of the Tigris, about 135 miles from Basra, by the windings of the rivar (19 hours by steamer).21 1 Cro P$ Sti| adjats is less plot a from H overtoil* tobertlei til fa: 'ays pmi abundaiit,: which jie nber ths \ trach heti 'egnakd i should it The pass ml arm; re absoloi d ZorM ?arly spn , large k to Turl , desert ru e Deb I i tliis roi ie roadfe protected e Arab ti isideredset iCate nu“ base or lim mcel^®' ouutry,® Si Hate:‘ Tlie route adopted is vid Malamir, Goclar-i-Balutat, Pul-i-Amarat, Ardaf, Tang-i-Darkash Warkash, and Khavarukh. A caravansarai lias been built afc Gudar-i-Balutak. From Ahwaz to Malamir supplies are fairly plentiful, but from there on to Dopulan grain and forage are scarce. Messrs. Lynch’s agent had the greatest difficulty in 1898 in getting sufficient grain and chopped straw for his camp and 25 animals. The 1897 harvest, however, was a failure. There is an almost unlimited supply of sheep, and cattle are fairly numerous. From Dopulan to Isfahan gi ain is plentiful. Numerous donkeys are to be got, but mules are unprocurable throughout the Baklitiari country. Total distance about 307 miles. The details of the bridges are as follows: (1) Over the Karun at Gudar-i-Balutak. Wire rope suspension with piers of solid masonry and a lattice girder. Steel roadway and concrete flooring; length 120 feet; clear width of roadway 10 feet, adapted to carry an ordinary working load of 2| cwt. per square foot, or a live load uniformly distributed of 80 tons. (2) Ov er the Bazuft river at Pul-i-Amarat. A suspension bridge of the same pattern as (1). Length 70 feet; clear width of roadway 10 feet, adapted to carry the same load per square foot as ( 1 ). (3) Over the Karun at Dopulan. A steel girder bridge; length 51 feet; clear width of 10 feet; load the same as (1) and (2).. This road, as mentioned above, was also included in the agreement , entered into between the Bakhtiari Chiefs The Shustar-Isfahan road, and Messrs. Lynch Brothers. It -joins the Section I, pages 197 et seq, Ahwaz-Isfahan road at Malamir, about 93 miles from Shustar. Total distance to Isfanan about 283 miles. Total distance 482 miles. The Imperial Bank of Persia obtained a con- . cession for the construction of this road The Shustar-Tehran roa . many years ago, but nothing was done beyond making a so-called carriage road, between Tehran and Kum, at a cost of £80,000. The concession is still the property of the Bank and was renewed in 1896 for another 10 years. The non-prolongation of the road beyond Kum may be partly ascribed to want of funds and partly to the unsettled state of the country. If the route was made safe, it could probably be opened up without any expenditure of capital* The allowances granted to the Lurs have been withheld from them for some time past, and, as they are in a wretched condition of poverty and destitution, they have been forced to commit robberies and depredations in order to exist. Another factor complicating the situation is that the Lurs, unlike the Bakhtiaris, have no recognised Chiefs, and between Dizful and Burujird there are no less than seven distinct tribes, which makes negocia- tions difficult. From Shustar to Dizful&gt;1' distance 36 miles, there are two alternative routes. The great bridge at Shustar re quires repairing, but beyond that the road is practicable for the three arms, vid Kovnac, and fairly good vid Ab-i-Bid. Water and supplies plentiful.

The road crosses a steep and mountainous Dizful to Khuramabad. region, rising from 580 feet at Dizful to Section I, page 146. 6,020 on the highest pass. Colonel Bell, writing of this route in 1885, stated : “ The nature of the hills favours the construction of a road with gentle gradients; the rock cutting required would be small; the road is never impassable on account of snow ; its chief difficulties consist iu the number of loose boulders strewn along it and which it is no one’s business to remove/’ Colonel Bell, with reference to converting this into a cart-road, classed 57 miles as good and level, merely requiring the removal of loose boulders, 60 miles as fair, requiring to be widened 0 and cleared of stones, 40 miles as bad, requiring to be widened and zigzagged in places to lessen gradients. Water plentiful throughout; no supplies; no firewood till after 100th mile, the road till that point passing through a treeless regiou. At the 45th mile the Ab-i-Zal has to be forded. It is a rapid stream, 20 to 60 feet wide, iu a deep valley between perpendicular cliffs 100 feet high iu places. It is quite unfordable after rain, and there is no bridging ma terial at hand. A track runs from here to Khuramabad direct, but is only practicable for pedestrians. The Kailari range is crossed after the 80th mile by the Tang-i-Chal-i-Jaidar (elevation 3,170 feet). The pass is winding and stony but of good width ; gradients -g- to |; final ascent difficult; descent easier. The Tang-i-Penawar is crossed after the 100th mile; first ascent extremely difficult, then over grassy undulations; elevation of pass 4,050 feet; after this march firewood is plentiful. After the 113th mile the Dalicli pass is crossed; elevation 6,020 feet ; the ascent is not steep, but difficult on account of tbe high ledges of rock and boulders to be surmounted, and it could readily be made easy. After tbe 130th mile the Nal Shikanda pass is cross ed; elevation 5,880 feet; a very difficult but short ascent over steps of rock and boulders; descent by easy gradients over red clay. In tbe next march the Kuh-i Bowi is crossed ; elevation 5,655 feet; the descent is very difficult, over boulders. At 150 miles the Dar-i-ttud is crossed, just above its junction with the Ab-i-Khuramabad; it is a rapid stream 4 feet deep, with firm banks 2 to 3 feet above the surface of the water ; crossing difficult. From Khuramabad a mule road runs to Karmanshah, via Harsin, 7 Khuramabad to Karmanshali t'ia Harsin. stages, 110 miles. P rom Tamaig, at the Appendix to Section II, page 45. Lead ^ the Harsin Valle J» to the GasllU , r pass, (elevation 6,400 feet), the road requires widening and improving, for 3 miles, for the passage of artillery, but tbe gradients are not steep. From the Sirkani valley to the exit from Alishtar it could be made passable for artillery with some considerable spade work. Much work would be required between Kaka Reza and the Rabat pass, and rock cutting at the Takatu and Rabat passes. The descent from the Rabat pass is difficult and dangerous, over slippery rocks. The Gover nor of Khurarnabad takes guns yearly to the Alishtar plain, but none but Persians are likely to attempt such a feat. From Chehr to the south-east edge of the Alishtar plain the road is protected from the north by high and rugged mountains ; between Alishtar and the Rabat pass the country is confined, tbe road being contracted by gorges or adjacent mountains. The best time of year for the passage of this road is from June to the end of August when grass, grazing and water are plentiful. Sheep, goats and cattle could then be collected from the nomads. Wood is obtainable at Sirkani.23 13] ■ ai i(l nioai nt Du' uatti ■ s itlieroe| (! account fjt ara strew i. 11) witbfmj and level, • air, requiiii) to be wife il tbroujljr that poiat f &gt; a rapid si« 100 feeli’ co tri^ii lirect, ktii after tleli oass is wiafe diffieoltji- mile; first i tion ofpaii: Stb mile tit 1 !ep, but life )unted, ailit: randa passe: over steps d In tbe neats ent is veryi t above its i® it deep, li ^ ditfieult, hab, nis ib- rom TaM| ley, tolW 0 feet), issage of valley t®!- some co® i;; aka Re zli ; passes. rocks.

During the first march the Zaghe pass is crossed, elevation 5,910 feet; the last 100 yards of the ascent is steep (1) ; descent at first steep, but soon becomes gentle. At the 26th mile there is a descent of | to the Huru river, which is crossed. It is 200 feet wide and 2 feet 6 inches deep with a stony bottom and rapid current, and is at times difficult to ford. The Chewira Shah pass is then crossed; elevation 7,030 feet; ascent gravelly and broad. A few poplars, 3 to 6-inch diameter, round every village; country otherwise treeless. After the 33rd mile the road gradually ascends to the Gardan-i- llazan ; elevation 6,930 ; last ascent steep, in places i to the road then descends by a stony ravine, three times fording a rapid stream, which is 12 to 15 feet wide and 2 feet deep. A little further on there is a mile of very swampy ground, difficult for mules. The Ab-i-Diz is then forded, 3 feet 6 inches to 4 feet deep, current swift, 250 to 300 feet wide. This river is generally fordable except after rain. After crossing, ground again swampy. More poplars grown round the villages than heretofore, 3 to 6 inches diameter, 15 to 30 feet high; would provide material for bridging.

Buruiird to Isfahan, vid Malakabad : distance 212 miles. , Two main roads lead from Bushire to Shiraz, the post road via Kazerun with its heavy kotals and the longer one via Bushire to Tehran. Firuzabad and Farashband- By either of these roads the mashila (swamp) has first to be encountered. Traffic, however, * generally starts from Shit', on the main land, about 9 miles north-north-east of Bushire, which is reached by native sailing boats. There is only a tower and a tea house there. Between Bushire and Shiraz, the post road ascends four difficult passes or , koiais. It is impracticable for artillery, S^rll’pagc i28. P ° St r ° a ' and in man y P laces in^ntry or cavalry would have to advance in single filer Very often it follows the steepest and least practicable of the various available lines, whereas by a somewhat longer detour, each of the Jcotals could be turned and avoided. The caravan traffic between Bushire and Shiraz, which is large, is carried on by mules. Between Bushire and Shiraz (10 stages, 178 miles) the road rises from the sea level to the Central Iranian plateau, which has a mean elevation of 4,000 to 6,000 feet. Water and supplies are obtainable throughout. From Bushire to Daliki, 59 miles, the road is level. It then enters the hills and, passing through the narrow defile of Daliki and up the Main Kotal, enters the plain of Konartakhta, a rise of 1,400 feet in some 14 miles. From Konartakhta to the Kamarij plain, elevation 2,850 feet, the road passes up the Kamarij kotal, a rise of 1,000 feet in 12 miles. The actual rise, how ever, takes place in a distance of less than a mile, the track being so narrow in parts-that two mules cannot pass each other. Here the hills are of gyp sum, easy to work but very liable to be washed away by the heavy whiter rains. From Kamarij to Kazerun, elevation 2,950 feet, over the Gatchigatchi pass, or by the narrow rocky defile of Tang-i-Turkan, thence along the Kazerun plain to Dasht-i-Barm, elevation 4,300 feet, by the steep Kotal-i- Dukhtar, a rise of some 1,400 feet, including one sharp zig-zag ascent of 700. From Dasht-i-Barm to Dasht i-Avjin, elevation 4,800 feet, the Kotal-i* Pir-i-Zan has to be negociated, a rise of 3,100 feet and a drop of 2,600 feet. Between Daskt-i-Arjin and Shiraz the road rises 1,500 feet to Khan-i-Zinian, and then falls 1,200 feet. Shiraz may also be reached from Bushire by the more circuitous route vi&amp; Firuzabad. The distance in this case is from Busbire to Shiraz ma Fivuzabad. gQg £53 m j] es according to the route adopted Yuion .page . ^ Kalima, stage 3:—(i) vid Tang-i-Bahush, 49 miles, (ii) vid Haft Mullah, 59 miles, (iii) via Tang-i-Sehdar, 97 miles.

Little or no water from 50th to 100th mile except in March. Supplies in small quantities might be collected during the first three stages, at JFiruzabad (6th stage), and at villages passed in the 8th stage. The distance by this route, which lies midway between the two already v t- described, is about 187 miles. It follows Busbire to Slnraz via Jarah. J , , . &lt;» ^ o ^ i the biruzabad route tor the hrst 6 stages, and then turns north, eventually joining the post route at 12 miles from Shiraz. During the 5th stage a short steep and very bad fcotal is ascended, which is difficult for laden animals. During stage 6 the Jarah river has to be forded ; a clear rapid stream, wuth gravel bed, 20 yards wide and 2 feet deep, running between conglomerate banks 50 feet high, crossed diagonally by fairly easy gra dients. During the 7tb stage (127th mile) the Dar-i-Daria kotal is ascended, very steep up a zig-zag for 500 feet; thence easier, but very stony to the summit; elevation 6,000 feet. Colonel Gerard, in 1885, considered that, with sli gbt labour, the Haft Mullah-Jarah road could be rendered passable for light carts. Supplies scarce, as the route lies through a sparsely populated country, princi pally oak forests. The rivers are salt or brackish. The distance to Isfahan by the post road is 812 miles, divided into Tbe Slnraz-Isfahan post and chapar 14 stages. It would be passable by all arms, road. after slight improvements in places. Water Section I, page 187. throughout. Supplies throughout for a small party. More might be collected at Shiraz, Abadeh (stage 8), Kumesbah (stage 12) and Isfahan. The bulk of the transport work between Shiraz and Isfahan is done by mules and camels. At the 9th mile after leaving Shiraz, there is a steep, stony ascent for half a mile, difficult for wheels. The Marvdasht plain, crossed in the 2nd stage, is much intersected by water-courses. During the 4th and 5th stages the road is steep and rough in places, but it might be made practicable for wheels. During the 6th stage several dry water-courses are crossed, with steep ascents and descents. During the last stage the road crosses the Kotal-i-Urchin ; this pass is rather steep, the rock in places being cut into steps. There is a better route, known as the camel road, which avoids the pass and which is always used by carriages. A road via Asupas, running to the west of the one above described, leaves Alternative routes from Shiraz to the P 0Sfc r0ad at ^uza, 6 1st mile, and rejoins Isfahan. it again at Kumeshah, 12th stage. Ihe (a) Section I, page 192. total distance by this route is 12 miles shorter. It is described as tolerably good and is frequently used during the summer. Another route via Asupas and Simarun leaves the above at Asupas, 102nd (4) Section I, page 194. mile, and, running still further to the west. rejoins the post road at Kumeshah, 12th stage, the total distance being 286 miles. This route is said to be fit for wheels throughout, if slight improvementswere made at the following points (l) a stony kotal in stage 5; (2) the Gardan-i-Eklidi in stage 7; (8) the kotal of Hanna in stage 8. [ (2) and (3) might, it is said, be avoided by a detour to the west] ; (4) the ascent from Simarun in stage 10 (the worst bit of all ); (5) the descent into the Kara valley at the end of stage 10. This route would be cool in summer, as it seldom runs below 5,000 feet, but in winter snow probably blocks the passes.26 This road which is said to he a fairly easy one, passes through Bebbalmft Bandar Dilam to Isfahan .id Boh' and Felat, joining the Shiraz-Isfaban post ba l ian . road at Kumesbah : distance to Kumeshah Section I, pages 185 to 187. 275 and to Isfahan 325 miles. The main portion of this road runs through the summer quarters of the Kashkai tribes. Excepting the district of Behbahan it taps no country of importance.

For about 30 miles before reaching Ahwaz the road lies over country liable to inundation, artery of commerce, only a little local donkey traffic going north from Lingah. Distance 468 miles. During the first 252 miles, from Lingab to a point 27 miles beyond Darab, the road is bad in places and would he impassable for wheeled artillery. From this point it is passable for the 3 arms up to Yazd, but two days work would be necessary at the 287th mile, and a couple of hours’ work at the 381st. As far as Niriz, 271 miles, the country traversed is moun tainous. The remaining 197 miles are practically over level country, a pass 17 miles north of Niriz excepted. Water is bad or scarce at the 8 th, 10 th, 11 th, 15th, 16th, 19th and 26th stages. No water at stage 28. Supplies scarce in places throughout. Considerable supplies are obtainable at Darab, and smaller quantities at Lar and Niriz. At Bastak and Herat (or Kharah) supplies might also be collected in smaller quantities. Sheep and goats in numbers, especially between Lar and Darab and to the north of Niriz. The nomads owning them would be found as far south as Bastak in the early spring. Firewood is obtainable from the swamps at Khamir, 27 miles north-east of Lingah, in inexhaustible quantities. Ihere is little or no traffic along this route. Distance 486 miles.

Yazd to Mashhad. Section III, pages 443 and 635. Karman and Saidabad to Shiraz. Section I, Page 249. A main caravan route, from Bandar Abbas to Karman, is via Daulat- abad and Baft. As this road, however, lies at a high altitude it is not open till early in March, and during winter caravans follow the Saidnbad route. Generally speak ing the whole of the Bandar Abbas-Karmau transport is done by donkeys, no mules are used and the bulk of the camels from Bandar Abbas proceed to Yazd or Khorasan, only passing through Karman if on their way to Birjand, etc. Distance to Karman 289 miles, 18 stages. Though less-difficult than the Bushire-Shiraz road, it is not passable for wheeled Bandar Abbas to Karman, artillery. Water obtainable at all stages except the 4th. Camel grazing almost throughout, but scarce above 6,000 in winter. Supplies at Pur ( 6 th stage, 101st mile) ; Daulatabad (9th stage, 137th mile), more could he collected from the surrounding villages; Dashtab (12th stage&gt; 184th mile) ; Baft (13th stage, 204th mile), a large amount could be collect ed here and from villages passed in last march, inhabitants own large flocks of sheep, goats, cattle and donkeys ; Nagar (16th stage, 255th mile) ; and from the villages passed in the 17th stage. During the 5th stage, 77th mile, ascend the Tang-i-Zindan, bad track strewn with rock. The tang is very narrow towards the top. During the 7th stage the road is difficult all the way. The Rohana-i-Gashk is crossed in the 10th stage, 143 miles. In wet weather a swollen stream, difficult to ford. Bed 150 yards wide with sandy bottom. In April 1894 it consisted of some 5 or 6 shallow streams, but was quite dry in December 1899. The Rohana-i- Khara is crossed during the 13th stage, 188th mile. In April 18'94 it was a swift, swollen stream 30 yards broad and 4 feet deep. During the 15th stage there is a gradual and easy ascent up the G udar-i-Kafanu from the 217th mile; vrd Daulatabad and Baft.

Durinff the 17th stage another gradual ascent leads over the Gudar-l-Khun, 263rd mile ; elevation 7,240 leet. The Rnd-i-Chan, winch is crossed daring the last march at the 275th mile, is a deep stream some 2 o yards wide, mud, swollen when the snows melt and during wet weather. The distance by this route is 331 miles, or about 52 miles longer than , , tr by the one above described. It remains open, riPtlie Tang.i-Zaghand Saida- however, all through the winter, water throughout, tad. but scarce at 5th and 8 th halting places—75 and 132 miles respectively. Supplies in small quantities almost throughout. The first 132 miles are over very rough stony-going, and impassable for wheeled artillery, the Tang-i-Zagh having to be negociated between the 84th and 89th miles. A patch of Jcavir is crossed at the 189th mile, which is impassable for a few days after rain. From here to Karman the road is passable by the 3 arms, the Gudar-i-Khan-i-Surkh, at the 257th mile, being steep in places but not impracticable for guns. The Gudar-i-Dukhtar, at the 300th mile, is quite easy. There is another route from Bandar Abbas to Saidabad via the Tang-i- Zindan and Dasht-o-Bar (Section J, page 59). But as it is 47 miles longer than the Tang-i-Zagh route and passes through sparsely inhabited country most of the way, grazing being very scarce in winter, it is of little practical value. The post route, to Yazd and Karman, follows the Baft road as far as the 12 th stage, 184th mile, and then strikes across to Saidabad, rid Hosbuo, After leaving the Baft road it is passable by the 3 arms throughout. A few caravans follow this route. This route is not used by traders. The total distance is 3P&gt;8| miles, if Bandar Abbas to Kannan via Bam is reached vid Kahnu, or 411^ miles if th® Bam. route from Bandar Abbas to Bam via Ahmadi is taken.

When in flood it would be nearly 2,000 yards broad. A bridle path can then be followed along the north-east bank, but wheeled traffic would have to wait till the flood had subsided. Otherwise passable by the 3 arms throughout. The advantages of this route over that via Hay in are : that it is shorter, that it avoids the Tehrud river and its many affluents after the 4th stage, that it crosses an open watershed and avoids the Hanaka pass, that it is never blocked by snow. On the other hand, water and supplies are scarce between Tehrud and Mahun, 38th to 94th mile. The Bam-Rayin road is followed to Tehrud, 371 miles, after which the track lies further to the north. This route is used by caravans. Bam to Karman vid Rayin From Bam Karman, vid Rayin and the and the Hanaka pass. Hanaka pass, is a distance of 120 .| miles.

After 55 miles the going is bad, over Jcavir. This can be avoided by a wide detour to the south. After 80 miles the Gudar-i-Hanaka is crossed, elevation 8,391 feet. This pass is liable to be blocked by snow in winter. The caravan route, from Karman to Mashhad, runs vid Naiband, Tun, Karman to Mashhad. Section III, pages 107 and 47. Total distance 563 miles.

Traders going this way to Sistan, Kain, Herat and even Mashhad. Caravans generally make straight for JBirinti, Jagin and Manujan, leaving the Minab road at Haji Khademi and thence following the gorge of the Manujan river. Between Bandar Abbas and Minab (Minau) there are two routes, the selection of which is regulated by the season of the year. The most northerly one is that vid Jallabi, Hassan Langi and Haji Khademi : distance 57| miles. The other runs parallel to it, vid Kulagau, and is a distance of 54 miles, but is liable to inundation in wet weather and the gain in distance is discounted by the number of shallow creeks, which have to be crossed. Both routes are passable for the 3 arms at their proper season. The plain contains numerous villages with palm groves, wells and patches of cultivation; grain, grazing and firewood obtainable in small quantities, but not plentiful. Water generally indifferent. From Minab to Rigan is a distance of 21 (H miles. Water and grazing almost throughout. Supplies for a small Minab to Rigan. party at most stages, but scarce during the Section I, page 293. last 100 miles. During 2nd stage the Gazuki kotal is crossed. It is not practi cable for guns, but Persian artillery has traversed the caravan route, along the Manujan river, and a few days' work would make it passable for wheels. It is liable, however, to inundation in wet weather. From Chiragabad to Manujan fort, 52nd to 67th mile, the road crosses a low shale Jcotal, which could be made fit for guns in two days. The Shikarabad Jcotal is crossed about the 74th mile. Ascent and descent easy. Artillery has been brought across byr SO Mazareh and Gurg, is a miles. From Rigan to the edge of Narmashir, 36th mile, the road is level and practicable for the 3 arms hand. A few days’ work would make it practicable for guns without unhors ing. ' A difficult htal is crossed about the 170th mile. Guns have been got over it, hauled by 8 horses, with drag ropes in bad places. It could be rendered fit for guns. During the last stage to Rigan the road is liable to inundation near the Kilgar and Konarnai rivers. With the above exceptions the road is practicable for the 3 arms throughout.

Of the two routes given, that via, Kasarkand is the best. The Chahbar trade is essentially local, caravans going as far as Bint, Geh and Kasarkand. Total distance probably about 200 miles. The first portion, from Chahbar to Kasarkand, has not been reported upon, kand ^ 1 ^ 1 '^ arn * &gt;ur v ^ a ^- asar ‘ but Persian wheeled artillery has traversed this route both ways.

Then a belt of about 30 miles of low mud or slate hills, impassable for wheels, practically waterless and sparsely inhabited. After this a district of low hills, where springs are numerous ; population, however, scanty owing to the tyranny of Governor of Geh. At Geh (87th mile) the dasht camels, which are only accustomed to the level sand, must be changed for the hardier and finer hill camels of Lashar. 7 miles of very rough and steep going after leaving Geh, After 114th mile the Sirha pass, very difficult.

The opening of the Karun .—The navigation of the Lower Kavun, from Muhammera to Ahwaz, was opened to the commerce of the world in October 1888. The regulations, however, which were drawn up to limit the concession, were so vexatious as to make it almost valueless. The leave, such as it was, having been obtained, Messrs. Lynch Brothers, of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, detached one of their boats for the Karim service, and have continued to run a boat at intervals of a fortnight from Muhammera to Bandar Nasri (A.hwaz) ever since. They were unable to obtain any suitable accommodation for five years, however, the Persian Government having sold the concession to build warehouses to the Nizam-us-Sultana.^ In May 1894 a lease was signed, by which Messrs. Lynch Brothers were permitted to build a warehouse and pay 15 per cent, on its cost for 10 years, after which they might continue permanently in possession on the same terms The Moen- at-Tujar, the Director of the Nasri Company, a Persian firm working the con cession of the Upper Karun, then claimed the land, which had been leased to Messrs. Lynch, and stopped all building operations until tardy orders came from Tehran. Messrs. Lynch's Agent, however, now occupies a house and quay which are the best in Southern Persia, and local opposition is slowly giving way, as the gain to be derived from intercourse with British firms is begin ning to be recognised. Shekh Mizal (the Moez-us-Sultana), Chief of the Kaab Arabs, who ruled over the country on both sides of the Karun from Muhammera to Wais, * viewed the opening of the river with disfavour and did all in his power to injure Messrs. Lynch, both by running two steamers in opposition and also by instructing his Agent to boycott the English firm's boat. Shekh Mizal was assassinated in 1897 and was succeeded by his brother Shekh Khazal. The latter withdrew the opposition steamers, as soon as he succeeded, and they are now only used as yachts. He has reversed his brother's policy and appears anxious to facilitate matters for British firms. In 1890 Messrs. Lynch Brothers received a subsidy of £3,000 per annum for two years and of £ 2,000 per annum for the next three years, which period has been again extended. The navigable portion of the Upper Karun extends from above the Ahwaz rapids to a point on the Ab-i-Gargar, some 6 miles below Shustar, a distance of some 80 miles by river or rather less than 60 by land. The concession for traffic on the Upper Karun was sold to the Nasri Company, represented by the Moen-at-Tujar, a wealthy Bushire merchant. Grants of land were made to him at Ahwaz and Muhammera, on the stipu lation that warehouses and wharves were to be constructed at both places. A tramway, lj miles long, was also to be constructed round the Ahwaz rapids from Bandar Nasri to Minfad. To avoid the necessity of despatching their goods on the Upper Karun, by a rival company, Messrs. Lynch made a present of a steamer to the Shah, on the understanding that they should work it as his agents. * Shekh Kbazal now has jurisdiction on both banks of the Karun from Muhaxnmera to Band- i-Kir.

Lynch Brothers, though at a loss. In 1897 they received permission for the Shushan, to tow barges on the Upper Karun. The Mai amir, which plies fortnightly between Muhammera and Bandar Nasri, tows one barge whenever required. Average time, under weigh, 20 hours up and 12 hours down stream. If she tows a barge, 27 hours up and 19 down. On the way up she anchors for the night, so about 9 hours must be added for actual time required. During the first six months of the year, when the current is strong, she takes rather longer to go up and has comedown y’k' hours. In the low season (July to December ) she can carry 48 tons of Jp cargo on a draught of 3 feet. In the high season she can take 146 tons, on a 'T&gt; draught of 4| feet. The barge takes 90 tons on 3 feet. 0r “« t ; Ihe Blo&amp;se Lynch, which Messrs. Lynch keep in reserve at Basra, can lna N ^take 220 tons cargo, exclusive of coal, on a draught of 5 feet; on a draught of n ™ 3 feet, however, she can only take about 40 tons. The Skushan runs weekly on the Ab i-Gargar from Ahwaz to Shelalia; iverepstfighe tows one barge. Average time, a day and a half (18 hours under weigh) rs &gt;™'-«p, and 12 hours down. Thirty tons of cargo can be carried in the steamer 1S ] , '''and 80 to 40 in the 70-foot barge, which was sent out from England in 1899. rkiiigh: \bove Band-i-Kir it would be impossible to tow more than one barge, pen leas j n j anuary 1898 freights from Muhammera to Bandar Nasri were r oi'Qef' ibout 10 shillings, and to Shustar about 18 s. 6 d. per ton. ouseawh There are a good number of mahelas (native boats) on the Karun, inelud- -lo'vly ff’ag about 3 above Ahwaz, which carry from 10 to 20 tons of cargo.

At this period long anks of silt divide the broad stream into channels. It is, however, where the iver spreads lakewise, just below the rapids at Ahwaz, that the shallows are lost difficult to thread; the reach being obstructed by sand banks, which , gl^xtend almost across it.

He proposes planting two villages on the ght bank, above Ahwaz, to protect traffic from raiders, who have several times and looted native lighters on that part of the river.

The two branches of the”Karun, which, after their bifurcation at Sbnstar, embrac^ an exteasiv tract of potentially fertile country, converge again at Band-i-lvn. Ut Unse the Ab-f-Gar^ar, an artificial waterway, has high banks and a deep bed, but the narrowness of the channel, the shelving nature of the banks, and the abrupt- ness of the bends, render its navigation during the low season dangerous foi vessel of any size. Large stems of trees, too, have become imbedded mi marly bottom, whence they project above or just below the surface o th water The Skushan, and also the native cargo boats, stop at Shelaha, b miles’by land below Shustar and about 90 miles by water from Ahwaz, Beyond this point the river cannot be termed navigable at present. Besides several shallow places, over which a steamer might.possibly pass, there is one neck of silt and pebbles which would offer difficulty. These obstacles are insignificant, and small steamers could probably be afforded access to the heart of Shustar, were it not for a long dam, which, running across the dry river-bed, leaves a narrow passage for the stream, and causes it to make an abrupt bend. This barrier is situated some miles by land from the town. To make a navigable channel through it some blasting of the massive rocks would required, and, if the Garg-ar were to be rendered suitable for larger vessels, it would be necessary to maintain a greater volume of water within it. As the level of the Ab-i-Gargar is far lower at its head, in Shustar, than that of the Karun proper, from which it diverges (the water being admitted to it by subterranean passages cut through the rock), a larger supply of water might be introduced. A lock and weir could also be constructed at Band-i-Kir. The following sailing directions are from the surveys of the Karun River by Lieutenant W. B. Huddleston, R. I. M., 1899, vide maps Nos. 1 &amp; 2. “ The Karun River, —The two plans, of the Karun river, are fie result of a running sketch survey in November 1899 : the first from Mulmi merato Ahwaz from the deck of the river steamer “ Malamir/' and the other, from Ahwaz to Shustar, made from the river steamer “ Shushan MuhammbrA to Ahwaz.— The river is easily navigable as far Bandar Nasrifor shallow draught steamers drawing three feet. The breadth of the river is from 2 to 5 cables, but the channel is ve |f narrow.in places, more particularly^ at the bends of the river. As a. rule, the deepest water is found on the concave side. Off most of the points there sand banks, in some cases extending more than half way across the river The bottom as far as Kut-Abdula is free from rocks, and is mostly sand et sand and mud. Vessels drawing 12 feet would have no difficulty in gettn'g up the river to Samana bend, but off the point the channel is narrow audt i bend a very sharp one.37 AWai s; ?eral poii Mains of u ' the watii,] ver llomk Upfei he codisss es, the iin jarisdictk; great C| peace lii s iavamli!; Hie tweWi ibrace ai a id-i-Kit, (S 1 a deepli b, aid tk. son dang®: ne imWii the satfi stop at I water fron ,t preseat lv pass, tie These ok d access toi isstheirjp lake an ate e town, dve rock» for larger 1 ’ iv witliint tar, tbaoth admits' iplj offfst'i datBaoid ■s of tbefc iapsNoS' 1 1 [arnn ri®' ie first f Rl£ : ml'f liushan’' navigaU 6 s ie feet, the f 0 * iver. f the poi» L; ' ray aer^, p d is , difficuhf 11 inelis ^ 5 The influence of tide is felt as high up as Ali-bin-Husen.

There are very few conspicuous objects visible from the river the banks after Reuben's Tomb being from 1£ to 11 feet high on both sides and covered with a fringe of light scrub jungle, over which extends a plain as far as the eye can see.

Hie Abdula are probably remains of old buildings. Ibey aie and have only a little more than 3 feet of water over them. From Kut-Abdula to Bandar Nasri the river is full of sand banks and the channel constantly changes. There is a small natural basm with plenty of water off Bandar Nasri, just below the rapids, where vessels unload. The rapids extend from here to Ahwaz, a distance of a little over a mile and there is no means of water communication between the two places owing to them. All the trade is carried on now from bandar Tvasri, and goods are conveyed for transhipment by tram to Alnvaz AnwAZ to Shustar.—A range of low hills about 220 feet above the level of the plain running in a north-east and south-westeriy direction, majk the pcsition of Ahwaz, and the rapids are apparently a continuation of them. They are visible many miles below and above Ahwaz. 1 here are three small peaks close together, making a good land-mark. The highest peak is situated two miles from the town. From Ahwaz to Band-r-Kir there are no difficulties in the way of a shallow draught river steamer. _ The “ Shushan is a stern- wheeler Nile pattern type of river steamer and is admirably adapted for the upper river. The character of the bottom is very different from that in the river below Bandar Nasri, being composed, as far as Grana reach, of rock. After Grana reach, the bottom is sand or sand and mud. Distances, as determined by Harmonic mean of the Patent Log, are as follows:— Ahwaz to Wais ... ••• ••• 'Wais to Bund-i-Kir ... The distances between Bund-i-Kir and Shelaha were estimated by the speed of the vessel and the apparent speed over the ground and are very approximate. Bearings of Kyal x Peak were used whenever possible, and Kyal Peak itself plotted from the bearings obtained. , , The banks are from 15 to 20 feet high and gradually get steeper towards Band-i-Kir. The river is from one to three cables broad, with a plain stretch-38 ing as far as can be seen on both sides. At Band-i-Kir the steamer enters the Ab-i-Gargar river, a very narrow and winding channel. About a mile above Band-i-Kir there is a ridge of rocks across the Shateit which prevents vessels proceeding that way towards Shustar.* The Ab-i-Gargar is from 46 to 100 yards broad with a general depth of from 3 to 6 feet. Under the telegraph wires there is a ridge of rocks and a very narrow channel, barely permitting the “ Shushan 31 to pass. The “ Shush an ” is fitted with two drogues or sea anchors broad on her bows, with a line forward, and when in danger of run ning-into the bank on rounding a bend, the sea anchor, which is shaped like a canvas kite, is let go and by its action in the water hauls the bow of the vessel round. Between Sayad Hassan and Dolabad the channel is full of tree stumps, which are evidently very firmly rooted, and are consequently dangerous. Kyat Peak, a triangular shaped summit on the nearest range of big hills, is visible from most parts of the river, and is an excellent land-mark. The banks or cliffs are from 30 to 40 feet high in places, and soon after pasdntf under the telegraph lines, a few miles above Band-i-Kir, the remains of an old ruined city are easily discernable embedded in the cliff, evidently brought to light by the river having made a new channel. Shelalia is a small village a couple of miles from the bank where the steamer stops. A few miles beyond this a band of rocks prevents vessels going further. Cargo is lauded and taken by pack mules along a good road to Shustar.” The Ab-i-Shateit. — The advantage which the other branch, the Shateit, presents to the navigator consists in the greater breadth of the river. On the other hand steam navigation must at present cease at Chardinga, 18 miles by water and 11 by land from Shustar, and between 30 and 35 nodes by river from Band-i-Kir. Beyond Chardinga long and irregular banks of silt and pebbles divide the stream into tortuous and narrow channels. It would be a work of some magnitude to bank the silt and collect these channels. There is another disadvantage in the navigation of this branch ; about a mile above its confluence with the Gargar and the Ab-i-Diz, at Band-i-Kir, two natuial ledges of submerged sandstone rock cross the stream, at an interval of^about l(iO y aids, and offer a serious impediment to a steamer during the low season. 1 he channel is on the right bank, and the configuration of the reach is such that there is some danger of a vessel being thrown back on the first led^-e, while rounding the bend. At such a season there v/ould not be more than eet of water in the channel. It would probably be easy to blast the rock and deepen the passage. e A.has bean ascended to within a ^ ou ^ 21 miles from Dizfu! and 120 miles from the entrance at Band-i-Kir. It is a very swift and shallow stream, and so winding that the highest point reached, after 24 hours actual steaming, was not more than 32 miles in a direct line from Band- i-Kir. No cultivation was to b e seen, the wealth of the few nomad Arabs near the banks consisting of their sheep, cattle and camels. Wheat is grown nearer Uizfcul. It has been suggested that the Diz might be rendered navigable by cutting a short canal from the Karkhah to the Shapur, or Shaur, and another to allow their united waters to flow into the Diz. It is not, however, certain whether the levels of the waters of the Karkhah and Shapur are suitable for the purpose. r i f ^he Tigris. -Messrs. Lynch Brothers have a weekly service of steamers between Basra and Baghdad. They own three steamers, one being kept in reserve at the former place.

The prevailing wind, a north-wester, is called a shamal. It blows down the Gulf, its direction changing with the trend of the coast. Generally the air is so laden with dust from the Mesopotamian deserts that a dense mist is the result, making navigation dangerous. Other winds are the kaus or sharki t a south-easter, the nash'i, a north easter, and the suhaili y a south-wester; for details of all these vide Persian Gulf Pilot.

The Aleppo boil is a common disease of childhood in the interior. Syphilis is very common throughout Persia. Acute rheumatism does not appear to be common. Extract from a report by Mr. T. F. Ocllmg, M.R.C.S., on the country between Konartakhta and Kazerun. On reaching the plain of Kamarij you at once feel that you are breath, ing a more bracing atmosphere. The Kazerun district, which extends to the foot of Kotal-i-Dukhtar, is midway in temperature, produce and climate bet* ween the sea-coast and the table-lands of Persia. The climate is less enervating and drier, though in the spring and early summer heavy dews fall: the summer is, however, very trying to Europeans, especially during July and August, when hot winds blow every afternoon. For two months during the winter there is occasionally a slight frost at night, and the rainfall there is greater than in most parts of Persia. In the Kazerun district the principal diseases are malarial fevers, hepatitis, dyspepsia, small-pox, venereal diseases, diseases of the eye and a few cases of stone in the bladder. Here one sees fewer blind people, and these are more often the result of small-pox. Early in 1876, a severe epidemic of diphtheria broke out in Kazerun, causing many deaths; shortly afterwards it reached Shiraz and quickly travelled north. Since that time 1 have not heard of any cases at Kazerun. A severe epidemic of small-pox occurred in Kazerun in 1883 and was fatal to children, of whom about 200 died. Probably it is never alto* gether absent. Extract from reports by Surgeon Waters, Residency, Bushire, 1873-74. Bushike. —Sewage pits are dug in the street, which is generally not mo r e than 7 or 8 feet wide. Twelve different places of sepulture within the wails. Graves not more than 3 feet deep, and some temporary erections of stone or lime above the surface, for purpose of holding bodies to be conveyed to Karbala. These bodies often become exposed. Hie wells are all brackish. At south-east corner is a large tank, for collecting rain-water. This reservoir is open only during April and May, which period is coincident with annual advent of guinea worm. Chief supply of drinking, water is from two wells, one at Bahmane, 6 miles from the town, the other at Bagh-i-Mulla, 5 miles. Only slightly brackish, but causes griping, etc., during first month of use. During wet weather locomotion on the plain between the city and culti* 'vated land is difficult from mud and pools of water. The first 200 yards or so of inis plain, from the city gate, being near the barracks, is generally resorted to as a necessary by the Persian troops. Covered with filth and dead dogs, mules, etc.43 wan, Subsoil of plain for first 20 foot or so is very porous conglomerate rock tote ili,, containing a quantity of small shells. Beneath this is found a thick bed of firm moist clay. Nevertheless Bushire is not a very unhealthy place. Has a ehn in ^ ?ood natural position. Prevalent wind is north-west which, coming across the gulf, becomes deprived by oxidation of deleterious substances it may have previ- to huaiiii ously contained and neutralizes the emanations from the sewage pits, cesspools, etc. Sickness, chiefly malarial fever, is increased during the south-east winds, doubtless owing to the malaria being carried from the mashila, a marsh up wards of 3 miles in length, which connects the peninsula with the mainland. 5.—RESOURCES* wtkmibji Agriculture. duce anil sin mate is bar lews fall if; afterwards it* ave not htf din Kaffli ibabl)'iti iEt is generally Jture witW erections'd* Possessing every variety of climate, from the extremes of tropical heat to the perpetual snow line, and every quality of soil, Persia’s vegetable pro ductions are numerous and diversified. A scanty and diminishing rainfall* the desolation arising from frequent invasions in the past, ignorant agri culture, and gross maladministration have impaired or reduced her capacities. Cereals. — Grain, mainly wheat and barley (the latter being commonly Used as fodder for horses), is grown almost throughout Southern Persia, but in greatest plenty in Sistan, Arabistan, Ears, Isfahan, and Karmam In the producing districts prices are very low, but the lack of means of communi cation makes it often impossible, in the towns, to find wheat on the market. The implements of tillage are primitive. In spite of the huge tracts of agricultural land lying idle, particularly in the south-west, the growth of wheat is already in excess of the needs of the home population and grain is exported in some quantity to Tur key, India and even England. There is not much maize, but millet is pro duced in parts. Rice is grown in Pars, Isfahan, Hawizeh, Dizful and Ram Hormuz, but is almost all consumed locally. Generally speaking maize, millet and rice are grown in greater or smaller quantities throughout the garmsir or hot country. It has been estimated that in average years, Sistan produces a surplus of grain, available for export, of 127,678 cwt. The following table gives the amounts of wheat in cwt. exported from the principal Persian ports in 1896, 1897 and 1898.

Sugar .—Sugarcane is sparsely cultivated in Yazd, where a coarse and ill-refined sugar is made for local consumption. Formerly the cane was largely cultivated in the neighbourhood of Ahwaz. Cotton ,—Cotton is cultivated more or less throughout Southern Persia, especially in the Isfahan, Yazd and Karman provinces, but it is very short in tbe staple. Besides the ordinary white cotton, a yellow species (Gossypim religiomm) is grown in Yazd. It is used by the Parsees, who weave it into a cloth for their own dress. Tobacco .—Large quantities of tobacco, of good quality, are produced in tbe vicinity of Shiraz. It is also produced at Isfahan, but of a slightly inferior quality. A monopoly for the purchase, sale and manufacture of tobacco, for a period of 50 years, was granted by tbe Shah, in 1890, to a company enti'hd the Imperial Tobacco Corporation of Persia. The concession, however, was revoked in 1892, in consequence of popular outbreaks. Opium .—Opium has for many years been a main source of revenue to the Persian exchequer. The chief areas of growth are Yazd, Isfahan, Shiraz, Ninz, Khonsar, Karman, Kazerun, Shustar and Burujird. In the neighbourhood of Isfahan and Yazd, in particular, the poppy growth has almost superseded all other industries. 'Medicinal plants. —Gum-tragaeanth, the exudation of tbe Astragalus a low thorn bush, is eolleeted in the hilly country from Karman to Karmanshah. Gum arable is extracted from the honar or wild plum tree near Shiraz. Gum ammoniac, galbanum and sagapenum are produced in the neighbourhoods of Isfahan, Shiraz and Laristan. Opoponax, sarcocolla, colocynth and scammony are also known. Asafoetida is extracted from a desert plant, which grows in many parts of Persian Baluchistan and near Yazd. Liquorice grows wild on the plains of the Persian plateau. Gez or manna is collected irom the branches of bushes, principally qez or tamarisk, growing iu the Bakhtiari country. &gt; b a Colouring plants. Indigo is grown in the south-west, near Shustar and Dizful, and in Laristan, and in lesser quantities throughout the garni sir ^ or hot countiy, of Southern Persia. Henna, consisting of the pulverised leaf of the Lawsonia inermis, is largely produced in the Narmashir district. Madder roots grow wild near \azd, and safron is cultivated about Burujird. The vine is principally cultivated in the vicinity of Shiraz, Isfahan, lazd and Karman. Rasins are produced, and fresh grapes are sometimes sent to India packed in cottonwool. Wine is largely made, that of Shiraz emg the most celebrated. Raki, or arrack, is a popular spirituous product Bates are largely cultivated all along the Southern coast of Persia, and also in Karman, Khabis and Persian Baluchistan. Date palms begin to yield in 3 years, and reach their prime at 30. A good crop from a singlt tree would be 80 to 100 lbs. They are fertilised by hand, one male tret supplying pollen for some 40 female palms. , T ^ at e crop of Muhammera, the Bahmishir river and the Persian bank of the Shatt-al-Arab, in 1897, amounted to 106,200 cwt.

Isfahan is Celebrated for its melons and Pars for its oranges and limes. Pistachio nuts are exported from Karman. Vegetables. —Cabbages, cucumbers, carrots, turnips, peas, beans and potatoes all thrive well. 112 tons of beans were exported from Muham- mera to London in 1896. Irrigation .—The land is irrigated by water-cuts from rivers, or other sources, by kanats (called karezes or kahns in parts), or from wells. A kanat is a subterranean aqueduct conducting the water from the springs on the hillside to the point where the water is required for cultivation. It is constructed as follows: a spring having been discovered, a well is dug until water is reached ; if the supply is satisfactory, as regards quantity, a second well is dug at such a distance from the other as to allow a subterranean communica tion between both. Work is then commenced at the end, where the water is required on the surface, or at intervening points, and a trench or cutting is due’, on a very slightly inclined plane, in the direction of the spring. As the' work gets deeper under ground, shafts are opened from above, at distances of 20 yards or more, by which the excavated soil is drawn up to the surface and heaped round the mouth of the shaft. In time, the tunnel reaches the spring, and the water flows down to its destination. The shafts are subse quently used to keep the tunnel clear. Commerce. Practically the whole of the import and export trade of Southern Persia pass s through the coast ports, by the Baghdad-Karmansh th or the Quetta- ISushki trade route. A considerable amount of these goods, however, pass out of the area under consideration in this report. From Bandar Abbas and Quetta merchandise is distributed as far north as Mashhad, Herat and Trans- Caspia, while the Baghdad-Karmanshah route is the principal avenue of sea borne trade with Tehran and the north-west, especially for bulky articles. The mule track recently opened between Ahwaz and Isfahan will probably have a beneficial effect on our trade prospects, but the Karun-Shustar-Burujird route is the natural avenue for commercial competition with Russia in the north. There seems no doubt that if this road were made safe,t it would be largely used even if little or no money were spent on improving it. Arms and Ammunition ..—The import of arms and ammunition was stopped at the beginning of December 1897. For farther information on this subject see page 75. Karmanshah. —In 1897 the customs of Karmanshah were farmed for 76,000 tomans (about £15,200). 76,950 loads of merchandise of all classes * Does not include amount shipped by native boats. t Since the above was written the Ain ud-Daula has made an arrangem nt with the Derik- waud chiefs, by which the latter guarantee the safety of this road.r - 46 entered Persia this route in that year, including' 22,000 loads of Man die?, ter piece goods. The Karmaashah bazar requires about £2,000 a week for its trade remittances on London. A syndicate of merchants, formed with a view to taking over the cus* toms, estimated the average annual value of imports from Baghdad to Kar, manshah, during the b years 1895-97, at £ 812,3!)-t. They estimated the average annual exports, for the same period, at £ 138,600. These figures are considerably in excess of those of the custom house, but are probably much more reliable.

The Nushki export and import returns for 1898-99 amounted to Its. 7,28,032, as against Rs. 5,89,929 for the preceding 12 months. These figures include trade to the Afghan provinces of ShorawalT Registan and Garmsel. Industries. The manufactures of Southern Persia consist principally of silk, woollen or cotton tissues, and of artistic fabrications. Broadly speaking factories do not exist, and the employment of steam or even water-power is hardly known. The principal carpet-producing centres in Southern Persia are : Karman, Sultanabad and the surrounding country, Fars and Shiraz. Camel’s hair namads or felts are manufactured principally at Yazd* Karman and Isfahan. Karman is celebrated for shawls of goat’s hair. Isfahan produces kalem- kars or chintzes (mostly printed on Manchester shirtings) silk fabrics, parti coloured velvets and pierced brass work. Gold and silver brocades and cotton and silk fabrics are manufactured at Yazd. Enamelled kalian bowls are turned out at Shiraz, Behbahan and Isfahan. Shiraz also produces a mosaic work of bone, metal and coloured woods in minute geometrical designs. Labour. The rates for labour, and the approximate number of labourers available, in some of the principal towns of Southern Persia, will be found in the table on pages 84 to 89. Friday is kept as a holiday. The Baluch labourers of. Persian Baluchistan are very lazy. Productions. Minerals .—A company was formed in the spring of 1890, entitled “The Persian Bank Mining Rights Corporation,” to acquire and work the mining rights conceded to the Imperial Bank of Persia. Immediately upon the formation of the company a staff of engineers was sent out to prospect the country, but their efforts met with little or no success, and the company has since collapsed. Profitable mining in Southern Persia is practically an impos sibility owing to the difficulty of obtaining fuel. Iron .—There are iron mines at Parpa, near Niriz, which were extensively worked in ancient times. Iron ore, containing 59 per cent, of metal, is obtain ed in the Feridan district, north-west of Isfahan. Lead .—There are several small mines in Southern Persia, but the output is infinitesimal. Copper.—k small quantity of copper, said to be of excellent quality, is smelted in the Bahr Asman range, east of Rahbur, in the Karman province. About 6,000 lbs. is annually extracted at Kala Zari, south-south-west of Birjand, on the eastern edge of the Dasht-i-Lut. Copper is to be found all over Southern Persia, but, owing to the absence of coal, it cannot compete with imported sheet copper. Kll! 302,?12 ierstef50 v Naphtha .—A concession was granted in 1884 to Messrs. Hotz for working petroleum springs suspected to exist in the vicinity of Daliki, north-east of Bushire ; they were unsuccessful in discovering oil. Experiments were sub sequently renewed by the Persian Mining Rights Corporation, who bored t 0 a considerable depth, but without success. There ^ are about a dozen springs, some 14 miles east of Ram Hormuz, which yield a dark and heavy oil! A purer oil is obtained about 45 miles south-east of Shustar, from shallow pits in the bed of a stream; it is used in lamps unrefined. There is a third group of wells at Haft Sheid, north of Shustar, which yields a dark green oil. It is used by the Arabs to rub on their camels as a cure for itch. Oil i s also reported to exist near Dizful, and north of Bandar Abbas, near Ahmadi. A coarse naphtha is produced at some springs on the south coast of Kisktn opposite Henjam island. Salt .—Between 25,000 and 30,000 tons of rock salt are exported annually from Kishm and Hormuz. The best comes from the former island, where there is a cliff, 200 to 300 feet high, of pure rock salt. It is found in combination with iron ochre, which is also exported in considerable quantities. There are many other localities in Southern Persia, where salt exists in great abundance. Saltpetre is found in the neighbourhood of Kazerun and in Sistan, where they make their own powder. Sulphur .—There is a large sulphur mine at Khamir, on the mainland opposite Kishm Island. Sulphur is obtained from the Kuh-i-Bazman, and mixed with sal ammoniac, from the active volcano of Kuh-i-Chehel Tan (Kuh-i-Taftan), both in Sarhad. Some 3,000 lbs. sulphur and 650 lbs. sal ammoniac are paid by the Sarhadis as a portion of their annual tax to the Governor of Baluchistan. ifora#.—During the brief existence of the Mining Corporation, borax was worked at Deb Shuturan to the south-west of Buhramabad. It was stated in 1893 that the profits just about paid expenses. Asbestos has been discovered in the Darband range, north of Karman. Various ores .—Antimony, nickel and cobalt ores have been discovered near Anarek, beweeu Isfahan and Yazd, mercury is said to exist in the Zardeh Kuh range in the Bakhtiari country.

The numbers actually imported into India from Muhammera and Bushire, the principal centres of the trade, are given in the following table.

In autumn and winter they cover about 20 miles per diem on / lbs. of barley and lbs. of chopped straw. In spring and early summer, when they graze, the mules carry the same load, but do half marches. They are very largely used for transport purposes, especially in the south-west. f l he whole of tee caravan traffic between Bushire and Shiraz is performed by mules. Mules average about 3 miles an hour. The saddle is a huge pad, high-peaked before and behind, without a scrap of iron in it. It is kept in its place by a breastplate and breaching, and is never taken off, except when the mule is cleaned. The load, after being slung across the saddle, is secured by a leather surcingle with loops of iron at each end. These are brought together by several turns of a leather thong pulled with all the force of a muleteer's arms, his foot being pressed against the beast’s belly as a purchase. Thus secured, the loads rarely shift, and sorebacks are very uncommon. The muleteers walk or ride on donkeys. Each gang of 10 or 12 mules is led by a pony, gaily caparisoned, and furnished with a couple of large, hollow sounding bells and seveial smaller and shriller ones* -r. • r* ».• Mules are bred in many parts of Arabistan, notably on the Persian frontier of Turkish Arabia, in the Bam Hormuz district and by the Sagwand Lurs The latter generally bring their mules to Dizful for sale m February and March.

The rates of transport hire vary very considerably during the course of the year, in accordance with the amount of goods to be transported, the price of forage, and the comparative security of the road. As there is a greater demand for carriage from south to north, the rates of hire southwards are often only half those demanded for the northward journey. The table on page 82 gives the maximum and minimum rates for a load of 650 lbs., during the years specified in brans. Another, table of approximate rates of freight is given on page 83. 6 .—ETHNOGRAPHY. The Persians, generally speaking, are Shiah Muhammadans, that is, they recognise Ali as the successor of Muhammad, rather than the four Imams. The presence of Sunnis, or orthodox Muhammadans, on all their frontiers, was, in the past, a means of consolidating the discordant elements of Persia and uniting them together in defence of their religion. This source of union is to the present day more powerful with them than either patriotism or loyalty. The inhabitants of Persia, classed according to their racial affinities, are as follows :— r r i f Tajiks (Persians), in the towns and agricultural districts. Kurds, in Persian Kurdistan. Ltirs, in Luristan and the Bakhtiari country. Iranic Branch &lt;j Leks, in Bars and Isfahan. Aryan* ... • CAUCASIC ■ TYPE. Gabres or Farsis, in Yazd and Karrnan.

J Turki Iliats, principally in Ears. Afshars in Karman. Kizil Bashis, in Karman. Speaking broadly the population of the plateau is Persian, while tribes of various nationalities are found in the surrounding hills and on the loweru country; thas tbe population of South-West Petsia is composed of AraW, more or less Persianised, and Lurs ; nomads being in the majority, Further east we find a nomad population of Turkoman and Arab extraction, the former being the more numerous, with a settled population, partly of the above but principally composed of Persians (Leks and Tajiks). Along the coast the population is partly Arab and partly Persian. East of Bushire an admixture of Negroid slave blood is observed. This is especially noticeable on the Makran coast. In Persian Baluchistan the population is almost entirely Baluch. Armenians. —There are over 16,000 Armenians in Southern Persia, princi pally in Julfa and tbe country to the west and north-west of Isfahan Chahar Mahal and Feridan. The rural population is hardly distinguishable from the more warlike tribes, with which it is surrounded, and does not bear the slightest resemblance to tbe other members of the race in Julfa. The Gabres or Parsers, the descendants of the Persians who did not adopt Muhammadanism, reside principally in Yazd and Karman. They number about 9,000 persons in all. Their Agent pays annually a fixed sum for the taxes due from the whole community. Gipsies. —There are some 20,000 Gipsies, in Southern Persia. Hindu traders.— There are a certain number of natives of India, scattered over the country, principally in Bandar Abbas, Lingah, Karman and Chahbar, Jews. —There are about 7,000 Jews in Southern Persia, the largest numbers being congregated at Isfahan, Yazd and Shiraz. In all the provincial districts the Jews are more or less persecuted ; and in places where their taxes are light it is owing rather to their extreme poverty than to the forbearance o! the authorities. I hey furnish most of the musicians of tbe community, and also make and retail wine. Arab tribes of Arabistan. —The most numerous, in point of numbers, of the Arabs of Arabistau are the Kab Arabs. For details of the Arabs of Arabistan, vide Part II, page 90. The Bani Lam Arabs are almost entirely in Turkish territory. They extend from the left bank of the Tigris to the lower slopes of the Pushfc-i* Kuh range. They are a turbulent lot, generally at feud with the Lur tribes over the Persian frontier. Being Shiahs their religious sympathies are anti- Turkish. The Muntifik Arabs inhabit the country between and about the Lower Tigris and Euphrates. There are many Muntifik Arabs in the Hawizeh district, who emigrated from the right bank of the Tigris, between Amara and Kurna, to escape the exactions of their Shekhs. T he Kurds of Karmanshah and Kurdistan lie outside the area treated of in this report. By religion they are Sunni Muhammadans and therefore anta gonistic to the Persians. The Lurs belong to the same group as the Kurds, further north, although they themselves consider it an insult to be confounded with the Kurds, whom they^ call Leks. Although outwardly Muhammadans, they are lax in religious observances. They attach little or no importance to Muhammad “P r ie -^ oran ’ ; ^ e | r i principal object of worship being their great saint Baba Buzurg . They also have holy men amongst them, who are regarded with reverence, little short of adoration. They have peculiar sacrifices and mystical meetings. The Lurs of Lur-i-Kuchik are generally known K it* k urs &gt; those of Lur-i-Buzurg as Bakhtiaris, Kubgelus and IJeFeili^ ftiFflii 1 jfc w jiM ft' taFstti ikactK' bk Wiodepen # Part lb P JbiBakh - liK, aridity liorityale laiijl kas he B ia» family, Ifoils of tribi TiePopui aid and tl latter are mor tries of lai Ibmsali tril family disi !«s, Fo ThiIl Air Bal Na ^ fnrthi , The; Stable the fa limb a ewfieua bitten. selves, tl sideraty55 ,n ? io 4 - Tajfc), | ^•westoli race idol Persian ii:. The Feili Lurs are divided into the Pish Kuh (north of the Kabir Kuh), and the Pusht-i-Kuh (south of the Kabir Kuh). The Feili Lurs of Pish Kuh. —The two main tribal divisions of the Lurs of Pish Kuh are the Gulek and Selewerzi ; these are again sub-divided into the Amalah and Bala Giriwa, and the Sila Sila and Dilfan tribes. The Pish Kuh tribes are without a supreme Chief, each having its own particular head, or Tushmal. For further details, vide Part II, page 92. The Feili Lurs of Pusht-i-Kuh. —These tribes are entirely nomadic in character. Until quite I’ecently their Chief, the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh, was almost independent of the central government. For details of sub-divisions, vide Part II, page 93. The Bakhtiaris were originally divided into the Haft Lang, the Chahar Lang, and dependencies or tribes not originally occupiers of the mountains. The original enmity that existed between the Haft Lang and the Chahar Lang has been replaced by intrigues between the various members of the ruling family, tempered by assassination by the Central Government. For details of tribal sub-divisions, vide Part II, pages 94 to 96. The Population of Pars may be resolved into two distinct elements—the lernPcri, settled and the nomad. The former are quiet, cowardly and inoffensive. The itivesofli latter are mostly lawless and turbulent in character. The principal nomad i, Karwji tribes of Fars are : the Kuhgelu and Mamasenni Lurs, the Kashkais and the rsiadbli^i Khamsah tribes. The whole of the nomad tribes of Fars are under the family 1 the puma!; of the Kawam, who is also hereditary Mayor of Shiraz, and by far the most where tkiit important noble in Southern Persia. to tie lot Kuhgelu Lurs.- —Part of the tribe is under the Government of Arabis- )f the coc tan, but the greater portion is under that of Fars. Their language, customs and religion do not differ in any material respect from those of the Bakhti- i,inpointi!: aris. Their yam-s/rs and saTv/sM-s (winter and summer residences) are little details of fe more than a transition from the foot to the summit of their mountains. For details of tribal sub-divisions, vide Part II, page 97. iirkishMf The Mamasenni Lurs claim to have emigrated from Sistan and to be slopes oft descended from Rustam. They are a very fine race with a Jewish cast of id withtliih countenance. Though noted in the past for their predatory and lawless issympatiffif habits, they are now comparatively peaceful pastoralists. They speak the Lur dialect with local modifications.

The Bashakardis, inhabiting the district of the same name, are a very miserable looking race, underfed, shrivelled up, small eyed, wizen-faced crea tures, the men generally under 5 feet 5 inches in height and the women small in limb and stunted in growth. There is nothing open or engaging in their countenances, in which poverty and hunger, cunning and avarice, are plainly written. Though generally armed and almost always fighting among them selves, they are not brave. They hamper the trade from Bandar Abbas con siderably, robbing small unarmed caravans, openly, and larger ones, by stealth,m The Balucii Race is spread over the whole of Persian Baluchistan, 3 certain number of Baluchis being also found in Sistan (see below). Their chiefs are of Arab extraction. The Baluchis, with very few exceptions, are Sunni Muhammadans and their Mullahs are mostly Af^liai.s. Ihe main tribes in Persian territory are the Rinds, Dehwars, Reids, Damauis, and Kurds, For details of sub-divisions, vide Part II, pages 103 to 105. Pottinger divided the Baluchis into Naruis, Rinds, aou Magzis, Colonel Reynolds, in 1889, omitted Naruis, and substituted Lasharis. The Dehwar tribe, an off-shoot of the Rinds, is found about Dizak, in Suran and Sib, as well as in Kelat territory. It is said that the fighting strength of the Western Dehwar clan is 3,000 men, when all the tribes contribute their quotas. It is estimated that 1,000 men can be assembled from those tribes, if necessary, in tluee or tour days within easy reach of Dizak. The Rekis, whose name signifies that they are the inhabitants of tb lowlands, may be divided into 3 divisions: the Rekis of Mirjavva, of Mashkel, and of Jalk. All 3 divisions a”e said to have sprung from a common ancestor, but while all acknowledge Muhammad Raza Khan of Mirjawaas their Sardar, each section pays Sardari to its own immediate chief. About 650 families in all, mostly agriculturists,, but owning numerous flocks. The Mashkel Rekis also own fairly extensive date groves. The Daman is, who are numeiicaliy the strongest tribe in Sarhad, are a pastoral race of predatory habits, closely allied, in appearance, manners and customs, to the Marris of British Baluchistan, with whom they claim affinity. They are divided into 8 sections, who acknowledge Mir Jahind Yar Muliam- madzai as supreme chief. Essentially a race of hardy mountaineers, they only leave their highlands, in order to collect their date harvest in Mashkel, or to raid their neighbours. The Kurds of Sarhad are supposed to have emigrated from the Turko- Persian frontier. On the death of the leading Kurd Sardar, in 1888, his 4 sons were invited to Bampur and there arrested and put to death. A Persian nominee was then installed at Kwash, to administer the country under the immediate orders of the Deputy Governor of Bampur, with the result that a large proportion of the Kurds, never very numerous, gradually emigrated to Sistan, and the few who remain are now in a state of extreme poverty. The only 1 - sections of the Kurd tribe still in Sarhad are the Mir Balozai and Ismailzai, some 200 families in all. The Ismailzai (or Sumalzai), who inhabit the country about Galugah S* W. of Sistan, are a pastoral tribe, said to number about 200 fighting men. Their chief Jahil has an evil reputation in Southern Sistan and around Kuh-i- Malik Siah, owing to his notorious raiding propensities.. In addition to the main tribes, on the Perso-Baluch frontier, we find a a conglomeration of petty clans, families and individuals, who have been com pelled by blood feuds, or other causes, to fly to Sarhad, or as it is aptly termed by the Persians “ Yaghistan”. Thus the Buzurgzadagan, or Hudroshahzat,. are the descendants of an adventurer from Northern India. Although the tribe is numerically weak, Dilawar Khan, its Chief, has considerable influence over his neighbours, owing to his being the descendant of a Sayid. A list of some of the minor clans, residing in the vicinity of the Jalk palm groves, will be found on page 105. The Inhabitants of Sistan generally speaking, are a miserable race, very dark skinned, of wretched physique, small in stature, and inferior both physically and mentally to the Persians. The Baluchis in the northern part of the basin are of inferior physique to the Sistanis ; while those south-west of lifer tail* ai With a mue of tbs ' “Man it has man; ids, TIk presents a g aal Turkisl The lai ef Karman derslaoi Arabic king not a Arabic is tl siierable a Ther lisliment c Shah tksiasm ijnastv, Shah Ab empire ex his sncces the Persii and Kur Persian C it Herat following rtich wi Hasen tc Hadir, 1 and dre and ass L57 rsia n Bak iai!8 ' Ik ts j itij ueawatciii; estimate! | in three ini( i inhliibav Mirjawi r (|| m a cohnii rjawaastfci The Mail be in Sark; iranee, ne »tfceytliii: Jahindfe! juataineeri,! st m Jlasit: ted from t ar, in 18^; ) death, ll &gt; country e th the wli'. ideally treme powf ie Mir Bit try about Bi' i doo a aod®ii ! frontier, *■ ffllO. d, or yer nis 7 some of t! ; , will 1; ' e a *4 », and f ; tlie^f; Sehkulia are fine able-bodied men, intensely proud of their Baluch origin. In this direction the Gurgich and Brahms are the most numerous. The Sarbandis, Shahrekis, Naruis, and Kayanis have well nigh ceased to exist as clans and are becoming merged in the general population. A good many of the Baluchis and Brahuis of Sistan have become Shiah Muhammadans, Major Brazier Creagh estimated that there were 19,472 houses in Sistan in 1897, which, with five inhabitants to a house, would give a total settled population of 115,860 souls. He further classed them as: Persian Sistanis 12,622, Baluchis 6,318, Kayanis 465, and Afghans 67 houses. The Sarbandis, the most important Baluch tribe in Sistan,, numbered about 3,600 men. He estimated the Taok Baluch (nomads) at 18,500, of whom 14,470 were in Sistan. Details of this latter tribe are given on page 106. Languages. With a few exceptions, on the eastern and western frontiers, the Ian- guage of the whole of Southern Persia is Persian. °The language of the Kurds is generally known as Karmanji or Kardasi it has many dialects and contains a great number of Persian and Arabic words. The Kinds of Karmanshah speak a dialect known as Guran, which presents a greater affinity to modern Persian. Karmanji is not written, Arabic and Turkish, with a little Persian, being employed for that purpose. The language of the Lurs differs but slightly from that of the Kurds of Karmanshah, and a person conversant with the one dialect will perfectly understand the other. Arabic is spoken in the coast strip westward of Behbahan, Persian beino’ not always understood. About the Karun, as far north as Shustar,. Arabic is the only spoken language, and in the villages and encampments, as a rule, Persian is not understood except by a very few. # „ The Baluchis speak a language distinct from Persian, hut containing a con siderable admixture of Persian words. Their chiefs all speak Persian fairly well.- 7 —HISTORY. The modern history of Persia may be said to commence with the estab lishment of the Safavi dynasty, in 1499 A.D. T Shah Ismail, the founder, successfully appealed to the popular en thusiasm for the Shiah faith, as a weapon by which to overthrow the Usbak dynastv. The Safavi sovereigns reached the zenith of their power under Shah Abbas the Great, about the commencement of the 17th century. His empire extended to the Oxus and included Herat and Kandahar. Under his successors it rapidlv dwindled and the outlying provinces threw off the Persian supremacy. Turkey obtained possession of Georgia, Azarbaijan aud Kurdistan, the Imam of Maskat established his sovereignty over the Persian Gulf and the Afghans asserted and maintained their independence at Herat and Kandahar. In 1721, the Afghans seized Karman and the following year advanced on Isfahan. They defeated the large Persian army which went out to meet them, and, after a desperate siege compelled Shah Husen to abdicate his throne in favour of Mahmud, their leader. , The Afghan rule lasted 8 years. Two individuals then appeared m support of Shah Tahmasp, the eldest son of Shah Husen. These were hath Ali Khan, a Chief of the Kajar tribe and Nadir Kuh, a jobber of Khurasan. Nadir, having murdered Path Ali Khan, took command of Tahmasp s army and drove the Afghans out of Persia, subsequently dethroning iahmasp and assuming the sovereignty himself under the name of Nadir ah. 1 - mately his empire extended over all the territories which had been conquered by Shah 4bbas. Nadir Shah was assassinated near Mashhad in U47.58 For many years after this event the country was deluded with blood by a succession of rival chieftains. By 1760 Karim Khan Zand, nominally the vakil of the puppet ruler Ismail III, was in possession of the whole of Persia, with the exception of Georgia and Khurasan. His rule, which lasted till 1779, was just and comparatively peaceful, and commerce and agriculture rapidly revived. Karim Khan transferred the capital of Persia from Isfahan to Shiraz. In 1789 Agha Muhammad Khan, the Chief of the Kajars, advanced from the north against Lutf AH Khan, the last of the Zand rulers. Lutf Ali Khan is famous in Persian story for the prodigies of valour which he performed, but he was betrayed by his trusted minister Haji Ibrahim and deserted by his followers. For some years he made attempts to regain his kingdom, but in 1795 he was captured and murdered. Agha Muhammad, the founder of the Kajar dynasty, transferred the capital of Persia from Shiraz to Tehran. He w 7 as guilty of most inhumau acts of cruelty and was murdered by his servants in 1797. Early in the reign of his successor, Fath Ali Shah, Persia commenced her diplomatic intercourse with European nations, which has continued to the pre-ent day. In 1800 Captain (afterwards Sir John) Malcolm was sent on a mission from India. He succeeded in concluding both a commercial and a political treaty with the Shah. Under the commercial treaty the Persian ports were opened to English and Indian traders, under the protection of the Shah’s Government. The political treaty was directed against the Afghans and the French. In ISOd the Russians resumed their encroachments in the north-west, and Eath Ali Shah, finding that he could not cope with them, directed his envoy at Bombay to request the assistance of the British Government. Great Britain, however, was at that time in alliance with Russia and could not move in the matter. The Shah then made overtures to France. Napoleon at once sent an envoy to Tehran, an offensive and defensive treaty was signed etween lance and Persia in 1807, and the services of French officei •s were lent to reorganise the Persian army. The Government of India, alarmed at this, sent Malcolm on a second mission in 1808. French influence was, however, too powerful for him, and he returned unsuccessfully to Bombay About the same time Sir Harford Jones was despatched on a mission to'Persia by the Home Government, Meanwhile the Shah had become utterly dissatisfied with the French alliance. The french envoy had assured him that, in the event of a treaty between France and Russia, a stipulation should be inserted for the icsteration of Georgia to Persia. The treaty of Tilsit had been concluded in 1807 but no provision had been made for the cession of the territory in T Ace , 0 rdm 4 V th j * ren ? h enVoy was dismis s&lt;M a few days before Sir cludeVl e'f &gt;D&lt;JS a 1 ma , and shortly afterwards a preliminary treaty was con cluded between England and Persia.

In 1S12 the Persian army was surprised and cut to pieces by the Russians near Aslanduz. Whilst Great Britain and Persia were drawn tog-ether as allies in Asia, the former country was beginning to co-operate with Russia in Europe against Napoleon. The diplomatic complication of being engaged in a close and defensive alliance with two powers, who were at war with each other, led to an attempt on the part of the British Ambassador to recon cile the differences between the Courts of St. Petersburg and Tehran. The result was that the treaty of Gulistan was concluded in 1813, by which Persia ceded to Russia all the territory she had acquired, and engaged to maintain no navy on the Caspian. In 1814 Mr Ellis, in conjunction with Mr. Morier, concluded a treaty with Persia, by which England agreed to supply aid lXl’ 4 eai y TeJl '' an ’ in troops or money, in the event of the invasion of Persia, provided that the Shah was not the aggressor. From this time a British Envoy always resided at the Persian Court. In 1821 a war broke out between Persia and Turkey. The Persians were at first successful, but operations were suddenly suspended owing to the appearance of cholera in the Persian camp. By the treaty of Erzerum, con cluded in 1823, each power retained the territories which were in its pos session at the commencement of the war. The ill-defined boundary, left by the treaty of Gulistan, had afforded the Russians a pretext for constant disputes. Every oppor tunity was taken to exasperate the Persians, and in 1826 war again broke out. A Persian army crossed the frontier, but was defeated and driven lack, and the Russians invaded Persia and occupied Tabriz. The war was brought to a close by the treaty of Turkmanchai, by which the existing frontier was laid down, Persia paying a war indemnity and again agreeing to maintain no vessels of war on the Caspian. The British Government held that Persia had been the aggressor in this war, and that, accordingly, our obligations under the treaty of Tehran did not apply. Further, the articles, by which we agreed to help Persia in case of aogression by another power, were abrogated for a pecuniary compensation on the 25th August 1828. In December 1828 M. Grebayadov was sent as Russian envoy to Tehran. He aroused the indignation and fanaticism of the population by detaining two women of Erivan in his house, against their wish. The house was mobbed, and M. Grebayadov was murdered. Luckily for Persia the Emperor Nicholas was just about to engage in a war with Turkey; a humble embassy proceeded to St. Petersburg and succeeded in appeasing his indignation. During the next few years the Persian army, under Abbas Mirza the Vali Ahad, or heir apparent, was employed in strengthening the ShalPs hold on Khurasan, Karman and Yazd. Herat was invested in 1833 by Muhammad Mirza, his son. The siege, however, was subsequently raised on news arriving of the death of Abbas Mirza. Muhammad Mirza was then nominated Yali Ahad. On the death of Path Ali Shah, October 23rd, 1834, there were three claimants for the throne. His grandson, Muham- Accession of Muham- fr)a ^ jyiirza the Vali A bad, however, received the support of the British Government and secured the succession. His son, a child named Nasr-ud-Din, was proclaimed Vali Ahad.60 Muhammad Shah from the first harboured designs on Herat, although warned by Sir Henry Ellis, our special envoy, that such Persian designs on p ve t en sions could not be recognised by the British Eerat ' Government. Herat was invaded in November 1837, and, as the Shah refused to listen to the remonstrances of our envoy, Mr. McNeill, the Indian Government despatched^ British expedition to ema ]i expedition to the Persian Gulf in the spring of the Persian Gulf 1838. This force of under 500 men was landed on Kharag island near Bushire. Exaggerated accounts of its dimensions, reaching Herat, produced alarm in the Persian camp. About the same time Mr. McNeill sent a message to the Shah, by Colonel Stodart, to the effect that if the Siege of Rerat raised, g &gt; e g e 0 £ Herat were not raised, the British would proceed to hostilities. This mission was successful, and the Shah commenced his retirement towards Tehran on the 9th September. The Shah subsequently agreed to a treaty with the Chief of Kandahar, by which he relinquished ail claims to Afghan territory. In 1842 the differences between England and Persia having been amicably adjusted, the British contingent was withdrawn from the Persian Gulf. . ■ * t.t x Muhammad Shah died on September 4th, 18-18, and 2 )j». was succeeded by his son Nasr-ud-Din. In 1852 the Persians occupied Herat without opposition The British Minister, however, remonstrate! with such effect, that the Shah’s Government engaged itself not to interfere again in Herat affairs. At the outbreak of the Crimean war the Shah wished to throw in his lot with the allies, but was dissuaded by the British Minister, as it was consider ed that neither England nor France would be in a position to protect Persia from the vengeance of Russia. In 1854 a misunderstanding arose, nominally about the appointment of a „ . Persian Secretary to the British Mission to Persia, relations* ^ } P ° maUc l n December 1855 the attitude of the Persian Gov ernment towards the British Legation necessitated the breaking off of diplomatic relations, and Mr. Murray, our representative, retired to Baghdad. The true cause of this misunderstanding would appear to be the resentment felt by the Shah at not being allowed to join in the war against Russia. The same year Muhammad Yusuf, a Sadozai Prince and grandson of a former ruler of Herat, murdered Sayid Muhammad Khan and seized the chief power. A few mouths later he applied to Persia for aid against Dost Muhammad of Afghanistan, and, early in 1856, Persian troops advanced on Siege and fall of Herat. The Heratis were severely defeated at Ghorian Herat. and the city was occupied in October 1856. On the 1st November 1856 the V iceroy of India declared war on Persia, and on the 4th December Kharag island was re-occup&gt;ied, without opposition, Anglo-Persian rear of t?

This position was occupied on the 5 th, after a trivial skirmish, a quantity of stores and camp- equipage falling into our hands. On the 7th General Outram moved back ou Bushire, followed by the Persian army, 7,OUO strong, to which he gave battle on the 8 th near the Village of Kushab (Vulg : Kasha). The Persians were utterly routed, leaving 700 dead and two guns behind. On the 18th March General Outram, with 4-,800 men and 12 guns, left Bushire for Muhammera by sea. He was accompanied by 4 armed steamers and 2 war sloops. Muhammera was occupied by a Persian army of 13,000 men. and 30 guns, under Prince Khalai Mirza. The mouth of the Karun had also been strongly fortified. This position was captured on the 26th March, with but few casualties. The Persians lost heavily and abandoned 16 guns, besides quantities of tents, baggage and stores. On the 29th a naval expedition, under Commander Rennie, sailed up the Karun. The ships reached Ahwaz on the 1st April and about 300 men were landed to attack the Persian army, some 10,000 strong, which was posted on the right bank opposite Ahwaz. The Persian force was so demoralised that it fled in confusion, abandoning great stores of grain. By the treaty of Paris, ratified at Baghdad on the 2nd May 1857, Persia agreed to abstain from all interference in the affairs of Treaty Of Paris. Afghanistan. The force at Muhammera embarked for India on the 15th May, a de tachment remaining on Kharag till February 1858, owing to the delay of the Persians in evacuating Lash and Juwain on the Sistan frontier. The rulers of Oman had held Bandar Abbas, Kishm, Hormuz and the „ . - snlnhur mines of Khamir, in farm from the Shah of Bandar Abbas, etc. Persia since 1798, for an annual payment of 6,000 tomans In 1854, however, the Persians drove out the Sayid’s officials and garrisons A treaty was concluded in 1856 by which the SaykFs Governor was virtually reduced to the condition of a Persian vassal, removeable at the caprice of the Governor of Shiraz. . . After the war with England in 1857, the Persians commenced a series of encroachments on their eastern frontier. In 1866 they claimed as far as a point between Chahbar and Gwadar, on the Makran coast, and forcibly as serted no^ses^ion over the whole of Western Baluchistan. In the same year SUnm was (.ccupied by Persian troops. In mo Sir F. Goldsmid was sent out as Commissioner for the settlement of the boundary limiting Persian encroachment on Baluchistan and Sistan (see also pages 3 and 4). _ In 1805 the plunder of two British vessels, by the Jowasmi pirates, pro voked the 1 st naval expedition for their punishment. Suppression of piracy in Qth er expeditions followed in 1809 and 1819. In the the Persian Qulf. latter year the capture and occupation of the pirate stronghold of Ras-al-Khaimab, on the Oman coast, was followed by the 1st general treaty between the British Government and the combined Arab Chieftains As this agreement did not prevent the traffic in slaves, it was supplemented between 1838 and 1856 by further successive treaties, giving the right of search and confiscation to British vessels, and prohibiting the exnort of slaves from Arab ports. Other successive engagements were entered Xby the Arab Chiefs, between 1835 and 1843, by which they pledged them selves not to engage in hostilities by sea. Finally, in 1853, a “ Treaty of62 1 ’erpetual Peace’ , was concluded, which provided for a complete cessation rf hostilities at sea, between the subjects of the subscribing- parties, and for arbitration, in case of aggression or disputes, by the British Resident in the Gulf, the British Government engaging itself to watch over the peace of the Gulf and ensure at all times the observance of the treaty.

The new station, and also one which was tried on the south coast of Henjam Island, being found equally unhealthy, a move was eventually made to Basidu, at the extreme N. W. corner of Kishm Island, which became the head-quarters of the Indian Naval Squadron, and where a detachment of Indian troops was regularly maintained until 1879, when it was moved to Jask, and remained there till 1887. Basidu still remains the property of the British Government. A telegraph station was at one time established on Henjam Island, to connect Jask with Bushire, but was abolished in 18^1. The first Anglo-Persian Telegraph Convention was concluded in Febru. ary 1868, and by the end of 1864 a single wire line had been completed from Khanikin, on the Turkish frontier, to Tehran, and from Tehran to Bushire where it joined a marine cable to Karachi. On the 31st January 1870 the line of the Iudo-Kuropean Telegraph Company was opened between London and Tehran, where it joined the already existing wires to Bushire and Kara chi. In spring 1889 the British and Russian Governments established Con sulates at Mashhad. On the 10th November 1890 the Shah signed an agreement with Russia, by which he hound himself neither to construct rail- ways in Persia, nor to grant any concession for their construction, for a period of 10 years from that date.

From the 8 th to the 16th century the trade of the Persian Gulf was in the hands of the Arab tribes, who had colonised the maritime border of Persia. In November 1497 Vasco da Gama doubled the Cape of Good Hope and discovered a new waterway to the east. Within ^century m0n0V ° ly ' next few years the Portuguese planted their flag upon every point of vantage, and the Persian Gulf, like the Indian ocean, became a practically closed sea for any but vessels of that l,n nation. 4 Janw,' The Anglo-Russian, or Muscovy, Company was founded in the 16th British attempts to century, with a view to establishing an overland t° Miirti! trade by the overland trade with Persia, via Russia, and so competing with tents ete r0! '' e ’ the Portuguese. The enterprise was prosecuted in a most tlie lain persevering and plucky manner, and six successive expeditions were despatched, ier to cat:but this and other attempts, which were made in the 17th and 18th centuries, eircoDstmt all ended in failure. In 1578 the crowns of Spain and Portugal became united, and, 10 years HV The East India Company. later, the maritime supremacy of the two taffar-irt powers was shattered by the destruction of on of Hetl: the Invincible Armada. The English were not slow to take advantage of crisis jfcvAhis event, and in 'GOO the East India Company received its first charter from Queen Elizabeth. The Company had not been long in existence before its Jit, agents were found in Persia. In 1615 Shah Abbas granted a firman, which ^ provided “ that all Governors of seaports in Persia shall kindly entertain the ‘i.ntp'S^h shipping ”. Isfahan. In lo 1 9 a was In 1617 British factors were permanently settled at factory was established at Jask, whence the overland trade was conducted with the Persian capital. In 1622 the English, in al liance with the Persians, turned the Portuguese out of Hormuz, and acquired a position of commercial ascendancy at Gombrun, which was afterwards given its present name of Bandar Abbas, in honour of the victory. Almost simultaneously with the formation of the first English East ^ India Company, a similar association was formed in Tr.^cmr.ULo.. j, / F ' rench establishment existed at Isfahan till the Afghan invasion in 1722, and they also possessed a factory at Bandar half ® Abbas, but the enterprise as a trade venture appears to have been a failure. The Dutch appeared in Persia in 1623. They first settled at Hormuz, 1 t\ i t xx- whence they moved their factory to Bandar Abbas, in » ^ the reign of Abbas II. The/also possessed business bouses at Isfahan and Basra. In 1754 they occupied and fortified Kharag Island, and held it till 1765. It became a flourishing settlement and a great emporium of trade for the Persian Gulf. lands ffif64 The English suffered greatly from the Dutch competition and, in the 17th century, occupied au inferior position in the Persian Gulf. During the 18th century, however, the tables were turned. In 1763 Bushire was selected as the head-quarters of the British Company, _ and, although it was temporarily relinquished in 1770 in favour of Basra.it was re-occupied three years later. In 1812 the commercial residency at Bushire was abolished and aPolitical Agent left in its place. In 1822 a general revision took place of the various stations in the Persian Gulf. Factors and brokers were thenceforward styled residents and native agents, and the entire establishment was rendered a political charge. In 1872 the superintendence of the Persian Gulf littoral was transferred from the Bombay Government to the Government of India. 8 —ADMINISTRATION. System of administuation. Persia is divided into provinces, ruled by Governor Generals, or Governors who are appointed by, and are directly responsible to, the Crown; these are further sub-divided into districts, cities and towns, the Deputy Governors of which are either nominated directly by the Shah or by the Gover nor or Governor General of the province to which they belong. Under the Deputy Governors are the darogas or heads of police, the kalantars or chief ma gistrates of cities, and the kadkhuclas or magistrates of different wards or villages. The administrative sub-divisions of Persia are not permanent., their separa tion or combination being regulated by the ability or reputation of their Governors, by the confidence or fears of the sovereign, or by the amount of present offered. Every official has to purchase his appointment and to pay for his contiuuance in office by a present once a year, frequently almost equivalent to the salary that he receives. In Persia there are two branches of judicature. The written law, _ founded on the Kuran and termed shara, is administer- ega a minis i a ion. ^ |,y f.} )e p r j es k s&gt; or customary law, which is administered by the civil officials, has reference to local as well as common usages and varies in different parts of the country. The ecclesiastical order pretend that the shara, or divine law, which they administer, should take cognizance of all cases whatever ; while the courts of urf, or customary law, supported by the temporal power, have sue- ceeded in limiting their functions to the settlement of disputes about religious ceremonies, inheritance, marriage, divorce, contracts, sales, and all civil cases: and reserve to themselves the decision on all proceedings respecting murder, theft, fraud, and every crime that is capital, or that can be called a breach of the public peace. The chief priests of Persia are called Mujtahids. They have no specific duties, but exercise a great, though undefined, power over the courts of shara, or written law, the judges of which constantly submit cases to their superior knowledge. The next in rank to the Mujtahid is the Shekh- ul-Islam, the supreme judge of the court of shara. There is a Shekh- ul-lalam to every principal city in Persia. He is nominated by the Shah and receives a salary. In large cities there is a kazi or judgc&gt; un ^ ei ; the Shekh-ul-Islam, and the latter has in general the further aid of a council of mullahs. In the lesser towns there is only a kazi. The villages have“petition^ seldom more than an inferior mullah, who can read a few sentences of Arabic, '« 8 iaoG|(; which entitles him to perform the ceremonies at a marriage or funeral, to hl?(i3Ss ; make out common deeds, and to decide on plain and obvious cases. 'When anl, alttasj subjects of intricacy occur, he refers to the hazi of the neighbouring town, by whom the case is often carried before the court of the Shekh-ul- Wire tfs;' Islam. general rtrij r ^'^ e ur f&gt; or customary law, bears some resemblance in its cognizance of itorsaailrfi P e tty offences to that kind of authority which, in better ordered communi- ieentires^ tics, is vested in police magistrates. But the magistrates in Persia always perinWfu exercise the chief local authority, and consequently are above the law, kiy Gweim i ns t ea&lt; d of being checked by it. Their decrees are instantly enforced by the strong hand of power. They are prompt and arbitrary in their decisions ; and, as they seldom bestow much time in the consideration of evidence, they are continually liable to commit injustice, even if their intentions are pure. The principal check upon them is the dread of superiors, to whom the injured, may always appeal. overnor Gut »nsiblflto,ii i(i tomi Matm- hentwkr jr repntite ar, ireijodf re.

The revenue of Persia may be divided into two headings : fixed revenue) or maliat, and irregular revenue. , , The fixed revenue is derived from 4 sources : (1) regular taxation ; (2) revenues from Crown lands ; (3) castoms ; (i) rents and leases. The irregular revenue is derived from 3 sources : (I) oaatr or public re- quisitions ; ( 2 ) Pishkash or presents on JSao lioz, March 21st, the Persian New Year's day, and on the prophet’s birthday, Eed-i-Maolud (3) extraordinary Pishkash, arising from presents, fines, bribes, confiscations, etc. ^ ^ Regular taxation is nominally three-fold in character, consisting of the land tax, taxes on animals, flocks and herds, and taxes Regular Taxation. ^ shopkeepers, artisans and trade. These various taxes are levied according to the differing nature of localities, peoples, and occupations^hick ^ ^ that i s dedicated to religious purposes, such as land attached to mosques, and land held upon Land Tax. ^ bagig of f eu( | a ] PerV ice, is exempt from the land tax ; but it is levied on all other landed property. The assessment is com. monly based upon the nature or amount of the water-supply.^ If that is obtained from a flowing stream, 20 per cent, of the produce is paid, after deducting the value of the seed and an allowance for reapers and thrashers. If watered from kanats, or aqueducts, 15 per cent, is paid. Ground watered from wells, reservoirs, or entirely dependent on rain, pays from 5 to 10 per cent. The system, however, varies in different paits of the country, and even in different parts of the same province. Thus amongst the Khashkais a land taxis combined with a poll tax and a tax on animals. In 1884 the taxes in the Ardakun district were as follows : every 9 square yards of good corn land 2 krans, poll tax 1 to 5 tomans, mules 10 , cows and donkeys 5, walnut trees 1, bees per hive 1 kran, young swarms 10 shahis. Shopkeepers were taxed from 10 to 35 krans. In 1881 the Bakhtiaris of the Chahar Lang paid a lump sum of 20,000 tomans to Isfahan, and equipped a force of 200 horses in addition. The tax was collected by the llkhani in money and kind on animal and agricultural produce. _ _ Ja In Sistan there is a land tax of, nominally, one-third of the total land produce, also a tax on every yoke of oxen of 1 kran, on cattle at 1 kran per head, on sheep and goats at shahis per head. There is also a tax of 1 kran per laden camel. According to the character of the local produce, or to ancient custom the tax is paid in cash or in kind. About-^th of the entire amount is pad in the latter fashion, usually in wheat, barley, rice, or chopped straw. The taxes are farmed out by the Government, to influential persons, for a fixed money payment, and are generally raised in lump sums from villages, towns or districts, the allocation in subordinate areas being left to the arbitrary decision of local governors, chiefs or headmen. Frequently the owner of a property farms his own taxes from the hov- ernment, so as to escape the visits of the official assessor. Assessments, again, are in the main wholly obsolete in date and character. Many of them tter® made in remote periods, and have never been modified in spite of subsequen changes. Some districts are heavily overtaxed, others undertaxed, t anomalies of an obsolete assessment being perpetuated by the venali'y of 1 modern assessor. 0 tliaste' of or |try. He ltdihi.

The taxation on animals, flocks and herds exists in two forms, either as a supplementary method of land taxation, as indicated above, or as the sole available method of contribution by the iliat or nomad tribes. The rate of this taxation varies all over the country. . _ ... The taxation on shopkeepers, artisans and trade is sometimes in the . form of a capitation or poll tax and at others as a 20 Trade tax. p er cent, impost on the profits of trade.

Dating from the reign of Nadir, much land has been seized, by succes sive sovereigns, from the priests and the principal families of the country. Since the accession of the present Shah, however, a large portion of the Crown lands has been sold to influential persons at nominal prices. About {th of the maliat, or fixed revenue, is raised by customs duties on import and export of merchandise. These are sold Customs. highest bidder.* Upon foreign merchandise, import and export, an ad valorem duty of 5 per cent, is charged once for all at the port of entry or depaituie, in accord ance with tbe commercial treaties concluded with the majority of foreign P Native Persian merchants pay a lower duty at the port, commonly about 2 to 3 per cent. ; but they are liable to taxes en route, levied on the number of loads, cases or bales. From this it follows that, at the port of entry, the British merchant can be undersold by the native merchant, while on the line Karman-Shiraz the conditions are about equal and further inland the customs are rather in favour of the British merchant. This explains the fact that while in Shiraz there is only one British merchant, there are 3 large European establishments in Isfahan. „ o -n • It is proposed to hand over the control of the customs of Southern Persia, including Karmanshah, to M. Naus from the 25th March 1900. This official, who is a Belgian, has already been most successful m the north ot Persia, both in checking abuses and also in preventing leakages and his administration of the customs of the southern ports will probably benefit both the foreign merchants and also the native population to a very consid erable extent. * The following are believed to be the amounts paid by farmers of customs,] at the Persian Gulf ports, within tho jurisdiction of the Governor of Bushire. 1897-98. 1898-99 £ £ Bandar Dilam ... „ Rig Bushire ...

If an addition is made to the army, if the king desires to construct an aqueduct or build a palace, if troops are marching through the country, and require to be furnished with provisions, if a foreign mission arrives in Persia, if one of the royal family is married,— in short, on any occurrence, not ordinary,—an impost is laid, sometimes upon the whole Kingdom, and at others only on particular provinces. This is regulated by the nature of the occurrence, which requires the supply, and a consideration of its local or general application. The sadir extends to all classes. It ought to be levied according to defined rules, every person paying in the proportion that he pays the maliat, or fixed revenue. The Governors of provinces, however, usually exercise an arbitrary discretion in the col lection of this tax, which renders it more oppressive. They settle the gross amount that each village is to pay ; and this affords them an opportunity of showing paitiahty and committing injustice. The levy of ' sadir } however, does not appear to have been enforced of late years. \.\\q ftish/eash or presents, offered to the Shah on the Persian New Year ; s PishkasTi. a . n( ^ on man y other oecasions, when it is desirable to gain favour or to avert disgrace, have, from long established usage, become fixed and permanent.

Army.—T here is no Persian army in the real sense.* Of a total of some 60,000, quite half exist on paper only. The remaining 30,000 are an untrained rabble, absolutely useless from a military point of view. About 12,000 of them are armed, principally with percussion guns or other antiquated wea pons, but the bulk of these are stationed in the north. Their training is absolutely nil, and the officers are even more useless than the rank and file. .1 hroughout Persia gunners are Azarbaijanis, and. are relatively more efficient than the infantry. Ihe Zil-es-Sultan has, perhaps, 400 men under arms, who bear traces of a slightly superior training, armed with Werndls. Shiraz and Shustar are garrisoned by 2 regiments of Azarbaijan hv- iantry, together with a few gunners. There is an infantry regiment at Karman and another in Narmashir, x&gt;th armed with \\ erndl rifles, and in addition there is an artillery organisa tion, at the former place, with 4 Uehatius guns and an arsenal in fair order. At Bam there is a fort and citadel, in fair preservation, with a few gunners anu some M. L. smooth bores. The 2 infantry regiments garrison Karman, . &gt;am, ranraj, (Baluchistan) etc., and are frequently sent in winter to assist in overawing the Baluchis, as in 1898-99. lor eastern Persia there are 2 regiments, one of which is always dis- un ec w n e t re ether garrisons Sistan ; they are raised principally in the Snnn.khana district (East of Birjaod) and arc for the most part Sunni Muhammadans.

There is a small force of gunners divided between Birjand and Nasratabad (the capital of Sistan) with a few antiquated field pieces. * ' Possible sighting MMEHUL.-The Persians, as a rule, are of very good p } sique , they possess great powers of endurance in marching, and are Major Sawj Q to 3,001) Consul Prf i men in 10 men, all to-A 1 i, to be issuf 0 Wein&lt; munition i ieh were c fee probabb In 1891 At about there is to turn i Her Hr December 18 imported int being re-exp fc, parti bthislattei kth-Wes76 notes, as to kinds of rifles generally seen in South-West Persia are hv Captain E.

Another factor complicatino- the situation is that the Lurs, unlike the Bakhtiaris, have no recognised Chiefs, and between Dizful and Burujird there are no less than 7 tribes, which makes negociations difficult. It was reported in 1899, however, that the Ain-ud-Daula had concluded an agreement with the Derikwand Lurs, by which the latter agreed to keep open the Khuramabad-Dizful trade route. Disturbances in and about Lingah are due to the fact that Shekh Muhammad-bin-Khalifa* is still at large. Owing to the weakness of the Persian officials, and the supposed con nivance of the Kawam, the Tangistanis make life and property very uncertain in the country around Bushire, The roads leading from Bandar Abbas to the interior are far from being in a safe condition, owing to the raiding pro pensities of the Bashakardis and the Afshars. The Persians keep no troops permanently in Makran, their rule being maintained by periodical raids to levy revenue, iu the course of which the country is laid waste, and cultivation destroyed, innocent people being killed or ruined. The Baluchis have in consequence a deep hatred for the Persians, and the history of the Baluchistan littoral, of late years, consists of successive revolts, followed by successive conquests by the Persians, who are always able to overcome the Baluchis, owing to the inability of the latter to combine, and to their readiness to betray one another, should a favourable opportunity occur. In 1897 the distress, consequent on the failure of the crops for three years in succession, and the unrest which arose on the death of the Shah, led to a widespread revolt. The murder of Mr. Graves, the Telegraph official referred to on page 6:2, was undoubtedly due to this cause, while the distur bances appear to have bfen intimately connected with the rising in British Baluchistan. In Persian Baluchistan, Sardar Husen Khan, of the old ruling family, still defies the Persian Government. The state of Sistan is also one of chronic disorder, owing to the friction between the 2 orothers, the Hashmat-ul-Mulk and the Shaukat-ul-Mulk, the former being Governor of Sistan and Tabas, and the latter Amir of Kain. External Relations. —The external relations of Persia are conducted through the usual diplomatic channels, Great Britain, Austro-Hungary, Belgium, France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Russia, Turkey and the Unhed States all having diplomatic representatives at Tehran. The foreign policy of Persia, however, practically resolves itself into her relations with the rival powers of Great Britain and Russia, her Government being mainly brought info contact with other European nations and with America in matters affecting missionaries and trade.
