I am the oldest farash in this Agency having served honestly and loyally for the last 20 years. During this long period I never gave chance of complaint to any of my officers and superiors. At present I am drawing Rs. 48/6/- p.m.,Es. 31 as pay and Es. 17/6/- as dear- ness allowance. From Ist September 1927 I was drawing Es. 35 as pay. In 1940 the Assistant Political Agent was displeased with me and reduced me to the time scale of other farashes, i.e., in the scale of Es. 20-1-30. Compared with my present pay the newly engaged farashes are getting Es. 40 p.m. (pay Es. 20 plus dearness allowance Es. 20). I beg to submit that I am an Indian serving in a foreign country, am 51 years old and rendered 20 years service therefore I deserve some consideration* 3 # For the last ^ years I have been drawing pay in the scale of Es. 20-1-30 therefore I request that my case may now kindly be reconsidered .

Memorandum ^ ^ ' Reference correspondence resting with Residency Printed Letter No.1475-64/283, dated the 31st March, 1945. 2. As reported separately the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the Bahrain Government have recently increased the wages paid to their Arab labourers. It will also be observed from the enclosed statement that there have been considerable in creases in the prices of many essential foodstuffs since March 1945, when the last increase in the emoluments of the menial establishment^ was made, while there have been only slight decreases in the cost of a few. 3. I have discussed the case with those concerned, and I am satisfied that, for the present at any rate, an increase in their pay at a flat rate of Rs.10/- per month will satisfy them. This is modest indeed compared to the Re.V- a day granted by the Bahrain Petroleum Company, and I recomraend that this increase be sanctioned with effect from the 1st September, 1947. 4. The additional expenditure involved will amount to approximately Rs.300/- per month to be met from the Office Allowance and the Launch Grant of this Agency; and it is req uested that early sanction be accorded to disuade the menial staff from leaving in search of more profitable employment. 5. If this increase is made, the revised emoluments of the menials will be as follows:- Farrashes . 1. Ahmed bin Jassim, - 2. Mohamed Qgcyum 3. Isa bin Ibrahim 4. Tahir bin Mohamed 5. Hasan Folad 6.

To The Secretary to His Excellency the Political Resident Reference my memorandum No.R-74-1/5 dated the 23rd May 1948 regarding an increase in the pay of the menial staff of this Agency. I would be grateful to have an early reply. in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain MEMORANDUM s-&lt;£7 'Jt- For Political Agent, Bahrain NNRPOLITICAL AGi^CT, BAHRAIN, The 4th December, 1948. Abdul Rasool has worked in the Agency as a farrash from 6th July 1948 to 31st October, 1948. His services were dispensed with as he was surplus on the strength of the menial establishment. His work during the period has been satisfactory.I have the honour to state that the amount of Rs.10/- which was given to me as an increment is really very small amount when it is compared with the other increments that have been given to the Farrashes of this office. As you are already aware, some of the Farrashes have been given Rs.25/- as increment, though I am intitled to the same due to the fact that I served with the Agency for a period of 15 years during which I became a head Farrash. In addition to that, I am serving the coffee and had in many occasions proved my ability in fulfiling my duties with faithfulness and satisfaction. I am drawing at present Rs,90/- while some of the menial staff draw Rs.85/-. I should be very grateful if your honour could recommend me for a further increment in the light of the prevailing hard economic conditions. I beg to remain, Your most obedient servant.@ Political Agency, j/s: Bahrain, No.B-346-47^4^ July 23, 1949. Dear Residency, Our menial staff want gratuities for the 2. We notice that they had gratuities at Xmas and propose to tell them that they must make up their minds whether they are good dhristians or good Muslems. If the former, they can get Xmas boxes but nothing for the Id and if the latter, they can get something for the Id and no Xmas boxes. 3. The Foreign Office will certainly not pay both. We trust you concur and will adopt a similar line with the Residency menials. Yours ever. Agency* The Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain. o, LfcrVrmAi •:o /(•&gt;^ , (i / 25/49) i. PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, ^ BAHRAIN. 3rd August, 1949. t, Dear Agency, Your letter R-346-4/49 of 23rd July. We consider that you should pay gratuities as you see fit. We have however the following comments to make. It would seem reasonable to pay them at the 'Id, when the menial staff are celebrating and have extra expenditure, rather than at Christmas which is a purely arbitrary date fixed by our own religious prejudices. In fact, it is not altogether true that the Foreign Office will not pay both, provided that the total sum authorised for gratuities for the yefr is not surpassed; it would be possible to pay half the sum at Christmas and the other half at the Id. In Cairo in the past it was the practice to pay out gratuities on two occasions, namely the two Bairams. 2. Provided that a firm line is taken, we do not think it matters whether the Residency and the Agency follow the same line or not. We are in any case more militantly Christian than you are on the subject of our weekly holiday. The impor tant thing is that each office should lay down its practice, once and for alljpresumably in accor dance with its own convenience and the wishes the staff. Your s ever 'mM RESIDEFfCi, Political Agency, Bahrain.Political Agency, Bahrain, No.R- (1} 20th April 1950 Dear Residency, Our launch driver, Abdullah bin Salih, who is leaving us after six years 1 satisfactory service has approached us for the grant of gratuity. We should be glad to know whether under the Foreign Office rules he is entitled to its payment and if so at what rate. A copy of the relevant rules, if any, may please be sent to us. Yours ever. Agency. The Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain. NNR&gt;2* TBfflffl 283/8/50 13^ BRITISH RESIDENCY, BiiHRiilN, 3rd May, 1950. Dear Agency, Please refer to your letter R-173 of 20th April. 2. It is regretted that no gratuities are payable under Foreign Office rules. 3. We have been considering the possibility of asking permission to pay gratuities to staff who were employed by the Government of India and who would on account of their length of service, have received gratuities, had they not been taken over by the Foreign Office, We are, however, awaiting a reply to our letter 104/24/50 of April 17th to you and other Agencies\ DiM^re making recommendations.
