Themes covered include: Britain’s duty to protect the pearl banks for the benefit of the Arab pearl divers, acknowledgement of growing national and international interest in the pearl banks, the extent of territorial waters, and the likely result of any legal challenges to Britain’s refusal to allow foreign interests the opportunity to exploit the Gulf’s pearl banks.2) Correspondence relating to an enquiry by a German businessman, concerning the pearl trade in the Gulf (folios 15-17).3) Printed copies of correspondence (folios 20-23) from the Persian Gulf Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Cox) and the Bahrain Political Agent (Captain Charles Mackenzie), dated 1910, concerning the increasing trade in oyster shells in the Gulf, used for the production of mother of pearl. A drop in the numbers of oysters being fished is attributed to the mother of pearl industry. A German firm based in Bahrain, Wonckhaus &amp; Co., is identified as a key exporter of oyster shells at Bahrain.4) A letter (folio 27) intercepted by the Political Agency in Bahrain, from the Secretary of the Wolverine Motor Works, U.S.A., to Robert Wonckhaus &amp; Co., dated 3 February 1915. The letter and accompanying leaflet (folios 28-29) relates to Wolverine Motor Works’ new combined compressor and propelling motor, designed specifically for use in the pearl fishing industry.5) A typewritten extract from the
