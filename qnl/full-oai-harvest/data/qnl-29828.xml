The policy advocated by the Government of India is that Bin Saud should be 'kept in play' by gifts of money but that arms and military instructors should be supplied sparingly. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Zachariah Cox and Harry St John Bridger Philby, on the other hand, favour an offensive against Hail [Ha'il] by Bin Saud, with British assistance. Also included are the following:a memorandum from the War Cabinet's Middle East Committee, on the position of Bin Rashid in relation to other Arab rulers;a note entitled 'Relations With Ibn Sa'ud', prepared by the Arab Bureau's Irak [Iraq] section, which provides a British perspective on Britain's relations with Bin Saud from 1899 onwards;notes on conversations held between Colonel Cyril Edward Wilson and Major Kinahan Cornwallis of the Arab Bureau, and Emir Abdulla [ʿAbdullāh bin al-Ḥusayn], son of King Hussein, during December 1917;a copy of a report by David George Hogarth on his interviews with King Hussein at Jeddah;a memorandum from the Political Agent at Kuwait, Colonel Robert Edward Archibald Hamilton, which is primarily concerned with relations between Kuwait and Riyadh;notes by Hamilton on Bin Saud, based on conversations with the latter at Riyadh in November 1917;correspondence between British officials regarding King Hussein's attempt to reoccupy Khurma and its impact on his relations with Bin Saud.This item features the following principal correspondents:Viceroy of India [Frederic John Napier Thesiger];Secretary to the India Office's Political Department (John Evelyn Shuckburgh);High Commissioner, Egypt (General Sir Francis Reginald Wingate);War Office;Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Zachariah Cox;Secretary of State for India [Edwin Samuel Montagu];Foreign Office;King Hussein;Bin Saud.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Cairo Intelligence Department, Arab Bureau, Iraq Section</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>War Cabinet, Middle East Committee</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of the Arab Bureau</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Hejaz</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Emir of Jabal Shammar Saʿūd bin ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz Āl Rashīd</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Percy Zachariah Cox</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Harry St John Bridger Philby</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>David George Hogarth</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100032950571.0x000001#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100032950571.0x000001#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
