My dear Colonel hiscoe, when you were here last I touched on the question of the possibility of raising the salute of the shaikh o f Kuwait . I'he Governors of Abadan, Mohammerah and the Mutasarrif of Basrah each get 7 guns from our warships, which number the shaikh of Kuwait also gets. J-he latter feels that that as an independent Kuler in special treaty relation with Great Britain, he should x ecexve more guns than me re Governors of nieghbouring jt'orts. 3• ihe Shaikh who recently made a special point of callinland opening his heart to me on this very subject, pointed out that in the estimation of Iraq generally but especi' xn the syes of the people of x&gt;asrah, Abadan and Mohammerah the fact that he the shaikh received an equal number of guns Yvith the Governors of those xowns meant nothing more^ior less tliam that his Majesty’s Government considered Kuwait equal in status with those officials. This he ventured to think, could not be the intention of Bis Majesty’s Government. the Governor of jvhuaistan, certainly a large province but not equal m status to the independent .'Yjfcgr States of Kuwait or Bahrain, was given 13 guns, or practically double what he or biiaikii Hamad al Bali fa, the friends and ancient allies of His Majesty's Government received from H.M.S.Ships of war. he Hon’ble hieutenant-Colonel H.V. ijiscoe, 2 Ihe position is' this 4 Ihe Shaikh further pointed out the anomaly that Political resident in the Persian Gulf-2 lhe sh aikh gave me the impression that he ' enly lao ' 11 of a i ) P re cia'tion by His “ajesty's Government ° f hlS i 1031 * 10 '* hut graciously added that he felt sure the arrangement Was a relic of lurhish days when it was not considered good Policy to give muwait more guns than the Mutasarrif of -asrah, under whose jurisdiction Kuwait was supposed byv Constantinople to come, G * ^ ° m Persimal opinion, if I may be permitted to elVe 13 that botl1 -oahrain and Kuwait should come under the U guns category, and that Hatar should remain at 7 guns for after all one cannot compare the importance of Hatar with either .Bahrain or Kuwait. it is certainly unfair, and in rjy view decidedly impolitic these days, when we are endeavouring to emphasize the importance and independence of both Hahrain and Kuwait via a vis Persia, rraq and aejd, to allow the local world to thiru. that v,e place these states on a par with the Governors nej. 0 hbo^_ mg ports such as pasr a h, Mohammerah and Abadan. ii-is question of salutes especially as it applies almost entirely to visits of H.M.S.Ships, is rated very high indeed among Arabs generally and the latter cannot help but come to the conclusion that if ships salute the shaikhs of Hahrain and Kuwait with the same number of guns as they give to the Governors of the abovementicned xowns, then the seniority of all five places must be the same. 1 Sha11 n0t atta “Pt to labour the point further but close this with the hope that if you can possibly see your way to do so, you will approach the Government of India in the matter and try and get them to make a more equitable distribution •salutes, before the end of 1932, 9 ‘ X ° f C0UrSe P rimar ily speak for Kuwait, but if you agree with what 1 sav a- i aa,, ao I believe you do, it naturally follows that Bahrain must receive similar treatment. ■‘■ours sicerely, .r, DichsonSection.

I do not believo.however,that it is ammatter vJiich interests Shaikh Hamad vary much owing to his simple cad laxailected nature. 3. At the present moment &gt;haikh Isa is entitled to a 11 gun salute but si nee, owing to his advanced ago, the occasion never arises for him to receive it and the Itate,therefore,only receives the comparatively trifling salute allowed to Shaikh Hamad. ^» 1 would surest that both Bahrain and Kuwait should be raised to 11 gun States, atar remaining at 7 guns as before, i would also suggest that durin,’ the life time of Shaikh Isa Shaikh Hamad,*as regent,should receive the &gt;tate ! s salute. I need hardly say that Bahrain is of far greater importaaj© to the Bmp ire than most 11 un States in India and though its area is restricted,it lias an economic 4 importance Qut of all proportion to its size.

CY Bahrain, the 2nd IJovembcr 1032 Dear Captain Crabbe, During his vist here Captain Dennison of the ‘ideford told &gt;elgrave that he only proposed to give Shaikh amau a salute of 5 guns. Fortunately,however^the death of a relative prevented an^ salute being fired at all. According to my autnorities shaikh ’Isa himself receives a personal salute of 11 guns,the Ruler of ahrain received a dynastic salute of 7 guns and the eldest son of the Ruler receives a salute of D guns, gtriculy jpealcing, there fore,Captain Dennison was correct in saying that .hrikh Hamad was only entitled to a salute of &amp; guns. He has,however invariably been accorded a salute of 7 guns and so far as I can remember the Triad has always accorded him this salute* Fhe reason for this presumably is that although ghaikh ’Isa is alive,bhaikh Hamad is fegent and de facto -uler and hence receives the salute intended for the State itself,viz 7 guns. I trust the matter can be satisfactorily explained to Captain jennison for the Shaikh’s feelings will undoubtedly be hurt if his salute were suddenly reduced fro i 7 to 5 runs. I leave on the 28th (my successor arriving by air on the 24th November), Is there any chance of your being able to put in a day or two here before he comes? I hope you can.

DALUTKS TO CHIEFS m THE FSRS1AD GULF. Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to Foreign and Political Department endorsement i$o.F.72-N/32, dated the 8th June 1931, with which was forwarded a copy of a despatch from the Secretary of state for India, Uo.l, dated the 28th April 1931, giving the list of salutes to Chiefs and Foreign officials in the Persian Gulf approved by His Imperial Majesty the King Emperor* 2. The Political Agent, Kuwait, reported some time ago that His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait made a special point of calling on him and representing that his (the Shaikh*s) receiving a salute equal in number of guns (7) to that of the Persian Governors of badan and Mohammerah and the Mutassarif of Basrah, would be taken by * Iraqis in general and the people of Basrah in particular, as placing him on an equnl status with the officials named.2 - 3* The question of salutes, especially as it applies almost entirely to visits of His Majesty’s Ships, is rated very high among the Arabs, and the impress ion which the above equality In salutes creates in the Arab mind cans ot be very favourable to His Excellency* During my recent visit to Kuwait also His Excellency raised the question personally with me* 4* X fully appreciate the Shaikh of Kuwait’s feeling in this matter and conceive that while we are endeavouring to emphasise the importance and independence of both Bahrain and Kuwait vis a vis Persia, ’Iraq, and Nejd, it seems incongruous to allow the local world to think that we place the lulers of these States on a par with the local Governors of the neighbouring ports of Basrah, Abadan, Mohamoierah, and Bandar Abbas, 1 therefore strongly recommend that the salute of the present Shaikh of Kuwait be raised to 11 guns, but that it should be made personal to him* I suggest this rather than that the Kuwait State should be raised to an 11-gun State on the grounds that while - as far as Shaikh /hmad is concerned - the increased personal salute will meet his complaint on the subject, from our point of view it may well be advisable to have something to offer his successor, whoever he may be, in the shape of an increased salute should his behaviour merit it. Shaikh Ahmad is persona with us, and in my opinion fully merits the increased personal salute suggested. It does not, however, in any way follow that his successor will be equally deserving of it. 5. With regard to Ghaikh Hamad of Bahrain I recommend that as Ruler, following the recent death of Shaikh Isa, he should-3- Iti * should receive a salute of 11 guns, made personal to him for the same reasons as X have adduced in the case ox the hhalJch correspondence ending with Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, letter ,0.1216 -S. A., dated the 26th July 1909, from which it will be seen that the present sugg estion for raising these States in the matter ol salutes, is not a new one.

Political .agency, Bahrain, the 18th June 1933• My dear Fowle, Gastrell’a arrival to ta&amp;e over charge as Political Agent,.Bahrain,will give rise to a question which should he settled before he conjee. He will he the first Political Agent to tahe over since the death of the late Shaihh and,as you know,for many years Shaikh *Isa was too feeble to pay or return calls. 2. The practice of recent years has been that Shaikh Hamad (as Deputy Ruler) has called first on the Political Agent, At that call a time was arranged for the Political Agent to call on Shaikh ♦Isa in Muharraq,and also to return Shaikh Hamad’s call. 3. My records are incomplete,but Shaikh ’Isa (as Ruler) called on the Political Agent first on the occasion of Mr.Mungavin taking over from me in 1918 axkl on the occasion of Major Daly’s taking over charge in 1921. I cannot trace when Shaikh ’Isa’s health necessitated hie ceasing to pay calls. 4. I am inclined to think that the time mey have coiue to introduue the principle of the in-coming Political Agent calling first on the Shaikh,as it is in our interests to emphasise his status as an independent Ruler. He has now eleven guns as a personal salute,and it seems anomalous for a Ruler to pay the first call on an officer accredited to him. Moreover,the conditions in the past were rather different from those of the present day. In Qatar the Political Agent pays the first call on the Shaikh. I should,however,before making a definite recommendation,like to know what happens at Muscat and Kuwait.I Have served at Kuwait,but have forgotten what 5. I do not think that Shaikh Kamad himee the courtesy,as he is almost embarrassing in his when a iolitical Agent returns from a recess or &lt; absence; but if the change is to be made,the pre immediately after the death of Shaikh *Iea seems appropriate moment at which to make it.

On 1st October 1931 the definition of ’Indian Waters' in Article 61 was amended (Amendment Ho.11/31) so as to exclude, amongst other areas, the ^ersian Gulf. His Excellency the Commander-In-Chief will therefore no longer be accorded in the ^ersian Gulf the two additional guns mentioned above and will receive only the salute he is entitled to under Article 66 of the King’s Regulations and Admiralty Instructions, 19P6, by virtue of his naval rank, Salute in the Persian Gulf of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief Memorandum Bbr information* Hntil 1st October 1931, under the definition # ■ 1 IS X ^ ' Admiral/Confidential * The [Residency, D.0.NO.792-S of 1933 Bushire, the 3rd July 1933.

At Muscat, where the Sultan is His Highness and gets 21 guns, both the Political Agent and the Political Resident make the first call. 3. I think on the whole that as far as Bahrain is concerned we had better leave things as they are for the present, (unless the Shaikh raises the question, which he probably won’t), i.e. that the Shaikh should make the first call. The Shaikh’s salute of 11 guns is after all only a personal one and not attached to the office of the Shaikh. or the Shaikh 2 I enclose copy of a letuer No.138 of £9th cf - c.COITFISiKIITIAI .

The new Political Agent then makes his return official call on the seme day (in uniform) accompanied by the retiring Political Agent (also in uniform). 3. . Subsequent calls between the Shaikh and the Political Agent are always informal, except on the official occasions such as the Kings Birthday (when the Shaikh calls on the Political Agent) and important Mohammedan festivals, (when the P.A, call on the Shaikh). Such calls are made in uniform and are not returned. 4. Here, I have always tried to arrange that the Shaikh and I pay one informal call each week. Tnis keeps relations good and pleases the Shaikh. 5 . Should the Political Agent or Shaikh go away, on leave, or for a few days, outside Kuwait limits, the person returning is always met, if he comes by the desert route, some 10 miles out of the Town by the other party, and simi larly on board ship if the return is by sea. This is an Arab custom and has always been care fully adhered to in Kuwait. 6 .

Re Calls* ^ S.JToiSI On tiie evening of the 23rd July 1933 Captain Dennison seemed to think that 'informal” calls were not in order as though the f Bideford 1 had 'been to Bahrain during the current year the Shaikh was absent at the time. 2). I immediately admitted that that fact had not been knovm to me,and as expressed in my d.o my scheme of 'informal' calls was a suggestion and that only if he approved of it would it be followed, I was only trying to come to a mutual agreement and that as nothing had been fixed up with the Shaikh,it was only too easy to indicate that calls would be 'official'. Eventually Captain Dennison said that,as the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf,had only just visited Bahrain,he thought the calls might be 'informal' this time though he deprecated any 'slackness' in such matters especially after all the fuss made over the i ncreases in salutes etc.,etc., 24-7-1933.H.M.S ^Bideford *. 24th July 1933 , I met Captain Dennison when he landed at the Customs Pier at about 09*15 hours and took him in the Agency Car to call on His Excellency the Ruler at the c^asr at 09*30. Captain Dennison was in full dress white and I was in silk suiting. VVl 2. His Excellency meti&amp;s usual at top of stairs and was attended by Shaikh Muhammad and Mr.Belgrave. The Ruler apologised for the absence of Shaikh Abdullah,who was having some medical treatment for his eyes. 3. After talk and courtesies lasting 15 to 20 minutes we took our leave and proceeded to the Agency,where His Excellency and Mr.-^elgrave followed almost at once. 3. This return call lasted 10 to 15 minutes and we were seated in the fresh breeze on front verandah. 4. His Excellency infinitely prefers the open air to a room. 5. Captain Dennison was then taken by me to Customs Pier where his launch eventually collected him at 11*15 hours. 24-7-1933.Telegram:- G.T.C. No:- 871. Dated:- ^Oth July 1933. Prom:- Political Bahrain.

Copies of my letter and the reply are attached. d. 2. I have been able to trace the Memorandum on n'c Formal Calls received under Bushire Endorsement No:1191 of the 9th June 1931. It had been wrongly filed with 'Rules relating to relative rank of Officers in the Navy, Army and Air Force',and I feel sure vras never shown to you. 3. From Colonel Dickson 1 ® Express Letter it appears to me that Kuwait s ' informal * calls arc not in accordance with Captain Greagh’s ideas. No doubt his predecessor's hemcranduEi No:23/454 of 28th May 1931 had not been shown to him* 4, May I be permitted to say that the system at Kuwait boils down to all gaIIs being ’ formal'’* as far as the Shaikh is concerned? The courtesy salute mentioned i/£ in Paragraph No;4(i)(c) is surely considered by the Navy as formal? The only difference between formal and infurmal as far as the Shaikh s uniform is concerned is the 'sword and decoration'. In Bahrain,as you know,the Shaikh always carries a sword,but always forgets his decoration! 5. As it was only myself that found any difficulty in the matter I feel diffident in suggesting that copies2 . cf these papers he sent to Captain Creagh to enable him to subfait to you his views on the matter and revise the ^ ^ ,r A ' Memorandum of 1931 - if only as regards Bahrain now that ♦Isa is dead.

There was some unpleasantness last summer over a return call on Captain Denison having been paid at the Agency and the papers should have been put up.' to you, when the question of a return call at the Agency was under consideration. Possibly, however, there may have been some special reason for the call being returned at the Agency on the present occasion - would you kindly let me know what took place ? I presume that you paid your own return call on board in any case ? please arrange for the Shaikh's return call to be paid on board. If there is really heavy weather, it would probably be best to postpone the exchange of calls. If another exchange of calls takes place M.

He said that he hoped that he himself had not troubled the Shaikh by asking him to call on board Shorehea, i think that there must hare been borne misunderstanding. Lupin arrived during a vexy hot spell and I had been to see the Shaikh the day before and found him far from well. When X told him tha* there would be official calls next day he asked me to have them early in the morning owing to the heat. Lupin had not let me know her time of arrival and I told the Shaikh that I would ask the oaptain if he would agree to calls being exchanged on shore. The Shaikh was very pleased at this. It than occurred to me that it would not be proper for a salutet to be fired for me aM not for the Shaikh, I sent a telegram to Commander Back and asked him whether he would be willing to consider our calls as exchanged this time and to have the return call of the Shaikh at the Agenoy.

Suz^n ^ I wonder if you could very kindly assist me over certain points of procedure as they affect Bahrain, and give me replies to the following questions:- (a) When Captain Fisher arrives in H.M.S. at Bahrain, I presume you go out to the ship, and pay the first official call, by virtue of the fact that Fisher holds the rank of Captain in the Royal Navy: (b) What does H • E. the Shaikh of Bahrain do? I presume Captain Fisher calls first and the Shaikh returns his call on the ship (or at the Agency) afterwards* 2. I quite realize that if Captain Fisher happens to be acting senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf at the time when his ship calls, the matter is different. It is just for ordinary visits that Lt.-Colonel G.Loch,I.A. Political Agent, BAHRAIN,calls between His Excellency the Shaikh of Bahrain, (in command) and the Political Agent* £* In Bahrain the loliticai Agent calls first on a Captain (in command) but a Captain (in command) pays the first call on the Shaikh. 3* Ordinarily the Shaikh would return a call on board, but occasionally in the past for reasons of bad weather or convenience the Shaikh 1 s return call has been paid at the a Captain Agency. 4. On one occasion a Captain (in command) was also Senior OiTlcor. Persian Gulf, during the absence of the Seni or bevel Officer , and the Shaikh then paid the first call.

To:- The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian u ulf, Bushire. Sir, Salute to Shaikh of Shar.iah . I have the honour to recommend that the salute accorded to Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar of Sharjah be increased from three guns to five guns as a -personal salute and that this honour should be granted to him on the occasion of the King*s Birthday and Silver Jubilee Celebrations in 1955. 2* You will remember that we spoke of the possibility of increasing Shaikh Sultan*s salute on one or two occasions, but decided that the time was not then ripe for such a mark of honour. 5* Shaikh Sultan was the first of the Rulers on the Trucial Coast to give us facilities in connection with the air route, and had he not done so the position of Imperial Airways would have been very difficult in view of the attitude of the Persian Government. In doing so, he undoubtedly took a considerable risk of being murdered and incurred rrsich odium. Since that time he has stood by his agreement and has placed no difficulties in our way. 4. Shaikh Sultan is the senior of the Qawasim Shaikhs and, as such, it is to our interests to do anything we can, short of internal interference in his State, to consolidate /his1 SESHR! his position and to mark his superiority over the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah and other Shaikhs of the Qa?, r asim. 5* When the air route was first opened up. Shaikh Sultan was ignorant and inclined to he boorish, but he has much improved, of late both in manners and intelligence and would, X think, be truly appreciative of, and not spoilt by, this proposed honour, were it to be granted to him.

In addition to the Shaikhs mentioned in those reports I also visited Ujman and Smm al Qttwaln and presented them with the r Jubilee Medals* and in both places was received in a most friendly manner, 3. All the hh&amp;ikhs including the above thanked me for the Jubilee Medals which I presented to them but only Charjah, al Quwala, Has al Khaimah and Qatar requested m to convey their thanks through you to His Majesty the &amp;iag* despite the fact that the brief %mw&amp;s&amp;km which 1 had written in &amp;t,,.oLc mm read out in Arabic made it quite clear that the medals were from His Majesty the hing and as a result of the friendship which their treaty rights had produced, 4* In addition to matters already reported 1 • ouid draw your attention to the fact that it has been the custom for Sloops to give Shaikh Juaa of bih&amp;i and the ^h&amp;ikh of himr'iyah a one gun salute, this practice has now been stopped by the Senior Naval Officer and caused a certain amount of bitterness In the case of Shaikh Juma and probably would nave in the case of Hi.au*iyah if 1 had visited him.

The Shaikhs of Has al JChalaah and Sharjah were parti cularly outspoken witxh regard to the corruption of the Residency Agent and his family and told me that they would not have anything to do with them and begged me to give them more opportunities of dealing direct. 6. Whilst talking to Husain about various debts and claims against him amounting to so?r*e thousands of rupees, 1 told him that if he could not find the money to pay them I would have to look out for means such as attaching his property or his family f s property. Husain replied that if this state of affairs was to continue he and all his relations would be forced to leave the Trucial Coast and settle on the Island of Kharag which belongs to them. I am of opinion that the position of the Residency Agent and his family is now so weak and that they are detested so heartily that whether they remain on the iracial ^oast or not they can do little harm by intriguing if any other person is appointed Residency Agent. The only protection which the Residency Agent and his family have at the moment is tnat they are the minions of Government. Should the agency go to otuer hands I do not think they would live more than one day. 7. At Has al &amp;haimah whilst I was admiring the scenery, I suggested that this was an obvious place for me to have a summer hill station. The Shaikh replied W I wish you would come lie re and live permanently and let us deal with you direct”. 8. In the above letter the reference to myself refers, of course, to any British Officer who might be Political ^gent. Obviously the dhaikh&amp;s remarks were not personal to me since none of them had met me before. 9. Lastly, the several little matters ^ had to settle on the Trucial Coast were successfully accomplished only because of the assistance and advice of Khan Sahib &amp;aiyid Abdul Razsak.TS - Reference your demi-official letter No*0/379 of 1st July 1935, paragraph 4. I talked the matter over with the Senior Naval Officer when he paid me a visit recently, with the result which you will sbs from the copy of the attached telegrams (No.1355 of 9th July from the Senior Naval Officer, and No. 623 of 10th July from me). 2. One gun salutes are of course quite unorthodox and are only fired in connection with Naval Courts Martial. 3. I did not press the case of the Shaikh of Hamriya. He would like to he considered an independent Shaikh, (instead of being theoretically at all events under Sharjah), but we have never recognised him as such, and we do not want to do so: there are quite enough ahaiKhs already on the Trucial Coast» He is not normally due a separate visit by a Political Officer so it is just as well you left him out.

XX XX XConfidential To Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, KUWAIT, dated 19th October 1935, No.C-330 of 1935 The Senior Haval Officer, Persian Gulf, H.M.S.Shor eham. Memorandum . With reference to your memorandum No.41/53 of 21st September 1935. I think that the following procedure might be adopted. When a Ruler proposes to be away from his Principality for a considerable period and informs me that he is appointing an individual to represent him in his absence, he should at the same time also let me know whether he wishes the representativ&lt; to receive the salute due to himself as Ruler - not of course his Personal salute if he happens to possess one. I would then pass this information on to you and the representative would duly be given the salute. 2. Should the Ruler, in the case of a short absence for instance, make no special arrangements for a representative, or appoint a representative but state that - for various reasons - he did not wisha salute to be fired then no question of giving a salute would arise, but see paragraph 5 below. 3. Please see authorities 3-6 shown under paragraph 5 (g) of Section H B ,f of Article 55 of the East Indies Station Order Book. MUSCAT. The Council of Ministers in question was formed during the time when the late Sultan Taimur bin Faisal refused to live in Muscat, and was in reality a Council of Regency to carry on the Government in his perpetual absence. When Sultan Taimur abdicated and the present Sultan came to the throne in 1932 the latter dissolved the Council. The present / ■present Sultan has a Council to the members of which he delegates various administrative duties, but they are not entitled to any salute either collectively or individually. If the suggestion in my preceding paragraph is adopted there would be no question of a Council receiving a salute. The only individual to receive one would be the individual who will represent the Sultan. If this individual is a member of the Ruling Family he will receive 13 guns, otherwise 9. The Sultan may appoint a Council to assist this individual, but that will be merely a matter of administrative convenience from the point of view of the Sultan. I suggest therefore that the authorities 3-6 referred to above be deleted from the Table. 4. Under paragraph 5 (d) and (f) of the same Article the eldest sons of the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait, if they represent their father, receive a salute of 5 guns. Under the suggestion made in paragraph 2 above should the eldest son be appointed representative, and should the Shaikh wish him to receive a salute, he will receive the salute of 7 guns and not 5. If the son does not represent his father he will of course get no salute. 5. Under paragraph 5 (d) and (f) of the same Article there is the case of the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait being absent for a short period having named no representative, or being sick, on the arrival of one of His Majesty^s Ships. In this contingency if the eldest son visits the ship it may be held that he does so as his father* s representative and he can be accorded a salute of 5 guns. 6 . If you concur in the above suggestion you will doubtless approach His Excellency the Commander in Chief, Bast Indies, and will let me know the result in due cpurse. , ?. /\ -3- 7. for your information the following are the Personal Salutes of the Rulers His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait 11 guns.

It will be observed that the only difference between your suggestions and my proposals to Commander-in- St 11 ^^ CoriCerrie sa ^ ute be given the sons of the of B f hra:ln and Kuwait - (paragraph 5 of your C.330 cx 19tn October 1935 and paragraph 4 of my No. 210/453 of 1st November 1935). It is thought, however, that the contingency you mention will be satisfactorily covered by the proposed new procedure. i v 7 1 sd. Y.S.Butler. CAPTAIN, SENIOR NAVAL OFFICER, PERSIAN GULF. C&gt; $ CHiEnclosure to S.N.O. t P.G.* a Ho.9/453 of 25th February 1936, From The Senior Uaval Officer,Persian Gulf, H.M.S.Shoreham at Bahrain* Dat e To 1st November 1935* No f 219/453. The Command er-in-Chief aa East Indies Station SALUTES TO RULERS* DEPUTIE S IN ARABIAN WATERS * With reference to my No.190/587 dated 6th September 1935, paragraphs 36 to 39, the opinion of the Honourable the political Resident has been obtained, and the following procedure is now recommended. 2* When a Ruler proposes to leave his Principality, he should inform the Honourable the Political Resident whether he is appointing a representative to act in his absence, and if so, his name and whether he desires that this individual should receive a salute. This notification would then be passed to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. 3. As a rule, the son of the Ruler is seldom appointed in his father’s absence, although provision has been made for this in East Indies Station Order Book, Article 55, Section B, for Bahrain and Kuwait. If the son was however appointed to act in this capacity, he would be entitled to a salute of 7 guns at these places in accordance with paragraph 2 above. 4. There is also the contingency at Kuwait and Bahrain, of the Shaikh being absent for a short period having named no representative, or being sick, on the arrival of one of H.M. Ships. The Honourable the Political Resident suggests that in this event, if the eldest son visits the ship, it may be held that he does so as his father’s repsesentative, and in accordance with the present Article 55, he could then be accorded a salute of 5 guns. It is thought, however, that such a provision might be confusing, and that it would be best to limit tne salute to the eldest son, to the occa-sion set out in paragraph 3 above. 5. As regards Muscat, the present Sultan dissolved the Council of Ministers or Regency Council referred to in Article 55, on his accession to the throne in 1932. He later appointed a number of councillors for various administrative duties, but the Honourable the Political Res ident does not consider that they are entitled to any salute either collect ively or individually. The only individual entitled to receive a salute is the Sultan's representative - 13 guns if a member of the Ruling Family, otherwise 9. 6 . In no case would the deputy receive the Ruler’s personal salute. For convenience, it is suggested that these should be inserted in Article 55. 7. The amendments suggested above have been included in a draft /- 2 - draft Article 55, Section B, which is forwarded her ew it hr'' for your consideration. The flag amendments proposed in No.393/E.I.2632 have not been included as Admiralty sanction has not yet been received. sd. V,8.Butler. Captain, Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. Enel. ITo.l.

I am afraid that the use of the two terms ^representative to act in his absence” and T, as his father’s representative” may cause confusion and be difficult to explain to the Shaikhs and their sons. 3. I venture to suggest that, when an individual is acting as ruler in the prolonged absence of the bhaikh, he' might be called Deputy huler (Kalb Hakim), as was done when Shaikh Hamad acted as Shaikh after the abdication of Shaikh ’Isa. During this time Shaikh Earned received the dynastic saiute of seven guns. 4. There would thus be a precedent for the style and for the salute and an eldest son should not have any difficu-Lty in under standing his two capacities of ruling for his father and paying a courtesy visit on behalf of his father. 5.

On the 17th December 1932, in j his letter No. 2656, the Political Resident recommended to the Government of India that Shaikh Hamad should receive a personal salute of 11 guns. A similar increase in the per sonal salute of Shaikh Ahmad of Kuwait was recommended at the same time. The recommendations were accepted by His Majesty^ Government. The dynastic salute of the Ruler if ■ V 1 y&lt;&gt; Letter No. 304-S dated 26th March f 37 from P.R. to S/S for India, etc. Letter No.C/ 80 dated 12th April*37 from P.R. to P.A Bahrain, etc. , vV f* ** In March 1937 the dynastic title of r *His Highness hi* In April 1937 the Deputies of the Rulers of Bahrain •f. V f' V \ r of Bahrain remains at 7 guns. 2 . was conferred on the Rulers of Bahrain and Kuwait. 3. and Kuwait ^appointed to act for them in their absence, became entitled to a salute of 7 guns. i 4. It is now for consideration whether Shaikh Salman should be granted a personal salute of 11 guns. 5. In favour of the suggestion are the following points (i) Shaikh Salman has been actively and beneficially associated with the administration of the State for at least ten years. (ii) He has been consistently loyal and friendly to 7^ British connection. (iii) In his first Proclamation as Ruler he publicly announced his determination to 'strengthen the proved ties with the British Empire and to main tain its friendship'. (iv) The following anomalies would be removed :- (a) The Ruler of Kuwait being entitled to more guns than the Ruler of Bahrain. (b) The use of the title 'His Highness' by a Ruler with a salute of only 7 guns. (c) If the Ruler temporarily leaves the State and appoints a Deputy, the Deputy will be entitled to the same salute as the Ruler himself.2 (v) Irrespective of all other considerations, the increased political importance of Bahrain justifies a personal salute of at least 11 guns for its Ruler, 6 . Against the suggestion are the following points (i) The advisability of retaining the enhanced salute as a reward for services still to be rendered• (ii) The disadvantage of establishing the custom of giving the Ruler of Bahrain a personal salute soon after his accession. 7 . Xn my opinion the advantages of granting a personal salute of 11 guns to Shaikh Salman far outweigh the disadvantages. And, if this opinion is accepted, 'bis dat qui cito dat'• 1st March 1942 P.

(i) that the dhaikh should return the calls of such officers by sending a deputy on board or (ii) that he should return the calls in person at the Agency. m Kuwait, i believe, the second of ' these courses is usually followed. 5, do far as my own case is concerned I am only obliged by the regulations to return m person the calls of Piag Officers. in other cases the correct procedure is for me to return calls through my decretary though i have agreed always to retprn the denior kavai Officer’s call in person. 4. The only deputy through whom the shaikh could suitably return a call is, m my opinion, belgrave and on »the whole i think the Commanders of ii#M, *s ships would sooner receive a return call by tne dhaikh m person at the Agency rather than a call on board by a deputy, whether a dtate official like belgrave or a member of the Al Khalifah. b.

On the 28th January H.M.S* Norfolk anchored off Sharjah at 9.00. a,m. local time (G.M.T*‘f4 hours). 3. The Political Agent, Bahrain, was aboard^having boarded H.M.S. Norfolk at Ras Tanura. 4. The Political Officer, Trucial Coast, went aboard at 9.15 a.m. in a hired launch. He was not in uniform. He called on the Commander-in-Chief and waited aboard for the Shaikh/s*calls. 5. The Shaikh of Sharjah called at 10.20. He was due to arrive at 10.00, but was twenty minutes late. His watch had been carefully synchronized the evening before and he should have been on time. His brother Shaikh Ihhammad accompanied him^and four of his guards also came aboard H.M.S. Norfolk and waited on deck. They had their rifles with them^which were loaded. They were tactfully disarmed by the Corporal of ftlarines. The Shaikh should be warned on the next occasion not to take ♦ armed guards aboard ships when calling. 5. The Shaikh was received by the Cornmander-in-Chief and presented with a framed photograph of H.K.S. Norfolk. He left at 10.35 and a salute of 5 guns was fired. 7. The Shaikh of Dubai, who had come by launch from Dubai, arrived alongside exactly on time at 10.40. a.m. He was accompanied by Shaikh Jumah bin Maktum and by his son Shaikh Rashid. He did not bring any guards aboard. He was received by the Commander-in-Chief and presented with a framed photograph of H.M.S. Norfolk. He left at 11.00 a.m. and a salute of 5 guns was fired.8 The Political Agent, the senior Uaval Officer Persian Gulf, the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, and the S.O* (I) Persian Gulf, went ashore in the Political Officer, Trucial Coast’s hired launch at 11.15 a.m. The sarae launch then took out 1 officer and 25 B.O.Rs of the R.A.P. to lunch on the Norfolk. 9. At 12.00 the European community arrived at the Agency to meet the Commander-in-Chief. They were enter tained until he came ashore in his barge at 12.15. The Commander-in-Chief landed opposite the Agency — the Political Officer, Trucial Coast’s launch having guided his barge inCthe creek. It was almost full water at the time with ajspring tide ; and the barge had no difficulty in getting into the creek. 10. The Commander-in-Chief, who was accompanied by his staff and 5 officers of H.M.S. Norfolk, was entertained upstairs until 12.35 p.ra. when the Shaikh of Sharjah^ accompanied by his brother Muhammad bin Saqr^sons Saqr and Khalid and nephew Kkalid bin Muhammad^arrived at the Agency and was seated in the lower west verandah for coffee.
