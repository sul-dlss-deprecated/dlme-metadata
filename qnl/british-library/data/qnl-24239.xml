He is inaebtea to some of Snarjan mercnants who, on hearing this, startea claiming their money. The Shaikh told me that if Mukhtar is going to leave, ne shoula first settle the claims against him and then leave. In my opinior if Mukhtar is to pay the money of Sharjan people, he woula run banktupt 8no thus woula not be able to pay tne claim of Liladar Parshotam.

If ^iladar Parshotam appoints an agent on mis behalf who comes to Sharjah, i will summon him together with the defenaant who will pay wnat may be proven against him.

This case was filed in the Court of the Political Agent, Muscat on 10th October 1931. 2. The authorised attorney for the Plaintiffs produced copies of documents alleged to be true translations of transactions entered upon between the parties in 1925. 3* Summons were issued on the defendant, who now resides in Shargah, by the then Political Agent, through the Residency Agent at Shargah. 4.. Considerable correspondence between the Political Agent Muscat and the Residency Agent Shargah does not yet appear to have attained any success, nor has the defendant been served. 5. I attach herewith the translation of a letter No. 548 dated 28th December 1931 from the Residency Agent to the address of the Political Agent from which it would appear that the late Sir Hugh Biscoe is alleged to have said that the Court of the Political Agent Muscat has no jurisdiction in Shargah. Whether this is a true statement or not I am not in a position to say. 6. The Plaintiffs however have paid fc 250/- as Court fees if and/the Court has no power to serve a summons in Shargah it seems only just that the fees be returned, or that they should be transferred if possible to the High Court at Bombay. The Plaintiffs could then be directed to prosecute their case there with a little more hope of success. 7.

A.C. Reference your letter N 0 .162 dated 28th October 1931 I beg to state that when the Hon’ble Colonel Biscoe, the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf arrived by Chakla on 1st December 1931 and you were with him, I discussed the question of Mukhtar bin Hassan Khoja resident of Shargah on whom a summons was to be served and who refused to sign it on the ground that he was a resident of Shargah and has no relations with Muscat and that the claimant should either come in person or send an agent on his behalf to settle according to mercantile rules, the Political fesit snoke to you about the matter and said that summons can only be served on people who are in Muscat and not on those who are at Shargah, but if Mukhtar has got any property at Muscat it can be foreclosed if he does not redeem it. I am therefore returning the summons according to the Political Resident’sCopy of a Memorandum No.852, dated the 23rd A-pril 1935, from the Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf, Bushire, to the Political Agent, Muscat. Beference your Memorandum No.353 dated the 21st March 1933* 2. The Political Agent, Muscat, has no .lurisdiction outside Muscat territorial limits, vide Article 2 of the Muscat Order in Council. Moreover, although legal documents are occasionally forwarded to the Besidency Agent TEucial Coast for service when possible, there does not exist on the Trucial Coast any l egal provision or machinery for the service of legal documents. 3. In the case in question, while normal service cannot he effected there does not appear to he any reason why service should not he substituted by Ord«r nf the Court (Civil Procedure Code, Order 5, Buie 20), the claim heard, and an ex parte decree passed. In the circumstances, there does not appear to he any ground for the return of the court fees paid on the plaint*CoT&gt;y of a letter No*819, dated the 12th June 1934,from the tolitieal Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Muscat,to the Honourable the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, Hushire* Subject;*- Civil suit No.44 of 1931.
