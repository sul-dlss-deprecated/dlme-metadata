As the Persian Government have not reiterated their desire to establish their authority over Bahrain, I have not thought it necessary to communicate the views of Her Majesty's Government on the subject as stated in lour Lordship's telegram No 58 ol' the 8th October. I have privately asked Her Majesty's Resident at Bushire to let me know if he hears of any attempt, direct or indirect, on the part of the 1 ersian authorities to execute their wishes in regard to the island, and should any such measures be reported, or should the Persian Government again reter to the matter, I would at once communicate Your Lordship's message, but in the meantime I trust Your Lordship will not object to my allowing the subject to drop, as I have reason to believe that it was merely a sudden caprice ot the Shah instigated from foreign quarters, and of which it would not be advisable to remind His Majesty unnecessarily.

Nicolson , Esq., Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Teheran, To—The Eakl of Iddesleigh , G.C.B., Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. The Poreign Minister begged me to call upon him yesterday with a view of communicating certain messages from the Shah. On my arrival. His Highness said that the Shah wished to effectually establish his authority over Bahrain, but belore taking any steps he desired to consult with Her Majesty s Government; that His Majesty considered the letter from the late Lord Clarendon to the Persian Minister in London in 1869 had recognized his right of sovereign tv over the island; and that tue revival of Persian authority m that quaner w*ould in nowise interfere with the supervision which was exercised by the British naval forces over the police of the gulf. His Highness gave no reason for this apparently sudden desire on the part of the Shah, and was extremely vague as to the mode by which His Majesty wished to carry out his proposal, presuming that a Governor would be sent there, or that possibly an arrangement might be made with the Sheikh of the island, whereby the latter would act as Persian Representative. The question as to what view the Sheikh might take of this proposal did not seem to have been considered at all, nor did His Highness appear to know what would occur in the event of any opposition being made to the advent of a Persian authority, beyond remarking that possibly England might feel disposed to assist in the assertion of Persian sovereignty. I told IIis Bighness that the matter had come as a surprise to me, and that bein 0 * imperfectly acquainted with the hisroiy of the question, I would express no opinion; but would communicate His Majesty's message to Your Lordship in the sense in which it had been delivered to me. I enquired whether the Shah had been deliberating on the matter for any length of time, and was informed that such w r as the case.I am unable to report to Your Lordship why the S.iah has suddenly revived the question. It may be merely a curious ooincidenoe, but some little time a'o the first dragoman of the Russian Legation questioned me as to the Tinsltiori of the island In regard to Persia and England ; and asked whether we G no? compUeTy annexe! it. I feel fairly confident that the Shah would not spontaneously have raised the question, especially as it seems to me to hau, been very imperfectly studied, though with what object he may have been prompted to do so is as yet unknown to me. I had the honor to telegraph the substance of the above to Your Lordship to-day. Enclosure to letter from Secretory, Political ami Secret Department, No. 2SS, dated the 8th October I8SI1.

The Shall has asked me to convey his wish to establish his authority effectually over Bahrain, either by sending a Governor, or possibly by insti tuting Sheikh-as representative of Persian authority. Maritime police he would wish t) continue in hands of British naval forces His Majesty considers that Foreign Office letter to lersian Minister at London of the 29ih April 1869, recognizes his sovereignty over the island. I said that 1 would communicate wish but expressed no opinion, (Confidential.) Reference to Bahrain was made to me casually by Russian iirst Dragoman some time ago, and 1 am inclined-to think that proposal is inspired from that quarter. (Sent to India.)

With reference to mv despatch No. 141 of the 1st instant, 1 have the honor to state that, at a recent interview with the Minister for Foreign Atlairs, His Highness asked me whether any reply had been received trom ller Majesty's Governmeiit in regard to the wish ol the Shah to establish his authority over Bahrain. I, therefore, communicated the substance of Your Lordship s telegiam No. 58, and also subsequently wrote a private note embodying Your L rd- ship's message so that there might be no misunderstanding. His Highness remarked that His Majesty would be much disappointed at the tenour of the replv, as he had hoped we should have taken the oppoi- tunity to give His Majesty a striking proof of our friendly sentiments. 1 said that there was no need for His Majesty to have any doubts on this point, but that it was impossible to violate treaty engagements, or to hand over territory which did not belong to us, and to which the claims or Persia were of the most shadowy character. Vhe friendly feelings ot Her Majesty's Government to the Shah had been exhibited on several occasions, and there were no reasons whatever for His Majesty to be uneasy on that score.
