Reference to previous correspondence: DESCRIPTION QF ENCLOSURE Commonwealth Relations Office endorse ment No.Ext.766/48 dated 17th March 1948. SUBJECT : Clearance of non-scheduled Flir.hts. NPG.2s CAA/4850/2 R.31252/48/ASG 1. Lear Dodd, Civial Air Attache British Embassy, Baghdad 5 April, 1948. Very many thanks for your letter of 17th March, concerning clearance of non-scheduled flights in my parish. The arrangements which you propose should be quite satisfactory. Flying Control have expressed concern that of all flights notified in this manner only about thirty per cent arrive or make radio contact. I have ascertained however that departures for Baghdad are notified by radio to our Flying Control from most fields in the Middle East since I am most anxious that there should be no forced landing in the desert without our knowing within a short time, particularly where radio is not carried. Vve hope to be able to effect an improvement in Baghdad control in the near future. In the meantime you probably have ideas with regard to the non-arrivals. I have recently written to S.P.l. concerning the use of the diplomatic wireless service in accordance with M.C.A. Office Notice No.67/47. It seems that a good deal of money could be saved by making use of this service for notification of aircraft movements, provided that the Foreign Office agree to accept the additional load, but there may be some practical difficulty in Its use Dy your Department.

Non-Scheduled flights to Kuwait. From Civil Air Attache. If we do not restrict use of Kuwait the strip will either become very costly to maintain or will again fall below the minimum safety standards. Even on completion of present repairs it is unlikely that runways will be strong enough to withstand frequeat use by heavy aircraft unless a machine-laid tarmac surface is provided the cost of which is hardly justified in view of SheiKh's (mut) to abandon present site. 2. Air Transport is however the only practic able means of bringing in perishable foodstuff and Kuwait Oil Company’s explanation (mut) presumably with Spinneys and other contractors to fly essential fresh vegetables from Syria and Lebanon. Transport supplies by any other means even by sea from Beirut might be difficult and ? unsatisfactory for many fresh foodsV V since there are no railway connexions (mut) nor is there a metalled road between Baghdad and Basra. Air craft ? courier flying perishable foods to Kuwait in a few hours at heights which avoid necessity for refriger ation. Even fresh water has to be imported to Kuwait. 3. Provided therefore that Kuwait Oil Company is prepared to maintain present runways to restrict standards we should try not to embarrass them by refusing the use of Kuwait to freight carrying aircraft without passengers in cases where we are satisfied that nature and purpose of cargo justifies flight. I propose to discuss with Oil Company the possible extent of this air lift during my forthcoming visit to Kuwait. 4. There is however no case, until a better air-field is available, for allowing any more regular passenger flights to Kuwait apart from authorised scheduled services of B.O.-«-.C and Iraqi Airways who can move daily any passengers which oil company T s own aircraft cannot take to Basra to connect with International Services. We are in fact lixely to meet severe criticism ? should there be a serious accident to a passenger carrying aircraft whilst using Kuwait ( mut ) apart from there being no navigational landing or aeradio services medical and fire fighting facilities immediately available would be totally inadequate to meet a real emergency. 5. there is considerable doubt whether (mut) aircraft operators (mut) means or necessity of obtaining permission to use Kuwait. -'ould it not be as well after discussing their need (mut) Kuwait Oil Company to issuea NOTAM laying dcrvn conditions under which Kuwait air-field may be used ?

Their permission to use Basra instead of Baghdad is temporary and T.W.A will no doubt be eager to see them leave Basra where they touch nevertheless to be more than temporarily installed.3.

Recently for various reasons they arranged to use instead aircraft of Skyways Ltd., a British owned charter company. One of the reasons was to avoid having to pay for their airlift in Lebanese currency. 3 . Spinneys here have today heard from their Beirut office that Lebanese Government have refused Sky ways permission to load in Beirut. This means that by tomorrow their stocks of fresh fruit and vegetables will be exhausted; amd they have asxed that matter may be taken up with Lebanese Government on diplomatic level.

I spoke to the Sheikh as indicated in para 4 of my letter. He said he hoped that all friendly nations would be allowed to use Kuwait ,, a $ K airfield. Izzat Jaffar, who has got the agency 1/ for Ban American Airways, put him up to this. 3. I replied that the existing airfield would not stand unrestricted use and also mentioned, in respect of Iranian airways, the consideration expressed in the first sentence of para 4 of Agency letter No. C/491 dated 6th July, 1947. 4. The Sheikh did not tell me that he had already agreed to Iranian Airways’ coming here; but apparently he had done so, 5. Their first aireraft landed here yesterday. The agent is one Mohd, Saleh Behbehani, a Kuwaiti of Persian origin, I saw him this morning. He informed me that Iranian Airways intend to operate two scheduled flights a week (Tuesdays and Fridays) with Dakotas, carrying freight and passengers from Tehran to Isfahan, ^hwaz, Abadan and Kuwait, returning by the same route. The agent stated that they would pay / E.E. Sir Pupert Hay, KCIE., CSI,, Political Besilent, Persian Gulf Be si den cy, Bahrain.2 - r would pay the usual landing fees and wished to comply with the regulations* He also said that he was trying to get charter business from the K.O.C. for the carriage of fresh food from Iran. He will wish to remit to Iran fares and freight charges collected here. The only passenger yesterday was a Kuwaiti returning from Iran. Persians cannot get visia for Kuwait. 6. In view of the state of the runway and of the importance to K.O.^. of this airfield for their airlift of fresh food, there appears to be no justification for any more regular passenger flights. 7. this is the consideration that if difficulties with Lebanon (my telegram No. 133 of the 4th June, 1949) are not resolved , the K.O.C. might be glad to charter Iranian Airways to bring food from Iran. Also, the new xtir Agreement is not yet signed; and any restrictive action against Iranian Airways, to whose agent the SheiKh has personally committed himself, would embarrass the 3hei&lt;ch and would lend colour to the arguments of those around him v/ho do not want to see delegated to us authority to say who should and who should not use Kuwait airfield. 8. It appears desirable, therefore, that the nev/ air agreement, in respect of which negotiations are now complete, should be signed with the least possible delay. We could then deal with Iranian airways. Yours ever, Sgd. G.N.

At a meeting held on June 13th between ^ representatives of the Kuwait Oil Company, Skyways Limited, the two Lebanese Airlines concerned and the Lebanese Civil Air authorities an agreement was reached between them whereby Skyways will be permitted to operate 13 flights per mensem commencing June 14th. This permission is valid only until July 14th but itis hoped in the meantime the Lebanese will provide a satisfactory reply to the note under reference. 3. Commercial Secretary is pressing authorities concerned and has used information con tained in paragraph 2 of Baghdad telegram No. 117. Jl') Secretary of State for foreign Affairs. asr.Dear Sir, I have the honour to submit for your information an account of the recent negotiations in Beyrouth between K.O.C. representatives and the Lebanese Authorities, on the question of supplies and transportation of fresh fruit and vegetables from the Lebanon to Kuwait. 1 have the honour to be Sir, Your obedient servant.% At the beginning of June the Lebanese Grovemment under pressure by Lebanese Air interests, stopped the landing of K.O.C. aircraft at Beyrouth. Acting on the telegraphic advice of ^r. Bustani of C.A.T. I went to Beyrouth on the 9th June, and contacted the Lebanese ^ Government. In Beyrouth I found that, although the Lebanese Government were sympathetic in their attitude to K.O.C., they also wished to be covered against charges of discrimination against their own air interests, and felt that some compromise might be reached after full and open discussions. The Lebanese air interests who had handled our freight from Beyrouth during the month of may, took the stand that the business should be divided equally between Bkyways and themselves and at one stage pressed that the first 9 flights be done by them, assuming there to be 18 flights in all required. A series of five meetings followed, all of which were attended by mr. oharles Tyan, director of Air Communications and Contracts in the Government, mr. Bustani and myself, and variously attended by L. deiden Biter of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Castlemaine, Commercial manager of Jkyways, M. 3aib Balam and m. Fawzi el Boss of middle mast mir mines, K. Basil Merguedich of C.G.T., and two or three other Government officials. At the first meeting I pointed out that it was fundamental to any agreement that K.O.C. must make full use of their own planes. Ihese are not Charter planes in the usual sense of the word but under the complete control of K.O.C. for K.O.C. business and personnel and operated for K.O.C. by Skyways. however, the cost to K.O.C. of employing these planes was lower than rates hitherto paid to Lebanese air interests for the same services. In order to make the fullest use of our aircraft, we wished to direct our staff to the Lebanon for leave purposes, we must, however, do all these things at the cheapest overaKLl cost and, if Cyprus or Damascus were cheaper than the Lebanon, we would have to direct our leave personnel and our vegetable and fruit purchases to those places. In the .eantime, a note had been passed to the Government from -Km. Legation, Beyrouth, vhich stated that H.r-i. Government is 'resolutely opposed' to restrictions in landings and although considerable time was spent in arguing the rights of free flight it was eventually agreed that these were matters which could only be handled at Governmental level and that the most that could be cbne would be to come to some arrangement whichwould enable us to carry on until the two Governments came to a decision as to the future. At the fifth meeting it was finally agreed that:- (1) between 14th June and 14th July, h.O.G. could operate 13 flights with passengers and vegetables in and out of Beyrouth, (2) the 14th flight, if required would be operated by a Lebanese Company, the 15th by K.O.C. and so on. ( 3 ) The agreement can be renewed at the end of the period and if the Lebanese Government do not wish to renew it they will give 7 days’ notice of such intention. ( 4 ) Friight charges by Lebanese air concerns must be competitive and if agreement cannot be reached, the Lebanese Government will authorize the continuation of the use of K.O.C. planes. It is thus of great importance that negotiations be carried on at diplomatic level without loss of time and so that an agreement be arrived at before 14th July. The whole matter has, in fact, been reported to ^r. H.H. hewall. Commercial Secretary at H.^. negation, Beyrouth, and he was due to contact the Lebanese Government on these matters on 14th June.IMA Beirut, l?th June,X949. ■ — IwA / K,il.

Man., Middle East Airlines Basil Herguedich Director, C.G.T. mile Bust^ni m.d., c.a.t. L.Caatlemaine, Skyways Ltd. plus one or two other Government officials. •The discussion was a protracted one, much of it in Hoss seemed completely to have changed hie ^ ^any s a titude during the pest few days and now insisted he had no objection whatsoever to K.O.C. (Skyways) operating xnto and out of the Lebanon to an unlimited extent. He felt that a matter for discussion at a eommeroial level, but that it was a Government decision which should be settled diplomatically. You will no doubt be awqre that most of the original opposition appeared to emenate from Kiddle Seat Air Lines. ^erguedich, on behalf of C.G.?., was, however, very difficult, f P ^ ro ? oe !? t iyan on - ^t^Fday was, as you know, that K.O.C. I ? U n r° per ? t L the B r8t ” flight, in ®T,ry month, *2i C * a ? rt J , the J '* bane8e oompnnias should ooernte si uernnte flights.

He seemed Id think that the next move should come fro© the British Legation, but he had not, of course, seen the foreign Office-inspired Hote of ICth June which you have addressed to the Minister of foreign Affaris; although I think he must have been told about it by Paterson before he left and I believe that Mr,£oaden also mentioned it at his meeting on Friday, I agree with you that the ftote is refreshingly strongly worded - 'Uis Uajeety’s Government is resolutely opposed...” It should also clear up officially some doubts which may still be in their minds regarding (a) the character of^charter flights as diatint from scheduled services, (b) the basis on which Skyways operates aircraft for the F.O.C., thus technically speaking, making these aircraft K*O.C. aircraft, (c) the identity iudsjti of Skyways Ltd,, as an English company with no Jewish capital and no Jewish director? or partners and not to be confused ith the Af eric^n tbyways international, with which company there is no connection whatsoever. And, as Mr.Boaden has explained, there is no Jewish interest in Kuwolt Oil. (d) the meaning of fifth freedom rights and the reciprocal terms ou ^hich they are normally exchanged, whether or not the States concerned are signatories of the International Convention and (e) the fact that, should such rights be witheld from us, r, -uM. Government would have seriously to re-examine the position regarding the fifth freedom rights at present enjoyed by Lebanese aircraft operating into Kuwait, Bahrein and Qatar.' I feel that, so long as Ty&amp;n can be convinced that he cannot be placed in any compromising position vis-a-vis the Lebanese companies, there will be no objection to our being granted unrestricted fifth freedom operating rights into the Lebanon. I should be interested to hear from you the results of your ’diplomatic level’ meeting with him tomorrow on this subject. P|ease do not hesitate to let me know if there is any further information you may need and may I thank you again for all the consideration you have given to our problems and the work you are doing to put them right.

My telegram No. 37 Foreign Office. Lebanese reply dated July 14th to my note of June 10th ignored principles raised and stated only that Lebanese authorities had no objection to prolongation of the unofficial arrangements referred to in para 2 of my telegram under reference until such time as a permanent agreement had been made. Under this unofficial agreement 13 flights per mensem are permitted. y •- 2. In view of statement at the end of page 2 of Persian Gulf Residency’s summary of events for June ( Bahrain reference 95/8/49 July 5th ) to the effect that His Majesty's Government's Civil Air agreement with Sheikh of Kuwait had lapsed it was considered inadvisable to press the Lebanese any further. Moreover, Skyways, Spinneys and the Kuwait Oil Company all appeared to be satisfied with above mentioned unofficial arrangements and no further action was accordingly taken here.i 3. Question of ? any pressure we can put on the Lebanese in connection with air traffic to and from Kuwait v/as however brought sharply to a head when Lebanese authorities impounded BOS*/ORTH’S aircraft on -august 24th ( see Baghdad telegram No. 148 to Beirut ) even _? thoug h norroal advance notification of its l-arxirvl had been given to _?

Bosworth hopes to return to Beirut under charter iiighk next week and he is likely to experience similar difficulties. I gather strong pressure is being exerted on local administration by Lebanese Airlines who wish to reserve traffic to and from the Persian Gulf for themselves. 5. I should be grateful for clarification of / our position at Kuwait. It would be helpful to know from whom do air lines obtain permission to operate their flights to Kuwait ( if indeed they do ) and what measures of certification could be taken at Kuwait to restrict facilities accorded to them should necessity arise.

In the first place, he would certainly raise hopes in Muscat which I trust would in fact be well founded, but which we cannot assume to be so. 2. As regards his non-schedi led flights to Kuwait, there is already correspondence going cn on the subject of flights between Kuwait and Persia undertaken by Iranian Airways. Bos- worth’s request would in the first place require to be referred to London. 3. It is, however, quite useless for Bosworth to put in applications for non-scheduled flights with traffic rights, without some indication of the purpose for which such flights are to be made. No country is going to give him complete carte-blanche. So far as my very limited experience goes, requests of this sort are usually put in the form of requesting permission for a certain number of flights over a specified period. If Bosworth will give us some more details we will take up the question with the authorities concerned. 4. I am sending copies of this letter to General Department, the Civil Air Attache, Baghdad, and to the Political Agent, Kuwait, together with copies of your letter under reference. G.

Non-scheduled flights between Kuwait Lebanon. 2 ^,^ Locsl air transport companies have been putting pressure on Lebanese Government in order that they should obtain a sharre in the Kuwait Oil Company 1 s non- scheduled traffic between Beirut-Kuwait, This traffic is at present operated for the company by Skyways Limited who have a number of aircraft on full-time charter. 2. Lebanese Director General of dommunications recently sent for Commercial Secretary and told him that K.O.C has been assigned 13 flights per mensem permitted under unofficial arrangement made with the company under which 1 he said a share of traffic in excess of 13 flights per mensem was to be given Lebanese companies. Furthermore he said matter would shortly be ta^en officially by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 3. Commercial Secretary has a furhher meeting this weex with the Director General and Commander Castlemayne of Sxyways Limited who was passing through Beirut. Castle mayne said he thought K.O.C had perhaps misunderstood nature of the unofficial arrangement and were under the impression4 impression that their flights were in order. He xaci also stated that the Lebanese companies had in fact received a share in the Graffic in recent months. No concrete evidence could be produced to support these scatements. Director General said that the best way to achieve an amicable settle ment would be for a representative of the K.O.G to come to Beirut and that he jointly arrange a meeting with the Lebanese Air Companies. Castlemayne agreed to convey this proposal to company and to arrange for a representative of Skyways to be present also if possidte. Director General emphasized that pending this meeting flights should be limited to 13 per mensem. 4. K.O.C will have to decide whether they are going to observe the 13 flights rule. If they are not Lebanese will create difficulties at this end unless company can produce a convincing answer. And if in any case difficulties arise here I feel we shall have to consider what steps we can ta^e to restrict Lebanese rights at Auwait by way of retaliation. 5. I should be grateful for guidance on this point as it would appear that though they may not have struct a very good bargain (gr. undec) A.O.C ( and therefore their carriers Sicyways ) clearly have broken agreement reached. Trouble is that probably K.O.C materially negotiated in defence to a limitation of number of flights was tactical ignorance of Civil aviation law or optimistically under this volume of traffic which has developed. Recently Skyways have been doing about 20 flights monthly thus Lebanese have got sound reason to complain ethically and perhaps in law because KOC in fact signed away their full legal rights.
