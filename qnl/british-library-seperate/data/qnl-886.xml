Letters discuss the proposed size, recruitment and composition of the force. Robert Arthur Benn, Political Agent Muscat, produced detailed budgets on the expenses involved in setting up the Muscat Levy Corps.Letters discuss how the British Government would meet the cost in the form of an additional subsidy and the remainder would be provided by the Muscat State out of the Zanzibar subsidy. Letters written in 1914 discuss how the Sultan of Muscat, Taimur bin Faisal [Taymūr bin Fayṣal], initially advertised for local people rather than accept a Levy scheme under British command; the English translation of this notice is included. Letters discuss British concern about the actions of Sultan Taimur. This was to allow the withdrawal of Indian troops garrisoning the towns of Muscat and Muttrah. The relative merits of an Arab or non-Arab military force are discussed.Includes a printed letter from Henry McMahon, Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department to Major S.G. Knox, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Muscat Regiment</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000190#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
