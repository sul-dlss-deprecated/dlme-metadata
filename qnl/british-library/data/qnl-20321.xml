May I refer to the Shaikh's oonversation with you on the 5rd October when he informed you that he had again been approached by the Eastern Bank and had replied that he agreed to their opening a branch provided that they agreed to certain conditions unspecified but one of which would be the agreement of His Britannic Majesty's Governments 2. Having now had opportunity to examine the papers filed here relating to the question of the establishment of a bank, it seems to me that the best course may still be _ that recommended by the Hon'ble the Resident in his telegram State for India, i.e. for the Huler to take advantage of a visit to London (he hopes to make one in next Spring) to arrange terms with a British bank under the auspices of His Majesty's G-overnment, that is assuming that the monopoly given to the Ottoman Bank by the Shaikh is not considered valid as euclu 26th June 1935, para 3, to His Majesty's The Hon'ble Lt.-Colonel G.Loch, C.I # S # , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, 3USHIHE. 3./- 2 - 2 # An arrangement of this kind seems to me particu larly desirable in view of the rather peculiar circumstance of Kuwait and the fact that the Eastern Bank, now the keen est competitor for the opening of a Branch, is akin to the State Bank of Iraq. On the other hand in regard to any need for great haste I see none. The Kuwait Oil Company has worked without serious or, as far as I know, any difficulty in money matters and I have discussed the matter with the local General Superintendent of the Kuwait Oil Company {now on leave), who would have, I feel sure, informed me had there been any outstanding difficulty. He returns in a few days and I shall sound him privately and inform you if he has anything different to say. The Company's Accountant in private conversation a few days ago informed me that when the Company had first come to Kuwait they enquired from the Eastern Bank if they were thinking of establishing a branch. The Bank (the Basra branch) replied that they were not interested any longer. He had heard however from the Company's General Superintendent, now in London, that the Bank had there recently approached the Company and he understood that he, Mr.Scott, the General Superintendent, thought that it was unnecessary to hasten to accept a proposal as they had now established an adequate method of their own for temporaryfor temporary purposes using local Arab bankers and a Basra bank, 4. The Accountant had heard that Major Holmes was responsible for reopening the question this time by encourag ing the Eastern Bank in London to approach the Company^ This is confirmed by the Shaikh who informs me that he has just received a letter from %jor Holmes who says that he has arranged everything with the Eastern ^ank to open a branch but that he (Holmes) is held up pending the Shaikh's authority in the matter* 5. While the approaching need for a bank cannot be gainsaid I feel that the State would do well to come to a careful arrangement under the auspices of His Britannic Majesty's Government and avoid hasty commitments* 6. After all even if Oil is found soon it may take the Company some years before production is reached and some months after Oil is found before a marked increase in activity and personnel. 7» With regard to which bank is preferable for Kuwait the Honourable the Resident has already made his observations# I would only add that perhaps (although I think it is rather unlikely in view of their nearest other branch being as far away as Karachi) that Lloyds Bank, with whom the RulerRuler has a rather large account in London, might also be interested, at least to the degree of bringing the Eastern Bank and other competitors up to scratch in the matter of conditions and safeguards which may be proposed.o Jatu POLITICAL AGENCY, D.O.N o .C-3 , /&amp;'. KUWAIT. w «The 29th October 1956. O Will you please refer to my letter No. G-S92 of the 8th' October with regard to the establishment of a bank here» 2. I have had an opportunity for discussiibn about his need if any for a bank with the General Superintendent of the Kuwait Oil Company, Mr.Scott, and he confirms that the situation is as I thought. 5* He sees no urgent need for a bank; rather on the cont-rary^at the moment he is quite content with his present system. 4. Next Spring or Summer would therefore seem quite early enough to settle the matter.

With reference to your paragraph 3 I venture to give it as ray opinion that it is not desirable to leave entirely to the Shaikh the choice of a Bank without our indicating any preference. 3. In the first place a Bank is an important concern which can wield considerable influence and it seems to me most necessary that the Kuwait Bank should if possible i be a British concern. rill*- ^ 4. In the second place His Majesty's Government (the Government of India concurring) have on various occasioni (see for example India office letter No. P.z. 7683/33 dated the 1st February 1934 to the Foreign Office) emphasised the importance of maintaining our special position at Kuwait by tightening up our control over the Shaikh. One obvious way ]of attaining this end is by M the accumulation of s/nall advantages* 1 i.e. by seizing every opportunity to increase our influence with the Ruler and generally strengthen our position in his territory. On the other hand if on occasions such as this we refuse to give the Shaikh any lead whatsoever we must not be surprised if our influence over him /him decreases and if our position at Kuwait is gradually und ermined. authorised to inform the Shaikh that while His Majesty's Government cannot dictate to him on t he subject (our Agreements with him only cover concessions re; Oil), they would definitely prefer a British Bank i.e. the Eastern rather than a foreign i # e. the Ottoman established at Bahrain.

Mr,Dent had one short interview with the Ruler and was given by the Shaikh's Secretary an outline of the Ruler's conditions which included one that the Bank Manager should be British. Mr. Dent got round this promptly by an additional sentence to allow for the British Manager resident in Basra being also in title Manager of the Kuwait branch. The Resident head of the Branch at Kuwait,Mr. Dent told me, would in fact be one BASKUR1, a Christian of Basra,and a friend of the Shaikh's Secretary, until profits Justified the salary of a European. The Ruler informed me of this the next day and did not seem to see anything objectionable. Mr.Dent is now communicating the outline of conditions to his Directorate in London so that, as he hopes, final written agreement may be reached. 3. The period in which profits might be held not to justify a British Bank Manager might be extended indefinitely and this would, subject to your opinion, seem to me to be a point which might be dealt with in an unequivocal manner in the Shaikh's conditions by making_it a condition that the Resident Manager from the opening (Signature) of the/ mfp—367 s&amp;p—(m-508)—15-7.35—10,000. {Designation)- 2 - 1*7 of the Bank and always should W a British subject.(Para 2 of India Office telegram 312^of the 11th November 1936 refers).

I can certainly assure you that if the Sheikh should come to some arrangement with the Ottoman Bank the Secretary of State would raise no objection to the opening of a Branch. I do not think that Lord Zetland would wish to attach any conditions, except possibly in regard to the nationality of the staff to be employed. This detail, however, is perhaps a matter which the Sheikh himself would wish to raise in the course of the local negotiations. I assume that the Bank v/ill, if they are interested, pursue the matter locally with the Sheikh. It will not be necessary for them to approach the India Office officially unless and until the negotiations reach a definitive stage. Ht. Hon.

The Shaikh refused to see him on business. He said that for the time being at least he had committed himself to the Ottoman which had been first all along'. If they refused his conditions as finally approved by His Majesty^ Government he would deal with other Banks. Hendry decided to ask for a private friendly interview and at this he took the line, rt I am sorry we can't talk business - had we been able to I had intended to ask if Your Excellency approved my suggesting to my own Directors some points in addition to your/conditions, which latter I have no doubt they would have accepted with no or very little alterations' He hinted at good things the Shaikh might be missing* The Shaikh according to Hendry opened his eyes at this and said on his leaving 'You'll hear from me soon' 1 .

To the same percentage the -Eastern is, I gather, unlikely to agree. 3. Hendry had considered the same pod^nt which was afterwards made in India Office telegram No. 2674 of the 17th December but thought it best to take the line he did. He told me on the 13th he had written everything to-his Directors and expected to visit Kuwait again and return to the charge on receiving a reply. 4.

He has promised to do what is wanted, which is to talk to the Shaikh about sound stocks and shares to lead up to the deduction in the Shaikh's mind that 2 and more can be had in other places than the Ottoman Bank with, if anything, less risk a role which suits Holmes well.

Only questions for His Majesty's Government to answer are therefore (a) are Shaikhs conditions suitable ? (b) is Ottoman Bank (which Shaikh apparently m proposes to admit as being first in the field) a bank of which His Majesty's Government approves ? /r Answer to (a) is in my telegram of January 8th. ' As regards (b) His Majesty 1 s Government have no reason for disapprovin g Ottoman Bank (which incident ally is not entirely foreign but is Anglo-French concern) .

I do not think that there was any real misunderstanding between us, and we entirely appreciated - and shared - your desire that the Eastern Bank should have a fair run for its money. On the other hand, since the Sheikh was of opinion that the Ottoman Bank had the first claim upon him, and he refused to consider an offer from the Eastern (who did not appear very active on their own behalf), it seemed to us that it was difficult, and probably would have been fruitless, to press him even to the extent you suggested. I need hardly say that we quite agree that it is up to you in all cases to put forward your views to us; indeed it would often be a grave handicap to us if you did not do so. In this case we only regret that we felt we had to be 'sticky' at this end! s Hon^ole Lt.Col.T.C.W.Fowle, C.B.E, ) C .1O/T/ coagic-a.'^ul. political agsvcy, k — «o .c-AfV. .l.e 20th May 19 37.

On the 14th May Lir .ocott, Fields Manager of the Kuwait Oil Company informed me, during the course of a general discussion on oil matters, that he had experienced some difficulty in obtaining in Kuwait a sufficient number of rupees to pay the monthly salary bill of the Conpany's * employees for the month of ^pril, Mr-Gcott went on to say that as a result of his enquiries he h ad learned tiir it during the past year approximately 750,000 rupees had been exported from -await with the result that there was now a serious shortage of rupees in the Town. 3, After my discussion with I-Ir.^cott, I mentioned the matter at an interview m th His Highness the Shaikh Of Kuwait. His Highness assured me that there y /as no question of a shortage of rupees in Kuwait but that the Company^ difficulties had. arisen solely out of the natural seasonal requirements of Indian exchange to roeet shipments of goods arriving from India at this time of the year. His Hi,^iness 1 s assurances were confirmed by enquiries i made from two of the leading merchants in Kuwait. 4. Though the result of my enquiries has been reassuri ng/reassuring a review of the figures quoted in the annual Trade Report for the years 19^4, 1935, and 19 36 shows that during the je st few years specie to the value of approxi mately million rupees has. been expo rted from Kuwait as -opposed to imports amountin g to sone Hs»15,000 only &gt; Presumably when the negotiations for the opening of a Bank in Kuwait are completed the export of specie will cease. In the meantime, however, it is possible that should the present high rate of export of specie continue the shortage complained of by the' Manager of the Kuwait Oil Company may become embarrassing.

At this time the -^inar/Hupee rate in Basrah was 3s.15/3/5• (3) On making: en qui -ies of Abdulla Liu 11a ^aleh v/e were informed that the causes of this unfavourable rate were;- (a) Heavy pUnhaces by Iraq merchants of lamb skins for which payment was made in Dinars. (b) Seasonal requirements of Inc.ian exchange to meet cost of rice and other Indian shipments arriving at this time of the year. ; o) liequirement s of rupees for financing the near ling fleet. (4) In view of the alleged local market conditions we obtained frcm our bankers in Basrah, ^s.20,000 worth of _ rupee drafts at the Basrah rate of exchange and these, f AbcLul V Kerim ^.bul undertook to cash locally at l|p commission. In this T 7ay a rate of exchange slightly b'etter than the local offer was obtained. U j ) Aft^r obtainiiig Rs.16,000 in coin we were informed by Abdul Kerim Abul f s son that owing to eivport of rupees there were only 30,000 rupees available in the Town and there were no sellers. (Subsequently we have been able to cash our remaining drafts at no commissi on through Messrs;Gray Hack enzie Ltd.)(u) On receipt of this information yjq instituted enquiries which resulted in the allegation that about 750,000 rupees in silver had been exported during the y ear. (7) Other enquiries also elicited the fact that one of the biggest employers of labour ar.ongst the local merchants v /as also having difficulty in obtaining rupee coin. (8) In view of the difficulty of the position and the possibility that it v/as being engineered by a small ring of local merchants, the matter was brought to your notice. From subsequent conversations v /e understood that resulting from your enquiries into the matter the following points have been made by the Huler or his representative (Abdulla llalla oaieh) (1) That there is no actual shortage of rupee coiiftn the Tom.. (2) That the present position is a seasonal one due to slackness of business at this time of the year. Local merchants-at this season not requiring to purchase either dinars in Iraq or Rupees in India due to this cause. (3) The position will in all probability rectify itself in the early autumn when the date crop comes on to 'the market. * In view of the peculiar local caiditions we are advising our London Office of the situation and recommending that steps be taken to make us independent of the local exchange market in case of necessity.Gonfident ial.

June the 2lst t 1937• I nK / Blr Tron chard was interested Stewart's letter C-144 about the shortage of rupee ooin In Kuwait, which he discussed with me* It seems a rather (jueer business, and difficult to ^udge of from a distance. Such an (apparently) excep tional tightness of money could hardly be accounted for purely by seasonal fluctuation in the demand for rupee coin. )n the other hand a carefully engineered ramp on the part of the local merchants also seems improbable. It occurs to me that the habit of hoarding, to which you have drawn attention ( in part 8 para: 18 of your frade Report for 19^6-36 ) as being a parti cularly prevalent habit among Kuwaiti merchants, might have something to do with such a situation as this. Any scare of a shortage of specie would naturally react Captain O.S. De Gaury, M.C., The Political ^gent, Kuwait.a very quickly in a society where wealth is reokoned by bags of silver rather than bank balances* Once the shortage of coin in circulation had become a fact, one or two of the merchants may well have gone on to I take advantage of it, an it seerss Abul Kerim attempted to do at the expense of the Kuwait Oil Company. But there seems no doubt that a steady outflow of specie has taken place during the last few years, and it is a matter for speculation where it has all gone.

The Shaikh received a reply from the Ottoman Bank querying the conditions he offered them. He therefore felt himself free to send for the Basra Manager of the Bastern Bank, Mr .W.Hendry, and offer the Eastern Bank the opportunity of accepting the conditions. 3. Mr.Hendry thinks that his Directors will accept the conditions and believes that there would be sufficient volume of business here to warrant opening a Bank whether oil is found in commercial quantities or not. 4. I understand that the condition which brought an end to negotiations with the Ottoman Bank is that whereby a British or British Protected Head of the Bank in Kuwait is required. The Ottoman Bank also, I understand were disinclined to accept Article 6, which allows for a loan by the Bank to the Kuwait G-overnment. 5. Mr.Hendry, however, says that he can explain this to his Directors in such a way that they will not, he thinks, object to it.

Would you kindly refer to Bushire Memorandum , dated 10th August, Ho»602-S of 1937, about the estahlishraent of a bank at Koweit? ^ We have never quite understood the purpose of Nos»7 and 8 of the conditions laid down by the Sheikh, particularly the stipulations that the Manager f s Attorney must be a British protected person and that the clerical staff, if not Kov/eitis, should be nationals under British protection. The conditions as worded have the effect of excluding British subjects from any of the posts other than Manager, We should be glad to know precisely what manner of persons are intended to be covered by these clauses and why British subjects should be ^ excluded, if this is intended. Is the point that the Bank would not in any event consider sending a British/ iroe, Esq., C.I.E., I. Consulate-General, Bushire.2. British subject (European or Indian) to fill any post other than that of Manager, so that for this reason there is no necessity to say 'British subject or British Protected Person' in regard to the subordinate posts (which would 'be filled either by Koweitis or by other Gulf nationals - but not, under the Sheikhas conditions, by Iraqis)?

The Shaikhs original condition 7, in the early negotiations with the Ottoman Bank, stipulated for a European British Manager, and the present form was a compromise prompted by the Bank's feeling that the profitst in the initial years at any rate, would not justify the appointment of a European Manager• The Bank as a matter of fact contemplated employing an Iraqi, and the object of the Shaikh's condition in its present form was to ensure that the attorney should be a person, 'Other than those mentioned as exceptions in paragraph 2 above, falling under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent, e»g. an Indian (British subject or British protected person), but not e.g, an Iraqi.

They have always regretted lost opportunity of Bahrain. Shaikh considers |vide paragraph 5 of de Gaury's letter Ho#C/223 of 10th October 1937) that he is free to look elsewhere but before I can approach Imperial Bank they will wish to be certain that they have a clear field# 3. If you agree would you please ask Eastern Bank to say definitely whether they are opening this Spring and if in reply i^negative authorise me to approach Imperial Bank. - BRIT CONSUL - ^ \lo~^ c ^ .

Disclaiming all responsi- 'bility and saying that he was thinking only of British interest in the maintenance of the 'blockade, he put forward the idea of limiting imports to Kuwait. He suggested that goods were imported there and consigned to Saudi Arabia; 'but that their real destination was Syria. Control, he suggested, would 'be simple; most of the large import operations in Kuwait are financed 'by Basrawis, working through Iraqi 'banks. The scheme is ingenious, and the excuse specious. The idea of controlling Kuwait imports 'by financial regulations in Iraq, is certainly novel. Suspicion is attached to it, however, 'by the fact that the very person who put forward the suggestion, Abdul /fahhah al Na'amah, is one of the most prominent Iraqi supporters 6f the contention that Kuwait is part of Iraq.. It is possible that on the pretext of aiding the British 'blockade of Syria the Iraq Government will take the first step towards integrating financial control of the two countries. The presence of a branch of a British Bank in Kuwait would negative this scheme almost completely.Telegram Q,. From Britconsul, iiushire.

Matter has been fully discussed with Chairman of the Eastern .bank, .Bank have not yet had fresh report from Basra Manager but on information before them their views, given in strict confidence, are as follows. They are prepared as soon as war is over and assuming that our relations with Shaikh continue on present line to investigate the matter afresh with every intention of opening ? company branch at Kuwait if it is at all possible even with little or no prospect of early profit. But they are unable to make an earlier move. Their fundamental difficulty which becomes increasingly serious is shortage of staff. But apart from that they cannot in the present circumstances see any compelling reason or inducement to open a branch in Kuwait. 3. This being their attitude .bank recognise/reaogniee that field cannot be reserved for them and that they cannot object if other .British interests are brought in. if therefore you are of opinion that matter cannot safely be left till after the War you may now sound Imperial Bank of Iran.

Though helpful unofficially it is policy of imperial joank of Iran to keep out of local politics and it would be necessary for any question of assistance from their branches to be taken up with head office in Tehran who would refer to legation until iraq returns to normal. it would be difficult for responsible official from Persia to visit Kuwait as he might be held up.

If however they can be assured % that (provided their conduct of business is satisfactory) opening of any other British or foreign bank during first five years of their establishment would be discouraged by Shaikh and Government of India, they would propose instead to send to Kuwait suitable British member of their staff abroad with managerial experience and some knowledge of Arabic who would be supplied in due course with necessary nucleus of trained clerical staff. 4. Bank enquires whether action on these lines would be acceptable. If so they would instruct their Chief Manager at Tehran to communicate by telegram through Minister with you regarding arrangements.~2~ 5. 1 should be glad to have your views on this proposal. After discussion Y/Hth Bank I feel they are anxious not to commit themselves to anything so rigid as draft agree ment land in particular to loan contemplated in clause 6); and in the hope of avoiding this they are not aeking for concession on the lines of clause 18* i think it would 'be &amp;. reasonable to give them assurance for v/hich they ask in return for which they would probably accept most of remaining stipulations in draft agreement. -Secretary of State for India. nl ill L.

Matheson, who*was appointed to open the new 'branch, arrived in Kuwait in the middle of January 1942 and immediately proceeded to negotiate for suitable premises. No suitable building being available in the business quarter of the Town the lease of six small store rooms was acquired with the assistance of txhe Shaikh's Secretary and their inne^ r walls were removed to form a banking chamber, strong room, entrance hall, and office for the Manager. The construction of bank furniture was undertaken by a local carpenter and his work was supplemented by purchases in Basra of special equip ment. The Bank Manager and his wife were my guests until a suitable building could be made available for their i temporary accommodation by the Kuwait Oil Company pending the completion of alterations in a house belonging to Shaikh Abdullah al Jabir which had been leased as their permanent dwelling. 3. On the 2Sth of February 1942 the Bank opened for busine£ and from the first there was a steady desire on the part of the' S 11 more substantial merchants to deposit money and open accounts. On the 20th of March 1942 there were fifty one accounts ' on the books of the Bank, six months later the number had increased to ninety five and is now, so the Manager informs me, about one hundred and fifty. The largest depositor was at one time the Saudi Arabian Trade Agent who deposited Huoees. thirteen lakhs of his Governments money in the Bank. 4. As much assistance as possible has been given to the Bank by this Agency. In the early part of 1942 the Bank under took, at the suggestion of the Agency, the withdrawal of King Edward VII rupees to give the populace an opportunity of increased contact with the Bank and to familiarise thethe ignorant of which there are tens of thousands in Kuwait with the of a 'banking premises. As a result of pressure from the \gency the Jfinancial Department of the Kuwait Government opened a deposit account in April 1942, In May 1942 the Bank, and the Army authorities who were at that time making large purchases in the town ^found themselves embarrassed 'by the demand for payments to 'be in silver coin as rupee notes of all denominations were at a considerable dis count, fts the Bank Manager pointed out that rupee coin was tire- CUtcL some to handle, difficult to transport ^expensive to obtain from India^ ^ I discussed the question with the Shaikh and in May the Kuwait Government decreed that from then on notes would 'be interchangeable with coin without charge. Cooperation between the Kuwait Government, the Bank, and some of the more far-sighted merchants ensured that the Kuwait Government's decree was implemented and in a very short time notes were readily accepted. In fact notes and cheques are now preferred to coin for all large payments. 5. The Bank is now established and many wonder how the business community managed without the facilities offered by a feank for so many years. Bills can be negotiated on the spot instead of over one hundred miles away in Basra, drafts on India can be purchased immediately on telegraphic advice from merchant, agents in India, over-drafts on good security can be obtained at reasonable rates of interests, and time and accounting can be saved by making use of the banks cheques for local business and personal payments. It is difficult to aay how the small branch or the Im perial Bank of Iran benefits, Kir/mit^ and of course itself^ but I- gnppngo in mnr&gt;h t.hp wnv th?vt Llovds Rnrl nthpr WP1 1 -k-iq-A™ houses benefit the City of London.

There are two reasons for this# The first is that the present Ruler suffers from heart trouble and may well feel that a sub stantial present now is better than a potentially larger sum which he may not live to reap» The seconds is that the Kuwait Oil Company will very shortly begin payments to His Highness on so vast a scale that anything the Bank can offer will carry very little weight. In other words| any amount they pay now will represent far more to the Ruler than a similar sum paid in a years time. The payment will however have to be a very sub stantial one as money has lost much of its value in Kuwait in the last five years, and it would be advisable to precede the negotiations by a present of considerable value. As a reason for applying for an extension you might perhaps mention that some capital expenditure has to be incurred on strongrooms etc. If the renewal of the Concession is delayed much longer you may meet with competition from some unsound Arab bank, whom the Shaikh for reasons of policy would not wish to discourage.

When I first advised the Shaikh to give a concession to a reliable bank I told him that they could not expect to make much money at first, which in 1940 appeared to be the case. Last year, when I mentioned that the Bank had justified itself, he looked somewhat quizzically at me, and I am sure his feeling is that while the Bank has undoubtedly prospered beyond all expectations he himself has not made a cent out of it, which does not appeal to him. The Kuwait Sulphur Company had to pay Ss 76,000 down and Ss 40,000 a year simply to prospect, in addition to such ,, sweeteners H as an enormous gilt-edged Chrysler Car, (and all for nothing as they seem to have abandoned the concession). So you will see that His Highness is accustomed to generous treatment* The Kte Hon* The Lord Kennet of the Dene, P *C », G «B.E e ,D «S .0e ,D*S.6»| 76 King William Street, ohJi/?/ Your helpful letters of 2nd December were very welcome. We h&amp;ra indeed prospered unexpectedly in JCuwait* and should lie happy to give tangible acknowledfisent of this to His Highness, Our profits since we opened in February 1942 haTe &gt; as it happens^ accrued wholly to the Sritish revenue. Under our taxation system the lank is no whit the richer. On the other hand it ie a matter of doubt whether a payment iy us to His Highness would 'be allow ed liy the Inland Herenue as a permissilile charge on the Bank's profits for tax purposes. Ths prosperity we have experienced since February 1942 must 1e Icr^ely ascrilsd to wartime conditions. We cannot expect it to Tie maintained to anything like the same extent. We cannot t aoraover, compete with industrial or mining con cessionaires in the matter of triVute. We pay no royalties and make nc gifts of any sort in Iran or Iraq, and we could not in principle 'be looked to as a contriViitory in that sense. It w&amp;» understood that when His Highness risited London he irould Tie aeasoied for a jair of guns. As this suggestion is no longer appropriate we propose to offer him Hps. 50,000 in acknowledgment of his kindness and support. If this is agree*ile to His Eighness our manager at Kuwait may with your approval ask the instructions of H«H. as to disposal of the amount, and charge or instruct our London Office accordingly.

Dated the 18th January 1946. IMPORTANT . Imperial Bank of Iran wish to negotiate for fifteen year extension of concession at early date as they are contemplating capital expenditure on new premises etc.,and ask for advice regarding tactics. 2. Their proposal is to pay Rs.60,000/- as gratification to Shaikh and later to apply for extension which they then apparently hope to obtain free of charge. It seems to me that best approach f would be to present Shaikh with substantial gift e.g. motor car in advance of negotiations and then send representative to obtain best terms he can either by way of lump sum down or annual payments. Please telegraph your views. - PRIOR - HDN.in D*0&gt;Ko,iQ8»3 ^ B USli IRig f the 2l8t January 1946. Than ^ you ^ or y our better of January 2nd, 1946. I am sorry to hear that the Bank have them selves made no profit from their Kuwait branch and the position must indeed be galling, I quite agree that the present profits are exceptional and that you cannot expect them to be maintained in peace time. appreciate that a ban^c cannot compete with mining or industrial concessionaires in the matter of tribute, and I only mentioned the Kuwai t Sulphur Company as a recent instance whose figures were icnown to me. vvhile it may be correct to say that the Bank pay no royalties and make no gifts in Iran and Iraq i do not feel that this gives the full picture. In Iraq, I believe, all business concerns pay a corporation and also an exceso profits tax, and the personnel pay income tax, while in Persia the Bank pay the income tax on their superior staffs incomes, and in three years time will almost certainly be exposed to the general corporation tax on all their earnings. Against all this it muot be admitted that the Kuwait taxation or royalty is nil, 3. I raised the point, however, not from any desire to add to His Highness* income, which is of course no concern of mine and will shortly exceed all his real needs, but because I felt that some gratific ation would ease the path for any further requests / you The Bt. Hon. The lord Kennet of the Bene, P.C.,G.B.iS.,D.3.0. f I).3.C. t 11, Telegraph Street, Moorgate, LondonI&lt;H • 2 &lt;• you might have to make from him. It is the invariable approach on this coast and we ourselves frequently make presents to these rulers, though not usually of any great value, and is the accepted method (to use the Arab phrase; of ^keeping them sweet'i ^ not 8 that you consider presenting him with Ks 50,000 apparently as a preliminary to negotiating for a 15 year extension of your concession. Kow the consideration for this extension can take the form of either (a) a lump sum payment for the concession, or ib) an annual rental, or (c) a percentage of profits or possibly some combination of these three. (c) would be undesirable from your point of view as there might be disputes over the calcuiation of profits and it would be objectionable from the general point of view as it would create a precedent and open the way to indiscriminate taxation on this Coast which would react unfavourably upon other firms. (b) would be difficult to assess and might become a burden on the branch, and has some of the disadvantages of (c)« I therefore recomaiend (a) with the possible addition mentioned below. 5. I do not recommend a cash payment as a preliminary to the negotiations. Shaikh Ahmad is a close man and would not be moved in the future by a donation in the past. A valuable present, e*g* a motor oar, is, however, a different matter and an almost indispensable preliminary to any negotiations# I therefore suggest that you either preoent him with a motor car, or announce that you intend to do so, and then send a negotiator to obtain the extension on the best terms he can get by a single payment . This will have to be 8ub3tantial and i doubt if you will obtain your requirements for the figure mentioned. It will greatly facilitate your negotiators task if / he3 he can show the Shaikh*s most influential secretary^ Mullah Saleht that there is some benefit for him in the extension, and this might appropriately take the form of a monthly salary for the duration of the concession for some nebulous liaison duty. It is a foible of Shaikh Ah ma d 1 a that he likes to have others pay his staff for him, and the oil company recognised this by agreeing to pay Mullah Saleh a substantial salary as the Ruler's official l-ocal Representative with the company. 6. Unless very early action is taken the extension will cost the Bank very much more, since the oil payments commence on a grand scale in April and money will then lose much of its value. 7. I very strongly recommend that the negotiator should be either Mr. Matheson or Mr. Johnson. The former is persona grata with the Shaikh and has obtained a greater success in Kuwait than is perhaps realised, and the latter is the man who negotiated the original concession and so, in Arab eyes, is an appropriate person to reopen the matter. I equally strongly recommend that the new manager should not be expected to negotiate the extension for it will be some time before he can acquire any influence. The question of where the money should be credited could be settled in consultation with the Ruler* 8« Finally, I am glad to be able to assure your Board that the services of the Bank are greatly appreciated at Kuwait* ihen I invested ^r. Matheson with his M.B.JS., His Highness expressed himself most warmly both regarding his services and the facilities provided by the Bank during a very trying time, and these views are widely held amongst the merchant community of this increasingly important principality.63/91 Telegram Q From Political Agent, Kuwait To Political Resident Bushire* No 38. Dated and received 24th January 1946 S 11 2 Your telegram No. 90 January 18th. Imperial Bank of Iran at Kuwait» As far as is known here bank intend to ask Shaikh to construct new premises which they will rent from him. If this is correct bank would not have too much capital expenditure but Shaikh would probably demand excessive rent. If bank agree to Shaikh 1 s terms ©nd further volunteer to carry out minor repairs (which would be in their own interests) I think they could unobstrusively include extension of their concession as a con dition. I believe Shaikh has recently decided oh site for new bank premises. 3 # At the same time I agree that a pres ent from bank to Shaikh would be opportune in view of the fact that their branch here has been success ful and that Shaikh has received no loan (om . ?or) other ?concession from them. A car would be a suitable present but not an ?American Saloon of which he already has a superfluity. I would suggest either a Bentley tourer or a vehicle of the Jeep type suitable for desert work. and suitable cars for presentation are presumably not yet available a delay of a year or so would appear to be advisable. 4.
