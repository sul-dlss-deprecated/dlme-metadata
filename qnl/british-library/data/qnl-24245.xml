Now that at least two of the Shaikhs, Dubai and Sharjah, are racing in some shekels from the Petroleum Con cessions, Limited, for their oil concessions, some of which may find its way into hands lower down, Sir Trenchard thinks that we should make some effort to recover the debts owed by the nationals of these Shaikhs to our subjects. as a preliminary to this he suggests that the Residency Agent might be asked to make out a list of such debts. Dubai at all events seems to be fairly prosperous these days. H.

Owing to the various other objects that we want on the Truoial Coast, in the way of oil concessions, air facilities, etcetera, it is not very often that we are in a position to exercise this pressure, and such pressure as we can apply must, Z think, be kept for the benefit of our own eubjeote and not for Iranian or other foreigners. A further difficulty is that the sluwqp in the pearl trade has hit the Truoial Coast very nard and in most oases the debtors, for the time being, at all events, have no money with whioh to pay. 3. Till* being .o, 1 «■ afraid that I do not aaa any ■ay to bringing any preaaura to bear on the Shaikh of Sharjah H. M* Butler, JSsq,, His Majesty’s Legation, Tehran*ML- ®, £ Cop,y of letter No. o48/&lt;,/38, dated the £nd July, 1^36, from Mr. N.M.Bulter, Hie Majesty’s Legation,Tehran, to the Hon’ole the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Zanjani of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently told our Acting Oriental Secretary of an appeal for help which the Iranian Government had received from an Iranian subject, one Rahmatullah Ansari, resident in Sharjah. This man, he said, was owed money, due on commercial transactions, from the following subjects of the Sheikh of Sharjah. Ahmad ibn Darvish &lt;;5,000 Rials. Abdullah ibn Ahmad Mana'i 12,485 Muhammad ibn Ahmad Mana'i 7,400 it Khalid ibn Ibrahim 1,000 n Ali ibn Saif 1,000 k Total Rials 46,88b 2. He ha d appealed to the Shaikn of Sharjah and to the •'British Consul” at Sharjah to force his debtors to pay, but without result: he has therefore appealed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for help. Zanjani asked if the Legation would lend its good offices. 3. Tne case is similar to that of Ahmad Haji Muhammad Buohiri which formed tne subject of correspondence ending with Loch's letter of the 3Gtn September, 1935, (D.O. No.96/2012 (85/6) ). I see from our records that Knatchbull-Hugessen, when staying with you on nis way to India in the autumn of 1935, discussed with you the attitude that siiould be adopted towards such cases. His view, with whicn he records that you agreed, was that our action should be strictly reciprocal in such matters, i.e., that we should always oe ready to ma^e enquiries as to the facts in any case, but should not agree to transmit representations from tne Iranian Government to the Sheikh's or to ^ut pressure on the la tter.O', -ki- 4. Would it in tne light of tne above be possiole for enquiries to be made in Sharjah about the prebent cabe? If they are productive I will then let the Iranian have tne benefit of any information which you think they may properly be given. p,S. Tne attitude referred to in paragraph 5 abavt, of which 1 was unaware or else had forgotten when I tele graphed to you on the 11th and 20th June about the Perbxaho expelled from Bahrain, has no doubt a bearing on that ques tion, too; but I do not feel sure that Hugessen then or Seymour now would have thought that it should be applied to the Bahrein trouble, which might in certain circumstances take on quite large proportions, without further considei- aticn.No.590/10/1 British Agency, Sharjah. 15th September 1938 To The Political Agent, Bali rain.

My house in Sharjah was open broken on the 6th October, 1948 (19 Zilkad,13650 and real pearls costing Rs. 5&gt;000/-/-, Ornaments costing Rs. 1,000/-/-, and house furniture were stollen from my house. On the same day I went to report to the British Residency at Sharjah, giving them full details of all my staff which were robbed from my house* At the same time I was given a letter by the British Residency to take it to the Sheikh of Sharjah, who at once after reading the British Residency^ letter gave me one of his servant to find the thief’s impression, but sorry to state you that the Sheikh servant was not se uccessful to find out the same. After 10 days I was informed by one of the Dubai merchant named Ali Bin Fardan that he had caught some of my pearls at Dubai, which he had seen before with me. At once I left Sharjah and approached to the Sheikh of Dubai, who gave me the same pearls which Ali Bin Fardan had caught. Again after 10 days also apart of the same pearls costing about Rs. 150/-/- were caught at Sharjah from a Broker. On asking the broker how he managed to get these pearls and from whom he was given to sell, and in return he said that he was given by an Arab called Dafoos Bin Miree, and also stating that Dafoos had promissed him to give him some more for sell. Dafoos Bin Miree is not a pearl merchant. At the same time I went again to the British Residency to report against Dafoos, and at the same time I was given a letter to the Sheikh of Dubai, but the same had run away to Kowait. The said man Dafoos returned to Dubai since five months ago, so again I was given a letter by the Political Residency on the Sheikh of Dubai who after 25-days asked me to attend to Ali Bin Abdullah, one of the pearls merchant’s shop. So I and Dafoos went to Ali Bin Abdullah. Dafoos when was asked by Ali Bin Abdullah, he said that the same pearls were mortgaged with me. On this Ali Bin Abdullah asked him to give him the name of the person whom he had these pearls. He denied to give the name of the original person to Ali Bin Abdullah. When he denied to give the name of the person by whom he had got these pearls, at once I went to the Political Residency and informed the matter over there, and I was told by the Residency to wait until their further instructions. Now it is about two months over after the second promise of the Political Residency and upto now I had decided no reply from them in this connection. For your information I have to inform you Sir that I am running after this case since 17-months ago, and whatever I had balance money with me I have finished, and remained with empty pockets. As I am very poor man and am of a large family with no satisfactory means to support the same. Ncm^I have availed myself to yours only for this case and hope you will grant me a letter to your Agency at Sharjah so that they may deal with this case. As I did not get a help from Sharjah and there fore it was decided to me to reach here. Your kind acts and comments in this matter will be very much appreciated, and I shall ever Pray Your Long Life and Priority.

The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Foreign Affairs present their compliments to the British Embassy at Jedda and inform them that Nakhuda, Hassan Ibrahim, who can be contacted through Wali Oman Obeid bin Thani, submitted an application to the Saudi Arabian Government in which he stated that while he was piloting the Saudi Arabian launch from Muscat to Aden two years ago he was compelled to take refuge at Mukalla; he stayed in Mukalla for about a year and a half and paid the expenses of the crew of ten during that period. After an exchange of correspondence with the competent Saudi department about the delay at Mukalla, he asked to be paid the expenses he had incurred during the period in question. The competent Saudi Arabian department appointed Salraeen Omar Ba-Sinaid at Aden to examine his case and to settle his claim, after taking into consideration the amount he owed the competent Saudi department. The court which ex-amined the case enquired from the port from which the launch left about the validity of the Nakhuda*s claim that the launch left in ballast from that port. The 'Frawal of the town 11 of the port of departure replied that the launch had left carrying about nine tons of timber. It also transpired that the manifest in the Nakhuda*s possession was false and that he had disposed of that cargo. The committee set up by the Mukalla Government decided in the presence of Salmeen Ba-Sinaid, the Agent of the competent Saudi department and of the plaintiff Hussein Ibrahim, the Nakhuda, to settle the account the Nakhuda had claimed which amounted to 10,202 rupees and 6 annas. This decision was officially confirmed by the Secretary of the Government of Mukalla and Salmeen Ba-Sinaid paid this sum of money to the Nakhuda and took delivery of the launch which he sent to Jedda. The Nakhuda agreed that as soon as the amount assessed by the Committee set up by the Mukalla Government had been received, the claim for expenses for the launch and the timber could be considered settled. He duly received the amount, but he was not satisfied with this settle ment. He submitted the application referred to above to the Saudi Arabian Government claiming the remainder of the expenses. His application was passed to the competent Saudi department for consideration; that department examined the steps taken by the Committee set up for this purpose at Mukalla. They found that the Nakhuda had no right to claim anything after the assessment of the amount due to him made by the Committee at Mukalla and the payment of the amount assessed by the Committee. The Ministry therefore request the respected Embassy to intervene with the Government of Oman with a view to informing Hussein Ibrahim of this result. His address is 'Wali Oman Obeid bin Thani'.

The file continues with correspondence relating to the commencement of debt recovery proceedings in 1939 by merchant Abdul Kader Mohamed Abbas of Bombay, against several subjects of Dubai and Sharjah in 1939, and also a complaint from pearl merchant Khoja Ali Bin Abdullah about a burglary and theft committed at his house in Sharjah in 1947. The file ends with a letter from the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mecca to the British Embassy, Jeddah in 1949, communicating the decision of the authorities in Mukalla, Aden Protectorate [Al Mukalla, Yemen] to dismiss the compensation claim made to the Saudi Arabian Government by nakhuda (captain) Hassan bin Ibrahim, a British subject of Kuwait, for losses incurred while piloting a Saudi Arabian cargo vessel between Muscat and Aden in 1947.The Arabic content of the file consists of copies in Arabic as well as English, of two lists compiled by the Residency Agent, Sharjah in 1938, showing all outstanding claims by British Indian merchants against subjects of the Rulers of Dubai and Sharjah.The file does not contain correspondence relating to the last set of case notes made in the file by the Political Agent in 1950 and 1951. These notes concern the arrangements to be made at the request of the Bahrain Government, for the cash sale of two launches lying off Dubai Creek, in settlement of a claim for financial compensation by a Bahrain subject.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Al Mukalla</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Debt recovery</topic></subject><subject><topic>Fraud</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Dubai</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Claims</topic></subject><subject><topic>Theft</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00025b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
