In the case of a State like fcsuscat where, excluding the eubsidies, the revenue ie almost wholly drawn irom cuatoma dues and allied aources, I am afraid that it is inposaible to budget soundly without being cautious. The revenue depends on the value of iiii&gt;&gt;oi*ta, wnicu directly with the value of exports, which determines the purchasing power of the country, and is a very uncertain factor. The main articles of export from Muscat are dates and dry fish. With regard to the former tnere is uncertainty not only in regard to the crop but in regara to the raaricet. Failure of or delay in the usual ripening wind or a fi^aiieial crisis in America (the largest importer) may reduce the value of the crop by half. The aa^e uncertainty in regard to markets affects the value of the latter. In 1932, for instance, there was a sudden drop in the demand from Germany (the largest i^irchaser) for dry fish. 3. In these circumstances I lear it is impossible xor me to give an opinion as to whether the revenue anticipated in the budget for 1936 has been under-estimated. 4 # It must be remembered that the budgets for -934 ana 1936 / D.&gt; .C roe _sq.,C.I.^.• Deputy Secretary (Foreign) to the Government of India, Simla.&lt;!&lt;o •2 1935 were drawn up without ^he assistance of a financial Adviser and, on the whole, it is preferable that the Sultan should exhioit a tendancy to caution rather than to optimism.

Continuation of the Arms Traffic Subsidy for the v/hole year^i^i payment of arrears of rent of the Gwadur and Shinas lending grounds and an excess in Customs receipts were chiefly responsible for this increase. otatement E .

Sir, 1 have the honour to forward herewith, in duplicate, the Muscat State Budgets for the year 1936 furnished by the Director of Revenues in the absence of His Highness the Sultan at Dhofar. 2. Receipts . Total receipts are estimated at Es. 6,12,000 i.e. Es« 15,976 less than the amount estimated for 1935 and Rs. 1 # 79,308/8/- less than Ihe actual receipts for that year. Last year the increase of receipts over estimated figures was principally due to full payment of (a) The Arms Traffic Subsidy (b) Receipt of arrears of aerodrome renins ard. ^c) increased Customs revenues. For this year owing to the question of the continuation of the Arms Subsidy still being under consideration the amount of Es. 1,00,000 was correctly omitted when preparing the estimates and also^ of course^item lb) above, which will not reoccur this year. Receipts under (c&gt; Customs, have been estimated as for 1935, it not being safe to count on increased receipts again from this source. l-tems (a), (b) and (c) above i.e. 1,71,470/11/- together account for practically the whole difference between the actual receipts for last year and the estimated revenue for 1936.- 2 - ^ lL '' ) The difference between last and this year 's estimates i.e. Es# 15,976 is, except for a few minor changes, accounted for by the fact that a small portion only of the Arms Traffic Subsidy ^1rom 1st January to 10th February) was budgetted for in 1935. therefore Ihe figures ^diMKXMe estimated for 1936 can/be considered reasonable. 3* Expenditure . fis. 6,05,744 have been budgetted for 1936 as against 6,14,384 for 1935. The difference of Rs.8,640 is due to a few minor changes* i'he actual expenditure during 1935 amounted to Rs« 6,71,792/1/- and the excess expenditure as explained in my letter filo. 16i9 dated 11th February 1936 was incurred Yhen it was imown thkt the Arms Traffic Subsidy was to continue for the whole year.

It will be seen that the stateinents showing the financial position of the State (including details of debts and loans) for the first and second quarters of this year have not been included with this letter as they are still awaited from the Muscat Govern ment in spite of repeated reminders and a personal reference to the Sultan byjme on the subject. This final action has resulted in the complete statements for the third quarter being at last received, and since this period covers the first two quarters, presumably the missing statements would not now be required. I managed to extract a promise,though only a verbal one, from the Sultan that he would issue the necessary orders that during his absence on his world tour the complete statements showing both progressive receipts and expenditure as well as the financial position of the State at the end of each quarter would be forwarded when due to the Agency.

The reason that I did not send the usual statement of the financial position of the State with my letter No, 293/V1II/B-15 of 8th March was that although it had been received it was found to differ by as much as Us 43,000 odd from the actual figures as supplied by the State in their quarterly statements which were forwarded with my above quoted letter. Since that time we have been maicing unsuccessful efforts to find out where the real discrepancy lay. Since the departure from Muscat of the late Director of Customs there is confusion in that Department. I now forward copies of the statements of the financial position of the State for Ist January 1938 and 1939 for what they are worth, which are correct only to a margin of the discrepancy of Zs 43,000 mentioned above. 3. Similar discrepancies nave been noticed in tne past but in tnose cases trie Director of Customs on being referred to rapidly made tne necessary adjustments durable Lt.

The Sultan having already told you that he had no oejection to supplying these statements, vide paragraph 2 of your letter under reference, I do not in the future anticipate any further trouble in this connection. u*.&amp; Statement showinf financial position of Muscat and Oman Government on 1st January 1938.

The principal correspondents in the volume are the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (chiefly Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Fowle, who held the post up until August 1939), and the Political Agent at Muscat (chiefly Major Ralph Ponsonby Watts from June 1935 until April 1939, and Captain Tom Hickinbotham from April 1939).The volume is largely comprised of copies of the quarterly submissions received by the Political Agent at Muscat from the Muscat Government’s Director of Revenues, and then forwarded onwards to the Political Resident. These submissions include: statements of progressive receipts and expenditure for Muscat State, annual state budgets, and other items, such as cash on hand statements. The budget sheets give details of the various appointments and salaries across the Muscat Government’s various departments, including: the civil list, government employees, civil courts, Qadhis [Qādī], forts, police, defence, plus figures for transport, rations, arms and ammunition, building repairs, etc. The volume also includes correspondence between the Political Resident and the Secretary (or Deputy Secretary) to the Government of India, to whom copies of the Muscat State accounts were sent. This correspondence covers queries about the accounts, addressing discrepancies or unexpected rises and falls in the figures.At the front of the volume (folio 2) is a letter from the Political Agent in Muscat to the Political Resident, dated 11 January 1935, confirming that Saiyyid Nadir [Nādir bin Fayṣal bin Turkī] has finally accepted his reduced allowance from the State. Earlier correspondence on this matter can be found in the preceding subject file ‘File 35/137 III (A 63) Muscat state budget’ (IOR/R/15/1/450).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Financial administration</topic></subject><subject><topic>State budget</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001a8#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
