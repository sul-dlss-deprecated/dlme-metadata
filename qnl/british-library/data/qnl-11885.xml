NOTES. Volume III, Routes in Persia, lias now been broken up into two parts. Part I comprises routes in South- West Persia east of a line drawn from Bandar Dilam through Behbehan and just east of Narghun to Isfahan. Part II comprises routes in South-West Persia west of the above line and those in a small part of Turkey in Asia. Simla ; »/ 2 Route No. 1— contd. Ko. of stage and total distance. Details, 1 ——, ■ -- ■ ■ ■ »— * CHAH-I-’ ALI .. H nl. General direction K 11 m. The road crosses a wide open sandy plain to 1 mile, where the bed of a nala is entered and descended. The banks gradually increase in height until at 1 J miles it joins a wide ravine with a sandy bottom and rocky sides about 30 feet high. The track now ascends out of the ravine, and runs along a fairly straight depression in a plateau showing a gentle sloping surface to the east, and perpendicular broken edges to the west. The track now descends into another nala at TJ miles, which is crossed close to its junction with a larger immediately on the right of the track. The ascent from the nala is somewhat steeper than the descent. The going is over sheets of sandstone rock. At 5 miles, a rough plateau is reached, over which the track lies to about 8 miles. There are low rocky ridges about 500 yards away to the right, and on the left, the plateau ends in a precipitous, and broken edge, which sinks down into a large water-course on that side. The ground undulates a good deal, but throughout the changes of level, the surface is always the same sheet of solid sandstone rock. At 8 J- miles the track descends into another large water-channel coming in from the right by a steep and narrow path. This is crossed by a ford just below its junction with another nala coming in from the opposite side. The track now ascends the latter to 9J miles. The bed is some 200 yards wide., full of huge stones, and bordered by scarps about 40 feet high. At 94 miles the nald forks, and the track runs up the smaller and left-hand branch, which is extremely rough and rocky. This ravine leads up to the west of Chah-i-’AlI. Caravans instead of halting at Chah-i-’Ali, frequently stop at Tsin, which lies about 2 miles to the west, and consists of 150 houses. Water. —Good but limited from qxndts. Supplies .—Practicallv nil. 2 GINAU .. .. 12 m. General direction N. 23 m Leaving Chah-i - 5 All the road at 1 J miles1 3 Route No- 1 — contd. crosses a large water-channel running from east. The route now lies up the left bank of another ravine, which joins that just crossed a little below the road, to If miles, and then comes out on to a rough stony plateau over which the going is bad. At 7 f miles a low long stone db-ambdr lies to the west of the road, after which the going improves. At 9 J miles the track branches. The road following the left branch crosses a small ridge at 10 J miles, and almost immediately afterwards, leaving the plain, proceeds westerly, following the course of a gorge, over a rather steep and indifferent track. At 12 miles a small plain is reached among hills, where is a palm grove and a water tank. The water runs dry every summer. Close by is a spring strongly impregnated with sulphur. The village of Ginau lies about half a mile further on ; it consists of a few houses ; there are four or five miles turned by water. Water ,—Foul from a tank. Between April and the first fall of rain, would have to be brought. Fodder ,—Grazing scarce. Supplies .—Practically nil. 3 SARZEH .. 16 m. General direction N.-W. The track leaves the 39 m. water tank, along a broad road easily passable for all arms. After some palm groves, strike north towards an db-ambdr, at 2 miles, around which are a few huts. The water is sweet. The right bank of a broad shallow ndld, on the right of the road, is reached at 4 miles. The water in this ndld is said to be brackish. The Kuh-i-Ginau lies 2-3 miles, off to the left, and another range 5-6 miles off to the right. The track now crosses an undulating upland plain, which slopes down from the Kuh-i-Ginau; the going varies, gra dually improving and descending. At 8 J miles a dry water course is crossed, with steep banks and a stony bed, which joins a river about half a mile to the east. At 10|: miles the track descends by a gentle gradient to a lower plateau, which con tinues undulating and broken to Ilf miles. From hereto 14-f miles the going is good, at first over sandy clay and then over gravel. At 14J miles a river, containing fresh water, is crossed. The river lies about 40 feet below the level of the plian, and its left bank, in some parts is a rocky scarp. The route now lies up a rocky ravine on to an open plain of sandy gravel. The river flows on the left, 100 yards distant, and on the right is the4 . Route No. 1— end of a rocky spur or ridge. Just before reaching vi ■of Sarzeh, at 16 miles, the river has again to he lorded. I he village consists of a few scattered huts. Water .—Good and abundant from river Fodder .—Grazing scarce. Supplies -—Very scarce. 4 ZURATU •• 18 m. and/or the last quarter N.-W. Follow the right bank of the stream for 1 mile. From here the track runs across the plain keeping a ridge continuously on the right. The pia known as the Sahra-i-Dardam, is 4-5 miles wide, and is follow ed for 8 miles. At 2f miles a river-bed with a stony channel, 100 yards wide, is crossed. The road now runs over the stony plain to about 6 | miles, where it bends to the left round the end of a spur of a long rocky ridge. On the other side of the spur the road drops into a river-bed which is con tinually crossed and recrossed up to 11 nul#s. At 12 ^ miles a small palm grove is passed some few hundred yards off to the left. The open plain of Barak is on the right. At 14J miles the village of Gishan is passed 2-3 miles off to the right. On the right commences a great ridge of sloping strata which runs para - lei to the track. The river runs all the way parallel on the right to 161- miles, where it is crossed. An ascent of 100 feet is now made to a stony plateau, 200 yards broad, and having a broad water-course on either hand. At 18 miles the hamlet of Zuratu is reached. It lies immediately under the range of smooth hills which bounds the S.-W. side of the valley. Water Good and abundant from a spring at the base ot General direction for the first three-quarters of the stage J5.-E. the hill. Supplies.—Very scanty. 5 ABM ARC AMP.. M|m. General direction - W.-N.-W. Proceed up the vallqy over a stony upland and descend gradually over undulating ground. At 3 miles a ndM is crossed and an ascent made to the top of a small Icutcd at 4 miles. At H miles a tributary flows into the water course on the left. The track lies down the river-bed, which is narrow, and the going bad. At 6 miles the river widens out and the road continues across a more open stony plain. The * ‘ j5 Route No. 1 — palm groves of Guhra now come in sight. The direct road to Ab Mar leaves Guhra on the west, and makes for the village of Kutabad. At 7 | miles a river-bed is crossed, and an ascent made over a stony plain on the far side. At 9 miles is the village of Kutabad. From here the route lies up a gradually narrowing valley bounded on the east by conglomerate and mud cliffs. The going is stony. At 12 miles the hamlet of Narakun is passed on theS.-W. 300 yards off the road. Here the valley narrows, and at 12 | miles begins to widen again. The road now crosses from the S.-W. to the N.-E. of a valley lying close under a hill, at 141 miles. Thence across the valley again over stony ground to Ab-Mar, lying on the N.-E. side of the valley at 16J miles. Here are a few houses. It is better to go on another 4-| miles further north, where there is a little water in a nala ; it shortens the next stage. Leaving Ab Mar, direction N.-E., the valley widens out into an open plain bounded on the N.-E. by a lofty range. The road then swings round and assumes a northerly direction, a ridge of hills being close ont he right. From here the route lies over a stony plateau for about a mile and then drops down into a nala by the left bank. A few' hundred yards further on, a trickle of sweet water emerges from shale in the bottom of the nald. There is a good camping-ground on the left bank above this water. It is not stated whether this water is perennial. The time of year, at which the trickle was found as stated, was in the beginning of April. Camping ground .—Good 4-| miles N. of Ab Mar . Water .—Good but limited. Supplies. —Scarce. 6 ' SA’ADATABAD .. 24 m. General direction for the first half of the stage 971 . m&lt; N.-E., for the latter hall'N.-W. The route continues to follow the bed of the ndld for 4 or 5 miles. The E. side of the ndld consists of a limestone range. Thence to 4-|- miles undulating ground is traversed, where anotheroruZu is entered and ascended for half a mile. The track then emerges by the left bank on to a plateau, and a Jcutal is reached after a few hundred yards. From here the road descends over an undulating stony plain for 2-3 miles. To the left front can be seen the point of the range which marks the entrance to the Tang-i-Zagh. There is a rather steep descent,Koute No. 1— contd. for the first quarter of a mile, and then stony going. At 12 miles the track lies in a stony river-bed in a valley with limestone hills on either side. A sharp turn to the left and gradually descend into the Tang-i-Zagh, which continues 14J miles. The going is bad ; there are narrow points, and in w r et weather the gorge would not be passable. It is irn- . practicable for anything on wheels, and it is difficult for pack animals : serious operations would have to be undertaken to make a rough path. At 14| miles, the Tang-i-Zagh ends in a defile. The track continues down the ndld to 15 miles, where it leaves by the right bank, and thence continues the descent over a stony plain which gradually widens. The plain is covered with scrub and bushes. The track follows the course of a qandt. At 19 miles, a ndld is crossed and the route swings round some hills into the Tang-i-LambI, which is a winding ravine with precipitous sides. At 24 miles the village of Sa’adatabad is reached. It is a village of some 3,000 inhabitants lying outside the walls of a fort. There is much cultivation a short distance to the W. Water .—Good and abundant from a well, and at times from a stream . Supplies. —Scarce. 7 GAKUM .. 12 m. General direction N. by — W. The village of 109J m. Gakum lies at the N.- E. extremity of the alluvial plain, in the S.-E. corner of which lies the village of Sa’adatabad. The route at first lies over a stony plain, gently ascending, and at 3 J miles the remains of a former town is passed among jungle. It is. known as Sar-i-Chahan and is now nothing but mud heaps. At 4 miles a ruined mud tower is passed 500 yards to the right of the road. The going is good. At 4| miles the jungle ceases, and the track continues good, over pat, iov the rest of the stage. The direction is towards a volcanic mass lying at the base of the range bounding the N.-E. side of the plain. The range is the Kuh-i-Gakum. At 6 J miles the volcanic mass is reached and passed to the right. At 8 | miles the road strikes across the plain for the corner of the Gakum date groves. At 11 miles the date groves are reached, and at 12 miles the village of Gakum.

Pass ing this the route swings X. and makes for a ruined caravanserai at 2 miles. At 3 miles, the track leaves the plain, and ascends a gorge up a rough stony track, afterwards emerging on to a small plain, which is traversed in a north-westerly direction for 600 yards, where there is a sharp and bad descent into a river-bed, the direction changing to X.-E. At 4 miles the track again drops into the river-bed and ascends the course of the river, 'which is here enclosed between rocky sides. At 44 miles the route leaves the river-bed, thence continuing for one and a half miles over undulating country. Spurs of the Kuh-i-Gakum close in on the right. At 6 miles there is another drop into the river-bed ? at a point where it makes a deep bend northward. The stream is crossed twice and then the track continues alon£ the left bank. At 7 miles the centre of the water-course becomes very marshy. At 9 miles there is some cultivation, and a palm grove, on the left bank of the river. The bed now narrows down as the road nears Hajlabad, and the going is generally bad. At 12 miles, the tiny village of Kuldan is passed ; the village is on the right bank, and the road a short distance from the left bank. At 13 miles the track crosses to the right bank of the river. At 13| miles there is a palm grove on the E. of the road, which crosses a, water-course from the Tang-i-Xiza. At 14 miles the village of Hajiabad is reached.

At 13} miles the road runs between low hills; there is some scrub and small thorny bushes. The road now lies directly on the peak of the Kuh-i-Mashlz. This mountain is a long one with several peaks ; the \ illage of Mashiz lies to the E. of it. The road continues down an open valley, bounded by low hills with scrubby thorns. At 18} miles a broad channel is crossed near a ruined fort, with a stream of good water in it, and a little cultivation. This might be made a halting point for troops. A few villages are passed on the right, and at 21 miles the ruins of Kaleh Muhammadabad is seen on the right.

The route for the first 26 m. \l\ miles identical with that given in the main route. Just beyond this point near the caravanserai of Khan-i-Kuh, the track branches off to the left front, and runs down the bed of a shallow ravine, about 50 yards across. At about 15 miles the track emerges from the foot hills and then runs across a clay soil, with a thin crust of gravel and devoid of vegetation. At 2 If miles the main drainage channels of the valley is crossed. It turns from S.-E. to N.-W., and is shallow, without perceptible banks, and a gravelly bottom. After passing the river, the track lies over sandy soil, wdiich 'would be heavy for guns to 2 If miles, where cultivation com mences.

Leaving Baghm m * _ and crossing a line of deep qanats the road lies over undulating ground mostly gravel and sand. lor the first two miles or so the route lies through cultivated ground. Cultivation, however, continues down the centre of the valley, whilst the road turns N.-E., and, rounding an outlying red spur, passes close to the base of the hills on the left. At this point the village af Akbarabad lies some two miles t° the right of the road. There is some heavy sand going, follow ed by clay, until it nears the little village of Sa’adatabad, at about 11 miles. The village lies about a quarter of a mile to the north of the road.

The route now lies over low slippery ground which is evidently sub ject to inundations. This ground can, however, be avoided by making a detour round to the right, which would lengthen the road by about one and a half miles. Here the soil is sandy, covered with a surface coat of about an inch and a half of clay. There are a few shrubs about. At 1 1J miles the swampy tract is left, which is said to be dry in hot weather, and the route is over a gravel soil covered with clumps of date trees and wheatfields.

The road now becomes impass able to field guns, owing to the number of loose rocks, stones and 'boulders with which it is strewn. At miles a stony, dry and shallow water-course is crossed. At 2 J miles the track crosses a ravine thirty feet deep and seventy yards wide, with precipi tous stony banks. The route now skirts the foot of a range of hills on the right. At miles it runs up a dry watercourse between two hills and then ascends gently between two other hills a few yards apart. At 3| miles a salt streamlet is crossed in the river bed ; the sides of which are white with salt blocks one and a half inches thick ; then up by a narrow footpath, which 'twists in and out between rocks and debris fallen from the surrounding hills. The road is very bad and just passable for mules with great care. At miles there is a small open piece of ground among the hills. Near by there is a rocky ravine in which water is found in basins after rain. The route now lies up a steep and winding ascent among crags. At 5J : miles it runs over an open but steep hillside whose summit is reached at 64 miles. The descent is by a stony pathway between hills. At 7 miles a ravine is ascended, and occasional shrubs and small trees are passed. At 7 f miles a large tree is passed, and then leaving the stream bed, the road passes over a small bit of open ground covered with wheatfields and at 8 J miles the caravanserai and a few huts of Serai Kuh-i-Champeh is reached. Water is obtained from a^large circular tank, thirty feet deep and forty feet in diameter. There are no inhabitants or supplies. The route now lies over level ground to 8 § miles and then down a gentle descent by a good hard winding road. At 8 § miles a steep descent commences down a rocky hillside, where there are precipitous barren peaks on either hand. The slope is about 8 °. The track, which is very bad, is cut, or rather worn, in the hillside. At 9 miles the road becomes exceedingly bad, a steep zigzag descent of 13°, over rock. A slight retaining wall has been erected here and there at the sharp turns to prevent accidents. Then along the edge of a dry stream bed at the bottom of a ravine. At 10 | miles the route is running along the dry bed of a stream still descending. At 11 1 miles the road reaches the bed of a salt river flowing S.W. This river is said to be always running and it is but slightly salt, the water, however, being undrinkable. The bed is ICO to 150 yards wide with precipitous and overhanging bank.57 Route No. 12— contd. / The surrounding country is wild and desolate in the extreme, and high mountains tower on every side. The road at first runs along the left bank of the stream which it occasionally crosses. At 13£ miles the river is crossed. The current is slow. In times of flood this road would be impassable from Ilf miles to 13f miles. The river is now left by a short but steep ascent, where the soil is soft. At 13^ miles the small caravanserai of Tang Kuh and its cistern are visible at about a quarter of a mile distant to the left of the road, which now runs over fairly open ground, and at 14J miles crosses a small dry ndld. Then over a small stony open plain, until at 16 miles it descends down over a steepish ledge of rocks. At 16J miles the road enters a winding ndld between high perpendicular banks. Then over a bit of open ground and through another ndld four feet wide in the track with perpendicular banks 30 to 50 feet high. After 50 yards the ndld opens out to 12 feet. The heights on either side are apparently flat-topped. At 18£ miles the defile is left and the route passes over more open but stony ground with desolate hills all around. At 9 miles a ndld is crossed, and a quarter of a mile further on a stream, the water of which is salty. There is a little grass and other vegetation about. This is followed by a gentle ascent towards a caravan- serai, which is passed at 19J miles. At 20 miles a descent is commenced, and a deep ndld is crossed, the track then running over broken ground amongst water-courses until 20 f miles, when the road ascends sharply out of it.

The road is smooth and gravelly, and the hills near are covered with grass and prickly cactus. At miles down by a very steep descent of 23° slope into a deep ravine with perpendicular cliffs and a sandy but hard bottom. At 9f miles the ravine becomes more extended, and the sur rounding hills less lofty, then up and down amongst crags. At 10J miles there is a steep descent by a narrow path, about 3 feet wide. When the bottom is reached the track proceeds along another ravine. There are perpendicular cliffs on either side of the road, as the road runs along its bed, which is 50 yards wide.* but gravelly and firm. At lOf miles the direction changes to the left. A road to the right along a ravine comes in from Bandar Abbas to Bastak. The route is now along a ravine through which runs a salt water stream the banks of which resemble partially thawed snow. At 11 J miles the bed of the river Meh- ran is reached, flowing east; the water is salt, and the river bed is 600 yards wide, some 40 or 50 yards of which occupied by the water. The bank at this point on the S. side slopes gently down to the water. The further bank is perpendicular and some 30 feet high, being composed of a mass of boulders of all sizes. The road now runs along the right bank of the river until 12 miles, where it crosses the river at the head of a pool. The water is about a foot and a half deep, flowing slowly. The road now ascends over a steep gravel bank, and at 12 J miles the caravanserai of Mehran is reached. The river here is said to flow from Jamarin to Bandar-i-Khamir and thence to the sea. There are no supplies, and the water is obtained from a tank.

The river, which is almost concealed by the dense growth of rushes on its banks, flows swiftly to the E. over the plain to the north of Hajiabad. The breadth from bank is about 70 yards ; the water is much broken up, running in places in three or four channels, separated from each other by dense bushes. It is unfordable at this point, but from the position of the villages three-quarters of a mile lower down it is probable that a passage exists at that point. There are no boats. The road crosses it by a masonry bridge, all the arches of which are under water. It has a stone parapet about 2 ' high and a paved roadway which is just passable to guns. In rainy seasons the bridge becomes com pletely submerged, and all communication between the banks is rendered impossible.

The plain here is all more or less salt, very soft, and after heavy, rains would be very bad going indeed. It is cut up by several water courses; rains, however, do not bother this part of the world much. At 3J miles a large stream is crossed, the water of which is quite salt, breadth about 10 feet with a depth of 6 or 7 inches. At 4| miles another branch of the stream is crossed, the water of which85 Boute No. 17— contd. is also salt.

The plain now closes in to the N., and the road runs along the base of some low hills on the right-hand side. This is* known as the Dasht-i-Tashkurd. A long, level plain about 50 miles in length and some 15 broad ; at the N.-N.-W. end is the Buluk-i-Fadam ; 7 miles off in a fiorthernly direction is the village of Dasht-i-Kanar, and due S. a long range of hills known as Galagah ; this range seems to bound the southern side of the plain for its whole length. At about 24 miles the road gets clear of the hills, and runs over the plain, which is covered with low scrub. The road is only a track across the plain. At 26 miles the village of Taskat is reached, which is stuated some three miles off the main road. The place is very dilapidated with no good roads ; it has, however, a very fine date grove. 9 FURG •. 19|- m. General direction W.~ * N. - W.

At 19| miles the town of Furg is reached —vide stage 13, Route iso. 7. one by gardaneh and one by a tanit, tne latter being some three or four miles longer than the former. The latter is the easier route, and is more or less level the whole way, but is full of twists and turns. The shorter route is that described. The road runs across the plain for about 3-| miles, where a long ascent commences, which continues to 6 | miles. The ascent is not very steep, but the going is somewhat stony. There is a tank near the top of the pass, which is known as the Gardaneh Bazan-i-Furg, From here there is a gradual descent over a very stony road. The going is rocky and bad. At 3 miles the bottom of the descent is reached, and, after passing through some rather confined country, at 9 miles, the route lies through a valley over level and easy going. At 14 miles the village of Rusaq ‘is reached. The hills to the N. are high and bold ; those to the S., whilst of inferior height, are much broken up ; some with a considerable amount of scrub have abrupt sides and sharp, bold peaks. In the valley itself, clumps of myrtle, with several isolated kandr trees, are scattered about, whilst there is a wood deal of cultivation, with a fair stream of clear water running through the centre.

The road now ascends out of the narrow valley between two spurs of some low hi] Is, up an easy gradient, the top of which is reached at about 5 miles. The southern hills now begin to diverge from the road, and the plain begins to open out. At 16 miles a ruined village and a tower are passed, slightly off the road, where there is some water. The road now makes a some what serpentine course so as to avoid some insignificant hills. A little further on the road runs for a few miles along the dry bed of a stream, after which it enters between some low hills, in front of which are numerous low mounds, also evidences of former buildings. At 21 miles the road comes out on to a level plain, and about a quarter of a mile to the right the village of Fathabad is passed. At the immediate exit from the hills are the ruins of a large mill.

At 3 f miles it crosses over a low rocky ridge, and, descending on the further side, runs along their foot over broken ground. At 4 miles it enters a dry stream bed which comes down over a great expanse of open grassy ground from a hill away to the X.-W. following the dry watercourse, which is sixty yards broad. At 4 f miles a point is reached where another watercourse from the X.-W. joins that which the road has been following in a dense jungle of putabid trees. On the left is a rift in the hills where the united watercourses enter between walls of perpendicular rock about 600 feet in height. Entering the rift and following the watercourse for about half a mile, a point is reached where a copious stream of the purest water rises from the ground. On the other side is a dense growth of reeds. This is the source of the fresh-water river Rudbar in the centre of the mountain of that name. Its further course lies between per pendicular walls similar to those already described, and it is ei(w)GSB90 Route No. 17— contd. impassable to man until it emerges on to the Darab plain.

Between stages 5 and 10 the road is more or less a level desert. Stages 1 to 5 run through hilly country, but, wiih a small amount of labour, the road would be quite passable for artillery ; Stages 6 to 10 are across a practically level desert and there does not appear that there would be any obstacle to the passage of guns. Stages 11 to 14 the road is level or slightly undulating, the greater part being stony. Between Khan-i-Khit and the point called Pul-i-Talkh, the road passes through low hills where the present track is too narrow for wheels. At Pul-i-Talkh a road for wheeled transport would have to be made over a rocky ridge, about 30 feet high and about 150 feet wide, or a bridge built over the stream which is formed by the spring at the end of the ridge. The bank of the stream being marshy, a ford is not practicable unless brushwood were laid down, and there is very little in the vicinity.

This route is regularly used between Jahrum and Shiraz, Bandar ’Abbas and Lar, Lar and Jahrum, occasionally between Lar and Shiraz, and seldom, if ever, between Bandar Abbas and Shiraz. As reards Lar, Bandar ’Abbas is more distant than Lingeh, but the grazing is better and the^road far easier to the former place. Between Lar and Jahrum there is no alternative route, except between Juwun and Jahrum, and the road traversing a succession of fertile plains is regularly used for local traffic. Between Jahrum and Shiraz there is considerable traffic all the year round, which goes almost en tirely by this route, the road via Fasa, or FIruzabad, being much longer and more difficult. Between Bandar Abbas and Shiraz there is practically no traffic, but what there is, appears to adopt this route in preference to that via the Tang-i-Zagh. The depredations occasionally committed on small caravans appear to be the work of the nomads who frequent this route from139 Route No. 29— contd.

Every man in the country traversed appeared to possess arms, mostly breech-loaders, and ammumtion Most_ of the muleteers carried arms between Birkeh Kun and Jahrum, after which there appeared to be little fear of thieves the country traversed being thickly populated. The permanent inhabitants of the country traversed are peaceful ana law-abiding and not at all inclined to raid caravans. # ' . . , Passable throughout for all pack animals, and by infantry and cavalry, the latter with difficulty. The Hormuz valley is left by the difficult Gardan-i-Bazan, after traversing which there are no difficulties as far as Ear. Between Lar and Kumeh the road is again steep, and difficult for camels m places, but rs regularly used bv the latter animals notwithstanding. From Kuideh to Juwun the road is easy and fairly level, a pass presenting some difficu ty beinv traversed between Birij and Binaru. Between Juwun and JahrQm the road is bad in places whichever route be adopted, and camels could not be used via Chah Tiz unless the road was improved. From Jahrum to Shiraz the road is very easy an passable, with some improvement in places, even by artillery. The climate in March and April is much the same as that of the Punjab for the same time of the year, but the nights are much milder. The summer scale of clothing and oedcung should be ample for these months. Rain is seldom experienced at this time of the year and tents would be unnecessary. Date trees flourish from Bandar ?

From Hormuz to Ear, water is obtained from cisterns liable to dry up in the hot weather, but these should suffice for one regiment and transport for a day or two at any time of year. In March 1907, when this report was written, the spring rams had failed and muleteers along the route reported that the quan tity of water then found was the minimum experienced during the year. At Lar water in unlimited quantities is available for all purposes from a large aqueduct and from many wells, _ At Biriz from cisterns. Thence forward in unlimited quantities from wells, irrigation cuts and springs. At Chah Talkh, how ever, water is apt to be scanty. ]P U zl Fuel sufficient for two reg ments of Indian infantry for a day could be obtained almost everywhere by forageRoute No. 29 — contd . parties, at a short distance from the road, but British troops, who require more wood and of a heavier kind, could not be supplied. Fodder .—Grazing for camels and donkeys is sufficient all the year round along the route ; grazing is at its best in the spring (when the route was traversed) and cannot be relied on as good all the year round. Mules are little used on the route, but from Banan to Shiraz, good grazing could usually be obtained for them in the spring. Elsewhere, and at other season, they w r ould have to be fed on bhusd. Grass for horses wxmld be excessively difficult to obtain at many of the stages ; it is unobtainable from the villages ; Jchasil (green barley) could be extensively used as a substitute from Hormuz onwards, during the spring. Supplies .—Bandar ’Abbas being a seaport in close touch with Karachi, it wxmld, for military purposes, be easiet and cheaper to provide grain and possibly fodder from Karachi. Flour and food-stuff’s are already largely imported from Bombay and local purchase would not be economical. Nomads from Birkeh Nuh onw'ards are always present during winter and spring, and own large flocks, which would probably suffice for three regiments of Indian Infantry moving from day to day. The flocks consist mainly of goats, with a few sheep and a very few cows, from Bandar 5 Abbas to Lar, local supplies, except of cattle are negligi ble, though the resources of towns should suffice to establish victualling depots along the route ; supplies thus provided, one regiment of Indian Infantry could move to Lar without much difficulty. The resources of Lar w T ould probably suffice to victual a brigade with transport for an indefinite period, and also to augment the resources of Dahkuh and Birlz, which are scanty. From Birlz onwards the road traverses a succession of fertile irrigated plains, and by requisitioning supplies at each stage, from the neighbouring villages, two regiments of Indian infantry could be victualled without much difficulty. Certain stages, e.g., Chah Talkh and Mukhak, have no supplies vide Route report. No transport animals could be collected between Bandar ’Abbas and Lar ; large numbers of eamles and mules could be collected at Bandar Abbas, but this would deplete the numbers available for the Kirman route.

The river is shallow throughout, except when in flood, which it usually is in the spring ; the depth of the water when in flood never ex ceeds 6 feet, but the rapidity of the current —6 to 8 miles per hour—makes bridging difficult and fording impossible even if there be only 3 feet of w r ater. At 11J miles the road crosses a ravine running S.-W. At 13 miles is the village of Aliabad to the E. of the road, wihch, at this point, is | a mile from the river.

Impassable for wheeled transport; mounted troops would have to lead their horses 8 miles out of the 18. The remainder of the road is level, except between Mian Jangal and Sarvistan, where it passes over low bills and small ravines. It is here passable for all arms. One hundred men could make it fit for wheeled transport in a week. In the first stage, 10 miles of the road is stony and rocky, and in places very steep and uneven. The rest of the road is level, or very slightly hilly. It is generally stony, except near lake Maharlu, and between Miun Jangal and Sarvistan. At 13i miles from NirTz (stage 1), where the road debouches on to the Istehbanat valley, it passes through a narrow defile, formed by the bed of a stream, where the water has cut a passage through a mass of rock. The surface is steep and slippery and worn into a series of steps from 1 ? ? to 2 feet high ; the width is just sufficient for a laden pack animal. After heavy rain in the hills this passage is filled by a torrent about 3 feet in depth when it becomes impassable ; rain sufficiently heavy to cause this, however, is very rare, and the passage is usually dry. At the Tang-i-Karam (stage 3), 1 mile E. of Tachu, is a tank close under a spur of the Kuh-i-Kharman. There is a narrow track between the tank and the steep slopes of the spur; this track is at present too narrow for wheeled transport, but could be widened by 500 men in less than two days ; there is not room for mors than this number to work.

At 4 miles, the road branches off towards the hills to the south, and gradually ascends the stony slopes towards a gap in the range. At 5| miles the road turns more to the W., and becomes steeper, crossing steep ravines and stony ridges. At 10 miles a small spring is close to the road, and forms a small stream flowing across it. From here a road zigzags up the steep side of a rocky ridge, the top of which is reached at 11 miles. For the next mile the road is more level but stony, the hills sloping steeply down to the N.-W. side of the road. At 12 miles the road turns more to the S. over a rocky ridge beyond which it begins to descend. At 1 miles there is a small tank (full of water in May 1907) close to the road. A track branches off to the S.-E. just above the tank. The road now follows a steep stony water-course running, at 13J miles, over a slippery slope of smooth rock : at this point the sides of the ravine are very steep and close together, just leaving room for a laden animal. Just below this point the road leads down to a wider valley. At 14 miles the road passes the end of a rocky spur running S.-E. ; here there is a small tank. The road now turns W. along a valley about 4 miles wide sloping gently west- wards. There are steep hills to the N. and S.

At 7 miles the road begins to bend S., and, at miles, passes through the Tang-i-Karam between the Kuh-i-Taduj and the Kuh-i-Kharman. On the E. of the road is a large spring, known as the Chihil Chashmeh, which feeds a stream used for irrigation. About 150 yards W. of this spring is tank about 25 feet by 70 feet and about 10 feet deep, filled by qandts from the Runiz valley. The road runs close past the tank under the slopes of the Kuh-i-Kharman. At 10 miles the village of Tachu is passed.

The ground gravelley and stony, is thinly clothed with grass. Within 3 miles the road crosses three dry ndlds, which run S. from Kuh-i-Khurmuj. At 1J miles a low range of hills called “ Kuh-i-KakT 55 rises gradually, from the plain at a distance of 2 miles to the S. of the road, and with Kuh-i-Khurmuj to N. form a valley about 3 miles broad. As we advance this valley becomes gradually narrower. At 3 miles the road crosses a drv ndld called “ Gandu 35 flow westward, and, skirting the low hills to S., runs through a defile about 200 yards broad. The hills on either side are practicable for infantry and mountain guns. At 3-| miles the road crosses a narrow rivulet of water, and immediately after the dry bed of a ndld, flow of both westerly. Three furlongs further on the defile opens out into a valley from 1 to 1 J miles broad. At 5 miles the road176 Route No. 35 — contd . crosses a smaller spur, about 150 yards luoad, .

The bills on the X. side of the valley are rocky and difficult: those to S. much smaller, less rugged and more rounded in outline apparently of gravel or clay formation. At 10 miles pass a village lying to the S. nt the foot of Kuh-i-Kaki called Buneh Darazi, 100 houses distant about H miles. At 11 miles pass between low rocky bids jutting out, as spurs, perpendicularly from the range of big M s to the N„ and then radiating in every direction across the valley. At 11 miles 4 furlongs we clear these spurs, and emerge on the valley about 2 miles broad as before. At 12 miles the road leads through the ruins of a town. These ruins continue till we arrive at the fort and hamlet of Lavar.

The locality and stream are named Bidistan, and would offer a suitable halting-place. At 5 miles the road, after crossing a ndld, with perpendicular banks, ascends from the river-formed basin, which for the last mile it had been traversing. Within 7 fur longs the road crosses two ndlds with very steep and high banks. At 6 miles two villages, about 1 mile to the eastward, near the foot of the low tumular grassy hills. The upper village is named Sehu and the lower Kardineh. At 6 miles 3 furlongs we cross a stream called Kishtu, bed 50 yards wide. At 8 miles we are abreast of the southern extremity of Kuh-i-Kaki, and descend into a deep and broad ravine, of which the banks, in places, are perpendicular or nearly so. On crossing this ravine the road descends by a gentle grassy slope to the valley of the river Mund. The ground now consists of a limy sort of clay. At 9 miles 2 furlongs the ravine previously crossd, touches the road on the W. side, the eastern side of the ravine forming a cliff about 150 feet high, and the western sloping up to the foot of the range Kuh-i-Kaki at an angle of from 15° to 45°.

From Darvishi a foot path diverges to Daiyir S. by E. At 6 J miles strike the banks of the river Mund, which are steep and about 15 feet high. The cur rent is very rapid, the flow being from the eastward. At 120 yards from the high banks the actual water channel, which is about 60 yards broad, commences. The southern banks slope up gently for 100 yards, from the water to the foot of a low range of hills. The ford in April is about 4 feet deep, but very slightly lower down the water deepens rapidly, and man and horse would be carried away. Having forded this river, the water of which is saltish, the road ascends, and crosses a low range of hills of stony gravel and sandstone. The road, with a little broadening in the case of field artillery, is practicable for all arms. At 9 miles 3 furlongs the vale contracts to a narrow gorge, the W. side of which is like a wall. This continues for 1 J furlongs, when the road debouches on to a grassy valley. Now cross the rocky bed of a stream, “ Tang-i-Pallas,” 20 yards broad, with about 15 feet breadth of water, and pass through tracts of wheat and barley. At 10 miles 2 furlongs awatercourse called “ Tang-i- Nakul,” bed dry and about 20 yards broad, is crossed.

At 2 miles the cliff to W. of the road has merged in the plain, and road crosses the dry and shallow bed of a water course called “ Kalabadu,” about 20 yards broad, drammg west ward to the river. At 2| miles ford the river Riz, shelving banks, same breadth and depth as at Baghan. At 3 miles 7 furlongs the road ascends Kuh Tarjumi, a spur from the range to S.-W. barring the S.-E. end of the valley. The ascent is diffi cult owing to its steepness and ruggedness. At 4 miles 5 furlongs reach the summit of the pass (roughly estimated height above the valley 400 to 500 feet). The descent is comparatively easy. The pass is not broad enough for field guns. It might probably be turned by following the course of the river Riz, of which the bed, being gravelly or stony, is always firm, and the depth of the vzater, usually a few inches only, docs not, Butcher believes, in anv case exceed 3 feet. At 5 miles 5 furlongs finish the descent, cross a rivulet called “ Daria Mirza Kuh” flow to N-E. and enter on a grassy valley about 4 miles broad, dotted with small bushes.

The ground is broken at times, and covered with ruins. At 9 miles 4 furlongs the road crosses the dry bed of a ndld, and enters a defile between a range of hills barring the S.-E. end of the valley. The rate of travelling for loaded mules now slow r s down to 2 J miles per hour. The defile, called ' Tang-i-Ishkami Kalat,” is at first from 20 to 30 yards broad, and its sides, either perpendicular very precipitous cliffs rise to the height of 100 to 300 feet. At 10 miles 3 furlongs the N. side of the defile slopes up at an angle of about 20 °. On the top of this slope is a small plateau among the hills named 4 4 Guru Rabat,” where a thousand men might encamp. Altitude 1,186 feet. Supplies nil. Water procurable, but quantity uncertain. Fuel very scanty. Grazing fair. Thence the road, by an easy ascent, passes up the defile, which now varies in breadth from 50 to 200 yards, the rate of travelling becoming 2 miles 2 furlongs per hour. At 11 miles 7 furlongs a rivulet of good water runs down the defile. One mile in advance reach the summit of the ascent, altitude 1,556 feet. The road through the defile now descends, and is only from 20 to 30 feet wide. At 134 miles the perpendi cular cliff, about 200 feet high, forming the N. side of the defile, finishes abruptly in a broken precipice. Three furlongs further on the road enters a grassy vale strewn with the ruins of houses Here the Tang-i-Xshkami ends, and the road passes through a chaos of hills. At 16 miles 1 furlong the road runs along the dry sandy bed of a watercourse, about 15 to 20 yards wdde, flow to E. ; on the N. side of this channel, is a cliff from 100 to 200 feet high ; on the S. are low hills.

Five furlongs further on the road crosses the dry, stony bed of a watercourse, about 60 to 70 yards broad, flow r to S.-W. to the river Riz. The road then passes through groves of date trees, and fields of wheat and barley, which continue till the village of Riz is entered, situated in a grassy valley about 3 miles broad.

Ascending from the defile by a short and steep ascent, at 6 | furlongs, we cross the dry bed of the Rlz river, and traverse a district called “ Parehaga ” cul tivated with wheat, barley, and date trees. At 1 mile 3 furlongs we again cross the river Rlz or Jam, as it is here called, consist ing of two or three rivulets flowing in a bed about 200 yards broad. The road then rises gradually, and passes along the top of a cliff about 200 feet high, at the bottom of which, on the S. side of the road, flows the river. At 2 miles 2 furlongs the road once more crosses the river Riz, depth 6 inches and breadth 25 feet, basin very shallow and wide, its southern side covered with a dense jungle of tamarisk, etc. Within a mile the road crosses a branch of the river Riz, depth 6 inches, and traverse a valley about 3 miles broad, thinly covered with grass, but with frequent fields of wheat, and dotted with numerous kandr bush.

At 2 miles 1 furlong the road is approaching close to the low gravelly hills to N. At 3 miles 3 furlongs enter the hills, and commence their ascent. This continues for 3 furlongs, when an altitude, above the valley, of 168 feet is attained. The rate of travelling per hour, for loaded mules, now decreases to 1 mile 1*2 furlongs, the road descending over steeply inclined185 Route No. 35 — conid. strata of rock, so slippery as to cause one of Butcher’s mules to fall. At 4 miles 2 furlongs skirt the side of a hill with a deep ravine immediately on the right or W. side. After this the pass becomes very difficult, the road winding in and out of stony rugged ravines among the hills. This continues for 2 furlongs, when the passage of the first range of hills is finished, and the ascent of a hill called ‘ ‘ Dareh-Kuh. ’ ’ This pass, extremely bad, is simply a broken irregular stair of limestone. In hori zontal distance it is about a J of a mile, and took our baggage mules about one hour to surmount. The road now passes over a grassy plateau, dotted with kandr bush called “ Bunah Ara- buneh, ’ ’ soping upwards in the direction of the course. At 6 miles 3 furlongs the road descends from the plateau by a slope of about 20 ° (horizontal distance J mile ; time taken in the des cent 19 minutes) to the valley of “ Arabuneh, ” which it crosses, and at 6 miles 7 furlongs enters a grassy gorge or glen, about 50 to 60 yards broad, named “ Bagh-i-Arabuneh, ’ ’ containing a plantation of date trees.

At 1 mile from the entrance of the glen the rate of travelling decreases to 2 miles 2'5 furlongs per hour, and the road traverses for 1 furlong slippery limestone strata, inclined across the track; over these strata flows the rivulet that runs through the glen. Now commences the ascent of a defile, at first grassy and dotted with kandr The hills on either side are now lofty and precipitous but decrease in height as the road ascends. The slope varies roughly from 3° to 10.° In the ascent pass two date groves, and four times cross a rivulet of good water called “ Sargu ”. At 10 miles the ascent becomes more rugged and broken, and the defile merges in a rocky pass called ‘ * Gardaneh Ivazmurd, ” the rate of travelling slowing down to 1 mile 6 furlongs.

The road now winds round the Jll and, at 2 miles 1 furlong, enters the mouth of a gorge or lefile. The rate of travelling decreases to 2 miles _ 5 furlongs per hour. The mouth of the pass is about } mile broad but, as the road ascends in a direction N. by E„ decreases to about 0 3r 30 yards, the hills on either side sloping up very precipitous ly or in cliff-like section. The defile slopes gently upwards, and presents no difficulty, till, at 4 miles 3 furlongs, it is barred by an abrupt rise of about GO feet in 100 yards giving a slope of about 30° On surmounting this slope a small level space is reached, severed with good grass, from which it is possible to see down the gorge for some distance. At this point the rate decreases to 1 mile 6 furlongs per hour, and the pass becomes more difficult General direction E. by N., | Ts’. skirting the foot 'of the range Zalimi,189 Route No. 35 — contd . and rugged, and continues, for 6 furlongs, to rise by alternate ascents and descents. At 5 miles, looking southward down the pass, a portion of the valley and the range of Haftchah is visible between the precipitous sides of the gorge. The pass now be comes very steep and difficult between huge jagged rocks, so close together as hardly to afford room for loaded mules to pass. On nearing the summit of the pass called 6 4 Gardaneh Zalimi, the track ascends over smooth rocky strata, sloping gently upwards. At 5 miles 4 furlongs the summit of Gardaneh ZalimT. Altitude 4,430 feet. The pass, called 4 4 Zarguzadun, ’ 5 down the northern side of the range for a short distance winds round the brink of a deep crevasse or chasm, which splits this slope of the range almost from top to bottom. The path is both narrow and steep at times, just leaving sufficient room for loaded mules to pass. At 6 miles 5 furlongs (1 hour 38 minutes occupied in the descent) reach the foot of the pass called, 44 Damimansur” a green grassy spot dotted with a few kandr and other bush, ground undulating, with low hills round about. The pass over the range Zalimi is practicable for infantry and mule batteries, but not so for wheeled transport or field artillery. This pass might be turned by marching round the S.-S. extremity of the range Zalimi, which route, I believe, presents no difficulties. The range on either side of the pass is rocky and precipitous, and would be difficult for infantry to cross at least for any consi derable body. The road, after leaving Damimansur, trends E.-N.-E., fairly easy going at miles per hour, with a slight downward slope, between the low foot hills, of the range ZalimT. At 8 miles 1 furlong the road crosses a small rivulet, water brackish, flow to N.-W. and 5 furlongs further enters a winding canon, varying from 12 to 20 feet wide, with perpendicular sides of gravel, studded w ith huge water-worn stones. On either side of the canon is undulating ground, and tumular hills clothed with grass, over which infantry and pack animals might pass. The canon continues for about 6 furlongs, when it merges in a green grass valley thickly studded with kandr trees. Usual rate of travelling now resumed. The ground is of a limy stony clay, and slopes gently northward.

About 3 furlongs further on another dry watercourse is crossed. At 3 mils 6 furlongs the ground, for a short distance, becomes stony, as on first leav ing Vardavan. The range Zalimi, distant about a j of a mile to S. of the road, rises like a wall at an angle of 40 to 50 . At 4 miles 6 furlongs Kuh Baghan is visible to N.-E. by E. above the pass, Tang-i-Zangur, which leads across the range Hava. At 6 miles 3 furlongs pass a cistern containing good sweet water.

On passing this river traverse a bare and grassless tract, the ground, of a limy clay, is inter sected by a labyrinth of small ndlds, draining to the river. These ndlds average 3 feet in depth by the same in breadth. At 2 miles 1 furlong the road crosses a dry ndld 20 feet deep, varying in breadth from 15 to 30 yards, banks precipitous, flow to N.-W. Two hundred yards to S.-W. this ndld bifurcates, the two con fluents being of about the same dimensions at the’main ndld.

Another h mile the road ascends a similar slope, resulting also from a change of about 15 feet in the general level. The road is now approaching diagonally the low range of Bunash- katu on the S. side of the valley. At 8 miles 1 furlong the road passes a cistern close to the N. side of it and within another 250 yards enters a defile called “ Tang-i-Masjid.” At its entrance the pass is about 20 yards broad, but at once opens out into a broad space between the hills. Pass by a very good and level road between low hills which are close to the track on either side. At 8 miles 2 furlongs the defile opens out into a level vale, about 100 yards broad, stony and very thinly covered with grass and small furze. The low hills on either side are steep, precipitous, and bare of vegetation. At 8 miles 6 furlongs reach the southern entrance of the pass, which is here about 200 or 300 yards broad, lined with hills practicable for infantry and mountain batteries. At this point is sighted, for the first time, the fort and rock of Girash. At the S.-W. extremity of the base of this rock nestles the town of Girash. At 9 miles 2 furlongs the road clears the defile and is descending a gentle slope towards Girash. Within the next mile, the road crosses two dry ndlds, flow to S.-E. The ground, as in the defile, is of a stony gravel, and thinly covered with grass and small scrub. At 10 miles 7 furlongs a dry water course; called “ Jangi,” touches the E. side of the road and runs with winding course towards Girash. Proceeding another 21- furlongs, cross this watercourse, very shallow sandy bed about 25 feet broad, flow to W. The fort of Girash is perched on the crest of a lofty and isolated limestone rock, which springs up from the valley, abrupt and precipitous to the height of 436 feet. The ranges Kuh Kirmiz bounding the N. side of the valley, and Kuh Siah the S., are distant from the fort-rock about H and 3 miles respectively. Near the summit of the rock, and within the outer walls of the fort, are numerous cisterns for holding water. The town also contains many cisterns, one of which is 15 yards in diameter.

The ground, of a limy clay mixed with a small proportion of sand, is covered with very thin grass, which be comes thicker as the road advances. Tim valley slopes gently downward from the range Kirmiz on the ts. to that oi Sian on the S. As the road advances the hills gradually close in, till, at 3 miles 7 furlongs, a spur from Kuh Rirmiz touches the Is. side of the road, and Kuh Siah is about | of a mile to S.

The ground is now stong, and be coming more so. The hills to K. of limestone, distant abont ^00 yards, are precipitous and cliff-like ; those to S. of steeply in- elined rocky strata. At 7 miles the road passes between a tank and a small caravanserai, and 1 furlong in advance enters a defile between low hills, those to N. of a bright brick-red colour, and cliff-like as before, and those to S. consisting of rocky strata inclined to the road at angles of 30° to 40°. These strata are broken, so as to form gaps or gates, and run in parallel and broken lines through the defile which is called “ Tang-i-Laghar. At 8 miles sight the white houses of Lar or its suburbs. At 8 miles 3 furlongs the road crosses the dry and stony bed of a small ndld, flow to N.-E., that had, for the last j a mile, been running a short distance to S. of the track. At 9 miles 1 furlong the defile is gradually widening and opening out. The low hills, on either side, are distant 300 to 500 yards. Advancing another | mile the road is clear of the defile, and passes a cistern full of good water. The ground now consists of a limy, sandy 7 , and stoneless clay. At 10 miles 6 furlongs passing two cisterns on the S. side of the road, cross an irrigation conduit or ditch, which runs from a large well on the opposite side.

The road is diffj- gg cult, being steep and rough. For the first 9 miles the road is quite level, though stony r several dry watercourses are crossed. The valley is about f mile wide, and is flanked by high mountains. At 7| miles the Bagh-i- Dirang is passed in a small gorge to the E.: at 8 | miles the valley is divided by a range of hills. The road takes the right-hand (western) side. At 9 miles on the Kuh-i-Seh mountain to the E. is seen the sharp descent of a route to Bushakan, shorter but reported more difficult for animate compared to the Tang-i-Zard route. This route passes back from Bushakan to Deh Beh, then ascends past Tang-i-Rud to Takhtd-Kuh-i Seh, and descends by the Imamzadeh Shah Pisr Mard, which can be seen from the Talheh Valley, high up on the mountain side. The track now passes through two deep and rocky clefts, and undergoes many undulations. There is a sharp rise, trending towards the E. xiv the Gardaneh Anjiru, which closes the Talheh Valley. At 13 miles the Tang - (Chiz )i Kuc h iku is entered from above, an abrupt turn to the right (west) being made. At 14 miles the road again turns S.-W. and, by a series of sharp rocky ascents, reaches the top of the crest, whence a view of a very deep gorge far below is obtained. The descent is extremely trying, full of boulders and turns and appears about 2,000 feet. At the base of the moun tain the track again turns to the W. and enters the Sehdar Pass, properly so called. This is very uneven and winds along the edges of hills, but there rs a gradual descent all the time towards the foot of twin peaks which stand up prominently. On reaching their base, the track follows a stony bed with running water becoming very narrow, and winding for about If miles, by very tortuous ways, to the western side of the twin peaks.

Fkom BUSHIRE to SHIRAZ via AHRAM, TANG-I- ZARD and FlR0ZABAD. ‘ ■ ' • • &gt; ■ 205 miles, 10 stages. Epitome. This is a car van route which has largely fallen into disuse but the portion between Shiraz and Tang-i-Zard is still used by caravans, chiefly of camels or donkeys. Mules, apparently, seldom if ever traverse it. Portions of it might be available for wheeled vehicles. The physical obstcales along this route are less numerous and much le&amp;s formidable than those on the post-road. The passes, with the exception of Tang-i-Bahush, do not present any severe difficulty for infantry or cavalry. The rivers, if native report, which described them in winter as unfordable, be true, might prove more serious. The road may be divided into three sections. The first section, i.e., the first two stages* viz., to Ahram, 25J miles, is almost a dead level and might easily be traversed by wheeled vehicles. The country is open and practicable for all arms. The ground is liable to become heavy after rain, particularly the first stage. The Ahram river, if in flood, might prove troublesome. Between ’Ali Changi and Bunch Gaz the deep fine sand would much impede heavy vehicles. The second section, i.e., stages 3 to 8 inclusive, Ahram to Ixavar Serai, a distance of about ITT miles, is a gradual rise over a country intersected by mountains, valleys and rivers, by a series of passes of which the principal 2d2204 • Route No.- 37 — contd. are the Tang-i-Bahush, Tangab, Gardaneh-i-Siah, and Muk, the highest point being at the top of t e last named pass (about 6,600 feet). None of the passes are as formidable as the fa/tefc-on the post-road ; the Tang-i- Bahush would be distressing for cavalry, and very difficult (Mr. Grahame and Major Brandel are inclined to think ■ impracticable) for artillery, _ _ The third section, i.e.,'from Kavar Serai to Sniraz, about 3o miles, is over fairly level open country. This portion of the road would be practicable for all arms. The last stage is apt to be heavy after rain. The principal obstacles would be fa) The Abram river. The crossing of this a few miles before reaching Ahram (stage 2), and again immediate ly on kaving that place stage 3), might prove river difficult in the winter or early spring if the were in flood. The road is sometimes closed lor a month after rain when the inhabitants_go to Ahram via Chahkutah or Boras] un.

Between the 15th November and the 15th March this tract of country is liable to be occasionally visited by heavy rains. ^ In December 1903 the Ala-ud-Dauleh marching up from Bushire to Shiraz with a large body of men lost four or five of the escort from exposure and cold. In the beginning of December 1904 the Ahram rive m con- sequence of heavy rains rose in flood, carrying away many houses and drowning many people. Wet weather rather than any excessive cold is to be looked20o Route No. 37— contd. ior during the winter months. According to native information the passes are never blocked by snow, but the rivers are often impracticable. In the summer months, of which July and August are hottest, marches would have to be made by night. Ibcder.—The prevalent notion that this route lacks water would appear to be erroneous or grossly exaggerated. The water, as far as Firuzabad (stage o), is generally brackish, though not so much so as to make it unfit for animals. There are a certain number of springs and wells of drinking water sufficient for a regiment. From Firuzabad to Shiraz water is good and plentiful. Leather buckets and ropes for drawing water from the wells, some of which are very deep, would have to be carried. ' ' c . . ' Fcchhr .—At the first stage and onward there appeared to be good grazing on the major portion of the route. Fuel.—At the first two stages the supply of fuel, consisting chiefly of brushwood, is scant. From there onward it consists of trees and is fairly plentiful, but not so much so as on the post-road. . ■ Supplies .—Supplies of fodder and forage are, according to native information, more plentiful on this route than on the post-road. ' At the first two stages supplies of all kinds are relatively scantier, but at Tang-i-Zard (stage 3), and from there onwards, plentiful. Firuzabad, with its numerous outlying villages and broad fertile plain, should be able to furnish supplies for a brigade. If previous notice were given, large quantities of supplies might be collected here, and also though to a less extent—in the Khajai and Kavir villages adjacent to the on ward line of march to Shiraz Wheat and barley are harvested from the beginning of May to the beginning of June, according to the elevation. Live-stock from T&amp;ng-i-Zard to Shiraz. Tram port— Donkeys and camels in the proportion of ten to one are employed on this route. Mules are rare. _Of the camels employed a portion belong to Mabiar and Abadeh, their owners seeking to utilise them on this route when the Shiraz-Isfahan route becomes too heavy for them. A portion belong to Jahrum, and are employed to transport opium and other produce from that district, via Firuzabad to Bushire for shipment. A third portion belongs to the Qaraghanlu branch of the Qashgai tribe settled at Firuzabad (ef. stage 5), and, in206 Route No. 37— contd. smaller numbers., in or close to Shiraz, and transports gums and carpets to Bushire, bringing back general merchandize. Camel caravans number from 40 to 50, according to one native inform ant, but according to another, from 100 to 1,000 Of the donkey caravans, some come from Maimad, trans- porting rose-water, which is extensively fabricated in that district, to Shiraz and in larger quantities to Bushire for ship ment to India. Others are the property of the Qaraghanlu tribe above referred to. Donkey caravans appear to number from 50 to 100 or more. . . , ..... Alternative stages .—From native information it would appear that stage 3 can be broken at a point known as Malakun, about 12 miles E. of Ahram. Fresh water. No supplies. (b) Stage 5. From the same source it would appear that native caravans are in the habit of breaking this stage between Bushkan and Farrashband at a point called Du Shakh, which, however, was not identified in the route perhaps it might be at the large river about 14J miles E. of Bushkan) where there is no village and no supplies are obtainable.

At about If miles is the village of Tanga with about 100 inhabitants, wells of good water, where there are palm groves, and marrows and other vegetables are obtainable. At 2 miles there is a slight descent into the Mashileh, which was quite dry in May. At about 3f miles the telegraph line is struck at pole No. 155 on the Ahmadl road. At 4 miies the line branches off E.-N.-E. towards Ahmadl. The Ah Changi road, a broad beaten track, runs almost due E. At about 7| miles a path is indicated by native information as running N.-W. to Chaghadak, and almost from the same point another207 / Route No. 37— contd. is said to run E.-S--E. to the southern extremity of Gurak. Up to 11 miles the plain dry mud with a salt efflorescence, is dotted only with a little sparse scrub. Eastward a belt of palm trees running N.-E. to S.-W. denotes the villages of 'AH Changi and Gurak. Three or four miles beyond, and to the N.-E. of the latter village, rises a large and conspicuous mound of sand and rock, known locally as Qalatak. The high sharp-peaked mountain Kuh-i-Kuhrmuj, or Bairami, to the S.-E. forms a conspicuous landmark. At 11 miles signs of cultivation are seen ; scarce wheat and barley dependent on rain water only. At 12 miles some 200 yards to the S. of the road half concealed by palm trees, are the cupolas of two imamzadehs, the larger of Mir Abdullah, the bmalter of Shaikh ’Abd-ul-Jabbar, held in great reverence by the people of Bushire, who resort to them to take vows. They are generally reputed to be 700 years old, but by some people to date back to the time of the Prophet. In that of Shaikh 5 Abd-ul-Jabbar, as reported by the native non-commissioned officer, is a stone with an Arabic inscription bearing a partially obliterated date in which the figures 87 are alone legible. At about 12-| miles a path running S.-S.-E. is said by native information to lead to Lingeh. At 13 miles a path on the left (north) leads in a few hundred yards to the village of ’All Changi. The village con sists of 60 to 70 families. Donkeys 100. Cows 20. Oxen ;80. Sheep and goats 500.

General direction E.- —- S.-E. From the camp- 25J m. ing ground a path leads S.-E. in a few hundred yards to the main road, which runs N.-E. ascending slightly for rather more than a mile over sandy country, partially cultivated, chiefly with melons.208 Route No. 37— contd. The direction then changes to E. At 1J miles a tract of sand dunes is entered, where the going is heavy over slight inequa- lities of ground. At 2^- miios th .0 track cmcrgOb into an open plain which is partially cultivated. The rocky ridge of Qalatak, N.-E. of Gurak, is sighted about 4 miles to the S., and the village of Bunneh Gaz abaut | a mile ahead. The road now trends E.-S.-E. and maitains this direction until within 3 miles of Ahram, about 2f miles are two wells of sweet water to the S. within a stone 5 s tnrow of the road j and about 2 y mixes sereial wells of brackish water a hundred '^ards off the road to the north. At 3 miles is Buneh Gaz, a village with several towers, standing immediately on the N-. side of the road, pleasantly situated among clumps of tamarisks, palm groves, and plots of vegetable cultivation. Fresh water is said to be abundant in the village. TUorA q.tv&gt; .about 120 families : suonlies, according; to native infor mation, are plentiful; there are also numerous flocks. It should be noted that from this point to Ahram there is no more fresh water on the road though report says there is some at various villages off it. .Shortly after leaving Buneh Gaz, the nature of the soil, hither to sandy, changes to hard greyish formation, which affords excellent going, although it would probably be heavy after rain. The road, as far as the Ahram river, is almost a dead level. The plain is covered with capers and other flowering plants and shrubs. There were numerous flocks and a large herd of camels grazing, the latter said to belong to Saidabad, a village which Mr. Grahams was unable to locate. Got ted about the plain both to N- and S. of the road are palm groves and numerous castellated hamlets and farmhouses. On the N. side of the road, at about 3f miles, is the farmhouse of Hap 'All with towers and at about 4 miles a short distance to the N. of the road the castellated hamlet of Kaleh Meshed Husain. At about Si miles the village of Baghak, standing about a stone’s throw to the S. of the road, the main portion about 360 feet square, enclosed by a high mud wall with round towers at three of the corners. The village is said to contain some 300 inhabitants. Opposite the village on the N. side of the road is a small half- ruined f mdmzddeh shaded by a group of tamarisk and palms fed by water, which is said to be brackish, in a deep cutting. Shortly after, leaving Baghak palm groves, apparently plentifully watered from wells of brackish water, line the S. side of the road for209 Route No. 37— contd. about 2 miles. At 6 J miles about a furlong off the road to the S., is Deh Zar Muhammad Karim, a small village said to have good fresh water. The direction is now almost due E. and at 8 miles E.-IST.-E. At about 8 J miles the A lira m river appears within 200 or 300 yards N. of the road. For about a mile the road and the river-bed run almost parallel, and then diverge, the road continuing to run almost due E., while the river trends more N. E. At about 10 miles the river reappears on^the N. side of the road. Both banks are steep, and the bed is half- choked with rushes, through which only a trickle of water flows is a westerly direction. At 11 miles the river is crossed diago* nally towards the N.-N.-E. The bed of the river here is about 187 feet wide, with only 2 or 3 inches of water in one place. A strong wheeled vehicle could without difficulty be driven across* The west bank is ramped, and the bed of the river at the ford is gravel. The road now becomes narrow, and rather lumpy track from which the river almost immediately bends away towards the S.-S.-W., while the track trending almost due E., and slightly descending, traverses partially cultivated land cut up with dry water courses, which in one or two places cross the path, passes a clump of palm trees and few tall tamarisks, and reaches Ahram at 11 | miles, on the W. side, runs along that and the S. side of the village. The village consists of about 140 families ; camels 200 ; sheep and goats 500 to 600 ; cows 200 ; donkeys 200. The village is hedged in on the E. and N. by palm gardens. About two-thirds of the houses in the village appear to be in ruins. The village possesses no mill. All wheat is handground. Camping ground .—There is a good camping ground on the far (south) side of the river bed about 1,250 feet S.-S.-W. of the village among palm trees watered by brackish running water. Water .—Slightly brackish from a -well 3 miles S.E. of the village. In the dry season water at Ahram is practically im- su table. It is also stated that water can be obtained from well in the bed of the river, 500 feet from theS.-E. angle of the village. Supplies. —Scanty. 3 TANG-I-ZARD .. 20 m. General direction E. — by N. For the first | 45 J m. mile the road runs almost due N. along the river bed, and then strikes E.-N.-E. crossing the river on a spit or island, and then another branch210 Route No. %1—contd. of the river. At 1 mile it begins to rise, running X.-N.-E. along a ndld towards the mountains. At miles it dips do vn into the river-bed and turns due E. At 2 f- miles it crosses the river from N. to S/ Eor the next 12 miles the path continues to cross and recross the meanderings of the streams, sometimes runnings alongside it and sometimes rising above it. At 4^ miles after the tenth crossing, the track passes on rising ground the remains of an old mill with clumps of tainarisk on the 8 , sicie of the road, and near it some graves. At about 6 |- miles, after crossing the streams for the thirteenth time, it enters a very rocky defile, with the remains of an old fortress, crowning a crag on the S. side of the road. At about 7| miles, th's defile opens out. The path ascends for about \ a mile, and then descends into a steep nald with a trickle of water in it. This is followed for about a mile. The path then makes three ascents with descents into the river-bed, and frequent crossings and recrossings of this. The general direction is at times E., and at times E. by N. After crossing thq river for the twentieth time at about 11 ^ miles, the path turns sharp to the N., and passes for a furlong through a narrow cleft, 15 to 20 feet wide, in the rocks, known locally as Qandil lak. According to native information (at Tang-i-Zard), there is a stream of fresh water, just beyond the upper (X. end), of this cleft at a point called Malakun, which is made use for as a halting place by caravans. The next 4 or 5 miles of road are distressing, being in a great mea ure up the bed of the torrent over boulders and rocks and at times through pools of water. The whole series of defiles appears to be designated by the name Tang-i-Bahush. At about 10 miles are the remains of an old mill, apparently used as a halting place by tribesmen or others; the water in the stream is brackish, but fit for animals. From this point the path trends E. by Sfiand after running for about 5 furlongs up the valley with stream on the right (S.) and remains pf a watercourse on the left (X.) debouches into a cultivated amphitheatre about 4 miles long by 2 broad, on the X.-E. of which lie three villages, Kalimeh (X.) Tang-i-Zard (E.) and Fariab (S.-E.) After this is entered the stream bends X.-E. towards Kalimeh. The road skirts the western side of the amphitheatre then (about 18 miles) strikes E. by X. across the plain to Tang-i- Zard, crossing the river by a small bridge, a few hundred yards before that village is reached (at about 20 miles). According to native information, 40 families of 100 inhabitants; donkeys211 Route No. 37 — contd. —i j 90 to 100 ; mules 3 or 4; cows and oxen 60; sheep and goats 100. It has a fort with two towers.

Kalimeh, a small village on the Kalimeh plain, may be used as an alternative halting place. Major Brandel states that it is now the ordinary caravan halting station and has fair supplies. Routes 36 and 38 connect here. This must be considered an important strategical point on the line of advance from Bushire to Sh T raz.

At 2 miles a path, running S. E,, leads, according to native information, to Khun, a village said to lie some 4 miles off the road. Almost at the same point the road crosses the river to the S. At 4 f miles and 5f miles the track crosses small tributary streams, flowing into the river from the S. At 5f miles, the river-bed is crossed, the ascent out of it being slight with an easy gradient. At 7 miles the river-bed is again crossed followed by another gradual ascent and descent. At 8 miles the track descends and after passing a ruin rising on a hillock just off the road to the S., and a ruined db ambdr or perhaps mill, on the S. side of the road, reaches at 8 J miles Chah Haji Sillar, a well full of excellent fresh water on the N. side of the road. The road now descends slightly. At about 9 miles there is a steep zigzag ascent for about £ of a mile, leading to a high plateau with marks of scarce cultivation and large212 Route No. :&gt;7 bandr bushes extending for about a mile. At the beginning of this plateau on the N. side of the road are traces of some old buildings ; at the eastern extremity on the S. side of the road is a large graveyard on a mound with remains of a well or reser voir under it. A small ndld meanders over the plain. The road at about 11 miles, strikes this nald, and follows alon g it, occasionally rising above it and running along the southern bank for about a mile and a quarter, smetimes due E. sometimes E -N -E. At about 12d miles, is a little spring of somewhat brackish water on the right (S.) side of the road known as Chah- i-Talkh or Talleh. Here the road bifurcates, one branch is said to lead to Khurmuj, the other turning sharply E. rounds the stone remains of an old village or stronghold, and trends striaght across a broad grassy plain partially cultivated, which here opens out towards Bushkan, the towers of which now become visible due E. The road descends very lightly, and crossing two small ndlds reaches Bushkan, at about 16| miles. This is a smei-fortified and somewhat dilapidated village of about 100 inhabitants. The village owns about 100 donkeys, and numerous cows and flocks. Water. —Plentiful. Supplies. —Plentiful. 5 FARRASHBAND 29J m. General direction E. by N. The track oji m proceeds across a plain of scrubby grass sprinkled with handr bushes, where the going is good and level. At 2 miles the remains of an old tower and some bushes are passed, being marks of an attempt made three years ago, but afterwards abandoned, to throw out a little settlement from Bushkan. At about 3 miles a small nald is crossed, and at 4 miles the village of Bideh is passed which lies about a mile S. of the road. Here, within 200 or 300 yards of the road on the S. side of it, stands the imdmzddeh of Shah Abu Darda (a son of the Imam Musa bin da’far bin ’Ali , and brother to Saiyid Amir Ahmad, better known as Shah Chiragh, whose mausoleum is the most highly venerated shrine in Shiraz) with an adjacent well of abundant but slightly brackish water. At 5 miles the track crosses a small rather deep ndld, and about 5-| miles, another rather deeper. The plain here is about 5 miles broad, with low bluffs to the N.-E.Route No. 37—contd. and high mountains in the S.-W. Between 5 J miles and 5 f miles the track crosses three small shallow nafds. At 6 miles it bends slightly more E. About miles it crosses in rapid succession two rather broad shallow nalas. About miles the road bifurcates, one track running S.-E. to the village of Sarmak, at Qfarsakhs, and Barmak at 7 farsakhs (according to the information of the local guide), the other continuing almost due E. to Farrashband. At 7| miles the bluffs on the N.-E. end in two conspicuous spurs, which here strike into the plain, and are known as Du Chang, dust beyond the furthest of these, at about 7 1 miles, the river called Rud Khaneh-i-Chimr (from a neighbouring village of that name), or Du Chang, from the spurs above-mentioned, is crossed. Its water though slightly brackish is good and dirnkable for horses. It is 650 feet broad with steep shelving banks. As the far (E.) bank is ascended in which in a little cleft or on the N. side of ndld and below the road, is a tiny spring of fresh water hidden away under a projecting bank. The road, which so far has been nearly level, begins to ascend slightly, and the ground becomes rougher. About lOf miles deflecting S. of E., it reaches the precipitous bank of a river which it follows, for a few hundred yards. At 111 miles a very steep ndld about 150 feet broad is crossed, and at about 12 miles another about 350 feet broad. About 12 J miles the soil assumes a marked whitish appearance, and a steep ascent begins which is broken by a kind of small plateau, with a remarkable cone on the N. side of the road. About 13| miles the road crosses a small ndld with a trickle of brackish water, and then runs for about f mile along the left bank. About 141 miles the road strikes a very broad (dry) river just where two tributaries join it, and it is somewhat difficult to recognize the track. Care should be taken to keep to the E., and to cross the main bed. At about 15 miles, after crossing a broad depression, the road bends almost due N. ascending. At 16 miles it crosses a trickle of water, which is brackish but drinkable by animals. Its left (W.) bank is followed almost due north, the track continu ing to ascend. At about 17 miles a steep zigzag ascent begins, the top of which is reached at about 18 J miles. From here the road rapidly descends to a small river in a deep valley. Then follows a tedious winding ascent with many ups and downs for about 3 miles, and a descent of about a mile of a similar nature-214 Route No. 37— contd . At 22i miles is a spring of slightly brackish water on the left (north) of the road in a little rocky basin under a fig tree (this sprint appears to be known as Ab-i-SIeh-i-yhr-i'Qardaneh-i- Safid). From this point the road continues to wind downward for another mile in an easterly direction towards the Farrashband plain, at the further (E.) end of which three streaks of palm trees mark Farrashband at the foot of the mountains. This plain is very bare for the first 4 miles, he., till within 2 miles of the village, when cultivation begins (wheat harvested at the end of May). At 291 miles Farrash- band is reached. Farrashband is said to contain 300 housses, and about 1,000 inhabitants ; cows 150 ; donkeys 300 ; sheep and goats 600 ; horses 40. Route No. 40 connects here.

From Farrash- 119i&gt;- in. band the track pro ceeds S.-E. skirting mountains (lying to the N., over a plain which is barren at first. At about 1 mile, there are patches of wheat cultivation. At 2 miles on the S. side of the road, are the ruins of a building, known as Chehar Taq. Out in the plain to the S.-E. another similar ruin is sighted, and beyond it the village of Barmeh (vide stage 5), said to be 2 farsakhs distant from the road. At about 21 J miles, there are large clumps of kandr on both sides of the road, and remains of wells and of watercourses. This stretch of land is known as Kunar- i-Malik. Hidden away in a cleft in the hillside, just off the road to the N., is a little imdmzd and, almost opposite this cleft, about 200 feet to the S. of the road, is a deep well, Chah-i-Daraz, of fresh water, said to be fed by springs descend ing from the imdmzddeh. At about 4| miles is a long rocky mound, known as Kalat-i-Zanjlran, said to have been an ancient fortress, rising to a height of some 300 feet, about a J of a mile to the S. of the road. At about 6 J miles the road, deflecting N., traverses an amphitheatre surrounded by moun tains. At about 81 miles a deep ndld 150 feet broad with steep shelving banks on both sides is crossed. Here the road, thus far level and good, begins to ascend slightly and becomes215 Route No. $l—contd. stony. On the right (E.) side of the road an old dh-ambdr for rain water known as A b - am bar - i - Bizari. About J of a mile further on the Tang-i-Bizan begins. The road for about l a mile becomes steeper and more rocky, then crossing a J of a mile of plateau, descends slightly to rise again to another small cup or plateau. A series of four or five such cups, with steep and in some cases very rocky approaches and exist, is traversed by the road as it continues to ascend. The direction is slightly E. of N. At about 17 miles a ruined caravanserai Pazaunu with a streamlet of fresh water running along the road side is reached. The direction from here is S.-S.-E. up a rocky valley in which there is a continuous ascent where the going is very stony. At about 18 miles a large slippery rock, insurmountable by baggage mules, bars the main track, and makes a slight detour by a mule path to right (east) for about 5,GOO' necessary. There are numerous wild almond and turpen tine trees about. At about 18|- miles is a fresh water spring, known as the Ab-i-Anjiru. At about 19 miles the road begins to descend slightly, by a good broad track. About 21 miles it crosses a shallow ndld about 150 feet broad, and reaches a wide plateau known as the Dashtak-bSiah, covered with a great variety of prickly flowering plants. There is a well of fresh water off the road to the right (E.), the Chah Anbari-i-Dashtak. To the left there is a reservoir for rain water. At about 25 miles, the road again begins to rise, trending east to the Gardaneh-i-Siah, a narrow gorge with the bed of a small stream descending it. At about 25 miles, there is a ruined reservoir on the right (S.) of the road, and the remains of a tower on a crag on the left. Just after passing these, there is a plentiful supply of fresh water flowing in the watercourse on the right of the road, fed by spring in the rocks to the left above the road. The water is known as the Ab-i-Siah. At about 26 miles, the top of the pass is reached, the last mile of the ascent being made by a very steep zigzag. The road then crosses a small plateau whence there is an easy descent of about 2 miles. At about 28| miles, the broad fertile plain of FIruzabad is reach ed. It slopes from the N.-E. to the S.-W. and is plentifully watered by streamlets having their sources to the N.-E. The gardens of Firuzabad are visible at the N.-E. end of the plain, about 8 miles distant as the crow flies, but the road sweeping all round the plain to the N.-N.-E., covers about 9| miles.216 Route No. 37— contd. Between the first and second miles three small nal&amp;s cross the road from the N.-E. to the S.-W. Between the econd and third miles, three streams, viz., the Ab-i-Khirneh (the name of the second is not known) and the Ab-i-Bagiun, the last, a consider able volume of water, flowing in the same direction, and watering the tall standing crops. At about 3i miles, the road trends a little more east, and at 6 miles, passes Deh Barm to the right (S.) of the road, a little village with some springs of fresh w r ater. At about 8 miles, the road passes the hamlet of Kaleh Siah, to the right of the road, and descends into a broad and partially cultivated 7idld with a stream flowing with consider able force, 150 feet broad, from the N.-N.-E. to the S. This is crossed just below a weir which diverts the major part of the water toFiruzahad. The water below the weir is up to a man’s knees. A few hundred yards further on the road traverses the flourishing little village of Deh Khushk, with gardens of pomegra nates and other fruit-trees over-topped by w^alnut and palm trees. On the further (E.) side of Deh Khushk is some rice culti vation. There are the ruins of an ancient town with a conspi cuous shaft of masonry about a mile to the S. of the road. On the S. is the village of Deh-i- Dehishan, and on the N. that of Bagh-i- Shah, both embeded in gardens. At about 1 U miles from the entrance to the plain and about 38 miles from Farrashban, the main portion of Firuzabad is reached. It should be noted that the route usually followed by caravans does not go as far east as FiTuzabad proper, but branches off across the plain to Deh Nau, an outstanding portion of Firuzabad, lying 4 or 5 miles W. by S. of it. Firuzabad is apparently an exceptionally flourish ing village, consisting of some eleven different portions, dotted about the plain, enjoying a remarkably fine climate and an abundance of water. It is said to number about 600 houses, with a population of 2,000. Cows and oxen about 1,000. For further information see the article in Volume III of the Gazetteer of Persia.

From Firuzabad pro- 148 m. per, which as above remarked, lies beyond, i.e., to the E. of the regular caravan road, several roads lead westward, rejoining at 4 or 5 miles,Route No. 37—contd. that road which runs almost due N. from the village of Nau Deh, the usual halting place for caravans. The one now followed runs N.-W. and passing the outlying portion of Firuz- abad, known as Sar-i-Maidan, cuts, at about 5 miles, the caravan road near the river, close to the point at which on its opposite bank (W.) stands a conspicuous ruin, apparently of a palace or bath, but known to the Persians as Atish Kadeh ’ Azam, i.e., the largest fire temple. On the S. side of it is a large circular pool of water, fed by an underground spring furnishing an inexhaustible supply of fresh water which overflows into a watercourse running eastward. From here the road, ascending very gradually, soon enters the Tang-ab pass, a narrow gorge with rocks rising precipitously on each side, and a river flow ing deep and strong down a stony bed. The road continues to ascend in the direction N.-N.-E., from which the river flows, and for about 7 mile runs alongside or parallel to the river, which it crosses eleven times before separating from it at the far (N.) end of the Halalu pass. Almost immediately after passing the ruin above-mentioned the road crosses to the W. bank. At 8 miles, it recrosses to the right (E.), near the remains of an ancient bridge. At about 8 | miles, the road passes the extensive ruins of an old castle and fortifications crowning a crest on the right (W.). At about 9| miles, it recrosses the river to the E. bank high above which further remains of fortifications appear. At about 9 f miles, it recrosses to the W. bank whi^h is then followed. The road and the river here turn almost due E., and the long line of the Kaleh-i-Dukhtar, above-men tioned with its fortifications, is now sighted from the rear. At about 11J miles, the river is again recrossed to the E. bank and then again back to the W. bank. The gorge now begins to open out and runs almost due N. At 12 miles, the road recrosse^ to the W. bank and ascends high above it. It then passes some graves, and descends to the river, recrossing to the E. bank at about 12| miles. Shortly after this point the road diverges from the river, and, deflecting slightly to the N.-E., crosses a widening plateau, passes Kaleh-i-Suzakun, to the W., and at about 13 miles enters the Tang-i-Halalu, a short and easy path between two high bluffs. Here the river is rejoined, the road running for a short distance N.-E. along the S. bank, crossing to the opposite bank, and returning. At about 14| miles is a broad amphitheatre cut up with morasses and watercourses. Cl(w)GSB218 Route No. 37— contd.

The village of Ibrahimabad, at 181J miles, lies a little to the W. of the main road, and is reached by paths running through treacherous swamps of rice, which is here extensively cultivated. It is worth noting that there is not now any parti cular village designated as Khajai, that name being given to the plain or districts extending from the Halalu to the beginning of the Zanjiran pass, and comprises amongst others the villages of Ibrahimabad, Ghiuakun, Saridan, and Zanjiran.

General direction N.N.-E. From 109 | Ibrahimabad the path runs slightly N. of E. over rice-fields to Ismailabad, at 1 mile. The road here crosses the river from W. to E. and passes through Ismailabad, apparently a larger village than Ibrahun- §,bad, and affording better camping ground. Thence it strikes across a plain covered with alternate patches of rice and clover, leaving the river to the W., and, at about 2 miles, rejoins the caravan road running due east. About 2-| miles, the ground begins to rise in very gradual shelves dignified by the name of a pass, the Gardaneh’-i-Pidunu. At 3 miles, the village of Kaleh-i- Haji Muhram is sighted about 3 miles to the N. At 6 miles, the village of Kaleh-i-Ab-Safid lies on the same side, but nearer to the road. A little stream fed by a spring on the north side of the road is crossed. At 6 J miles the castellated village of Kaleh- i-Zanjiran, appears oh a hillock about 300 yards to the N. of the road. The little stream is then recrossed. At 6 f miles and 7 miles are two springs of fresh water fed from a watercourse on the N. of the track, which bubble across the road. At about 8 miles, the small stone-built caravanserai of Zanjir, partially ruined, stands bn the right of the road. About 300 yards N.-E. of this, at the entrance to the Tang-i-Zanjlran the road bifurcates, one branch running S.-E. to Maimand, about kfarsakhs over the Seh Huran district (according to native information), the other ascending the glen by a rocky path made slippery by the over-219 X ' r* f' ^; Route No. 37 — contd. flow of water from the streamlet, which gushes down with con siderable force now on the right, now on the left, of the path, through channels or races artificially dyked up in places. About miles, the path widens out into a broad and easy ascent, the direction being N.-W. About 12 f miles, the highest point of the Zanjiran glen is reached, and at 13 miles, a few hundred yards to the N. of the road is the little village of Muk with clumps of willow trees, and a plantation of roses. The village consists of about 40 families, 40 cows and oxen—15 donkeys, and 300 sheep and goats. About 4 farshakhs to the N.-E. of the village is a large spreading chinar overshadowing a stream bubbling out of the rocks on the mountain side, affords an ideal camping ground for a small party. Close by are the ruins of an old stone building, known as the Chehar Taq. From Muk the road continues to second gently slightly N. of E. by a broad and easy incline and about a mile further on turns due E. The ascent then begins to become steeper and soon develops into a rough zigzag with a severe gradient. About 15 miles, and 2 miles beyond Muk, the top of the Muk pass is reached and a view over the Kavar plateau opens out. From this point there is a sheer descent by a broad road composed chiefly of loose shingle. At about 18 miles is a large mound on the south side of the road known as Gir-i-Bahman. Here the pass prac tically ends, but it is nearly 3 miles more before the road, turn ing due W. for | of a mile and then bending northwards, gets free of the outlying spurs and dropping suddenly into the deep bed of the Kara Aghach river, crosses that stream by a fine stone bridge, about 12 feet broad and 275 feet long, of six arches. The road then bifurcates, one branch following the left (N.) bank of the river and leading to Kavar, Muzaffari, Dashtak, Nauruzun, and other villages of the Kuvar district, while the other runs due N. reaching in less than l a mile, the half ruined caravanserai of Kavar at 2 If miles, standing on the left (E.) of the road.

It then drops for about l£ miles OTer rocky ground into the fertile well-watered valley of Baba Hajr, and skirting the cultivation, bends E. by N. for about £ a mile to the half ruined caravanserai of Baba Haji at 16 miles, in front of which there are some willow trees, a pool oi marshy w ater, and a little imamzadeh. There is accommodation in the caravanserai for about 1G0 men and horses. Route No. 29 connects here. Supplies—Nil at Baba Haji but they are obtainable from the neighbouring villages of Tiyu, Debak, to the E. and Khushki Khalil to the N.-W* skirt the eastern border of the plain here dotted with numerous wells. On the right (E.j is a low chain of rocky hills running from south-east to N.-W. Under these, at about 1 mile, a few hundred yards off the road to the east, is the small village of Bid-i-Zard. At about 4 miles, the road begins to rise. To the west, about a mile out in the plain, is a large village. The road continues to ascend, slightly bending N. by W. for about 1 mile, and then gradually descends. At about 6 | miles, the village of Deh Nau is passed, standing in the plain about a mile to the W. of the road. At about 8 miles, round the point of the ridge above-mentioned and turn due north. At 81 miles, a small stream of fresh water flowing N.-E. from Deh runs along 10 SHIRAJ 19f m. General direction N.- W. From Baba Haji the road continues toRoute No. 37 — contd. and subsequently crosses the road. At 8 | miles is the Pul-i- Pasa, a substantially built stone bridge of ten arches, about 11 feet broad and 280 feet long, spanning the Kara Bagh river, which flows sluggishly from a march W.-S.-W. in a direction N. of E. towards Lake Maharlu. The ten arches of the bridge are irregular in height and span, the five at the S.-E. and being much lower and narrower than the five at the N.-W. end. The span of the broadest arch is about 15 feet. The height of the highest arch above the water is about 11 feet 3 inches, and to the top of the parapet from the water 16^ feet. The bridge is stone- paved from end of end, and has a parapet 2 .V feet high. Close to the S.-E. end of it is a stone hovel, inhabited by a tea-seller and some road guards. About 900 feet to the S.-E. of this is a stone-built house occupied by some tribesmen, which might afford shelter for some twenty men and horses. About 450 feet to the S. of the bridge the ridge above referred to terminates in an isolated flat-topped hillock about 325 feet high, commanding the bridge. On the hill are traces of a fort and the remains of a well. The road from Fasa (Route 44) running under the S.-E. of the hillock, joins the Firuzabad road at the bridge. The ap proach to the N.-W. end of the bridge is about an angle of 30 to the road. The water in the river is brackish, but there is an abundant supply of fresh water from the streamlet above refer-, red to. After leaving the bridge, the road strikes at first W., and then gradually bends more to the N. The next 11 miles of road t\e., up to the Darvazeh-i-Ghassab Khaneh, the S.-E. gate of Shiraz are over flat open country liable to become very heavy after rains, but at other times affording good going. The road, is crossed at several points by water-courses, some deep and spanned by little bridges generally of tree trunks covered with stones and earth. At 13J miles the village of Khusrauabad, Otherwise Wazirabad, is sighted about a mile off the road to the N., and that of Dudman-i--Quvvam, alias ’All Akbar Khani, a little over J a mile to the S. At 14f miles, immediately after crossing two small bridges, the caravanserai of Jafarabad, stand ing on the N. side of the road, is capable of accommodating about 100 men and horses. Water plentiful and good and fodder obtainable. The large walled village of the same name lies about 100 yards further N. off the road. From this point culti vation, which on the S.-E. portion of the plain is scarce or non existent owing to the presence of salt in the soil, begins and con-, ‘ - ■ - mil Urr &amp;&amp;222 Route No. 37 - contd. tinues ri^ht up to the walls of Shiraz.

Close to the latter is the summer abode of the British Resident. Shortly before reaching the Mashileh the telegraph line diverges from the road and runs off in a north-easterly direction. Up to this swamp the ground is rocky, and formed either of sandstone or shelly concrete. At just under 3 miles reach the west edge of the Mashileh. In the hot weather the Mashileh is quite dry. There are three tracks across, the chief one of which follows the telegraph. Water only lies here in the wet season. In March 1888 the mud and water was fetlock deep, sometimes a little more. At miles the main road to Shiraz, Route No. 60, goes oft to the left. At 8 f miles the Mashileh finishes. The ground is low and is liable to inundation by high tides. Soil alluvial; no vegetation except a few scattered marsh bushes. At 9J miles leave the belt liable to inundation from the sea, and enter on a grassy plain. At 10J miles, low tumular hills, called Delva, distant about 5 miles to the south, spring up from the plain, which at 11 ^ miles is widely cultivated with wheat and barley. At 12 miles enter a belt of date trees, with irrigation channels and wells. This is the first water met with since leaving Bushire. It affords a good halting-ground. At 12f miles pass a hamlet of 14 mat huts. The grassy plain, with extensive cultivation, continues. Since leaving the Mashileh the track is slight, and at times scarcely noticeable. At 14^ miles reach Gurak; 50 houses of mats, or mud and stone. Stotherd reports as follows:—The road up to this point is easy-going for all arms. There is nothing to retard the rate of marching in. dry weather. The peak of the Kuh-i- Khurmuj affords a good landmark. Gurak ridge, which the road is shown in the map as crossing, is important as offering a posi tion facing S.-W. to a force advancing on Bushire from the E, or S.-E. It commands the low-lying sandy ground towards Bushire, and has a mean elevation of 300 feet above the plain. The right or northern flank is the weakest, and is open to a turning movement under cover of the date plantations. This same ridge should also afford a position facing N.-E. to a force covering Bushire against a force advancing from the E. Its extreme length would necessitate, however, a very strong body of troops to occupy it properly. It would afford some good artillery positions covering the plain towards the main mourn tain ranges. This lower ground is also very suitable for the movement of cavalry, an unusual thing in this part of Persia.224 Route No. ffl—contd. Camping ground. —Good. Water. —Good. Fuel. —Scanty.

To the N. are long stretches of barley and clumps of date trees. To the S. a grassy expanse of plain stretches to the low range of Dilbar, about 7 miles distance. This continues for a mile and quarter, when the direction changes to N.-E. by E., and the road enters among low billowy sand mounds sparsely sprinkled with grass. At 2 miles the road trends E. At 2| miles reach the top of ridge, road stony and bad but passable for field guns. Crossing the top of the ridge the grounds is very broken. At 3 miles the direction is S.-E. by E., and continues so to end of the stage. At 3 £ miles the sand mounds, through which the road has been pass ing, open out into a circular area, about J mile in diametre, sur rounded by sand mounds. Barley is sown in part of this space ; the rest is clothed very thin grass. At 4 miles the sand mounds terminates and the road then runs over a level plain, covered with very short grass, with clumps of date trees on either side. The ground is now of a whitish clay, and continues so to the end of the stage. At miles the road gradually descends. Difficult in places for guns. The village of Buneh Gaz lies f mile to the north of the track, 50 houses, wheat, barley and watermelons cultivated. Village defended by several small towers.

KHURMAYAK 2 ^ m w which'is in Dashti territory, though used by the Shish Bulukis for their winter camps, the track at mile 3 passes Dda Beh, a vifiage lying at the foot of a mountain to the S„ which is thick with Mr bushes. At about 13 miles the usual caravan route so far followed, is left, by a track leading S. of E , and the head of a small stream is crossed. At mile 15 the Chakis Buzuig, a narrow river bed forming the boundary between the Dashti and Farrashband districts is crossed, and an ascent made. Here the track goes over some pieces of rock, direction W., into a grassy plain about 1 mile broad where, except for slight undula tions, it continues level for 4 miles. It then ascends A.-E,, an half a mile before reaching Khurmayak descends from a rocky rise at the end of a pur. , r .

From mile 4—7 the track is very rough and strewn with boul ders ; from mile 11 | to the end of the stage it is free of stones and goes over flat ground through a broad plain, into which it descends by a rocky defile about 2 miles long. Mangarak has no settlement: in the winter months some of the Chigini (Qashqai) tents are pitched there ; it is situated at the entrance of a long level plain in the directin of Farrashband.

For the first 6 or 7 miles the road is very stony with a series of rises and falls, one dry torrent bed being crossed. Then a steep ascent up a mountain, whence a narrow valley parallel to the mountain is overlooked, and deposits of salt are everywhere visible. The descent is sharp and long, and very stony for about a mile. Then turning to the right (east ?) the road goes level for about 3 miles along the base of the mountains flanking the Firuzabad plain on the west, passing a ruined Zoroastrian (?) building on a rise in the plain to theN. Then cross the Shur river, and at 10 miles reach Deh Bim situated at the base of the hills closing the S.-W. end of the Firuzabad plain, and at a little distance from the Shur river. The Shur river, which has a good supply of water in December and is impassable after heavy rain, unites with the Shirin river near Pas Rudak and Duzdgah. There is much cultivation round Deh Bim and insects are troublesome in summer. S. of Deh Bim there is a narrow valley, through which the river flows, and containing the villages of Sang, Sar Sirtul, Rudban and Arab, known collectively as Arba’a. From Deh Bxm the road goes across level agricultural plain to Kushk, which is part of Firuzabad. For Firuzabad see Stage 6 , Route 37 .228 ROUTE NO. 38.

In the hot season there are only 2 to 2 ^ feet oj. water, out it is liable to be come swollen very quickly, and becomes impassable after rain. The current is swift. At 3| miles, the village of Tulamataki is passed, lying about 1 mile to the N.; it is small and poor, and is enclosed by mud walls. At 5| miles, there is a rather steep ascent from the lower ground up an underfeature. The route now gradually ascends from the centre of an open stretch of country, situated between two parallel ranges of hills. At 71 miles, a stream is crossed and the road enters a defile through which the stream runs. The banks of the stream at this point are steep and high, and its bed stony. On the high ground above the left bank is a caravanserai in good repair. At 9 miles, the village of Madkun is passed, situated on the opposite bank of the stream, enclosed in a square of mud walls. There are large patches of rice cultivation around it. The stream now runs through a range of hills by a narrow gorge, with precipitous sides. The road follows its course on the right bank, crossing the range by a rough steep pass unfit for field guns. The track, which is very narrow, follows closely along the right bank of the stream, which here runs in a narrow gorge with high cliffs on either hand.

At 8 | miles a spring is passed from which the stream is fed. At 13 miles the road reaches the top of a ridge by an easy and gradual ascent up a valley. The country here is open with low scattered bushes. At 13f miles, the bottom of the descent is reached. The gradient is somewhat steep at the top. At 14 miles a conspicuous isolated hill is passed, situated to the N., called Kafet-i-Zanzibar, where are the remains of an old fort now uninhabited. On the opposite, or S. side of the valley, is a large cleft in the rocks on the main ridge of hills. In this cleft there is a spring of excellent water, but, being some way off the road, is only used by hunters.

The route, for the remaining 4 miles of the stage, lies down a broad valley, through open country, with long ridges of hills on either hand. At 14i miles, the small town of Firuzabad is reached. The town consists of some 600 houses, with a population of about 2 000 • including outlying villages 3,000. The inhabitants are most!; engaged in fruit-farming and cultivation. Its chief importance from a military point of view would be that it is admirably suited for a halting-place and a supply depot, -the heat is never excessive, and the climate generally healthy.

This road is called the Rah-i- Kandal. At 3 miles a salt deposit at the base of a high mountain is seen through a gap in the hills to the right. A stream from this, very salt, runs across the road. Two very deep ravines, steep but not impassable approaches, were crossed. There is gradual down-hill going from Qubbeh, a hillock with one or two houses, passed at a little distance off, at about 6 miles, to Dasht-i-Dal.

It is a large village with a fort high above the road, and has fine orange gardens. There is a path to Duzeh, 11 miles, and also to Chah Kazlmeh about 50 miles, via Klaeh Qub and Deh Beh. Chah Kazlmeh is the winter camp of the Ilkhanl of the Qashqai. From the Simakan plain onwards the Qashqai country is entered and some of the tribe are camped in winter in the valley Deyond Jarmasht. The valley is here again very narrow, and the road wands up and down at the foot of the hills to the west, as far as a ridge known as Oardaneh-i-Za’fari, which marks the boundary of the Simakan district. From Aidui, a w r alled village on the left above the road, there is a descent to the right round the base of a hill. The path here becomes very narrow, in di tinct and difficult, passing through a small stream, under a projecting ledge of rock. Badinjan, lies on the further side, after another rise has been negotiated on an elevation in a narrow^ valley, which pro ects towards Khafr on the right, and towards the direction of Mai nland on the left. Badinjan is a large and prosperous village belonging, with the next, Behjun, to NasIr-ul-Kulk. From Badln an there is a path to Bab Anar (Khafr) about 40 miles, via Gudim and Ta Divan.

At 10 miles the well, Chah Pilleh, is passed, and thence to the top of the ridge connecting the two mountains is another mile. From Jarmasht the road runs all round the base of tfyo Kuh-i- Gurm, until almost opposite J armasht again, where it strives p$ in N.-W. direction towards the high mountain behind Mai nland. In front of the ridge the ground is fairly level, and thence to Maimand the direction is nearly due W. At about 3 miles beyond the ridge two sedentary tribes, the Turkeslu and GunakI are encamped. The road slopes gently down towards the plain of Maimand which is situated at the foot of a conical hill. Maimand consists of 3 villages. UliyS a nd Sufla (otherwise called Deh Bala and Deh Pain) and Shabankareh, and is famous for its rose-gardens, producing all the rose-water exported from the S. It is a wakf of the foundation of the Shah Chiragh mosque in Shiraz. Behind Maimand rises the great wall of the Safidar mountain, and from 4—6 miles before reaching the town the entrance to the Atishgah pass, by which the alternative route to Jarmasht or Isfal proceeds, is seen in lowhills on the left con necting the Kuh-i-Gurm with the Safidar.

This is the shortest route to Firiizabad but entails climbing a mountain, and by reason of the slippery stone near the summit is very difficult and trying to horses, dhe better and more level route continues on straight a head to where it meets the road from Shiraz (coming from Khvajai) behind a continuation of the spurs of hills to the right. This route is called the Rah-i-Tang-ab, or Tang-6. The ascent of the Pashmeh is very steep for the first 3 miles, slippery roch occurring frecjuently, and giving no foothold. Tim top is reached at about 10 miles. For another mile there are tortuous undulations winding on the top of the hills, then a very difficult sharp descent over smooth rectangular stones sloping at an angle, and rendering the foothold difficult. This state of ground continues to within 1 mile of the bottom, where there is a ravine. From the base of theffiill to Firuzabad there are about 2 J miles of flat plain.

The road now follows the sides, of the hills on the right for about | a mile, and then runs through a deep ravine which evidently carries off the drainage of the hills, and plain beyond. From the top of the pass the track runs through some low hills, and over somewhat stony ground until the halting-place of Daraku is reached at 24 miles.

There are also numerous wells. The soil of this plain appears to be exceptionally good, richer than usual in Persia. At 6 miles, the Kaleh Karabulagh is reached. This is a sort of rallying place of the blank tents ; it consists of a large tower in the centre surrounded by four high w^ells flanked by towers ; in the space between the centre tower and the walls are one or two wells of good water. It belongs to the Quvvam-ul-Mulk. At 10J- miles the village at Akbarabad is passed, and at 13 miles, the village of Shash Deh is reached.

From here a stream runs along the side of the road, which has the same name as the village. At 7J miles, the village is crossed by a bridge which is of very primitive construction. At 81 miles, the bed of a river, about 80 yards across, is passed there is very little water in it. At miles, the village of Jallan is passed on the left of the road. The track now runs over the plain until the village of Isaiifaandagan is reached at 12 miles. This is a large and prosperous walled village, almost worthy of the name of a town; it contains 700 houses, with a population of 3,500. The village is about J a mile from main road, which runs nearly straight to Jalian.

The road throughout is an excellent one for pack transport, and very little labour would be required to render it fit for the passage of guns. This route would probably form a good align ment for a railway connecting Kirman with Shiraz via Bahrama- bad and Shahr-i-Babak. The road throughout runs through hilly country, but the hills are more or less detached, and there are no high passes to be crossed. Practically the only work required to render the route passable for wheeled artillery would be the removal of the rocks and stones from the Tang-i-Arsianjan. It may be mention ed, however, that carriages have been known to pass through the Tang even in its present condition. During the winter months the temperature frequently falls below zero and it was understood that the road is frequently affected by falls of snow. Water .—There is plenty of water along the route. It is generally obtained from streams of which there are plenty run ning down from the higher hills on either side of the road. Grazing .—There is plentiful supply of camel-grazing to be obtained en route, generally of low thorn plants. There is also a little grass here and there, and it is thought that during the spring there would probably be a considerable supply. . Fuel .—In some of the ndld beds there is a little tamarisk, but once Kaleh Khan is passed there are large supplies of dwarf oak. Supplies .—Except in the neighbouring of Sarchaun and Arsinjan there would be practically no supplies obtainable. At both these places there would probably be sufficient for a couple of battalions.

The db-ambdr is not to be relied upon for water, as it is sometimes dry; it is about 8 by 12 feet, and probably, when full, holds about 2 to 2 | feet of water, as the lowest step is about that distance from the bottom; The road broad, hard and good, continues across the desert to the Jcdrlz of Husainabad, at 14J miles ; here water can be obtained, a tunnel leading down to the water ; a bucket is necessary to obtain the water. This is one of a line of klrdzes, several of which cross the desert between the db-ambdr and Xurabad, v/hich is reached at 17f miles. The walled village of Nurahad stands amidst cultivation and walled gardens. There are 320 houses ; 1,290 inhabitants, 1,200 goats ; 240 cows. Water is good and plentiful from the Jcdriz. From Nurabad the road runs over the plain, on which stand several villages. It passes through some walled cultivation and over the five kdrlzes. At 22 J miles the road enters between some isolated limestone hills on the left and a red crag on the right of the road. On the hills to the left is a domed tower, known as the shrine of Darah Shah.

Leaving Shamsabad the road passes through cultivation and reaches the ruined and deserted village of Eaizabad, at 2 miles. Here a Jcdriz crosses the road, and this is the last place where water is obtainable before crossing the desert from Eaizabad over a barren plain for four miles to a ruined fort, where water is said to be procurable sometimes. Thence the road runs for Igi- miles over the plain, which is salt in places, and sandy in others, but generally gravelly. Here is an old fort where there is an ab-ambdr put no supplies; this place is reported to be a haunt of robbers. The ab-anubdr is about 8 feet b\ 24 and had four to five feet of water in it at the time of the report. The water is only fairly clear, and, judging by the state of the ground in the fort, very polluted. Eour and a half miles further on another ab-ambdr is reached; this is about ten feet square, and has very foul smelling water. At 31 miles the road drops into a ndld with cultivation on both sides; there is water in an irrigation channel at the side of the road, and also a line of kdriz. The road here is bad, but could be easily improved as far as Heh-i-Shir, which is reached at 32^ miles.

At 16| miles there is a small pound on the right of the road, the water which feeds it coming from a covered channel. The road from here crosses a spur and then runs down the valley with irregular hills on either side. The small village of Deh-Nau is entered at 19 miles, and the road, running along the right bank of a stream, reaches ’ Al'a.bad at 2*5 miles.

It then continues 1 down the' valley past a hill on the left, which commands it. Faizabad is passed, standing in the mouth of valley which runs into the one in which the road lies, and divided from it by low rugged hills. The road to Sanichi comes up this valley, and then, keeping under the hills to the N.-E., joins the Yazd road at about 14]- miles. A little further on an ab-ambar is passed on the right of the road. Some half a mile beyond this the road bifurcates, the right branch dropping intoi a deep w r ater-course which runs from the valley on the right, the left hand branch keeping to the left of the water for ! over one and three quarters of a mile, and then crossing it and rejoining the right-hand one. There is little to choose between the two roads, the descent in both cases being bad, though practicable for artillery and wheeled traffic. From the junction, the road runs on the N.-E. side of the valley under the hills to Earasheh at 18] miles. The latter isa mean little village with plentiful water and culti vation.

From here the road enters a narrow defile, at the far end of which commences the cultivation of Taft, a long straggling village on either side of a dry river bed. The road is passable for wheeled vehicles throughout.

Not more than one brigade with a proportion of other arms could me the road in one day. For the first four stages the road traverses fiat open country which is liable to become impassable for camels, and difficult for mules, after heavy rain. Then the road rises over 5 main passes which in winter may he Mocked for a week hi a time by snow. The route is passable by infantry and cavalry, but not by field artillery. Animals must move in single file over the passes, and in some place horses must be led. Riding camels have been taken along the road. Loads should ridie high on mules as projecting rooks interfere with them when low. Camels could he used at line of communication transport in dry weather on stages 2, 3, 4, 8 * 9, 12, 13, 14, and on stage 1 in dry weather after a week's work on the road by a battalion of pioneers. To make the whole road passable for laden camels the align ments would have to be altered on the passes, and it is estimated that each pass would occupy a double company of pioneers a week. To enable carts to be used a road would have to be made across the Mashileh (stage 1), and a complete re-alignment of the passes undertaken ; a six months’ task at least for one battalion of pioneers at each pass. There are five main passes, details of which will be found in the Gazetteer, Volume HI. ( 1 ) The Kutal-i-Mahi (stage 5), a very steep ascent of over 1,000 feet by a narrow broken track. (2) The Kutal-bKarnari} (stage 0), an ascent of 1,200 feet in about 2 miles, by a path which is too narrow to allow r laden mules to pass. (3) The Tang-i-Turkan (stage 7), a pass through a narrow: defile, over jagged boulders, with a steep descent. ( 4 ) The Kutal-i-Dukhtar (stage 10 ), a very steep climb of 1,400 feet up a paved staircase. ( 5 ) The Kutal-i-Pir Zan (stage 11), a distressing track with steep ascent and descent: rises to 7,400 feet. There is also the Mashileh, a strip of low-lying ground betw een Bushire and the mainland, about 12 miles broad, where, during the winter months, mules sink fetlock deep into the mud, and other transport could not move. Alternative routes .—Route No. 37 via Fmlzabad, 30 miles than the post road, ba* less serious obstacles, but is. Route. Ko. 59-- contd. considered less secure. This route is used by camel caravans, and could be made passable for wheeled transport. Route Xo 38 via Jireh. About the same length as the post road but it runs through less fertile and less inhabited districts. Alternative stops.—From Bushire to BorSzjun vm tehif. This entails a crossing by the boat, and avoids only a portion ol tlG From Kazarun to Dasht-i-Arian Abdui. This is much used by ™vans, and is about 4 miles shorter: it avoids the Kutal-i-Pir Zan, but crosses the same range by a pass aeocribed as difficult and dangerous for animals. \ T ]j, For landing places at Bushire see- Military Report on Persia, and for camping grounds, etc., there, see Military Report on Persia and Gazetteer, Volume III.

Route No. 59 — contd. route The number of mules available on the road varies con- tinually, and depends on the political atnat.on the security o[ the road and the general demand for tansport. In October mi there were about 1,500 working on the road ; in January 1912 there were about 3 , 000 . Kazarun and Borazjun are centres where mules can be hired. _ , Water—With the exception of Ahmadi, Kunar Takhteh, and Kamarij, water is good and sufficient for a brigade ana its transnort at all seasons. During the rainy season the above places also have sufficient, but in the hot weather the supply becomes practically nil, without special means of extracting it. At all stages the supply of water gradual y decreases during the summer and autumn, till rain begins to fall in November from which time it increases again, being at its greatest about ApnL^ near Busllire the water is rather brackish and new comers become seriously affected by drinking it. Norton tube pumps are recommended for the stages, where the supply is not from stream and by this means sufficient water for a Brigade could always be obtained ; also leather buckets and ropes are useful for drawing water from wells. , . ,?w Fuel is the greatest difficulty along the road, and is almost unobtainable in the first three stages. Further on a certain amount is procurable, mostly m the form of toman k bushes in the lower country, and dwarf oak m the hd , This latter form is very plentiful between Kazarun and Dasht-i- Arjan. Transport should be provided for carrying at least one dav’s supply, with a force. # y Gracing. —The grazing along the route is very scanty, many places having none whatever for horse, mule or camel. Bhoosa (chopped straw) is the only fodder available, and sufficient for 1,000 animals could be collected in the vicinity of all stages. Camel grazing is reported to be nil. „ . . , , Supplies. —With some difficulty supplies sufficient for a bat talion of Indian Infantry with transport would be procurable all along the route at any time of year. Large quantities of bar ey are to be obtained in Kazarun after the harvest m June ; also good supplies of rice, grain, vegetables and frmt. _imve-stock is found only in limited quantities as far as i^zarun; oui, a- Kazarun and onwards, with the exception of MianKutal, would be sufficient for a brigade at least.

Thence there is a constant descent down a ravine to 5 miles, where the road strikes a lateral ravine through which the DalakI river runs E. and W. Following the river on the left bank to about 7 miles, the road then crosses the river by a stone bridge of six arches, roadway 30 feet wide, paved with small stone blocks, in good repair. Then above the right bank, or in summer along the river bed to 8 miles. This first part of the road is a difficult defile and might require extensive piqueting. At 8 miles the ascent of the Kutal-i-Malu {see Gazetteer) begins. The track zigzags up in an almost due northerly ^direction, involv ing a rise of over 1,000 feet, which is very tiring for animals. About f of the way up there is a paved stairway, which should be avoided by taking a track to the right, this leads to the top of the first part of the pass, after which the track descends about 50 feet and then leads almost level up the stony bed of a ravine, for \ a mile. In this ravine there is a spring of good water. From here the final ascent of about 200 feet is very steep and difficult; at the top of the pass there is a tower and a tea-house. The ascent is about 3 miles, and occupies 2 to 3 hours. The remaining 4 miles of road is across a well-cultivated plain.

The rise of 1,200 feet is effected in about 2 miles, and the path is very steep and narrow, at top of first part of path is a tea-house from which road descends 30 feet to bed of a sulphur stream, and follows this up a gorge for about Ja mile, when final ascent of pass is made. From here the road leads through low hills, and, at miles 10 |, leaves main track and turns W. to Kamarij. Baggage animals in single file from mile 3| to 10. Animals should be watered before leaving the Shapur river. Kamarij, a village of about 800 inhabitants, lies in a valley with hills 600—800 feet high on three sides.

There is a ford on S. side of bridge, bad ap proaches, ford impassable immediately after rain. The road keeps along the left bank of the river, which commands the right bank. At 2 miles the river is left, and the route strikes across the valley, passing the village of Kaleh-Nau at 3| m. and making a short sharp ascent to a higher plateau at 4 m., where there is a good rear guard position for a force retiring on Shiraz. Thence the road gradually ascends with undulations to the summit of the Mulla Kurneh pass : at 10 miles, just before the pass, there is a small well of good perennial water on S. of road, difficult to find. The descent on far side is gradual over undulating stony ground, passing a spring at 11 J miles, to the ridge on which Burj-i-Deh Shaikh stands at 12 miles.

It then climbs a gorge running in a N.-W. direc tion, for the first half mile along the bed of a stream; but leaving it the track passes over steep and jagged rocks, making the ascent for animals difficult and dangerous, to 21 miles. From here the ascent is continued up a ravine covered with small oaks, the acorns of which are of great size and are used by the villagers for bread in lieu of flour. At 22 miles the summit of the Kaleh Abdul pass is reached, with a graveyard on its south ern slope. A very steep descent now ensues down a ravine in the mountain side, to 23 miles, followed by a switchback descent to a small spring at 24 miles, a drop of some 1,500 feet altogether. The track now points N.-JV. again, and ascends gradually through a broken valley covered with rocks intersected by deep water-courses, to 26 miles. The top of the ridge overlooking the Dasht-i-Arjan is now reached, and following the lower con tour of the hills along the W. side of the valley the track strikes the road from the Mian Kutal just before the springs are reach ed. This alternative route is largely used by the tribesmen and their flocks and herds in their bi-annual migrations.

The route is passable for all arms including artillery as far as Asupas (3); thence it is only passable by mules as far as the last stage from Shahpur to Kazarun—which is again passable for all arms. The chief difficulties of the road are:— (1) the pass in stage 2 ; this is blocked by snow in winter ; (2) two bad passes in stage 5 ; (3) stage 7 is difficult and is only passable by troops in single file ; (4) the Gudar-i-Tabar Khaneh in stage 11 is imprac ticable for laden mules, and is only passable with difficulty for un laden animals. As there was snow on the pass in June it is probable that the pass is blocked in winter. There is also another dangerous bit of road in this stage, in passing which care must be taken to avoid accidents. Water. —Good and plentiful throughout.

The hills ahead and rocky and rise abruptly from the plain. At 3| miles the road enters the bed of the Shahpur river and crosses it twice by fords. It is a fine, clear, rapidly flowing stream of fresh water and full of fish. The road runs down the stream bed amongst high bushes and stretches of grass. At 4f miles pass through the Tang-i-Chakan, a gorge 50 yards in breadth with precipitous rocky hills on either side. These hills from an abrupt precipice to the S. and sloping steeply up from the X. are accessible from that side. Road on through a valley.

Epitome. This is the main caravan route between Shiraz and Isfahan. It runs with comparatively slight difference in altitude across the lofty plateau of Central Persia, the lowest point being 5,000 feet and the highest 8,000 feet. In winter owing to the cold the journey is a formidable undertaking. The caravan and the post road are not identical for the whole of the way the post road often making detours to avoid places unfit for carriage. The following are the chdpar-khanehs in order along the route. They were reported in 1912 as being in ruins. The caravanserais are generally in good repair, capacity one squadron. 1. Shiraz. 13. 2. Baj-gah. 14. 3. Zarghun. 15. 4. Amirbabad. 16. 5. Puzeh-i-Takht-i-Jamshl. 17. 6. Saidun. 18. 7. Quvvamabad. 19. 8. Sa’adatabad, 20. 9. Kulshur. 21. 10. Qadrabad. 22. 11. Hajladad. 22. 12. Dehbld. 24.

The road can be used for wheeled artillery and transport except from Quvamabad to Dehbld, which section is avoided by a detour branching off a little beyond the former place, and rejoining the route near Dehbld. Motors have done the journey in 3 days. The first section of the road as far as Quvvamabad is ex tremely rough for wheeled traffic but not impassable, being used by the post carriages. From Zarghun to Quvvamabad during the winter and spring and there is usually deep heavy mud, but for the rest of the year it offers no obstacle. The direct road between Quvvamabad and Dehbld is only fit for mules and camels, and it would require extensive blasting operations to render it fit for wheeled traffic. The alternative route is how ever used by carriages. The remanining section between Dehbld and Isfahan is an excellent road over a gravelly plain with very few bad places. The fords across the Pulvar river become impassable for two or three days at a time in. wet321 r Route No. §5~contd. weather and in winter. The Kul-i-Kush pass is sometimes blocked by snow for two or three months at a time in winter. In this case caravans branch off and go round by Hanashk, rejoining the main road at Khan-i-Khurreh, The physical obstacles are not of very great importance, so far as pack transport is concerned in ordinary seasons, but in connection with wheeled transport the following may benoted : — (i) Stage 1. —Rough and steep gradients over the N’al Shikan and the Gardan-i-Zarghun. These two passes, on account of their stony nature require a large amount of labour to convert them into an easy road for wheels, but at the same time a certain amount of improvement would be effected by the removal of the larger rocks from the track. (ii) Stage 3. —Ford across the Pulvar river, at the end of the Tang-i-Slvand. The ford is bad even for pack animals, but it is avoided by the detour to the E. which leaves the caravan route at Sivand. (iii) Stage 4. —The Tang-i-BulaghI, vide text of route. The road could only be widened here by extensive blasting. (iv) Stage 5. —The road is narrow and bad between miles 5 and 7 ascending over sharp jagged rocks. This m would require a considerable amount of labour to render it a good road. The road is narrow and bad in the descent to Khan-i-Kurgun. From the information at present available it is difficult to esti mate the amount of labour that would be required to improve this bit. Difficulties Nos. (ii), (iii) and (iv) are all avoided by the detour to the E. (vide end of route), but, at the same time, on account of the scantiness of the information, it is impossible to judge of the exact nature of the difficulties to be met with, and the probable amount for labour required to improve it. (r) Stage 6. —The road is narrow and bad in descent to Khan-i-Khurreh. This point would probably require much labour to make it into an easy road. (vi) Stage 10. —The descent into the Yazd-i-Khast ravine is dangerous for carriages or guns. As the banks of the ravine consist of conglomerate rock it would probably not be possible to construct a ramp down Cl(w)GSB - 2 i;322 • Route No. 65'— into it without a large expenditure of labour. This crossing, and the village of Yazd-i-Khast, can be avoided by a detour crosses the ravine 3 to 6 miles to the E. of Yazd-i-Khast, by which Amlnabad is made the halting place, but information does not appear to show that the crossing is so much better than that at Yazd-i-Khast, and it has the disadvantage of making the stage at least 12 miles longer. {vii) Stages 4, 5 and 6 are dangerous, on account of snow in winter months. ISote .—The road is comparatively secure for travellers, if armed, the most insecure, portion being that between Shiraz and Dehbid and from Abad to Maqsud Bagi, when Turkish tribes are about in summer. The winter is fairly mild though on the passes there are often heavy falls of snow between December and March. At times there are heavy falls of rain which affect the passability of the road. In summer, although there is rarely excessive heat the mid-summer months are hot, and it would be inadvisable to march large bodies of troops between the hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. The plain between Zarghun and Pul-i-Khan during the summer months and up to the time of the autumn rains is infested with a small fly knowm as the Khas Mayas. This finds its way into the nostrills of animals and the quietest of animals becomes most voilent in their efforts to get rid of it. At Sivand and Murghab there is invariably fever during the summer and autumn. Animal sickness also prevails and often causes the abandonment of certain portions of the road for a time. Water. —Water good and abundant at stages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12. Water good but limited at stages 6, 9, 11, and 13. ^ Water brackish or of poor quality at stage 14. Up to Dehbid water is obtained on the march from streams. In stages 6, 7 and 10, no water en route ; in stage 11 only at Aminabad ; in stages 9, 12 and 14 probably only obtainable at one or two villages or from the canal in stage 9 : in stage 13 only in the first half of the march ; and in stage 8 no difficulty. Fuel. —From Shiraz to Sivand, particularly over the Marv- dasht, fuel is scarce near the road and timely notice should be necessary to collect it in large quantities at any particular point. Thence to Dehbid a fair amount within easy distance of the road and plentiful in the Tang-i-Bulaghi. The gardens round Surmaq and in the villages on from there to Abadeh would furnish a plentiful supply. Very scarce from Abadeh to Yazd-i-Khast, but at the latter place a very plentiful supply from the gardens. Qumisheh and the villages round obtain wood from the fruit gardens and from the east side O' the mountains separating this portion of the country from the desert. From Qumisheh to Isfahan very scarce.323 Route No. §5—contd. Fodder.—From April to the end of June good grazing for all animals from Shiraz to Dehbld. Camels find their own fodder for eight months and are fed from December to April. The Arab tribesmen find grazing for extensive flocks from May to September. Beyond Dehbid no information. Supplies .—The country depends entirely on its own resources for the ordinary necessaries of life, and the passage of a large force through it, drawing on the country, would in most places result in a famine. At Shiraz and Isfahan supplies for a division for some time. At stages 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 12, for a regiment, with transport, and perhaps a larger force. At stages 10 and 11, for half a battalion with transport. At stages 4, 5, 6, 9, 13 and 14 for practically nil. The Meshed-Murghab district is a great grain-growing coun try : any year following a good harvest the supply of grain pro curable is abundant, even in mid-winter as transport is never available to take it away. The country round Dehbld is fertile, and although nothing can be procured in Dehbid itself, from the district near, certainly 100,000 maunds of grain would be pro curable. In this district the crops are harvested in the middle of August and further south somewhat earlier. Most of the villages on the route have flocks of sheep and goats of from 50 upwards and generally a few cows. At Murghab a hundred head of cattle might be procured at anytime. The larger towns, such as Shiraz, Abadeh, Qumisheh, and Isfahan could supply a certain amount of groceries. From calculations it is probable that 100,000 men and 25,000 animals moving between Shiraz and Dehbid could feed on the country without drawing on the food supply of the inhabitants. Beyond this towards Isfahan, the country is a poor one. In 1912 it was reported that at most stages supplies were scarce or nil and that cultiva tion was much less than formerly. Caravans consist of mules, camels, and donkeys. At Sivand in the spring 300 miles could be hired for transport and at other times only 50. Up to Dehbid practically none could be hired of bought. After notice at Qumisheh 2,000 donkeys could be obtained and at Mayar 2,000 camels. Donkeys are obtainable in most of the villages in small numbers. In summer muleteers load up soon after midnight and at other times they march during the day. Daily amount of feed for a mule 6 lbs. barley, 20 lbs. Ihusa. A recognized mule-loadRoute No. 65 - contd. is 280 lbs. but it is often much more. Facilities for shoeing practically nil. One or two indifferent smiths at Zarghun and Sivand with little material. Alternative stages .— (a) Fuzeh Zarghun to Kinareh. This route avoids the swampy portion of the Marvdasht plain, but lengthens the journey, and is impassable for wheeled traffic owing to the narrowness of the road in parts.

At 2 miles Shiraz is left by the Kuran gate, which is reached from the Consulate by two roads, one through the bazar and the avenue of Deh-i-Buzurg and the other skirting round the city by the Bank garden. The two roads join hear the gate way and near the road to the Bagh-i-Dilkusha. The latter road is hot as broad as the former, but it avoids a high backed river bridge crossed by it, and is ordinarily followed by carriages go ng to the Bagh-i-Nau. The road then runs throuh the Tang-i-Allah-u-Akbar, a narrow ravine with the mountain of Murtaza ’All, on which is the well of the same name, rising abruptly on the right, and the Babakuh on the left or west. The road is led along the side of the latter. The mountains are impracticable except for infantry and mountain batteries. At 3 miles a spring of good w^ater, the Ab-i-Zangi, is passed about half a mile to the east of the road. From the top of the ascent from the gateway the road for about 300 yards crosses uneven sheet rock, and two carriages could hardly pass between the precipitous rock on one side and the low boundary wall of the ravine on the other. At 3| miles a small domed325 Route No. 65— contd. building, the Ambar-i-Chauzi, said to contain water, lies on the left of the road. The road here is frequently broken by w'ater- ooarses, but is passable for wheeled traffic. It then runs between two rocks, and is only 12 feet wide and very bad and stony. At 4 miles the hills begin to open out and the telegraph line crosses the road from left to right. At 4-| miles pass Yakhchal, the ice pits, and eight houses with some vine cultiva tion. At 4| miles the Ab-i-Ruknl crosses the road, which then follows the stream to Gumbad-i-Sabz. Water is excellent and plentiful the whole way. At 6 miles is the village of Akbarabad, where there is a caravanserai ; 40 horses ; crops - wheat and barley 98,000 lbs. The road now runs across more open country, but rough and stony, with some patches of rock, and passes a small weir diverting a portion of the stream from the right to the left of the road ; here it feeds a small tank from which an irrigation channel runs to the cultivation beyond. The country round here is stony, affording in the autumn a little camel grazing, which becomes more plentiful in the spring. At 7|- miles the entrance of the Barnii pass is reached ; the road hete is very bad. At 8 miles the hills on the right recede slightly affording a small camping ground on the banks of the stream much used by caravans and nomads. This point lies about 800 feet higher than the Kuran gate. The road continues up the pass and at 84 miles reaches Gumbad-i-Sabz, which consists of 20 mad houses, occupied by road lufangchis. No supplies are obtainable here ; the water-supply is perennial, good, and plenti ful from the Ab-i-RuknT. At 9 miles the carriage road branches off to the left. The caravan route keeps straight on, and, cross ing tho kutal just above this point, rejoins the carriage road on the other side near the foot of the mountain. The post road, at 9| miles, running between the spurs from the mountains on either side, narrows to 15 feet, but opens out again at once, and, turning to the right, climbs the Gardan-i-Na’l Shikan, or Bamfo with an average slope of 4 or 5. The gardan is reached at 9§ miles, about 300 feet higher than the camping-ground at Gum bad-i-Sabz. The slope of the first part of the descent is 8, steepening to 10 or about 15 yards. The road follws a nald between the mountains, and is just passable for wheels; gun's would have to be man-handled down. At 10 miles the telegraph again crosses the road. At 10| miles the road turns to the left and fesUmes its original direction, having descended 325 feet in326 Route No. §5—-canid. 1,000 yards, and passes the caravanserai of Bagah. This is apost stage for carriages and post fourgons ; it is generally called 12 miles from Shiraz. The caravanserai is a stone and cement building lined inside with burnt bricks, blocking the pass, and affording a strong defensive post except against guns. In 1912 however^ it was reported to be in ruins. Stabling for 200 horses, 12 road tvfangchis. Supplies nil. Water is obtainable from a small spring about 18 inches wide by a few inches deep ; it is sweet and clear, and is collected into a tank some 11 feet square, for irrigation purposes ; animals can be watered at the tank. Good grazing in summer for all animals and for camels all year. Fuel plentiful obtained from Kuh-i-Bamu. The road now runs across the Bajgah plain, in wdiich there is a little cultivation and sparse grazing: in winter the going here is very muddy aid heavy. At 12 miles the ascent of the Kutal-i-Zarghun com mences. (Blackman says he believes that the proper name of the pass is the Gardaneh-i-Ab Barik). The average slope of the ascent is from 4 to 5. The top is reached at 12|- miles. The descent is very rough and bad but is fit for wheeled transport. For the first 1,300 yards the average fall is one in 15, but the slope is not constant, and is in many places very steep. Car riages have the choice of two roads, which divide at the top of the pass, and joins again in the valley at the foot of the moun tain. The road gradually descending continues down the valley to 13 f miles ; here the valley is about a half mile wide, but opens out to the S.-E. At 14 miles a line of Mm&amp;s crosses the road, and a quarter of a mile further on is a qavehhhdnah with steps leading down into an opening in the Mm, from which good and abundant water is to be obtained perennially. Twx&gt; hundred yards further on the stream emerges from the kdriz and runs down the valley : its banks are low and animals can be watered without any difficulty. The road now undulates over spurs from the hills on the left, the ground on the right falling away to the water course of the valley. At 17J miles the village of Dudak is passed about one mile on the right. At 19f miles a road to the left runs direct to the Puzeh Zarghun, avoiding the village of that name and shortening the dis tance to the Marvdasht plain by one mile. This road is suitable for animals and is followed by the telegraph line. At this point the mountains on the left cease. The post road continues over level country through cultivation to the large village of Zarghun—800 houses. The telegraph line is withinRoute No. 65 — contd. sight of the road the whole way. The post road runs right through the bazar. There is a post house and horse stage here. Zarghun is a large unwalled village with ch dparkk an eh and cara vanserai, both in very bad repair. The outer walls of the houses are loopholed and are well adapted for defence. One hundred goats. Two hundred ponies. This is the most difficult stage for vehicles on the Shiraz- o Isfahan route. Tactically it permits of an army operating from the N. opposing a force moving out from Shiraz. The Kutal-i-Gumbad- i-Sabz and 'Kutal-i-zar particularly afford distinctly strong positions. Route No. 47 connects here. Camping ground .— Unlimited but liable to inundation. Water .-— Plentiful. Supplies. — 1 Wheat and barley 700,000 lbs. Meat supply plentiful in spring and summer, scarce in winter months. Two years’ grain invariably stored here. 2 PI IN ARE IT .. 18| m. General direction N.- — 5,600'. E. Leaving Zarghun 391 m. the road runs N.- W. for one mile, with the mountains rising abruptly on the right, and cultivation on the left, to the Puzeh-i-Zarghun, where it enters the Marvdasht plain. At the Puzeh is a well of good perennial water and a qdvedtkhdneh. The short cut from the last stage which avoids Zarghun rejoins the post road here. At the Puzeh the road bifurcates. One road follows the line of the mountains to the Band Amir, where it crosses the river of that name, vide alternative stage {a). The other, which is the post road, runs N.-E. across the Marvdasht plain to the bridge of Pul-i-Khan. The former road is used by caravans in winter when the plain to the S. of the river is swampy in places. The post road runs across the Marvdasht plain. The mountains turn to the N.-E. and bound the plain on that side. Cultivation continues on both sides of the road for a few hundred yards, when the road again bifurcates. The right hand track, which is used in dry weather, cuts off a considerable corner. The main road continues on until it reaches the first of a series of eight causeways, II feet broad, and in bad repair, where it bears to the right. The causeway is known as the Pul-i-Khurdeh. By these causeways the road is led across the marshy ground which is formed here by rain328 Route No. 65—confcZ. in wet weather; they are in a wretchedly dilapidated state. The two tracks join each other on approaching the bridge of Pul-i-Khan which is reached at miles. About a hundred yards before reaching the bridge, the road turns sharp to the left round the end of a rocky ridge which here rises from the plain, and runs N.-W. parallel to the river, commanding the bridge and its approaches from either side. The approach to the bridge between the river and the ridge is over boulders and bare rocks, and at right angles to it. The roadway of the bridge is stone paved and only 12| feet wide. The bridge has a very steep pitch up to and down from the crown, the slope from the right bank being 9 and that down to the left bank 12. Much delay to troops and transport would have to be allowed for as certain to occur here. The bridge is of stone with three arches, the curves of which are of brick ; height of central one above normal flow 16 feet. The pa rapet is three feet high. The river, though elsewhere slug gish, here runs strongly. The fall from the Puzeh Zarghun to the river bank is only 75 feet. Leaving the bridge the road runs through a cutting for 250 yards, on the left of which the Pulvar river flows, at this point slowly, 25 feet wide with banks 20 feet high. The Pulvar river, which joins the Band-i-Amir above the bridge, bends in towards the road here. From cutting the road runs across the plain, which, on this side of the river, is much cultivated, and intersected with numerous irrigation channels. At 11 miles reach Amlrabad, which is a changing post for horses. The caravan track leaves Amirabad about 1J miles to the left, and continues N.-E. to 17-J miles, where a branch road runs to the village of Kinareh 1J miles distant. This village is generally used as a halting place by travellers. The post waggons, however, usually follow the main road to the chdpdrkhdneh at Puzeh-Takht-i-Jamshld. The road continues over the level plain and crosses the deep irrigation canal which supplies Kinareh with water by a wood and mud bridge, unfit for heavy traffic. It is made of six 15-feet poplar poles covered with reeds and mud. Kinareh and ’Aliabad are practically one village, about 300 mud houses. There is a walled garden to the west in which is a bald Jchaneh. Five hundred goats ; 60 cws. Donkeys 500. The average length of the stage from the previous reports is 20 miles. The road at this stage is level throughout, and in dry weather presents no obstacle to the ordinary rate of marching except329 Route No. ifo—contd. as noted at the Pul-i-Khan. In wet weather the road being unmetalled becomes heavy, and transport and artillery would be delayed. S. of the Band-i-Amir river the plain also becomes marshy in wet weather, and impassable for traffic except by the causevmys. The flood may possibly take 5 or 6 days to subside during which time the road is impassable. Troops could move across the plain anywhere in dry weather, but N. of the river the numerous irrigation channels would compel artillery and wheeled transport to move by the road. The Band-’ -Amir river flowing from N.-W. to S.-E.,cuts the Marvdasht plain in two, and offers a line of resistance at which to oppose the advance from or on, Shxaz. The hills on the south side of the river and commanding the Band -i-Amir and Pulvar crossing especially offer a position to obstruct the advance of a force from the N. Route No. 21 connects here.

As the road approaches the Piizeh, it is ioiiied bv the direct road, which avoids Kinarch, but they separate again at the ford. The post road keeps under the hills to the east of the river, vide alternative stage. The ford is 30 yards wide, and 2 feet deep, with a gravelly bottom. The breadth and depth depend on the season of the year and on the amount of the rainfall. The descent dowm to, and ascent from, the ford are fair, but would require slight repair in places for guns and wheeled transport; the spade work w^ould be easy* The road now' enters the plain of Khafrak. At 3J miles the tract turns N.-W. and soon after again meets the river, and runs above it at a height of 30 feet for some 200 yards* The track here is only eight feet wide in places, wdth low' mounts on the left. The road then leaves the river and runs through cultivation to Hajlabad, which is reached at 6J miles. Throughout the last mile it is bounded on the left by a deep irrigation channel passable at frequent places for laden mules and donkeys. There is one ford across it and tw r o bridges of mud and logs, the latter being only 3 feet wide. The numerous irrigation channels around 3 SI V AND 16 m. General direction N.-E. by N.

Hajlabad is a mud walled village ; population (?); 200 cows ; 100 goats ; 100 donkeys. Barley, wheat, and bhum available after harvest time for half a brigade, the supply de creasing as the year advances. Water from numerous irrigation channels, good,.plentiful, and perennial. The road now crosses the plain, which is under cultivation, to the mountains bounding it on the N. It then turns to the right and runs under them to the Puzeh at the entrance to the Slvand valley. This portion of the road is stony and bad. The mountains are naked rock, in many places unclimbable, in all difficult. Half-way a small village is passed under the mountains, deserted in summer. A quarter of a mile further on the shrine and village of imdmzddeh are passed 350 yards to the right of the road. The road then turns the Puzeh and runs W. of N. across a small plain down the Slvand valley to the ford at the village of Dashtabad ; a small village with few supplies, except, perhaps, just after the harvest. The track at this corner is very narrow, passing between a deep irrigation channel on the right, and another at the foot of the mountains to the left. Delay to transport would occur here, and it would be most difficult to construct a carriage road owing to the difficult nature of the ground. The ford at Dasht abad is, in summer, about 1J feet deep, with a gravelly bottom. The approaches on either side are very bad. The ford is danger ous when the river is flooded, one or two accidents having happened during late years. On the right bank, or Dashtabad s de, a deep irrigation channel has first to be crossed by a narrow bridge of earth and logs ; the track then turns along the bank of the irrigation channel, with a drop to the bed of the river on its right. From the bank it descends steeply to the ford. The ascent on the Sivand side is steep, and a small irrigation channel has to be crossed at the top. Here the caravan route rejoins the post road. From this point a fairly good road undulates down the N.-E. side of the valley, the mountains sending down a succession of spurs which form deep bays between them. On the left the ground falls gently to the river, which runs for the greater part of its course down the centre of the valley and under the mountains on the far side. The valley, which is about a mile broad, is bounded on both sides by mountains, those on the S.-W. being precipitous In the latter part of the stage the road runs through cultivation, bounded by an irrigation channel on thet 331 Route No. 65—contd. left. A block to transport would be likely to occur at the village where the road is narrow and enclosed by houses. The village is built on the slopes of the high rocky hills which bound the valley, and is the headquarters of many of the charvadars who work on this section of the road. Houses 500. Six hundred goats ; 100 cows, 500 mules. A telegraph building, containing 3 good rooms and ample out-houses with &amp; farrasJi in charge, has telephonic communication to Shiraz to the S. and Dehbid to the N. From Puzeh-Takht-i-Jamshid where it leaves the post road, to Dashtabad, the road is a sandy track, presenting no obstacle for pack animals, except as noted. From the ford to Sivand the road is fair and fit for the passage of all arms. The fords over the Pulvar river are sometimes impassable for three or four days at a time in wet weather.

General direction N.-E. ■ From Sivand the 79J m. road continues N.-E., up the valley bounded on either side by precipitous moun tains. Gradually narrowing at miles, the valley turns to the N.-E., the road at the same place crossing the river by a ford. The approach on the Sivand side is bad, since an irrigation chan nel crossed by a log and mud bridge runs parallel with the river ; the ascent on the Qavamabad side is fair. The crossing itself is bad, and in flood time a ford some 150 yards lower down is used, or sometimes a ford higher up the river is used, which is reached by keeping to the right under the mountains and past the ruined masonry bridge by which the river was formerly crossed. All three fords are in winter sometimes impassable for a day or two at a time. The ford is commanded by an amphitheatre of mountains on the Qavamabad side, while the approach from that place is similarly commanded by those on the Sivand side. Beyond this the road is 24 feet wide, where the going is fair over sandy ground, although cut in places by waZas running down to the river. The route lies in an easterly direction up the valley332 Route No. 65— eondd. which is flanked by high rocky mountains to Quvvama which is reached at 6 miles. This village as enclosed with hag a walls having brick towers, and its only gateway faces b. i-nmec «- ^telv in front of the gardens, also walled, of the Qavvam-ul-Mulk. There is a spacious caravanserai in a good state of repair, and a chavdrkha Jeh, to the W. of the village. Water is good and the supply is practically inexhaustible from an irrigation channel Ld the river but if drinking water be drawn from the former at a point to the E. of the village Anhnate should be watered at the river. Fifty houses, popula ton 250. Supplies scarce. The road here turns N.-K between the cam- Srai and the chuparkUneh and then turning W again runs at the foot of the high mountains forming the northern bounaary of the valley, which, from the ford, has opened out affording, except where cultivated, camel and goat-grazing. _ An aherna- ti V e road from the village runs parallel to tne mam road for a distance of some two miles rejoining it at the gardens or Quv- viimabad These gardens, situated on the right of ohe main road, are watered by an irrigation channel brought from the river, li e channel also working a mill in the gardens. The water is good and plentiful. The banks of the river where it runs along side the road, being only a few inches above tne water, affords an excellent place for watering transport ammaK Leaving the gardens the villages of Rahatabad and \ akdabad are to be Been about one and a half to two miles away to the right front across the Qalilak plain, into which the valley opens out. Ivo miles beyond the gardens the road turns R.-E. round a spur o : le mountains and enters a narrow valley covered with a thm jungle of thorn trees, down which flows the Pulvar river. The post road and caravan track here divide, the former turmng S -L. just inside the mouth of the valley, runs iw Sa adatabad, and re-, oins the caravan track 8 mile S. of Dehbid alternative). The vsllev now gradually narrows until it reaches a tower at the entrance to a narrow gorge, known a, the Tang. • TTaman The road then winds to the leit and runs a ong a track on the face of the hill with the river on its right. The nassaae is very bad and quite impassable for guns or wheel ed transport. This point could only be improved by blast- ina and it would involve much delay for a force of any size. After winding right and again left, the road runs down a broad valley for two and a quarter miles, when another difficult passage333 Route No. §h—contd. between the river and a spur of the hills is encountered, the pas sage of which would involve further delay for the passage of troops. From here the road continues for about a mile and a half commanded by mountains on both sides, after which the valley through which the road runs makes a right angled turn to the left. The road at the point where this turn is made is difficult. From this point on to the plain of Mashhad-i-Murghab the road runs through a gorge known as the Tang-i-Bulakai, which has a width of from 200 to 600 yards, flanked by perpendicular cliffis in } laces. Blackman says that from May until October the whole of this gorge is infested with gadflies to such an extent that he has frequently seen animals coming out of it dripping wdth blood. During this period it is only possible to travel with comfort at night. At two miles further on the road passes through a narrow gallery cut in the rock overhanging the river, which flow's through the rough gorge on the right of the road; this gallery is too narrow for w heeled transport. An alternative track can here be taken by descending into the bed of the river and fording the stream instead of entering the gallery. Subsequently the river is forded a second time, the two tracks reuniting at the entrance! on to the Mashhad-i-Murghab plain. This river route is impassable when the river is at ail in flood. Beyond the gallery the gorge begins to open out, and the river, as it emerges from the gorge into the plain, turns nearly at right angles along the mountains forming its western boundary. The gallery route, keeping under the mountains on the left, crosses a small ndld and emerges on to the plain, where it is rejoined by the alternative track from across the stream. The united road then runs across the plain to the small village of Takht-i-Madar-Sulaiman, near which, on the left of the road, stands the ancient sarcopha gus, reputed to be the tomb of the mother of Solomon, or, accord ing to modern authorities, the tomb of Cyrus the Great. Con tinuing over the plain the road passes the ruins of Pasargardae, and then ascends a low r ridge with a steep ascent, where some diffi culty might be experienced by guns or wheeled transport. Descending the far side of the ridge Deh-i-Nau is reached, a small village situated in the angle of some low r hills. The telegraph line runs within sight of the road the whole way from Sivand, and is here about a quarter of a mile to the W. of the village. The village is unwalled, and Consists of about 50 mud houses wdth a population of some 150. The road from Quvvamabad is fair,334 Route No. 65 — contd. though sandy and in places stony, the only obstacles being those noted in the route. From Quvvamabad to the Tang-i-Kamln the road continues fair, but from this on, as noted in the route, it is in places impassable for wheeled traffic. Across the Meshed- Murghab plain the road, though fair in good weather, is sandy and would become bad with much traffic, and in wet weather the going would be heavy. Troops, having crossed the river Pulvar between Sivand and Quvvamabad, would not be confined to the road, except in the tangis and narrower parts of the valley. There is excellent water in reach of the road throughout the march, and the Kaman and Bulakai defiles furnish ample supplies of fuel. The road is good except at the few points noted where it passes through the defiles. W ater. —Plentiful. Fuel —Fuel is obtained from the Kuh-fiBur-yardi, two farsaJchs to the S.-W.

There are a few goats and sheep. a low gardan at the foot of which it bears to the JST., and after crossing the plain for a short distance, enters between some low hills. The road to Meshhad-i-Murghab leaves the caravan route after the gardan is crossed, and runs N.-E. to that village from which it leads to the phenomenal spring of Bannu, and there rejoins the present caravan route. The latter road, emerging from between the low hills, gradually ascends across a waterless, hummocky, sandy plain. At 4| miles the direction becomes slightly west of N. , and still ascending, runs along a broken valley with hills on the left (W.), and a long range on the right till a pass is reached at 5J miles. The pass is winding and difficult, and the road a mere track, narrow and bad. It is flanked by low hills, and in a couple of places is impassable for artillery and wheeled transport. Light guns, however, might possibly be hauled over by hand. Blasting would have to be resorted to in order to effect an improvement in the road at these points. The top of the pass is reached at 7^ miles, the road here being very bad and narrow. Beyond the top of the pass the road 5 DEHBID 29 m. General dire :tion N.-N.- 7,500'. 108J m. W. Leaving Deh-i- Nau the road crosses335 Route No. 65 — contd. presents no difficulties as far asthe junction with the Meshhad-i- Murghab road at 8J miles. From this point, however, there is a very stiff ascent winding between low hills, and over sharp and slippery rocks, to the top of another pass, which is reached at a little over 9J miles. Two tracks lead down the descent, one which leads straight on very bad and very difficult to im prove ; the other branching off to the left along the telegraph line, is also very bad and rocky, but could be improved with considerable labour. Both tracks unite again about 600 yards beyond the foot of the descent, the one which kept straight on from the kutal, having made a left-handed turn, and followed the dry water-course at the foot of the pass. The road along the valley is fairly good, though very stony in places; it is bounded on the nght (E.) at some 200 to 400 yards, by a range of mountains between which and the road is a dry water-course. On the left the country is more open, but is broken by low isolated hills, and by spurs from the main ridge at a distance of over 4,000 yards. The road keeps along the valley, but gradually ascending till it reaches the foot of the Jcutal, beyond which the road leads down on to the plain on which is situated the caravanserai of Khan-i- Khurghan. The ascent of the kutal is stony but passable for all arms ; the top is reached at 12J miles. For the first mile and a hall the descent lies between two ranges, 200 yards apart. The road is stony and in places so rocky as to be, in its present condition, impassable for wheeled traffic. The descent is steep with an extremely nasty right-handed turn, and neither descent nor turn can be avoided. To improve it sufficiently to admit of the passage of guns and wheeled traffic would probably necessitate a day’s work by a battalion of Pioneers. At ISf- miles the track bifurcates, uniting again on the plain at the bot tom of the pass. There is little to choose either in condition or distance between these two tracks. The road then runs K-N.-W. across the plain to the bridge of Khan-i-Khurghan, a distance of just under a mile. The road from the foot of the pass runs along some 400 yards from the foot of the mountains on the left (S.W.). The ground is somewhat broken on the right, but all arms could move over the plain situated between the road and the mountains on the left. The road crosses the river by a high-backed bridge of five arches. The road way of the bridge is stone-paved, 21 feet wide and 72 yards long. The approach on the Khan-i-Khurghan side is cut by an irrigation channel336 Route No. 65—conYcZ. running parallel with the river, crossed l\y u log ano niud bridge. There is also a ford above the bridge. The stream is about 15 yards wide and about a foot deep. The v/atei rises ^m v, iiitei and the river is at times unfordable foi a day at a time. Xhe caravanserai, a stone building, is in very bad repair, and the village lies to the right of the rand, some 200 and 400 yards, respectively, from the bridge. Tnere are a iew goats, but no other supplies. On leaving the bridge the i oad runs througn cultivation to a small stream, a few inches deep, crossed be a masonry foot-bridge, just beyond whicn, a mile from Khan-i- Khurghan bridge, a short ascent leads ro the upper plain. ^ rho road here is bad, crossing several ndids, anci slight!\ ascending, ft continues across the plain to 21-|- miles, where the present carriage road, which runs via Sa adatabad [vide alternati v e stage] joins it from the S.-K Just abo\e the junction a small spring of good water, which howe\ or contains leeches, . feeds an irrigation channel crossing tire road. Tne lattei, sti-J ascending and fairly good though stony and broken by ndids, . reaches the top of the ridges enclosing the Dehbid plateau on the S., at 26 miles. This forms the second line of a strong position ' commanding the approach from Khan-i-Ivhuighan, the first line being the outlying range of low hills, a mile and three- . quarters further S. through which the road has run. The descent to Dehbid by an excellent road is easy, and cultivation on either side of the road begins almost immediately after leaving the kutal. The last mile is almost level. A tributary of the Pulvar is crosed ]ust before arriving at Deho d, whicn is rea^hcci at 29 miles. Dehbid is the name of a group of seven villages, of which Daulatabad, where the telegraph station, caravanserai and chdpdrkhdneh are situated, is usually kno n as Debbie. The caramnsarai consists of a new and large stone building. The post horses are kept at the chdpdrJchdneh. There are also telegraph buildings where the Inspector of the Abadeh-Shiraz Section of the telegraph line lives. There is telephone communi cation S. with Sivand and Shiraz, and K. with Abadeh and Isfahan. The village consists of mud hovels, without doors or windows, occupied in the winter months only. There is no live-stock. Possibly 150 donkeys might be collected from the surrounding villages. Route i\o. 54 connects here. Camping ground. —Unlimited. Water. —Plentiful.337 Route No. 65 — contd.

No supplies ; good water from a Jcariz. Still crossing rising ground ; the road, at 3f miles, reaches the first of the spurs from the foot of the mountain on the left (W.), which here stretches far out into the plain. After crossing the undulat ing ground formed by these spurs, the road continues over barren undulating country up a valley between low hills, till, at 10 miles, it crosses a low gar dan with a ruined lufangchis' tower on the right of the road. Descending, the road runs to the Qull Kush pass, the top of which is reached at 11 miles. The ascent is bad, the road in places running over naked rock and loose stones. The descent from the pass on the north side is steep and difficult. The road, which is very bad and broken, follows the bed of a ndld, with hills rising steeply on either side, until just before the Kuh-i-Jangl is reached at 14f miles. Leaving the ndld, the road keeping the Kuh-i-Jangl on the right (E.), runs over the lower slopes of the mountains on the left, crossing seve ral dry ndlds with bad descends and ascents. From this point, the ground on the right becomes more open. The walled hamlet of Khan-i-Khurreh is reached at 19 miles. Khan-i-Khurreh is a small hamlet of four or five houses with a walled garden to the W. There is a very fine stone caravanserai in good repair, the upper parapet of which is loopholed. There is also a qdvehlclidneh&gt; a separate stone building alongside the caravanserai, and a chdpdrkhdneh where post horses can be obtained. The Tele graph Department have a reserved rest-room with a peon in charge in the caravanserai. There are a few goats. The road, although all arms could use it, is generally bad and stony. In 1913 Hart reported the going as good. No water along the road in this stage. The ascent and descent of the Quli Kush, especial ly the latter, would delay traffic, and the road down the ndld on the northern side of the pass, though used by the post waggon, is little more than a track.

On the left are low hummocky hills with spurs and undulations lying in front of a steep rocky range to which they afterwards give place. In the first four miles the road, which is gradually descending, crosses seven shallow water-courses, running from left to right. At 5 miles the telegraph line, which up to this point has been on the left of the road, crosses to the right. Three-quarters of a mile further on, an isolated hillock is passed, followed by a second on the left of the road. At just over 8|- miles, the telegraph line again crosses the road, and remains on the left as far as Surmaq. Two more isolated hillocks are then passed on the left. The roaa now runs under the Kuh-i-Changan on the right (N.-N.-E.) of the plain. From this point to the 19th mile the plain is narrowed by a series of rocky ridges running on the right parallel to the road, and situated between the latter and the main chain of mountains previously bounding the plain on that side. A curi ous line of low isolated rocky hillocks stretches here to the left across the plain. For the next four and a half miles the descent is steeper. The road continues under the rocky ridge, till at about 15J miles it passes a hill on its left which continues for about a mile. The ridge on the right now ceases, disclosing another ridge behind some 1,000 yards distant (this is not the main ridge bounding the valley), also running roughly parallel to the road. As the hill on the left ends, the rocky ridges on the right commences again. At 18 miles the last of the ridges on the right is passed, and the plain opens out to a considerable extent. The road continues to ascend slightly until Surmaq is reached at 24 miles. Faizabad and other villages, lying under the hills to the right, through which the road to Abrquh passes, are seen as the last ridge is cleared.

For the first 3 miles the valley on the left (S.-W.) is dotted with stony hillocks. To the right (N.-E.), as far as the village of Gaskun, are villages, gardens and cultivation. Guskun is situated about a third of a mile to the right of the road at the end of the first mile. The mountains bounding the valley on the N.-E. are about a mile away at this point. At 2J- miles is the first of the gardens of Aminabad, some 200 yards to the right of the road, which, another mile further on, enters between the walled gardens and cultivation S.-E. of that village. The road runs between walls for nearly half a mile, crossing the irrigation chan nel which irrigated the gardens, with a plentiful supply of water. In getting clear of the walls, the walled village is seen lying some 250 yards to the left. At 5 J miles Bidak, standing amongst gardens, is passed on the right of the road about half a mile distant, and at 6 miles is Yaqubabad, with its walled gardens right and left of the road stretching across the valley. Husain- abad, on the right of the road, surrounded by walled gardens and cultivation, is reached at 9 miles. At 11J miles are the ruins of Daulatabad, and, further on, standing amongst gardens, under the hills to the N.-E., is Dahdak.

After skirting the last garden, the road runs across a plain, there being, for the next three miles, a certain amount (not continuous) of cultivation on either side of it, and at first some gardens behind the 5 cultivation on the right, while on the left a series of low isolated hillocks at varying distances command the road. At 5J miles a large walled enclosure with flanking bastions, and two bastions, one on each side of the gateway, is passed on the right of the road. A walled building occupied by ivfangchis and known as the Rurj-i-Qaravul, is passed, also on the right of the road, at just over 8J- miles. The water of the Icariz here is said to be too salt to drink, and drinking water is, the tnfangciiis say, carried from the irrigated cultivation a thousand yards to the W. This cultivation is surrounded by a wall, and inside it341 Route No. 65 — contd. there is reported to he a spring of good water. The plain on the right is bounded by low rocky hills, and a high mountain lies to the W. From here the road continues to the gardens of Shul- gistan at 17| miles. The gardens are walled and watered by an irrigation channel. The plain to the W. would afford a suitable camping ground. Shulgistan is reached at just over 18f miles. The village is mud-walled, towers at the four corners. The population is 500. Livestock 5,000 goats ; 100 cows. There is a chdpdrJchaneh, where post horses can be obtained, and a stone- built caravanserai with towers at the corners not in a good state of repair ; both are situated outside the village. For the first three miles through the gardens of Abadeh, the road is mainly a lane between mud walls. Once clear of it the gardens, is broad, hard and good to Shulgistan and there is nothing to interfere with the usual rate of marching; troops could move on either side of the road. Water is plentiful up to the last garden of Abadeh, and also at the gardens of Shulgistan. The water at the tufangchis' Burj-i-Qaiavul is as noted in the description of the route. Camping ground. —Unlimited. Water. —Water is obtained from the gandfs coming out of the ground opposite to the caravanserai. The supply is perennial and abundant, but the ground round is so foul that the quality of the water is doubtful. A new entrance above the place where the present channel issues from the ground should be made. Supplies. —Practically nil. 10 YAZD-I-KHAST .. 20 m. General direction N.- 7,300. W. The road, broad 205 and good, runs over a barren plain across which troops could move in any direction. At about 8J miles the direct road to Amlnabad branches off to the right running in a N.-N. easterly direction. At 10 miles a infangchis' tower is passed on the left of the road with a very deep well, the water of which although slightly brackish is drinkable. From here, still crossing the plain bounded on the left by high mountains, which finally turn sharply to the W., road reaches the edge of the cliff of the Yazd-i-Khast ravine at 19J miles. The ravine, from 300 to 400 yards broad, cuts the plain in two and the banks here are literally perpendicular cliffs of conglo merate. The bottom of the ravine, which is level and cultivated.342 Route No. 65— contd. is Ojljoiitj 150 fool below tbo surrounding pl&amp;in. Tbe country in the neighbourhood of the r&lt;iviiio is undunlting und its fold would afford cover if necessary to troops advancing across the plain. These folds are not sufficiently steep to interfere with traffic on the road, but troops moving across the plain might in places have to alter direction in order to avoid them. The descent into the ravine is very steep, running down the face of the cliff to the bottom. At the foot of the descent it keeps under the cliff, above the right bank of the stream, which flows down the valley, until the caravanserai is reached at 20 miles. The village of Yazd-i-Khast occupies the whole of the summit of a conglomerate spur running out from the northern cliffs of the ravine for a distance of some 300 yards, its walls rising straight from the perpendicular sides of the spur. The town is now nealry deserted, the majority of the inhabitants occupy ing the new town built on the S.-W. side of the gate of the old town. A shallow ditch at the foot of the walls, crossed by a bridge of logs and mud, has been cut across the spur to the ravine on the north-western side of the spur up which side the road runs. The only entrance to the village is across this bridge. The population 2,500. Livestock 3,000 goats ; 100 cows. With the exception of a few donkeys there are no transport animals. There is a stone caravanserai on the S. side of the ravine, and a chdpdrkhdneh on the N. side, where post-horses are obtain able. Camping ground. —Ample. Water. —Plentiful.

Leaving the 227k m. caravanserai the road crosses the stream by a bridge, which, though broken, can still be used by transport animals and men. The stream below the bridge is about a foot deep with a gravel bottom, and is said by the inhabitants, probably truly, to be always fordable. The road then crosses the bed of the ravine, here about 450 yards broad, by a raised causeway to the foot of the spur on which the village stands. Here on the right (E.) of the road in the chdpdrkhdneh. The road turns sharp to the left round the spur, running up the ravine between it and the bank of the343 Route No. 65—conid. nala. The ascent, though steep and stony, is passable for all arms. At the top of the ravine the road turns to the right (N.) and, getting clear of the buildings at once, runs past a mosque on the plain. The track is here 38 yards broad, and is pass able for all arms, as also is the plain on either side. At 1 mile is a triangle of hills known as the Tal Balai, about 400 yards distant on the left of the road which it commands, as also the surrounding country. A little further on the road, sinking between two banks, narrows to 12 feet, but the plain on either side is available for the passage of all arms, and no delay to traffic would in consequence be involved. From this point to the junction with the ShCilgistan road the track is narrower. At 2-J- miles the end of the last hill forming the triangle is passed, and the road continues across the plain gradually descending till, at 6f miles, the iufangchis' tower known as Gard-i-Gir is passed on the left of the road ; here there is a well of slightly brackish, but drinkable, water. The road then crosses a dry water channel, the Rud Khaneh Gard-i-Gir, and ascending passes between the low gravel hills, known as the Tal-i-Gard-i- Gir, at miles. The direct road from Shulgistan, wffiich left the road S. of the tufartigchis 7 tower, between that place and Yazd-i-Khast, here comes in again on the right at the top of the rise. The road continues across the undulating plain to the village of Aminabad at 12 miles. The village, with walls and houses of mud, stands 'amidst cultivation. There are 200 inha bitants. Livestock—1,000 goats ; 60 cows. Supplies suffi cient for half a battalion and its transport at harvest time. Probably a few donkeys might be obtained as transport animals. Fuel is scarce. Water is brought a distance of some 6 farsakhs from the mountains by a kariz. The supply is perennial, abun dant, and good. There is a masonry caravanserai, lately rebuilt (1906), outside the village with a water tank in front of it; also a chdpdrkhdneh where post-horses can be obtained. The road to Maqsud Begi leads past the chdpdrkhdneh. All arms could move in any direction over the plain on either side of the road. At 21 miles, some ruins are passed, and the village of Bagh Surkh lying some half a mile to the left. Half a mile further on the caravanserai, a mud building in a bad state of repair, of Mira bad is reached, the village from w hich it takes its name being off the road to the E. From here the road continues through cultivation to the village of Maqsud Begi, at 22J miles.344 Route No. 65 — conld. situated one hundred yards to the left of the road. Maqsud Begi is a walled village said to have some 1,200 inhabi tants. There is a guest-house for important travellers : a caravanserai in bad repair and a chdpdrkhdneh, all on the right (E.) of the road opposite to the village. Livestock—300 goats, 70 cows. Probably a few donkeys would be the only transport animals available. Except at the village of Aminabad and on approaching the village of Maqsud Begi, the road, broad and good, runs across the plain. It gradually descends the whole way, except at the Tal-i-Gard-i-Gir. There is nothing to interfere with the usual rate of marching. All arms could move across the plain on either side of the track if necessary. Water. —The water-supply is good and perennial from a qandt: there is also an db-ambdr with good water at the northern corner of the guest-house.

Begi caravanserai the road runs N.-N.-W., the village lying 100 yards to the left. An alternative route (vide alternative routes) branches to the left here, skirting the village and running via Khashareh, to within three-quarters of a mile of Qumisheh, where it rejoins the post road. The road is broad and good, with a plain on the right and gardens, cultivation, and level ground on the left. On the right the plain is bounded by a high range of rocky moun tains some mile and a half away, which gradually get nearer the road as it approaches Qumisheh. Continuing over similar country, Dahak is passed on the left (W.) at 3| miles. At 5| miles the mill of Sular is passed, the village of that name lying a mile and a quarter to the W.-S.-W. The broken walls round the cultivation confine the road on the left about half a mile further on, and continue for a mile when another mill is passed. The road from the mill, broad and good, though furrowed in places by water-courses from the hills, runs to 12^ miles, where it bifurcates, one branch running to Qumisheh, the other ikeeping N. under the hills. The former, turning more to the west over the plain, crosses, after another half mile, the ndld which has been from 500 to 200 yards on the W. of the road since leaving Sular and which has turned N; the bridge ofRoute No. (56- -contd. stone, 3 arches, 6 yards broad, and 65 yards long, with no parapet. The roadway is 15 feet above the nald bed. Fields and cultivation are now on either side of the road. At 13£ miles the alternative road from Maqsud Beg! rejoins, and a deep Icarlz, where delay to traffic may be expected, is crossed by a narrow earth causeway. There is a camping ground here and to the E. of the town where water is plentiful. The road, about 20 feet wide, now winds between banks and walls, or is sunk below the level of the cultivation on either ^ide. A quarter of a mile further on, a stone bridge of one arch, 3£ yards broad and 17 yards long, leads across another nald with perpendicular banks, and the gate of the town is reached at 14| miles. The telegraph line crosses the road at the second bridge and runs N. outside the walls of the town. There is no other means of crossing the second ndld except by the bridge, and there is no ford and no possibility of making one without great labour, as the banks are perpendicular and some 15 feet high. A turning from the branch road also leads to the town. Qumisheh is a large walled town, the seat of a governor, with bazars, caravanserais, chdpdrkhdneh, where post-horses can be obtained, and a telegraph house with good rest-rooms, with a peon in charge. Telephone communication with Abadeh and Isfahan. There are a considerable number of goats (5,000), 700 cows and bullocks ; 2,000 donkeys* The road from Maqsud Begl to Qumisheh, except at the points mentioned in the route, presents no obstacle to interfere with the usual rate of marching., The track is broad and good, and all arms could move over the plain to the right (E.) of the road.

The ndld can also be crossed by a very steep track which, however, could not be used by wheeled transport or guns. There is an awkward turn to the right on leaving the bridge on the X. side. A quarter of a mile further on a second ndld is crossed by a bridge, also of stone, w ith one elliptical arch, the crown of which is of brick. The roadway is 5| yards broad ; 16 feet above the ndld bed ; and the parapet is 2 feet high. Delay in transport would occur at both bridges. There is an db-ambdr on the W. of the road. The road from the bridge continues through cultivation till, at 11 miles, it skirts the jpuzeh oi the mountain on its left (W.) and then passes through the graveyard of Qumisheh, situated on its lower slope. The road, which up to this point has been dusty, narrow, and indifferent, and which would become very bad with much traffic, here widens to 9 yards and the going improves. At 1| miles the road passes between the buildings of the tomb and hamlet of Shah Riza. Adjoining the tomb, which is on the W. of the road, pilgrim caravanserai standing well back. The village contains 400 Houses. Telegraph line crosses from the E. to W. From here until the chdpdrlchdneh of Aslab Ohah is reached, there is no water to be obtained close to the road, which continues through cultivation for some dis tance. At 3J miles the road to Isfahan, vid Ispeh and Nasrabad, branches off to the right front. The road now enters a broad plain, bounded by mountains. All arms could move across the plain, though it is somewhat broken by ndtds. On the left the ground slopes up to the rocky mountains. At 7 miles the village of Ispeh is passed ; about a mile to the right (E.) At a little over 8 miles a dry water-course, running from the moun tains, crosses the track. This forms no obstacle at the road or to the left of it, but might interfere with the movement of guns at places to the right. At 9 miles there is cultivation on the right, about 20 yards aw^ay.

Here is a mill and a plentiful supply of water. The mill shaft is 10 yards in circumference, and is said by the miller to be 40 feet deep ; this is kept full of water from the Mm, which also has an overflow channel with a stream of rapidly- flowing water 3 inches deep and 1 foot wide. Supplies practically Post-horses obtainable. The chdpdrkcineh has jlist been rebuilt (October 1906) and. has half a dozen small rooms for -travellers. From here the road continues N.-N.-W. across-the plain, com manded by a low rocky range on the N.-N.-E. Three-quarters of a mile further on a low gravel hill at an angle of about 45° rises on the left and commands the road ; isolated rocky ridges, some 3,000 yards to the left, lie about half-way between it and’ the main range of mountains bounding the plain on the N.-W. The road is broad and good, much wet would make it soft, but it dries quickly. At 13J miles a conical hill rising from the plain is passed, 1,300 yards to the N.-N.-E. The Mm which supplies Aslab Chah issuing from the ground forms a stream flowing towards Mehiar at varying distances from the road, its course being clearly marked by the trees growing along it. ’ At 14J miles the last of the isolated ridges on the left ends. At 18J miles an irrigation channel crosses the road, and the fruit gardens of Mehiar lie just beyond it to the left.

A rocky range on the left (S.-W.) and an isolated mountain on the right (N.-E.) from the mouth of the valley in which Mehiar is situated. The road skirts the wall of the village, and then rims down the valley, for a distance of nearly two and a quarter milesRoute No. 65 — contd. from the caravanserai, when the end of the rocky spur in which it finishes is passed. The mountain can be climbed here, and men could move along the top to the S.-E. end, which commands the . approach to Mehlar from Asiab Ghah. The telegraph line is close on the left of the road to which it has crossed from the right, and Continues along the road to the Urchin pass, when it follows the caravan track across the kutal. The valley is now very broad (5 to 7 miles—Arbuthnot), and the road runs through a shallow cutting lower than the surrounding country, but the ground on cither side is fit for the passage of all arms. At 3f a shallow ndld is crossed, which ends on the left side of the road. This ndld might interfere with the movement of guns across country, as in places they might have to change direction in order to cross it. A little more than a quarter of a mile further on there is a ruined mud building on the left of the road, and the ruined caravanserai deserted burj, and chdpdrkhdneh of Ahmadabad are reached at 6f miles. (The desertion of the village is believed to have been due to the water of the well having be come brackish). The chdpdrkhdneh where post-horses can be obtained of Ghah Ismail is passed at a little over 11 miles. Here there is a well of good water fed by a kdriz which becomes muddy after rain. The mountains, on the right. (E.) have now approach* ed the road to within about 500 yards. From the chdpdrkhdneh the road begins to ascend gradually; at 12 miles a spur from the hills on the right comes down to the road, which three-quar ters of a mile further on bends to the right and enters the Urchin pass. Sharply ascending, the road runs between rocky hills, the sides of which are for the most part perpendicular but climb- able in places up an occasional spur or water channel. After the pass is entered there is a hundred yards of stony level ground on either side of the road, a road which runs from the W. and comes in under the mountains bounding the northern side of the entrance of the pass, joins the post road. The caravan route and telegraph line branch left (N.-N.-W.) at 13 miles up a small valley, and fhen crossing the ridge to the N. rejoin the post road which runs row by the pass. Wheeled artillery should follow the post road. The Kutal-i-Urchin thus crossed is very steep. &lt; Quns, however, might; possibly be man-handled over with great difficulty. Maj or Arbuthnot consides it as impractic able. Three-quarters of a mile further on the pass narrows to a Talley, down whieh runs a dry .water-course. ^11 movement isRoute No. 65 — contd. confined to the road, which is only 12 feet wide. At 15 miles the water-course turns to the left, and the road keeping straight on ascends it still between hills which come down on either side until a low gardan is crossed. The road just after beginning to wind round the mountain where there is a very nasty bit of ground, the bare rock coming through the soil. The road enters a level valley, about 400 yards wide, bounded on the right by three isolated conical hills, with another valley behind them. At the third hill a dry water-course is crossed. At the top of the short rise on the far side the valley continues at a higher level. The hills on the right are now about a hundred yards away, and on the left 400, the latter being low and broken. All arms could move across the plain here. At 15J miles the caravan route and the telegraph line, which have run over the Kutal-i-Urcbln on the left and then along this valley, under the hills rejoins the post-road which continues to 17 miles , when the mountains on the right turn half-right and run N.-N.-E. away from the road. A level plain is now entered, and 1,000 yards further on, a long rocky spur from the mountains on the left is passed. From here the road, running broad and good, reaches the chdpdrkhdneh at 21 miles. Post-horses are obtained here. The road is indifferent from the caravanserai of Mehlar to the village, then good, except where noted, to the Urchin Pass where the narrow valley is en tered, it becomes stony and indifferent. From the level valley to the chdpdrkhdneh the road is broad and good. AH arms can move across the plain which for the greater part of the way bounds the road on either side, but are confined to the road in the Urchin Pass.

Leaving the 296 m. chdpdrkhdneh at Marq the road continues across the plain, which on the right (N.-E.) of the road is marshy and impassable in spring, but which is said to be passable for the rest of the year. The road soon becomes a mere track, but troops would not be greatly impeded as the plain is fairly level, and fairly good going, and the marshy land men tioned does not run up to the road. On the left the plain is bounded by high rocky mountains, which at 1J miles turnRoute No. 65 — coritd. abruptly to the W. flanking a broad valley which runs into a plain at right angles to it. All arms can move across the plain between the road and the mountains. At l£ miles the road becomes broad and good again, and at 2f miles the telegraph line crosses it from right to left and runs to the left front (N. W.) over the plain to a low off-shot of the Kuh-i-Sufeh, which it crosses. It then continues across the plain on the other (northen) side, on which Isfahan stands, to the river ; this is crossed by the bridge as the Pul-i-’Ali-Vardi Khan, and so enters the city. Three tracks running across the plain lead from the post road to Kaleh Shur. The last of these, the one at the foot of the hills, being the Isfahan-Kaleh Shur road. These three tracts cannot be used in spring when the plain is swamy. The hills are en tered at 4i miles, and all movement, except for infantry and mountain guns, is confined to the road, by the low hills on either side of it, which ascends gradually to the gardan of Azar Durar. The ascent is easy, but at places the road narrows to 12 feet, and delay would be certain if traffic was not carefully regulated. The descent commences at once. An db-ambdr is passed on the left of the road, soon after leaving the gardan, the water of which is plentiful and said to be good. The road runs between low hills similar to those confining the road during the ascent. Half-way down there is a spring of water rising under a brick canopy form- ing a small pool, which affords a good watering place for animals, dust before the foot of the pass is reached, a hdriz containing water is crossed. From the foot of the pass the road runs across the plain to the cemetery of Isfahan, from where a broad road leads to the city, entering it by the bridge of Shah ’Abbas. The road, except for the ascent and descent of the low spur of the Kuh-i-Sufeh crossed by the gardan of Azar Durar, runs across the plains the whole way. Leaving the caravanserai of Marcj it is a good broad road, but it shortly becomes a mere track.

At half mile a march comes up to the road on the left. The marsh is roughly a mile long and half a mile broad ; in summer it is two-thirds dry, but along the road it is wet and reedy. In the wet season the whole marsh is full of water. A well is reached at If miles, containing good water. A small hital over the spur from the mountains is crossed, the road over which is too narrow for wheeled artillery. Another well is passed at 4| miles. The water is good ; a bucket and rope are required. The village of Band Amir is reached at 8^ miles. There are 300 houses, 10 percent, of which are of masoniry. In habitants 1,570 ; goats 300; cows 150; dbnkeys 8 ; mules 6; there are 25 water mills which can grind 100 maunds per diem.

The road gradually changes its direction from S. of E. to E.-N.- E.,.and* at 8J miles, turns to the left and bears N.-N.-W. Just beyond this a branch road runs to the right to the village of Said fin, where post horses can be obtained. Fair supplies.353 Route No. 65 — contd. The road continues from here to the ford at Basht-i-Bal, passing the gardens of Saidun. The mountains which bound the STvand valley on the N.-E. gradually approach the road as it enters the Sivand valley from the plain, and, just before reaching the ford, the road runs close between them and the river bank. Before this point the road from Sivand followed by the post waggons branches off to the right rear. The caravan route crosses the Dasht-i-Bal ford and rejoins the post road at that point. From there onwards the road runs broad and good to Sivand, vide stage 3 of the mam route. The road from the chdpdrkhaneh to the Fuzeh by Takht-i-Taus is stony and undulating over the spurs from the mountains, from there across the plain to the gardens of Saidun, it is level (except for the drop into the river-bed). Though good, it is soft, and liable to become much cut up and heavy in bad weather or with much traffic. From the gardens, though narrow and bad where the mountains come down to the road, it is generally good. There is nothing to prevent all arms moving across the plain, to the right of the road, nor to the left, when it runs sufficiently far from the river between Takht-i-Taus and the gardens of Saidun.

The post waggons use this road and a road running parrallel to it, between the village and the garden of the Quvvam, indifferently. This latter road joins the main road at the gardens of Quvvamabad at 21 miles. The road then runs under the mountains till it reaches the shoulder at the entrance to the Sangbur iawgl just inside which the post road branches off nearly due S. The road then runs across the Cl(w)GSB.Route No. 65 — contd. Kalilak plain to the river Pulvar at 7 miles, which is forded by a fairly good track. The N. approach to the ford is not bad, but the southern ascent is steep and difficult, and delay to wheeled transport must be expected. The ford in summer has a width of 12 yards and depth of about feet; in winter it becomes* at times, impassable. The road from the ford goes to the village of Qursdasht, about f mile distant, from where a second road is said to run to Quvvamabad, crossing the river by a ford about half a mile below^ the other, and joining the main post-road between the Tangi Kamln and the gardens of Quvvamabad. Qursdasht consists of 100 houses inside walls. Goats 500, 80 cows. There would probably be barley and bhusd just after the harvest for one infantry regiment and two cavalry regiments. From Qursdasht the road runs E. across the plain, which is dotted with villages to the two towns side by side of Kalilak and Sa’adatabad. The road is a mere track across the plain, crossing two irrigation channels of some size by kutcha bridges of mud and logs, and fording a third. Kalilak consists of 100 houses, and Sa’adatabad a similar number ; both villages are walled and stand amidst large walled gardens. Sa’adatabad has a lofty but tressed fort. Goats 100, cows 200. Post horses are obtainable. The road is good from Quvvamabad to the Kamln Tangi, and fair from the latter to the river Pulvar, but it is a mere track onwards from Qursdasht to Sa’adatabad. Delay w'ould occur at the ascent from the ford over the Pulvar, and probably at the third irrigation channel, which could, when flooded, only be crossed at the ford. This portion of the route would get very heavy in wet weather. The water-supply is good and plentiful the whole way. Camping ground .—Unlimited but liable to inundation. Water .—Not very plentiful.

The heights on either side must be crowned; they are difficult, if not impassable to climb in many places from the tangi itself, especially at the eastern end. At exit tangi is about 40 yards wide. Water at the Sa’adatabad end is plenty from a kariz. Leaving the defile, which is over three and a half miles long, the road turns left (N.) to Khurshur across undulating open country, very soft and heavy in wet weather, commanded on the left by the range through which the Tang-i-Kamlm runs. Khurshur consists of a solid masonry ford, with a few huts standing amidst cultivation. Cows 40. Water. —Good.

The road runs 88J m. over a plain with stony hillocks, with one particularly bad ascent about half-way, a descent of 2 miles. The road is much firmer. No water *is obtainable after leaving Khurshur till the irrigation channel near Qadrabad is passed. The latter is a walled village with some 300 mud houses, a field of the Sani-ad-Dauleh.

The road runs 109-| m. to the foot of the hills across the plain, a mere track, over ploughed fields. The ascent begun 4 miles is stiff and there is a long pull up. The descent is steep, no regular track having been made over the gravelly soil strewn with stones. A stream is reached with a plentiful supply of water. The road descends ag^in and then runs across a plateau, and down a steep ascent to second stream at 17 miles which is about 8 feet wide and 3 inches deep, running swiftly ; this, as is the former stream, is a tributary of the Pulvar,356 Route No. 65 — contd. This part of the road, some 6 m,iles, would need considerable repairs before it would stand constant wheeled ^traffic, espe cially in the rainy season. The road to ’Abbasabad turns to the ripht at the foot of the descent. The post road, a mere track runs across the plain full of water after ram, and water bv a few irrigation channels, to Hajlabad.

About a mile before this junction there is a bad ascent from the level of the plain, on which Hajiabad stands; to the level above, which might be improved for wheeled transport, although IrrlteTpis along it in its present condition, but not at night. Close to the junction there is a bad bit of road with a drop into a ndld and a bad crossing. Immediately after this water-course is crossed the road drops into another dry water-course. The plain which, is crossed is commanded by the ridges at the top of the accent leading to the Debbld plateau. These ridges are fo’'ined by a double range andform a natural position. They extend across the road in two lines one and a half miles distant f rom each other; on the E. they make a wide sweep round to the flank,, but could be turned by the low-lying ground to the west.

The road crosses the low gardan of the hill in the angle of which Deh-i-Nau stands, and leaves the present caravan route at the foot of the descent on the far side. It then runs under a low hill, some 200 yards dis tant on the left, and, further on, between this and a low hill, on the right. It then enters the level cultivated plain in which Mashhad-i-Murghab stands. Irrigation channels bound the road, sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other, and sometimes on both to Mashhad-i-Murghab. They run in a deep bed or nald and can be crossed by infantry anywhere, cavalry in places, and by wheeled artillery not at all. Where they cross the road as they do two or three times ramps would have to be dug for artillery, as the bridges are only narrow timber and mud structures for pack animals. Troops could move across country except for the irrigation channels, which might in places stop artil lery. The plain is surrounded by low gravelly hills, across which, to the left of the road, the telegraph line runs. Mashhad-i Murghab is a mud-walled village of 400 mud houses. Inhabi tants 1,160.

There are three mills within half a mile of the village, which can grind 100 maunds of flour each in a day. From Meshed-i-Murghab the road runs to and crosses to Bannu stream. It then ascends and descends over hilly country to the place where this pheno menal spring rises. The road to the junction of the routes from here is stony, and in two places very bad indeed. Artillery would have to leave the road and go across country. At the first, the top of the ascent after leaving the spring, a road would have to be made ; at the second, by keeping to the water-course on the right of the road, guns might be got round the bad place. The junction is reached at 9J miles. From MAQSUD BEGI (Stage 11) to QUMISHEH (Stage 12). No. of stage and total distance. Details. 12 QUMISHEH .... The road runs from village down the valley and is 227J m. very bad. It is much enclosed between garden walls, and crosses cultivation intersected by irrigation channels. The route strikes off from the post road at Maqsud Begi and continues to run for a short distance further to the west, and then about parallel to that road. It first passes under the N. wall of Maqsud Begi and then runs across irrigated cultivation, and between walled gardens to Khasurah, where spade work would be necessary to make it fit for wheeled traffic. It then continues, first between walls and then over cultivation, to Dahak, round two sides of which it runs ; here again spade work would be required to fit it for wheeled traffic. Continuing it passes Massini on the right. From here it again requires spade work in many places, such as at the irrigation channels, to make it good for traffic. Another walled village is then passed. Afterwards the road becomes very narrow and has at first a wall on the right, being afterwards sunk between the surrounding cultivation. After crossing a stony piece of open ground it fords an irrigation channel which work a mill passed on the right. The road is here fair, with no359 Route No. 65 — contd . cultivation on the left. The walls of the garden of Sular next con fine the road, and the village of that name is reached surrounded by gardens. From here the road runs to Maran, being in places very bad, through enclosed country where spade work again could be necessary or guns would have to be man-handled. The walls of the cultivation of Quvvamabad are to be seen from here, across the ndld which runs between this and the post-road. The next section of the road is much broken by the banked irrigation channels which cross it: traffic would be difficult, if not impos sible, unless they wore cleared away. The village of Ziarat is reached through country which is still much enclosed, Dalandun having first been passed. On leaving the former a broad ndld is crossed, in which is cultivation. The road then runs sunk between the cultivation on either side, and here improves. The gardens and village of Vasbab are then reached and the road runs from there, first between walls, and then over cultivation, to the junction with the post-road a little over three-quarters of a mile from Qumisheh.

The route as far as Kushk-i-Zard is a caravan route for mules and camels during the summer months, April to September, and is used by the tribesmen during their migrations in spring and autumn. For the last two years caravan traffic over this route has much decreased owing to the insecurity prevalent thereon. The surveyor Sultan Muhammad, in February 1908, reports the number of horses in a good many villages to be from thirty to fifty more than the number given in this route. The usual caravan stages are :— 1. Zarghum 7. Kushk-i-Zard. 2. Fathabad. 8. Baba Shaikh Ahmad. 3. Main. 9. Qishlaq. 4. Imamzadeh-i-Ismail. 10. Hinijan. 5. Rlza Abad. 11. Sular. 6. Asupas. 12.

Kushk-i-Zard to Hinijan. Stages 7 to 10. About 71361 Route No. Q6—contd. 4. Hinijan to Qumisheh. Stage 12. About 15 miles. Section i, Shiraz to Hashimdbdd* This section presents no difficulties of any kind and is open for wheeled traffic throughout the year. It should^ however, be noted that the portion of the road on this section from the 2nd to 3rd mile of stage 2 (Zarghun-Fathabad), covered by the raised causeway known as Pul-i-Khurdeh and the surrounding swampy ground, frequently presents considerable difficulty for wheeled traffic and even, in abnormal seasons, for the passage of pack animals between the months of November and April. Section 2, Hdshimdbdd to Kushk-i-Zard. This section presents exceptional difficulties at certain parts,. .viz .— (а) The crossing of the river Khaneh Kirgan on approach ing Main from the south. See stage 2. (б) The Imam zade h - i - Is mail Pass. (e) The swampy ground at the approach to Kushk-i-Zard from Asupas. Section 3. Kusbk-i-Zard to Hinijdn. The difficulties in this section arise rather from lack of sup plies and from the absence of any clearly defined track or land marks over a large tract of almost entirely uninhabited upland. Patches of treacheroup^swampy ground which occur unexpectedly on portions of this section would also be the cause of additional difficulties. Section 4, Hinijdn to Qumisheh. This is a short section of about 15 miles where the presence of a swift mountain stream immediately bordering and at times encroaching on the first four miles of the track which here passes down a narrow ravine, presents obvious difficulties even in the summer months. Note .—It should be particularly noted that between Asupas on section 2 and Hinian on section 3 show, attaining at times a depth of one zar . 1 ®» according to native report, prevalent during the three winter months, i.e, BeCe The e approach'toThe Irish bridge across the river Khaneh Kirgan a few railes south ol Main, would have to be made practicable for wheeled traffic by P^eers. The chief feature remarked between April 27th to Ma&gt; 12th was the extremes of temperature in the twenty-four hours. The inhabitants at ^ushk-^£ard Isfarian and Qumisheh made ment on of excessive rams m the late autumn, m particular the excessive rainfall of the Matter part of December 1 ^ caused disastrous floods. At Asupas local report says that mosquito^ abound and fever is prevalent during the summer and autumn, also a hore^^ease known W SinehV'irw (pneumonia). The inhabitants added that the winters were so severe that it was impossible to keep sheep with profit.362 Route No. 66-— contd. Water .—Water is abundant all the year round throughout ; rivers, springs, wells, qanats, reservoirs. Fud. —Brushwood, e.g., camel-thorn, for fuel was abund- smt. Fuel from trees only obtainable in any quantity at certain stages. Fodder.—Gracing for camels and mules and horses plenti- ul throughout the seasons when the road is available. The presence of the noxious plant, euphorbia, was noted at Qishlaq. Supplies .—Grain supplies over the major portion of the road would present considerable difficulties. Live-stock is abundant at all times, more particularly in spring and autumn when the tribes are on the march. In cases of emergency a mounted force not exceeding 1,500 men and horses could be pushed through by this route, procuring their own supplies. It would be difficult or even impossible to send infantry by this route relying on the local supplies, which at certain stages^ e.g. y Baba Shaikh Ahmad, stage 8, and Qishlaq, stage 9, are nil. Kushk-i-Zard or the neighbouring village of Shahr Mian, see stage 8, Asupas and Hinijan appeared to be the most promising centers for collecting supplies but it was impossible to gauge the amount of supplies from native information. Wheat and barley are harvested from mid June to mid July according to altitude. Caravans using this route are composed of camels or mules. Donkeys, ponies and cows are used by the tribesmen. According to native information mule caravans using this route (i.e., Kushk-i-Zard or Yazd-i-Khast) vary from 100 to 2,000 mules, and camel caravans from 10 to 500 camels. The hire of mules varies greatly, but latterly has fluctuated from rupees 24 to 30 (Tcrans 80 to 100) from Shiraz to Isfahan. Muleteers usually shoe their own animals. No transport under ordinary circumstances available along this road. The usual allowance of forage given by muleteers to their mules is two Shiraz! maunds (i.e., 14*6 lbs.) of straw and 2J ShirazI maunds of barley (i.e., 18'2 lbs.).

The first 5J 32*4 m. miles of this stage, i.e., to just beyond Pul-i-Khan, lie over the postal road (see stage 2, Route No. 65). The road throughout this stage is a good level one, open to all arms except at one point about the 10th mile, where the approach to the Irish bridge over the Slvand river would require a few hours’ work to render it practicable for artillery. About 500 yards from the Pul-i-Khan the road bifurcates, the road to Eathabad branching off from the main road almost due N. The Marvdasht plain here forms a rectangle bounded on the S. by low bluffs, at the foot of which flows the river Pulvar, westward, by three great isolated masses of rock—Kuh-i-Sharaq, Kaleh Shikasteh and Mian Kaleh which rise like Titanic citadels out of the plain northward by the Kuh-i-Gharmabad rising above to Naqsh- i-Rustam. The fourth side is cut by the postal road to Puzeh. The eastern portion of this rectangle is copiously watered by the river Sivand and by artificial water channels drawn from it. The track and this river, after running parallel for a few hundred yards, separate, the course of the river being more to the W. At about 7 miles 4 furlongs the small village of ’Amarabad lying about a mile E. of the road is sighted and 2 or 3 miles westward the Imamzadeh-i-Daaz* deh Imam, conspicuous by its tall trees. At about 8 miles the road and river again converge. A small ndld is crossed. Shortly afterwards two paths join the track, one from Behbid, a village about 3 miles N.-N.-E., the other from Ahmadabad or ’Imadabad, and Hasanabad, villages lying respectively about 2 miles and 1 mile N.-W. At about 9 miles 2 furlongs the road, now trending N.-W., crosses a small streamlet and at 10 miles again strikes the main channels of the Sivand river, apparently an artificial channel, from about 18 to 20 yards broad with level banks, at a point where it is traversed by an Irish bridge partially ruined but practicable. At 9 miles 3 furlongs crossing another branch of the river by a small stone bridge the road deflects towards N.-N.-E. and, funning between the river on the E. and artificial water channel on the W., reaches at 12 miles 4 furlongs the village of Fat ha bad ; about 200 houses.

About 1 furlong it bifurcates, both branches, moving up the valley watered by the river Kur, lead to Mian via Hashimabad, near which village they unite. The route described is the more easterly of the two. It runs for the first 44 miles N.-N.-W. over a plain, partly cultivated, partly pasture-land. At about 4 furlongs a path branching off N.- N.-E. is said to lead to the village of Sarani. About 1 mile another path branching off northward leads to Garmabad. Just at this latter bifurcation a little Imamzadeh (Valian) stands on the left (west) side of the road. About 2 miles 4 furlongs a dry shallow river-bed. about 100 yards wide, is crossed and at 4 miles 4 furlongs the village of Khalidabad, is reached. Skirting round the W. side of this the road bifurcates at the N. W. corner of the village ; one branch running northward over somewhat swampy ground leads to a little Imdmzddeh (at 5 miles 4 furlongs) standing at the foot of the imposing mass of rock known as Kuh-i-Mlan Kaleh, and from there skirts the base of that mountain on the E. and N. The other, trending N.-N.-W., crosses a little stream by a bridge and, running under the western flank of the mountain, joins into the alternative road above-mentioned at Hashimabad. The former road is des cribed. For about 2 miles beyond the Imdmzddeh it continues to run about due N. passing over slightly undulating ground and crossing several small ndlds as it skirts the base of the isolated mass of rock above-mentioned. At about 7 miles 4 furlongs it bends slightly more to the W. and rounding the mountain reaches (at 9 miles) Mian Kaleh, a small village sur rounded by high mud walls, flanked by towers at each angle situated on a small sweep of level ground between the mass of rock above-mentioned, and another mass of a similar nature variously known as Kuh-i-Mallach and Kaleh Shikasteh. Here a path running at right angles to the road connects it on the W. with the already mentioned alternative road to Hashimabad and leads eastward towards Garmabad ; Mian Kaleh is said to contain about 300 mules. From Mian Kaleh the road, still moving9 Route No. %~~contd. N.-N.-W. and, passing round by the eastern slope of the Kuh- i-Mian Kaleh and by the western slope of high bluffs standing ' immediately E. of the road, ascends gradually to 11 miles (rising about 250 feet in 2 miles), then descending slightly reaches, about 12 miles, the little village of Bani Yaki, about 15 houses. Well of excellent water outside village at N.-E. angle. From Bani Yaki two roads run to Hashimabad, the more easterly hugging the base of the bluffs already mention ed all the way up the valley, the other moving almost parallel to and about 2 furlongs W. of it. Passing over level, partly cultivated land these two roads converge about 14 miles. About 2 furlongs further on the alternative road from Khalid- abad to Hashimabad is struck, the two roads merging into one. About 15 miles the latter village, a large, sq uare enclosure flanked with towers, standing 500 to 600 yards W. of the road is passed. Just beyond Hashimabad the river Kur, locally styled the Qain Piran river, which here runs parallel to and about 6 furlongs W. of the road, becomes visible. Both banks are very high and steep. Breadth of stream about 30 yards. The inhabitants assert that there is no means of crossing it here. The road continues to move up the valley between the river, 200 to 500 yards to the W., and the bluffs rising immediately on the E. The intervening strip of land affords summer pastures to the Shishbulki tribesmen. About 16 miles 2 furlongs the ruined village of Bariabad is sighted, standing about a mile distant on the W. bank of the river. At 16 miles 4 furlongs a small spring is passed on the W. and the road. About 17 miles the river and road almost converge and a project ing spur from the bluff on the E. strikes across the latter. Turn ing this and deflecting slightly more towards the N. the road runs for about 3 miles between a tributary branch of the Kur river on the W. side and a steep rocky bank on the immediate E. Several springlets trickle down at intervals from the high bank E. across the road and a streamlet is carried along a channel artificially cut in the rock. About 20 miles another rocky spur strikes from the E. into the road, which is further cut up at this point by several small watercourses, springs and scattered boulders. From this point there are two roads to Main. The one turning at right angles to the road hitherto followed strikes N.-N.-E., crosses a tributary stream (Rudkaneh-i-Khushk- i-Bihareh) which here flows towards the river Kur from the E. byRoute No. 66-—ccmfaZ. a ford, about 3 to 4 feet deep in May, and said to be shallower in summer, passes the village of Mazara situated about half a mile N. of the road and continuing N.-N.-E. reaches Main at about 24 miles 2 furlongs. The other road (known as the old road) turning N.-E. after rounding the projecting spur, follows the S. bank of the streamlet above-mentioned, which here is deep-set in a itala fringed with willows and bordered by patches of rich green sward. About 21 miles the road again invaded by w T ater from jubs and springs and strewn with boulders, becomes for the first time impracticable for artillery —in fact a considerable amount of pioneer (for wdhch material is locally at hand) would be required. At about 22 miles 2 furlongs the road is barred by deep water cuttings crossed by frail temporary bridges of faggots and mud wide enough for the passage of one animal only. About 200 yards further on the river is crossed by an Irish bridge about thirty yards long and twelve feet broad, stone paved (many stones displaced, footings for mules and horses somewhat treacherous). 1 Emerging on a level sweep of pasture land dotted with bushes and passing the village of Bld-i-GuI, stand ing about a mile W. of the road, the road reaches Main at about 24 miles 4 furlongs. Main is practically a ruined village, only fifteen houses being now inhabited. There is a ruined caravan serai which, in case of stress of weather, might afford shelter for a *regiment of cavalry.

The ravine to which this gateway gives access runs in a N.-W. direction and down it hows a shallow little river known at Imamzadeh as Khushk Rud-i-Bihareh. The width of the ravine throughout its course to Imamzadeh*i-Ismail varies from one to three miles. The road, w-hich is extremely stony and in places narrow vdth a sloping surface, unsuitable in its present condition for the passage of artillery but capable of being made practicable, runs more or less parallel to the river crossing it at 4 miles 4 furlongs and rising GOO feet in the course of about 10 miles.

Imanizadeh-i-Ismail due X., which general direction is maintained till the top of the pass (Gardaneh-i- Imamzadeh-i-Ismail) is reached, a distance oi about 5 miles 2 furlongs. The road and the river, or a streamlet diverted from it, are for the first mile or so nearly parallel, then the course of the latter lies more to the W. till it is seen to lose itself in a gorge in the mountainAwhich here, closing in from368 Route No. 66 — conid. the W. and E. round off the valley. For the first two miles ■the road is a good one and the gradient easy, but almost about the third mile the real ascent of the pass begins ; the gradient soon becomes steeper, averaging about 1 in 8 with portions of 1 in 3, and the road, strevm with boulders and protruding masses of rock, is impracticable for artillery. The top of the pass is marked by a ruined tower. The altitude is approxi mately 2,000 feet higher than that of Imamzadeh-i-Ismall. About 200 yards beyond the tower on the W. of the road is a reservoir of water said to be fed by the melting of the snows. The tribesmen (Shishbulki Qashqais) who use this route in their spring and autumn migrations assert that the supply of water in this reservoir never fails throughout the year. From this point the road runs 15° to the foot of the hills, a descent of about 700 feet in about 2 miles, and enters the Ujan valley bounded towards the N. by a range of high hills (still flecked with snow in May 1908). From the foot of the pass the road, de ecting to 63 degrees, runs towards Riza Abad, a small village standing on the N. bank of the river, locally known as the Ujan, but figuring as the river Kur on the maps. Riza Abad lies about 2 miles distant as the crow flies from the foot of the hills, but somewhat further up the road which, pass ing a short distance beyond the village along the S. bank of the river, turns sharply back. The river, which is here about 22 feet broad, is crossed diagonally by a shallow ford, the deepest part of which is about 2 feet. The village of Riza Abad (9J miles), half in ruins, is said to contain 30 or 40 families. It apparently possesses abundant supplies of water—2 qandts and several wells besides the river. From Riza Abad the road runs for 200 of 300 yards nearly due W., then turning almost at right angles moves due N. across the plain towards a ruined building, Lalagun. At 11 miles 3 furlongs, a qandt crossing the road pours out a streamlet of excellent water by the roadside on the W., At 12 miles Lalagun standing just off the W. side of the road is passed. Just beyond Lalagun another qandt flowing in the same direction traverses the road which from this point runs due N. for about 6 furlongs and then again deflects to the N.-W. At about 14 miles 4 furlongs on the E. side of the river and about 6 furlongs distant from the road stands the ruin of Ujan. iSo traces of its bridge (Pul-i-Ujan) were observed. The place is now' enthelyRoute No. 6G— contd. deserted and no longer forms, as it is reported to have done in days gone by, a stopping place for caravans.

General direction N.-W, ■ — 8,000k The caravan road is 98|- m. resumed at a point about 5 furlongs E. of Pul-i~Ujan and moves in an almost uniform direction N.-W. up the Ujan valley, which it traverses diagonally in its course trending away from the river and the mountains which bound the plain on the west, towards the Saiyid Muham mad range on the E., the skirt of which it hugs for the last two or three miles before reaching Asupas. The plain, which at Pul4- Ujun is about 4 miles broad, widens out gradually to about 7 miles at Asupas, disclosing the snow-covered range of the Padina mountains to the W. It presents an almost dead level stretch •of pasture land diversified here and there by patches of cultivation -and cut up in certain .portions by waf er channels or bits of marshy ground. These, as seen in May 1908, were not of a nature to impede the progress of any arm, but it is easily conceivable that in tlie spring time, or at or after the .melting of the snow, which according to native information sometimes lies more than three feet deep in the plain, the ground might prove diffieult. Some small portions of the plain in the neighbourhood of Pul-i- Ujan are cultivated bvShishbulki Qashqais, a few of whom have formed a little winter settlement at a snot on the skirt of the ' ' . JL *. eastern mountains, known as Ghashmeh-i-Duzdan, from a spring rising there and feeding a qanat (Qanat-i-Illahabad). About 7-J miles beyond Pul-i-Ujan is descried the little village of Ishkaft, standing on the W. bank of the river and about one mile further on, also on the W. bank of the river, the village of Hasanabad -(reported to contain about 100 to 150 houses, 2 mills -and 2 qandts), property of Basirl tribesmen, who cultivate opium here as well as lentils, pulse, wheat and barely.

Pehlvan, both forming part of Asupas, are sighted in the plain on the W. of the road, Pehlvan being at a distance of about 6 fur longs from it. At 10 miles % spring, Chashmeh-i-Salatin, bubbling Out on the W. of the road, marks a bifurcation, the main portion of the road usually followed by caravans running imme diately under the mountains, while a somewhat shorter grassy track leads over the plain to Asupas. The latter road is reported to be swampy and unfit for caravans at certain seasons of the year. At 14 miles 4 furlongs is the spring of Bahram Gur, W. of the road. The Ujan valley is' the meeting place of several roads. Thus from Maigun a road runs to Kam Flruz and Simaran, the summer headquarters of the Ilkhani of the Qashqais. At about 12 miles a road branching off from the caravan road runs in 8 miles to Ab-barik, in 24 miles to Iqlid, and in 44 miles to Abadeh, (Native information.) Route No. 64, Asupas consists of a small hillock crowned with a mud fort with mud dwellings clinging to it like swallows’ nests. The overflow of water from the “ Forty Springs ” form a kind of moat round the place. There is also a small stone-built tank [30 / x9 // x4 / ] about 500 yards to N.-E. of the village. There are also a couple of water mills, each capable of producing 20 maunds of flour in the 24 hours. There are said to be about 100 families, fifty yoke of oxen for ploughing, numerous cows, donkeys and mares. Sheep and goats are not kept, the long cold winters (sometimes three months, during which, according to native reports, snow lies in the village and on the plain) being adverse to these. The inhabitants cultivate wheat, barely (reaped about the end of June) and pulse. 7 KHUSHK-I-ZARD 21 m. General direction N, 8,850', The road leaving 119Jm, Ausp&amp;s in a N.-E, direction passes a mill on the E. and a small cemetery on the W. Near the latter the spring, “ Chehil Chashmeh,” flows out of the hillside. The road ascends very gradually to the top of the pass, 2 miles 2 furlongs (altitude 8,700 feet). A portion of the hillside is thickly tufted with fennel. There is a gradual descent into the plain. At 3 miles 2 furlongs a road runs eastwards to Abadeh, see stage 6. The plain, which at this point is about 5 miles broad, gradually opens' out to about 10 miles. If is pro fusely watered. After reaching the plain the road trends more371 Route No. 66— oontd . towards the N. and moves along the western limit of the plain with frequent curves, hugging the base of a series of bluffs (the top still snow-flecked in May). From these successive rocky spurs project into the marshland, making the road difficult of passage at two points, viz., at 9 miles and at 9 miles 4 furlongs, at which caravans are obliged to take the marshland for a short distance. In the winter time or in the rainy season these points and indeed the whole road would presumably be impracticable. At 11 miles there is a small cemetery with peculiar domed tombs immediately to the N. of the road. At 11 miles 4 furlongs there is a ruined caravanserai on the N. of the road. At the next pro jection the road turns definitely N. At 16 miles the last project ing spur is passed. The marshland ends. The hills on the W. recede for a short distance. The road rises slightly to within half a mile of Kushk-i-Zard, which is reached at 21 miles. The ruins of a spacious caravanserai give the place a somewhat imposing appearance. Attached to this is a walled and castel lated mud village said to contain about 120 houses, of which only half, according to native report, are now inhabited, recent rains having wrought havoc in the village. The inhabitants are of Ilidt origin. Camping ground .—For a brigade. Water .—Plentiful Supplies. —Nil. 8 BABA SHAIKH 23 m. General direction — AHMAD- N.-W. The cara- 142^ m. 8,900’. van road, which passes Kushk-i-Zard some 400 yards to the W. of it, runs to Piil-i- Shikan, for the first six miles in a direction slightly W. of N., ^crossing several small water-courses, some dry shallow ndlds and two patches of marshland. Immediately after quitting the latter of these it deflects to slightly E. of N. and continues thus till at 10 miles 4 furlongs it strikes the river at a spot known as Pul-i-Shikan. The river itself is locally known as the Shikan and a ruined village standing on the N. bank of the river about half a mile distant from this spot bears the same name. The bridge exists in name only. The river, which is here about 10 to 12 yards wide, is crossed diagonally by a ford, the water being about 3 feet deep, at the deepest point, in May. From Pul-i-Shikan two routes lead to Qishlaq, the one, the usual caravan road which continues in almost the same direction as the road !Route No. 86— contd. from Knsbi-i-Zard to the ford, the other, a track in many places quite undefined, only known to and used by the tribesmen. Moving N. W. up the valley, which is here about 4 to 5 miles broad, it strikes the river. Shaikhan at about 13 miles 5 furlongs and during the rest of its course to Baba Shaikh Ahmad runs more or less parallel to this river, which varies in breadth from 10 to 20 yards and in places feeds some patches of cornland, or spreads itself out over marshland which makes it necessary to be cautious. At about 15 miles the valley widening out discloses in the dis tance to the W. the magnificent Damneh range covered with perpetual snow. At about 17 miles a few patches of barley appear and a little mud homestead, said to be inhabited by 3 or 4 families only, is sighted about 1| miles off the road to the W. The road here skirts a series of hummocks, offshoots of the mountains which bound the plain on the E. At about 19 mites a ruined building, Kaleh Qambar Agha, with a cemetery, stands by the roadside on the E. From about this point the ascent of the road, very gradual throughout its whole course, becomes slightly more marked and the patches of the marshland more extensive, making the approach to the Imamzadeh somewhat treacherous. At about 22 miles the Imdmzddeh is reached, a lonely little shrine roughly built of unhewn stone, tapped by a bluish dome. Some tombstones are scattered immediately round the Imdmzddek and there is a small cemetery hard by In front of the Imdmzddeh is a deep spring with a leather bucket and a rope* The place is intensely lonely; there is not even a guardian to the shrine.

Shaikh Ahmad at 340 degrees the track runs towards a well-defined gap in the range of mountains which bound the plain on the N.-W. A con spicuous conical hill towards the western extremity of this range, some 3 miles from the track, is pointed out as the source of the river Shikan and designated Qabristan-i-Kaha. At 1 mile 2 furlongs the river is crossed and the ground begins to rise slightly. The distant snow-covered peaks of the * Kuh-i-Damneh reveal373 Route No. 66— contd. themselves on the W. At about 6 miles 3 furlongs the middle of the gap (about one furlong wide) is reached. A spring trickles across the road from the rocks on the E. From 6 miles 4 furlongs to 9 miles the track, deflecting slightly more to the W. and ascending to a height of 9,000 feet, traverses an amphitheatre about 2 miles wide down which flows a streamlet fed by numer ous springs. Here and there the water is diverted to patches of wheat, sowings of Qashqals. At 8 miles a few hundred yards W. of the road are the remains of a cemetery and of some build ings standing on slight rise above patch of barely and wheat watered by adjacent springs. The spot, apparently a deserted or half-deserted Qashqai settlement, was variously designated by the guides as Harvan or Arran. At 11 miles the track crosses a stream and moving N. runs over a low ridge rising gradually to 9,500' at about 12 miles. Then deflecting slightly, more to the W., it descends very gradually along the top of a projecting spur of a hill with a nala on both sides. About 13 miles 4 furlongs it drops down and loses itself in the western and broader of these two ndlds at a point close to where these two ndlds unite. Just before this drop an extensive patch of verdure, representing Qishlaq, becomes visible northward beyond the windings of the ndld. This might perhaps be reached more quickly and more easily by following the ndld. The track, however, lost for 200 or 300 yards in the bottom of the ndld, becomes clearly discernible again on the W. bank of this, a little further N. Emerging from the ndld it runs N.-N.-W. over undulating ground traversed by several deep ndlds in rapid succession. Dropping at about 17 miles into a grass-clad ravine at a spot known as Deh Kahid, marked by three large willow trees and the extensive ruins of a kaleh (on the W.), it runs along the western side of the ravine, which is about 2 to 6 furlongs wide, passing at 21 miles 6 furlongs another ruined kaleh on the W., with a small Imdmzddeh adjacent to Plr-i-Daud. Here patches of cultivation, fed by the stream which flows down the ravine (the ground in places is treacherous), denote the approach of Qishlaq, which is reached at 23 miles. There is no village,—only the remains of a kaleh too ruined to afford any shelter to man or beast. Camping ground.—JAmited and bad. Water. —Abundant. Fuel.- —Brushwood.

The caravan 190 1 m. r°ad, passing W. of ruined fort of Qishlao, begins at once to ascend gradually In aTw. direction and continues to do so for about 9| miles, traversing undulating ground formed by the spurs of the mountains which run immediately to the W. of the road. The track is in places so ill-defined as to render a guide absolutely -necessary. The soil, loose sand and gravel, overgrown with tufts of aromatic brushwood, is impregnated with moisture which reveals itself ever here and there in the form of a hill, running across the road, or a patch of soft treacherous ground. At the fifth mile a track traversing the road at right angles, connects Hanna on the W. with Yazd-i-Khast on the E., the latter being, according to native information, 3 farsakhs from this point. Between the 9th and 10th miles high mountains bound the horizon, the Kuh-i-’AlI Jan on the N.-W., the Kuh-i-Dupalang range to the N.-E. The road, still passing over undulating, ground, descends at first gradually (for about H miles), then abruptly for a mile through a steep ndla, a drop of about 400 feet, to a broad valley divided longitudinally by a streamlet feeding patches of cornland. Then rising again gradually it strikes at about 17 miles 4 furlongs the main caravan road run ning, according to native information, from Shiraz vid Kam Elruz, Dizzeh Kurd and Hanna through Hinijan to Qumisheh. This road is at this point and as far as the 22nd mile well trodden and suitable for wheeled traffic. The two routes unite and the road continues to rise for about another mile attaining an atlitude of about 9,400 feet, then descending gradually for another 11 miles strikes across another partially cultivated plain at the N. end of which two ruined enclosures representating the deserted village and caravanserai of Mash, are passed at 21 miles on the W. Almost immediately after passing this point the road makes an abrupt change of direction running N.-E. to Hinijan. At 21 miles 7 furlongs a streamlet flowing with a velocity of about 12 miles an hour from theW. is crossed by bridge (of rough stones and mud supported by 3 arches, breadth of roadway 4 feet) in bad repair. At this point and for the rest of the stage the road is impassable for wheeled traffic. From here to Hinijan the road and the stream run almost parallel to one another. Patches of cultivation begin to appear. At about 23 miles there is a spring375 Boute No. 66— contih in a meadow by the E. side of the road. At 23 miles 4 furlongs a little grove of trees on the W. of the road marks a zldrat-gdh or place of pilgrimage. Here the village of Hinijan suddenly comes in sight, an isolated hillock crowned with two khalehs, covered with tiers of houses and girt about with tall poplars. At 23 miles 6 furlongs a mill is passed about 4 furlongs E. of the road. Carefully willed fruit gardens on the hillsides, which here close in, form a distinctive feature of the place. At about 24 miles 2 furlongs the road crosses a streamlet, over which a mill is built, and bifurcates, the E. branch leading to the lower part of the village, the W. to the rising ground. Hinijan or Hinjan is a remarkably flourishing village. About 250 families ; 57 head of cattle ; 4 or 5 mills.

On the E. run the Kuh-i-Palang, on the W., the Kuh-i-Vasm. At 1 mile 4 furlongs the stream is crossed W. to E. by a rough stone bridge and recrossed a mile lower down by a bridge of stone and wood. Shortly after two mills (one ruined) are passed on the W. side of the road between it and the river. At 3 miles 6 furlongs remains of a land are visible on both sides of the stream. A little beyond this point the ravine begins to open out and the village of Isfarjan, said to contain 600 families, embedded in orchards and gardens, is traversed, the main por tion of the village being on the E. of the road. From Isfarjan a track leads to Daulatabad and Yazd-i-Khast. (Route No. 65, stage 10.) From Isfarjan Qumisheh may be reached by two routes, viz., Ta,rghto and Talkhun or bySular emd Mehiar.

This part of the road is suitable in its present condition for motor traffic. Shortly after leaving Isfarjan a track strikes off W. of the river of that name to Yahlabad and Kurru (native information), then sweeps away to the E. and is lost sight of till it reappears at the loot oi the hills beyond, i.e., N.-E. of Sular. At 10 miles 2 furlongs the villages of Deh Zar and Surun are sighted a short distance to the W. of the road, and a small stream is crossed. At about 14 miles and 4 furlongs the road crosses shallow river-bed about 15 to 20 yards wide. At 15 miles 4 furlongs the monotony Of the plain is broken by a mamelon of rock rising about 800 feet abruptly out of it on the immediate V/. of, and commanding, the road. Just before reaching this mamelon a path branching off eastward leads to the little village of Bang.

As far as Behbehan (st±ge 3) the route is the direct and usual one used to connect Behbehan with the coast. Behbe han is the main collecting and distributing centre for this part of the country. The remainder is the caravan route on to Shiraz, but is not much used at the present time (1911) owing to the unsafeness of the road. Mule and donkey transport is used principally throughout the route, and almost exclusively on the maritime plain. The road for the greater partis a track over rough and hilly country, which is broken up by ravines. As a rule it is only fit for pack transport; but between the Chal-i-Mureh (stage 7) and the end of the Fehlian or Palian plain (about 20 miles), and from ’Aliabad (stage 9) to Shlrlz (about 40 miles) it is passable for wheeled traffic.

The ascent commences at the 3rd mile and continues through a narrow winding gorge, the Tang-i-Astaki, for about a mile, the last \ of which is over a deep kutal. The last 50 yards of this is in a dangerous condition but could be avoided by a slight detour to the right. At 4| miles a second ridge is crossed, the ascent of which is steep but presents no great difficulty. From here undulating ground is traversed, composed of successive ridges which are crossed at right angles, until at 9 miles a steep kutal is ascended by a zig-zag track up a narrow gorge, which would be difficult for laden mules. The gradient of this pass is At 10 miles the watershed between the Gulf and the Rudkhuaneh-i-Zaidan is reached. At 10 J miles the telegraph line branches off N.-E. At 11 miles, after crossing another ridge, a good view of the Zaidan oasis and the source of the Hindian river is obtained. From here the road descends gradually through low hills in a i ortherly direction towards the river. At 13 miles the newly built (1910) village of Tall-i-Oh ah Gab is passed. It consists of 20 houses on a mound 100' high. The road crosses the river Hindian 1 mile W. of this village ; in winter the ford is 100 yards across ; 3' to 4 7 deep ; bod rocky ; current swift; guides should be employed. In rainy weather the river is practically unfordable ; men and baggage cross on rafts kept by the villagers, and animals swim under the guidance of local men. The water of the river is potable. The Telegraph line crosses the river about 2 miles E. of Tall-i-Chah Gab : river here is rapid and unfordable. Cham Zaidan, 120 houses, is situated opposite the ford, J mile N. of the Hindian river, the direction of which is almost due E. and W. The Zaidan vallev, which is about 6 miles across from mountain side to mountain side, and about 24 miles in length, is well cultivated ; wheat and barley are grown in Irage quantities, and also some rice and dates ; 500 donkeys available for transport; cattle, sheep and goats in large numbers.

As 15 miles pass Chah Bu ’Ali where there is an db-ambar and a brick-lined well where kafilehs always water; it contains good drinking water, which can be drawn up by a wheel or reached by descending steps to the water’s edge. As the caravans make no appreciable impression on the supply, it is probable that 000 animals could be watered here daily. At Ibg miles, between the road and the telegraph line, is the shrine of Imamzadeh Abdul a, built of stone. Except in time of drought water can usually be obtained from a ndld close to this shrine At 20 miles the road debouches from the hils into a fertile cultivated plain. At -1 miles a road from Behbehan crosses the mam road and leads to the village of Haji Bu Muni; and i a mile further on another road from Behbehan crosses the main road and leads E. to Bamabad. At 25 miles reach Behbehan. Just before reaching it is a large db-ambdr which supplies half the town with good ram water; the remainder obtain water from ab-ambars to the N. and n. of the town, from wells, and from the river.

The halting place is near the river, which is thirty yards wide and easily fordable, though in spring it would be a formidable obstacle, being rapid and with a stony bed. The road is easy with a slight ascent. McGowan reports that at the time of year that he saw it (April) the river was deep with a strong current, and only fordable under the guidance of experts, and also states that during the rainy season it would be quite unfordable.

There is a high mountain to the N., and in the valley is a forest of oaks. In the valley the horseflies are very bad. Here the road turns E. and rises quickly over a pass between high limestone moun tains at 12 miles. From here there is a descent through a forest of fine oaks which widens out at 14 miles to a meadow of rich grass. Thence there is a sudden rise to a difficult pass at 21 miles, where riding is impossible for a distande of three miles. From here there is a descent to Basht, which consists of two mounds one surmounted by 60 huts, the other by a castle, the residence of As’ad Khan, chief of the Bavi tribe. The castle is about half a mile from the left bank of the river, which here runs in two streams, twenty yards wide and six inches deep over a shingly bed. The river is liable to flood.

At 24 miles pass Kaleh Sarkari (or Maliki) and at 4 miles Deh Shah Hussaini. The route sweeps round the hi. side of the Fehlian valley and at 5 miles pass the Imamzadeh of Shah Jehan Ahmad and the adjoining village of Aregan. At about 64 miles the track crosses a rocky spur on the other side of which an extensive cultivated plain opens out on both sides of the Fehlian river, along the right bank of which the route runs. Above the left bank rises the Kaleh Safid. A valley running X. and S. admits a tributary stream (said to be the river Joujak ?) which sweeps down to the main stream in an “ S ” shaped curve. At 12 miles the route crosses to the left bank by a ford 30 yards below a weir which diverts a considerable volume of water to an adjoining expanse of cultivation, known as the Du-dank ; and about 1 mile further recrosses to the right bank. For the next 2 miles the track is bad and rocky ; and ascends to a considerable height passing a sul phur spring. Descending again, at 16 miles it crosses to the left bank where a tributary stream flows in ; and f mile further on recrosses to the right bank, which it follows for J mile. Here it leaves the river and, passing a small spring at 17 | miles, ascends abruptly about 400 feet over rocky ground and then descends though the Tang-i-Garrau (gradient \j) to Pul-i-Murd, passing at 184 miies a spring called the Chashmeh-i-Garrau. A short distance below Pul-i-Murd the Rud-i-Shul joins the river, which henceforth is known (according to local information) as the river Khas. At Pul-i-Murd is a bridge of solid stone and mortar* formerly of five arches ; the main arch has disappeared, leaving a gap of 25 yards through which the stream, locally known as Ab-i-Laleh, flows with considerable force, from north to S. ; three arches remain on the east side and one on the W.

On the other side of the ridge it descends abruptly to the right bank of a small stream flowing m a deep gorge. The road ascends this gorge for about 10 miles in the course of which it rises about 3,000 feet; this portion of the route in its present condition (1910) is entirely unfit for wheeled transport. At 2J miles the track crosses to the left bank. '■ The village of Deh Eamir is left about 1| miles to the S. ; 6 houses some sheep and goats; cultivation, a little wheat. About here there is plenty of grass and timber ; and the hills are covered with small oaks. At miles pass a mill known as Asiab-i- balar, and, continuing along the left bank of the stream, the track rises and descends abruptly over very bad ground strewn with rocks. This rise is known as Tang-i-Duktar Pari (the maiden’s leap). At 9 miles the track crosses to the right bank and passes the remains of two stone buildings known as the Caravanserai-i- Badarag. After passing this, the track crosses to the left bank and soon after recrosses to the right. About 9| miles a spring is reached, and 3 miles further on another spring of good water, known as the Chashmeh-i-Chehar Qash, oozes up from a bed of reeds. These two springs form the stream which flows with some force down the valley in a stony channel half hidden by a dense growth of sedge reeds and willows. From this point to the Icutal, which is reached at 144 miles, there is no water in the gorge and the track is 15 broad. From this point the road descends through a wooded valley with fine oak trees, known as the Niwa valley; passes a small spring a 15|- miles ; and then, traversing undulating uncutlivated ground, at 19 miles crosses a deep rial a with a streamlet running N. and S.
