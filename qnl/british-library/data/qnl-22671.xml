In my experience, it has been a recugnised custom for Gulf Officer^to use their Joining time as leave. For instance, my ' recess ' last hot weather was actually three weeks 1 leave combined with 24 days joining time, and also in 1936 my ' recess ' was 0 iven on the seme basis. 3. Your Accountant says ( to quote his own words ) that m xmas Holidays can be prefixed and ^.ffixed with leave and tiie joining time admissible can be Vdded to such leave and holidays'. This being the case, my period of absence would be more than covered by one day's leave on average pay, combined with the Xmas holidays and joining time. 4. With regard to the ob ection over the date oi my reach ing Karachi on return, it will, I think, satisfy the A.G.C.R. to inform him that I was on joining time from 31st December to 9th January while returning from leave. After all, if I had stayed in Karachi, as often happens, the date of my reaching Karachi on return is the date that leave expires and I would therefore be grateful if you would please make the reference as requested, since I do not wish 'oo deplete my leave account unnecessarily.

Saiyid Abdur Razzak is due to return from leave on the 20th of this month but he will probably be delayed for a few days here on his way as I have a number of points I wish to discuss with him, so you should not expect him before the 26th of April. 3. I have already sent you a copy of Bushire telegram No.894 dated the 7th April which indicates that you should be in Cairo by the 12th of May and I have no objection to your leaving on the 1st of May if you so desire. I wish to know exactly when you will leave because I want Hadow to go down for a day or two so that you can introduce him to the British and American personalities. 4. Sir Geoffrey docs not view with any favour your request for casual leave immediately before long leave comnences. He pointed out with some force and vigour when I mentioned the subject to him that you had been granted leave over the heads of a large number of people all of whom had urgent private affairs to attend to in the United Kingdom.

New Delhi may convert this period of 10 days leave on half average pay into leave on full average pay* This devise would enable Captain Metcalfe to proceed on leave without any sort of detrement« 22-12-40.From prepage. Ccptain Metcalfe's D.O. meFns that 'by going on one dpy's ierve insteri of 10 days on half average pay (a) his leave account will he debited only by one day instead of 10 days on half average or five days, (b) lie would take advantage of tke Joining ; i time only and that since no house rent is paid while on joining time Govrt. will for those days at t-.e rate of Rs.iOO/- p.m./.his house rent.) V Captain Metcalfe may be under the impression that J^e would use joining time also .somewhere else than at Karachi-th^.J'ixed points On return from« / leave joining time is allowed to Grretted'officers only from the date th£y arrive at Karachi. ( He ha already told /.G.C.P. in the case of his previous leave that he arrived at/ Karachi on a certain date while on the otner hand he has dravn leave salary for a number of days after that date). Since he has applied for the conversion r . ^ i. K - ^ of 13 days leave into one day the matter will have to be referred to G.of I. by the P.P., D.F.A. submitted.
