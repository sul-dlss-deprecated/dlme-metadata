Facing him are four members of his family: a small male child, the owner's wife, another male child and a female child. The first two have a column of text behind them, and the latter two have a column of text above their heads. The hieroglyphs in the main text and in the single columns are all oriented to the right. The text is a simpe htp di nsw formula. No titles are given but the names listed are Nht (the small male child); Sbk htp (the wife); Sbk nht (the second made child); Idnw (the female child); Nfr skw (the owner). \r\nThe molding on the right and left hand sides of the stela is broken. A vertical scar runs down the right side of the face of the stela. Although it appears to be restored, it is not.
