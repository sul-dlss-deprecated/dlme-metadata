To The political i.gent, Unseat, The olitical Agent, Bahrain The i olitical ngent, Kuwait* circ ular. With reference to my Circular Ko#189-G of 19th February 1934 with regard to Intelligence Summaries. 2. political Agents are reminded that the main object of the new form of Intelligence Summaries (taking the place of the old Diaries), which are now marked “Secret', is to kee^ the numerous officials outside the i ersian Gull', who are interested in its affairs, informed of the trend of events along the Arab Coast. If this object is achieved tne writing of §&amp; interim letters to these officials should be much reduced. 3. The following are examples of what is meant ;• (a) The Patagonian Peacock Company are endeavouring to obtain a concession for the export of peacock feathers from the territory of Shaikh Saif bin i aloos, who is also being approached by the British Peacock Company. The Intelligence Summary of the xolitical Agent, in whose area these activities are being carried out, would contain these facts under an appropriate heading. In his next Summary the * olitical Agent would chronicle the fact that the negotiators of both Companies had arrived and had com enced nego ti&amp;tio ns •/e k 2 - negotiatione. Lat.r, he might have to give the information that Bin Falooa wae inclined twarda the foreign concern, hater still, he might have to mention that matters Between the Shaikh and the two Companies had come to a deaalock. V inally, I trust, the Political agent would Be in the ha,. r , position of stating that the British Company had secured toe concession* (b) The Royal Air Force wish to establish a base somewhere in a political Agent’s territory. There are the usual delays but filially the Royal air Force get what they want. The kolitical Agent concerned would note these various steps in his Sumiiiaries* (c) There is a state of unrest in some part oi a olitical Agent's area. He would note this in his nummary and continue to touch on the situation until it had been clearsd up. 4. Mentions in Summaries can be briei as they are supplemented by the usual telegrams and despatches to the . olitical Resident. stalls of negotiations with Jhaikhs should not be given, nor normally should opinions bs volunteered (these of co.u-se can be given in separate communications to the Political Resident). What are wanted are factiS • Lieut#-Colonel. i olitical Resident in the lersiun Gulf.V. — CONFIDENTIAL.

The iolitical Agent, Bahrain. Circular . Not infrequently it happens that t olitical Agents have to co-operate with Naval and Royal Air i orce authorities in connection with incidents, reconnaissances, and so forth, in their political areas. tVhen the particu lar incident etc. is at an end the Political Agent concerned writes a report addressed to the ,olitical Resident summing it up and giving his views in general. The practice has grown u^ for political agents to send copies of these reports direct to the senior Naval Officer, ersian Gulf, and the nir Officer Cemuanding, Baghdad. 2. There is no particular harm in this practice, but it is contrary to the normal procedure of all Services wbe ther Civil or Military by which an officer only communicates with the officer under whom he is serving, who deals with his reports ,s is thought fit. 3. Moreover the Naval and Royal Air torc&amp; authorities connected with the Gulf quite correctly follow the normal i-rocedure: the Resident does not receive copies of reports direct from officers serving under the Benior Naval Officer and the nir Officer Commanding.-2 4. In thecircumstances therefore, and having regard to the fact that the Senior Naval Officex* and /*ir Officer LOmmanding receive direct from rolitical agents copies oi their Intelligence Suauaries wh.ch should keep them generally informed of the course of events in the Gulf, 1 should like the practice mentioned in paragraph 1 to cease. 5 # It is hardly necessary to say that this x'uling should in no way be taken as lessening the close co-operation, which I am glad to s^y, exists between Political Officers and I«aval and Royal Air Force Officers, or the exchange of Intelligence.

What Political Agents should put, and more particularly what they should not put, in their Intelligence Summaries is a matter of some difficulty. Nothing out of place has so far appeared in your Intelligence Summaries but I thought it as well to drop you this line of warning. , Jn this connection please see my Circular Memoran|um No.989-S of the 29th October 1924. When in doubt as to whether some item should or should not be included in your Intelligence Summaries it is better to refrain. The thing to remember is that your Intelligence Summaries have a large circula tion and that some Authorities to whom they go may attach undue importance to, or get hold of the wrong end of the stick about, some item of news mentioned by you.

Do not use the lock on these numbers, but make a new combination of your own of three numbers. In selecting numbers for use it is better to distribute them well over the dial and to avoid any exclusive uso of the 5 J s and lO’s, which tendency on the part of many has come to be well understood by burglars. For the same reason, consecutive numbers, upwards or downwards, are less desirable than any irregular arrangement. For instance, a choice of numbers arranged somewhat as 28, 82, 57, would make a good combination. Do not use numbers between 0 and 20 for the third number of your combination. Never change the combination or put the changing key into the wheels when the cover is removed from the lock, nor attempt to turn the changing key in the wheels until the little wing on the changing key has passed clear through the cover. In operating the lock, count each time your numbers come to the mark, particularly taking account of the first time a number comes to the mark, however little it has to be turned to bring it there. In bringing each number (Continued)Directio ns for operating Keyleas Combination Look CK 6720 L eft-Hand Lock . (Gont * d) tne last time to the mark, great care must be used to bring it exactly in line and no further. If $any one of the three numbers should be carried past the mark the last time, commence again with the first number to set the combination. Do not whirl the dial round, but always turn slowly and steadily, especially when nearing the combination number. After making a new combination and before closing the door, try the combination several times, locking and unlocking, to prove it correct. On the outer ring of the dial will be noticed two marks; the star mark at the top is for setting the combination numbers to when unlocking the stiaight mark is only used in making and changing a combination. !)

Then looking at the back of the lock, turn the key one quarter turn contra-clockwisei leave it there and proceed to make a new combination as follows: The lock has three wheels - select three numbers on the dial - one for each wheel.

Access to such keys can only be gained by— (a) A knowledge of the combination at which the lock is set. (b) The employment of force. As regards (a), the particular combination at which the lock is set should only be known to His Majesty’s ^.^w^and to such members of his staff as are authorised to have access ter the cyphers. As regards {b), the box is not calculated to resist any great amount of force. It is, however, so constructed that the fact of force having been used must be apparent when it is examined. In order to guard, as far as possible, against opportunity being afforded for the employment of force, the box should be kept in a press, under lock and key, screwed down to one of the shelves. 3 . With a view to providing an additional safeguard the combina tio n should be changed at the beginning of each quarter and Hi^-Majeffiws 4. 1VO Wrltien noie snoma ue maae oj me curnuinauun. vviiere niuie than one member of the consular staff is authorised to have access to the box, there should be no difficulty in ensuring the recollection of the combination at which the lock is set. Where only one member of the staff is so authorised it may be advisable that he should employ some form of memoria technica to ensure that the combination is not forgotten. 5 . The lock should always be set at a combination of three numbers; instructions regarding the method by which the combination should be set are enclosed with the box. Special care must be taken that the outside knobs are not turned indiscriminately, after releasing the bolt head, unless their exact position before releasing the bolt head {i.e., the combination which has been set) is known. 6. When setting the lock at a new combination it is of the highest importance that the lid of the box should not be closed until the combination has been worked successfully several times in succession. 7. The receipt of the box should be acknowledged by despatch. 8. It should be clearly understood that the provision of the key- box in no way affects the existing rules and regulations regarding the safe custody of the cyphers and secret archives in the event of the post being left in charge of an unsalarie-d officeiv- 9. If His Majesty’s j s the only officer at his post entitled to have access to the box, e^ch time the combination is changed it should be communicated (by cypher despatch or other safe means) to hhr sup-erintending mission- or consular officer, as the -case may be.

You will find these instructions in correspondence of about four years ago regarding India Office suggestion that Political Agents should receive copies of correspondence direct. Letter follows. Resident3rit ian Tvee idency O’onsulate-C/Gneral 3uj3tiire # tne 27th October, 1938, No.512-8 of 1938- The Political Agent, Kuwait / The political Agent, Bahrain The Political Agent, Muscat Circular Memorandum * As you are aware in most Administrations it is quite unusual for Political Agents to receive papers direct from outside authorities or to address these authorities direct or repeat to them copies of communications addressed to the Head of the Administration. Owing however to the somewhat peculiar circumstances which exist in tne Persian Gulf i.e. delays in communication between ny headquarters and the Agencies, some years ago I agreed to Political Agents being sent direct by outside authorities, a.g. tne India Office and the Government of India, copies of papers addressed to me. 2. in doing so, however, I made it clear tn&amp;t (a) no decision should be taken by the Political Agent, or (b) no approach be made to tne local Ruler oy nim without prior reference to me; and (c) that no opinion should be expressed by tne Political Agent to outside authorities on papers received by nim, also without prior reference to These /6./ - 2 - |i These iestrictions are obviously essential since the final responsibility for all political matters in the Persian Gulf rests on the Political Resident, 3, The system generally has worked well for several years, despite the disadvantage that every now and then a political Agent inadvertently overlooks my instructions. The only alternative would be for Political Agents not to receive any papers direct, whicn would result in much delay and additional labour. 4. With regard to 2(c) above. What I had in mind was that in order to save time Political .Agents could repeat to the India Office or other outside authority the result of action taken, without giving an expression of their opinion, which would be conveyed separately to the Political Resident only. In view, however, of tne difficulty of separating facts and opinion in such cases, I am of opinion it is beet tnat Political Agents should not, unless specifically instructed by me, repeat to outside authorities their reports to the Political Resident. ^he restrictions referred to in paragraph 2 above naturally apply with equal if not greater force to suggestions or expressions of opinion initiated by Political Agents, which should in no case be addressed or repeated to outside authori ties since the Political Resident may or may not agree witn the views expressed by the Political Agent. The correct Procedure in such cases is for the Political Agent to address the Political Resident only.3 S 9 I trust tnat political y\gente will aanere strictly to the instructions contained in this Circular. sd.

Sir Trenchard thinks it an excellent thing to decentralize as much as possible, that is what the Assistant Political Agent is in Bahrain for. In any cases, however, except of pure routine Sir Trenchard would like to be certain that you have actually seen the letter before issue under Howes 1 signature. He suggests, therefore, that it would be better if letters emanating from your office, whether Express or Memorandum, should have your signature typed with Howes* attestation.

I suggest, however, that the B.B.C. might be invited to make a point of sending the Committee a presentation copy of any well-got-up publication they may issue, as for instance they may possibly be doing on the occasion of the anniversary of their Arabic broad cast, which occurs this month.

The whole essence of an immediate telegram is that it should be treated with the utmost urgency and the standing rule in all offices is t/iat such tele grams must be decyphered immediately and then given to the addressee at any hour of the day or night.

Dear Agency, Your confidential memorandum No, C/666-12/4 of August 18th covering a bag of mail to be sent by safe hand to Bushire - as you are no doubt av/are the courier’s passport, which is issued by the Embassy in order to enable the Captains of the Slow Mail to act as courier, only entitles them to carry one bag, the weight of which must not exceed two kilograms The bag which you asked us to forward weighed no less than 12 kilograms 315 grams and as only one bag is authorised we had to put our own correspondence for Bushire, including that which came to us from other posts, into this bag. It was therefore, by the time it left us, more than six times heavier than it should have been. We trust that the Iranian authorities v/ill not raise any objections on that score, but there is always the possibility that they might, and we therefore feel bound to draw your attention to this matter in order that you may take such action as may be possible in future to keep bags down to the authorised weight or, P.T.O./ alternatively litical Agency,alternatively, that arrangements may be made by a qui de droit to arrange for an increase in the authorised weight of bags.
