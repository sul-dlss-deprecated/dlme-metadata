It will be remembered that the increase of 40% of pay was granted as a measure of relief for the heavy fall in the rupee-kren exchange though the staff appear to have regarded it in the light of^cornpensetion for the high cost of livingo I pointed out to the Director that this inference was incorrect end suggested that I might 8 pply f° r sanction to an increase of the Famine Prices Compensation Allowance (Persian Section Signallers RsdS^ Higher Officers Rs.30 per mensem) for ell classes to Rs»60 per mensem and asked him, should he think this insufficient,, to submit proposals to meet famine conditions,, as apart from war conditions if possible, at the same time warning him that compensation for the latter had not been granted to Govermient servants whose income exceeds £250 per annuuio The Director replied, that the increase I suggested was not sufficient to meet the existing conditions which showed that local food stuffs had risen in price 100% since the 1st August 1914 and imported articles more, and he recommended that an allowance of 20% of pay should be granted to himself and Superintendents, 30% to other gazetted officers, and 50% to non-gazetted officers including Persian Section Signallersc I then ascertained from him that the rise in prices quoted by him had been endorsed by the Legation at Teheran, and the Consuls in the provinces, except at Yezd where the rise was stated to be Qbi%o The Labour Gazette for October 1917, page 359 0 showed that the rise since the war in the price of foodstuffs in theUnited Kingdom on the 1st October 191? was estimated at 97% and in the general cost of living nearly 80%, These increases not- appearing to be much less than those being experienced in Persia I informed the Director that there did not seem to be a justification for applying for a hi^ier scale of relief than had been sanctioned for the staff of the Indie Office which is approximately equivalent to 30% on pay up to PadOO per mensem l]-i% on pay from Rso]00 to P8 o 200 per mensemo 5% on pay from Rbo 200 to Rso300 per mensem. In reply to this the Director states that the rise of 100% applied only to local produce tut that figures now supplied him for cost of living at the beginning of October 1917 show a rise of from 174 to 223 per cent £ according to locality over the cost in /ugiet 1914 0 and he considers that there is every justification for the grant of the increases he had recommended and he hopes they will receive early sanction. In consequence of the failure of the harvest on the top of the already severe conditions produced by the war the rise in the cost of living in Persia has assumed serious dimensions and prices being still on the upward grade some relief to the staff seems to be really necessary. The Director who is on the spot is in the best position to judge what is required and I am confident he has not made his recojnmendations without very serious consi delation and that he regards them as the minimum that should be granted in the circumstances 0 The request for relief reached me on the 9th October 1917 y and time has since been consumed in a telegraphic correspondence before I find myself a position to submit the application hence any relief that may be sanctioned should» I think e be granted with retrospective affect from the 1st November 1917 0 I therefore sutrait that with effect from the 1st November 191?* a special local allowance- in addition to all existing allowances, may be granted for the period of six months to the staff of this Department in the Persian Section as follows:- Director, Superintendents and .Supreri-i^tendent . 20% ofOther gazetted officers of Salary All others including temporary employees „ paid probationers^ line and menial staff etCo* 50fc ^ subject to proviso that total salary plus this (allowance does (not exceed (Rs. 500c. The estimated cost of this allowance, if sanctioned, is Rs o Q 3 400 (£560) per mensem for which provision will be made if necessary in the revised budget estimateSo APPROVED COUNCIL 10th January 1918 0 # ♦^jn 1 No. 24 op 1918.

Received at India Office 18th (7 a.ra.) compensation to officials in Persia it would be convenient to receive an early reply.The proposals centained in the Viceroy’s telegram of June 1st are, in existing circumstances, less favourable to the Indo-European Telegraph Department than the Treasury scheme now in force. No officer in this Department is so highly paid at present as to be affected by the limit proposed for the total sum that may be converted at the privileged rate, viz., Rs.1,000, but the senior General Service Clerks, Class II,and all the General Service Clerks, Class I, will be adversely affected by the reduction from Rs. 375 to Rs.200 it is proposed to make in the minimum salary to be converted at the privileged rate. Thw two schemes differ according to the market rate At a rate of 370 of exchange between krans and rupees, krans to 100 rupees that two schemes are to all intents identical but when the number of krans per Rs.100 is less than 370 the Treasury scheme is more favourable and when tne number of krans per Rs.100 is more than 370 the Indian scheme is more favourable. At the present quarterly rate of exchange, viz., krans 225 to Rs.100 the difference between the two schemes is shewn in the following table:- Salary Rs. 1,500 1,000 800 600 500 400 350 250 200 Treasury Scheme Kra. 4,703 3,222 2,632 2,040 1,745 1,449 1,100 917 733 Govt.of India Scheme hrs. 4,564 3,090 2,500 1,910 1,615 1,320 1,025 877 730 Difference Krs.

It will be seen that Sir Percy Cox recommends that all local and sumptuary allowances should be paid at the privileged rate. The Government of India agree that the latter shall be so paid but propose that the former shall be included as salary for the purpose of this compensation, Local allowances are now divided into two categories, 'duty' and 'compensatory', the former being given for\ increased work or responsibility and the latter to meet 'the high cost of living in special localities or to meet certain specific expenditure, e.g. the keep of a horse, customs charges, eta. It would therefore seem to be more logical to pay all 'compensatory' local• allowances, of which a sumptuary alllowance would be one, at the privileged rate and to include 'duty' local allowances only in the salary to be subject to the compensation scheme. It is proposed , in the telegram, that the concessions should have effect from the 1st November, 1916, and this date will oe suitable for the officers of the Persian Gulf Section of this Department serving in Persia. Officers in the Persian section are already in receipt of compensation under tne terms of the Treasury Scheme (Council Minute dated 10th March, 1917) and I have asked in my reference to the Public Works Department No.I.E.759 dated 18th June, 1917, that they may be permitted to continue to receive this compensation till further orders.

Grant of Compensation on account of fall in exchange to the Foreign Office officers and establishments in Persia. Question of granting similar concession to our officials in Persia has been considered carefully in consultation with Cox and we now request sanction by telegram to following measures namely A. With effect from 1st November last all gazetted and non gazetted officers in Civil employ in Persia who are paid in the first instance from Indian revenues to draw 200 Rupees a month or the whole of tneir salary whichever is less plus half the balance of their salary if any up to a maximum total of 1000Rupees a month at trie privileged rate of exchange of 365 krans per 100 Rupees. Salary will include all allowances except sumptuary allowances. The whole of latter to be paid at privileged rate of exchange without regard to maximum. These orders will not apply to officers and establishments serving with South Persia Rifles and other levies in Persia whose case is under separate consideration. B. For members of consular escort we recommend following monthly maxima up to which conversion will be allowed at privileged rate in their case Sowars and Lance Daffadars 5 Rupees Daffadars 7 Rupees Jemadar 15 Rupees Indian Officers above the rank of Jemadar 35 Rupees. C. n We recommend concession proposed at (A) should be extended to all (?Assistant Surgeons) under the Indo European Telegraph Department in PerBia. (D)D. For the period from 1st April to 31st October 1916 we recommend firstly that Lt. Colonel Gou^i Lt.Colonel Kennion Consul Kerman and their establishment should be granted compensatory allowance of 40% of salary up to a maximum of rupees one thousand two hundred and fifty a month from date on which they assumed charge of their duties whether they had reached their head quarters or not and secondly that the same rate of allowance be granted to the British Vice Consul, Ahwaz and his establishment from 1st July to 31st October 1916. We would add that pending consideration of these proposals and on Cox* s recommendation we authorised the payment of the clerical and escort establishment of Lt. Colonel Kennion Lt. Colonel Gou^i the British Consul at Kerman and the British Vice Consul Ahwaz at the fixed rate of exchange of 365 krans per Rs.100 and we recommend that the recovery of any amounts overdrawn under those orders may be waived on the introduction of the scheme now proposed. Our recommendation does not include Lt. Colonel Haig British Consul General Ispahan as he is serving directly under the Foreign Office. We presume tnat the concessions mentioned in your telegram of 1st February applies to him. If not we recommend that he may be given benefit of concession now proposed at (A).Extract from a letter No.3667/14/204 dated March, 1917, from the Hon'ble Sir P.Z.Cox, K.C.S.I., k.C.I.E Chief Political Officer, Basra, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, in the Foreign and Political Dept. Delhi. In reply to your Me«o; N 0 .IO 6 O-D dated 15th February, I have the honour to submit below the proposals called for therein:- 2. As from November 1st:- (1) All officials of ’ hatever rank and class drawing their pay in rupees and receiving less than Rs.400/- per mensem to draw their entire salary at the rate of hrans 365 per Rs. 100 /- as long as exchange remains below that figure. ( II ) Officials drawing more than Rs.400/- to receive that amount at the rate of 365 Krans per 100/- and 1/2 the excess of their pay over Rs.400/- per mensem at the same rate, up to a total maximum of Rs.1250/- per mensem. This is to say no Officer should draw at the special rate of exchange, under the above paras. ( 1 ) and ( 11 ) on more than Rs.1250/- per mensem (III) Local and Sumptuary allowances in Persia to be drawn at ^rans 365/- per Rs. 100 /-. 3. 1 have suggested the limit for the full concession at Rs.400/- instead of Rs.375/- the exact equivalent of £300/- to simplify calculation etc. and because this sum practically includes all the lower paid ranks. in suggesting a maximum of Rs.1250/- per mensem, I have been guided by the limit fixed (£ 1000 /-. a year) when the old rupee exchange compensation was granted. There is no re al analogy because the £ 1000 /- a year in that case was the portion of one’s salary which one might be expected to spend home, whereas the portion one wishes to get compensation or m this case is what one spends out here. InIn virw, however, of the uovemrnent of india'j directions as to the expediency of discriminating between more highly paid officials and others, it seems necessary fix a maximum. XXXXXXXAXXXXAX I have omitted officials of the Indo-European Telegraph Department who are paid by the India Office and who have already the advantage of the following concessions:- Gazetted Officers receive War allowance of Rs.20%. Non-gazetted staff when exchange falls below 385, get 1/2 their pay at 385, and 1/2 at the rate of exchange for previous quarter. XXXXXXXXXXXXX-XX.

December 31st,1916. 767 19! 7 Dear Mr.Tilley, I understood from Tehran some months ago that they had represented to the Foreign Office the hardship that Diplomatic ana Consular Officers in Persia are suffering owing to the depreciation of the value of the £ ana rupee in Kran exchange. As nothing has transpired since, and the hardship is daily growing more acute, I hope you will forgive my troubling, you with this: it is very rare tnat. I ma.ke any personal requests to the Foreign Office, and I know you take a an interest in the Levant Service. Exchange is even worse for those of the service in Tehran, and northern Persia; out for those without private means, like myself, the pinch is now very severe. All my local allowance of £b0, and rather more, goes in house-rent. Of my salary of £450, I pay now yearly • £40 in income tax (Indian political officers here ana Inaian Vice-Consuls, etc. elsewhere in Persia, ao not pay income-tax on their salaries). My servants 1 wages- ana. I eia a bachelor, living as economically as I can- used to cost me aoout -bO per annum before the war and up to the beginning oi 1916: with the rates of exchange of the la.st lew months I am paying the same amount of Persian money to the same men,and it costs me some £14 monthly,^ over ^icC annually. (There are no hotels here). My other aivim expenses here used to be up to 1915 between £150 and £200 annually: it is not a cheap post, Bushire. During “^•C.Tilley, Esq., C.B.,During the greater part of the 10 years that I have been here, exchange nas ranged from Ob to 50 Krans per £, and 370-560 Krans per 100 Rupees, but sometimes it was higher, as in 1914-lb» You can easily see, therefore, that with exchange at Bush ire now down to ol Krans pe r £» and 210 Krans per 10 0 rupees, in addition to the rise in the price of food and other necessaries in Bushire since 1915, it is no longer possible to make both ends meet on a salary of £400. One does not like to &amp;sk for more pay in this war- strain. But our rate of pay uoes seem unfair, when on the *A one hand the Vice Consul at Bander Abbas ( an ex telegraph- clerk, a long way below me on the list of Vice Consuls) has his salary ana allowances raised by the Government of India to £600 ( of v/hich the Home Government pay half), and similar high rates of pay for other Indian Consular officers no senior to myself: and on the other hand. Sir P.Sykes is taking on young Bank accountants as officers in his force at high rates of pay, which all Britisn ranks in Persia are apparently entitled to exchange at 36b Krans per 100 rupees. My consular assistant went to help Sir P.Cox at Basra in 1915, and except for one action has not ceen up at the fighting front. Yet he has been getting £d4U p.a. allowance in aaaition to his Consular pay, though i ow posted in Persia again, at Shustar. Bullard, who is in an office in Basra gets similarly large allowances, or larger: and they are not faced with the Kran exchange question at Basra. So it does come hard that after nearly 20 years o^ pensionable service, most of it in this trying climate, and with difficult, incessant work, one’s pay should not meetmeet very modest living expenses. For.the Consular officer in Persia has almost as risky and hard a life nowadays a.s any military officer in the country. I do hope you will be able to obtain some redress us ve ry so on-: I write feelingly because I have now to pay this 'Imperial' Bank ( which is bleeding us white wi lts exchange monopoly) an overdraft of £100.

FOREIGN OFFICE, January 2nd, 19^7^ Sir:- to ^ dia \ j j j With reference to your letter, 29484, of the 6th ultimo, relative to the suggested increase in the salaries Oi the Diplomatic and Consular Staffs in Persia, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Balfour to transmit to you, herewith, to be laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, a copy of a further telegram from His Majesty's Minister at .tehera,;, containing his observations on the proposal now advanced. In view of the objections raised by Sir C.Marling to the arrangement sanctioned by Their Lordships in regard to the Minister's own salary, I am to suggest that the principle of payment at a fixed rate of exchange which has been partially adopted for the Legation Staff should also be applied to some portion of the salary of the Head of the Mission. I am to propose therefore that out of the toodi salary of four thousand five hundred pounds, an amount DO X* of ine thousand pounds should be paid at the pre-war rate of iJifty five iCrans, and that this rate should be applied to one half of the balance, i.e. One thousand seven hundred 50 «nd fifty pounds, the remainder being drawn in sterling. In Secretary to Treasury.In inviting the concurrence of Their Lordships to this proposal, I am to express the hope that they will agree to the proposals regarding the ante-dating of these allowances contained in my letter of the 9th ultimo.

Our officers are permitted to draw part of their pay in India, and if officers under the Foreign Office enjoy similar concession, relief seems to be required only with regard to such portion of salary as is ordinarily drawn in Persia. We are not aware of reasons for rejection of proposal to grant exchange compensation allowance, but more satisfactory solution would, we think, be to permit officers affected to convert proportion of their salaries into krans at a normal rate of exchange, the proportion being higher for officers on low salaries and lower for officers salaries. This would secure automatic reduction and final withdrawal of concession on improvement in rate of exchange. In view of frequent fluctuations in rate of exchange any lixed additional salaries would require frequent review. This affords further argument for adoption of sliding scale on lines suggested above.

My Lord:- In accordance with the instructions con- • tained in Your Lordship’s telegram Ko.441 of September 21st last, I have the honour to transmit herewith a table prepared by Mr. Maclean, showing the present prices of local goods and of imported goods, not produced in Persia, which may be classed as necessaries, as compared with prices obtaining in 1914 in Tehran, Isfahan, Bushire, Tabriz and Resht. At Kazvin, where His Majesty's Consul for Ramadan is at present resident, conditions are much the same as at Resht. I have not yet been able to obtain a report from Shiraz, but I think that it is safe tc assume that, owing to the oad harvest, conditions at that town are no better, and probably worse than elsewhere. Prom the enclosed table Your Lordsh p w^. 11 observe that the cost of living occasioned by the general rise in prices combined with the faxl m exchange has in most cases increased o^ ooros hundred per cent, and in some cases by very cmsid erably more, a condition of things which render,. for the junior members of my staff and of the provincial Consulates almost impossible, and for higher paid officers and myself a thing of extreme difficulty. Since The Right Honourable Viscount Grey of Fallodon, K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.vv Since the enclosed, table was prepared the ex change has further fallen in Tehran to 28.50, in Tabriz to 26.50, in Isfahan to 30, in Resht to 27.50 and in Kazvin to 26, and there does not at present seem to be any prospect of a rise. I need not dwell upon the hardship inflicted alike on all Diplomatic and Consular Officers by these conditions, but I would venture to point out how un favourably their position compares with that of the officers of the South Persia Rifles, who receive their pay at the rate of 54, and with that of the officials of the Imperial Bank of Persia, who in addition to being paid at the fixed rate of 55, have recently received a general increase of salary of 25%. I have already, in my telegram No.688, of October 25th last, pointed out the inadequacy of the relief proposed by the Treasury (see Your Lordship’s telegr No.464 of October 23rd), which moreover suffers from the defect, as must all relief based on a fixed percentage of our sterling salaries, that with e^ery fall in exchange, the relief diminishes, or n other words the more relief is required, the less xs ed, and I would again urge that the simplest '- ‘O - est way of affording the much needed relief xd for His Majesty’s Government to make an art gemen with the Imperial Bank of Persia by which the Diplomatic and Consular officers concerned may be allowed to draw their official salaries at the minimum rate of 55, and at the same time I consider that I am justified in suggesting that an increase of pay should be granted up to 25%. I would also urge that, in view of the conditions prevailing in the provinces, relief should oe granted simultaneously to all Diplomatic and consular inP.s. A copy of this despatch is being sent by bag. @&gt; in Persia under Your Lordship T s Department, and I would express the earnest hope that the relief be made retroactive, not from dune 1st, as suggested by the Treasury, but at least from April 1st last, at which time His Majesty f s Servants in Persia were already forced by conditions to overdraw at the Imperial Bank of Persia in order to meet their expenses. I would add that so severely is the loss by exchange felt by Europeans, that four of the Junior officials of the Indo-European Telegraph Department have felt themselves forced to send in their resigna tions* I have, &amp;c., (Signed) Charles M.

Lord Urey earnestly hopes that Their Lordships will concur in the increase of forty per cent already sanctioned being rendered applicable as from the 1st April last and not from the 1st June as originally suggested, and that they v/ill agree that the payment of a double salary to His Majesty’s subordinate Diplomatic and Consular officers should date from the 2nd November last, that the pay of His Majesty’s Minister should be increased from that date by one-third instead of by one-sixth and thhfc-Jthe latter secretary to the Treasury./ latter rate should also he allowed to sir C.

W e would be glad to receive' very early information of decision arrived at.r 5117 I 29484 TEMSUBI OHAIibiiES, December, 1916* 16 My Lord, I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury Sir M. de xiunsen’s letter of the 2nd ultimo (W.214308/16), further respecting the salaries of the Diplomatic and Consular staff in Persia. My Lords understand that in Sir C. i^rling’s opinion no distinction should be made between officers at Teheran and officers in other districts: and the observations which follow apply to xersia generally. The present position may be summarised as follows: The Kran is not circulating at its intrinsic value - i.e. at the commercial value of the weight of silver which it contains - but at an artificial monopoly value, further the exchange and the actual supply of commodities ^re considerably affected by the present restrictions on Persian trade and the difficulty of transport. this position might be rapidly modified by an increase in the number of brans in circulation or by the restoration oi more normal trade conditions: but, v/hile it exists, t &gt;c case of Persia may be regarded as exceptional and mea^ureo may be legitimately taken which would hardly be defensible elsewhere. An ^er Secretary of State, foreign Office.An officer in Persia who is paid in sterling is damnified in two ways. He obtains fewer Xrans for each pound sterling. And - over and above this - v/hen he purchases local cornmodities he obtains less for each Kran because Kran prices have risen. On the other hand, it must be remembered that his whole expenditure is not on a Kran basis. For example, any payments which he makes at home for the education of his children or for goods purchasable in London are made on a sterling basis. My Lords think that the Secretary of State will probably agree with Them that it would not be defensible to give compensation both for the fall in the exchange value of the pound and for the rise in Kran prices. Such a measure would leave the officers concerned in almost the same conditions as before the Tar whereas other public servants are under the necessity of making considerable sacrifices. On the other hand, it is desirable to make some arrangement which will obviate freauent readjustments: and Their Lordships understand that out of 18 officers only 6 are in receipt of salaries in excess of £500. In these circumstances They suggest as an interim emergency measure the following scheme which is based on the assumption that, on the average, the lower paid officers will tend to be unmarried and to spend their salary locally rather than by means of remittances home.1. Sir C. karling himself to receive the increase of one third suggested in the letter under reply. 2. Other officers to receive £300 per annum of their salary in Krans at the pre-War rate of 55 Krans to the pound sterling. Any excess above £300 to be paid as regards one half in Krans at the above mentioned rate and as regards the other half in sterling. 3. In view of the possibility that conditions in Persia may suddenly change, fresh evidence to be submitted to justify the continuance of the arrangement (if desired) after 30th June next - it being further understood that in any case it will terminate at the end of the War. I am directed to make it clear that it is not suggested that the off icers should have a one -sided option as to converting their salaries - which would mean that whatever the circumstances they could not fail to gain and that the Exchequer could not fail to lose. Their Lordships* proposal is that the foregoing scheme should be definitely substituted for existing arrangements. ky Lords would be glad to learn whether the Secretary of State concurs in Their suggestions.

In reply I am to request you to inform Viscount drey of Fallodon that in view of the peculiar circum stances affecting Persia and of the information now supplied by ^ir C. marling .ay Lords sanction an increase of forty per cent on the salaries of the subordinate diplomatic and consular officers in Tehran, and an increase of one sixth on the salary of His Majesty’s Minister, both increases to date from June 1st last, subject to the consent of the Secretary of State for India in Council being given to the charge against Indian Revenues of one hoJLf of the additional expendi ture involved. Since it is not yet clear whether the Minister’s figures apply to Persia generally or to Tehran alone, 'Their Lordships must for the moment con fine the concession to officers stationed at that torn, but when precise information has been obtained as to the conditions prevailing in the other rersian townswhere there are consular posts. They will be ready to authorise concessions on similar lines to the occupants of those posts.

I am to request that you will approach the Lords coirmissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury with a view to their consenting to a temporary increase of twenty per cent in the salaries payable to the subordinate diplomatic and consular officials in Persia, and to a grant in the case of the Minister himself of an addition of one-eighth of his present salary, as from the 1st of dune last, an arrangement which, as Their Lordships will recollect, was adopt ed during the Balkan wars in the case of the Diplomatic and consular officials in Turkey. I am to observe that the present conditions Persia are those of complete chaos and do not constitute a parallel with the general deterioratic* of exchange and rise of prices in other countries , j affected by the present war, and I am to express the hope that Their Lordships will not withhold their consent to the arrangement now suggested.

Hirtzel 27/7/16. } Political De.nt The proposal of the Foreign Office, that £1 should be treated as equal to 55 krans (or in the usual Indian notation Rs.100 = 366 2 krans) as against the current rate of 37 krans (Rs.lCO - krans 246 2 ) relates to 'Diplomatic and Consular Officers'. I sm not sure whether the term relates to officials in non-gazetted as well as gazetted establishments although the foreign Office refer to the Indo-European Telegraph Department in which, as will be seen below, only non-gazetted officers have received concessions. I propose to deal with both cases; you will be able to state what the exact position is. In 1905 and the following years the riso in the value of the kran xorced the Government of India to take action with reference to the non-gazetted establishments of the Bushire Residency and various consulates m Persia, and the salaries of the establishments was paid in krans at the rate of 375 krc.ns = 100 rupees (see letter from the Government of India, Foreign Department, Ho. 194 , dated 3rd December. 1908 - copy below). The Foreign ^fice concurredconcurred in this procedure (vide correspondence enclosed in the Secretary of State T s despatch. No. 55 . Political, dated 4th June 1909 - copy attached). In 1908 the Consul G-eneral in Khorasan proposed a similar arrangement for 'the gazetted establishments and the consular escorts^. But the Government of India refused to support the proposal 'as the latter are employed under special conditions of service, while as regards the former it may be safely assumed that the major portion of their salary is not spent in Persia, and that they are thus not affected in any appreciable degree by the rate of exchange'*(see paragraph 5 of the Government of India letter referred to). In 1909 a somewhat similar concession was sanctioned ior subordinate establishments in the Indo-European Telegraph Department (P.W. 174 - below), that is, (a) the rupee pay of the non-gazetted telegraph staff at stations in Persia and at Bushire and Pao, when the quarterly rate of exchange between krans and rupees is less than krans 385 100 , is paid half at the exchange rate of krans 385 - Rs. 100, and the other half at the current rate of exchange, and (b) tne r^.y 01 che men of the native subordinate staff at the telegraph stations at Bushire and Pao is lixed in krans instead of rupees at a rate of 375 krans - Rs. 100. The concession was refused to the gazetted staff a n^ uas n °t applied to allowances that might be drawn bynon-gazetted officers. In 1907 the Imperial Bank of Persia granted theiremploye's a fixed rate of exchange at krans 55 = £1 (vide p. 10 of the enclosures to the letter of the Government of India referred to); So far as the non-gazetted establishments are concerned - if any such exist - I think that the proposal of the Foreign Office might be accepted at once, but it might be suggested that the rate of exchange be fixed not at krans 55 - £1 (the rate given by the Imperial Bank of Persia) but at krans 375 = Rs. 100, i.e. £1 - 56i krans, in order to secure uniformity with the action taken by the Government of India: the attention of the Foreign Office might also be drawn to the previous case in 1909. The Foreign Office were not informed in 1909 of the views of the Government of India regarding the grant of a concession to the gazetted staff. But the position is worse now than that considered by the Government of India as exchange in the five years 1905 - 1909 had not fallen krans 340 - Rs. 100 (see the table on the last page but one of the P.W.file 174 below). There is also the action of the Spanish and Russian Governments to consider. I am disposed to think that a good case exists for giving a concession, but before anything is decided it seems necessary that the Government of India should be consults in the matter. (The case of the Indo European Telegraph Department can be considered after a decision has been reached in this case and the papers might then be sent to Mr* Barkey. 5.8.16.

From my own experience of the Mohammerah office I am fully able to en dorse Colonel Kennion’s statement in regard to the extra work which has fallen to the lot of his establishment ever since the commencement of hostilities against the Turks. It has only been possible to cope with it under a great strain. As regards the dearness of supplies, Mohammerah seems to have fared badly, and probably worse than any other place in the Gulf. The statement of prices ( now current as compared with those that obtained before the war, which forms an enclosure to Colonel Kennion’s letter, argues a need for relief. 3. In the circumstances I beg to support His Majesty’s Consul’s application for the compensation which he proposes for his establishment; at the same time, however, I venture to request that the Government of India will be pleased to accord their sanction to the extra Rs.

I have the honour to address you on the subject of compensation to the clerical and menial staff of this Consulate for extra work and dearness of supplies owing to the war. 2. On the first point I do not think it is necessary to say much by way of argu ment. Clerical work has increased enormously, and all my clerks are employed on Sundays and on week days very much in excess of the usual office hours. Much additional work has also been thrown on the farrashes, the bellamchies, and launch hands. 3. As regards dearness, I attach a statement that gives approximately the cur rent price of necessaries before the war and now. The figures speak for themselves. 4.

I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Morley of Blackburn.ENCLOSURES. Enclosure No. 1. India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, Sir, 16th March 1909. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to request you to submit for the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs certain proposals made by the Government of India as to the payment in Persian currency at a fixed rate of exchange of the rupee salaries of the non-gazetted Consular Establishments and of the Telegraph Staff in Persia. In March of last year the Government of India reported that they had sanctioned the payment in Persian currency, at the fixed rate of exchange, of Krans 375 to Rs. 100, of the salaries of the non-gazetted Consular Establishment and of the European Telegraph Staff in Seistan and Kain. This measure at the rate of exchange then current, viz., Krans 345 to Rs. 100, involved an additional expenditure of about Rs. 2,772. 3. 0. (184Z. 13s.) a year. Enquiry having been made as to whether a fixed rate of exchange had been authorised for the payment of salaries of gazetted or non-gazetted officers serving elsewhere in Persia, the Government of India now state in reply that, prior to March 1908, they had also sanctioned the payment in Persian currency of the salaries of the non-gazetted establishments of the Bushire Residency, and of the Ahwaz, Kerman, Kermanshah, and Bunder Abbas Consulates, at an enhanced cost, taking the rate of exchange current about the beginning of December last, of approximately Rs. 8,080. 13. 0. (538L 14s. 5cL) a year. In reporting this action, the Government of India further submit a proposal to extend to the non-gazetted and telegraph establishments of the Consulates at Meshed and Turbat-i-Haidari the concession of drawing their salaries in Persian currency at the rate of Krans 375 to Rs. 100, at an estimated increased charge of approximately Rs. 6,726 (448Z. 7s. 4d.) a year. In explaining the action already taken, the Government of India point out that, when the concession of drawing salaries in Persian currency at a fixed rate was first granted by them, the rate of exchange adopted was that generally prevailing at the time, and that the subse quent appreciation of the kran that has taken place was not foreseen. The grounds on which they granted the concession are stated by them as follows :—“Not only did the depreciation of the rupee subject the “ members of the establishments concerned to an unmerited pecuniary “ loss, but in the case of salaries fixed in rupees but paid in Persian currency, the fluctuations of the exchange resulted in variations from “ month to month in the amount of salary received, the extent of which could not be foreseen, and the reasons for which the menial establish- “ merits could not understand. In the circumstances, to remove “ discontent, and to facilitate the recruitment of a suitable class of men, the adoption of some method for ' fixing the rate of pay was “ inevitable.” The Secretary of State, while regretting that any action in the matter should have been taken without the previous sanction of His Majesty s Government, is satisfied of the reasonableness of the concessions in themselves, which, as will be seen from the enclosed table, were granted at different times. He would recommend for Sir E. Grey s favourable consideration that the concessions already granted, and those now proposed, shoidd be approved, and that a moiety of the cost of the various concessions, which at the rates of exchange prevailing in December last was estimated at approximately Rs. 17,5/9. 5. 0.Treasury, 17th April 1909 - - Payment of Salaries in Persian Currency. (1,1711 14s. 91) a year, as shown in the table, should be accepted as a charge against British revenues. The actual cost will necessarily depend on the fluctuations in exchange. It is understood that at Tehran the value of the rupee in terms of the Kran has been steadily increasing since the middle of 1908 the rato fou^aTro? loof KrM,S 355 m the being now about Rs. 100 to 1 Ivrans dbo.- If the course of exchange should similarly alter at the provincial Consulates, the extra cost of the concessions granted by the Government of India will he reduced, or may ultimately disappear.

In reply I am to request 3 r ou to inform Sir Edward Grey that while my Lords regret that they were not consulted before any part of the proposed scheme was put into execution, they will not refuse to bear their portion of the loss which has actually been incurred. I am, however, to suggest, for the consideration of the Secretary of State, whether a more satisfactory solution of the difficulty would not be found by fixing salaries in these cases in local currency, rather than in rupees to be converted at a fixed rate. Cases not already settled, and future cases arising, might then perhaps be dealt with by converting the salaries at rates of exchange more nearly corresponding to the existing ratio between the kran and the rupee, provided that those rates are not more unfavourable to the Exchequer than the late of Kians 3/5 to Rupees 100 proposed by the Government of India.

Fort William, the 3rd December 1908, My Lord, In accordance with the instructions contained in paragraph 3 of Your Lordship’s despatch No. 54 (Political), dated the 22nd of May 1908, relative to the payment of the salaries of the non-gazetted Consular establish - meat and the European telegraph staff in Seistan and Kain in lersian currency, we have the honour to forward, for Your Lordship’s information, the accom panying memorandum * showing in detail • Enclosure No. i. the esta bij s i im e n ts to which a similar concession has been extended. 2. Prior to the issue of our despatch No. 68 (Frontier), dated the 26th March 1908, in which we reported the action taken in the case of certain establishments in Seistan and Kain, we had accorded sanction to the payment in Persian currency of the salaries of the non-gazetted establishments of the Bushire Residency and of the Ahwaz, Kerman, Kermanshah, and Bunder Abbas Consulates. The extra expenditure due to the grant of this concession must necessarily vary with a rise or fall in the Kran value of the rupee and has largely increased since the conversion was effected. It will be observed that, at the cuuent rate of exchange, the cost of the establishments concerned, exclusive of Seistan, has been enhanced by approximately Rs. 8,080-13-0 a year. 3. For the purpose of converting salaries originally fixed in rupees into Persian currency, the rate of exchange adopted, with the exceptions noted in the memorandum, was the average rate prevailing at the time, viz., Krans 375=100 rupees. The substantial fall in the value of the rupee which has since taken place was not then foreseen, and in according our sanction to the conversion in the case of the clerical and menial establishments of the Ahwaz and Kermanshah Consulates, which were the first to come under our oonsidera- hon, and in which the extra monthly cost involved was Rs. 9-15-10 and Rs. 24-10-8 only, we did not contemplate that we were establishing a precedent vhich would ultimately result in any considerable increase of expendituie.2 4. The arguments which were in each case advanced for the grant the concession were, in our opinion, difficult to contest. Not only did ^ depreciation of the rupee subject the members of the establishments con 6 to an unmerited pecuniary loss, but in the case of salaries fixed in rupees but paid in Persian currency, the fluctuations of the exchange resultprl • !• ; • . . v . £ suuea m variations from month to month in the amount of salary received, the extent of which could not be foreseen, and the reasons for which the menial establishments could not understand. In the circumstances, to remove discontent and to facilitate the recruitment of a suitable class of men, the adoption of some method for fixing the rate of pay was inevitable. While, therefore, we desire to express our regret that we inadvertently omitted to obtain Your Lordship’s sanction to the extra expense involved, we trust that His Majesty’s Govern ment will concur in the propriety of the measures we have taken to meet the difficulty. 5. There remain the Consular establishments at Meshed and Turbat-i- Haidari to which hitherto the concession has not been extended. We now forward, for Your Lordship’s considera- • Enclosure No. 2. ,. „ , , 1 tion, a copy of a letter* No. 90, dated the 25th January 1908, from His Britannic Majesty’^ Consul-General at Meshed, in which he proposes— (1) a permanent increase in the pay of the Persian establishment of the Meshed and Turbat-i-IIaidari Consulates ; and (2) the grant of exchange compensation in order to secure the establish ments of the two Consulates from loss caused by the depreciation of the exchange value of the rupee. We are not convinced, on the data supplied by Major Sykes, that the rise in the price of the necessities of life in Khorasan has been so marked as to call for a general increase in the pay of the Persian establishment. We are, there fore, not disposed to accept this recommendation. As regards the grant of exchange compensation, we consider that it would be preferable to apply the procedure, w hich has been adopted in the case of other Consular establishments in Persia, to the non-gazetted and telegraph establishments of the Consulates at Meshed and Turbat-i-Haidari, and to con vert salaries, which are now fixed in rupees, into Persian currency at the rate of Krans 375 to Bs. 100. We estimate that the extra expenditure thus entailed will amount approximately to Rs. 6,726f t Enclosure No. 3. , ... ir • a year. We cannot agree with Major Sykes that there are any grounds for according similar treatment to the gazetted establishments and the Consular escorts. The latter are employed under special conditions of service, while as regards the former it may be safely assumed that the major portion of their salary is not spent in Persia, and that they are thus not affected in any appreciable degree by the rate of exchange. We trust that this proposal will meet with Your Lordship’s approval. 6. With reference to paragraph 2 of Your Lordship’s despatch, we understand that a project of new expendi ture in Persia, which is outside the marginally-noted limitations, should he referred for Your Lordship’s pievious sanction, and we have arranged lor this ( 1 ) Fresh expenditure for salaries up to an ■ mount not exceeding £100 per annum in the aggregate at any one Consulate ; ( 2 ) increased expenditure on contingencies, except as regards an unusual item exceeding £ 100 ; and (3) increased expenditure on travelling.procedure to be followed in future. As regards fresh expenditure which fall, within these limitations, we have assumed from Your T/mW„V’„ T &gt; , “ »&gt;• ■»«'.

Clerical and menial establishments. prior to 1905, the salaries of these establishments were fixed in Indian currency and amounted to Rs. 304)-10-8 a month (as shown in column 2 of Statement No. 1 attached to this Memorandum). In 1905 , sanction was accorded to the pay of these establishments being fixed in krans at the rates specified in column 3 of Statement No. 1. In fixing the pay in krans a uniform rate of exchange was not adopted for the conversion of the rupee salaries of all the members of the establishment. In some cases the conversion was effected at the rate of 400 krans=100 Rs. In others an attempt was made to fix a fair salary in krans with reference to the rate of exchange when the original salary in rupees was fixed and in the case of Persian servants with reference to the local standard of wages. At the average rate of exchange of krans 375=100 Rs. then prevailing, the extra expenditure involved in the revision was only Rs. 21-10-8 a month (vide column 4 of Statement No. 1). 2. Medical establishment. In October 1907, sanction was accorded to the conversion of the salaries of this establishment into Persian currency and the rate of exchange adopted was Krans 375=100 Rs. The total increased expenditure involved in this measure at the present market rate of exchange is Rs. 20-15-11 a month (Rs. 224-15-11, column 4 of Statement No. 2,—Rs. 204 column 2) or Rs. 251- 15-0 a year. Thus compared with the cost of the establishment as originally fixed in rupees the conversion of the salaries of the Kermanshah Consulate into Persian currency involved a total increased expenditure at the current rate of exchange of Rs. 934-12-0 a year. KERMAN. In 1907, sanction was accorded to the fixing of the salaries of the Kerman Consulate establishments in krans and as in the case of the clerical and menial establishments of the Kermanshah Consulate and for similar reasons, no uniform rate of exchange for the conversion was adopted. The rates of pay fixed in krans are shown in column 3 of Statement No. 3. A comparison of the totals given in column 4 and column 2 of that statement will show that the total extra expenditure at the time the revision was effected, amounted to Rs. 53-8 6 only a month, but owing to the depreciation of the rupee the total increased expenditure at the current rate of exchange amounts to Rs. 151-5-2 a month or Its. 1,815-14-0 annually. AHWAZ. In 190fi, the procedure followed in the case of the Kermanshah clerical and menial establishments was adopted in the case of the establishments of the Ahwaz Vice Consulate. Prior to the revision, the total cost of the establishment in Indian currency (exclusive of the salary of the clerk who is still paid in rupees) amounted to s. 214 (column 2 of Statement No. 4). At the time of conversion, the extra expenditure involved was Rs. 9-15-10 a month only, but at the present market Me of exchatige the increase of expenditure amounts to Rs. 36-11-10 a month or Rs 440-U annually.

The increased to a ^ ^ le conversion'amounts at the current market rate of exchange °t-9 a month or Rs 4,254-12 annually.No. 90, dated Meshed, the 25th January 1908. From— Major P. M. Sykes, C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to address the Government of India on the inadequacy of the pay received by the Persian servants of the establishment and the D&amp;k Sowars : and also on the losses sustained in connexion with the fall in the rate of exchange between the Rupee and the Kran by the gazetted officers and the entire establishment attached to this Agency and to the Turbat-i* Haidari Consulate. The questions requiring consideration are :— [a) The scale of pay drawn by the Persian establishment. (S) The desirability of fixing the rate of exchange in view of the appreciation of the Kran and the consequent heavy loss to all grades. 2. The pay of the Menial establishment was, I may state, fixed some twenty years ago, at a time when this Consulate-General was first established in Khorasan. It was then sufficient for and suitable to the requirements of that time. The cost of living has, however, risen enormously, so much so that the price of articles of general consumption and other commodities is at the present juncture much higher than at that date. It is true that the value of the rupee has meanwhile also increased, but, even so, there still remains a clear increase of expenditure. Moreover Meshed at that time was a small place compared to what it has grown to be in recent times and, what with the increase in its population as well as the foreign element and the added facilities for the export of raw products and grain, the rise in prices was only natural. 3. It is however to the last few years that we must look for purposes of comparison and I can state that, whereas I only paid a farrash Tomans 3 to 4 in 1891, it is impossible to secure a suitable man for less than lomans 7 now a days. Men in Russian and Persian employ draw higher pay and are provi ded with far better clothes than our servants, which is obviously most undesi rable. To illustrate the above I enclose statement (A) showing the pay drawn by the farrashes, etc., in other offices at Meshed. This statement shows most clearly that the rates of pay prevailing in this Agency are hopelessly inadequate: and this has been recently demonstrated by the tact that many good men have left our service solely because of the very low rates of pay. In fact, we now have to engage a most undesirably low class of man. 4. The enclosed proposition statement (B) will show the present and pro posed pay for the farrashes and such of the Dak Sowars as are stationed beyond Karez in Afghan territory. We have altogether 28 Dak Sowars between Meshed and Herat of whom 8 are stationed in Afghan territory. It has always been a standing and, I may say, a legitimate grievance with them that they are paid less than the sowars in Persian territory; and it is, I think, only right that this grievance should be removed by giving them^ the same, pay and emoluments as are drawn by the other sowars. The Dak Solars in Persian territory are housed in quarters, the rent for which is paid by Government, whereas the sowars in Afghan territory have no suitable houses.and, in some eases, inhabit insecure and ruined places and are thus subject to losses, m the shape of theft of horses, an instance of which has recently occurred involving much hardship. I would propose Tomans 15 per mensem, on.account of house re at [vide statement (C) attached) to place the Postal Service on one ootmg throughout. , 5. Ghulam and Farrashes—'The Ghulam’s pay should be Tomans 16 as he has to feed and keep a horse in Meshed at his own expense :. so e m argin left for himself is sufficient but nothing more. Two Peshkhidmats P a J has been put at Tomans 12 and Tomans 10 respectively. 1 hey have to 5515 F. Dand no one. two. five. be present at the visits of Persian and other officials to hand tea, etc., ™ '11', of a superior class can be had on less pay. Pay on a graduated scale Is proposed for the farrashes from Tomans 7-2 per mensem rising to Tomans o A mensem This graduation will be an inducement for them to remain in their posts much longer than they would otherwise do. The prospect of a ' tnitv after many years’ work does not in the least appeal to them as it wn,,M to Indians At present most of these servants have their pay augmented by me a* it is so very insufficient : but the attached statement (D) speaks for and Sartanfg—'We have at present one Vakeel and seres Sarbazes distributed as follows: Military Attache Dispensary Office as a rule these men spend the entire day in the bazar splitting wood or encased in some other labour. I propose to reduce their number as below 3 ° Dispensary Tw0 Sarbazes - Office • • • O ne ^ a ^ ee l an( * two Sarbazes, and give thfm pay at the rate of Tomans 6 for a vakeel and Tomans 4-5 for a Sarbaz, so that they may devote their entire time to this Agency. The present arrangement is a farce. _ . 7 Superior Banks. —I now turn to the question of the superior ranks, who are all paid in rupees and who are suffering considerably by the present rate of exchange. It is always an unpleasant task to raise a question which Effects one': pecuniary position, but I think that t -e ma ter^ BO ™ that it has to be faced. I, consequently, attach statement (E), which shows the difference between the exchange at Krans 4 per rupee and at the P'S rate. In this connexion the rate of Krans 4 per rupee has recently been employed by the Government of India in converting the ratton mto persoDa allowances/ (Vide letter No. 2488-P., dated 27 th August l907, f m th Government of India in the Foreign Department.) That this haffish,^ universally felt in Persia is proved by the fact that the 6 F ^ Indo-European Telegraph Department are petitioning the Slc * on the subject: and the employes of the Imperial Bank of P 5 ? secured a fixed rate from their Board of Directors. This rate is Krans 8 . With reference to the Consulate at'^rhat-i-IIaidari,! Keyes, a copy of a letter No. 569 of the 15th December 19 ’ t Actuating It will be noted that he points out the bad results of a &lt; . Consulate rate of pay, which is misunderstood by the Persian employes.^As the^ was only recently founded, the increase recommended ^ 9. To conclude, I venture to hope that the Governmen o _ engaged pleased to sanction an adequate and fixed wage aC utely in (Statement F) establishment, for lack of which we o er grades efficiency. I also trust that a fixed rate may be ? raI J te ^ goth conces* to prevent fluctuations in pay which seriously affect all gra sions might fairly commence from the last quarter ox I</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100055277113.0x000003_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/607/1</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100055277113.0x000003</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/607/1</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 2960/1916 Pt 1 'Persia: salaries of HM consular and diplomatic officers'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1908/1918</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-03-31T09:43:54</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 item (250 folios)</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This part contains correspondence relating to the salaries of HM consular and diplomatic officers, mainly those employed in Persia.The correspondence mostly consists of: letters from the Foreign Office to the India Office, including enclosed Foreign Office correspondence; draft letters from the India Office to the Foreign Office; correspondence by telegram between the India Office and the Foreign Department of the Government of India; and internal India Office correspondence.
