Mornard on the subject of the financial administration of the province of Fars* As lour Excellency is aware the present system under which the revenues of the province are remitted by the Imperial Bank automatically to Tehran on receipt has not proved very satisfac tory from the point of view of the efficiency of the provincial administration. The Controller of Finances in Fars is obliged to deposit all the money he collects in the Bank, and thwif ItL OOiti all tbo~ monoy h ? ^ thn^Bgak. and these deposits are at once remitted to Tehran; and he has no authority to incur any expenditure, even under the provisions of the sanctioned budget, hut is dependent upon the precarious and uncertain supplies which he may receive from time to time from the Treasurer General. This system may no doubt suit the convenience and the necessities of the Central Government, hut from the noint of view of the provincial administration it pi ovou itself highly unsatisfactory. 1 began the conversation by laying before 1. Mornard the figures which I had already submitted to Tour Excellency, sll0W1 ' a £ that, according to th. books of ». I«parial Bank, tbs Treasurer General bad re.itted t. Bars during tb, year 1913-1914 a au. of ‘ tujeans 102,000 (or about £ 13,500) in excess of .bet be aad received fro. tb. province; and that be therefore still o.es to Fars £ 11,500 out of th. £30,000 especially earmarked for the 1 province out of th. £ 300,000 loan of last year; and I also reminded hi. that he had borro.ed fro. th. I.p.riel Bank the s» of t H. E. Sir T*. Townley, K.C.M.G., etc., etc., on etc*,of tomans 116,442 (about £ 20,000) on the security of the i'&amp;rs revenues; and that the Central Treasury had therefore tenefitted from the province of Fars to the extent o; some £ 31,000 during the course of the last year or so. (The real figure is considerably greater than this, hut I confined myself to extracts from the Bank’s hooks as supplied to me hy the Chief manager, vniich can or course he verified). K. lornard admitted the correctness of these figures, and was indeed, I think, relieved to find that I had understated the ease; and he is no douht under the impression that I am unacquainted with the other transactions whereby he has extracted revenue for the use of the Central Treasury from the money lent hy His Majesty’s Government for the assistance of the administration and_ the gendarmerie of the province of Bars. I I then said that in view of the circumstances as indicated hy these figures, and of the fact that a O-esh loan of £ 50,000 was projected hy Eis Majesty's Government, a part of which at any rate was intended for the gendarmerie of Fars, it seemed desirable that some more satisfactory method should he devised for regulating the finances of Pars so as to ensure that the money actually collected, or lent by Eis Majesty's Government for expenditure in the province, should really he expended for the benefit of the provincial administration; and that it had occurred to me that the best way of securing this result would he hy leaving the provincial revenues in the Shiraz branch of the Imperial Hank, m the name of the Controller of Finances of that place, to he tier, by hi. S “ 0tl ”” J ty th. Central Gorenment. Oils simple expedient wnM do a.aj with th, confusion and uncertain., .hich erist nnder th. present and uould enable the Controller t. adjust his receipts snd expenditure, and t. derive the fullest benefit «&gt;, r.v.nnes of the province. After tb. discussion of acme technical points, 11. ternard agreed that this syste. .ight »ith advantage be adcpt.d, provided that the Imperial Bank had no objection hut he hinted that the0 proposed arrangement would make ?ars semi-independent tcs regal ds its financial administration, and would have the effect of diminishing the interest of the Central Government and of the Treasurer General in the welfare o; tue province* I replied that as far as I could see no such result need follow. The Central Government and the Treasurer General would still retain the fullest control over the finances of the province. Ho expenditure could he incurred except such as had previously been sanctioned by the Central Government under the provisions of the provincial budget estimates; and the accounts of the expenditure would of course be submitted monthly to the Treasurer General, and any irregularities could at once be detected and checked. AH that was proposed in essence was that the actual money collected by the Controller should remain in the province, instead of being remitted to Tehran. Finally K. Mornard agreed to my proposal (which I informed Mm met with the approval of Your Excellency), and he expressed a wish to discuss with me the Ears budget estimates in detail next Sunday. During the course of that discussion I hope to be able so to adjust the expenditure of the province (a question which 1 have already thoroughly thrashed out with U. Stas), •including the cost of the gendarmerie as to bring these expenses within the limits of the provincial revenues - reinforced during the current year by at any rate a portion of the new loan projected by His liajesty’s Government. ^ Experience will show whether or not the provincial , sufficient to meet the entire cost of revenues alone wnl oe sum a. administration, inoludinfi the gendamerie, and rt r. n impossMe that a snail additional subvention -a, he .ecpnre i during the first t,o or throe years - especially » • i tho losses caused by the plague of loeusts frm * h ““ ! i, „o„ suffering.

V'M With reference to my telegrams Nos. 216, July 31st. and 217, July 31st, and ?219 of August 2nd will I think serve to show that the Persian Government have for some time been in sore need of money for the gendarmerie. The £50,000 recently advanced by His Majesty^ Government were to meet pressing needs of the gendarmerie in Pars and Kerman. Money has been and will be devoted to that purpose but meanwhile no funds have been found to meet wants of the remainder of the gendarmerie who are twice as numerous in the north as in the two above-mentioned southern provinces. Reference to my despatch No.107 of April 15th will show that the gendarmerie budget now amounts to over £40,000 a month. There is now some hope tnat loan alluded to in my telegram No.21/ may be negotia ted as the Russians have modified their conditions out the financial situation remains very serious. r j[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, j PERSIA AND CENTRAL ASIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [May 4.] Section 17. [19612; No. 1. Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 4 .) (No. 107.) Sir, Tehran, April 14, 1914. I HAVE the honour to submit an extract of the gendarmerie budget for 1914-15,* that is to say from the 22nd March, 1914, to the 21st March, 1915, the Persian year, which has been carefully compiled by Major Steel, military attache to His Majesty’s Legation, from figures laid before the Persian Government by General Hjalmarson. It will be seen that the total estimated expenditure amounts to 553,404L, or rather more than 3,000,000 tomans for a force of 12,308 men with forty-seven Swedish instructors. The extract is so lucid and comprehensive that it is not necessary for me to do more than point out that General Hjalmarson maintains the figure of 2,700 men as being necessary for the Ears regiment, the number of Swedish instructors being increased from six to eight. No mention is made in the budget of the local “ tofangchis ” (riflemen) paid for by the gendarmerie on the Yezdikhast-Bushire road, which entails an additional expense of about 14,000Z. This brings the total expenditure on account of the Ears gendarmerie up to roughly 125,000b, provided that the grain and fodder for the horses are not supplied by the Treasurer-General as he has always undertaken to do, but so far has not carried out his promise for the past year. The remarkable fall in the price of foodstuffs and fodder that has recently taken place in the north, and which may be fairly ascribed to M. Mornard’s successful campaign against the cornerers in this article, is expected to extend to the south this year, and may make the fodder question less difficult. The budget has not, as far as I am aware, yet received the sanction of the Cabinet, but it is probable that it will do so with possibly some small modifications. It is likely that the request for an officer to advise on judicial questions will not be acceded to, because an attempt on the part of the chief organiser of the Tehran police to establish a Court of its own for the swift despatch of petty justice has met with great opposition and has raised a not unnatural protest against the Swedes endeavouring to judge Mahommedans according to the code of criminal procedure in use in Europe. It is possible that some of the estimates are a little high, but on the whole the budget appears to be a carefully thought out document which reflects no small credit upon the thoroughness and painstaking methods of the Swedes, who are possibly a little led astray as to prices in some cases by the Armenian advisers on whom they ha\ e to relv. The Treasurer-General, in writing to me of the budget, says that he has examined it critically and has only made observations of little importance upon it, and has not criticised it adversely as a 'whole. He expresses an opinion that it should be accepted without loss of time, because he considers that the organisation of the gendarmerie appears sound and well thought out. As far as the control by the dieasury is concerned, M. Mornard says that General Hjalmarson appears to fear lest the intention may be to meddle too much in military matters. He wishes to have the entire lesponsibility for all that is done in the name of the gendarmerie. M. Mornard considers the question of Treasury control of the gendarmerie expenditure a most important one, since it entails the handling of 3 , 000,000 tomans, or a half of the net revenue in the hands of the Treasurer-General. M. Mornard hopes that he may yet reach a friendly arrange ment with General Hjalmarson under which a measure of Treasury control will be established, but he adds philosophically that if this cannot be accomplished he will have to make his arrangements to provide the monthly instalments foi the gendarmerie without any participation or responsibility whatever by the Treasury for their proper expenditure.

I HAVE the honour to inform you that I to-day communicated to the Swedish Minister the contents of your despatch No. 31 of the 2nd instant, conveying to his Excellency an expression of your thanks for his courtesy in the matter of the Swedish gendarmerie. Herr Wallanberg seemed gratified, and asked for a copy of the despatch, 4 - 1 .^ Poloo-roma Prvonrl from St Ppfp.rslvnroJi T hnvp fdven before the 1st March. He hoped that this would give Great Britain and Russia sufficient time to arrive at an arrangement over Persia in which the future status of the Persian gendarmerie would be included. ^ . The great mistake, he continued, that had been made in the business by the Swedish Government was in not having at the outset come to an arrangement with Great Britain and Russia, instead of contenting themselves with an agreement with the Persian Government only. He desired again to emphasise the fact that the Swedish Government only desired in this question to act on the lines that suited both the British and Russian Governments. If both Governments agreed that they desired the Swedish officers to remain in command of the gendarmerie after the 1st March, then they would be allowed to do so, otherwise they would be withdrawn on that date m accordance with the decision now taken by the Swedish Government. Herr Wallenberg said that he had not yet said anything on the subject to the Russian Government, but that the Swedish Minister in St. Petersburgh, who was now on leave, would on Ins return to that capital about six weeks hence be instructed to make a communication to the Russian Government in the above sense. ^ &amp;c E.

He said that after consideration of what I had told him on the 6 th instant (see my despatch No. 85 of that date) he and the Prime Minister had come to the conclusion that it would be better to submit to the King of Sweden immediately on his return from Germany, which will be on the 20 th instant, a proposal for the withdrawal, as soon as this can be arranged, of the Swedish officers serving in the Persian gendarmerie. He said that what I had said about the financial situation in Persia had been confirmed to him from different quarters. He mentioned among his sources of information a recently retired gendarmerie officer (not General Hjalmarson) and the Swedish consul-general at Tehran,* who is, I believe, an Englishman. The latter has recently been here, and takes, it appears, a very gloomy view of Persian affairs. In consequence of this state of things, said his Excellency, and in view of the fact that the Swedish officers in Persia could no longer count either upon the good-will of Russia or the support of Great Britain in case of a financial crisis, there was no use in their remaining on there. He asked me to let you know this so that you might have the earliest possible notice of the intentions of the Swedish Government. He proposed, he told me in confidence, to approach the Russian Government in order to obtain for the Swedish officers guarantees for the full payment of sums due to them up to the end of their service in the country, and the recognition of their right to cancel the remainder of their contracts. Though he did not say so, I concluded that Herr Wallenberg, knowing that the Russian Government would not be sorry to see the withdrawal of the Swedish officers from Persia, intended to drive a bargain with Russia whereby, on condition of their withdrawal, Russia would make herself responsible for the payment to them of all sums due to them in respect of their services in Persia. “ I feel,” said his Excellency, in explaining this rather sudden resolve, “ that we have enough difficulties and troublesome questions to contend with that are necessary and unavoidable. Why add to these unnecessary and avoidable sources of trouble ? Why keep our officers out in Persia if they are only to be a source of conflict between us and Russia ? Even though they risk their lives to re-establish order in Persia, Sweden has no interests there, and as far as Sweden is concerned their efforts are wasted.” Therefore Herr Mffillenberg considered it was better to recall them. His Excellency concluded by saying that as soon as the King had approved the proposal of withdrawal, which His Majesty would probably do in the course of next week, he would let me know. His Excellency spoke all through in a perfectly friendly tone and without any appearance of annoyance at the fact that His Majesty s Government could not see their way to giving that full and complete financial support to the Swedish gendaimene which is necessary for their maintenance in Persia. But he showed me, with a touch of feeling, an article from the a Times 5 of Friday, the 12 th instant, in which he had underlined a passage about the Swedish gendarmerie not having been a success.^ He had also underlined a curious statement that Persian affairs concemed puncipally Russia and England (and the Persians),’’ against wnich he had written Obs. parenthesis.” I have, &amp;c.

Mr. Howard to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 27.) (No. 95. Confidential.) a Stockholm, June 22 , 1 ^ 1 ^. AS reported in my telegram No. 12 of the 20 th instant, Herr Wfillenberg spoke to me on that day with reference to the communication respecting the Swedish gendarmerie officers m Persia contained in your telegram No. 4 of the 18th June. His Excellency^ first question on my entering the room was “ AVLat does Sir Edward Grey exactly mean by the first paragraph of his message ? ” This was to the effect that, without being prepared to promise money from British sources, you could not urge the Swedish Government to encourage new contracts with Swedish officers without satisfying themselves that the Persian Government would be able to provide sufficient funds for officers and for this work. Herr Wallenberg said that the Swedish Government had never expected nor asked the British Government to provide money for the gendarmerie. The contracts of the officers were with the Persian Government only. What, therefore, did this mean ? I explained to Hen AVallenberg 1 that, though, indeed, in theory His Majesty s Government were not and had never been responsible for the payment of the gendarmerie, yet in practice it had almost come to their being responsible for their regular payment. Herr Wallenberg accepted this explanation without further comment. He then said that his only desire was to settle this question of the gendarmerie in a way that would be satisfactory to England and Russia, but for that very reason he wished to know exactly what England and Russia wanted, and on what footing the Swedish officers in Persia were to stand. With this object in view he suggested that it would be as well if His Majesty’s Government could come to an understanding with the Russian Government as to the precise nature of service required of Swedish officers in Persia, as regards the locality in which they should serve and the duration of their period of service. Such an arrangement might then be communicated to the Swedish Government, and there was little doubt that it would be agreed to by them. The main thing in his opinion was to avoid any conflict or even any misunderstanding arising between the Governments principally concerned on account of the gendarmerie. The subject had been discussed with the King that morning, continued his Excellency, and they considered that, while no new officers should be sent out, it would be advisable that those officers who had still to finish part of their service should be allowed to complete their contracts provided that the Persian Government kept their side of the contract as regards regular payments, &amp;c. No final decision would, however, be taken till Saturday next, the 27th. If His Majesty’s Government expressed any wish in the meantime to discuss the subject with the Russian Government or had any other suggestions to make, the Swedish Government would hold over their final decision. The only action that had been taken so far was to stop proceedings as regards the ten or twelve officers who had volunteered to go out to Persia under new contracts. When I thanked his Excellency for this friendly communication, he replied :— “ There is no need to thank me. It is in the interest of Sweden to be on the best of terms with England and Russia, and that is why I want to settle this matter in a manner agreeable to both. For this, however, there must be a clear understanding as to what is required of us. I am a plain man of business and like straightforward speech, and have no wish to play at cache-cache with anyone. It seems to me that the time has evidently arrived for a rearrangement in the Anglo-Russian understanding as regards Persia. If your Government care to make use of the question as to the future status of the gendarmerie as a peg on which to hang such a discussion, it seems to me to be a good opportunity for doing so.” Finally, his Excellency told me that the Swedish Government had up to now treated everything that had passed between themselves and us on this subject as confidential, and that he had not mentioned it to the Russian Minister here—but I gathered that he would be glad if the Russian Government could be informed as soon as possible of what was on the ian/s. ■a i r .~ '*'* ■ j have &amp;c YcJ-s-j tC In&amp;l* , ESME HOWARD.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 29.) (No. 16S. Confidential.) Sir, Tehran, June 10, 1914. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith an interesting and valuable statement upon the Swedish officers now employed as instructors for the gendarmerie which has been drawn up by the military attache to His Majesty’s Legation at my request. Major Steel, who since his arrival here has been at great pains to see as much as possible of the Swedish officers, has created for himself a position that causes him to be especially fitted to know the wants, requirements, shortcomings, and complaints of the Swedes. They appear to me to be zealous, hard-working military men who have the success of their mission much at heart, and who have toiled really hard to make a more or less efficient military unit out of the indifferent material at their disposal. It should not be taken to mean from my use of the word “ indifferent” that I would wish to imply that the Persian has no soldierly qualities. Such is not the case, and I believe that the material that can be drawn upon will prove itself good enough in quality when a more prolonged course of discipline and training has eradicated the faults which have been born of centuries of free-fighting, on the principle of each man for himself and most praise to the man who can secure most loot. The work that has been done in a short time - would appear to me remarkable, and I am supported in this opinion by competent military experts, but there is of course still much to be done. Early experience has proved that the dwellers in towns are not of much use as soldiers, and little by little those who have been enrolled have given place to recruits from the villages and mountain districts. Such men are much more suita e for the work to be done, but it is probable that a large proportion of those who have come forward have long lived the life of the freebooter, and cannot be expected to have^ overcome their natural instincts after a short period of from one year to six mont s training sufficiently to resist the temptation to pillage when an occasion offers, as was seen in the unfortunate Kazerun affair, and has been apparent on many mmoi occasions wffiich have escaped public notice. . As his Highness Ain-ed-Dowleh said to me a few days ago, any unpopularity that the gendarmerie has acquired has been due, not to the behaviour of the bwedis instructors, but to the actions of the Persian officers and non-commissioned officers. Serious attention has been paid to the selection of such officers, but it has been found impossible not to suffer from the general Persian vice of abuse of one s position. Persians themselves are the first to recognise that they habitually misuse the power that is put into their hands. This is even more noticeable m the case of the Persians attached to the financial administration than it is to the gen aimeiie. 0 mention the Cossacks, because it would appear to be^ their recognised right from t e humblest soldier to the senior officer, to abuse of their position as if ordered to do so It has also been seen in an exaggerated form m the case ot the Bahhtaans and othe irregulars when used as a military force in Government employ. The feeirng that they are above the law has caused the Persian gendarmes o acts. Time and a larger number of Swedish officers can alone bring a instructors ment that is necessary in this respect. Upon this point I hold the Sweffish mstructois in a measure to blame. They are too prone, when a complaint has been made against a gendarme, to make out that the enquiry has proved the mams innocence ^ ^ ^ most difficult to conduct an enquiry in Persia on account of the fa ^ ATtvLd show of a quite astounding facility for assuring you, with the most f sincerity, that he did not do what he is accused of, even when bqknows quite we 1 that you are aware that he did. The Swedes are too prone to accept the word of men, even against the testimony of persons much moie woi y ’ ., i ea a curious reluctance to inflict punishments at the instigation of ot e , P to do so would lower the prestige of the force. i . i r&gt; qervice in It could hardly be ejected that all the Swedish officers selected for service m Persia would be men of the highest standard, but I am of opinion that ^ [2159 ff-5] .^r-fiPTX' Co • t / ' qs 4 J’J-19142 out first were men far above the average. Four or five of them have particularly distinguished themselves. We have, perhaps, not been fortunate in the officers selected to serve in Fars, but it would appear that the climate of South Persia is not particularly well suited to their temperaments, one at least of those who failed to win a good reputation in the south, Major Nystrom, having proved himself subsequently a capable ^ 1 officer under the command of Major Skjoldebrand, a particularly calm and efficient officer, who is conducting the Burujird expedition with much skill and tact. Major Siefvert, who was a failure at Shiraz, has done good work since he came to Tehran. He does not impress one as having the initiative or resourcefulness of the successful commander, but he is a steady, painstaking officer, and a good fellow of the slow type. The Swedish officers employed in the south have had to work under the search light of Anglo-Indian military officers, who have, I think, been disposed to expect too much from men who are quite new to Oriental life and ways, and who are, perhaps, somewhat addicted to neglecting certain observances which a prolonged residence in the East has taught the more experienced official are necessary to success. It would appear to me hardly fair to expect a knowledge of the language and habits of Persians from young men who have been only a year or two, perhaps less, in the country. It is also easy to criticise the methods of those who are new to the East when one has half a life’s experience behind one. Many faults have been made, and many more will be made, but a retrospective and impartial examination of what has been done will, I think, convince any but the most hardened sceptic of the success of the Swedish mission. That the performance of the task would be easier for the better-equipped Anglo-Indian officer with a lengthy Oriental experience is possible, but, in addition to the obvious political objections to their presence, with which I need not weary you, Sir, it is by no means certain that men would come forward so readily to serve under officers from a nation that has a political stake in the country as they do under the Swedes, who have neither political nor commercial axe to grind. Under actual circumstances there is no dearth of recruits, and the want of money alone prevents the further development of the gendarmerie at a great rate. The crying need, it appears to me, is for officers and good ones. I would respect fully venture to submit that it might be brought to the notice of the Swedish Government that more experienced officers are sorely needed, whilst it would seem to me that much useful work could be done by a certain number of Swedish non-com missioned officers, who would serve as an invaluable backbone and relieve the actual instructor of many executive duties which he can only perform to the neglect of his more important functions. It may be objected that such men would know no Persian. To this I would reply that the four or five Swedish servants and grooms who have accompanied various officers have learned much more Persian than their masters from the mere force of circumstances tha,t they have been continually with Persians and have had no one else to speak to. The question of the commanding officer is also a serious one. I am most reluctant to say a word against General Hjalmarson, to whose hard work and organising skill so much of the initial success is due, but I am of opinion that a better class of officer can only be obtained if an officer of somewhat higher rank in the Swedish army and of a better social standing can be sent. There is no disguising the fact that General ^Hjalmarson has made himself unpopular with his officers, and that what is wanted is a man to whom all the Swedes would be ready and willing to turn as their chief. Such is not the case at present, and the fact has produced a s'ort of disposition on the part of each officer to consider himself as an independent unit acting on his own initiative. In addition to Major Steel’s report, I also beg to enclose a list of the Swedish instructors now here,* showing their status in their own army, a statement of their military training,- and copies of the old and present contracts that are signed upon entering the Persian service.- lor full details lespectmg the estimated expenditure upon the gendarmerie I would beg to refer you to my despatch No. 107 of the 14th April, in which I transmitted to you the budget drawn up by General Hjalmarson for the current year. This budget was accepted by the Government in the usual light-hearted manner that distinguishes their handling of financial matters. The situation of Persian finances is such that it would appear probable Hat it will be found impossible to carry out for the present the entire scheme outlined m General Hjalmarson’s budget. I am not of opinion that the orma ion o a coips mobile of 3,000 men at Tehran is a matter of urgent necessity. * Not printed.although it is a favourite scheme of the Regent’s, and I think that, if the gendarmerie is maintained at about its present strength for a year or two, it should suffice to perform more or less adequately the duties for which it was created. The delay in developing the organisation on a larger scale will afford time to perfect what is already in being, and will give the Swedish instructors time to become better acquainted with the habits and customs of the country before pushing further ahead into new fields. Of course, if money were more abundant it would be eminently desirable that the gendarmerie should take over the Kermanshah-Kasr road, but it is essential under present financial conditions to economise. It is well to bear in mind that the Swedish police administration of Tehran is closely affiliated with the gendarmerie, although performing quite independent services. This force, which has been organised on somewhat sumptuous lines, now presents a body ot about 1,000 well-drilled and well-equipped men who are a great credit to their Swedish instructors. The new police force has already done really good work in Tehran, where the safety of life and property is very much greater than was the case a year ago before the force came into being. The administration will gradually be extended into the provinces, and already a Swedish instructor has commenced work at Kazvin. The installation at Tehran is very complete, although it has been established on perhaps a rather lavish scale. The Swedish police instructors, like their compatriots of the gendarmerie, have not been shy in asking for money. The Persian Government has never turned a deaf ear to the demands of either, probably in the confident belief that the Powers interested in their success will not allow two such flourishing and successful institutions to perish from want of money. 1 I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Major Steel to Sir W. Townley. (Confidential.) Sir, Tehran, May 20, 1914. I HAVE recently had several conversations with the Swedish officers of the Government gendarmerie on the subject of the approaching expiry of the contracts of many of their number. I feel it my duty, in view of the serious situation as regards the efficiency of the force which, in my opinion, is involved by the loss of so many experienced officers, to bring the following facts to your notice :— At the present moment there are thirty-four Swedish instructors on the rolls of the gendarmerie ; of these, three are purely intendance officers, two are veterinary surgeons, while two others are cartographers (non-commissioned officers), leaving a total available for training and organisation of twenty-seven. Of the above twenty-seven, six experienced and capable officers are leaving, either at once or at any rate before the end of the year, namely, in order of departure— 1 . Major Thorell, 5th Kazvin Regiment, at once. 2 . Major Crandel, headquarters, June or July. 3. Major Siefvert, 1 st Tehran Regiment, August. 4 . Colonel Uggla, 3 rd Shiraz Regiment, September. 5 . Captain Nystrom, Officers’ School, September. 6 . Major Skjoldebrand, 2 nd Tehran Regiment, December (January). In addition two other experienced officers, namely Major Moeller, of the 2 nd Tehran Regiment, and Major Carlberg, of the 5th Kazvin Regiment, are leaving at the end of March 1915. It is as yet uncertain whether Major Folke, of the 6 th Ispahan Regiment, whose contract expires in December, will leave or not. As your Excellency is aware, the Government gendarmerie have during the past few months already lost four very valuable officers by the death of Majors Ohlson and Count Lewenhaupt and the retirement of Colonel Nicolin and Major Borell. ^ Of the eighteen officers who it is presumed will remain, there is only one, if General Hjalmarson be excluded, namely, Major Glimstedt, who can be regarded as a senior officer fit for responsible command and who has experience of the country. Two others who may be considered “senior ” officers, namely, Major Klingberg and Major Amden, have recently arrived from Sweden. The first is officiating as chief instructor in the absence of General Hjalmarson on leave until November. He has been selected oi [2159 ff —5] B 24 intendance and account duties, as, though an officer of the combatant forces, he has gone through a course in those duties. As far as I have been able to judge he may be regarded as an amiable officer of no particular ability^ Ihe second, Major Anden, a lieutenant in the Swedish regular army, appears a particularly hard-working, capable, and conscientious officer, but suffers from ill-health ; he is employed on General Staff duties at headquarters. Of the remaining fourteen officers, all are young (between 25 and 30), and only three, Captains Frick, the Engineer officer of the headquarters staff, Lund berg, of the 3rd Shiraz Regiment, and De Mare, of the 4th Kerman Regiment, have had any extended experience of the peculiar conditions of their work in this country. As your Excellency is aware, the financial and other responsibilities of the senior officers of the various units are very great, while the disadvantages in respect of lack of knowledge of the country and the language, under which even the officers who have been nearly three years in the country labour, are considerable, while it has long been apparent that not even the energy and ability which all display can make up for the lack of numbers, which is particularly the case as regards the 3rd Shiraz Regiment. In my opinion the following number of “ senior,” that is to say capable, officers of 30 years of age and over, fit for responsible positions, are required to replace the above- mentioned losses and to carry on efficiently the present organisation independent^ of any increase proposed in the budget :— Headquarters, Tehran Officers’ school 1st Tehran Regiment 2nd „ „ 3rd Shiraz „ 4th Kerman „ 5th Kazvin „ Gth Ispahan ,, 1 1 2 2 3* 1 2 2 Total 14 * The commandant should have the rank of major in the Swedish army. In addition the following number of young officers are necessary :— Officers’ school .. .. .. .. .. .. .. l 2nd Tehran Regiment .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 2 3rd Shiraz „ ». .. _ _ .. .. .. .. 4 5th Kazvin „ .. .. .. ., .. .. .. 2 Gth Ispahan „ .. .. .. .. .. ., .. 2 Total .. .. .. .. .. ..11 I have reason to believe that General Hjalmarson will during his stay in Sweden endeavour to secure the services of officers for the Government gendarmerie, but it is unknown what proportion of “ senior” officers he wishes to recruit or to what category they will belong, i.e., whether officers of the regular army formally deputed by the Swedish Government, or retired and reserve officers privately engaged by the general with the approval of the Swedish Government. It is on^ this question of the recruitment of officers that the future of the gendarmerie, if it is to have any future in Persia, depends, and I think it is right to repeat to your Excellency the very frank expressions of opinion with which many of the senior officers of the gendarmerie have favoured me on the subject. General Hjalmarson is not popular with these officers. They one and all express the greatest admiration for his powers of work and organisation, but they complain that he is not ‘‘straight,” that he is jealous of their social standing, and that he will brook no initiative or independence of action. I hey say that it is for this reason that he has “ privately engaged ” the fourteen young officers who are among the more recent appointments, that these officers are not of a calibre to do credit to their country, and that he will find it impossible to induce regular officers and good officers to come to Persia. Above all, they resent the terms of the new contract under which officers are engaged to which General Hjalmarson has got the consent of the Persian Government, while, as they say, he has represented that the suggestion emanated from that Government. Under the old contract an officer could be dismissed by the Persian Government with a payment of six months’ salary. Under the new contract an officer can be summarily dismissed on the personal recommendation of the chief instructor alone, with no compensation except his travelling expenses.It is of course necessary to receive such statements with caution, and in fairness to General Hjahnarson it should be remarked that instances have not been wanting when it has been apparent to your Excellency that Swedish officers have acted without reference to the general, or not supplied him with the information which he had a right ' to expect. There cannot, however, be smoke without a fire, and I am reluctantly compelled to believe that General Hjalmarson will find it difficult to obtain the class of officer which, necessary as it was when the gendarmerie was founded, is still more necessary now[ when its fate hangs in the balance. Finally, it is difficult to foresee how the Swedish Government will view General Hjalmarson’s proposals : whether they will be willing to send officers to what appears likely to become so circumscribed a mission, if, indeed, in view of their relations with Russia, they should find it possible to send so large a number. The attitude of the Swedish people, too, must be taken into account, for apparently queries have appeared in the Swedish press questioning the utility of the sacrifice of brave Swedish lives for a people for whom Sweden has no sympathies and for a country where she has no other interests.

The point which immediately concerns me is protection of road below Kotals. In principle I favour proposal wholeheartedly, but conditional precedent is some control of conduct of financial agent; Governor is kept by Belgians admittedly and advisedly in the dark as regards revenues and expenditure, and we have reason to believe that the needs of the local administration are being starved to supply Tehran with funds. Neither the Governor nor I can offer useful opinion until Bourgeois is put in his place. He acknowledges no right of the Governor to be kept informed, much less to control expenditure. Governor does not want to spend money without check, but he must be allowed to represent local needs before Tehran absorbs surplus funds, and check extravagance of customs and maliat expenditure. He will, I believe, accept help and guidance from the Resident in discharge of this duty. Finance agent says that he cannot subsidise the khans from local revenues. He may be correct. We have no means of judging. If so we shall require funds. As regards the gendarmes I am on less sure ground, as I have no personal experience of their value. But people are distinctiy unfavourable, and from them I should not draw the inference of His Majesty’s Minister from their admitted local unpopularity. It is, I gather, due to Swedish methods, and not to their restoration of order, which is not restored. I should hope for popularity for British officers, and think fact that there was remote chance of retribution for treacherous murder would render them less probable. As regards difficulty of inducing the Persian Government to pay for force if officered by British, it would appear that force must be financed by loan and also His Majesty’s Government’s advance on slenderest or no security. In these circumstances Persian objections are unworthy of consideration, and efficiency of the force in the south sole object in view. A British officer who behaved like Swedes did at Kazerun would have been cashiered. Southern Persia will never forgive them. 1 feel confidence that British officers could raise efficient force in the south however much the Central Government opposed them, and it is difficult to see how British prestige could be more committed than it will be by warnings in support of the Swedes, who, as far as the general impression here goes, are anti-British in the south and east, whatever they may be in Tehran. We shall thus be responsible for the conduct of the force, which will not hesitate to injure our Persian interests where they are most valuable and oppress our Persian well-wishers should occasion offer.

I considered it advisable, although I was not authorised to do so, to warn the Minister for Foreign Affairs last night of the fact that there is grave danger of the Swedish mission being recalled unless the Persian Government could guarantee regular payment of the gendar merie budget. The step which the Swedish Government appeared disposed to take in this direction was told by me very confidentially to His Excellency, who was very much disturbed, and he said that the Cabinet had been strongly urged by him 'to grant Kerman mining concession so as to secure funds for the immediate requirements of the gendarmerie, but that although he was supported by Ala-es-Sultaneh and Arfa-ed-Eowleh, certain Ministers hesitated. I replied that as it did not appear sufficiently well established that the Persian Government had really done all in their power to make proper provision for the financial needs of this most essential force, His Majesty’s Government was not disposed to furnish further funds, I replied, in answer to His Excellency’s query as to whether I could hold out any hopes of the long anticipated large loan being forthcoming, if the Kerman concessions -were granted, that this would only be possible if Persia accepted a commission of control by which both the collection and the distri bution of the revenue would be supervised. I added that I did not know whether,, even under such conditions, the money womld be forthcoming. I replied in the affirmative to the enquiry from the Minister for Foreign Affairs as to whether I had received a reply with regard to the question of the leasing of the islands in the Persian Gulf, and I stated that the most which could be offered by His Majesty’s Government for Shaik Shuaib, Larak, Henjam, Kishm and Hormuz would be £25,000. His Excellency, whose face fell at this, exclaimed that this would mean a little more than was at present produced by the islands and that he understood that an offer of a £ 1 , 000,000 from a British. Syndicate to buy Hormuz alone had already been refused. In reply I said that the Syndicate would have lost on the transaction as I understood that only about £11,000 a year was produced from the Oxide mines of which three- fourths goes to the Persian Government and that supply is probably not in exhaustible. From the telegram from Government of India it is not clear what the islands are valued at, but it appears to me evident that the Persian Govern ment would not be tempted by anything under £100,000 per annum. His Excellency stated that he -would submit the matter to his colleagues but felt convinced that they would not hear of the proposal and he appeared to be much disappointed.

I fear however, that there is no other course open hut to acquiesce in Uggla s arrangements. I think it unlikely Nasir-i-Diwan will again misbehave. Major Lundberg is now enaged in making final settlement. Ug&lt;’la did not himself speak to Nasir-i-Diwan^ about Governor-General’s supposed double dealing.

Neither Governor nor I can offer any useful opinion until such time as Bourgeo is put in his place. Be acknowledges no right of Governor to be kept informed, still less to control expenditure of money. Governor does not wish to spend money without check, hut he must be allowed to represent local requirements before surplus funds are absorbed by Tehran and check extravagance of customs shade Malyat expenditure. I believe he will accept help and advice from the Besident in discharge of this duty. Finance Agent says that he is unable to subsidise Khans from local revenues. He may be right. We have no proof. If what he says is so we shall want funds. In regard to gendarmes, I am not on such sure ground as I have no per sonal experience which might be valuable. But Southern are distinctly unfavourable and from them I should not draw inference of Minister at Tehran from their admitted unpopularity in local quarters. It is, I infer, owing to methods adopted by Swedes, and not to their restoration of order, which is not restored. I should hope for popularity from (for ? ) British officers, and am of opinion that fact that there was remote chance of retribution for treacherous murders would render such crimes less probable. In regard to difficulty of persuading Persian Government to pay for force if officered by British, it would appear that force must be financed by loan and also by an advance from His Majesty’s Government on little or no security. In these circumstances, objections of Persian Government do not appear worthy of consideration, and sole object in view would appear to be the effi ciency (of) force in south.2G4 a &lt; i . If a British officer had behaved like Swedes did at Kazerun* he would have been cashiered from the • see Encio. i to Semi No. 228 . service. Southern Persia will never forgive Swedes. I am confident that British officers could recruit an efficient force in south of Persia however much Persian Government were opposed to them in the matter, and it is difficult to see how prestige of British could be more committed than it will be by warnings in support of Swedes, who, the general impression here goes, are anti'British in south and east, whatever their attitude may be in Tehran. Thus we shall have to be responsible for the behaviour of a force which will not hesitate at injuring our interests in Persia, where they are of most value, and oppressing our Persian friendlies should occasion arise. Repeated to Tehran. Minister at Tehran telegraphs as follows, No. 129, dated 1st July ;— Begins.

O Connor points out that gendarmerie have now asserted themselves ana that it is owing to the fact of their presence on the road that Sowlet and Kawam have had to come to heel. He is of opinion that, if British officers took the place of the Swedish officers with the gendarmerie, we might suffer loss of prestige of which the result would be far reaching in the event of a reversal, and that loss of life might give rise to most serious consequences. I may add that it would be a difficult matter to get Persian Government to pay for a force officered by us. In O’Connor’s opinion, as a matter of • conomy, the sphere of activity of the 6 See serial No. 247. gendarmes might terminate§ on reaching southern plains, and the Governor of Bushire might be entrusted with policing of road in that district.

IN continuation of the correspondence ending with your telegram to me No. 81,1 have the honour to submit herewith copies of reports regarding the events at Kazerun, which have been supplied to me by Colonel Merrill, M. Rimbaud, and Mr. Pettigrew, of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. I need scarcely say that these written accounts have been supplemented by much verbal information of a more detailed character from these three gentlemen, and also from the many Persians with whom I have spoken on the subject. If it should be decided by His Majesty’s Government to furnish a copy of my despatch No. 10 (or of extracts from it) to the Swedish Government in accordance with the proposal put forward by your Excellency, it is probable that General Hjalmaison, or others of the Swedish officers, may endeavour to contest the accuracy of the statements contained in my despatch. In this event I am prepared to submit for your Excellency s information other documents bearing on the subject ; and Colonel Merrill could pro uce as witnesses many Persians, and also employes of the Indo-European Telegrap Department who were at Kazerun at the time when these events were occurring, vit the object of proving his assertions. I personally should regard such a controversy, as between the bwedish omceis and myself, or Colonel Merrill, as most regrettable. As^ 1 have informe Excellency in my telegrams Nos. 165 and 168, Colonel Uggla is already fully acquam e with all that Colonel Merrill has stated with regard to the events at Kazerun, and with the part which the Swedish officers played in those events ; and as t e comman mg officer of the two young officers concerned the responsibility of cha engmg o one Merrill’s statements, or of referring them to his superiors, would appear to xe wi nm If he thinks it better and wiser to let sleeping dogs lie it would seem narciy necessary for any other person to take any steps which might give use to a c isagreea i e controversy.^^ Excellency or His Majesty’s Government are not satisfied with accuracy of any statement contained in my despatch under reference, eg a ^fy be informed accordingly, and I will then endeavour to produce urt er ev ic ence on e subject.

THE force under my command numbered 112, nearly all horsemen, with 54 baggage animals which transported reserve carbine ammunition for the Kazerun gendarmerie and some 270 rounds for the three cannon at Kazerun. The bulk of the force left here at 4 p.m. on the 1st March. I remained at Shiraz until 11 p.m. the same day to start off the last of the ammunition train. The expedition arrived 1.0'30 P.M. on the 3rd March at Pulab Ginny, a gendarme post about 6 miles from Kazerun. x\. horseman was immediately sent off with orders to try to get into Kazerun to carry to Captain Killander the written information that we would attempt to enter the town that night as it was very cloudy. At P30 a.m. on the 4th March we began loading the nearly exhausted mules, but owing to the darkness and the fear of the chavadars about advancing further towards Kazerun, we were unable to get the last of the baggage off before 5 a.m. At about 7’30 a.m. the column was halted at the last gendarme borge before Kazerun is reached; this borge is within sight of the town and distant from it about 2 miles. From here a point of six men and one officer was sent out on recon- naissance, being followed at a distance of 1,500 yards by an advance guard of one officer and twenty-seven horsemen. After the advance guard were seen to have taken possession of the first hills near the town the order was given for the main column to advance slowly in support. At a distance of about 800 yards from Kazerun and completely commanding the entire town are two high hills ; the road from Shiraz to Kazerun runs close to the base of the southernmost hill, while at the left of the road is a walled garden with a stone tower, this garden being nearly opposite to a stone fort on the summit of the hill nearest to the road. The point was fired at by a few men in the tower of the garden at the left of the road, but when their fire was returned and horsemen sent to the rear and left flank of the garden they fled to the hills, while the urTeZoff t bj a /T men fr0n] the P-nt, while the rest of the point ur^and C T Sed r ° ad to assist the advan ce guard, which had come Kazerun Ref ^ ^ K an fu ^-i! 16 s ^ one ^ ort on ^°P steep hill commanding driven from tfr rea “ h “? l . the last *he edge of the town the advance guard had Bhotswere^ired It rt’ by ^ hl 8 a ^ngchees estimated at 75; several hundred shots w ere fired at the advance guard.

At the time ofour arrival the pillaging of the town and bazaars was in full swing, the air full of reports from guns being fired to open locks. I almost immediately after my arrival spoke to Captain Killander about fixing a definite time for putting an end to the looW ^ and for getting control again of the gendarmes, and we agreed upon one hour before * sunset of the day of my arrival as the time for the looting to stop. Before leavino- Shiraz I had talked to Major O’Connor, telling him that very probably there would be looting, and he told me that the thing to do was to stop it’ as soon as we could and fix a definite hour for the looting to cease, and with this conversation in mind I made my arrangements with Killander. An officer was at once sent out, who returned in about two hours, informing me that he had transmitted the order that the looting must stop at one hour before sunset to all the officers and men in the bazaars ancftown. That night, however, the looting continued, and also continued on a lessening scale oil of the time that I was at Kazerun, he., up to the 13th March. The day following my arrival I attempted to restore order and confidence in the town, for that purpose sending patrols to protect the women, as a great many reports came to me of women who had been violated by the gendarmes ; I asked for patrols from the gendarmerie, which were given, but which promptly began to loot as soon as they were sent out. The day before the different detachments of gendarmes sent out to take charge of the hills overlooking the town had all abandoned their posts to join in the looting. The nio-ht of our arrival the only outposts were those of the army. Two or three days after my arrival I asked Captain Killander if he could not get together three patrols of ten men each, officered by one officer ; he replied that he did not have the men. He finally agreed to get one patrol of ten men. 1 explained that I desired the patrols both for day and night service to police the town and put an absolute stop to further looting and raping. The attitude of the two officers, Captains Killander and Lundberg, was one of “ don’t care what happens as the town deserves all that it is getting.” Both officers remained in the barracks and made no attempt for days to go out and get their men under control; the disorganisation of the gendarmerie and the fact that the men were uncontrolled was patent to everyone at Kazerun. Every one of my statements can be easily verified. Twice during my stay at Kazerun the enemy succeeded in entering the town, both times at places supposed to be guarded by the gendarmes. Day and night reckless firing went on all over town up to the time we Jeft. I personally arrested several gendarmes for this firing, sending them to Captain Killander. To my repeated letters to Captain Killander only one or two replies were received; these letters complained about cases of looting and raping. As far as I know not a single gendarme was punished during my stay in the town. The looting _ fever soon spread to the gendarme posts at Pulab Ginny, Mian Kotal, and Darsti Arjin. Many reports came in of mules seized and sold by the gendarmes. At Kazerun two or three days after our arrival the mule of Mr. Pettigrew, of the telegraphs, which he had brought from Shiraz was seized by the gendarmes. At my request it was released; again in a short time it was seized. ' When I again asked for its release Captain Killander gave the order, but before the owner could take it from the inside of the gendarmerie barracks where it was held a gendarme shot it dead. At my request the order was given by Captain Killander to pay for this mule, which was done by Captain Killander’s interpreter, but the man who shot the mule, as far as I know, was not punished. One day while at the telegraph office and several days after my arrival I heard several screams ayid shots in a near-by house. I sent my orderlies to investigate. They returned with a gendarme who had done the firing and with an old Jew, whose face the gendarme had wounded by beating him with the butt of his gun , the gendarme had also fired at this man, asking for his property. I sent the gendarme, under guard, with a statement of the affair to Captain Killander. I never learned that he punished the gendarme. Several days after our arrival Mr. Pettigrew himself prevented two gendarmes from looting the telegraph store-room. Ihe day be foie we e t, an o woman came to me complaining that the night before a drunken gendarme had forced his way into her house, fired several shots at her, and, when she to ^ if 1 ?,-, 8 e , a daughters, had knocked her down. I sent her with a note to Captain Killander, who did nothing that I could discover. On the 9th March, five days after my arrival, I sent a written request to Captain Killander to issue an order forbidding t e gendarmes o o any firing by day or night in town without cause. He sent me a receip or e e er, but that was the last I heard of my request. To my repeated written requests mr information of his list of effectives for duty I never got a rep y. was una e o gc for days a list of the dead, wounded, and^ missing gendarmes rom ap am i an . Briefly there was no organisation or discipline, nor any a temp , ia cou ’ ^ the Swedish officers to get their men under control to stop the looting and raping a t -the 4th March, or even to assist the army forces in guarding the town against attack from the near-by forces of the enemy. As far as I know, no attempt whatever was made by the Swedish officers to try and find the body of Major Ohlson, nor did they give any assistance after the body had been found by Major Rimbaud, of the army detachment, who was engaged for nearly six hours in removing stones from a well in f order to recover the body. He was not even assisted by gendarmes, nor were ofters of 7 assistance given when I personally reported to the Swedish officers that the body had been found. All of this time the officers were staying in the barracks doing nothing, as they did for days. Captain Killander did go out to blow up a few empty towers, but as far as I know, made no effort whatever to investigate conditions in the town. Upon my arrival I suggested that the friends of Nasir Divan in town, who were known to the gendarmerie to have actively assisted the enemy, ought to be arrested. Complying with this request, Captain Killander sent out Fat-ol-Molk, who, as plenty of witnesses said afterwards in signed statements, arrested only those rich men of the town who refused to purchase their liberty. I arranged for the trial of these men, but not a shred of evidence was produced by gendarmerie against these men. Captain Killander was keen to have the prisoners shot, but I refused flatly to agree unless sume evidence could be produced. Too much credit cannot be given to Major Rimbaud for his gallant entry into Kazerun under a heavy fire, and for his defence of the place before the arrival of Captains Lund berg and Killander; everyone, including Major Lundberg, admits that but for the timely arrival ol Rimbaud the entire gendarme force would have surrendered to the tufangchees. Darya Begi told me that he lias in his possession a letter sent to him by the chief of the gendarmes, Fat-ol-Molk, wherein Darya Begi is asked to arrange for peace between the gendarmes and the tufangchees. Three times were calls blown to gather in the gendarmes from the town, but without result; this took p ace several days after our arrival. For days the gendarmes were not in barracks except m small numbers. Rather than having exaggerated in the precedino- lines, 1 have actually understated the disorder and lack of control of the gendarmes during the several days following the first day and a half of looting. An incident of the trial of the prisoners, which shows the attitude of the Swedish officers was the remark made to me before Dr. Woollatt and Mr. Pettigrew by Captain Killander whfle the trial was in progress, that he would later himself have the prisoners killed e\ en n I released them. After the trial two of the three witnesses against the prisoners returned and said that they were paid by Fat-ol-Molk to testify' as they did, and that actually they had no information at all against the prisoners.

There was not a shred of evidence against a single person to prove what the gendarmes alleged against them. I can substantiate everything which Colonel Merrill says in his report regarding the inaction of the Swedish officers, who from first to last appear to have done nothing to restrain their men, as they were very bitter against the Kazurunis on account of the death of Major Ohlson, with the one exception that Captain Killander him self thrashed a gendarme one day who had been firing shots near the telegraph office.

As regards the looting which took place at Kazerun, it is not correct to suppose that commencement of looting was due to any idea having got about that looting would be tolerated. My conversations with Uggla and others took place after the fighting had begun at Kazerun on the 26th February, and after that date no communication to cope with the situation. suggested.

And will you please inform him that I wish to lay emphasis on the fact (reported in my telegram No. 165) that Colonel Uggla, who is commanding officer of young gendarmerie officers concerned in Kazerun affair, has already received full report of all that took place from Colonel Merrill, and that it appears to me that it is for him to pursue further enquiries into the matter or to report it to his superiors or not, as he sees fit ? He may, in fact, have already so reported it for all I know. As regards my other criticisms of the Swedes, I should like Sir E. Grey to know that it appears to me that, if His Majesty’s Government desire to communicate these to the Swedish Govern ment, I would merely suggest summary of these should be made and communicated in an informal and friendly manner, with object of assisting the Sw r edes to avoid similar reached the garrison of gendarmerie barracks from outside until after looting had begun.Lootino’, in fact, began, as I had foreseen, and as I know from experience will inevitably occur, when troops first enter town after flight of the enemy. I regard this as natural occurrence and not worth criticism. My criticisms regarding the Swedish officers are made, not because there was looting or because they failed to stop it, but because they apparently made no attempt to do so. I think I have made this clear in my despatch. Regarding possibility of publication by Merrill of the true account of what took place at Kazerun, I was not aware that there were orders in Persia forbidding officers to communicate with the press under penalty of instant dismissal; but in any case, as I have already stated, he has no intention of publishing anything. The only thing which might force him to do so would be publication by Swedes, or under their inspiration, of false and slanderous statements regarding him such as that which appears regarding Governor-General in “ Impartial,” and to which I invited your Excellency’s attention in my telegram No. 156. I venture to suggest that, as your Excellency holds such strong views on the subject of communications to the press by the gendarmerie officers in Persian service, it would seem only fair to endeavour to dissuade Swedish officers from repetition of offence. As regards possible publication which might be given of affair, should the course which your Excellency proposes be adopted by His Majesty’s Government, it must, I think, be clear that, if the Swedish Government or officers desire to pursue the matter further or to demand enquiry into charges against them, it will be necessary to produce proofs and witnesses. As many of these are Persians the matter will inevitably become public. Enclosure 8 in No. 1. Sir W. Townley to Mai or O'Connor. (No. 81.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, May 3, 1914.

Copies of previous telegrams have been sent to the Foreign Office.p From Viceroy, 9th July 1914. Foreign Secret. Following is gist of comment telegraphed by Knox on Townley’s telegram No. 188, of 1st July :— As regards proposed method of protecting section of road below Kotals he fully concurs in principle, but considers that essential preliminary condition to this course is the acquisition of measure of control over conduct of Belgian finance agent. Latter at present states that local revenues will not suffice for subsidising Khans, but he continues to keep Governor in the dark and is believed to be starving local administration in order to remit funds to Tehran. (On this subject please see enclosures in Foreign Secretary’s Letter No. 42 M., dated 17th October.) He disagrees with Minister’s view as to effect made by Swedish gendarmerie on situation in Fars and contends that intrigues against them are result of their methods and not to fact that they have restored order, a statement with which he disagrees. In regard to difficulty of persuading Persian Government to pay for force if officered by British, he considers that as force must be financed by loan and also by advance from His Majesty’s Government on little or no security objections of Persian Government are not worth consideration and that sole object in view should be the efficiency of the force in South. He is confident that British officers could recruit an efficient force in Southern Persia in spite of opposition of Persian Government, and adds that it is difficult to see how prestige of British could be more committed than it would be by (? steps) in support of Swedes, who, according to general local impression are anti-British in South and East, whatever their attitude may be in Tehran.mmp t'ONFIDENTIAL. ■Ti Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 1, noon.) g Tehran, June 30, 1914. (No. 18B.) (My 9 A - M -) LATEST reports from Shiraz show that matters are settling down in the neighbourhood of Kazernn, where gendarmerie appear to have at length asserted themselves, whilst measures are being taken to extend their control on the road north of Shiraz. . Nasir-i-Divan is reported to have come in under an arrangement with Colonel Uggla and to have arrested a brother of Ali Mahomet Kamariji, who was conspicuous for his opposition to the gendarmerie last February. Major O’Connor, who is here, is strongly of opinion that the gendarmerie under Swedes should be maintained, in spite of the fact that he has been obliged to report at times unfavourably. He points out that they have now asserted themselves, and that it is due to their presence on the road that itavam and Soulet have had to come to heel. He thinks that if British officers took place of the Swedes we might suffer loss of prestige, of which the effect would be far-reaching in the event of a reverse, and that loss of life might entail most serious consequences. I would add that it would be hard to get Persian Government to pay for a force under British officers. Major 0 Connor thinks that as a matter of economy radius of the activity of the gendarmes might cease on reaching southern plains, and that the policing of the road in that district mi edit be entrusted to the Governor of Bushire. Cox favoured such a scheme, which also meets, I believe, with the approval of Major Knox. Eloquent testimony to the effect which the gendarmerie are having upon the situation in Ears is borne by the fact that all the personages of the region are intriguing against them. There is no doubt that the Governor-General, Kavam, and Soulet are all implicated, and now the latter is endeavouring to get Bakhtiaris to join league partly diiected against the gendarmerie and partly for mutual self-protection against a possible situation which may arise in the north. , , I can control all their intrigues, and am able to place sharp warning here and there, showing that I know what is going on, and that any action on their part hostile to the policy of His Majesty’s Government in Persia will incur my severe displeasure. Thanks to the gendarmerie and the influence exercised_ to-day by His Majesty s Government in Persia it is realised that such a threat is no idle one. (Repeated to Bushire.)CONFIDENTIAL.

N ation of my telegramf 210 and reference Bushire telegram, 691 f facts are as follows. In the evening of 7th instant Governor-General issued official orders to Darya Begi practically countermanding all Merrill has done up to date ordering reinstatement dismissed officers, &amp;c. On the morning of the 8 th at public reception he refused to receive army officers unless they removed epaulettes and badges of rank. Merrill who was not well was not present. And officers in fear of Governor-General did so. Governor-General then proceeded to reinstate dismissed officers, released prisoners, and issued proclamation that any officer who went to Merrill’s house would he turned out of Shiraz and otherwise punished. Merrill during the afternoon sent men to bring away certain records and papers from his office in city, but they were forcibly prevented by Governor s men from doing this. Later Merrill accompanied by Swedish officer went himself to bring his papers. He found office was surrounded by police and soldiers to whom cartridges had been dealt out by Governor-General. Attempt was made to interfere with Merrill, but he took away such papers, &amp;c., as he required. Needless to say, feeling ran very high and it was solely owing to Merrill’s good sense and self-control that very serious fracas was averted. Certain officers and men are devoted to him and were eager to support him forcibly against Governor-General. Yesterday morning ^ when Merrill went to his office he found his papers under lock and seal. He imme diately broke locks and took away records to his private house, as^ he did not consider them safe in office. He is of course perfectly justified in this proceeding as he is still chief instructor and no one has right to tamper with or seal up records for which he is responsible. I had long interview with Governor-General yesterday during which I pointed out to him that by this foolish and unjustifiable proceedings he had destroyed Merrill’s work and had made prospect of reorganisation of local troops almost impossible. If he had serious difference of opinion with Merrill, he should have informed him and Darya Begi beforehand of what changes he Ho £ 5 ; 7, da ii!251 proposed to effect and matter could easily have been arranged without public scandal During interview Merrill came in and I endeavoured to effect recon ciliation, hut unhappily could not succeed. Whole proceedings of Governor- General hare been too outrageous to be easily condoned. Governor-General is now busy replacing old gang of rascals.

Situation with regard to Governor-General grows daily more embarrassing. As I have already reported, he is now in open opposition to European and other departments and situation is notorious all over province. It is in fact now open war between him and attempt at better administration under European direction. If we had only Mukhbir to deal with we might still manage to carry on. But serious feature of the situation is that he is working vigorously to organise public feeling against Europeans and to unite Kawam and Saulet and °other local personages with himself in campaign. It is therefore question whether Persian Government will support present Governor-General against new regime or whether they will replace him by more suitable man. In my opinion we do not require strong Governor here. We want man who will co-operate loyally with Europeans and who will in return be supported by them.

I n £1 TvO WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Vossuk-ed-Dowleh to Sir W. Townley. Your Excellency, _ April 16, 1913. I HAVE received your Excellency’s note of the 14th instant respecting the acceptance by His Majesty’s Government of the suggestion made by the Persian Government and communicated to you verbally by the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs on the 21st February last regarding the advance of 200 , 000 L. and I am grateful for the goodwill shown by His Majesty’s Government in that matter^ I now have the honour to state that the conditions for the security and interest of [2913 e —12]the advance are as stated in yonr note under reply, but the mode of repayment of the instalments suggested by the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs in accordance with the proposals made by the Treasurer-General was that, should the loan contemplated by the Persian Government not have been negotiated by the 1st January, 1915, the , Persian Government would from that date be prepared to repay the advance by half-yearly instalments of 250,000 tomans, thus completing the repayment in two years. The first instalment would be paid on the 1st July, 1915, and the other instalments at intervals of six months. To avoid any misunderstanding I have considered it expedient to put on record these explanations. In your note under reply you have suggested that a sum of 30,000L out of the above sum should be set aside for the financial requirements of the province of Fars. The Persian Government had already decided to allocate a sufficient sum for the expenses of that province, and now that your Excellency has made this suggestion, the Persian Government will set apart the above-mentioned sum for the purpose. With regard to the Bushire customs building, the Persian Government has no objection to set apart a sum of 10 , 000 £, for the construction of the building, and to deposit the money at the Imperial bank of Persia so that it may be spent on the new building for the customs after necessary investigation.

My action in this matter has been based upon the instructions_ contained in your telegram No. 182 of the 11th April and previous teh graphic instructions. 1 have also the honour to enclose translations of the replies received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and copies of the letters that I subse- quently addressed to the Treasurer-General and the manager of the Bank of Persia, advising them of the aiiangement made, together with copies of their answers. In view of the unproductive negotiations that I had already carried on respectino - the arrangements it was desired to make with the Persian Government for the settlement of the questions in the Persian Gulf, it was hardly to be expected that I should receive a more satisfactory reply to the aide-memoire than that made bv Vossugh-ed-Dowleh, In communicating it, his Excellency sent his “chef de cabinet” to express an earnest hope that His Majesty’s Government would not think that the Persian Government were inspired by contentious fet lings or that they did not feel most deeply grateful to His Majesty’s Government, not' only for the advance of the 100,000L, which, it was hoped, would assist materially in the restoration of order in the south, but more especially for their generally benevolent attitude to Persia in the face of recent most vexatious incidents, which had caused the Imperial Government the greatest distress and concern. The Cabinet, Moin-el-Vezireh added, was afraid, in the absence of the Medjliss, to risk the assumption of greater responsibilities than those it bad already burdened itself with. The advance to the gend armerie has raised a question concerning the financial requirements of that administration which will require careful examination. As you, sir, are aware, Ala es-Sultaneh gave me to understand last January that he had ascertained, after consultation with Colonel Hjalmarson, that a sum of 350,0001. would be required to finance the Pars scheme for three years. Having ascertained that this figure was considered to be more than sufficient for the purpose, I suggested that an advance of 100,000Z. would serve to meet the requirements of the first year. Barely a month later, Colonel Hjalmarson produced a new scheme designed to cover an increase of the gendarmerie for the whole of Persia, raising the numbers of the force to 8,000 men, and entailing an annual expenditure of 4D0,000Z. Under the new scheme, the than probable that the project was never examined closely, and in any case no answer was returned. The Swedes taking silence as equivalent to consent, or not being willing to wait the usual six months for a Persian answer, have at once set to work to recruit on the increased scale, and have presented financial requisitions in accordance with the new budget, which would appear never to have been submitted at all to the Treasurer- General. The Government are quite prepared to put a large sum aside for the gendarmerie out of the joint advances, which may serve to supply the necessary funds for six or eight months, but it is hard to see from what quarter the money for the upkeep of the enlarged force will come when the money laid aside from the advances is finished. The Treasurer-General is of opinion that there cannot be too many gendarmes, and is CONFIDENTIAL. PEPSIA. Section 9. [June 2 .] [25138] (No. 110 .) Sir W. Towrdey to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received June 2 .) force to be employed in Ears was raised to 3,300 men, at a cost of 344,000/. for two years. The new scheme received somewhat cursory attention because it was not supposed that it would be put into execution without the approval of the Persian Government, which I thought would certainly hesitate before agreeing to a propo&gt;al that made such a heavy demand upon the slender financial resources of the country. It is more [2948 b~9] B2 optimistic about finding funds for their maintenance. I entirely agree with M. Mornard that the gendarmerie force should be as large as circumstances will allow, but it appears to me that some caution must be exercised or we shall run the risk of finding a force that promises to render invaluable assistance, suddenly brought to naught for want o fl . money. Regular pay has proved so far the secret of their success. 1 propose to go into the whole matter fully and carefully after the return of Colonel Hjalmarson to Tehran, and shall have the honour to report to you farther on the subject. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Sir TF. Townley to Vossuk-ed-Dowleh. M. le Ministre, Tehran, April 16, 1913. AS your Excellency is aware his Highness Ala-es-Sultaneh called upon me on the 11th January last for the purpose of requesting me to urge His Majesty’s Government to make an advance of 350,0001. to the Imperial Government for the purpose of establishing and maintaining for three years a gendarmerie force in the province of Ears capable of establishing order upon the important trade-route that runs through that province. His Highness suggested that the advance should be repayable from the large loan that the Persian Government hoped to negotiate at an early date. His Highness intimated that this money would be set aside by the Treasurer-General of Persia at the complete disposal of Colonel Hjalmarson, the chief instructor of the gendarmerie, and would be entirely allocated to the requirements of public security in Ears, and expressed a hope that His Majesty’s Government would make an immediate advance of half the sum required. I have now the honour to inform your Excellency that I am authorised by Sir E. Grey to place 100,000/. at the disposal of the Imperial Government. The money to be placed to a separate account at the Imperial Bank of Persia entitled “ Tresorier general: Gendarmerie de Ears ” and to be available in monthly instalments of 8,000/. to be remitted by the Treasurer-General to the comoetent gendarmerie officers by arrangement with Colonel Hjalmarson. It is understood that this advance will be repayable out of the large loan when negotiated ; that it will be secured upon the surplus of the Southern Customs ; that it will bear interest at 7 per cent, per annum; and that, in the event of no loan being made, it will be repayable from the surplus revenues of the above-named Customs in due course, and after the previous advances made by His Majesty’s Government amounting in all to 340,000/. have been liquidated. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure 2 in No. L Aide-memoire. HIS Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs is certainly aware that his predecessor at the Foreign Office called upon His Britannic Majesty’s Minister on. the 11th January last, shortly after the dastardly attack upon a party of British officers in the neighbourhood of Khaiieh Zinian—Dastargin, on the Shiraz—Bushire road, which resulted in the death of Captain Eckford, an officer of great promise, in order to express ihe earnest desire of the Imperial Persian Government to secure a restoration of order on the southern trade routes through the instrumentality of the gendarmerie under the Swedish officers. His Highness Ala-es-Sultaneh represented that the matter had been carefully gone into with Colonel Hjalmarson, chief instructor of the gendarmerie, and that it had been established that to ensure permanency and efficiency in the formation of a gendarmerie force capable of coping with the situation a sum of 330,000/. would be required. ^ It was estimated that this sum would suffice to meet all anticipated expenses for a period of three years, and h;s Highness earnestly urged that His Majesty’s3 Government should give yet another proof of their benevolent good-will toward Persia by makmg an early advance of one-half of the money which wold be XdXut of th^ large loan that the Imperial Govei-nment hoped to be able to negotiate at an early date hs Highness added that the above-mentioned sum of money would be set aside by the Treasurer-General ot Persia at the complete disposal of Colonel Hialmarson and entirely allocated to the requirements of public security in Pars on the basis of a budget that had already been prepared by Colonel Hjalmarson &amp; The request preferred by Ala-es-Sultaneh was duly communicated to His Maiesty’s Government, who have expressed their willingness to advance 100,0001. upon conditions explained m an official note from His Majesty’s Legation of even date. In authorising His Majesty s Minister to place the above-mentioned sum of money at the disposal of the Persian Government to a separate account at the Imperial Bank of Persia under the heading Tresorier general: Gendarmerie de Pars,” Sir Edward Grey has agreed that the entne sum should be paid m m one payment, but he has stipulated that it shall be disbursed m twelve monthly instalments of 8 , 000 Z. each, leaving d sum of 4 0001 that can be drawn upon m case of emergency. Further, that money 1 shall be spent under the control of the Ireasurer-General, who will only authorise payments from the same after consultation with the chief instructor of the gendarmerie. These moneys will be transmitted on the order of the Treasurer-General to the Shiraz branch of the Imperial Bank of Peisia to the account of the financial agent, who will in turn remit them to the Swedish officer commanding the gendarmerie of Ears. The monthly budget of the gendarmene of fais will he prepared by the chief instructor at Tehran m accord with the Treasui er-General, aftei having ascertained the views of the officer m command at Shiraz, who will take counsel with the financial agent at that place. It is further understood that all purchases for the gendarmerie in the south will be put up to open tender. His Majescys Government had hoped that, in view of the benevolent attitude adopted towards Persia in the matter of the disorders on the southern trade routes, which have led to assaults upon British officials and seriously affected British trade and of the readiness displayed to assist Persia financially, the Imperial Government would have been disposed to come to a definite understanding with the British Government, concerning certain questions connected with the Persian Gulf, such as the buoyage and lighting, and the recognition of the right of British consular officers to protect certain persons. Seeing, however, that the Persian Government are reluctant to undertake the responsibility of making a satisfactory written arrangement upon the subject, His Majesty’s Government have decided to withdraw the demands which were put forward as a condition of the advance of 100 , 0000 L on behalf of the gendarmerie of Pars ; but in doing so they wish it to he understood that they regard themselves as possessing a prescriptive right to control the lighting and buoyage arrangements in the Gulf, which, if occasion arose, they would not hesitate to enforce. Bis Majesty’s Government also wish it to be made clear that they maintain their attitude respecting the right of British consular officers to extend protection in Persia to the subjects of Bahrein and the trucial chiefs, and that, in refraining from pressing their request for Persian recognition of this claim, they do so only on the understanding that their rights will not be disputed in practice.

I communicated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the substance of your telegram No. 4 of yesterday. His Excellency, whom I saw to-day, says that he only act [sic: ? group omitted] in this question in a way that will be satisfactory to England and Russia, but that he would like to know precisely where the Swedish gendarmerie officers stand. He therefom suggests that it might be advisable that His Majesty’s Government should agree with the Russian Government as to the precise nature of the service required of them both as regards capacity in which they should serve and duration of service. Such an arrangement could then be communicated to the Swedish Government for their consideration. The question had been discussed with the King of Sweden to-day, continued his Excellency, and it will, unless there is any further communication from you, be finally decided on Saturday next. In this case it would probably be decided to send out no more officers, but to allow the officers now under contract to finish their contracts, provided that the Persian Government fulfilled their share by regular payments, &amp;c. In any case, if His Majesty’s Government wished to discuss the matter with the Russian Government as suggested by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Swedish Government would postpone immediate action. All that had been done so far was to stop new officers from going out. I thanked his Excellency for this friendly com munication.

[27234] No. 1 . Foreign Office to Treasury. (Confidential.) Sir ’ txt w. x I • -p. „ , „ , ^ Foreign Office, June 20, 1914. IN a lettei fiom this Depaitment of the 15th lebruury, 1913, Secretary Sir Edward Grey urged the Lords Commissioners ot His Majesty’s Treasury, for reasons therein set forth, to agree to advance in equal moieties with the Government of India a sum of 100 , 0 () 0 L to be devoted by the Persian Government to the maintenance of the gendarmerie force, under Swedish officers, intended to re-establish order in those districts of Southern Persia where British interests were principally involved Their Lordships’ sanction was conveyed in the Treasury letter of the 27th of that month. Since that date, however, a series of grave incidents and the continued disorder in Ears—with a consequent loss to British interests — have convinced Sir E. Grey that the hopes founded on the force in question will not be realised. At the same time the Swedish Government have announced their intention to recall the Swedish officers of the gendarmerie, many of whom hold contracts that are about to expire. In view of these facts Sir E. Grey is considering, in consultation with the Marquess of Crewe, what possible alternative system of organising a local force for the mainteuance of order on the southern trade routes could be devised. In the meantime the situation can only be regarded as extremely critical. Disorder is spreading, and the Persian Government appear to be entirely without funds. If at this juncture the existing organisation, however faulty and imperfect, w T ere to disappear altogether, without there being anything to take its place, it is to be feared that the hall-trained men of the gendarmerie would rapidly melt away, only to swell the forces of disorder and so strengthen the bands of robbers and brigands infesting the roads as to render the task of eventually restoring order even more difficult than it is at present. The provinces of Ears and Kerman would in all probability revert to a state of complete anarchy. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran thinks that a sum of 50,000L would suffice to allow the Persian Government to maintain t'he existing organisation until the autumn, when the harvest is gathered and taxes begin to reach the exchequer. This would give time to consider ways and means for either reforming, strengthening, or replacing the present force on a sounder basis. The Secretary of State for India in Council shares this view of the situation, and is prepared to sanction one-half of an immediate advance of 50,0005 to the Persian Government, to be met from Indian funds, to tide over the critical period. The matter is of pressing importance, and in these circumstances I am to express Sir E. Grey’s earnest hope that, without waiting for the definite decision of His Majesty’s Government as to the necessity of preventing, by means of such a temporary advance, the total collapse of the Persian gendarmerie organisation, their Lordships will now authorise in principle a contribution of 25,0005 from Imperial funds for this purpose, should it appear on full consideration to be imperative to have recourse to this expedient as the only means of avoiding a serious catastrophe. I am, &amp;c. EYRE A. CROWE. Co'7 ; 4 JUL1914 ; [215a H—2]CONFIDENTIAL. r V 1 ii-am 914 _v J t ■&gt; V i Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received May 18, 10'45 p.m.) Tehran, May 18, 1914. (No. 135.) {May 18, 7'40 p.m.) YOUR telegram No. 91 As far as gendarmerie of Fars is concerned, an advance of 50,000L should more than suffice to tide over lean period, and would serve to free other revenues for immediate wants of Administration. If His Majesty’s Government are meditating a demand that British officers should be substituted for Swedes on Bushire-Ispahan road, it would appear to me most desirable that existing force should be maintained until it can be taken over by British officers. Any inter regnum would be fatal. State of road is far from sastifactory, and it would appear from report from Shiraz about Kazerun now in your possession that Swedish methods are faulty. At the same time setback at Kazerun has not been followed by general disorder on the road so far, and state of the province would appear to show marked improvement since last year. I think that trial given to Swedes has been a short one to condemn them upon, and I attribute their want of greater success in a large measure to an insufficient number of foreign officers. Situation would not appear hopeless provided that a really good Swedish commanding officer were appointed and number of officers increased. Annual expenditure upon gendarmerie and Cossack brigade is estimated at about 700,000k, nearly exactly amount of difference between expenditure and revenue calculated for current year. Revenues have been increased considerably, but military expenditure in proportion. Yet if latter expenses are not incurred revenues will fall off again and growing confidence, of which there are reassuring signs, will die a natural death. Two years ago we spoke hopefully of a large loan ; to-day there would appear small chance of such a scheme maturing. It seems to be almost impossible for Persia to struggle back to life under such circumstances. As long as political conditions make it impossible for His Majesty’s Government to insist on Russia carrying out intention of Anglo-Russian understanding, all administrative energy on the part of Persian officials must be stifled, and dual endeavours to assist Persia must fail. In northern provinces and at Ispahan Governor is a name only; the Russian consul administers. Governor of Laristan hopes to be able to take Mohammerah Railway survey through in autumn. I understand he does not propose to use Swedes, though unless a force is created under British officers they must be employed for the ultimate pacification of the country before the line can be built. There is a probability that Swedish officers may be deterred in future unless steps are taken at Stockholm. All the original officers are going home at the end of their contracts and are being replaced by younger men, most of whom are reserve officers. This is largely due to the unpopularity of General Hjalmarson, who passes for a spiteful man who is jealous of social standing of his junior officers. A clause inserted in new contracts under which he can dismiss an officer without a reference is most distasteful and will prevent the better senior men coming forward. For above reasons, and as it is apparent that neither His Majesty’s Government nor Russia is disposed to entrust regions in which their chief interests are centred to other but their own officers, it would seem that there is no alternative but to adopt a system which appears to me to lead to partition in some form. It has no doubt been realised that almost the entire neutral zone is included in the districts in which it is contemplated that British officers should be employed. Baktiaris would welcome them if they did not have to pay for them, but Swedes cannot go there. _ _ (Addressed to Foreign Office, sent to India with my telegram No. 91.)In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No. tk £&gt;7 3 and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. v c V u,rr The Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Undersecretary of State for ^ A and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop v of the under-mentioned paper. / Foreign Office, COPY TO INDIA Reference to previous correspondence: l etter Foreign Office: Description of Inclosure.3opy. lo. 86 • 26793).

(June 19, o p.m.) If the Swedish Government persist in their intention to recall the military mission lent to Persia for the purpose of organising a gendarmerie, we shall find ourselves here m a precarious and almost desperate situation at a moment when the young Shah is about to ascend the throne. •&gt; u I had yesterday most satisfactory proofs that the Shah and some of the more en ightened of his entourage are fully conscious of the onerous duties which await His Majesty, and that he and his younger advisers, amongst the ablest of whom is a son of the late Mozaffereddm Shah, have been discussing seriously and intelligently the qualities of the various public men best suited to form a Cabinet after the Coronation. ,, } 7 aS n 0 r t ^ ware tl11 yesterday that the Shah was taking such a serious interest in the future of his country. Persons who have been brought into contact with him lately, including my wife on her return from Europe, have been struck with the marked advance m him from a fat shy boy to a thinking youth. He also now speaks lench fluently, and does not require the services of an interpreter. I gathered that Shah does not mean to be swayed by the advice of men like Kamran Mirza and the old reactionary party. It would be hard if a boy sovereign who shows promise should be confronted by such a situation as would be created by Jr ^nnA lraWa ^ ° f the ® wedes * Wll °’ and Y hat ’ is t0 take tlieir place, and how are the 7,000 gendarmes who would be left without officers to be controlled? British officers would certainly be^ as distasteful to Persia as Russians, and, I am convinced that they could onfy be imposed on Persia by some drastic measure such as an ultimatum or a bribe in the shape of money to finance the administration. Treasurer- General has often told me that he would go if the Swedes do, as his administration could no more work with British officers than with Russians. I would beg once more to place^ on record my firm conviction that the Swedes can yet succeed ifa fair chance is given them, and if they are genuinely supported 1 hey have faults but they have done good yeoman work. All impartial persons capable of judging the situation are unanimous in their praise of the result achieved when 'viewed as a whole. The only alternative, unless it is proposed to let Persia again make a trial of governing herself by her old methods, is British officers in the south and Russians in the north. Such an arrangement would lead to partition in some form which in addition to many other drawbacks would eventually prove much more costly to British taxpaj er than a fev hundred thousand pounds advanced to Persia at a remunerative rate of interest.

I have received the following telegram, No. 91, dated 16th May, from the London Foreign Office and have, under instructions, repeated it to you: : Not received. Begins. Reference your telegram* No. # # 127. A possible advance of £50,000 to be utilised for Ears gendarmerie is the utmost that His Majestv’s Secretary of State for India and I are prepared to consider. Are you of opinion that this sum could tide over slack period until such time .as revenues come in and that it would be worth while doing without any changes in gendarmerie beino stipulated for ? Even with financial aid Swedes have apparently not restoredI I order effectively, and conditions of Ispahan-Bushire road remain most disquieting. Question whether His Majesty’s Government will not be coerced into demanding that British officers should replace Swedes cn that road is being considered by me. Suspension of survey of proposed Mohammerah Bail way is also a serious question. His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that it is essential that line should he surveyed and constructed as soon as possible in interests of British trade. Disturbed condition of country is the only obstacle. In my opinion, presence of Swedes near Arabistan is, on the other hand, open to serious objections. Question of appointing British officers to superintend the restoration of order in that district for survey purposes is une that should be carefully considered. Will you kindly let me have your views by telegraph. I know the objection to appointing* British officers even for the limited object of keeping any road open for British trade, but we must face this alternative if gendarmerie under Swedish officers breaks down, and we cannot continue to finance the Swedish gendarmerie if they are not effective or likely to become so and reports of their work in the south, recently received, are not encourag ing. Ends. I have to-day replied to the foregoing telegram in my No. 137 as follows :— “ Please refer to your telegram No. 91. As far as Ears gendarmerie is con cerned, advance of fifty thousand pounds should be more than sufficient to tide over lean period and would serve to assist the freeing of other revenues for immediate wants of the administration. If His Majesty’s Government are meditating a demand that British officers should take the place of Swedish officers on the Ispahan-Bushire read, it seems to me most desirable that the present force should be maintained until it can be over taken by British officers. Any interregnum would be fatal. The condition of the Bushire-Ispahan road is far from satisfactory and from a report* • Enclosure of SenaiKo. 28 . from Shiraz about Kazerun which is now in vour possession, it would appear that Swedish methods are faulty. At the same time no general disorder on the road so far has followed the set-back at Kazerun and there would appear to be a marked improvement in the state of the province since last year. I consider that the trial given to the Swedish officers has been a short one to condemn them upon and tlieir want of greater success I attribute in a large measure to an insufficiency of foreign officers. Provided that a really good Swedish Commanding Officer were appointed and the number of officers increased, the situation would not appear hopeless. The annual expenditure upon the Cossacks Brigade and gendarmerie is estimated approximately at seven hundred thousand pounds, nearly exactly the amount of difference between the revenue and expenditure calculated for the current year. The revenues have increased to a considerable extent, but military expenditure has increased in proportion. Yet revenues will fall off again if military expenses are not incurred and growing confidence of which there are reassuring signs will die a natural death.

All administrative energy on the part of Persian officials must he stifled and dual endeavours to assist Persia must fail as long as political conditions make it impossible for His Majesty’s Govern ment to insist on Russia carrying out intention of Anglo-Russian under standing.

In this respect I understand that the Governor does not propose to use the Swedes though they must be employed for the ultimate pacification of surrounding country before line can be built unless a force is created under British officers. Unless steps are taken at Stockholm, there is a probability that Swedish officers may deteriorate in the future. On the completion of their contracts, all the original officers are going home. They are being replaced by younger men most of whom arereserve officers. The unpopularity of General Hjalmarson who passes for a spiteful man and who is jealous of social standing of his junior officers is 1 ugely responsible for this state of affairs.

As I have several times pointed out to Your Excellency estimated cost of gendarmerie alone equals or exceeds total revenue of province and it has always been clear, therefore, that unless gendarmerie funds can be provided from some outside source, we were marching straight to bankruptcy We now seem to have reached this stage and it is, therefore, necessary’to re consider whole situation. In consultation with Stas I have drawn up rou^h budget for monthly expenditure on province as follows Governor-General and staff 2.000 tomans, District Governors and staff 2,000, Police 2,000, gendarmerie and guards for main road 23,000, other road guards 2,000, army 20 000 Finance Department Administration 10,000; monthly total 62,000; yearly total 732,000 tomans.

This sum to be regarded as loan to be repaid subsequently under conditions as arranged between His Majesty’s Government and Persian Government. Part secondly, clear understanding with Mornard and Persian Government that money so lent shall be expended by Finance Agent here in consultation with Governor-General and Consul as in case of 15,000 pounds in first three months of 1913. And also that all revenues from Fars shall be within province in accordance with provisions of new budget estimates as outlined above.

Even iT reasonably effective for particular purpose intended, and apart lorn question of comparative efficiency, the employment of a number of oreign officers anywhere m neutral zone has aspects prejudicial to other l 1 ^ terests . involved, and I have always advocated employment ol tintish officers with local Persian forces both in Pars and Kerman (vide my telegram of 25fch February 1913, and 7th June 1913). Nevertheless, in deference to the policy laid down by His Majesty’s Government, my officers 111 rr, 1Sia ^ lave alwa ys loyally supported Swedish experiment I hat experiment, though at one time it gave fair (or faint) promise, has lateiy proved ineffective, particularly in connection with Kazeroon incidents. .Llieie is little hope of permanent improvement, seeing that present Swedish officers who have gained profitable experience apparently mean to retire on ex P 11 y of their contracts^ and that Persian service seems to have lost its popularity in Sweden (vide Townley’s telegram No. 137 to Foreign Office dated 18th May, and Stockholm despatch of 28th April to same). Thus with an influx of new Swedes without experience and of inferior quality, the troubles ol the past must be expected to repeat themselves. I therefore regard substitution of British officers both in Pars and Kerman as only course [mentioned (?)] leading to establishment and maintenance of security on Southern Persian road. Suitable officers are available and I recommend the following establishment:— (a) Fars gendarmerie, strength 2,000. 1 Commandant of rank of Lieutenant-Colonel or Major, pay 1 5001 1 officer of rank of Major or Captain, pay 1,050Z. ’ 3 officers of rank of Captains, at 800Z. each. 6 officers of rank of Lieutenants, at 600Z. each. 1 Medical Officer of rank of Captain, pay 800Z. Total, 12 officers, costing 9,350Z. a year. (b) Kerman gendarmerie, strength 600. 1 Commandant, pay 1,350Z. 1 officer, pay 1,050Z. 2 officers, at 800Z. each. 3 officers, at 600Z. each. 1 Medical Officer, pay 800Z. Hanks as above. Total, 8 officers, costing 6,600Z. a year. Grand total, 20 officers, costing 15,950f., or, say, 17,000Z., allowing lor clerks, but not for travelling or pension charges. . ^ rea li s e that the cost of British officers exceeds considerably that of the Swedes now employed, but Commander-in-Chief emphasises theM necessity of employing none but the very best officers lie can find so as ir, '“f Ure SU ?, Ce f, S 0 t ,J: he scIleme ' Entes of pay proposed are minimum that will ■attract suitable officers, m view of expense of living, lack of amenities and r ates of Indian Army and Frontier Militia pay.

If meanwhile the financial needs of the Persian Government are so pressing, and if the grant of the Kerman concession would temporarily place them in possession of funds, their logical course would be to make the grant which His Majesty s Government have for so long urged upon them as a commercial transaction of real benefit not only to British applicants but also to Persia herself. I request you to put these considerations before the Persian Government in a xj^ eil vT^- Wa ^’ desire you to avoid anything that would create an impression that His Majesty s Government chose this moment to put forward a categorical demand.

YOUR telegram No. 104 of 30tli May. ! cannot say that Persian Ministers have been making any serious effort to reduce expenditure, but I can assert that the Treasurer-General has been unremitting in his efforts to force hem to do so. It is impossible to eradicate in a minute the century-old desire of Ministers to increase expenditure because the more money spent the better chance there is of getting a share. It has been Treasurer-General’s persistent efforts to reduce expenditure which have caused the violent attacks made upon him from time to time. Y hen the shoe has pinched the Minister too hard he has been oblioed as he expresses it to open the tap.” He has done so, on my advice, because the sort of strike made by Ministers produced executive deadlock. I have supported Treasurer- General strongly in his campaign, but I am afraid he has had but lukewarm assistance from the Russian Legation m the past as to-day. M . . r ^ ier ® ^ as ^ een much improvement, but he has not yet succeeded in forcing the Ministers to make expenditure fit revenue. It is very hard to do so here, where lame sum of money is required for the gendarmerie in order to establish that order which can alone secure additional revenue. Quick to see that they have a strong argument m so doing that the increased expenditure is no fault of theirs, Ministers have never hesitated to sanction _ the ever-increasing gendarmerie budget, reckless of the knowledge that the national resources cannot suffice to meet it. They have aro-ued to themselves in thus acting that the two Governments could not blame them for increasing force which they approved of, and that, if a pinch came, money must be iound to prevent the system going to pieces and return to anarchy worse than that which preceded the advent of the gendarmerie. Surplus shown on last year’s inland revenue and customs was spent before it was collected, and has alone enabled machine to go on without an appeal being made much sooner for foreign help. I propose to submit full report upon the gendarmerie administration by next bao- but I would meanwhile state that I^am convinced that they should be maintained and assisted by us as far as I ars and Kerman are concerned. They must go slow for a year or two, and be content to maintain about their present effective. Unfortunate Kazerun affair was but a most blameworthy incident, and latest advices received here show that despite it they have made their influence felt for good in Fars. The son of one of the leading Bakhtiari khans has just joined the force, and 300 Shahsevans have ottered themselves for enlistment. I am of opinion that the Swedish officers without non-commissioned officers are insufficient in numbers, but I am sure that to maintain bwedes is right policy both in the interests of Persia and of ourselves, as beino- less ikely to create friction between us and Russia, and as being the cheapest courser 1 would again urge that money be found for Fars and Kerman on this account hut that 1 should administer its distribution.

W1IH reference to my despatch No. 102 of the 14th instant, containing copies of telegraphic correspondence exchanged between the acting British consul at Shiraz and this legation, I have now the honour to transmit herewith copy of a report which I have received from Major O’Connor, giving a full account of the proceedings at Kazerun. It is very much to be regretted that Major O Connor has had no option but to report in this extremely unfavourable sense of the action of the Swedish officers and of the gendarmes under their command. Coming from such a capable, reliable, and experienced officer, it is hard to imaoine from what quarter extenuating circumstances can be pleaded, but I would nevertheless beg to call your attention, in view of the gravity of the situation created by Major O’Connor’s report, to one or two special features of the case :— 1 . As regards the looting which occurred after the town of Kazerun fell into the hands of the gendarmes. When I called the attention of General Hjalmarson’s to the grievous mistake that had been made in allowing the troops to get out of hand in this manner, he replied that he had understood from the officer commanding at Shiraz that it had been agreed between himself and Major O’Connor that some looting was inevitable under the peculiar conditions. It would appear from Major O’Connor’s report that there was some foundation for this belief, although, of course, as he himself says, he never for a moment supposed that the young Swedish officers in command at Kazerun would give their men a free hand to do what they liked for as long as they liked, as would appear to have been the case. One is perhaps not very capable to judo-e of the local situation from here, but it certainly does seem to me unfortunate that any idea of looting was tolerated for one moment, and I have earnestly impressed upon General Hjalmarson that nothing of the sort should be allowed elsewhere. 2 . As regards the general charge of incompetency in dealing with the situation, and in making the best possible use of the tribal and other materials at hand. I would venture to again express an opinion that it is too soon to condemn the Swedes utterly as a hopeless failure. There is no doubt that the climate of Southern Persia does seriously affect the nerves of people. General Hjalmarson is quite aware of this, and intends during^ his stay in Sweden to endeavour to enlist the services of men specially suited by their temperament for service in the south. Officers now employed in the north, who were considered to have proved themselves incompetent in the south are, in the opinion of the military attache to this legation, who has been at special pains to watch the work of the Swedes, capable and zealous officers. 3. The unsatisfactory results achieved in the south have strengthened me in an opinion that I had already formed, namely, that the Swedish officers are too independent, both of Persian authorities and of their own superiors, and that it will be necessary to define their position more clearly towards the former, and to carry out some measure of reorganisation, under which there will be closer co-operation between the various units It is to be feared that a perusal of Major O’Connor’s reports will produce a recrudescence of the demand for the employment of British officers in the south instead of the Swedes. That such officers would be better adapted to the work is probable, but, at the risk of presuming to bring to your notice conditions with which you, Sir, are more conversant than I myself, I would venture to point out that recent events have shown very clearly that any such action on the part of His Majesty’s Government would be immediately followed by a similar step on the part of Bussia in the north, and, the partition of Persia would become an accomplished fact. Major O’Connor complains that the Swedish officers show no special desire to further British interests. I have never understood that it was the wish of His Majesty’s Government that this should be the case, but that rather their duty would be to assist trade generally by restoring order on roads on which the trade carried is British to a larger extent than any other. Finally, I would beg to submit that it would be but fair, in my opinion, that the To 1 O O „ . - ’x - , , » “ 'T'T&gt; [2133 u—2] . &gt; JU.'J1914 (Swedes should be given a chance to exonerate themselves of the charges made against them, if they can. In any case it might assist them to avoid making further mistakes if they saw'm what way they are held to have blundered up to the present. Major O’Connor’s report will be read by a large number of British officials in India and elsewhere, to whom such correspondence as is marked “ Confidential” is communicated, C and it is but natural that such officials will form a very bad impression of Swedish officers and their methods, if the charges made against them remain unanswered, for the reason that the accused have been given no chance to do so. As General Hjalmarson has already left Tehran for Sweden on leave of absence, in order to perform his military duties in his own country, I would suggest that the most suitable plan would be to communicate a copy of Major O’Connor’s report to the Swedish Government in a confidential manner. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. (No. 10.) Sir, Enclosure in No. 1. Major O'Connor to Sir W. Townley. Shiraz, April 4, 1914. I HAVE the honour to submit the following account of the recent outbreak at Kazerun in amplification of the various telegrams which I have already despatched on the subject. Before describing the actual events which took place it may be advisable to give a brief account of the circumstances which led up to the present unsatisfactory state of affairs. I have already communicated to your Excellency in my despatch No. 45, and in various telegrams and diaries, full reports of the events which occurred when the gendarmes went to take over the Kazerun-Bushire section of the road last November. You will no doubt recollect that in those reports I attributed the various misfortunes which then befel the gendarmerie chiefly to the escape of the brigand Ali Muhammad, Kamariji, and his band from the fort of Tul-i-Kuhak. These more recent occurrences may also be attributed partly to the same cause; but more particularly to the circumstances connected with the Nasr-ed-Diwan, the hereditary Kalantar of Kazerun. This person is not a man of any particular ability or strength of character, but like most men holding similar positions in Persia he has considerable local influence and habitually surrounds himself with a band of chosen tufangchis. He was, therefore, a person to be reckoned with in the local political situation, and if tactfully handled might have been of considerable use to the gendarmerie. It has, however, from their first appearance in Ears, been the fate of the Swedish officers to fall foul of most of the influential personages in the province, and they committed the same error in the case of the Nasr-ed-Diwan. lor some weeks before the arrival of the gendarmerie force at Kazerun last November, the Nazr-ed-Diwan had been preparing to assist them in their campaign against Ali Muhammad, of whom he is (or rather was) a bitter enemy; and at the moment of their arrival at Kazerun he was actually waiting for them at the village of Dehris, with a small force of tufangchis and a gun. When the gendarmerie force arrived at Dehris en route for Shapur on the morning of the 15th November, Major Uggla, instead of accepting the Nasr-ed-Diwan’s assistance and employing him in some capacity where he might have been of some use, abruptly dismissed him, informing him that he did not require his assistance, and ordering him to return forthwith to Kazerun with his men. I saw the Nazr-ed-Diwan the same evening, and found him naturally somewhat bitter at the way in which he had been treated. He stated (and I believe it to have been the case) that he was willing and anxious to assist the gendarmerie, and that he regretted that they should not have seen fit to avail themselves of his services. When the outbreak occurred at Kazerun a few days later, Ali Muhammad played an active, and Nazr-ed-Diwan a passive part—that is to say that when he might possibly have controlled his own tufangchis to some extent, he appears to have remained quietly in his house, and to have let events take their course. Shortly after the recapture^ of Kazerun by the gendarmes under Major Lundberg, Nazr-ed-Diwan evidently fearing that vengeance would overtake him, bolted to the mountains ; butshortly afterwards he again returned (as reported in my diary No. 51) with the consent of the acting deputy Governor, Darya Begi, and of Colonel Uggla. The whole subsequent trouble arose from this. I had myself, after the first outbreak at Kazerun, strongly counselled Colonel Uggla to arrange that Nasr-ed-Diwan Should quit Persia for a time on a visit to Kerbela or elsewhere, as it appeared certain that his continued presence at Kazerun after what had occurred would lead inevitably to further trouble. Unfortunately, however, Nasr-ed-Diwan was allowed to return and to settle-down in his house (which is a veritable fortress commanding the whole town, including the gendarmerie barracks); and the additional error was committed of withdrawing the bulk of the gendarmerie force and of leaving at Kazerun only a small detachment under command of a Persian officer named Path-ul-Mulk, a Shirazi of good family but of the very worst type. The situation was obviously an impossible one, and could only terminate badly; and I constantly urged upon Colonel Uggla the undesirability of leaving such an important point as Kaserun under the sole charge of a Persian officer, and with a small garrison which might at any moment (as had happened before) be overpowered by the superior forces of the tufangchis of Nasr-ed-Diwan and Ali Muhammad. Colonel Uggla at length accepted this point of view, and towards the end of January despatched Major Ohlson to Kazerun. I have since learnt from Colonel Uggla that he received authority from the Minister of the Interior to effect the Nasr-ed- Diwan’s arrest, and that Major Ohlson was especially charged with this duty as the principal feature of his mission. A few days later Madame Ohlson followed her husband, under escort of a small force of gendarmerie. This proceeding appeared to me at the time most unwise and undesirable. Previous experiences at Kazerun had shown that it was no place for a lady in times of trouble; and, in view of the fact that Major Ohlson was actually charged with the duty of arresting Nasr-ed-Diwan and of the other circumstances of the case, I venture to think that Madame Ohlsoifs journey should never have been allowed. The acting Governor of Kazerun was at this time Darya Begi, who had been sent down from Shiraz with a small force while the November outbreak was in progress, and who had temporarily taken the place of Mazhar-ed-Daulah, a very weak and useless Governor. As far as it is possible to gather from the accounts of the matter given by the Swedish officers, Major Ohlson communicated to Darya Begi his intention of arresting Nasr-ed-Diwan, and the Darya Begi very naturally telegraphed the information to the Governor-General asking for instructions. The Governor-General one day spoke to me about the affair, saying that he hoped that no premature action would be taken and that he might be consulted before anything was done. I reported this conversation to Colonel Uggla, who replied that it was a fact that Major Ohlson had instructions to arrest Nasr-ed-Diwan, but that he would await the arrival of the 7 '5 centim. gun from Mamasenni before he actually proceeded to do so. I agreed that this was a wise precaution and so the matter stood until the 26th February, when the news arrived of the failure of the attempt and of the tragic death of Major Ohlson. Major Ohlson’s plan, it appears, for effecting the arrest was to advance in the dark of the early morning with a small party of ten or twelve men, to blow in the door of Nasr-ed-Diwan’s garden with gun-cotton, and then to rush in and seize him ; and at the same time as the storming party advanced a force of about sixty gendarmes was to take station on the hills round about the house, ready to support the storming party if required. The morning selected for the operation was that of the day upon which the gun was expected to reach Kazerun, as it was thought that the arrival of the gun would put Nasr-ed-Diwan on the alert, and it seemed better, therefore, to attempt a complete surprise before its arrival. Neither Colonel Uggla nor I were informed of this plan, and indeed Major Ohlson kept it a complete secret, and only revealed it to his wife the night before. . . i i • i These various arrangements were duly carried out. Major Ohlson himselt, early on the morning of the 26th February, awoke the Persian officer who was to accompany him, and he in turn aroused the other gendarmes. It is said that a zealous bugler blew a bugle call just before the party started, and this no doubt may have put toe Nasi-ed- Diwan’s tufangchis on the alert; or the plan may have been revealed to them prematurely by some treachery from within the barracks; but however that may be, the fact remains that as Major Ohlson with his little band approached the tower a single shot was fired, and this apparently struck him in the head and killed him on t re s P°b- In the darkness his fall was not observed ; but missing their leader the °t er members of the party (which included two Swedish non-commissioned omcers) tell into confusion and withdrew ; and as day dawned, and a general fire was opened on t re4 gendarmes by the tufangchis, the remainder of the storming party also retreated. Tufangchis now swarmed into the town from all directions, and by midday the gendarmes were practically surrounded in their barracks, and a brisk light was in progress. The Schneider gun arrived a little later, and its escort, finding themselves « unable to reach the barracks, took up a position in a garden (the Bagh-i-Nazar) ' close by. The events which followed have already been described to your Excellency in my various telegrams. On the morning of the 27th M. Bimbaud, who was escorting the Nasir-ul-Mulk to Bushire, and who heard of the fighting when at Pul-Abginneh, rode immediately to Kazerun with his small escort of some twenty horsemen, and succeeded in making his way into the barracks under a heavy fire. He at once took command of the situation, and conducted the defence with great gallantry and spirit until relief came; and it is generally admitted, even by the Swedish officers themselves, that his timely arrival saved the garrison from defeat or surrender. Madame Ohlson, too,, showed much spirit and courage. She was not aware that her husband had been killed, but was in momentary expectation of seeing him return; and she herself directed the fire of the maxims and kept up the courage of the garrison. Meanwhile at Shiraz it was realised thst the situation was a serious one. The last outbreak at Kazerun had shown with what ease a few brigands were able to take possession of every gendarme post which they attacked, almost without meeting any resistance; and we regarded it as certain that the surrender or defeat of the force at Kazerun would imply the immediate rising of the remainder of the Bushire road against the gendarmes. It was at once decided that Captain Killander should proceed as fast as possible to Kazerun with such men as were available ; and on the morning of the 28th he started off with about seventy-five cavalry and two maxims. Later on the same day the reports which we received from Kazerun were so grave that Colonel Merrill consulted with me as to whether he himself should also proceed to reinforce the gendarmes with such local sowars as he could scrape together. I agreed that every thing possible should be done to relieve Kazerun, and myself accompanied Colonel Merrill to see Colonel Uggla, and to discuss the situation with him. Colonel Uggla gladly accepted Colonel Merrills offer of assistance, and gave him written authority to take command (as being the senior officer) of the combined force on arrival at Kazerun. Colonel Merrill from that moment worked unceasingly to organise a small force, and by dint of energy and hard work he succeeded in getting together about 100 sowars of sorts (about one-half of them M. Stas’s “ maliyyeh ” sowars, whom M. Stas willingly placed at his disposal), with whom he started off ibhe next afternoon. Whilst we heard trom Bushire that Captain Lundberg had also started off with commendable promptitude immediately he heard the news, and was advancing on Kazerun from the south, collecting such gendarme horsemen as were available eu route. The two gendarmerie officers arrived at Kazerun on the 3rd, and that same night Nasr-ed-I)iwan, Ali Muhammad, and the majority of the tufangchis fled to the hills immediately to the north of the town, wdiere they ensconsced themselves in sangars. Colonel Merrill arrived on the scene on the morning of the 4th, having a smart skirmish as he advanced, and found the town in the possession of the gendarmes, and of the tufancnchis of some neighbouring villages who had been fighting for them. It is now necessary to refer to the conduct of the gendarmes after the town had been evacuated by the rebel tufangchis ; but before doing so it may be of interest to refer to previous occurrences of a similar nature. Your Excellency will recollect that after the unfortunate Kafrak expedition last May, which was so unskilfully conducted by Major Siefvert, the gendarmes were accused ot wholesale looting and other misconduct. I was unwilling at the time to place too much credence in these rumours, but I afterwards ascertained that they were to a great extent true, and that the gendarmes had certainly behaved very badly, and that the Swedish officers appeared to have made practically no attempt to control or to punish them. Later on, in November, when Major Lundberg recaptured the town of Kazerun aftei the first outbreak there, I telegraphed at once to him on his arrival in the town, congratulating him on his success, and advising him to be on his guard against looting He telegraphed back that ^ the gendarmes are not robbers”; but in spite of Vf declaration some looting, but not much, took place. My sentiments on the subject of looting were, in fact, well known to the Swedish officers, and w r ere not much relished by them. I w r as consequently not surprised when Colonel Uggla spoke to me one day on this subject during the second Kazerun outbreak. I said then, and my views are the resultof considerable personal experience, that when troops capture a town after having been under fire from it for^ some time, it is practically impossible altogether to prevent looting ; that in such circumstances some pillage is almost inevitable, and may occur even in the case of the best and most highly organised troops. I told Colonel Uggla fthat I thought that this fact was generally recognised and understood, and would be admitted in the event of some looting taking place. With regard to the destruction of property also I said that as long as fighting was actually in progress no consideration for the inhabitants of the town should, I thought, be allowed to hamper the military operations of the gendarmes or to limit the fire of the guns. In such cases military considerations are, and must always be, paramount. And I spoke to Captain Killander to the same effect the morning he started for Kazerun, and told him that in the circumstances he would, in my opinion, be justified in taking the sternest measures to repress the revolt and to punish the guilty parties. I also spoke to Colonel Merrill on the subject before he left Shiraz, warning him that looting might be expected, and advising him in this event as the best and perhaps the only means of effectually stopping it to fix a time limit, at the. expiry of which any person found looting would be awarded the severest penalties. I gave this advice to the officers concerned with the best intentions, and in view of the extreme gravity of the existing situation, which, as I have already indicated, seemed to threaten the very existence of the gendarmes in Fars. But neither I, nor I think anyone else in my position, could even for a moment have conceived it possible that the Swedish officers on the spot would have sat idly by whilst their men looted the entire town, and committed every kind of atrocity, without lifting a finger or speaking a word to try to control or restrain them. Matters turned out much as I had expected. Looting began on the night of the 3rd March (or according to some accounts on that afternoon), and was in full progress when Colonel Merrill arrived at Kazerun about 9'30 on the morning of the 4th March. I have questioned both him and M. Bimbaud and others, as to exactly what the situation was at that time. M. Bimbaud has given me a graphic description of the whole affair. He says that as soon as the news began to spread on the evening of the 3rd that the tufangchis were leaving the town the gendarmes left the barracks in a body and began to pillage the neighbouring houses. It was with the greatest difficulty that he succeeded in getting them together to guard the barracks during the night. Early next morning they went off again, and continued a systematic looting of the whole town, including the bazaars, caravanserais, &amp;c. M. Bimbaud, assisted by the Darya Begi and his own sowars, did everything that was humanly possible to protect the bazaar and tbe caravan serais where foreign goods were lying. He spent the early hours of the morning rushing about, threatening and commanding the gendarmes, and vainly endeavouring to get together a few groups of men to act as police. No sooner had he collected a few men in one place than his attention would be attracted to somewhere else ; and while his back was turned the men whom he had laboriously assembled wmuld instantly disperse and join their comrades. The streets were full of flying bullets, as the gendarmes and friendly tufangchis opened locked doors by firing through the locks and bolts, and fired besides indiscriminately in all directions. M. Bimbaud was several times so incensed at what he saw going on as to wish to use his revolver, but was fortunately prevented by his own men from actually killing any gendarmes, although he wounded a “friendly” tufangchi in the arm. Whilst this pandemonium was proceeding the two Swedish officers (Captains Killander and Lundberg) appear to have remained inactive in their barracks, and not to have stirred out, or to have taken the smallest precaution, either to restrain their men, or to pursue the enemy, or to protect the town. Colonel Merrill immediately upon arrival took command of the situation, and proceeded to try and instil a little order and discipline. He posted pickets of his own men round the town, and sent criers through the streets to say that all looting must cease at one hour before sunset under pain of severe punishment. And he took other precautions for the safety of foreign merchandise and to protect the populace generally. In these efforts he was much hampered by the smallness of his own irregular force, and by the inaction and passive resistance of the Swedish officers, who neither then, nor at any time afterwards, displayed the smallest initiative, or the smallest desire to assist Colonel Merrill in these duties. I may inform your Excellency that these statements are not based upon the sole testimony of Colonel Merrill himself. I have made the most careful enquiries from all other persons who are available to give me information, and their evidence is all to the same effect, and varies merely in detads. M. Bimbaud, as already mentioned above, is [2133 u —2] , - ’ 0 i c.r—r to rndva \in a position to give the very fullest details ; and I have besides the impartial testimony of Mr. Pettigrew, of the I. E. T. Department, who accompanied Colonel Merrill to Kazerun, and who was present with him there during almost the whole of the time these events were in progress. And I also have in my possession the original letters which passed between Colonel Merrill and Captain Killander, and which alone illustrates very clearly the marked difference of attitude between these two officers. I now come to the question or the attitude of the gendarmerie towards the towns people, and their treatment of them and of the prisoners. It is a characteristic of the Swedish officers that they always suspect plots and intrigues against themselves, and that they are disposed to form the most violent and unreasonable antipathies with very small reason. I may instance Major Siefvert’s habitual attitude towards the Kawan-ul-Mulk, and the attitude of all the Swedish officers (except Colonel Uggla) towards the Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh. I was well aware of this characteristic, and was consequently not surprised when I received a telegram from Colonel Merrill shortly after his arrival at Kazerun saying that the Swedish officers were all of opinion that the events at Kazerun were the outcome of a plot between the Governor-General, tbe Darya Begi, Nasr-ed-Diwan, and the I. E. T. D. Armenian signaller, Mr. Mackertich (for when the Swedes had already conceived a violent aversion upon totally unjust and insufficient giounds), and that they proposed to arrest Mr. Mackertich, and to hang the Darya Begi. I was able speedily to convince Colonel Merrill of the preposterous absurdity of these charges, which were based upon nothing but the vaguest and most ridiculous suspicions, and were of course propagated by the Persian gendarmerie officers, whose statements are implicitly believed by the Swedes ; and Colonel Merrill, after a careful and impartial investigation completely exonerated Mr. Mackertich and Darya Begi from any complicity in the events which had taken place. Darya Begi was most fortunate to escape with his life. It had actually been arranged that he should be shot in cold blood by the gendarmes on his way down to Shiraz, and preparations had been made to do so. Colonel Merrill, however, in view of my very strong representations, despatched him secretly by night by an unfrequented route under an escort of his own men, and he arrived here four days later, much jaded and depressed, but safe. His execution as proposed would, in my opinion, have been a cowardly and cold-blooded murder, and I am sincerely glad that it was prevented; and in these opinions Colonel Uggla thoroughly agrees. I would ask your Excellency to regard these facts as confidential as no good purpose can, I think, be served by letting them become generally known. I merely cite them as an instance of the almost incredible ignorance, prejudice, and lack of discernment of the majorit } 7 of the Swedish officers. Meanwhile, some thirty or forty other prisoners had been made by the Persian officers of the gendarmerie from amongst the townspeople—some merchants, some mullahs, &amp;c.—including the Vakil-ut-Tujjar, the Kazerun agent of Haji Ali Akhbar and Company, of Manchester, and of Messrs. David Sassoon. But for the presence of Colonel Merrill these persons (the bulk of them perfectly innocent and harmless people) would undoubtedly have been executed. I maintained a constant and voluminous telegraphic correspondence with Colonel Merrill on the subject, and acted as intermediary between him and Colonel Uggla. Colonel Uggla from the first took a perfectly reasonable and moderate view, of the matter, and agreed with me that not only could no good purpose be served by hanging these unfortunates, but that on the contrary such an act of barbarity would cause irretrievable damage to the good name of the gendarmerie. Colonel Merrill presided over a tribunal for their trial, and as I have already informed your Excellency, found that there was not a tittle of real evidence against any of them. He proposed a few fines and the deportation of some who were known to be intriguers and mischief- makers ; and the evidence against two men was, he thought, sufficient to justify a death-penalty—although on this point he subsequently reconsidered this opinion, and refused to have men executed upon what turned out to be false evidence. Colonel Merrill’s attitude aroused the utmost indigation of the Swedish officers (always excepting Colonel Uggla), especially of Captain Killander, who remained at Kazerun after Major Lundberg and Captain Lundberg had left; and the difficulty was accentuated by the tone of the telegrams despatched to Colonel Uggla by General Hjalmarson, in one of which he demanded the execution of Darya Begi, and (if I recollect aright) fifteen of the leading men of Kazerun, and of the headmen of all the surrounding villages. Colonel Uggla sent a pacifying reply to this missive,.andsucceeded in culming the General s wraith to some extent; but in reply received peremptoiy oiders (afterwards reiterated) to levy a heavy indemnity from the towns people. I have already informed your Excellency of these latter telegrams, and would ^ merely mention now that the Generals excuse to you that these messages were only in ^ the nature of suggestion is not strictly accurate. I have seen a translation of the second telegram given to me by Colonel Uggla, and the orders are precise, and as stated above, peremptory, and as such they were regarded by Colonel Uggla. The affair of the prisoners was finally settled by an agreement between myself and Colonel Uggla that they should be handed over by Colonel Merrill to Major Lundberg on the arrival of the latter at Kazerun, and that all should then be released except the Two men whose execution was in question; and that Major Lundberg should make further enquiries regarding the guilt of these two, and should consult Colonel Uggla before taking a final decision regarding them. It need only be added here that there is little doubt that the real reason for the arrest of the majority of these prisoners was the extortion of money by the Persian officers (more especially the Fath-ut-Mulk) ; and that they complain of barbarous treatment in prison. These accusations (as well as many others made against the gendarmes) have been communicated to Colonel Uggla, but so far no attempt has been made to investigate their truth ; and so far as is known no single gendarme has been punished for any offence committed at Kazerun—even those caught in flagrante delicto in the commission of the worst crimes. In addition to the looting and other destruction of property which took place at Kazerun, numbers of even more serious charges have been made against the gendarmes of murder, brutal assault, shooting and maiming harmless unarmed people, and the violation of women and children. It is, of course, most difficult to discover the exact truth regarding the latter accusations, but the information received by Colonel Merrill, M. Kimbaud, Mr. Pettigrew, and others, bears out the truth of many of them ; and it is certain that for several days the whole population of the town, including the women and children, were subjected to the grossest ill-treatment. In presenting these distressing facts for the information of your Excellency I venture at the same time to invite your attention to certain conclusions which I have drawn from them. In the first place I venture to think that it is clear that the whole of the Kazerun situation has arisen from a series of mistakes and blunders, for which no one can be held to blame but the gendarmerie themselves. I would enumerate these errors as follows:— 1 . Failure to make use of the friendly services of Nasr-ed-Diwan when they were freely offered. 2 . Failure to arrest Ali Muhammad. As already stated in my despatch No. 45 , this was in my opinion an unpardonable military blunder, and led directly to all the unfortunate events which followed. 3. Permitting Nasr-ed-Diwan to return to Kazerun and to remain there after the first outbreak. It could easily have been arranged then that he should have gone to Kerbela or elsewhere out of the country, and in that case these later events would never have occurred. 4. Leaving the gendarmerie force at Kazerun for some months in charge of only a Persian officer. 5. The manner of attempting to arrest Nasr-ed-Drwan when it had been decided to arrest him. With regard to this latter point I wish to make a few observations. As mentioned above in this despatch, I had agreed with Colonel Uggla that the arrest of Nasr-ed- Diwan was advisable in the circumstances prevailing at Kazerun, but neither he nor I ever for a moment supposed that Major Ohlson would attempt to carry out this arrest by the rash and unsuitable method which he actually followed. There was no real difficulty in effecting this arrest at any moment when it appeared convenient to do so. Major Ohlson was in command of some 300 to 400 gendarmes, well supplied with Maxim guns and ammunition of all kinds. The house and tower of Nasr-ed-Diwan could have been quietly surrounded by a strong force any night and he himself summoned to surrender. In all probability he would have done so quietly, and the affair would have been over. But, if not, his house could have been attacked by an overwhelmingly strong force, and the result could not long have been doubtful. He was known to have only a few tufangchis actually guarding his house, and on the night of the attempted8 arrest there are said to have been only seven armed men there besides the Nasr-ed- Diwan himself. IVXajor Ohlson, m my opinion, courted death and disaster, and took an altogether unjustifiable and unnecessary risk, when he decided to attempt the arrest of this man in the manner described above. For the sole European officer of a large native force to attempt such an operation as laying a mine and leading a storming party was, £ in my opinion, a wrong proceeding from every point of view. It undoubtedly displayed courage and zeal, and of the existence of these qualities no one who knew Major Ohlson can be in doubt; hue it was certainly rash, and involved an undue risk, not only of Major 0bison’s own life, but of the safety of his force. Moreover, its adoption puts Major Ohlson and the Swedish officers in general in the wrong. The Nasr-ed-Diwan had returned to Kazerun with the consent and approval of Colonel Uggla, and under formal assurances of safety from the Governor-General. Given that his arrest was subsequently necessary (as I think it was), it should have been carried out openly, and if the man then chose to resist he must have taken the consequences. But for the officer commanding a strong gendarmerie force (who had paid him a friendly visit a few days earlier) to creep secretly up to the Nasr-ed-Diwan’s house in the darkness, and to attempt to blow in the door with gun-cotton, is not a proceeding which would, I think, commend itself to a British officer in similar circumstances. But it is in reference to the events which followed the fighting that the Swedish officers have laid themselves open to the most damaging criticism. It is now certain, and cannot be denied, that during the whole time that Colonel Merrill and M. ftimbaud remained at Kazerun, neither Captain Killander nor Captain Lundberg made the smallest attempt to control their men, or to restrain them from pillage, outrage, and murder, or to punish them for these offences and for disobedience of orders, or even to take the most ordinary military precautions to pursue the enemy or to ensure the safety of the town. No general muster was ever made of the gendarmes, and no return of dead and wounded could be obtained for several days after the capture of the town. They winked at the scandalous treatment of inoffensive townspeople who had been made prisoners by their native officers, and at the attempts of these latter to extort money by threats and cruelty. And throughout the whole of this affair, as during the whole of their time in Ears, no single Swedish officer has ever displayed any real concern for the interests of British trade or subjects, or for the traffic on the road which they are set to guard ; and, on the contrary, the innumerable representations which I have made on the subject have either-been ignored or neglected, mules carrying British and other merchandise have been seized wholesale to carry gendarmerie stores and loot, and at the present moment the whole traffic of the road is disorganised, and the muleteers are afraid to travel without a written guarantee from me or from Colonel Uggla, and even these are not always effective to protect them from seizure and ill-treatment.

Mr. Pettigrew of the Telegraph Department called to see me and, in the course of conversation, gave me some account of the incident of which, at the time, I was unaware. I understood from him that the quarrel, at one time, threatened serious developments and that the Persian Petty Officer gave the command to his men “ Prepare to attack ”, when Mr. Pettigrew spoke to the Petty Officer as the Duffadar has stated in his deposition; that the quarrel was then more or less adjusted and that the Petty Officer apologised and offered the Duffadar suitable accommod ation, hut the latter not altogether without reason, as it appears to me, stood on his dignity and refused any intercourse with people who had treated him and his men so badly. 2 . I further understand from Mr. Pettigrew that Colonel TJggla apologised to Major O’Connor for the incident and promised an enquiry and the punishment of the Petty Officer concerned, so that the incident may perhaps he regarded as closed. I merely wish to place on record another instance of the highhandedness of the Persian gendarmerie and of their unreasoning hostility to British interests. It seems clear that in this instance our troopers were exposed to insult and annoyance merely because they were connected with Britain. Enclosure. Statement of Duffadar Budha Khan of the 25th Cavalry, Commanding the relieved Shiraz Consulate Escort. On the morning of 1 st April 1914 we left Shiraz for Bushire. Mr. Petti grew of the Telegraph Department went with us. In the evening we reached Khan-i-Zanian and went to the caravanserai and Mr. Pettigrew asked the Petty Officer of the gendarmes, who w r ere in charge, to allot us rooms. He, however, paid us no attention, but afterwards he and the other gendarmes began to abuse us, principally because we were connected with the English. They also threatened to assault us. I remonstrated with them and later on Mr. Pettigrew told them that, before they assaulted us, they would have to assault and kill him. No accommodation was given us and, as we passed the night outside and rain fell during the night, our kit got wet. I have reported the circumstances to the Consul at Shiraz by letter; so did Mr. Pettigrew. The Consul later on spoke to me on the telephone, and I repeated to him what had occurred. He then told me to report Die incident to the Colonel of the gendarmes on our arrival at Kazerun. I did so and the Colonel said he would make enquiries into the matter. Major Lundberg then gave me a paper and told me to show it to the gendarmes en route so that no difficulties may arise again. We did not need the paper, and on the morning of 13th April arrived without further trouble in Bushire. After the incident at Khan-i-Zanian, we put up in the telegraph buildings en route. t239 Telegram, No. 544, dated the 5th (received 6th) May 1914.

I have the honour to submit the following account of the recent outbreak at Kazerun in amplification of the various telegrams which I have already despatched on the subject. Before describing the actual events which took place, it may be advisable to give a brief account of the circumstances which led up to the present unsatisfactory state of affairs. I have already communicated to Your Excellency in my despatchf No. 45, and in various telegrams and diaries, full + Enclosure No. 1 of Serial Na. 157. ..cl , i, • \ ji reports of the events which occurred when the gendarmes went to take over the Kazerun-Bushire section of the road last November. You will no doubt recollect that in those reports I attributed the—, 224, arious misfortunes which then befel the gendarmerie chiefly to the escape L the brigand Ali Muhammad, Kamariji, and his band from the fort of i al-i-Kuhak. These more recent occurrences may also be attributed partly to the same cause; but more particularly to the circumstances connected with the biasir-i-Divan, the hereditary Kalantar of Kazerun. This person is not a man of any particular ability or strength of character, but Jike most men holding similar positions in Persia he lias considerable local, influence and habitually surrounds himself with a band of chosen tufangchis. He was therefore a person to be reckoned with in the local political situation, and if tactfully handled might have been of considerable use to the gendarmerie. It has, however, from their first appearance in Fars been the fate of the Swedish officers to fall foul of most of the influential personages in the pro- i vince, and they committed the same error in the case of Nasir-i-Divan. For some weeks before the arrival of the gendarmerie force at Kazerun last November, the Nasir-i-Divan had been preparing to assist them in their campaign against Ali Muhammad, of whom he is (or rather was) a bitter enemy; and at the moment of their arrival at Kazerun he was actually waiting for them at the village of Dehris with a small force of tufangcbis and a gun. When the gendarmerie force arrived at Dehris en route for Shahpur on the morning of the 15th November, Major Uggla, instead of accepting the Nasir-i-Divan*s assistance and employing him in some capacity where be might have been of some use, abruptly dismissed him, informino- him that he did not require his services, and ordering him to return fortln with to Kazerun with his men. I saw Nasir-i-Divan the same evening, and found him naturally somewhat bitter at the way in which he had been treated. He stated (and I believe it to have been the case) that he was willing and anxious to assist the gendarmerie, and that he regretted that they should not have seen fit to avail themselves of his services. When the outbreak occurred at Kazerun a few days later Ali Muhammad played an active, and Nasir-i-Divan a passive, part—that is to say that when he might possibly have controlled his own tufangchis to some extent, he appears to have remained quietly in his house, and to have let events take their course. Shortly after the recapture of Kazerun by the gendarmes under Major Lundberg, Nasir-i-Divan, evidently fearing that vengeance would overtake him, bolted to the mountains; but shortly afterwards he a^ain returned (as reported in my diary No. 51) with the consent of the Acting Deputy Governor, Darya Begi, and of Colonel Uggla. The whole subsequent trouble arose from this. I had myself, after the first outbreak at Kazerun, strongly counselled Colonel Uggla to arrange that Nasir-i-Divan should quit Persia for a time on a visit to Kerbela or elsewhere as it appeared certain that his continued presence at Kazerun after what had occurred would lead inevitably to further trouble. Unfortunately, however Nasir-i-Divan was allowed to return, and to settle down in* his house (which is a veritable fortress commanding the whole town including the gendarmerie barracks) : and the additional error was committed of withdraw ing the bulk of the gendarmerie force, and of leaving at Kazerun only a small detachment under command of a Persian officer named Fath-ul-Mulk a Shirazi of good family, but of the very worst type. The situation was obviously an impossible one, and could onlv terminate badly: and I constantly urged upon Colonel Uggla the unde*sirability of leading such an important point as Kazerun under the sole charge of a Persian officer, and with a small garrison which might at any moment (as had happened before) be overpowered by the superior forces of the tufangchis of Nasir-i- Divan and Ah Muhammad. ° xiasir i Colonel Uggla at length accepted this point of view, and towards the end of January despatched Major Ohlsson to Kazerun. I have since learnt from Colonel Uggla that he received authority from the Minister of the Interior to effect the Nasir-i-Divan’s arrest, and that Major Ohlsson was specially charged with this duty as the principal feature of his mission. A few r225 days later Madame OMsson followed her husband under escort of a small force of gendarmerie. This proceeding appeared to me at the time most unwise and undesirable. PreTious experiences at Kazerun had shown that it was no place foiva lady in times of trouble; and in view of the fact that Major Ohlsson was actually charged with the duly of arresting Nasir-i-Divan and of the other circumstances of the case, I venture to think that Madame Ohlsson’s journey should never have been allowed. The Acting Governor of Kazerun was at this time, Darya Be^i, who had been sent down from Shiraz with a small force, while the November outbreak was in progress, and who had temporarily taken the place of Mazhar-ed- Dauleh, a very weak and useless Governor. As far as it is possible to gather from the accounts of the matter given by the Swedish officers, Major Ohlsson communicated to Darya Begi his intention of arresting Nasir-i-Divan: and the Darya Begi very naturally telegraphed the information to the Governor- General asking for instructions. The Governor-General one day spoke to me about the affair, saying that he hoped that no premature action would he taken, and that he might be consulted before,anything was done. I reported this conversation to Colonel Uggla, who replied that it was a fact that Major Ohlsson had instructions to arrest Nasir-i-Divan, hut that he would await the arrival of the 7’5 centimetre gun from Mamasenni before he actually proceeded to do so. I agreed that this was a wise precaution, and so the matter stood until the 26th February when the news arrived of the failure of the attempt, and of the tragic death of Maj )r Ohlsson. Major Ohlsson’s plan, it appears, for effecting the arrest was to advance in the dark of the early morning with a small party of ten or twelve men, to blow in the door of Nasir-i-Divan’s garden with gun-cotton, and then to rush in and seize him; and at the same time as the storming party advanced, a force of about 60 gendarmes was to take station on the hills round about the house, ready to support the storming party, if required. The morning selected for the operation was that of the day upon which the gun was expected to reach Kazerun, as it was thought that the arrival of the gun would put Nasir-i- Divan on the alert and it seemed better, therefore, to attempt a complete surprise before its arrival. Neither Colonel Uggla nor I were informed of this plan, and indeed Major Ohlsson kept it a complete secret, and only revealed it to his wife the night before. These various arrangements were duly carried out. Major Ohlsson himself, early on the morning of the 26th February, awoke the Persian officer who was to accompany him, and he in turn aroused the other gendarmes. It is said that a zealous bugler blew a bugle call just before the party started, and this no doubt may have put the Nasir-i-Divan’s tufangcbis on the alert; or the plan may have been revealed to them prematurely by some treachery from within the barracks; but however that may be, the fact remains that as Major Ohlsson with his little band approached the tower a single shot was fired, and this apparently struck him in the head, and killed him on the spot. In the darkness his fall was not observed ; but missing their leader the other members of the party (which included two Swedish non-commissioned officers) fell into confusion and withdrew ; and as day dawned, and a general fire was opened on the gendarmes by the tufangebis, the remainder of the storming party also retreated. Tufangchis now swarmed into the town from all directions, and by midday the gendarmes were practically surrounded in their barracks, and a brisk fight was in progress. The Schneider gun arrived a little later, and its escort, finding themselves unable to reach the barracks, took up a position in a garden (the Bagh-i-Nazar) close by. The events which followed have already been described to Your Excellency in my various telegrams. On the morning of the 27th, M. .Rimbaud, who was escorting the Nasir-ul-Mulk to Bushire, and who heard of the fighting when at Pul-Abginneh, rode immediately to Kazerun with his small escort of some 20 horsemen, and succeeded in making his way into the barracks under a heavy fire. He at once took command of the situation, and con ducted the defence with great gallantry and spirit until relief came ; and it is generally admitted, even by the Swedish officers themselves, that his timelyarrival saved the garrison from defeat or surrender. Madame Ohlsson, too., showed much spirit and courage. She was not aware that her husband had been killed, but was in momentarv expectation of seeing him xetuin ; and she herself directed the fire of the maxims and kept up the courage of the garrison. Meanwhile at Shiraz it was realised that the situation was a serious one The last outbreak at Kazerun had shown with what ease a few brigands were able to take possession of every gendarme post which they attacked, almost without meeting any resistance; and we regarded it as certain that the surrender or defeat of the force at Kazerun would imply the immediate rising of the remainder of the Kushire road airainst the gendarmes. It was at once decided that Captain Killander should proceed as fast as possible to Kazerun with such men as were available; and on the morning of the 28th he started off with about 75 cavalry and two maxims. Later on the same day the reports which w^e received from Kazerun were so grave that Colonel* Merrill consulted with me as to whether he himself should also proceed to reinforce the gendarmes with such local sowars as he could scrape together. I agreed that everything possible should be done to relieve Kazerun, and myself accompanied Colonel Merrill to see Colonel TJsjgla, and to discuss the situation with him. Colonel Uggla gladly accepted Colonel Merrill’s offer of asistance, and gave him written authority to take command (as being the senior officer) of the combined force on arrival at Kazerun. Colonel Merrill from that moment worked unceasingly to organise a small force, and by dint of energy and hard work he succeeded in getting together about 100 sowars of sorts (about one half of them M. Stas’ malivveh sowars, whom M. Stas willingly placed at his disposal) wuth whom he started off the next afternoon. Whilst we heard from Bushire that Captain Lundberg had also started off with commendable promptitude immediately he heard the news, and was advancing on Kazerun from the south collecting such gendar merie horsemen as were available en route. The tw r o gendarmerie officers arrived at Kazerun on the 3rd, and that same night Nasir-i-Divan, Ali Muhammad, and the majority of the tufangchis fled to the hills immediately to the north of the towm wiiere they ensconced themselves in sangars. Colonel Merrill arrived on the scene on the morning of the 4th, having a smart skirmish as he advanced, and found the town in the possession of the gendarmes, and of the tufangchis of some neighbouring villages who had been lighting for them. It is now necessary to refer to the conduct of the gendarmes after the town had been evacuated by the reb^l tufangchis; but before doing so it may be of interest to refer to previous occurrences of a similar nature. Your Excellency will recollect that after the unfortunate Kafrak expedi tion last May, which w 7 as so unskilfully conducted by Major Siefvert, the gendarmes were accused of wholesale looting and other misconduct. I was unwilling at the time to place too much credence in these rumours, but I afterwards ascertained that they were to a great extent true, and that the gendarmes had certainly behaved very badly, and that the Swedish officers appeared to have made practically no attempt to control or to punish them. Later on, in November, when Major Lundberg recaptured the town of Kazerun after the first outbreak there, I telegraphed at once to him on his arrival in the town, congratulating him on his success, and advising him to be on his guard against looting. He telegraphed back that “ the gendarmes are not robbers ” ; but in spite of this declaration some looting—but not i much—took place. My sentiments on the subject of looting were, in fact, well knowu to the Swodish officers, and were not much relished by them. I was consequently not surprised when Colonel Uggla spoke to me one day on this subject during the second Kazerun outbreak. I said then, and my views are the result of considerable personal experience, that when troops capture a town after having been under fire from it for some time, it is practically impossible altogether to prevent looting; that in such circum stances some pillage is almost inevitable, and may occur even in the case of the best and most highly organised troops. I told Colonel Uggla that I thought that this fact was generally recognised and understood, and w r ould be admitted in the event of some looting taking place. With regard to the destruction of property also I said that as long as fighting was actually in227 n progress no consideration for the inhabitants of the town should, I thought, be allowed to hamper the military operations of the gendarmes or to limit the fire of the guns. In such cases military considerations are, and must always be, paramount. And I spoke to Captain Killander to the same effect the morning he started for Kazerun, and told him that in the circumstances he would in mv opinion be justified in taking the sternest measures to repress the revolt and to* punish the guilty parties. I also spoke to Colonel Merrill on the subject before he left Shiraz, warning him that looting might be expected, and advising him in this event as the best and perhaps the only means of effectually stopping it, to fix a time limit at the expiry of which any person found looting would be awarded the severest penalties. I gave this advice to the officers concerned with the best intentions, and in view of the extreme gravity of the existing situation, which, as I have already indicated seemed to threaten the very existence of the gendarmes in Ifars. But neither I, nor I think any one else in my position, could even for a moment have conceived it possible that the Swedish officers on the spot would have sat idly by whilst their men looted the entire town, and com mitted every kind of atrocity, without lifting a finger, or speaking a word, to try to control or restrain them. 1 Matters turned out much as I had expected. Looting began on the night of the 23rd February (or according to some accounts on that afternoon), and was in full progress when Colonel Merrill arrived at Kazerun about 9-30 on the morning of the 24th. I have questioned both him, and M. Bimbaud, and others, as to exactly what the situation was at that time. M. Rimbaud has given me a graphic description of the whole affair. He says that as soon as the news began to spread on the evening of the 23rd that the tufangchis were leaving the town, the gendarmes left the barracks in a body and began to pillage the neighbouring houses. It was with the greatest difficulty that he succeeded in getting them together to guard the barracks during the night. Early next morning they went off a^rain, and continued a systematic looting of the whole town—including the bazars, caravanserais, etc. M. Rimbaud, assisted by the Darya Begi and his own sowars, did everything that was humanly possible to protect the bazar and the caravanserais where foreign goods were lying. He spent the early hours of the morning rushing about, threatening and commanding the gendarmes, and vainly endeavouring to get together a few groups of men to act as police. No sooner had he collected a few men in one place than his attention would be attracted to somewheie else j and while bis back was turned the men whom he had laboriously assembled would instantly disperse and join their comrades. The stieets weie full of flying bullets, as the gendarmes and friendly tufangchis opened locked doors by firing through the locks and bolts, and fired besides indiscriminately in all directions. M. Rimbaud was several times so incensed at what he saw- going on as to wish to use his revolver, but was fortunately prevented by his own men from actually killing any gendarmes, although he wounded a “friendly ” tufangchi in the arm. Whilst this pandemonium uas proceeding the two Swedish officers (Captains Ivillander and Lundberg) appear to have remained inactive in their barracks, and not to have stirred ont, or to ha\e taken the smallest precaution either to restrain their men, or to pursue the enemy, or to protect the towm. Colonel Merrill immediately upon arrival took command of the situation, and proceeded to try and instil a little order and discipline. He posted pickets of his own men round the town, and sent criers through the streets to say that all looting must cease at one hour before sunset under pain of severe punishment. And he took other precautions for the safety of foreign merchandise and to protect the populace generally. In these efforts he was much hampered by the smallness of his own irregular force, and oy the inaction and passive resistance of the Swedish officers, who neither then, nor at any * time afterwards, displayed the smallest initiative, or the smallest osire to | assist Colonel Merrill in these duties. I may inform Your Excellency that these statements are not based upon [ the sole testimony of Colonel Merrill himself. I have made the most careful enquiries from ail other persons who are available to give me information, and228 their evidence is all to the same effect, and varies merely in details. M. Rimbaud, as already mentioned above, is in a position to give the very fullest details; and I have besides the impartial tesimony of Mr. Pettigrew of the Indo-European Telegraph Department who accompanied Colonel Merrill to Kazerun, and who was present with him there during almost the whole of the time these events were in progress. And I also have in my possession the original letters which passed between Colonel Merrill and Captain Killander, and which alone illustrate very clearly the marked difference of attitude between these two officers. I now come to the question of the attitude of the gendarmerie towards the townspeople, and their treatment of them and of the prisoners. It is a characteristic of the Swedish officers that they always suspect plots and intrigues against themselves, and that they are disposed to form the most violent and unreasonable antipathies with very small reason. I may instance Major Siefvert’s habitual attitude towards the Kawam-ul-Mulk and the attitude of all the Swedish officers (except Colonel Uggla) towards the Mukhbir-es-Sultanek. I was well aware of this characteristic, and was conse quently not surprised when I received a telegram from Colonel Merrill shortly after his arrival at Kazerun saying that the Swedish officers were all of opinion that the events at Kazerun were the outcome of a plot between the Governor-General, the Darya Eegi, Nasir-i-Divan, and the Indo-European Telegraph Department Armenian signaller, Mr. Mackertich (for whom the Swedes had already conceived a violent aversion upon totally unjust and insufficient grounds); and that they proposed to arrest Mr. Makertich, and to hang the Darya Begi. I was able speedily to convince Colonel Merrill of the preposterous absurdity of these charges, which were based upon nothing but the vaguest and most ridiculous suspicions, and were of course propagated by the Persian gendarmerie officers whose statements are implicitly believed by the Swedes; and Colonel Merrill after a careful and impartial investigation completely exonerated Mr. Mackertich and Darya Begi from any complicity in the events which had taken place. Darya Begi was most fortunate to escape with his life. It had actually been arranged that he should be shot in cold blood by the gendarmes on his way down to Shiraz, and preparations had been made to do so. Colonel Merrill, however, in view of my very strong representations, despatched him secretly by night by an unfrequented route under an escort of his own men and he arrived here four days later, much jaded and depressed, but safe. His execution as proposed would, in my opinion, have been a cowardly and cold blooded murder, and I am sincerely glad that it was prevented; and in these opinions Colonel TJggla thoroughly agrees. I would ask Your Excellency to regard these facts as confidential as no good purpose can, I think, be served by letting them become generally known. I merely cite them as an instance ot the almost incredible ignorance, prejudice, and lack of discernment of the majority of the Swedish officers. Meanwhile some thirty or forty other prisoners had been made by the Persian officers of the gendarmerie from amongst the townspeople—some merchants, some mullas, &amp;c.—including the Yakil-ut-Tujjar, the Kazerun Agent ot Haji All Akhbar and Company of Manchester, and of Messrs. David Sassoon. But for the presence of Colonel Merrill these persons (the bulk of them perfectly innocent and harmless people) would undoubtedly have been executed. main ame a constant and voluminous telegraphic correspondence with Colonel Merrill on the subject, and acted as intermediary between him and Colonel a, p ° one from the first took a perfectly reasonable and moderate view ot the matter, and agreed with me that not only could no good purpose be serve y angmg these unfortunates, but that on the contrary such an act of barbarity would cause irretrievable damage to the good name of the gendar- mene. Colonel Merrill presided over a tribunal for their trial, and as I have already informed Your Excellency, found that there was not a tittle of real evi ence against any of them. He proposed a few fines and the deportation ofsome who were known to be intriguers and mischief-makers; and the evidence against two men was, he thought, sufficient to justify a death penalty—although J on this point he subsequently reconsidered this opinion, and refused to have men executed upon what turned out to be false evidence. Colonel Merrill’s attitude aroused the utmost indignation of the Swedish officers (always excepting Colonel Fggla), especially of Captain Killander, who remained at Kazerun after Major Lundberg and Captain Lundberg had left; and the difficulty ,was accentuated by the tone of the tele°*rams despatched to Colonel Uggla by General Hjalmarson, in one of which he ! demanded the execution of Darya Begi, and (if I recollect aright) 15 of the leading men of Kazerun, and of the headmen of all the surrounding villages. Colonel Uggla sent a pacifying reply to this missive, and succeeded in calming the General s wrath to some extent; but in reply received peremptory orders (afterwards reiterated) to levy a heavy indemnity from the townspeople. I have already informed Your Excellency of these latter telegrams, and would merely mention now that the General’s excuse to you that these messages were only in the nature of suggestions is not strictly accurate. I have seen a translation of the second telegram given to me by Colonel Uggla, and the orders are precise, and as stated above, peremptory—and as such they were regarded by Colonel Uggla. The affair of the prisoners was finally settled by an agreement between myself and Colonel Uggla that they should be handed over by Colonel Merrill to Major Lundberg on the arrival of the latter at Kazerun, and that all should then be released except the two men whose execution was in question; and that Major Lundberg should make further enquiries regarding the guilt of these two, and should consult Colonel Uggla before taking a final decision regarding them. It need only be added here that there is little doubt that the real reason for the arrest of the majority of the prisoners was the extortion of money by the Persian officers (more especially the Path-ul-Mulk); and that they com plain of barbarous treatment in prison. These accusations (as well as many others made against the gendarmes) have been communicated to Colonel Uggla, but so far no attempt has been made to investigate their truth; and so far as is known no single gendarme has been punished for any offence committed at Kazerun—even those caught flagrante delictu in the commission of the worst crimes. In addition to the looting and other destruction of property which took place at Kazerun, numbers of even more serious charges have been made qgainst the gendarmes of murder, brutal assault, shooting and maiming harmless unarmed people, and the violation of women and children. It is of course most difficult to discover the exact truth regarding the latter accusations, but the information received by Colonel Merrill, M. Rimbaud, Mr. Pettigrew, and others, bears out the truth of many of them; and it is certain that for several days the whole population of the town, including the women and children, were subjected to the grossest ill-treatment. \ In presenting these distressing facts for the information of Your Excel lency, I venture at the same time to invite your attention to certain conclusions which I have drawn from them. In the first place, I venture to think that it is clear that the whole of the Kazerun situation has arisen from a series of mistakes and blunders, for which no one can be held to blame but the gendarmerie themselves. I would enumerate these errors as follows :— First .—Failure to make use of the friendly services of Nasir-i-Divan when they were freely offered. Second .—Failure to arrest Ali Muhammad. As already stated in my • Enclosure i of Serial No 157 . despatch* No 45, this was in my opinion an unpardonable military blunder, and led directly to all the unfortunate events which followed. Third .—Permitting Nasir-i-Divan to return to Kazerun and to remain there after the first outbreak. It could easily have been arranged then that230 he should have gone to Kerbela or elsewhere out of the country, and in that case these later events would never have occurred. Fourth .—Leaving the gendarmerie force at Kazernn for some months in charge of only a Persian officer. Fifth .—The manner of attempting to arrest Nasir-i-Divan when it had With regard to this latter point I wish to make a few observations. As mentioned above in this despatch, I had agreed with Colonel Uggla that the arrest of Nasir-i-Divan was advisable in the circumstances prevailing at Kazerun, but neither he nor 1 ever for a moment supposed that Major Ohlsson would attempt to carry out this arrest by the rash and unsuitable method which he actually followed. There was no real difficulty in effecting this arrest at any moment when it appeared convenient to do so. Major Ohlsson was in com mand of some 300 to 400 gendarmes well supplied with maxim guns and am munition of all kinds. The house and tower of Nasir-i-Divan could have been quietly surrounded by a strong force any night, and he himself summoned to surrender. In all probability he would have done so quietly, and the affair would have been over. But if not his house could have been attacked by an overwhelmingly strong force, and the result could not long have been doubtful. He was known to have only a few tufangchis actually guarding S his house, and on the night of the attempted arrest there are said to have been only seven armed men there besides the Nasir-i-Divan himself. Major Ohlsson, in my opinion, courted death and disaster, and took an alto gether unjustifiable and unnecessary risk, when he decided to attempt the arrest of this man in the manner described above. For the sole European officer of a large native force to attempt such an operation as laying a mine and leading a storming party was, in my opinion, a wrong proceeding from every point of view. It undoubtedly displayed courage and zeal, and of the existence of these qualities no one who knew Major Ohlsson can be in doubt; but it was certainly rash, and involved an undue risk, not only of Major I Ohlsson’s own life, but of the safety of his force. Moreover its adoption puts Major Ohlsson and the Swedish officers in general in the wrong. The Nasir-i- Divan had returned to Kazerun with the consent and approval of Colonel TJggla, and under formal assurances of safety from the Governor-General. Given that his arrest w as subsequently necessary (as I think it was) it should have been carried out openly, and if the man then chose to resist he must have taken the consequences. But for the Officer Commanding a strong gendarmerie force (who had paid him a friendly visit a few days earlier) to creep secretly up to the Nasir-i-Divan’s house in the darkness, and to attempt to blow in the door with gun-cotton, is riot a proceeding which would, I think, commend itself to a British officer in similar circumstances. But it is in reference to the events which followed the fighting that the Swedish officers have laid themselves open to the most damaging criticism. It is now certain, and cannot be denied, that during the whole time that Colonel Merrill, and M. Bimbaud remained at Kazerun, neither Captain Killander nor Captain Lund berg made the smallest attempt to control their men, or to restrain them from pillage, outrage and murder, or to punish them for these offences and for disobedience of orders, or even to take the most ordinarv mili- tary precautions to pursue the enemy or to ensure the safety of the town. No general muster w r as ever made of the gendarmes, and no return of dead and wounded could be obtained for several days after the capture of the town. Ihey winked at the scandalous treatment of inoffensive townspeople who had been made prisoners by their native officers, and at the attempts of these latter to extort money by threats and cruelty. And throughout the whole of this affair, as during the whole of their time in Ears, no single bwedish officer has ever displayed any real concern for the interests of British trade or subjects, or for the traffic on the road which they are set to guard; and on the contrary the innumerable representations which I have made on the subject have either been ignored or neglected, mules carrying British and other merchandise have been seized wholesale to carry gendarmerie stores and j loot, and at the present moment the whole traffic of the road is disorganisedi been decided to arrest him. ,231 And the muleteers are afraid to travel without a written guarantee from me or from Colonel'Uggla, and even these are not always effective to protect them from seizure and ill-treatment.

The condition of Ispahan-Bushire road remains most disquieting and Swedes even with financial aid have not appar ently restored order effectively. I am considering whether His Majes ty’s Government will not he forced to demand that British officers should he substituted for Swedes on that road. The suspension of Mohammerah railway survey is also serious question. His Majesty*•Majesty*8 Government consider it essen tial in the interest of British trade that the line should he surveyed and con structed as soon as possible. Only ob stacle is disturbed state of country. On the other hand presence of Swedes near Arabistan is, in my opinion,open to grave objections. Question of appoint ment of British officers to supervise establishment of order in that district for purposes of survey is one that should be carefully weighed. .{ Please telegraph your views. I m aware of objections to empioy- / ment of British officers even for limited object of keeping a road open for British trade, but if gendarmerie under Swedish officer breaks down we must face this alternative and we cannot go on financing Swedish gendarmerie if they are not effective or likely to become so, and recentrecent reports of their work in the South ara not encouraging.u Ir^Iiate.

''’i HAV h E tl th t r h h n ° Ur t0 , tran8 , mi * t0 herewith spondence \\ ich has been exchanged between this legation and the acting British consul at Shiraz since the date of my despatch No. 79 of the 18th March upon the subject of the situation at Kazerun. It will be seen from a perusal of this corre spondence that Major O Connor has unfortunately become imbued with a belief that the gendarmerie under Swedish officers cannot succeed in the task of restoring order m Ears, or, more properly speaking, on the Bushire-Shiraz road. , ,, ^ ; ls muc h to be regretted that this is the case, and 1 can only submit to your better judgment the appreciations formed by Major O’Connor as he has sent them to me He is, of course, far more able to judge of the situation on the spot than I can be here, and it is most discouraging to see the bad opinion that a capable officer has formed of the_ Swedish officers and their methods. It is impossible for me to challenge that impression, and I can only state that the Swedes have succeeded m^ creating quite a different impression here, where the work they have done is considered by competent critics to have been most remarkable. It is of course possible that they may be seriously affected by the southern climate, which is well known to have a great effect upon people of at all a nervous temperament. The reports given by Major O’Connor are most disquieting, because the gendarmes, under their Swedish instructors, are about all we have ~ to trust to in our hopes of seeing a continuation of the real improvement which would appear to be gradually making itself felt throughout the country, despite occasional inevitable set-backs. I cannot help thinking that Major O Connor had perhaps formed too high an ideal of what the Swedish officer should be in order to succeed as a British officer would wish to see them succeed. Up here, Major Steel, the military attache to this legation, speaks more than well of the wmrk they have done in a short time, although, of course, he sees their obvious faults, among which is the Swedish national failing- drink, the abuse of which would appear to be almost an article of honour of their military code. It is not unlikely that this weakness may affect them adversely in the warmer climate of the south, but I cannot but feel that Major O’Connor has been a little hasty in his judgment of them. As far as the incident at Kazerun is concerned, it is clear that the gendarmes did take part in the looting when the town first fell into their hands, and that the Swedish officers most improperly did not take the necessary steps to put a stop to it at once. At the end of the accompanying correspondence is a telegraphic report from the officer commanding at Shiraz, from Kazerun, in which he asserts that the part taken by the gendarmes in the looting has been exaggerated, and denies his men are out of hand or undisciplined. The general commanding here has also spoken to me in the same sense, and has represented that Major O’Connor was misled in perfect good faith by the reports of people who wished for their own ends to do the gendarmerie a bad turn. In support of his argument he quoted the Armenian telegraph clerk at Kazerun, who, he says, had the best of reasons for making out a bad case against the gendarmes, since he had profited personally from the old order of things, having been in such close friendly relations with the chiefs who formerly ruled the road that his mules, with which he did a carrying trade were accorded special treatment, and did not have to pay the illegal taxes exacted from other people. He would naturally, under such circumstances, have enjoyed a position which enabled him to do a lucrative carrying trade on the road, and such a man would doubtless have regretted the advent of the gendarmes. Moreover, I cannot but think that Major O’Connor is a little hard on the Swedes, and has expected too much from them, and that it is at the least premature to judge them from the work they have done up to the present. Many mistakes have doubtless been made, but such must be the case until experience is learned, 'whilst it is but fair to remember that the Swedes have had to take the field with an army which was only half disciplined, due to the short time the men had been with the colours. In addition [2133 d—6] id CoDv VO S2 MAY 1914 a C'* i Bmmnmr 2 to which the force is woefully under-officered, a fact that is not due to the Swedes but to the unfortunate conditions prevailing in Persia. 1 am advised that no European army would contemplate undertaking operations with men who have had less than two years service, whereas the Swedish officers have been working and fighting with material with less than two years’ training, which cannot be compared to Europeans in education or^f anything else, save possibly stamina. No military man would, I imagine, think it fair to t£ judge by res'dts ” say a newly-raised battalion of Ghurkas led by from ten to fifteen British officers who in less than two years from its formation had met with initial reverses under the same difficult circumstances which the gendarmerie have had to face. It is too earlv yet, in my opinion, to condemn the Swedes because they have not quite come up to expectations in Ears, more especially as there is no gainsaying the excellent work they have done in Northern Persia,^ where all those who had any previous knowledge of the roads or make their living on them are unanimous in their praise of the remarkable change wrought by the gendarmes, although, of course, there are always some who qualify their praise by complaining ot their highhandedness or some other fault. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Acting Consul O'Connor to Sir W. Townley. (No. 116.) (Telegraphic.) Shiraz, March 23, 1914. RECENT occurrences at Kazerun have produced disastrous impression, effects of which are not yet fully apparent. I am preparing detailed report which will enable your Excellency to form a judgment on the whole affair. Meanwhile I am compelled to let your Excellency know that it has become very difficult for me to afford the gen darmerie the same whole-hearted support as I have hitherto given them. I disapprove most strongly of the attitude and proceedings of the Swedish officers at Kazerun. Some looting was inevitable in the circumstances, but the Swedish officers made no effort to limit or control it, and no gendarme had been punished for these and even worse excesses. Friends and foes were plundered indiscriminately, and no attempt was made except by Merrill to protect foreign agents and merchandise. The affair was a suc cession of blunders from beginning to end. I begin to fear that it is injurious to our good name and prestige to be associated with such proceedings which could never have happened under British officers. I am preparing separate report on the whole political situation, which I will submit shortly. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Acting Consul O'Connor to Sir W. Townleu. (No. 122.) (Telegraphic.) Shiraz, March 25, 1914. SITUATION in Kazerun. I regret to have to inform your Excellency that reports received from Kazerun indicate continuance there of extremely unsatisfactory situation. Gendarmerie apparently are quite out of hand and much demoralised and outrages of various kinds are of common occurrence. Gendarmerie force of over 300 men is unable to secure safety of town which is nightly entered by outlaws. Kalantars of villages of Pul-i- Abgineh and Kaluni who are in the pay of the gendarmerie and who secured the lion’s share of the loot have been called in to guard the town with their tofangchis by night and these gentry further terrorise and oppress the townspeople. The latest report says the outlaws are wandering about the Kaserun plain and fire upon cultivators when they go out to attend to fields. State of townspeople is described as deplorable. Persian gendarmerie officer who was in command during the fighting and who has been accused of various offences, and at Colonel Merrill’s request was ordered back to Shiraz, has been allowed to return to Kazerun without any enquiry into his conduct. The only satisfactory feature in the situation is the presence in Kazerun of some Kashkulis under Mahommed Khan and a small force sent by Soulet both of whom appear anxious toassist the gendarmerie ; I am in daily consultation with matters and everything possible is being done to enable the themselves.

YOUR telegram No. 59. ’ Marctl U)14 IN view ot the fact that the Shiraz situation is now engaging your Excellency at Tehran, I venture to put forward a few observations for your Excellency’s The present system of maintaining order in Ears by means of the Swedish gendarmerie is calculated to cost about 150,000L a year, and as I venture to think our object is being to a great extent defeated by unsuitable manner in which the gendarmerie dubes are being carried out, I need not_ repeat the observations which I have already submitted to your Excellency on this point, but I wish now to emphasise how undesirable it is for us from all points of view to be associated with proceedings of foreign officers whose whole manner of treating Orientals differs from ours, and who have now succeeded m alienating all classes in Ears. When I first came to Shiraz I was pleased to find that in spite of events of the two previous years, general feeling of respect and liking for the British still existed. Such feeling is an^ asset of incalculable value to us in South Persia, and its loss would be irretrievable misfortune. I venture to submit for consideration whether it is worth our while to continue expenditure of large sums of money on an organisation which I fear, may have the effect of alienating these friendly sentiments. As to the question of what, could replace the Swedish gendarmerie in Ears, assuming that employment of British officers is not advisable, I venture to submit the following tentative suggestions :— 1 . Appointment of Governor-General friendly to our interests and prepared to co-operate cordially with British consul and European officials, and to accept their advice. 2 . Liberal subsidy to Soulet and Kavam. 3. Maintenance of small regular force of about 2,000 men commanded by an officer of some neutral Power and officered by Persians. 4. Annual subvention towards cost of provincial administration. Arrangements should not cost us more than from 30,000b to 40,000b yearly, assuming that revenue of Ears is expended within the province under proper European control, and this expenditure would give us locus standi for display of practical interest in the conduct of the administration. I venture to think also that as a bulwark against Russian aggression some such arrangement ensuring as it would the good will of the entire population, especially if combined with subsidisation of the Bakhtiaris, would be infinitely superior to the present policy of financing Swedish gendarmerie which is unduly expensive for the results obtained and which has antagonised the whole province. They merely exist now by virtue of our backing. If that were withdrawn they would be swept away immediately. This is only outline of my suggestions, I am submitting a despatch to elaborate them more fully. (Repeated Bushire, No. 62.) Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Actinq Consul O'Connor to Sir W. Townley. (No. 126.)

Nasr-ed-Divan has telegraphed to the Governor-General, inreply to a message from him, to the effect that he is prepared to quit the country and go to Kerbela, on condition that the Persian Government purchase his property from him so as to provide him with means of livelihood. Traffic on the road is completely disorganised owing to ill-treatment of Kazeruni muleteers by gendarmes, and a number of caravans are being held up on the lower section of the road pending assurances that they will not be ill-treated at Kazerun. I have requested Uggla to arrange for proper protection of muleteers, and to issue necessary orders and assurances, Repeated Bushire 63. Enclosure 5 in No. 1. Actinq Consul O'Connor to Sir W.

Shiraz, March 31, 1914 ARBITRARY seizure of mules by gendarmerie at Shiraz and on the road, regarding which I have already made various reports to your Excellency, has now reached such a pitch that no muleteer can regard himself as safe, and general panic and discontent prevails. I have made repeated representations to the Swedish officers on the subject and they have repeatedly promised redress, but the evil continues as before and even increases, without any serious attempt being made to terminate it or any gendarmes responsible being punished. 1 believe Swedish officers’ intentions to be of the best, but this is merely another sympton of their inability to control their men. I brought the matter seriously to the notice of Colonel Uggla before he left Shiraz for Kazerun yesterday and he promised to give it his earnest attention. Question is of special importance just now, when muleteers are already being driven off the road by Naghlieh arrangement, and arrangements which I have been making to try to tempt them back are being frustrated. Repeated Bushire 67. Enclosure 6 in No. 1. Acting Consul O'Connor to Sir W. Toumleu. (No. 136.) U (Telegraphic.) _ Shiraz, April 2, 1914. -Q KiiOEL y El) a telegram last night from Uggla from Kazerun, saying that the essential question was to find a suitable Governor for that place, and that as Kazerun was the centre of Kashgai tribes, in his opinion Kashgai Governor should be appointed. And he said that he is writing to Soulet to ask whether he would accept the appoint ment for one of his brothers, preferably Soulet-es-Sultaneh. I have replied that I am consulting you, and urging him to take no steps whatever in the matter until I have ascertained your views. My opinion on the subject is somewhat as follows : I have always regarded the gendarmerie as a neutral force which should not identify itself with any local or tribal group m particular, but which should, if possible, remain impartially on wood terms with all and keep the balance between the Kashgais and the Khamsa, keep open the road, and assist m maintaining order generally in the province. I have always held that the moment they mingle with local politics or identify themselves with any parttcular taction their utility will become, to a great extent, impaired, and the object of their presence here will be to a great extent defeated. The gendarmerie, in fact, must, in my opinion, be impartial and independent. I am therefore, on these grounds, against Uggla’s proposal, which will necessarily be regarded all over the province, and by Kawam especiallv, as a direct alliance with boulet. „ , Resides this, I am opposed to the suggestion on other grounds. Past history of the road has shown how undesirable was the Kashgai influence there, and from the day 1 arrived here I have been working to diminish Kashgai influence on the road. Kawarn s removal removes all pretext for their interference. The moment we have ashgai Governor of Kazerun all the old intrigues and difficulties will recommence. 1 had already discussed this very question with Uggla and he knows my views, and I do not understand why he should suddenly have sprung a new policy upon us. I fear it is that he now sees that the gendarmerie are too weak and too discredited tomaintain themselves on the road without Kashcrai sunnnW- ir • opinion, it is actually the case—the sooner we dispense w^th the^ ^ ^ S °~^ nd ’ 111 When we^ consider recent events and the present si'tnatnV ^ - ei ^ armeri _ e better, admitted, in \ 7 iew of heavy cost of the o-enrlarm • +1 + roa( ^5 ^ must be . unsatisfactory.

(No. 65.) (Telegraphic.) YOUR telegrams 136, 140, and 143. I entirely concur in what you say about Uggla’s attitude in communicating with Soulet-ed-Dowleh. I have addressed the general on the subject. I am also glad that you and the Governor-General are agreed about the undesirability of the appointment of a Kashgai chieftain to the Governorship of Kazerun. Ain-ed-Dowleh, in whose judgment I have much faith did not consider the idea an objectionable one, provided that it had Soulet’s approval, but you and the Governor General who are on the spot are the best judges of a question that it would be hard for me to decide here, and impossible for London to pronounce upon. I do not quite follow your line of argument when you apparently consider that the gendarmerie should have no baching from any of the local tribes or entities. It appears to me hardly possible that a diminutive force of 1,800 men can maintain themselves against all comers, unless they can rely upon the moral outward support of all the powerful factions loyal to the Government. This support should, however, be secured for them by the good offices of the Governor-General. All danger of creating jealousy or an appearance of looking to one party more than another should thereby be removed. I can see no hope of the situation at Kazerun improving as long as the insufficient force of gendarmerie stationed there is confronted by a numerically much stronger hostile force. We have told Soulet-ed-Dowleh that we look to him for acts and not for assurances only, and it would appear hardly consistent to dispossess his tribesmen of all chance of proving their loyalty by refusing to accept their assistance, on the score that it would appear, if this were done, that the gendarmes are too weak to stand alone. It must be patent to all that this is the case, and one can hardly expect it of a handful of men who represent a Government force, unless they can rely upon the backing of the loyal tribesmen. If, as should be the case, the Governor-General takes the matter in hand, there should be no cause for jealousy on Kawam’s part, as there is no intention of using the gendarmerie to weaken or belittle him. I entirely disagree with much that you say about the work done by the gendarmes. They have no doubt made many grievous mistakes, but it should in fairness to them be remembered that under strong pressure they have undertaken a most difficult task with a quite insufficiently large force, and that no time was given them to drill the whilom brigands that they had to enlist into any semblance of a decent fighting force. It is not clear yet who will finance the Fars gendarmerie for the future, but the Persian Government are being urged to leave no stone unturned to do it themselves, even if it is not somewhat a stretch of the imagination to talk of the justification of our spending money which is advanced on sound security at 7 per cent, per annum, repayable in three or four years. I am personally strongly opposed to any scheme under which the Kashgai or any other tribes should be subsidised by us. Efforts in other directions to work on these lines have proved dismal failures, the latest instance being in connection with the Luristan railway survey. Repeated to Bushire.Enclosure 11 in No. 1. Acting Consul O ' 1 Connor to Sir W. Townley. (No. 144.) * (Telegraphic;. ) April 9, 1914. YOUK telegram JNo. 65. If your Excellency will lead through my telegrams on the subject of the gendarmerie you will see that I nowhere express the opinion that “ gendarmerie should have no backing from any of the local tribes or entities.” Such a contention would be unreasonable, and on the contrary T have always urged the Swedes to keep on good terms with all powerful parties in Ears and, when necessary, demand their co-opeiation, as they have done with Soulet recently m connection with Kazerun. But this is a very different thing from the gendarmerie identifying them selves with any one tribal group or being compelled to rely on permanent support of any one tribal chief to maintain themselves on the road at all, and this is practically the situation now on the Bushire road. As for the work done by the gendarmerie in Ears, they must after all be judged by results. If these are unsatisfactory, no criticism of mine or of anyone else can alter facts. I can only say that their best friends and strongest supporters down here are now convinced by bitter experience and by logical facts that the Swedes at any rate are not competent to make gendarmerie a success, and this opinion is based not on hasty criticism of a particular incident, but on general observation oi Swedish character and methods. If matter is now to be left to Persian Government, I for one should hesitate to urge them to expend more than entire revenue of Ears on support of gendarmerie, and in this view every competent critic on the spot, European or Persian, thoroughly agrees.

We have told Saulet that we look to him for actions and not for assurances only and it would appear hardly consistent to dispossess his tribe of ail chance of proving their loyalty by refusing to accept their assistance on score that it would appear, if this were done, that gendarmerie are too weak to stand alone. It must be patent to all that this is the case and one can hardly expect it of a handful of men who represent a Government force unless they can rely on backing of loyal tribes, if, as should be case, Governor-General takes matter in hand, there should be no cause for jealousy on Kawam’s part as there is no intention of using the gendarmerie to weaken or belittle him. I entirely disagree with much that you say about the work done by gendarmes. They have no doubt made many grievous mistakes, but it should in fairness to them be remembered that under strong pressure they have undertaken most difficult task with a quite insuhicj.e ntlv large force and that no time was given to them to drill the ^whilom?) brigands whom they had to enlist into any semblance of a decent fighting force. It is not clear yet who will finance Pars gendarmerie for tiie fumre, but the Persian Government are being urged to leave no stone unturned to do it themselves, even if it is not something of a stretch of the imagination to talk of the justification of our raising money which is advanced on sound security at seven per cent, per annum repayable in three or four years.222 I am personally strongly opposed to any scheme under which Kashgais or any other tribes should be subsidized by us. Efforts in other directions to work on these lines have proved dismal failures, the latest instance being in connection with Luristan Railway Survey.*’ Addressed Shiraz,(bo); repeated Bushire, SO. 224 Telegram R., No. 429, dated the 10th (received 11th) April 1914.

Bui this is very different thing from gendarmerie identifying themselves with any one tribal group or being compelled to rely on permanent support of any one tribal Chief to maintain themselves on road at all, and this is practically situation now on Bushire road. As to the work done by the gendarmerie in Ears they must after all be judged by results. If these are unsatisfactory, no criticism of mine or of any one else can alter facts. I can only say that their paramount friends and strongest supporters down here are now convinced by bitter experience and by logical facts that Swedes at any rate are not competent to make gendarmerie success and this opinion is based not on hasty criticism of particular incident, but on general observation of Swedish character and methods. If matter is now to be left to Persian Government, I for one should hesitate to urge them to expend more than entire revenue of Ears on support of gendarmerie and in this view every competent critic on the spot, European or Persian, thoroughly agrees.” Addressed Tehran,repeated Bushire, 81.* -l No 1 5 d 9 kvA'i,.- 219 217 saying that Telegram R., No. 396, dated the 4th (received 5th) April 1914.

Poliowing from Acting Consul, Shiraz, 3rd April:— “ I received telegram last night from Uggla from Kazerun essential question was to find suitable Governor for that place, and that as Kazerun was centre of Kashgai tribes, in his opinion, Kashgai Governor should be appointed. And he says he is writing to Saulet to ask whether he would accept appointment for one of his brothers preferably Saulet Sultaneh. I have replied that 1 am consulting you and urging him to take no steps whatever in the matter until I have ascertained your views. My opinion on the subject is somewhat as follows: I have always regarded gendarmerie as neutral force which should not identify itself with any local or tribal group in particular but which should, if possible, remain impartially on good terms with all and keep balance between Kashgai and Khamseh, keep open road, and assist in maintaining order generally in province. I have always held that moment they mingle with local politics or identify themselves with any particular faction their utility will become to a great extent impaired and object of their presence here will be to a great extent defeated. Gendarmerie in fact must, in my opinion, be impartial and indepen dent. I am therefore on these grounds against Uggla’s proposal which will necessarily be regarded all over the province and by Kawam especially as direct alliance with Saulet. But besides this I am opposed to the suggestion on other grounds. Past history of the road has shown how undesirable was Kashgai’s interference there and from day I arrived here I have been working to diminish Kashgai influence on road and to remove all pretext for their interference. Moment we have Kashgai Governor of Kazerun all the old intrigues and difficulties ^ill recommence. More follows. Addressed Tehran/l36); repeated Bushire, 73.

I had already discussed this very question with TJggla and he knows * lbld ' my views, and I do not understand why he should suddenly have sprung new policy upon us. I fear it is that he now sees that gendarmerie are too weak and too discredited to maintain themselves on road without Kashgai support. If this is so, and in my opinion it is actually case, jiooner we dispense with gendarmerie altogether the better. When we consider recent events, and present situation on road, it must be admitted that, in view of the heavy cost of gendarmerie^ nothing could well be more unsatisfactory. They have twice been on verge of extinction at Kazerun, , and have lost to brigands property valued at many tens of thousands of tomans and quantity of rifles and ammunition. They only hold lower section of road by means of heavy subsidies paid to Khans, and they are obliged to call in local Khans even to guard Kazerun where there is gendarmerie force of four hundred men. They have wrought destruction at Ivazerun which will seriously hamper trade for many years to come. Their entire lack of discipline renders them dangerous rather than useful on road, and they have antagonised entire province by their misconduct. Ali Mahomet, brigand, whom they have been trying to catch for months and Nasir-i-Divan are still at large. If now they are compelled to call in Kashgais to secure their position, I venture to suggest, for consideration, whether game is worth th© L V / ED ib» 11candle, and whether we are justified in spending 150,000 pounds a year to support this organisation.

Meanwhile I am compelled to let Your Excellency know that it has become very difficult for me to afford the Gendarmerie the same whole-hearted support as I have hitherto given them. I disapprove most strongly of the attitude and proceedings of the Swedish officers at Kazemn. Some looting was inevit able in the circumstances but the Swedish officers made no effort to limit or control it and no gendarme had been punished for these or even worse excesses. Friends and foes were plundered indiscriminately and no attempt was made except by Merrill to protect foreign Agents and merchandise). The affair was a succession of blunders from beginning to end.

Gendarmerie apparently are quite out of hand and much demoralised, and outrages of various kinds are of common occurrence. Gendarmerie force consisting of over 300 men is unable to secure safety of town which is nightly entered by outlaws. Kalantars of villages of Pul Abgineh and Kaluni, who are in pay of gendarmerie and who secured lion’s share of loot have been called in to guard town with their tufangchis at night, and these- gentry further terrorise and oppress townspeople. Latest report says outlaws are wandering about Kazerun plain and fire at cultivators when they go out to- attend to fields. State of townspeople is described as deplorable. Persian gendarmerie officer, who was in command during fighting and who was accused of various offences and at Colonel Merrill’s request, was ordered back to Shiraz, has been allowed to return to Kazerun without any enquiry into his conduct. Only satisfactory feature in situation is presence at Kazerun of some Kashkulis under Muhammad Khan and small force sent by Saulat, both of whom appear anxious to assist gendarmerie.

When I first came to Shiraz I was pleased to find that in spite ofeventsof the two previous years, general feeling of respect and liking foi the British still existed. Such feeling is assuredly of incalculable value to us m Southern Persia and its loss would be irretrievable mis fortune. I veuture to submit for consideration whether it is worth our while to continue to expend large sums of money on an organisation which I fear mav have effect of alienating these friendly sentiments. As to question of’what could replace Swedish gendarmerie in Pars assuming that employment of British officers is not advisable, I venture to submit following tentative suggestions: First. Appointment of Governor-General friendly to our interests and prepared to co-operate cordially with British Consul and European officials and to accept their advice. Second. Liberal subsidies to Saulat and Kawam. Third. Maintenance of small regular force about 2,000 men commanded by officer of some neutral power and officered by Persians. Fourth. Annual subvention towards cost of provincial administrations Arrangement should not cost us more than 30,000 to 40,000 pounds yearly, assuming that revenue of Pars is expended within province under proper European control, and this expenditure would give us locus standi for display of practical interest in conduct of administration. X venture to think also that as bulwark against Russian agression some such arrangement ensuring as it would goodwill of entire population, especially if combined with subsidation of the Bakhtiaris, would be infinitely superior to present policy of financing Swedish gendarmerie which is unduly expensive for results obtained and which has disorganised whole province. They merely exist now by virtue of our backing. If that were withdrawn they would be swept away immediately. This is only outline of my suggestions.

Colonel Merrill, on arrival on the morning of 4th March, took up command of all troops at Kazerun and at once took steps for the protection of women and children and foreign merchandise and issued orders that any person found looting after sunset of that day would be shot. Gendarmes however were completely demoralised and much difficulty was experienced in stopping looting and other outrages. Number of prisoners made by gendarmes after occupying town have been tried by tribunal with Colonel Merrill as President. Sentences have not yet been definitely awarded. Gendarmes are said to have found and buried 118 dead tufangchis and in addition 20 men and 4 women and 12 children are said to have been killed during fighting. Gendarmes losses are 32 killed and 22 wounded. Town is now fairly quiet. Nasir-ud-Diwan and Ali Muhammad with his men have fled to mountains. Exact whereabouts is unknown. Bands of robbers have visited Shahpur District and have even entered Kazerun during night robbing and killing townspeople. Gendarmerie force is not strong enough to undertake punitive measures. Situation is in fact thoroughly unsatisfactory and still awaits proper solution. Major Lundberg left Shiraz for Kazerun to-day and on arrival Colonel Merrill will return to Shiraz.

M. Mornard is unfortunately more optimistic than business-like in his figures, which are apt to mislead.

Expenditure on police forces necessary to maintain order is properly a first charge on any unpledged Government revenue, and 1 gather that money required is available for considerable part at least of current financial year. His Majesty’s Government trust that with proper manage ment balance of expenditure will also be met. At any rate they must wait to see how matters stand when moment of shortage of money approaches. (Secret.) His Majesty s Government fully realise that to allow gendarmerie scheme in Ears to collapse would be most unfortunate in British interest, but, except as part of a complete change in their whole policy in regard to Persia, they could not approve an arrangement for continuing to bolster up the scheme unless they were satisfied that Persian Government would, within a reasonable time, be able to support it themselves. Otherwise it might be the wiser course to cut our losses now, and not add to them. You should therefore try to obtain further information regarding actual amount needed for maintenance of gendarmerie during current year, and report what is the limit in amount and in time beyond which you consider that cost in Ears could not be provided by Persian Government. Does estimate of 150,000i., which exceeds first year’s total cost, include the increase in numbers which acting consul at Shiraz deprecated (see your despatch No. 291 of 24th December, paragraph 2) ? I should also welcome your observations on a suggestion which has been made that the Persian Government might reduce expenditure on gendarmerie in those districts where its presence is unwelcome, and where British interests do not pre dominate, and thus find money for the force in Ears and Kerman.Legislative a statment to t effect mentioned by I would reier tne non !.ember to details of sented to larliament in August last giving inaian Governments SUPPmmmARY Sir J. 7).

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 12 1914 ) (No. 291.) ^ ^ ^ r ’ r a ivt + 4 - ’ • p . . Tehran, December 24, 1913. I AM not yet in possession of any detailed information respecting tlie recent operations of the gendarmerie on the Shiraz-Bushire road other than that which has been communicated to you by telegram, but there appears every reason to believe they were carried out with perfect success after the foolish behaviour of the detachment left at Kazerun, under Persian officers, had threatened to wreck the whole undertaking. Some faults umuld appeal to have been made, and it was most unfortunate that Ali Mohamed Kamaredji was allowed to escape on the first occasion when he was surrounded in a fort, and, after a combat lasting some hours, managed to get away under cover of the night with all his followers, including women and baggage animals. It seems hard from Major O’Connor’s account of the occurrence to acquit the Swedish officer in command of all blame, since there was bright moonlight, and the fort was surrounded on all sides. On the whole, however, the Swedes carried out their work well, and it required no small amount of courage, after having had to retire to Daliki, to make good the rear which was threatened, to attack the difficult Tangi Turkan Pass with a small force, in the face of the determined opposition of the tribesmen who have gained by their prowess in the past no mean name as fighting men. That certain of the outlaws are still abroad is unfortunate, but it is hard to catch such people when they take to the mountains, and one can only hope that they will be captured in due course. Latest reports received show that the road is now open between Shiraz and Bushire, whilst preparations are being made to put posts on the road north of Shiraz up to the frontier of the Ispahan province. The continuation of the good order established can only be maintained if the necessary funds are forthcoming, and the question where these funds are to be found will soon have to be faced, as the Persian Treasury is in no condition to supply them, and the revenue of the province, though much improved, will not be sufficient for the purpose. On the existing budget the Persian Government has to find about 25,000L in addition to the 100,000Z. advanced for the purpose by His Majesty’s Government, and I understand that it is proposed to increase the effective force from about 2,000 men to 2,700. Major O’Connor deprecates this increase as unnecessary, and I propose to represent his reasons for coming to this decision, which appear to me sound, to the general commanding. I have the honour to submit to you herewith copy of a despatch from Major O’Connor, which I have received since I commenced to write this despatch, in which, I regret to say, he reports that it has been by no means easy to induce the Swedish officer charged with the accounts to submit the same for proper control, in accordance with the arrangement made with the Persian Government when His Majesty’s Government agreed to make the advance for the service of the Pars gendarmerie. This is the general complaint against the Swedes, that they will not submit their accounts, and that their methods are extravagant. I shall speak to General Hjalmarson on the subject, and shall point out to him that it is in the interests of the gendarmerie officers themselves that they should accept the help of those who are better able than they are to prevent their being robbed by unscrupulous persons whom they may have taken into their service. # } It would be of great assistance to me to know whether His Majesty s Government propose to make a further advance to the Persian Government on account of the gendarmerie of Pars at the end of the year, for which the first advance was made. In submitting this question to you, Sir, I would respectfully beg to point out that the original request of the Persian Government was for financial assistance such as would enable them to make sure of the maintenance of a suitable force in Pars for a peiiod of three years. In recommending this matter to your favourable consideration, I [2013 m—11]would venture to add that the success achieved by the gendarmerie has more than come up to the most sanguine hopes of what might be expected from them in so short a time. I have not yet been approached by the Persian Governnent on the subject, but it would appear to me most important that, if it is intended to come to their help with a fresh advance, there should be no moment when the .success of the undertaking might be imperilled by uncertainty as to whether or no further funds will bl forthcoming. I have, &amp;e. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Major O'Connor to Sir W. Toumley. (No. 418.) (Telegraphic.) Shiraz, December 24, 1913. I UNDERSTAND Ears gendarmerie budget is now under preparation in Tehran. Uggla tells me that he proposes force of 2,700 men for the next financial year, present strength being 1,600. Stas and I are both of opinion that force of 2,000 men should amply suffice for the present. This should be sufficient to maintain present strength on main road from Yezdikhast to Bushire, and to leave small reserve at Shiraz for emergencies. Cost of gendarmerie during the last few months has been so heavy that I think it is desirable strength of force should be limited to maximum of about 2,0u0—at any rate until we can judge of progress likely to be made in reorganisation of local troops, &amp;c. Your Excellency would perhaps discuss this question with the general officer commanding in connection with new budget estimates.t In any further communication i the subject, please quote No. quot 12564/14. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. i Foreign Office &lt;j 5th March, 1914.

It is hard at present to foresee from what source Persian Government will be able to find the money to coyer anticipated deficit for next year ; but every nerve will be strained to meet expenditure on gendarmerie, which is becoming to be considered as the saviour o t e nation. Work already done in the F ars is of a nature seriously to assist British trade as soon as effect of the open road begins to make itself felt and confidence revives ; out if funds are not forthcoming, I can only anticipate gradual slipping back to old order of things, which would not only mean that British trade would suffer, but that .British houses doing business in Persia would get sick of the hopeless state of things and close down, whilst all the money spent and good work done will have been wasted. It appears to me that under such conditions the British taxpayer ought not to resent a further advance to Persia for the Pars gendarmerie, which is made on fairly good security at the remunerative rate of 7 per cent, interest. I venture to recommend above to your most favourable consideration in the sincere hope that it may be found possible to advance entire sum of 150,0007. to Persian Government. An early decision is of urgent importance. — 322 — 142 ] . r&amp;yV' - 20 MAR 1914CONFIDENTIAL. ' .' .' i : . .■-i' /sTS ! 14 MAR 1914 ■ ** u *i. r ^ ^3# P.M. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G, Buchanan (St. Petersburcjh). (N °' pIrSIAN gendarmerie. fx.- Office, March 12, 1914, 4-20 Sir W. Towiiley’s telegram N6. 82 of 10th March. I trust that the friendly discussions between Sir W. Townley and his Russian colleague will facilitate a satisfactory arrangement, but it seems to me necessary to remove ail possible misapprehension as to the position in Persia and our attitude towards it. x 0 P erat i° ns of Swedish-officered gendarmerie are at present practically restricted to the south, where the force is doing excellent work, having regard to the inadequate numbers of officers and tofother difficulties. His Majesty s Government do not understand on what possible grounds the Russian Government can m fairness claim a right to withhold their assent to the increase of the bwedish staff, which is absolutely necessary if order is to be re-established and main tained in the south. The maintenance of order is the first duty of the Persian Government, and to prevent the Persian Government from taking such measures would be tantamount to saying that the prevalence of disorder in the south is a Russian interest. I do not believe for a moment that Russian Government would think of acting on such a view. It must be remembered that the interruption of trade routes in the south excludes British trade from the neutral sphere, and that for Russia to oppose measures such as extension of Swedish gendarmerie, which are necessary to keep open those trade routes, is in practice to give Russian trade greater opportunities than British of entering the neutral sphere. British traders already complain that this is the effect of present conditions. His Majesty’s Government consider, therefore, that the Persian Government must be free to engage a sufficient number of Swedish officers to enable the gendarmerie to carry out their paramount duties This is due to Persia and essential to enable ^British trade to compete on equal terms in the neutral sphere. British interests are thus directly involved. His Majesty’s Government must ask the Russian Government to consider whether opposition to the organisation of the only possible effective police force in those regions is compatible with the policy of Anglo-Russian co-operation and friendship. His Majesty’s Government on their part have at the cost of much parliamentary trouble in this country loyally refrained from putting difficulties in the way of Russia in upholding her interests in the north of Persia, precisely because they have always recognised that Russia has a vital interest in the preservation of order and repression of lawlessness in the north. But His Majesty’s Government must ask that British interest in the maintenance of order in the south should be correspondingly recognised, and they cannot agree that Russia has a right to make the maintenance of order there impossible except in return for special concessions to herself. The question of the employment of the Swedish gendarmerie in the north is a separate one. Whilst the Persian Government ought not to be hampered in using their own police forces to keep order in any part of their own country, His Majesty’s Government readily admit that Russia’s special position in the north entitles her to ask that extension of sphere of operations of the gendarmerie to those regions should be discussed with her. So far as His Majesty’s Government are concerned, they would be prepared to support an arrangement by which the gendarmerie would be employed on the roads in the five northern provinces, whilst simultaneously the force of Persian Cossacks under Russian officers were increased. This should, however, in fairness, be subject to the proviso that certain important reforms in the constitution and administration of-Hhe Cgssffiik’Jrigade are carried out, which all competent authorities, incfh^ig^yRr i^ i^elievedWthe Russian Legation m ! .0 MAH 1914 at Tehran,recognise to be absolutely necessary if the Cossacks are to become an effective police force. They were originally organised as the personal bodyguard of the Shah. The conditions of pay now in force militate directly against efficiency and mobility, and the officers claim to be entirely independent of the Persian Government, if the^ Persian Government are to be asked to agree to an increase of the Cossacks on the’ plea that they will be employed to keep order, it is only reasonable that they should be in a position to give orders to the officers in command and that the force should be efficient. I should be glad if your Excellency would make use generally of the above lines »| of argument in discussing the whole matter in a friendly way with M. Sazonof. His U Majesty’s Government feel that on a satisfactory settlement of this question of an 1* efficient police force the maintenance of an independent Persia largely depends. I must add that a substantial withdrawal of Russian troops from Persia would be the natural corollary of any substantial extension of Cossacks under Russian officers.CONFIDENTIAL. Sir W.Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 10, 2'o5 p.m.) (No 82 ) Tehran, March 10, 1914. YOUR telegram No. 41 of 28th February : Gendarmerie and Cossacks 10 ’ 4 P M lave discussed question at great length and with absolute frankness, both with the Russian Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Former is umyilling to commit himself to any definite suggestion, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that the Cabinet would never consent, except under great pressure, to the permanent stationing of Cossack detachments in any towns but Tehran and Tabriz. Russians’ request tliat m return for their consent to the engagement of live additional Swedish officers the Cossack brigade should be increased has been answered in this sense. uissian Minister, after asking for plain answer, now complains that Persia’s reply is a point-blank refusal of Russia s request, though worded in conciliatory language and only consented to transmit its contents to St. Petersburgh after the Minister for Foreign Affairs had agreed that he would again lay before his colleagues question of Cossacks being established in the north if the necessity should arise. Russian Minister told me last night that, unless Persian Government agreed to this m principle, he is convinced that Russian Government will oppose all increase m number of Swedish officers, but he expressed his opinion that the Russian Government could not justifiably oppose employment of gendarmerie throughout Persia, since no restriction was made when the force was created, and thought that, if His Majesty’s Government urged Persian Government to agree to the establishment of Cossacks*m certain places in five northern provinces, the Russian Government would waive their objection to gendarmes being employed on the roads in those provinces. I pointed out to him that it seemed to me most unfair that the development of a force which had proved its value should be hampered by such a condition, but I promised to lay the matter before you for your favourable consideration. It does seem hard to take advantage of the situation to impose a distasteful condition on Persia, but it appears to be clear that some concession will have to be made in order to remove Russian opposition, and if it is established that the gendarmerie can be employed on the roads throughout the country, the Cossacks, beyond the fact that their increase will entail useless and unnecessary expense upon the Exchequer, will possibly not do much harm.. fl' (?'&lt; N PERSIA AND CENTRAL ASIA.

While I realise fully that the gendarmerie may be essential for the proper govern ment ot Persia, it is not to be expected that the British taxpayer will continue to pay foi the maintenance of the force. Before I am prepared, therefore, to consider the question of approaching His Majesty’s Treasury regarding a further outlay of 100 0001 I must have conclusive evidence to show, if necessary, that the Persian Government could not finance the scheme themselves, and that I have made every effort to induce them to fulfil their own most elementary obligations by meeting the charges on account of the maintenance of law and order out of the country’s own resources. If Persia continues to receive instalments of funds whenever the need arises she will never pay her own way. ' ^ I accordingly request you to urge the Treasurer-General in the strongest manner to find the necessary money out of Persian revenues. As regards the difficulty experienced by the acting British consul at Shiraz in inducing the Swedish officer charged with keeping the accounts of the force to submit them f ir proper control, it is difficult to understand how any public official conversant with civilised methods of administration can seriously claim exemption from the universally accepted rule governing the disbursement of public moneys in all countries, a claim which is, moreover, in complete contradiction to the terms on which the advance was made, as mentioned in your telegram No. 260 of the 13th July last. You should accordingly use your influence in every way to support the demand of the Finance Department for the rendering of proper accounts by the gendarmerie officers, and you may inform the Swedish commandant of the force, and warn Major O’Connor, that unless such accounts are duly rendered there can be no question of continuing to'make money from British sources available for the purposes of the force.

The only loan discussed was of the amount of £50,000 to be payable to the Persian Government through the Imperial Bank of Persia.The correspondence was mainly about whether it is in the British Government’s interest to support the Fars gendarmerie or not. This was in response to a number of incidents that took place in the Kazerun region, and the direct involvement of the Fars gendarmerie led by Swedish officers in the affairs. Criticism was raised against the Swedish officers for misleading the gendarmerie, and a suggestion of their withdrawal from service was made. The Swedish Government then contemplated withdrawal of its officers from service in Persia.The correspondence deals with arrangements for the payment of the loan, conditions attached to it, the agreement of terms between the British, the Persian and the Swedish Governments, and the date of commencement of repayments.In July 1914, a loan of £50,000, was made by the British Government to the Governor-General of Fars (half of which was to be payable by the Government of India), in order to assist Persia in order to avoid a breakdown of the gendarmerie organization. It was made clear that the British Government fully realized that to allow the gendarmerie scheme in Fars to collapse would be detrimental to British interests.The volume’s principal correspondents are: Sir Walter Beaupre Townley, British Minister at Tehran; Sir Edward Grey, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; Major William Frederick Travers O’Connor, Acting Consul at Shiraz; and Sir Esme William Howard, Ambassador of the United Kingdom to Sweden.The volume’s core correspondence covers the period February 1914 to October 1914. The earlier start date given for the volume is a result of correspondence included in a confidential enclosure on Persian Government loans (ff 94-97); itself dated April- May 1913, which is an historical précis of loans given to Persia by the British Government and Government of India in the year 1913.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Shiraz</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Kazerun</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Loans</topic></subject><subject><topic>Financial aid</topic></subject><subject><topic>Police</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000f9#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
