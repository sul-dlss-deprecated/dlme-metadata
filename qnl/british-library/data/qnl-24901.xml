He knew nothing of any dealings with Mr.philby. 3. We have taken the line with Ydlibi that any approach to the Sheikh must be through H.M.G. and we must avoid any appearance of discrimination. Apart from this, it is clearly undesirable that tne question of the Neutral Zone oil should be ventilated simultaneously with the Saudi discussions about the Koweit blockade. After discussion with the Foreign Office I suggest that we might telegraph in the terms of the draft, in which Mr. Rendel concurs. Fortunately, from Koweit telegram 99 of 10th April it/Tr it appears that the 3heikn is himself most reluctant that the blockade discussion should be complicated by introauction of the oil question ana that he is apprehensive of Mr. Philby. It is to be hoped that the Sheikh's attituae regarding trie Neutral Zone, as reportea in paragraph 3 of the Koweit telegram No.99, is correct. It would conform entirely to our own views ana also, so far as can be judged, to those of the I.P.C. tr 1^- TTo^wA*. &lt;vw (o *■ 3&lt;t. ks^dh- iw jv^taST.p £ r i &gt;+?7.

In paragraph 2 of that telegram you cite a letter from the Sheikh of Koweit to Ibn Saud dated the 28th August 1933, as containing mention of 'multiple” customs post. 3. We have not been able to trace any letter from the Sheikh to Ibn Saud bearing that date: but in Bushire despatch No. 44/757-S of the 27th June 1933 was enclosed the draft (subsequently approved and despatched) of a reply from the Sheikh to Ibn Saud’s proposal for the unification of Customs dues. This letter was assumed at the time to be the letter of the 7th August to which Ibn Saud replied on the 7th September see our despatch No. 304 of the 13th November 1933 — and we should not have hesitated to read 'August 7th for your 'August 28th' if the Sheikh’s draft letter, enclosed in the above-mentioned Bushire despatch, had not, by inference from the letter of the 14th February 1930 which it quotes, clearly referred to a 'single' and not 'multiple' customs posts. This is a very trivial point: but we should be grateful if you would help us to dispose of it. Yours ever, EASTERN DEPARTMENT.

My dear Ken, I reply personally to the Department^ letter to my Chancery No. E 1155/206/25 of February 21st about the Kuwait blockade as I think I can explain most clearly in this way my difficulty about single and multiple customs posts. The Department are quite right about the reference in the body of my telegram No. 31 of February 18th to the Sheykh’s letter to Ibn Saud. I should certainly have said the ^Sheykh’s reply of August 7th.” That paper always confuses me as we have the text in one place and the date in another. Having just written ”28th”, I wrote it again. Peccavi. Forgive me. The question of single versus multiple posts is now less important than it was when I sent my telegram, as it is to be hoped that all the issues will be threshed out at the proposed local conference. My difficulty, however, was this. At the Inter-Departmental meeting of April 28th 1933, Fowle spoke of a proposal ”that a number of Saudi customs posts should be set up outside Kuwait.” He described this as a proposal to which the Sheykh had agreed but which Ibn Saud had gone back on. He would therefore appear to have been thinking of the proposal of which Dickson gave a generally similar account in his report of June 22nd 1933, enclosed in Fowle’s despatch to the C.O. No.44 of June 27th, 1933. Dickson, however, defining the proposal with greater precision/ R.Johnstone, Esq, Foreign Office.precision, spoke of it as having reference to a single post. Now in his letter to Ibn Saud of August 7th the Sheykh referred as you say to the old single-post proposal but he referred also in paragraph 16 to the possibility of a proposal by Ibn Saud to create ”a string of customs posts.” He very clearly regarded this a distinct idea and, while he was quite polite about it, knowing that Ibn Saud could establish as many posts as he liked in his own territory, he was by no means so precise as to the form his assistance would take in that alternative. Prima facie it might appear that it mattered nothing to the Sheykh whether merchants had to return through a single post or had a choice of several. I can well imagine nevertheless, that if he really wished to help to canalize trade, he might find it much easier to direct it to one point rather than to any of several. Hence the question in my telegram. One cannot be too cautious in dealing with the two potentates concerned and in this case we have no first-hand knowledge of what passed between them in 1930.

The Foreign Office have suggested that it might he a good thing, given the importance of this question, if Colonel Fowle himself were to he present in Koweit during the discussions. a. On the whole, my feeling is rather in favour of leaving things alone. Colonel Dickson is very well qualified to deal with this question, which which he is thoroughly conversant in all its aspects; while if the negotiations come to nothing it will, on the whole, have been preferable that the P.A. and not the Resident should have been associated with them. Apart from this, it is, of course, possible that Colonel Fowle may have to take the opportunity of his next visit to Koweit to rebuke the sheikh for his conduct in connection with Traders, and the effect of this, if it came at the time of the negotiations, might well be to make the Sheikh even more unresponsive to the Saudi proposals than he is otherwise likely to be.14—6130 10950 (2) wdexe 17 In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. ^ and address —not to any -person by'name, bu}/to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office.

I o My dear Fuad Bey, You will remember that in our conversations on January 20th and 21st, Your Excellency confirmed a suggestion which you had made during the informal conversations held during your visit to London last September, namely that my Government should make proposals as to the best means of terminating the present situation as regards trade between Kuwait and Nejd. After reviewing the numerous solutions which have been suggested in the past, my Government have instructed me to state that they favour one of two methods of dealing with this question, to the settlement of which they attach the utmost importance, in the interest of the relations between this country and Kuwait and of their own relations with the Government of Saudi Arabia. These methods are the following:- (a) To return to the proposal made by His Majesty King Abdul Aziz himself in the first instance that the commissioners representing each of the parties should meet and endeavour to work out a compromise, on the understanding that the task of the commissioners would be to frame recommendations for consideration by the higher authorities (b) To explore the possibility of an agreement on one particular basis, which has been suggested in the past, namely/ His Excellency Fuad Bey Hamza.namely that the trade across the frontier should he controlled at one or more customs posts on the territory of His Majesty the King, to which all trade should he directed. The object of this letter is to indicate in general terms the views of my Government. I suggest that we should take an early opportunity of discussing the matter orally and consider together how far it may he possible to overcome any difficulties which have at an earlier period delayed progress towards a solution on one or other of those bases.

I have to-day addressed personal letter to Fuad in dicating in general terms two alternatives favoured by His Majesty's Government and suggesting oral discussion with a view to overcoming difficulties which have hitherto delayed progress on those lines.. Definition of first alternative is based on my note r2t ^ Sa udi Government of August 19th, 1932. I have defined second as follows: 'To explore possibility of agreement on one particular Pasis which has been suggested in the past, namely, that trade across frontier should be done at one or more customs posts in territory of His Majesty the King to which all trade should be directed.' This second definition has presented some difficulty. I deduce from previous correspondence that solution really favoured by the Sheikh is proposal for a single customs post describ ed at (1) in paragraph 2 of Political Agent’s report 'bo y.hltfo Political Resident No* 126 of June 22nd, 1933. Multiple posts were mentioned by Political Resident at inter- departmental meeting April 28th, 1933, and again in Sheikh's reply of August 28th, 1933, to Ibn Saud's pro posal for unification of customs duties.

This, always provided, that Bin Baudthat Bin aaud will receive His Majesty’a Government’s advances in a friendly and accommodating spirit, m&amp;m business, and will agree to raise the Blockade, and in place of same establish one or more customs posts on his side of the frontier* (b) Should however Bin Baud 'harden his heart', and in spite of all efforts of His Majesty’s Government, should he refuse to agree to a settlement on the above lines, then he (the Shaikh) feels bound to say now, that the situation must be considered as remaining unchanged and Kuwait 'Claims 51 against Bin Baud (which are not 0^/ his 0 wUj but those of his people) shall be exactly in the earn position as they were before the negotiations started: H© puts it this way as he does not wish to start a fresh dispute with the King over 'Claims' and so spoil the good relations that exist* (o) He (the ahaikh) never had, and still has no faith whatsoever in the Blockade impasse being settled by means of selected Arab 'Commissioners*, but if His Majesty’s Government desire to give the idea a preliminary trial, he will raise no objection, though he reiterates his previous warning that such Commissioners’ efforts must from the nature of things prove abortive* (d) H© (Gha ikh) reiterates his conviction that if His Majesty’s Government will seriously deal with the matter themselves, the blockade problem will be easily and satisfactorily solved* (The implication here is, that no amount of persuasive eloquence will be of any use with the King, but that/that only a ♦♦firm front” will bring about the favourable reaction necessary for a settlement), 3. My own views are that the Shaikh knows fully well that he has not a ghost of a chance of ever getting money compensation for his 'claims*, but that he wants to be able to Justify all he does in this matter to his people# Ho wants to tell them in open Mejlisa if necessary, something of the following nature (We must not forget that we are dealing with an almost Bedouin Democracy where relations between Huler and ruled are personal). - r rhe protecting power have generously offered to •’reopen negotiations with Bin Baud for the removal of n the Blockade. I have welcomed the idea * I have 'gone further and have offered to abandon all your 'and my just 'claims* against the King,for damage 'and destruction caused by hie . khwan forces in the 'past, to prove that for our part, we are imbued 'with the fullest good will and are prepared to bury 'the past for ever. X have made the condition, however, 'that Bin Baud shows equal good will and genuinely 'attempts to meet our advance by an equal act of 'generosity. Bhould he agree to replace his Blockade 'by on© or more customs posts on the frontier as the 'protecting power is going to ask him to do, then 'all is well - If he is not willing to meet the 'protecting power’s proposals end rejects our advances, 'then all that is left for u© to do is to withdraw our 'offer in the matter of 'claims” and put our reliance 'in God and ask Him to recover them for us in his 'good time*. 4* In my opinion, His Majesty’s Government need not worry much at this stage about the . haikh’s 'claims- proviso and attempt to safeguard himself with his people. They should go ahead, X think, and tell Bin Baud that the Shaikh is ready to show his good will by dropping the 'claims',M&gt; «ar n olaimjB n t wiiieh he has hitherto ii&amp;de as a preliminary to negotiations being opened# 5# But if negotiations showed definite signs of going wrong or of failing altogether, His Majesty’s Govern men t should then, but only the, say to the King, that they felt it would only be fair to advise the Shaikh to with draw his offer to drop hie claims on the grounds that he would find it moat difficult to deal with his subjects, and explain away how it was that he had given away their chance of getting back 'blood money' for relatives killed ; and money compensation for looted camels, sheep, horses^and had got nothing for them in return# I heve the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd.

Moreover, His Majesty’s Government feel it essentia in Your Excellency’s own interests, that you should abandon this question of claims altogether, which in the eyes of Bin Baud is a decisive obstacle to the disposal of the Blockade question: Indeed His Majesty’s Government regard Your Excellency’s private correspondence with Bin Baud on the subject of these ’’claims', as having mad® It quite hopeless for Your Excellency to raise this question, through them, with the exception of course of Jour 'Personal' claims.

At the date of those instructions the negotiations between the sheikh and the Kuwait Oil Company were still in progress and it was thought desirable, therefore, while emphasising the importance of an early aecision, to give trie Resident discretion as to the point at which he should make the necessary communication to tne sheikh, colonel Powle (telegram of 24th November on P.Z.7210/34) asked permission to postpone the communication for the time being and it was agreed informally with the Foreign Office to accept his view. 2. The oil negotiations are now over and the Foreign Office - see their letter of 1st January below - are anxious that action should be taken without further delay. The point is, as they say, likely to be one of importance having regard to the personal considerations involved in the forthcoming negotiations between Sir A. Ryan and Ibn Saud. I do not tnink that we need show any special tenderness over the Sheikh*s feelings. He has placed us in a very embarrassing position by his unauthorised negotiations witn Traders Ltd. (a separate submission will be made on tne general question of what, if any, steps should be taken with him consequent on this) and while he has admittedly certain grievances against us in/in respect of the date gardens, I do not think that we need any longer postpone the communication now under consideration. 3. I attach a draft telegram for consideration.■ r t 1R i r FOREIGN OFFICE, S.¥,l. 1st January, 1935. (E 7112/1483/25) Important wuj Jf* With reference to our recent telephone conversation, I write to say that, now that the Koweit oil concession appears to have 'been cleared out of the way, we should like, if you agree, to press ahead with the question of the Koweit blockade. You will by now have seen Ryan’s telegram No.198 of the 27th December (a copy was enclosed in our official letter No.E 7669/2429/25 oi the 28th December to the India Office) , in which he appeals for our views on as many of the questions outstanding with the Saudi Government as possible. It seems to us particularly desirable that he should be able to discuss the blockade question at Riyadh in view of the personal considerations, J.G. Laithwaite, Esq., C.I.E. Jconsiderations, as 'between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh, with which that problem has become entangled, I do not know whether you will think that the Sheikh should or should not be shown much consideration in this matter. It is of course principally out of consideration for his feelings that we have hitherto delayed our proposed action. Since Powle’s telegram No.1124 of the 24th November, however, which caused us to agree to that delay, not only has the oil concession been granted, but also the Sheikh has been shown to have behaved rather shabbily towards us over the oil negotiations and has, as I think you will agree, been extremely tiresome over his smuggling dispute with Iraq. In these circumstances, subject to your views and Fowled, we are inclined to think that he does not deserve to be treated with too much tenderness and that the preliminary communication to him about his claims against Ibn Saud, which! 1 txix Z(fa M: o* y&gt;n^A *- J ^ /. ^ which Powle was instructed to make in paragraph 2 (c) ^^£*3of your telegram No.2584 of the 31st October to Bushire, should now he made with the least possible delay.

SAUDI BLOCICA.DK OF KKWAlf . (a) This during the summer months appears to have lost some of its severity. Certain it is thac Awazim tribesmen have been coming into Kuwait in large number and most regularly during September and October. It is true these come in mostly from the Neutral Zone, where many are camped, but no doubt they pass on their supplies to their brethren south of the border. (b) According to the Shaikh, several cargoes of food-stuffs have been purchased by merchants oi Jubail and Jinneh from Kuwait during September and October and have been successfully dumped on the coast of llassa. (c) The Shaikh puts down the comparative ease with which goods are now going into Nejd, to loss of n prestige TI on the part of Bin Saud which has adversely affected the mentality of his frontier officials. How long this willc ontinue remains to be seen, however. (d) During October (15th) a number of merchants from Hejd came up to Kuwait and purchased a goodly supply carpets and Abbahs (cloaks) and shipped them to Nejd via Ojair. This is the second occasion that this has happened during the summer of 1934. On their first visit they bought £.2000 worth of goods. The merchants came with the authority of the King and the goods appear to be destined for His Majesty himself.1 B-S-g T P H 1 , / 7 21 J 48 giroap^o LKJ U l^ T I Jl&amp;MJZji From (GOPIUS GIHCtJLATSD) Political Hesident in the Persian Sulf, to Secretary of State for Indiac Dated Bushire, 24th Fovemher, 1934 0 Beceived ll o 10 a^mo, 24th Fovember, 1934 0 1124 o Addressed to secretary of State for India* copy sent by sea mail to Government of India and Koweit* Your telegram of the 31st ultimo* 2584&lt;, Political Agent* JCoweit* to whom I referred states that having regard to oil \ negotiations and Sheikh's feelings over date gardens and % smuggling incidents* present time is decidedly inopportune for | C4»y»^ lonioftey^to' Sheikho I concur, and would be grateful if communication could be postponed BP.Z.7927/34.

Arising out of Koweit question, the King mentioned what he called restrictions on trade of Nejd.

His Majesty's Government would welcome a strengthening of the ties of friendship Petween the two Governments and are always ready for general conversations on outstanding questions with this object in view. buch general conversations would natural ly include discussions in a friendly spirit of two majoi questions, viz, (l) the 1913A4 line and ( 2 ) blockade of Koweit, which require settlement before relations between Saudi Government and His Majesty’s Government can be con sidered entirely smooth and satisfactory, 3. ns regards (l) you may inform Ibn Baud that if he118 « he will cease to contest the undoubted validity in inter national law of the 1913/14 line, His Majesty's Govern ment will he prepared as in earlier case of Koweit, to consider sympathetically and to authorise you to discuss on your return any reasonable proposals for minor adjust ments, You might suggest that now that his achievements have brought his country into the circle of fully in dependent and properly constituted States, he cannot merely seek to set aside the generally accepted principles of international law which govern relations between such States. It would be impossible for His Majesty's Govern ment to discuss boundary question on any other basis. 4. As regards (2), you should merely indicate that obligations of His Majesty's Government towards Sheikh make it impossible to consider their relations with Ibn Saud as entirely satifactory until some method is found o± alleviating damaging effects of blockade upon sheikhdom-' Should the King raise the question of the Sheikh’s claims (regarding which position has not yet been cleared up with Sheikh) you may say that His Majesty's Government agree that this matter must be settled also. 5 , His Majesty's Government will gladly consider any proposals on these two matters which His Majesty may com municate to them while you are on leave, in order that on your return to Jedda you may be in possession of full in structions to enable you to discuss settlement of both, 6 , As regards desiderata of King Ibn Saud, since they are uncertain, you oan only take note of them for report to me.

The latter is apparently confining himself to trying to prevent caravans going from Kuwait across the llejd border; but blockade running is on the increase and a marked deterioration in the measures taken to stop the traffic has set in. This, no doubt, is due to the Bin Saud - Yemen troubles, which have demoralized in large measure the King’s officials along the Northern frontier. (c) On the 25th March the writer met Hamud al Bagaawis wife travelling with two other women in the desert, and had an interesting talk with her on matters to do with blockade. She had been staying with the Amir Haif ibn Hajraf, and was returning to her husband after a lengthy absence. (d) It is reliably reported that the aged Faisal ibn Shuqair (uncle of Trahib, the Shaikh of the section) desiring to put himself right with Bin Saud for bringing the Jerriya Mutair into Kuwait, recently proceeded to Riath, and got a telegram sent to the King from there, to the effect that the Mutair had entered Kuwait purely becpuse ' death ” lay behind them and life 'Al Haya' (the Bedouin equivalent for life) was in the North. The King replied/replied at once, also 'by telegram that he had no objection to the whole of the Mutair doing so, as well as other Hassa tribes.

In 1929, mjjh return for the Gheikh’s cooperation with us against Xbn Saudis rebellious tribes, we gave him an undertaking that we would endeavour to secure for him a satisfactory solution of the Nejdi blockade and of other outstanding questions with Ibn Saud. The sheikh indicated that in his view tne only satisfactory solution of the blockade problem would be on the following lines;- (1) All trade between Koweit and Nejd, including Bedouin trade, to be free. (2) Customs posts may be placed all along the Koweit frontier, should Ibn Saud desire to impose duty on goods leaving Koweit in charge of his subjects for Nejd and Bedouin tribes. Should there be difficulty about water, the posts may be located at four named watering places within Koweit; rations for the posts to be supplied from Koweit without delay and without tax being levied. (3) A manifest containing a list of all goods exported to be sent by the Sheikh with each caravan amir, and copies of all manifests issued to oe submitted direct by His Excellency to Ibn Saud at the end of each month. The King would thus be able to punish the responsible amir should any difference be found at destination. 2 . At a subsequent stage the Sheikh of Koweit expressed his readiness to waive certain claims against Ibn Baud for compensation in respect of raids into Koweiti territory and monies advanced by the Sheikh or his predecessors to Ibn Saud, amounting to 14^ lakhs 2119 5000 8/33- 2 - i N i ? ' of rupees, in return for a firm promise to abandon the blockade. 3. It proved impossible for various reasons to broach the blockade question with Ibn Saud until January 1931, when at a meeting between His hajesty and the late Sir Hugh Biscoe, then Political. Hesident, the Resident, with very great difficulty, persuaded the King to agree to the appointment of commissioners for either side, consisting of well- known merchants, with possibly one official to meet try to work out a compromise agreeable to both 'sides (the recommendations of the Commission to be ad referendum to both parties). The Sheikh of Koweit, while sceptical a s to the probable outcome of the appointment of commissioners, agreed to this proposal, which, after discuss-ion, was also accepted by the interested departments of H.M.G. and by the Government of Inula. Sir Anurew Ryan was accordingly instructed to make a formal proposal regarding it to the Heujaz Government. It was decided that sir Andrew Ryan should simultaneously indicate informally to the Hedja.z Government that tne Sheikh of Koweit would be prepared, as part of a satisfactory settlement, to abandon his claims against Ibn Saud. Idmoxtunately, it proved that the Sheikh, without our knowledge, had been in direct correspondence with Ibn baud on the subject of these claims and had incautiously written a letter, in reply to a letter ii very general terms from the King, which the latter took as representing an abandonment of the claims in Uih u i tL/Hin clrcums ^nces refused^ to proceed further with the appointment of commissioners to deal with the blockade question until/Minute Paper.

The Sheikh, while admitting the correspondence in question, maintained that it had never been intended to hear the construction placed on it hy Ihn Saud, But he was most reluctant to pursue the matter with His Iviajesty, and matters have ! since remained more or less at this stage. The interdepartmental meeting to consider Koweit policy which took place on the 5th Gctahek’^Foreign Office print on p.z.1384/34 flagged) deciaed after consideration of the circumstances that the issue of the Saudi blockade of Koweit should be taken up with Ibn Saud by H.M.G. on the basis of their obligation to protect the interests of Koweit, and that in so far as a positive proposal was required we should urge acceptance of the scheme originally suggested by the Sheikh in 1929 for the establishment of a series of frontier posts - a proposal which, so far as could be judged, was both practicable and equitable. 5. Owing first to the anxiety of the Foreign Office to dispose of the Transjordan-Saudi Arabia dispute, and secondly to our aesire to reach general ! agreement on the main question of our own policy towards Koweit, no further advance was made in the matter until torch of this year. The Foreign Office 2119 5000 8/33 then/- 4 - tiienagreed that now that agreement haa been reached between us on Koweit policy generally the question of j the blockade shoulci be taken up and pressed with Ibn Saud as a major issue. It was decided that before action could be taken at Jedcia we must, however, | ascertain whether the sheikh hact agreed to abandon all claims other than the personal loan (see the Secretary of State’s telegram of 14th torch, No.705, on P.z.1756/34). Unfortunately, as will be seen from the corresponaence enclosed In the Resident’s express letter of 7th April, on P.Z.2587/34, the sheikh has not merely made no advance to meet us, but has in fact adopted a slightly more rigid*,attitude than in the past. The position was considered at an inter- epartmental meeting at the Foreign Office on 8 th June in the light cf the views expressed by the Resident in ms express letter of 7th April, it was felt that it was as impossible for us now as it had been a year ago to give the sheikh categorical assurances such as he required. Re$)onsibility for the impasse which had been reached rested entirely with him, since had he not foolishly entered into direct correspondence with Ibn Saua on this subject we should some months ago have been in a position to press the Sauuis on the question! of the blockade. Moreover, the sheikh could not have it Doth ways. He.could not at once take the line that while Ibn saud’s interpretation of the correspondence was incorrect be was not prepared to make this clear to., the King, and yet expect us to press the blockade issue on Ibn Saud in the face of a declaration by tne Kinj that he would|iot take it further unless and until 1 | | | he Was reassul&gt;e &lt;i on the matter of the correspondence \ ln qUestion - Jt was relt at the same time that itjwas desirable to make a further effort to persuade the 'W aMinute Paper.

October 11, 1933. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. ®[E 6077/16/91] No. 1. Final Record of a Meeting held at the Foreign Office on October 5 to discuss Relations between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Sheikh of Koweit. THE following were present at the meeting : Mr. G. W. Rendel {in the Chair), Foreign Office. Mr. K. R. Johnstone, Foreign Office. Sir A. Ryan, His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. Lieutenant-Colonel T. C. Fowle, Political Resident Mr. J. G. Laithwaite, India Office. in the Persian Gulf. The meeting had before it Sir Andrew Ryan’s note of the 16th August, regarding the attitude of King Ibn Saud towards Koweit (see Appendix A). Mr. Rendel outlined the present political situation of Koweit. The Sheikh was tied to His Majesty’s Government by his treaty engagements, but at the same time was being courted both by Ibn Saud and by Iraq. It was . c , le p a y^ p at ., t “ sheikhdom was not in a position which in the ordinary way would enaMe it t stand alone either as a political or as an economic entity and that it must there fore depend on some stronger Power. He understood that it was th ? P® 11 ^ 0 h Maiestv’s Government, in view of the strategic importance of Koweit, not to allow it to hi absorbed by any foreign Power but so far as was possible, to maintain their present treaty relationship with the bheikh. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that Koweit was at the present moment of more vital importance to His Majesty’s Government than 1 ^ a d been at any Ume u had hulked so orominently as the terminus of the Bagdad Railway oeiore me war S was Ae result fiL of the development of the Australia which had made the Gulf as important imperially from the an* stand noint as was the Suez Canal for naval reasons, and, secondly, owing to the expira- lion of the mandatory Ainie in Iraq and the uncertainty of the future relations of His Majesty’s Government with that country. So long as Iraq had been unde BrRish control the?e had been a natural tendency to give it prior considerat on snsaf ass “ s assume that Koweit wh i chi on the assumption in question, of operations of defh &gt; , j t j iati we were violating her neutrality. ™ fA 0t rth C&lt; ^ a - to Qie East Koweit FU l^eW t o nlok more and “ore vital as a station on that route, especially if our SSHB.-W s&amp;x&amp;sz&amp;isszr — range of the aircraft using the Arabian route increased. M, R..M ttS^SX regards Iiaq. o , might have to be modified, and he considered that relationship with that ^eaty and of the position of the Royal Air £ l' £ /SSK. doubLl. On .h, general I»in. a! ,«ne. he [935 1—1]2 observed that one of the main points to be borne in mind was the fact that Koweit was not naturally independent from either the geographical or the economic point of view. It was' a port without a hinterland, cut off at present by the Iraqi and Saudi frontiers from the territory which it would naturally feed, and at present denied free communication with the country behind it. Moreover, even its present trade might be jeopardised by the development of the Saudi port at Ras Tanura under the auspices of the American oil concessionaires on the Hasa coast. What was even more important was that its fresh-water supply was not derived from its own territory, but had to be imported from Iraq. It was for consideration, therefore, whether it would, in fact, be practicable for His Majesty’s Government to maintain the independence of Koweit as against its neighbours, at any rate on the present basis of a rather loose and ill-defined dependence on His Majesty’s Government. Colonel Fowle concurred generally in Mr. Rendel’s description of the economic position of the sheikhdom. He pointed out, however, that Koweit had always been the port of the deserts of northern Arabia, as Bahrein was the port of Central Arabia. In regard to the position of Koweit vis-a-vis of Iraq, he added that beside the influence which Iraq could exert by controlling Koweit’s fresh- Avater supply, it was also powerful enough to bring pressure to bear upon Koweit over, for instance, the question of smuggling. Mr. Rendel agreed that both Iraq and Saudi Arabia were in a position to exert strong pressure on Koweit. This being so, the rivalry between them over Koweit was likely to increase, unless, of course, Saudi Arabia disintegrated. The present position of Koweit between these two States was weak, and Sir Andrew Ryan’s note showed how powerful an attraction Ibn Saud could exert. The question, therefore, was whether His Majesty’s Government would not be Avell advised to develop and tighten up their own relations with Koweit in order to strengthen its position. It had, in fact, been suggested that it might be more advantageous to convert our present treaty relationship into a definite protectorate, on, for instance, the analogy of the Hadramaut, which was now regarded as part of the Aden Protectorate, but where our treaty relationship with the local rulers and obligations to afford them protection had been if anything looser than those we had towards Koweit. Would not a protectorate ensure Koweit more effectively against absorption than the present attempt to maintain the sheikhdom as a kind of political vacuum in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Laithwaite drew attention to three points :— (a) At present the obligations of His Majesty’s Government to Koweit were represented by their undertaking to grant £C good offices ” in respect of Koweit under the 1899 agreement, by their promise of 1907 that “the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him,” and their undertaking of the 3rd November, 1914, that Koweit, in the event of a victory over the Turks, would be recognised by us as an independent princi pality under British protection. They were thus very general in terms, and, in accordance with our normal policy on the Arab littoral, which dated from a period in which it was possible to protect a sea port by action from the sea, but not to afford effective help inland, we had consistently endeavoured to limit our obligations, save as regards good offices to Koweit town and the immediately adjoining area. Recent experience had, however, shown that in cases of intervention from outside it was in fact necessary to give the Sheikh, at our ^ lsc /^! or b an d on our own terms, a measure of active assistance up to the limit of his frontiers and with the development of aircraft the pioblem of inland defence was now less difficult. This was to some extent a strengthening of his strict treaty position, as also possibly an extension of our strict treaty obligations. (b) With regard to the suggested establishment of a protectorate it was necessary to consider what the reactions of the Sheikh would be, and also what effect the proclamation of a protectorate might have on the ot ei Arab rulers of the Gulf. It would in any case be wiser not o make an overt proclamation of this nature, since both in Bahrein and m qjatar and along the Trucial Coast it would probably rouseapprehensions and might even cause the local sheikhs to turn away from His Majesty’s Government and consider submitting themselves to Persia or to Ibn Saud. (c) The basis of His Majesty’s Government’s present treaty relationship with Koweit was unsatisfactory. In the first place, it did not rest, as was the case with Bahrein, Muscat and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, on a long series of formal treaties with the Sheikh dating back for over a century, or, as in the case of Qatar, on a comprehensive treaty, but was based only on a comparatively brief correspondence exchanged between the sheikhs and His Majesty’s Government since 1899 and on the reciprocal engagements, still presumably binding since they had not been abrogated, entered into in connexion with the lease of Bunder Shweikh in 1907; secondly, there were certain gaps, e.g., we had no slavery agreement with Koweit. It might, he suggested, be possible to fill in the gaps left by this correspondence and tighten our control in that way. An example was our recent request to the Sheikh for certain undertakings in regard to air facilities in his sheikhdom, one result of which would be to concentrate effective control of such facilities, whether military or civil, in the hands of His Majesty’s Government. Another instance was the recent proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council so as to place responsibility for jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners in the hands of His Majesty’s Government. A gradual tightening of our control of this character, particularly if pursued as a definite policy on all convenient occasions, would, he thought, at once avoid the difficulties involved in establishing a formal protectorate and would make it very much simpler. Colonel Fowle expressed the view that there did not seem to be any inter mediate position possible between a treaty relationship with the Sheikh on the present lines and a full protectorate. The Sheikh would certainly be unwilling to agree to the sheikhdom becoming a formal protectorate, and, yrima facie, he (Colonel Towle) was not much in favour of it. He agreed, however, that it would be advisable, on suitable opportunities, to try to tighten up our control over the Sheikh. . On being questioned whether he did not consider that our restricted position vis-a-vis of the Sheikh in regard to the Koweit oil concession indicated the essential weakness of our treaty position, he replied that our difficulties in that case had been due rather to the special undertakings given to the United States Government in that matter than to any weakness in our normal control over the Sheikh under the treaty engagements. Had we been able, without violating our pledges to the United States Government, to tell the Sheikh that we required him to give the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company he would have done so. Mr. Rendel drew attention to the fact that in the event of serious misgovern- ment by the Ruler of Koweit such as prejudicially to affect foreign citizens in Koweit, we might find ourselves in a difficult position vis-a-vis of the foreign Power concerned. Mr. Laithwaite said that on this point he thought that Bahrein might be regarded as locus classicus. We had for many years put up with a considerable degree of misgovernment by Sheikh Isa. But when conditions at last, m our view, became intolerable, we did not hesitate to intervene and to depose the Sheikh. There were obvious arguments for doing so, for were we not to intervene when misgovernment had reached a certain pitch, it would be most difficult for us to justify a refusal to allow foreign Governments which might be affected to take steps to protect the interests of their nationals. He did not think that there need be any apprehension in the case of Koweit that we would fail to bring pressure on a sheikh who was abusing his position, once it became necessary to do so. The case for early intervention would probably be stronger now that the Gulf was so much more in the public eye. The meeting then went on to consider relations between Ibn Saud and Koweit. [935 1—1] B 2Sir Andrew Ryan stated that he had been impressed by the apparent weakness of His Majesty’s Government’s position vis-d-vis of Ibn Sand with regard to Koweit. His Majesty’s Government were not strongly placed when it became necessary to warn Ibn Sand to keep his hands off Koweit, since they were committed to maintaining that Koweit was technically an independent State, p.- A case in point had been the Saudi intrusions into Koweit territory, referred to^ . in paragraph 3 of his note, when Saudi officials had performed acts of authority within the limits of the sheikhdom. Colonel Fowle pointed out that, in fact, our treaty engagements did entitle us to prevent foreign Powers from dealing direct with the Sheikh. Ibn Sand had certainly been informed of the special relations existing between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government. Speaking generally, he added that, in fact, little trouble was likely to be experienced with foreigners in Koweit, so long as it remained a Bedouin town ruled by a Bedouin sheikh, and not, like Bahrein, a relatively cosmopolitan commercial centre. If, however, oil were discovered within the sheikhdom, it was possible that difficulties might arise. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the Arabian air route was likely to develop quickly. If Iraq were to adopt an anti-foreign policy, and Koweit became correspondingly more important as a centre of international traffic, other countries might well wish to take advantage of the facilities there. We might well find many foreign Powers becoming increasingly interested in Koweit. We could not have it both ways, and should sooner or later have to define our position. His Majesty’s Government ought, therefore, to orient their policy definitely either towards the greater independence of the sheikhdom or towards a tightening of their own control. Mr. Laithwaite agreed, and added that, in his view, our policy should be directed towards a closer control, but that it was undesirable to hasten any overt declaration of full control, such as the establishment of a protectorate would be. Such a declaration might well frighten the Sheikhs of Bahrein and of the Trucial Coast, and do more harm than good. The policy to be followed was, therefore, one of occasional minor adjustments, as these became necessary, tending to increase, or at any rate not to relax, our control over the sheikhdom. Reveiting to the question of Saudi-Koweiti relations, Sir Andrew Ryan diew attention to the toleration extended by His Majesty’s Government to direct correspondence on business matters between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud. This, no less than the independence formula, placed us in a weak position in defending Koweit, and the correspondence in question was of such long standing that it was difficult now for us to take the line that Ibn Saud should write to us rather than to the Sheikh. What was desirable was that we should be able to tell Ibn Saud openly that we were responsible for defending the Sheikh’s interests in anv given dispute. J &amp; Mr. Laithwaite said that the explanation of the system of direct correspon- dence between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud was, he thought, that it dated from a Lime when the latter was not so important a ruler as he had since become, and when we had taken the view that it was unnecessary to take too strict a view of correspondence between sheikh and sheikh. That'position was now changed and reconsideration seemed desirable. Ibn Saud was well aware both that His Majesty s Government conducted the foreign relations of Koweit and that the Sheikh had undertaken certain obligations towards us. He agreed that it was now necessary to exert stricter control over the correspondence in question and to emphasise our own special position in Koweit vis-a-vis of Ibn Saud more definitely tfian had been the case while Iraq was still under British control He suggested that we might (a) check Ibn Saud when he appeared to be presuming too far with regard to Koweit-a policy which we were, in fact, now prepare! to follow m regard to the Saudi-Koweit blockade; and (b) !nforce P stricter regulations on the Sheikh in the matter of direct correspondence. 0 Colonel agreed. Such action would show both the Sheikh and Ibn ^aud that we considered the Sheikh to be under our direction If we did not take some such step as this, we might be in danger of finding ourselves faced with the results of a kind of conspiracy between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud. We ought therefore, to write to tV Sheikh in the sense that we noted that his private5 W entitle ftn Sail he She! in fact, so Ion? as Mreiu liscoyered -0 develop it became Sic. oiler We mifflt veil, fe r position, definite!? ightening should le any overt would k le Trucial therefore, ending to rm Ep : to direct id. This, defending hat it was ithertlan Ibn Sand any given jorrespon- ;d from a come, and a view of changed, that His [that tie ; at it ^ stion and and move .troi He iresinni 11 ? prepared e stricter andl^ e did not acedwiti s pi'iv a!e m e l correspondence with Ibn Sand had assumed an increasing importance, and tell him that that correspondence must now cease. Mr. Rendel concurred. A straightforward control of this nature would be easier to maintain, and would prevent a repetition of such incidents as the letter ‘in which Ibn Sand had recently tried to detach the Sheikh of Koweit from his onnexion with His Majesty’s Government. Sir A. Ryan also concurred, and drew attention to the success with which Ibn Sand was spreading the idea that he might naturally absorb Koweit and was bound to do so sooner or later. He pointed ont that such an idea could never have prevailed to the extent to which it had, if His Majesty’s Government had equally definitely made known their own special position with regard to Koweit. The meeting then discussed what point in the correspondence between the Sheikh and Ibn Sand could most suitably be taken up in connexion with the reprimand which it wms proposed to address to both parties. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that if it were discovered that the Sheikh had committed himself to Ibn Saud in regard to the grant of an oil concession m the Koweit Neutral Zone, this might be an excellent opportunity for checking him. The question then arose, what action could be taken if the United States Government, in dealing with whom His Majesty’s Government had consistently emphasised the Sheikh’s independence, were to produce communications from him regarding the grant of a concession in the Neutral Zone? It was, however, agreed that His Majesty’s Government could demonstrate from the Sheikh’s treaty engagements that he had not been entitled to make any such grant without our knowledge and consent. Eventually it was agreed that the most suitable occasion for the proposed representations to the Sheikh and Ibn Sand would be Ibn Sand’s letter suggesting terms for the settlement of the Saudi blockade of Koweit and warning the Sheikh against His Majesty’s Government. At the conclusion of the meeting Sir A. Ryan raised the question of the pressure which might be exerted upon Ibn Saud in regard to the Saudi blockade of Koweit This blockade had one of two purposes, either to complete the economic strangulation of Koweit and lead to its complete absorption in Saudi Arabia or else the safeguarding of Saudi economic interests. His Majesty s Government could not possibly allow the first of these alternatives. The question, therefore, was what real force there was in Ibn Sand’s suggestion that his own purely economic interests required the maintenance of the blockade. Colonel Fowle suggested that we might well revert to the Sheikh’s proposal that Ibn Sand should have customs posts at a given place along but outside the Koweiti border, and that this might, if necessary, be coupled with a system of manifests for Koweiti-Sandi trade. He gave it as his opinion that even if Ibn Sand were to develop Ras Tannra, possibly with American help this port was not likely to compete seriously with Koweit, which served quite a different hmtei- land nor was there any port between the Koweit area anc the Ras Tanura aie who had great expeile , oomprehensive report. It was agreed that present meeting and “ s ubmy a cornp^ Resident’s report and this course should be question of future policy m Koweit The conclusions of the meeting were as follows m That in dealing with Ibn Saud, His Majesty's Government should (1) T increasingly fmphasise the closeness of their relations with the Sheikh (21 That the Sheikh should be told that his personal correspondence with T^STloXl 0 “Jfoweit should be taken up with (3) ^^Ibn^aud'l^^^s’Ma^esty’s Government on the basis of their obligation to protect the interests of Koweit.Ait -1 (4) That on receipt of the despatch promised by Colonel Fowle the whole question of relations between His Majesty’s Government and Koweit might suitably be referred for further discussion to the Middle East Official Sub-Committee, to which a note should be sent recording the points discussed at the present meeting, and setting forth the argu-/~ ments for and against the possible declaration of a protectorate. ^ Appendix A. Note by Sir Andrew Ryan. Ibn Sand’s Attitude towards Koweit. I HAVE been turning over in my mind for some time the possibility that it may be a definite object of Ibn Sand’s policy to reduce Koweit to a position of dependence on him somewhat similar to that of Asir from 1926 to 1930. This is in the nature of a pure speculation, but it is a speculation so interesting that I think it worth while to collect the principal data bearing on it. It must be admitted at the outset that, if Ibn Saud had such an idea in his head, he would realise the need for great caution lest he should indispose His Majesty’s Govern ment. His only formal obligation towards the latter is that contained in article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, but he understands very well the implications of the words therein “who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment.” On the other hand, he has seen His Majesty’s Government tolerate direct correspondence on business subjects between him and the Sheikh of Koweit. He might think that they would not react over strongly if he and the Sheikh confronted them with the fait accompli of a political deal. 2. Apart from the correspondence, of which we have knowledge, there has been other intercourse between the rulers, notably the Sheikh’s visit to Riadh in 1932, the secret messages brought by Ibn Saud's confidential messenger to the Sheikh early this year, and the Sheikh’s mysterious dashes intoNejd last February, when Colonel Dickson surmised that he had gone to meet some high Saudi personage, possibly Ibn Saud himself. 3. I may interpolate, as a minor indication of Ibn Saud’s attitude, a reference to two occasions on which it has been suggested or hinted by his Ministry for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty's Government should not concern themselves with affairs between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. I class them as minor, because this position has never been categorically asserted. The first was when, in reply to a complaint of mine regarding Saudi encroachments on Koweit territory, which had perturbed His Majesty's Government, the reply was in effect : “Sorry you have been perturbed. You need not have been if the matter had been pursued through An. Nahsi. On another occasion Fuad Bey, in rather light conversa tion, asked me why we concerned ourselves in matters between his Government and Koweit. 4. The personal relations between the two rulers are peculiar. Ibn Saud grew up at Koweit, and it is sometimes said that he has shown himself ungrateful hlS ^ ^ 0 H ner k os ! s - It is said by others, I do not know on what precise grounds, that Mubarak treated Ibn Saud very badly. Anyhow, through all the relations theie runs a thread of old friendship, however flimsy and however frayed by requent friction over raids, the embargo and so on. It has helped towards the settlement of minor questions. It has not deterred Ibn Saud from enforcing the embargo on trade, but the embargo on trade has not destroyed the Sheikh’s ostensible friendliness towards Ibn Saud. I hey are “Arcades ambo, ” as I once wrote, ^ n( I they both combine some real friendship for His Majesty’s Government and a healthy fear of them with a good deal of fundamental mistrust. 5. The point of my theory or speculation is that, if the Sheikh of Koweit were at all willing to be “ Asirised.” Ibn Saud could make the proposal quite attractive on the following lines, if I may venture to put into his mouth the sort of language he could use :— {a) \ ou aie not really independent, my dear fellow. You are under the thumb of the English. They might annex you at any moment, or even present you to Iraq. If you must be dependent on some one, whybe dependent on those untrustworthy imperialists, when you might depend, without being exactly dependent, on a man like me, old friend, fellow Moslem, fellow Arab and the one big independent man in Arabia ? (b) “I don’t like squeezing you, I really don’t, with that embargo. As things are at present, I have to think of my own interests. But if your interests were mine, we could easily have an understanding. A sort of ‘ Zollverein’ as they say; same duties levied in our ports; free competition between yours and mine; free trade over our land border. What have the English done about it ? Nothing; because they cannot get at me. £ Sois mon frere et je te fais vivre. Sois le leur et je te tue.’ (c) “I should not mop you up, of course. You would rule your State under an understanding with me. Indeed, if you were in with me, I might recognise a sort of influence of yours over those three Lost Tribes that you always want back. Look at how I treated the Idrisi. I made a sensible agreement with him in 1926. He remained a ruler with tribal influence. I did not take charge in his country, until he got into such a mess that he asked me to in 1930. I did not hit him on the head until the poor mutt thought he could try conclusions with me in 1932. He looked to foreigners and he got it in the neck from me. (d) “You have had trouble with Iraq over your property there. What has England been able or even willing to do for you ? If I had the right to protect you against third parties, you would find that / knew how to see you through. {e) “ Then there’s oil. People are after it in my country, and in yours, and in the Neutral Zone. Why not have an agreed policy and present a common front to the West? You know what the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is. Another name for the British Government, as we saw in Persia the other day, even if we had not known it before. Take my tip and keep them out at all costs. Play about with Holmes, if you like. But don’t trust him, and remember that in the long run your best policy would be to deal, like me, direct with American interests, using the others to put up the price.” 6. It is easy enough to detect fallacies in the above imaginary address. I do not know enough about the Sheikh of Koweit to judge what his reaction to it would be, but many an Arab, not well pleased with British protectors, might find it convincing enough to be attracted into Ibn Saud s parlour. 7. I wrote the above notes in Jedda at the end of June. I thought them too hypothetical at that time to submit them for official consideration. They may, however be worthy of some attention now that the Political Resident and I are both in this country, and Colonel Dickson will soon be available for consultation. Except that Ibn Saud continues to show a marked anxiety to avoid all compli cations, I see no material reason to modify what I wrote nearly three months ago, subject’always to the consideration that I merely suggest an uncertain working theory to be tested by further examination and by keeping a close watch on future developments. August 16, 1933. Appendix B. Note. Obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the Sheikh of Koweit. (A)— Nature of the Undertakings given. By the agreement of the 23rd January, 1899, His Majesty’s Government formally assured the Sheikh “of the good offices of the British Government towards you your heirs and successors, so long as you, your heirs and successorsI 8 scrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said bond, ’ under which the Sheikh had pledged himself, his heirs and successors, not to receive the agent or representative of any Power or Government at Koweit without the previous sanction of the British Government, and not to cede, sell, lease or mortgage, or give for occupation or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory to the_ Government or subjects of any other Power without the previous consent of His Majesty’s Government. 2. By article 9 of the Secret Agreement of the 15th October, 1907, for the lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore, the Political Agent intimated that he was ‘ ‘ duly authorised on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to promise, and do hereby promise, that the town of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Mobarak’s arrangements in the matter of customs, &amp;c., and all his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and of his heirs after him, and . . . In consideration of this promise the Sheikh undertook not to levy customs dues in excess of 4 per cent, on goods imported or exported by “the subjects of the aforesaid English Government,” save with the approval of that Government. 3. The undertakings given in writing to the Sheikh on the 3rd November, 1914, in return for his co-operation against the Turks, contained an assurance that “ Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” . (B) —Construction of the Undertakings given to the Sheikh. 4. As will be seen, the engagements entered into by His Majesty’s Govern ment with the Sheikh are in rather general terms, and it is perhaps desirable briefly to record the construction placed upon them at various times by His Majesty’s Government. 5. In 1901, when there was a Turkish threat to Koweit, the Viceroy was informed (Secretary of State’s telegram No. 45 of the 4th December, 1901) that this ^appears to constitute a distinct violation of the Sultan’s promise” (to respect the status quo), “ and in these circumstances His Majesty’s Government are prepared to support the Sheikh, and will not tolerate an attack by Turkish troops or ships upon Koweit. The Sheikh should not leave Koweit, and should continue to observe his engagement with us.” The assurance given is clearly limited by the words “ in these circumstances ” to this particular case. More over, it is not conditional on, and is independent of the Sheikh’s observance of his agreement of 1899. 6. On the 21st March, 1902, Lord Lansdowne, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in a memorandum on the situation in Koweit, remarked that our obligations toward the Sheikh were “ as ill-defined as the boundaries of his principality. We have distinctly announced that he does not enjoy British ‘ protection ’; on the other hand, we once made him a present of £1,000, and promised him our ‘ good offices,’ whatever that may mean. When we made this promise we were, I feel no doubt, thinking of Koweit proper, if there is such a thing, and not of Boobyan or other outskirts over which the Sheikh has rights of one sort or another We might, it seems to me, explain (1) to the Porte; (2) to the Sheikh; and (3) to the foreign Powers immediately interested the objects of our policy. I should be inclined to say that our engagements to Koweit do not extend beyond the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name, and to endeavour to obtain the adhesion of the Porte and of the Sheikh to our approximate definition of that district ” 7. Later, in 1902, it was reported that Ibn Rashid was making energetic preparation for attacking Ibn Saud, then the Sheikh of Koweit’s friend, and the Sheikh was warned not to take any action likely to bring him into difficulties with either Nejd or Turkey. About the same time the Sheikh informed us that Ibn Saud had with him a gun presented by the Turks, and asked for a gift of two or three guns, which it was understood were wanted for Jehara to protect Koweit against land attack. The Viceroy (telegram No. 39 of the 3rd October 1902) proposed to reply that the Sheikh’s request could not be granted, “but that, piovided he complied with the injunction conveved to him m pursuance of your telegram of the 4th December, 1901 (see paragraph 5 above), His Majesty’sGovernment would charge themselves with the defence of Koweit district. ^ le Secretary of State, after consultation with the Foreign Office (Foreign Office letter of the 13th October, 1902), replied (telegram No. 133 of the 14th October, 1902) : “I approve your proposed reply about the guns, provided Koweit district is clearly defined as the district adjoining or close to the bay of that ^name. ,, This assurance similarly admits of being read as an assurance ad hoc, fcmd it is relevant that when, in April 1911, enquiry was made by the Secretary of State for India of the Government of India whether the definition in question of Koweit territory had been communicated to the Sheikh, they replied that it might be assumed that it had, but that it “ only referred to our pledge to defend him against Ibn Rashid, who was threatening the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit ” (telegram of the 6th April, 1911). 8. The more specific undertakings embodied in the Bunder Shweikh lease of 1907, and quoted in paragraph 2 above, may be regarded as to some extent committing us in respect of ‘ c the town of Koweit and its boundaries. The phrase ‘ ‘ its boundaries ’ ’ is, however, very vague, and could perhaps most reasonably be construed as applying to the immediate district around Koweit town. The discussions as to our obligations to the Sheikh which took place in 1911, and which are summarised in paragraphs 9 to 12 below, appear to have turned essentially on the undertakings of 1899. 9. In 1911,' in connexion with the Anglo-Turkish negotiations, the question of our obligations was examined in some detail. The Government of India, on being asked, with reference to Lord Lansdowne’s memorandum of 1902, to which reference is made in paragraph 6 above, to “ define the region to which our obligation extends,” and “whether they accepted” general description of boundaries in Persian Gulf Gazetteer, p. 1059, &amp;c., replied : We are of opinion that (1) our obligations extend to the limits of the Sheikh s teriitory, (2) these limits, to the best of our knowledge, are defined with fair accuracy by Lorimer, especially as regards northern portion. ...” 10. The Secretary of State for India, in the light of the Government of India’s views, wrote as follows to the Foreign Office (the 8th April, 1911) :— “ Viscount Morley is not aware on what grounds the opinion expressed by the Marquess of Lansdowne in his memorandum of the 21st March, 1902, is based, but he observes that the language used is very tentative, and, so far as he knows, the subject was never pursued along the lines suggested by his Lordship, except in the case of the attack on the immediate neighbour hood of Koweit threatened by Ibn Rashid in the autumn of 1902. It will be seen from the Government of India’s telegram of the 6th April that this incident does not affect their opinion that our general obligations extend to the limits of Koweit territory as described in Vol. II, pp. 1059-1061, of Lorimer’s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, copy of which is in your possession. In this Lord Morley concurs; that is to say, he thinks that, in the event of unprovoked aggression by the Turks or by Arab tribes under Turkish control, upon those limits, His Majesty’s Government could not abstain from using their £ good offices ’ in the 8&gt;heikh s favour. But the term good offices ’ is a very vague one, which His Majesty’s Government are at liberty to interpret at their discretion, and which they would doubtless interpret with more or less strictness, according to the nature and locality of the aggression, and all the circumstances of the case. It would, however, in his Lordship’s opinion, be very impolitic to attempt, in dealing with the Sheikh, to whittle down the extent of our obligations, since such a course would fill his mind with suspicions, and could not fail to affect unfavourably oui prestige in the Persian Gulf. . . .” 11. The Foreign Office replied, on the 9th May, 1911, that Sir E. Grey concurred “ in tjie view of the Government of India, shared by Viscount Morley, that these obligations extend to the whole territory of the Sheikh, as described in the passage of LorimePs Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf to which your letter refers.” 12. In August 1911 the Government of India, after consultation with the Political Resident (Sir P. Cox), recommended that His Majesty’s Government should communicate to the Turks a copy of the agreement of 1899, with a note that His Majesty’s Government had subsequently informed the Sheikh that, so long as he and his heirs and successors acted up to their obligations under the agreement, we charged ourselves to support them and to protect Koweit against [935 1—1]— attack by land or sea. The Secretary of State for India, on closer consideration, found himself unable to accept this proposal. India Office letter to the Foreign Office of the 30th October, 1911, remarked :— “ The telegrams of the 4th December, 1901, and the 14th October, 1902, on which the Government of India appear to base the obligation to protect ' Koweit by land and sea, in the Marquess of Crewe’s opinion, clearly refev. only to the incidents that occasioned them, and cannot be understood to have given any general undertaking. Nor, in view of the fact that it has since been decided that our obligations extend to the whole of the Sheikh’s territory, as described in Lorimer’s Gazetteer, would it be safe to pledge ourselves to any specific method of defending them. As was pointed out by Lord Morley in this Office letter of the 8th April last, the term ‘ good offices ’ (which, by Colonel Meade’s letter of the 23rd January, 1899, we undertook to accord to the Sheikh) is a conveniently vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by His Majesty’s Government in 1901-02, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will, moreover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises. His Lordship would therefore suggest that the formula should run : ‘ As regards No. 1, His Majesty’s Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that, so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the agreement, His Majesty’s Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices,’ with, perhaps, the addition that His Majesty’s Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion.” The Foreign Office (Foreign Office letter dated the 1st November, 1911) accepted the proposed redraft and addition, and a communication in this sense was made to Tevfik Pasha in Sir Edward Grey’s letter of the 24th October, 1911. 13. The undertaking given in 1914 that Koweit “ shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection,” may be regarded as ^Porting a degree of responsibility for the protection of the principality as -m-.* 14 ' i 0n the death of Sileikh Mobarak his eldest son was informed, in March 1916, on his accession, by the Viceroy, that, “ so long as you act up to the existing arrangements with the British Government, you may expect the same support as was enjoyed by your father. A similar assurance was given on Sheikh Jabir’s Qnou ^ 191 / t0 kls brother and successor, Sheikh Salim, in March 1917. mkh bahm s conduct was unsatisfactory, and it was found necessary to warn him, through the Political Resident, on the 5th July, 1918, that the assurances (which presumably covered the assurance of the 3rd November, 1914) eonveved to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour, and that should Government’unfortunately be committed m future, he would be held personally responsible. J 15. In connexion with the operations against the Ikhwan in 1928 the question of the precise extent of the obligation of His Majestv’s Government for the defence of Koweit was considered in the India Office, when the view was put forward that consideration of our engagements suggested that on T^nt reading, our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit Up ° n t0 T teCt K ° Weit terri^asTwh^^fe nistory o± the 1928 discussion is, however, examined in greater detail in Appendix C, to the conclusions of which attention is invited.

We communicated article 9 of the Bunder Shweikh Agreement to Ibn Saud in 1928; and in 1933 the Political Agent, Koweit, and the Political Resident brought to notice the continued existence of the obligations of the Sheikh in regard to customs duties (paragraph 2 above) under article 10 of the agreement); (d) fourthly, that we have undertaken to recognise, and ^have in fact recognised, Koweit as an independent principality under British protection. No definition has been given or attempted of the meaning of ‘ ‘ British protection ’ ’ in this connexion; and, while prima facie the Sheikh would apparently be justified in claiming that it represented an assurance of effective protection in respect of the whole of his principality, there is some room for discussion as to its precise implications, and it is noteworthy that no appeal appears to have been made under it either by the present Sheikh or by his predecessors. J. G. LAITHWAITE India Office, October 11, 1933. Appendix C. Supplementary Note. Question of Liability for the Protection of Koweit against Aggression from Outside, 1928-29. Akhwan raids on Koweit had taken place in 1924 and 1925, but on an inconsiderable scale. The Akhwan raids on Iraq by Feisal-al-Dawish and the Mutair tribe at the end of 1927 had, however, more important reactions on the principality. At the request of the Sheikh His Majesty’s Government agreed to aerial reconnaissance over his territory; and, with his concurrence, it was later decided to withdraw the restrictions originally imposed by His Majesty’s Government on bombing in pursuit of raiders within Koweit territory. An Akhwan raid was successfully dealt with by Koweit forces at El Riqai on the 27th January, 1928, and whilst retiring into Nejd was pursued and successfully attacked by the Royal Air Force on two following days. A further raid occurred late in February, which was not opposed by ground forces, but was again success fully pursued by the Royal Air Force for two days. In view of the possibility of further serious developments, and of the recognised liability of His Majesty’s Government under existing engagements for the £ c protection of Koweit ’ (a phrase the exact scope of which is open to argument), further defence measures were now taken. A temporary air base (political objections to a permanent station being regarded as conclusive) was established in Koweit: a flight of aeroplanes and a detachment of armoured cars were despatched to the town for its protection : three vessels of the Persian Gulf Squadron (later reduced to one) were stationed off Koweit itself, and a landing party disembarked and remained on shore until the crisis had passed. All action taken was taken with the concurrence of the Sheikh, who was, in addition, allowed to purchase from the Government of India a small supply of machine guns and Lewis guns. After some discussion His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India agreed that his Excellency might be allowed to purchase armoured motor cars, on the understanding that they would be used only for defence, and would not cross the borders of Koweit in repelling raids save with the concurrence of the Political Agent. The crisis, however, passed off without incident, and the special forces which had been despatched to Koweit were withdrawn during the late spring. For financial reasons the Sheikh abandoned the idea of purchasing armoured cars. 2. On the 15th August, 1928, the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, in order to provide against all eventualities, asked permission to send car or air recon naissances into Koweit territory and to establish a defence air base at Koweit in the event of a raid. The India Office remarked (letter of the 22nd August, 1928) : “ The Secretary of State would see strong objection on political grounds to the use of Koweit territory in connexion with air operations against the Akhwan, by which Koweit was not directly or immediately threatened. Having regard, however, to the treaty liability of His Majesty’s Government for the protection of Koweit and to the action taken with the consent of the Sheikh in the early part of this year, he would see no objection to the grant of the authority now requested when Koweit was directly or indirectly menaced, on the understanding that the prior consent of the Sheikh was obtained from theA V2 Resident .... so far as may be practicable, on each specific occasion, and subject to the further restriction that there shall be no question of establishing a 'permanent base in Koweit territory.” As the result of considerable further interdepartmental discussion, the Air Officer Commanding was authorised on the 25th September, at his discretion, to carry out occasional reconnaissances over Koweit territory, both by air and car. £ ‘ His Majesty’s Government are anxious, however, that— (1) These reconnaissances shall be carried out as infrequently and in as unprovocative a manner as possible, and (2) That the Sheikh shall be given no ground for supposing that responsi bility for the defence of Koweit has been assumed by His Majesty’s Government, or that he himself has been relieved of his obligations in this respect. These considerations should be borne in mind by the Air Officer Commanding in acting under the authority now given him.” (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad, No. 306, dated the 25th September, 1928.) 3. Approval was subsequently given in view of a threatened Akhwan raid over the border, to the concentration, subject to the approval of the Sheikh, of armoured cars in Koweit ‘ ‘ for protection of Iraqi tribes for so long a period as one month.” (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad. No. 76, dated the 23rd February, 1929.) 4. In April 1929 the question of the policy to be adopted by the Sheikh of akinn i Koweit in the event of Nejdi tribesmen taking refuge from King Ibn Saud in Koweit territory arose, the air authorities suggested that the Sheikh should be asked to concur in the use, if necessary, of military force, the nature and extent of which should be determined by the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, for the purpose of preventing any such refugees from entering or remaining in any part of Koweit territory. On the 8th May, 1929, the India Office, in a letter to the Colonial Office, remarked: ££ Viscount Peel gathers that the attitude of the Sheikh is no longer in question and that he has already promised to endeavour to prevent refugees making use of Koweit territory. As regards the question of giving the Sheikh military assistance for this purpose, the Secretary of State remains of his previous opinion that it is undesirable to extend in any way the general liability hitherto accepted by His Majesty’s Government for the defence of Koweit territory, if this can at all be avoided It would, on the whole, be preferable, if possible, to avoid asking the Sheikh to concur in the use of military force, but if ... . such a request is still essential, he is prepared to agree that the Sheikh should be asked to concur ” The other Departments regarded it as essential to make a request in the sense referred to of the Sheikh and the necessary instructions were sent to the High Commissioner on the 11th May. 5. The view held as regards our liability for protection of Koweit during the operations of 1928-29 is perhaps best stated in the India Office letters of the 22nd August, 1928, and the 8th May, 1929, quoted in paragraphs 2 and 4 above. While our precise liability for protection was not investigated in any great detail, the course of action adopted in dealing with threats to Koweit territory appears to have been generally consistent with the construction of our liability suggested by Colonel Fowle m paragraph 10 of Bushire despatch No 1365-S of the 25th October, 1933.( : ) t n' n-ffi z? * .no, J - G - LAITHWAITE. India Office, I ebruary 6, 1934. P) [Note.—T he paragraph referred to runs as follows : — “The 1914 agreement states that in return for the Sheikh’s co-operation against the links Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.’ tins, unlike the phraseology of the previous agreements, is a most categorical assurance, and the word principality and not town being used, would seem definitely to place the responsibility of protecting the whole of the Koweit Sheikhdom on His Majesty’s Government. Personally, I cannot agree with the view quoted m paragraph 15 of the India Office note, that on a strict reading our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit as a whole.’ It is true, as pointed out m the note, paragraph 16 (d), that neither the present Sheikh, nor his predecessors, appear to have appealed under this agreement to His Majesty’s Government, but that hardly relieves us from our obligations. This does not imply, of course, that His Majesty’s Govern- TpTVi 0 ^ ga E 0n m i the i Sh ® l 1 kh completely of the responsibility of his own defence, ni i Sh&lt; ?

The difficulty is not a new one ; it dates from before the war. With the acquisition of El Hasa by Ibn Sand m 1913, Eejd aequo ed a sea fiont, but the sea front in question contained no port of any real value, and the efforts made from time to time by Ibn Saud, with the assistance at intervals of His Majesty’s Government, to secure that steamship lines such as the British Indian Steam Navigation Company should call at Ojair or at Qatif, or to develop Ojair, Qatif or Jubail, have proved _ abortive. In these circumstances a friendly understanding with the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit on the question of customs and transit dues is of great and evident importance to the Ruler of the Hejaz. Agreement with Bahrein, on the basis of a transit duty of 2 percent, was reached in 1920, after long discussion and much ill-feeling, with the assistance of the Government of India. Agreement with Koweit, which in 1923 levied a 4 per cent, duty on imports and a further 4 per cent, transit duty, has not yet been reached ; and since 1920 Ibn Saud has in consequence maintained an embargo on trade with Koweit with the result that the prosperity of the Principality, as indeed of Qasim and Hail in Nejd, has been seriously affected. 3)J. The position is briefly that Ibn Saud, on the ground that it is impossible to collect import d uty on the desert f rontie r between K uwait and Kejd, is anxious for the establishment either of a Nejdi Custom House in Koweit town, or of an arrangement under which export duty only should be collected on his beh.df at Koweit, a fixed sum being paid to Nejd instead of import duty. A third proposal,”’ made in 192o by the Sheikh s cousin Abdullah-as-Salim, was that the embargo should be raised on terms which would have involved the payment to Ibn Saud, through an Agent and Collector stationed in Koweit (Abdullah-as-Salim himself), of the whole'of the customs dues on goods exported from Koweit by land other than those destined for the Shj^kh’s own subjects or for Iraq.'f 3&amp; The objection of the Sheikh of Koweit to an agreement on the lines referred to above would appear to be due as much to the fear of allowing Ibn Saud to establish a stranglehold over Koweit as to anxiety to secuie an arrangement which shall not be economically unsatisfactory fiom his own point of view. An arrangement which would enable Ibn Saud to collect his own dues m Koweit would, as the Government of India pointed out in December 1923, appear prima facie to contravene both Ibn Sand’s engagements to His Majesty’s Government, and those into wnick His Majesty s Government have themselves entered with Ivoweit; while the extension in Koweit of the influence of the King of the Hejaz would in any event be objectionable—the engagements to Koweit of His Majesty’s Government apart—on general political grounds. 3?. There has been no development of importance in recent years, though the position cannot be satisfactory from the point of view of either Koweit or Nejd. A settlement which would be fair to both parties and unobjectionable from the standpoint of His Majesty’s Government could best be reached on the lines suggested in July 1923 by the then Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, which were accepted at the time by the Colonial Office and the India Office. Colonel Knox’s recommendation was that steps should be taken to obtain the agreement of Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit, firstly to the appointment of a Customs expert, preferably from India, to advise on the reform of the Koweit Customs, and on the shares of the Customs revenue to be apportioned to Nejd and Koweit respectively, and, secondly, to the appointment for five years of an official to serve under the contiol of the Political Agent and carry out the recommendations made by the Adviser. But in February 1924 the Political Resident reported that, proposals on these lines having been put to the interested parties, “neither Ibn Saud nor p ]004 / 2 4.

On the subject of direct correspondence between the Sheikh and King Ibn Saud, the Secretary of State, in the light of the considerations adduced in paragraphs 3~6 of the Foreign Office letter of 24th February, agrees with the course of action therein suggested by Sir John Simon. I am to request that you will be good enough to instruct Lt.-Ool. Dickson to approach the Sheikh accordingly and that you will in due course submit a further report when the result of Col. Dickson’s discussions with His Dxcellency is known and you are in a position to make recommendations as/ The Hon’ble the Political Sesident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.—as to the line to bo adopted in pursuing this matter with the Shaikh. 4. On like question of the obligations of His Majesty'** Government in respect of the protection of Koweit, you will observe that the Secretary of St^.te for Foreign Axxairs has expressed his agreement with the views contained in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Inula Oxxice letter of 1st F-,.u*u~ry 1934. The Foreign Office print of which a copy is sent herewith, contains a supplementary historical note prepared in this Office on the question of the view taken in 1928-29 as to the liability of His Majesty's government for the protection of Koweit against aggression irom outside. 5. The Secretary of Soete would be glad in due course to receive your views on the proposal referred to in paragraph 6 of Ir^ia Office letter of 1st February for the conclusion of a new and comprehensive treaty between His Majesty's G-overnment and the Sheikh of Koweit. xiie matter is not one of immediate urgency and it may well be that, as suggested by the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs, there may be advantage in deferring any reference to it until further progress has been made in the disposal of the vexed question of the relations of the Sneixh with King Ibn 3c,ud and the questions of oil concessions for Koweit proper and the Neutral Zone between Koweit and Nejd. 6. The interdepartmental meeting of 5th October recommended inter alia that the issue of the S,eadi blockade of Koweit should be taken up with King Ion S^ua by His Majesty's Severment on the basis of their ohli station/_ — — ~ obligation to protect the interests of Koweit. Disposal of this question has been deferred pending a decision on the matters discussed in the present letter, but steps are now being taken to deal with it as a ma'cter of urgency. 7. Copies of this letter are being sent for information to the G-overnment of India and to the Political Agent at Koweit. I urn, dir, Your obedient Servant,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT SECRET. (14377) Relations between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Sheikh of Koweit. [E 6077/16/91] 1 .—Final Record of a Meeting held at the Foreign Office, on October 5, 1933. THE following were present at the meeting :— Mr. G. W. Rendel (in the Chair), Foreign Office. Mr. K. R. Johnstone, Foreign Office. Sir A. Ryan, His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. Lieutenant-Colonel T. C. Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mr. J. G. Laithwaite, India Office. The meeting had before it Sir Andrew Ryan's note of the 16th August, regarding the attitude of King Ibn Saud towards Koweit (see Appendix A). Mr. Rendel outlined the present political situation of Koweit. The Sheikh was tied to His Majesty’s Government by his treaty engagements, but at the same time was being courted both by Ibn Saud and by Iraq. It was clear that the sheikhdom was not in a position which in the ordinary way would enable it to stand alone either as a political or as an economic entity, and that it must thcn^- fore depend on some stronger Power. He understood that it was the policy oi His Majesty’s Government, in view of the strategic importance of Koweit, not to allow it to be absorbed by any foreign Power, but, so far as was possible, to maintain their present treaty relationship with the Sheikh. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that Koweit was at the present moment of more vital importance to His Majesty’s Government than it had been at any UmB’ since it had bulked so prominently as the terminus of the Bagdad Railway betore the war This was the result first of the development of the air route to India and Australia, which had made the Gulf as important imperially from the air stand point as was the Suez Canal for naval reasons, and, secondly, owing to the expira tion of the mandatory regime in Iraq and the uncertainty of the future relations of His Majesty’s Government with that country. So long as Iraq had been under British control, there had been a natural tendency to give it prior consideration and the less important question of Koweit had been kept comparatively m the background. But now that Iraq had attained full independence, the position was changed and Koweit had once again assumed major importance. Geographically, Koweit occupied a key position at the head of the Persian Gulf, and one from which the Gulf could be controlled. In the event of war we could probably safely assume that Koweit would be on our side and her territory would afford us a base of operations of definite value, to the use of which, on the assumption m question, no objection could be raised on the ground that we were violating her neutrality. Further with the development of the Arabian coast air route to the East Koweit was likely to prove more and more vital as a station on that route, especially if om relations with Iraq should at any time become so strained that we were unable to rely on the use of the Iraqi aerodromes for the purposes of that route. Colonel Fowle suggested that in point of fact it might one day be possible to avoid the use of Iraq altogether, and fly direct from Palestine to Koweit, as the range of the aircraft using the Arabian route increased. Mr. Rendel concurred with Mr. Laithwaite's estimate of the position as regards Iraq. In view of recent events m Iraq it was possible that om who le relationship'with that country might have to be modified, and he considered that both the future of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and of the position of the Royal A i Force in Iraq must be regarded as doubtful. On the general point at issue, he 7329 [9823] Bobserved that one of the main points to be borne in muni was ilie fact that Koweit was not naturally independent from either the geographical or the economic point of view. It was a port without a hinterland, cut off at present by the Iraqi and Saudi frontiers from the territory which it would naturally feed, and at present denied free communication with the country behind it. Moreover, even its present trade might be jeopardised by the development of the Saudi port at Ras Tanura f under the auspices of the American oil concessionaires on the Hasa coast. What was even more important was that its fresh-water supply was not derived from its own territory, but had to be imported from Iraq. It was for consideration, therefore, whether it would, in fact, be practicable for His Majesty’s Government to maintain the independence of Koweit as against its neighbours, at any rate on the present basis of a rather loose and ill-defined dependence on His Majesty’s Government. Colonel Fowle concurred generally in Mr. Rendel’s description of the economic position of the sheikhdom. He pointed out, however, that Koweit haa always been the port of the deserts of northern Arabia, as Bahrein was the port of Central Arabia. In regard to the position of Koweit vis-a-vis of Iraq, he added that beside the influence which Iraq could exert by controlling Koweit’s fresh water supply, it was also powerful enough to bring pressure to bear upon Koweit over, for instance, the question of smuggling. Mr. Rendel agreed that both Iraq and Saudi Arabia were in a position to exert strong pressure on Koweit. This being so, the rivalry between them over Koweit was likely to increase, unless, of course, Saudi Arabia disintegrated. The present position of Koweit between these two States was weak, and Sir Andrew Ryan’s note showed how powerful an attraction Ibn Saud could exert. The question, therefore, was whether His Majesty’s Government would not be well advised to develop and tighten up their own relations with Koweit in order to strengthen its position. It had, in fact, been suggested that it might be more advantageous to convert our present treaty relationship into a definite protectorate, on, for instance, the analogy of the Hadramaut, which was now regarded as part of the Aden Protectorate, but where our treaty relationship with the local rulers and obligations to afford them protection had been if anything looser than those we had towards Koweit. Would not a protectorate ensure Koweit more effectively against absorption than the present attempt to maintain the sheikhdom as a kind of political vacuum in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Laithwaite drew attention to three points :— (a) At present the obligations of His Majesty’s Government to Koweit were represented by their undertaking to grant “ good offices ” in respect of Koweit under the 1899 agreement, by their promise of 1907 that “the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him,” and their undertaking of the 3rd November, 1914, that Koweit, in the event of a victory over the Turks, would be recognised by us as an independent princi pality under British protection. They were thus very general in terms, and, in accordance with our normal policy on the Arab littoral, which dated from a period in which it was possible to protect a sea port by action from the sea, but not to afford effective help inland, we had consistently endeavoured to limit our obligations, save as regards “good offices ’ to Koweit town and the immediately adjoining area. Recent experience had, however, shown that in cases of intervention from outside it was in fact necessary to give the Sheikh, at our discretion, and on our own terms, a measure of active assistance up to the limit of his frontiers and with the development of aircraft the problem of inland defence was now less difficult. This was to some extent a strengthening of his strict treaty position, as also possibly an extension of our strict treaty obligations. (b) With regard to the suggested establishment of a protectorate, it was necessary to consider what the reactions of the Sheikh would be, and also what effect the proclamation of a protectorate might have on the other Arab rulers of the Gulf. It would in any case be wiser not to make an overt proclamation of this nature, since both in Bahrein and in Qatar and along the Trucial Coast it would probably rouseapprehensions and might even cause the local sheikhs to turn away from His Majesty’s Government and consider submitting themselves to Persia or to Ibn Saud. (c) The basis of His Majesty’s Government’s present treaty relationship with Koweit was unsatisfactory. In the first place, it did not rest, as was the case with Bahrein, Muscat and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, on a long series of formal treaties with the Sheikh dating back for over a century, or, as in the case of Qatar, on a comprehensive treaty, but was based only on a comparatively brief correspondence exchanged between the sheikhs and His Majesty’s Government since 1899 and on the reciprocal engagements, still presumably binding since they had not been abrogated, entered into in connexion with the lease of Bunder Shweikh in 1907; secondly, there were certain gaps, e.g., we had no slavery agreement with Koweit. It might, he suggested, be possible to fill in the gaps left by this correspondence and tighten our control in that way. An example was our recent request to the Sheikh for certain undertakings in regard to air facilities in his sheikhdom, one result of which would be to concentrate effective control of such facilities, whether military or civil, in the hands of His Majesty’s Government. Another instance was the recent proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council so as to place responsibility for jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners in the hands of His Majesty’s Government. A gradual tightening of our control of this character, particularly if pursued as a definite policy on all convenient occasions, would, he thought, at once avoid the difficulties involved in establishing a formal protectorate and would make it very much simpler. Colonel Fowle expressed the view that there did not seem to be any inter mediate position possible between a treaty relationship with the Sheikh on the present lines and a full protectorate. The Sheikh would certainly be unwilling to agree to the sheikhdom becoming a formal protectorate, and, yrima facie, he (Colonel Fowle) was not much in favour of it. He agreed, however, that it would be advisable, on suitable opportunities, to try to tighten up our control over the Sheikh. B On being questioned whether he did not consider that our restricted position vis-a-vis of the Sheikh in regard to the Koweit oil concession indicated the essential weakness of our treaty position, he replied that our difficulties in that case had been due rather to the special undertakings given to the United States Government in that matter than to any weakness in our normal control ovei the Sheikh under the treaty engagements. Had we been able, without violating our pledges to the United States Government, to tell the Sheikh that we required him to give the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company he would have done so. Mr. Rendel drew attention to the fact that in the event of serious misgovern- ment by the Ruler of Koweit such as prejudicially to affect^ foreign citizens m Koweit, we might find ourselves in a difficult position vis-a-vis of the foreign Power concerned. Mr. Laithwaite said that on this point he thought that Bahrein might be regarded as locus classicus. We had for many years put up with a considerable degree of misgovernment by Sheikh Isa. But when conditions at m s C in view, became intolerable, we did not hesitate to intervene and to depose the Sheikh. There were obvious arguments for doing so, for were we not to intervene when misgovernment had reached a certain pitch, it would be most dimcuit or us to justify a refusal to allow foreign Governments which might be affected to take steps to protect the interests of their nationals. He did not think that there need be any apprehension in the case of Koweit that we would fail to bring pressure on a sheikh who was abusing his position, once it became necessary to do so. The case for early intervention would probably be stronger now that the Gulf was so much more in the public eye. The meeting then went on to consider relations between Ibn Saud and Koweit. [9823] ? 2Sir Andrew Ryan stated that he had been impressed by the apparent weakness of His Majesty’s Government’s position vis-d-vis of Ibn Sand with regard to Koweit. His Majesty’s Government were not strongly placed when it became necessary to warn Ibn Sand to keep his hands off Koweit, since they were committed to maintaining that Koweit was technically an independent State. A case in point had been the Saudi intrusions into Koweit territory, referred to f in paragraph 3 of his note, when Saudi officials had performed acts of authority within the limits of the sheikhdom. J Colonel Fowle pointed out that, in fact, our treaty engagements did entitle us to prevent foreign Powers from dealing direct with the Sheikh. Ibn Saud had certainly been informed of the special relations existing between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government. Speaking generally, he added that, in fact little trouble was likely to be experienced with foreigners in Koweit, so long as it remained a Bedouin town ruled by a Bedouin sheikh, and not, like Bahrein a relatively cosmopolitan commercial centre. If, however, oil were discovered within the sheikhdom, it was possible that difficulties might arise. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the Arabian air route was likely to develop quickly. If Iraq were to adopt an anti-foreign policy, and Koweit became correspondingly more important as a centre of international traffic other COl ^ ri j S mi 8 h \ wel } wlsh t0 take advantage of the facilities there. We might well find many foreign Powers becoming increasingly interested in Koweit. We could not have it both ways, and should sooner or later have to define our position His Majesty s Government ought, therefore, to orient their policy definitely either towards the greater independence of the sheikhdom or towards a tightening ol their own control. ^ 8 u* L^hwaite agreed, and added that, in his view, our policy should be directBd tcwards a closer control, but that it was undesirable to hasten any overt declaration of full control, such as the establishment of a protectorate would be. Such a declaration might well frighten the Sheikhs of Bahrein and of the Trucial Coast and do more harm than good. The policy to be followed was therefore one of occasional minor adjustments, as these became necessary, tending to increase, 01 at any rate not to relax, our control over the sheikhdom. A Reverting to the question of Saudi-Koweiti relations, Sir Andrew Rvan correspondence toleratlol \f ten k ded b y His Majesty’s Government to direct no less P thfn the “f’* 61 ' 8 , bet ween the Sheikh and Ibn Saud.

Such action would show both the Sheikh nrl Thu Saud that we considered the Sheikh to be under our direction if u-j 1 , take some such step as this, we might be in danger of finding Zselves faced vd°h therefore to wHt^to thTsheikb the She u ikh and Ibn Saud - We ought, e o e, to write to the Sheikh m the sense that we noted that his private \correspondence with Ibn Sand had assumed an increasing importance, and tell him that that correspondence must now cease. Mr. Rendel concurred. A straightforward control of this nature would be easier to maintain, and would prevent a repetition of such incidents as the letter in which Ibn Sand had recently tried to detach the Sheikh of Koweit from his connexion with His Majesty’s Government. Sir A. Ryan also concurred, and drew attention to the success with which Ibn Saud was spreading the idea that he might naturally absorb Koweit and was bound to do so sooner or later. He pointed out that such an idea could never have prevailed to the extent to which it had, if His Majesty’s Government had equally definitely made known their own special position with regard to Koweit. The meeting then discussed what point in the correspondence between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud could most suitably be taken up in connexion with the reprimand which it was proposed to address to both parties. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that if it were discovered that the Sheikh had committed himself to Ibn Saud in regard to the grant of an oil concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone, this might be an excellent opportunity for checking him. The question then arose, what action could be taken if the United States Government, in dealing with whom His Majesty’s Government had consistently emphasised the Sheikh’s independence, were to produce communications from him regarding the grant of a concession in the Neutral Zone ? It was, however, agreed that His Majesty’s Government could demonstrate from the Sheikh’s treaty engagements that he had not been entitled to make any such grant without our knowledge and consent. Eventually it was agreed that the most suitable occasion for the proposed representations to the Sheikh and Ibn Saud would be Ibn Saud’s letter suggesting terms for the settlement of the Saudi blockade of Koweit and warning the Sheikh against His Majesty’s Government. At the conclusion of the meeting Sir A. Ryan raised the question of the pressure which might be exerted upon Ibn Saud in regard to the Saudi blockade of Koweit. This blockade had one of two purposes, either to complete the economic strangulation of Koweit and lead to its complete absorption m Saudi Arabia or else the safeguarding of Saudi economic interests. His Majesty’s Government cou]d not possibly allow the first of these alternatives. The question, therefore, was what real force there was in Ibn Saud’s suggestion that his own purely economic interests required the maintenance of the blockade. Colonel Fowle suggested that we might well revert to the Sheikh’s proposal that Ibn Saud should have customs posts at a given place along but outside the Koweiti border, and that this might, if necessary, be coupled with a system ot manifests for Koweiti-Saudi trade. He gave it as his opinion that even if Ibn Saud were to develop Kas Tanura, possibly with American help this port was not likely to compete seriously with Koweit, which served quite a dilierent hinter land nor was there any port between the Koweit area and the Ras lanura area which could be successfully developed as a rival to Koweit. ^ n Colonel Fowle suggested that on his return to the Gulf on the 16th October he should discuss the situation with Colonel Dickson, Political Agent, K °weit, who had great experience of the sheikhdom, m the light of the conversations at the present meeting, and should submit a comprehensive report It was agreed that this course should be adopted, and that in the light of the Resident s report and of the conclusions of the present meeting the question of future policy m Koweit should be discussed if necessary in the Middle East Official Sub-Committee. The conclusions of the meeting were as follows (11 That in dealing with Ibn Saud, His Majesty’s Government should increasingly emphasise the closeness of their relations with the Sheikh. (2) That the Sheikh should be told that his personal correspondence with Ibn Saud on official matters was to cease. T 1 u (31 That the issue of the Saudi blockade of Koweit should be taken up with Ibn Saud by His Majesty’s Government on the basis of their obligation to protect the interests of Koweit.(4) That on receipt of the despatch promised by Colonel Fowle the whole question of relations between His Majesty’s Government and Koweit might suitably be referred for further discussion to the Middle East Official Sub-Committee, to which a note should be sent recording the points discussed at the present meeting, and setting forth the argu ments for and against the possible declaration of a protectorate. ( Appendix A. Note by Sir Andrew Ryan. Ibn Sand's Attitude towards Koweit. I HAVE been turning over in my mind for some time the possibility that it may be a definite object of Ibn Sand’s policy to reduce Koweit to a position of dependence on him somewhat similar to that of Asir from 1926 to 1930. This is in the nature of a pure speculation, but it is a speculation so interesting that I think it worth while to collect the principal data bearing on it. It must be admitted at the outset that, if Ibn Saud had such an idea in his head,^ he would realise the need for great caution lest he should indispose His Majesty’s Govern ment. His only formal obligation towards the latter is that contained in article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, but he understands very well the implications of the words therein “who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment.” On the other hand, he has seen His Majesty’s Government tolerate direct correspondence on business subjects between him and the Sheikh of Koweit. He might think that they would not react over strongly if he and the Sheikh confronted them with the fait accompli of a political deal. 2. Apart from the correspondence, of which we have knowledge, there has been other intercourse between the rulers, notably the Sheikh’s visit to Riadh in 1932, the secret messages brought by Ibn Sand’s confidential messenger to the Sheikh early this year, and the Sheikh’s mysterious dashes intoNejd last February, when Colonel Dickson surmised that he had gone to meet some high Saudi personage, possibly Ibn Saud himself. 3. I may interpolate, as a minor indication of Ibn Saud's attitude, a reference to two occasions on which it has been suggested or hinted by his Ministry for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Government should not concern themselves with affairs between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. I class them as minor, because this position has never been categorically asserted. The first was when, in reply to a complaint of mine regarding Saudi encroachments on Koweit territory, which had perturbed His Majesty’s Government, the reply was in effect: “Sorry you have been perturbed. You need not have been if the matter had been pursued through An. Nafisi.” On another occasion Fuad Bey, in rather light conversa tion, asked me why we concerned ourselves in matters between his Government and Koweit. 4. The personal relations between the two rulers are peculiar. Ibn Saud grew up at Koweit, and it is sometimes said that he has shown himself ungrateful to his former hosts. It is said by others, I do not know on what precise grounds, that Mubarak treated Ibn Saud very badly. Anyhow, through all the relations there runs a thread of old friendship, however flimsy and however frayed by frequent friction over raids, the embargo and so on. It has helped towards the settlement of minor questions. It has not deterred Ibn Saud from enforcing the embargo on trade, but the embargo on trade has not destroyed the Sheikh’s ostensible friendliness towards Ibn Saud. They are “Arcades ambo,” as I once wrote, and they both combine some real friendship for His Majesty’s Government and a healthy fear of them with a good deal of fundamental’ mistrust. 5. The point of my theory or speculation is that, if the Sheikh of Koweit were at all willing to be “ Asirisecl.” Ibn Saud could make the proposal quite attractive on the following lines, if I may venture to put into his mouth the sort of language he could use :— {a) “ You are not really independent, my dear fellow. You are under the thumb of the English. They might annex you at any moment, or even present you to Iraq. If you must be dependent on some one, why Abe dependent on those untrustworthy imperialists, when you might depend, without being exactly dependent, on a man like me, old friend, fellow Moslem, fellow Arab and the one big independent man in Arabia ? (b) “ I don’t like squeezing you, I really don’t, with that embargo. As things are at present, I have to think of my own interests. But if your interests were mine, we could easily have an understanding. A sort of ‘ Zollverein ’ as they say; same duties levied in our ports; free competition between yours and mine; free trade over our land border. What have the English done about it ? Nothing; because they cannot get at me. ‘ Sois mon frere et je te fais vivre. Sois le leur et je te tue.’ (c) “ I should not mop you up, of course. You would rule your State under an understanding with me. Indeed, if you were in with me, I might recognise a sort of influence of yours over those three Lost Tribes that you always want back. Look at how 1 treated the Idrisi. I made a sensible agreement with him in 1926. He remained a ruler with tribal influence. I did not take charge in his country, until he got into such a mess that he asked me to in 1930. I did not hit him on the head until the poor mutt thought he could try conclusions with me in 1932. He looked to foreigners and he got it in the neck from me. (d) “You have had trouble with Iraq over your property there. What has England been able or even willing to do for you ? If I had the right to protect you against third parties, you would find that I knew how to see you through. {e) 11 Then there’s oil. People are after it in my country, and m yours, and in the Neutral Zone. Why not have an agreed policy and present a common front to the West? You know what the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is. Another name for the British Government, as we saw in Persia the other day, even if we had not known it before. Take my tip and keep them out at all costs. Play about with Holmes, if you like. But don’t trust him, and remember that in the long run your best policy would be to deal, like me, direct with American interests, using' the others to put up the price.” 6. It is easy enough to detect fallacies in the above imaginary address. I &lt;lo not know enough about the Sheikh of Koweit to judge what his reaction to it would be, but many an Arab, not well pleased with British protectors, might find it convincing enough to be attracted into Ibn Baud’s parlour. 7 I wrote the above notes in Jedda at the end of June. I thought them too hypothetical at that time to submit them for official consideration. They may, however, be worthy of some attention now that the Political Resident and I are both in this country, and Colonel Dickson will soon be available for consultation. Except that Ibn Saud continues to show a marked anxiety to avoid all compli cations I see no material reason to modify what I wrote nearly three months ago, subject always to the consideration that I merely suggest an uncertain working theory to be tested by further examination and by keeping a close watch on future developments. August 16, 1933. Appendix B. Note. Obligations of His Majesty’s Government towards the Sheikh of Koweit. (A)— Nature of the Undertakings given. By the agreement of the 23rd January, 1899, His Majesty’s Government rmally assured the Sheikh “of the good offices of the BnUsh Gove”* wards you, your heirs and successors, so long as you, your heirs and successors8 scrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said bond,” under which the Sheikh had pledged himself, his heirs and successors, not to receive the agent or representative of any Power or Government at Koweit without the previous sanction of the British Government, and not to cede, sell, lease or mortgage, or give for occupation or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power without the previous consent of His Majesty’s Government. 2. By article '9 of the Secret Agreement of the 15th October, 1907, for the lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore, the Political Agent intimated that he was ‘ c duly authorised on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to promise, and do hereby promise, that the town of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Mobarak’s arrangements in the matter of customs, &amp;c., and all his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and of his heirs after him, and . . . In consideration of this promise the Sheikh undertook not to levy customs dues in excess of 4 per cent, on goods imported or exported by “the subjects of the aforesaid English Government,” save with the approval of that Government. 3. The undertakings given in writing to the Sheikh on the 3rd November, 1914, in return for his co-operation against the Turks, contained an assurance that “ Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” ft (B )—Construction of the Undertakings given to the Sheikh. 4. As will be seen, the engagements entered into by His Majesty’s Govern ment with the Sheikh are in rather general terms, and it is perhaps desirable briefly to record the construction placed upon them at various times by His Majesty’s Government. 5. In 1901, when there was a Turkish threat to Koweit, the Viceroy was informed (Secretary of State’s telegram No. 45 of the 4th December, 1901) that this appears to constitute a distinct violation of the Sultan’s promise ” (to respect the status quo), “ and in these circumstances His Majesty’s Government are prepared to support the Sheikh, and will not tolerate an attack by Turkish troops or ships upon Koweit. The Sheikh should not leave Koweit, and should continue to observe his engagement with us.” The assurance given is clearly limited by the words “ in these circumstances ” to this particular case. More- oyei, it is not conditional on, and is independent of the Sheikh’s observance of his agreement of 1899. 6. On the 21st March, 1902, Lord Lansdowne, then Secretary of State for Foieign Affairs, in a memorandum on the situation in Koweit, remarked that our obligations toward the Sheikh were c as ill-defined as the boundaries of his piincipality. Wh ha\e distinctly announced that he does not enjov British 1 protection ’; on the other hand, we once made him a present of £1,000. and piomised him oui good offices, whatever that may mean. When we made this promise we weie, I feel no doubt, thinking of Koweit proper, if there is such a thing, and not of Boob\an or other outskirts over which the Sheikh has rights of one sort or another ... We might, it seems to me, explain (1) to the Poite; (2) to the Sheikh; and (3) to the foreign Powers immediately interested the objects or our policy. I should be inclined to say that our engagements to Koweit do not extend beyond the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name, and to endeavour to obtain the adhesion of the Porte and of the Sheikh to our approximate definition of that district. . ” 7. Later, in 1902, it was reported that Ibn Rashid was making energetic preparation for attacking Ihn Sand, then the Sheikh of Koweit’s friend, and the o eiai was warned not to take any action likely to bring him into difficulties with e^her Nejd or Turkey. About the same time the Sheikh informed us that Ibn baud had with him a gun presented by the Turks, and asked for a gift of two or three guns, which it was understood were wanted for Jehara to protect Jnnof 1 agams ] t and attac , k - ^he Viceroy (telegram No. 39 of the 3rd October, 1902) proposed to reply that the Sheikh’s request could not be granted “but that, provided he complied with the injunction conveyed to him in pursuance of your telegram of the 4th December, 1901 (see paragraph 5 above). His Majesty’sGovernment would charge themselves with the defence of koweit district. Th Secretary of State, after consultation with the Foreign Office (Foreign 0 letter of the 13th October, 1902), replied (telegram No. 133 of the 14th October 1902) : “I approve your proposed reply about the guns, provided ^°weit district is clearly defined as the district adjoining or close to the bay tliat ^ name.” This assurance similarly admits of being read as an assurance ad hoc, and it is relevant that when, in April 1911, enquiry was made by the Secretary of State for India of the Government of India whether definition m question of Koweit territory had been communicated to the Sheikh, they replied that it might be assumed that it had, but that it “ only referred to our pledge to defend him against Ibn Kashid, who was threatening the immediate neighbourhood ot Koweit ” (telegram of the 6th April, 1911). , ^ * 11.1 8. The more specific undertakings embodied in the Bunder Shweikh lease of 1907, and quoted in paragraph 2 above, may be regarded as to some extent committing us in respect of “the town of Koweit and its boundaries. Ihe phrase “its boundaries” is, however, very vague, and could perhaps most reasonably be construed as applying to the immediate district around Koweit town. The discussions as to our obligations to the Sheikh which took place m 1911, and which are summarised in paragraphs 9 to 12 below, appear to have turned essentially on the undertakings of 1899. 9 In 1911, in connexion with the Anglo-Turkish negotiations, the question of our obligations was examined in some detail. The Government of India on being asked, with reference to Lord Lansdowne’s memorandum of 1902, to whic reference is made in paragraph 6 above, to “ define the region to which our obligation extends,” and “whether they accepted general description of boundaries in Persian Gulf Gazetteer, p.1059, &amp;c replied : We are of opinion that (1) our obligations extend to the limits of the Sheikh s terntory, (2) these limits, to the best of our knowledge, are defined with fair accuracy by Lorimer, especially as regards northern portion. • • • £ 10. The Secretary of State for India, m the light of the Government o India’s views, wrote as follows to the Foreign Office (the 8th April, 1911) . “ Viscount Morley is not aware on what grounds the opinion ex P r essed by the Marquess of Lansdowne in his memorandum of the 21st March, 1902, is based, but he observes that the language used is very tentative, and, so far as he knows, the subject was never pursued along the lines suggested by his Lordship, except in the case of the attack on the immediate neighbour hood of Koweit threatened by Ibn Rashid m the autumn of 1902. It will be seen from the Government of India’s telegram of the 6th April that this incident does not affect their opinion that our general obligations extend to the limits of Koweit territory as described m Vol. II, pp. 1059-lUbl, ot Lorimer's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, copy of which is m your possession In this Lord Morley concurs; that is to say, he thinks that, m the event of unprovoked aggression by‘the Turks or by Arab tribes under Tuikis control, upon those limits, His Majesty’s Government could not abstain from using their ‘good offices’ in the Sheikh’s favour. But the term good offices ’ is a very vague one, which His Majesty’s Government are at liberty to interpret at their discretion, and which they would doubtless interpret with more or less strictness, according to the nature and locality o± tffe aggression, and all the circumstances of the case.^ It would, however m his Lordship’s opinion, be very impolitic to attempt, m dealing with the Sheikh to whittle down the extent of our obligations, since such a course would his mind with suspicions, and could not fail to affect unfavourably oui prestige in the Persian Gulf. . . .’ 11. The Foreign Office replied, on the 9th May, 191T t^at Sir E. Grey concurred “ in the view of the Government of India, shared by Viscount 1 °f e y; that these obligations extend to the whole territory of the Sheikh, as describe in the passage of Lorimer's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf to whicn your letter refers ? 5 12. In August 1911 the Government of India, after consultation with the Political Resident (Sir P. Cox), recommended that His Majesty’s Government should communicate to the Turks a copy of the agreement of 1899, w™ a note that His Majesty’s Government had subsequently informed the Sheikh that, so&gt; long as he and his heirs and successors acted up to their obligations under the agreement, we charged ourselves to support them and to protect Koweit against [9823] 0attack by land or sea. The Secretary of State for India, on closer consideration, found himself unable to accept this proposal. India Office letter to the Foreign Office of the 30th October, 1911, remarked :— “ The telegrams of the 4th December, 1901, and the 14th October, 1902, on which the Government of India appear to base the obligation to protect Koweit by land and sea, in the Marquess of Crewe’s opinion, clearly refer only to the incidents that occasioned them, and cannot be understood to have given any general undertaking. Nor, in view of the fact that it has since been decided that our obligations extend to the whole of the Sheikh’s territory, as described in Lorimer's Gazetteer, would it be safe to pledge ourselves to any specific method of defending them. As was pointed out by Lord Morley in this Office letter of the 8th April last, the term ‘ good offices ’ (which, by Colonel Meade’s letter of the 23rd January, 1899, we undertook to accord to the Sheikh) is a conveniently vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by His Majesty’s Government in 1901-02, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will, moreover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises. His Lordship would therefore suggest that the formula should run : ‘As regards No. 1, His Majesty’s Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that, ’so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the agreement, His Majesty’s Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices,’ with, perhaps, the addition that His Majesty’s Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion.” The Foreign Office (Foreign Office letter dated the 1st November, 1911) accepted the proposed redraft and addition, and a communication in this sense was made to Tevfik Pasha in Sir Edward Grey’s letter of the 24th October, 1911. 13. The undertaking given in 1914 that Koweit “ shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection,” may be regarded as impoitmg a degree of responsibility for the protection of the principality as a whole. ' 14. On the death of Sheikh Mobarak his eldest son was informed, in March 1916, on his accession, by the Viceroy, that, “ so long as you act up to the existing arrangements with the British Government, you may expect the same support as was enjoyed by your father.” A similar assurance was given on Sheikh Jabir’s ^ at | 1 ^ l. 91 / t0 his brother and successor, Sheikh Salim, in March 1917. eikn Salim s conduct was unsatisfactory, and it was found necessary to warn hnn, through the Political Resident, on the 5th July, 1918, that the assurances (which presumably covered the assurance of the 3rd November, 1914) conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour, and that, should (ALAf rai T (° th , e , interests of His Majesty’s Government unfortunately be committed m future, he would be held personally responsible. .. f? connexion with the operations against the Ikhwan in 1928. the M°V; he ? r v“ Se ? Xtent ° f the ^gations of His Majesty’s Government for the defence of Koweit was considered in the India Office, when the view was that consideration of our engagements suggested that, on a strict InViw b llt f ‘Vd be con fl ne d to the protection of the town of Koweit, Cl f ed U P° n •° P rotect Koweit territory as a whole.

Appendix C. Supplementary Note. Question of Liability for the Protection of Koweit against Aggression from Outside, 1928-29. Akhwan raids on Koweit had taken place in 1924 and 1925, but on an inconsiderable scale. The Akhwan raids on Iraq by Feisal-al-Dawish and the Mutair tribe at the end of 1927 had, however, more important reactions on the principality. At the request of the Sheikh His Majesty s Government agree to aerial reconnaissance over his territory; and, with his concurrency it was later decided to withdraw the restrictions originally imposed by His Majesty s Government on bombing in pursuit of raiders within Koweit territory. An Akhwan raid was successfully dealt with by Koweit forces at El Riqai on the 27th January, 1928, and whilst retiring into Nejd was pursued and successfully attacked by the Royal Air Force on two following days. A further raid occurred late in February, which was not opposed by ground forces, but was again success fully pursued by the Royal Air Force for two days. In view of the possibility of further serious developments, and of the recognised liability of His Majesty s Government under existing engagements for the protection of Koweit (a phrase the exact scope of which is open to argument), further defence measures were now taken. A temporary air base (political objections to a permane station being regarded as conclusive) was established m Koweit a night of aeroplanes and a detachment of armoured cars were despatched to the town for its protection : three vessels of the Persian Gulf Squadron (later reduced to one) were stationed off Koweit itself, and a landing party disembarked and remained on shore until the crisis had passed. All action taken was taken with the concurrence of the Sheikh, who was, in addition, allowed to purchase from the Government of India a small supply of machine guns and Lewis guns^ Alter some discussion His Majesty's Government and the Government of India agreed that his Excellency might be allowed to purchase armoured motor cars, on the understanding that they would be used only for defence, and would not cross the borders of Koweit in repelling raids save with the concurrence of the Polit ca Agent. The crisis, however, passed off without incident and the special forces which had been despatched to Koweit were withdrawn during^the late spring. For financial reasons the Sheikh abandoned the idea of purchasing armoured Cai&gt;S 2. On the 15th August, 1928, the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, in order to provide against all eventualities, asked permission to send car or air recon naissances into Koweit territory and to establish a defence air base at Koweit in the event of a raid. The India Office remarked (letter of the 22nd August, 1928) : “ The Secretary of State would see strong objection on political grounds to the use of Koweit territory in connexion with air operations against the Akhwan, by which Koweit was not directly or immediately threatened. Having regard, however, to the treaty liability of His Majesty’s Government for the protection of Koweit and to the action taken with the consent of the Sheikh in the early part of this year, he would see no objection to the grant of the authority now requested when Koweit was directly or indirectly menaced, on the understanding that the prior consent of the Sheikh was obtained from the [9823] c 2Resident .... so far as may be practicable, on each specific occasion, and subject to the further restriction that there shall be no question of establishing a 'permanent base in Koweit territory.” As the result of considerable further interdepartmental discussion, the Air Officer Commanding was authorised on the 25th September, at his discretion, to carry out occasional reconnaissances over Koweit territory, both by air and car. “ His Majesty’s Government are anxious, however, that-— (1) These reconnaissances shall be carried out as infrequently and in as unprovocative a manner as possible, and (2) That the Sheikh shall be given no ground for supposing that responsi bility for the defence of Koweit has been assumed by His Majesty’s Government, or that he himself has been relieved of his obligations in this respect. These considerations should be borne in mind by the Air Officer Commanding in acting under the authority now given him.' (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad, No. 306, dated the 25th September, 1928.) 3. Approval was subsequently given in view of a threatened Akhwan raid over the border, to the concentration, subject to the approval of the Sheikh, of armoured cars in Koweit ' ‘ for protection of Iraqi tribes for so long a period as one month.” (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad. No. 76, dated the 23rd February, 1929.) 4. In April 1929 the question of the policy to be adopted by the Sheikh of Koweit in the event of Nejdi tribesmen taking refuge from King Ibn Saud in Koweit territory arose, the air authorities suggested that the Sheikh should be asked to concur in the use, if necessary, of military force, the nature and extent of which should be determined by the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, for the purpose of preventing any such refugees from entering or remaining in any part of Koweit territory. On the 8th May, 1929, the India Office, in a letter ^ Colonial Office, remarked: “Viscount Peel gathers that the attitude of the Sheikh is no longer in question and that he has already promised to endeavour to Prevent refugees making use of Koweit territory.

A third “gap ' is the habit of direct correspondence which has grown up between the sheikh and Ibn Saud, and which was dealt with at some length at the meeting. The outcome of my discussion with Colonel Dickson on this point is as follows : There would appear to be two ways in which we can ensure control over this correspondence : — (1) By informing the sheikh that before despatching any official communi cation to Ibn Saud he should show it to the Political Agent, and should take similar action with communications received from Ibn Saud. This has been the sheikh s custom in the past, at any rate in regard to his outward correspondence; whether he has shown all Ibn Sand’s official letters to Colonel Dickson, we do not, of course, know. After the sheikh had received our communication, which would! of course, be tactfully worded and would merely ask him to continue the practice which he already observed, he would not be able to quote officially any letters which he had not shown to the Political Agent. If, for instance’, in order to present His Majesty’s Government with a fait accompli on some point agreed upon between Ibn Saud and himself, he should produce a communication which had not been seen by the Political Agent, we could ignore it. Both Colonel Dickson and I think that perhaps it would be better in our communication not to refer to any particular correspondence, but to treat the matter on general grounds. The above refers, of course, to official correspondence; nothing we can do will prevent “ private and personal letters passing between the two 'potentates. secon d alternative is to insist that official correspondence between t e sheikh and Ibn Saud should pass through His Majesty’s Government’s local representatives: the Minister at Jedda, and the Political Agent, Koweit ■ /°!’-R' es id en C Persian Gulf). This is already the procedure in force (a the sheikh s own request) in regard to the sheikh’s correspondence with the Iraq Government, and so no new departure in principle would be involved. The advantage of this alternative would be its emphasis to Ibn Saud of the special relations that Koweit has with PIis Majesty’s Government, which emphasis is apparently particularly needed at the present juncture {vide conclusion 1 of the meetmg). As against this advantage, Colonel Dickson is of the opinion that the sheikh who regards Ibn Saud, m spite of the latter’s treatment of Koweit, in a proposal^ dlfferent lght t0 Ira( b mi &amp; ht ob 3 ect mor e or less strongly to the m w C f on ® 1( | eril Jg all the circumstances, I would suggest that I be authorised TV, , C ?} one 1 . 1 /r Dlcbs ? n to approach the sheikh verbally on the following IoHpp tn h i a TK H Q Ma J est y s Government have had it recentlv brought to their nnGHn^J^ SaU ,? a PP areatl y harbours designs of trying to reduce Koweit to G nn,GhG de P® ndence on him, similar—for instance—to that of Asir; that it |P bl S that P^Gice of direct correspondence between him—the sheikh— a d Ibn baud which has grown up of late, even though he—the sheikh shows it'STn Podt , ical A gont, has somewhat obscured in the eves of i ’ n h faCt ° f .

The most important of these obligations, which are dealt with in the India Office note on the subject, and the one which in a sense determines any others there may be, is that of protection against hostile incursions or invasions. His Majesty’s Government s agreements with the sheikh are three in number : that of January 1899, that of October 1907 and that of November 1914. . . , • 8 The agreement of 1899, as far as £C protection is concerned, m return for the good behaviour of the sheikh and his successors, merely promised ^the o-ood offices” of His Majesty’s Government, cc whatever that may mean as Lord Lansdowne later remarked. Our construction of this agreement appears to have been the convenient one that we could choose the circumstances m which we need, or need not, protect Koweit in any particular crisis that arose, the exact area which we were responsible for defending being left more or less vague. 9. The agreement of 1907 merely confirmed from His Majesty’s Govern ment that £ £ the town of Koweit and its boundaries ’ ’ belonged to the sheikh of that day and his successors. This agreement in no way added, m principle, to our nebulous responsibilities for the defence of Koweit, though, possibly, read with that of 1899, it might increase these responsibilities up to the £ £ boundaries ’ ’ 10 The 1914 agreement states that, in return for the sheikh’s co-operation against the Turks, ££ Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” This, unlike the phraseology of the previous agree ments, is a most categorical assurance, and the word ££ principality, and not ££ town,” being used would seem definitely to place the responsibility of protecting the whole of the Koweit sheikhdom on His Majesty’s Government. Personally, I cannot agree with the view quoted in paragraph 15 of the India Office note that ££ on a strict reading our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Koweit, and that we are not called upon to protect Koweit as a whole.” It is true, as pointed out in the note (paiagraph 16 (^)) ? that neither the present sheikh, nor his predecessors, appear to have appealed under this agreement to His Majesty’s Government, but that hardly relieves us from our obligations. This does not imply, of course, that His Majesty s Government’s obligations relieve the sheikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence. The sheikh should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers, and should only look for assistance from His Majesty s Government in the case of more serious incursions. This, m fact, was presumably the attitude taken up after the Akhwan operations of 1928, when the sheikh was encouraged to purchase half a dozen Ford vanettes, Lewis guns which were mounted in the vanettes, and ammunition, and when some of his men lecerved training from the Royal Air Force as machine gunners. 11 In conclusion, I venture to suggest that this question, the exact extent of the obligations of His Majesty’s Government for the protection of Koweit, be investigated with a view to a definite decision on the subject. The question is an important one, and the advantages of having a clear conception of what our responsibilities may be in time of crisis, before such a crisis arises, are obvious^ I am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India and His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. I have, &amp;c. T. C. FOWLE, Lieutenant-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. [E 7141/16/91] 3.— Mr. Johnstone to Mr. Laithwaite. My dear Laithwaite, Foreign Office, November 25, 1933. WITH reference to our telephone conversation yesterday, 1 write to confirm what I said to you about Ryan’s views on the proposed instructions to Hickson, which are outlined in paragraph 6 of Fowle’s official letter of the 25th October regarding Saudi-Koweit relations. „ . ' On a cursory reading of that letter, Ryan concurred generally m the proposed instructions, except for the opening clause, which states that Ibn Saud intends to reduce Koweit to the same sort of position as Asir. In Ryan’s view, it16 is undesirable to say anything to the sheikh in the sense of that clause, as it might conceivably come to the ears of Ibn Saud, whether through the sheikh or indirectly, with unfortunate effect on our relations with him. Ryan therefore suggests that this sentence should be omitted from the instructions. I send you this simply as a record of Ryan’s remarks to me; I gather that he spoke to you in the same sense. Fowle’s letter has not yet been considered by ^ my higher authorities. Yours sincerely, KENNETH JOHNSTONE. [E 775/739/91] 4 .—India Office to Foreign Office.—{Received February 1.) Sir, India Office, February 1, 1934. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that he has had under his consideration the proceedings of the interdepartmental meeting held at the Foreign Office on Thursday, the 5th October, 1933, to discuss relations between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Sheikh of Koweit, and also the Political Resident’s despatch of the 25th October, 1933, containing Colonel Fowle’s recommendations on the tentative conclusions of the meeting in question in the light of discussion of them with the Political Agent, Koweit. 2. In the light of Colonel Fowle’s views, Sir Samuel Hoare is definitely of opinion that the question of declaring a protectorate over Koweit should not at present be further pursued, and he considers that it should be possible to ensure a sufficient degree of British control over the sheikhdom by adopting a policy of tightening up our control over the sheikh as opportunity offers, by filling in the gaps which at present exist in the agreements between the sheikh and His Majesty’s Government. The gaps (with the exception of that discussed in the following paragraph and of a slavery agreement) are not, in fact, very serious. Apart from the major assurances contained in the agreement of 1899, the sheikh has already given undertakings in respect of the arms traffic; he is precluded from granting a pearling, sponge-fishing, or oil concession without the approval of His Majesty’s Government (though as regards oil the specific undertaking contained in the letter of the 27th October, 1913 (No. XLI on p. 264 of Volume XI of the 1929 edition of A it chi s on’s Treaties), is by no means so clear as could be desired); the control of aviation, whether military or civil, in his State will pass to His Majesty’s Government in the event of his accepting the proposals which the Resident has recently been instructed to make to him on this subject; while the proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council, once the sheikh’s con currence in this has been obtained, will place the question of jurisdiction over non- Moslem foreigners in his State on a securer and more satisfactory basis. 3. The delicate question of the direct correspondence which has gradually established itself between the sheikh and Ibn Saud remains for consideration. Sir Samuel Hoare has considered the alternatives discussed in paragraph 5 of Colonel Fowle’s despatch of the 25th October, and as a result he is of opinion, subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that the first alternative suggested by the Resident (which incidentally is, apparently, likely to prove the less objectionable to the sheikh) is the right solution. Subject to Sir John Simon's concurrence, he would propose, however, to approve the Resident's recommendation that Colonel Dickson should approach the sheikh verbally on the lines suggested in paragraph 6 of Bushire despatch under con sideration, with the modification suggested in Mr. Johnstone’s demi-official letter of the 25th November last to Mr. Laithwaite. Sir Samuel Hoare would also propose that it might be left to Colonel Fowle’s discretion, after the sheikh’s attitude has become known, to settle the matter in accordance with either of the alternatives discussed in paragraph 5 of his despatch. The important question whether special action should be taken to emphasise at Jedda to Ibn Saud the nature of the relations which exist between His Majesty’s Government and the sheikh might be considered when a report has been received from Colonel Fowle. 4. The question of the obligations of His Majesty’s Government for the protection of Koweit. to which the Resident refers in paragraphs 7-11 of hisdespatch, is one of considerable importance. The general position is examined in the India Office memorandum B. 427/P.Z. 6535/33, of which copies have already been communicated to the Foreign Office. The Secretary of State agrees with the Political Resident that the agreements of 1899 and 1907, containing as ^ merely a promise of good offices, the applicability of which to the whole sheikhdom as distinct from the town of Koweit is open to doubt, are not of great material importance so far as “protection'’ is concerned. The undertaking of real importance is that given to the sheikh in 1914 in return for the co-operation of his predecessor against the Turks. 5. Subject to Sir John Simon’s views, Sir Samuel Hoare, on a consideration of the position as a whole, is in agreement with Colonel Fowle's view that the phraseologv of this undertaking and the use of the word sheikhdom and not “town ” would appear to place definitely a responsibility for the protection of the whole principality of Koweit on His Majesty’s Government. He is, at the same time, in entire agreement with the Resident that such an obligation, if His Majesty’s Government now formally confirm that they recognise its existence, cannot be regarded as relieving the sheikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence, and that “the sheikh should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers and should only look for assistance from His Majesty s Government in the case of more serious incursions.’’ Such a construction would, as Colonel Fowle suggests, be consistent with the attitude adopted by His Majesty’s Government after the Akhwan operations of 1928-29, though it is relevant that no close examination of the precise obligations in the matter of His Majesty’s Government was undertaken at that time. Should Sir John Simon share the views expressed in this paragraph, Sir Samuel Hoare will cause the Resident to be instructed accordingly. 6. While the Secretary of State, as stated above, would be opposed to the declaration of a protectorate, and is satisfied, as at present advised, that the desiderata of His Majesty’s Government can be sufficiently secured by indirect tightening up of our control over the sheikh, he is at the same time impressed by the informal character of the engagements which have been entered into on behalf of Koweit. He would, therefore, be disposed to see advantage in consolidating the various undertakings which have from time to time been given on either side in a formal treaty on the lines of the Qatar Treaty of 1916, could this be secured without much difficulty. This would probably involve a reiteration and possibly a more formal specification by His Majesty’s Government of their responsibility for protection of the principality of Koweit. Moreover, as stated in the India Office note B. 427/P.Z. 6535/33 on this subject, the assurances at present given to the sheikh are, in practice, renewed to each successor in return for his acceptance of the obligations, liability for which was accepted by his predecessors, and in 1918 it appears to have been held that our obligations held good pnly so long as the ruling sheikh on his side complied with his engagements. It is arguable that a formal treaty might place a heavier burden on His Majesty’s Government with out correspondingly binding the sheikh. But it seems doubtful whether this view could, in fact, be sustained. Formal recognition by His Majesty’s Government of a Sheikh of Koweit would presumably be necessary before the engagements entered into with previous sheikhs could be regarded as binding on eithei paity. Any formal comprehensive treaty which might be drawn up could presumably be so framed as to make it clear that obligations were entirely reciprocal, and that the liability of His Majesty’s Government held good only so long as they were satisfied with the performance by the sheikh of his obligations under the tieaty. Finally, so far as protection is concerned, if the view suggested in paragraph 5 above is. accepted, that a general liability (within the limits described) for the protection of the principalitv of Koweit as a whole must already be regarded as resting on His Majesty’s Government, no material increase of their responsibilities would be involved in reiterating their acceptance of that liability in a formal treaty, while the mere fact of reiteration might make it easier to obtain the consent of the sheikh th a consolidating agreement. The Secretary of State would welcome Sir John Simon’s views on this point. . 7. Subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State would suggest that, in view of the small margin of difference which appears to exist between the provisional recommendations of the inter departmental conference of the 5th October last, the recommendations of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the proposals in this letter, it will be18 unnecessary, if those proposals commend themselves to Sir John Simon, to refer the question for discussion to the Official Middle East Sub-Committee. Copies of the relevant papers might, however, once final instructions have been sent to the Political Resident m the Persian Gulf, be circulated for information to the other Departments represented on that committee.

Sir John Simon concurs in the view expressed in paragraph 2 of that letter that the question of declaring a protectorate over Koweit should not for the present be further pursued. a tv* to the question of direct correspondence between the sheikh and King ibn Saud, Sir John Simon agrees that the sheikh should first be sounded orally m the sense suggested m paragraph 3 of your letter. He would, however, suggest that thereafter the Political Resident, should report further which of ° f aCtion di 1 scussed in paragraph 5 of his despatch of the 25th October, 1933, he recommends, before adopting either, in order that His Majesty s Minister at Jedda may be given an opportunity of furnishing his observations. As at present advised, Sir John Simon is inclined to prefer the betweprf thp n ^ 1V tn Pr0P ^ 0S TK ^ that a11 official correspondence between the sheikh and Ibn Saud should pass exclusively through the Political Resident or Political Agent and his Majesty’s representative at Jedda) as emphasising more strongly the special position of His Majesty’s Government in ftZftLTL V ^ mg ^ m °I e check upon Ibn Sand’s attempts to ( tT positlon the ™ t0 ^ detriment °f that held by His Majesty’s IdvanLTe ^h,t nrT 86 WOul f’i n S F r John Simon ’s view, have the additional dvantage that the influence of His Majesty s representative at Jedda could theTctulTX^n.W fT 6 ? as l 1 t, eXerted u P on th e Saudi Government, if he were tne actual channel of the sheikh s communications. not he JiffiehL CaS? ’ ap P ears th. at &gt; wer f. the first alternative adopted, it would ot be sufficient simply to exercise a discreet control in Koweit over direct Srsinf^ 611 Ki V bn SaU , d and the sheikh.

He has also considered the proposal in paragraph 6 of that letter for the conclusion of a new and comprehensive treaty between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the sheikh, which should include inter aha the acceptance by His Majesty’s Government of a general liability for the protection of the whole sheikhdom within the limits indicated in paragraph 10 of Golonel ^ Fowle’s despatch of the 25th October, referred to above. While agreeing that there would be advantage in such a treaty, Sir John Simon assumes that it is not proposed to undertake the negotiation of it immediately. Prima facie it ^ eel ^ s inadvisable to raise a possibly controversial issue of such importance with the sheikh until the question of his relations with King Ibn Saud and that of the projected oil concession (which appears likely to indispose the sheikh, since he may lose financially by the elimination of competition between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the United States oil interests) have been disposed of. 9. As regards the possibility mentioned in paragraph 6 of your letter, that a formal treaty might be considered to place a heavier burden on His Majesty s Government than that which they at present bear in respect of Koweit, without correspondingly binding the sheikh, X am to observe that, in accordance with t e construction which is usually placed upon treaties with heads of States, any formal treaty concluded with the Sheikh of Koweit would attach to Koweit as a State, and would apply automatically to the sheikh’s successors. The under takings given by the two contracting parties to -a treaty must certainly be construed as reciprocal. Sir John Simon notes, however, from statements made by the India Office representative at the meeting held at the Foreign Office on the 5th October to discuss this question, that it is considered that His Majesty s Government could and would remove a Sheikh of Koweit for hopeless misgovern- ment He presumes, therefore, that His Majesty’s Government could in practice prevent the accession of a ruler who seemed unlikely to observe his treaty obligations towards them, or could, at any rate, remove a mlei who after his accession in fact refused to observe those obligations. If this be so, there appears no ground for fearing that a situation might arise in which His Majesty s Government would be faced with the alternatives either of acquiescing m a refusal by the sheikh to recognise his treaty obligations or of putting an end to their treaty relations with Koweit. ^ o- o t xr ,i , •. • 10 Sir John Simon concurs m the view of Sir Samuel Hoare that it is unnecessary to refer this question to the Official Middle East Sub-Committee, but he assumes that copies of the relevant papers will be circulated later to the Departments represented thereupon. ^ ^ G.

I am, &amp;c. S. F. STEWART. Enclosure in 6. Secretary of State for India to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf. India Office, March 9, 1934. IN reply to your confidential despatch of the 25th October, on the subject of the relations between His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh of Koweit, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the correspondence [Nos. 3, 4 and 5], copies of which have already been sent to you and to the Government of India.20 2. In the light of the correspondence in question, the Secretary of State agrees that the question of declaring a protectorate over Koweit should not for the present be further pursued. 3. On the subject of direct correspondence between the sheikh and King Ibn Saud, the Secretary of State, in the light of the considerations adduced in paragraphs 3-6 of the Foreign Office letter of the 24th February, agrees with theft course of action therein suggested by Sir John Simon. I am to request that you will be good enough to instruct Lieutenant-Colonel Dickson to approach the sheikh accordingly, and that you will in due course submit a further report when the result of Colonel Dickson’s discussions with his Excellency is known and yon are in a position to make recommendations as to the line to be adopted in pursuing this matter with the sheikh. 4. On the question of the obligations of His Majesty’s Government in respect of the protection of Koweit, you will observe that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has expressed his agreement with the views contained in paragraphs 4 and 5 of India Office letter of the 1st February, 1934. The Foreign Office print, of which a copy is sent herewith [No. 1], contains a supplementary historical note prepared in this Office on the question of the view taken in 1928-29 as to the liability of His Majesty’s Government for the protection of Koweit against aggression from outside 5. The Secretary of State would be glad in due course to receive your views on the proposal referred to in paragraph 6 of India Office letter of the 1st February for the conclusion of a new and comprehensive treaty between His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh of Koweit. The matter is not one of immediate urgency, and it may well be that, as suggested by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, there may be advantage in deferring any reference to it until further progress has been made in the disposal of the vexed question of the relations of the sheikh with King Ibn Saud and the questions of oil concessions for Koweit proper and the neutral zone between Koweit and Nejd. 6. The interdepartmental meeting of the 5th October recommended, inter alia, that the issue of the Saudi blockade of Koweit should be taken up with King Ibn Saud by His Majesty’s Government on the basis of their obligation to protect the interests of Koweit. Disposal of this question has been deferred pending a decision on the matters discussed in the present letter, but steps are now being taken to deal with it as a matter of urgency. Copies of this letter are being sent for information to the Government of India and to the Political Agent at Kowmt. am, &amp;c. J. C. WALTON.copy or P.Z.7540/1933. BK Goferifit GQITPIDEITTIAL . 1T0.1365-S of 1933. British Residency &amp; Consulate-General, ^ BUSHIRE, the 25th October, 1933. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter No. P.Z.6555/33, dated the 13th October 1933, enclosing a copy of the record of an Interdepartmental meeting held at the Foreign Office on 5th instant, Note by Sir Andrew Ryan on Ibn Saudis attitude towards Kuwait, and India Office Provisional Note, dated the 11th October 1933, on the obligations of His Majesty’s Government towards the Shaikh of Kuwait. I discussed the matter with the Political Agent, Kuwait, when I passed through there recently on my way to Bushire. 2. One of the two questions (the other is dealt with below in paragraphs 7 and 8) discussed at the meeting was briefly whether, with a view to maintaining our control over Kuwait, which was undoubtedly fast increasing in importance as a political and strategical centre in the Middle East, (a) it was advisable to declare a British protectorate over that Shaikhdom, or (b) whether sufficient control could not be obtained over it by adopting a policy of tightening up our control over the Shaikh as opportunity offered by filling in thefeaps which at present existed m our agreements with him. 3 . As will be seen from the record, prima facie I favoured (b) rather than (a), and further relection and my discussion with Colonel Dickson, who agrees with me, has confirmed/ His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, The India Office, LONDON.2 . confirmed me in that opinion. The objections to (a) are that, in our - (i.e. Colonel Dickson and my), opinion a protectorate vjould most probably meet ■with considerable opposition from the Shaikh, who while valuing nis British connection values equally highly his independence in the eyes of his fellow Arab rulers, and the outside world m general. The declaration of such a protectorate would likewise alarm the other Shaikhs on the Arab Coast of the Gulf. It might also involve His Majesty's Government in a measure of interference in the internal affairs of Kuwait which can at present be avoided. The question ox slavery in Kuwait, for example, as part of the Slavery question in the Gulf generally, will doubtless be raised in the future by the recently established Permanent Slavery Committee of the League of Nations, and as we have no Slave Agreement with the Euler, such as exists with the other Arab rulers by which the local Political Agent can manumit slaves, the Kuwait aspect of this problem offers special difficulties. So long as Kuwait remains 'independent' His Majesty's Government's responsibility in the matter is presumably limited to representations and persuasions to the Shaikh. In the event, however, of a British protectorate being declared over the Sheikhdom, His Majesty's Government might possibly be committed to more drastic action. Finally it is not improbable, though this is a matter outside my sphere, that the declaration of a Kuwait protectorate might lead to somewhat awkward accusations from other governments of 'land grabbing' and the like, with which we have been familiar enough in the past with regard to other areas. 4. An examination of the alternative policy (b) shows that, unsatisfactory as our present treaty relationship with/3 . ■with the Shaikh may be 7 (as was pointed out at the meeting), we have a certain control over the Euler, (see India Office Note - Obligations of His Majesty's Government towards the Shaikh of Kuwait) , and where our Agreements show/ gaps, these can to a large extent be filled up. Thus control of aviation through Kuwait, whether military or civil, would be in theihands of His Majesty's Government under the proposed Air Agreement (vide correspondence ending with India Office letter Ho.P.Z.4434/33, dated the 11th August 1933, to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department) with the Shaikh, while the proposed amendment of the Kuv/ait Order in Council (vide correspondence ending with Government of India, Foreign and Political Department Express letter Ho.F. 364—H/33, dated the 21st ugust 19 &lt;j 3, to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India) would place jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners in Kuwait in the hands of the Political Agent. 5. A third 'gap' is the habit of direct correspondence which has grown up between the Shaikh and Ibn Saud, and which -was dealt with at some length at the meeting. The oubcome of my discussion with Colonel Dickson on this point is as follows. There would appear to be tY/o ways in which v/e can ensure control over this corresponoence. (1) By informing the Shaikh that before despatching any official communication to Ita Saud he should show it to the Political Agent, and should take similar action with communications received from Ibn Saud. This has been the Shaikh's custom in the past, at any rate in regard to his outward correspondence; whether he has shown all Ibn Saud's official letters to Colonel Hickson we do not, of course, After the Shaikh had received our communication, which/ know.4. which would, of course, he tactfully worded and would merely ask him to continue the practice which he already observed, he would not be able to quote officially any letters which he had not shown to the Political Agent. If for instance, in order to present His Majesty’s Government with a fait accompli on some point agreed upon between Ibn Saud and himself, he should produce a communication which had not been seen by the Political Agent, we could ignore it. Both Colonel Dickson and I think that perhaps it would be better in our communication not to refer to any particular correspondence but to treat the matter on general grounds. The above refers, of course, to official correspond ence: nothing we can do will prevent ’private and personal’ letters passing between the two potentates. (2) The second alternative is to insist that official correspondence between the Shaikh and Xbn Ssud should pass through His Majesty’s Government’s local representatives: the Minister at Jedda, and the Political Agent, Kuwait (or perhaps the Resident, Persian Gulf). This is already the procedure in force (at the Shaikh’s own xequest) in xegard to the Shaikh’s correspondence Y/ith the ’Iraq Government, and so no new departure in principle would be involved. The advantage of this alternative would be its emphasis to Ibn Saud of the special relations that Kuvrait has with His Majesty’s Government, which emphasis is apparently particularly needed at the present juncture. (Yicle Conclusion 1 of the Meeting). As against this advantage Colonel Dickson is of the opinion that the Shaikh, who regards Ibn Saud, in spite of the latter’s treatment of Kuwait, in a somewhat different light to ’Iraq, mighu ooject more/more or less strongly to the proposal. 6. Considering all the circumstances I v/ould suggest that I he authorised to instruct Colonel Dickson to approach the Shaikh verbally on the following lines. That His Majesty’s Government have had it recently brought to their notice that Ibn Saud apparently harbours designs of trying to reduce Kuwait to a position of dependence on him; similar - for instance - to that 01 Asir; that it is possible that the practice of direct correspondence between him - the Shaikh - and Ibn Saud which has grown up of late, even though he - the Shaikh - shows the correspondence to the Political Agent, has somewhat obscured in the eyes of Ibn Saud the fact of Kuwait’s special relations of protection, etc. with His Majesty’s Government; that it would put this correspondence on a safer and more regular footing, if it was conducted as was the correspondence with the ’Iraq Government, i.e. through His Majesty’s Government’s local representatives; that in addition an intimation to this effect to Ibn Saud would bring sharply to his notice Kuwait’s relations with His Majesty’s Government; and that finally His Majesty s Government would be glad to learn confidentially and informally what were his - the Shaikh’s - reactions to the proposal. I trust I may be authorised to take this step as soon as possible, and when the Shaikh’s attitude has become known I will make recommendations as to which alternative should be adopted. 7. The other question discussed at the meeting, (referred to at the beginning of paragraph 2 above), was the exact extent of His Majesty’s Government’s obligationsto protect the interests of Kuwait. The most important of these obligations, which are dealt with in the India Office Note on the subject, and the one which in a sense determines any others there may be, is that of protection against hostile incursions or invasions. His Majesty 1 s Government T s Agreements with the Shaikh are three in number: That of January 1899 That of October 1907 That of November 1914. 8. The Agreement of 1899, as far as ’protection 1 is concerned, in return for the good behaviour of the Shaikh and Ills successors, merely promised 'the good offices' of His Majesty's Government, 'whatever that may mean' as Lord Lansdowne later remarked. Our construction ox tins Agreement appears to have been the convenient one that we could choose the circumstances in which we need, or need not, protect Kuwait in any particular crisis thaw arose, the exact area which we were responsible for dexending being left more or less vague. 9. The Agreement of 1907 merely confirmed from His Majesty's Government that 'the town of Kuwait and its boundaries' belonged to the Shaikh of that day and his successors. This Agreement in no way added, m principle, to our nebulous responsibilities for the defence of Kuwait, though possibly read with that of 1899 it might increase these responsibilities up to the ’boundaries 1 . 10. The 1914 Agreement states that in return for the Shaikh's oo-operation against the Turks 'Kuwait shall be recognised as an independent principality undc.r Britis protection'. This, unlike the phraseology of the previous/7 previous agreements, is a most categorical assurance, and the word principality’ and not ’town’ being used, would seeip definitely to place the responsibility of protecting the whole of the Kuwait Shaikhdom on His Majesty’s Government. Personally 1 cannot agree with the view quoted in paragraph 15 of the India Office Note that 'on a strict reading our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Kuwait and that we are not called upon to protect Kuwait as a whole'. It is true, as pointed out in the Note (paragraph 16 (d), that neither the present Shaikh, noi his predecessors, appear to have appealed under this Agreement to His Majesty’s Government, but that hardly relieves us from our obligations. This does not imply, of course, that His Majesty’s Government’s obligations relieve the Shaikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence. The Shaikh should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers, and should only look tor assistance from His Majesty’s Government in the case of more serious incursions. This in fact was presumably the attitude taken up after the Akhwan operations of 1928 when the Shaikh was encouraged to purchase half-a-dozen Ford vanettes, Lewis guns which were mounted in the vanettes, and ammunition, and when some of his men received training from the Loyal Air Force as machine gunners. 11. In conclusion I venture to suggest that this question, the exact extent of thecbligations of His Majesty’s Government for the protection of Kuwait, he investigated with a view to a definite decision on the subject. The question is an important one, and the advantages of having a clear conception of what our responsibilities may be in time of crisis, before such/such a crisis arises, are obvious. 1 am sending copies of this despatch to the Government of India and His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda.

Johnstone, Foreign Office. in the Persian Gulf - Mr. J. G. Laithwaite, India Office. Th P meeting had before it Sir Andrew Ryan’s note of the 16th August, regarding the attitude of King Ibn Saud towards Koweit (see Appendix A).

In view of J‘ ece ^ t . , , t0 be modified, and he considered that relationship with that conn ry g T rea t v an d tlie P os i tion tl[ie R °y al A 1 ir pie in Haq must be fegtried ^s doub/ful. On the general point at issue, he [935 1—1]observed that one of the main points to be borne in mind was the fact that Koweit was not naturally independent from either the geographical or the economic point of view. It was a port without a hinterland, cut off at present by the Iraqi and Saudi frontiers from the territory which it would naturally feed,' and at present denied free communication with the country behind it. Moreover, even its present trade might be jeopardised by the development of the Saudi port at Ras Tanura under the auspices of the American oil concessionaires on the Hasa coast. What was even more important was that its fresh-water supply was not derived from its own territory, but had to be imported from Iraq. It was for consideration therefore, whether it would, in fact, be practicable for His Majesty’s Government to maintain the independence of Koweit as against its neighbours, at anv rate on the present basis of a rather loose and ill-defined dependence on His Majesty’s Government. J ^ Colonel Fowle concurred generally in Mr. Rendel’s description of the economic position of the sheikhdom. He pointed out, however, that Koweit had always been the port of the deserts of northern Arabia, as Bahrein was the port of Central Arabia. In regard to the position of Koweit vis-a-vis of Iraq, he added that beside the influence which Iraq could exert by controlling Koweit’s fresh water supply, it was also powerful enough to bring pressure to bear upon Koweit over, for instance, the question of smuggling. Mr. Rendel agreed that both Iraq and Saudi Arabia were in a position to exert strong pressure on Koweit. This being so, the rivalry between them over Koweit was likely to increase, unless, of course, Saudi Arabia disintegrated. The present position of Koweit between these two States was weak, and Sir Andrew Ryan’s note showed how powerful an attraction Ibn Saud could’exert. The question, therefore, was whether His Majesty’s Government would not be well advised to develop and tighten up their own relations with Koweit in order to strengthen its position. It had, in fact, been suggested that it might be more advantageous to convert our present treaty relationship into a definite protectorate, °K I 01 ins t^nce, the analogy of the Hadramaut, which was now regarded as part of the Aden Protectorate, but where our treaty relationship with the local rulers ami obligations to afford them protection had been if anything looser than those we had towards Koweit. Would not a protectorate ensure Koweit more effectively against absorption than the present attempt to maintain the sheikhdom as a kind of political vacuum m the Persian Gulf. Mr. Laithwaite drew attention to three points :— {a) At present the obligations of His Majesty’s Government to Kowmt were represented by their undertaking to grant “good offices ” in respect of Koweit under the 1899 agreement, by their promise of 1907 that “the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, ^weit, and to his heirs after him,” and their undertaking ° fi ^ 0vem ^ er ’ 1914, that Koweit, in the event of a victory over e lurks, would be recognised by us as an independent princi- pa i y undei British protection. They were thus very general in e n m v w accordance our norm al policy on the Arab littoral, which dated from a period in which it was possible to protect a sea por y ae ion from the sea, but not to afford effective help inland, we &lt; a consistently endeavoured to limit our obligations, save as regards &amp; 00 0 ces to Koweit town and the immediately adjoining area, ecen experience had, however, shown that in cases of intervention from outside it was m fact necessary to give the Sheikh, at our « a d own termSj a measure of act j ve ass i s tance up , f lmi p . 0 , lls fyctfitiers and with the development of aircraft the ? m ° 111 ai ) d defence was now less difficult. This was to some f a 81 ren ^ enm g of his strict treaty position, as also possibly wS extension of our strict treaty obligations 1 re g ai d to the suggested establishment of a protectorate, it was ecessaiy o consider what the reactions of the Sheikh would be, and also what effect the proclamation of a protectorate might have on the Arab rulers of the Gulf. It would in any case be wiser not anrl iww overt proclamation of this nature, since both in Bahrein Qa ai and along the Irucial Coast it would probably rouse■ — ■ ■ — 3 apprehensions and might even cause the local sheikhs to turn awa\ from His Majesty’s Government and consider submitting themselves to Persia or to Ibn Saud. , . (c) The basis of His Majesty’s Government’s present treaty relationship with Koweit was unsatisfactory. In the first place, it did not rest, as was the case with Bahrein, Muscat and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, on a long series of formal treaties with the Sheikh dating back tor over a century, or, as in the case of Qatar, on a comprehensive treaty, but was based only on a comparatively brief correspondence exchanged between the sheikhs and His Majesty’s Government since 1899 and on the reciprocal engagements, still presumably binding since they had not been abrogated, entered into in connexion with the lease of Bunder Shweikh in 1907; secondly, there were certain gaps, e.g., we had no slavery agreement with Koweit. It might, he suggested, be possible to fill in the gaps left by this correspondence and tighten our control in that way. An example was our recent request to the Sheikh tor certain undertakings in regard to air facilities in his sheikhdom, one result of which would be to concentrate effective control of such facilities, whether military or civil, in the hands of His Majesty s Government. Another instance was the recent proposed amendment of the Koweit Order in Council so as to place responsibility for jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners in the hands of His Majesty s Government. A gradual tightening of our control of this character, particularly if pursued as a definite policy on all convenient occasions, would, he thought, at once avoid the difficulties invoked in establishing a formal protectorate and would make it very much simpler. Colonel Fowle expressed the view that there did not seem to be any i nt er- mediate position possible between a treaty relationship with the bheikh on t e present Hues and a full protectorate. The Sheikh would certainly be unwilling to agree to the sheikhdom becoming a formal protectorate, and pnma he fColonel Fowle) was not much in favour of it. He agreed, however that it would be advisable, on suitable opportunities, to try to tighten up our control over On being questioned whether he did not consider that our restricted position vis-a-vis of the Sheikh in regard to the Kowit oil concession essential weakness of our treaty position, he replied that our case had been due rather to the special undertakings given to United States Government in that matter than to any weakness m our normal control ovei the Sheikh under the treaty engagements. Had we been able without violating our pledges to the United States Government, to tell the Sheikh that we required him to give the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company he would have done so. Mr. Rendel drew attention to the fact that in the event of serious misgovern- ment by the Ruler of Koweit such as prejudicially to affect foreign citizens in Koweit, we might find ourselves in a difficult position vis-avis of the oie g Power concerned. Mr:Laithwaite said that on this point he thought that “yf.G® regarded as locus classicus. We had for many years put up with a consideraWe decree of misgovernment by Sheikh Isa. But when conditions at last, in our view, became Intolerable, we did not hesitate to “fyene and* 0 depose the Sheikh. There were obvious arguments for doing so for were we not to ^ rve “ when misgovernment had reached a certain pitch, it would be most difficult tor us to justify a refusal to allow foreip. Governments which ^ take steps to protect the interests of thel ^ n ^ 10n k S •ln l^™ d ^nld fail to bring need be any apprehension in the case of Kowei ^ , necessarv to pressure on a sheikh who was abusing his posi lon ’ 0 , , , now t | lat do so. The case for early intervention would probably be stronger now that the Gulf was so much more in the public eye. The meeting then went on to consider relations between Ibn Saud and Koweit. [935 1—1] BJMI •r Sir Andrew Ryan stated that he had been impressed by the apparent weakness of His Majesty’s Government’s position vis-d-vis of Ibn Sand with regard to Koweit. His Majesty’s Government were not strongly placed when it became necessary to warn Ibn Sand to keep his hands off Koweit, since they were committed to maintaining that Koweit was technically an independent State A case in point had been the Saudi intrusions into Koweit territory, referred to- ' in paragraph 3 of his note, when Saudi officials had performed acts of authority within the limits of the sheikhdom. ^ Colonel Fowle pointed out that, in fact, our treaty engagements did entitle us to prevent foreign Powers from dealing direct with the Sheikh. Ibn Saud had certainly been informed of the special relations existing between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government. Speaking generally, he added that, in fact little trouble was likely to be experienced with foreigners in Koweit, so long as it remained a Bedouin town ruled by a Bedouin sheikh, and not, like Bahrein a relatively cosmopolitan commercial centre. If, however, oil were discovered within the sheikhdom, it was possible that difficulties might arise. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the Arabian air route was likely to develop quickly. If Iraq were to adopt an anti-foreign policy, and' Koweit became correspondingly more important as a centre of international traffic other countries might well wish to take advantage of the facilities there. We might well iind many foreign Powers becoming increasingly interested in Koweit We could not have it both ways, and should sooner or later have to define our position His Majesty s Government ought, therefore, to orient their policy definitelv either towards the greater independence of the sheikhdom or towards a tightening of their own control. 8 g Mr Laithwaite agreed, and added that, in his view, our policy should be defw.fTTfh? clos ® r 1 contr ° 1 &gt; but that it was undesirable to hasten any overt declaration ot full control, such as the establishment of a protectorate would be Such a declaration might well frighten the Sheikhs of Bahrein and of the Truciai one of Zci sio^T 6 ^ rm ? 0od - The P olic y to be Allowed was, therefore, Z °L occas t lonal m “ or adjustments, as these became necessary, tending to increase, or at any rate not to relax, our control over the sheikhdom. g drew^ttenHoG^tv, he t q i uest , i0n ° f Sa , ud /: Koweiti relations, Sir Andrew Ryan corresDondefee 1 m Ration extended by His Majesty’s Government to direct no lesfthan the ?Len S1 erS , bet r een , the .

Mr. Rendel concurred. A straightforward control of this nature wouM be easier to maintain, and would prevent a repetition of such ^n which Ibn Sand had recently tried to detach the Sheikh of Koweit from ■ ^jonnexion with His Majesty’s Government. Sir A. Ryan also concurred, and drew attention to the success with which Ibn Saud was spreading the idea that he might naturally absorb Koweit and was linnnrl to do so sooner or later. He pointed out that such an idea could neve “prevailed to Ze extent to which it had, if His Majesty’s Government had equally definitely made known their own special position with regard to Koweit. The meeting then discussed what point in the correspondence between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud could most suitably be taken up m connexion with the reprimand which it was proposed to address to both parties. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that if it were discovered that * e committed himself to Ibn Saud in regard to the grant an oil TOnce^ion the Koweit Neutral Zone, this might be an excellent ° d h | t t J him The question then arose, what action could be taken if the United b Government in dealing with whom His Majesty’s Government had consistently emphasised the.Sheikh’s independence, were to produ^ co^unications from him regarding the grant of a concession m the Neutral Zone? It was, ^wever agreed^that His Majesty’s Government could demonstrate from the Sheikh s treaty engagements that he had not been entitled to make any such grant without our knowledge and consent. Eventually it was agreed that the most suitable occasion for the proposed representations to the Sheikh and Ibn baud would be TVm Sand’s letter suggesting terms for the settlement of the Saudi blockade o Koweftld warningle Shlkh against His Majesty’s Government. At the conclusion of the meeting Sir A. Ryan raised the question of the nressure which might be exerted upon Ibn Saud in regard to the Saudi blockade of Koweit This blockade had one of two purposes either to complete the economic 1 strangulation of Koweit and lead to its complete absorption m Saudi A i • rl oicJtVip c&lt;afpp‘iiarding of Saudi economic interests.

'Note by Sir Andrew Ryan. Ibn Sand's Attitude towards Koweit. I HAVE been turning over in my mind for some time the possibility that it may be a definite object of Ibn Saud’s policy to reduce Koweit to a position of dependence on him somewhat similar to that of Asir from 1926 to 1930. This is in the nature of a pure speculation, but it is a speculation so interesting that I think it worth while to collect the principal data bearing on it. It must be admitted at the outset that, if Ibn Saud had such an idea in his head, he would realise the need for great caution lest he should indispose His Majesty’s Govern- ment. His only formal obligation towards the latter is that contained in article 6 o± the Treaty of Jedda, but he understands very well the implications of the words therein “who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment.’ On the other hand, he has seen His Majesty’s Government tolerate direct correspondence on business subjects between him and the Sheikh of Koweit He might think that they would not react over strongly if he and the Sheikh coni rented them with the fait accompli of a political deal. 2. Apart from the correspondence, of which we have knowledge, there has i ooo ° r mtercourse between the rulers, notably the Sheikh’s visit to Riadh in ( u 16 ? ecr 1 e . t messa ges brought by Ibn Saud’s confidential messenger to the oneikh early this year, and the Sheikh's mysterious dashes intoNejd last February, when Colonel Dickson surmised that he had gone to meet some high Saudi personage, possibly Ibn Saud himself. ^ 3. I may interpolate, as a minor indication of Ibn Saud’s attitude, a reierence to two occasions on which it has been suggested or hinted by his Ministry 0 'i' y^ ails ^bat His Majesty s Government should not concern themselves wi n a airs between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. I class them as minor, because us posi ion has never been categorically asserted. The first was when, in reply to a complaint of mine regarding Saudi encroachments on Koweit territory, which had perturbed His Majesty s Government, the reply was in effect: “Sorry you u 61 ! b e ^ T U pb e b- Vou need not have been if the matter had been pursued ougn An.

I o not know enough about the Sheikh of Koweit to judge what his reaction to - would be, but many an Arab, not well pleased with British protectors, mig nd it convincing enough to be attracted into Ibn Sand s parlour. 7 I wrote the above notes in Jedda at the end of June. I thought them too ypothetical at that time to submit them for official consideration. They may LOW ever be worthy of some attention now that the Political Resident and I are , 0 th in this country, and Colonel Dickson will soon be available for consultation, ixcept that Ibn Saud continues to show a marked anxiety to avoid all compil ations I see no material reason to modify what I wrote nearly three months ago, ubiect always to the consideration that I merely suggest an uncertain working heory to be tested by further examination and by keeping a close watch on ‘uture developments. August 16, 1933. Appendix B. Note. Obligations of His Majesty’s Government towards the Sheikh of Koweit. (A )—Nature of the Undertakings given. Bv the agreement of the 23rd January, 1899, His Majesty’s Government assured the Sheikh “of the good offices of the British Government wards 7 you your heirs and successors, so long as you, your heirs and successorsscrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said bond, ’ ’ under which the Sheikh had pledged himself , his heirs and successors, not to receive the agent or representative of any Power or Government at Koweit without the previous sanction of the British Government, and not to cede, sell, lease or mortgage, or give for occupation or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power without the previous consent of His. Majesty’s Government. P 2. By article 9 of the Secret Agreement of the 15th October, 1907, for the lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore, the Political Agent intimated that he was “ duly authorised on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to promise, and do hereby promise, that the town of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Mobarak’s arrangements in the matter of customs, &amp;c., and all his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and of his heirs after him, and . . . In consideration of this promise the Sheikh undertook not to levy customs dues in excess of 4 per cent, on goods imported or exported by “the subjects of the aforesaid English Government,” save with the approval of that Government. 3. The undertakings given in writing to the Sheikh on the 3rd November, 1914, in return for his co-operation against the Turks, contained an assurance that £ k Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” (B)— Construction of the Undertakings given to the Sheikh. 4. As will be seen, the engagements entered into by His Majesty’s Govern- ment with the Sheikh are in rather general terms, and it is perhaps desirable briefly to record the construction placed upon them at various times by His Majesty s Government. • ^ ^ w ^ en there was a Turkish threat to Koweit, the Viceroy was informed (Secretary of State’s telegram No. 45 of the 4th December, 1901) that tns appears to constitute a distinct violation of the Sultan’s promise” (to lespect the status quo), and in these circumstances His Majesty’s Government aie prepared to support the Sheikh, and will not tolerate an attack by Turkish troops or ships upon Koweit. The Sheikh should not leave Koweit, and should continue to observe his engagement with us.” The assurance given is clearly limited by the words £ in these circumstances ” to this particular case. More over, i is not c ^ ) ^^ ona l or b an d is independent of the Sheikh’s observance of his agreement of 1899. t? •*' 9? P Mandi, 1902, Lord Lansdowne, then Secretary of State for I oreign Aflairs, m a memorandum on the situation in Koweit, remarked that our obligations toward the Sheikh were “ as ill-defined as the boundaries of his principality. We have distinctly announced that he does not enioy British protection ; on the other hand, we once made him a present of £1,000, and •''■’'yy mm ou ’ T § 0&lt; y 0 ®j es V whatever that may mean. When we made this tViino- 6 T W f le i .-.

The more specific undertakings embodied m the Bunder Shwmkh e of 1907, and quoted in paragraph 2 above, may be regarded as to so committing u S q m respect of “the town of Koweit “d its boundarie^ The phrase “ its boundaries ” is, however, very vague, and could perhaps most reasonably be construed as applying to the \ m ™® d iate district around K town The discussions as to our obligations to the Sheikh which took P^oe 1911, and which are summarised in paragraphs 9 to 12 below, appear to have turned essentially on the undertakings of 1899. , • 9 In 1911, in connexion with the Anglo-Turkish negotiations, the questio of our obligations was examined in some detail. The Government of India o being: asked with reference to Lord Lansdowne s memorandum of 1902, to which reference is made in paragraph 6 above, to ‘ £ define the region to whic our obligation extends,” and “whether they accepted genera! description of boundaries in Persian Gulf Gazetteer, p. 1059, &amp;c.,iep , r j t ■ India’s views, wrote as follows to the Foreign Office (the 8th April, 1911) . “ Viscount Morley is not aware on what grounds the opinion expressed bv the Marquess of Lansdowne in his memorandum of the 21st March, 1902, i s y based but he observes that the language used is very tentative, and, so far as he knows, the subject was never pursued along the lines suggested by Ms Lordship, except in the case of the attack on the immediate neighbour^ hood of Koweit threatened by Ibn Rashid m the autumn of 1902 It wM be seen from the Government of India’s telegram of the 6th April that this incident does not affect their opinion that our geperal obhgations extend to the limits of Koweit territory as described in Vol. II, pp. 1059-1061, ot Larimer’s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, copy ^ which is ^ your Possesmon In this Lord Morley concurs; that is to say, he thinks that, m the event of unprovoked aggression by the Turks or by Arab tribes under Turkis control upon thosl limits, His Majesty’s Government could ^t abstain froi^ n si no- their ‘good offices’ m the Sheikhs favour. But the term ^ good offices ’ is a ve?y vague one, which His Majesty’s Government are at liberty to interpret at Lei? discretion, and which they would doubtless interpret with more or less strictness, according to the nature and locality of t aeeression and all the circumstances of the case, it would, however, in Lordship’s opinion, be very impolitic to attempt in dealing with the Sheikh, to whittle down the exteJ of our obligations, since such A course wogd fill his mind with suspicions, and could not fail to affect unfavourably oui prestige in the Persian Gulf. ...” 11 The Foreign Office replied, on the 9th May, 191that Sii E. Grey concurred “ in the view of the Government of India, ^““^ibed that these obligations extend to the whole territory of the Sheikh as described in the passage of Larimer’s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf to which your letter refers.Government of India, after consultation with the Political Iteshient S (Sir P. Cox), recommended that His Majesty’s GovernmeM should communicate to the Turks a copy of t e agree sheikh that so that His Majesty’s Government had subsequentiy informed the She G lone- as he and his heirs and successors acted up to their obligations unctei me agreement, we charged ourselves to support them and to protect Koweit against [935 1—1] C10 attack by land or sea. The Secretary of State for India, on closer consideration found himself unable to accept this proposal. India Office letter to the Foreign Office of the 30th October, 1911, remarked :— “ The telegrams of the 4th December, 1901, and the 14th October, 1902 on which the Government of India appear to base the obligation to protect Koweit by land and sea, in the Marquess of Crewe’s opinion, clearly refer only to the incidents that occasioned them, and cannot be understood to have given any general undertaking. Nor, in view of the fact that it has since been decided that our obligations extend to the whole of the Sheikh’s territory, as described in Lorimer's Gazetteer, would it be safe to pledge ourselves to any specific method of defending them. As was pointed out by Lord Morley in this Office letter of the 8th April last, the term ‘ good offices ’ (which, by Colonel Meade’s letter of the 23rd January, 1899, we undertook to accord to the Sheikh) is a conveniently vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by His Majesty’s Government in 1901-02, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will, moreover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises. “ His Lordship would therefore suggest that the formula should run • ‘ As regards No. 1, His Majesty’s Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that, so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the agreement, His Majesty’s Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices,’ with, perhaps, the addition that His Majesty’s Government reserve to themselves the rKht to interpret that term at their discretion.” The Foreign Office (Foreign Office letter dated the 1st November 1911) accepted the proposed redraft and addition, and a communication in this sense was made to levfik Pasha m Sir Edward Grey’s letter of the 24th October, 1911. 13. Ihe undertaking given in 1914 that Koweit “shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection,” may be regarded as a whole 11 ^ ^ de g ree 0;1: responsibility for the protection of the principality as iqic 14 ’ \9 n tilG deat \ of Sheikh Mobarak his eldest son was informed, in March 916, on his accession, by the Viceroy, that, “ so long as you act up to the existing ^ ?n rit1 ^ ^ 0U ma ^ ex P ect ^ support as drath in 7 i d Qi b 7 A S1 ™ llar assurance was given on Sheikh Jabir’s Sheikh ?LwI t0 brother and successor, Sheikh Salim, in March 1917. him thrmiu-h tVp rf was a^salasfactory, and it was found necessary to warn (which nrpfnmahl 01 lca Resident, on the 5th July, 1918, that the assurances trhim COVered the assurance of the 3rd November, 1914) conveyed acts “ contra rv ?n S fh 0nW f re c f 0nd i tl A nal good behaviour, and that, should committed*^ ft,tn^” h” t6 (A ^is Majesty’s Government unfortunately be committed in future, he would be held personally responsible. 15.

No definition has been given or attempted of the meaning ot “ British protection” in this connexion; and, while pmma facie the bneikn would apparently be justified in claiming that it represented an assurance ot effective protection in respect of the whole of his principality, there is some room for discussion as to its precise implications, and it is noteworthy that no appeal appears to have been made under it either by the present Sheikh or by his predecessors. j Q LAITHWAITE India Office, October 11, 1933. Appendix C. Supplementary Note. Question of Liability for the Protection of Koweit against Aggression from Outside, 1928-29. Akhwan raids on Koweit had taken place in 1924 and 1925, but on an inconsiderable scale. The Akhwan raids on Iraq by I eisal-al-Dawish and the Mutair tribe at the end of 1927 had, however, more important reactions on the principality. At the request of the Sheikh His Majesty’s Government agreed to aerial reconnaissance over his territory ; and, with his concurrence it was later decided to withdraw the restrictions originally imposed by His M ,] y Government on bombing in pursuit of raiders within Koweit territory. An Akhwan raid was successfully dealt with by Koweit forces at El Riqai on the 27th January, 1928, and whilst retiring into Nejd was pursued and successfully attacked by the Royal Air Force on two following days. A further raid occurred late in February, which was not opposed by ground forces, but was again success^ fully pursued by the Royal Air Force for two days. In view of the possibility of further serious developments, and of the recognised liability of His Majesty Government under existing engagements for the protection f ^oweit (a phrase the exact scope of which is open to argument), further defence measu e were now taken. A temporary air base (political objections to a permane ^ station being regarded as conclusive) was established m Koweit: a flight ol aeronlanes and a detachment of armoured cars were despatched to the town for its protection : three vessels of the Persian Gulf Squadron (later reduced to one) were stationed off Koweit itself, and a landing party disembarked and remained on shore until the crisis had passed. All action ta y° f the concurrence of the Sheikh, who was m addition, allowed to purchase from the Government of India a small supply of machine gnus and Lewis guns. After some discussion His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India agreed that his Excellency might be allowed to purchase armoured motor cars, on the tderstaMTng that they would be used only for defence, and would not cross the borders of Koweit in repelling raids save with the concurrence of the Political Agent. The crisis, however, passed off without incident and the special forces which had been despatched to Koweit were withdrawn during the late spring. For financial reasons the Sheikh abandoned the idea of purchasing armoured CarS o ()„ the 15th August, 1928, the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, in order to provide against all eventualities, asked permission to send car or air recon naissances into Koweit territory and to establish a defence air b a ^ at Koweit in the event of a raid. The India Office remarked (letter of the 22nd August, 1928') : “ The Secretary of State would see strong objection on political grounds to the use of Koweit territory in connexion with air operations against the 4khwan by which Koweit was not directly or immediately threatened. Having regard however to the treaty liability of His Majesty s Government for the nrotection of Koweit and to the action taken with the consent of the bheikh in the early part of this year, he would see no objection to the grant of the authority now requested when Koweit was directly or indirectly menaced, on the understanding that the prior consent of the Sheikh was obtained from theResident .... so far as may be practicable, on each specific occasion, and subject to the further restriction that there shall be no question of establishing a 'permanent base in Koweit territory.” As the result of considerable further interdepartmental discussion, the Air Officer Commanding was authorised on the 25th September, at his discretion, to carry out occasional reconnaissances over Koweit territory, both by air and car. “ His Majesty’s Government are anxious however, that— (1) These reconnaissances shall be carried out as infrequently and in as unprovocative a manner as possible, and (2) That the Sheikh shall be given no ground for supposing that responsi bility for the defence of Koweit has been assumed by His Majesty’s Government, or that he himself has been relieved of his obligations in this respect. These considerations should be borne in mind by the Air Officer Commanding in acting under the authority now given him. (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad, No. 306, dated the 25th September, 1928.) 3 Approval was subsequently given in view of a threatened Akhwan raid over the border, to the concentration, subject to the approval of the Sheikh of armoured cars in Koweit “ for protection of Iraqi tribes for so long a period as one month.” (Colonial Office telegram to Bagdad. No. 76, dated the 23rd February, 1929.) 4 ; In April 1929 the question of the policy to be adopted by the Sheikh of Koweit m the event of Nejdi tribesmen taking refuge from King Ibn Saud in Koweit territory arose, the air authorities suggested that the Sheikh should be asked to concur m the use, if necessary, of military force, the nature and extent ot which should be determined by the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, for the purpose of preventing any such refugees from entering or remaining in any prt of Koweit territory. On the 8th May, 1929, the India Office, in a letter l? q?

BLOCKAM . (a) Nothing of importance to report under this head. (b) Apparently as a result of the caravan incident near Hafar al Batin of 14th July, where A1 Sharaafi al Dausiri, Bin Saud*s official was killed by blockade runners, (see para.II of my Summary for July last, No.182 dated 10th August), news reached the King early in September that 16 small convoys had got through to Anaiza, from Kuwait. He accordingly sent an armed party from Riath to demand of Ibn Sulain, the headman of Anaiza, the actual 16 caravans. The story was of course denied whereupon the King ordered the arrest of 16 leading citizens, who were later made to pay a fine of Rials 200 each. The story has not been confirmed, so it must be taken for what it is worth.Mr Waltpn Please see the Foreign Office letter helow and Sir Andrew Hyan's note enclosed on Ibn Saud's attitude towards Koweit. The note is very interesting and I have sent a copy to Colonel Fowle, as suggested by the Foreign Office. It would, of course, be quite impossible for us to acquiesce in any absorption of Koweit by Bin 3aud and on the whole I am inclined not to take too seriously the risk of the Sheikh being 'Asirized'* as Ryan puts it. But the note is important as emphasising the desirability from our point of view of doing all we can to keep the Sheikh contented with us and prevent him from reaching the conclusion that it is only by making terms with either Bin Saud or Iraq that he can hope to safeguard his position.___—— ■■ INDIA OFFICE r*. 0.5300/33. 31st August 1933.

I have the honour to refer to despatch No. 0.T.20, dated the 23rd May 1933, from His Majesty’s Minister, Jedda, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the Department of Overseas Trade, (copy to the Government of India under Jedda Printed Letter No. 45, dated the 23rd May 1933), reporting the imposition in Saudi Arabia of a new customs tariff which is believed to be more onerous than that previously in force. This increase in the tariff will naturally furnish a greater incentive for smuggling into Saudi Arabia and it seems to me likely that this consideration may have prompted Ibn Saud to make his recent- suggestion to the Shaikh of Kuwait (vide my Printed Letter No .44 (N o. 757- S to the Government of India and Jedda) of 27th June 1933) that the customs tariff of Kuwait should be raised to the level of that of Saudi Arabia.

As the latter are said to be 8C$-10C$ ad valorem, acceptance of the offer would inevitably stop all imports at Kuwait, where trade is already at a very low level; and the small state, as a result, would be ruined. It would seem that Bin Saud, who would have everything to gain, and who is represented in London, is endeavouring to use the Foreign Office as his tool to bring pressure on his small but not unimportant neighbour and an ally of Great Britain to accept his terms. 14.

Extract from Kuwait Intelligenae Summary for Jnlv.l24-1 . U. Blockade. The Saudi Government early in July started enforcing their latest Customs Tariff as approved by the King in the Persian Gulf region. This works out from 80^ ad valorem to 200/S according to the nature of goods. The unwisdom of this move with unrest in Najd and everywhere on the increase, ought to have been patent to a child, but the King apparently is determined to take the advice of his amateur financial and customs advisers, such as Abdullah bin Sulaiman and Mohomed al Tawil, etc. The worst feature of these new customs duties is that it taxes out of all reason the peoples food and necessities of life. For instance duty on sugar is now 119^, on rice 40/£, and on matches which is as important as actual food to the Najdi and Bedouin, 200$. The rosuli of these ferocious duties has been to greatly increase the already deep hatred and resentment which certainly all over Najd and Hassa and North East Arabia is felt for Bin Saud, and which will certainly be taken advantage of by his Northern neighbours. The Bedouin everywhere and openly pray for the day when the King will either die, or will smash himself against Yemen or Asir. Bin Saud does not appear to realise that his people who grow nothing and produce nothing (I refer in particular to the Bedouin tribes) are starving: They will not be able to stand the strain much longer. They must either revolt on a large scale or start fighting each other to get food. Bin Saud s subsidies which hitherto have kept the tribes quiet, have either been stopped or been greatly reduced. Ihe secondary result, of the new duties has been to give- 2 - great impetus to the contraband trade into Najd from Kuwait, The same I understand applies in the case of Bahrain also. In spite of the activities of Ibn Jaloui f s frontier patrols, ever increasing numbers of Najd tribesmen, are secretly finding their way into Kuwait, with the deliberate intention of trying to run rice, sugar, tea and other foodstuffs into the interior. They are desperate men, driven on by the haunting knowledge that their families are on the vergeof starvation. These blockade breakers tell me (I often have talks with them), that if they lose four contraband cargoes, either through capture, or destruction by their own hand, and get away with a fifth caravan, it will still pay them. Such are the high prices that rule in Bin Baud’s dominions. The following incident which occurred on the 14th July is an example of the desperation to which the Bedouins are being driven, and I fear we have not heard the end of the incident, for Bin Baud’s arm is still long, and he seems to delight in revenging himself on his poor subjects these days. Two small caravans numbering 22 and 21 camels respectively, consisting of Braih tribesmen (Mutair) whose main camp is at Hafar al Batin, left Kuwait on the 11th July. By prearrangement they travelled separately their plan being to meet somewhere in the Dahana and then make for Qasim, after getting through the Blockade ring. The first party reached Shaib al Fao 20 miles south west of Hafar when were pursued and challenged by one of Hamud al Bagaawi’s patrols. It being dark a fight ensued, and the caravan guards drove off the patrol by rifle fire. There were no casualties, but the contra bandists knowing the patrol would return with reinforcements- 3 - and feeling that with their laden camels they could not escape, deliberately unloaded their merchandise, piled it up in a heap and set it on fire. Ihey themselves scattered and have not been found yet. The g. 3 £Qnd party unfortunately and quite accidently ran into the reinforced patrol, a piece of real bad luck, as they were some 25 miles away from the scene of the first incident. Again a fight took place. This time A1 Sharaafi al Dausiri, the Commander of Bin Saud f s men was killed, and also one of Bin Jaloui^ 'Murra n 'trackers', who are employed by the Blockade authorities to 'run down' suspected contraband runners. The patrol again beat a retreat and again the merchandise was heaped up and burnt by the owners. The contrabandists suffered no loss and dispersed. It soon became known, however, from spies located in Kuwait that the two parties belonged to the Braih, and Al Bagaawi was not slow to strike. He seized 200 camels of the tribe, and threatened Bin Baud’s vengence, unless the names of the culprits were given him. This has not been done as yet but a Shamari residing with the tribe has been handed over and made a scapegoat of. On the 18th July Ibn Ashwan, Ali al Shuwairibat and Ibn Jarbua, all leading Shaikhs of the tribe, decided to go to Riath and lay their case before the King. Ali al Shuwaribat and Ibn Jarbua returned after they reached the Dahana, their hearts failing them, and Ibn Ashwan proceeded alone. Although the incident in our eyes appears small it is of first class importance among the Mutair. Should Braih get no change out of Bin Saud, and fail, to recover their camels, it is on the cards that they will attempt a mass entry into Iraq via Dulaimiyeh, etc. The above incidents have in no way deterred the manyother sportsmen engaged in running the Blockade, and the game goes merrily on.Communications on this subject should be addressed to— The Undek Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l, and the following number) quoted% COPY .

Blockade Questions Sir, In continuation of my telegram Ho, 122, dated the 19th June 1933, I have the honour to forward trans lations of the following letters for your information and that of His Majesty*s Government:- n A H Letter Ho, 68, dated the 7th Safar 1352 (23rd May 1933), from H.M. King Abdul Aziz al Saud to H.E, the Shaikh of Kuwait; 'B' Letter Ho,3/1026-R, da/ted ... (actual date will be given when letter issues) from H.E. the Shaikh of Kuwait to H.M. Abdul Aziz al Saud; 'C** Letter Ho. Hil, dated the 15th Ramadhan 1348 (14.2.1930) from H.E. the Shaikh of Kuwait to H.M. King Abdul Aziz al Saud. 2. In forwarding the above letters I beg to offer the following explanatory remarks (a) Letter 'A” came via Bahrain and was received by West bound aeroplane, which arrived at Kuwait on 15th June. It was typewritten in Arabic but was so badly expressed and so obscurely worded that it took H .E. the Shaikh two whole days to study before he could understand the meaning, and myself five days (working with three trans lators) before I was able to get out a suitable translationtranslation that would moice sense, (t&gt;) The Shaikhs reply to the King, as sent to you, has at the time of writing not been actually despatched yet. The Shaikh on leaving for Bahrain on 18,6,33 left the draft with his Secretary with orders that he should show it to me, get any suggestions that I had to make incorporated, and send it after him to 'Bahrain 'by the Air Mail of 22nd June 1933, when it would 'be sent to Bin Saud after the Shaikh had finally approved and signed it . Actually the only advice I gave was to the effect that the Shaikh should be extra careful of the ’wording of his letter, and that he would do well to point out to the King, that he could not raise his sea customs without reference to His Majesty’s Government, owing to the existence of a treaty clause 'between him and His Majesty’s Government to this effect. I thought it would 'be as well to let the King know this if indeed he is not aware of it already, (c) Letter ’‘C' has 'been included with ‘’A” and h B m above, because the Shaikh has referred to it in his communication to the King, The particular piece of history connected with this letter is as follows;- Immediately after the collapse of the Akbwan rebellion in the Spring of 1930, and after the meeting between the late Lt.-Col, Sir Hugh Biscoe and the King at Khabari Y/atha, the latter, in evidently a good mood at having got His Majesty’s Government to assist him, and especially at having had the rebel leaders handedhanded over to him, wrote to Shaikh Hafith Wahba, who had repaired to Kuwait, and told him to offer three conditions to the Shaikh of Kuwait, anyone of which, if accepted, would be the signal for him, the King, to raise the blockade. These 3 conditions summarized shortly were as follows;- (i) The King to establish one central customs post,near the frontier and inside Kejd territory and any Kejd merchant going up to Kuwait to buy goods to report at the post on his inward and outward journey. Such merchant to have from his Government, a document saying what goods he could purchase from Kuwait. The Shaikh for his part to guarantee that the merchant only took out of the Town what was mentioned in the permit. (ii) The King to establish a customs post at Subaihiyeh wells (10 miles inside Kuwait territory) and all ITejdis to visit Kuwait free of interference and the Shaikh to guarantee that each caravan tribal or otherwise would be conveyed under guard on its return journey to the post, where duty would be taken* (iii) The Shaikh to pay a lump sum annually to the King, the amount to be mutually agreed upon. The Shaikh, it seems rejected conditions (ii) and (iii), but wrote to the King accepting (i) • The King would appear to have thereupon changed his mind, probably because he saw the settlement of the Blockade in sight, a thinghe had never wanted. He struck camp and went to Ras Tanurah to meet King Faisal and never replied to the Shaikhs letter, nor even referred to it in the subsequent blockade conversations with the late Lx.-Colonel Sir Hugh Biscoe, held at Hoffuf in the Spring of 1932, at which the writer was present jTote . It seems that the above negotiations were carried out in secret, for, uncil he was told the story by the Shaikh's Secretary on 20th June 1933, the writer was unaware of the exchange of the letters in question or that Shaikh Hafith was carrying on private negotiations. 3, The Shaikh in his present reply fl B M to the King's recent letter reminds His Majesty of his letter written on the 15th Ramadhan 1348 (14.2.1930) and says that while he cannot raise his sea, customs to that of the King's Hassa posts for reasons which he explaino, is still willing and ready to agree to the King's original proposal as mentioned in 2(c) (i) above, or failing that to the placing of a string of Nejd Customs posts along the Kuwait-Hejd frontier; Further that he is prepared to cooperate to the best of his power by means of the ’’manifest” or other suitable system, provided the King will fall in with either of his counter proposals. 4. In a lengthy interview, which I Had with H.E. the Shaikh on the 18th June 1933, and at which Bin gauds letter was the subject of discussion, the Shaikh gave it as his considered opinion, that the King had written his letter out of nervousness, because, to use his words ’’He had been given the H tip” by his Ministexin London to make some move in the matter ot the blockade before His Majesty's Government, who were contemplating bringing pressure to bear on him, could act'. With this view I am inclined to agree. 5. The Shaikh was very definitely of opinion that the King had made his letter confused, garbled, and definitely obscure of set purpose and to confuse issues, and that he was as determined as ever to make no change in the situation. The only one clear point, which stood out in the King's letter was the proposal that Kuwait should raise her sea customs to that of the King's Hassa ports. This according to the Shaikh was a. ridiculous suggestion and was obviously put forward in the clear knowledge that it would be 'turned down'. Clearly if it were adopted all Kuwait trade would be diverted South in a very short time seeing that the freight to Kuwait from India was already considerably higher than that from India to Ojair or Jubail via Bahrain, and on top of freight charges and equalised customs rates Bin Saud proposed taking the 'Khawa' ta* of Rs .3/- par camel going from Kuwait into the interior. The number of these camels in Shaikh Mubaraks time is said to have numbered some 80,000 per annum and they paid approximately Rs.240,000/- in 'Khawa' tax, which fell on the shoulders of Kuwait and Hejd merchants. 6 . i asked the Shaikh whether he thought the King's letter was, possibly, a forerunner to one dealing with the 'Heutral Zone' and the American Oil Interests in Hassa. He replied that he thought not, but that it was a possibility. He then laughingly declared that he could not understand any Oil Company applying for an Oil n v-i a g. a. ^*»! Concession in Bin Baud's dominions to-day, when there was no guarantee what the future would Bring: Bor, clearly, he said, if the Sing died to-morrow, there would he general anarchy and then where would the Oil Conroany 'be who had its works in Hassa, I have, etc., (Sgd .)

Gopy, in translation, of a letter Ho.68, dated the 7th Safar 1352 (23rd May,1933) from His Majesty King Ibn Sand to His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmed al Jabir As-Subah,K.O.I.E., O.S.I.,Ruler of Kuwait. I hope you are perfectly well and enjoying tne best of health. Brother: May God Bless thee: It is long since I desired to talk about a certain matter, but fearing that communications would lead to no success, thereby losing all hopes, I was inclined to think that matters would be best settled without referring them to you. You are undoubtedly aware of our relations, both during the past and at present: They are things that cannot he explained. Now, May God preserve thee, things have long been delayed and the world, may the Almighty God protect us both from its evils - is only mortal and so are its people. That this affair of ours (the Kuwait Blockade) should exist between our two countries and two families, and for us to give it no proper attention, is neither beneficial nor advantageous; although of course you must know that it is to my real interests that this matter (the Blockade) should never be settled, and this fact, we presume, is quite clear to you as wsll ns to othors. What I have expressed below is my opinion, ana it is for you to safeguard your interests if you think it necessary for you to do so. But if it is clear that both our interests are involved then thanks be to Him, for the family is one and our countries are likewise one. I prayGod that you will never stand in need of our help. If it (an agreement between us) is in the interests of your country, you should look into the matter because I see things are 1 s hak y 1 in certain quarters. We are not after the wealth of the world, but (it is clear that) with the scanty quantities of imported goods (from other directions), and present (internal) conditions generally, my country would be clearly ruined and put in critical situation, if the door of trade were opened without conditions. This is what we ourselves perceive Nevertheless it would be a bereavement and loss of our rights were we to revert back to what has been going on hereto fore. If we were to let matters run as they are, and ■emained patient, it would mean that we should be broadening he gulf. Therefore we propose, subject to your agreement, ; he following two ways of solving the problem:- 1. That there should be a unification of yours and ) U r customs (i.e.that you should raise your sea customs to the same figure as ours): 2. That we for our part - and indeed we are entitled to do so more than they - should colled such duties on land caravans going into Nejd, as used to be taken (in the old days i.e.”Khana') by il Uawish (lutair) Ibn Rashid, Ibn Duwaihi,(Dhafir) etc. If such were to happen we also for our part would be prepared to offer you a guarantee for all and sundry (i.e.guarantee the safety of Kuwait goods and caravans going into the interior). If we can settle this matter secretly between crs.lv.s, it »iU ..H *“ d 1““ for toth “ r ““ S ““ interests of both our oouutries. .0 should uot listen^to the words of those who are deceivers and have had intentions in this natter. There are two pictures that will always strike a bad minded person. He will either say that Ibn Saud desires to get control of Kuwait; whereas Kuwait has not been born since the Saudian regime came into being, but has existed long before. Kuwait always comes to the rescue of the A1 Saua and so do the A1 Saud fly to the help of the Kuwaitians. And even were there no obstacle in our way (i.e.of attacking and taking possession of Kuwait), By God (we would not do so) for we have no ill will towards Kuwait nor its inhabitants, from its northern limits to its southern limits. Moreover it is not in our interests to do this. And added to everything we may mention that the people inhabiting Kuwait are more dear to us than our very souls. And moreover we fully realize the present sad conditions prevailing in Kuwait. Then there is another matter, I refer to that Government (His Majesty's Government). May God protect us from her evils. At the moment she is on friendly terms with us, but we greatly fear the consequences ( of her friendship with us). My reasons for saying this are many, but my proofs are clear as the sunshine. It is said by some that if the Kuwait Customs Duties were enhanced, imports would decline. What I say is tnat Kuwait cannot decline more than she has done already, even though some people think otherwise. After studying the Kuwait situation from all its angles, your brother feels bound to make mention of the follov/ing last two points, instead of (as he originally intended) only giving you a hint, or communicating the matter to you through some one else. They are as follows:-(a) Efforts from both of us are necessary it Nejd and Kuwait are both to be assisted: (b) You, my dear Brother, and my dear people of Kuwait must he made to understand my present state (i.e.the financial straits that I am in) which has lead me to pen you this. Hememher that my strength is your strength and weakness is your weakness* I have no other alternative to otter: It must be either 'Iltizam” (i. e.Guarantee of safety of caravans going into Nejd) or 'Hothing', which latter would put me in a critical position (financially). Neither you nor any Muslim Arab would ever, I think, like such a situation to arise (bankruptcy). After saying what I have said, I hope, by the Grace of God Almighty, that the door of happiness will be opened and the wound in my heart healed. I swear by the God of both Heaven and Earth, that I intended nothing by my writing. It has neither sinister political meaning, ncr do I wish to teach you your business. My words are those from a brother to his brother; from a father to his son; from a friend to his friend; and from a sufferer to^his body. I trust you do not mind what 1/said above. If the foregoing is not acceptable, your brother will not take offence. It will be out of friendship and kindness, if you accept what I propose; and will be due to your noble character, and for the advantage of all. Sal am s to all the brothers and sons.i t - K ■ ' 'B' Oopj, in translation, of letter No .3/1026-1 dated (actual date will be given when letter issues) from His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmed A1 Jabir As-Subah,K.C.I.B.,O.S.I., Ruler of Kuwait to His Majesty King IbhSaud. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your esteemed favour, for which I thank you. The friendly tone of your letter under reply coupled with the fatherly sentiments expressed therein, are all due to Your Majesty s nobility* I ask God that as long as Your Majesty survives, the relationship between our two houses, which are really but one body, may continue to remain satisfactory, and stand on the best footing. I fully believe that Your Majesty entertains all that is advantageous for us, and I also realise tea, your keen desire is to look after the interests of one and all. It is a well-known fact that Your Majesty places the welfare of your brother and his country (Kuwait) before that of your own private interests. May God the Almiphty grant you a long life for the prosperity and progress of all. I have no doubt at all about Your Majesty's statement when you say that our respective families and countries are one and the same. No doubt your Majesty is the one individual capable of rendering assistance in times of prosperity and adversity. It is you alone through whom unity can be achieved. I cannot adequately express my gratitude and esteem for the manner in which you have made known your feelings towards your brother, and I pray that you achieve your aims, and that your enemies and the deceivers be defeateddefeated always. Sire, I have carefully gone through what you have been pleased to say with regard to the establishing of 'Musabalah' (pemitting trade) between the two countries. In thanking Your Majesty I value your precious remarks, which I know are intended to be in tbe interests of both oarties, and are the outcome of true love and kindness. lith regard to what you say in the matter of the collecting again by Your Majesty of the duties 'Khawa” which used to be levied in the old days by Ibn Rashid, A1 dawish ana Bin duwaihi: The idea is a good one, and will not be difficult of enforcement, for the people and tribes of Nejd are under Your Majesty's jurisdiction, and will certainly not disobey an order that you find to be in their own interests. Your Majesty is of course far more entitled to take such duties, than the persons mentioned above were. With regard to the question that we should raise our sea customs to the level of yours: Your Majesty may rest assured that whenever possible, we will always be eager to do that which pleases you, as well as give your interests preference over ours. But Your Majesty cannot be unaware of the present sad state of our town, and the peculiar geographical position of Kuwait (in relation to the rest of the Persian Gulf). Kuwait to-day cannot bear a heavier burden than it now carries, both owing to the grave conditions of poverty that exist, and also to the general financial depression prevailing. And in passing let me say that I call God to witness that I have not the slightest suspicion of Your Majesty's good intentions, when you make the suggestionssuggestions you have, seeing that we are one family and one house* Furthermore Your Majesty without doubt is fully aware that v/e are in close relationship with His Majesty T s Government, the friend of all. And owing to certain agree ments which have been concluded between us it is not possible for us to enhance our sea customs, without a reference being made and an agreement being come to with His Majesty ! s Government. In the above connection, however, I beg to take the liberty of inviting Your Majesty 1 s attention to my letter dated 15th Bamadhan 1346 (14.2.1930), in which I begged Your Majesty to agree to introduce on the frontier certain proposals made by Your Majesty. If what was proposed then still meets with your generous approval to-day, why, then we for our part are prepared to endeavour to make it a success, and render all assistance and help in carrying out the arrangement, provided such post be on the frontier, (and not inside our territory). Such assistance to include the submitting of statements (to your oflicials) giving details of all goods exported to Nejd in particular and to other parts of Your Majesty’s dominions generally (manifest sy st em). Lastly I take the opportunity to repeat once more my thanks and gratitude for Your Majesty’s letter, and beg that your brothers views be given due and sympathetic consideration, thereby bestowing one more favour over and above the many good deeds already accomplished by Your Majesty. It is with deepest respects Sire, that I submit my above counter proposals and I trust Your Majesty will find them not difficult of acceptance. In the event, however, of your having any other pr.opo salsproposals or suggestions to make, such as the placing of a string of customs posts along the frontier line, within Nejd territory, we for our part will certainly not put any difficulties in the way or raise objection; nay, we shall be only too pleased and grateful to render all assistance and help in carrying the proposal through and making it a success*” 0 ' Oopy in translation of letter dated the 15th Ramadhan 1348 (14.2.1930) from His Sxcellency Shaikh Sir Ahmed Al-Jahir As-Subah, Ruler of Kuwait to His Majesty King Bin Baud. You are aware of the strong and close reiationsnip that existed in the past between our two families. We were and are still desirous of strengthening this relation ship but of late, unfortunately, things have occurred which no friend can look upon with indifference. It is m the interests of both parties that we revert back to the old state of affairs, and that the blockade may be raised, in such a manner as will neither hurt your interests nor be the subject of any further ill feeling between us. Shaikh Hafiz Wahbah has brought to our notice Your Majesty's suggestions and views regarding 'Musabalah” and I thank Your Majesty for your noble and generous feelings towards my country. We willingly agree with one of the suggestions made, namely, that Your Majesty should estaolish a 'single post on the frontier within the territory of Nejd, from which passes would be issued to those persons who wish to come to Kuwait and make purchases. Further we are prepared to consider any other suggestions on these lines that Your Majesty may be pleased to make*Reference to previous correspondence: &amp; Letter from the Colonial Office of the 0 ^(klifZ js*) Transmitted by direction of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. r - is Majesty's AmbassaMor, British Embassy, Baghdad.II/ CONFIDENTIAL . NOTE ON THE CONTRABAND PROBLEM OF IRA % WITH HER NEIGHBOURS, AND IN PARTICULAR HOW IT AFFECTS KUWAIT. I. GENERAL. In order to understand the whole contraband q uestion in its proper perspective one must for a start appreciate that of the States bordering on the Persian Gulf we have two distinct groups of States holding diametrically opposite policies in the natters of customs tariffs. ( a ) Persia . IRAQ, and Saudlveh . all believers in the theory that the sole object of Tariffs is to increase the Revenue of the state, and to this end instructing their Customs Departments to make their duties as high as possible. (U) Kuwait . Bahrein . Qatar . Debai (including the Trucial Coast generally), all Arab States lying on the Western shore of the Persian Gulf, whose firm belief is that low tariffs will attract trade to their ports to the definite detriment of the high tariff countries mentioned in (a) above. A not unnatural or incorrect assumption, seeing that their chief revenue is derived from their transit trade with the interior, and also the Pearl Trade, which is almost entirely in their hands. It stands to reason therefore that those countries (b) above,in the Persian Gulf, possessing such low customs duties as 4% ad valorem, are going to get most of the trade where the necessities of life are concerned, while thedr inhabitants are going to engage themselves in the contraband business with their neighbours possessing high tariffs (a) above.II. QCNXMBA ND TRAFFIC BETWESN_AH^ BliLTSS IN THE FERsm GlM MD Pmai A^ (a) The Persian policy in recent years of introducing prohibitive tariffs all along her seaboard, has naturally been taken full advantage of by the states on the Arab side mentioned in paragraph I above, and until the arrival of the new Persian Navy, the running of contraband from the Arab Coast to Persia, was a most easy and lucrative pastime. Those chiefly engaged in the business were the inhabitants of the Truci&amp;l Coast with their ingrained love of piracy and adventure (as witness the rise of Debai from a village to a large town in 20 years), although Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait have not been far behind in the game. (b) The advent of Persia’s new navy, and the strenuous efforts which Persia has since made to stop this illicit traffic, have already made themselves felt, aid contra- ^ bandists working from the Arab side of the Gulf are now ^ looking round for less risky fields for their operations. Not unnaturally they have turned their attention to the next two best countries for making profits, viz Sa’udiyeh and Iraq. Both these states maintain high customs duties as part of their national policy, especially on such things as sugar, tea, piece goods, silks, silver thread, etc. etc. (c) The Kingdom of Sa’udiyeh of the two, is the less easy to run contraband into, even though it has a long and desolate coast line, with hundreds of starving Bedouins only too ready to run cargoes into the interior in order to make a little profit. The reasons for this are as follows:- 1. The terror which Bin Baud’s harsh and cruel/3 cruel viceroy of Hassa, Iftn Jaloui, inspires among the Bedouins. 2. The fact that the tribes of Hassa are almost all at enmity with each other and will invariably give each other away. All know this. 3. The fact that Ibn Jaloui employs a small army of 'Murra' trackers to follow up the tracks of every caravan suspected of moving from the coast into the interior until it is found and can explain its movements. 4. The fact that any Bedouin tribe, which cabbares a caravan carrying contraband is allowed to take three quarters of the whole cargo caught; the state only requiring the camels, a quarter of the goods, and the culprits. (d) IRAQ on the other hand, has a snail but conven- veniently sheltered coastline, with many shoals, roundabout the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab, and in the northern reaches of the Khor Abdulla, also a long and from the contraband ists point of view, a most tempting desert frontier,several hundred miles inisngth, with police posts very far apart, and a miserably weak preventive system of car patrols , which can easily be avoided, especially during the great heat of summer, by determined persons, who know the country with their eyes shut and do all their marches by night. Lastly but not least IRAQ does not go in for the policy, as far as the writer is aware, of getting her Bedouin tribes to cooperate with Government, by a good system of subsidies, and suitable rewards for catching the contraband runners, with the result that every tribal man’s hand is against his own Government, and well in league with every contraband runner. Ill* KUjAAIT. ,md .conTRABaNd running , (a) if we reflect on the fact that there has been a failure of the pearl industry in the Gulf for the last 4 years, and that the King of 3a*udiyeh has done his utmost to restrict trade between Kuwait and the interior of Nejd, by/by a system of land Blockade extending over a period of 9 years, it is not to be wondered at that Kuwait has, and does interest herself, in running contraband goods into her two neighbours territories, Sa'udiyeh and IRAQ, and into Persia when she can. Actually because of the fact that Persia has always maintained easily the highest customs tariff of her neighbours (as much as 200% ad valorem on same kinds of goods), and the fact that 3a*udiyeh comes next (with an approximately 100% tariff on same goods), IRAQ, with her more moderate customs duties, has been and is the least sinned against, for quite naturally contrabandists make for the country offering the highest returns. (b) As mentioned in paragraph 11(a) above, the activities of the Persian Navy have made it more dangerous than before to run illicit cargoes to Persia. Nevertheless the traffic still exists, for profits are enormous. The business is mostly in the hands of Tangistani tribesmen who sail across from Persia to Kuwait with cargoes of grain, fruit, oat fodder, and H abbah* cloth. They take back tea and sugar. Those who supply them in Kuwait, are mostly Persian merchants, long domiciled in Kuwait, ar-e-me-stly -Pewianrl-ong-4oi&amp;i€44.-edr-in-4(-uwa44&gt;&gt; who have friends and relatives on the other side, who know the ropes. Cargoes are paid for in Kuwait and are run to the coast of Persia between Lingah and Bushire, the carrier going halves in the profits, when goods are disposed of. The difficult coastline of Persia is ideal for these operations. A few small cargoes are run to the Persian villages on the Barmashir channel running from Mohanmerah to the sea; These are all small cargoes, however, and bring in little profit. (c) After Persia, most of the contraband trade leaving Kuwait goes into Nejd, sometimes by camel direct across the southern border, and at other times by camels going/5 going west into the IRAQ southern desert and then when opposite Qassim,breaking up into parties of two and three and making for Qassim by a swift dash across the intervening desert. The most common method is for dhows to take cargoes down the coast to the vicinity of Jinneh Island and Abu All where there are a host of convenient shoals and hiding places. From there cargoes are landed on the mainland, where the starving Awazim, Bani Khalid, Ajiran, and Mutair, who incidentally all have relatives in Kuwait to put them wise, are only too ready to cooperate if they safely can. It may not be out of place to mention that at the time of writing, the duty fixed by the Sa'udiyeh Government on sugar entering Hassa is Rs.il/- on a bag costing Rs.ll/-, so it is worth risking much to get the stuff in free. h.§ regards IRAQ, who, as I have mentioned above is the third in order of States sinned against: y/hat contraband does go from Kuwait across her borders, is run in the following manner small dhow to the entrance of the Shatt alArab and to the upper reaches of Khor Abdulla. frontler aJ Sf 1 Kuwait? niCey aCr ° SS the westem Method (1) is managed usually a s follows: Small traders from the various villages on the IRAQ side of the lower reaches of the Shatt al Arab, come down to Kuwait by small boat or 'Ballam' containing crews of perhaps 4 to 5 men each. They find things very cheap, as compared with the cost and trouble of getting the same articles at Basrah. The difference is probably about a quarter of what they would have to pay in their country. These boats, which come l«-den with iruit, vegetables, firewood, etc. for an of which Kuwait is dependent on IRAQ, fill up with loads suff icient/sufficient to fill tiieir boats; approximately 10 to 30 bags of sugtr or other dutiable articles. The crews then try and get back under cover of night, either by entering the Shatt al Arab and creeping past Fao Customs Post, or dumping their cargoes on the 'boggy' mud flats existing at the top end of the Khor Abdulla, whence confederates at once take the goods over, and hide them in the many villages and hamlets existing in the Palm belt of the Shatt al Arab It is true that occasionally small Kuwait dhows are hired to run these cargoes, but they are the exception and not the rule. Method (2) is managed as follows, and as far as one can gither, much the bigger volume of contraband traffic goes into IRAQ this way: For six months in each year Kuwait State is overrun by the Muntafik and Hamar Lake shepherd tribes. Approximately some 15,000 persons male and female enter Kuwait after the first fall of rain (November) and spread themselves like locusts over the whole country from Safwan to the Kuwait Neutral zone and as far west as Riga! in the Batin. These people are all the time sending parties into Kuwait to sell their sheep, wool and ghee and in return buy food and clothing, part of which is oi course for their own legitimate needs, but a large portion is for passing on to confederates, who come down from the Euphrates from as far west as Sanaawa and live with them until such time as they can run the stuff they have bought across the western frontier of Kuwait. These con federates are all tough and well armed customers, who dress and look like shepherds. They arrive with plenty of money and either come into the town and buy themselves, or depute the shepherd tribal women to do so. The contraband so run usually goes through to the thickly populated tribal country7 on totii sides of the Euphrates; Little of it, it is said, finds its way into the towns. The shepherd tribes do not themselves engage much in the actual running of contraband across the border as for the most of their sojourn in Kuwait they are too busy minding their flocksp they do, however, harbour other tribesmen from IHAQ, who easily pass locally for IRAQI shepherds. When, however, the timecomes for them, the shepherds, to move back to their homes in IRAQ, which happens each year in April and May, then each tent and family loads up as much contraband as it possibly can on its donkeys and takes it back to its home on the Euphrates, for personal consumption. The volume of this particular form of contraband trade is nothing like that dealt with by their friends, the gentry, who come down from the Euphrates with money in plenty especially to buy goods. For these work with camels (not donkeys) supplied by the Ehafir, Kuntafik and Jasha’am tribes, which carry five times as much as the small donkey of the country. (e) There is another and equally successful method to that above mentioned. It Is the Dhafir and Shammar tribal method. Every year, just before simmer sets in (April and May) several sections of these two tribes, move into Kuwait and camp on the wells of Jahara or south near the oUbaihlyeh and lawil wells. They come ostensibly to 'Summer' near the 'Arfaj' grazing grounds, which Kuwait is famed for. The visitors number anything from 30 to 300 tents, ihey all have their 'pals', especially the Dhafir in their rear, across the border in the IRAQ southern desert. Shat easier for these sections camped In Kuwait territory to shelter IRAQ contrabandists in the same way as the shepherd tribes do. These latter, more often than not/8 not, paid agents of merchants in the towns along the Euphrates, sit quiet in camp and make their purchases through the medium of the Bedouin with whom they are living. These latter can he seen in droves coming into the town daily, and marching hack to their camps with fully loaded camels. If one stops them and asks where the stuff is going to, they invariably reply 'for ourselves and our friends, we are engaged in ‘musahilah 4 ; Iraq is too expensive for us to-day, and we are forced to come and buy our daily reeds from Kuwait.* These Bhafir and Shammar purchasers are of course xun, oy means known to the B 0 douin only,across to their brethren in I&amp;A.Q, and then slowly and surely and in small amounts, find their way up to the Euphrates towns. Original bales, boxes etc. are carefully broken and repacked into smaller parcels before the Euphrates is reached. (f) It may be of interest to mention here that Haji Abdulla Williamson at one time in our Intelligence service used before the war to run camels and contraband from Kuwait to Damascus by the desert route. During the Muntafik rebellion against the Turks on the Euphrates, he ran rifles and ammunition from Muscat to the rebels. He used to land his cargoes on the Hasa coast, south of the Kuwait Nectral Zone, convey them past Subaihiyeh and Jahara and across the Batin up to the Euphrates and employed the Bhafir, and AJman Bedouin for the purpose as described in (e) above. Haji Abdulla, with whom I have discussed .he contraband question, has expressed his entire agreement with the contents of this “Note.* This contraband problem, I fear, is not going to be an easy one for IRAQ to handle, nor would the Kuwait authorities find it any easier to tackle, however willing \ A they/- 9 - willing they be to cooperate* This for the simple reason that Kuwait fa) is looked upon by all Bedouin of north east Arabia as their natural home and market for all their wants and it is the policy of Kuwait to encourage this feeling in spite'of Bin Saud f s Blockade; (b) Kuwait would to-day die a natural death if this one remaining outlet for her desert trade were denied her; (c) Any attempt of the Shaikh to control what the Bedouin bought or took out would be playing directly into the hands of Bin Baud, and would be a deadly blow to his prestige. Furthermore it would be quite impossible for anyone in Kuwait to say what was legitimate or what illegitimate trade where the desert Arab was concerned. They come from the North, South, and lest of the State, and it is not the shopkeepers concern to ask where their stuff goes, nor indeed would our friend of the Desert say where he intended to take his purchases for fear lest one of Bin 3aud T s spies in the town reported his moyements to A1 Bagaawi, Bin Gaud r s Chief Blockade Officer. Nor must it be forgotten that the Shaikh of Kuwait, does all in his power to encourage trade with the desert tribes in the hopes that all goods will eventually find their way to Nejd, and so annoy Bin Baud. J.. Undoubtedly the one and only really effective or satisfactory method for Iraq to adopt will, in the long run, be to reduce her customs duties on all imports to the lowest that she can afford, iiaa as a matter of policy . and above all to give up the idea entirely of treating her Customs Department as a revenue producing concern. IPAQ is surrounded by long, lonely and difficult frontiers, all eminently suited to the professional contraband runners methods. If she maintains her present very high import duties, as she is trying to do, she will have to employ large numbers of preventive police, whose upkeepVIII/ - 10 - upkeep and maintenance will swallow up all profits made. This is the writers considered view on the situation, and he has been able to study the problem from both sides of the picture, both when he was Political Officer in charge of the Muntafik for 5 years, and to-day with his 4i years experience of Kuwait. H. One last point. One notices that there is a growing tendency in IRAQ and elsewhere, to believe that the people of Kuwait Town are the actual 'contrabandists' and are the bold villains who are for ever going backwards and forwards into IRAQ plying their nefarious trade. This is an entirely erroneous idea. The Kuwaitis are quite content to sit in their shops and sell their wares. The actual contraband runners are always Persians, Nejdis or IRAQIS, who come from their own countries armed with the necessary funds. These gentry as mentioned elsewhere are always in the closest touch with confederates on their side of the border, who are a necessary part of the game. VII . A final point: Let it not be thought that no contraband comes from Nejd into IRAQ, just because of the fact that Nejd maintains a higher tariff than IPAQ. It is common local knowledge that luxuries, such as silver thread ? Zerri tf , 'unwoven silks' and especially 'Japanese piece goods' which to-day are being dumped in ever increasing quantities and at far below fair trade prices, into the lejjaz and Hassa, are regularly being brought up into IRAQ via passim, by Bedouins who have no transport charges to bear. It should never be forgotten that a camel journey from say Medina to IRAQ is nothing at all to a Bedouin. It is indeed a sort of pleasure and pastime, and enables him to see new faces, and bring back strange goods in return. There are signs also that melted down silver is going into IRAQ from Kejd today in considerable quantities. The IRAQ customs are no doubt aware of this.- 11 - £LLL* To sur up: If IRAQ seriously desires to cheek the ^flow ox contraband across her borders, the writer with very great o.ifiid.en.ce offers the following advice: (a) She should reduce her present Customs all round ana get away from the idea of looking upon the Customs Department as a money producing concern, Co) She should, as Bin Saud does, get her tribal elements on the border to by offering them 4 of the proceeds of any contraband they can catch, or be the means of catching. At the same time IRAQ should realize that (b) is a double edged weapon, and one which like the 'boomerang' might easily come back and hurt the thrower - in this case, IRAQ. fSgd). H.R.P.

Sir Andrew Ryan’s telegram of 5th June on P.Z.3339 helow appears to afford some slight hope of an improvement in relations between Ibn 3aud and Koweit and of the modification of the blockade, though everything must turn on the nature of the proposal stated to have been made by Ibn' 3aud in regard to commercial relations with Koweit. It is the more satisfactory, however, in that the most recent reports from Koweit (compare the extract from the Koweit Intelligence summary of 21st April, f laggecAbelow) emphasise not only the continuance of the blockade, but the loss oi fa 1th in tne power or willingness of H.A.G-. to ao anything effectively to assist uA the Sheikh of Koweit.2.

The order particularly excluded Kuwait , which, as reported in this Agency Summary for Larch, is more strictly ■blockaded than ever. The Shaikh of Kuwait in a long talk with the writer on 24th April 1933, whilst reporting the news, rather pathetically, said that apparently it was no good his saying anything more to His Lajesty’s Government against this unfai and preferential treatment as all his other requests to the British Government to see that justice should he done him hy his neighbours, in this as well as other matters, were never taken notice of. '’Talk there haa been in plenty” he said •’but no satisfactory or concrete decision has yet resulted.” ’’Your Government”, he added, 'seem to have icrgotten how to act these days, and only like to talk, until people get so tired that the point in dispute dies a natural death”.

The POLITICAL RESIDENT expressed the view that as little was likely to come of Ibn Baud's proposal for a commleslon, as he would only relax the blockade under pressure, Itmculd be as well to have some concrete suggestion to urge upon him. He would probably revert to the other proposals which he had made on this subject In the past, namely, either that the Sheikh of Xcwelt should pay an annual lump sum to him In respect of Saudi Customs dues to Kowelt, or that he (Xbn Baud) should maintain an agent to Xoweito Both these proposals had proved objectionable to the Sheikh* x’here was, however, a third suggestion which had also been made previously, namely, that a number of Saudi Customs posts should be set up outside Kovelt.

The Foreign Office comments in the light of the proposals in our letter on that paper will be found on P.Z.2111. As will be seen, the Colonial Office generally accepted the slightly modified proposals put forward by them. 2. The situation generally was discussed at an interdepartmental meeting,attended by Colonel Fowle on 28th April, provisional notes of which are below. . will be seen, the Hesiaent was in general disposed to think that the balance of advantage lay with putting the onus of a decision as regards the method of dealing with the claims upon the Sheikh himself. I gather that he thinks it quite likely that the Sheikh will abandon them when the alternatives suggested by this Office are placed before him, although he may simply refuse to make up his mind. But if he procrastinates all responsibility for further delay is his. On the general question, Colonel Fowle indicated that he was not optimistic as to the probable result of the Blockade Commission and expressed his readiness to fall in with the c-onfluo^fcr of policy suggested by the Foreign Office on the understanding that no very substantial delay would be involved. If, in the light of conversation with the Sheikh of Koweit on his return, the Resident sees any reason to modify his view he will report officially. 3.

As will Pe seen from Colonel Fowle's despatch of 2nd February now submitted, the Sheikh, being reluctant to offend Ibn Saud by openly challenging His Majesty’s interpretation of the correspondence which passed between the two rulers in February 1932, has taken refuge in the suggestion that a committee of interpretation should be appointed, to consist of two representatives of Ibn Saud, two of the Sheikh, and a fifth member as President chosen by the representatives of both sides. This suggestion, which has been discussed informally with the Colonial Office and Foreign Office, is regarded as quite impracticable by both of them, and having communicated it to H.M.G. with a certain measure of support. They both feel that the Sheikh j must come into the open if he wants us to fight this case for him. 2. While it is impossible not to sympathise with the Sheikh in the delays which have taken place, it is equally impossible to regard his latest reaction as at all satisfactory, and we must, I think, admit that there is force in the view taken by the other interested departments. I submit a tentative draft to the Colonial Office. fc j ^ M CGX kaM. ^0 * C-d. (A a posed to criticise the Resident for 'The/ 1212 5COO 9.32* m mir if ; ETC The position is almost a deadlock, which has been reached largely owing to the bheikh 01 hov/eit s own ill-advised action. After lengthy consideration of all kinds of suggestions for solving the blockade problem, Col. Biscoe achieved the nearest approach to a solution that has yet been sighted when he met Ibn Baud m January 1932; he got the King to suggest reference of the question to a comnission composed principally oi merchant on either side. This proposal was put formally to the Heiaz Govt, in a note of 19th August, 1932 (P.Z. 5452/32). Sir A. Ryan was also authorised to make, at such moment as he considered most suitable, an informal communication regarding the Sheikh’s claims in respect raids. Rather unfortunately, perhaps, the Minister made this communication at the same time as the proposal for a blockade commission, and the result was that Ibn Baud not unnaturally assumed that appointment of the commission was being stipulated for as a conditior of waiver of the raid claims. Matters were made much worse by the fact that six months previously Ibn Baud had received a letter from the Sheikh of Koweit, dated 16th February, 1932, which bears the natural interpretation that the Sheikh had already waived these claims. In consequence of this combination of events, Ibn Baud, while agreeing to the commission in principle, has refused to take any steps in the matter until the question of claims is cleared out of the way. We are thus held up on the blockade question. The Sheikh’s suggestion that his letter of 16th February, 1932, should be referred to arbitration was/ H-Minute Paper. Department. ie: 1212 5000 0/32 was clearly unsuitable, and it is to be hoped that we shall not get involved in farther correspondence regarding these claims, on which the Sheikh will never get any satisfaction from Ibn Saud, and which hold up the prospect of getting the blockade question settled. After consulting !fr. Laithwaite, I have added, paras. 3 and 4 to the draft, suggesting that our advice to the Sheikh should incline towards relinquishment of these claims.^Ol 5000 1 1.32 Draft Paper. 3'2' political Department. DRAFT TETTER , The Under Secretary of State, Sir, Colonial Office. In reply to your letter of the 6th March, No*18148/33, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India ! to say that he appreciates the reasons for the reluctance of the Sheikh of Koweit definitely to erf commit himself as-4rO-4he -re as enable intrerpretetTren to bo p-lacod: on his correspondence of February 1932 with Ibn ~ ' ^ ^ir Philip Gunliffe-Lister is aware, he feels much sympathy with the Sheikh of Koweit and attaches importance to doing anything j ohaime- in regard to the Saudi |blockade on his land frontier. But she feels strongly at the same time that if the Sheikh wishes possible to meet his legitimate to fight the case for him H.E.must be prepared to come into the open,and TIER I either face the risk of causing offence to Ibn Saud (who has not shown himself unduly tender of Koweiti susceptibilities or interests in recent years) oi^ cease to pursue tty **** ^&amp;i*t}** the point now in issue. He is not He is not di sposeddisposed to regard the establishment of a committee to give a ruling on the meaning of the correspondence now in question as a satisfactory solution of the difficulty which has arisen, 2. Subject to the views of the other interested Departments Sir S.Hoare is inclined in these circumstances to think that the Sheikh should be informed that H.M.Gh cannot regard the suggestion of a committee to decide on the interpretation of his letter of Feb,1932 to Ibn Saud as satisfactory, and that the alternatives in- their - virew~ now appear to be (a) that he should himself pursue tne interpretation of the correspon dence of last February direct with Ibn Saud, (b) that if he feels reluctant to adopt thisccurse, he should authorise H.M.G.to inform Ibn Saud on his behalf that he had no intention in the correspondence in question of disposing of any but entirely minor or local claims, or Vc) 1f ■noithos-of t.hs nhovo 0(W8ej tohm, that we should accept the position that the situation hasDraft Paper. Department. HOI has been irremediably compromised by the correspondence in question, and wholly abandon these cMms (making such merit as is possible of the Sheikh 1 s action in doing so) in order to remove the obstacle which ! they constitute to the appointment of a Blockade Commission. 3. Sir S. Hoare would suggest that the Political Resident should be instructed at the outset of his communication to the Sheikh to remind H.E,, in a. friendly and sympathetic spirit, of/the history of the events which have led to the present impasse. H.M.G. have all along been making every endeavour to secure a settlement of the blockade question satisfactory to the Sheikh. The proposed appoint ment of a Commission^which appears to be the most promising avenue towards a satisfactory settlement that has yet been suggested^ emerged from Colonel Biscoe ! s conversations with Ibn Saud in January 1932, during which the whole subject was discussed from every angle. When this proposal was formally made to the Hejaz Government they stated that the King agreed in principle j but preferred to postpone the Commission/ 5000 11.32Cornraission pending a settlement of the question of claims^ which had been raised at the same time^ but which the King had already been waived in the Sheikh’s letter of 16th February 1932. 4. It appears to Sir Samuel Hoare that with a view^to securing the appointment of the,,Commission the Sheikh would be well advised to drop the /laid claims on which presumably thare is virtually no prospect of securing any satisfaction from Ibn Saud^ especially as it is impossible to ignore that they have been compromised by the Sheikh’s letter of 16th February 1932. He would therefore suggest that the Resident should be instructed, while putting the-three alternatives and avoiding any language likely to give offence to the Sheikh, to advise him in favour of course (c) above. In making this suggestion Sir S. Hoare is strongly influenced by the probability that either (a) or (b) would lead to fruitless correspondence which would inevitably delay, and might altogether jeopardise, the chance of settling the blockade question, 5. As Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister is aware from recent despatches from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf// Draft Paper. Department.

The serious delay which has taken place in advancing the matter now under discussion is to no small extent due (as the Political Resident might be authorised to emphasize to the Sheikh) to the Sheikh 1 s independent correspondence with ! Ibn Saud and to the difficulty which has been experienced in securing any definite reply from him to the enquiries made by the Political Resident. It is^ any further delay to a minimumjand Sir Samuel Hoare would suggest that the Resident should be asked to deal with the matter as expeditiously as possible and on a telegraphic basis, with a view to the early resumption at Jedda of the reduce 1401 5000 11 discussion^discussions on the subject of the blockade. ^6.

If the latter concurs and the Committee actually meets then the point will be settled. I say * if it actually meets* since Ibn Baud is quite capable of concurring and then confidentially enjoining his represontat ives on the Committee to object to a^r President proposed by the Kuwaiti members.

Al Bagaawi himself is camped with his family in the vicinity of Khabari Wadtha Forth of Jarriya. The general opinion in Kuwait continues to be as it always has been that nothing will persuade Bin S&amp;ud to raise or even ease off the ’’Blockade**, except forcible measures on the part of His Majesty’s Government. dentGovernment# Further that the assurance made to His Majesty 1 s representative in Hoffuf in Fehrusxy 1932, that he the King would agree to a 'Commission 11 sitting, to find a suitable way of settling the Blockade question in a manner favourable to both sides, was so much clever camouflage and nothing more. With this view the writer agrees. In the meantime hope is everywhere entertained that the Asir operations will end in defeat for Bin Saud and will bring an end to the Blockade.

BEEH ’OLiTICAL COMMIT TEE, Previous Papers 44.75b 1000 5.30 Colonel Fowle's despatcli gives an interesting record of his first official visit (as Resident) to Koweit and of the Sheikh's general attitude. H.E. made a good impression, hut the Resident was placed in a position oi some embarrassment by obvious feeling that had none little to help him as regards either his date gardens or the removal of Ibn Baud's blockade. 2. Our case is perhaps rather better in the matter of the blockade than in that of the date gardens. We did admittedly undertake in 1929 that, provided the Sheikh 'co-operates | loyally at the present juncture' H.M.G. 'will make every effort to secure for him an honourable/honourable settlement on lines suggested and / that if he will formulate proposals which would be acceptable to him for the settlement of the dispute H.M.G. will be prepared to examine those 1 proposals and to consider the possibility of approaching King Ibn Saud in order to secure his acceptance' (Colonial Office telegram dated 2hth July 1929, P.5035/29). Since then there has been considerable correspondence and discussion, and the point is one of those which wsre raised by the late Sir Hugh Biscoe in. his interview with Ton Saud last spring. But the prospect of an immediate improvement has been somewhat lessened by the unfortunate incident in the early part of this year when the Sheikh replied to a letter from Bin Saud in such terns as to iable the latter to claim that he had abandoned a ubstantial portion oi his demand^. The Resident has recently been instructed to take this point up again with the sheikh with a view to a further attempt on our part to persuade Bin Saud to adopt a more reasonable attitude. ^ or bate gardens, a draft case for submission to the uaw Officers has now been produced. This Office has always felt that the Sheikh ha s been badly treated, ior the obligation is one which ought to have been safeguarded at a time when we were in a position to , ? oV impose conditions on Iraq (either in 1920 or 1923). Something must depend on the reply of the -aw Officers to the reference to be made to them, but it is to be hoped that an early decision will be reached. There is no question as to the importance, strategic and otherwise, of Koweit and as to the desirability of maintaining the Prestige of H.K.G. at as high a level as^possible in the state, 'p k &lt;1 'll*) /// lCONFIDENTIAL.

From To The Hon 1 ble Lt.Colonel T .C.Fowle,C.•, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Hew Delhi• Sir, I have the honour to state that 1 have just returned from a visit to Kuwait where I stayed five days, and so had ample opportunity of making the acquaintance of His Excellency the Shaikh with whom - in company with Colonel Dickson - I had many conversati or s. 2 , X had only met His Excellency for a few hours last year, and was glad of this opportunity of getting to know him better. X was favourably impressed by him* He is, I think, a moderately strong character, though inclined to be impulsive and no match at 'political poker n i or that astute player His Majesty Ibn Saud - witness the incident of their interchange of letters on the subject of Hejd- Kuwait claims dealt with in my despatch Ho*45 ( copy to the Government of India and Jed da under my printed letter Ho. 675-S) of 17th September 1932. His Excellency has . t attractive manners, and a pleasing personalty# He is reported to be something of a miser f (though this does not K extend to hie peraonal hoepitality), but in on impoverished State «* • •State tftia is so toad tiling - as the late Sir EttgH Biscoe painted out* xio is 9 1 tninK, ^enuinel^ loyal to us, and prefers *n s ,liaarnen to otmr foreigners, tout nis loyalty nas been very Hlg&amp;ly tried by mmt Be considers our failure to assist Mm tooth in the matter of his date gardens and ibn Saud’s blockade, and there to&amp;re been incidents lately - as both Colonel dckson and l agree - which show that he is # trying to 'keep in' unofficially ana sub rasa with tooth Uejd and Iraq* her do I see how he can be blamed for this* If, in his opinion, his Majesty's Government will not * or cannot - fight his battles for him, he sees no way tout to resort to secret diplomacy in order to placate his powerful neighbours. 3 , The questions on which he feels most strati ly are the two mentioned above* I found it difficult to give any satisfactory replies,^ that is to say replies which would appear to Mm satisfactory }, in answer to his queries as to why His Majesty’s Government did not assist him as to the Blockade vis a vis ibn daud, and as to his date gardens vis a vis Iraq. He stated that in both cases he relied on the assurances of assistance and promises of His Majesty’s Government * in regard to the former the assurances conveyed to him iollo«in,, on the Secretary of State for the Colonies’ telegram of 2t&gt;th July 1929 to the Political Kesident, and in regard to the latter the promises contained in Colonel Knox’s letter dated 14th Bhilnijjah 1352 (3rd Sot ember 1*14}. he pointed out that in the matter of his own blockade in 1929-30 against Ibn dawish and the other rebels against Ibn 3*ud, enjoined on him toy His .ajesty’s Government, he was helping to kill and starve into surrender tribe® - the Mutair - ior example - who though nominally Ibn baud’s subjects were fro® old times really under Kuwait, xa&amp;ny of whom - including Iton Sawish himself - being old friends and player-'-of his*He stated with some emotion that he had received the most desperate appeals from these friends of his for assistance, which appeals it had wrung his heart to refuse. He also informed me that - at the same period - he had received confidential and urgent exhortations from the highest (Iraqi) quarters in Iraq to assist the rebels to the best of his ability in order that Ibn Baud should be definitely smashed* That they - the highest quarters - could nothing, because of the English, but that if he - the Bhaikh - would take action they would help him secretly. And what - His Excellency asked me - had he gained by standing firm against those appeals and exhortations ? Xbn Baud’s blockade, instead of ceasing, had increased in severity, and was literally strong, ling Kuwait to death. Moreover, His Excellency pointed out, his own notables in Kuwait were continually attacking him on the subject of His Majesty’s Government’s attitude. * You stand by the English Government , they sneered. 4f Ah&amp;t has the English Government done for you in the matter oi youi date gardens, or in the matter of Xbn Baud’s blockade, which is now ruining us ? w 4. I cannot say that - as His Majesty’s Government’s local representative - I enjoyed our conversations on these subjects, or that I particularly like repeating them for His Majesty’s Government’s information, but I would fail in my duty if I did not report what His Excellency’s feelings are. As I have already indicated, 1 found it difficult to give replies to His Excellency’s complaints. The line X was two-fold. i*'irst - that I would report the gist of His Excellency’s views - which X h&amp;ve done, and second - that Kuwait - placed between two more powerful neighbours, Bejd and Iraq - needed a strong friend, and that - from the long- point of view - this friend was undoubtedly the British Government • His •..• 4- Hie Excellency agreed with the latter dictum, and seemed to take some comfort from my reply. I cannot conceal, however, the disturbing fact that in Kuwait, both with Ruler and people, British prestige is on the wane, an opinion which Colonel Dickson - who is in the best position to know - fully endorses, 5, I do not wish to give the impression, however, that my conversations with His Excellency were confined to the two distressing,questions mentioned above* My main object in paying a long visit to ICuwait was not to find an immediate solution for its problems, which cannot be hoped for, but to establish personal and sympathetic contact with its sorely-tried i dler, and in this - with the assistance of Colonel Dickson - I think I succeeded. His Excellency and 1 had many conversations on more cheerful and general topics, and generally I think we established mutually cordial relations* I am sending a copy of this letter to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India*CONFIDENTIAL.

This is a more than likely move, and the setting up of a light wireless set at Jarriya has been anticipated bythe writer for se^time past.^• Mfor note r e&amp;evdiriK Mr.Philb y. Mrs.Dickson who arrived back from London on 7th . ? rr vbztAj ! October reported having met ^.n London on 21st September. The latter in the course of a discussion of the Kuwait Blockade made the interesting statement that it was ni-Lte absurd bo think that the King would in anyway agree to a modincation of the blockade. Bin Baud, he said, would Only cnange his attitude and allow Kuwait to trade witn the interior on two conditions namely (a) if Kuwait agreed to come under his suzerainty (b) if she allowed a nCjd Customs Officer to sit in the Kuwait Customs House and take a snare of the customs receipts for his master, which he added would be tantamount to Kuwait coming under Bj_n uoUd’s coxiovol. The King’s attitude in the matter, added Mr.philby was a right and natural one, and questions of sentiment or what Kuwait had done in the past for the King, would never be allowed to count for anything where the King’s ambition was concerned. This ambition ever lay in tne possession of the port of Kuwait. Mr.pnilby scorned I rs.Dickson’s suggestion that the obvious way out of the difficulty was for Bin Band to place a Revenue Officer on the border and collect taxes from outgoing caravans and Bedouin at the natural line of wells, Hafar ,Bafa,Wabra,Jerriya and ’Nta, as he said this would be too expensive and not in accordance with his policy. Mrs.Dickson replied that already Bin Baud spent much money in maintaining Blockade parties as it was, and tnat if these were reduced somewhat and replaced by Customs Posts, much less expenditure would be incurred. Mr.philby’s only reuly was that such course was quite impossible. He added that though thethe King’s finances were bad at present, a good pilgrim year must come soon, and when this happened the King’s first intention was to develop a port on the Hassa Coast.i, Register No. (A' 1 t«&gt; N ^ SECRET. 7 POLITICAL DEPARTMENT Letter Telegram from Dated Rec.

I said that I thought on the whole that we should see no strong objection to action on the lines proposed by them. The position is far from clear and there is no question but that the rather loosely worded communication sent by the Sheikh to Ibn Saud in the early part of this year has made a substantial difference. The simplest course in the circumstances would be to put the alternative to the Political Resident and see what he and Colonel Dickson thought about it.

Blockade . 5 As anticipated in paragraph/of intelligence summary No. 151 of ?th September 1932 the blockade is now being strictly enforced by the unpleasant Hamud al Bagaawi. This Officer has his headquarters at Jarriya, and has a subordinate named ibn Shajaan camped at Hafar al Batin. This latter is a renegade Mutairi in the employ of ibn Jaloui and bears an equally unsavoury name to that of his master. Both persons are personally known to the writer. by Ibn Khraimis for patrol purposes along the border, are no ’longer in use, being complete wrecks and lying at Jarriya. assist him which he brought from Hoffuf. They number 40 and are scattered in parties of 5 or 6 at each at the various Summan watering places. Ibn Shajaan has some 15 men at Hafar. It is confirmed that the blockade has at any rate for the present, been taken out of the hands of the Amir Saud, and been transferred to Abdulla ibn Jaloui the Amir of Hassa. in Kuwait from Riadh on 12th September 1932 (he left Riadh on 31st August) the commonly believed story at the capital as to the reason why al Bagaawi relieved ibn Khraimis, is that it was all due to Mohomed al Tawils’ (Revenue Officer of Hassa) complaints to the King, it was said that the latter had. guaranteed that Hassa would produce 11 lacs of Revenue but that this was falling very farshort of expectations. To save himself, he had complained of the big 'dump 1 ’ of contraband goods recently found at bta, and had reported that much more besides was regularly being smuggled out of Kuwait, The two ^ord cars which used to be employed ■ Al Bagaawi has a special body of men to According to a reliable agent who arrived intointo Nejd. He had intimated that he could not be responsible for further collection of revenue, unless the King put ibn Jaloui in charge of Kuwait blockade operations, and a much more severe policy was instituted on the Kuwait frontier. Comment . There would appear to be some truth in the above story, and it ia more than likely that the new policy has been introduced at the instance of A1 Tawil merely to save his own skin. In the writer’s opinion very little ever got out of Kuwait in ibn Khraimis’ time, and there were no signs at all that blockade running ms on the increase. On the contrary all evidence tends to show that tne blockade was never so effective as during the last year. IV.

Very little news has come from the interior during the period under review, regarding Ibn Hifada. That this worthy has been defeated and killed is now generally believed, but the failure of the barb war party under ibn Huhait to return home is looked upon as significant. A Bedouin 15 days from the adi Sirhaa orth- est of Janf reported on the 7th September that while ibn Rifada was certainly killed and his force defeated, the remnants of the latter had taken refuge in the mountains near the scene of the battle and were for the present holding out there. In his opinion they roust soon surrender however, if they had not done so already. Ee confirmed that Ibn Tugaiya 2nd in command of the rebels had not been filled. Qomaent. The ibn Rifada affairs has caused a very deep stir ail over the North-Eastera corner of Arabia, and everyone was in high hopes that he would have done something. Bedouin-like however, no one was prepared to risK a move until that something happened. His defeat and death will no doubt discourage those tribes and individuals who bear Bin Baud ill will, and they are vor-. ...may tMax, but it will not quench their spirit, or drive them to despair. On the contrary, tneir hatred for their master will grow more intense, and they will continue to live for the day of revenge. These remarks especially refer to the Great Mutair and Ajman tribes. A curious thing about this ibn Rifada business has been and still is the almost universal belief in the Bedouinsmind that the British were affording him support, and nothing will persuade ones sedouin friends to believe that Captain Glubb was not the prime mover in the play. I?.(f Pernor, .of Biadh , There were several rumours during the latter part of August to the effect that the Amir Faisal on his return from Kuwait had replaced his brother 3aud as (xovernor % of Hiadh and that the latter had been recalled to Taif, but there would appear to be no truth in the story* According to a merchant traveller who has just arrived from Taif via Hiadh and Bahrain, the Amir Faisal is back at Taif and has resumed his duties there. This has also been partially confirmed by letters from t! Al Tawil' who also has returned from Mecca to Hassa. Incidentally the former person reported that the Hassa revenue was already 1/3 short of what was anticipated but no doubt Bahrain will get full news about this* Y. fliiistok* About the 25th of August Bin 3aud f s Horth-iiast frontier official ibn Khraimis was suddenly recalled and replaced by the infamous and cruel Hamud al Bagaawi* The new arrival is a worthy of very unsavoury reputation and known in Kuwait as the H butcher ’ of Abdullah bin Jaloui, Governor of Hassa* His taking over charge of the Blockade operations appears to be connected in some way or other with the presentation by His Majesty’s Minister in Jedda of Kuwait’s claims, and the letter proposing that the long promised Commission be appointed to deal with the Blockade. Suiiice to say that ibn ‘Bagaawi has given out far and wide that his master the King, having noticed that there was a falling off in the way the Blockade was maintained, had made ibn Jaloui responsible for the Hejd - Kuwait frontier policy, and had appointed him to tighten up the blockade as it had never been tightened up before. It■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■hhhbhhhhbhhvhihhbbhbhbhhmhbbhhhhhhhbhhhi MMmw&amp;&amp;£miz&amp; » 1 1 p r It certainly would appear that al Ba^aawi f s arrival on the scene is no mere coincidence, and it is not in the least unlikely that Bin Baud, feeling annoyed at the action oi His Majesty*s Minister at Jedda, should have straightway desired to vent his spleen on Kuwait and so otdered a more severe policy to be introduced on the Kuwait frontier * This would fit in well with Bin Saud*s well known methods. The Shaikh of Kuwait is naturally not a little anxious at the turn of ev nts and also believes that something has happened to cause him to be the object of the King*s wrath once again, seeing that not a word (letter or telegram) has been received from Bin Baud telling him of ibn H3fada f s defeat or anything else. Bin Baud would normally never dream of omitting to send him joyous news of such a nature. That al Bagaawi * s arrival means harsh and further cruel treatment of the tribes, and possibly incursions across the frontier into Kuwait goes without saying. He is the man chiefly responsible for all the raids and killings that took place in Kuwait territory between seven and nine years ago, and the cause incidentally of many now of the claims which have/been preferred by His Majesty*s Minister. •fi It will be interesting to see developments.—' a- ^ Communications on this subject should be addressed to— The Under Secretary oe State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l. and the following ^ Number quoted : 98048/ 2/32 II f Y tOcf. /f.2 &lt;nJj ) &gt; Downing Street, October . ^^2* 3.9 •’SB • 00^32. ^44 b&lt;&gt; Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister to refer to the letter from this Department of the 16th September, numbered as above, regarding the question of the Kuwait-Nejd claims, and to transmit to you, to be laid before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, a copy of the correspondence on this subject noted in the margin.

His Majesty wrote his suggested letter and it was given ta Colonel Dickson for delivery to His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait*whom it eventually reached, who in dm ceuro« replied, (copies of these were ffcrwarded to you under my printed letter Mo* 42 of the 13th Sept ember, 1932 (Ho. 659-S to the Government of India and Jedda)) t and to whom His Majesty sent an acknowledgment (copy enclosed herewith) His Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, London*herewith) Some apprehension i?as felt by Sir Hugh Biscoe Inst His Majesty should read the widest possible meaning into the above correspondence and on the 14th March 1932 h© addressed a oocommication on the subject to the Political Agent* Kuwait: •Does not this (i.o. the correspondence referred to) wipe out the whole of Kuwait’s claims against Kejd in respect of Akhwan raids* etc? If it does not* X think it would be bb well to clear up the ratter.* The Shaikh*who had not yet recovered from the Hypnotising influence of a visit to His Majesty at Riyadh.where he had been well received* •Definitely and indignantly rejected the idea* that Ibn Baud*8 rronosel end his acceptance o' samp ^ meant that Kuwait’s monay claims against Hejd in rcapact of AJchwan raids could bo washed out. •What,to* said, Bin Baud waa obviously thinking about, and wtoat be himself certainly understood by the proposal, was that the number of ’bad* toejd baaonin camel claims against Kuwaitis and vice versa had become so numerous of late that it was time some steps were t&amp;kcn to stop them*• (Vide Paragraphs 2 and 3 of Colonel Dicksoh’ sreply of 7th April which together with Sir fiugji Biscoe’s comaunioation were forwarded under my printed letter bo.3h t’-o. 625-... to Government of Indie and Jedda) dated the 6th September 1932) There the matter rested until raised toy His Majeaty'a . -i Mn l 6© of 25th August 193?. Minister, Jedda, in his telegram Jo.iov to the foreign Office (Bo. 227 to Bushire). 5 . With regard to the merits of the case as presente Jy the two parties - Iton Send and the Shaikh - there seems ndewbt whatever that the latter’s contention is correct, an that both parties intended the agreement to cowr only the minor claims indicated In Colonel Dickson’s I letter of the 7th April 1932* fhe Shaikh would never have accepted His Majesty* a proposal if it had been otherwise* Moreover, as Colonel Dickson point® out in paragraph 4 of his letter Mo*153 dated 9th September 1932 {copy forwarded to you under my printed letter bo*42 {Ho* 659-8 to the Oovermiient of India and Jedda),dated 13th S apte f -Per 1932), Ihn Sand coul - not &gt;ave known of the Shaikh’s Akhwan claims in January last when he made his proposal. In paragraph 3 of the same letter Colonel Dickson produces some further arguments based on the Arabic phraseology naedi for instance the expression •between our subjects and your subjects*, no mention being made as to the elates ms between the two Oovernments. This latter argument is slightly weakened by the fact that in the above statement {forwarded to you under fir Hugh Bisee®*® despatch Mo* 11, dated 13th Hay 1931 (copy to the Government of India and Jedda under printed letter Ko*267-B), Claim 1 (a) consists almost entirely of losses by Kuwait subjects in camels, sheep, etc, Revert holes, taking all the circumstances into account, I a® sure that any court,having regard particularly to the inAentj.pn__o f the parties concerned at the time of the claims, would give an award in favour of the Shaikh* 6, Unfortunately we are not dealing with an individual subject to a court of law, but with an independent sovereign. The fact that at the time oi the agreement Ibn Sand’s Intention® were the same a® the Shaikh’s will not presumably prevent the former from continuing to use his present interprat&amp;tlon,whicfc has sufficient plausibility for his purpose, as a trump card of considerable value. ByBy it not only will he probably avol i t or at least postpone, the meeting of the $ejdkKtawait Bloackade OoMi.ission, about which he appears to be less than lwk«»werm, on the grounds put forward by Fuad Hamza: “it is no use concluding further agreements if such agree:aents ere not respected; (Jeddm Saring telegram Ho* 11, paragraph 2 (Ho. 4 to Busshire) of 25th August), but he also my be able * at all event b to his own satisfaction - to refute entirely the Akhwan claims, which now * even as a bargaining counter * may cease to have much, if any, value. At least sisch. is my reading of the situation, *He whs sups with the devil must have a long spoon®, and I am afraid that His llxcellency is rm match for His Majesty* We can only, I suppose, put forward the Shaikh 1 8 reading of the agreement to Ibn Sand bb cogently as oseible. The Shaikh, however, though, he had ray sympathy, by his own action in not making his intentions clearer in his letter, and by his continuing to believe in the good faith of Ibn Baud even after being warned by Colonel Dickson, had sad# the task a difficult one* 7, With regard to the loans at the time of operation® against Hail, which Hi© Majesty*s Minister* Jedda, reports in his? telegram that His Majesty accepts, though contending they were a •gift 1 .

SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES, DOMING STREET .LONDON S. W.l. E?:cv No. ^38. 22.SER :31 FROM SECRETARY, TOLi l IOAL A«u SEC RET DEPT.A Note on the present position of Trade between Iraq and ^ajd. Trade between Iraq and Najd is restricted almost entirely to the sales and purchases of goods made by caravans sent into Iraq by the Najdi tribes. The tribes send into Iraq to sell fats, wool and other products of their camel herds and take away dates,rice, wheat barley, tea,sugar ,cloth and other manufactured articles. This trading is called musabilah. The Iraqi towns to which Najdi caravans chiefly resort are ZubairjNasariyahjSamawa and Najaf. Iraqi merchants do not send caravans of goods into Najd to trade. The restrictions which the Najdi Government imposes on Najdi caravans trading with Iraq have generally one or both of the following objects in view:- (i) to raise revenue by imposing a tax on caravans returning to Najd. This tax takes the place of the customs levied by more advanced administration. (ii) to punish a tribe. A tribe suffers much hardship if denied musabilah in Iraq. The formand degree of the restriction on control imposed by the Najdi Government on trade with Iraq varies from time to time and as the Iraqi Government are not informed of the orders issued by the Najdi Government in this regard it is always difficult to know precisely what the position is. The following is the latest information available but it should be noted that the present time is not thebusy musabilah season. This occurs in the Autumn after the new date crop is ripe. The Shsmmar and Dhafir from Najd are now it seems free to trade with Iraq but the Mrtair and Harb are forbidden musabilah with Iraq. Recently however in order to obtain Harb assistance against Ibn Rafada the ban on the Harb was apparently temporarily suspended. The Najdi Government impose a tax of 3 Najdi Riyals (about 3 rupees) on every loaded camel returning to Najd from Iraq. This is a heavy tax representing about 50% of the value of a camel load of barley, 30% of a load of wheat and 30% of a load of dates. Fixed routes have been laid down for caravan traffic with Iraq. Caravans trading with Zubair and Nasariyah have to use the route via Hafar, those resorting to Samawa and Najaf the route via Lina. It has been reported that several caravans which have endeavoured to evade these orders have been captured and their goods confiscated by Najdi frontier patrols.Decode, fair A. Hycn (Jedda). No.11.

There are many reasons for this* 2, Most important reasons are these* First intimation regarding claims is like a threat to enforce a settlement completely independent of question of commercial relations* Secondly their presentation shows clear disregard by Koweit of international agreements and it is no use concluding (further) agreements if such agreements are not respected.

Sir » I have the honour to invite a. reference to my despatch Bo. 15 oi the 23rd April, 1932, regarding the Kuwait 'blockade, and to forward herewith for the xnionnation of His Majesty’s Government an extrs,ct from ’Iraq Command, fortnightly Intelligence Summary Ho.9, for the fortnight ending 4th May 1932. 2. It will he seen that His Majesty King Ibn Saud has apparently permitted Hejdi caravans to visit ’Iraq for the purchase of supplies. When I discussed the question with King Ibn Saud I pointed out that he was allowing Hejdi caravans to go into ’Iraq and was presumably obtaining customs dues from them on their return and that therefore his prohibition of ©HI trade with Kuwa.it seemed to be wholly unjustified. If they could trade with ’Iraq why could they not trade with KKuwait, and if he could recover customs dues from caravans which had entered ’Iraq why could he not do so from caravans that entered Kuwait? His Majesty replied that he did not wish his people to trade with ’Iraq but wished all trade to come through his own and ports/that he proposed to stop it. It will be seen, however, that he is authorising trade with ’Iraq while maintaining the blockade against Kuwait, and that he proposes to levy customs dues on caravans returning from ’Iraq when they reach their destination in Hejd. This completely Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, hOITDQK . wwwi ». mi-mif he permitted trade with Kuwait it would 'be necessary to have a cordon along the frontier to collect customs dues. To any one acquainted with local conditions it is evident that this is largely a pretext for refusing to allow trade with Kuwait, since large caravans must follow well-defined routes in order to o'btain water and there is actually no difficulty in levying customs dues when they reach their destination in Hejd. 3. I would mention further that the Hejdi tribesmen and merchants, for a variety of reasons, much prefer purchasing their requirements in Kuwait to purchasing them in ’Iraq, firstly, they have long standing commercial connections with Kuwait, and the Kuwait merchants give them extensive credit. Secondly, the Hejd Mutair and Ajman have many relations among the Shaikh’s Araibdar, who are also Mutair and Ajman, and if they proceed to Kuwait can not only purchase goods hut also arrange marriages and see their relations etc. Thirdly, if a dispute arises between a Badi and a shopkeeper in Kuv/ait, the Badu can obtain immediate redress, as the Shaikh or one of his .near relatives sits daily in the bazar to settle disputes and administer justice in a rough and ready but paternal manner, This is not possible in ’Iraq, iinall^ , c. Kuwait merchant will sell to a Badu everything he requires - his dates, his rice, nis clothing, tent ropes, csmel gear, etc,, etc,, but at ZuDc^r he has to get foodstuffs from onesSiop, clotiling from another, ropes from a third, end so on - ooviously a more troublesome arrangement• Many Ox Uo prefei to no our shopping in London at a large store such as Harrods than to wander about from one shop to another.4. I have thought it desirable to bring these facts to notice since, when the question oi the Kuwait blocicade is discussed with the hejd—Hejaz Government, as I hope it will be shortly, they will form, 1 think, a useful answer to the grounds that King Ibn Saud always gives for his action, and His majesty’s Government can I think legitimately complain at the differentiation made between trade with Kuwait and trade with ’Iraq.

Political gent, Kuwaitcopy liQtjsB on ^xcelleacy Shaikh Alxa^ad 1 a l^rlp to vlath. I. His Excellency the Ehaiich returned to Kuwait on 3rd April, 193E, having been delayed a day at A! K'hafs by the King who insisted on keeping him back an extra £4 hours there. 11. Ignorant of this change of plan the political ; \gent and leading citizens of Kuwait proceeded on End April, ’SE,to Khabrat al Duwish 57 miles out, to meet the Shaikh and party. is he failed to arrive the Political gent and the others again went out to a point 22 Ed lee from Kuwait on 3rd April, 193£, (Ohawaibidah). This meeting of their r hiler is an old custom and highly valued by both Ruler and people of Kuwait. III. The following are the sain points of interest connected with the Shaikh*s entry into the city. (a) The Shaikh and party arrived there at 3.30 p.sn in 15 ears. Ten being thoae his party took to Riath and the remaining five being new ones presented by Bin Saud. (b) The Shaikh halted i hour for coffee and to get tidied up preparatory to making his official entry into the city* (c) This entry was made at 5 p.m. a total of some 40 cars taking part in the procession. (d) The Shaikh led the procession in a large n Cadillao M 8 cylinder saloon oar presented to Bin Saud by Mr. Crane the American, find which formed the principal present of the King to Shaikh* (e)(a) Shaikh insisted on th@ Political Agent sitting on his right hand during entry. (f) Wonderful scenes of rejoicing were met with, and route from Sahara Gate to Town Palace was lined with thousands of cheering crowds. In particular large numbers of women were in evidence both in the streets and lining house-tops, and their ululatione and singing were a feature. At intervals swordsmen dancing before the ears to the accompaniment of drum beating etc., etc. (g) The Kuler ma«e his way to his Great Mijlls hall on the sea front and there halted and held a reception at which the whole city see reed to be present. This lasted till nightfall when the Shaikh was able to get away and see his own family at 'Dasman* Palace. (h) Kuwait has apparently rarely seen such wonderful scenes of rejoicing, ana the welcome the people gave their Ruler was significant as well as touching. 17. On 4th ,.pril, 1932, the Shaikh came and saw the Political Agent and recounted his experiences which were as follows:- (a) The outward journey exactly 462 miles by mileo- meter, and made in 23 hours of actual driving, was via Manaqlsh, Phabrat al Buwieh, Khabari 'aatha, Jarriya Ilya, Thalaat Turaibi to Kanhara (immediately east of the Bhana on Sad Her 1 s 1619 route). From there cars turned sharp west and proceeded to Ruma and Humhiyeh. From there again oars followed rout© Shaib Hamayim, to Hamama, Thaeaama, through Bawabiyat, a ireet to Hiath leaving Banban about 7 miles to west. (Return(Return journey was the same except that party were taken to 41 Khafa by the King who spent a days in camp there with them. From A1 Khafs the cars went up Shaib al i’auki till they reached Rumhiyeh* ) kiis whole road was hard and gravelly going, except when Dhana was crossed. This strip ms sandy and very trying on cars. Tyres had not to be deflated, however, but Shaikh remarked that any cars travelling by this route in future should have 5 passengers, excluding driver, as frequently cars stuck and only 5 persons could get cars out of sand. x^ooi Rumahlyeh to Riath road was terribly ©tony, with many boulders everywhere. At Bawabiyat, was perhaps worst portion of whole road, as here track wound down a steep spur with precipices on one side, and a single mistake meant that a oar would go over the edge and be dashed to bits in th© gorge below. The return detour via khafs though a trifle longer, was easier# (b) Bhaikh said that he surprised the King at Riath as he was going out to Al khafs to pitch camp for him. The meeting was most cordial and affectionate, and was folio ed by 8 days of royal entertainment in the Capital with E days in the camp at Al Khafs. (c) Shaikh saw all members of the Al Baud family, including ,,mir Baud (son), 1'©homed (brother), Abdullah (brother), Jbn Muaaad Governor of Hail (cousin) and the leading members of the Ibn Rasohid family of Hail, including Kohomed bln Tallal the Kx Amir of Jebel Shasmar. !I(d) Apparently Shaikh’a speech on arrival effect that he was not like other Arabs t who usually come to beg for money or a gift* His sole object was to see his old friend and brother&gt; and to remove wrong impressions that the newspapers and other interested parties were trying to convey, namely that he Shaikh Ahmad was trying to form a confederacy of Arab Bui or® of the Gulf, more or less in opposition to him the King* He added that Bin Saud was his elder brother and as such it was his (Ahmad’s) duty to come and sea him from time to time* H© wished Bin Saud to clearly understand from the beginning that he desired no form of favour or present from him aor would he accept any, but that if he would like to give his servants the customary largesse, that of course was not his concern. (e) According to Shaikh, Bin Saud who literally wept copious tears on their arrival, in reply to this preliminary speech, swore that Kuwait was the loveliest spot in the whole universe, its Ruler his dearost friend, and its women the most fair. fhat his love for the house of Subah was eternal and that just as the A1 baud and A1 Subah standards had flown side by side in every victory or defeat, during the last 3GO years, so he prayed and believed it would continue to so fly in future. fhis and very much more In the same strain was said according to the Shaikh, and Bin Saud surpassed all expectations in the way he went out of his way to make his guests feel comfortable and happy.V. The following were the principal subjects of conyereation that took laeo between himself and Bin Saud (according to the Shaikh):- (a) Bin Saud in general talk on world politics expressed great fear of the Turks and Persians. He said he could manage Europeans easily but he believed a European war was again coming, in which case the v'— - Turks would find a way of returning to Iraq, and Persia would endeavour to seise Bahrain .and Baasa* The Turks and Persians were far away the worst Moslems in the world, and also far more cunning in their j methods than any 'European power. Hence he feared \ them. (b# thought a great deal of king Faisal whom he liked for hia honourable and straight dealings. Abdullahof Trans-Jordan on the other hand he thought was a poisonous intriguer who ms responsible for all the propaganda that was going on against him in Hejaz, Hejd, Iraq and the Persian Gulf. It was a pity he could not rest, and let the past be. He feared Abdullah would not be happy till he raised another rebellion against him (by this he meant said the Shaikh, that Abdullah was responsible for the -Jchwan rebellion of 19E9/30). (c) Bin Saud told him that he Intended shortly sending Amir Faisal his second son on a tour of the ’ European capitals in the same way as the Emperor of Abyssinia had done. Fuad Hamza would go with him and this Secretary fouaif Y&amp;ain would in their absence be in charge of hia Foreign Office. (d) Mr. xhilby would return to Mecca on or about 5th April from his Huba al Khali tour. He had alreadyalready sent back certain stones and objects of interest to Ri&amp;th to be forwarded to him In Mecca. (e) The King did not press the Shaikh to go to Haj this year but promised that next spring {1933} he would come up to Kuwait for a few weeks and then would take Shaikh Ahmad to the Haj, making first a tour of Hlath, Qasim and Hail. From the latter place he would go to Medina and then lastly to Mecca. This plan he had worked out and would follow to the letter. (f) The Shaikh asked if he Bln Baud had really borrowed £500,000 from the English. But his host did not give him a 'yea” or ff nay% but contented himself by saying that he was trying to gat a loan and that Egyptian and Iraq newspapers would stupidly attach ridiculous conditions and terms to any efforts of his to raise such loan. (g) The Shaikh warned him again and again to go slow in the matter of expenditure, and said that in the way he was going he would most assuredly 'crash'. The Shaikh said that he particularly talked 'straight' in the matter of the obvious waste that he saw all round him where motor oars were concerned. He urged Bin Baud reduce hi a numbers of cars by 3/4, arid standardise by concentrating on Fords or Ohevrolets. For himself as King a few good luxury oars were perhaps necessary, but he must stop the ridiculous expenditure on every form and variety of expensive cars which he saw round him. In this connection the Shaikh said that it made his 'stomach pain and his heart sore' to see the number of cars obviously new and expensive, that after doing only 5000 Kilometers, were discardeddiscarded as scrap Iron* Ignorant Bedouin drirers, were of course responsible and lack of proper supervision. The Amir Baud for instance had BO ears to himse .1 f, and Cod knew how many Ibn l naaad arid the Amir Faisal possessed. ■ ■• 1 .ecord lag to the uhaikh, h© strongly advised the King to appoint a good Englishman in place of the rascally Indian * , S&amp;diq f&lt; to be in the sol© charge of all his mechanical transport, together with h a doaen honest British mechanics (ex soldiers) who would be under him. The Englishman of course to have extensive power© for fines, dismissal etc., etc. The King did not seem to relish the suggestions, (h] The Shaikh asked if he had had the country round Hiath and A1 Khafa examined by geologist© as they looked very likely places for oil. The ling said ye®, but that he was not anxious in the least to grant concessions to foreigners. (1) Whilst in Hiath, a convoy arrived bearing machinery and gear for a 400 G mile radius new wireless set. This was to be set up in Hiath. (j) The Shaikh said he asked Bin Saud what would be his policy when the English withdrew from Iraq altogether. Bin Saud replied, obviously in joke, said the Shaikh, that he would not be slow to take advantage of such situation, as Iraq was a good country. (k) On the subject of the Kuwait blockade Bin Saud 19 ^ kept complete silence and Shaikh Ahmad said It would have been un ignifled for him to open the question or make any mention of a matter which might convey the impressioniiupresaloa that he cause as a suppliant. Bin Saud did however mention that he knew hia frontier of 1 ioars were mostly bad and were nearly always responsible for misunderstandings that took place, liis frontier patrols also looted and stole helpless people's goods, not for himself. Bin Baud, but for themselves- He lamented the fact that he was i surrounded by many of the biggest rascals on earth I &amp;ut what could he do running the r *show n alone as he was doing. ;is regards his official Ibn Khr&amp;imie on the Kuwait frontier* he urged Shaikh to treat him a© his own official ano order hie every going and coming (a typical Saudian move). (1) The King asked after the Hon * ble the lolitlcal Resident in Bushire and Colonel Dickson and family and expressed great pleasure at having met them in Hassa recently. VI. The following are some of the impressions left on the Shaikh 1 s mind, as a result of his visit;- (a) Bin Saud 1 © position was unassailable ao long aa h© remained alive- The whole laboriously built A system would however most assuredly topple and l collapse as soon as the King died. Bln Saud still inspired wholesome fear wherever he went and this was especially evident at Kiath the heart of his Government. He was still a very great man and leader but in his opinion (the Shaikh 1 ©) the whole of the king 1 © system was more than ever a on© man show. (b) Bin Saud was on the other hand a definitely sick and unfit man. Gone were the days when he was the hardest man in his kingdom and led every raid and foray. Shaikh IhmadShaikh ihcaad opined that this was because he never took any exercise these days at all and eat far too much. On one occasion he Bin Baud took the Shaikh to his old capital of Iharaiyeh and both got out to walk. after a hundred yards or so-the King began to pant and blow, and said he could not go on. This gave the Shaikh the opportunity of giving him a lecture, and ha urged on him the vital necessity of taking at least i hour’s walk each day, and begged him to stop taking drugs such as 'cascara” etc. which apparently the King now cannot do without. (o) The King, said the Shaikh, eat far too much to be good for him, and alone sitting could put away a whole lamb himself* (d} The Amir Baud was a fin© upstanding young man as tall as his father and with lots of character, but at the *break up” which would assuredly follow the King’s death, the Shaikh much doubted if Baud would be able to ’'make good”. There were the ambitious Mohomed and Abdullah and a host of others, who all even now hated and ware jealous of one another, to be reckoned with. All would be at each other’s throats when the strong hand left them. The Shaikh was particularly taken with Baud’s charms of manner and was overwhelmed altogether when the latter called and after paying his respects, said ”1 want you to treat me firstly as your best friend, and sec on j ly ss your son, and thirP ly as yuur servant, not only during your visit here, but throughout the rest of our respective 1ives ' * ierhap® the Amir Baud saw the day not far distant when he would want an ally on the coast. (e){e, ; The Amir ibn 1 usaad. had aged ve ry greatly# He was onl^ 40 years old* but the Shaikh who knew him in less peaceful times when they both used to go on raids together, said ho was shocked to see what a great change had com® oyer him# He was obviously being killed by worry and the cares of his high office. (f) The Town of Riath was indiseribably filthy, and except for the group of rather fine houses inhabited by the King and. his family which all communicated by means of upstair passage®, was like a rabbit warren. Flies were dreadful and smells and refuse in painful evidence. The Shaikh said he again and again urged the king to build outside the city, for health reasons and encourage the members of hi® family to do likewise* (j) Splendid rains fell during his sojourn in Riath and the whole country south and west of the Dahana was green and dotted with wild flowers. A contrast to the state of affairs north of the Dahana and round Kuwait. (Signed) H.R#P.Dickson. Iieut.Colonel. #Paper ?.Z.2946/32 Department t \ j7 Please see the previous submission at P.Z.1766. ihe present papers mainly amplify previous information and the proposals of the Colonial Office are^more ^ detailed Version of a policy in which we have already concurred. Attention is invited to pp. 20-2^ demi- official letter from Colonel Biscoe to the Colonial Office, suggesting that the Shaikh of Koweit is losing some of his faith in us and turning back to Ibn Saud who recently gave him a very friendly reception at ■ Hiadh. He is sceptical of the results of the appoint ment of commissioners - as also is Colonel Biscoe - ( and inclined to think that we are shirking the fulfilment of our promise to him in 1929 by not bringing stronger pressure to bear on Ibn Saud to accept some such system as that of 'manifests :i originally suggested by him. Colonel Bi scoe favours proceeding wi th the appointment of commissioners and,,in the event of failure the making of direct representations to Ibn Saud such as the Shaikh would apparently desire. 2. The Colonial Office proposals may be accepted without question, save in one important respect. I read Colonel Biscoe 1 s scheme as intending the increase A of the Koweit customs by an agreed percentage of which a proportion would be paid to Ibn Saud, or any other arrangement , including the ,T manifest rT system, at which the commissioners, who will be mainly businessmen, should actually give the Koweiti representatives a lead as to the proposals which they are to make; (2) that arrive. But I am not sure (1) that Colonel Bisco£ intended or that it ?/ould be advisable that inin any case Colonel Biscoe envisaged the possibility ^ {&gt;) ^ X) of a combined system of^ !r manif ests 7 ao ^ the handing over of a proportion of the Koweit customs to Ibn Saud, which is y/hat the Colonial Of], ice proposal amounts to. It is not clear why Ibn Saud should be entitled to collect dues on his own frontier if he is to receive a share of the enhanced iCoweit customs as well, and also put the Sheikh to the trouble and expense of arranging for the r manifests 7 . fhe three Colonial Office arguments in favour of their suggestion seem valueless. (i) The receipt of a share of the Koweit customs, taken by itself, obviates the need of customs posts; it would be absurd to spend the money received from the former on the upkeep of the latter, which is what the Colonial Office seem to suggest. (ii) The King would have this incentive in any case. (iii) The Koweit customs would benefit in any case; but if a double duty were imposed, there wwould be a danger of trade being strangled and both parties losing their revenue. Finally, since Ibn Saud has little use for the 7T manifest 77 syste^, it cannot even be said that to combine this with the revenue-proportion scheme would be to enhance the attraction of the bait. 3. A draft to the Colonial Office is therefore submitted suggesting that it would be best that no lead be given to the Koweiti commissioners, whoshoulu be lef to come to any arrangement acceptable to them; but taut in any case there seems no justification for the double-decked scheme suggested by the Colonial Office. A/vu. jC CO irf- o«Jl tu *7 ' “ns yir •&gt; ffH * Pal CI instance, as the increas/t; of the K owe it customs duties fi/nd the payment / of a proportion of the/receipts to Ibn Saud. 4. Should, however, Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister be arJxious to give Colonel Biscoe more definite instructions, Sir Sanuel Hoare would consider it sufficient that the Koweit customs duties should be increased by an agreed percentage and that an increased proportion of these receipts should be paid over to the King. He sees no reason why Ibn Saud should be allowed to his own frontier if he is to receive collect dues on t customs as well to regard the as an alternative share of the Kowei he would prefer system of manifests to that of the receipt of a percentage of the Kjoweit customs. The imposition of J double duty on Hejd might well strangling the depriving both goods destined for have the Sffect of trade and thereby Koweit and Nejd of] a source of revenue. / A copy of this letter is being sent to the Foreign Office.

Subject to the concurrence of the Secretary f State for India and the Secretary of State for ^ Foreign Affairs, Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister would iLOSURE IN WtEKl-VsJggWsTr tfiat the question should now be taken up ( ^ 2 ] 26MAY, 1932 SECRETARY, POLITICAL AND l COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL withwith, the Hejaz-hejd Government through His Majesty T s Legation at Jedda in the following manner. King Ibn Saud should be informed that His Majesty 1 s Government have received a report from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf upon his recent visit to the King at which the question of the Kuwait blockade was one of the questions discussed. King Ibn Saud will recollect that at first he expressed the opinion that there ?/ere three ways in which the matter could be settled, viz:- r (1) He should be allowed to establish a post at some place on the outskirts of Kuwait territory where he would take his customs, Kuwait to guarantee that r all goods should pass through this place. (2) A Nejd customs post in the hands of a Hejdi official should be established at the gate of Kuv^ait town to collect the Nejd dues as caravans passed out* ( 3 ) Kuwait should make a fixed annual payment representing the Nejd share of the Kuwait customs. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin subsequently stated that the King realised that the first two suggestions were irnpr ac tic ableimpracticable, and the Sheikh oi Kuwait, who has been consulted, has stated that he cannot see his way to accept the third. King Ibn Sand, however, himself intimated to Colonel Biscoe as the result of their discussion that the only solution he could see was for 'arbitrators' from either side, consisting of well- known merchants and possibly one official, to meet and try to work out a compromise which would be acceptable to both parties. The Sheikh of Kuwait accepts this proposal and His Majesty’s Government trust that in the interests of co-operation and friendly relations between the Hej&amp;z-Nejd and Kuwait, King Ibn Saud will nov/ agree to the appointment of such a Commission. If so, they will be glad to know whom the King would propose toappoint as his representatives. The Sheikh of Kuwait for his part Y/ould be agreeable to appoint as the Kuwaiti representatives two merchants and one official (preferably a customs official). 3. If such a Commission is appointed. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Iister Y/ould propose to inform Colonel Biscoe that His Majesty 1 s Government see no objections objection to the Kuwaiti representatives putting forward a proposal on the lines suggested in paragraph 11 of the Political Resident T s despatch ho. 3 of the 5th of February. Colonel Biscoe does not enter into any details of the scheme which he proposes, but, reading the Residents proposals in the light of the observa tions made in his telegram- of the 13th of March and the connected correspondence, Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister envisages a scheme somewhat on the following lines. r The Kuwait customs would be increased by an agreed percentage and an agreed proportion of these receipts would be paid over to the King. The King would at the time establish frontier posts at the wells where he . arrange to collect his own customs dues on the entry of goods into Nejd, and the Sheikh of Kuwait would institute a system of manifests which would enable a check to be kept upon the goods passing through the posts. The ming would thus have two separate sources of revenue, firstly a percentage of the Kuwait customs and secondly the money derived from his own customs. ! The scheme would appear to have several advantages. First,First , the King has said that he cannot afford to establish and maintain customs posts on the frontier as he has no money. If he were to receive a percentage of the Kuwait customs in addition to his own customs dues, the money thus provided would be available for this purpose, and the financial objec tion would be met. S econdl y, there would be a definite inducement to the King to encourage trade through Kuwait, as his receipts both from the Kuwait customs and from his own customs would increase in proportion to the increase of trade. Thirdly, a —-—r system of this sort should benefit Kuwait inasmuch as the Kuwait customs receipts would increase as a result of the greater volume of trade. It may be objected that the payment of a percentage of the Kuwait customs would, in effect, be a payment for the purpose of buying off the blockade. Nevertheless, it would not be a fixed annual payment, which would have the appearance of Tt tribute Tr , and to which the Sheikh would be strongly opposed, but would vary from year to year according to the volume of trade,s trade, and it should be possible, thereiore, lor the Sheihh to accept the arrangement without loss of prestige. 4. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister would also suggest that His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda should be instructed to advise the Hejaz-Nejd Government at a suitable opportunity iniormally of the existence ox the claims put forward by the Sheikh of Kuwait against King Ibn Saud. Such a communication might be made on the lines proposed by Colonel Biscoe in the latter part of paragraph 11 his despatch of the 5th of February. The claims in question are those referred to in paragraph 4 of Colonel Biscoe 1 s des patch No. 11 of the 15th of May, 1931, a copy of which (with its enclosures) was sent to the India Office and Foreign Office on the 13th of June, 1931. 5.

Sir I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram No. 2 of 22nd the information of His Majesty^ Government a copy of a letter received from the Political Agent, Kuwait, enclosing a translation of a letter from the Shaikh of Kuwait agreeing to the proposal that commissioners should he appointed to discuss the question of the blockade, 2. It will be seen that the Shaikh^s consent is a very reluctant one and that he frankly expresses the view that little will come of the proposal to appoint commissioners. further, he states that he v/ill never agree to the three alternatives which Ibn Baud originally suggested, 3. As regards the view expressed by the Shaikh, that the appointment of commissioners is unlikely to produce a solution of the difficulty, I cannot but think that despite this the proposal should be proceeded with. Even if the commissioners arrive at no satisfactory settlement, Ibn Baud will be made aware of the fact that His Majesty*s Government are interesting themselves in the question of the Kuwait blockade, and, if I may say so, I think it is incumbent upon them, in view of the promise made to the Shaikh at the time of the Akhwan April regarding the Kuwait blockade, and to forward for rebellion, s Majesty*s Secretary of State for 4 the Colonies, Colonial Office, London. Arebellion, to take some steps in the matter, Further, if the commissioners can arrive at no settlement, then, I submit, His Majesty’s Government would be in a very strong position to urge Ibn Saud to agree to the manifest system suggested by the Shaikh, since all other alternatives will have failed, Ibn Saud has never given any very valid reason for objecting to this system, and I think in the last resort it should be pressed upon him, 4, As regards the three alternatives to which the Shaikh objects, as pointed out in my telegram referred to above, I do not think there ought to be any difficulty about excluding these, Ibn Saud himself admitted that the first two were impracticable and I told Yusuf Yasin that the Shaikh would never agree to the third, and Ibn Saud himself knows perfectly well that it would bear in Arab eyes the appearance of a, tribute, I trust, therefore, that His Majesty’s Government will see fit to instruct His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda to take up the matter with the Hejaz-Eejd Government, I am sending a copy of this Despatch to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s Minister at CT edda • I have, etc,, (Sgd•) H,Y. Biscoe. Lt.Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,nmaf idential Political Agency, Kuwait* Dated the 14th April, 1932* Ho. 52. From Lieutenant-Colonel H.R.P* Dickson, C.IJB., Political Agent, Kuwait* To The Hon*hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire Kuwait Blockade and proposal to appoint Commissioners from hoth sides* Sir With reference to my telegram ITo. 36, dated the 16th March 1932, I have the honour to report that the return of His Excellency the Shaikh from Riath on 3rd April I took the first opportunity to call on him and explain the gist of your Confidential D,0*Ho*C*20, dated the 10th March to me* to him, translation of which together with his reply which I fear is not as satisfactory as it might be, I forward as enclosures to this letter* My letter as you will see merely recapitulated previous events and included a formal request that the Shaikn shouio. give me in writing what he had previously agreed to verbally • 2* You will observe that in his letter His Excellency agrees to the proposal that 3 commissioners from either side should be appointed, but he makes it clear that he has very little faith in any such discussions bearing fruit* I then proceeded to write an official letter3. His Excellency, also in spite of the fact that, I was particularly careful to tell him in the course of conversation, hoth on my return from Hasa and again on receipt of your D.O, Bo*0.20 dated the 10th March, that Ihn Saud had himself admitted to you the impracticability of having (a) a Customs official of his own in Kuwait City, and (b) a single Customs Post on the frontier with a Kuwait guarantee that all exported goods should pass through it; nevertheless in his present letter he reiterates that he can never agree to either of such proposals, nor can he agree to a third one viz* a fixed sum of money being made over by him to Ibn Saud, in order to 'buy off the Blockade' to use his expression* 4. In answer to a question put by me to the Shaikh at an interview subsequent to the receipt of his letter, as to why he had introduced all three conditions into his letter, knowing that two of them no longer held good, the Shaikh replied, that he had done sc to make his view point quite clear, to His Majesty’s Government knowing that his letter would probably be sent on to London. He also said that he did not believe that Ibn Saud was sincere when he talked about dropping two of the conditions* Ibn Saud he said had always in the past offered to raise the blockade if he, the Shaikh, would agree to any single one of the three conditions. If therefore Ibn Saud was prepared to withdraw two of them, it meant that he would still adhere to the third as a condition of raising the blockade, namely that a lump sum be annually handed over to him* 5. His Excellency hinted indeed that the last condition,condition, namely the payment of a lump sum was the most difficult fulfilment of all, as the Arah world would look upon it as a 'tribute' or 'Jezzia' Tax and would definitely place him in the position of a 'vassal', The arrangement would no doubt be most acceptable to Ibn Saud, and would quite understand the real meaning and significance, of such an act. 6. The Shaikh* s attitude I regret to say has all a^ong been,, and still is, that it is up to His Majesty's Government as his protecting power not to leave him to fight his own battles, but to come to his assistance, and implement their promises made during the Akhwan rebellion. Hence the last paragraph of his letter. His argument is that His Majesty's Government knows quite well that Kuwait is weak, and consequently should be able to understand that any negotiations entered into by himself direct with his big neighbour must either prove abortive, or end in his surrendering a vital part of his independence. On the other hand he maintains that if His Majesty's Government really were willing to bring even a small amount of diplomatic pressure to bear on Ibn Saud, which he is forced to believe they are apparently loath to do, the latter would at once react, for although outwardly a King, Ibn Saud was in reality a rough Benouin at heart, and would at once appreciate the necessity for yielding to His Majesty's Government's wishes • 7. This attitude of the Shaikh is clearly reflected in his letter to me under reference, and which if examined carefully, follows the line of argument propounded by him at his interview with me on 17th February 1932 and whichwhich was reported in my Confidential D.0.Ifo*17, dated the 17th February last* 8* To sum up it would appear that His Excellency the Shaikh from his letter is definitely against the ” three coInmissioners ,, idea, even though he agrees to give the proposal a trial, out of regard for yourself and His Majesty's Government. Whether you will think this justifies proceeding further with the matter, I do not know hut in any case X shall await your further instructions. I have, etc., (Sgd.) H.H.P.

After compliments, Reference the recent conversation which I had % with Your Excellency on Monday 4th April. 2. Your Excellency will recollect that on 12th February last the Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf wrote and told me to explain to Your Excellency that during his visit to H.K. King Ibn Sa*ud in Hasa the latter agreed after considerable pressure to the appointment of three commissioners who would discuss the Kuwait blockade matters with a similar number of Kuwait representatives, and more or less accepted the position that if some arrangement could be arrived at by which trade with Kuwait would not involve him in any pecuniary loss, he woulh be prepared to consider favourably the discontinuance of the blockade, 3. In his letter the Hobble the Political Resident was disposed to think that the plan proposed by Ibn Saud was one that at any rate offered some prospect of success, and was worthy of Your Excellency^ Yei*y serious consideration. He also gave it as his opinion that it was desirable to exclude as far as possible state officials, in order that the discussions should be kept as far as possible on a business footing. For this reason he said he personally would like to see thethe commissioners consist of two leading merchants, and one official only, preferably a customs official. 4. Colonel Biscoe lastly asked me to ascertain Your Excellency*s views on the matter, and trusted that Your Excellency would agree to the proposal. 5. You will recollect that I informed Your Excellency of the contents of Colonel Biscoe*s above letter and discussed the whole matter with Your Excellency on 17th February last, and Your Excellency was good enough to convey your approval to the proposal, namely that three 11 Commissi oners'* from either side should assemble att a place to be agreed upon and attempt to solve the Blockade Problem in a way that would be satisfactory to the honour and dignity of both sides. 6. Your Excellency at the time made certain remaiks and reservations, which were all faithfully reported by me to Colonel Biscoe, and you expressed the opinion among other things that although you did not entirely believe that the commissioners would be able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, nevertheless out of regard for the wishes of the Hon*ble the Political Resident, and in order that Ibn Saud should not be given a handle to say later that it was not he but the Shaikh of Kuwait who had created difficulties, you said you were willing to agree* 7 • The above conversation was duly reported to the Hon’ble the Political Resident on 17th February last. 8. The latter has now written to me in a letter dated 10th March (which letter reached me the day after Your Excellency proceeded to Riyadh), and has asked meto obtain from Your Excellency a formal letter intimating On receipt of this letter from Your Excellency, Colonel Biscoe states he will immediately taice up the matter with Ibn Saud through His Majesty^ Government, who in the meantime have doubtless asked for a similar letter from the King* 9. Colonel Biscoe lastly instructed me to ask Your Excellency whether you were in favour of the two merchants and one customs official forming the commission, or whether you would prefer a different arrangement. 10* X would request Your Excellency to be so good as to favour me with an early reply, in order that I can forward Your Excellency 1 s letter to Bushire by next down mail * Your Excellency's acceptance of the aforesaid proposal Usual Ending*Translation of a confidential letter * From - K*E.

With the hand of pleasure I have received your confidential letter Ho. 51 dated the 2nd inst. and understood what has been proposed by the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, with regard to the discussions which he had with His Majesty King Ibn Saud during the former’s visit to His Majesty at Hasa, regarding the question of the Kuwait blockade, and how that the latter agreed after considerable pressure to the appointment of three commissioners from either side in order to discuss the matter, and that the Hon’ble the Political Resident is of the opinion that it is desirable to exclude state officials in order that the discussions should be kept on a business xooting, and w6uld like to see the commissioners consist of two leading merchants and a third person who should be a customs official; all this I have noted, even to the end of your statement. From my whole heart, X thank the Hon’ble the Political Resident for his efforts and kind thoughtful ness, and I have already informed you verbally that I approved of his proposal, even though I have extremely little hope of its being able to solve the blockade problem, and feel sure that no result will be arrived atat through the discussions of the commissioners, except failure, and the providing of newspaper editors with an opportunity to gossip. His Majesty King Ih n Baud would assuredly Have agreed to establish customs posts at the principal strategic points along his frontier, (line of wells) Had he really desired to settle the question of the ’ blockade, in whichcase we, as always, would have been prepared to help him to control and check the goods exported by his subjects, by forwarding manifests for everything, whether big or small. But you were informs; by His Majesty (ibn Baud) that he would never agree to the establishment of such customs posts, because this would involve him in great expenditure. nevertheless, we, in compliance with the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf«s wishes, do accept and agree to the appointment of the said commission of two leading merchants, the third being either a customs official, or somebody else, even though no benefit will result from their discussions. As regards the ever steady demands of His Majesty King Ihn Baud, namely (1) the appointment of a customs official by him in Kuwait, ( 2 ) the payment of a fixed sum of money, and (3) the establishment of a single customs post on the frontier, with a guarantee from us that all exports should pass through it (tunnel system); it is absolutely impossible for us to agree to such demands, and it is for this reason that I do not see any possibility of the commissioners being able to solve the Blockade Problem* You will no doubt recollect that during the activities of the Nejd rebels (Akhwan rebellion of 1929. 30), I pointed out to the Hobble the Political Residentimmense losses which Kuwait has suffered (as a result oj. the blockade), and that he promised that His Majesty*s Government would endeavour as far as lay in their power, to remove the difficulties (get the blockade raised), and open a way which would lead to the well-being and prosperity of Kuwait. But it is to our great regret that we have not seen anything yet We still, however, retain every hope that we shall not be deproved of the benevolence and kind favours of His Majesty*s G-o'vernzasn't# Usual Ending,Confidential . D.O.N0.242-0 of 1932 My dear Parkinson, I am sending you by this mai 1 a despatch regarding the Kuwait blockade, in which I have urged that the matter should be taken up at Jedda. In this demi- official letter I nropose to put before you certain general asoects of the matter, of which I think you should be made aware. I am inclined to think that the Shaikh of Kuwait nowadays is to some slight extent losing faith in us. Up to the present he has been conspicuously loyal in his attitude and has gone out of his way in many minor matters to make his friendship with the British plain to his subjects. He realises that he is surrounded by two powerful neighbours and has pinned his faith to the British to support him and to stand up for his interests. While I think he still considers that his best hopes of salvation lie in us I am not at all sure that he does not now think it desirable to effect a re-insurance policy by cultivating closer relations with Ibn Baud and abandoning all causes of friction. The following considerations must be borne in mind. Firstly, the Shaikh undoubtedly hears a good deal of anti-British propaganda current in the bazaars of Kuwait and r Iraq. The views expressed may be summed un as being to the effect that the British are 'on the run' I S G.C. PARKINSON, ESQ., Q.i.O. ,O.B.E., Colonial Office, London.and that democracy cannot rule an Empire, etc. He has before him the fate of his close friend, the Shaikh of mohaniaierah. He is sore about the Ojair agreement where he considers that we sacrificed Kuwait interests for our own ends. He said to Gox at the time !, then it is still the strong man armed who wins the day despite the talk about the rights of small people” and Cox had to admit that it was so. In his eyes we seem to be trying to evade the fulfilment of the undertaking definitely given to him in uhe bar that the Kuwait date gardens would always be exempt from taxation. As far as he is aware we have done nothing to try and implement the promise made to him over two years ago to take up the question of the Kuwait blockade. He sees that our attitude towards the p ersians is very different from what it was formerly. He has recently paid a visit to Riadh where he has received the 'warmest welcome from Ibn Saud, and returned loaded with gifts. Havirgregard to all these circumstances, it cannot be wondered at, I think, if at times certain doubts ^ | regarding our intentions cross his mind, and if, with al^k. these numerous examples of f hope deferred ! before him, he does not sometimes Y/onder whether he would not be well advised not to offend his powerful neighbour. How it may of course be argued that we hold Kuwait in the hollow of our hand and can impose our will there any time we choose, and that it is a matter of indifference to us what the personal feelings and inclinations of the Ruler may be. This, I think, is an extremely narrow view. Firstly, to honour onefs pledges redounds to one T s credit. Steps to this end taken openly and publicly and especially in the case of a small State where{' S ' $ where we cannot he accused of having been actuated primarily by self interest enhance our prestige. They are the subject of open and favourable comment in the Arab world and after all that people should think that our promises are not lightly given and when given are fulfilled is a very valuable asset in this y/orld. becondly, during tne war we did much to obtain the friendship of even verv small men, and as we nowadays more than ever seem to have reverted to the policy of trying to hold the British Empire with the proverbial corporal’s guard we may yet in some future crisis find the friendship of small men of value again. For these reasons 1 do consider it desirable that we should now make some definite effort to implement the promise made to the Shaikh about the blockade more than two years ago. I am not very hopeful about the commissioners myself, but it will show Ibn Saud that we intend to do something, and if they fail to arrive at some arrangement, I think, we shall be then in a very strong position to say frankly to Ibn Saud that we vie this blockade as an unfriendly act: that every effort been made without success to effect a settlement by the means suggested by him and that there seems nothing now for it but to adopt the manifest system suggested by the Shaikh of Kuwait. These things take sometime to arrange, out if the commissioners could meet during the summer or very early in the autumn, and if they then fail, it is probable that I could arrange to meet Ibn Saud at Hasa again next winter, and if His Majesty’s Government agrees I should be quite prepared to have a tussle with him on this subject.

The oheikh of Koweit has now agreed - somewhat sceptically - to the appointment of Commissioners, though he still hankers after the frontier-post system which he suggested in 1929 (P.6357/29 - flagged on file below)and which commended itself to the then Hesident*and the Government of India (P.8146/29)5 though the Colonial Office favoured a different solution (§ 4-5 of their letter of 4/10/29 - P.6357/29). It would seem best to support Colonel Biscoe^ recommendations, and assuming that the Sheikh is still willing to waive his claim for compensation (P.3751/31), provided that a friendly settlement of the blockade question can be reached, to use the claim as a lever in the negotiations as suggested by Col. Biscoe. The immediate settlement is probably so important to him that he is prepared to let the faint chance of securing both desiderata go There seems no need to consult the Government of India. We shall probably hear separately about the other subjects discussed by Colonel Biscoe and Ibn Saud and mentioned in Yusuf Yasin 1 s letter. We have practically no information about the passport questions : see however the note at P.4353/30.Seen (Sd.) G.E.Shepherd, 26/3. i 1 .* J.1645/32. The I feel some doubt whether the 'debt lever' /T move will not be somewhat transparent. It seems possible that Ibn Saud will not be impressed. Moreover relations between the Legation at Jedda and the Palace are so bad at present that it may be difficult to get the arrangements for setting up the Commission etc. going. But the present proposal regarding the debt squares with the conclusion of the Interdepartmental meeting which Sir A.Hyan attended on P.Z.5773/31 (page 13), and the proposal regarding a Commission is the only hope So t ^ X*.

I request that those of our subjects in Bahrain, who do not possess passports, but who wish to travel to India, or to foreign countries, should not be supplied travel permits at Bahrain, but should be called upon to obtain passports from their country of origin and we shall make special arrangements to expedite the completion of their passports. 1 request Your Excellency to recommend that our subjects in Bahrain snould be well treated, and their rights guarded. I request that you will undertake the necessary negotiations to open wireless communications with Bahrain, and to fix moderate rates so as to encourage the expansion of trade and improve the relations between the two countries. I await the proposals which you will make regarding anan agreement for the surrender of criminals between Bahrain and ejtL I request you to make arrangements for exchange of mails between Nejd and Bahrain and for their despatch from Bahrain to their destinations. 1 request that efforts be made to arrange that commercial trats plying between our coasts in the Gulf and the Bahrain coast, should carry manifests for the cargo on board. I request tnat efforts be made to arrange for exchange of judicial summonses between Bahrain and Bejd through the Amirs of places in our lands and through the Shaikhs of Bahrain in Bahrain. As regards the discussions that took place about permitting our subjects to trade at Kuwait, we- see no objection to a meeting of representatives of our Government and representatives of the Kuwait Government, at Kuwait, Bahrain or Hasa to discuss this matter to consider how interests of both parties may be protected.

The second despatch (pp.9-15) discusses the Koweit blockade question. A very brief summary of the position will be found in pr ra. 15 of Colonel Biscoe* s despatch at P.Z.1234/31 (flagged). It was decided at the inter- and Colonel Biscoe were both present, thet a threat to raise the Bahrein transit dues might prove a useful weapon in any discussions on the subject. (At the moment a new development in this question is under discussion between the Resident and the Government of India, who will make recommendations to His Majesty* s Government - P,Z. 1589/32). It wall be seen that, in his recent interviews with the Resident, the King was at first intransigent, pleading his financial troubles and his fear of loss of revenue if goods entered Nejd through Koweit. In the end he suggested the appointment of ccmmissioners frcm either side to work out a compromise. This is a considerable advance on his part: what he would apparently welcome is that Koweit should make a fixed annual payment representing his share of the Koweit customs but this might be regarded as tribute by the Sheikh and therefore be unacceptable. Colonel Dickson is to ascertain whether the Sheikh would agree to a conference being held. 4. The Resident is still anxious that Ibn Saud should be reminded of the Sheikh’s claims from him, amounting to Rs.l4i lakhs. It is understood that the Sheikh would waive them in return for the raising of the ,, blockade ,, and, although 773/31. departmental conference last August, at which Sir A. Ryan Ibn/I^n Saud could not possibly pay at present, they might prove a useful lever in the negotiations. The meeting of last August decided that Colonel Biscoe's suggestion that the bill should be presented was unwise, in case it should frighton Ibn Saud off altogether from conversations egarding Koweiti affairs (pg.13 of P.Z.5773/31). How that friendly contact has been established, it may perhaps be thought useful that the claim should be communicated to the Hejazis, as Colonel Biscoe suggests (cf.the last sentence of §4 of the record of the meeting). But nothing can be decided till we know the I x i.e.as to the attitude of the Sheikh of Koweit.* suggested appointment of P.Z.1354 . j oi nt c omm i s s lon ers . See pages 5. Please see the minute on P.Z. 781/32. The Minister 14-15 of the papers for the for Foreign Affair’s hint that it was incorrect for His procedure which Col.Biscoe pro- Majesty’s Government to make representations on behalf of poses in regard to this question Koweit, at once countered by His Majesty’s Minister, and the and that of the presentation of tension which exists in the relations between Sir Andrew the Koweit claim. Ryan and Fuad Hamza owing to the Royal Slave incident should J.C.W; 16.3. be noted. (SB.) A.F.MORLEY. 15.3.32. Colonel Biscoe’s two despatches are extremely good and interesting. It certainly seems that the proposal to attempt a solution of the blockade question by a ’’lay” commercial joint commission offers the only possible hope, unusual and, one would have thought, unprecedented as it is. But judging from the (admittedly quite dissimilar) discussions with a view to settling Hejd-Transjordan frontier raids, it is at least open to question whether in fact much progress is likely to be made by commissioners who are not directly representative of Ibn Saud and practically/r ; - Ml W. n practically in a position to bind him. However, if they can agree on a definite percentage of Koweit customs dues to be paid to Hejaz revenues and if the Sheikh can be induced to swallow that as a purely conmercial transaction and in no way a tribute payment, no doubt Ibn Saud would be glad to accept an assured source of revenue in exchange for the raising of the blockade and consequent probable falling-off of trade thorugh Uejd ports. As to the question of the claims of the Sheikh of Koweit against Ibn Saud (14-|~ lakhs), one wonders whether any real purpose would be served by pressing the claim at this stage as a ’lever* in the negotiations for the raising of the blockade. In the first place it is perfectly obvious that Ibn Saud cannot begin to pay at present, and he must know that we know that he cannot: he can hardly be impressed by a presentation of the claim which would be so patently 'bluff'; but on the other hand if Ibn Saud thinks it desirable to make an agreement with Koweit for other reasons (e.g. for an annual cash payment) and at the same time holds the Sheikh t o an offer to cancel the debt, the Sheikh will have definitely lost all ho^e of getting any satisfaction. That is to say, it seems improbable that the lever would help the negotiations': but if the negotiations should prove successful for other reasons the lever, if it were employed, would be finished with and could not be used in the future. This of course does not mean that Sir A. Ryan should not, some time or other, mention the fact of the debt as being in existence and being one which Ibn Saud will have to pay when conditions improve.n The Despatch No. 2 (flagged A) giving a general account of the visit is very interesting. It passed off exceedingly well. Although the despatch is addressed to the Colonial Office (because it concerns Ibn Send) the matters discussed were all of more concern to the India Office than to the Colonial Office, and it does not seem out of place for us to suggest an acknowledgment.
