Mr. Kordik. Please see the Political Resident's Express Letter of 2?th December, below. Treasury sanction of the Public Works Budget was conveyed in their letter of 9th October (copy enclosed), replying to ours of the 26th August, of which you already have a copy. As regards re- appropriation^ in our Draft Letter to the Government of India^ regarding the Budget in which you recently concurred, it is stated ' The powers of re-appropriation which the Political Resident previously enjoyed under the Government of India feudget iftanual will continue'• I think -it is certainly desirable to give the Politicail Resident this power of re- appropriation in respect of Works and Buildings. Do you consider it necessary to obtain the Treasury's concurrence before 13.1.48 . j 4 JAN 194jjiTREASURY CHAMBERS, Ext. 1713/47. GREAT GEORGE STREET, IP. 140/04. LOImDON, S.W.l. Ext. 220V1947. 9th October, 1947. Dear Donaldson, I refer to your letter of 26th August about the budget for the posts under the control of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for the financial year 1947-48. In the circumstances explained in .your letter we approve the estimates as they stand for Subhead A and Subhead B subject to adjustment as a result of your approach to the Government of India on the question of division (Persian side of the Gulf) between Indian and U.K. revenues. As regards Subhead C: Telegrams and Telephones, we recognise that it is late in the year to effect much saving but we must ask that every effort should be made to economize on telegrams in accordance with our instructions to the Foreign Office. On the subsidiary points raised in your paragraph 6 we agree that the Political Residents powers of reappropriation (virement) may be continued till the end of the current financial year. We also agree that as the Indian Treasury Offices will be maintained for Indian purposes it will be convenient to use them until 31st March next. We are consulting the Comptroller and Auditor General on the question of audit arrangements and I will write to you when we have received his reply. I am sending a copy of this letter to Gardener at the Foreign Officer #.P. Donaldson, Esq., C.M.G., Commonwealth Relations Office. Yours sincerely, J.D.K.

Sir ^ith reference to correspondence ending with my telegram No.1217 dat ed the 25th November, 1947, I have the honour to forward herewith an estimate ^dT expenditure on works in the Persian Gulf Residency for the year 1948 - 49. In the circumstances of the case the figures can be little more than guesses especially those given under the head 'Major Works', 2. With regard to the estimate given for repairs and^ replacements of furniture and office equipment I would point out that most of the furniture in the residences of officers and staff has been purchased privately thaw through funds obtained by contributions from incumbents and is not borne on any Government books. As I understand officers and staff serving under the Foreign Office are entitled to be provided with furniture free of cost I am assuming that this furniture will in the future be maintained by Government. In view of the somewhat haphazard manner in which it has been acquired and maintained in the past it may be necessary to incur substantial initial expenditure on repairs and replacements. 3. I have not included any provision for the hew building which it is proposed should be constructed at once in Jufair as it is not known how much of the expenditure is likely to be incurred during the current and how much during the next financial year. The cost is estimated at roughly £ 12,750 plus £ 1500 for furniture. 4. I have made no provision for furniture for any new Residency buildings which may be constructed during the next financial year vide the first item in the remarks column under 'Major Works'. If considered necessary a sum of say £ 5000 may be added to the estimates on this account. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter and its enclosure to the Ministry of Works Representative at Cairo. I I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant Political Resident in the Persian Gulf./''‘V £&amp;C \ y D.O. N»« 3555-65/8 . V\ W-c^WU Ple-tc»e iefer t# my letter No&gt; 3548-61/4 dated 29th November 1947, forwarding the works budget for this Kesidency. 2* aou will find that under 'Major Works' I have included a sum of £• 15,000 for a house and office for the Political uiiicer Trucial Coast, 3, The existing accommodation at Sharjah is of an entirely make-shift nature and X asKed Walters of the Ministry of Works to have a look at it in the course of his wanderings. He has reported 'I can safely say in my view the existing building is extrenriLy bad and the conditions such as to be almost insufferable for a European officer during the winter months and of course even less bearable in the hotter weather'. 4, Both Prior and myself have recommended that a separate Political Agency should be established upon the Trucial Coast vide correspondence ending with my demi-official letter No . 1145-S dated 14th Juiie, 1947» and I gathered from discussions while I was at home that this proposal is generally viewed with favour. If it is to be put into force it means that a European officer will have to be stationed at Sharjah or whatever other place may be adopted as his headquarters throughout the year and I feel that no officer can be asked to do this until suitable accommodation is provided. As Walters 1 report shows and as I know from my own experience no European officer ought really to be asked to reside in the existing accommodation even for a few months during the cold weather. Quite apart from his poersonal discomfort his miserable quarters are little calculated to uphold H.M.G. f s prestige which is what we mostly have to rely on in this part ot the world. The question of providing better accommodation would no doubt have been taken up long ttsm ago but for the war and the subsequent constitution al changes in India, I would strongly urge therefore that even if it is not desired to commit H.M.G. to the proposal to establish a new Political Agency at this stage adequate residential and office accommodation should be provided for the Political Officer Trucial Coast at the earl iest possible date.

We have not yet been told where exactly v/e are to look for guidance, what local staff we are to have, how we are to prepare estimates and keep accounts etc., etc. Walters who*is with us now is concerned with the question of the site of the new Residency and the value of buildings but not with procedure. Unless Turner's report furnishes^ information on tht subject I would urge that some officer of the Ministry of Y/orks be deputed here as soon as possible to decide on the future procedure and draw up instructions for our guidance.

We have three grants (i) for ordinary repairs which is knov/n as the Central Contract Grant (ii) for special repairs and (iii) for minor works. Of these the Central Contract Grant is shown in the Residency budget and the other two heads are included in the p.W.B. budget.. (i) Central Contract Grant . The Residency budget allotment is Rs. 40,000 and this is intended to cover the Residency Kuwait and the Persian posts. Against this Rs. 15,100 approximately has been drawn up to date leaving a balance of Rs. 24,900. The amount drav/n includes Rs. 6,666/11 on account of the £. 500 sanctioned for repairs to the Jufair buildings. The whole of this £. 500 has been drawn but the bulk of i t has not vet been spent. I would emphasise tne fact tna¥ I applied for permission to spend this sum as a kind of advance pending His Majesty f s Governments approval of the entire Central Contract Grant vide my demi- official letter No. 1106-91/1 of the 10th May, 1947, to you and I trust that the balance of the Central Contract Grant will remain at my disposal for expenditure on the Residency buildings or elswwhere as may be required. on the Persian side and a further Rs. 5,000/- is likely to be required to cover ordinary repairs at Shiraz* Bushire and Khorramshahr. It is not reasonable that this grant should be treated in the same way as the P.W.B. grants and be regarded as being intended half for the Arab and half for the Persian side of the Gulf as the bulk of it would ordinarily have been spent on the Sabzabad Residency and connected buildings. The place of these has now been taken by the Jufair buildings. If it is necessary to make a definite allotment between the two sides of the Gulf then Rs. 10,000 of the original grant of Rs. 40,000 should be allotted for the Persian side and the balance for the Arab side. The Muscat and Bahrain Agencies have separate allotments of Rs. 4,000 and Ks. 1,600 respectively as Central Contract E.P. Donaldson, Esquire, C.M.G., Commonwealth Relations Office, Whitehall, LONDON. 2 . The position regarding money available for works About Rs. 5,000/- of the grant has already been spent- 2 - 2343 A 5 Grants and I am assuming that these will remain at their dispos (ii) Special repairs. This allotment as the name shows is intended” for large scale repairs and alterations and not for day to day maintenance. The allotment in the P.W.D. budget was Rs. 75,300 and of this Rs. 14,200 was spent upKto the 14th August 1947 leaving an unspent balaiide oi Hi. 61,100. Half of this viz. Rs. 30,550 may be regarded as ear-marked for the Arab side of the Gulf. Of this I am compelled to spend at once Rs. 13,742/10 for the re-wiring of the Kuwait Agency building and the purchase of fans owing to the fact that the current at Kuv/ait has been changed from direct to alternating. Expenditure on the power-house at Muscat is met from this head but realisations from electricity consumers are set off against it. I trust I shall be allowed to utilise if necessary the whole of the unspent balance for the Arab side viz. Rs. 30,550. U/wU-^ (iii) Pfinor re^&amp;4rs . The allotment in the P.Y^.D. budget was Rs. 74,500 of which Rs. 1,500 was spent up to t he 14th August. 1947 leaving an unspent balance of Rs. 36,500. If half of this is regarded as being available for the Arab side of the Gulf the amount in hand is Rs. 36,500. The estimated cost of the revised minor works programme for the Arab side is Rs. 40,000 vide the enclosure to my demi-official letter No. 1455-93/2-b of the 23rd June 1947 to Low a copy of which was forwarded to you^ 3. To sum ups if I am allowed to utilise the unspent balances of the three grants described above at my discretion and to re-appropriate from one to the other I should have adequate funds in hand to cover all works and repairs that it is necessary to undertake during the current financial year. Th sum of £. 3,750 sanctioned to cover alterations to the Residency has long ago been spent. Subject to any decision that may be reached at the forthcoming conference with the Senior Naval Officer and the Ministry of Works Representative no further additions or alterations are likely to be necessary but fairly extensive repairs are essential. The buildings are mostly of a very poor type and the Residency roof leaked like a sieve whenever it rained last cold weather. The same is the case with the roofs of some of the other buildings and we must do. something to remedy matters as soon as possible. I should be most grateful for very early authority by telegram to utilise the funds I have described in the manner proposed. 4. I have dealt above only with grants for repairs and works. In addition expenditure is being incurred on the P.W.D. establishment, contingencies etc. vide correspondence ending v/ith your telegram No. 12083 of the 3rd October 1947.

This is a grant intended to cover repairs to Government buildings and is non-auditable Bahrain and Muscat have separate allotments and the Residency grant is intended to cover the Residency, Kuwait and the South Persian consulates. In 1946-47 the grant was distri buted as follows : Kuwait Shiraz Bandar .abbas Kerman Khorramshahr Residency Bushire Consulate Rs. Rs. Rs. Rs. Rs. 5.500 4.500 3,000 1,900 500 Rs. 22,600 Rs. 2,000 Up to date in the current financial year I have only allotted Rs. 3,000/- to Kuwait and the balance remains to be distri buted. In view of the down-grading of the Bushire Consulate- General ^ very little money is likely to be required for the babzabad Residency which will presumably be abandoned and sole, and I should therefore have ample funds to cover reuairs to the temporary Residency buildings at Jufair if there is no objection to my using the grant for this purpose. I should be grateful for your views on this point. Any expenditure from the grant on the Arab side of the Gulf will presumably be recovered by the Government of India from His Majesty's [Government so^that the former can hardly object if a nortion I'of the grant is used for t;ne' purpose orooosed. a v V 1 ' ' »' 2. and Turner.
