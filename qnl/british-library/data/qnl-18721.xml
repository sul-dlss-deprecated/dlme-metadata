Also included in this letter are details of punishments carried out against the sons of the late Sheik of Debai [Shaikh Maktoum bin Buti Al Maktoum of Dubai] in the absence of the current Sheik, Said ben Buttye [Shaikh Saeed bin Buti Al Maktoum]. Tronson reports that he has procured two casks of black sand from Angaum [Hengām, Jazīreh-ye], which are required by the Superintendent of Stationery at Bombay. He concludes the letter by stating that he returned to his station near Bassadore [Bāsa‘īdū, Qeshm Island] on 24 October, whereupon he received a letter from Captain Arnold Burrowes Kemball (letter no. 330 of 1852). He promises to act upon the instructions in Kemball's letter. This letter is stated as being a true copy made by Commodore George Robinson, Commander of the
