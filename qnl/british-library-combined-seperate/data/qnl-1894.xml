The file also contains correspondence between Charles Belgrave, Adviser to the Government of Bahrain and Hickinbotham.The file contains three black and white aerial photographs of Zubarah (ff 80-81).On folios 82-92 the file contains a report written by Hickinbotham entitled 'Zubarah incident' that contains a summary of relevant events and recommendations for British Policy on the issue.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Qatar</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Na'īm (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Zubarah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003a9#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003a9#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003a9#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
