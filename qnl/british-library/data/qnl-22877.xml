THE BERGIUS COMPANY, LTD., 254 BOBBIE'S LOAN, GLASGOW, C.4. January, 1933 ■ I© Introduction ^ In designing these engines we have considered it desirable to avoid certain X * features common to some engines already on the market. One of these is the q/V injector nozzle with a number of very small holes ; another is the use of accumulated airy , ,or electricity f or starting ^ a third the lack of sufficient access to internal parts! In petrol engines the air and fuel are mixed before entering the cylinder. In Diesel engines the air is within the cylinder before the fuel is injected and to mix them thoroughly in the short time available is the major part of the Diesel problem. In large engines this is usually accomplished by blowing the fuel into the cylinder by means of air. The high pressure necessary involves a pump so elaborate that most makers are endeavouring to adopt airless or solid injection, Solid injection engines are of two types—those in which the air within the com bustion chamber is stagnant at the time of injection and those in which the air is in a state of turbulence. ^ Perfect combustion entails bringing the fuel in contact with sufficient air. To accomplish this in a stagnant combustion chamber requires a nozzle with several holes pointing in different directions, and to penetrate the highly compressed air the fuel pressure must be very high and the holes so small as to be scarcely visible or capable of being cleared, v The combustion chamber which we employ produces so high a degree of turbulence that it is possible to use a single nozzle of practical size and a fuel pressure which imposes no undue load upon the pumps. Owing to the high compression employed, the starting of Diesel engines has proved quite a problem. Some small engines are started by vigorous cranking; larger engines rely entirely on accumulated air or electricity. As it is difficult in practice to avoid leakage of air or electricity we do not consider either system sufficiently reliable for an engine on which life sometimes depends. After much research and experiment, we have evolved a system of starting by hand and petrol . It is simple and, being part of the engine, avoids the numerous accessories necessary to air or electric systems. Any engine which depends for starting heat solely on compression is liable to become a non-starter when slightly out of condition. The pre-heating effect of petrol completely avoids this ris k. As a rule, good accessibility to internal parts is not sufficiently considered at the time of purchase. In most Diesel engines of the size under consideration the adjustment of the bearings involves lifting the upper part of the engine, and, while this is no great disadvantage to an engine on land, it is intolerable in a marine engine as these are practi cally built into the vessel. Should bearing trouble develop in such an engine, the work of rectifying it is quite beyond the power of the man in charge and the vessel is disabled. Our aim has been to produce an engine which may be completely serviced in position. In the matter of cylinder wear, Diesel engines up till now have been inferior to petrol engines . This is caused by the high gas pressure forcing the rings against the cylinder. As it seems impossible to avoid the cause, we have considered it necessary to fit hardened cylinder liners and hardened piston rings. It is common practice to expose the outside of the cylinder liner to the cooling water. This entails a soft joint and, should the engine become overheated , this j oint shrinks and ad mits water to the crankcase. To renew the joint entails dismantling most of the engine. In our design the liner is not exposed to the cooling water.640 General Description q Kelvin-Diesel engines have been developed in co-operation with Mr. H. R. Ricardo and embody certain of his patents. They are of the four-cycle compression-^ solid-injection type and comply with the requirements of lyloyd s and the Board of Trade. SIZE. The cylinders are 6 inches bore; the stroke is 9 inches. A long stroke has important advantages for marine work—the speed is less, the propeller larger and the efficiency higher. FUEL. Any oil derived from Crude Petroleum may be consumed provided that it is not too thick for the fuel pumps. POWER.— Each engine is tested with Shell-Mex-Diesel Oil and is guaranteed capable of developing, without smoke, within 3 per cent, of the power, speed and consumption stated. An extract from the test record is furnished to a purchaser on request. For a small extra charge the performance of the engine can be certified by Wo yd s. The , consumptions stated are at full load. If the engine is operated at 4 load, the ^ consumption is only f of that stated. STARTING. —All models are started by hand and magneto from cold and without the aid of compressed air or electric batteries. A wineglassful of petro l is required for each start. A single pull on the starting handle is sufficient. SLOW RUNNING.— Is a feature of these engines. The speed range is 150 to 750 revolu tions per minute. Throughout this range the combustion is perfect and the^exhaust smokeles s. CONTROL. —The engine is governor-controlled throughout its speed range. A single lever controls the governor; a wheel controls the clutch ; the water control is automatic. DECK CONTROL.— For the control of the engine from deck or cockpit, a variety of fittings may be supplied (see Installation Sheet No. 6). FUEL PUMPS— Of Bosch manufacture and driven by flexible coupling. NOZZLES.— Of Bosch Pintle type—less liable to choke than nozzles with plain holes. In event of a nozzle becoming choked, its fuel supply may be cut off and the engine operated on the remaining cylinders until it is convenient to clear the nozzle. FUEL FILTERS.— The fuel passes first through a gauze filter, then through a fabric filter. Both may be quickly cleaned. The filter is attached rigidly to the engine. WATER REGULATOR.— Diesel engines shew a tendency to knock on light loads. This is reduced by keeping the cylinders hot. At full speed the water passes from the pump direct to the cylinder thence to the silencer. When running slow, most of the water passes from pump direct to silencer. This method of control keeps the cylinders hot and the exhaust pipe cool. The regulator is automatic in action. LUBRICATION.— Automatic. The oil is carried within the crankcase and below the reach of the cranks. A ram pump supplies a drip situated in the path of each revolving crank. This creates the splash necessary to lubricate all parts. A dip rod indicates the level. The engine may be inclined to the extent of one inch in nine. OIL CONSUMPTION.— The consumption of lubricating oil is only one gallon for 100 gallons of fuel oil. There is no dilution of the lubricating oil by the fuel oil. ACCESSIBILITY.— All running parts are enclosed, yet the accessibility is good. The pistons and connecting rods may be removed through the inspection doors. All crank bearings are adjustable through the inspection doors. The crankshaft comes out at the end. Any repair may be carried out without lifting the engine. CYLINDERS.— Each cylinder is fitted with a renewable liner of centrifugally cast iron —very hard. The liner is not exposed to the cooling water and there are no perishable ^ joints liable to burn should the water service fail. CYLINDER HEADS.— Are separate and easily detached. Valve guides renewable. PISTONS. —Of Aluminium Alloy with four hardened rings.(5&gt; 641 ^CONNECTING RODS.—Of steel H. Section—very light. Big ends lined with white Ikietal. Bolts of Nickel steel. VALVE GEAR.—Inlet and exhaust valves are vertical in the head and operated by rockers of hardened steel mounted on roller bearings—all enclosed by an oil-tight cover easily removed. The rockers are operated by vertical push rods encased in brass pipes. The camshaft is within the crankcase, well lubricated, and driven by gear wheels within an oil-tight case. The cams are integral with the shaft. CRANKSHAFTS.—Of Nickel steel—very hard—with crankpins hollow to reduce unbalanced weight. All models have balance weights. The one and two cylinder models create no more vibration than the four cylinder model. BEARINGS.—The crankshaft has a bearing between each cylinder and two bearings between the front cylinder and the flywheel. All the bearings are adjustable through the inspection doors. i CRANKCASE.—In one piece with inspection doors on both sides giving access to everv internal part; white enamelled inside. FLYWHEEL.—Fixed by large flange and bolts, balanced and of ample weight for running slow. Flywheel pan to protect flywheel from bilge water. EXHAUST MANIFOLD.—Water cooled with cleaning door each end. SILENCER.—Of our well-known pattern in which the circulating water and the exhaust gases mix together—discharge almost inaudible—silencer and exhaust pipe never more than hand hot. This silencer must be above sea level. For deep boats a standpipe to raise it is furnished without extra charge. EXHAUST PIPE.—The sulphur contained in Diesel fuel causes rapid corrosion of copper or iron. The exhaust pipe is, therefore, of material which resists this corrosion. WATER PUMP.—Of gunmetal with a single cotton-packed ram, chromium plated— sand resisting. Valves of brass all immediately accessible. STRAINER.—Combined with the seacock is a strainer of Monel Metal which may be cleared from inboard without stopping the engine. CRANKCASE PUMP.—For emptying the crankcase a hand pump is fixed in a con venient position. STARTING HANDLE.—At rear end with revolving brass grip ; safety device to prevent back-kick when engine stops. REVERSE GEAR.—Attached direct to the engine—permanent in alignment. The ahead clutch is double, the astern clutch single. Both of cast iron. The thrust, both ahead and astern, is taken on ball bearings situated within the case. The case is white enamelled inside and oil tight. The control is by gunmetal hand wheel. TANKS. Two types may be supplied. The horizontal tank is more suitable for shallow boats, but the vertical type is the better tank, and is recommended when it can be accommodated. The horizontal tanks are galvanized in and out. The vertical tanks are internally coated with white enamel. EQUIPMENT.—Propeller of bronze and balanced. Sterntube of naval brass with out side stuffing box to exclude sand. Shaft bearings of gunmetal split for adjustment. All hull connections of gunmetal. All pipes of corrosion resisting metal. Tool outfit very complete (see page 653). SCREW THREADS.—The British Standard Fine Thread is used throughout (except ~ for pipes) in preference to the Whitworth thread, now out-of-date except for rough work. Wy Small screws and studs are of rustless material. vs INSTALLATION WORK.—If a plan of the vessel is furnished, the equipment will be made to suit whereby the work of installation is brought within the capacity of a carpenter with his ordinary tools.642 Kelvin-Diesel Engine and Marine Equipment Q Model K1 with 1 Cylinder, 21 Horse Power The engine is illustrated opposite and is complete with reversing gear, clutch, starting gear, governor, fuel pumps, filter, crankcase pump, water pump, silencer, flywheel and pan, etc. ' The standard equipment is as follows and, with the addition of woodwork, is suitable to complete an installation in a normal boat without further outlay.

Designers and builders of all types of motor ct THOHNYCROFT HOUSE, iEuTH Works: READING, (Marine Motors). SOUT]Reprinted from ' ENGINEERING.' • o A NEW REVERSING GEAR FOR MARINE ENGINES. I mprovements in both the design and construction of internal-combustion engines for craft of small or moderate size have been most marked in recent years, and may be said to have culminated in the production of reliable airless-injection engines. The higher powers and speeds which characterise the latest practice have, however, imposed much heavier duties on the engine ancillaries, and cases are of not in frequent occurrence in which such units as the reduc tion and reversing gears have failed after a compara tively short period of service under the additional stresses to which they have been subjected. It is of particular importance that the reverse gear should be thoroughly reliable, as modern conditions frequently demand long periods of reverse running, and with these points in view, Messrs; John I. Thomycroft and Company, Limited, Thomycroft House, Smith-square, S.W.I, have introduced the new gear illustrated. It has been designed for continuous and heavy use in all classes of motor craft, and is claimed to be equal in reliability to the average gear box on road vehicles. It is equally suitable for petrol, paraffin or heavy-oil engines, although the requirements of high speed airless-injection engines have been particularly kept in view. The gear is designed for engine speeds between 1,200 r.p.m. and 1,800 r.p.m., this covering the requirements of the majority of modem engines, and will transmit 80 brake horse-power at the first- mentioned speed, with proportionately greater powers at higher speeds. The speeds ahead and astem are equal, thus giving the maximum retarding effect to the propeller when reversed. The gear can be arranged for bolting directly to the engine, and is provided with adjustable feet, as shown in Fig. 3, to facilitate alignment! The gear consists essentially of three parts, the driving-shaft assembly, the planet-wheel casing, and the driven-shaft assembly. These parts are shown, res pectively, to the right, centre, and left in Fig. 1, and assembled together in Fig. 4. The driven shaft can be coupled to the planet-wheel casing at will, by means of the multiple-plate clutch, clearly shown in both figures, and the casing itself can be either held or allowed to run freely by means of the band brake shown in Figs. 4 and 6. The operation is as follows : Assum ing the gear to be in the neutral position, shown in Fig. 4, both the clutch and brake will be free. In these circumstances, the planet-wheel casing will spin round freely, as less resistance will be offered to its motion than to that of the driven shaft, to which the propeller is, of course, coupled. For the ahead posi tion, the control handwheel, shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 6, is turned in the direction to raise the nut threaded on the lower end of its spindle. This nut can be seen in Figs. 3 and 4, and it will be noticed that it is mounted in the forked end of a lever. At its centre, this lever is keyed to the brake-operating shaft, shown in Fig. 6, passing over the top of the brake drum. The other end of the lever is also forked, and is connected by a link, as indicated in Fig. 4, to the clutch control gear. The operation of the clutch, through adjustable fingers, will be obvious from this figure, and from Fig. 5. The rise of the nut on the handwheel spindle rotates the brake-operating shaft in the direction to free the brake, and actuates the cam-shaped sliding sleeve, clearly seen on the driven shaft in Fig. 4. The sliding of the sleeve aft causes the rollers to mount the cam, the other end of the roller lever coming into contact with the master plate of the clutch, the pressure exerted being adjustable by means of operating screws. When the clutch is fully engaged, the pinion on the end of the driven shaft will be coupled to the planet-wheel casing, and since this will prevent relative rotation between this pinion and the planet wheels, a direct drive will be obtained between the two shafts, the whole gear rotating as one piece. For the reverse motion, the handwheel is turned in the opposite direction, lowering the nut to tighten the F ig. I. C omponent P abts of G ear.brake and release the clutch. The planet-wheel casing will thus be held, and the drive will be through the two crown wheels and the planet wheels. It will thus be seen that, in principle, the gear is of conventional design, the departures from previous practice lying in the exceptionally sturdy nature of the construction and in the means taken to minimise wear, including forced lubrication throughout. The clutch is made up of alternate steel and bronze discs, and is located in a position where it obtains ample lubrication. The brake shoes are of aluminium lined with Ferodo. As shown in Fig. 6, they are pivoted at the bottom on a short link. The hole in the link, which registers with the guide pin, is elongated in the plane of the shoes, leaving the latter with a limited freedom of movement. The degree of freedom given is sufficient to enable the brake to exercise a self-energising action, thus obviating any tendency to slip, but is insufficient to cause snatching. As the gear is designed to transmit full power astern for considerable periods if required, the bevel wheels may be running under load for corresponding periods at high speed. In common with all the other moving portions of the gear, they are mounted on ball bearings, and to ensure adequate lubrication in the circumstances described, oil is fed under pressure to all the bearings, and is also directed on to the teeth of the wheels themselves. The oil is supplied by the plunger pump shown to the left in Fig. 4. This pump is driven by an eccentric on the driven shaft, and from it the oil is fed into a channel drilled in the shaft, from which it is again fed to the various bearings and on to the wheel teeth through suitable leads in the shaft. The propeller thrust is taken up on the tapered-roller bearing shown in Fig. 4. This bearing is designed to deal with heavy loads at low speeds, and is also pressure lubricated. The whole of the mechanism is freely accessible on removal of the large top cover shown in Figs. 3 and 4, and all adjustments can be made without the use of special spanners. The operating wheel can be fitted on either side of the casing, and all adjustments to the ahead and astern motions can be made from the outside, a vernier adjustment with a single bolt fixing being provided for this purpose. About four turns of the handwheel are required for the complete travel from full forward to full reverse. As shown in Fig. 4, the driven Fig. 2. Redxjction-Geae CasBTg and Pinion. shaft is fitted with a coupling for direct connection to the intermediate or propeller shaft, but if required, the two-to-one single-helical re duction gear shown in Fig. 7 can be fitted. In this case, the coupling and tapered-roller bearing are replaced by a helical- gear pinion, a ball bearing and a roller bearing, with an oil- retaining seal between the two bearings. This oil seal is fitted to enable the gear to be inverted if necessary, and prevents the lubricant from running into the main gear when in the inverted position. The roller bearing race also Fig. 3. Gear Box with Reduction-Gear Pinion in Position. forms a spigot for centralising the reducing-gear casing at any angle ; the ball bearing takes the thrust of the helical pinion, while the roller bearing deals with the radial load. The assembly can be seen in section on Fig. 7, and the gear wheels are also shown in position in Figs. 2 and 3. The reduction-gear casing can be swung round through any angle divisible by 60 deg., or located at any other angle by special driUing. The reduction gear is stated to be perfectly silent in action, and the thrust due to the helical teeth, is designed to relieve the bearings of a large proportion of the propeller thrust. The gear requires no adjustment, and is separately lubricated. The weight of the box has been kept down to within very reasonable limits, to agree with modem engine practice, the total weight of the reverse gear being approximately 4J cwt., or, when the reducing gear is fitted, 6 cwt.SECTION AT AFT END.

Another thing is that he put the price of the Stay Plank {2 pieces)as Rs.70/- while they are on}y worth Rs.56/-.The planks used for the Stay Plank are similar to those used for the outer shell. ) * 11.9.34 $ Vlo-' a .

He says that the price of each block of 8 planks is Rs.225/- and according to this rate the price of the whole 38 would come to Rs.1068/12/- whereas he has shown in his list Rs.665/- only - a difference of Rs.403/12/-. He. G. These two planks are the same as those used for the outer shell explained above in length,breaath and thickness.

His reason for reaching this conclusion was that, when the engine was examined, nothing could be found to prevent the ball race from being drawn out of the small starting gear when the starting gear was withdrawn# Such means may have been fitted originally but had disappeared when the breakdown occurred# la view of this expert opinion and of — —— the fact that the engine was new, I maintain that the makers should bear the cost of the repairs# Will you therefore please submit my request to your principals for their decision, Yours faithfully, HAL Lieutenant, 0ft. fop Officiating PolitTeal Agent, Bahrain k \A — VGOVEMMENT OF BAHRilN ELECTHIG SUPJ^LI DEPARMiNT NO.

A.R.Copy of a letter No.LP/PP dated the 25th July 1935 from Messrs John I. Thornycroft &amp; Co., Ltd., Thornycroft house, Smith Square, Westminster, London, S.W.I, to Messrs A .M.Yateem Brothers, Bahrain We are in receipt through our Head Office of your letter of the 14th July, enclosing original letter from the Officiating Political Agent, which we return. I We cannot admit that the trouble in this case was due either to defective design or workmanship. The ball bearing in the starter pinion is efficiently held in place by the method which you will see detailed on the enclosed sketch, and out of some 2000 engines which we have supplied with this type of gear we have only known of one case of the ball bearing getting loose. This was proved to be due to the engine attendant having omitted to pull out the tee handle which engages the starting pinion, running the engine up to 1500 revolutions, which connotes a speed of 6000 revolutions of the pinion. In this case we had an opportunity of examining the pinion and we found that undoubtedly the ball bearing had been running round loose in it and had worn away the projecting lip which we put on with the forming tool. In the circumstances we regret that we can make no abatement of the charge made for the work done in this case.

Reference No Dear Sir ■%u&gt;t THE SCIENCE MUSEUM, South Kensington, London, S.W.7. 24th June, 1935 I see that in a recent article in 'The Times', it is stated that as a result of your keen interest in the native craft of Bahrein you have 'been alole to make some improvements in the design of local dhows 'by introducing some of the characteristics of a Scottish trawler. As the Officer in charge of the large collection of models of native small craft of this Museum, the matter is of considerable interest to me, for I am much con cerned with the interrelation of similar types and characteristics from different parts of the world. Such similarities are so frequently ascribed to ethnological relationships, while in many cases they seem really to 'be only the results of similar material used to similar conditions. I am not quite clear whether the Bahrein Dhows are'bughlas, sambuks, or dhangis, nor whether the Scottish characteristics which you have intro duced are those of the 'Pifie' or the 'Zulu'. I should, however, be most grateful for any information you can give me, as I am anxious to put it on record here for future reference, and if you could let me have at the same time one or two photographs, these would probably make it all the easier to get a good Idea of your improvements.

Our oil, V.l, to wtiich you refer, is a vapour!sing oil (Kerosene) and might possibly suit the engine of your launch. Supplies are available in Bahrein and I have written to our Agent there and have asked him to supoly you with a 55 litre drum. The price at Bahrein is Rs.5-4-0 per drum which is equivalent to Rs.1-11-0 per 18 litres; the price for P.T, Kerosene, which I understand is the oil you are using at present, is Rs.2-4-0 per 18 litres. It would be as well for you to let me have parti- 1 culars regarding the make, etc.-of your engine so that we could,advise you which oil should be themost suitable for you to use.

Crankshaft speed, 1,500 r.p.m. Propeller speeds when Reducing Gear is fitted, 600 or 375 r.p.m. (For schedule of outfit, see page 6) THE favour with which our RD/4 engine was received, and the demand experienced for a similar one of rather greater power, decided us to produce the six cylinder type RD/6 described herein. The design generally follows that of the four cylinder model, and engines which have been built and thoroughly tested in boats under severe conditions have indicated that the new model will give equally excellent service. The following points are commended to the notice of those looking for a thoroughly reliable and efficient motor, designed essentially for marine work by a firm of pioneers in the industry, and backed by a world-wide service organisation. SIMPLICITY AND RELIABILITY. While possessing those features which modem practice has shown to be desirable, the design embodies no unnecessary compli cations. The crankshaft is carried in the bottom half of the crankcase in seven bearings of ample area. The magneto is of a reliable make decided upon after careful investigation and experience. The carburettor of the petrol engine and the paraffin vaporiser are also thoroughly reliable fitments, subjefted to exhaustive trials before being Standardised. The control of the engine is by two levers, viz., reverse gear and throttle. COMPACT AND CLEAN DESIGN. The minimum number of projections and separate attachments has been aimed at with the objeft of producing an engine compaft and neat in appearance. The engine and reverse gear being combined, a compaft unit results. The reducing gear, supplied when necessary, makes little addition to the overall length. ACCESSIBILITY. The crankshaft is in the bottom half of the crankcase, thus facilitating overhaul of the engine in the boat when necessary. Large inspeftion doors are provided in crankcase and water-jacket. The cylinders are easily removable and the cylinder head is detachable to facilitate decarbonising and grinding-in of valves. The reverse gear has a large inspeftion door, and the clutches are easily adjustable. Webs are caSt between the bearer arms to prevent tools, etc., from falling into the bilges. The magneto, car burettor and eleftric self-Starter (when fitted) are readily accessible. GUARANTEED POWERS. All engines are tested at our Works on Heenan and Froude Dynamometers, and the guaranteed powers, which are conservative figures, can always be suStantiated by a brake teSt report for every engine. WIDE RANGE OF SERVICE. The engine is supplied at customer's option to use either petrol (gasolene) and similar light fuels only, or to operate on paraffin (kerosene Starting on petrol. Particulars of the respective powers and fuel consumptions are given herein. REDUCING GEAR. For the heavier classes of craft where a large, slow-running propeller is of advantage, we can supply reducing gear giving lower tailshaft speeds. The ratio may be either approximately 2 J to 1 or 4 to 1, as will beSt suit the conditions. (For detailed information see under ' REDUCING GEAR ' on page 4.) Reducing gears have been used by us for many years in combination with our petrol and paraffin engines, with extremely satisfaftory results. The increased efficiency of the large slow-running propeller frequently makes possible the use of a smaller engine than would otherwise be installed, thus effefting economy in initial coSt, fuel consumption, maintenance, and in weight and necessary machinery space. (For information regarding propeller diameters, see under ' PROPELLER ' and ' REDUCING GEAR,' pages 3 and 4, and outline drawings, pages 8, 9 and 10.) General Specification OUTPUT. The petrol model is guaranteed to develop 75 b.h.p. at 1,500 r.p.m., and the paraffin model 55 b.h.p. at 1,500 r.p.m. FUEL CONSUMPTION. The engine is supplied as a petrol model to use either petrol (gasolene) and similar light fuels only, or as a paraffin model to operate on paraffin (kerosene). Starting on petrol. The consumption of fuel which is guaranteed not to be exceeded on full power brake teSt at our Works is as follows :— Petrol Engine: .7 lb. (.33 kilo) per b.h.p./hour. Paraffin Engine : .8 lb. (.36 kilo) per b.h.p./hour. This is equivalent to an hourly consumption of approxi mately 5^ gallons (25 litres) for the paraffin and 7 gallons (32 litres) for the petrol engines. CYLINDERS. Six in number, caSt monobloc in close grained iron, with ample cooling water-jackets and cleaning doors, and bores accurately finished by grinding. The cylinder block is fitted with two detachable heads, the circulating water connexions being incorporated in the castings, and the whole length of the piston travel is water- jacketed. The bolts are so disposed as to ensure an easily made and satisfaftory joint between the detachable heads and the cylinder block. ■3 r-J r-J rJ r-J r-J r-J r-i r-J r-J r-J r-i r-» r-J r-J r-J r-J r-J r-J r-J r-J r-J r-J r-J r-J r-J r-J r-i r-i r-J r-J r-J r-J r-J r-J r -J r-J r-J r -i r-J r-i r-J r-J rJ rJ r-J r -J rJ rJ rJ r -J rJ r-lr-n ^ I o■ m ^rJrJrJrJrJrJr-Jr-irJrJrJrJrJrJr-JrJr^rJc : PISTONS.

The inlet and exhaust valves, which are of nickel chrome Steel, are situated side by side. The valve and tapper guides are renewable. The adjustable tappets are of the offset mushroom type, and ensure even wear. The valve gear is totally enclosed, efficiently lubricated, and very quiet in operation. CRANKSHAFT. A nickel chrome Steel forging, ac curately finished by grinding, and carefully balanced. The crankshaft is supported in seven white-metal bearings, and is up to Lloyd's and B.O.T. requirements as to dimensions and material. The total length of the main bearings equals approximately one-third the length of the shaft; any tendency to vibrate and whip is thus eliminated. INLET AND EXHAUST MANIFOLDS. The exhauSt manifold is detachable, liberally water-jacketed, and provided with large cleaning doors, and the indu&amp;ion system forms part of the cylinder casting. GOVERNOR. The governor is of the centrifugal spring-loaded type, and is totally enclosed. Running at half crankshaft speed, it operates direftly on to the throttle control valve. LUBRICATION. Lubrication is forced by means of a rotary gear type pump driven off the camshaft, which draws oil from the sump through a brass Strainer, and forces it to the main bearings and big-end connefting rods. The brass Strainer may be removed through the crankcase doors. A pressure gauge registers the oil pressure which is regulated by a relief valve. Surplus oil is returned to the crankcase by way of the timing gears. The valve gear and all other moving parts are amply lubricated. A large oil filler is provided with brass Strainer, and a dip rod is used for ascertaining the quantity of oil in the crankcase. OIL COOLER. An efficient oil cooler is fitted to the engine complete with all necessary water and oil piping and drain cocks. IGNITION.

Rigid iron castings comprise the top and bottom halves ; the bottom half is extended to form the lower part of the reverse gear casing, so that the engine and reverse gear form a single and compaft unit. Lifting hooks are provided, and webs are caSt between the bearers to prevent tools, etc., falling into the bilge. CARBURATION. Zenith carburettors are fitted to both petrol and paraffin models. On the paraffin engine, the carburettor is mounted direftly on an exhauSt heated vaporiser further to assist vaporisation of the less volatile fuel. The mixture on the petrol engine is drawn through the cylinder block (where it is partially heated by the water-jacket) to the inlet manifold. WATER CIRCULATION SYSTEM. The water pump is of the gear type, and is of ample capacity, ensuring an adequate cooling of the engine under the moSt rigorous conditions. The pump is driven from the governor shaft at half-engine speed. STARTING. The paraffin engine may be started instantly on petrol, and after a few minutes' running to heat the vaporiser, petrol is turned off and paraffin on. Ine hand-Starting gear is conveniently situated at the after end of the engine. ELECTRIC STARTING AND LIGHTING. An eleftric Starter of the C.A.V. 12-volt type may be fitted at an extra charge when required. The dynamo is placed in tandem with the magneto, and should the removal of the dynamo be necessary, the magneto may be moved into its place. The Starting motor is spigoted into the crankcase, and engages with a toothed rack on the enclosed flywheel. Eleftric lighting equipment may be combined with the Starter if required, or a lighting outfit without Starter can be supplied if preferred. Schedule of items included in the three outfits will be found on page 6. CIRCULATING WATER INLET.

He agreed to do so, and tne sail maker of H.M.^.Fowey measured the hoods on the Diana. These were removed the same day and handed over to the sail maker. I explained to Lieutenant Bromley that the ends of the after noods where they attach by cord to the hull are too high above the hull and need bringing down about two incnes. Lieutenant Bromley said that he would see tnat this was done. The hoods will be recovered by the 24th March 1936 when H.M.S.Fowey meets H.M.S.Shoreham in Muscat. The hoods will be handed over to Shoreham to bring to Bahrain where she is expected about the 28th March 1931. As regards price. Best quality canvas is to be used, and the cost will be Es# 40/- whicn I understand is cheap. The sail maker will have to recover the hoods in nis spare time on board and the estimated time for each hood is 28 hours i.e. a total of 56 hours for the whole job. Commander narvey thought that its. 40/- was a fair renumeration for tne sail maker. Therefore the total estimated cost of recovering the hoods is Rs. 80/- This was explained to and I understand agreed to by P.A. A bill will be sent by H.M.S.Fowey from Sharjah and also the address to which the money should be sent. 7z—^ L 4%,■ -w Telepiione Message. F^m - * Powey f To - P.A. Bahrain.

It may be necessary for me to apply to the Resident for a new motor launch in the very near future, as my existing launch, a very old Gardener, is hardly seawor-chy now. I know that you have designed for Bahrain a very successful vessel. Could I have particulars as to its cost, make, size of the hull, etc. and any other facts which you consider I should be armed with before finally approaching the Resident. Perhaps you might still ha^ copies of the design of the vessel you could send me which I would return.

This proposal was viewed with indifference 'by the P,A,, it would not be satisfactory to hire a launch for touring which are un^omfotable,dirty, unreliable, undignified, expensive dangerous and nbt always available. Rs 2,500 were considered to 'be an impossible figure to meet the expenses of the motor launch. Rs. 3000 was considered to be the minimum figure for hir^ns the sea launch however.
