He was called upon through the Shaikh of Shargah to restore the girl. He gave two insolent replies. In the first he said that tne girl was not with him and that he recognised no superior but God, In the second- after our proofs had been com municated to him - he said that the girl had died.

Prideaux, C.S.I., C.I.E. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. Punishment of the Shaikh of Fujairah (Trucial Coast). Sir, E» 2-b ' In 1901 this Shaikh, who is nominally a feudatory In continuation of my telegram Ho. 104, dated the 22nd April 1925, I have the honoui; to submit the foll- -owing report on the subject of the misdemeanours of the Sharqi Shaikh, Hamad bin Abdttllah, headman of Fujairah, and of the recent measures taken by me to get him punished. 2 . of the Shaikh of Shargah, refused to take orders from his suzerain and asserted his independenceThe Jasimi Shaikh was not strong enough to coerce his tubbulent subject and the position has remained unaltered since then. Colonel (now Sir P.Z.) Cox once visited Fujairah and warned Shaikh Hamad to walk warily. This advice, until recent- -ly he seems to have followed, and the Residency has had no occasion to complain of his conduct until recently. 3. Some months ago I received a complaint through the Political Agent.Muscat, from a Baluch woman residing in the % Sultan’s dominions that heVdaughter had been kidnapped, taken to Fujairah and sold to Shaikh Hamad. The latter was consequently called on, through the Shaikh of Sh«Egah % to restore the girl. He gave two insolent replies, denying in the first that the girl was with him and adding that he recognised no superior but God; in the second he stated2 « stated*.,after proofs of the girl having been there had been communicated to him*«*that the girl had died. I left the matter over for disposal during my winter visit to the Trucial Coast. 4. In the course of my recent tour in the R.X.M.S. ’’Lawrence 11 I arranged to visit Fujairah. The Senior Naval Officer in H.M.S. ’’Triad” was at Muscat, and H.M.S. 'Cyclamen” was at Henjam. 5. On my arrival at Ghallah (Kalba) Shaikh Said bin Hamad, the local representative of the Chief of Shargah, came on board the 'Lawrence” to see me, and I returned his • visit ashore. He is the father-in-law of both Khalid bin Ahmad, ex-Shaikh of Shargah, and Hamaltbin Abdullah of Fujairah. He provided donkeys for my two Arab assist- -ants, the Residency Agent, Shargah, and Khan Bahadur Haji Abdur Razzaq to ride over to Fujairah, about five miles distant, in order that Shaikh Hamad might be asked to visit me the following day when the 'Lawrence” anchored off Ghataifah, his coastal village, as I had some business to settle with him. 6. I asked Shaikh Said if he knew anything about the Baluch girl: he replied 'It is said that she died.' From other sources I have reason to suspect that Shaikh Hamad sold her to Bedouin of the interior and that he found himself unable to get her back. 7. Shaikh Said also told me that Shaikh Hamad was unlikely to pbey my summons. I therefore asked the Senior Naval Officer by wireless telegraph to join me. 8. Shaikh Hamad replied to my message the same night that he would not come on board the 'Lawrence' and that I must meet him ashore. 9. It is a rule well3qiown to all the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast, and a custom which has been in force for very many years that, whenever the 'Lawrence' flying the Resident’s3 Resident*8 flag, anchors off a port, the local Shaikh must at once come off to the Ship. In practice the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast generally also pay the first visit to the Commander of a Man-of-War. 10. Hext morning when we had reached Ghataifah, the Shaikh sent me a message that if I sent him a letter of safe-conduct, he would come on hoard. This I d-id, hut he then changed his mind. I then sent my Secretary ashore to see him, and to promise to remain on shore while the Shaikh was visiting me. This was also of no avail, and my Secretary reported that the Shaikh’s attitude was so truculent and obstinate as to leave no hope of a change in his demeanour, though he expressed his willingness to pay a fine for the girl. 11. In my opinion to have given way at this stage of the proceedings to the Shaikh over the matter of the visit would have seriously undermined the Resident’s authority over all the inhabitants of the Arab Trucial Coast. So long as our interests have not bean directly affected, we have allowed the Sharqiyin Shaikh to continue quietly in his attitude of insbtbordination, though he has in fact terrorized the people of Ghallah and Khor Fakkan, which still are governed by a Wali (representative) and cousin of the Chief of Shcrgah. Now he had in effect claimed that the customs and regulations imposed by long usage on the Trucial Chiefs and their subordinate officials do not apply that to him. It was obvious^His Majesty's Government could not allow this claim to go unnoticed, as it would remove from the control of the Resident a district containing seven or eight villages on the Shamailiyeh Coast. 12. The 'Cyclamen w reached Gharaifah first and Commander Baker, after an interview with me, informed the Senior Naval Officer of my views. Captain Leir then telegraphedfi ? telegraphed to Kis Excellency the Mxsdfc Maval Commander-in- -Chief for permission to bombard the fort of Eujairah and seize and destroy Shaikh Hamad * s property if necessary. This permission was at once accorded. * 13. At 10 a.m. on the 20th April notice, which was acknowledged, was given to Shaikh Hamad that, failing submission to my demands, his fort would be bombarded at 1 p.m. This bombardment, which was carried out from two 4-inch guns on H.IG.S. 'Cyclamen w and one 12-pounder on H.K.S. 'Triad', was continued for li hours, when the seaward faces of his three towers had been knocked down. 14. It is believed that there was no loss of life directly caused by the bombardment as the occupants of the fort had certainly vacated it. One slave was aaid to have been severely wouMed in the head by from a stone dislodged by a shell and a daughter-in-law of the Shaikh, who was dangerously ill, was reported to have died while being carried away. 15. After the bombardment H.M.S. 'Triad' and 'Cyclamen' — on information given by Shaikh Said bin Hamad — attached a dhow, the property of Shaikh Hamad, which was said to be worth Is. 10,000/-, at Khor Fakkah. This was released the next day as the Shaikh, on my return to Ghallah on the 21st, paid up the fine of Es. 1500/- imposed on him — Bs. 1200/- on account of the kidnapped girl, and Es. 300/- additional on account of the refusal of his villagers to assist the crew of the whaler of the ^ 'Lawrence' on the evening of the 19th April, when the boat turned broadside on to the shore close to Gharaifah in a heavy surf, and could not be righted until assistance arrived from the 'Lawrence'. I understand from Command -er Poyntz that the boat has become unserviceable from the buffeting which she received. I 16. I enclose copies of the correspondence which passed5 1 passed between Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah and myself. It j will be seen that I hare promised to return Ks, 1200/* if the Baluch girl is restored to liberty. 1 propose to keep liii .b bum in deposit li0*rs for a, ycax♦ Yhe Es. 300/- rec/overed on account of injury to the whaler I will be credited to Government at once. 17. io illustrate the benefit which the naval demon- ; -stration at once produced, I may mention that on my arrival at Ghallah, I received a petition from the Wall (headman) of Bibah (a Shargah village) to the effect that hostilities were proceeding between his people and the Shihuh Shaikh of Bai‘ah (a Muscat village though practically independ- -ent). One man on each side had been killed and the Bai‘ah Shaikh was threatening to destroy Bibah immediately after the close of Ramzan. I summoned the headmen of both oil board the A Lawrence” and gave them a strong lecture, after which they and their principal adherents sat down together out* -side my cabin, and after half an hour’s noisy talk agreed to bury the hatchet and to shake hands. The Shihuh Shaikh was at first in a very truculent! mood. I do not think he would have come on board to see me, if he had not been aware of the previous day's bombard- -ment. 18* In conclusion, I beg to express my sincere thanks to the Senior Baval Officer, Captain Leir, R.H., for his support of my proposals and for the effective means which he adopted against the reoalitrant Shaikh; also to Commander!

No.295 Dated 19th August 1925. A.C. I beg lo forward herewith a letter received from Shaikh Said bin Hamad the Shaikh of Halim, who helped in the case of Hamad bin Abdullah, chief of Fujairah by giving advice to ohe said Hamad to embark R.I.M.S. w Lawrence rt to interview the H©n ole the Political Resident. The purport of Shaikh Said’s letter is that after the men-of-war bombarded Shaikh Hamad s house and his sailing boat was taken in the*. Kb or Fakkan and Shaikh Said'bin Hamad brought Rs.1500 to the Hon’ble the Polit ical Res 1 dent ,«v when the Font ble the Political Resident left the Khor Fakkan Hamad bin Abdullah VlViA/L is b na° borne enmity towardsyShaikh Said and had began encroaching, upon him such as demolishing the Shaikh’s fort, the setting fire to some houses in Kalba and burying a well from which the people of Kalba and others were drawing water: Hamad, the Shaikh says, continually threatens him with doing.bad deeds in Kalba ani that for tires© behaviours of the said Hamad the Shaikh will find-it difficult td show his obedience and submission towards the British Government such as going on board H.F.S. men-of-war when they will call at Kalba. I have the honour to state that all which are written in Shaikh Said’s letter have happened through the mischief of Hamad bin Abdullah the Headman of Fujairah as it is reported to roe by some inhabliana of Fujairah Buch' as Persian subjects and others. Shaikh Said is^sensible man and renders complete assistance in all matters that take place ±xki in his district and whatever he is asked to do he does same immediately. Hamad bin Abdullah the Headman of Fujairah, as you are aware, is ' obstinate and his policy is not good. If you deem it advisable you may kindly write a letter to Hamad bin Abdullah to stop mischief against Shaikh Said, the Shaikh of Kalba; it rests upon your decision.From - Shaikh Said hin Hamadj.

T hog to state that ray neighbour's on the east rebuke ra© that I have shown obedience to you and interviewed the Hon’ble the Political esident and fined guns from my fort in honour, of the Hon’ble the Political Resident(adthough this.was a very little respect to him yet the value of presents (respects) depends upon the circumstances of the man who submits same) that I have ifak complied with the orders of H.M’s Government, and have not taken action for the non-delivery of sailing boat in the -fher.Fakkan. They have therefore openly retaliated upon me and perhaps you have heard same since,for instance they have • ■ ^ m * m **™ *—- j i attacMed a.fort I have built near my palm garden in my summer resort for the purpose of protecting ourselves‘against robbers and the Bedouins, they have demolished same and have burnt its doors and all wooden beams which were about it; they'have also ruined the well dug in our boundary since the past five years for the benefit of travellers so that I may be deprived of the rewards I would get from God for same; they have likewise burnt, down the house of the Baluchi whom I sent with you to Fujairah as a punishment for his deed and with his house 15 '©ther houses with the furniture they contained are burnt down. Fot content with all this that they have done they continually send me threats saying that they w411 certainly spoil double ©f what have been spoiled by the men-ofwar at Fujairah, stating that T have been the cause of the damages occurred to them and that I. have striven to bring same about. They threatefi all my subjects who may take arms to defend me and threaten the \ » f Minx, merchants that their claims against their/subloots shall not &lt;7 be paid unless they pay a heavy sum. These they do with a view tofiumiliate me so that 1 may not again obey H.m’s Government \ . i* but by their own will and agreement, his their aim shall not be achieved because I am not a man like them who have become puffed up at the forbearance of the Government towards them f orgetting ...that t hey Mm i 1 la to themselves rather than baffling5$ t’n© %T@rpsi6r?t' the limit of whose power, they thought, was what happened.

On the 23rd Rabiaiul Awal=/£»-/0-^5” X received a letter from I the said Shaikh Said stating that he has sent the letters(sent for despatch)through one All bin Ahmad iruila Husain Shargah and a Resident of Kalba to Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah and that the said COndtJ messenger has/back telling him that Shaikh Hamad of Fujairah would not give an answer to the letters sent to him. I beg to forward here! with,in original,the letter addressed to me by Shaikh Said bin Hamad On the 26th Rabia-ul-Awal,however,,T received a reply from Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah of Fujairah as well as an answer to your * s. T beg to submit them all herewith for your information. He says that Shaikh Said has constructed a godown and a well in a place beyond his territorial limit and that the Shaikh of Braimi has intervened bet- ween him and Shaikh Said and has caused a reconciliation and that he(Shaikh Said) has permitted the Shaikh of B r afmi to demolish the / ' ’' r ’ godown. This is a thing,! beg to state,that has not taken place, and I have not heard about it. ■ shaikh Hamad’s reply,however,shows that his action in regard ’Ij ' - ' to the godown and the well are correct and it further proves that he has committed the. burning down of the place be is said to have burnt] I again'wrote him a letter under Ho 359 dated 27th Rabia* ul Awal i?44=/6-/0-a5 saying that the question between him and Shaikh Said bin Hamad and what he (Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah) says has not been done by him are things which seem to have happened as it is infer/ed from the purport of his letter and that he has buried the well because it has not been in territory of Shaikh Said bln Hamad. j|that the well has boen in us© siriceTpast seven years and people have been talcing water from it and he has not mad© any protest against its existence in the past and that it is only now that ■' ■ ■■ ■ t ' ■ • C: M h© has protested about its that the godown is in reality situated within the limits of Shaikh Said’s territory and that what he fcas don® are things quit© 'lip.own and nothing of it is hidden.I have further said.to him that I do not like that such things should be don© by him against Sahikh Said bin Hamad and kcvvQaJU that he should paa^po^e a friendly policy towards Shaikh Said was. that if he follows my advice he should satisfy Shaikh Said by giving him some compensation that I cannot send any Shara* official without making reference to your Honour first on the subject. The reason is that no Shara’ official agrees to $© to Puja l rah. One thing,however,could *b© done and that is that Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah should ±k visit in person or to send am attorney to represent him to any of the Trucial towns such as Umm-ul-Qaiwain, A.lman-or Debai where Shaikh Said must also appear and then to present themselves themoolvoo before a Shara’ Law Court and to agree to any decision given in the case. Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah’s demand for a Shara* official to. visit Puja^irah is an excuse,as I think it to be,b©cause nb Shara* officialfever visit Fujairah neither he,himself,will go nf Shy-where for judicature. I understand that Shaikh Hamad 'bin Abdullah has prevented.his subject from keeping up now communication with Kalabah and he/alma-eit fighting Shaikh Said - bin Hamad and the latter Shaikh has also prepared himself to meet him.

Tile Superintendent has shown me a eopy of your telegram No,395 of today's date regarding the Fujaira-Kalha dispute. In compliance therewith I am writing the following • notes which wall he sent you under flying seal through Major Barrett, I would like to point out that I took no part in the negotiations and effaced myself when the question was discussed in my presence. This will explain any omissions or irrelerameie in what follows, lighting took place between Fajaira and Kalba on the outskirts of Kalba during Kamadhan, Kalba was the weaker side and secretly solicited the imterrention of Saiyid Hamad him Faisal, Jali of Sahar* and brother of the Sultan* The latter despatched a deputy to the scene and arranged a 45 days truce. Immediately following Eamadhan, the Sultan set forth on his tour to Sahar and Shumailiyah. This trip had no designed connection with the Fujaira-Kalba dispute. The programme of tour had in fact been drawn up two months earlier with my assistance as I was due to pay a Yisit north to farm 1926-27 Zakat and establish new customs posts in the Shumailiyah. The ;|{ Sultan’s party including myself arrived im Sahar on 23rd Ipril llj when by a coincidence the Fujaira-Kalba Armistice was drawing near to expire. On 1st May the Shaikh of Kalba took 3 the initial || I . H! iff step. He with 32 followers' came down to Sahar to request the 111 Sultan’s adjudication in the dispute with Fmjaira. H.H. nointed | . ijj|W out that his*i.e. H.H’s mediation had small chance of success unless a similar invitation came from the other side. Three days later this other invitation arrived. It was brought by hand of the Shihuh Shaikh of Dibba, Salih bin Muhammad, an ally of Fujaira’s, though subordinate to the Sultan of Muscat.The non arrival of the Shaikh of Fujaira in person was regarded as an indication of Fujaira's doubtful desire for a genuine settlement. The Shaikh of Kalba and the Fujaira emissary having said their say, departed from Sahar for their rival camps. The Sultan at this stage despaired of peace, hut i his attitude was one of unconcern. No Muscat interest, he said,| would he damaged hy the gmarrel taking its normal courser he was in no sense ambitious to arbitrate. On 19th May our party moved up to Abu Baqra according to programme. Here events were 1 to prove more propitious. We were met by the Shaikh of Fujaira |l -his first visit to Muscat territory for ten years,- drawn thither no doubt by fear of Kalba having got in first and Gu) won a powerful ally by advancing of one side of the case. The j Shaikh of Fujaira cordially invited ms to visit Fujaira and be j | his guests.*That same evening the Shaikh of Kalba arrived and :| pressed a similar invitation upon ms to visit Kalba. H.H. replied that so long as discord divided them he would decline 111 their hospitality. Both Shaikhs then invited him to make a settlement, and the evening of* the 19th and the morning of 20t3s||| were spent in conversation* Agreement ?fas reached on 20th and ;j^ signed by all parties. A copy of this agreement is not enclosed!I as it already appears to have been seen by you.On 22mdwe visited Kalba and on 23rd Fujaira, our reception was friendly at both places. At Fmjaira we found some,half dozen shaikhs of the Trucial Coast, who had arrived that day. They included Sultan bin Salim Shaikh Has al Khaimam Ahmad bin Ibrahim Ua al Qaiwain I J|| Abdul Bahman bin Saif « Himriyah Abdullah bin Ahmad, brother of ex-Shaikh Khalid of Sharjah. Their presence occasioned the Sultan momentary surprise. its ostensible object was also to make a settlement* jjijfl As however two months had elapsed since the outbreak of hostilities, this eleventh hour interest of close neighbours seemed strange. This H.H. told me he thought was a little by- ill I play: they had came at the bidding of Fajaira as am answer to3 I) ■)_ P f t&lt;3 KalUa's Kttseat gesture. On learning the details of the !' settleaent they expressed their approval and readiness to give their support, and left .the same day. H.H. was of opinion that n j Fujalra*s expectation of help from that charter was a little ] splaoed.as the honds of kinship 'between the Quwasia would ! j i outlive any policy of temporary e:q?ediency E.G., the support H of the ShaVyiB by the Truoial sections. The issues is the dispute were maislj two (1) the insistence by Jujaira t hat Kalb* has no 'haras' i.e., is an isolated town without rights to adjacent territory. (2) th ® Sanctuary readily afforded by one Shaikh to the .enemies I of the other Shaikh. What led up to the collision is Hanadhaa was briefly as follows. .4 man of some stasdims helos £ ia S to Kalha became 1 discontented with the treatment he received at the hands of the || Kalba Shaikh. He thereupon betook himself to Fmjaira where he soon enjoyed the favour of the Shaikh of his new domicile. His subsequent business visits to Kalba he made occasions for vilifying the Kalba Shaikh. The latter suffered it for a time but finally turned him out of Kalba and forbade him ever to return. This roused the ire of the Fujaira Shaikh under whose protection he was now living. 4 bloodless vendetta ensued : each Shaikh boycotted the followers of the other and forbade them fishing or diving in his waters. Meanwhile the Shaikh of Kalba built a 'godowm' in a garden on the road to Fujaira: and the Fujaira Shaikh Shaikh conceiving it to be a veiled fort, smote and destroyed it, alleging at the same time that Kalba ha no right, in any case, to build outside town limits. See (l) above. This was the signal for hostilities. Military defence works were taken in hand by Kalba, and the forces of Fmjaira came down and invested the gardens close by. The usual Arab warfare took place and by a kind of poetic Justice one of the three casualties was the Kalba deportee, who seems to have been the w Mutaharrak”. H.H's enquiries persuaded him that the cause of the trouble was perhaps not to,? be found in these 'aineidehts4 imcideats imaediately leading mp to tlie fightirng, *but to deep seated ill-will. Tke two triDal disputants, tHe Qmawasim M (Kal-ba) and the Sharaiyim (Fujaira) are he said hereditary *, enemies hetweem whoa there has been aueh 'bloodshed. Im the past when the Sharqiyim were comparatively weak, they looked to Muscat for succour- the Dihha-Pujaira alliance is perhaps a relic of the time when the'Joasmis w were universally feared. The position is now reversed. For some years the feud between I the. two parties has lain dormant as a result of the marriage of i the Shaikh of Fujaira to the daughter of the Shaikh of Kalba. The past few months have brought back the old mutual suspicion and distrust. The Fujaira Shaikh, H.H. told me,fancifully nurses the grievance that it was the Kalba Shaikh whose activities set in motion the measures which brought the wrath of Government upon Fmjaira last year. H.H's settlement of the surface quarrels- however equitable, and based on consent of || both parties- may not, he felt, entirely dispel this atmosphere of mutual distrust. I take the liberty of sending four photographs which 1 fis I took at the time and may be of interest.

I have attached a rough explanatory sketch whfeh may make the letter intelligible. The situation is not new. Yours sincerely, f Sd. Betram Thomas.I!^rom Hamad bin Paisal, Wall of Sahar. To Council of Minister*, Muscat* Salaams, I am always informing you of the plunder which takes place in these parts• Two years ago you were informed of the injury arising from Wadijqor. H 0 action has been observed on the part of the Government• The subjects are suffering. The Government must protect them and must keep their property safe from any harm. A raid took place a week ago when the messenger of Wali of Shinas, who is*freeborn man of B e ni Hadrami of Samail was kidnapped. This is of course separate from the plunder of camels which took place during this month* The total number of persons kidnapped during this month and that of the last month is 5 and about 15 camels were plundered. The event extends and at all costs we cannot help but do something to protect the subjects. As the circumstances cannot at present be looked into, unless the Wadi of Qor is obstructed, the events have proved necessary for us to proceed to Ras-al-Khaima to discusj the matter with Shaikh Sultan bin Salim and confer with him on a certain point consonant with the welfare of our subjects and 1 have resolved to proceed in the beginning of the month of Jamadi-al-Awal appearing to the commons that my tour is an unofficial friendly visit t§r the Shaikhs of T rU cial Coastfe. I shall have to undertake the trouble of expenses and that of the way with a view to securing the subjects which are sold like sheep. I pray for myself to be successful in settling^probleras and as there are some more cases concerning these parts to be dealt with in Ihibai and Sharqa, my tour will have to extend from Ras-al-Khaima to Dubai and will take a period of one month.

A rain on the 15 th Ha jab 154.5 (gist January If *7) Sbaihb Sultan bin Sagan called me ard showed me a letter which he had received from Shaikh Said Mr Hamad which I beg to enclose herewith for your information. The object of Shaikh Said is that the Chief *of Sbarcab should help him by sending his brother* M&amp;.lid bin Saqar to Kalbah. The Shaikh of Sbargab expressed to me the fact that he wants to send his brother, just mentioned, together with some men from Sbargab and Bedouins by the sea to Kalbah in two boats, T irfor*med him that the despatch of such a force by the sea is prohibited, but that he can send his men by land to which there is no objection. Shaikh Sultan told me in reoly that the valleys or the way to Kalba are all ir the hands of the Headman of Fujairah and that there is no route by which one can reach Kalbab except by the sea. I therefore told Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar that T will report about this to Tour Honour ard whatever you reply, I shall inform him accordingly in due course.

Also one woman wlwao was killed by the followers of the Headman of Fujairah; I bear further that both sides have cut down date trees and other fruit trees such as lime trees and I marero^palms etc and that losses sustained by the two sides ar*e enormous and that such damages continue. According to reports that reached me the Chief of Has ul Khaim? has sent 5000 rounds of* ammunition to Shaikh Said bin Hamad and that the Chief of Shargah has sent 4000 rounds of ammunition Headman to the Huai of Kalhah. The Shaikh of Has ul Kbaimah sent his brother Shaikh Muhammad bin Salim to me to enquire as to whether the High Government has got any objection if he would send some men of Uy duo ruLcu his subjects /to assist bis cousin i.e. the Headman of Kalbab. I told him that the despatch of a force to another town by the sea route is prohibited. Shaikh Muhammad bin Salim replied that the intention Is rot to send/force to occupy a fo^elgr towr ‘O (*AaajcL&gt; but that they their own town; Kalhah.

I beg to enclose herewith the Shaikh.of Shargah’s letter in original for your information, •‘•’he Shaikh is always asking me for an answer and permission (to send a force by sea) as there is a fighting between them. I reported the state of affairs in my letter Ho.71, dated the 23rd February 1927, enclosing a letter from Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Chief of Ras ul -Khaimah, to the address of the Hbn’ble the Political Resident and since then the fighting is existing between the Shaikhs of Kalba and Fujairah and there have been casualties and losses on both parties. The Shaikh of Fujairah could not defeat»the Shaikh of Kalba but,if as stated by the Shaikhs of Shargah and Ras ul Khaimah^the Shaikh of Bai’ah is supporting the Shaikh of Fujairah ; the Shaikh of Kalba will become in trouble and will lose his territory. The two Shaikhs of Qawasim intend to support their cousins the Shaikh of Kalba, by sending stores etc by sea as,they have no way to Kalba by land. In order to save the poor subjects of the Shaikh of Kalba and Fujairah and also other men whom the Shaikhs of Ras ul Khaimal and Shargah intend to send to Kalba for fighting, the best couse, in my opinion is, that a peace should be effected between them. Decision rests with you. Letter dated 12th Rabi II, 1346, (9-10-27), from Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar, Chief of Shargah, to the Residency Agent, Shargah. A.C. I beg to state that I have received a letter from Shaikh2 ^7 ► Said bin Ahmad, Chief of Kalba, saying that Hamad bin Abdullah A1 fiharqi has been aggressive to him since the last few months and now Salih bin Muhammad A1 Shehhi is supporting him and both of them have surrounded his town with the intention of occupying it. You are aware Shaikh Said is my cousin and our territory I is one and we never agree that some other people take possess- || ion of our districts. During all the last period I was think- I ing that some of the Shaikhs might arrange a peace between them but on the contrary the affairs are getting worse. You conveyed to me sometime ago the Hon’ble the Political I Resident’s orders that none of the Shaikhs is allowed to send a force from one town to another by sea. I now intend to send stores and ammunition to Shaikh Said bin Ahmad by sea and I request you to send me an answer before the occupation of the territory of my cousin by the A1 Sharqi and A1 Shehhi.Ho.

Sheikh Said bin Hamad at once came onboard and informed me that although a state of war still existed between him and A1 Fujairah, there had been no fighting for the previous 10 days, both parties suffering from exhaustion. I gathered from him that the casualties during the fighting had not been so heavy as generally reported. Fujairah had lost about 7 killed and some wounded and Kalba wounded only. He was most anxious for peace. 3. I sent a letter to A1 Fujairah (Enclosure No.l) and received a reply from him on 11th November (Enel: No.2). On the afternoon of the same day the Residency Agent and Khan Sahib Mohamed bin Salem, my Interpreter, interviewed A1 Fujairah and reaffirmed my demand that a plenipotentiary should be sent on board if the Sheikh was unable to come off in person. To this Fujairah: demurred and negotiations were temporarily broken off. 4. At sunrise I repeated my demand through the Residency Agent and this time the Sheikh assented and next day sent on board a duly authorised representative and one of his councillors (Enclosure No.3). I then discussed terms with both parties and finally a Treaty (Enclosure No.4) was agreed to and signed. 5. I considered it desitable also to warn both Sheikhs as to the consequences of future disregard of the terms of the Treaty (Enclosure No.5). 6. I should like once again to emphasise the good work done by Khan Bahadur Isa and my Interpreter.

Xt appears that the Naqbin, a tribe nominally under suzerainty of Kalba had been quarreling with Salah* s people. They had burnt 3 of Salah*s dhows and damaged wells etc, so in retaliation Salah had appropriated a dhow belonging to the Naqbin. An armistice of 4 months imposed by the Sheikh of Umm-al-Qawain who had come over for the purpose of settling the dispute, was fctill An force, so taking into consideration all the circumstances I refrained from interfering more especially as the Shahu tribe are at any rate nominally a dependency of Muscat. As regards the pearl diving Salah admitted the charge, but in his turn complained that the people in the pearl dhows were constantly stealing his goats, cutting down his trees for fuel and committing other minor depredations. I consider therefore that he was but justified in protecting his own property but at the same time I ^ took the opportunity of warning him that he should on no account interfere or attempt to prevent pearl diving in waters of the Ras al Jabal. This he promised to do and in any further cases of this sort Sheikh Rashid consented to adjudicate. Both Sheikh Salah and Rashid gave me the impression of being well disposed towards and anxious to assist the Government in every way. Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf.mmFrom The Besi&amp;ency Agent, Shargah. i To The Hon*tie the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf. No.544 Bated 20th Novemter 1927 A. 0 With reference to your letter No.230, dated the 20th I October 1927, and your telegram No.1112 warning me of thel arrival of the S.N.O. by Triad on the 9th November in connection with the affairs of Kalba and Fujairah, I beg I to state that the S.N.O. arrived at the same date and I went on board the ship. The Triad left Debai for Shargah where Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar came on board and paid a visit to the S.N.O. and the question of Kalba and Fujaira] was discussed. Afterwards the -ship £eft Shargah and I arrived at Kalba in the morning of the 10th November. Shaikh Said bin Hamad, Chief of Kalba came on board and informed the S.N.O. of the condition of the fighting between him and the Shaikh of Fujairah. The S.N.O. wrote a letter to the Shaikh of Fujairah which was sent ;! to him by my son. A copy of that letter is enclosed 'herewith. My son informed me on his return that Shaikh I Hamad bin Abdullah, Chief of Fujairah, was suffering froml Diarrhea and that he wantc# to see me. It was arranged ' '' I that the .Shaikh should come to the village of Gharaifah on the sea shore on the 11th November. I landed ashore | # 1 and went to the house of the Shaikh of Kalba and as was arranged I went the next day to Gharaifah where I met the Shaikh of Fujairah. I discussed with him the question of peace between him and the Shaikh of Kalba. The Shaikh of Fujairah said that the building which had been built in the town by the Shaikh of Kalba during the fighting should be demolished. I Said that he hai no right to ask for demolishing buildings in the town but if the building was outside uhis territory the S.N.O. would have ordered for its demolifcic At last the Shaikh of Fujairah promised that he would consult hisrelatives and subjects at&gt;out the peace. . ■ ' I I returned to Kalha and saw the 'building about which I the Shaikh ©f Fujairah spoke to me. I found that the 'building was for the purpose of preventing the huts 'being set on fire. The Shaikh of Fujairah had. in no way any right to object about this building because all the Shaikhs of the Oman Coast and the interior build towers and walls for the protection of their twons from enemies* On enquiry from the Persians about the wall built by the Shaikh of Kalba I found out that when there was fighting between Fujairah and Kalba the people of Fujairah used to enter the town of Kalba at night time and burn the huts and thus 40 huts were burnt at Kalba. For this reason the Shaikh and his people built this wall in order to prevent their houses being burnt. I returned to the S.N.O* and informed him of my conversation with the Shaikh of Fujairah and of the enquiries made by me from the Persians. In the morning of the 12th November I interviewed the Shaikh of Fujairah at Gharaifah and after a long discussion he expressed his inability to come on board owing to his sickness. I pointed fut that if he could not come on board personally he should send one of his sons on board the Triad with full authority to make peace between him and the Shaikh of Kalba. He therefore appointed his nephew named Shaikh ' ' ! Abdullah bin Hamdan and wrote to the S.N.O. about his appointment. A copy of the letter is enclosed herewith. We all went on board and a peace was made between r the Shaikhs and an agreement wad drawn in duplicate as per copy enclosed herewith. One copy was- given to each of the Shaikhs who all expressed their gratitude to the S.N.O. On the 12th November 1927 the S.N.O. left Kalba for Daba and on his arrival there he sent my son to Shaikh Salih AlShehhi at Bai’ah who came on board in company with Shaikh Bashid bin Ahmad bin Sultan, Chief of ijr i P &amp; r 0 E o ■ ' /?/ The S.N.O. informed Shailch Salih of the peace which was patched up 'between the Shaikhs of Kalha and Fujairah and warned him that he should not make any intrigues against the Shaikh of Kalha hut should adopt a satisfactory attitude towards him. ‘ If he dees an unadvisahle action the High British Government will, take him to task. The Shaikh expressed his loyalty. I hfeg to forward herewith copy of a letter which the S.N.O. addressed to the Shaikhs of Kalha and Fujairah in connection with the peace warning them that if they hs^SsSc' the peace and causeT the visit of any of the men-of-war to their places the High British Government wE^^hold them responsible. It is hoped that there would he no more fighting between the Shaikhs after this peace.

I informed Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar of this matter. I and the Shaikh wrote to Shaikh Said bin Hamad not to build and to leave making intrigues, a copy of these letters is forwarded for'your information. I received an answer from Shaikh Said bin Hamad which also is forwarded herewith, stating that he has not erected any new building but that he has built a shed on a well near the tower situated within Kalba boundary and that he is not making any building. I then received ,a letter from Shaikh Said bin Hamad to the effect that Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah’s tribe have killed a man from his tribe and he was Amir of the village Daqta. He was killed purposely by those people without any crime. I forward herewith the said Shaikh's letter for information. I wrote to Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah, copy of which is herewith enclosed for your information. I received two letters from the Shaikh of Fujairah which are sent herewith stating that he had no knowledge about the murder of the Naqbi and that he would agree to whatever Shaikh Said ’bin Hamad proposes. But the murdered man was a friend of Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Chief of Has ul Khaimah. I wrote to the said Shaikh and I enclosetLerewitti copy of* this letter and reply received fronn Shaikh Sultan hin Salim, Shief of Has ul Khaimah, for your information. He states that/ the murdered man was a friend of Shaikh Said hin Hamad and that according to Arabs rules he should receive out of regard for his dignity one half of the blood-money as the murdered man was an Amir on his behalf in the village of Daqta which is under his jurisdiction. I beg to state that' the Shaikhs of Kalba and Tujaira have not 1 acted up to the persuations made by Captain Perry, S.H.O., in his, letters dated 12th November 1927 and now each of them has his men under arms.

I informed you that he went ||1 up to Beni Amr and made an agreement %ith them and returned If with a view to make a building. He is now building SMd and neither abides by the Covernment correspondence and orders nor by the letters of the Sultan Sayid Taimur. You neither believe us nor trust in the letters of the Oman Shaikhs. The said person alleges that all these matters are agitated you otherwise had he been afraid of you in such matters he would have obeyed the Covernment orders. But as it is his wishes are elevated and the Covernment orders are disrespected. I therefore request you to detail somebody on your behalf as we are weakened by you and the Covernment.

Shaikh Abdullah (Shaikh Hamad) informs me that you went to Batinah Coast to Beni Amr and asked them for a few men to come^to Kalba to your assistance. When the Beni Amr came, you erected a new building outside the town. If you. have done so, this is contrary 4- 4- V. i S«N*0# up the agreement concluded hy the It. and will cause displeasure of the High Government with you. These instigations on your part are not advisable and I therefore inform you that in accordance with your acceptance of the agreement, should there be a dispute between the parties it should-be notified to us so that investigation be made about it. Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah sent Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamdan to me especially for this matter. I therefore advise you that you have no right at all to build outside in order to blockade the road on the people.

I trust you will heed to these advices and will not involve yourself in a matter which would be improper for your dignity. U.E. Letter undated from Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar Chief I— * '' ' ' ' — . of Shargah to Shaikh Said bin Hamad bin Hayid Alqasemi Chief of Kalba. A.C. I received a letter from Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah Alsharqi through his nephew Abdullah bin Hamdan and am also informed by K.B. Isa bin Abdul Latif to the effect that you have uselessly constructed a building. 0* my dear, the best thing for you is to leave off thesedisputes and it is 'better for you to do so. I do not see^ any 'benefit for you in intrigues. Your tri'be is poor and they will, in this way, 'be deprived of their earnings and the times are hard. What I want from you. is to abide 'by what was arranged be tween, you by K.B. and the S.1T.G. and leave off the building for the present until we are free from our works and then someone will come to you o n my behalf and s omebody on behalf of the Khan Bahadur and the matter of building will be investigated into. You should accept our views as we are doing our best for you. and if you do not agree to this then you shall have to blame yourself. In fact we do not wish you such affairs that may weaken you and the father, Khan Bahadur has, in reality, never failed in the past and at present. Insha’allah you will listen to what mentioned to you and reject the advice of the interested persons whose object is to put you in trouble. Also some of the Persians residing at Kalba came to the Khan. Bahadur complaining about your highhandedness. O' my dear, we do not find any advantage in oppressions; be kind to them and overlook from somethings. This would be good for you. Do not refuse those who want the Shara It* and by this way your position willstrengthened. They also complain for not recovering their rights. I hope you will not neglect them and others. In fact as we heard before ; these persons have not failed to you ^nd one who does good should be rewarded for his good actions.

I received your letter and noted what you mentioned particularly that Shaikh Hamad had sent to you his nephew Abdullah bin Hamdan who says that I went to Batinah Coast and saw Beni Amr. Yes, every body goes for his own personal object. Friends do visit each others. He can also go1 Hi mu where he likes. If there is any hlame against me or himself | you should explain so that I may comply with your wishes. He mentioned that I have erected a tower outside the town. I have not huild any thing except the old tower. A little clay had remained and this I used in making, a shed on a well which is in front of the tower. You mentioned that I have no authority to do any thing for the present until you will finish with the divers affairs when you will send someone to inspect the place, it is welcome. I am under'God’s command and your orders and shall do nothing even if ordered to keep auiet for ten years. If you order us to go out from' our houses we shall obey as we have good hope in you. I heg you not to-heed to what they say and had I not heen afraid of prolonging this letter I would have mentioned their actions towards us hut on arrival of your representative|i the facts will hecome clear to you. The letter sent hy Shaikh Sultan hin Saqar is received and we will never disobey your orders. U.E. Letter dated 5th Moharram 134? (23-6-2.8) from Shaikh Said hin Hamad, Chief of Kalba, to the Hesidency Agent, Shargah. A. C. j S ent you some letters and hope they have reached you hut no answer was received. I hope the cause of silence is good. I inform you about the affairs of the Sharqiyin. You put the blame on me while they had closed the roads and voilated the conditions of the agreement. They prevent ed us from goipg to Bathna and they also closed the road leading to the Hejdiyin valley with stones. When I noticed this from them I ignored it and did not like to write lot of letters to you hut asked my people to pass by other way. Now a hoy of my tribe pass.ed by this road as he’was misled by one of the Sharaiyin who told him that he would pass him through and there was no danger to him but when he was pass ing crossed the town, a noise was raised behind him and hewas anested. They took his arms, luggages and she-eamel and released him next day on seeing that we took no action. j| But they did not allow him to proceed to East and sent him hack to West. He crossed the mountains and reached Eujairah ; where also he was 'molested hy Hamad*s servants who plundered i him and took off his money. He reached here tired with fatigue having passed the round on foot. News has also heen received today that the Sharqiyin have murdered Ahdullah hin Khamis, one of my trihe, Shaikh of Daqta. Notwithstanding this we have not taken any action in order to obey your orders and those of the Senior Naval Officer. This is what has happened and you should look into it. I shall send for the Naqbiyin and ask them not to take any action. But the road is closed between us and perhaps I shall send this (letter) by sea. U.E. Letter No.328 dated 8th Moharram 1347 (26-6-28) from ■ 1 S the Besidency Agent, Shargah, to Shaikh Said bin Hamad, Shaikh of Kalba. a. c. • ■ • •; I received your letter and noted what you mentioned regarding the boy and murder of Abdullah bin Khamis A1 Naqbi. In fact this is one of the calamity. I have written to Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah about these matters and will see what he has to say. In fact murder is a matter of great importance but you should not neglect guarding your own town. We wrote to prevent him from making instigations. You should keep patience because this is the time for your people to go to diving as - they are indebted to the inhabit ants of the Coast on account of diving. U.E. Letter dated 8th Moharram 1347 (26-6-28), No.327, from the Residency Agent, Shargah, to Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah, Shaikh of Fujairah.A. C. 7 / If ^ 1 m i i I have received a letter dated 5th Moharram 1347 (23-6-28) from Shaikh Said hin Hjamad, Chief of Kalha, to the effect that a man named Ahdullah hin Khamis A1 Naq,hi Amir of village Daqta, a dependent of Shaikh Said hin Hamad came to your tribesmen of Al-Masafi as a guest and that after they treated him with the hospitality and he left the village, the said people killed him after five minutes without any cause. Killing a guest is a disgrace among all Arab tribesmen and others. When this news was received l)y you, you collected your tribe and captured the village of Ghui^aifa which is opposite Kalba and also ordered them to occupy the valleys and a part of the mountains. In fact I was surprised to observe this treatment from you towards Shaikh Said because I see that you do not think over your actions nor about your people who are all divers and indebted to the .inhabitants of Oman Coast and this is the time of work and earning. But I see that you are fond of intrigues and trouble as if your town is a Syrian town and not a village of poor people. You sent to us your nephew Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamdan saying that Shaikh Said did so and so and I asked him to stop erecting any building and he obeyed, but now your tribe have killed his friend, Amir of the village of Daqta. What is more serious than murder. This is an evident proof against you. I do not think that the Sharqiyin could do any thing without your approval. O' Shaikh Hamad! in fact you do not fear God as this action on your part viz killing of a Muslim without any crime is contrary to Law and human laws. Now accept my advice, do not heap further proofs against yourself and leave off instigations 'and sit quiet. If anything would happen from you, you will of course be dealt with. U.l. Letter dated Moharram 1347 (June-July 1928) from Shaikh Hamad hin Abdullah, Shaikh of Fujairah, to theIff Residency Agent, Shargah. 1 / A. C. I received your letter and noted what you mentioned therein from beginning to end. ¥hat has been mentioned by Shaikh Said to you should not be heeded to because he is one of the interested persons and he misrepresents matters to you and to others., He has misreported matters to you in order to make you angry with me. Had he any power over us he would not have allowed us to live in this world. With regard to the man who was murdered, I had no knowledge about it. But this was decreed by God. He was related to Shaikh Sultan bin Salim and I received a letter from him. He asked us to refer the case to Shara we are obedient and we gave a promise to do so at Khat village. I wish you to send somebody on your behalf as he will return within 2 weeks. Please do not listen to misstatement from interested persons who misinterpret matters to you and your opinion is better than that of others. U.E. Letter dated 20th Moharram 1347 (8-7-28) from the Residency Agent, Shargah, to Shaikh Hamad hin Ahdollah Shaikh of Fujairah. A.C. I received your letter and noted what you mentioned about the murder of the Naqbi, you say that you had no knowledge till it took place and that the murdered man was Shaikh Sultan hin Salim’s friend and you received a letter from him'. Please note that in accordance with Shaikh Said bin Hamad’s letter and the statement of the Naqbiyin who came to Shargah, the murdered man was a' protege of the said Shaikh who entered into the peace which was effected by the S.N.O. As this murder which was committed by your men, is a transgression and yourEn IV olDject is only to upset the peace made 'between you and Shaikh Said for an object you have in mind, I therefore advise you to be quiet as it is better than intrigues and troubles as the consequence of riots is not good for all. And hereafter Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar shall send his brother to your side who will be accompanied by a man on my behalf for the purpose of investigating the affairs between yourself and Shaikh Said bin Hamad. U.E. Letter dated 12th Moharram 1347 (30-6-28) from Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah, Chief of Fujairah, to the Hesidency Agent, Shargah. A.C. I sent you a letter with the messenger of Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar and you must have acquainted yourself with its contents. According to your order, God willing, we are standing for truth and the orders are with God and then with you. About the man who was murdered, he was murdered without our knowledge. He was killed by the Bedouins who never consulted or informed us. We the Shaikhs or our tribe had nothing against him. Shaikh Sultan bin Salim wrote me a letter. I shall deal with him way . . pfc in anyone likes. If he wants Shara we will give'him, and if he wants accounting, to that also I will agree. Which ever of these ways he likes, it will be undertaken through you. The opinion is with God and with you. Please excuse me because I have no covers. We went to stony place and did not get any thing. U.E. Letter No.372 dated 28th Moharram 1347 (16-7-28) from the Residency Agent, Shargah, to Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Chief of Ras ul Khaimah. A.C. I received a letter from Shaikh Said bin Hamad Q haikh fof KallDa regarding the murder hy the Sharqiyin of Ahdullah hin Khamis Naq.'bij Amir of Daqta. I wrote to Shaikh Hamad hin Ahdullah about this irregular action committed by his men towards Shaikh Said’s man. A reply has been received from Shaikh Hamad to the effect that Abdullah bin Khamis the murdered man was your friend, that you have communicated to him on the subject and that it was arranged to meet at the village Khat for the settlement of this case. Will you therefore explain as to whether the murdered man, Abdullah, was your friend or was he Shaikh Said bin Hamad's subject. I request you to intimate to me the fact. U.E. Letter dated 2nd Safar 1347 (20-7-28) from Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Chief of Has ul Khaimah, to the Residency Agent, Shargah. A.C. I received your letter and noted contents. You mentioned that a letter was received from Shaikh Said bin Hamad regarding the murder of Abdullah bin Khamis, Amir of Daq.ta, by the Sharqiiyin, the followers of Hamad bin Abdullah Alsharqi. Yes, the said man had been a Naqbi, a tribesman of Shaikh Said bin Hamad, but I had appointed him as Amir of Laqta on my behalf because Daqta is my dependency and not that of Shaikh Said. When this incident occurred I wrote to Hamad bin Abdullah about what necessary for him to be cleared of the guijt in the usual manner and he replied ”what is necessary for him to be cleared of the guilt' hence the case was kept pending. But the murder and transgression concern the Naqbiyin and Shaikh Said also is under your own and that of Government.From xlj r Ho No.428 A.O. © 1 © Residency Agent, Sliargah. The Hon’hle the Political Eesiderit, Persian Gulf. Bated 22nd August 1928. ¥ith reference to my letter No.394 dated 25th July 1928^regarding the case of murder hy the tribe of the Shaikh of Fujaira of a man of Shaikh of Kalha, I 'beg to forward herewith a letter which has been received by me from the Shaikh of Fujaira to the effect that Shaikh of Kalba*s tribe have killed one of his subjects. I communica ted with the Shaikh of Shargah on the subject and beg to enclose herewith a copy of my letter for your information. I received an answer from the said Shaikh and two letters from the Shaikh of Kalba and all the letters I transmit to you for your information. Enquiries made by me in the case show that the followers of the Shaikh of Fujaira had already killed a man without a reason which would make liable to murder and.now the relatives of the murdered man killed one of Shaikh of Fujaira**8 subjects. When this news reached the Shaikh of Fujaira he arrested four men, subjects of the Shaikh of Kalba, and the followers of the latter captured four men from Shaikh of Fujiara*s tribe* The trouble is now brewing between Kalba and Fujaira. The Shaikh of Kalba came to Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar in this connection. The latter sent his brother, Shaikh Majid, in company of the Shaikh of Kalba in order to guard him on his way to Kalba. At present the Shaikhs of Oman Coast and the inhabita nts talk that no confidence was observed towards the peace concluded by the Senior Naval Officer between the Shaikhs of Kalba and that of Fujiara, that Shaikh of Fujaira rejected it by killing a man, subject of Shaikh of Kalba^ and that in addition he arrested four men of Kalb a.

U.E. Letter dated Safar 1347 (July-August 1928) from Shaikh Hamad hin Ahdullah, Shaikh of Fujaira, to the Hesidency Agent, Shargah. I a A.C. I heg to state that on Thursday the 22nd Safar (9-8-28) two men of Naqhiyin raided and killed a man at the town of Safad about which I informed 2 months ago. This case was not settled by Shara and you promised that somebody would come oh your behalf. The claim due from us to Shaikh Said is pursued and those due to us are not pursued. I did not make a present of Hs•500/- to Shaikh Hamad binlbranim and Jlbdur Bahman bin Saif and it should be recovered. I have forgiven as regards the slaves taken at Sur. Last year X had dates and dates trees at Kalba but it was taken away. There was some dates belonging to SaQ.ar bin Salih and some belonging to the slaves and these were also taken away. A sum of Its.70/- was due from Bin Hanifah since a long time but this was seized by Said bin Hamad. It is unfair that claims due from us be recovered and our claims are not recovered. According to your order I deem it necessary to - inform you of this case. With regard to the father Abdullah bin Hamad. I could not do anything and orders are with God and yourself. The dates was taken after I had written to Sayid Taimur bin Faisal, also the money. As regards Shaikhs Hamad bin Ibrahim and Abdur, Sahman bin Saif; a letter was received from him bearing his signature and seal. What you decide I do not disobey. tf.l. ■hmhmhmLetter No.411 dated 26th Safar 1347 (13-8-28) from the Residency Agent, Shargah, to Shaikh Sultan 'bin Saqar, Chief of Shargah. A.C. I have just received a letter from Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah 11-Sharql stating that Shaikh Said bin Hamad*s tribe have killed one of his subjects named Muhammad Al-Haj 1 Amir of the village of Safad. I herewith send his, letter through my man for perusal. In fact the action committed by them at this juncture is undesirable and I have submitted)!: all the facts about Kalba and Fujaira to the Hon*ble the Political Besident. I have already asked you to arrange for one of your ‘A?'-:V; 1 ■ brothers to go with one on my behalf to Kalba and Fujaira and settle .the disputes between them, but you delayed tAe case by promises till the Naqbiyin killed a man of Fujaira. I hope that there should be no further trouble. I am again submitting a report to the Hon’ble the Political Besident. 'TJ.E. Letter dated 29th Safar 1347 (16-8-28) from Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar, Chief of Shargah, to the Besidency Agent, Shargah. A.C* '■ ■ I beg to state that I received your esteemed letter intimating that a letter has been received by you from Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah A1 Sharql to the effect that the Naqbiyin, Shaikh Said bin Hamad's tribe have killed Ibn- Alhaj of Safad. I perused Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah's letter and showed same to Shaikh Said bin Hamad. Shaikh Said was very sorry for what had taken place and up till now no letter or news is received by him about this case. Shaikh Said considers that this action has been committed by an idiot without consulting his friends because he has4 My emphasised upon them not to oommit any improper action. Now I II | 111 1 J I that arrangement may he made for settling this case and I shall perform whatever you consider necessary for Shaikh Said. As to what you mention that you have always 'been emphasising upon me to send one on my 'behalf; I had intended to send my hrother Majid 'bin Saqar, as has already heen intimated to you, j hut *whan Shaikh Said arrived, delay occurred in doing so, hut I did not change my mind about it and as you are aware accident occurs against one’s wishes. I now reguest that this case may he settled as I fear the violence and transgress-: ' ' ' l ion of Hamad Al.Shargi on Shaikh Said hin Hamad’s trihe. Please let me know as you are aware of the Shargi's attitude. TJ.E Letter dated 28th Safar 1347 (15-8-28) from Shaikh Said hin Hamad hin Majid, Shaikh of Kalha, to the Besidency Agent, ' ■ i Shargah. A. 0. I received your letter and noted what you mentioned especially that you received a letter from Shaikh Hamad Al- Shargi in which he mentions that my trihe the Naghiyin have killed Ihn-Elhaj of Safad. I have not, as yet, received any riews nor a messenger has come from Kalha, so I am greatly surprised and doubtful about this. When I was there I was watchful and had impressed on them not to do any improper action. Had this happened a messenger would have come to me from Kalha. This case was kept pending for you and as you know a tribe will never he without an idiot. If this proved to he correct, I am sure this concerns a stupid fellow. I was very sorry to hear this because I do not like it and in reality I became greatly annoyed. I now reguest you to issue orders to the said Hamad to stop violence and transgre ssion as settlement should he made by you according to law and justice. I never transgress the right. I always write letters to the Chiefs of Naghiyin warning them against5 improper action and I have no douht this accident has been committed hy a stupid without consulting his friends. I am now ready to act according to your order and I request you to enlighten me in this connection. ISiings occur against wishes. With regard to the claims and complaints mentioned in his letter: these are not correct and most of them have i no foundation. Some of them are three or four years old and an agreement has since heen drawn. We have more than what mentioned 'by him hut did not bring same to your notice as the agreement put an end to all these claims. This man*s object is only to bother you and his affairs are based on injustice and transgression as it is known to you. TJ.E.

I beg to inform you that I am on the point of journey to my place and Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar is sending his brother, Shaikhs Majid bin Saqar, with me in order to discuss with Hamad the question of those parts, the valley etc. With regard to the news given by Hamad A1 Sharqi, a messenger came to me confirming the news of the murdered man of Safad but they could not find out the murderer. Hamad A1 Sharqi captured four men of Naqbiyin who were their guests at Fujaira and they are now in prison. God knows in what condition they are. The Naqbiyin also captured some men from Hamad's tribe about which I deem necessary to let ypu know. U.E.iMUmbe o llrr.i PROiil. ..... The Senior Kaval Of ficer,Persian 'ffUHf 10 The Political Resident,Persian Gulf. {2 Copies to Coimaarider-in«Chief,Bast Indies Station). DATE, 16th August 1928 No. 44.B./32 On 17th July 1928. while the Senior Naval Officer in H*il.S. TRIAD” was anchored off Ohallah Kalba the Sheikh of Kalba came off to pay his respects. After the usual compli mentary conversation had taken pl^ce the Sheikh said he wished to complain that his neighbour the Sheikh of A1 Fujairah had broken the treaty of peace made between them and witnessed by the Senior Naval Officer on 12th November 1927. It seems that only a few months after the treaty was made the Sheikh oc A1 Fujairah allowed his people to go into the country of the Sheikh of Kalba cutting wood and damaging trees without permission. This was recently fol lowed by an incident in which a man from Kalba was killed by a party from A1 Fujairah. The Sheikh of Kalba is a poor man with but little property and cannot afford to finance a war against A1 Fujairah and consequently relies upon the British Government to defend him against his powerful neighbour who,on the other hand,as is notorious on that part of the coast,is a more powerful and wealthy chief recognising t|p overlord and behaving with contempt towards the British. ; ''As a matter of incidental interest it may here be remarked that the affair of 1925 in which the Sheikh of A1 Fujairah had his town bombarded and was forced to pay a fine of Rupees 1500,e nded with the laugh definitely onjiis side for the bombardment did neither him nor Els' any' mate rial' damage and he forced his poor'neighbour of Kalba to~ pay the fine. 2. To comfort the Sheikh of Kalba the Senior Naval Officer promised to return in twelve days to carry him to Shargah so that his complaint could be dealt with by the Residency Agent. 3. On 28th July accordingly the Sheikh of Kalba was embarked and on Monday 30th July at Shargah,Khan Bahadur Isa bin Abdul Latif the Residency Agent came on board. He informed the Senior Naval Officer that both Sheikhs had written letters complaining of each other to him. He had intended to send his cousin together with a brother of the Sheikh of Shargah to investigate the matter but the Sheikh had said he could not assist until all the men of Shargah were settled again after the Pearl and Date Seasons. It was after the writing of the letters that the murder of the man from Kalba took place and the Sheikh of A1 Fujairah had sent to the Residency Agent denying complicity or respon sibility but admitting that the murderer did belong to his town. The Sheikh of Kaiba2. 4. The Sheikh of 1C alba left H.M. S. 'TRIAD' with the Residency Agent who said he had hopes that he would be able to deal with the matter effectively according to Mohammedan I»aws. 5* On 15th August the Senior laval Officer received a message from the Residency Agent to the effect that he had had a letter from the Sheikh of A1 Fujairah saying that a relation of the Sheikh of falba had now killed a man from A1 Fujairah. 6. H.IIUSavy is unfortunately concerned in troubles between j these two Sheikhs because in the Treaty referred to above the statement occurs that if in consequence of their actions | the Great Government has to send a ship to their territories they will be liable to bear the cost,and for this reason it is betteV that H.M.Ships should visit their territory just now 'by chance' rather than 'by order'. Owing however to the large number of other and more important duties upon which the Senior Naval Officer has had to employ the Ships of the Persian Gulf Division during the past few weeks,it has not been possible to send a ship to 1C alba again. ~f+ tf*— • | 7. There is another and more important side to the J independent attitude displayed by the Sheikh of A1 Fujairah. I When investigating the recent slave-running case( Senior J Maval Officer's Letter No.43E of 17th July 1928) it was ( conclusively proved that the slaves were landed at Gherefa, | which is the port of A1 Fujairah. Evidence was at the same J time received that slaves are being landed there with moderail frequency and that it is in all probability the only pofet on the Batihah Coast now used for the purpose. The attrac tions! of a port owned by an independent minded Sheikh are Lobvious^and the Senior Naval Officer strongly recommends that when a suitable opportunity is afforded this Sheikh be ds.lt with in a really effective manner and that when that occasion arises the lesson of 1925 should not be forgotten.

'Triad' delivered to me a Note in which the Honible the Political Be sident ordered me to write to the Shailch of Fujaira with regard to his dispute with the Shaikh of Kalba and his capturing four persons of Kalba. I wrote to the Shaikh of Fujaira uncle r No.452, dated 26th Babi I, 1347 (11-9-28) a copy of which is herewith enclosed for your information. I received a reply from the Shaikh of Fujaira which. I beg to enclose in original for your information. He states therein that we want him to release those captured by him from the Shaikh of Kalba tribe, that what would be the result of this affair and that justice be taken from him for the Shaikh of Kalba. The 'Shaikh of Fujaira, however, does not wish to release the prisoners and the statements described in his letter are mere gossips. On my arrival at Has ul Khaimah I made enquiries from some of the Shihuh who stay in mountains abput the claim of the Shaikh of Fujaira for the murder of a man of Safad, which he mentioned in his letter which was submitted to you with my letter No.428 dated 22nd August 1928. The man who died was suffering from Epilepsy and he had gone to a well to draw water where he got the disease and' fell down into the well and no one came to know about him till after three hours when some people 4 came to draw water from the well there they found the man in the well. The Shaikh of Fujaira therefore claimed that the tribe of the Shaikh of Kalba had murdered and thrown him into the well. The tribe of the Shaikh of Kalba deny having done'so. There are 20 men of the notables who take oath that they have'not killed the said man or 20 persons of the notables of Shaikh of Fujaira tribe should take oath that the Kalba tribe have killed2 the man. The’ Shaikh of Tujaira does not accept these alternatives, 'between themselves 'but arrested 4 men in place of the sick man. This .depends upon your decision to, do what you think proper for doing away with the Shaikh of fujaira’s intrigues. U.E.

According to news received by me while at Has ul Khaimah you have not released them and they are under a painful punishment with you. In fact I was not expecting of you that you would not agree to my advice. I am therefore directed by the Hon’ble the Political Besident to inform you that His Honour has been tired of communication between you and the Shaikh of, Kalba, and that he has heard that you have arrested 4 persons who are subjects of the Shaikh of Kalba and he is displeased to see this state of affairs between you and the said Shaikh. And* moreover, if in the meantime he heard that you are making intrigues and mischiefs he will no doubt be prepared to prevent and check them. Therefore, 0* Shaikh, accept my advice as I am one of your well wishers. t 1 It is better for you fo release those whom you have arrested unjustly and to leave off the intrigues and riots which are prevailing be,tween you and the Shaikh of Kalba.
