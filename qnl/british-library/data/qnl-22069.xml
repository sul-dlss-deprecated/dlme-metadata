I trust this will fill your require ments but can let you have details covering any specific phase of our activities if you require them. When the final Reports are received back from New York, I shall have pleasure in sending you copies as has been done in the past. Yours very truly, Acting Chief Local Representative THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITEDauLieaarise the activity of the Bahrein Petroleum Oompany Limited on Bahrein Island during the year 1940. Oil production was maintained at a satisfactory rate, which was practically constant throughout the year. No new processing plants were installed In the Refinery during 1940. Slight alterations were made to several plants to keep their capacity in line with the main refinery. Operating and maintenance practices have been standardised. The following report gives tabulations showing the number of ee^ployoes, status of wells anti, the number and type of builtiings. The map attached shows the location of fells, Pipelines, Refinery, Pump Stations, Roads and miscellaneous minor installations. centrateu on further development of the Firnt Pay (Ofbitoidea) outside the previously recognised producing aroa. Three new wells were drilled, am one abandoned hole re-entered in an attempt to expand the known areal extent of First Pay production. As a result, one important well was completed v nearly two miles south of previous producers. While little £ 1 ^ ,oil has lean obtained from the other three, further experimentation in acidizing technique may result in marked production Increase from them. Four structurally low First Pay wells drilled in 1939 but on production tests at the end of that year, hare been complete*, as small but satisfactory producers. Ho further development of the Second Fay was undertaken during the past year, other than the completion of tell No. 69 after a prolonged series of tests performed to determine the effects of mud and cement on the producing horizons of the Second Pay. As a result of these tests, valuable information was obtained regarding the detrimental effects of these materials and the methods requires to counteract such effects. Surface connections and equipment on all important wells in the field have been altered to provide better protection. p&amp;PAin In line with the policy of providing adequate protection in our oil reserves, major repair programs were completed in two wells in order to correct unsatisfactory mechanical conditions. The source of water in another hole was located and plugged, resulting in the cornpletion of a well that had been an unsatisfactory producer. later sources in two other wells were investigated; am repair operations on Uie basis of those findings are being started in one well.Ifcrlnc 1940, Ui© fiolu produced a total of 7,073,919 'barrels of oil, a daily average of 19,328 barrels. Throughout the year, oil production was held close to 20,000 VX&gt;t except for two weeks emergency period in October and November, during which the majority of the wells were shut in. the reservoir has continues to improve and that pressure decline is under satisfactory control. This situation has been aided in the First and Second Pays by m&amp; injection the uniform field withdrawals of the past year, and our established method of distributing those withdrawals among wells. QQ&amp;.lltiQQMm- through ^ell Ro. 62 and into the Secon. Pay through fell Ro. 63, lias continued through the year, tho gas supply being obtained, as previously, from Fourth Pay Zone E through 3ell :io. 51. Injection rates into the two pays have fluctuated between approxir-ately 3,600 M.C.F. and 5,000 il.C.F. daily and have averaged approximately 4,300 k.C.?. The relatively minor changes in rate have been made in order to balance similar fluctuations in oil withdrawal. Injection volume continues to be regulated on the policy of replacing approxiisately half the reservoir volume of the oil withdrawn. Besults to date indicate this rate to be satisfactory. Studies show that pressure distribution within Gas injection into tho First Bay (Orbitoldes)L4&amp;L.;&amp;tor ^rvgroachraent: iator production for the year has averaged 723 3/D with a daily arwrag® of only 581 / in Decwmhar, as coaQparsd with 840 ?y^D in January. although these figures represent a declining rate, individual well studies show that the volume of edge water production is increasing slowly but stoauily, as is to be expected. The decrease in water output of the field has been brought about by production manipulation and repair in certain of the larger water producing wells. 7arious special studies of the past year have increased our knowledge regarding the position of encroaching elge water and have contributed materially to a scientific control of water encroachment. As reported last year, with very few exceptions, the great majority of wet wells produce only small amounts of water that have little bearing on reservoir conditions but necessitate special treating care in order that clean oil may be shipped to the Refinery. ^jMJUTXQN car ^dirio:iAL In accordance with agreements entered into between the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Bahrein Petroleum Company, the Company has conducted (luring the past year extensive exploration operations within the dominions of the Sheikh particularly outside the previously leased area. Marine geophysical investigations have been conducted over a considerable portion of the area of the Gulf in the vicinity of Bahrein Island. In addition, eight holes have been drilled for structural information on the rim of BahreinIsland, on adjoining islands, and on specially constructed ^ piers placed in the Gulf. The program of exploration 'by structure drilling is being continued# 1 ork lias not advanced to the point where final conclusions are Justifies.ITo new opera tins facilities were installed during the year.

Police Strength on 1-1-1940 31-12- Indians 6 6 Arabs 341 329 Followers 25 35 372 370 Naturs:- Man amah 70 66 Muharraq 54 61 Manamah Defence posts 21 21 124 148 No new police were recruited during the year and 12 men left on discharge and completion of agreements. Two police clerks were enlisted. The police posts at Awali, Refinery and Oil Fields were discontinued and special police were enlisted by the Bahrain Govern ment and given some training before being put under the command of the Defence Officer who from the time of his appointment became responsible for the defence and pro tection of the Bahrain Petroleum Company area. These Special Police are paid for by the Bahrain Government and are used solely for defence measures. The natur force remains unchanged. Throughout the year batches of naturs have been undergoing training with the State Police and have been taught a little drill and the use of rifles. In the past naturs received no training. Havildar Abdulkarim bin Haji Sulman returned from the Police Training School at Nasik and was appointed Sub Inspector of Police.There was a very small amount of crime during the year the most serious case being that of a rela tive of the Ruling Family who was convicted of treason and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. Motor accidents showed a decrease in comparison with previous years. It can be said that the state of public security in Bahrain is most satisfactory. There were no strikes, s or disturbances. 2. Administration. Major A.C• Byard, M.B.E., ceased to serve the Government as Assistant to the Adviser on his appoint ment as Defence Officer, Persian Gulf. No important changes were made in the administra tion. His Highness remained in Bahrain during the summer so no council was appointed. Shaikh Abdul Latif bin Mahmood, one of the Sunni Kadis, retired from his duties on pension owing to ill health after serving for about ten years. 3. Pearl Industry. The 1940 summer season was a bad one and the catch was small and the market, except for some activity in India, was stagnant. No important buyers visited Bahrain and the Kozaibi firm sold less than half of the large purchases of pearls which they made during 1939. The advances were as follows:- Diver Puller Tesqam Rs 25.0.0 * Rs 20.0.0 Salaf 25.0.0 20.0.0 Khar jlQfljh 20.0.0 20.0.0 The depression in the pearl industry was to a slight extent offset by the Government’s building work which gave employment to stone cutters and boatmen, especially to those working on the Muharraq sea road extensionL •WPP' —-t-.. - 3 - 4. Public Works. The following important public works were comp leted during the year:- State Hospital. ' Womens Hospital and staff quarters. ’ f Mens ' w n rt Fort tower and main wall. Muharraq Sea Road Extension (Municipal). Road from Zinj to Suk al Khamis. ' n Fort to Ain Al Mishoom. Police post at Jaw. The following works were commenced during the year but not completed New Technical School. Gov 1 t Hospital, Administration Block (sugery etc). Manamah - Muharraq Bridge. 5. Municipalities. Manamah Municipality: The following road widening was carried out in the Manamah bazaar and Municipal area. A wide motor road was made from Naim to Telegraph Road entailing the removal of 6 shops and removal of frontage of 49 shops. A number of new roads were planned and laid down on the open land south and south west of Manamah town. About 5 miles of town roads were surfaced and oiled. 36,000 square feet of swamp land was filled with stone and 80,000 square feet filled with town rubbish. 700,000 square feet of land was surfaced with town rubbish on the swamp behind Mission. A number of shops cut for road widening, were rebuilt and several new shops were constructed as compensation. Town cleaning included the normal removal of refuse and much additional work during the floods. A number of new permanent drains were built including the drain from north of the Palace to the sea shore.Vegetable, meat and fish markets were supervised as well as the abattoir services. Ice was sold during the summer. The Council met 17 times and issued 95 decisions. Muharraq and Hedd Municipality: Muharraq Beladya continued its work in Hedd. The road from Customs to His Highness 1 House was widened. Meat, fish and vegetable markets were supervised. The Sea Road was extended as far as the school. A number of artesian wells and water places were repaired. The usual town services were maintained including road sweeping, removal of refuse and inspection of food markets and slaughter house. 6. Agriculture. There is little to report under this heading. The garden at Budeya was supervised by the Assistant Adviser until he ceased to serve the Bahrain Govern ment when it was taken over by the Public Works Dept. European vegetables including potatoes were grown successfully in the spring of 1940 and were sold in the bazaar. A herd of white cattle from Alwar were purchased by the State on the recommendation of the Hon T ble the Political Resident. It is too early to give an opinion as to the suitability of these cattle to Bahrain. 7. Electric Department. The undertaking operated continuously during 1940 with steadily increasing lo^ad and revenue curves until November 1940, when the load was curtailed owing to lighting restrictions (imposed under Defence Regulations). Connected load on 31st December 1939 was 545 K.W.Connected load on 31st December 1940 was 613 K.W. Maximum recorded load 1939 203 K.W. ' ' ' 1940 180 ' PoweMiouse generating plant capacity 400 K.V.A. The actual financial result of the years working will be shown on the annual statement at the end of the Arabic year (29th Dul Haj 1359 - 27th January 1941) and it is anticipated that there will be little,if any, profit owing to:- (a) The lighting restrictions. (b) The fact that a reduction was made in the price of electricity for lighting and fans (one anna per unit) thereby reducing the annual income from this source, by approxi mately Rs.11,000/- p.a. (c) Increase in the price of maintenance material imported from abroad. The approximate increase in revenue from the sale of electricity is Rs.6,000/- 1939 Rs.1,19 ,000/- 1940 Rs. 1,25,000/- Extension to mains etc . 1. A new high-tension sub.station was erected at Jufair Naval Base, complete with a 50 K.W. transformer and switchgear. The low-tension overhead line between Gudhaibia sub station and Jufair Base was converted to high-tension, ana guarded, all this work was carried out at the expense of the admiralty. 2. A low-tension overhead line was run along the new sea-road extension at Muharraq for lighting and general supply purposes. Thirteen poles were erected. The cost was borne by the Muharraq Municipality. General :- The wiring of houses by local contractors continued, approximately 650 points being added during 1940 as compared with 950 in 1939. The falling off was due to general trade depression owing to the wa#“ in Europe.Thirty five air conditioning units were in public service during the summer season of 1940. Telephone Department A new 50 line board was ordered in January 1940 but is not yet to hand, due to shipping delay. It is expected within the next month. Subscribers on 31st December 1939 - 80 ' ' ' ' 1940 - 87 Further applications are being received. 8. Administration of Justice. There has been no change in the composition of the Courts. The number of important cases heard in to be declining partly because owing the Bahrain Court appears/to the state of the pearl trade there are few diving cases. The Shia Shara Court, about which there was much complaints in the past, continues to run smoothly mainly owing to the wor&amp; of the Shia Appeal Kadi. No new regulations have been issued on judicial matters. 9. Education. Most of the changes and improvements made in Bahrain Education during 1940 had been completed before the end of May, and consequently were described in the 'Report on Progress in Government Education, December 1939 - May 1940”, copies of which were supplied to the Agency. The chief items of note since May 1940 have been as follows Manamah College, called here the Kulliyah, has been opened, as the sole Final Stage school in the Island, and some of the boys selected by competitive examination to fill it have joined as boarders - a new thing for Bahrain. With the opening of the Kulliyah, all Classes in the other schools above Class Six were abolished, and they have now become Infant Stage and Intermediate Stage school only. The whole of the teaching at the Kulliyah is given in English, the course is to be three years, and the entireseach year are limited to 33. This means that the school when full will contain about 100 boys, not more than 20 of whom will be boarders. The School of Hidd is now completely on a par with the two large schools of Manamah and Muharraq. The village schools of Budayyi* and Rufa T have been enlarged - that of Budayyi 1 very considerably. The village school of Suq Al-Khamis has been brought into line (as regards the teaching) with Budayyi* and Rufa*. This means that there is now only one Government 'Mulla school’* left in the Island - that of Sitrah. The girls* section of Rufa* School, has now been removed to separate quarters, and its numbers have reached 33. The new Technical School is now under construction, and its first wing is practically completed. This is a long.waiting-list for places in the new School, and the present small building is full to overflowing. Four more students from Kuwait have been accepted, this time sent at the expense of the Kuwait Government. Complete and thorough medical inspections have been carried out at the two large schools of Manamah and Muharraq, and at the Kulliyah. Treatment by the State Medical Officer of all cases requiring it is to follow. With the approval of the State Medical Officer, all schools under the Government have now been supplied with ample emergency medical stores. All Government school boys are now under medical supervision by the State Medi cal Officer. All Government schools in the Island have now been brought into a state of complete repair. The work has been done by a small party of travelling carpenters, ex students of the Carpentry Section of the Technical School.The arrangement has been entered into with the Palestine Government under which eight qualified masters of the Palestine Education Department have been seconded for service in Bahrain, for three years. These masters arrived last October, and have been distributed amongst the larger schools. Statistics relating to Bahrain Government schools.

Dear Sir, ANNUAL REPORTS Reference your No.C/59 - 8/8 dated the 16th January 1941, we forward herewith a summary of the working of Petroleum Concessions Limited for the year 1940, in duplicate. Yours faithfully, For &amp; on behalf of PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED MANAGER • Enel. ACM• • • CONFIDENTIAL PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED BAHRAIN SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR 1940 i. Qatar exploration - 1940 (a) l^ells and Drilling No. I Well was completed to its final depth of 5685 feet at the end of 1959 at which point a promising oil 'showing' was struck. A test was carried out in January 1940. During the year 1940 a certain amount of oil from this well was used on road construction and maintenance essential to the Company’s further exploration programme. No. 2 Well, 10 miles South of No.l, was commenced on the 18th June and by the end of December 1940 had reached a depth of 4798 feet and correlates fairly closely to No. 1. This test-well will be carried on as deep as the rig and circumstances permit. Preparations are in train for the commencement of No. 3 Well, a few kilometres North of No. 1. (b) Staff 8 British 5 American 28 Indians (clerks, artisans, servants) 300 Qataris. These figures do not include Bahrain staff, and must be for some time to come the base, port and link with the outside world for parties operating in Qatar. Qataris are at present being trained as drivers, rig workers and in semi-skilled labour of various kinds. There is no literate class and the clerical staff is almost entirely Indian. The Qatari worker is on the whole willing and amenable to camp discipline and gives singularly little trouble. This satisfactory state of affairs is somewhat marred by the heir-apparent and other Arab officials whose control of recruitment is guided by personal greed. Co-operation with the Government (in effect the Shaikh, the heir-apparent On an average, personnel in Qatar consisted of some 2 British 12 Indians (clerks and servants) 20 Bahrainis (clerks, peons, launch crews), employed for the most part on Qatar services as Bahrain is• • • and the Shaikh’s Adviser on Foreign Affairs) in employment matters is essential at this stage as there is no law nor order apart from the Shaikh and his bodyguard, and no other approach to the labour market would be countenanced. Apart from the annual concession payment to the Shaikh the Qatar people themselves benefited to the extent of some three lakhs of rupees in cash spent by the Company in Qatar during 1940. 2^ lakhs was expended in Bahrain for Qatar operations. (These figures, of course, do not include the cost of equipment and stores sent from London and America) (c) Qatar Terminal Survey In December 1940 a short preliminary examination of the coastal waters of the east coast of Qatar was made with a view to locating a 'terminal' for future oil export. More detailed surveys will be carried out in early 1941. (d) Company’s Communications (i) W/T. The Company has its own W/T. Station in Dukhan (Qatar) which has four short watches daily with Cable &amp; Wireless, Ltd., Bahrain. (ii) Launch Service The Company has two seagoing motor launches and runs a regular weekly service for passenger, mails and stores between Sitrah, Bahrain and Zekrit (Qatar). Security arrangements for these trips based on ' T /T. messages between Bahrain and Qatar are now very unsatisfactory owing to delay due to censorship regula tions. This will be remedied when radio-telephones are installed in the launches. (iii) Roads &amp; Tracks The tracks in Qatar are passable to motor vehicles with oversize tyres except for two or three days after heavy rain. The Company have found it advisable to improve and oil the road linking up Zekrit Jetty-Dukhan Camp and No.2 Well. The track joining Dukhan Camp and the Ruler’s head quarters (Dohah and Riyan) is mainly stony and hard and easily passable although rough. The distance is 62 miles and it takes 2^- to 3 hours. Until the full extent of the oil field becomes clear and a terminal site is located there is nothing on which the Company could base or justify a road con struction programme. This is mentioned as the Shaikh never misses an opportunity of pressing for road making schemes, to give employment to large numbers of his men and incidentally increase revenues from his system of registration fees and monthly levies on wages.• • • 3 (iv) Telephones Zekrit Jetty and No. 2 Well are connected to Dukhan Camp by telephone. The Shaikh has been con sidering a scheme to link up his house at Riyan with Dohah. The Company was asked to give an estimate and supervise the work. On receipt of the estimate the matter was left in abeyance until a later stage in oil operations when the Ruler hopes to find some grounds for suggesting that such telephone communica tion is in the interests of the Company. (v) 4ir In 1939 and early 1940 the R.A.F. and British Overseas Airways Corporation were interested for various reasons in aerodromes in the proximity of oil camps. Several possible landing grounds were examined but it was eventually decided that it was premature to construct aerodromes until the location and extent of the oil field became clearer and permanent camps and an oil terminal could be fixed. The khor at Zekrit could be used by seaplanes with the aid of a few buoys. (e) Water _ To date no potable artesian water has been located and as has been previously reported geological opinion rules out the possibility of any substantial supplies becoming avail- able. British and Indian staff use Bombay water purchased from B.I. boats. Bahrain water is provided for Qatari employees. During 1940 over 2,00,000 gallons of Bombay water and 6,00,000 of Bahrain were transported to Qatar. (f) Building Construction In 1940 considerable extensions of the buildings of Dukhan Camp were carried out which provided work for several hundred Qataris over long periods. A proper sanitary system has been installed and all classes of permanent employees are housed in stone buildings. A Customs Office (including living quarters for the Customs Officer) was built at Zekrit at Company expense. An extension to Zekhrit jetty was put in to give addi tional shelter to boats lying there. The Shaikhs take a lively interest in the Company’s building operations and are very much perturbed when they are completed and the figures of employment fall. British and American quarters are air-conditioned. (g) Health The climate of Qatar is dryer and healthier than that of Bahrain and this is reflected in the excellent health of all classes. The Company at present supplies free food on a high standard to all classes of its employees and this no doubt keeps them fit.• • • 4 It is of interest to note the rapid improvement in physique and work value of Qataris after a few weeks* Company messing. The Company employs an Indian S.A.S. based on Dukhan Camp where he has a small hospital. His services are in considerable demand by the Shaikhs whom he visits at frequent and regular intervals. The Shaikh has no medical facilities whatsoever at Doha or anywhere else in his Shaikhdom apart from this Company*s service. It is interesting to note that the Shaikhs are realizing the benefits of vaccination for small-pox and when an epidemic broke out in Arabia large numbers of Qataris (mostly relatives of the Shaikhs) were only too anxious to be done. There were no epidemics in Q^itar during 1940. (h) Security Security was excellent. None of the Company convoys or personnel was molested and travelling in Q^atar is probably as safe as anywhere in the East. The Company employs some thirty odd of the Shaikh’s personal adherents as guards distributed over the camps at Zekhrit, Dukhan and No.2 Well. The guards are supposed to accompany all vehicles moving out side the camps. In Doha, Company’s foreign personnel are not supposed to walk in the streets or bazaar unless in company with one or more of the guards. There is little doubt that the Shaikh finds it convenient to keep up a pretence of insecurity in order to justify his contention that it is necessary for the Company to pay and maintain a large number of his followers. In early days he talked glibly of over 1000 men under the command of his son, Hamid, and doubtless dreamt of a private army at Company expense. Crime in the Company camps except for petty thefts of wood tools etc. is practically unknown. The culprits are usually the Shaikh’s guards who are ostensibly there to prevent such irregularities. The Company enjoys a great advantage in that its locations are very far removed from any villages or settled areas. It is contact with the local population which invariably leads to trouble, as far as the Company can observe the Shaikh’s relations with his neighbours (except for Bahrain) are very amicable. The Shaikh has a stock of at least 500 modern rifles with correspondingly large amount of ammunition but so far he has not found it necessary to take any rifles or S.A.A. out of the boxes. The Shaikh makes no effort to tax Bedouin nomads from Arabia entering his peninsula and passing the Company area. It is believed that he subsidises them with the result that they show no inclination to resent the presence of foreigners on their grazing routes. Certain of the Shaikh’s brothers and their sons are highly dissatisfied with their share of oil monies and this is a potential source of possible internal trouble. So far the resentment has shewn itself in the departure of some of the younger members to Bahrain where they seem to be assured of a sympathetic hearing. While the old Shaikh lives internal dissatisfaction is unlikely to become dangerous as although avaricious he commands respect.• • • 5 f f A settlement of the differences between Q^tar and Bahrain would prevent malcontents in Qatar both from the Shaikhly family and from the remnants of the tribes in the west from playing off one Ruler against the other in the hope of personal benefit. (i) Relations between the Company and the Shaikhs Considerable tact is necessary to maintain amicable relations. The Shaikh and the heir-apparent control recruitment and security. It is necessary to realize, if the position is to be understood, that the Shaikhs are by no means content to draw the annual oil monies and wait for the large oil royalties of the future. They are out to control directly or indirectly for personal benefit every branch of the Company^ activities from the engagement of a labourer to the hire of a launch or the giving out of a building contract. The Company has retained with some difficulty the right to pay its Qatari employees in full at the pay table and all attempts to involve the Company in pay deductions in respect of Qatar taxes have so far been resisted. By the end of 1940, in spite of such difficulties, it had become apparent that the early suspicion had been dis pelled and the Shaikh had implicit confidence in the integrity and good faith of the Company. It is also clear that, according to Arab standards, he considers that he is co-operating whole-heartedly with the Company. He is obviously genuinely surprised when,on occasion,he realizes that his efforts to associate himself more closely with the Company’s work are more embarrassing than welcome. Foreign personnel in the camps have few contacts with the locals and the Shaikh has had singularly little to complain about in their behaviour. 2. TRUCIAL COAST EXPLORATION - 1940. (a) Geological Exploration . Owing to conditions created by the war, previous plans to send geological and geophysical parties to the Trucial Coast in 1940 were cancelled and the various Rulers notified to this effect. In all cases the Rulers replied that the reasons for postponement were fully appreciated, and hopes for an early British victory were expressed. (b) Relations with the Shaikhs The Company maintain a house at Dubai and a Company’s representative from Bahrain (usually Mr. B. H. Lermitte) based on this house visits the various Shaikhs periodically. The Shaikhs in many cases use these contacts to press for large advances of concession payments or presents of cars. Amicable relations are, however, maintained without acceding to these requests. The Rulers of Dubai and Sharjah use the Eastern Bank, Bahrain, and the Company’s transactions with them are facilitated thereby.6 (c) Security Security on the Trucial Coast and hinterland as regards Company parties or visitors (outside the town limits) is unsatisfactory in that, although there is probably little or no real danger, there is definitely uncertainty. Conditions have not changed in 1940, and preparations for any future surveys must include preliminary security arrangements with the Shaikhs concerned, which experience in the past has shewn to be a very complicated affair. Once the machinery of a geological or geophysical party is set in motion delays due to liaison troubles are very serious and expensive.• • • / OONFIDSNTIAL PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED Bahrain SUMMARY OF OPSIUTIONS POR THE TE;,R 1940 1.

While the old Shaikh lives internal dissatisfaction is unlikely to become dangerous as although avaricious he commends respect.• • • T A - 5 A settlement of the differences between Qatar and Bahrain would prevent malcontents in Qatar both from the Shaikhly family and from the remnants of the tribes in the west from playing off one Ruler against the other in the hone of personal benefit. d) Relations between the Company and th e Shaikhs Considerable tact is necessary to maintain amicable relations. The Shaikh and the heir-apparent control recruitment and security. It is necessary to realize, ir the position is to be understood, that the shaikhs are by no means content to draw the annual oil monies and wait for the large oil royalties of the future. They are out to control directly or indirectly for personal benefit every branch of the Company’s activities from the engagement of a labourer to the hire of a launch or the giving out of a building contract. The Company has retained with some difficulty the right to pay its Qatari employees in full at the pay table and all attempts to involve the Company in pay deductions in respect of Qatar taxes have so far been resisted. By the end of 1940, in spite of sucn difficulties, it had become apparent that the early suspicion had been dis pelled and the Shaikh had implicit confidence in the integrity and good faith of the Company. It is also clear that, according to Arab standards, he considers that he is co-operating whole-heartedly with the Company, ne obviously genuinely surprised when, on occasion,he realizes that his efforts to associate himself more closely with the Company’s work are more embarrassing than welcome. Foreign personnel in the camps have few contacts with the locals and the Shaikh has had singularly little to complain about in their behaviour. 2. TRUCIAL COAST KXPIOR/iTION - 1940 . (a) Geological Exploration . Owing to conditions created by the war, previous plans to send geological and geophysical parties to the Trucial Coast in 1940 were cancelled and the various Rulers notified to this effect. In all oases the Rulers replied that the reasons for postponement were fully appreciated, and hopes for an early British victory were expressed. (b) Relations with the Shaikhs The Company maintain a house at Dubai and a Company’s representative from Bahrain (usually Mr. B. H. Lemitte) based on this house visits the various Shaikhs periodically. The Shaikhs in many cases use these contacts to press for large advances of concession payments or presents of oars. Amicable relations are, however, maintained without acceding to these requests. The Rulers of Dubai and Sharjah use the Eastern Bank, Bahrain, and the Company’s transactions with them are facilitated thereby.(o) Security Security on the Truoial Coast and hinterland as regards Company parties or visitors (outside the town limits) is unsatisfactory in that, although there is probably little or no real danger, there is definitely uncertainty. Conditions have not changed in 1940, and preparations for any future surveys must include preliminary security arrangements with the Shaikhs concerned, which experience in the past has shewn to be a very complicated affair. Once the machinery of a geological or geophysical party is set in motion delays due to liaison troubles are very serious and expensive.Confidential No.C/157-8/8.

(ii) In the last two or three years some of the younger members of the Shaikhly family, though not sons of shaikh Hamad himself, have caused considerable scandal by their drunkenness. His Highness therefore determined to deal firmly with them and has done so in the case of Shaikh Ali, son of Kia Highness 1 brother Shaikh Abdullah, by banishing him to the lonely island of Hawar fer a time. (iii) His Highness 1 brother, Shaikh Mohaared bin •Isa, unwisely boarded anJ| Italian ship from Alexandria to proceed to Beirut. The ship, however proceeded to Italy. Eventually he got to mlta and later arrived at Alexandria, from where he came overland to Bahrein. The reception accord— ed to him by the Family as war-battered hero was remarkable. 4.

The total revenue of this department was Ra. 1,81,648/- and the total expenditure Is. 1,64,683 /-. Gut of this Rs. 64,844/- was spent on establishment charges, a large figure for such a small undertaking. Accounts do not anpear to be prooerly kept in this Department.

Malaria, Venereal disease and Trachoma (eye disease) continue to be the main forms of disease. Trachoma is un doubtedly the most deadly disease in Bahrain. The anti- Malarial campaign accounts for the dec ease in malaria but the incidence of venereal disease is, if anything, on the increase. In the Government Hospital, the woman*s section was opened at the end of May and the men’s aide on June 15th, The Police Hospital, originally closed to in-patients, was opened in December as an Isolation Hospital for venereal disease and tuberculosis.(iii) Among other steps being taken to reduce malaria in Manama, the Anti-Malaria Committee have decided to arrange for the closing of all shallow wells in compounds within 200 yards of public artesian water supplies. ^’heso shallow wells have been used solely for washing purposes and their m numbers have grown enormously in recent years. They have been a prolific source o'* mosquito breeding. n ’he closing of these shallov. wells caused a great deal of agitation among the inhabitants. Meetings were accordingly held and, in order to fit in with a scheme for a real public water supply and for proper drainage, the six circles in which surface wells were to be filled in were reduced to a radius of 200 feet, while constant care was taken to 'ensure the supply of larvicidal fish in shallow wells in the rest of the town. (iv) The women *3 section of the State Hospital was opened by Her Highness Sheikha Ayesha on the 25th lay in the i. presence of a large gathering of Arab and European ladies. 17.

Visits oi’ - ppo ..ou-oI-js . (i) On the 4th April, General -iir Nuri as Oa'id, Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Shaikh Hafiz ’ahba, the Saudi Arabian Minister in Ix&gt;ndon, passqd through Bahrain in a Royal Air Force plane on their way to Ibn 3aud*s camp. Th« party was met by the Political Agent, the Senior Naval Cfficor in the Persian &gt;ulf, Shaikh Abdullah, Shaikh Salman and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and lunched at Shaikh Abdullah's house near the aerodrome. His Highness the Shaikh was indisposed that day. They again passed through Pahr in on the 7th spril on their way back to Iraq, ti.eir mission having been e great success. (ii) His Hoyol Highness the Arrr Scud arrived here from Al l hobf»r en route to Indio on the evening of the 19th April with some of his younger brothers. • He was received private ly at the Customs pier by His Highness and his Family. The Amir Saud vms ns charming as ever and expressed his and Ibn Scud'a gratitude for the arrangements mode by the Govern ment of India. He referred also to their strong sympathy 0 x X for /-- 14 - for the Allied Cause. (ill) Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid, Ruler of AJnan f arrived here on the 5th May on a friendly visit to the 3haikh of Bahrain. He returned to Ajman on the 20th Hay. (iv) His Royal Highness the Amir Sand arrived here from Indio by special plane on the evening of the 8th dune, very much improved in health. He was received at the aerodrome by Shaikhs Abdullah and Salman, the Advisor to the Bahrain Government and the Assistant Political Agent, th« Political Agent being absent from Bahrain. His Highness the Shaikh met the Amir at the end of the causeway and took him to the Palace. On the evening of the 9th June the Amir was enter tained by the Bahrein Petroleum Company. He left Bahr; in for A1 Khobar by launch on the 10th. While he was hero he expressed his gratitude for the assis tance given to him by the Government of India. 20. _£tar (i) The Petroloum Concessions (Qatar) Limited had their first small show of oil in their test well near 7ePrit to wards the end of 1939. In 1940, a further test was made by them and the results were most satisfactory. (ii) It is reooi'ted that a squabble occurred on the 30th Hay between minor members o*’ the ftnsim and Ahmad sections of the Qatar Shaikhly family. Shaikh Hamad, the heir- apparent, tried to turn this into a major issue and demanded that the Ahmad party sho Id either be disarmed cr deported. The Shaikh of Qatar held a meeting at which there vas a good deal of excitement, but it seoms probable that the whole matter has been settled without recourse to drastic action. Shaikh Hamad’s attitude was probably influenced by di ficulties /-Idifficulties following the distribution (or more likely the non-distribution) of the oil money which was paid by the Company on the 17th May* (iii) Shaikh Abdullhh bin Oaaim A1 Then!, Huler of Qatar, left for the Haj with his heir-apparent Shaikh Hamad and some seventy members of his family. His eldest son Shaikh All was in charge during his absence. 21. Petroleum Concessions Limited (i) atar exploration (a) Vs'ells and Drilling. No.l Well was completed to its final depth of 5685 feet at the end of 1939 at which point a promising oil 'showing’* was struck. A teat was carried out in January 1940. During the year 1940 a certain amount of o 1 from this well was used on road construction and maintenance essential to the Company’s further exploration programme. No.2 Well, 10 miles South of No.l, was commenced on the 18th June and by the end of December 1940 had reached a depth of 4798 feet and correlates fairly closely to No.l. This test-well will be carried on as deep as the rig and circumstances permit. Preparations are in train for the commencement of No. 3 ftell, a few kilometres Forth cf No.l. (b) Staff. On an average, personnel in Oatar consisted of some 8 British 5 American 28 Indians (clerks, artisans, servants) 300 ^ataris. These /-These figures do not. include Bahrain staff f 2 British 12 Indians (Clerks and servants) 20 Bahrainis (Clerks, peons, launch crews), employed for the most part on Patar services as Bahrain is and must be for some tine to come the base, port and link with the outside world for parties operating in atar. Qataris are at &gt;resent being taained as drivers, rig workers and in semi-skilled labour of various kinds# There is no literate class and the clerical staff is almost entirely Indian. The Qatari worker is on the whole willing and amenable to camp discipline and gives singularly little trouble. This satisfactory state of affairs is somewhat marred by the heir-apparent and other Arab officials whose control of recruitment is guided by personal greed. Qo-operation with the government (in effect the shaikh, the heir-apparent and t e Shaikh’s Adviser on Foreign Affairs) in employment matters is essential at this stage as there is no law ncr order apart from the Shaikh and his bodyfuard, and no other approach to the labour market would be countenanced. Apart from the annual concession payment to the Shaikh the Qatar people themselves benefited to the extent of some three lakhs of rupees in cash spent by the Company in Qatar during 1940. 2^ lakhs was expended in Bahrain for Qatar operations. (c) Qatar Terminal Survey. n December 1940 a short preliminary examination of the coastal waters of the east coast o£ Qatar was made with a view to locating a 'terminal” for future oil export.- 17 (d) Water To date no potable artesian water has been located and as has been previously reported geological opinion rules out the possibility of any substantial supplies becoming available. 2. Trucial Co ast Exploration. Owing to conditions created by the war, previous plans to send geological and geophysical parties to the Tnicial Coast in 1940 were cancelled and the various Ruler - notified to this effect. In all cases the Rulers replied that the reasons for postponement were fully appreciated, end hopes for on early British victory were expressed. 22. Foreign I nterests His xcellency H.A.

(i) During the month of January, Shaikh Mani* moved to c the Khawaniq from v/here he collected a force and attacked Dubai. He was defeated and returned to Sharjah, where he asked the Political Officer to use his good offices to se cure a settlement. fcani' and his party put forward terms which might have been dictated bv a victor and they were naturally rejected by Shaikh Sa’id in toto. After the breakdown of the negotiations, Shaikh I'ani* returned to the desert. On 10th February Mani* returned to Sharjah having disbanded his force. The Shaikh of Dubai then asked the Shaikh of Sharjah to turn out Wani* and his party and when he failed to do so, declared war on him. The Dubai Sharjah v/ar was mainly static, both sides lacking the courage to launch an offensive. But trade was interrupted and local opinion wa in favour of Rritish intervention. However, on 10th March the Shaikh of ias al Khaimah succeeded in arranging a three months* truce, which was followed by a general agreement. Since then, there has been no more trouble. (ii) On 29th September Majid bin Khalfan assisted by the Shuwaihat of Bani Ka*ab attacked Hatta, a village in w ich he had formerly been the Shaikh of Dubai*s representative. He captured the Shaikh*s present representative and took possession of the weaker forts. A force of 60 men led by Shaikh Maktum bin Jum*ah was despatched from Dubai and as soon as Shaikh Maktum reached Hatta, Majid bin Khalfan released his prisoners nnd fled. (iii) On 15th November disturbances occurred at Diba be tween the Tawasim and the Shahuh, the letter being subjects of /-Political Agent, Bahrain of Muscat. The cause of the dispute was thrt t he D^ple of Diba Hisn accused the Shahuh of kidnapping one of their boys* This allegation was foi nd to be false and the Shahuh annoyed at being falsely accused, indulged in burning the Qawasim houses and cutting down trees. A few casualties were sustained. Through the mediation of the Wali of Khasab and the Shaikhs of Fuhairah an i Bakha, the trouble was settled on the basts of ” 00 ^^*, except that a tower erected by the Diba Hisn as a direct result of the disturbances was allow ed to remain. 10.

(c) Number of major operations .... Nil. (d) Number of minor operations .... 635. The figure for Malaria is 3279 and for Venereal Desease 189. Patients suffering from the latter desease are mainly treated by local Hakims and are usually un willing to undergo regular courses of treatment. Malaria shows an increase of 35 cases for 1941 as compared with 1940, but this is mainly due to old and chronic cases relapsing as they never take the complete course of treat ment . There were 120 cases of Small Pox (oflicially reported) with 18 deaths. All cases and contacts were treated and isolated on the Quarantine Island till free of infection. The cost for this was borne by the Bahrain Government. 2594 Vaccinations were carried out by the Victoria Memorial Hospital. A considerable amount of repairs i.e. cementing of floors, repairs to roofs, whitewashing, painting and re pairing woodwork of the Hospital was carried out during 1941. Further repairs are still repaired, but this may be /- or R.G.E.V. Alban, O.B.l., Political Agent, Bahrain.be undertaken later in the year s The outdoor attendance shows an Increase of 329 patients for 1941 as compared with 1940. As the Hospi tal was undergoing repair for some time, a number of in-patients could not be accommodated, besides a certain number of patients are now compelled to be admitted to the Government Hospital so the figure for this department of the Hospital will always be lower than in former years.

Government Hospital, Bahrain, Persian Gulf, 29th. January, 1942. Re: Annual Statistics for 1360 ( 194 1 .) for the Bahrain Government medical services. In reply to your letter of January 13 th. 1942. D. 0. No; 6/31, I am enclosing an abbreviated account of this year’s work. I must apologise for the delay. P.S. I would be grateful for copies of the reports of Dr. Steele &amp; Dr. Harrison. STATE MEDICAL OFFICER. y)ln U vM'' . A list is appended showing the main Statistics of both hospitals, Isolation Hospital, and Dispensaries. Ophthalmia, chiefly Trachoma again predominates. 27^ of male inpatients were treated for this, and a total of 532 Major and Minor Operations for Eyes on the male side were carried out. The other chief diseases in order of sequence were Haemorrhoids and Fistula, Malaria, and Respiratory Diseases. 252 operations were carried out for Haemorrhoids. Malaria was unfortunately on the upgrade this year, its incidence in Manama being 11$ over the whole year, as compared to 6$ last year. Despite well- advanced precautionary measures, May, June and December proved bad months, and in May it was exceptionally severe, chiefly sub-tertian. The anti-malarial work has made great progress in the date palm areas surrounding Manama, Muharraq, Sitra and Badaya. Its best equipped Squads work in Manama town. The Malarial recrudescence this year was largely brought about by the heavy rainfalls of the previous November, causing pockets of water, and damp areas to remain for months afterwards. The Isolation Hospital has now completed its first year, and 197 cases of venereal disease were admitted and cured. Routine and regular courses of treatment end injections are beirfg inaugurated, and throughout both hospitals 1,340 anti-Syphilitic injections were given, and full courses of 693 for Gonorrhoea. Both forms of Venereal Disease are equally prevalent. 107 cases of Amoebie Dysentery were also admitted and cured with Emetine and E. B. I. A small epidemic of Smallpox broke out in late August and early September. An efficient measure was passed causing all cases to reside on the Quarantine Island with money for food supplied by the Government. Whole families were transported including contacts, the people co-operated surprisingly well, and Dr. Steele’s arrange- -ments there were extremely efficient and praiseworthy. The Epidemic lasted till December. About 8,000 cases were vaccinated by Government Medical Services and several thousands more by other doctors. A certain amount of health propaganda is now being done by film, poster, and literature. Altogether the Government hospitals can now accommodate 110 inpatients at any one time.

Adviser to the Government. + t f1 Police Strength on 1-1-1941 31-12 Indians 6 5 Ar abs 329 330 Followers 35 37 370 372 Naturs:- Manamah 66 66 Muharraq 61 61 Defence and other posts 21 41 148 168 No radical changes were made in the Police Force which carried out its usual training through out the year. The recruitment of the Special Police Force for defence work was completed during the year. This force consists of 150 N.C.Os and men. The services of the Iraqi N.C.Os were dis pensed with soon after the Iraq rebellion. A num ber of British N.C.Os from the Indian Police were obtained from India. Mounted patrols by the State Police, carried out by the camel section and the horsesection were gw. P maintained through^the year along the coast and in other parts of the island. Some decrease in the entry of unauthorised persons has resulted from the police patrols. The state of public security is good. No serious crimes ocurred during the year. Most of the criminal cases dealt with by the police were petty crimes, theft, minor assaults etc. The decrease in traffic accidents continued.2 Administration &amp; His Highness remained in Bahrain during the year spending some time during the summer on the island of Om-Nasan where he has a country house. At the end of the year he went on a hunting trip in Saoudi Arabia. He was joined by His Majesty King Ibn Saoud and His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait. Dmring his absence His Excellency Shaikh Sulman acted as his Deputy. Mr. H. D. Furber, Assistant State Engineer, resigned from the service of the State on being given a commission in the army. Dr. M. M. MacDowall resigned her post as Lady Medical Officer in order to take up an important post in Iraq.. The death ocurred of Shaikh Khalifah bin Hamad bin Mohomed who obtained some notriety many years l/ ago by his intrigues with the Persian and the Turkish governments. He belonged to a senior branch of the Ruling Family. The Iraq rebellion had slight repercussions in Bahrain and caused a certain amount of unrest in anti government quarters but there was no public manifestation. The state took some steps to provide for pos sible air attacks against Bahrain, which did not materialise. Price control and measures against profiteering resulted in the cost of living in Bahrain being kept at a scale very much lower than in neighbouring states. 3. Pearl industry . Contrary to all expectations the pearl seasonseason was comparatively good and shov/ed a great improvement on previous years. The Indian market was very active and pearl prices in Bahrain were 50% higher than during the last year. There was an increase in the number of diving boats and all boats made a profit. The general improvement was entirely due to purchasers in the Indian market, the American and iSuropean markets being still stagnant owing to the war. The catch was larger than last year but few important pearls were found. The highest prices were paid for medium and low grade pearls. 4. Public Works . Themost important public work to be completed during the year was the Manamah J'uharraq bridge which was built by Messrs. Holloway Bros. Owing to the war completion was delayed very considerably and finally two sections were made in the workshops of the Bahrain Petroleum Company in place of portions of the bridge which were lost at sea. The administrative block of the state hospital was almost completed, the ground floor rooms were in occupation before the end of the year. The new Technical School was completed. Many miles of country roads were made passable for motor traffic by construction of light bridges. New married lines were built on the south side of the Port in place of the old huts which formerly accommodated the police families. TheMuharraq sea road extension was completed to Busaitin, the work was done by the Muharraq Muni cipality v/ith a grant from the government.IA new police station was built in Muha^raq by conversion of an old house. 5. Municipalities . Manamah. Progress was made during the year in filling in spaces between the sea road and the inner shore. An important new road was made from the govern ment hospital to the main Manamah-Rafa road and much of the low lying land in that neighbourhood was raised. Some progress was made in constructing roads on the open land south of Manamah much of which was until recently swamp land. The usual town cleaning and upkeep of roads, supervision of markets and municipal services were maintained. Muharra q. The main street from the pier to His Highness*s house was widened. The sea road was completed and a new road was made around the east shore of Muharraq town with a causeway across the inlet connecting the Halah area. The municipality carried out work on the Muhar raq side approaches to the bridge and constructed a round-about at the head of the causeway to divert traffic. Normal municipal services were maintained. 6. Agriculture . An agricultural expert was obtained from Sgypt and a committee was set up to discuss methods of improving agriculture in Bahrain. The Alw r ar cattle were moved from Budeya to Manamah. It appears that they give less milk thaniwHrfc than Bahrain cows but last longer in milk. European vegetables were grown in Budeya garden though it appears that this is not a pro fitable undertaking owing to the small number of people who use them. There has been a tendency among local gar deners to grow a wider range of vegetables. Rerjorts received from the Bahrain Petroleum Company confirm the fact that there is a danger of artesian wells failing owing to the waste of water. The date crop was unusually good and date gardens were in general healthy. Owing to the unusual amount of rain grazing was good and lasted well into the summer. 7. Electric Department . The undertaking operated continuously during the year 1941 but owing chiefly to lighting res trictions there was not the usual increase in load. Gonnected load on 31st December 1940 was 613 K.W. Do- 1941 .. 653 ' Maximum recorded load in 1940 = 180 ' Do- 1941 = 168 ' The p ower house generating plant capacity is 400KVA. A new method of allocating working charges and new depreciating rates were adopted for 1941 as a trial. The actual financial result of the years working will be shown on the annual statement at the end of the Arabic year. It is anticipated that under the new accounting arrangement the net profit after meeting all charges will be in the neighbour hood of Rs. 30,000/- for the Arabic year 1360.The electricity rates v&lt;ere revised for the current year, the lighting rate being reduced to As -/6/- from As -/!/-. Air Conditioning Unit a; rates were increased. The reduction in the lighting rate will decrease the annual revenue by approximately Rs. 10,000/-. The capacity of the generating station was not increased during 1941 as owing to the outbreak of war in Europe, arrangements made to instal a fourth generating set were not proceeded with. Wiring. The wiring of houses by local contractors continued approximately 450 points being added during 1941 as compared with 650 in 1940. The falling off is due to general trade depression and to some extent to the fact that wiring material is difficult to obtain. 50 Air Conditioning units were in operation during the year in public and private buildings. Telephone s. Five new subscribers were con nected in 1941 making a total of 86 subscribers on 1st Januarjr 1942. 8. Administr ation of Jus tice. Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad Alkhali^ah retired from the Bahrain Court at his owtl wish for personal reasons. His Highness appointed his younger brother Shaikh Daij to act for him. Later in the year Shaikh Abdullah acted for Shaikh Daij during the latter’s absence but on Shaikh Daij’s return His Highness approved of his resuming duty as a magis trate. These changes did not contribute to the efficiency of the court. Shaikh Ahmed bin Shaikh Hamad was appointedappointed magistrate in the Small Court. Shaikh Mohomed Saleh bin Abdullatif was appoin ted Sunni Shara Qadi in place of Shaikh Abdullatif bin Mahmood. The new Qadi has a broader outlook and is less bigoted than his two fellow judges. He is a relation by marriage of His Highness Shaikh Hamad, of Persian origin. Apart from several large estate cases no cases of particular interest or importance were heard in the courts. The Minors Department did good work throughout the year and dealt with an increasingly large number of estates. This department is under the Presidency of His Excellency Shaikh Sulman and is one of the most successful innovations of recent years. It is still opposed by the Sunni Qadis and other interested persons but in spite of this it extends its activities. The committee of the Shia VVakf Department com pleted its period and a new election is to be held early in the new year. 9. Education . In June 1941, at the end of the school term, Mr. Adrian Vallance resigned from his post as Director of Education.• He was succeeded in September by Mr. P. J. Wakelin. For information regarding boys schools please see my D.O. 2579-2E dated January 7 1942 reporting on Mr. Vallance. Female educatio n. A new girls 1 school was opened in Rafaa making a total of four girls schools. The schools are mainly staffed by local teachers with four Syrian teachers in Manamah and Muharraq. Mrs. Belgrave was officially appointed as Direc- tor of female education (voluntary) by Shaikh AbdullahShaikh Abdullah bin Isa Alkhalifah, Minister* of Education. The subjects taught include sewing, embroi dery, cooking and domestic hygiene in addition to reading, writing, arithmetic, English, history, religion and geography. The standard of edu cation in the higher classes compares favourably with the same subjects which are taught in the boys schools. Technical School . In September Mr. G. E. Hutchings, formerly Principal of the Baghdad Technical school was appointed as Principal of the Bahrain Technical School. At the beginning of the term^examinations were held and a number of new boys were admitted to the school which took over the large new building which was recently completed. The whole school was re- organised and is now working under Mr. Hutchings f s personal supervision. In addition to the work in the workshops the boys attend classes where they learn drawing, English and mathematics as in all these very necessary subjects they were found to be extremely backward. It is not possible at present to give a detailed note on this school as the Principal is in India purchasing materials for the school.

U'f January 21, 1942 Political Agent Bahrain Persian Gulf Dear Sir: In response to request received from Major Alban a few days ago for in— forination for use in compiling the Annual Administration Report of the Bahrain Agency regarding the working of our hospital during the past year, wish to advise as follows: Dr. Harrison is in Hassa at present and we do not expect him to return for about three weeks so I will give you the statistical information and comment only briefly on the other points. (a) - 35,981 - number of outpatients treated (b) - 1,018 - number of inpatients treated (c) - 450 - major operations (d) - 720 - minor operations (e) - 733 - number of outcalls made There has been no disease of epidemic proportions that has come to our attention. In March, 1941, we vaccinated 1,270 for smallpox and in October and November, 1941, 169, and relatively few in the other months. We have treated only a few patients having smallpox in our hospital dur ing the year. We do not have available the number of p.tients treated for malaria, but it constitutes a high percentage of the patients coming to our morning clinic. We also encourage hospitalization for the more severe cases, for about a week, to give vigorous treatment and also to build up the general condition, especially the blood. We give intravenous quinine injections with very good results. This past year 4,701 such injections were given. To my knowledge there has been very little cerebral malaria. At present we are going over our card index to learn what percentage of patients come in for the specific treatment for venereal disease. This grouping will include only those who have for an entrance complaint some manifestation of the disease, and not those picked up later by a routine Kahn test. Without these facts it is still easy to say that venereal disease constitutes onecf the largest groups coming to the clinic. Venereal disease certainly is a problem that might well be approached from a Public Health (preventive) standpoint. * We gave 1,417 intravenous injections of neosalvarsan, and 1,676 injections of sobita to outpatients which does not include the injections given to inpatients.2 ( 9 ) on Accidents within the port limits during year, 1941 . On the 2nd of March, 194-1, a local craft on her way back to Bahrain from the neighbourhood of Jadum Island encountered a strong wind. The crew jettisoned some of the stones which she was carrying but during a heavy squall she capsized near the West Spit Buoy. On hearing the shouts of the crew in the water L.T. u Nearehus n which had anchored off the West Spit Buoy sent out her motor launch and rescued the crew. The survivors were accommodated on board the 'ITearchus” and later on landed at Bahrain. On the morning of the 13th March, 194-1, a native craft which was bound for D*bai encountered a strong shumal and the Nakhudha in an attempt to get into the creek of Galali struck on the reef, the rudder broke and the boat capsized. The matter was reported to the Port Officer who sent out launches and divers to bring its cargo. The damaged cargo was saved and brought ashore and handed over to the respective merchants. On the afternoon of the 11th December, 194-1, H.T. 'Bandra 11 arrived at this port towing two fresh water Steel B a rges and anchored near the West Spit Buoy. The Approach was made in heavy weather. On the same night one of the barges cap sized and sank alongside the steamer during filling operations. The sunken barge which constituted danger to navigation has now been raised and brought inshore for the purpose of repairs. Lighting and Buoying ;- In October, 194-1, beacon re-built for marking the whirlpool at the ’Bab al Ojair’. DIRECTOR OF CUSTOMS AND PORT OFFICER BAHRAIN. J.P./-..URGENT THE POLITICAL AGENT, Bahrain.

The location of this well will be decided after No.3 has been completed. There was no production in 1941. A certain amount of oil from well No.l was used on road construction and maintenance necessary to the Company’s further explora tion operations. (b) Staff On an average personnel in Qatar during 1941 consisted of The Bahrain staff of Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Ltd., Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. and Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd. comprised 2 British, 12 Indians and some 20 Bahrainis. Qataris to date can only be utilised as drivers, rig-workers and in a few branches of semi-skilled labour. With two or three exceptions there is no literate class in Qatar and clerical staff is almost entirely Indian. During 1941 the first signs of a movement w Qatar for Qataris Tt began to appear. The Shaikh drew attention to the differences in pay and conditions of service between Qataris and Indians. It was explained to him that these differences were not between Qataris and foreigners but between different categories of employees classified on capacity and^ earning power. The Company conceded that the pay and conditions of Qataris and Indians performing the same work should be similar in theory but in practice certain other factors had to be taken into consideration. By making a few concessions to Qataris already employed as carpenters, blacksmiths, etc. the matter was settled amicably for the time being. British subjects 8 Americans 5 British Indian subjects 46 Qataris and other miscellaneous 300and the heir apparent who through the Shaikh's Arab representative selects all candidates for engagement. During 1941 about Rs.3 lacs was spent and actually put into circulation in Qatar by the Company apart from the annual payment of Rs.3 lacs to the Shaikh. These figures, of course, do not include the cost of equipment and stores sent from London, America and India totalling some 11 1 Rs.lJ lacs was spent in Bahrain. (c) Qatar Terminal As reported last year, a survey was made in December 1940 with a view to locating a suitableterminal .or future oil exports. A preliminary ® xam i nat i 0 “ points on the east coast was earned out. A report a submitted to the Company's London principals and there hav been no further developments so far. (d) Company^ Communications There is no change in the situation as described in • last year's report except that radio-telephone communica tion between Dukhan and the Company's launch Ghazal when at sea has now been arranged. (e) Water No potable artesian water has been located in Qatar. A small condensation plant is to be establ^ t camp in the near future. This will compensate for the stoppage of Bombay water supplies anticipated shortly. (f) Health During 1941 there was a considerable amount of small-pox in the Qatar villages. A case occurred in the Company cLp and every precaution was ^ken to prevent a serious outbreak. The measures taken were completely succes and no further cases occurred.

(g) Security year's report still The situation as described in las y stands •(h) Relations between the Company and the Shaikh There is little change from last year’s report. The Shaikh has had no cause for complaint against the foreign employees of the Company. As previously explained, the chief difficulty in maintaining amicable relations is the desire of the Shaikh to interfere in the Company’s recruit ment and administration of Qatar employees. As the object of all this interference is personal gain it will be realised that it is difficult to discourage it. For the last year or two the Shaikh has had under consideration a scheme for engaging an oil adviser. Apparently he is not desirous of engaging a person of any high status and this rules out Europeans. For some time he was corresponding with Iraqis but nothing definite was settled and the appointment appears to be in abeyance for the time being. The Shaikh was also thinking of offering the job to a Persian employee of the A.I.O.C. It is unlikely that the terms the Shaikh has in view willtempt any responsible type of foreigner. An aspect of this matter, however, which is not without interest is that the Shaikh seems to be prepared to go a very long way towards the conclusion of such an engagement without seeking the advice of any outside authority. 2. TRUCIAL COAST EXPLORATION 1941 Geological Exploration The Trucial Coast Shaikhs have been informed that no geological exploration can be undertaken during the war. As explained in last year’s report, the Rulers appear to understand the difficulties. They are apparently quite content to draw their periodical concession payments and in most cases are probably glad to postpone the respon sibilities which will devolve upon them when Company parties penetrate into their territories. As regards future payments, it is expected that the Shaikhs will all eventually demand to be paid in silver coin failing gold, and it is hoped that any future restrictions on export of ^ silver from Bahrain or India will not interfere with the discharge in silver of the Company’s obligations under its various concessions and T ’option TT agreements. 3. MUSCAT &amp; DHOFAR AGREEMENTS The option period of both the above agreements expire on the 23rd Tune 1942. The Company propose to invoke clause 8 of the Amendments to the Muscat &amp; Dhofar Agreements and extend the option period in both cases for another two years. The terms for such an extension-are the same as those of the original agreements with an additional initial payment in each case of Rs.10,000/-.

On 30th March 1941 Shaikh Humid bin * Abdul lah,nephev/ of the Regent of Kalba occupied Wadi Madha in which there are three villages - Madha, Ghuna and Hayar Rani Harnid in tiie Shaxnaliyah District. This aggi’avted the situation and hostilities on a large scale were resumed between the Shahuh and the Qawasimo On 15th April L.ie Wali of fjinas, ’Ali bin Mudhaffar, succeeded, through the help the Shaikhs of of/Fujairah anu Abu Baqarah, in arranging a two months Truce pending a final agreement between the Regent of Kalba and the Muscat Authorities. On 10th June hostilities were again resumed between the Qawasim and the Shahuh at Diba as a result a few men v» r ere killed and wouiided on both sides. In July the Sultan of Muscat deputed saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim to setule matters with tlie '^awasim. Owing to the uncompiomising attitude of both sides no final agreement was reached but the Truce was extended for another two months so as to give time to the Regent of Kalba to meet the Sultan and settlemthe matter with him. On 16th August the Regent of Kalba left for Muscat where he stayed for 11 days and then returned to Kalba. No agreement was reach ed between the parties and the matter was postponed for another two months. In December the Sultan again deputed Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim to settle matters between the Qawasim and the Shahuh but was not successful. When he was on his way back to Muscat he called at Fujairah and with the help of the Shaikh of Fujairah agreed with the Regent of Kalba to remove tlie upper portion of the tower('Murabba*ah in return for which the Muscat Government would compensate the Regent 'viuh Rs.600/-. The Regent of Kalba sent men on his behalf who apparently did some demolition and he then sent a messenger to Muscat that he had fulfilled his part of the agreement and asked for Rs.60C/- At the seme time the Shahuh also sent a messenger that the Regent had only taken off the upper battlements of the tower, which was not auf^^cient according to tlie agreement. The Sultan f s Representative refused to pay and vsent a reply to the Regent that no money would be paid unless he did the demolition agreed upon© (ii) On 2nd October Shaikh Khalid bin Alimad,Regent of Kalba, moved -rom Ajr.ian to Kira with his brother, nephews and all members - ^ , . paragraph 6 of ox their families contrary to the agxxxrsiHxi terms of/the agreement dated 24th June 1927 according to which he undertook to keep out ofSharjah territory® He was induced by the Residency .Agent xo leave Hira.

PURLING. Both the catch and the prices were good as compared with last year. The prices increased 100 per cent at the close of the season. This helped the local inhabitants, though only for a short time , to cope with the cost of foodstuffs which have increased greatly® ToliyConfidential No. C/253 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 2nd March 1942.

Kuler of Bahrain and the A1 Khalifah family Kis Highness Sheikh Hamad remained in Bahrain during the greater part of the year. He spent a short time during the summer at his country house on the island of Umm Nasan and at the end of the year went on a hunting trip, which lasted 25 days, to Saudi Arabia, where he was joined by His Majesty King Ibn Saud and His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait. During Shaikh Hamad's absence in Saudi Arabia Shaikh Salman, the Ruler's eldest son, acted as his Deputy. Shaikh Mohammad bin 'Isa, together with other mem bers of the A1 Khalifah family, accompanied His Highness on his hunting trip. During the year, the death occurred of Shaikh Khalifah bin Hamad bin Mahomed who obtained some notoriety many years ago by his intrigues with the Persian and Turkish Governments. He belonged to a senior branch of the Ruling Family. 4.

The state of public security continued to be satis factory. No serious crimes came to notice during the year and the decrease in traffic accidents continued. 5. Agriculture An agricultural expert was obtained from Egypt and a committee was set up to discuss methods of imoroving agri culture in Bahrain. There has been a tendency among local gardeners to grow a wider range of vegetables. European vegetables were grown in the experimental garden at Budeye, but this did not prove to be a profitable undertaking, owing to the small number of people who consume them. The date crop was un usually good during the year and, owing to the great amount of rain in 1939, grazing was good and lasted well into the summer• While they were drilling structure holes for geologi cal information, the BahHain Petroleum Company discovered that there was a danger of artesian wells failing owing to the excessive use of existing suoplies of water. The Bahrain Government immediately took steps to control water consump tion by prohibiting the boring of artesian wells without per mission of the Government and by ordering that the flow of water from existing wells should be regulated by valves. 6. Minicipsliuies (i) ivianaiiiah Progress was made in the constructions of new roads. ^n important new road was built from the Government Hospital to /-7' to the main Manemeh-Rafa 1 road and much of the swamp land south of Kanamah was filled in and new roads ware constructed over it. The usual town cleaning and upkeep of roads, super vision of markets and munipal services were maintained, (ii) Muharraq Apart from the normal municipal services, which were maintained throughout the year, the Muharraq Munici pality concentrated their activities mainly on road-build ing. 7. Public Works The most important public work to be completed during the year was the Manamah-MUharraq bridge, which was built by Messrs. Holloway Brothers. The war had delayed considerably its completion, two sections of the bridge being lost at sea. However, duplicates of the missing sections were made in the workshops of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the bridge was opened by His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain on the 18th December, 1941. The administrative block of the State Hospital was almost completed, the ground floor rooms being in occupa tion before the end of the year. The new Technical School was completed. New married lines were built on the south side of the Police Fort in place of the old huts which formerly accommodated families of the police. 8. Electric Department Owing chiefly to the lighting restrictions in Bahrain, there was not the usual increase in load. The connected load on the 31st December 1941 was 653 K.W., with a maximum recorded load of 168 K.W., the correspond ing figuresfor the previous year being 613 K.W. and 180 K.W. respectively. New /-New methods of allocating working charges and assess ing depreciation were adopted experimentally during 1941. Under this new arrangement it is expected that the net profit will be in the neighbourhood of Rs 30,000 for the Arabic year 1360. Electricity rates were reduced from 7 as. to 6 as. per unit and it is estimated that this reduction willd ecrease the annual revenue by approximately Rs 10,000. The rates for air conditioning units were increased. The wiring of houses by local contractors continued. Approximately 450 points were added, as compared with 650 in the previous year, the decrease being due to general trade depression and the difficulty in obtaining wiring material. 50 air conditioning units were in operation during the year. On the 31st December 1941 the total number of tele phone subscribers was 86. 9. Pearling Industry The pearl season was comparatively good and showed a great improvement on previous years. Though the catch was larger than that in 1940, few important pearls were found. The Indian market was very active and pearl prices in Bahrain were 50% higher thsn during the last year, the highest prices being paid for medium and lew grade pearls. There was an increase in the number of diving boats and all boats made a profit. During the 1941 222 pearling craft were in operation, while in 1940 only 191 operated. 10. Customs The Customs revenue amounted to Rs 8,04,089, as com pared with Rs 8,91,721 during the year 1940. 11. Boat-building and Shipping (i) Only one motor launch was built in Bahrain during the year, and another boat built here was converted into a launch.

Accidents within port limits (i) On the 2nd March 1941, a local craft on her return to Bahrain from the neighbourhood of Jadum Island encountered strong winds and capsized. I..T. ^Nearchua*, who was in the neighbourhood, sent out her motor launch and rescued the crew. (ii) On the 13th March 1941, a local craft bound for Dubai encountered a strong north wind. The nakhuda, in an attempt to secure shelter in the creek of the Oalali, struck on the reef, the rudder broke and the boat capsized. The Port Officer on hearing of the accident sent out rescue parties and the men and cargo were saved. (iii) On the 11th December 1941, H.T, 'Bandra' arrived with two frash-water steel barges in tow, and anchored near the West Spit Buoy. The approach was raada In heavy weather. The same night one of the barges capsized and sank alongside the steamer. The barge, which was for some time a danger to navigation, was later salvaged. 13. Medical (i) Victoria Memorial Hospital Captain R. Holmes, M.B.E., I.M.D., held charge from the 1st January to 1st June 1941, from which date Dr. M.L.A. Steele I.M.D., held charge till the 31st December. 1941 1940 Out-patients treated In-patients treated Operations 19,602 14 635 18,828 59 1,237 fRepairs on a large scale were carried out to the hospital building during the year. This caused a lack of accommodation, and the number of in-patients treated was necessarily less than in the previous year. (ii) American Miceion Hospital Dr. W.H. Storm, M.D., was in charge of the hospital until May 15th, and Dr. P.W. Harrison during the remainder of the year. 1941 1940 Out-patients treated 35,981 54,039 In-patients treated 1,018 1,252 Operations 1,170 1,047 (iii) Bahrain Government Hospital Dr. K.H.B.

In spite of great progress in the anti-malarial work organized by the Bahrain Government in atseas surround ing Manamah, Muharraq, 3itra and Buddiya, the number of cases treated for malaria showed an increase over that of the previous year. The recrudescence of malaria during the year under report was largely brought about by the heavy rainfall of the previous November, which caused pockets of water and damp areas to remain for great lengths of time. Venereal /-- 8 Venereal diseases are ]being systematic ally attacked by all hospitals, with regular courses of treatment and injactions. But patients suffering from these diseases continue to consult local hakims and seem reluctant to undergo regular courses of treatment cn modern lines. Late in August a small epidoraic of smallpox broke out. Those affected were segregated on the quarantine island till free of infection, at the expense of the Bahrain Govern ment. About 12,300 vaccinations were carried out by the three hospitals. 14. Po st Office Mr. Kanwar Singh held charge as sub-postmaster throughout the year.

These changes did not contribute to the effi- Mohammad /-V Mohammad. The new Qadhi has a broader outlook and Is less bigoted than his two fellow judges. He Is of Persian origin and is related by marriage to His Highness. Apart from several large estate cases, no case of particular interest or importance was heard in the Courts, The Minors Department did good work throughout the year and dealt with an increasingly large number of estates. This department is under the presidentship of Shaikh Salman bin Hamad al Khalifah and is one of the most successful innovations of recent years. It is still opposed by the Sunni Oadhis and other interested persons but in spite of this it is thriving and doing useful work. The Committee of the Shia Wakf Department completed its ^erm of office and a new election is to be held early in the new year. (b) Agency Courts The total number of civil and criminal cases decided 1941 was 1633 and 244 respectively. This represents an increase of 247 on the civil side and a decrease of 50 on the criminal side as compared with the preceding year. There were in addition a few cases under the various Defence Regulations made under the Persian Gulf States (Emergency) Order in Council, 1939, relating to profiteer ing, non-observance of black-out regulations, infringement of censorship regulations, etc. Dr. R.A. Kennedy, acting Chief Local Representative^, after Lieutenant-Commander J.S. Black relinquished this post for active service, was relieved by Mr. M.H. Lipp, General Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, on the in the Agency and the Senior Joint Courts during the year 16. Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited (i) Chief Local Representative 1st /•10 - / / / 1st June 1941. Mr. Lipp carried out the duties of both Chief Local Representative and General Manager for the remainder of the year. (ii) Field Development No work of development was undertaken by the Com pany during the year. The main First and Second Pay Pro ducing Zones are provided with sufficient points of with drawal to afford satisfactory drainage of the main reser voir within the recognised producing area. Wells drilled and completed in 1939 and 1940 provided valuable data, the application of which may make increased production possible and justify their further development. (iii) Well Repair The policy of correcting in its initial stages un satisfactory mechanical condition was continued by the Company. Besides minor repair work carried out on a large number of wells, major repairs on two wells were success fully accomplished. (iv) Production Total oil production during 1941 amounted to 6,794,157 barrels, giving an average of 18,614 barrels a day. Owing to the lack of shipping facilities the daily production rate was reduced from 20,000 barrels to 15,000 barrels on the 15th September, but this figure was raised to 18,000 barrels on the 28th December 1941. The average water production for the year was 720 barrels a day as compared with 723 barrels a day in 1940. The reduced rate of oil production towards the end of the year was chiefly responsible for this decline. . .. . . w .S nmr / i ' (v) Additional Area Drilling of structure holes for geological informa tion was carried out by the Company during the year. The /-4 17/- 11- The drilling programme was somewhat interrupted by con ditions arising from the war but some important informa tion was obtained, though this is as yet insufficient to justify any positive conclusions* (vi) Refinery Area Alterations and additions were made In the Power, SO , Cracking and Polymer plants, Crude Distillation ¥nit and tankage. No new operating facilities were installed during the year. (vii) Minor operational facilities were introduced, orthe existing ones improved, at Sitra, Jebel Camp, Zellaq, Rafa* and Awali. In the main residential areas for Company employees progress was made in the development of housing and recreational facilities. Following the air raid by Italian aircraft in OctoUuf fa apt enrtrer 1940, the Bahrain Petroleum Company were anxious to introduce a system of wireless telephony, for operation I between their offices in Bahrain and the California Arabian Standard Gil Company on the mainland, for defence purposes. Subsequently the Company intimated that this facility was necessary for operational purposes also, to provide for the safety of barges hauling crude oil from the mainland to Bahrain. The matter was still under con sideration at the end of the year. (viii) Royalty to the Bahrain Government For the first half of 1941 ... Rs 15,23,353 - 1 -0 For the second half of 1941 ... Rs 13,23,847 - 1 -0 (ix) On the 31st December 1941 the Company’s employees were as follows *- 1 Americans ••• 34 Canadians ••• 24 British ••• 134 British Indians.. 270 Bahrainis ••• 1291 Others ••• 254 X Total 2007(iii)/- 17.

Visits of Foreign Notables The American Naval Observer in the Persian Gulf, Commander D. Lockard, arrived in Bahrain by air on the 15th September 1941 and left the following day for Baghdad. 19. Visits of Arab Notablas (i) Shaikh Muhammad bin Pabma of Baraimi paid a visit to the Political Agent on the 13th March. He expressed his sympathy for the British cause. (ii) A party of Saudi officials, mostly Hedjazis, visited Bahrain in the latter half of April 1941. The party included Abdul Rauf el Sabban, now President of the Advisory Council in Mecca, who was formerly, in the days of King Hussein, Editor of 'A1 Qibleh w , the official paper of the Hedjaz Government.(iii) Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Ruler of Sharjah, paid a short visit to Bahrain during August 1941 for medical treatment* (iv) Shaikhs Humaid and Abdullah bin Muhammad, nephews ol of the Ruler of Has al Khaimah, arrived in Bahrain on the 28th August by sea* Shaikh Humaid called at the Agency on the 8th September* (v) Mohammad Reza, Ford Agent in Jedda and one of the biggest merchants in the Hedjaz, paid a short visit to Bahrain in September 1941 to arrange for the assembly of 350 motor cars and lorries imported by him for King Ibn Saud. He was formerly Consul for Czechoslovakia in Jedda* (vi) Bashir &amp;s Sa*dwai, now one of Ibn Baud’s advisers, visited Bahrain during September 1941 for a few days on Saudi Government business* A few years ago he escaped from Libya after he had been sentenced to death by the Italians for taking part in the Senussi rebellion* (vii) Shaikh Saif el Midfa 1 , Oadhi of Sharjah, came to Bahrain early in October 1941 bringing a present of four camels for His Highness the Shaikh. His Highness gave him a present of Rs 1000/-* 20* Local Affairs (i) On the 22nd January 1941 a census was held through out the islands by the Bahrain Government. There were the inevitable rumours amongst the population regarding the object of the census, though there was no opposition to it. The census was rumoured to be a prelude to such ' varied measures as the introduction of identity cards, the introduction of conscription, the expulsion of Iranians and compulsory medical examination. The census returns supplied the following information i-. .. ^.. . . ... . —i ■ - 14 - / Total population Number of stone houses, amaras and shops Number of saf houses Males or females Literate or illiterate Nationality and Religion The total population of Bahrain was found to number 89,970 persons, of whom 27,835 lived in Hamamah and 17,775 in Muharraq; 74,040 were Bahrainis and 15,930 were foreigners. (ii) During the months of May and June, 1941, there was an acute shortage of wheat flour and bread in Bahrain, owing to shipments of flour from India having been delayed. To begin with only a few small consignments were received by dhows but the position subsequently improved when B. I. steamers resumed a more regular service to Bahrain. 21. Petroleum Concessions Limited (i) Qatar Exploration (a) Wells and Drilling No. 2 well was completed on the 9th June 1941 at a depth of 6206 ft. at which point a promising oil ,, showing M was struck. No. 3 well, about 4 kilometres east of the Company^ Camp at Dukhan, was spudded in on the 1st September 1941 and by the end of the year had reached a depth of 5138 ft. There was no production in 1941. A certain amount of oil from well No. 1 was used on road construction end maintenance necessary to the Company^ further exploration operations. (b) Staff On an average personnel in Qatar consisted of 8 British 5 American 46 Indians (clerks, artisans, servants) 300 Qataris and other miscellaneous nationals These figures do not include the Company* s staff stdioned in Bahrain, viz 2 British 12 Indians (clerks and servants) 20 Bahrainis(c) Water No potable artesian water has been located in Qatar. At the end of the year a proposal to establish a small condensing plant in the Company* s Camp in Dukhan was under consideration. (d) On the whole the health of the Camp has been good. There were a number of cases of smallpox in the villages amongst the local people but precautionary measures taken in the Company* s Camp proved successful. (e) General Relations between the Shaikh of Qatar and the Company have been friendly, though the Shaikh*s interference in the Company* s recruitment and administration of local labour causes a certain amount of friction. (ii) Trucial Coast Exploration On account of the war no fresh reological explora tion was undertaken. The various rulers were apparently content tc receive their periodical concession payments and some of them were probably glad that assumption of the responsibilities which will devolve upon them when the Company starts active operations was postponed.16 - f\S(* Administration Report of the for the year l§4l » !• Trucial Shaikhs The following were the ruling Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast throughout the year I- 2.

Moa isal There was an outbreak of smallpox during the month of January which continued until the end of February. There was again a break of snallpox during the month of December. On/-On both occasions vaccine lymph was ordered at once end vaccination was carried out at various places on the Trucial Coast. 8 * Haids and Disturbances (i) The Sultan of Muscat did not agree with the peace terms settled by his Wall of Khasab with the “Regent of Kalba in the presence of the Shaikhs of Fujairah and Bakhah. In particular he objected to the retention of a small tower built for protection in I)iba during the actual fighting in the month of November 1940. In the month of January the Shahuh resumed their activities against the Oawassim at Diba-Hisn. On the 30th March 1941 Shaikh Humaid bin Abdullah, nephew of the Regent of Kalba, occupied Wadi Madha in which there are three villages - Madha, Ghuna and Hayar Bani Hamid in the Shamaliyah District. This aggravat ed the situation and hostilities on a large scale were resumed between the Shahuh and the Qawasim. Cn the 15th April the Wall of Shinas, Ali bin iiudhaffar, succeeded, through the help of the Shaikhs of Fujairah and Abu Baqarah, in arranging a two months* truce pending a final agreement between the Regent of Kalba and the Muscat autho rities. On the 10th June hostilities were again resumed between the Qawasim and the ohahuh *t Diba rs a result a few men were killed and wounded on both sides. In July the Sultan of Muscat deputed Saiyid Ahmad bin Ibrahim to settle matters with the Qawasim. Owing to the uncompromis ing attitude of both sides no final agreement was reached but the truce was extended for another two months so as to give time to the Regent of Kalba to meet the Sultan and settle the matter with him. Cn the 16th August the Regent of Kalba left for Muscat where he stayed for 11 days and then returned to Kalba. No agreement was reached between the parties and the matter was postponed for another two months./-months. In December the Sultan again deputed Saiyid ^hmad bin Ibrahim to settle matters between the r &gt;awa8im and the Shahuh but was not successful. 'Vhen he was on his way back to Muscat he called at Fujairah and with the help of the Shaikh of Fujairah agreed with the Begent of Kalba to remove the upper portion of the tower ('Murabbe*eh') in return for which the Muscat Government would compensate the Begent with ft 600/-. The Begent of Kalba sent men on his behalf who apparently did some demolition and he then sent a messenger to Muscat that he had fulfilled his part of the agreement and asked for ft 600/-. At the same time the Shahuh also sent a messenger that the Begent had only taken off the upper battle* manta of the tower, which was not sufficient according to the agreement. The Bultan r s Hepresentative refused to pay and sent a reply to the Regent that no money would be paid unless he did the demolition agreed upon. (ii) On the 2nd October Shaikh JCh^lid bin .Ahmad, Regent of Kalbu, moved from Ajman to Hire with his brother, nephews and all members of their families contrary to the terms of paragraph 6 of the agreement doted the 24th June 1927 accord ing to which he undertook to keep out of Sharjah territory. He was induced by the Residency Agent to leave Hira. He left for Dhaid on the 2Cth October. Latar he was induced by his nephew, Humoid bin Abdullah, to return to Hira. Efforts were jointly made by the Political Officer and the Besidency «gent to induce him to leave and these were successful. After arranging with the Shaikh of Dubai to live at Dubai as an ordinary resident, Shaikh Khalid, his brother, nephews and members of their families moved to Dubai. 9.

H4- The main statistics of the men and womenpatients are enclosed on separate sheets. Outpatients - reached the exceptionally high figurecof 1, 66719, and Inpatients were well over 2000. Major Surgery was somewhat lower than last year, while all other heads showed a considerable increase. Services . Inpatient facilities were completed by Oct: 1st, &amp; a total of 25 beds were set apart for them. The scheme was initiated by the Bahrain Government &amp; readily taken up by R.A.F. H.Q. Iraq, who provided one of the wards, an R.A.F. M.O. and four nursing Sisters. All Services are treated in these wards. Special Items of Interest . Smallpox . The new Quarantine scheme under Dr. Steele worked admirably &amp; his figures show a total no: of 312 cases with 30 deaths since the beginning of the epidemic Sept: 1941. The disease was practically eliminated by June 1942. Our total vaccinations 1942 were 8509, of which 7000 were given the first half of the year. Malaria . This was a reasonably good year. The incidence was 10$ over the whole year in Manama, and 16$ during the peak months May June. Last year's figures were 11$ &amp; 20$ respectively. Routine work continues over the North area of the island chiefly, and one large drainage scheme - the Ain Khadra channel - was carried out in March. Sub-Tertian malignant Malaria was seen in its extreme forms among the Gunners in the Refinery area. 14$ were affected, with several Cerebral cases, of which one died. &gt; P. T. 0Page No* 2. The Gamp sites are close to highly malarial breeding date gardens, which are being partially controlled. Total ^uinine injections for the year were 6590. Venereal Disease . 272 patients were admitted &amp; 2346 injections &amp; '693' treatment were given. Incidence among the men outpatients was 7$. Amoebic Dysentery . This is always endemic, due to lack of good sanitation. 206 cases were admitted to the Isolation Hospital, and 1560 Emetine injections given. Qpthalmia . It almost seems as if this terrible Scourge is being in a small measure controlled. The incidence among outpatients was 14 $ a s opposed to 20$ 2 years ago &amp; the no: of cases needing operation are declining. 431 operations were done this year. Schools . A special School doctor was installed at the beginning of 1942 for the Boys Schools, and much valuable preventative work is being done. Conclusion . The School, public health, maternity &amp; welfare medical developments te more efficacious a method of eradicating the causes of disease &amp; raising the health of this island than any temporarily successful curative methods carried out now. This side of the work is therefore being increasingly developed annually. .Oli^ • V STATE MEDICAL OFFICER. Z* * l* • ■ I fr~ *1 O &lt;r THE AMERICAN MISSION HOSPITALS.

ANDERSON, Chief Local Renresentative THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITEDBAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY,LTD. SUimRY OE OPERATIONS YEAR Of 1942. PRODUCTION IMPORTATION OF ARABIAN CRUDE REFINERY A total of 6,240,627 net barrels of crude oil was produced from the Bahrein Field during the year of 1942. No new wells were drilled or completed during this period. Forty-one of the seventy-four wells were plugged in accordance with instructions issued by military authorities. Exploration work in the additional area was continued during most of the year. Facilities for receiving up to 35,000 bbls. per day of Arabian Crude were installed at Zellaq Terminal. This included a deep water wharf, sub marine line, steam plant, pumping equipment and an additional 13,000 bbl. tank. An additional crude oil line from Zellaq Terminal to the Refinery was also installed. Except for a few days of trial runs this equipment for additional capacity has neither been utilized nor required. The quantity of Arabian Crude imported during 1942 was approx. 4,429,000 bbls. Preparations were made, including new pipe lines within the Refinery Area, to increase the crude oil processing rate from the normal 33,500 bbls. per calender day, to 60,000 bbls. per calender day. The Refinery was not called upon to process this additional crude oil therefore planned alterations to certain individual processing units were not carried out. No new processing equipment was installed in the Refinery during 1942. Certain large expendi tures were made however under the direction of military authorities. The total crude oil processed in the Refinery during year 1942 was approx. 10,763,000 bbls.SHIPPING PERSONNEL pm During the months of May, June and July crude runs averaged 662,000 bbls. per month or approx. 66$ of normal crude canacity. However large sections of the refinery v/ere shut down entirely because of low crude running. The remaining nine months of the year crude runs averaged 974,000 bbls. per month or approx. 97.5$ of normal crude running capacity. One new shipping line was installed between the Refinery and Sitrah Terminal and two new lines were installed between the terminal and the loading wharf. Otherwise no alterations v/ere made in the off-shore shipping system. A total of 111 tankers called for cargo during the year. They lifted a total of approximately: 3 .443.000 bbls. of motor gasoline 1.805.000 ' ” Kerosene 1.346.000 ' ' Diesel fuel 2.038.000 ' ' Residual Fuel Oil A total of 62 cargo ships called on our facili ties for bunkers during the year. The Power Barge Caltex II was held in bunkering service in Sitrah anchorage to facilitate the dispatch of cargo ships calling at this port for bunkers. A total of approximately 13,000 bbls. of pro ducts v/ere sold through our local service station facilities during the year. The regular operations of producing, refining, shipping and service organizations required the employment of the following average number of men: Americans - 29 British - 119 Canadians &amp; others - 29 British Indians &amp; others - 237 Bahrein subjects Sc others - 1624 • i Other special work done under military direction required an average of 910 natives during the last six months of the year. A temporary War Bonus payment in addition to regular pay was instituted in April and is bein^ payed monthly to all Non-staff employees to assist them in meeting the increased living cost due to world conditions.PERSONNEL The schooling of Bahrein personnel was carried on as in the past. Excellent progress is being made by the natives that have shown an interest in learning a trade or a specific refinery operation. Two 12-room concrete block type houses, a bath house and kitchen were built for native housing at the Zellaq Terminal. Mosquito and general health control service was maintained in and adjacent to areas of company operation &lt;pcvJ- Awali, January 28,1943.

Complaints from the Company camp of misdemeanours of the Ruler’s guards at the camp are periodical sources of irritation to the Shaikh who is peculiarly sensitive in this matter. In general, however, public security in the Company areas is excellent, and 'crime’ 1 appears to be confined to petty thefts. The Company, with the authority of and support of the Shaikh in the background, has no difficulty in maintaining a reasonable standard of discipline among its employees. f 9. TRUCIAL COAST EXPLORATION 1942 The Trucial Coast Shaikhs were informed in 1939 and 1940 verbally and in writing that owing to conditions created by the war, further exploration in their terri tories would be impossible until the situation changed. It was not considered necessary to continue these intima tions annually. Provided the Company is able to continue delivery of their annual concession payments and produce them in silver where applicable, it is not anticipated that any difficulty will be experienced by the Company in preserving amicable relations. 10.

At about 8.30 p.m. on the 17th February Shaikh Hamad had a stroke while saying his prayers. He fell on his side, senseless, and never subsequently recovered consciousness. Dr. Snow, the State Medical Officer, Dr. Holmes, the Residency Surgeon, who happened to be in Bahrain at that time, and Dr. Harrison, of the American Mission, attended Shaikh Hamad, and one of them was always with him until he died at about 12.15 p.m. on Friday, February 20th. He was buried in the cemetery at Rafa* the same day. Shaikh Hamad* a death at the age of about 70 occasioned general and sincere grief. Not only had he proved a true friend of the British Government but he had always given a friendly and sympathetic hearing to all who came to him with their troubles. Messages of condolence were received from all quarters of the globe. By unanimous choice of the Al Khalifah, — and, as was disclosed later, in accordance with the will of the % deceased Ruler —» Shaikh Salman, the eldest son of Shaikh Hamad, succeeded his father as Ruler of Bahrain. His succession was speedily accorded formal recognition by His Majesty's Government and the Government of India; and at a public durbar held at the Palace in Manama on the 6th April 1942, the Hon'ble Lieutenant Colonel W.R. Hay, / C.I.E.- 3 - V s C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, formally presented to Shaikh Salman a Kharlta from His Excellency the Viceroy congratulating him upon his succession to the Shaikhdom of Bahrain.

In order to encourage market gardening and bring more land under vegetable cultivation the Bahrain Government advanced ^taccavi” loans to approved applicants. The Bahrain date crop during the year was above average. 6. Municipalities (i) Manamah Good progress was made in the construction and maintenance of roads and the filling up of swamps inside the municipal area. The usual town cleaning and supervision of markets and municipal services were maintained. During the year the municipality constructed 90 air raid shelters t in the town. In the latter part of the year, the Municipal ity was entrusted with the local administration of the rationing of rice, wheat, flour and sugar. (ii) MUharrao His Highness Shaikh Salman was, prior to his succession, Chairman of the Muharraq Municipality. On his becoming Ruler, he handed over charge of this appointment to his brother, Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad. The municipality carried out its normal programme of road widening, town cleaning, etc. 7. Public Worka No new work of major importance was undertaken during the year, the Department being fully occupied with various construction schemes required by the Military authorities. The surgery block of the Government Hospital was completed during the year, and various alterations and repairs to Government buildings were carried out. i t 88. Electric Department Owing to lighting restrictions caused by the War 9 there was not the usual revenue from this source* The two chief additions to the existing load were (1) a new high tension line from Muharraq town sub station to the R«A.F* aerodrome at Muharraq; and (2) a new 400 volt feeder to the old premises of Cable and Wireless Limited. The wiring of houses by local contractors continued, but at a reduced rate, due to the scarcity and high cost of wiring material. Approximately 250 points were added during 1942 as compared with 450 in 1941. The total number of telephone subscribers at the end of the year was 93, as compared with 86 during 1941. Pearling Industry The number of pearling dhows in operation was slightly larger than in the previous year — 298 as against 222} but the catch during the 1942 season was not good. Weather conditions were unfavourable, and the smaller dhows had to spend much of their time taking shelter against unusually high winds which swept down the Gulf from time to time. Good prices v/ere obtained for pearls after the diving season had been closed for some weeks, but the profits of nakhodae and divers were much below average as the greatly increased cost of foodstuffs added enormously to the expense of provisioning the fleet. Generally speaking the pearling season was poor but not as bad as that of 1940. Advances to divers were as followsi- Diver Puller Tesqaam Salaf Kharjeeh Rs* 30 25 Rs. 30 25 Rs. 20 15 Rs. 80 65T i 10.

The H.A.F., who paid for the construction of a new ward, also supplied an H.A.F. Medical Officer and four nursing sisters. (iv) Quarantine Station. Muharraq Assistant Surgeon M.L.A. Steele, I.M.D. was Quarantine Medical Officer throughout the year.( v ) Hv&gt;ldemic disease There was an apidemic of smallpox early In the year. The number of cases of smallpox officially reported and treated at the Quarantine Station during the year was 193 with 14 deaths 5 the attacks were of moderate severity, there being only 5 cases of the confluent type and 6 with eye complications. Cases and contacts, on being notified, ware conveyed to the Quarantine Station. Those requiring vaccination and re-vaccination were given immediate attention. Apart from smallpox, there has been no definite epidemic except a type of mild influenza, and such an unusual amount of malaria that it has almost amounted to an epidemic. This was due to the abnormal humidity and the absence of the usual amount of cold. (vi) Vaccination In addition to routine vaccination carried out by the hospitals in Bahrain, a house-to-house vaccination campaign was carried out by the State Medical Officer. Many men, women and children were discovered unprotected and were vaccinated on the spot. This measure appears to have contributed to the decrease in the severity of the disease during the year under report as compared with 1941. 14. Post Office Mr. Kanwar Singh held charge as sub-postmaster from the beginning of the year until the 15th November 1942 when he proceeded on leave.

The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited (i) Chief Local Representative and- 11 - and continued in charge of these duties for the rest of the year. (ii) Production and development A total of €|c40 f G27 net barrels of crude oil was produced from the Bahrain Field during the year. No new wells were drilled or completed during this period. Exploration work in the Additional Area was continued during most of the year. (iii) Import of Arabian Crude Oil Facilities for receiving up to 35,000 barrels per day of Arabian crude oil were installed at the Zellaq Terminal. These facilities included a deep water wharf, submarine line, steam plant, pumping equipment and a new 13,000 barrel tank. An additional crude oil line from the Zellaq Terminal to the Kefinery was also installed. The quantity of Arabian crude oil imported during 1942 was approximately 4,429,000 barrels. (iv) Kefinery Preparations were made, including the installation of new pipe lines within the Kefinery Area, to increase the crude oil processing rate from the normal 33,500 barrels per calendar day, to 60,000 barrels per calendar day. The Refinery was not called upon to process this additional crude oil and certain planned alterations to v4i*&amp;tiAfn individual processing units were nothin fact, carried out. No new processing equipment was installed in the Refinery during 1942. Large expenditure was, however, incurred under the direction of the military authorities. During the months of May, JUne and July crude runs only averaged/662,000 barrels per month or approximately 66% of normal crude capacity, and large sections of the refinery were- 12 - were shut 4«wn entirely. During the remaining nine menths ef the year crude runs averaged 974,000 barrels per menth er appreximately 97*5% ef nermal crude running capacity. (v) Shlsslns One new shipping line was Installed between the Refinery and Sitrah Terminal and twe new lines were Installed between the terminal and the leading wharf. Otherwise ne alteratiens were made In the eff-share shipping system.• A tetal of 111 tankers called for cargo during the year. They lifted a total of approximately: 3.443.000 barrels of motor gasoline 1.805.000 11 * Kerosene 1.346.000 ' Diesel fuel 2.038.000 ' M Residual Fuel Oil. A total of 62 cargo ships called for bunkers during the year. The Power Barge Caltex II was held in bunkering service at Sitrah anchorage to facilitate the despatch of cargo ships calling for bunkers# A total of approximately 13,000 barrels of products were sold locally during the year. (v,i) Personnel The regular operations of producing, refining, shipping and service organizations required the employment of the following average number of men: Americans 29 British 119 Canadians and others 29 British Indians and others 237 Bahrain subjects and others 1624 Other special work done under military direction required an average of 910 local employees during the last six months of the year. (continued)A temporary War Bonus payment in addition to regular pay was instituted in April and was paid monthly to all Non-staff employees to assist them in meeting the increased cost of living. The schooling of Bahrain personnel was carried on as in the past. Excellent progress is being made by local men, who have shown an interest in learning a trade or a specific refinery operation. Two 12-room concrete block type houses, a bath-house and kitchen were built for local personnel at the Zellaq • » Terminal. (Vii) Radio Telephone Communication between Bahrain and Dhahran Direct radio telephonic communication was established between Bahrain and Dhahran on the 11th JUne 1942. The usefulness of this connection has been given convincing demonstration on several occasions. (viii) Industrial Conscription On 8th May a Defence Regulation (No.2 of 1942) was promulgated which prevented Gil Company employees who were British subjects or British protected persons from leaving their employment without permission of the Political Resident or Political Agent. The measure was necessary both to prevent a wholesale exodus in the event of air raids occurring and, in general, to enable the Managements of Oil Companies to retain the services of personnel essential to their operations until replacements could be secured for them.

Roval Visit * H.R.H. the Duke of Gloucester arrived at Bahrain on June 6th, having flown from Lydda. He was met at the aerodrome by the Political Agent who presented to him His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain and his two uncles, (Shaikhs Abdullah and Mohammad), Shaikh Said bin Maktum, the Ruler of Dubai, who was then on a visit to Bahrain, Mr. C.D. Belgrave, Adviser to the Bahrain Government, and the senior officers of the Navy, Army and Air Force present in Bahrain. After inspecting a Guard of Honour of the State Police, His Royal Highness drove to the Agency with H.H. the Shaikh and the Political Agent. Later in the evening His Royal Highness, who was wearing the uniform of a Major General, visited H.H. the Shaikh of Bahrain at his Manama Palace. During the visit, which lasted for some twenty minutes, the Duke of Gloucester informed T is Highness that he would shortly receive a present from the British Government of two captured 105 millimetre Italian guns. Shaikh Salman, who was genuinely delighted at this announce ment, presented His Royal Highness with some pearls and with a sword, encased in a gold scabbard, which had been in the possession of the A1 Khalifah for many generations. His Royal Highness spent the night at the Agency and left for Karachi the following morning. H.H. Shaikh Salman and his uncles went to the aerodrome to see him off. His Royal Highness again passed through Bahrain on July 16th en route from Karachi to Basrah. He alighted at the Muharraq aerodrome at 11.30 a.m. and, accompanied by H.H. the Shaikh and the Political Agent, drove from the aerodrome to the Agency, where His Highness took leave of the Duke. Before the Shaikh left, His Royal Highness presented15 - presented to him a signed photograph of himself in a silver frame. The Duke had Intended to resume his flight to Basrah at 2.30 p.m. but a defect in his aeroplane made it necessary for him to postpone his departure till 5.40 p.m. The intervening period was spent by the Duke at the Agency. His Royal Highness 1 second visit to Bahrain confirmed the impression created by the first vlslt 9 and left In the Shaikh's mind an indelible picture of Royal dignity,, simplicity and graciousness. 18. B. Visits of British Notables (1) Mr. F.H.W. Stonehewer-Blrd, C.M.G., O.B.E., His Majesty's Minister, Jedda, arrived from the mainland on the 6th March 1942.

He was accompanied by members of the Legation Staff, by Mr. Twitchell, Head of the United States Agricultural Mission to Saudi Arabia, and by Mr. Khair ul Din ul Zarkali, Councillor to the Saudi Arabian Legation at Cairo. On the morning of May 10th, Mrthen Mr. Kirk and his party called at the Agency and were/taken by the Political Agent to call on His Highness the Shaikh at the lAanama Palace where His Highness and his uncles gave his visitors a very friendly welcome. Mr. Kirk and his party left Bahrain on the last stage of their Journey to Riyadh in the afternoon of May 10th.

(iv) Mr. Twitchell and two other members of the United States Agricultural Mission .to Saudi Arabia arrived in Bahrain on June 6th for a short visit. 20. Visits of Arab Notables (i) Shaikh Subah bin Salim as Subah, nephew of the Shaikh of Kuwait, spent a month in Bahrain as the guest of H.H. the Shaikh. (ii) The Shaikh of Ajman paid a short visit to Bahrain in May in order to condole with the A1 Khalifah on the death of Shaikh Hamad and to congratulate the new Ruler. He had flown to Bahrain from Dubai. (iii) Shaikh Said bin Maktum, O.B.E., Ruler of Dubai, accompanied by his nephew Obaid bin Juma, arrived at Bahrain on the 27th May to condole with the A1 Khalifah on the deathdeath of Sheikh Hamad and to congratulate Shaikh Salman on his succession. He left on June 14th. (iv) Shaikh Mohammad bin Hamad al Sharqi, Shaikh of Fujairah, arrived at Bahrain on the 27th June and called on the Political Agent on the 29th. In the course of his visit he gave expression to strong pro-3ritish sentiments and declared his readiness to assist the British Government in any and every way open to him. After a short stay in Bahrain as the guest of H.H. Shaikh Salman, he left for the mainland en route to Riyadh. He passed through Bahrain on the 10th August, on his return from Riyadh. He was anxious to interest Petroleum Concessions Limited in the production of oil in Fujairah, but Mr. Lermitte, the Company’s representative, whom he went to see, told him that his Company would not enter into any new commitments or engagements until after the war. (v) Shaikh Fahad bin Salim as Subah, Controller of Finance in Kuwait and the son of a former ruler of that Sheikhdom, arrived in Bahrain on July 24th. He did not leave until August 19th. (vi) On November 3rd Shaikh Abdullah al Fadhl the new Saudi Trade Agent in Bahrain, arrived with letters of introduction to H.H. the Shaikh and the Political Agent from His Majesty King Ibn Saud. 21. Local Affairs (i) On the 8th night of ?*uharram (January 26th) a collision occurred between two processions, one consisting of Iranians and the other of Baharina. A general melee ensued during which a sub-inspector of police fired a shot into the air, stones were thrown and a few people injured. IntenseIntense local excitement was caused and religious cere monies on the two concluding days of the festival were somewhat disorganised. The Incident had no political significance and the temporary excitement which was caused would have died away completely in a few days if it had not been for the judicial proceedings which ensued. (ii) A Kuwaiti boom left Bahrain on the 19th February bound for Kuwait with a cargo of silver rupees and Saudi riyals to the value of more than a lakh of rupees* The boom never reached Kuwait, but the bodies of the nakhuda and five of the seven members of the crew were subsequently seen floating on the sea near Jezirat Abu All. A launch sent from Kuwait to search for the missing boom succeeded in locating the wreckage and in salvaging from it rupees and riyals to the value of about to*1,16,000• (iii) A local sensation was caused by the arrival, on May 5th, of thirteen sailors from Qatar whose dhow had been sunk by an enemy submarine. In Bahrain the sailors were hospitably treated by everyone, and were given an interview by H.H. the Shaikh. Thqy were repatriated to Qatar at the expense of the Agency. (iv) In order to provide relief for the poor of Bahrain a committee of Arabs was formed in the middle of the year under the presidency of Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa to collect money in Manama and MUharraq. Within a very short time of the formation of the committee, to.11,000/- was collected from Arabs, Sunni Persians and Indians. Ho collections were made from the Shla community nor were the Shias invited to join the committee. The Shias felt bitterly their exclusion from participation in this philanthropic/ ' IK I / j. ' / , ; philanthropic undertaking! this being the first occasion for many years that a deliberate and definite distinction had been made between Shias and other Arabs. On being told by the Adviser that there was no objection to their organising similar measures among their own community, and being assured that in the matter of affording help the Bahrain Government would treat Sunnis and Shias alike, they collected immediately Rs.7,000/-, and thereafter the rival Committees vied with each other in collecting further subscriptions. Since this rivalry seemed likely to promote serious discord, efforts were made to bring the two parties together and eventually, after much negotiation, a Joint Committee was formed containing representatives, of both communities and presided over by His Highness* uncle, Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa. On August 29th, to celebrate the happy rapprochjrnent, a gijaden party was given by one of the Shia notables, which was attended by His Highness, the Adviser, and members of both Sunni and Shia Committees. (v) On September 4th it was reported from the Oil Camp at Awali that some 200 migrant birds of unknown species and enormous size had arrived. One had committed suicide by flying into the Kefinery and its carcase was sent to Mr. Bertram Thomas, the Public Relations Officer, for identification. It was pronounced to be a stork and a tab round its leg reads- UNIVERSITE KAUNAS LITHUANUS B 3973 The fact that the local inhabitants have no name for these birds and that Bahrain notables went after them with ggns, whereas in other parts of the Arab world they are never molested and are in places almost sacrosanct, suggests that Bahrain has seldom, if ever, seen them before. (continued). 20 22. Hoyal Air Forea Levies. Two Companies of H.A.F. Levies were raised locally during the year for the protection of the aerodrome at MUharraq* Discipline was good 9 and they made excellent progress in their military training. 23. Defence Officials of the Bahrain Government and the Manage ment of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited rendered valuable assistance to officers of the Navy, Army and Air Force engaged on activities connected with the protection of the Island and its oil field. The Bahrain Government also organised an efficient system of Passive Air Defence. 24. Ec onomic (i) Currency - Owing to the high prices obtainable in Iraq for gold and silver, the export from Bahrain of sovereigns and rupees reached an undesirably high level at the beginning of the year and it became necessary to place drastic restrictions on this traffic. For some time a certain amount of smuggling took place, but the adoption of further restric tive measures effectively stopped smuggling on all but a negligible scale. From July onwards illicit traffic in gold and silver practically ceased. (ii) Foodstuffs . During the year the import and distribution of food stuffs developed into a major problem. Due to restrictions on the export from India of rice, wheat, sugar and other essential commodities, and due to the irregularity of shipping, great difficulty was experienced in obtaining foodstuffs sufficient for the maintenance of Bahrain’s cosmopolitan- 21 - cosmopolitan population. The problem was further complicated by the necessity to control re-exports to Saudi Arabia. Since there was no price control in that country Bahrain merchants endeavoured to divert their goods there in order to obtain increased profits. The Bahrain Government took a number of measures with the object of bringing trade under control. The Manama Municipality opened centres in the town for the sale of sugar to the public at controlled prices. The export of all foodstuffs was prohibited, though exports to Persia of certain non-essential foodstuffs was permitted on a limited scale in exchange for esential goods brought over from that country. In June a system of card rationing for rice, flour and wheat was introduced, and in August a Food Control Committee was appointed to assist and advise the Food Controller (Director of Customs, Bahrain) over food questions and to share his responsibility. Later in the year the administration of rationing, which had formerly been in the hands of the Director of Customs, was transferred, as far as Manama was concerned, to the Municipality. The imposition of rationing proved to be an invaluable factor in reducing consumption of essential foodstuffs; wastage was practically eliminated, extravagance was curtailed and the people were compelled by self interest to adopt habits of economy. Increased prices also, particularly among the poorer classes, contributed to reduced consumption. During the year there were several crises when the shortage of foodstuffs was felt acutely. On each occasion, however, the arrival of fresh supplies brought temporary relief. Steps were taken to obtain wheat from Canada and Australia, and the Bahrain Petroleum Company generously placedplaced their transportation facilities at the disposal of the Bahrain Goverrment. Efforts to obtain dates from Iraq were not, however, successful* The food situation looked very grave indeed at the end of the year when the disturbing information was received that no further exports of rice, wheat or flour could be expected from India, as India herself was experiencing a severe shortage. 25. Petroleum Concessions Limited (!) Qatar By the end of April 1942 the third test well in the Dukhan area had reacned a depth of approximately 7000 feet. Promising oil shows had been obtained in Nos* 1 and 2, but No*3 was a disappointtfient. There was no production in 1942. A certain amount of oil from well No.l was used on road construction and maintenance necessary to the Company’s exploration operations. The preparation for No*4 well was brought to an end in June when the Company received instructions to suspend its operations* (ii) Trucial Coast No further exploration was attempted during the year.23 - Administration Report of the ' Truclal Coast for the year 1&amp;42. 1.

Dear Sir, With reference to your letter C /85 of the 11th January, we enclose a brief report on the working of this Corporation at Bahrein during the last year. CKC. Station Manager.As is well known, since the outbreak of the war the activities of the British Overseas Airways Corporation have been directed to a gradually increasing extent towards helping the war effort and it may now be said that the Corporation is almost entirely functioning for this purpose. The Corporation’s activities at Bahrein reflect this policy generally and the carriage of commercial traffic - civilian passengers and freight - ape now of secondary impoi’tance. The main function of the Corporation at Bahrein has been - 1. Carriage of Diplomatic Mail 2. Transportation of R.A.F., Military ' and Naval service personnel 3. Carriage of R.A.F. freight 4. Carriage of Troops Mail 3. Carriage of Civilian Mail Civilian traffic has not been neglected during the year, but the activities mentioned above take priority over all normal peacetime commercial traffic. The past year has been a great increase in the number of services operated by the Corporation, and as against 2- flying boat and 1 landplane services operated each way at the beginning of last year, the Corporation was operating at the end of the year 7 flying boat and 1 landplane services in both eastbound and westbound directions. During the current year it is expected that the number of services operating through Bahrein will be still further increased. The Corporation has of necessity also embarked on a construction programme to suit its requirements, and the jetty at the Marine Alighting Area is now ;n the process of being widened sufficiently to allow motor transport to pass to the jetty head. The Corporation has also plans in hand to have its own spacious office quarters built in Bahrein, and this project will shortly be started. As a matter of interest, it may be mentioned that during the year 1943 the corporation’s planes carried from and brought into Bahrein the following - 800 passengers 8300 kgs. Diplomatic. Troops and Civil Mail. On the freight side, the Corporation’s Bahrein office receives mainly consignments of films from the Bahrein Petroleum Company to and from India, and parcels of pearls to be despatched as air freight to India from local pearl merchants. These are despatched as and when load permits. Bahrein will become a very important centre of a ir ’ transport in the future, since it possesses an excellent alighting area for flying boats and has a good natural aerodrome at Mubarraq Island. • # # ♦Bahrain. Dated the 17th January, 194-i. t 1 With reference to your demi-official letter No.C/79 dated the 11th January, 1944, I forward herewith the information requested with a short note on epidemic diseases. (a) Number of out-door patients treated for the year ending 31st December, 1943 was 20,029. (b) Number of indoor patients 36. (c) Number of operations 416 (all minor operations). (d) There were no epidemics of infectious diseases during the period under report but the figures for malaria and dysentery show a considerable increase as compared to the previous year. ( Malaria 2756 ( Malaria 3452 1942 ( 1943 ( ( Dysentery 286 ( Dysentery 663 (e) Small-pox always so prevalent in Bahrain has declined considerably since 1941 as the following figures show 1941 1942 1943 No. of cases 119 189 42 In September 1941 the Government of Bahrain ordered all cases of this disease to be reported to the medical authorities. On receipt of reports cases and contacts were removed to the quarantine station for treatment and discharge when free of infection. In addition intensive vaccination was carried out. The low incidence of the disease in 1943 would appear to be the result of these measures. One case of typhus fever occured in May 1943. (Crew of a dhow from Bandar Rig). As regards venereal diseases there were 92 cases of syphillii and 102 of gonorrhea in 1943 as against 162 of syphillis and 82* of gonorrhea for the year previous.

ANNUAL REPORT File No.004.1 Dear Sir, In response to the request made in your confidential memorandum No.C/82 dated January 11, 1944, I attach one draft copy of the Company’s 1943 Annual Report. This report is prepared for the Bahrein Government, but, before issue, is submitted to the Company’s Principals in New York for final editing and printing. I trust this will furnish you with the information desired in compiling your Annual Administration Report and I will be glad to give you further details covering any specific phase of the Company’s activities that you may require. Yours ve RG:LRN. cc: GM File Prod.File W. P. ANDERS* CHIEF LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITEDINTRO mjCTlOK: The aotiyitl«s of tlio Bahrein Petroleum Co. on Bahrein Island during the year, 1943, are briefly reviewed in this report. Tabulations are presented showing (1) the status of all oil, gas and water wells as at December 31, 1943, (2) the purpose, sine and type of all buildings standing as at December 31, 1943, (3) the nationality and number of employees in the various phases of activity in the service of the Company at Bahrein as of December 31, 1943, and (4) the monthly oil production and daily average water production by months during the year under review. The locations of wells, camps, pump stations, pipe lines, roads and other miscellaneous facilities are shown on the attached map. fUU) D&amp;TVLOP’ZNT k fo&amp;L REPAIR w&amp;LQpM&amp;yr t No work of a development nature has hem undertaken during the year. In November the Company applied fbr permission to rehabilltats a certain number of the wells which were eliminated in 1942 as a security measure designed to deny oil to the enemy in the event of e deterioration in the war situation; this per mission was granted by both the Military and Political Authorities with tbs proviso that dsnial measures will be revived if the military situation necessitates such set ion. Preliminary work in connect ion with the return to production of those wells which are necessary to improve the distribution of withdrewal from the reservoir and the observa tion of aasentlal data has been undertaken and .carried as far aa available personnel wiU permit; however, because of the specialised nature of rehabilitation, work beyond the preliminary stages can not be started until the necessary trained men are obtained. IMPAIR t The unsatisfactozy mechanical condition which was detected in one producing well during the year was rectified. A contributing factor to this unsatisfactory• 2 • condition is attributed to eorroalon and repair Jobe of thia nature are expected to become more numaroue as the age of the field extends. I’Torroriow Total oil production during 1948 was 6,571,609 net barrels, an average of 18,004 net barrel* daily. The rate of produetion has been held practically constant throughout the yaar with only minor adjustments from time to time to achieTe the daily arerage of 18,000 net barrels. This constant rate of withdrawal has afforded an excellent opportunity to obeerre reeorroir behaviour under the conditions imposed as e result of the eli inition of certain wells by the security measures undertaken last year and much useful information has been obtained. This information indicates a satisfactory reservoir performance at current rates of withdrawal but illustrates s reduction in the limits of flexibility as a result of the security measures which we are aiming to restore in the rehabilitation program previously referred to. QA3 INJECTION : fhe injection of Fourth Pay gas into First and Second Pays has continued throughout the year. The rate of Injection has remained constant but the distribution of injected volumes to First, and Second Pays has baan subject to changes as dictated by operating requirements. apqg water ^Nc^amfrarr: iVater production has been watched carefully during the year for any indi cation of harmful eeourlty measures. ffoots as a result of the redistribution of production imposed by fho overall rate of increase of water prodnotion has remained normal but in certain Individual wells, the rate of increase has been slightly more rapid than expected. Mb permanent harmful effects are dleoernable at current rates of oil production but the behaviour of the individual wells referred to above again demonstr tir tho nuod for a better distribution of production before the field can be restored to that degree of flexibility necessary to meet any reasonable demanfe whlohnay be ealled for* • 3 - Water production for tba yaar araragod 395 barrels par a daily aYaraga of 369 barrels in 1942.

' Government Total (not including Agency launches) DIRECTOR OF CUSTOMS AND PORT OFFICER BAHRAIN.i&amp;QSL£mm* In spite of increasing difficulties, there was at no tine an actual snortage of essential f foodstuffs during the year in Bahrain, Prices, being controlled, although increasing towards the end of the year, are still considerably less than in neighbouring countries. Stocks of Rice, although carefully rationed, and augumented by 200 tons purchased through the good offices of the Political Agent, from Dubai, were exhausted by the end of Shawal (October) and prospects of obtaining further supplies are extremely poor for the present. At the beginning of the year each adult obtained a monthly ration of 20 lbs cereals, which included 8 lbs of rice, this quantity, ie, of rice, was reduced in March to 4 lbs and again in September to 2 lbs per head. It was however possible whenever the quantity of rice was reduced, to increase the quantity of wheat, the only substitute the inhabitants have at all taken to, and the monthly ration of 20 lbs cereals was maintained throughout the year. At this stage it is interesting to compare the scale of rations for Kahurrum (January&gt;end Dhul HaJ (December), Mahurrum (January). Dhul HaJ (December). Total: 8 lbs Rice, 6 lbs Flour, 4 lbs Flour, 4 lbs Barley, Wheat. 'Hbf. The sugar ration of 4 lbs per month per adult, was reduced in April to 2 lbs and although subsequently an adequate monthly quota was allocated by the Government of India, it was only possible to increase the ration by £ a lb• The reason for this is that all surplus sugar is required for sale for export to Persian Nacodas who import into Bahrein such essentials as, Cattle, Sheep, Goats, Ghee, Charcoal, Firewood, Potatoes, Fresh Fruits etc. It has been found that the more sugar these traders can obtain, the more plentiful are their importa. In view of this and as a result of representations to the Government of India, through the Political Authorities, an extra quota of 25 tons per month has been sanctioned for this.purpose.

The Police obtained adequate supplies of clothing and equipment from the Indian Army and are now well provided with clothing. 2. Adminsitration. Nothing of outstanding interest to report. 3. Pearl Industry . The pearling season was remarkably successfully. The catch was smaller than that of last year, but prices were higher and all Nakhudas and divers made profits. The2 4. Public V/orks . There was no outstanding work of any importance undertaken by the public V/orks Department during the year except certain minor construction work in the Bahrain Government Hospital and the Fort, and repairs to roads outside the town. A jail was constructed in lid a. 5. tlunic ipal it ies. Construction of sea road in front of the Government Hospital, 1200 feet long. Surfacing of roads with a mixture of sand and waste crude.

The following works were carried out:-somewhat, but it is now difficult to obtain supplies of electric lamps. Other loads, such as Naval and Military, increased, and surplus (after meeting all charges) of approximately xi».40,000/- is expected, which will be carried to ^Operating Reserve”.

The electricity rates were not increased during 1943 in spite of war conditions, and increase in running and maintenance costs. General. The wiring of houses by local contractors continued, but at a reduced rate, due to the scarcity of wiring material. Approximately 237 points were added during 1943 as compared with 250 points in 1942 and 450 points in 1941. Telephone Department .

The main items of interest are the last two sections. Starvation with its sequelae gave us the most anxiety of all last year. The correlation of a certain form of Dysentery with $he new wheat and barley diet is undoubted. The Bahrain Government Hospital Women's Report is shortly following.

OUTPATIENTS Attendances continue to rise quite considerably. The School doctor had to be withdrawn during the hot weather to replace one on leave. Transporting the doctor to each of the 8 Schools twice weekly was not easy to maintain. INPATIENTS Beds could never be kept empty enough to deal with all requir- emei. ^4*. v/aiting ^ists for operations and V.D. treatment worked successfully. The Isolation Hospital of 14 beds dealt with a record number of V.D. and Dysentery cases. The Services wards kept half full on an average, and full to over full during July and August. EPIDEMICS Smallpox cases were practically non-existent. Chickenpox and mumps were evident in small numbers. Typhus was feared,but only one case was diagnosed. r A small epidemic of Typhoid, mainly in Muharraq and Manama started in the autumn and is now dying out. On the whole this was a good year. MALARIA Figures showed a slight increase. 10.5^ over the whole year in Manama compared to 10# 1942, and 18# during the worst May - June period compared to 16# 1943* Only routine work, using 100 men, was attempted as lack of transport affected the supervision and distribution of oil. Garden channels, house wells and drinking pots proved th« most^ fruitful sources of breeding. About half a million channels and pits were oiled, and fish applied and re—applied to eleven thousand wells. VENEREAL DISEASE 972 fresh cases were seen, and 237 patients were admitted of the infectious type. Syphilis is very prevalent in Sitra. Of the inpatienus, 113 were Syphilis and 124 Gonorrhoea. Most people are very amenable to regular treatment, and 1019 injectionsof N.A.B. and Bismuth were given, and several thousands of ,, 693 t, o QPTHaLMIA This is our most important work, especially in the Schools; 263 cases (22#) were admitted, and 292 operations performed. Total new cases seen all over Bahrain were 3594, I.E. 12.5# of all patients. Trachoma, with all its sequelae, accounted for 2016 of these. The SERVICES 388 cases were admitted, main diseases being :- Heat Exhaustion, Prickly Heat, Furunculosis. 67. Dysentery, mostly amoebic. 57 # Malaria. 33 *( 2 ) Ulcers, and septic complaints.

Total no: of starvation inpatients cases were 37, of which 11 died. Total no: of Malnutrition oedema cases were 33, of which 10 died. This entity was directly influenced by the import of foodstuffs, and food distribution centres. Afer a time wheat became the stable diet instead of rice, and very soon people became accustomed to it. Endemic Amoebic Dysentery showed its usual high figure, but ancillary Dysentery cases were much more numerous than usual, and this being emphasized by starvation also caused deaths. Over 1000 cases oj-Dysentery doubling last years figures, were seen, and there is no doubt tnpi the lack of resistance through malnutrition.made this more potent than normal, and the wheat diet irritate^ an alimentary canal already latent with this infection, tends to exacerbate the disease.

Governme nt Technical School (a) His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman bin 'Isa al Khalifah was created an Honorary Knight Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire on the 1st of January 1943 and was formally invested with the insignia of a Knight Commander on the 6th of December by the Hon*ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, at a formal ceremony which took place at the Palace Manama. His Highness has followed the political events of the v year and the progress of the Allied Forces in all the theatres of war with the closest attention. He has granted without question and v/ith commendable prom ptitude every request for ahjistance which the course of the v/ar necessitated. His Highness has played a leading part in the govern ment of his country end has particularly interested himself in the difficult problem of maintaining adequate supplies of cereals. (b) Shaikh Mohamad bin 'Isa and Shaikh Abdullah bin * Isa, C.I.E,, the uncles of the Ruler, have played a less prominent part in affairs than might have been expected. The first-named was absent from Bahrain for a considerable part of the period under review and Shaikh Abdullah bin 'Isa carried out his various functions as President of the Manama Baladiya and President of the Education Department with his usual ability.

There was an Increase in thefts of bicycles, clothes and foodstuffs. Smuggling of foodstuffs s^ch as sugar, cigarettes, etc. for export Increased owing to the high prices obtained for these articles outside Bahrain. There v/as a slight Increase in traffic accidents, resulting in four deaths and four serious injuries. The Police obtained adequate supplies of clothing and equipment from the Indian Army and are now well provided with clothing. 5. An experiment v/as made to cultivate wheat during the year under review but the results were disappointing and very few agric’ Iturists came forward to b\iy wheat seed for the following season. 6. The ' anana I.'unlciraiitv : The following works were carried out:- Constructirn of sea road in front of the Government Hospital, 1200 feet long. Surfacing of roads with a mixture of sand and waste crude. Construction of eight shops on Government account for the sale of rationed foodstuffs. Construction of 210 town rubbish containers.

The Municipality in addition carried out a programme of road widening and surfacing. 7. PUBLIC vVORKS on Jida Island the Public Works Department carried out no v/orks of major importance. 3. U LUC TRIG DI PAHTMEirr (a) General s Lighting restrictions were cancelled on the 22nd of June with a resultant increase in the revenue vrhich has unfortunately not been as great as could be desired ov/ing to a serious shortage of supplies of electric lamps required to replace normal wastage. Naval and military loads have been increased and it is anticipated that there will be a surplus of approximately Rs.40,000 which will be transferred to ’’Operating Reserve”. The following figures are of interest Connected load on 31st December 1942 - 694 KW generating set has been ordered. The rates for electricity were not increased during 1943 in spite of increased running and maintenance charges due to the rise in the cost of materials and labour. but, owing to the scarcity of wiring material, at a reduced rate. Approximately 237 points were added in 1943 as compared with 250 ooints in 1942*and 450 points in 3941. (b) Telephone Dooartncnt : There are now a total of 96 subscribers and the present switchboard is almost fully loaded. ftith the exception of the construction of a new jail 11 11 n 11 11 1943 770 KW 189 KW 198 KW 622817 737472.

The wiring of houses by local contractors continuedJanuary of 1943 will shortly arrive and enable the Department to accept new subscribers* 9. PLaRLIM; IUDLSTRY The number of pearling dhows in operation during the year was much the same as that in 1942 and the catch was reasonably good. Prices continued to rise on the Bombay market for the medium and inferior grades of pearls but there was only a slight rise in the price of the better quality pearls. This was due to the fact that whereas the low and medium grade pearls find a ready market in India the high grade varieties are normally purchased by dealers on the European and American markets. The centre of the European market has always been in Paris which is for obvious reasons at present closed to nine-tenths of the world and the American market is reported to be particularly dull owing to very few purchases being possible out of income because of the high cost of living in the United States and the inclination of people with consider?;ble private fortunes to invest in Defence and other Government loans rather than in the purchase of luxuries. Generally speaking, as far as Bahrain * was concerned, the season can be described as a good one. Actual figures have not yet been worked out by the Bahrain Government but there is no doubt that very considerable business was done during the year, one Indian merchant alone making purchases in Bahrain and on the Trucial Coast which amounted to rather more than 20 lacs of rupees. 10. CUSTOMS. Although the amount of imports decreased during 1943, due in a large measure to export restrictions imposed by the Government of India and shortage of shipping space which made it wellnigh impossible to obtain goods from other sources, the actual income was higher than it had been during any individual year for the last 20 years. The receipts were approximately 14^ lacs which is 5 lacs more than in 1942 and this very considerable • • • •(ill) State Kedlcel Hospital Dr. R.TI.B.

KDUCaTIOX the number of buildings Is still inadequate. Efforts are being made to provide accommodation and obtain additional trained teachers but the absence of building materials due to the war and the extreme difficulty of obtaining teachers has made it impossible for the Bahrain Government to fulfil their object. The demand for a good education for their children by Bahrain parents is due to the fact that they have now' come to realise that boys when properly educated obtain more remunerative rests tracting of a suitable marriage less difficult than their more commission Rs 34.10. 0 Rs. 22.3.0 R S . 32.13.0 Total Revenue* Rs.l39,2?4. 7 . 0 Rs.93 f 158.3.0 R*83,959. 1.0 Amount of Money Orders sent from Bahrain in 1943 totalled Rs.4,77,463/9/-. 15. ADI^NlSm^IOi; \F JUSTICE (1) IVys* vSection The work of schools has continued satisfactorily but and that girls who have received a good education find the con ignorantr ignorant sisters. The extreme difficulty of obtaining materials and masters has much handicapped l^r.Wakelin in his endeavours to improve the standard of knowledge in Bahrain but he is making great efforts to prevent any falling off in the progress that he has so far made and it is safe to say during the year under reviev; he has more than held his own. (il) Girls' Section The Girls' Section has suffered in much the same way and from the same causes as the Boys* Section. However due largely to the efforts of Mrs.Belgrave, the wife of the Adviser, the schools have been able to maintain a high standard of teaching and it is hoped they will be able to tide over the pre sent difficult times. (ill) Technical Sectlnn The Technical School like the other educational institutions has suffered much from lack of adequate instructors and also from the difficulty of obtaining raw materials so necessary for the instruction of the students. The school has been concentrating on turning out fitters and mechanics prin cipally with a view to their future employment with the Bahrain Petroleum Company but it was suggested during the year that they should widen their activities and introduce the study of automobile engineering. The Technical School is a very necessary institution and would with proper instructors and adequate materials be the most important educational establishment in the Persian Gulf but that position ?/ill only be achieved when the cessation of hostilities makes it possible to obtain the materials and the instructors.

During the latter half of the year when he paid a visit to the United States Mr. Russell M. Brown, Manager Operations, acted for him as Chief Local Representative and General Manager. (ID Iro&amp;AC.tlon and Development he total oil production during 1943 was 6 , 571,609 barrels being an average of 18,0 4 barrels a day. The rate of production has been held practically constant at the daily average of 1^,^00 net barrels and observations of reservoir behaviour under the conditions imposed as a result of the elimination of certain ells for security reasons have indicated satisfactory reservoir performance at current rates of withdrawal. No work of a development nature has been undertaken during the year. No exploratory work was conducted in the Additional Area and a moratorium in respect of the obligations \mder the agreement was granted dating from December 1 , 1942, and extending until such time as reasonable normal Company operations can be rested. (Hi) Import or Arabian Crude ^ll A total of 4,840,427 net U.S. barrels of Arabian Crude oil was imported during 1943. (iv) Refinery No major new operating facilities were completed during the year under review, but minor alterations and additions to existing equipment were made. Some new pumps were installed at the cracking plants, a new condenser was installed at the Polymer plant to augment the compressed gas condensing capacity, the platform at the C.V.T. r lant was extended, a standby steam- 11 - runp as Installed at the Distillation Units^ the sulphur burner at the S0 2 plant was rebuilt and certain alterations were made at the Reformer to Increase the capacity of this riant. An 80-ton capacity, steam-get refrigeration plant was designed and built adjacent to the Power Plant. Alterations and additions were made for the enlargement of the laboratory. Construction was started on new plants for aviation gasoline production, and work v.as well under way by the end of the year; no operating units were completed. (v) A new section was added to the existing materials pier increase the available area for unloading barges at the Sitrah loading terminal. New ethylising facilities are being installed at the Sitrah tank farm to replace existing ethylising facilities at the wharf which have been found to be inadequate. A geological test hole drilled at the wharf was completed as a water well and facilities were installed to provide an emergency water supply for ships calling at Sitrah anchorage. Reservation for extended marine and submarine facilities at Zellaq have been granted to the Company. A total of ?0 tankers called for cargo during the year.

Shaikh Abdul3ah Suleiman came to Bahrain on the 28 th October on his way back from India and the two Amirs Mohamad and Mansur on the 30th September accompanied by Dr.Rashid Mahmud Firawan. The Amir Mansur and Dr.Rashid Mahmud Firawan continued their flight the sane day wMle the Amir Mohamad spent the night at Bahrain as the guest of His Highness the Shaikh and left for A1 Khobar the following morning. (ii) Shaikh Khalifah bin Sr id, son of the Ruler of Dubai, arrived at Bahrain on July 31st and left on August 9th. (ill) Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Ruler of Sharjah, arrived by air on July 20th and left on August 2nd after a fortnight's visit to B-hrain. He was followed by his son Saqr on August 8th. (iv) Shaikh Said bln Maktum, O.B.E., Ruler of Dubai, arrived on the 6th of May to consult Dr.Harrison of the American Mission Hospital here about his eyes. He left after a stay of a week. 21. 10CH.L API A IKS (i) With a view to getting into closer touch with the mercantile community and thereby being able to deal more adequately with their problems and at the same time make them acquainted ith th&lt; difficulties of supply and shipping the Political Agent rormed a Committee comprising representatives of the principal business communities. The Committee meet once a week and so tar the members have been found to be extremely helpful and co-oper tlve. The Bahrain Govern r ent is represented on this Committee by the Director of Customs. (ID • • • •(ii) The Persian Gulf Fighter Fund which v/as opened by the Hon'ble the Politiccl Resident in the Persian Gulf in November 1940 was closed on September the 8th. The appeal had been very well answered both by the Rulers and their subjects and sufficient funds were raised to provide 10 Fighter Aircraft for the Royal Air Force. Bahrain’s contribution amounted to Rs.2,16*555/4/9, the Trucial Coast sheikhdoms contributed Rs.l,14,112/4/-, and the Shaikh of Qatar and his people Rs.48,175/14/3. 22. r CANONIC (i) Bank In,? a nd Currency Trade during the year was dull and the business of the Eastern Bank consisted chiefly of financing the requirements ct the Oil Companies, the Royal Navy, the Amy and the Royal Air Force. The sterling selling rate on London was lsh.6d. per rupee and the selling rate on India fluctuated during the year bety/een par and 1% discount. During the year the Bank imported' from India Rs.70,00,000 in Indian Currency notes. The sales on India amounted to Rs.20,?6,?45 against Rs.67,20,500 for the year 1942. This large decrease is accounted for by the export restrictions in India. (ii) Foodstuffs: In spite of serious difficulties towards the end of the year there was at no time an actual shortage of essential foodstuffs during the period under review either on the Trucial Coast, in Qatar, or in Bahrain. The prices of essential foodstuffs have been closely controlled in Bahrain with the satisfactory result that prices have on the whole been considerably lower than in neighbouring countries. At the beginning of the year each adult xvas issued with f a monthly ration of 20 lbs. of cereals which was made up of 8 lbs. of rice and 12 lbs. of wheat, but owing to the fact that fresh rice supplies were not forthcoming by the end of the year rice had been eliminated from the ration which was then composed of.fir-- 15 - 12 lbs. of wheat, 4 lbs. of flour and 4 lbs. of ba-ley. Sugar 1 as also been rationed at lbs. per month per adult but it is satisfactory to note that stocks of tea, coffee, and dates were sufficient to meet local demands though there was a distinct shortage of certain kinds of piecegoods. Cattle, sheep, goats, ghee, charcoal, fire-wood, potatoes, and fresh fruit have all to be obtained from neigh bouring countries as the vegetation and the climate of the islands are not conducive to cattle-breeding or fruit and potato cultivation* Ihere was a serious shortage of these comnodities in the late summer and autumn but the decision of the Government of India to permit the export of an increased quota of tea and sugar from India greatly relieved the situation as it provided local merchants with goods for barter purposes. It has been the policy of the Agency and the Bahrain Government that while the Bahrain Government continue to be the ole importers of essential cereals and sugar, quotas for tea, coffee, ghee, piecegoods and cigarettes are divided among the established Importers of these commodities. It is desirable to mention how well the Municipalities of Manamah and Moharraq have co-operated with the Bahrain Government in the issue of ration cards and the distribution of rationed foodstuffs. The ration system is working remarkably well and surprisingly srao' thly when it is considered that two- thirds of the population are quite illiterate. The cereal and sugar rations are considered by local medical authorities to be adequate f'or the physical needs cf the people but unfortunately many of the poorer members of the community have not the where withal to purchase a full ration with the result that malnutri tion &amp;nd its attendant bodily disorders is becoming apparent. The continual Increase in the prices of essential foodstuffs is a matter for grave concern to the local authorities, and it nay well be that if prices continue to rise not only will it be necessary to make further and large increases in war allowancestheir • • • • - 16 - but some means of subsidizing foot purchases will have to be devised in order to keep prices at a sufficiently low level to enable the poorer members of the community who are in the vast majority to make purchases of a sufficiency of cereals and sugar to maintain themselves and their families in adequate physical condition ^or the manual work by which they earn their livelihood. 2 3. British oversi;;, s air;,a/s corporation The past year has seen a considerable increase In the number of services operated by this Corporation for whereas at the beginning of the year only 2 flying-boat and one land- plane service were operated weekly in each direction at the end of the year there v/ere 7 flying-boat services and one landplane service in operation weekly in each direction. Towards the end of the period under review the Corporation were, owing to their projected large increase in services, forced to embark on a construction programme and to enter into leases for house property to house the increased personnel to be stationed here. During 1943 the B.O.A.C. planes carried to and from Bahrain 300 passengers and 8,500 kgs. of diplomatic, military and civilian mail. 24. C^BLE * ’■•'IKhitKSS LIMITED The Company’s work has much increased during the period under review and apart from maintaining cable communications with Aden, Karachi, Iraq, and Iran the Company maintained a 24-hour daily service for merchant shipping and an 18-hour daily continuous watch during which 'Direction Finding' bearings were provided for aircraft. Alternative radio links with Iraq, Iran and Aden ere also in operation and the Bahrain broadcast which consists of one hour’s broadcast of news and talks and music for listeners in Arabic-speaking countries is transmitted from the Company’s premises. 25. PETROLEUM concessions limited The Co' oany continued their dismantling operations which were designed to make available as quickly as possibletheir equipment and personnel for more important war-time projects. By the end of the year the Dukhan field had been closed and only 35 Arab guards remained to guard the Company's premises. In November the Political Agent concluded an agreement with the Shaikh of Qatar which provided for the continuance of certain facilities during the war and recorded certain financial undertakings entered into by the Company.(ill) • • • • 1. Xrt.'CUL SHAIKHS Ci) The following were the ruling Shaikhs of the Trnclal Coast throughout the years- Regents Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad. (ii) 7he Shaikhs of Sharjah and Dubai visited Bahrain during the year and the Shaikh of Ajman visited India. (iii) The Shaikh of Urn al Qaiwain married a daughter of the Shaikh of Ajman. (iv) During 1942 there was bad feeling between Sharjah and Kalba owing to the Regent of Kalba's persistent attempts to settle in Sharjah territory - attempts which hadpreviously been opposed # by the Shaikh of Sharjah and the Political authorities. • ] n 6th January 194-3 the Residency Agent arranged peace between toe parties, and, since then, the Regent of Kalba appears to have taken up his abode in Hira where, except for periodic vlsts to Kalba, he has remained throughout the year. Shaikh Hunaid bin Abdullah, a nephew of the Regent, has lived in Kalba and carried on the administration. 2.

The agreements with Abu Dhabi, Ras al Khaim&amp;h and Kalba remained unchanged. 3. LOCAL AFFAIRS (i) During the year there were five air crashed resulting in four deaths. One was at Dhaid on Februery 1st when a Blenheim crashed killing three of the occupants including It. the Hon'ble A.B. Hailey Officer Commanding the R.A.F. Levies at Sharjah. On the 14th of February a Wellington crashed near Dhidna causing the death of one of the crew. In July a Blenheim crashed near Um al Qaiwain and in December a Blenheim crashed on the Sharjah beach but there were no casualties. In addition there have been several minor mishaps near the Sharjah landing ground. (ii) A demonstration of bombing and machine gun practice followed by a fire-work display, and a cinema performance with an Arabic commentary was given on 2nd ?iay by the R.A.F. in the presence of Air Commodore G.L. Carter, D.S.O., D.F.C, It was attended by nearly all the Trucial Coast Shaikhs and their families, s^me of the Al Bu Shamis Shaikhs of Buraimi, and by the elite of Dubai and Sharjah. Rs.78,118/- was collected for the Persian Gulf Fighter Fund on the occasion. (iii) Intensive anti-locust measures were undertaken during the year under the supervision of Mr. D. Vesey Fitzgerald and a serious outbreak was probably averted by timely action. No opposition was experienced from the Bedouin although the Chief of the Bani Qitab, in whose territory n^ operations had however to be carried out, sent threatening messages through indirect channels. 4. ECONOMIC (i) Dubai merchants made very large profits in the earlier part of the year but trade restrictions, the imnesition of quotas and export prohibitions from India considerably restricted traders* • • •traders* opportunities for money-making in the latter half of the year. (ii) Kotor transport on the Trucial Coast had become critical by the end of the year and rany cars and lorries had to be taken off the road for want of spare parts. (iii) Special measures were taken during the year to fix the prices of cereals and arrange for their equitable distri bution. Two Companies were formed in Dubai and Sharjah to handle the distribution of cereals and by the end of the year the scheme was working well. (iv) The pearling season was unusually successful this year, the catch being bought at approximately three times the price paid last year. A new departure was the purchase by Shaikh Rashid bin Sa'id of Dubai of Rs.15,00,000 worth of pearls and by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi of Rs.70,000 worth. 5. SECURITY There was some raiding by Awamir in June in Dubai territory, in which camels were stolen but punitive parties from Dubai killed five Awamir, wounded one, and captured three more as well as ninety camels. About the same time five more of the Awanir were killed in clashes with the Khawatir. Shaikh Rashid bin Sa*id of Dubai visited Buraimi in July end the Shaikh of the AY r amir asked pardon for his tribesmen*s offences, offered a guarantee of non-aggression against Dubai, end agreed to forego the blood rights for the five Awamir killed. The captured camels were returned by both sides, Shaikh Rashid received deputations from all the tribes between Buraimi end Dhank. The Awanir have not since raided in the Trucial Oman. There was, however, seme minor raiding by A1 Bu Khali outlaws of the Nana sir. 6. SHINING During the year 22 steamers called at Dubai and 6 called at Sharjah.- 4 - 1 136'/ # 7. ?e.DICAL Malaria was unusually severe in October and November and many deaths are believed to have occurred.
