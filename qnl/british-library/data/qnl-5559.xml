VII. LOCAL OPINION' * 40S. The refusal of the Soviet Government to consider the Persian Government's request to be allowed to send troops to Azerbaijan has filled the people of Bushire with gloomy fore bodings. The news of the despatch of the British Note to the Kremlin, however, produced a very good effect and the British are, for once, regarded as having taken this action out of friendship for Persia, rather than merely from motives of self, intere st. 40... Nasir Khan Qashqai is believed locally to have visited Bushire, (paragraph 401 above refers) in order to assure H Consal-uontral that the Qashqai tribes would, if necessary', * fight against the Russians. The Bushiris believe him to have sent a telegram containing a similar assurance to the Shah. 410, The people of Bushire, who (it seems) measure the sta bility of the British Cabinet by the behaviour of most Persian Cabinets, which are blown away by the first breath of dissent,were expecting the British Cabinet to go out of of result of Mr Churchill's recent strictures J as a VIII.

Neither Divisional Commander, however, was informed that the other had been ordered to take action, nor of course, was it laid down who was to control the operation. As a result the Ahwaz column, consisting of one batt alion from the Behbehan Brigade, reached and occupied Hisar fort on the 19th July.

Reference paragraphs V(a) in each of Biaries Nos.20,21 and 22 of 1944. On 3rd July, Mohammad Ali Liravi with a band of tofangchis reached Kisar Fort (half way between Bandar Bilam and Ganaweh) from Jehbehan. The fort was defended by only a few of Fathullah Khan, Kiat Baudi's tofangchis, who surrendered to Mohammad Ali Liravi. The position at the time of writing is that Mohammad Ali is in possession of the fort, while Fathullah Khan is trying to persuade the Persian authorities to send troops to expel him. 273. The pretext given by Mohammad Ali for his capture of Hisar Fort is that he washes to collect the grain from this year’s., harvest from the two ’dongs’ owned by the minor heirs of the late chief of Liravi, Agha Khan, on whose behalf he acts, and from the remaining four ’dongs’ of the Liravi area which Fathullah Khan purchased from Kaji Rais, and which he (Fathullah Khan) later leased to Mohammad Ali Liravi. 274. In the registered Agreement to which Mohammad Ali Liravi was a party in November, 1944, the fifth clause is to the effect ”In view of the fact that the Fort of Hisar was the residence of the family of the late Aga Khan Liravi and belongs to the heirs of the said deceased person II. Local Af f air s3971 ?.nd previously in the said place military opex ■ ion: have been carried out the said Mohammad Ali mus select his permanent residence for the tlinenfretii i^i any other village he wishes except for. In explanation of this it is stated that what is meant by the Fort of Hisar is the Fort itself and that he has a right to live at the village of Eisar.” Fathullah Khan can have no objection to kohammad All's collecting the grain harvest in the Liravi area, nor to his staying anywhere in the area if not actually in Hisar Fort. ^ c?s heen proposed by H.M's Consul General, Bushire, that interested parties should be summoned to Ahv.sz (v. r hich can be reached more easily than Bushire) and the dispute settled by a committee of Persian civil and military officers, under the presidentship of' the Governor General of Khuzistan. 276. Kuhandis Farzaneh (reference paragraph No.198 of Diary No.9) arrived from Tehran by air on 4th July. He has reported to the Firmandar of Bushire that he has arranged to buy in Tehran the mechanical pumps reauired for the Bushire A'eli Changi Drinking hater Supply Scheme. The cost of the pumps is to be met from the extra sum of money 1 premised^ 3 by H. L.the Shah. 277. _ Reference paragraph No.254(c) of Diary No. 12 . The Deputies for Bushire, Aqai Safavi and Aqai Khalil Dashty, have sent a joint telegram to the Police Interpreter, Kabgani, informing him that he will not be transferred to s.ahidan as the result of the recent incident with the local fudeh party member, but that on the contrary his chief, the Reis-i-ohahrbani Sarbahr Masoomi, is to be transferred from Bushire instead. III. PUBDIC REDATION S. 27t. The Committee of the Bushire Reading Room Club recently decided that, in view of the fact that the Club had shown itself to be such a popular institution, it ought to continue even after the conclusion of the war with Japan. In these circumstances the Committee decided to carry out the repair and redecoration o! the Reading Room. This work has now been completed and the greeter part of its cost met from the accummulated subscriptions of the Club members. IV. SHIPPING &amp; COKkERCE . Imports .

Shaikh Jabbareh Nasuri, Bakhshdar of Tahiri, on his return from Shiraz, called on H.H’s Consul on 19th May. He had gone to Shiraz to try and persuade the Ustandar to settle the long-outstanding murder case in which his brother, Shaikh ixbdur Rasul Nasuri of Asalu is involved. In thi*s he appears to have been successful, for orders have been issued to Sargurd Arasteh, Officer Commanding at Bushire, to accompany Jabbareh Nasuri to Kangan, where he is to take security for future good behaviour from Abdur Rasul Nasuri. 212. Aqai Abbas Dawachi, Director-General of the Anti-Locust Department, Tehran, visited Bushire on May 24th and left on 26th May, (paragr a ph 218 below refers). 213. Aqai Sami'i, Director of the Agricultural Department} Shiraz, visited the Shabankareh Irrigation Scheme during the fortnight. He states that the control of this Scheme has been transferred from the Headquarters of the Agricultural Department in Tehran to the Shiraz Agricultural Department. BURAZJAN. 214. To enable the people of Burazjan to realise that British good will is responsible for the free supply of cloth to the poor tn these parts, and also tfc&amp; ensure that the cloth really was distributed to those who needed it most, H.M’s Consul took with him to Burazjan the 500 yards of cloth allotted to that town and had it distributed in his presence. 50 bakkets of dates belonging to the A.P.R.R.F. were also distributed on the 21st May to the poor of Burqzjan. There were at'least 500 poor in this town of about 8000 inhabitants to whom free cloth could well have been distributed, all of whom were in rajgs and some nearly naked. It w as noticeable that several two-year-old infants, who had had the misfortune to enter the world during the present time of scarcity were being carried abhut Stark naked. IB JUL1945(ii) The shops of. Burazjan are cloth, most of it manufactured in Isfaha beyond the reach of the labouring class. well stocked w , but soldi at Lth trices (iii) The prices of other commodities')in. the Burazjan bazaar were as follows:- 1 J.;.,.

Dates Rials 2' ' ' . •(iv) The sensitiveness to world events of the market of even so remote a town as Burazjan is shown bv the fact that whereas the price of dates before V.E. Day was Rials 3*10 per kilo (compared with about Rials 0.35 pei&lt; kilo before the war) the price after the European Victory hacf been announced fell to Rials 2 per kilo. LOCAL AFFiilRS . 215. ^ When Aqai Safavi, Deputy ofor Bushire, was leaving for Khorramshahr on 18th May h&lt;3 was loudly abused as a traitor in the presence of various merchants, officials, and others who had gone to wish him goodbye, by Dashty the Communist who is in charge of the Bushire Electric Company plant. Dashty was soundly beaten by Spfavi’s supporters and narrowly escaped being thrown into the sea. 216. In view of the fact that all able-bodied men will^be required to complete the harvesting of this year’s particularly heavy wheat crop, the chiefs of Tangistan arid Dashti have asked the Conscription Department, Shiraz, to postpone the call-up of the young men who should be reporting for conscription during the next 6 months. The Conscription Department have agreed to postpone this call-up until the harvest has been gathered. TRIBAL ALP POLITICAL . 2' r; . Ali Chahpiri, Rais-i-Intizam&amp;t, Tangistan, (para- nh 88 of Diary No.4 refers) who during the present war has b en consistently pro-German, sent HAL, 1 s Consul a letter of c ngratulation on the Allied victory in Europe. The people of Tangistan are ^reported to have been very si orised at the news that Germany had been defeated again. SECJRITY . 218. A postal messenger has been robbed of the post bag and 150 Tomans between Khurmuj and Ahram. A.,II-LOCUST MEASURES . 219. Aqai Dawachi (paragraph 212 above) called on H.M.'s Consul and informed him that the anti-locust campaign in the Bushire area (which extends as far as Tahiri) has been completely successful. He made an aLloigation to the effect that, owing to too rigid economy having been practised, the Bandar Abbas area, where the British anti-locust unit has been operating, is still covered with hoppers. Aqai Mansuri, the Anti-Locust Officer, Bushire, called on H.I;.Consul on his return from a tour of inspection which took him as far as paiyer. He Reported that all the hoppers in the area of Daiyor, Tahiri^ and Kangan had been3 destroyed, and that there v/as no danger of aduflt loou^ts migrating from this area. 1 ; 945 It has, on the other hand, been independent reported from Tangistan that fields of tobacco and vegetables a being spoiled by hoppers in the Tangistan area, where the Persian Locust Officers are said to have been very slack. LO CAL REACTIONS TO WORLD AFFAIRS . 220. The Bushiris, most of whom are staunch admirers of Mr. Winston Churchil, cannot think why he has decided in favour of a general election when he could have continued in power without appealing to the electorate. They hope d; any rate that he will secure a majority, for they think they discern in the plan of the British Labour Party to nationalise land etc. a dangerous extension of Russian Communism. 221. Local people have followed recent events in the Levant with kc -n interest. They regard the action of the French authorities in Syria as a new attempt by France to n lay her cruel grasp” on Syria and Lebanon, and so to re-impose on them the y';ke which had been lifted by British action. PU BLIC HEALTH. 222. re has been a certain amount of malaria in Bushire tow . PUBLICITY . 223. In view of the genuine enthusiasm aroused locally by the news of the Allied Victory in Europe it was disappointing to have received from Tehran no visual publicity of any kind with which to ’’point the moral and pdorn the tale”. Nor have any Photo Build-ups been received since 19th April. There has also been a serious delay in the supply of magazines in Persian from India and a telegraphic reference has been made to Delhi in this connection. Fortunately, however, we have been well provided with films, and 12 cinema shows were given in and round Bushire during the fortnight. The film ’.Alafzar’, which depicts the migration of the BakhtJLari Tribes has proved outstandingly popular among both educated and uneducated people. FOODSTUFFS . 224..

Aqai Sufr,vi,‘ Editor of n Kushish M and one of the two deputies for Bushire, arrived in Bushire on 21th April on a visit to his constituency. He has been meeting notabilities and making a great show of solicitude for the wrongs and grievances of his constituents who doubtless remain entirely cynical about pre-election promises and window-dressing. This is not to say that Aqai Safavi is any worse than the average deputy; He was elected with the approval of this Consulate-General and is naturally anxious to secure its support once more. H.K„ 1 s Consul has met him at luncheon in the Persian Club and has since received a call from him. 178. Aqai Ibrahim Kavian, the new President of the Bushire Court., whose arrival was reported in the last Summary is dissatisfied with the failure to send extra cou^t staff from Shiraz to enable him to expand the existing court into a Court of First Instance. He has telegraphed to Shiraz declaring he -.rill return to Shiraz if staff is not sent within a we el:. TR IBAL AND P OLITICA L 179. Sarhang Asrari of the Recruiting Office, Shiraz, visited Ahram lately demanding youths for recruitment from Rais.Ali Chahpiri. The 1 latter has justifiably urged that the harvest season is net no time for taking away his able- bodied young men and doubtless he and the latter will react as expected by the Sarhang and pay their way out of the difficulty. 180. Some ammunition probably stolen from Lease-Lend cargoes at Khorramshahr has been found recently in Tangistan. This is not particularly remarkable as ammunition from the same source comes to light sporadically in the South Persia area generally. 181. Fifty soldiers have been sent to Khurmuj from Bushire to add to the garrison there. The total strength is now 150 which should be eqsily adequate to overawe the Dashti Khans if that/- Miii-i r&gt; * if that were indeed the fixed intention of the con./.andin? officers. The latter however are more interested in in dulging the Khans' wishes at a price rather than in exer cising a firm authority. 182. Reports from Dashti and Tangistan show that locust hoppers have emerged. The Persian Locust authorities are slack and inefficient in tackling the situation. This had been pointed out to h.E.S.C., Tehran, by this Consulate- General and the visit of a British Locust Officer re commended. However, M.E.S.C. haye replied saying that the responsibility is Persian and must remain so. 183. It is reported that Nasir Khan Qashqai recently summoned chiefs of subtribes to Farrashband before the migration north. This is considered to be unusual but no light on the special significance, if any, of the meeting has been thrown by the reporter concerned. Rais Ghulam Razmi, chief Khan of Dashti, also visited Nasir Khar recently. C OLIuU NIC AT 10 N 3 . 184. A trial aeroplane of a projected Bushire-Tehran air service arrived from Shiraz on 20th April returning to Tehran via Shiraz and Isfahan the same day. The Post Office has announced that with effect from 5th May a weekly service for mails and passengers will be opened. Provisional passenger fares are as followss- Bushire-Shiraz Rials # 1000/- per head. Bushire-Isfahan Rials 2500/- per head. . Bushire-Tehran Rials 4000/- per head. These rates are of course high but road travel is expensive, slow, troublesome, and often unsafe. The new service is to be welcomed as providing a long-needed speeding up of communications. FOODSTUFFo . 185. The wheat and barley crops throughout the area are excellent and the harvest has started. There is some shortage of labour to gather a crop which is far above average and the harvest will be spread over at least a further month and probably longer. 186. Instructions have been received by the local authorities that no contracts will be given this year for cereals, the market for which will remain free. This will only be satisfactory if the landlords and larger cereal growers are not able to rig the market by holding up the bringing in of wheat from outside areas. Probably the excellent crop is a sufficient safe-guard. 187. Last year's wheat is now available in the free market at a moderate price. Bakeries have been informed by the Economic Department that after the exhaustion of present Government stocks they should arrange to purchase wheat from the open market, but the bakeries have refused to do so. A meeting to consider this position has been held in the Economic Department in the presence of'Aqai Safa.v* , the Bushire Deputy.±' meeting decided that bakeries should continue to be supplied by the Government and Shiraz has accordingly been asked to send down further stocks of wheat. The bread adulteration has been reduced from 50% barley to 25%, 188. The committee also expressed the view that only five bakeries would be sufficient for the whole town e.g. one at Bahmani, one at Sangi and three in the town. H.M.Consul is taking steps to contest this view. Overcrowding of bakeries is most marked. There should be not less than 10 bakeries for Bushire and suburbs. 189,. On 20th April, 1945, the Economics Department, Shiraz, ihstructed the Bushire Economics Department to cease issuing the sugar ration to villages vdiich have so far failed to produce recruits. This order appears to havo been issued at the instance of the Shiraz Military authorities. The Director of the Bushire Economics Department is■contesting this decision - legitimately, on the grounds that the * IChans will resent it greatly, and less legitimately, but naturally, because it will interfere with a source of profit to him. The Governor and Aqai Safavi, who scents election capital in the issue, are supporting him in asking Tehran to reverse the decision. SHIPPING . 190. S.S.’’Tsinan 11 called from Basrah en route to India on 17th and S.G.”Barala” called two days later, also coming from Basrah bound for India. This is an instance of the unfortunate bunching of ships which frequently takes place at present. CQLIl.ERCI AL 191. With peace with Nazi Germany impending, business is very quiet and markets dull. The prices of basic foodstuffs and necessities have fallen considerably. PUBLIC RELATIONS . 192. The death of Roosevelt created an impression beyond what might have been expected. It was generally believed that he was well disposed towards Persia. For three days after Roosevelt’s death, the Consulate cyclostyled news bulletins in Persian appeared with a black border. 193. Peace is expected at any moment and crowds are gathering each evening round the Reading Room to listen to the radio news. 194.

Local Affairs . ow* ludeh leaflets are still finding their way from hlraz to Bushire. One leaflet ( a supplementary issue of the Tudeh ’’Aqianus' ) made capital out of the shooting incident on the Shiraz road in which a Bushire chauffeur, Jamshidi, was killed while he was on his way to be married in Shiraz. The human interest of this story was played up and the incident attributed with other disorders to the Qavam, Khosrow Qashqai, and foreign agents'. A special appeal was made to all chauffeurs to band together against reactionaries who had maliciously caused the death of one of their number. 160. The Russian, Alexander Kalinin, reported in para graph 131 of last diary to have come somewhat strangely to^Bushire to purchase timber and sailing craft, is said to have spent much time in coffee-houses spreading Russian propaganda and in contacting members of the Tudeh party and Bushire labourers. 1S1. ^ On 12th April His Majesty's Ambassador visited the Itimadieh Cotton Mill to stcirt the new British Mirrless Bickerton engine which recently arrived from England and will now power the mill. Some British subjects and leading Bushiris attended the ceremony. 162. An evening party was given at the Residency on 12th April. British subjects and leading Persian officials and notables were invited and presented to His Majesty's Ambassador, 163. His Majesty’s Ambassador visited the Bushire Reading Room and Club on 11th April. There was a crowded attendance and the President of the Club ( the Governor of Bushire) and a number of the members were introduced to H.M.Ambassador who went round speaking to members and seeing the various games and activities of the Club, The visit was much appreciated. 164. On 11th April, H.M.Ambassador visited the house of Mrs Greenway, wife of the Residency Surgeon, to see the ladies of the Bushire Red Cross at work.

He is the younger brother of Shaikh Yasir bf Gavbandi and intends going to Shiraz to complain against the Bakshdar of Gavbandi. He called on His Majesty’s Consul and reported that he had heard of four different objects attached to parachutes and commonly believed to be wireless transmitter sets having been found at four different places in the Shibkuh area. Inquiries are being made about these objects which may be radio sets dropped from Allied planes or may more probably be meteorological instruments sent out by the Pilot Balloon Observatory at Bahrain. 16c;. Mohammed Ali Liravi has gone to Behbehan ostensibly for medical treatment. His two brothers Tahir Khan and Qubad Khan have come from Behbehan to Liravi to look after their brother’s interests.

H.M.Consul had previously pointed out to tne oargurd that the Persian authorities would restore this individual to something of his former position at their own risk. We, the British, had done our best to persuade the Persian authorities to disarm the khans of Dashti and Tanpis- fhP 3 np ha ?-H lna ^ y push( r d them lnt o a disarmament campaign. acbieyement 0 f that campaign was the humbling of All Ismail and his flight from the area. Now, at a timf when there were widespread rumours that the British were supporting the tribes against the authority of the Persian Government, it was on the contrary the Persian authorities hoH v!f re ?’ esto ^ ln g to Power a chief whose downfall the‘British had been largely responsible for and which had been a telling example to other khans. The Sargurd affected to admit all g this but said he thought Ali Ismail had learned133. The new Gendarmerie posts at Daiyer, 4 sa l u &gt;i and Gavbandi have received their full complement of •per’-” sonne1 from Bushire and are now in full operation. 134. When H.M.Consul and the Governor of Bushire visited Ahram recently, Rais Ali Chahpiri started tempore to distribute the sugar ration in proper fashion, fearin * criticism. The reform did not long continue. The inhabi tants of Ahram are said to have been well pleased at the visit of the Mobile Dispensary Van and also for the free cloth and suits of clothing distributed from A.P.R.R.F. stocks. 645 yi rily 135-_ A report, thought to be unreliable, has been received that there is still one German left with the Washqais ^ and living in close touch with Nasir Khan Qashqai. He is said not to have been handed over with the others last year because he had been a personal friend of Malik Mansur Khan when the latter lived in Germany. 136. Foodstuffs. The crop position is very good in all parts of the district‘and especially in Liravi, Hiat Baud, Rudhilleh and Dashti. If a little more rain falls to fatten the ears before the corn dries up with the continuing dry weather the yield will be still better. 137. Some anxiety is felt because of the influx of swarms of locusts throughout the Governorate area in districts as far apart as Asalu and Bandar Dilam and from the coast inland to Borazjan. It is hoped that the Persian authorities will take the nece.ssary steps to combat the threat in time, since egg-laying has begun. The threat, if it develops, will actually be not so much to the Bushire Governorate as to the areas further north where the young locusts, once they become able to fly, will migrate/ 138. Public Relations . A few articles inspired by this Consulate- General have appeared in the local newspaper. These have dealt with A.P.R.R.F. activities, with Consular tours (which have been treated from the angle of reinforcement of the prestige and authority of the Governor of Bushire with whom some tours have been made by H.M.Consul) and with various facts tending to show the long-established and conservative character of the British connection with Bushire. 139. A party was held at the house of the Publicity Assistant to which H.M.Consul invited the Governor, the Director of Education, and other / leading Bushiris to see a show of the new 16mm educational films. The Director of Education has agreed to shows being held regularly in the main hall of the Dabiristan to which children of the pther schools will be invited in turn. 140. The 'ohaipur' Calendar and the calendar of J the Teheran Conference have been received from Teheran. They are popular and are selling well. 141. The cinema van has again been fully occupied, shows being given-nightly. The technicolour film ’’Queen Cotton” proved a great attraction especially for lad°ies. 142. There is little new to report concerning the Bushire Tudeh party activities which have been less in the public eye of late. The party members were said to beexpecting a new leader to arrive from Shiraz on Nau Ruz day 9 but none came 5 so far as is known, 143. Mobile Dispensary . The ^ van went out to six villages within a radius of 35 miles of Bushire during the fortnight.

The crew of the first R.A.F. plane to visit Bushire after the completion of the new markings on the aerodrome reported that the markings were most satisfactory.

It is rumoured that he has been transferred an will not return. 114 Aqai Rest, said to be a naturalised Persian subject originally white Russian, and an official of the Transport Section of the Bhiraz Cereal and Bread Department, arrived from Shiraz to discuss with local officials the likely cereal requirements of Bushire for the coming year. er discussion with H.M.Consul and o^her officials he reported to the former that the demands of Bushire and other towns of the Shahristan were expected to be about 4,000 tons but that the surplus expected from agricultural areas was 4,400 tons so that a present it did not appear that it would be necessary to import wheat from outside into the Bushire areas. Aqai Hast said he would recommend that contracts be riven for the 4,000 tons required. . H.ii.Consul said that it was essential to give the contracts to local men over whom Bushire authorities had some control and not to unknown and, on last year s experience, unreliable strangers from Shiraz. Aqai Hast said he entirely agreed with this. it is possible that would-be contractors have afforded him more solid grounds for this welcome conviction than H.M.Consul 1 s persuasion. LOCAL AFFAIRS . 115 The Finance Department commenced the sale of cloth to the public allowing each person to buy 3 metres per coupon. The cioth was of such inferior quality and high price that dissatisfaction among the public arose and a complaint was made to the Governor that the Government cloth proper had hppn sold bv the Department and cheap bazaar cloth substituted!

The repairs are very r&gt; igh and ready and the road will soon fall into a b-'d state once more. ANGLO-IRANIAN RELIEF . 122. The Committee met during the fortnight to allot 5,000 yards of white calico and to arrange for the distribution of the gur which arrived recently from India. The Committee decided on a wide dis tribution of the calico so that at least some of it would reach practically every locality of size in the Governorate area. To guard against sale of the calico, it will be distributed in metre-strips. The selling of Gur cheap to the poor is an experimental measure and the whole of the 5 tons will be allotted to Bushire town. Lists of deserving recipients are being drawn up for some 15 different areas of the town. At the request of H.li.Consul, these lists are to be drawn up with special care and will remain on the books of the committee as a permament list of the needy poor thus saving time and trouble in future distributions. The Committee accepted H.i.Consul's sugg estion for a free meal to be given to the poor in four quarters of the town at noon on Nauruz day. BUGHIRB AERODROME. 123. The work of renewing the side and centre markings of the runways with crude oil has been completed. AHRAIvl . 124. The visit of H.M.Consul and the Governor of Bushire was well received, particularly, no doubt, because of the attendant largesse in the form of cloth and medical relief. The latter was much needed as it was found that trachoma was widespread among the population and much worse than at any other place visited so far by the Mobile Dispensary. As the results of the trachoma are likely to be appalling, ( the many hundreds of children affected being threatened with early blindness,) H.M.Consul offered to send Rais Ali a trained man for a 15 day period to give free eye-drops dally to affected persons. Periodical treatment on these lines is consider ed by the Assistant Surgeon to be capable of combating trachoma to a great degree. Rais Ali gratefully accepted the offer which will be financed from A.P.R.R.F. funds at a very moderate expenditure. Doubtless ” Surush” will draw the triumphant conclusion that Consul is highly concerned to con serve the eyesight of Rais All’s present and future gun men for the better use of British rifles against the Central Government, But it will be a pity to allow irresponsible and empty Tudeh clamour to interfere with a reasonable and highly defensible policy of friendly contact with townsmen and tribesmen alike. A policy of fighting the Tudeh by giving it nothing % to t a lk about can be carried too far if it means fainthearted withdrawal from contact with elements with which it is-4- politic to be friendly. CINEMA VAN . 125. The cinema van was again fully occupied, performances being given on 13 days out °T the fort night. Mother special performance for the members of the Reading Room was held.

They are reported to be on inspection duty md to intend visiting Dashti and T-nngistan. TRIBAL AND POLITICAL 88. Rais Ghulam Razmi of Baluk-i-Dashti. the present leading Khan of Dashti, and Rais All ChahplTt, chief Khan of Tangistan, together with forty armed fuian^chis arrived in Bushire on 19th February on a short v 4 3jt. It was the first visit of the former tc J^shire for ^orlie 25 years though Rais Ali visited Bushire over a ^ear . The visit not unnaturally provoked a crop of rumours and In view of the current Tudeh press a LiegaCionS of BTlCish conspiracy with the tribes RoM.Consul has oeen afc much pains to discover the reasons for and circumstan:es .surrounding the visit. One o^ the ostensible reasons fo r Rais Ghulam 1 s visit was to see a denfciSfc.. Inquiries fi jm the dentist confirm that his toothache 'was not merely ’’diplomatic u . Another reason/ for the Khans visit ( doubt-. less olayed down by themselves and their followers) was to ofc&gt;tair&gt; a share of monoply sugar, tea and piecegoods, always a ohady but highly profitable transection. Yet the Khans have in the past arranged such ^ffa^rs through • their Qushire agents to their satisfaction and without any inoidm ate rake off being taken by tne latter so as is Known. 89. Before discussing further the motives for the visit, it should be recorded that on the first day the Khans called on Sargurd Pakrawan, 0.0, troops and, next day, on the Governor. They inquired from K.M.Consul when it would be convenient for them to call on him 0 This inquir'' was put through from the Governorate where the Khans were then calling. As it had the blessing.of 'he Governor, H.M.Consul replied to this inquiry by asking both Khans to call at the same time ( they asked for separate tim«s) and -by asking the Governor to be present at the calls IVvis was thought to be a wise precaution in view of the propa ganda which might be made from the Khans visiting K.M. Consul separately and privately. The Governor agreed to this and the Khans duly called, Rais Ali Chahpin making polite protestations of his devotion to the British and his anxiety to be of assistance, Rais Ghulam Razmi barely uttering a single word. H.M.Consul confined his remarks t* conventional politenesses and expressed the hope that the Khans would exert their influence to maintain peace in Dashti and Tangistan, 90. H.M»Consul privately asked Fathullah Khan Hiat Paud in the course of conversation why the Khans had come to Bushira* The latter said he did not know but, rightly interpreting H.M.Consul’s inquiry as a hint to find out, he later reported a conversation he ha/d had with Ghulam Razmi in the presence of Aqai Rustaian, Finance Director. AsKed wh/ he had come to Bushire Rais Ghulam bluntly said Le had been hearing reports uiat the British weie ready to help the tribesman with arms and ammunition, that he had come to Bushire 'co f ? nd out if this were true-, and had beenidisappointed to discover that it was false. He/said to have added that he had hea?d something else in Bushjre, that Persia's northern neighbours were better than her southern ones because they pay money and give help while the latter help niggardly and late. Despite the apparent indiscretion of the remarks, it is difficuxc not to accept this report as correct. These Khans are rude and simple (thfugh their essential simplicity is accompanied by a vest fund of Irw cunning) and that they have listened hopefully to reports of British armed help, to the tribes appears to be confirmed by a conversation which H.M. £onsyl recently had with Sargurd Pakrawan, O.C 0 Troops, who had returned recently from Dashti and Tangistau, 91. It may indeed be that Rais Ghulam honestly re* vealed his mind; that he had believed reports of British armed help for the bribes, which are after all wpaespread; that he had been disillusioned and had heard reports current in Bushire that the Tudeh was spending money there and in the southern ports; and that he had succumbed a little to the enormous power prestige of the Russians whose known ruthlessness commands wary respect. However, this may be, it is clear that Tudeh anti-British propaganda, wild and irresponsible as it may appear, is given wide credence and is damaging to our interests, beinjg apparently calcu lated to discredit us alike with patriotic Persians and the tribesman. 92. Two rumours which circulated in Bushire confrim high suggestibility even of the comparatively anglophile Bu$Kiris to Tudeh allegations of British ulterior motives. One was that the Anglo-Persian Reading Room ( which had in fact been reserved one evening for a cinema .show for the imn of H.M.I.S ’’Investigator M ) had been reserved in order that His Majesty's Consul could hold a reception for the two visiting Khans. Another was that H .M. I ,S .’’Investigator had been specially detailed to visit Bushire at the time of the Khans' visit. The motive was variously given as to impress the Khans with.British power or to bring rifles for distribution to them «r both. 93. ^ Aqai Mahallati, a leader of the Shiraz Ad^ Lat party, visited Bushire on 23rd February giving out to the Head Munshi of this Consulate that he had come to give a lecture against Bolshevism and the Tudeh party. After taining the Governor’s permission he held a meeting on 2*th February in the Jrabiristan-i-Sadat, but his listeners wer# few and the speech appears to have been heavily weighted with pious^quotations from the Quran and particularly vague and impalpable even for a Persian political speech. At the request of the Governor he made no direct mention of Russia or Communism. 94. - Mahallati had other irons in the fire. He claimed to have brought a letter of surity for All Ismail ( paragraph V (d) of Summary No. 23 of 1944) from General Firuz and orders for the issue to him of tea and sugar rations for his area, ostensibily in order to keep him quiet. 95 * # It was also reported that another object of Mahallati's visit to Bushire was to collect a douceur from various officials, particularly Aqai Rustaian, Head of the Finance Department, as the price of his abstaining from intrigues and a press campaign against them in Shiraz. 96. Mahallati returned to Shiraz on 27th February intending to hold meetings in Borazjar arid Afterthe Bushire meeting on 26th February e number of printed leiflets of the Tudeh party were posted on wails of houses and shops. The leaflet was the same as tb^t published in Shiraz in the newspaper ' Acianus 0 Under the style of M Ifl Memory of the martyrs of Iran's Freedom Day^ fne 14th Barman 0 . The leaflets did not attract much interest but are a sign of increasing Tudeh activity. It is noteworthy that they were posted immediately aftgr the meeting in an endeavor to cash in on the public interest aroused. 97. There is a rumour,, not widespread, that Nasir Khan Qash^ai has warned all his tribesmen to refuse all associa tion with the Tudeh party under penalty of death, 9- Q Poferencu paragraph V (c) of Summary No. 23 of 1944 K uslihxT’ it is confirmed that Husain Namju and his nephew Husain All have made their peace with Rais All Chahpirl and also, it is now report^ with Rais Ghulam Razmi o£ D^5ht1 claims 99.

It is reported that Furughul-mulk Chief of Police of Shiraz has ordered the Bushire Police Departi:unc to be under Shiraz instead of under Tehran with effect from the new Persian year ( 22nd March, 1945), 1«U Bushire aerodrom e. The work of renewing the markings on Bushire aero- 4rome with crude oil has been taken up and will be completed in about ten days.

There is little to record regarding H.M.Consul’s visit to Kharagc The condition of the two hundred aru fifty or so islanders was fairly good.

Sargurd Pakrawan, Officer Commanding troops, Bushire, returned from his tour of Dashti on 4th February, 1945. - I3AL AND political • Sargurd Pakrawan, Officer Commanding troops, lushire, having returned from hip latest visit to Dashti nd Tangistan, it is convenient triform some appreciation of his activities to date. It was‘noted in this Consulate General Diary for 1st to 15th fercember, 1944, that though this officer seemed well-disposed he was the son of the notorious pro-Russian Fathullah Pakrawan, sometime Governor-General of Khorasan and Persian Ambassador to Moscow. For this reason it has been thought wise to keep a close watch on this individual’s activities. From inquiries made there is no evidence that Sargurd Pakrawan has overtly engaged in pro-Russian propaganda. But from conversations with him, His Majesty’s Consul believes him to share in part the belief which is being propagated by the Tudeh Press in Tehran and Shiraz that there is a considerable import of arms into Dashti and Tangistan from the Arab side of the Gulf which the British are thought secretly to encourage. His Majesty’s Consul has pointed out to him that this view is entirely fanciful, that we keep the strictest watch on the Arab side, punish offenders se'werely, and are always ready to investigate reports. His Majesty’s Consul said he thou^it it generally established.that new British 'and American arms and ammunition n#w found in South Persia was lease-lend material stolen in Khuzistan, and that at the worst a mere trickle of old rifles and ammunition came across the-Gulf to Persia. It is true that the allegations that the British encourage the arms traffic are receiving wide currency at the moment, no doubt largely as a result of Tudeh propaganda, but that Sargurd Pakrawan has seemed inclined to believe them must be viewed with some suspj ^w Hfifa^ls-r'Said to have repudiated his OFFICE!- 2 - xc t ier's jr-«-Russian views tg one official wh» referred 4 -o them but it does ntt seem to* fanciful to imagine fc.iat the fact that the son of such a father should b$ in an important position in the South may not be entirely unconnected with Russian designs there. 61. Sargurd Pakrawan’s activities appear to have been, outwardly at least, unexceptionable. He appearsito have been establishing contact with all the Khans and men of influence and to have urged theft to compose their quarrels. N«t a single report has accuse^ him of bribery and his reputation for integrity stands high. He claims to have brought the Khans to a more' peaceable attitude and one more trustful of the Government but this remains to be seen. Blood feuds and conflicts of interest are the persisting causes of unrest in the area and these remain to thwart the would“be peace maker, BORAZJUN 62. His Majesty's Consul and the Governor of Bushire went by car tf Borazjun on 12th February and together distributed A.P.R.R.F. clothes, sugar and tea to some 250 of the poor. This visit in close association with the Governor, ostensibly made for the A.P.R.R.F. purposes only, was arranged by His Majesty's Consul partly an some counter to the growing and widespread reports that British officials are conspiring with the tribes against the Central Government. The Governor and His Majesty's Cohsul mart to gether officials and merchants and inspected the local bazaar where local produce was plentiful but dear and imported cotton cl#th in abundance but none of it cheaper than rials per yard. *40 The Borazjun area though merely self-sufficient in cereals is a large date-growing area and is estimated to have a yearly exportable surplus of. •ver 5,#00 tons. The same Consulate-General lorry which took the clouh, sugar and tea, took b*ek to Bushire three tons of dates gifted to the A.I.R.R.F. by Malik Mansur, the Khan of Shahbankareh,'some miles from Borazjun. HIaT daub 63. From Hiat Baud, Rudhilleh, and Liravi, have come very satisfactory reports of good crop prospects owing to the good rains. Dairy products also, milk, butter, masted ghi are becoming increasingly plentiful and improved in quality. The price is still high. LOCAL AFFAIRS . ' * 64. Orders for the separation of the Economic Department from the Jinance Department were received from Tehran, but the Finance Director, Aqai Rustaian* is anxious to obtain for himself the more profitable post of Head of the Economic Department and has not yet handed over charge to any of his superior staff. The Consulate Dispensary toured to Borazjun, Ahraedi 65.and Chaghadak during the fortnight. Over 100 patients were treated at Ahmedi and Chaghadak and 200 at Boraz.jun. C6 . A Persian Government Mobile Dispensary in charge of pr. Nurudiin Pezeshki, Dr. Basirian, and two assistant arrived at Sushire on 2nd February. The dispensary is to Lour to all parts of the Shahristan and treat patients free of charge. The party proceeded to Borazjun on 3rd February and later left for Shahbankareh, but. owing to the poor state of the road were forced to return to Bushire. The dispensary will stay in the Bushire area for a four month period and is one of six which have been sent round the country financed partly by the Health #department and partly from a gift of rials 1,00*,000 from the Shah. ’ ’ a result of the appearance of several ^ e h ran newspaper u Kaihan” against Aqai fialahshur, Director of Bushire Posts and Telegraphs, the latter’s cousin who is in charge of the Bushire telegraph office has beaten up soundly the newspaper's correspondent ( Hassan Faramarzi ). The latter has brought a case for assault in the local Court. 68. The local foodstuffs position has improved. More ghi has arrived and been sold in the market. The price of ghi has now dropped to Rials 280 per maund of kilos and the tendency is still downward. still small and uninfluential Tudeh party in Bushire is extending its propaganda activities though it appears to feel bound to proceed circumspectly. The ^ Jafar Ahangari, a blacksmith, but there are more influential members who keep them- s t 1 l es ^} nthe background. As is to be expected, a number Bushiris take the opportunity of calls or social contacts with His Majesty's Consul to blacken the reputation or their enemies by asserting that these belong to the Tudeh party. Iniuiries into these reports are proceeding and a close watch is being maintained on the growing activity of the party. It has been re ported that there is much pro-Russian talk in coffee- nouses on the Bushire-Shiraz road and this is thought to be the work of Chauffeurs sympathetic to the Tudeh. A report that postal messengers from Shiraz were carrying Tudeh leaflets to Bushire and towns and villages en route has been referred to Consul, Shiraz. ? cons iberable number of leaflets and pampniets have been received in the town. 71. There is no doubt that the anti-British articles DarticSlar1v h thf h rT aZ + neWSP ? Pe P’ Surush and Aqianus, f irst -named, have had an unfortunate effect which it is still difficult to assess The va*,,, assertions of British interference and secret designs® already xenonhobe r p b0Und t0 gain credence among the a xen °P h ° be Persians, especially when they are not denied or countered, and the fact that they are not suppressed argues, to a Persian, British weakness since el irwe U could! / W ° Uld haVS the offendin g P a Pers suppress .72. His Majesty's Consul is attempting to organisei j jj/'l nr counter propaganda through the medium of ^ article a wr^wt'jgja to the local press by well-disposed Persiar^but this naturally requires careful'handling, It is important at this stage not to help the Bughire Tudeh by paying it more public attention that it deserves. PUBLICITY AFFAIR S. ri rT '' L L 73. A fault in the cinema van loud-speaker which has given considerable trouble has been rectified and the pro gramme of cinema shows in Bushire and suburbs renewed. 74. The decisions of the Crimea Conference were distributed in a cyclostyled bulletin from the Publicity Office before the general public had heard of them from other sources and created considerable interest ? doing something to dispel the widespread local belief that disagreement is growing between Britain and Russia. There was’ of course disappointment at the absence of reference to Persia’s problems. POOR RELIEF 75. A further twenty destitutes were collected by the police at the request of the Committeeof A.P.R.R.P. and sent to the Caravanserai at Shakari, thus increasing the number of poor maintained there to 160 persons. Out of the above 20, ten were later found to have deserted and returned to the town as they were professional beggars. Fewer beggars are now seen in the town as able-bodied men have now g^ne to villages in search of work on the land. SKIPPING 76. S.S.

LOCAL AFFAIR S. 42. A supplementary edition of the local newspaoer, ivhalij-i-Iran, was published soon after the arrival of General Firus. wherein his intervention was requested in the following matters (i) Sanction for the distribution of rationed cloth to the public after a period of over a year of ^on- issue. (ii) Arrangement for the issue of cigarettes for Bushire which has received none of those arriving in Shiraz from Tehran. (iii) The lifting of the recent embargo on the ear ring of certain foodstuffs such as potatoes', ghi,fruits ana vegetables from Shiraz to Bushire. (iv) Provision of firewood and charcoal 'for Bushire town where there is a shortage. .(v) As existing bakeries are over-crowded and Hit. quail hv of bread supplied is of inferior quality the number c?V bakeries should be increased and the supple 0 f flour improved.

This caused a flutter anon,, the merchantsan'i the owner of a consignment of 105 ba^s of potatoes appealed to the Governor and the Chamber of Commerce a ainst military interference in trade matters.

The cereal stock position is as followsJ- Whe a t 29 tons. Barley 152 tons. More wheat is said to be on the way from ohiraz. 32. It was reported in paragraph 24 of Shiraz Diary for November 15th - 30th s 1944&gt; that ohiraz Khurbar department had made an interest^*;, M discovery' that Fathullah Khan Hint Baud had taken an adv .nee of ten million rials as well as monopoly poods for wheat deliveries in which he had fallen so short that he owed the Depart ment some 4-p million rials. The 'discovery' is some what surprising as presumably the Xh^rbar had been handling the transaction ( and paying advances) to Fathullah Khan since his renewed contract was signed in the autumn of 1943. If it re.lly is a discovery 3 then little credit io reflected on the accounts side of the Kharbar Department. Fathullah Ivbun has been tryi-a, to draw up accounts with the Kharbar Department for the last 6 months and to have some of the considerable transport charges owin^ to him set off uyainot the Kh^rbar dues. His efforts were further complicated by his haviny been allowed by Bushire Ivharbar in e 3 .rly 1544 a set off of 1,CQQ tons for seed wheat in the contract 3 which amount was, however, arbitrarily curtailed to 500 tons by the Tehran authorities y some months later when he had already distributed and sown the 1,900 tons fc Fathullah was able to produce 2,000 tons of prain in a famine year and saved Bushire from starvation thereby, a contingency viewed with equanimity and from a purely departmental view by the B..iraz authorities, who however had previously seen nothing out of the way in rant inn co..tracts for areas which did not exist to men who had no prain. That he ...ade some md^iey on the deal is not so surprising as the fact that whereas he produced 75/o of his contract amount a prominent Shirazi contractor, Hislnmat al Manalik, onl}^ produced from the we 11-irrigated Shahbankareh area of Bushire a « per cent of a promised 2,000 tons, without the penal clauses of his con-tract beiny invoked ay ainst him. Kharbar officials in Bushire admit that owiny to crop failure last year Fathuil^h has fulfilled part of his engagements by buyiny black market w-.eat at a much hal, her price than that paid to him by Government. There is some yround for the belief that part of the opposition engineered ayainst him is to be laid at the feet of some Xharb..r officials who are anxious for Fathullah to buy them off. 33.

TRIBAL ' D POLITICAL , Fathullah Khan Hiat Baud has reported that Nasir Khan QaBniax sounded him in Shiraz recently whether he would be^ able + o arrange a visit by Nasir to see the Pol itical Resident in Bushire. Nasir also proposed to visit Fathullah Khan in Bandar Rig and Fathullah presumed that Nasir wished to visit Bushire from Be ndar Rig. Fathullah asked the Political Resident what reply he should give and was informed that he would do well t# evade^ politely Nasir's proposal to visit him at Bandar Rig from which Nasir would conclude that his desire to visit Bushire was a l s ® not received with enthusiasm. It seems clear that such a visit made outside Nasir’s sphere of influence to the salt water of the Gulf would serve only to enhance Nasir 1 s prestige at the^ expense the £&gt;ro-British Hiat Daudis . Fathullah Khan admitteo -fchat hef'stood to lose rather than gain by such a ^visit and was merely concerned to reject the proposal with politeness. (b) Hid Majesty’s Consul returned the call of Sargurd Pakravan, Officer Commanding, Bushire, on 8th December. This officer is a son of the notorious and pro-Russian Fathullah Pakravan wh* was Persian Ambassador to Moscow from 1931-1934 and thereafter Governor-General of Khorasan until relieved by Ali Mansour in 1942. Perhaps this officer shares some of his father’s pro-Russian sentiments. When the conversation turned to th* Russians he remarked that it was a mistake to identify too closely the Russians and the Tudeh party. The latter represented a rdal social movement in Persia which deserved recognition. He also discounted rumours of Russian designs of penetration in the south and flirtation with the tribes. The Sargurd said he had formed the impression from his recent tours in Dashti and Tangistan that the constant disputes and bickerings of the Khans were not important or a considerable threat to security. He considered the military position in the area satisfactory and that he would have no difficulty in handling any situation which might arise. ^ He did not consider that the Qashqai enjoyed any considerable influence in Dashti. He wished to improve land and sea communications with Dashti, however, and was making proposals to his superiors. This engaging and well-educated young officer has shown commendable energ; in touring the Dashti and Tangistan area frequently since his arrival. He appears frank and outspoken and that he was not concerned to express before a British officer a conventional alarmist view of Russian designs need not to be taken unfavourably. The same officer has applied for membership of the Residency Library and is anxious to have English classes arranged for his officers. (c) Reference paragraph II (a) of Summary No. 22 Sargurd Pakravan claims to have succeeded in concluding an amicable settlement between Rais Ali Chahpiri ( Tangistani ) and Husain Namju. Husain Namju agreed ta receive Rials 27,000/- as compensation for the damage done by Ali Chahpiri and Ghulam Razmi's men, when they plundered his houses at Kulul and Talheh. Rials 20,000/- has been already paid to Husain Namju and Ali Chahpiri has guaranteed to pay the balance of Rials 7,000/- as soon'as he has collected it from Ghulam Razmi. Husain Namju is now waiting to receive the balance before he proceeds to Shiraz for the hearing of the case against him.

The first excursion of the new mobile dispensary was made, appropriately enough, to Chaghadak, the scene of YJasmuss ' s farming and benevolent activities which failed so signally. His Majesty’s Consul accompanied the dispensary in order to gain experience useful in organising further visits. The visit was extremely well received. It was astonishing to see the rapidity with which villagers flocked to the dispensary some with horrible' sores, ulcers y and burns which had been festering for'weeks without attention and would have continued so until blood-poisoning set in or the sore became chronic. One child :hs produced who- had been in chronic, pain with stone in the kidneys for two years and had never been treated. No inhabitant could remember any Persian doctor visiting the plate. Chaghadak had suffered .badly from drought in recent years and many of the inhabitants had gone off to seek work at Abadan. Wassmuss’s ramshackle former quarters are still to be seen and one of the last vestiges of his activities, a rusty and broken old harrow, is u^fd by the Gendarmerie of the post next door to bar the road at night. Three other visits were made by the dispensary during the fortnight to Ahmedi and villages towards Borazjun. The visits were extremely well received. VII. FOOBbTUFFS .

Consul informed the Commission that he noted their view that the arrangement was considered satisfactory but felt bound to point out that the allowing of Mohammad Ali to live in the ifort (it is mere playing with words to day that he is not in the fort) appeared to be a breach of the agreement signed by Mohammad Ali Khan and in consideration of which this Consulate had agreed to the -return of the latter. The Commission has gone to Shiraz to report to the Governor-General. (b) Reference paragraph 5 (b) of Summary No. 15, Ali Ismail who had received a letter of assurance from Sarhang Dadsitan, until recently O.C. troops at Kazeroon, has now settled again at his old house and village situated at the north of Galahzani. He is said to have delivered 12 rifles to the military and received 4 Government rifles. H.M. Connul is inquiring what guarantees have been taken from him in return for his reinstatement in his own area. (c) To settle the quarrel at Faqih Hasanu previously reported, Sargurd Pakravan the new O.C. troops visited the place and arrested Niru, the alleged murderer of Falaknaz. Abbas Faqih an employee of the Bushire Post and Telegraphs who paid to acquire the post of Kadkhuda at Faqih Hananu has had to return to Bushire. (Abbas Faqih is the son of the Faqih Mohammad ,who was in 1918 the anti-British Kadkhuda of Faqih Hasanu;. ' Abbas Faqih only obtained this post for the purpose of receiving the sugar and tea ration for the area, duly profiting, and returning to Bushire. (d) Reference paragraph 5 (b) of^Summary 19.

The latter has had to leave Ziarat as he has lost favour with the Gendarmerie.-3- VI. PUBLIC RELATIONS The Cdinema projector was brought from Shiraz by H.i . Consul and performances have been given. The cinema was very welcome after a prolonged absence. The Heading Hoorn at Borazjan was visited by the Publicity Assistant who found it popular and well frequented. VII. FOODSTUF FS Heavy fain has fallen in all areas and the total rainfall to date is over 4 inches. Distribution of the seed wheat provided by the Government of India had been almost completed well before the rain came and cultivators are busy sowing seed. A timely experiment carried our locally has shown the Government of India wheat to have a higher yield than the local variety and cultivators generally are impressed with the quality of the seed. There is every prospect of record sowings this year. Near Bushire land not cultivated for years has been broupht under the plough, even waste land at the side of Gabzabad road being cultivated. H.M. Consul has planted in his garden two plots side by side with the Government of India and the local seed wheat. , VIII. TRADE AND SHIPPING S.S. Resang arrived on the 16th from Bahrain.

All but 150 tons have been distributed and this balance will be disposed of very shortly. A rood marpin of time remains for sowingand prospects of successful Termination of the seed are excellent as the result of a recent good fall of rain throughout the greater part of the coastal area, from Dilam to As lu and cevond. SHIPx^ING AND COI&amp;IERCE . 1254 packages were cleared from the Customs d\rir|g the fortnight. These consisted of 225 packages of cotton piecegoods, 933 baps of sugar, 19 chests of oea, 22 packages sundries ad 55 sacks of empty bottles.

Dr. Hisabi, Governor of Bushire, accompanied by Aqai Farzaneh, who is in charge of the Irrigation Department, Bushire, returned to Bushire on October 21st. Both had been on \eave. 11. LOCAL AFFAIRS . . (a) Paragraph (d) Summary No. 13. ■ *ih. With the return from leave of Aqai Farzaneh, a fresh impetus has been given to the scheme for piping water to Bushire frc't All Changi. Aqai Farzaneh estimates that it will take about 6 weeks to lay the 5 miles of ear them piping which remain to link up the water-bearing area with the site for the first pump:Nation, from which point the iron piping supplied by the Briti^. k^itary authorities will be taken into use. He estimates that it will take about 6 months to lay the latter, as ill is to be laid underground and most of the area as far as Bushire through wha-oh the pipe will pass has a substratum of limestone close below the surface. Siiitable pumping-engines * have not yet been found and it is possible that this Consulate General will be asked to assist in obtaining them from outside Persia. A Russian engineer returned with Aqai Farzaneh to assist in the task of laying the iron piping. The Governor informed His Majesty’s Consul that he had been engaged on contract by the Ministry of Irrigation, Tehran. He added that he came from -Lithuania, but had been engaged in engineering in Persia and Germany during the last 10 years and cldimad? to have a British passport. (b) It is rumoured -that Aqai Ghiasi has succeeded in Tehran in buying himself the post of Assistant Director of the F nance Department, Bushire, of which he was p most corrupt, iviolent and inefficient Director in 1941-42. His record during t '3 recent elections was also far from savoury, Aqai Rustaiyan, the present Director of the Department who is also Director of the Cereals and Bread Department is reported to have refused' to hav .* him on his staff, which is already over-loaded with lethargic and incompetent .deadweights. Rustaiyan is himself thoroughly capable and honest; it is as deplorable as it seems to be inevitable that a thrusting individual such as he should be so greatly hampered through lack of r€liable subordinates. III. C J' 'NICATIONS . The Governor recently informed His Majesty's Consul that proper expenditure on the repairs of the greater part of the. • Bushi-x-Sabzabad road had been approved and that repairs would be put in ham very shortly. This is most welcome news, The execrable condition n which this road has for long been has been the cause of dispro o tionately heavy wear and tear on motors using it, prices of spare oerts and tyres for which remain as astronomically highu.- Residency vehicles and private cars of officers of the Consulate General running daily between Bushire and Sabzabad (dist- icq - 7 miles ) have been particularly affected. IV, P UBLIC ' .i • 7H. Malaria is increasing. The health of the town is otherwise much the same. V, TRa.jftAL AND POLITICA L. (a) Paragraph V (a) of Summary No. II. A Commission, under the direction of the Governor General, is now sitting in Shiraz to settle the affairs of Liravi as between Fathullah Khan Hiat Baud and Mohd .Ali Khan. The latter seized the fort of Hisar some two years ago and has since been the cl£ f qcto ruler of the Liravi roost, until evicted by a military column some months ago. He has since spent his timd consolidating his position, with Persian officialdom in Behbehan and Tehran. Fathullah Khan 1 s\ claims to Liravi are now unassailable in view of the co: elusion by him recently of negotiations to purchase or take on leas 3 those parts of•Liravi not previously held by him on lease. Mohd. A' 1*5 record in Liravi has consistently been of the blackest and it : *, much to be hoped, that the findings of the Commission will result ir his permanent expulsion from Liravi, which will then, under Hiat Baud, be added to the united Rud Hilleh-Hiat Baud bloc, the unbroken security of which has been of su$h marked value to us during the war. (b) Paragraph V (b) last Nummary. t \ • / Orders have now been issued for the capture, dead or alive, of HUssaih Ali, who is still in the hills, where he is reputed to have collected a gang of about 20 armed men. Apparently his intention of murder:! r Ali Qhahpiri and Ghulam Razmi has not abated and he has added t . name of Barwan Namwar, Officer Commanding Bushire Garrison, to the list of those whom he intends to liquidate. Ali Ohahpiri does not seem to be unduly worried by the threat to his life and was last heard of going the rounds of the Jangistani ports collecting his usual taxes on smuggled goods, of which there is no^ dearth in those parts, VI , PUBLIC RELAT IONS. There is little change in the general attitude towards the war. The Churchill-otalin talks have aroused interest and are quoted as proof of the solidarity of Anglo-Russian friendship; no deeper implications are seen into them. Axis broadcasts continue to decrease in popularity. With the arrival of the cooler weather and the return to Bushire of many of its members, attendance at the Reading Room has been very satisfactory. Persistent enquiries continue to be received about the ;Cinema Van, which is most popular in this are , but which unfortunately continues to beg^rf^l in Shiraz with a 1 ^oken axle. VII. FOODSTUFFS . The full 800 tons of seed-wheat from India have iow arrived. Arrangements for the distribution of this wheat and of the 400 tons of barley being sent from Shiraz are proceeding most satisxactorily under the able supervision of the Governor, who is taking a vewy keen interest in proceedings, and of the Director of the Cereals and Bread Department. VIII. SRI P fNG AND COHLiSRCE . 1,442 packages were cleared from the Customs during the fortnl .. They consisted of ISO bales of Eatianx cotton piece-goods, 578 bags oF sugar, 30 bags of cement, 68 bags of flour, 220 bags of empty bottles, 10 packages of woollen thread, 232 bales of cotton, 15 bags of ice, 13 bags of red chillies, 9 bundles of copper, 50 bags of lime am 17 packages of sundries.BUSHIRE INTELLIGENCE dUMUARY NO.

(a) As the result of the virtual standstill to which business has come in the local and up-country markets, sales of the products of the Etemadiyeh Mill. Bushire, have decreased to vanishing point and the Mill is now said to hold accumulations of stock amounting to 80Q90Q metres. The number of shifts in the Mill has in consequence been decreased and 250 hands have been thrown out of work. There is a prospect of further substantial reductions being made in the near future in the sc P le of labour employed. (b) The precipitate decline in the black market price of sugar led to the refusal of Kadkhudas and other recognised agents to accept the Government sugar ration for the.month of ohahrivar. The price of Government sugar per b p g is only Rials 2000, but since an approximately similar amount per bag has to go to meet the demands of the usual array of petty intermediate officials, no margin of potential profit from the subsequent sale in the black market of the Government sugar would have been left, the black market price per bag at the time having dropped to Rials 4000, with a few quotations at an even lower figure. With a later increase in the black market figure, however, the agents intimated that they would be willing ta accept the Government ration.(c) A.ter investigating the running of the Government bakeries, in the cour ,e of his Bushire tour, Captain 1 they were in future to be exclusively under the control ottne Cereals and Bread Department.

Two British military supervisors of the Edareh-i-Barbari Rah were stationed in Bushire for short periods at the beginning of this year (vide paras.

Special policemen are now searching the luggage ox travellers arriving at Bushire by sea, after they have passed through the Customs shed, and are confiscating any foreign goods discovered. A number of protests have been made. (b) Two British army tanker lorries, each of 600 gallons capacity, have arrived at Bushire and are now on loan to the Company which is arranging for the supply of drinking water in the J town. The arrival of these tankers has been the subject of much favourable comment among Bushiris, many of whom have expressed their gratitude for this assistance given to them by the British Army. The water situation has now flatly improved and the price of one “skin' of water has dropped to Rials 3.50. (c) The Persian Government have issued a double sugar ration (i.e. one kilo per head) to the public, for the month of Ramazan (d) Aqai Hussain Shabankareh has been^appointed as nead of the local Municipality in place of Aqai Kasmai. Dr. ..isabi, the Governor, was opposed to his appointment as he had a bad £eFeif»n record with the Police, but Aqai Shabankareh has fjade the most of the Governor's absence on leave, by visiting Shiraz, where he 'arranged' his posting orders. (e) Robbers twice made an appearance in the village of^ Imamzadeh, near Sabzabad, but they did not succeed in making off with any loot. III. COMMUNICATIONS. Nil. IV. PUBLIC HEALTH. Health in the town has been good, and compared with last wear's figures, the incidence* of malaria shows a marked decrease. drop in night temperatures has resulted in a few cases 0 f influenza. £3 (d) The English c?~cses ? mentioned in para. VI (1^ Qf^last Summary, are progressing well and students continue .0 display considerable enthusiasm. (b' At a commission held earlier this summer in the Governorate, it was decided J :nat a leca tital of 2300 tons of seed wheat would 1 be reouired for distribution to cultivators in the Bushire area, and in view of the complete failure of the last crop it is of pan mount importance that this seed be made available in good time for sowing’in the month of November. It is hoped that the Persian authorities will ensure that the seed is distributed during October. VIII. SHIPPING AND COMHIER CE. (a) 1,468 pa:kages were cleared from the Customs during the fortnight.

(c) Persian Officials., Captain Namwar, Officer Commanding‘Bushire Garrison, left for Dashti on the 29th September. II. LOCAL AFFAIRS. (a) One of the local newspapers, the Khalij-i-Iran, has oublished an article containing favourable comment on the arrival of two British Military Tanker lorries which have been lent to the Company organizing the supply oi drinking water for the to ; ^ . The article pays tribute to the assistance given by the British authorities to help solve the water problem in Bushire, and alo, points out that the supply of iron piping xor the^Ali uhangi drinking water project could never have been obtained without help from the British .(see paragraphs 11(d) and 11(b) of oummaiieo Nos'. 13 and 17 respectively). (b) The Bushire Petty Court has been raised to the status oi a District Court and it is understood that the Judge, Aqai Qutb, who is on leave in Shiraz, is to be relieved, (c) Scandals over the distribution of the Government sugar ration, which were the subject of comment in paragraph 11(a) of Summary Ho.16, still continue. Ali Chahpiri arranged to draw tne double ration of sugar and tea sanctioned by Government for ^he month of Ramzan, and then proceeded to issue 300 grammes of sugar and 20 grammes of tea (i.e. less than one-third the quantity due to each individual) to only 80/^ of tne population of Tang is tan This means that out of 11,800 kilos of sugar drawn, All Chahpiri was left with approximately 8,600 kilos for sale on the black market, and his only complaint will now be that the black market price of sugar is dropping- III. CQMLIHNICATXQNS^ Nil.2 IV. PUBLIC HEALTH. ^5) X There have been no epidemics or infectious diseases and with the exception of a few cases of influenza and sandfly- fever 9 the health of the town is has been good. TRIBAL AND POLITICAL. (a) Reference paragraph V(a) of last Summary, the local press have published an article stating that as the result of a petition submitted by Mohammad Ali Liravi, and representations ff^de by Aqai Sultani, Deputy in the Majlis for Behbehan, a committee h^s been appointed by the Governor-General of Pars, to enquire into the state of affairs in Liravi. (b) The wife of Ali Chahpiri Tangistani has attempted to intervene in the quarrel between her husband and son (Ghulam Hussain). Ali Chahpiri has now agreed to place one village in the charge of his son but he is still refusing to allow him to return to Ahram. Shaikh Daud, the agent for the distribution of sugar in Tangistan, is still in Shiraz awaiting the result of his complaint lodged against Ghulam Hussain who has threatened to kill him (see paragraph.V(a) of last Summary). (c) The Gendarmerie have posted fifteen gendarmes at the Tangistan port of Madumari. (dO Reference paragraph V(b) of last Summary, nussain Hamju has now been transferred to the military jail, and attempts are being made to round up Husain Ali (Namju’s nephew) wno is still in hiding. The Commander of the Kazerun garrison recently pro ceeded to Ahram in this connection. (e) The assailants in the affray near Charak in which Shaikh Abdur Rahman al Obaidli of Armak was wounded (see paragraph no; of Summary No.16), have been identified as the followers of Shaikh Ali al Hamadi of Mugam. It appears that Shaikh Yasir Nasuri of Gavbandi has united with the Hamadis of Mugam, Kalat and Murbagh, and the Lashkunis of Lar, against Shaikh Mohammed al Ali of Charak who has appealed to Tehran for Government assistance. The latter is attempting to make out that military operations should be undertaken against Shaikh Ali al Hamadi. VI. PUBLIC RELATIONS^ (a) Bushiris are still expecting the War in Europe to be over in the near future and this has been reflected in a further drop in the prices of tea, sugar and piecegoods. (b) The advent of cooler weather has been responsible for an increase in the popularity of the Club and Reading Room. VII. FOODSTUFFS. (a) The Cereal and Bread Department are now issuing a'mixture of 50;S wheat and 50* barley to the bakeries in the town. This is naturally a very popular move as Bushiris have been xorced eat' bread with 80$ barley content, the whole of this summer. Stocks of wheat and barley held in Bushire on the 30th September we re : - Wheat 277 tons Barley 174 tons (b) The Agent of Aqai Fathullah Khan, Hiat Daudi, at confiscated about 35 tons of wheat which were found hoarded by some local merchants, who at once started various intrigues to hold up the delivery of wheat due to Government from Liravi. A floou of telegraphic complaints resulted in a visit to Dilam by the Chief of Police who found that the intrigue w a s instigated hvbv Mohammad All Khan tat present in Tehran attempti.- - to secure his reinstatement in iiravi). All difficulties are said to have been settled, and a consignment of 50 tons of wheat is now await- ^ ing shipment to Bushire from Dilam. The Police are forwarding an official report to the capital, VIII. K' T TPPTWfi AMD COMMERCE.

His Majesty’s Consul, Bushire.ta Mr« Harrisojau Mr. Nind. These papers, which have been sent to us by the Foreign Office for perusal and return, are extremely interesting. They consist of a long note (ik pages) by the Governor of Bush ire, putting forward various suggestions for the improvement of conditions - social, economic and administrative - in Southern Persia, to which Sir Geoffrey Prior has added his comments. The Governor discusses the reasons for the migration from the South Persiaicoast, and suggests certain measures for the improvement of agriculture, irrigation, sanitation, administration, education and medical facilities. He is in favour of the re alignment of the Bushire-Shiraz road via Farrash Band and Firuzabad, (a proposal which was put forward by the Political Resident some * months ago), and has ideas about the development of purjtive waters, resumption of the pearl trade, and the encouragement of fisheries. Sir Geoffrey Prior's comments on the Governor's note are amusing and very interesting, since he looks at the problem from the point of view of the Gulf as a whole. He goes further than Dr. Hisabi in advocating the introduction of mechanical cultivation in this region, but on the whole agrees with his views and suggestions, though expressing doubts whether the South Persian ports will ever be able to re-gain the trade which has passed into the hands of merchants on the Arab side. The Political Resident re- enforces the Governor's suggestion for the re-establishment of a Governorate of the Southern pbrts - a project he has put forward before, and emphasizes the need for employing local men as Government officials. The Governor's note, and the Political Resident's letter 'suitably edited 1 have been sent to the Shah, the Persian Prime Minister, and Dr. Millspaugh, who have expressed their interest.sir—*.

(a) Numerous complaints are being made to the Governorate, and representations have also been made to this Consulate, on the subject of the issue of tea and sugar rations By the Finance Department and the various representatives who nan 1 distribution in outlying districts. The Finance Department base their issues to distributing agents on the number of persons said to be residing in the various areas, and oh^ir total monthly issue of sugar and tea for oU t districts is about 58 and 5.8 tons respectively, against the official figure of oopulation which totals 116, 263. * Each individual is supposed to receive* 500 grammes of sugar and 50 grammes P® r month, the official Government price Being Rials W** Rials 80/- per kilo, respectively. The hlac.c market rates fluctuate between Rials 80/- and 110/- for one ^ilo of and Rials 250 to 300 per kilo of tea, open up a vast for corruotion, misappropriation, and intrigue among who have no scruples and are anxious to make quick for- and in some areas the peasantry have been lucky if they seen a few grammes of the ration due to them. One which sugar fie Id those tunes have complaint recently received quotes the case of Xangistan where the distributing agent is a minion of Ali Chahpiri, named 'Jhaikh Daud. He draws 5900 kilos of sugar a month for 11,800 persons, is said to issue approximately one fifth of this Quantity only, and out of the balance left in hand he makes a clear profit (on sugar alone) of over Rials 300,000 per month, by selling on the black market (Ali Chahpiri is quickly becoming a verv rich man). A number of Government officials are said to be obtaining a considerable n rake off ,, from the various distributing agents, but apart from the disgraceful money ^ Q \r± n r side of this business, serious repercussions may arise ‘'L v’v' in districts, where feuds are now starting between Iftfl 'Ntc r ■» / A j y ~ -ly o t Le to secure the2 distributing agency for Government rations. The of the Persian Government making any attempt to i state of affairs, and vested interests are so gre; be hard to change the present system. j.he .irmy c freely admit that at present, this ration issue sy resoonsible for half the tribal troubles in these matter has been brought to the notice the amer. the Finance Deoartment, Fans, who states that plan formulated for' the introduction of a new system of «, are no sir'-S -rove this ; that it will id Gendarmerie .item is rts. (This .an adviser of s have been distribution)- (b) Reference paragraph II (a) of diary No.15. A few minor cases of robbery on the roads in Bushire have again been reported during the past fortnight, but no large gangs have been operating, hn^hold-ups after d a rk; a few pedestrians have been relieved of their money and clothes. (c) The folloY/ing information about date growing in the Bushire area was recently given by a knowledgeable landowner, and is considered to be fairly accurate The main date growing area- are Dashti, Tangistan and Bashtistan, while further to the north, in Hiat Baud, the dates produced scarcely suffice for 1 oca 0 consumption. The date crop, which is an excellent one this year, is mostly picked between the 15th September and the 15th October, during which time, the average yield from o palm is approximately 30 kilos. The dates are norma ^ A | istan in baskets, the average weights of which are 30 kilos in Tangista. and Dashti, and 50 kilos in Dashtistan. The cultivator is at present asking approximately Rials 200 for 100 kilos of ^t , a distinct drop in price when compared with last year s figur of Rialx 350, which itself was half the price of dates in 1942-43. The Persian Government have placed an embargo on tn exoort of dates. Another factor which has led to a fall in the price of dates, is that no lorry transport is available for the despatch of consignments to the interior. III. COMMUNICATIONS . (a) Following a hold up between Ka 7 erun and Shiraz, in which some Persians were killed, lorry convoys are now leaving Borazjan for Shiraz in the early morning, all arrangements for convoys to trave, at night having been suspended. ( (b) A number of the bridges and culverts on the Shiraz road between Kunar Takhteh and Bushire have bad state of repair for some time past, and the Persian o Department? have at last started w ° rk .°^ f s g®® 1 ^ lve Thf bridge were badly holed in the neighbourhood of Daliki. The bri g jost south of Ahmadi is still in very bad condition. IV. PUBLIC HEALTH . Thera have been a large number of guinea-worm infections in Bushire this summer, and it is believed that these para sites are breeding in the rain-water storage tanks which, nwinf 7 to last winter's drought, were never properly filled with fresh water. Formerly^ iA the majority of guinea-worm cases aeen here, the infection had been contracted in Bandar Abbas. During the past te» days there have been a few cases of dy^lentry and enteric fever. V. Ti^TBAL AND POLITICAL, (a) During his stay in Bushire, and also while on tour Division^made special inquiries into tAe affairs of Hussain Hamlu of Baluk Darazi, whose arrest was mentioned in Para- Frabh V (a) of last sAmmary. Substantial proof is said to haJe been produced showing that Natnju was guilty of being in possession of goods stolen in Bushiro, and he is still in custody. ^3 (b) His Maiesty's Consular Agent at Lingah r&lt;r &gt;orts that Shaikh Abdur Rahman al Obaidali of Armak, and his nephew, Ibrahim, were recently attacked by unknown person; about 18 mnes North West of Charak, the Shaikh being wouna d and his nephew killed. It is also learned that fighting o ; a s naii scale is going on between Shaikh Yasir al Nasuri o- Gavbandi, and some tribal elements from the interio ?' 1 ^ Lashku , i-pa langanah of Lar), but details of the trouble are still awaited. (c) The Officer Commanding Bushire Gendarmerie has proceeded to Shabankareh in connection c i an p a ^g?aph between Hishmat-ul-Mamalik and Amirullah Khan (ex. paragrap ' r (a) of Summary No. 14 of 1944). One of the ba Hussain c ’Ployed by Hishmat-ul-M a malik is Abbas, son of J^d Hussam, of Ana who has collected a number of armed followers to o 'pose Amirullah, and the Gendarmerie are now attempting ffiufl^ll rti^fL^^irfz 5^1 Hlshmat- Aqa^fr^ r^Khisht^presumably S in d the hope^hat^he^wlll _be a ^de to stop the Persian authorities taking any action which will restore Amirullah his rights. (d) All Chahpiri is reported to have fallen out with his son, Ghulam Hussain, over a dispute connected with the dis tribution of Government sugar in n ? h ^h ra fa ther and apparently made two abortive attempts to shoot his father ana a number of oppressed Tangistanis are regretting that he was not a better shot. VI. PUBLIC RELATIONS... (a) Every new Allied success is welcomed by the Bushire public as yet another stepping stone to the rapid achievement nf oehe and a return to a normal existence, with prices at reasonable level. The premature announcements made by the B.B.C. regarding the liberation of p aris, ‘_arseilles a d TWdPaux were the subject of some criticism, but ^nis nas ^suited inanydir ihtion in the popularity of the B.B.C. news bulletin^ The Persian daily news sheet issued by the Consulate, is in great demand.

PUBLIC HEAL -yvrr -L - - O , % iialaria Is on the increase and, as is usual at ;his time of the year, eye diseases are prevalent There have been a few cases of amoebic dysentry and one isolated case ol diphtheria. V. TRIBAL AIID POLITICAL . (a) Follo T »inr the developments in Tang is tan mentioned in paragraph V(bj of last summary, Captain Ramwar, Officer Commanding troops, Bushire, proceeded to Tangistan to investigate the cause of the trouble From all reports received, it arrears that All Chahriri succeeded b lying the suprort of Captain ilamwar (some say that Rial? 30,000 changed hands) and military action has now been directed against the party oprosing Rais Ali. A small ^army^force proc eeded to Kulul (10 miles south of Ahram) and after heralding their arrival with a fev; shots at the _villare, they searcned various houses, and finally arrested i:ius:;ain i.am.]u for complicity in the theft of certain stolengoods said to have been recovered during the search. hussain Parma is now in custody, and is accused of having organized the recent roboenes in Bushire, but the re is believed to be little or this accusation Some troops proceeded to_ Rhaviz (7 miles south east of Ahram) at the same time, and I-urtaza i-n.an (another of Ali Chahpiri’s onnonentsO fearing the sane fate n S Namiu, fled tn the hills. Once again Ali Chahpiri appears to have su«. ceedcd „n consolidating his position in langiotan, a- og used some more of his ill gotten money on an officer who hes a most unsavoury reputation for filling his pocket at evyw avails le opportunity. (b) Reference paragraph V (d) of Bushire nummary No. 11 of 1U44, negotiations are still oroceedlng between tlie military authorities and Ali Ismail, the Dashti outlaw, who, it is understood, has now guaranteed to hand over 30 rifles to Government. His case, however, has not been finally settled. (c) Amirullah Khan of Shabankareh whose detention in the Shiraz prison was mentioned in paragraph V (a) of last summary, is still apparently in custody. oarhang khosrodad, Officer Commanding Fars Gendarmerie, who is at present in Bushire, is enquiring into this natter. (d) Conditions in Liravi are reported to be far more satisfactory now that Mohd Ali Khan has left Risar (c.f. paragraph P (a) of Bushire ounmary No. 11 oi 1^44).. There hi been a marked decrease in arms smuggling rlong the^coast and^ from all accounts, the peasantry are more than satisfied with the developments which led to the departure of Rohd Ali Khan from Liravi. VI. PUBLI C RELATI ONS. (a) News' of the Allied landing in southern France was received enthusiastically by the Bushire public, who now believe that Germany's defeat is imminent.

II (b) of last summary ), tea Officer Commanding Gendarmerie and Officer Commanding 'the military . garrison, were requested to organize special patrols to deal with the gangs of armed robbers who were still at large. These patrols, however, have failed to achieve any satisfactory results and during the past fortnight a number of houses Have been attacked by armed parties, believed to consist largely of Tangistanis. Thieves made off with 400 yards of telephone wire owned by the Residency, and all efforts at recovery have so far failed. (b) An unidentified cattle lifting gang has also been operating in the vicinity of Borazrjan. (c) One Rasadban Mohammad Rustami, in charge of the Bushire prison, recently sought refuge in the Consulate-General - to escane ill-treatment at the hands of the chief of Police, Yawar Khomarlu. This individual was instructed to refer his grievances to the Governorate, and he is now engaged in running a case against the Police Department. Numerous complaints have been made against the high handed action and corruption of Yawar Vlionarlu who was posted here at the beginning of he year, and it is understood that orders for his suspension have seen issued, his relief having already left Tehran. Aqai Khalil Dashty, Deputy in the Majlis for Bushire is said to have arranged for Khomarlu’s removal in view of the suoport given by the Bushire Police to the local branch of the Adalat party, which is bitterly opposed to both the Bushire deputies. ( c.f. paragraph II (A) of Summary No. ° for 1944). (d) There has been an improvement in the gus ^ir e drinking water situation since the arrival of three lorries of the Rond Transport Department which have been given on loan, to bring water to' the town. A Committee has been formed and subscriptions collected, for the purpose of organizing the distribution of water, and poorer classes are .being given a free issue. Water vendors in the town have now been obliged to reduce their prices to Rials 7 per two skins. (e) Reference paragraph II (c) of last Summary. Orders were received in Bushire for the arrest of Shaikh Abdullah Buraz-. jani after his departure for Shiraz, where he is now said to be facing charges of misappropriation of Government monopoly goods.

(a) Colonel Dadsitan, Officer Commandinp troops at Kazeron, returned to Bushire from Dashti on the 23rd July and^th Itazeran, rerurnea to dubiixtb how next day proceeded to I lazerun, where he found orders of transfer awaiting him. ^ a 16 day tour) wlth transport consisting of two U.S.A. Army pattern 30-cwt trucks, he proceeded from XhormuJ to Kaki, thence to Burdakhan Nau and along the coast to Daiy r | • Tahiri From Tahiri he visited Jam ( or Djam on some raa?s j is in the'hills to the north of Tahiri, on horseback. On the return „ourney from Tahiri he went to. Kansan and then too re direct route between the Kuh-i-Darang and the Kuh-i-Uamak hills to Kaki, and thence to Khurmuj. ( It is believed that this is the first time that military transport has used the ro ^ e d the hills back to Kaki ). From all accounts, the tracks encountered were extremely bad going and springs on both the trucks were broken on several occasions. According to Colonel Dad oitan, conditiono in Dashti were quiet. (b) Reference paragraph III (a) of Summary No. 13. The Persian Air Service between Shiraz and Bushire has been sus pended until further notice. IV. PH BLIC HEAL TH. Bushire was singularly free from sickness during the last fortnight, and there have been no epidemics or serious cases of infectious disease. V. TRIBAL cl POLITICAL. (a) A dispute over land in the Shabankarah area is now going on between Aqai Hishmat-ul-Maraalik of Shiraz, an Amirullah IChan, son of the late Aqa Khan. The former has for the past ten years been leasing lands in the Baluks of Zira, Nazar Aqa^ and Darvahi, from the heirs of Haji Abdul Nabi Shahim, and althougn Hishmat sub-let the lands, he had been making himself extremely unpopular in the area by attempting to spread his influence and interfering in the affairs of the peasantry in an extremely high handed manner. Earlier this year, Amirullah Khan succeeded in leasing the lands in question, much to the chagrin of Hishmat-ul- Mamalik who enlisted the support of two bad characters to oppose Amirullah. As as Amirullah Khan observed that there was a danger of a breach of the peace, he proceeded to ohiraz, at the invitation of the Commander, Ears Division, to settle the matter amicably, and to declare his intention of co-operating with the Persian authorities in all affairs connected with Shabankarah. On . his arrival in Shiraz, however, due to the machinations of nishmay- ul-Msmalik, Amirullah was arrested on a charge of complicity in a murder case, but it is believed thati he has since succeeded in securing his release on bail. Locals in ^habankareh are to see a decline in the influence previously exercised by Hishmat- ul*Mamalik in their area, and popular opinion is on the side of Amirullah in this dispute. (b) Latest developments in Tangistan indicate that All Chahpiri ! s influence is on the wane, and that a number of Tan^istanis are becoming restless under his oppression. A faction consisting of the followers of Hussain Namju, Sardar Khan, Murtaza Baru, Mir Shikar and Kal Khairi ( widow of the late 3air Khidhar) recently advanced on Ahram and occupied the fort, threatening Ali r-v^nTr.-* with from Tangistan, but latest information-3- V / / Indicates that a compromise will p-^ably be arranged whereby Ali Chahoiri will remain at Ahram for the present. VI. PUBLIC RELATION S. (a) News of Allied progress in IIo'''-'ndy and the rapid x advance of the Red Army, has resulted in reread optimism regarding the early termination of the war in Axx^ooe. Little attention is being paid to the propaganda broadenb from. Berlin on the subject of ,f Secret weapons' employed by the Axis, which are now said to include the use of special sclent^ 'c instruments , which control the weather in Normandy, (b) Of the publicity material received from Tehran, the caricature of Rustam and Ashkabus, depicting the annihilation of the Axis leaders, is proving most popular and has been the subject of favourable comment. The new magazine for ladies, Alam-i-Zanan, is.likely to be a successful innovation. (c) The Cinema van has proceeded to Shiraz where it will remain for the summer months, and a number of requests have since been received for assistance in obtaining permanent cinema arrangements in Bushire. VII.' FOODSTUFF S. (a) Aqai Shamlu, Director of The Cereals &amp; Bread Department, proceeded to Shiraz on one month's leave and it is said he is unlikely to return. (b) A dhow carrying 34 tons of wheat from Liravi was recently wrecked near Bushire. All the cargo was lost but the crew and two passengers were rescued. SHIPPING £ COL.X.IBRCE .

(i) The Hon'ble Sir Geoffrey £r4.Qr proceeded to (ii) Major Sanderson, R.S., of G.H.Q., Paiforce, Baghdad, arrived at Bushire on July.3rd with the object of making preliminary arrangements for the Survey to be carried out later in the summer b^ a military Survey Party in connection with the I'lund River Irrigation project. On July 6th he pro ceeded to IGiormuj and the I!und River, accompanied by Hjl.’s Vice-Consul and Sarhang Dadsitan, O.C. Kazerun Area, returning to Bushire the following day. Persian Military trucks were provided for the transport of the party by the Sarhang, who also made all local arrangements and entertained the party at the military post at khormuj. The Sarhang’s attitude throughout the tour could not have been more co-operative and friendly. Major danderson left for Baghdad on July 11th. (iii) Mr. 3&lt;,A. Connolly of the Imperial Bank of Iran arrived from Tehran via Shiraz on 1st July and took over charge of the post of Manager of the Bushire branch of the Bank from hr, Eyers, who left for India on duty on 4th July.

On the return from Khormuj of the British party referred to at paragraph I (a) (ii) above, he proceeded on tour to Bandar-i-Silas„ II. LOCAL AFFAIRS. (a) .an incident which has aroused not inconsider able interest locally was the accidental death in somewhat peculiar circumstances on July 2nd. of a worker in the Etemadieh Cotton Mill, Bushire. The man had come into contact with a live wire which had been run round the water reservoir of the Lill by tne Acting Manager with the object of preventing the pollution of the reservoir by Mill-workers. The heirs of the deceased were paid the sum of Rls. 5000 by the Acting Manager. The matter w^s not, however, allowed to rest there and an official enquiry was instituted by’.jargurd Baigleri, the Officer Commanding Gendarmerie. The Acting Manager, who is a Czecho slovakian, eventually persuaded the authorities to drop the case by paying a total of Rls. 30,000 in bribes. The Sargurd’s share was Rls. 13,000. (b) The fortnight under renort has produced a spate of robberies in Bushire. The most important of these was a robbery under arms which took place in the' compound of a house hired by this Consulate-General, which was, however, emoty at the time and guarded only by watchmen. The watchmen were assaulted by a gang of about a dozen men, of whom several were armed with rifles, and had various articles of their personal prorert- stolen from then. It is oooularly supposed' that these Crums- the number of which is unpreeorg ;.eo 2.cerwere committed at the instigation of Sargurd Kuqarrab, the recently relieved O.C. Gendarmerie, with the object of discrediting his successor. Colour is lent to this supposition by the fact^that the two men are not on good terms with eacn otner and that oargur Muqarrab was far from pleased at being relieved. (c) The Monopoly Department, Shiraz, have brought to light further discrepancies in consignments of delivered by Sheikh Abdulla Borazjani ( reference paragraph \TLI {c) oT the last summary ). The latest example is the shortage of one length of cloth from each bale of a consignment of piece-goods recently delivered at Shiraz. The Customs Department at Bushire, .rom whom the consignment was taken over by Sheikh Abdulla, the lengths were removed by the latter as ' samples and :iave reported in addition that the agents of this gentleman were caught in the act of smuggling out of the Customs ambars two bales of th best quality cloth. (d) Reference paragraph II (b) of Summary, No. 9 of 1944. A request for assistance in obtaining the amount of piping required to complete the Bushire drinking-water scheme was in due course addressed by the local Persian authorities to this Consulate-General, which forwarded it with a strong recommend ation. The British military authorities have since agreed to supply 6 miles of iron piping and have in addition agreed to re lease 2 tanker-lorries for the carriage of water to Bushire pending the completion of the scheme. The delivery of the much-needed iron piping, which has now reached Bushire by sea, will very greatly assist towards its completion. The tanker-lorries, which, i is hoped, will arrive in the near future, will remove the main water- supply difficulties at present experienced by the local authorities, who have, as a temporary measure, pressed into service an Irrigation Department lorry for the supply of drinking-water to Bushire town. The extreme urgency of the need for an efficient scheme for the supply of water is illustrated only too sharply by the fact that sweet drinking-water is now selling in the town at Rls. 5 per skin. III. COMMUNICATIONS . Reference paragraph III (a) of the last Summary. The first aeroplane® of the new air service to land at Bushire arrived on July 3rd., followed by a second on July 2th. Neither machine carried regular mails. One passenger C iurs. Connolly, wife of the new Manager of the local Branch ox the Imperial Bank of Iran) arrived by the first and two passengers were ’taken to Shiraz in the second. It is understood that the machines used seated three passengers only. IV. PUBLIC HEALTH. Malaria continues to be on the Increase. The numbers of cases of whooping-cough and broncho-pneumonia have decreased, while no further cases of pnaumonia or influenza havq been noted. V. TRIBAL AND POLITICAL . (a) In the course of an interview with the Governor at Bushire, Sarhang Dadsitan informed the latter that he had been experiencing difficulty in persuading chiefs of tribal areas to send their young men for compulsory military service. He added that he had accordingly made a proposal, which had been accepted, tkat only those chiefshould be issued'with Government rationed commodities who could show a statement signed by the Conscription authorities to the effect that all men of their areas required for conscription had duly presented themselves before those authorities The Sarhang said that the scheme had proved a success in other tribal areas where he had introduced it, notably in Laristan, and kbat he propcSfid 9 Trto effect in Ms Area forthwith. The3. effects of the scheme will be watched with interest. -*t first ^ sifht ^ # it would appear only to afford excellent additional^o] 'ortunities for peculation and excuses for the further, withholding of rationed goods from the tribes (b) Reference paragraph V (c) of the last Summary Ali Chahpiri has now covered his misappropriation of the consignment of Government cloth recently issued to him for distriou- tion in Tangistan by handing in to the^Persian authorities the appropriate number of receipts purporting to show that the villagers from whom he obtained them had each been issued with the regulation 3 metres of cloth. The very considerable profits which he made from the illicit sale of the cloth to the Qpshqais doubtless made this laborious deception worthwhile. (c) Ghulam nii Chahpiri ( nephew of Ali Chahpiri), who is resnonsible for the security 0 f Ali Chang*.- the area on which the Bushire water scheme depends for its supply of water- is reported to be taking commission from the Irrigation Department at the following rates;- Rls. 10 per coolie; His. 15 per &gt; Rls. 50 per supervisor. He is also said to charge for double the number of camels he actually supplies on contract to the above Department at Ali Changi. (d) A caravan of 10 donkeys carrying grain belonging to Hussein Namju was recently held up at Ahram by Ali Chahpiri. This incident was obviously in retaliation for a similar hold-up on ascomnitted a short time ago by the former^caravan belonging to the latter. Further incidents of this type may be expected; there is no love lost between these two chiefs. VI. P UBLIC RELATIONS . / in (a) A general disappointment at the slow rate of progress: in Normandy has been noticeable. As one individual put it, ' He * expected the attack to go like electricity ( Hamla-i-barq asa) M -this despite all the world and local warnings to the contrary that have been given. People are, however, beginning to resign themselves to the fact that the conclusion of the war in Europe is further off than they had expected. (b) Considerable prominence has been given on the Berlin radio to German ' secret weapons 11 . The probable effects of these have aroused some speculation, but it has been seen .that the flying bomb has not done all that was claimed for it and the local opinion is that the others will probably have little better results. (c) English classes for Persians are to be opened in Bushire during the coming week in response to a not inconsiderable demand for them. Further details will be given in the next oummary. (d) Two new projector lamps were received for the cinema van on July 4th. by'air from Tehran and it was possible to start shows of the long-awaited new consignment of films ( see para. VI of last Summary). As many shows as possible .’ere packed into the period which remained before the van was .sent up to Shiraz on July 14th. The feature film ’’Captain of the Clouds', which was shown three times in different places, was very popular, though the first show of it was partially spoiled by the bad condition in which the film was received. (e) The new timing of the Persian broadcast from Delhi : which came into effect from July 1st., is unf ortuna’te. Coming as it does between 8-15 o.n. and 9 p.m. , it clashes with the Tehran broad cast of lessons and of Petsun lusic is,, a a u ml’hardly listened to by anybody. As these are two o-l the^tnree mos important stations to broadcast Persian programmes, it is a great pity that they should be so arranged that they virtually cancel each other out. It is much to be hoped that this will be rectified. 7 ;;. f oodstuffs . Reference Paragraph VII (b) of the last Summary. ’ Shipments of wheat continue to arrive from Liravi. A total of over 225 tons has actually reached Bushir and further quantities have been shipped. VIII. COMHEkCIAL AND SHIPPING . 760 packages were cleared from the Customs during the fortnight. They consisted of 300 cases of empty bottles, 114 bales of piece-goods, 80 bundles of rope, 116 bags of sugar, 50 bags of wild almonds, 10 cases of whisky and beer, 5 radio-sets and 85 packages of sundries. The market remained inactive during the fortnight. Most of the merchants who hold stocks of goods are financially ©f&amp;a*rassed and possibility of the return of business to its nor mal condition seems to them to be remote. Inland Transport . 48 lorries arrived from the interior bringing 92 tons of barley, gum, soap and rugs. -The same number left for Shiraz with 153 tons of sugar, tea, piece-goods and turmeric.

(a) Reference paragraph II (d) of Intelligence Summary No. 10 Shaikh Abdullah Burazjani ( Alias Bashti) was telegraphically .ordered to return to Shiraz. The state of his car provided suffi cient excuse for him to delay his return for some days. He eventu ally got as far as Borazjan but fever unfortunately prevented him from proceeding further. (b) Reference ^aragra^h II (a) of Intelligence Summary No. 9. a correspondent^ from Isfahan writes expressing his surprise at the existence in Bushire of an ,, Adalat‘ , Partj . He notes that the party of that name once existed in Tehran, with Russian support, but enjoyed a short life. Its leader was a Communist and editor of the newspaper ^ Pazadga'. See article published in Khurshid-i-iran No. 98 of•5th March 1923. • (c) The E.B.R. Department at Bushire on a recent occasion discovered some personal baggage loaded illegally on one of its lorries. The lorry was detained pending enquiries. The baggage in question was found to belong to an employee of the Finance Department by name of Abbas Khorram. After a reference had been made to Shiraz* it was returned to the owner who is now industriously engaged in forwarding to Shiraz and Tehran a string of anonymous complaints against the local manager of the E.B.R. (d) It is reported that the mail-lorry, while on its way from Bus-hire to Shiraz on the 14th June, was attacked by bandits on the Filfili Pass not far from Fonar Takhteh. The mail, together with 8 bales of Government piece-goods and other miscellaneous merchandise, was carried off. It is said that the culprits were two * deserters from the Gendarmerie who have collected a gang with the object of committing disturbances on the road. (e) The Bushire Ice and Electric Company commenced manufacturing ice from the 16th June, 1944. The wholesale price is Rials 2 per kilo and shopkeepers are allowed to sell retail at Rials 3.00 pen kilo. The latter rate was, however, reduced to Rials 2.50 per kilo by order of the Governor. (f) Dr. aIsv, the Assistant Director of the Health Department at Bushire, recently proceeded on tour to Dashti with some medicines for distribution. Complaints have been received by the Governor to the effect that no free distribution took place and that the medicines were sold at high rates. The matter has been under investigation. (g) barhang Tebatabai, accompanied by a small party of fViSian OtV» ct ^ arrueri at Bushbrc to carry out. u £ r T,h Juuo . . carried out a tour of in&amp;pcction of the Dashti area, returning to Bushire on 22nd June.

The consignment is said to have been confiscated and the dhow, vri.th its crew, to have since been released. III. COMMUNICATIONS. It was announced bp the local agent of Iran-Tour on the 23th June j;hat an air service was being opened on the Tehran- Isfahan -Shiraz-Bushire line and that the first plane would land at Bushire on julp 1st. Rates to be charged for Air Mail have not yet been announced. la&amp;senger rates v/ere published as follows Bush ire-Shiraz Rials 2000 Bushire Isfahan rt 4500 Bu&amp;hire-Tehran rt 5000 IY. PUBLIC HEALTH . Malaria has been on the increase and has been of a more severe type. Influenza and pneumonia have almost disappeared. One or two cases of broncho-pneumonia have occurred among children suffering from whooping-cough. v * TRIBAL &amp; POLITICAL . (a) The military garrison at Bushire has been pro vided with one Jeep. This is the first vehicle of its own that the garrison has received- has already been made use of by the Officer Commanding troops for several tours to Dashti. i (b) The military party referred to at paragraph II (g) above met all the chiefs of Tangistan and Bashti v/hile on tour in those- areas. It is reported that -Sarhang Tabatabai re-appointed Aii Razmi and Ghulam Razmi as Rais-i-Intizamat for Khurmuj and Balook-i-Da&amp;hti respectively. This was confirmed by Ali Razmi v/hen he came to Bushire recently and paid a visit t&amp; His Majesty’s Vice-Consul. He told the latter that the military authorities had indeed appointed him as Rais-i-Intizamat for Khurmuj but that v/hen nr had sought confirmation from the Governor, the Governor had expressed his ignorance of any authority for the appointment and had simply informed him that the matter v/ould require a reference to Tehran. (c) Further reports of Ali Chahpiri’s malpractices in Tangietan have been received during the fortnight under report. It appears to be indisputably true that he has sold to the tyashqais ( at a handsome profit to himself) by far the greater part of the consignment of 2000 yards of cheap Government cloth Tecently issued to him by the Persian authorities for distribution at controlled rate*s in Tangistan. His further misdemeanours have included the exaction of levies of v/heat in respect of the recent crop, from cultivators of the area, thou^ri he had no reason to be unaware of the fact that the crop was virtually a total failure. In lieu of wheat he has accepted Rials 6 for each kilo of the amount demanded. (d) Ali Razmi of Khurmuj reports that Ali Ismail is now in the neighbourhood of Abdan negotiating terms for coming in. The military Governor of Khurmuj has been holding discussions with him and it is said that these have formed the object of the frequent visits to Dashti of the Bushire Officer Commanding troops ( see paragraph V (a) of this Summary). The results of the negotiations aiC not Known.There is little change to report - i:icc the issue of thclast suraraary. The Allied offensives in the West continue to claim attention and are followed with considerable -interests both on the radio and the daily news-sheet, the distribution of which has been expanded since the landings in Kormandy took place. little diminution has been noticeable in the general optimism as to the ^speedy conclusion of the war, though the public relations staff are losing no opportunity of counteracting undue wishful thinking on t-is subject. The new offensives, with the conclusions, both logical and illogical, v/hich are drawn from them by the local public, some what naturally tend to crov^d out news and discussions about the v/ar in the Far East, the importance of v/hich to the v/orld in general and himself in particular the local Persian refuses-presumabJy in common with the majority of his countrymen- to recognise. It is much- to be hoped that publicity material will contain an increasing number of articles on this subject,^ future issues. Only 8 cinema shows were given during the fort night under review. This comparative paucity of shows was due to the fact that for most of the fortnight only old films, which had been exhibited many times, v/ere available and that, when a new/ con signment was received tov/ards the end of the fortnight, the projector lamp fused. Two lamps in replacement have since been received by air from Tehran. The exhibition « bui^d up •« on the subject of Indian culture has been received from the Public Relations Bureau, Tehran. This should be popular. It is intended to exhibit it in the Reading Room for one week. VII. FOODSTUFF'S . (a) During the period under review lieutenant. Lemon of the Jereal and Bread Department, Shiraz, visited Bushire, f ran '/here he carried out a tour of the Dashti area* (b) Reference paragraph V (a) of Summary llo. n Aqai Fathullah Khan Hiat Daudi, accompanied by Sargurd Mu^arrab, returned to Bush ire on 24 th June. The former appears to have been most successful in nosing out caches of wheat and transporting them down to . thv. coast in the tv/o lorries with vihich he has been provided by the Cereals and Bread Department. Some further consignments have been received by sea at Bushire, but continuous strong winds have interi ... cd in regular shipments from Dilara, where the harbour is very exposed. Fath/ullah Khan is hopeful of being able to ship about 500 tons in all from Liravi. (c) A consignment of sugar .and tea recently taken delivery of by Shaikh Abdullah Burazjani at Bushire ( see paragraph II (d) of Summary Ho. 10) and dispatched to Shiraz turned out on arrival at Shiraz to have been extensively tampered with. 240 cases of tea were* found, on being opened, to contain waste paper. Shaikh Abdullah proceeded to Bushire to examine the balance of his consignment there in stock. He is reported to have failed up to the present to discover how and where the exchange took place. VIII. COMMERCIAL &amp; SHIFPIH O. 3,633 packages were cleared from the CuetomB during the fortnight. They consisted of 2,778 bags of sugar, 332 bales of cotton piece-goods, 100 bags of coffee, 76 bags of dried lemons, 50 tins of ghee, 50 bundles of Hessian cloth, 45 bundles of rope, 40 bundles of coir matting, 57 bags of turmeric and 125 packages of sundries. . 2.

There have been no epidemics or infectious diseases, but malaria continues to be fairly widespread. A number of cases of whooping cough havS been reported and septic throat trouble is prevalent. V. TRI BAL AND POLIT ICAL. Wal The military column which was despatch ed to Liravi ( see oara V (c) of last summary) to assist Aqai Fathullah I Gian, Hiat Daudi, in the collection of surplus wheat, has now been withdrawn. The company' of infantry involved occup ied Hisar in the face of slight resistance^ but the troops failed to capture Mohd Ali Khan, Liravi, who fled to Zaidun. This action successfully put an end to all resistance in Liravi, and Aoai Fathullah Khan is now engaged in despatching consignments of wheat found hoarded in Hisar and Dilam, to Bushire: 50 tons of wheat have already been sent by dhow and it is understood that further large quantities will shortly follow. The success of thi small operation is most gratifying, and much credit is due to Fathullah Khan, the Rais-i-Intizamat of Hiat Daud, who has been doing his utmost, for months past, to obtain grain for delivery to the Bushire Kharbar, ( He is the only individual who has produced satisfactory results in the collection of surplus whsst cereals from the 1322 crop )2 “Tne $yn'jq*h?* t S la.')c ' It**/* Gun - YVl*h€Y frc • (b) Reports continue to be received of the ill treatment of Tangistanis by Ali Chahpiri of Ahram, and he is now apparent ly engaged in exacting M revenue' at the rate of Rials 50,frorn all men' in his area. Both Ali Chahpiri and Chulam Razmi ^&gt;P Dash- ti, are making attempts to purchase more ammunition, but they are not yet showing any open hostility to the Persian military detatchments stationed at Ahram and Khormuj. (c) A caravan was recently plundered by robbers six miles from Khormuj. (d) Captain Namwar, O.C. troops Bushire informed K.M's Consul that Ali Ismail, the D a shti outlaw, wishes to make his peace with the Persian Government, and that he may be offered terms which will include the surrender of all his arms and his removal from Dashti. VI. PUBLIC RELATIONS . r (a) Senior Persian officials were invited to an ' At Home ' by the Hon’ble the Political Resident, to meet the G.O.C. in C., Paiforce. (b) Bushiris showed considerable enthusiasm on hearing the news of the fall of Rome and the opening of the second front, and in spite of repeated warnings against over optimism, there is a widespread belief that the war in Europe will be over in a few months time. The good news was celebrated in the Anglo-Persian Club and Reading Room at a function on the evening of the Gth June, and loud speaker announcements were made from the cinema van in the town and neighbouring villages. The maps, posters and other material on the subject of .the 'Liberation of Europe ', supplied by the P.R.B. Tehran, are being used to good effect and have aroused widespread interest. (c) No new films have been received in Bus- hire since the 13th April and the activities of the cinema ^ van i have been considerably curtailed as a result. It is unfortun ate that films cannot be supplied more regularly, as the cinema van is extremely popular in these parts, and the publicity value derived from this' source has always been considerable. (d) The 3.3.C. Persian broadcast has become increasingly popular since the opening of the second front, and the audibility of these programmes has recently improved. (e) The new publications ' -Learn English by Radio' and the magazine ' Ahang ', are proving to be most popular blit the average Persian in Bushire considers that the prices asked are too high. 'VII. FOODSTUFF S. Ta) Orders have been received by the Bushire Cereals and Bread Department, confirming that all Government issues of cereals for consumption in the Persian Gulf, are to consist of 80,3 barley and 20/o wheat, until further notice. (b) Two Russians, Leonid Yartsevas and Karl Oschin, who visited Bushire in December last with a view to opening a fish oil factory, arrived here on the 11th June. They are engaged in preliminary enquiries, prior to the floating of a company, which, it is understood, will be financed by:- Aqai Abdul Husain Dehqan of Shiraz, . Aqai Pizishki of Shiraz, Aqai Khazrai o,f Tehran, and Aqai Katnalzadeh of Tehran. Karl Oschin is the technical engineer who will be in charge of the factory, and Leonid Yartsevas is attempting to purchase locally the equipment which is required for the plant. It is too early to comment on the chances of success of this scheme. £, - 3 - VIII. SHIPPING AND C0ia.:ERC5 . (a) 880 packages were cleared fron the Customs durinp the fortnifht.

They encountered some difficulties and have proceeded to Isfahan to make a report. (ii) A party of Russians travelling in 5 militar^ vehicles, arrived at Bushire on the 28th May, without an;, ^revious warning. Two of the party Mr. Sagoff (?) and Mr. Sanginoff (?) both from the Russian Consulate at Isfaha*., ^ called on H«M.’s Consul and stated that the object of their visit was to stage a publicity display in the tovm (see para. Y below), and that one of thedr number had orders to inspect a consignment of opium; held by the finance Department. The individual interested in the opium was a Hr. julioff (?) (said to be a Russian trade representative from Tehran) and his negotiations with the Finance Department were apparently successful, as he and his party (which included a Russian military escort with 3 officers) eventually left with 1C3 cases of raw opium, each weighing 150 lbs. During their visit, these Russians, who stayed at the old if.S.S.R. Consulate, made some enquiries about general trade conditions in Buahire. (c) Persian officials.

Gendarmerie, who had proceeded to Hisar and Dilam in an attempt to settle the Hiat Daud-Liravi dispute (vide para. V (a) of last summary), it was decided that a mili tary column must be sent to obtain the wheat due to Government from Mohd. Ali Khan. While in Liravi the O.G* Gendarmerie found considerable ptores of hoarded grain at Dilam and it was discovered that consignments of wheat were . being exported by sea from Hi&amp;ar. A force consisting of one company (l80 strong, with 2 mortars) from Shiraz,and 120 Tufangchis, assembled at Borazjun on the evening of the 30th May and proceeded in lorries to Shul, via Sanawah, the next day. The first objective of the column is Hiear where th^ intend to surround Mohd Ali Khan and his follow ers, and after taking possession of Hi&amp;ar fort, steps be taken to confiscate hoarded wheat which will be despatch ed to Bushire. &lt; r 7 . PUBLIC RELATIONS . (a) The good progress of the Allied offensive in Italy he.' been the subject of favourable comment among educated cL’sees, but public interest continues to be centred on the ossibilities of the opening of the second front. (b^ The Russian party mentioned in para. 1 above, gave a display of publicity posters and photographs in the Bushire Persian Club on the 29th May. The show was patronised by several Persian officials and a fairly large number from^ the town, but none were particularly interested in the dis play of material, which was calculated t'o draw attention to culture 'in the U.S.S.R., and the military might of the Red Array. Among the war photographs shown there were a select ion of prints showing dead bodies and mutilated children, ail labelled as instances of Nazi atrocities. Many Per sians were heard to remark that this type of show (apart from the atrocity photograph&amp;l) could be seen at any time in the &gt;'' p o-Persian Reading Room, and crowds v/hich had j.Hooted expecting a good entertainment, eventually dis persed with the only satisfaction of having received a free cup of tea. The Russians are not particularly popular among Buahiris, and this piece o^ propaganda did nothing to alter their opinion of the Soviet. (c) The British Consular Agent at Lingah reports that the new building for the Club and Reading Room in Lingah town, has been occupied. (A) No new films have been received during the fort night, but the cinema van has given a number of successful nr mane es consisting of a selection of 'shorts 11 . (e) There has been a noticeable deterioration in the audibility of the B.B.C. Persian broadcast, on the 31 metre banc 1 :r. particular. Interference is being experienced on the 24 metre band. VII.

LOCAL ALPaIRS. (a) The Adalat and Azadegan Poli^ !last mentioned in paragraph XI(t) of summary No.8 have both been active since the arrival of Aqai Safavi A ^- Daahty s and it is clear that the former party has cnj ont main obiect&gt; and that is to work against the interest's Or the two members in the Majlis. Both parties are announcing. ‘ they aim to help the public of Buahire, but neither has yet advanced beyond the stage of verbal propaganda, an occasional telegram to the Capital and the publish s o’ ai t - cle s in the local Press. The Adalat party is un doubtedly the tool of Shaikh Ali Dashti, originally a Bushiri. who is now a deputy in the Majlis for Tehran. (bl Dr. Farzaneh of the irrigation Department states that work on the Ali Changi drinking water scheme (see paragraph Il(e) of Diary No. 8) is held up owing to the non arrival of 25 tons of tar, which are on order from Ai &gt; to coat the clay piping across the llashileh. The local authorities have been making numerous enquiries . time past, with regard to iron piping which is also requir- d and it is expected an official request for assistance will soon be made to this Consulate-General. local comm ittees are now busilp engaged in drawing up plans to aeai with the drinking water shortage, including a proposal to transport' water tc the So’»n in tankers, (vide paragraph 11 (£ ) oi' &amp; iary ro . 8 of 1944 ) .

II. LOCAL AFFAIRS. from (&amp;) The Fharbar Department recently received orders Tenran permitting them to proceed with the sale of cloth to the public at the scale of 3 metres per ration ticket holder. The news soon spread round the town, and those who had not already done so hastily registered their ov/n ration tickets in addition to any others they oould lay their hands on. All waited expectantly for the opening of the one Government cloth distribution shop in which two assistants were apparently preparing themselves to deal with a situation which would clearly be similar to a summer sale at a London store. This Government cloth shop has been open for the past nine months but if anyone ventured inside, the assistant in charge would point to a notice hung up by the door which informed the public briefly 'Tatil 1 ', and explained that no cloth could be sold for the year 1322 as orders had not been received from the Capital. on March 6 th the sales were started, prices averaging Rials 60/- a metre for silk and Rials 12/- for ootton, and when one considers that the open market rates for cloth are still in the neighbourhood of Rials 250/- for silk and Rials 45/- for cotton per metre, in addition to the fact that no Government cloth ration has been issued to the public for the past year, it is not surprising tha.t enormous crowds collected to purchase the Government material. It was soon found that no special arrangements had been nade to deal with the situation and chaos reigned* Certain officials in the Kharbar Department however, were quick off the mark and made large purchases in the names of various people in the town, including apparently the recently deceased. They are nov/ believed to hold large stocks in their houses for more convenient dispose- 1 . If some unfortunate customer in the crowd did eventually, by a miracle, reach the counter and secure attention he was invariably told that the cloth of his choice was eax*- marked for a Government official, or if he received his 3 + ration, he then saw several more metres hewing cut off the same roll and stowed behind the scenes, '‘for officers of Government Departments 1 ', as the attendant would explain. / • INDIA OFF1C&amp; In the case of the more attractive rolls they would be informed that the piece had been received a metre short from Tehran RE§9. KL 2 ) APR /and could not U sold until the di&amp;cre.anc&gt; had been clearer u , ^t the end of each day hundreds of disappointed customer 1 wou^.d 'oe turned awa^,, some unfortunates having been waiting since dawn. The chaos still continues more or less unabated. (b) It has be^n rumoured in the town that the conscription law is to be abolished. This story soon obtained wide circulation and credence s and a number of local villagers have been refusing to report to the recruiting office for service. (c) There have recently been a number of cases of burglary in the town end one cloth shop has lost goods worth 3000 Tomans, another shop e,t Sangi ^ Iso being burgled. Armed robbers, said t o be followers of Ali Chapiri, Tangistani, have held up and looted some individuals in the suburbs of Bu shire. (d) The local branch of the Adalat party last mentioned in paragraph II (b) of last summary, have sent a telegraphic complaint to Tehran in connection with the percentage of millet and barley which is mixed with the wheat issued to the bakers in the town, and also protested against the supply of cereals to the Gulf Porte from Bushii^-. (e) Shaikh Ali Dashti's local supporters, the brothers Mahmud and Ahmad Burazjani and Abdullah Faramarzi, have addressed a petition to the Shah, the Majlis and the ^ prime Minister stating that the Bush ire Deputies in the Majlis, Aqai Khalil Dashti and A^ai Safavi, secured their election by illegal means and a demand for an enquiry has been made. (f) There is a rumour in the town that the Shah wil' be visiting pars very shortly. III. COMMUNICATIONS . (a) The following is a short resume of the mot or able track from Ahmadi, on the main Shiraz road 24 mile s from Bush ire, to Ganawah. (observations made on March 8 th - Maps 10 K and 0 )• (i) The track is only passable for motor vehicles in dry weather and in many places north of the Hud Hillch patches of deep mud were encountered in spite of the fact that there had been no rain for approximately two months. There are two main §b 8 taclcs, the Rud Hilleh which is crossed by a ferry at Haft Tush, and the Rud-i-Shiir, further to the north west, vfoich is crossed by a ford approximately 2 miles south cast of the village of $edu. (ii) After leaving A&amp;madi (0 Hi?!) the track, the surface of which is good, pa§*cs the Ullages of Hussainaki (li miles) Nukal-i- Oazi (7£ ^iles) and K&amp;l K&amp;s&amp;an (12 miles) before reaching Haft Jush (f5 f|lcs} wkere there is a ferry consisting of two bell urns roped togethep with planks laid across to take a car. At first-sight, the ferry appears a somewhat primitive affair b|t in practice it proved to be remarkably efficient. Apprtaghes to the ferry on both sides of the river are v^ry steep, and soft san£ and mud on the north ern bank was found particularly treachergue. (iii) Once the river is crossed, the track turns west through Dashti (17 miles) in the neighbourhood of which some difficulty may be encountered in crossing irrigation channels, and then continues in the same direction through Cham tan gr.n (Pit miles) Mukabari (23£ miles) and M&amp;jnun (26 miles) where it 2 / turns- 3 - turns north west across an open plain.

After passing Samanda^ 41 miles) Indruhak-i-Kuchak (43 milesl the track passes approximately “e mile to the East of Bandar Rig (45 miles) and leads straight on to the A.P.C.C. landing ground at G&amp;nawah where joins (54 miles) the main Ganawah-Gech Saran road, about 1*|: miles from the coast line • note l note 2. not many vehicles use this track and a gre^.t deal of time can be saved if a. guide is taken.

Professor Y/insor 1 s visit was for the dual purpose of initiating the drinking water scheme for Bushire, and starting a very desirable overhaul of the Shabankareh irrigation project. A committee meeting was held at the Governorate, when staff were appointed for the commendement of the drinking water scheme, and the general plan of operations decided upon. (b) Five hundred mangrove seedlings, presented by the Government of Zanzibar, arrived and were delivered to the Governor for experimental sowing in Bushire. III. COMMUNICA TIONS. The Bushire-Tehran landline (which is Tehran’s only^’FIL”^ link with London and Delhi) is still under a heavy strain, owing to the Persian Government’s failure to provide adequate staff and to maintain the condition of the line. IV. PUBLIC HEALTH . (a) The sanatorium at Shekeri for sufferers from tropical ulcers very nearly had to close down during the period under report, as the sums promised by local merchants were not in fact subscribed. The Anglo-Persian Relief Fund came to the rescue, and has now undertaken responsibility for the food of the patients, the Health Department providing equipment and service. (b) There were no epidemics in Bushire during the fortnight. V. TRIBA L AND POLITICAL . The situation has remained superficially quiet during the period under report, but there have been indications of a ra- proachement between the Dashti and Tangistan chiefs 5 and during H.M.Consul’s visit to Dayyir., he found two Qashqai emissaries- 2 - with All Isnail (the chief against whon Captain Isfandiari led the ill-dated disarnament expedition last year). VI. PUB LIC REL ATIONS. Nothing to report. (a) The Supply Department have be^un a census of the town for issue of new coupons for sugar, tea and cloth. No scheme for rationed bread has yet been initiated for Bushire, and the present daily issue to bakers is totally inadequate. (b) At the end of the period, the area had still received no lorries for the purpose of wheat collection. (c) Owing to Ali Ismail’s attitude (see also paragraph V) realization of the contract 1 'for Southern Dashti is most unlikely.. It is nqssible, however, t at military operations may once again be initiated to deal with this situation. VIII. SPI TTING AND COH^RCS . (a) Gener al si tuation. * Clearances from the Customs were &gt; confined to goods which arrived before the Hillspaugh regulation. Merchants experienced difficulty in forwarding merchandise up country owing to the lack of transport. Lorries arriving for the Road Transport Department were utilized only for forwarding monopoly goods. One omnibus which brought some passengers from Shiraz - began to load free merchandise, but was promptly seized by the Road Transport Department. Renewed complaints by the local merchants were sent to 1 Tehran and resulted in the transfer of the manager of the Road Transport Department. (b) Cos t ofxiix g li ving . Addendum to paragraph III.

The latter, however, Aqai Qadimi, stated, as a result of pressure from influential persons connected with the tribes, released the three bandits, and he wasthreatened that he would sugfer if he pursued the case.

(a) The local recruiting officer has been having some difficulty with Rais Ali Chahpiri, the chief khan of the Tangistan area, who has instructed all village headmen under his infituence to refuse to give up any recruits (who would, he has informed them, be sent to fight against Germany) on the pretext that all able-bodied men have gone to work at Abadan. Meanwhile, Rais Ali has been collecting a sum of thirty tomans from each^village, saying that he is paying the money to the recriiiting officer, (it is, of course, correct that the reserves of working men in this area have been seriously depleted by the attractions of the high wages paid at Basra, Idiorramshahr and Abadan by military and other formations; and any further reduction of the number of able-bodied agriculturists m ^y reach the point where the drop in next year’s harvest will be noticeable). • (h) The post of Officer Commanding Gendarmerie at Lingah has been changing hands with the rapidity ol a shuttlecock, each transfer causing no actual personal loss to the Officer Commanding Gendarmerie,^Lar. Lieutenant Mulki (who had been heard to say that it had cost him 3000 tomans to get the post) was relieved by Lieutenant Pashai. The hand-over was, however, still incComplete BESS, f iL. $ 1 ?T. / when IND r r ICEc‘ - 2 - v/hen Lieutenant Majhubi arrived from Lar to take charge; but he had only held the post for four days when his own successor, Lieutenant Buzurg Mihr, arrived, III. COieiUNICATIONS . No change.' IV. PUBLIC HEALTH . (a) A meeting composed of the Governor, His Majesty’s Consul, the Public Health Officer and the Mayor of Bushire was held on the 15th November, when steps for the prevention of typhus and typhoid epidemics were discussed. Application for the necessary funds has been made to the Anglo-Persian Relief and Reconstruction Fund. (b) One case of small-pox (imported) occurred during the period under report. V. TRIBAL &amp; POLITICAL. (a) Reference paragraph I (c)(i): General Jehanbani called on the Hon’ble the Political Resident on 3rd November and discudsed the tribal situation in Fars. He expressed the opinion that in two months’ time the army would be able to sweep away 'all trouble'; in fact the only difficulty up to now had been lack^of material, and the fact that Persia was not her own mistress.. He did not offer any explanation why this invincible force did not, six weeks ago, ejec a nest of highway robbers barely 30 miles from Shiraz until they were pressed to do^so. He showed, however, a praisworthy alacrity in framing plans for the solution of Dashti and Tangistan problems, and it is hoped that he will show equal zeal in ensuring their complete fulfilment. (b) The first step 6 n the execution of these plans was taken on November 10th, when H.M.S.Seabelle called at Bushire and took on board a detachment of Persian troops, with supporting infantry weapons, under Colonel Dad Sitan (see paragraph I (c)(ii)).. Shortly before dawn on the follov/img'morning, they were disembarked by the ship’s boats a few kilometres to the west of Dayyir, which was believed to be occupied by Ali Ismail (a noted rebel and supporter of the Qashqai, previous efforts of the Persian Army to scotch whom have been recorded in these summaries^. The town was successfully surrounded and the fort captured with very little firing. H.M.S.Seabelle herself did not open fire. Unfortunately, it was discovered that the Persian •staff (a leading member of which has previously benefited financially from the disorders of Dasht&amp; and Tangistan, vide paragraph V (i) of my summary for 15th to 31st August v h 1942) had' been unable to keep the operations secret, and Ali Ismail was 'not at home'. It is hoped shortly to '• establish definitely the responsibility for this leakage. (c) This force, after landing its reserves of food and ammunition, established itself at Dayyir, while a second coihumn, based on Bushire, has advanced southward into Tangistan and Dashti, where it is hoped that they will aucceed in arresting some of the other khans who have for so long disturbed the peace of that area and abetted the tribal troubles of the interior. / V. (d)- 3 - (d) The rapprochement between local leaders noted my last summary has clarified itself in ©ashti as an oath of mutual support between Rais Ghulam Razmi and his brother Rais Mohammed Ali Razmi, with their cousin Rais Ali Razmi, who is normally opposed to them. ' There are also some indications that;, in. Tang is tan both Taimur Jamali and Ja r far Ambaraki, normally bitter foes of Rais Ali Chahpiri, have made their peace with him, temporarily at any rate. The : suspicion noted in my last summary that this unification of Dashti/iangistan is due to the intrigues of Qashqai emissaries (who visited Ali Ismail at Dayyir) has been strengthened by the de tection of another Qashqai in Ali •Chahpiri!* s fort-at Ahram. : VI. PUBLIC RELATIONS . ‘ , • - ’ y -! ,i ’ . (a) The non-informative tone of the official statement about the Moscow conference caused disappointment and specula tion about the number of.Secret clauses', particularly those believed to affect Persia-and, to a lesser degree Poland. (b) A new reading room has been leased at Borazjan, and improvements carried out to the Bushire reading room Another reading room fs to be opened at Lingah /which have proved popular (c) Berlin continues to have secret listeners, but the •German news is never discussed in public Delhi radio has improved its audibility 0 but its news service has been losing listeners through coinciding with the home news from Tehran. The American broadcasts from Tehran are much better in point of audibility than 'The Voice of England'. (d) Fresh types of publicity material received during the fortnight/were°- (a) Hau Nehalan (children’s paper) (b) the 'Empire' number of the Bugle and (c) coloured portraits, against a background of the national flag, of the four chief Allied leaders.

II• LOCAL AF FAIR3 . Reference paragraph 1(b)(i) of my summary xor ICtn October. The Officer Commanding Bushire garrison, Sargurd Buzurg Ummid, telegraphed to Shiraz complaining of the Bushire climate and re cuesting permission to return charge of tne office to Bargurd Nuri. This was refused, and euri was o &gt; li&lt;?ed to leave for Shiraz.. His departure is of definite _ value * in the interests of clearing up tribal affairs in wnich he has frequently interfered, invariably to his own and trie Khans‘ profit, and to the detriment of the Persian Government. III. 2 QliHJ]iICATI 0 NS. (a) Wi feles s. Telegraphic, wireless and radio communication with Tehran was cut off‘from 28th November. Of the various rumour, spread in the town, that of a coup d'etat was the most popular, unt-1 Ankara radio stated that the conference of Allied leaders was being held there. (b) Air. A Boston Plane of the American Air Force, which_ was being ferried from Cairo to Abadan, overshot its objective and crashed near Asalu (150 miles south of Bushire). The pilot was killed, but the navigator escaped by parachute. Receiving assistance and hospitality from all the shaikhs of the Banadir-i-Galas area, whose relations with us have now for some time been very friendly, he made his way to Dayyir, where^ the disarmament column recently landed there bp H.M.b. bLABELLH radioed to Ghiraz for a Persian Army aeroplane. In this he arrived safely at Bushire. (It is remarkable that, after overflying its objective bv some 300 miles, the plane should have crashed within a few miles of an emergency landing ground (One was constructed at Asalu in the course of last summer). It appears that the pilot had no maps of the area^south of Abadan, and relied on the directional beam to get him in). T. I / IV *2 ✓'N y ( IV. PUBLIC HEALTH . (a) The lateness of rainfall has caused an increase in the incidence of malaria f? (b) The Quarantine Medical Officer has received sanction to rebuild and improve the sea quarantine station on Abpasa^ Island; and the Residency's Executive Engineer has visited the site with him and drawn up plans. \ V. TRIBAL AND POLITICAL . (a) Hostilities have begun between Rais Ghulam Razmi and Husain Quli of Tang-Iram. The former attacked Dehrud and killed the latter's brother. Husain Quli appealed to Nasir Qashqai for help, and a number of tufangchis were sent^ These attacked Ghulam Razmi, killing one of his men; and recaptured Dehrud. Rais Ali Chahpiri of . paring to go to Razmi's.assistance, when the military disarm ament'column reached Ahram, and he had to give up the idea. (b) The force which landed at Dayyir (see paragraph^ V(B.) of my last summary) started towards Kaki where they joined forces with the column which marched on Kaki via D^shti. it Is reported that Ali Ismail has been severely wounded, and has taken ?efuge in the foothills. Whether his injuries were incurred in action, or (as one report states) by an accident, is not yet certain. It is reported that the Officer Commanding the column summoned Ali Chahpiri to come to his camp; but he refused and is at present eoing into the hills near Ahram during the day time and returning'to Ahram by night. says that Sarhang Dad Sitan has arrested Chahpiri s oon u s hostage until his father reports himself. The disarmament column has recently received reinforce- ments. (c) Lt. Qaraguzlu of the Gendarmerie left for Lavar on November 23rd to sutiiy study the question of re-opening the gendarmerie garrison at that port. VI. PUBLIC RELATIONS . A reading room, to be run on the lines of a club, as is the Bushire reading room, has been opened at Borazjan. . nightly a ttendance at the Bushire reading room has increased. No fresh printed publicity material was received during the period under report. The cinema van has returned from Shiraz. VII. FOODSTUFFS . (a) The Director of the Foodstuffs, Department has telegraphed to Tehran to ask that Bushire town should be put on the same scale of cereals issue as Tehran. The daily issue given up to now averages out at less than 250 grammes (+ lb ) per day per head of population. (b) Aqai Akabarian, contractor for wheat in southern Dashti, has returned from Shiraz. It^is possible that, i he receives support from Colonel Dad Sitan T s column, ne may, even at this eleventh hour, succeed in collecting the surplus of that area* •VIII. SHIPPING AND COMMERCE , (a) General Situation * Business is still slackening owing to lack of / shipping3 shiDDine: and therefore o'f imports.• Clearances from the Cus- toms are almost negligible. Owing to the J^itimate business, merchants are turning more and more to speculation. Even the goods which have been imported^cannot be lorwarded as the Road Transport Department has failed to send lorries, except for cotton. (b) Cost of Living ..

The status of the Consular Agent, Lingah, has at last been recognized by th Persian Government: and he has therefore initiated full control of the wireless station, including c nsor- ship of telegrams and the refusal of code messages except those signed by, or addressed to, a local head of a Persian Govern ment department. IV. PUBLIC HEAL TH. No change. Y. TRIBAL at ,!. POLITICAL . (a) The P; rsian Army force which is operating in Dashti under the command of Colonel Dad Sitan (see paragraph V(b) of my last summary) subsequently advanced to Sarmastan, but it is now rumoured th't they are preparing to withdraw. There fias been some fighting between the column and followers of Ali Ismail, and the latter are reported to have suffered 15 casual ties. Ali Ismail is, however, still at large, and it has now been confirmed that the injuries which he sustained were the result of an accident, and do not appear-to be serious. The officer coinmanding the column summoned Rais Ali Razmi of Khormuj and Rais Ghulam Razmi of Buluk-i-Dashti to report to him, but both of them refused to do so. Rais Ali Chahpiri of Tangistan is still in the neighbourhood of Ahram but is keeping clear of the Persian Army force, who have, however got his son with them. Those of the more influential locals who are helping as guides with the column are apparently not at all anxious to pass on more than the minimum amount of their knowledge regarding the hiding places or probable movements of the disaffected leaders, as they are convinced that the Persian army will withdraw without fulfilling their mission, find fear of reprisals from individuals such as Ali Ismail is2 fcheir main concern. It also appears from one report that an attempt to round-np Ali Ismail miscarried through the column placing reliance in a relative of Khalu Hussain (who is the father-in-law of Ali Ismail) to guide the troops on to their objective. Th sum total on the credit side of Colonel Dad Sitan’s operations to date is that he has succeeded in confis cating 100 mule loads of cereals and 50 tons of wheat which are reported to be the property of Ali Ismail, and has effected the arrest of Ghulam Hussain Karami of Sarmastan, a tribal chief who is normally friendly with Ali Ismail. In addition, a Persian aeroplane from Shiraz has bombed Ali Ismail's followers, seven of whom are claimed to have been killed. Little has been heard during the past fortnight of any plans to bring Ali Chahpiri and Ghulam Razmi to heel. VI. PUBLIC RELATIONS . (a) News of the Tehran conference aroused considerable local interest and the text of the announcement regarding Persia was published with favourable comment by the local press. (b) The Public Relations Bureau cinema van arrived in Bushire on the 28th November, since whicl} there have been several performances all of which have been well attended and received. (c) The broadcast messages by certain Persian residents in London to their parents in Persia during the B.B.C. programm., on December 9th, were a very popular feature. (d) A theatrical company has been formed in Bushire, and gave a performance of the play 'Zahhak' on December 15th. This play, which exhibits the evils of dictatorship, met with a favourable reception. (e) Durin' H.M.Consul's tour to Lingah, steps were taken to open a new n. .ding room there. The Deputy Governor and other officials showe ' sonsiderable keenness. Requests for a read ing room were also received in the Banadir-i-Salas area. (f) The latest issue of Jehan-i-Imruz has been more .pop ular than its predecessors, chiefly because the amount of direct 'win-the-war' paganda has been reduced. A report on various pamphlets rec iv d during the period under report is being sent to those concerned. VII. FOODSTUFFS . (a) There has been little change in the quantiti s of cereals delivered by contractors, and Aqai Akabarian (vide para graph VII(b) of last summary) appears to be receiving scant help from Colonel Dad Sitan in collecting the surplus in southern Dashti. (b) Thre j of the leading merchants have agreed after some pressure to form a company to import firewood and charcoal from Mian Kutal, and sell to the Bushire public at a moderate profit. vm. s'hiPx d ing a: t d commerce . (a) There has been no change since the latter half of November and the market remains dull. Orders recently received from the Food Suoply Department in Tehran prohibiting the issue of permits for the transport of tea, sugar and cotton piecegoods by lorry have resulted in a drop in price of these commodities.'

Aqaian Khalil Dashti and Safavi have so far secured most of the votes in the Dashti, Tangistan and ^hahkutah areas and it is not expected that either Shaikh Ali Dashti (ex-member for Demavend^ or Shaikh Abdullah Borazjani (his cor sin) will defeat them. Both Aqaian Framarzi and Shaikh Abdullah have received orders to leave Bushire on pain of suspension from their Government posts. The former left for Borazjan on alleged private business, and the latter left for Tehran via Shiraz on the 26th September 1943, III. COMMUNICATIONS. bn the night of the 18th September 1943, one Falaknaz, the Kadkhuda of Faqih Hasanan and two companions were attacked on their way through Tangistan. All were killed. The murderers are now reported to have gone to Faqih Hasanan and to have occupi ed Falaknaz's property there. 1 V 0 PUBL IC HE ALT H. (a) The port of Bushire has remained free from infectious and contagious disease. Cases of Malaria and Dysentery have been fewer in number during the period under report. Bronchitis and Coryza are on the increase. (b) Reference paragraph IV of my preceding summary. Dr. Siadat is reported to be having difficulty in finding the money for the maintenance of his patients in Shekeri. Merchants who promised to subscribe 2000 tomans towards the expenses have not yet made their contributions. V. TRI BAL AND POLI TICAL . (a) D ashti . A quarrel is reported to have arisen between Rais Ghulam r Razmi of Buluk-i-Dashti and Husain Quli of the same area through the former's demanding a levy of 320 kilos of wheat and a cash payment from the villagers of the Buluk. Before the quarrel couL develop seriously, however, it was patched up by Ghulam Hussain, one of Rais Ali Chahpiri's sons. (b) Tangistan. Hussain Rustom of Dilbar, who was until recently in Bushire, has gone to Ahram and has made a compromise in his quarrel with Rais Ali Chahpiri. The latter has promised to return the village of Dilbar to Husain Rustom. (c) Banadir-i-S'alas . l Sarwar Muqarrab of the Gendarmerie returned from his it of the Southern Gulf ports and has withdrawn, the garrison m Daiyer to Bushire. / VI,2 VI.

(a) Fathullah Khan Hiat Daudi is experiencing difficulty in fulfilling his contract for cereals owing to lack of transport | in the inland area but deliveries are still being made at Bush- ire by sea from the Hiat Baud ports. The total deliveries up to the end of the period under review amount to 598 tons of wheat and 536 tons of barley. Deliveries by other contractors and local purchases by the Supply Department are almost negligible. (b) u n the 28t September 9 1943, the inhabitants of &gt; xv hist (near Borazjan) kidnapped nqai Hisami, the representative of Aqai Hikrnat (Kishmat ul Mamalek), and took him into the hills. They then plundered Hisami's house and ambar. which are understood to have contained a lar..-e stock of cereals, piece- goods, sugar and tea belonging to Aqai Hikmat. VIII. Shi pping and Comrn e r c e. Tehran believed to permit the release of certain goods frozen in the Customs were found unintelligible by the Director of Customs and. 1 •. o to oe referred again to Tehran. As a result merchants are still unable to obtain delivery of their goods. (b) There has been no appreciable change in the prices of commodities during the period. (: ) Business hc.s been very slack.

This arises from a recent raid on the Liravi - Bandar Dilam area by Boir nhmedis, when some 5C0 sheep were carried off. (it is interesting to note the growing suzerainty of Pathullah Khan over Mohammad Ali Khan, thus tacitly admitted by the latter, contrasting with his intransigeant attitude some 18 months ago, shortly after he had seized the fort at Hissar, with its store of hidden arms, from the son® of the late Aqa Khan., (b) While in Shiraz, H.M.Consul took Fahtullah Khan to visit the Finance Department, and ascertain how the position stood regarding the settlement of his claim to the ownership to Kharg Island, which has been a pending case for nearly two years. It was found that no action had been taken for the last four months, and the Director was requested to accelerate disposal of the question, which affects the a.I.O« 0 &lt; : chief sc rce oC Supply c building stone for Abadan. VI. PUB_LIC RSI AT I01TS. (a', A discussion of publicity matters was held in Shiraz with Mr. Plynn, of the Public Relations Bureau, Tehran, by K.M. Consul. It is proposed to make considerable extensions of our publicity activities along the southern Persian coast during this touring season. (b) The Bushire town electric supply has been restored, and radios which had been idle for many months have again come into action. This has led to a certain amount of clandestine listening-in to Berlin, but the tone of public opinion continues firm. The comment that the British kept the power plant out of order to prevent listening-in to Axis radio has, inevitably, been made, but it is doubtful whether many who make the remark have themselves any faith in its truth.(o’) It is felt that sufficient emphasis has b ^n laid on what most Persians feel now to need no proof, viz; that the allied nations will win, and that still fare.-ter str s- might now be laid in our publicity on the superiority of British culture, political organization andaboyenll(with a view to the postwar competition that we shall have to face) British ?»nd Indian commercial products and production. VII. FOODSTUFFS (a) Reference paragraph I ( a ) ( i i i Colonel Ateullah visited the Supply Departmei.t and obtained statistics of the cereals delivered to date by contractors. He appeared to be satisfied with the deliveries made under Hiat Daudi ’ s contract, and asked the Director oi the Supply Department why he had not brought pressure on other contract ors. (A^aian Hikmat, nkabc rian and p a yyi r:L &gt; # The explanation given by Aqai Shamloo was that the first two contractors v/ere responsible to Shiraz and he was there fore unable .to bring any pressure on them. as regards Aqai Dayyiri, he said that he had referred the question to H.a. Consul, as this contractor’s excuse is that the contract given to Aqai Akabarian covers his area, and it was arrevnged in Shiraz that all contracts given in Bush ire for the area, v/eie voided. (b) As it was learnt from colonel Ataullah that the Supply Ministry do not intend to institute the Tehran system of rationed sale of wheat, instea.d of bread, in BUk.hu.xe s consideration has been given to the solution of the matter by local action. After discussion with the Govern or, a scheme his be^n worked -out by His Majesty’s Consul, which aims to permit the sale of a% limited quantity of gr: m {at . the Bushire admixture of 60% wheat and A0% parley t at the supply Department’s fixed Scale rate of 5p rials a kilogram. This would be retailed in a Municipal shop, while correspond ingly reducing the amount issued to the bakers for conversion into bread. If the barley component is reckoned at % the price of wheat (as in this year’s crop purchasing price), the value of the wheat component of a. 60/40 mixture sold at Se rials can be y/orked out by a complicated algebraic process to be 6 rials a kilogram. This should cut the ground from under the black market rate, v-hich is at present, in Bushire, 26 rials a Bushire maund, or about 7-p rials a kilogram. At the same time, the additional profit to Government secured by selling at 5.50 rials the kilogram agrain mixture which (at 4 rials the kilogram of v/h^at and 3 rials the kilo gram of barley') Government can purchase at 3.60 rials a kilo gram, is designed to subsidize the remaining proportion of the town’s daily supply, v/hich will still be issued to the bakers. This will enable them to sell bread to the public at the ''fixed 1 ' rate of 3 rials a kilogram of bread with a fair profit to themselves. At present, as a result of two carefully conducted experiments, it can be demonstrated that a baker buying 400 kilograms of grain from the Supply Department and selling bread to the public, both at the official prices, must make a daily loss of 226 rials. The result is that the official selling price obviously cannot be enforced, and tht bakers, preferring to steal a sheep than a lamb, especially when the danger of being hanged for either is sdslight, have been selling at one rial each, breed flaps which average out at five to the kilogram. Cnee, however, the two selling prices have been logically adjusted, it should be found possible to take action for their enforcement.(a) British Officials &lt; ^ (i) Captain J.B.Hcwcs, His Majesty’s Ccnsul, Bushire, returned from Shiraz or# August 19th. (ii) Mr. G.N.Jackson, Under Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, returned from Kuwait, where he had been officiating as Political Agent, on August 21st and left for Shiraz on August 23rd. (iii) Captain P.F.C. Nicholson, Vice-Consul, Bushire,^left fer Kerman, where he will officiate as Consul, cn August 28th. (b) Allied Officials . Nil. ( c ) Persian Officials . Aqai Kasnai, who officiated as Governor for a period last year, has returned to resume his substantive post as I ayor of Bushire. II LOCAL AFFAIRS . (a) There now seems to be a reasonable chance that the elections, if net again postponed by the Governor-General, may take place in about a week. The Gulf Ports constituency has 7 candidates for 2 seats. This is perhaps inevitable where no deposit is taken from candidates, but it is even more remarkable that the voters should be able to vote even for persons who Lave not entered a candidature. In actual fact, the Election Committ'.o have allotted numbers of votes to the different areas, and the remainder is merely a matter of securing the interest of the dom inant Khans and Rais’s. #* (b) Aqai Safavi, member for Bushire in the present Majlis, has telegraphed the Governor that he has secured the necessary 10 million rials from the Shah for the prevision of a drinking water system for the town. Some such scheme has long been a matter of necessity, and the matter was discussed, by H.II.Consul with Professor Winsor, of the Persian Government Irrigation^ Department, last spring. Naturally, however, th&amp;Tnatter hinged on the provision of funds. III. COMMUNICATIONS . Cable and Wireless Limited are now clearing all the traffic previously handled by the Persian Government wireless station. The latter is shortly to be closed down, and the censor, Mr. Dann, withdrawn. IV. WAR SUPP LIES. * The Movement Control Officer has reported that, since he stationed British Other Ranks to supervise the opening of the cases of lorries on delivery to the U.K.C.C,' assembly yard, a total of nearly 700 lorries were delivered without any shortage of parts. This seems to establish almost beyond doubt that the pilferage of spare parts, which was previously maintained to be taking place between ship and shore, actually took place in the U.K.C.C yard. V. TRIBA L AND POLITICAL . ( a ) Dashti . The disarmament column operating in Dashti has beenwithdrav/rij as part, it is understood, of proposed autumn opera tions against the Qas]ggai. When in Shiraz, H.I'i. Consul took an opportunity to see Aqai Qawarn, the Governor-General, and point out that the moral effect of having a military column on the southern approaches to the tribes 1 winter pastures (or, conversely, the ill-effect.if the column was withdrawn, of seeing minor_chiefs in a nominally settled area, able to defy Government authority) was much greater than the mere presence of another battalion on the migration route. This has apparently been disregarded; and a secondary consequence will be to render any large scale wheat collection in the Dashti-Tangistan-Southern Ports area almost impossible. The total number of rifles collected by these operations is understood to be a mere 250 (authority -- the Governor of Bushire This, however, disregards the important personal advantages that have accrued to Colonel Rafcmju, and his adjutant, Captain Muza- hiri. They will presumably be eventually put on trial and mulct ed of a portion of their gains, sc completing the sequence of this most remarkable system for the collection .of revenue* (b) Dashtistan . Shaikh Mohamed Chahkutahi (a son of the late Shaikh Hussain Chahkutahi, one of Herr Wassmuss’ chief supporters in 1914-18) has, after several false starts-, previously reported, now set to work seriously to re-establish his family’s claim to. the lands from which they were exiled under Reza Shah; and has signalized this by sending his armed thugs to seize the date crop of the present occupiers of the lands. VI■ PUBLIC RELATIONS . K( thing to report. VII FOOD SUPPLIES . The Gulf Ports area is now working on three systemss- (a) in the northern ports area, on a contract between Fathullah Khan and H.M. Consul. (b) in Dashtistan and the Southern Ports area, on contracts granted by the Shiraz Supply Department; (c) In Dashtistan and Tangistan, under the Bushire Supply Department, with (formerly) the assistance of the military c lumn. The results to date are s- (a) about 1000 tons has been delivered; (b) nothing yet,, (c) very small collections so far, and the future gravely prejudiced by the withdrawal of the military column (see above). Collections are c nsiderably handicapped by lack of motor transport, and it is not easy in this area to supplement it by animal transport, owing to the grave losses of draught and pack animals in the recent drought years. VIII. COMMERCIAL aND SHIP P-lFG. (i) One ship called at Bushire during the period under report she landed 500 bales of cotton piecegoods, 20 drums of paint, and 60 cases of distemper. (ii) The commodities. following were the average prices of staple Rials R ials per kilo Mutton 18 Sugar 85 Ghee 63 Flour 9 Rice 20 Barley 4.25 Potatoes (not available) Charcoal 4 Tea 150 Milk 4.50 Eggs (each) , v 1.752 V. TRIBAL AND POLITICAL Aqai Khalil Dashti (see paragraph II above) has been interesting himself in tribal affairs as part of his election campaign. He has acted as intermediary between Rais Hussein Namju (one of the Dashti chiefs) and Sarhang Razmju, O.C of the disarmament force. Aqai Dashti's efforts have not been very successful, Kazmju being still chary of putting a y trust in the military. VI. PUBLIC RELATIONS Activities have been somewhat curtailed by the loan^ of the cinema van to Shiraz. A detailed report on publici ty in this area is being sent to the Public Relations Bureau, Tehran and the Government of India. VII. FOODSTUFFS (a) The Kharbar have failed to make any appreciable collections under land-lordsl undertakings. Fathulla Khan Hiat Daudi, who was contracted by this Consulate General to collect cereals in the northern control area, has so far delivered about 500 tons. (b) Collections from districts in this area for v/hich contracts were # granted by C.L.O., Shiraz, are not known; but it Is understood that the minimum quantity to be collected has been revised downward. (c) The transport situation is bad. Fathullah Khan has asked for motor transport to help speed up deliveries from the interior to the ports of Bandar Dilam, Ganaveh and R Hilleh. An application for tyres made on his behali by the Consulate General has been rejected by the Road Trans port Board. VIII. SHIPPING AND COIILISRCE (a) Two ships called at Bushire during the fortnight, and loaded military stores. (b) Trade generally has been slack and there has been no commercial cargo. It was hoped that the price control law recently passed by the Majlis would have a steadying effect on the market; but there is at present no appreciable de- cline in prices. (c) Prices of essential commodities are given below : Rls. per kilo Mutton Ghi Rice Potatoe s Tea Sugar 16 70 19 unobtainable 200 80 Flour Barley Charcoal Salt Milk E&amp;gs (each) Rls. per kilo . 7.50 4 3.25 5 4.50 2 .

His Majesty's Vice Consul, Bushire. -- 000 O 000V Bu;:hire Intelligence STxmmary No, 12 for the period 1st to 15th July, 1943. J ^ o SfCa. I. MOVEMENTS . (a) B ritish Officials. Captain J.B. Howes, His Majesty's Consul, Bushire. returned from his tour by launch to Asalu (a ctastal village about 200 mile - south of Bushire, where sn emergency aerodrome is to be consb.*ucted) on July 3rd. (b) Alli ed o ffi cials . ^h.1 ( c ’ Per sian officials . (i) Lieut. Mulki, who .had been sent to Lar, has secured his return to Lingeh as Officer Commanding Gendarmerie, after some alight personal outlay. Lieut. Pashai has been posted to Bandar Mugam. (ii) The transfer of Aqai Amidi, Port Officer, Bushire, has at last been secured by this Consulate General. Aqai Suhai, a former officer of the Persian Navy, has been appointed inhis place. Aqai Amidi has consistently aided and abetted the pilferage of war cargoes, and it is unfortunate that it should not have been possible to secure from the Persian Government earlier action on reports to this effect. (iii) Dr. M. Hisabi, C uernor of Bushire, has applied for one month's 3 - v e owing co ill health. Aqai Dashti, President of the Chamber of Coramer$e, promptly telegraphed to Bushire’s Deputy in the Majlis, Aqai Safavi, asking him to have Sarhang Jahid, Chief of Police, appointed as acting Governor. Aqai Dashti’s interest in the matter is probably not unconnected with his hopes of ejection as a deputy in the next Majlis. II. LOCAL AFFAIRS . (a) A slight coolness has been caused between the Chiefof Gendarmerie and the Chief of Police as the former suggested to his superiors in Shiraz that so long as a Gendarmerie garrison is maintained in Ganawah there is no reason to keep any police at that port or Bandar Rig. The proposal was apparently sanctioned without consulting the Chief of Police, Bushire, - who has taken the slight somewhat to heart. (b) Thu newly purchased electric plant has arrived from Khorramshahr. The Company hope to supply electric current to the town within one month's time 5 but are at present repairing the icc plant, which is due to operate next week. III. C OMMUNICATIONS . L and . The Bushire-Shiraz road, which was closed by Army orders on July 6 th, owing to the Persian Army's reverse near Semirun, was re-opened on July 15th. Lease/lend convoys were, however, still held up at the close of the period under report. (b) Two local landlords of Lingeh, Ismail Sa'adi and Amineh bint Hasan Omani, were attacked by a gang of 27 men out side the town and robbed of jewels and luggage to the valueof 4000 tomans. Afterwards they were compelled to drive the robbers into the hills 1 .., their car. The Governor of Lingeh has telegraphed to the Minister of Interior for sanction to engage 40 riflemen, and to issue arms to the people for their own protection. A week later, it was reported that the thieves had actually entered the town and captured the fort. They were, however, evicted by the Gendarmexin^ ind,25°; IV. WAR SUPPLIES . The S.S. Clifford Mallory arrived at Bushire during the period but was diverted. All interests are mak ^6 Reparations to close down their activities on this route. AI the end of the period however, the military received a telegram, cancel! ing a previous telegram which said that the orders lor closur were final. V. TPTBA L AND POLITICAL^ The disammament force has advanced another step, to Kaki. Some of the local chiefs who have been at enmity with Rais AI ^hahuiri ior months, aie now seeking his friendship. Rais Ghul am Razmi of Buluk-i-Dashti and Rais Ali Razmi oRKhormuj have not yet gurrendered their arms, and say that they will do so only when all the other Dashti chiefs have be endisarmed. Ali Ismail has written to Sarhang Razm -)R saying 1 ^i h ? n nn 1 be prepared to be disarmed (and to pay the regulation tomans?, but dare not come in to vi^tSarhangRazmou If the latter insists on his coming in, he claims that he will eirner make for the mountains or leave Persia* VI. PUBLIC RELATI ONS. These are uniformly good. The cinema van gives continual shows, both to civilians and military. The Reading Room has pnmp no against a formidable competitor in the shape oi a newly opened Persian club, where drinks and gambling games provi e strong counter-attractions• VII. FOODSTUFFS . (a) Undertakings for the collection of cereals in Dashti have so far been given by Rais Ghulam Razmi, Ali Razmi, Mohamed Ali Razmi and Darab Khan. According to a report, they are payinfthe peasants at the rate of about Ts.333 per ton of Pure** wheat°and four-fifths of this rate for mixture (wheat and barley). In Tangistan, Rais Ali Chahpiri is reported to be paying the peasants Ts.266 per ton of wheat and Ts.200 per ton of barley. (b) Tehran radio’s announcement of the abolition of the Kharbar Department was well received locally. exploi s here of the 'Supply” Department have included the throwing ?nto tlesta of some 1000 baskets of dates and 80 tons of potatoes, w 1 ’Ch had became uneatable through overstorage and the refusal of the Director, Aqai Nawab, to issue them to the public. (c) The Supply Department are now issuing permits to any person wishing to purchase wheat in the country districts for his consumption. Holders of wheat in Bushire district have natusally Started hoarding their stock. The black market priceof wheat in Borazlun is now Rls.500 per ton (as against the Government purchasing price of Rls350 per ton). Up to the moment only shipments of Aqai Hiat Daudi's contract for the buluks of Liravi, Hiat Baud and Rud Hilleh are being imported and this is keeping the Supply Department provided with their daily issues to the town. No wheat supplied by any other contractors has yet been brought into Bushire. VIII. SHIPPING AND C0MMERCM&amp; (a) The Banque Mellie and the Imperial Bank of Iran have informed merchants that they are now in a position to sefcl the following....following at 10 days notice: Silver ingots @ H .r. 1.25 ?ramme Gold (Turkish Li^' ’ weigh!..' miscals) Rls. 630 each. Local opinion is ^hat the release of this bullion will decrease the value of house property .n the town. (b) The market was stagnant during the period under review owing to the existing embargo on the release of goods from the Customs. The loca? merchants have sent &amp; representation to Tehran asking for the release of th&amp;ir goods from the Customs, oointing out the heavy rate of demurrage accruing on ohenu (c) The following were the prices for staple commodities: Rls per kilo. Mutton 14 Chi 58.50 R j o e 18 Tea 12 CO Sugar 80 Flour 7 Barley 3.40 Bread 8 Milk 4.50 Salt 5 Charcoal • *&gt; O Firewood 1.30 Eggs 2.50 (d) Two ships called at ^ushire during the period. Imports and exports were as follows Imports . Exports . 1140 packages piece goods 13 packages gum Trag. 3' 7 general, 10 ' rose buds. IX. Health and Quarantine . No ship arrived lere in quarantine during the period under report, and the port was free from infectious disease. No fresh cases of typhus nave been reported. Typhoid appears to be on the decline as no fresh case has been reported for past twoveeks. Malaria is very prevalent, and malignant cases showing cerebral symptoms appear to be on the increase. ^ &lt;Tl\J 22nd duly, 1943. His Majesty's Vice-Consul, Bushire.h°. n SECRE* BUSH IRE INTELLIGENCE SUIflARY FOR THE PERIOD 16 TH' i(J 30TH JUNE 1943 I. MOVEMENTS (a) British Officials (i) The Hon’ble Lieutenant Colonel C.G.

This was primarily in connection with a report that Schultz®, the German with Nasir Qashqai, intends to es cape from Ears by sea. (iii) His Majesty’s Consul, accompanied by the Governor, toured Tangistan and Dashti as far as Khormuj on June 24th-, when tribal disarmament and ' r heat collections were the matters for attention. (b) Allied O fficials - Nil. (c) Persian Officials - Nil II. L OC AL AFFAIRS (a) A telegram signed by one ’Adil Khal'at Bari at Tehran was addressed to all merchants and notables of Bushire on be half of the 'Kongreh-i-Melli Iran” advising them to elect Shaikh Ali Dashti and Aqai Jawad Hushmand to the Majlis. (The latter is a Bushiri, and editor of the Tehran newspaper Sa’adat-i-Bashr. He was in prison for 2 years during Reza Shah’s time. Shaikh Ali Dashti is a well-known demagogue and member of the Majlis). Mirza Khalil Dashti, President of the Bushire Chamber of Commerce, having himself aspirations in this direction, replied to this telegram that Bushire knows very well whom to elect this year, and that they are not in need of anyone’s advice. (The second present member for Bushire is Aqai Safawi, editor of the Tehran newspaper 'Kushish”). III. COMMUNICATIONS. During the launch tour of H.M. Consul reported in paragraph 1, arrangements were made for work to begin on the clearing and marking out of the airfield at Bandar Asalu. This lies about half-way between Bushire and Lingeh and its immediate use will be for anti-locust work. The Bushire airfield is nearly complete. It has two runways each of 1800 yards long with white centre strips; and a subsidiary runway 1200 yards long. The approaches are extremely open In one place only it was necessary to buy up a pain grove and level a small hill to make a flying gap. IV. WAR SUPPLIEo . (a) The rate of discharge in the port reached a new Air. high /-— 2 \' high point during the fortnight under report, averaging over 350 tons ner day. This was achieved with only 2 bar ges and 1 tug provided by the I.W.T. The rest was accom plished with locally hired sail-boats. (b) Assembly of lorries shipped in the Henry L. Benning was late in starting, as the chassis had been overstowed in the U.3.A. with truck bodies, cabs and other cargo; and could not be pot out for some days. When assembly did start, it went on at a steady average of 50 per day. V. TRIBAL AND POLITICAL Reference paragraph 1(a)(iii) above; it was unfor tunately found on arrival at Ahram that Colonel Mikhlades, the officer sent by the 'overnor General to inspect pro gress as a result of tb conversation reported at the ead of paragrapn V of mjr last summary, had returned to Kazerun. He had, however, moved the column on from Ahram to IChormuj; and after a short discussion with Rais Ali Chahpiri, v/hich resulted in an increase of the wheat contract for his area, H.M. Consul and the Governor went on to Khormuj in Dashti. On arrival there the party were redeived by Colonel Razmju; who told the governor that some of the chiefs such as Darab Khan, Ghulam Razmi and Ali Ismail, would not come in to Khormui but that he himself would arrange to M visit' them. As much stimulus as possible was applied to this laudable intention. • \ The party visited the old fort of Khormuj, now being i^sed as the force headquarters, where H.M. Consul say some of the rifles which were collected from Tangistan, There were 21, of which only one was at all new. The rest were decrepit, and contained a surprisingly large proportion of old Tsarist Russian rifles (1896). Some 90 others had al ready been sent in to Bushire; but this is still a most inadequate total. V I, PUBLIC RELATIONS (a) The cinema van, which now has at last got a satis- * factory crew to run it is working at full output, with films now also coming :\n from 12th Indian Division. One particularly enthusiastic audience was got at Borazjun; but most of the shows are being given in Bushire itself. (b) A lar^e number o. Persians, officials and others, were present au a fete given in the Residency grounds on June 19th in aid of the Persian Gulf Fighter Fund. They stayed late and supported everything well. A sum of just unda?r 90,00 r rials was raised by the fete. VII. FOODSTUFFS (a) Reference paragraph I (a)(iii). The Governor asked Rais Ali Chahpiri what was the total amount of cereals he expected to collect from Tangistan. He replied that the harvest had not been satisfactory owing to the shortage of seed last year, and that he had given an undertaking for 40 tons of wheat. The Governor deman ded that he should increase it to 50 tons, and promised to give him monopoly goods to the value of 5 tons (10^). This was accepted by Chahpiri after a long argument. At /-At Khormuj the Rais-i-ICharbar gave the following figures as the undertakings given for wheat surplus 100 tons from Rais Ali Haidar Razmi (Khormuj), I/Iohammed Ali Razmi (Sana), and Darab Khan (Shumbeh). 65 tons from Rais Ghulam Razmi (Buluk-i-Dashti) 18 tons from various people. 183 tons The Rais-i-Kharbar added that the majority of the wheat surplus is at Ab-dan, where Ali Ismail and other chiefs are centred, and unless force is used there is no hope of its being collected. Colonel Razmju promised that he would see that the sirplus from this area is collected. The opinion of the Foodstuffs Department official/ was confirmed by H.M. Consul at Dayyir during his recent tour. There, the only undertaking given is for 100 tons, but no inducement could produce a higher figure, as the contractor (independently confirmed by the Bakhshdar) said that any additional amount above this could only be obtained from areas at present devoid of law and order. (b) The Finance Department have received instructions to collect income tax from the ’Itimadieh Mill at the old rate f v the year 1321 (1942-43). Mr. Agar, the Manager, is now , -ing the dividends for the above period, previously held up* by°him (vide paragraph VIII (c) of my summary for May 31st) VI II. COMMERCIAL AND SHIPPING (a) Meat is still scarce and may be expected to increase in price still further. Other prices have had a slight down ward tendency this fortnight.

(d) The I.W.T. tu^ -&gt;.T.9 has now been repaired and the 39 year old tug mentioned in paragraph 4(e) of my Summary for 15th January is being tov*ed to Basra. V. TRIBAL AND POLITICAL (a) In a letter addressed to this Consulate General, Hussain Namju, the Chief of Buluk Drazi in the Dashti area, has enquired why no action has yet been taken to restore security in Tangistan and Dashti and hov* it is that the authorities are content to leave these two districts in the hands of men of the type of Rais All Chahoiri, whom he described as 'a rioter treacherous and selfish 1 '. He hoped that no&gt;r that a good relations existed between the British and Persian Governments, action would be taken to rectify this lamentable state of affairs and offered to assist in any way he could. eriod. Cargo awaiting despatch totals 7642 tons (b) /(b) It has recently been renorted that the Khans of Ambarak and Jamali (both petty chiefs) have had consultations with Rais Ghulam Razmi who agreed to joint action to secure the removal of Rais Ali Chahoiri from Ahram.

(b) During the tour of the Resident’s secretary in the southern ohibkuh area, personal relations were established with the Zabits of the various towns, and distribution of dates and cotton cloth made to the starving and the ragged VII. FOOD oJPRLIEd (a) The Governor is said to have received petitions from tie Chiefs of Khiari and ^mbarak of Tangistan containing bitter criticism of Rais All Chahpiri’s failure to allot any share of available foodstuffs to these areas where acute starvation is said to exist. (b) The Governor left for Tangistan and Dashti on 24th January to inspect crops. He was accompanied by the Head of the Bushire education Department. (c) Bushire foodstocks are now almost exhausted. On the 8th February r ' eat stoc?cs were down to 14 days supply. a small stock * barley, most of which had been earmarked for the local garrison, is now being mixed with the wheat and it is hoped that this '’ill enable Bushire to last out until the 100 tons released from British Army stocks arrive. Approximately 5000 tons of sugar and 500 tons of tea are held in the Bushire Customs, while the neonle of the town are having to pay eight tomans (twelve shillings) for a pound of tea, and six tomans (nine shillings) for a kilogram of sugar. heat and fish have been scarce and for several days neither was available. The scarcity of meat has b°en due partly to the difficulty of procuring animals suitable for slaughter, but mainly to the decision of the butchers to go on strike in protest against price control measures introduced by the Municipality. (d) Those who are accustomed to a more liberal diet than rice and wheat, lentils, goat flesh and araq are hard hit by the recent ddict, issued without consultation with those principally affected, that import licenses for tinned provisions can no longer be obtained. This edict does not of course affect the Forces who have their canteens or the oil companies for whom special arrangements are made. Though it is possible to live on the country on the plateau it is quite impossible to do so in the coastal belt and the matter has been represented. VIII. ECONOMIC I’timadieh Mill . Mr. Agar the Manager and Mr.Dashti, Managin' Director of the I’timadieh Mill are in the throes of one of thieirperiodic estrangements. Neither trusts the other very far, and Mr. Dashti is at the moment deeply suspicious of Mr. Agar’s plan to put part of last year’s profits into increasing the share issue. I r.Agar is at present engaged in endeavouring to secure support for his plan and spent some days in ohiraz canvassing share holders there. A meeting of the Managing Committee has been called to examine the cuestion at which stormy scenes are expected.On his return from Jhiraz Lr. -agar announced that by increasing the orice o ' his cloth sales there by l/o he had collected 200,000 rials, all of which he intended to give to charity.

(b) Persian Officials, (i) Aqai Bakhtari left for Tehran on the 17th November. His transfer to Tehran was unofficially represented to him by one of his colleagues as being due to a 'political change'. It is hoped, however, that this Residency's representations to His Majesty's Legation had^some influence in the matter. Aqai Abbas Ali Salahshur has been appointed Acting Director of Posts and Telegraphs. ^ (ii)_Barhang salar Khosrowdad Officer Commanding Gendarmerie, ^arrived on an inspection tour on the 22 nd November accomoanied by barwan bhadrawan, Officer Commanding, Gendarmerie, Bushire.

The strength of the detachment has been increased to 15 other ranks. # (iii) General Connolly and Colonel Shingler of the U.S.Army visited Bushire by plane on November 16th. II. LOCAL AFFAIRS. (a) The staff of the Post Office and Economic Departments left their offices on the 24th November and rushed the bakery shops for bread. This was an intrigue against the Acting Governor, who has appointed an unpopular’man in charge of the Bazaar control. (b) The present supply of wheat in Bushire is not sufficient to feed even the town itself till next harvest, to say nothing the dependent districts. The v/heat supply brought by the S 3. Empire Zeal in August has been depleted by orders from the m 'tral Ministry of Foodstuffs for the despatch of consignments to other Gulf ports. RECfc POL. DEPt. 1 JAN 3 J3 INDIA OFFICE /(c)(c) The price of meat has risen from Rls.5.50 per kilo to Rls.7.0. This'is partly due to shortage of fodder, due to the lateness of rainfall, and partly to the raid by villagers of Kolol on the flocks of the Bushire butchers reported in para graph V(iv)(b) of my summary for 15th November. (d) A man from Dashti recently sold his two children in . Bushire. One of them was bought by a petty merchant and the other by a Tehran! motor driver, not, of course, as slaves, « but in order to relieve the father’s distress. (e) Attacks on caravans in Bashti^tan and on houses in Bushire itself by armed bands continued to be rife during the period under report. oarwar ohadrawan has had several inter views with the Resident’s Secretary, and has promised to take effective action.

Post al The United kingdom Commercial Corporation undertook the forwarding of the vast accumulation of mail bags for Shiraz on the 17th November. At the close of the period under report however, they had not received payment for this service, and were refusing to accept further mails. I An arrangement has since been made through the Residency for them to accent mail bags on the Governor's personal undertaking to settle the bills promptly on the first of each month, and provided that the outstanding bill is paid. It is understood that negotiations for a general mail contract are in progress in Tehran.) IV. WAR SUPPLIES (a) The position of the port has been improved by the sending of another tug, the I.W.T. force now being two tugs and five barges. This had to some extent mitigated the evil of the seven mile haul between ship to shore. (b) The S.S. Dona Aniceta arrived and the 3.S. Vermeer sailed, during the period under report. 287 lorries were discharged, of which 167 were assembled. None of these had h'-cn despatched at the close of the period', but 28 U.S.S.R. and 31 U.K.C.C. lorries previously assembled were despatched in addition, of course, to regular contracted lorry convoys. The U.S.^.R. have 550 tons of steel awaiting onward despatch. (c) A meeting was held in the Town Residency on 25th November when security and anti-pilfering measures were dis cussed.

He is sal ^. ^® v ! ri c ??' ir firmed certain Chiefs in their de facto authority in their local atreas. The area from the Mund River northwards to Khormuj has been xiaXtsA allotted to Rais Ghulam Razmi; that from the Mund River southwards to Dalyir to Darab Khan, a nd G*llehzani and the area around Daiyir ±tsi itself to All Isma.d.1. The chiefs were asked to keep order in their districts, and their possession of licensed rifles already allotted to them by Colonel Muqbili was ' C0 ” f J; rmed * report is confirmed by information received from another Dashti source to the effect that the powers of Gendarmerie have been restricted and that the chiefs them* selves will be responsible for maintaining law and order in their areas. It therefore appears doubtful if the operations in Dashti have achieved much towards th re establishment of government authority. A t^ace among the chiefs themselves has been patched up ar» tnelr 'feudal' authority affirmed rather than counteracted. fiD There is confirmation from another source of the revenge taken by All Ismail against the Karami family reported in- the last diary. He is said to have seized a quantity of wheat from these Shaikhs, in return forthe^r support of the Persia n troops in the recent 'operations J . All Ismail is also embroiled, for the same reason, with Ma shhadi Ghulam Hussein, of Ab-Dan. (ill) The military garrison of Kaki ha s been recalled, (b) Tanglstan. A boat alleged to belong to Husain Haji Safar landed smuggled goods on 10th September at Gavaina k, some 25 miles south of Bushire on the Tangistan coast.

(a)(i) Reference paragraph V(e) of summary for 1st to 15th September; it is reported that Major Nuri persuaded Rais Ali Chahplri to withdraw his riflemen from the area of Kolol village, as Hussain AU11 and Hussain Namju professed that, of the goods plundered from the caravan, some had been consumed, and some restored to the Persian Government authorities^ It is understood that one of these'restorations' consisted of 1,000 tomans to the Persian military authorities, which may account for Major Hurl's olive branch. It is understood that Rais Ali Chahpiri has restored certain landed property in Khormuj to the two Ambarakis headmen Mashhadi Ja’far and Abdul Hussein, The ubiquitous Rais Ghulam Razmi is a Iso reported as having intervened in this quarrel.

Hallows, returned to Bushire from Bahrain on September 12th. (b) Lt.-Col. P.R. Berridge, C.R.E. South Persia,^ visited Bushire on September 10th, accompanied by Captain w . Cannon, Garrison Engineer, Bushire. (ii) Persian officials. (a) Aqai Haemal has arrived and taken charge of the Municipality. He seems keen and energetic, and has succeeded in getting Shiraz to export to the Bushire market some of the vegetables and fruit which they were previously refusing to allow to be taken out of Shiraz. (b) Aqai Daulatsha^i has returned and assumed charge as Director of Customs. Aqai itbasalti, who was his assistant in the Customs, is, however, still holding charge as Acting Governor. (c) Professor Winsor, of the Persian Government Irrigation Department, visited Bushire on September 11th and 12th. He is hoping to find a source of artesian drinking wat? r for the town about 35 kilometres away. Some scheme of th_ 'ort is indeed one of vital necessity, especially after s dry year like the one just passed. (iii) Allied officials. (a) Commissar Shapoff has rejoined the Russian Mission. Comrade Azaroff has left for Tehran. (hj Major W. Kennard, U.S. Army, has arrived with seven American Army other ranks. Captain H.M. /U Is on i^as left.

Four ships called at Bushire during the period under report and discharged 50f0 packages, 4000 of v/hich were t^a for Russia. Exports were of local produce, viz. rosewater and lambskins.

(c) Angali. Ahmed, the Khan of Angali, has considerably deteriorated from his last war record. The recent theft of sugar (reported in paragraph IY of my report for 15th August) was committed under the nose, and probably with the connivance, of the guards provided by him, and led by his son, Abbas &lt;^uli Khan. He has now taken to levying a tax of three tomans on every bag of smuggled wheat landed at Shif (a small fishing port to the north of Bushire). Recently a man who refused to pay this levy, was shot by Ahmed Khan’s tax collector; and as a result it is understood that gendarmerie are to be stationed at Shif. (d) Daahti. (i) Shaikh Mohamed, of the notorious Ghahkutahi family, now seems to be intriguing with the Kedkhudas of M Bulook w (Deh Rud) against Rais Ghulam Razmi. He is said to have sent his daughter to Captain Isfandiari, Chief of Gendarmerie, with a request to supply him with arms. It is not known for certain with what success this romantic move has met, and at present Chahkutahi has moved up to Shiraz, where Isfandiari has already gone. The whereabouts of the daughter are not known. Rais Ghulam Razmi has written to this Consulate-General, complaining of the issue of 10 rifles to Chah v utuht, but independent information is that he has noi been given more than 3 or 4. (ii) It is learnt that Ali Ismail has taken retributive • action against Sheikh Karam, of Ab-dan, who helped isfandiari in the recent operations (or '•manoeuvres 0 , to use a more apt description).

MOVEiENTS British Officials . An Oxford plane, with Squadron Leader Cotton and Flight-Lieut. Curmow. arrived on 22nd for reconnaissance connected with the possible installation of radio-location equipment here. They left the same day. As the visit had not been notified in advance, it was not possible to make such satisfactory arrangements for them as would otherwise have been the case. (B) Persian Officia-ls . (i) The Governor-elect, Aqai Vajdi, has not yet appeared. Probably he is, wise man, awaiting the rising of the star Suhail, when the Persian Gulf summer is considered to be over its worst. (ii) A President of the Municipality has at last been appointed, Aqai Kasmai. But he is also immobilized in Shiraz; and the only interest he has so far shown in his new sphere of authority has been to send down and borrow 200 tumans from a local merchant. (iii) A commission of Government inspectors has, however, arrivea; and on the last day of the period under report, it :as stated that Lieut. Avar, the corrupt and inefficient 'kief of Police, whose removal has been secured at last, was b.ing 'sweated'. II. SHIPPING AND COMMERCIAL Seven ships called at Bushire during the period under report and discharged 2600 tons of commercial cargo. (The total discharge of the port, including war supplies, exceeded 5400 tons in the fortnight). The only export was 110 tons of wheat for Lingah. (ii) Owing to a couple of bankruptcies in Shiraz, the banks restricted credit during the period under report. The price of sugar declined to about 165 tumans a bag, as merchants were obliged to sell stocks in order to meet their commit ments. There are still over 6000 tons in stock; but not steps have been taken to issued Government sugar to the * public, who are obliged' to buy sugar at commercial rates, III. COMMUNICATIONS (Telegraphic) At the beginning of the fortnight, orders were received by the Persian Telegraph Department to impose a 24 hour delay on all telegrams in Latin character. The reason for this is not known. It was not applied to the Residency's /telegramsMe2 telegrams, and was withdrawn completely after three days. IV. WAR SUPPLIES Ships have been delayed through the Customs being choKed with the volume of commercial cargo that has entered the port during the period under report. Boatowners have in many cases simply refused to go out to ships, because it has meant a wait of 2 or 3 days at the Customs wharf before they can be discharged. The seasonal disappearance of cool’es from Bushire during the hot weather is at the bottom of this, and even contracts for piece work fail to attract them - not unnaturally - to labour in the broiling sun, refreshed --y brackish water, and sustained by bread which (unlike the' in habitants of more favoured areas) they can get by only a lengthy struggle in the crowd outside the bakeries. Every possibility was discussed with the Customs authorities; but 'v 9 problem used to occur even in the hot weathers of peace, when two or three ships a week, often lightly loaded, was the capa ;ity of the port. The problem was aggravated by the fact*; that v:ie good wages paid during the last few months have enabl many a coolie to stand himself what he doubtless const s a well-earned rest; also that the two power cranes now ha a to be reserved for the landing of lorries for assem 1 '' v« i “ter continued pressure had been put on the Customs, and direct Seeps taken to enlist extra coolies (although a large proportion of those so obtained^ walked out when they saw the loads they were required to handle), the coolie 1 nowever eventually improve, and at the close of Ilthe period under report was abreast of the shipping. difficulties have been made by local boatowners; but after sundry meetings and discussions, it seems that this problem is on the way to solution. ■A • LoW/ki. (iii) Some smugglers’ hoards have been detected; but the un-cooperativeness of the Chief of Police (whose relief is however, expected) has prevented arrests from being made. ? . some initial obstructiveness the local gendarmerie seem to be adopting a more helpful attitude without the necessity for action being taken against their Chief having actually arisen. This is fortunate, as his services to the general security of the area are of greater importance than the pilferage of (when all is s a id and done) comparatively minor quantities of foodstuffs. At the end of the period under -eport, a raid was carried 0 ut on Jufrah, at which represent atives of the J.K.C.C. and the Consulate were present. Some °f wheat were found buried and other commodities in the h. in larger quantities than the circumstances of the in- ii. tants would warrant. A. TRIBAL ALT) • • • •o V. IIUBAL X.'D POLITICAL Ci) fevshti . Colonel Muqbill, the Chief of Staff of the Fars Division, has returned to Shiraz. A small present of 15,000 tumans has, however, followed him. The subscript ion list for this sum is said to have been as follows This may be read in conjunction with a recent meeting of Colonel Muqbili with Ali Ismail, when the fatter was given twenty licensed rifles and allowed to return to Daiyir. Licensed rifles (some of them being Brno or 10 - shot magazine rifles) were also issued to Rais Ghulam Razmi, and the smaller fry. The military garrison at Kaki now consists of only 50 men under a lieutenant 5 although small parties of gendarmerie are installed in the coastal villages. In view, however, of the intrigues noted above, an anti gendarmerie and anti-Isfandiaii (the Chief of Gendarmerie) policy may be shortly expected. There are signs that Rais Ghulam Razmi and Rais Ali Chahpiri intend shortly to settle scores with two of the petty chiefs (Hussain Auli and Zair Hussain Namju) who backed Isf a ndiari; and 'Haidar Haidar' has occupied one of the latter's gardens. (ii) Tang istan . Razmi and Chahpiri have, hcbwever, a more seriousapponent in the shape of Sheikh Muhammad Chahkutahi, whose comeback' was reported in last summary for July 31st (para 153 (a)). Razmi does not wish, or intend, to give up the fertile area of 'Bulook'; and Chahkutahi is said to be claiming Chaghadak (the scene of Herr Wassmuss' post-last- war farming endeavours) from Chahpiri. The latter has sent twenty men to help Razmi, so presumably the former of these two areas is the one which is engaging Chahkutahi's more immediate attention. VI. FOOD SITUATION. (i) The local Government, acting on orders from Tehran, have stopped the issije of wheat to British concerns. Action has been taken, and it is hoped that this will soon bear fruit; as the employees of these concerns cannot get bread at the bakeries either, if they are recognized as such. (ii) At the beginning of the month, the s.s. Hepong landed 50 tons of dates in bulk at Lingah, for the R.A.F. As one of the lighters approached the shore, it was rushed and .gcd by the starving populace, whom the officials were powerless to control. Ali Ismail Rais Ghulam Razmi an^.)

Hay, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, proceeded to Bahrain on 9th August on tour. ( b ) Persian Officials 1. Mr. Hasan Javid, the new Manager of the National Bank of Iran, Bushire, arrived on the 1st August and took o\ ? ~r from Mr. Bahooshi. % After Mr. Bahooshi had relinquished charge of the Bank, the Chamber of Commerce, Bushire, gave a farewell party in his honour. 2. • Captain Isfandiari, the Officer Commanding Troops in Dashti an&lt;i the Road Guard Force. Bushire, returned on the 4th August, operations in Dashti bei g ended. 3. Colonel Moqbili, Chief of the Staff of the Army Division in Shiraz, who had gone'direct from Shiraz to Dashti, returned with Captain Isfandiari. 4. Dr. Siadat, Chief Quarantine Medical Officer, Bushire, left for Tehran on the 7th August. 5. Lieut. Amidi (ex Persian Navy, and Port Officer, Bushire) has been transferred to the Economics Department at Shiraz. He no doubt hopes to find this appointment as lucrative as distance to smugglers made his previous one. OBITUARY Mir Ali Zahir, the Governor of Bushire, died of heart disease on the 6th August. The funeral which was arranged by Colonel Moqbili took place the same day and he was buried at Imamzadeh, a village about 6 miles south east of Bushire. H.B.M 1 s Consul-General'and H.B.M 1 s Consul accompanied the cortege to the burial ground. /II. Shipping ....i 2&gt; / II. SHIPPING AND CPU ERCIAL (a) Eight ships called at Bushire during the period ■sounder report. Imports (apart from lorries) consisted of 2000 tons of wheat (not yet wholly discharged),-2000 pacT-ares of sugar, 4000 of piece goods and 1000 of tea. Some 2000 tons of oi- and general cargo were also discharged. Exports cor-' sisted of goat hair, tobacco, assafoetida and gum tragaca ..a. (b) Business with India has been somewhat di$couraged by the news of disturbances there. (c) Sugar averaged Rials 1800 per bag. It is under stood that a large proportion of the recent imports were from Bandar Abbas ? where the price is only Rials 1500; and that these commodities were in turn imported ther&lt;* from Di;bai. Tue stock in the Customs exceeds 5000 tons, and the stock with merchants is about 7CG tons. Hi. TRIBAL AND POLITICAL (a) Dashtl (i) With the capture of Daiyir, and th0 return of -aptain Isfandiari to Bushire, and of the troops to Shiraz,' operations against the rebels in Dashti have dome to an end. Captain Isfandiari took an early opportunity call on H.M. consul,^ and to give his version of how he had been hindered from bringing the affair to a c npletely successful conclusion by the imposition on his headquarters of Sheikh Abdullah i^orazjani, a politically-minded mullah, by th^ Governor- General. He represented his final attack on Ali Ismail at Daiyir, as having bedn held up for 17 days while this worthy engaged in negotiations; and blamed him for ijhe fact that Ali Ismail was able to make good his escape to the hills, and to send out from Daiyir a large part of his illicitly-gained property to hiding places in Qatar and elsewhere. It is, how ever, ^not improbable that Isfandiari prefers to keep the Dasht: problem open, as acontinuing source of loot and ^lorv, i) hat order, to himself. ' Letters oP complaint against Isfandiari have been sent to this Consulate General by Rais Ali Chahpirj. (Tangistan), Rais Ghulam Razmi (Dashti) and Sheikh Nasir Nasoori (Kangan). Sheikh Abdullah Borazjani is reported to have taken a considerable sum from Ali Ismail, to paint Isfandiari as slack as possible to the Governor-General, Four of the Dashti leaders including Khfclu Hussein of Barden Khan, are at present under detention in Bushire and are being cross-examined by the Amnieh, (b) Jangistan Rais Ali Chahpiri is now receiving complaints from subordinate chiefs, whom he stopped from smuggling when he came to Tangistan some months ago. This follows on the arrest of a smuggling dhow belonging to Rais Ali Chahpiri /himselfhimself, by the Amnieh. Needless to say, it is Rais Ali's selfishness in keeping the 'racket' to himself, rather than his lawlessness, which has caused the indignant protests. *^IV. WAR SUPPLIES The assembly rate of lorries by U.K.C.C. has dropped still further, owing to the bodies and chassis being dis charged several days before t.he driver's cabs, preventing lorries from being completed and removed from the Assembly fard. ihis has resulted in the Customs Yard becoming choked, and landing of lorries and other goods has become more difficult. A considerable improvement could be effected if an old wrecked barge, lying off the Cusdroms, could be dynamited. This has bee^n reported and suggested several times by successive Tenth Army representatives;' but it does not seem possible to provide a demolition squad. Numbers of lorries, ready assembled here, are held up from despatch, for want of drivers. It is understood that the insecurity of the road further north is ^^eventins drivers from returning from Tehran. ~ i A theft of a considerable quantity of sugar from one of the U.K.C.C. godov/ns took place during the period under report, when the godown wall was broken down. The guards on the spot, provided by the Khan of Angali, who was well- disposed to us in the last war have been arrested for interrogation. Two persons, i eluding an ex-employee of U.K.C.C., who was suspected of being behind the strike reported in para 148 of summary dated 16th July, have been put into Court in connection with the incident*reported in para 155 of summary for 31st July. v - FOOD SITUATION (a) The s.s. Empire Zeal has brought about 2000 tons of v/heat, which has relieved the situation,' At one stage during the period under report, the town had only three'days £ 'lies; but a consignment of 50 tons from Shiraz tided it over till the ship arrived. (b) The worst feature of the situation is smuggling (largely made possible, as previously reported, by bad tallying, coupled with the necessity for the lighters to cover several miles bertween ship and shore, which period gives ample opportunities for illicit business); and this is xehx reducing the amount effectively disposable by the Economics Department. The wheat is, of course,.reaching Persian mouths; but as a system of distribution it cannot be admired. All possible pressure is being exercised; but wheli the Chief of Police (whose dismissal has now, however, been secured) and Chief of Gendarmerie are taking alternate nights to rake their own percentage off the smugglers, very iittle active assista-nce can be expected. The eventual solution can only be found in armed preventiya patrols in motor launches, combined with accurate tallying, to enable action to be taken with certainty against boatmen who show a deficiency. 3d. J. 3. Howe s Secretary to the Political Readent in the Persian Gulf. British Residency and Consulate- General, Bushire, 20th August 1942.i \ |ND£XEO i+\l6 m fo j&gt;W Diary for the British residency Bushire^ for the period 16th and Consulate-General, to 3ist July,1942. I. Movements . (a) British officials . (l) Captain J.B.Hov/es, Secretary to the Political Resident, returned from Shiraz on the 25th July. (2) Mr. H.J.Sinclair, Additional Vice Consul, Bushire, left for Kazerun and Shiraz on 27th July. (3) The Hobble Lieut.-Colonel J.R.Hay, CIS., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and H II. * s Consul-General, Bushire, returned from tour on 29th July by service aircraft from Bahrain. (4) Captain Cannon, Garrison Engineer, left for Shiraz on the 27th July. (b) Allied officials . Captain Peragoff and Nina Mikhailovna have left. Comrade Azaroff has relieved Comrade Shapoff. (c) Persian officials . (1) On the 21st July Dr, Earned ^iadat the Chief quarantine Medical Officer, Bushire, set out for Borazjan and Shahbankareh on inspection duty and returned to Bushin on the 26th. (2) Captain Karimlu, Recruiting Officer, Bushire, proceed ed to Kazerun on short visit on the 23rd July and came back to headquarteis on the 26th. II. shipping and Commercial . (a) 5 ships called at Bushire during the period under report. The bulk of the imports consisted of lorries and war supplies; other imports comprised l$0 tons of piece-goods, 250 tons of tea and 160 tons of general cargo. Exports consisted of 200 cases of opium. (b) The average price of sugar was Rials 1750 per bag (lOO kilos.). Approximate stocks are 5,600 tons in the Customs, and 150 tons with merchants. The market price of tea at the close of the fortnight y/as Rials 54 per packet (500 grammes). Merchants nave received information that the export of tea xrom India has been prohibited* This has caused consideiaole loeax anxiety, as many of them hold stocks of tea in Ii-tdia awaiting shipment. III. 152. Commu ni cations ( Land). Reports continue to be received of the exactions levied from travellers on the Shiraz road by the '’chiriks' 1 (riflemen) commanded by Shuja Nizam. a leading Bushire merchant was recently robbed of his coat containing some cash, some documents and a watch and chain ?;hile asleep by the roadside at Konar Takhteh. It is reported that the Amnieh (road-guards) have- recovered his documents for him; but they do not stem tc ' have been so successful (from the point of view of tnc merchant ) with regard to the money and the watch. Tribal and Political. / 150 . IV.2 - 153. (a) Dashtiat an • Shaikh Mohamcd, the aon of Shaikh Hussain Chahkutahi, v/ho v/as a supporter of the German, V/assmuse, during the last war, has arrived back on hie father's estates. (The family v/ere exiled to Tabriz by he za Shah.) He appears to bear some- sort of authority to resume possession^ and this is causing considerable confusion in the Revenue Department, as the estate has long since been cultivated by bona fide possessors. (k) Dashti. There appears to be no progress in the negotia tions between Captain Isfandiari, the Chief of Amnieh, and Ali Ismail, the principal unsubdued rebel. The other outstanding leader, Haidar-i-Maidar, is evidently ’•feeling the draught', as he recently visited Rais Ali Chahpiri, of Tangistan, and asked him to negotiate for him a defensive alliance with Hussain Auli and Nanjoo, the chiefs of Bunah Darazi and Kotol. He could hardly have selected a worse intermediary (see next sub-paragraph) \ (e) Tangiatan« The semi-ofiicial rule of Rais Ali Chahpiri is increasing in high-handedness, and has caused complaints to be made to this Consulate-General. He seems to oe how on the verge of conflict with the Amnieh with regard to the smuggling ’’racket' on the Tangistan coast. His nephew recently killed a villager of Kotol, and the chiefs of Bunah Darazi and Kotol have rejected Rais Ali T a offer of blood money and stated that they v/ill appeal to Captain Isfandiari. The latter is a personal enemy of Rais Ali’s and it is not unlikely that, when he has disposed of Dashti, he will turn his attention to Tangistan. Rais Ali probably realises this. (d) Hiat Daud. The customs authorities have seized two smuggling dhows, one at Ganawah and one at Kharg Island. V. Agriculture . 154. Hussain A4a I’timad (’’Mr .Agar' ), the owner of the I^imadieh cotton mills in Bushire, has been negotiating to take over 4^0*1 Hectares of the Persian Governments irrigation project at bhabankareh* and is reported to have already secured some agricultural tractors. His plan is to grow cotton for his mills, saving the transport charges on cotton brought down from further north. He is gloating a Company, to be called the 'Shirkat-i-Sahami-yi- Shabankareh', v/ith a capital of 2tT million Rials. VI. The United Kingdom Commercial Corporation. 155. A possible repercussion of the strike recorded in the last summary occurred during the period under report, when a fracas took place in the town involving two of the Corporation’s employees, one of them being their chi^f security man, and one of the Corporation’s lorries sustainC'. a broken windscreen. . The pilferage of cargoes continues, stolen goods being mostly landed at the newly developed port of ••Bandar Jofreh' - previously an obscure fishing village. This village li^-S c the outskirts of Bushire, and therefore on the marches between the authority of the town police and the road * Previously this caused some dispute as to who had the righ, to 'squeeze* the smugglers; but from one report it seems / that * He intends to cultivate it by scientific methodsM • -3- that agreement hae been amicably achieved on a ,, fifty-fifty' basis* It is difficult to take steps to prevent this pilferage owing to the unsatisfactory tallying systems employed by the shipping agents and other organisations concerned. sd.

Rials 1100 - 1125 are offered for Ss.100 in the open market; but there is little business now that the Banks are selling freely at the new official rate. VI. TRIBAL AND POLITICAL. (a) Dashti . The (Government troops have occupied Kaki, which was the rebels 9 headquarters. They have also occupied Lavar and posted auxiliary road guards there, despite some opposition by Rais Ali Ohahplri, of Tanglstan. Thereafter Three of the Dashti leaders, viz. Khalu Hussain and Bahmiar of Bardeh Khan, and Haji Ghulam Dashti, have surrendered; and it is also reported that, afte* an attack on his village of Eaqih Ahmedan, ff Haider Haidar 11 has tendered his submission. (A hoard of 30 tons of wheat was captured by the troop* as a result of this attack.) After the occupation of Kaki, a night attack was made on the troops there by Ali Ismail's men. (He himself, it is learnt, was not present). The attack was beaten off. (b) 3iiabankareh. The Amnieh have dispersed a gang of robbers ai a place called 2iarat; 2 of the robbers and 1 of the road guards was killed. (The irregular security duties of Malik Mansur Khan in this area have for some time been very laxly carried out). (°) Hiat -Oeiu d . Sargurd Hurl, Commandant of the Bushire garrison, has stationed 22 men with 2 machine guns at Jakhravari, a village outside Ganaweh, on the Gaoh Saran road. (They have, however, only animal transport to use, if called upon to carry out a punitive or preventive raid ) / (d)(&amp;) frirayi . 1 hoard of ToMarus 10,180 has been found hy Mohaaea 'ill KTaan in the fort at Hissar. This is said to have been the private 'aaTinga' of Ahmed Shah, steward of the late Aaa Khan, who was in charge of the heirs until Mohamed Ali Khan seized the fort. The hoard is said to have been revealed ov one of the daughters of the late Aq.a Khan, hut as Ahmed Shah has been held hy the Hiat Daud Khans for some time, it is not unlikely that the source of the information was a more direct one. (•) General . Consular area, During the Secretary's recent tour of the Consular area, practically all the Khans and Rais’s at some stage expressed a desire for direct relations with the British Government, to whom they professed 'obedience'. Their immediate hope was that thereby the Amnieh would be . removed from their territories, and they would themselves be put in charge of security and provided with rifles to do Sd, J,B, Howes.

Persian officials . Sargurd Yusuf Nuri, Officer Commanding Bushire garrison, left for Fehlian on the 24th June. II. Communications ♦ 133. On the 15th June a lorry carrying rice for the Economics Department, Bushire, was attacked at Miankotal on the Bushire- Shiraz road and its load of 40 bags removed. The driver was wounded in the foot. Some of the robbers were later recaptured and the sugar recovered. Two caravans on the Bushire-Jthram road were attacked and a large quantity of carpets and fruit carried off. HI. Tribal and Political . 134. Interest centres in the attempts of the Govemment forces to complete the submission of the Dashti chiefs. The opera tions resemble not a little the desultory warfare of the Chinese warlords. Chiefs change sides, siding even with the Govemment troops, and are cheerfully prepared to desert to any of a number of sides for temporary advantage. If a good victim presents himself from among a group even his temporary allies will turn and rend him for his store of wheat, his incautiously ostentatious household effects, or a hoard of smuggled crepe de chine. In the action at the beginning of the fortnight against the unfortunate Hxaidar Maidar whom jbobody seems to like, some nine chiefs headed by Rais Ghulam Razmi supported the Government troops and shared the booty. Eleven chiefs including the luckless Haidar then submitted and undertook to give up the rifles which they had removed from the Road Guards last October. But these surrenders and undertakings are glibly promised and readily forgotten. Events and the return of Isfandiari, the road guard chief in charge of the operations, may be awaited before a truer appreciation of the situation can be made. According to reports Ali Ismail, clinging to hi s pirate port of Daiyir astride a smuggling route, is the only major rebel udio has not surrendered. Though well armed the combina tion against him is strong and columns of Government troops are in a position to converge on him from north and south. Tortune has temporarily favoured him in the guise of a valuable mixed cargo belonging to Bushire merchants which Al^s pirates seized as the dhow which brought it was rashly lingering off Daiyir. The merchants are hot to regain their captured cargo and are bringing pressure to bear in high quarters in Bushire to have the voracious Isfandiari called off as interested less in the hardened rebel meekly making submission than in the successful smuggler reluctantly /disgorgingdisgorging silks and sugar* All Ismail is also casting around for assistance among the uncomfortable allies of Rais Ghulam Razmi and Isfandiari in order to avoid losing power to the one and too much money to the other* Isfand;-ari *s cunning however is second^only to his ability to profit from it* The warlordlike desertions and the professxMBt-ed submissions are largely due to his skill in dividing his enemies and in the past he was able to divide and rule as well as to divide and profit. However, after a somewhat comic opera campaign in which intrigues hatched around a qalyan shared often by the chiefs he sought to break have played a greater part than pitched battles and in which probably more bribes have changed hands than shots been fired* lafandiar^a full pockets will only be forgiven him if the chiefs* forts are emptier of rifles* On this crucial point information is still awaited* The fairly friendly operations in Dabhti appeat to have permitted the passage across the battle area of M.Vayda, a Hungarian irrigation engineer under the Iranian Government, to visit the Mund River. He is believed to have reported that the proposed irrigation dam v/ill be uneconomic to construct and will irrigate only a small area but that the Government will be v/ell advised to build the dam in order to provide the allegedly starving Dashtis with employment. Shipping and Commercial . Four ships called in the fortnight and food imports included 2650 tons of sugar, 1250 tons of wheat, and 1600 tons of flour* Including the above 2650 tons the Sugar Monopoly stocks now total 5650 tons. Merchants hold only 100 tons. There is considerable complaint at the action of the Tea Monopoly in raising their price of Rials 25 per 500 grans to the commercial price of about Rials 55. On the ‘black* front authority in the shape of the Road Guards won a round at Lirawi when a large dhow load of barley, wheat, carpets, rice, and ghi was seized before it could' start for Kuwait. But this was quickly Countered by a daring combination of pilfering and smuggling on the part oddly enough of four employees of the Bushire Health Depart ment. Over three nights 130 bags of wheat and 16 boxes of tea were removed from lighters passing between ship and shore and successfully smuggled ashore at a quiet place about a mile south of the Customs jetty* The Chief of Police got late wind of the incident but in any case responded though somewhat reluctantly to a douceur of 200 tomans. The smugglers were then able to maintain a fairly adequate balance of trade by sending out without hindrance some fifty carpets to Kuwait. Local Affairs . A petition inspired doubtless by Mr.Khalil Dashty. President of the Chamber of Commerce and leading merchant was signed by some two hundred local merchants and shop keepers and sent to the Majlis with the usual flourish of copies to the Prijpe Minist ex', the Minister of the Interior, and Aqa Shahrulla Safavi, 3ditor of Kusiah and Deputy for Bushire. The petition complained and demanded redress of the local scarcity of foodstuffs, medicines, and water and the continuance of the town without electri-'~-3- kxt 4175 consequence of the breakdown of the plant. The increasing nakedness of the people and the rising death rate (doubtful assertions in view of the increased prosperity of the town which has however been offset by rising prices) were painted indire colours with a view no doubt to sounding the reputedly limitless depths of the Shah's own purse# Aqa Grhiathi, lately Manager of the Cloth Monopoly, whose accounts concealed until recently a deficit of Rials 20,000, has been ordered to pay this sum back in convenient instal ments this apparently being the limit of firm action which it is fitting to take in an atmosphere of licensed 'huqabazi* frowned on only if unsuccessful# This friendly example of corruption on the 'never, never' must be comforting to his fellow Government officials. The Commission deputed to take a census of the popula tion of Bushire finished its labours and arrived at a figure of 20,000 for the area within six kilometres of the town# The figure is probably exaggeraled and was collected by a hand ful of clerks proceeding allegedly from house to house. There is reason to believe that these betrayed no uncharacteristic Jtfc thoroughness in their activities and were not unaxious to please certain merchants seeking to prove that the present bread issue is too meagre and anxious to obtain for Bushire a larger share of sugar imports. The officials themselves may have wished to see that the claims of Fare for sugar supplies did not at least lack paper support. Real though the difficul ties of the economic situation may be it is a pity that demands for food supplies to be imported by us appear not infrequently to be based on figures of doubtful accuracy inspired by seif interest and the huckstering spirit of the Bast . sd.

Cannon, Garrison Engineer, left for Shiraz on the 20th May. (4) Captain A. Dow arrived from Basra to relieve Captain J.K. Wilson* 115. (h) American officials. Captain H.M. Wilson has arrived to relieve Captain E. Icke. 116. (c) Persian officials. (i) Dr. Earned Siadat returned to Bushire on the 16th May. He had tried, without success, to get transferred from Bushire to another post in the interior of Persia. His suggestions for new equipment for the local hospital were also unsuccessful. (ii) Sargurd Yusuf Isfandiari, Officer Commanding the Amnieh Guards, Bushire, returned to Bushire from Bandar DLlum on the 16th May. He proceeded to Khormuj in company with Sarhang Pur-i-Rastigar, Chief of Amnieh, Ears, on the 17 th. Sarhang Pur-i-Rastigar returned to Bushire on the 17th May, and proceeded to Shiraz* (iii) Sargurd Yusuf Nuri, Officer Commanding the Garrison, Bushire, with seme 40 conscripts left for Ganawah en route for Dllum on the 28th May to reinforce the road guards and auxiliary riflemen there. 117. II. EXCHANGE AND FINANCE. The market rate of exchange is q.uoted as Rials 11.75 to the Rupee hut there is no demand for foreign currency* It will take some time to appreciate the effect of the recent orders fixing the Sterling rate at Rials 128-130&lt;&gt; The position regarding gold remains unchanged. 118. III. MEDICAL AND QUARANTINE. (a) Smallpox having broken out in Dashti, the Health authorities here have sent one doctor and a vaccinator to carry out vaccination in Dashtij The disease is reported to have caused great mortality in Kaki, 65 miles south east of Bushire inland, and its neighbourhood. (b) The Health and Quarantine Department have received fresh credits to enable them to repair the old Quarantine / StationIA /VI. 119. 12 0 . - 2 • Station on Abbassak Island, and also to send the Quarantine Tende r the Ibn-i-Sina 1 for repairs. IV. COMMUNICATIONS . (i) On the 28th May Satwan Muvaththagi of the Persian Civil Air Service arrived here and has started repairs to the landing ground to have it in readiness for an air postal service which the Persian Government are said to be expecting to start shortly between Bushire and Tehran. No definite date, however, has been given by the Persian postal authorities, when the service will begin; but they hope that it will open in one or two months. V. LOCAL AFFAIRS . (a) The distribution of sugar ration cards was sus pended during the first week of May on the grounds that Mr. Ismail S a fai, Director of Distribution, had issued a great number of coupons against fictitious Census Certi ficates in consideration for bribes. AQai Rukmeddin Ahmadi, Director of Revenue, Pars, promised to depute Inspectors of the Economics Department in Shiraz to visit Bushire and take a correct census of the population and* then issue the people with six months* rations 6f sugar. This premise was not fulfilled for nearly 22 days during which over two thirds of the population did not draw any sugar from the Economics Department and had to ourchase their requirements at Rials 64 per maund (8 lbs). A commission of 5 officials headed by Mr. Sad©- qizadeh of the Economics Department, Shiraz arrived here on the 27th May and began to issue a Census Questionnaire as a preliminary to issuing sugar ration cards. At the end of May they had issued a few dards. (b) The bread situation has become worse to some extent as poor persons continue to flock into the town from out side areas. The Governor has instituted a Commission,* which intends to build a new bakery to serve as a model. The Residency Assistant Engineer’s services have been lent to advise and assis t. (c) At a meeting of the Commission held at the Governor- ate a resolution for the control of the price of rice was adopted. A local merchant, who has received a hundred bags of rice from Shiraz, agreed to sell them a t a price admitting of his getting 10# profit, and no more. It was also arranged that further consignments of rice should be brought from Shiraz for sale at reasonable prices, in order to compete with profiteers. This may also result in a reduction of the consumption of wha* wheat by th e richer classes thus helping the poorer classes to obtain their bread requirements with less difficulty. Meanwhile, the Economics Department, vushire. has received 400 bags of rice, part of a consignment to 200 tons for sale at Bushire'and districts, sent by the Economics Department, Isfahan. (d^ As a result of complaints made against the Governor of Bushire by the local merchants, a news item appeared in a Tehran newspaper that the Government intended relieving Aqai Mir Ali Zahir. The Governor, however, on making enquiries on the subject, received assurances from his son (who is in the Ministry of Interior) and also from the Governor General of Pars,’that there was no intention of his being transferred.131. 123. 123. VI. LOCUSTS. (a) The Agriculture Department, Shiraz, have com pleted a campaign against locusts in a district lying between Tang-i-Ham and Shabankareh to the east of Bushire. Their officials reported that swarms of the pest exist between Kazerun and Konartakhteh: and that some swarms had been observed in Firuzabad district and others had gone from Behbehan towards Shiraz. These swarms are said to be under observation. (b) The Commission of 12 Bussian officials operating against locusts in the area of Bandar BtLlum were reported to have finished their work and to have returned to Khuzistan by plane. VII. TRIBAL AND POLITICAL. ( a ) I&amp;shti. (i) During the period under report the Persian Groverament troops at Khormuj, commanded by Sargurd Arab Shaibani, with the assistance of Sargurd Yusuf Isfandiari of the Amnieh, advanced upon the Dashti rebels centred on Kaki, and have driven them to the hills with hardly any opposition. The force had been raised to about 700, with auxiliary riflemen, lorries and two tanks. After capturing Kaki, the force advanced to Ab-Dan. A small force was sent round to Kangan by sea, acecmpanied by Sheikh Suleiman of the A1 Hamadi tribe (who has apparently succeeded in bribing his way to the Bakshdarship of Kangan) with the object of taking the rebels in the rear, and in particula r of seizing the stronghold of the chief rebel, Ali Ismail, at Daiyir. { (ii) At the close of the period under report, it seems that resistance has ceased, and several of the Dashti leaders are negotiating for terms of surren der. These include Khalu Hussain and his brother, Bahmiar, of Bardeh Khan. Ali Ismail and Haidar Maidar, with some minor leaders, are refusing to come to terms. Ali Ismail appears to have left his men at Daiyir, and himself fled to Callehzani, 12 miles north of Bandar Daiyir. (iii) 5t-is-pep«?ted The opportunist Rais Ghulam Bazmi, who has figured in previous reports, is now reported to be negotiating between the G-overnment force and the temporarily discomfited Dashti leaders. (iv) It is reported that the Government troops were welcomed by most of the population of Kaki, who had suffered from the depredations of the rebels, notably the female Khan of Kaki, Mulki Khan, who had lost all her stocks of wheat and barley. The price of dates in Dashti is reported to have risen to Bials 20 (from an ordinary price of about 4) a maund (8 lb.), and destitution is rife. The position has been reported direct to Tehran by Mirza Ahmed of Daiyir (son of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company agent ' there, whose premises were looted by the Dashtis last year), to the great annoyance of the Bushire Economic Department, who are seeking for their own ends to minimise the needs of jff! Bus hire’s dependent areas. (b) The Down Gulf Ports. (i) A pleasant story comes from Junah and Ishkenan, in the hinterla nd of Lingah. A ruffian named Mukhtar bin Haji Ibrahim had gone to Junah, where he disarmed the Amnieh post, and was subsequently dislodged by Government troops, in his absence, his father Haji Ibrahim Kharrehi bribed a certain Abdur Bahim to kill Zari Ahmed, the Chiefbeiom ,3\J kh*m 124 . 4 of Ishkenan, fixing a rendezvous for that part of the pay ment which was to he made after the joh had 'been done. Ahdur Rahim went and stayed as the guest of his intended victim, and somehow allowed the story of the plot to leak out. Zair Ahmed, with the encouragement of Sheikh Ali, of the A1 Hamadi trihe, who also is living in ishkenan, then.] over-hrihed Ahdur Rahim to murder his former paymaster, Haji Ihrahim, instead. Ahdur Rahim then went to his rendezvous with Haji ihrahim, and killed him and one companion. Mukhtar, returning from his exploits at Junah, heard of his father’s murder; hut was unahle to catch Ahdur Rahim. He succeeded, however, in catching an uncle of Ahdur Rahim’s, named Kuchik Ali, and burned him alive. (ii ) At Bandar Shiu, the Amnieh were recently dis armed and the Customs' plundered. Shaikh Yasir hin Mazkur of the A1 Nasuri, dislodged the miscreants, and is now in occupation of the town. He is supposed to he preserving law and order there on hehalf of the Persian Government; hut a later report speaks of him as having given financial help to the Dashti rebels. (His present un official position obviously depends on the maintenance of insecurity). (iii) Shaikh Yusuf --who was formerly the Chief of Bandar Chiru, hut was displaced by Shaikh Abdul Rahman hin Abdullah, who had the support of the A1 Hamadi Sheikhs -- has gone to Lingah to complain to the Bakhshdar about his removal. He does not appear to have a chieved any result; and no result is likely to he achieved while the A1 Hamadi family holds its present position. (iv) A gangster named Shaikh Mohamed of Lavar has been giving trouble near Mahtabi and Bandar Khamir. It is reported that he killed the Amnieh N.C.O* at the latter place and disarmed the guards; he is also reported to have plundered the mail courier on three occasions at Been (48 miles north of Idngah.). At Been also he robbed a caravan which was carrying dates and flour from Lingah for the relief of distress in Lar. (v) Abdullah bin Hindi (last heard of as a smuggler of arms from Qatar, and previously as a gunman for the Sheikh of Qatar at the time of the Zubareh incident with Bahrain) is now reported to have taken to highway robbery in the distric^t of Bandar Asalu. He is being opposed by Shaikh Abdur Rasul, Chief of Asalu, who has been the Government agent for security there since the Amnieh were driven out, last year. (c) Elat Baud and the Up Gulf Ports. (i) Since the expulsion of the Boir Ahmedis from Bandar Bilum, their captured leader, Kabutar, has died of wounds. Quli Khan of Lirawi, who had assisted Kabutar, was induced by fathullah Khan, Hiat Baudi to surrender on Patullah’s undertaking to endeavour to get his punishment mitigated, and is still in prison. Some retributive activity by the Boir Ahmedi against Bandar Rig and Ganawah was reported; but it does not appear to have been anything serious. Pathullah Khan has been given 40 more rifles, to help him to maintain security.5 * (ii) In Lirawl, an agreement has 'been reached between Mohammed All Khan (see paragraph IX(v) of my report for 15th April) and the Hiat Daud Khans. The essentials of this are the restoration by Mohammed Ali to the children of the late Aqa Khan of the property and money which he took at the time of his raid on Hissar; that he should follow the advice of the Hiat Daud Khans, and should vacate Hissar in 6 months* time. It remains to be seen whether the agreement will be honoured. It is understood that Mohammed Ali Khan co operated in the expulsion of the Boir Ahmedis from Bandar HI urn. VIII. SKIPPING Aim CQMW/anTAT,. 125. (a) Five steamers called at Bushire during the period under report, and discharged tea, bran, piece goods and general cargo to a total of 245 tons. Exports were of local produce, including 64 tons of assifoetida and 10 tons of tobacco. (b) Trade has been dull as merchants were awaiting the decision of the G-overnment about the excha nge con-'' vention. Little or no business could be done with up- country places, as all available lorries were either commandeered by the Police to send wheat to Shiraz, or by the Army for troop movements. United Kingdom Commcerial Corporation^ recent decision to transport wheat to Shiraz will free the commercial ma rket to some extent.. (c) Sugar rose at one time to Bials 2250 per bag but declined to Rials 1850 owing to the factors mentioned in the preaeding paragraph. Government stocks amount to 3880 tons, and commercial stocks to about 700 tons. V j; Tea rose to Rials 55 per packet, and declined to Rials 51. Stocks amount to 1544 tons. Sd. J.B. Howes.

Pilferage of lorry parts has been practically nil, although there has been pilferage of the cargoes of goods for FiUssia?bringing them ashore. The local authorities some what understandably apt to view any diversion of foodstuffs from Russia to Persia as laudable rather than the reverse. Sale of lorry cases have been advertised at Rls.800 per ton. 71. TRIBAL AND POLITICAL* Bandar Dilum* During the fortnight a raid was made on _ Bandar Dilum 'Ey Boir Ahmadis under Kabutar, one of their chief leaders in such exploits* The Customs were attacked and some cash removed; the records are also reported to have been burnt. Sarwan Isfandiari, Chief of the Amnieh, took troops from Bushire with auxiliary riflemen from the Hiat Daud area, and restored order in the town, capturing Kabutar (who is reported to have died of wounds) and about 10 others. *t is understood that tne Governor General has recommended Pathullah Khan, Hiat Daud, for a medal; and Sarwan Isfandiari has recommended himself for promotion to Sargurd. (ii) Daahti. The Persian forces at KhormuJ have been reinforced by some “S55 men and two tanks. The officer appointed in charge of operations by the Governor General on the occasion of his recent visit to Bushire, Sargurd Arab Shaibani, has moved to the scene of action, and is said to be awaiting the return of Sarwan Isfandiari from Dilum before attacking the rebels. There are, meanwhile, some indications that the rebels may not wait to be attacked, the more so as Rais Ali Chapiri at Ahram • in the rea^r of the Khormuj position - seems to oe in contin ual correspondence with them. There have, however, been reports of bickerings among the Dashti leaders themselves, some being prompted ty jealousy of Ali a* Ismail's recent rich haul from a wrecked Kuwaiti dhow. Another dispute has arisen from tie revival of an old blood fued between the Saidi brothers, Ibrahim Khan and Ahmed Khan*.with Shaikh Ghulam Hussein of Ab- dan; and yet another by a claim of Mxa Haidar 'Maidai 4 * ^ ^ £ree use of Lavar and Kabgan creek for his boats, these places being claimed by two other Dashtis, Zair Ghulam Haidari and Haji Ali Zair Mohd.Ali. ^ _ It is, however, doubtful whether these petty disputes would produce any real internal division,whenever the regular troops may make a threat to the Dashtis* general freedom to quarrel with each other. VI. SHIPPING and gommbrcial . 113. (l} Three ships called at Bushire during the period under&gt; report* Two were U.s.A.shipa with cargoes of lorries, tinned meat and sugar for Russia; one of them exported 90 tons of opium. The third ship brought 15 tons of tea and 37 tons of sugar, and exported 20 tons of tobacco. (ii) The price of sugar has risen from Rla.1850 to Rls.2200 per bag. It is reported that a 40 tone of sugar were recently imported from Dubai by dhow, the ejqport permit from India / having-3- having bean obtained for Djibai; and two other license a for Dubai have been issued, the consignments being eventually destined for Buahire 0 Government stocks amount to 4,500 tons and commercial stocks to 150 tons* (iii) Tea has risen from Rls.44 to Rls.50 per packet* Stocks amount to 1400 tons* ad* J •B.Howes* Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

Brigadier General Muhammad Hussain Firuz, Officer Commanding the Army Division, and Governor General of Fars, in Shiraz, arrived at Bushire on the 19th April and left Bushire for Shiraz on the 22nd. He exchanged calls with His Majesty f s Consul, and a number of questions were discussed. The Governor General also gave an interview to local merchants and discussed with them the bread situation in Bushi^e. He was accompanied by Mr- Rokn-ud-Din Ahaadi, Director of the Revenue Department in Shiraz, and Major Arab Shaibani• II FINANCE AND EXCHANGE. (i) There is no denand for foreign currency, and the bazaar rate of exchange is about Rials 11.50 to the Rupee* (ii) The priceo f gold remains the same, but it is difficult to buy more than ten misqals of gold. III HEALTH AHD QUARANTINE Nothing of any importance to report during the period. IV LOCUSTS : Reference para VI of my last summary: the Indian entomologists left for Isfahan on 22nd April* V ECONOMIC * (i) Increasing distress was reported from Persian Gulf ports and particularly in Daiyir, where a number of the inhabitants havedied from starvation. A m erchant of the port sent a telegraphic report, which the Governor of Bushire supported, to the Persian' Government requesting for relief measured to be taken* Mr« H*B* Sinclair, who was about to sail for Iranian down ports, loaded a quantity of dates for distribution # among the poor of Daiyir. Many poor people from the surrounding districts have crowded into Bushire in hope of food*102. (iii) The misappropriations of sugar by the Economics Department are reobrtecl to amount to 55,000 kilos. The Director of Distribution has been removed and the distribu tion of rationed sugar stopped by Aqai Ahimdi, Director of Economics, Ears. The populace are therefore having to buy commercial sugar at something over double price. IX. ASSEMBLY OF LORRIES EOH RUSSIA (i) Assembly by Messrs. U.K.C.C. recommenced during the period under report. During the interval since the last batch of lorries were received here, the layout of the assembly yard had been revised^ and the Consulate had been consulted with a view to improving the security arrangements Most of the Tangistanis previously employed have now been dismissed, and guards recruited through the medium of Khans whose fsiilies had a good record in the last war. Launch patrols between the ships and the port have also been introduced. 104. (ii) A total of 80 Russian drivers arrived in Bushire:^ and at the close of the period under report, one convoy had left, with a leavening of Russians among its drivers. X. PUBLIC 0PI1TI0N AMD PROPAGANDA: 105. In general, feelings are fairly friendly towards the British, as people here can see at first-hand the import or foodstuffs to Persia, and the assembly of lorries has increased employment. Criticism is more particularly directed at the laziness and venality of the Governor, tne misappropriations of the Economics Department, and the injustice of the conscription officers. Sd. J.B.

(i) The position regarding shortage of currency has somewhat improved. This is due partly to the re-issue by the Banks of old and soiled currency notes which had been withdrawn from circulation and partly to the temporary lull in the activities of the United kingdom Commercial Corporation.

The culprits were bound and delivered to the Chief of Police. YI YIlhdTCI. .L There is a severe dearth of currency in Bushire at present All or any one of the following reasons may have contributed to this state of affairs; (a) Bad banking i.e. the failure of the Bank-i-Killie to transfer unv/anted currency to places where it is more in demand, negligence to take steps to replace soiled currency notes with drawn from circulation by new notes; (b) wartime activities whereby drivers etc. earn about three times their normal wages. While there is no appreciable change in their standard of living, these people do not deposit their extra money in the bank but keep it on their person or in their houses. Until such time as they are forced to fall back on their hoardings the money so accumulated does not circulate. ( c ) presence in The demand of more local currency brought about by Iran of the British and Russian forces. Yor are There is no demand at present for foreign currency, one thing the merchants say that they are unable to export or import anything like the normal quantity for v/ant of shipping space. further even those people who require foreign exchange v/aiting to buy it in the hope that there will shortly be a drop in the rate of exchange in favour of the Rial.

The .-imnieh have not found it necessary to post any men on the road from Ganawah to Gach oaran. It is now three months since there have been any holdups in the plain section of the road, the 30 odd miles of which is in Hiat Dc.ud territory* (b) Wheat was very scarce and its cost very high. Large numbers of men had left the villages in sea±ch of work at Bushire. Heaps of bones of dead animals killed by the drought and food shortage were frequently found by the wayside* However the general con dition of the people in these t owns seemed good. They are great fisheaters and there is no shortage of fish* (c) 'Reports were received of arms smuggling but no confirmation of*this was obtained. Inquiries were made into the report of the discovery of a* number of hidden arms at Hissar* Ho confirmation of the details of this could be obtained without going to the spot but it seems certain that some arms v/ere discovered by Mohammad Khan Liravi. The ♦discovery’ was made at the same time as the incident of Mohammad ikLi’s ’attack’ on Hiss-r reported in this Consulate Diary for December (para 115). it v/as con firmed by the Vice Consul that the substance of the events was a family quarrel between Mohammad ^v.li Khan liravi, brother of the dead owner of estates at Hissar, and Ahmad Shah, guardian of the minor sons who receives the support of the Hiat Jaud family. .-,s yet the Hiat Bauds and *dimad Shah have made no attempt to dis lodge Mohammad Ali from Hissar in Sjjite of having received 50 rifles from Shiraz and the blessing of the Bushire local author ities for the project. ^ngali Aamad, possession of the hie Khan of ^ngali, who estates by the late was allowed to remain in Shah, though curtailed of his /EXT 3535 ! 74. hiL privileges, has been trying to re-aesert hil-claim to the island of Shif, north of Bushire, which formerly belonged to the ^ngali estate.

The battalion has also been relieved by another which, not being composed of local men, may put up a better display. Captain Isfandiari (see para 63(c)) was at the end of the r&gt; e riod under report in Shiraz, where he intended to ask that the command of operations in Dashti should be made an Lmnieh responsibility, the array detachment acting under hit orders. (b) Haider Haider, one of the rebel leaders, made a plundering raid on the village of Buneh Oarazi (about 8 miles west of Khorrauj) in the exercise of a tribal feud with the headman of the village. (c) Ali Ismail, the principal rebel, has had a rich haul in the shape of the cargo of a dhow which was recently -wrecked near laiyir. It is hoped to obtain the name of the dhow and its owner in a few days. (d) ^ Rais Ghulam Razmi (see para.VIII(b)(i) of last report), evidently scenting a renewal of hostilities with the change of troops and leadership, is reported to have withdrawn to Deh-Rud (some 50 miles east of Bushire, in the hills; and well away from Khormuj ~nd the scene of operations).

Local Officials. Reference paragraph No.5 of diary for January 1942. Aqai Qaim-Muqami, the Revenue Inspector, returned to Shiraz on the 26th February. III. Russian Mission. On the 24th February a Russian Mission arrived here. M. Zoren headed the Mission and he was accompanied by M. Sharpoff (of the Soviet Foreign Trade Department), M. Chorostoshevsky (Engineer) and Mademoiselle Rymena as his * English Interpreter. A few days later a party of about 100 men, soldiers and lorry drivers, arrived and took charge of some of the lorries assembled by U.K.C.C., which they drove off to Tehran. IV. CONSCRIPTION. The Conscription Officer posted a Notice in the town summoning some 600 youths who are due for military service to report themselves on the 1 st day of the Iranian New Year, viz., the 21st March 1942, when recruiting will be taken up. Forty youths, breadwinners of their families, who had been putting in four months military service at the military barracks here were disbanded by the military authorities, who have been instructed to cease recruiting youths of this class as they have since been exempted from the service. The authorities, however, would not divulge the order with a view to having a pretext for summoning such youths and disbanding them after a short time on suitable consideration being offered. /42. ThreeThree conscript deserters were traced in the districts and brought back to Bushire. The authorities of the Road Guard Department Bushire had been planning to re-man their posts in Dashti, Tangistan and in the Persian Gulf ports. The present insecurity of the districts and the ports, however, precludes them from doing so. V. DISARMAMENT. CAl^AIGN. Reference paragraph/of diary for January 1942. The troops at Khormuj were re-inforced by a batch of 96 men in two lorries who also carried provisions and munitions for them. By the end of February Lieut.-Colonel Ahenin had made no progress in disarming of the tribesmen in Dashti and Tangistan. In one instance he lost two of his cavalrymen who had tried to arrest a robber. This incident gave the Colonel a pretext for surrounding peasants' house and removing their valuables when making searches for arms. The peasantry now find themselves between the upper and the milestone. Ouk the one hand they have the malcontents at large who constantly threaten t.^em v/ith plunder while the army molests them in guise of a protector. VI. HEALTH OF BU3HIRS TOV/N AND HINTERLAND. During the period under reference malaria very appreciably decreased but many a case of pneumonia and bronchitis were f! - reported. Mortality was few. * * Reference paragraph No.116 of diary for December 1941. Smallpox ceased to exist in Bushire and suburbs. The Health officials who had been sent to the hinterland and the down, ports returning to Bushire reported that the contagion had caused the loss of 3000 lives in Kangan (110 miles south of Bushire on the coast) and district. VII. BUSHIRE dHIRAZ ROAD. The last lorry of a convoy of the United Kingdom Commercia] Corporation's lorries bound for Tehran was fired on near Kazerun; the driver was wounded and superficial damage causedto the car. A member of the Amnieh who happened to be taking a lift in the lorry, jumped out and returned fire. Blood marks found on the guard next morning showed that his fire had not been without effect. On the following morning a bus containing Amnieh, military and Police personnels was fired on near Kimarij. One of the Amnieh guards was killed and another severely wounded; and the others slightly wounded. The Road Chiriks from the Kazerun area are still unpaid though it is reported that the Ustandar has received authorit to pay them. Previous reports of the presence of numerous Germans in the hills now appear to be incorrect. The source of these rumours ^s a single man, whose personal appearance has been described by a reporter. He was apparently found wandering near Jirah, unable to give a satisfactory account of himself except that he wanted to see Nassir Khan. He was robbed of his clothes and his money, and was for a time kept at a village near Jirah, where he was employed on repairing rifles It is reported that about a week ago Nassir Khan sent for him to be brought under arrest to Farrashband. His clothes had not, however, been returned. It is understood that Elias Khan, Kalantar (headman) of the Qashqais recently visited a Political Officer of the Anglo-Iranian uj.1 ^o. , Ltd. , at aach—Saran. The object may have been to obtain food supplies. VIII. LOCUSTS. The pest did not exist in the district. A party of Iranian officers representing the Agricultural Department in Shiraz came to inspect areas visited by the locust. They were able to visit only a small part of these places. Dashti and the Iranian down ports they could not visit for the prevailing insecurity. They reported that the pest did not /lay eggs/ - 4 - lay eggs except in a small stretch of land somewhere about Daliki and that they have prepared the necessary poisoned stuffs to feed and destroy its young when it puts in an appearance.

The Hobble Lieut .-Colonel W.R.Hay, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and H.B.M.'s Consul-General, Bushire, returned to headquarters on the 11th January and left for Tehran on the 20th January. He returned to head quarters again on the 31st January. II. LOCAL OFFICIALS . 2 # Mr.Asas Bakhtari, the new Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Bushire, arrived here from Tehran on the 5th January and took over charge of his duties from Mr.Abbas Ali Slahshoor who reverted to the post of Postmaster of Bushire• 3. Mr .Mir Ali Zahir, the ex-Governor of Bushire who left for Tehran in October 1941 when he was replaced by a Military Governor, returned on the 12th January and took over charge of the Governorate from Captain Abdullah Mujab, the Commissioner of Police, who reverted to his own post. 4 . Mr.Abdul Aziz Qotb, the new President of the Law Court, Bqshire, arrived from Ahwaz on the 24th January and took over charge of the Law Court from Jalal-ud-Din Firuz who sailed for Bandar Abbas on the 26th. Mr.Abdul Aziz was the Public Prosecutor of Bushire two years ago. He is a man of about 38 years and is the son of Khan Bahadur Muhammad Shariff Awazi. 6 . Mr.Qayam-Muqami, an Inspector of the Ministry of Finance,Tehran, arrived here on the 22nd January. He is a member of a Commission sent to Shiraz to inspect the worktag of the Iranian Government offices there and in Bushire. III. DEVELOPMENT OF THE PORT . | 6 . On the 15th January information was received concerning the shipment of 1700 lorries expected to arrive in Bushire / early‘early in February• At the same time Mr. B. Monck, a representative of the Ministry of War Transport in Basra accompanied by Captain D. Whyte arrived in Bushire to make preparations for the discharge of the ships concerned. The lorries are to be assembled by the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation and since the ability of the port to handle these shipments depends largely on the speed with which the lorries are assembled arrangements are being made to expand the existing U.K.C.C. assembly plant to the limits of its capacity. IV. RUSbIM INTERESTS . On 4th January Mr.Alexander Beljaev, Secretary in charge of the Russian Consulate at Bushire, committed suicide, as a result of a somewhat sordid Intrigue with the Swiss wife of the Persian Medical Officer of Health. Pending the arrival of a representative from the Russian Embassy at Tehran the Consulate was closed and placed under the combined seal of the British Consulate and the Department of Justice at Bushire. The Police who were at first not satisfied that the cause of death was in fact shicide seemed inclined to bring a murder charge against Mr.Beljaev's widow. No action was however taken before Madam Beljaev left for Tehran with representatives of the Soviet Embassy. V. IRANIAN MILITARY . Conscription . During January 60 conscripts some of whom had completed 4 months and others only a few days military service at the barracks were discharged. Recruits are now coming forward more readily for enlistment in the Road Guard Department under the new rates of pay. As a further attraction they have been issued with khaki uniform to replace the old familiar, and much hated, blue. It is proposed that these recruits should in due course relieve the road guard detachments at Dilam, Bandar Rig, Ganawah and other southern ports.VI. TRIBAL DISARMAMENT . 9. On the 21st January a military force supported by armoured cars and artillery arrived at Khormuj to commence operations against Dashti Chiefs whose activities have recently caused the authorities much concern. The force which is under the command of Colonel Ahenin was met at Khormuj by the Governor of Bushire and before any active measures were taken messages were sent to the principal Chiefs summoning them to come to Khormuj to discuss terms. Contrary to general expectations a number of Chiefs obeyed the summons and by the end of the month it appeared likely that the force would complete its mission without much bloodshed. k VII. CONDITIONS IN THE HINTERLAND.DABHTI AND TANGISTAI . 10. Tangiatan . Until the arrival of the military force at Khormuj security conditions remained bad and numerous complaints were heard against the exactions of Rais Ali Chahpiri who had hitherto been given some support by the Amnieh as a person likely to be of assistance in maintaining law and order. 11. Dashti . Security conditions showed improvement during the month due largely to the presence of Rais Ali Ismail who established himself at Daiyir and maintains in good control a following of some 200 men. 12. Ganawah &amp; Bandar Rig . The Iranian military authorities in Shiraz have lately appointed Fathulla Khan Hiat- Daudi to maintain law and order in Hiat Daud (which includes Ganawah and Bandar Rig), Rud Hilleh and in Liravi. They have given him some 100 rifles and ammunition for the k purpose and promised the help of the Road Guard Garrison in Ganawah should he have occasion to require outside assistance• estate after 8 years* banishment to Shiraz.ftushire Town, The Polite authorities were able to ' arrest one of the two persons involved in a ‘case of murder which took place in December 1941« Out of a dozen or more petty thefts and burglaries only in one or two cases were the culprits arrested and the townspeople are beginning to suspect that the head of the Security Department who has amassed considerable wealth during his period of office in Bushire, is working in conjunction with the thieves. 14. Reinforcement of Police Force on the Bushire- Shirzz In October 1941, when Reza Shah Pehlevi abdicated, all Police Control posts on the Bushire-Shiraz road were abolished. These orders have lately been rescinded and the old system whereby travellers must check in and out of police posts at various points on the road has been re introduced. VIII. THE ECONOMIC SITUATION . 15. Bushire has been badly hit by the almost complete lack of rain which, following so closely the meagre falls of last year, is causing considerable anxiety not only for the crops which must in any case be poor but glso for live stock, much of which will have to be slaughtered unless good rains come before the hot weather. In the town of Bushire a shortage of drinking water is anticipated and during the last two months, which in normal years should have been the best, the price of it has doubled. X. LOCUSTS. 16. Swarms of locusts have been observed in the direction of Khormuj, Ahram, Dehrud and Firuzabad. Large swarms have also been seen recently in the districts of Borazjun, Dalaki and Kanar Takhteh. road . sd. B. Howes. Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

Aqai Ansari, the head of the Security Office, Bushire, has been suspended from duty. It is reported that he was found to have been helping thieves and would not return stolen articles to their owners. A new man named Ahmadipur has come from Yezd to relieve Ansari. This man was sent from Bushire to Yezd about 5 years ago for his corruption. II. SECURITY FOSITION. A caravan coming frora Tang-i-Ram which is about 58 miles northeast of Bushire inland was attacked by robbers consisting of Qashqai Turks and the people of Deh Rud, 57 miles east of Bushire inland, and were robbed of carpets, ghee, and sheep. Ten of the robbers were armed and the rest had cudgels. The Arnnieh authorities and the Officer in charge of the Borazjun garrison sent a few men to pursue the robbers; but they did the work half heartedly and the robbers made good their escape. Another gang of robbers plundered a small caravan carrying dates for Shabankareh; when pursued by Amnieh guards from Borazjun, they were helped by the people of Shabankareh to escape arrest. The headman of village Jetoo, in Shabankareh district, arrested two other robbers and handed them over to the Amnieh authorities, as being those who robbed the caravan. In these two cases property assessed at Rials 20,000 was stolen. A third party of villagers of Giskan, the mountain east of Borazjun, were robbed of sheep, ghee and carpets to the value of about 8,000 Rials. The military and Amnieh authorities did nothing to restore their property.

Tang-i-Ram (vide paragraph 3). a small gang of robbers of Borazjun attacked a lorry carrying sugar and wheat for Shiraz and killed a road guard and a rifleman who were on the vehicle. Captain Isfandiari, the officer in charge of the road guards at Bushire, who had gone to Borazjun in connection with the other robberies, has been successful in arresting the culprits, and has brought them to Bushire. It is reliably reported that Lieutenant-Colonel Ahenin has so far made no appreciable progress in the disarming of the tribesmen in Dashti and Tangistan. He did not follow the advice of Rais Ghulam Razmi to arrest Haidar son of Muhma ad Haidar, the headman of Ea^ih Ahmadan (38 miles south east of Bushire) when he had the opportunity to do so. Haidar therefore collected his villagers and carried all his own and his villagers* property away to the neighbouring mountains. The Colonel had at first demanded the restoration of 70 rifles and the payment of Rials 40,000 which he alleged that Haidar had taken from the Amnieh guards in Dashti and the Custom House, Lavar (a port some 50 miles south of Bushire). Haidar stated in reply to the Colonel*s demand that he took only 15 rifles from the guards, that he would hand over 5 of them and the 10 he would surrender after other chiefs had been disarmed. Haidar has now probably between 70 to 80 men with him. Ali Ismail, Ibrahim Khan of Abdan (72 miles south east of Bushire inland) Zair Abdul Ali Koneri, Khalu Husain of Barda Khan (70 miles south of Bushire near the coast) have all combined and collected about 400 men armed with rifles and sent them to Kaki (65 miles south east of Bushire) to resist Lieutenant-Colonel Ahenin should he press for the surrender of their arms. ^.li Ismail himself has gone to Daiyir(a port about 105 miles south of Bushire).25 • 26. 27. Alasir Khan son of 3oulat-u£-Doulah 9 the qashqai* is in touch with Aii Xoioail, and recently requested him to go ower to F iruzabad Isome 106 miles soutii east of BushireJ. All aeclined to do this 9 but friendly relations between the two on lei’s continue. According to reliable information JNasi^ Khan is har bouring several Germans. It is also reported that a Lieutenant of troops now in Khormuj ha &gt; stated that ftasir Khan some 20 or 25 days ago amoashed some Iranian soldiers at a gorge oaxled Tangah- i-Aub (shown as Tang-Ab on the map t some 115 miles south east of Bushire* a few miles below i’eruzabad;, killed many of tiiem ana took their rifles ana 4 machine guns. Kajim Khan ^ash- qai did this for him. He is bow estimated to have 300 men in his service. During the last \ eek 3 lorries carrying merchandise from Bushire for Uhiraz were attacked between l aserun and Shiraz by robbers. The drivers were robbed oi their mamy money and beaten because they were carrying tilings which were not light and valuable. The drivers say that the culprits are Kazeruni riflemen. The headiaan of Drazi (a village some 36 miles south east of BushireJ was asked to instruct his men to serve as road guards; otherwise he was required to return 10 rifles which had been lent to him. This was to ensure that he did not use ? vd'aiKSiJi them against the troops in Khormuj. The headman returned the rifles saying that he wanted them for the protection of himself and his villagers; and that they will not serve as road guards. These petty Chiefs probably hold private firearms which they would bring out for fighting their rivals, as soon as tuey receive Government rifles, which woulu serve f£r a mask for their own.^.h.6 director ol trie Revenue department iiere l^ias received a confidential report from hie Revenue Officer in Khormuj 1 which confirms the report in paragraph 23 above.

The dij.i orent chiefs ol Dashti end ^ngiotan have all combined to light the troops il they try to use force for disarming them. They have posted men at Kaki and other places for this purpose* One reporter has stated that Colonel Ahenin, finding the chief s tj be too strong for hin, has asked higher authorities n -hiraz to cend him more troops. There are reports of disaffection in Colonel Ahenin’s own staff.i- 4 - HI. ECONOMIC SITUATION 28 The officials in charge of the (iovernraent shop at ho razjan are reported to be misappropriating sugar, tea and matches given them for sale at horazjan and selling them for their owi profit# The poor and the lower classes there can get none of these articles. The Deputy liovemor at ho razjan is said to be in partnership with the Economics officials. As a result the Economics authorities at Bu- shire are expected shortly to enforce the rationing system at Borazjan. 29. The authorities in charge of the irrigation Dam at Aaedahad (about 30 miles north east of BushireJ have lately completed five water channels for irrigation purposes and made them available for use by the peasantry. Those of the haadabad peasants who had taken wheat from the Economics Department on loan have sown their fields, also others who had the seed. 30. The bakeries in the town are always crowded, end many of the poorer classes are unable to obtain bread. The Director of the Economics Department is reported to have been receiving strict instructions from the Ministry of finance to be sparing with his supplies of wheat to the Jj'athullah Khan Hiat Daudi arrested Abdur Rasul, the headman of Kharg island, with the object of regaining the administration of the island, which was, until the banish ment of the Khan’s father and grand-father, their property. bakeries.

This, together with the removal of Agah Mohamed Ismail ,i T'awabi, the head of tne municipality, who was both corrupt and pro-German, had a good effect, but the rise in the cost of living caused general disappointment. Firmer broadcasts from Tehran against Axis propaganda would be welcomed. On November 1st,5 Russians arrived in Bushire with the object of reopening the Russian Consulate there.

MOVEMENTS . Bri ti sh OfTic i als . On tile 24th October the Hon'ble Lieut.-Colonel C.C.Prior, C.I.E., PoliticaL Resident in the Per sian Gulf and H # B«M* # s Consul General, Bushire, left Bushire for Delhi where he handed over charge of the Residency to Lieut.-Colonel W.R.Hay, C.I.E., on November 1st. On the 2 n cl October Captain A.C.Stewart, Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and H.B.M. *3 Consul, Bushire, proceeded to Ahwaz en route for Khorramshahr and Kuwait. He returned to'headauarters on the 9th October. Mr.R.I.Hallows, Under Secretary to the Poli tical Resident in the Persian Gulf, arrived here on the 13 th October and sailed for Bahrain in company with the Political Resident on the 24th. II. LOCAL GOVERNMENT . The timely arrival, at the beginning of Octo ber, of 1000 tons wheat shipped on account of the U.K.C.C, averted what might have been a serious wheat shortage and had an excellent if temporary propaganda effect. Dissatisfaction is new being expressed at the manner in which the election of Deputies to the Majlis has hitherto been conducted and fairly broad hints have been thrown out that provided L.M.’s Consul would give his blessing a demand for a new election would be made. ConaLdera'ble local interest has been displayed in a lit)el charge brought by Agah Mohamed Ismail / Nawabi43. 44. 45. NawaM the head of the municipality, against Agah Shakih the chief interpreter of the Imperial Bank of Iran who published an article in the local press drawing the attention of the Governor to a number of outstandirg examples of profiteerirg among shop keepers. Though no names were mentioned Agah Nawab, v/ho in consideration of bribes received had undoubt edly contributed to this profiteering, at once brought a case against Shakib and had him placed under tem porary arrest. After a number of telegraphic com plaints had been made to the Ministry of Interior and to the Bushire representatives of the Majlis the case was concluded early in November by the re- moval of Hawaii. His dismissal has had a most en- couraging ef] ect since apart from being corrupt he was notoriously pro-German. On 26 th October the new Shah’s birthday was celebrated with a reception at the Governor ate. The celebration followed the normal course and passed of.i without unusual incident except for a brief men tion in the Governor’s speech of Iran soon binding herself as an ally of Great Britain. Ill. ibamian military . Desertions among conscripts continue and since deserters generally take their arms with them it is delctom now that outlying posts are left in possession of arms overnight. in spite of constant reports of reinforcements oem 3 on their way from Shiran the strength of the Bushire garrison has remained approximately the same / throughouthisvt ro -3- throughout the month. Troops from Shiraz have however 'been sent to outlying stations in Dashti. 46. During the crisis in A.ugust it was reported that gun positions had 'been established on the aerodrome. HoM. *s Oonsul has now had an oppor tunity to examine these guns, he is no artillery expert but it is qpiite apparent that they are at least 50 years old and it is most unlikely that they would have been able to fire even a single shot. IV. NAVAL . 47. H.M.A.S. Yarra called at Dushire on 24 th October and left again on the same day. V. MOVSHENTS Of FOELI GHEES . 48. On the 29th October a European subject who first declared he was an Austrian journalist named Carl Heller arrived at Bushire and came to the 49. L (JLJt**** ^ * Consulate for help. Later he declared that he was a Bussian Military Officer who had deserted, for political reasons, from the force which entered Iran in August. There is good reason to believe that he is in fact a Bussian. His story is how ever being investigated and in the meantine he is being kept in the Consulate under close watch. On November 1st a party of five Russians arrived at Bushire and called at the British Con sulate. They stated that the object of their visit was to reopen the Russian Consulate prepara tory to the arrival of a Russian Consul whose appointment would shortly be announced.^ Three of them including one journalist of the Tass agency left Bushire for Ahwaz via Canoweh and / Hindian |jf. t*. Kt cofctt/ 54. The fourth as ^ mm HinrJlan on November 9 nl # The fourth together with his wife remained in Bushire. During the brief period of their visit they toured the town making searching enauiries regarding the amount of materials, especially ammunition, shipped or expected to be shipped, through Bushire for Bussia* They also appear to pay particular interest in road and rail communications in South lersia. VI. Tx&amp;Di2 • Business has been generally slack partly owing to lack of security on the Bushire-Shiraz road and partly due to a hesitancy on the part of the merchants to commit:.' themselves before the precise conditions of certain reported trade re forms are known. A number of lorries have been collected at Bushire and it is expected that materials for Bussia will shortly commence to pass through. The output of the Etemadia Mills at Bushire has been considerably curtailed owing to the difficulty of receiving regular supplies of raw cotton. VII. QONDITIQNS IN THE HINTEBLAND, DASHTI tanoisJan. ~ ' Traffic on the Bushire-Shiraz road has been subjected to constant interruptions by a series of highway robberies in which a number of motor drivers and passengers have sustained injury. In spite of militaiy assistance the efforts of the road guard authorities to put an end to these robberies have met with little success.-» 55. 56. -5- In Octo'ber reports of ohaoti prevailing in Tehran encouraged tribal chiefs to embark on a series of retaliatory raids against the road guard authorities stationed in outlying posts against whom they have many longstanding grievances. G-overnment officials still manage to maintain a measure of authority in the town. Conditions in the district are generally so bad that any communication between one town- and another is ren dered impossible. On the whole the attitude of the tribal chiefs seems to be that while they are Quite prepared to put up ?/ith the G-overnment they will not tolerate a continuance in authority of the road guards 0 By the end of the month there were signs that the trouble in Dashti may shortly spread to Dashtistan. 7111 • PUBLIC OPINION AND BBClAqAkLDA . The gradual increase in the cost of living since the occupation has caused general disappoint* ment and is giving rise to unpleasant speculation ' as to whether Iran would not after all have been better under the Shah. G-erman broadcasts stating that since the occupation restrictions have been placed on the use of radio sets in Iran gave rise to some in terest and Question as to why Tehran made no de nial.

Towards the end of the month there was a shortage of sugar. I iiivents in Tehran and the occupied areas have so far had little repercussion in Bushire though an improvement in trade conditions is anxiously ejected© HI. IRA1TIAIT MILITARY . There have been almost daily reports of conscripts / deserting 23tr i r - deserting many taking their arms with them, in one instance a party of 8 men, who deserted with a machine gun, is reported to have inflicted severe casualties on a detachment sent in pursuit of them. 24.

Some forty or fifty sailors who had collected at Bushire after the operations in Khorramshahr have now been discharged, it is understood that only a limited number of long service men will be retained to look after the lights and buoys, all others being paid off. 26. Two ex-naval motor dhows have been handed over to the Customs authorities for use in preventative work against smugglers. But the Customs authorities appear to have received no orders to resume the work of patrol and the boats are lying idle, if this state of affairs continues smuggling will increase still further. V.

They had not been released by the end of the month in spite of representations made on their behalf to Tehran. Apart from a party of German prisoners who passed through Borazjun under military escort en route for Ahwaz no other Germans have been reported in this district. VI. TRAPS . 28.

Moreover, apart from the possibility of materials for Russia passing through Bushire there is some hope that with Khorramshahr and Bandar Shahpur fully engaged by the British,trade for the interior of Iran, v/hich bad hitherto passed through these ports, will be diverted to Bushire. VII. grgBITI OKS III IKE D ASHTI T.^. The situation in Dashti is far from satisfactory and almost daily reports have been received of highway robberies which in some cases resulted in travellers being killed. Traffic on the Bushire-Shiraz road has on several occasions been seriously interfered v/ith by the necessity to restrict movements of cars and lorries to the hours of daylight. Even with these restrictions in force a number of hold-ups have been reported. Two important Bashti tribal leaders have sent messages to the Consulate stating that they wish to become British subjects and are prepared, if supplied with arms, to take over the whole of Dashti and Tangis- tan for the British. Their message and the reply given have been separately reported. VIII. C CMEU1TI CAT I Ob'S . Nil. IX. REACTIONS TO ALLIED ACTION IN IRAN . The atmosphere at present is one of hope.

On the 19th August Dr.Ghai, Health and Quarantine Officer, Bushire, left for Shiraz en route to Tehran. His successor, Dr.Siadat, arrived at Bushire on the 24th August. Ill♦ IRANIAN MILITARY . In spite of r^umours of impending war the chief ^ / preoccupationpreoccupation of the military during the early part of the month was the settlement of a scandal, brought about through disclosures of the appallingly corrupt manner in which the conscript department had been carrying out its duties. The matter was eventually settled by the dismissal of the principle conscription officer and three of his sub ordinates* During the period 20th„21st August there were conflicting rumours of changes in the strength of the garrison. Some troops did in fact leave Bushire being replaced by fresh troops from Shiraz but the actual strength of the garrison remained approximately the same . IV. IRANIAN NAVY . ho units of the Persian havy visited Bushire during the month. The news of the death of Admiral Bayendor, which was brought to Bushire by a naval dhow from Ahorramshahr, caused general regret in Bushire where he was regarded as one of the best officers in the service of the Shah. V. MOVEMENTS OF FOREIGNERS . Nil. VI. TRAPS . Throughout the month there was a scarcity of wheat and supplies to bakeries were limited, with the result, that many of the poorer classes were unable to obtain bread of any kind for days on end. A separate report is being sutmitted under this head. Vtf. CONPITIONS IN THE HINTERLAND,PASKTI AND TANGISTAN . Dashti and Tangistan . These two districts remained / unsafeunsafe during August. Solitary travellers, motor cars and caravans were attacked and plundered. Road guards particularly were given no rest and were harrassed to such a degree that in many districts they refused to leave their posts depending on local charity for their food and water supplies. At least four guards were killed and their arms carried away. 13. Bushire Town. A few cases of theft and burglary were reported during August and property wo^fch some Rials 8000/- removed from shops and houses. An attempt was made in [broad daylight to rob a peon of the Sugar and Tea Oompaitiy when he was carrying money to the national lank of Iran. 1 4 . Bushire-Shiras Road . 8 lorries carrying merchandise were plundered at Daliki, 4i miles north east of Bushire. A few days later a number of taxis and lorries were held up at Dasht-i-Arjan, on this occasion 12 persons were killed or wounded. Other reports have been received of single cars being held up and for the last half of the month the road was regarded as definitely unsafe for travelling at night, even in the day time security was considered to be not too good • VIII. CCMMUNICATIONS . Coxamuni cat ions between Bushire and Kazeroon were interrupted for two days when a large section of the tele- phone wire was cut and removed bb a place close to Boras- jun. IX. REACTION TO ALLIED ACTION IN IRAN . l6# News 0 f the Allied advance into Iran, broadcast from Tehran, was received v/ith unexpected calm in i^ushiie though it was confidenti*Aly expected, and in some /quarters-4- quarters even hoped, that it would be followed by an early landing by the British. 17. The military garrison under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Malik Nasiri had some days before posted detachments of troops at intervals along the coast stretching from Hillelah to Bushire,(three of these posts were quartered in villages surrounding the Sabzabad Residency), but since no instructions indicating the manner in which they were to treat British subjects were received until 36 hours after our troops had first entered Iran they took no steps to interfere with their movements. British subjects were however informed that if they wished to do so they could tske shelter in the Consulate. None availed themselves of this offer, and though, in view of the close proximity of military detachments to the Residency, special steps were taken to provide for the security of official documents, the situation did not then or subsequent ly appear to call for their concentration and business was carried on in the normal manner, a close watch being maintained to ensure the earliest possible information should anyone be molested. The instructions finally received by the local authorities were to the effect that affairs were to take their normal course and the fact that an endeavour to preserve such conditions had already been made eased considerably the feeling ot tension which had earlier been caused through the expectancy of a British landing at Bushire. Only on one night, when it was rumoured that four British warships were lying off Bushire, did this feeling of tension approach alarm. On this occasion the garrison took up pre-arranged positions ready to resist a landing and a night, passed in the thought tnat they might possibly be brought under fire from British guns, resulted in a temporary but definite hardening of feeling against the British. Once it was learnt that resistance had ceased, / howeverhowever, this phase passed and even known pro-Axis enthusiasts changed their politics over night and became (*tZJ pro-British* sd. A.C.Stewart.

Tehran radio, the irrigation dam which is being constructed on the river Shahpur at village Saadabad in Shahankareh, will be completed and ready for irrigation purposes early this autumn. The Iranian engineers on the spot are reported to have reported on the feasibility of utilising the Shapur falls for developing electricity to supply Shabankareh, Bushire, Borazjun and Kazerun. The Governor A. of Bushire is^strong supporter of the scheme and the Central Government are expected to convey sanction for a start on this hydro-electric undertaking. 272. Election of Bushire Deputies to the Ma.jlis » the Majlis will expire in July.

It is believed that this temporary transfer of the department is a preliminary step to its early amalgamation with the Revenue Department. Municipal . t 277* The monthly income of the Municipality, Bushire, from octroi and other sources has decfeased considerably. In June it amounted to Rials 30,000-3- expenditure. The authorities are doubtful if the Municipality of Tehran will make up the deficit, and have therefore to carry on with an inadequate income for some time* III. IRANIAN 278. The military authorities disbanded some ^00 conscripts who had fini^ged two years* military service, sent 53 old conscripts to Khorramshahr for a month*s refresher course, and summoned 70 others for a similar course to Bushire. Recruitment for replacing the disbanded conscripts will begin from the 31st July. 279* Lieutenant Colonel Malik Nasri has visited the Bushire districts, Kharg Island, and, in plain clothes, certain parts of the district between Kazerun and Behbenan and Shiraz. The latter trip is believed to have been connected with recent depredations committed by tribesmen and outlaws. IV. IRANIAN NAVY. 280. The Iranian sloop M Babr w visited Bushire during June. She is reported to have landed a party of Iranian, military officers on Iranian islands to study their strategic importance. 281. The gunboat •Shalirokh** was reported to have carried out some exercises offthe Kharg Island where ( she landed anti-aircraft guns for practise and removed them when she sailed for Khorramshahr. This boat, however, did not call at Bushire during her cruises in June. V. MOVRMdlNTS OK FORglOhKRS. 282. 283. Nil. VI. TRADR . Under instructions from Tehran, the authorities of the Economic Department, Bushire, increased their prices /4 - 284 285 286. prices for imitation silk fabrics by 50$ and that of tea by 44$. The authorities expect that further § increase in the prices of Government monopoly goods will be iriade in the near future, in order, it is said, to raise the State’s income by one hundred million Rials. . In May Bushire merchants were called upon to sub scribe Rials 4,000,000 capital for a Provision Company, o,y tne for.mtion ol which the Government hope to be able to retrench half the staff of the leal Department of Economics. Owing, it is said, to the removal of the guiding hand (or propelling boot) of Amir Khosrovi, late Minister of Finance, the Company is now being formed with a capital of Rials 1,500,000. VII. PUBLIC QPIRIQhh lixe news of the German attack on Russia was received with joy by all as it was considered to end the threat of a combined attack by them on Abadan or on India through Iran. No thoughts of the ending of Iranian trade with Germany in the event of a Russian victory, or of the inevitable embroilment of Iran in tne war m the event of a German victory, have apparent^ yet occurred to mar the public pleasure. Reference paragraph 263. Consternation has been caused by the institution of enquiries by the police in the matter of the Governor’s indiscreet reference to Germany. Fortunately xor him no police officer was present at the time,and the memory of such persons as the police have questioned is proving uniformly bad. The Governor, in his search for a Judas, enquired by round-about channels i or tne Consula te-General whether the latter was responsible for reporting the matter to Tehran .’ vm. broadcas ts./288. 287. * XI1 * ii'iQAPC.ur\&gt; .

The announcement that the sale and purchase of Barley and tea had become a Government monopoly gave rise to rumours of many other impending monopolies. A rumour in April that the control of the discharge of steamers at the Port of Bushire hitherto carried out by shipping agents might be transferred to Iranbar, with consequent decrease of efficiency and increase of charges ) was partially confirmed in May when a contract was given for the supply of coolfies for loading and unloading, and by the end of the month the shipping agencies were complaining of difficulties in discharging cargoes. Three Greek ships with large cargoes of wheat and flour arrived at Bushire at the beginning of May. Only one ship was allowed to unload 1600 tons at Bushire, the balance being sent to BandarShahpur and other ports. Early the same month a Japanese ship unloading at Bushire left suddenly without completing discharge. A second ship which was due to arrive at Bushire a few days later turned in the Gulf and went back to India. It is/is reported that no more Japanese ships will go to the Gulf until the end of the war. While the news of the withdrawal from Greece tended to confirm the local view that the British troops were not able to hold up the Germans, the news from Crete was overshadowed by the disturbance in Iraq. Anti-British broadcasts from Baghdad were creating strong feeling against Britain but the collapse of Rashid Ali and the subsequent reassuring broadcasts did much to restore British prestige. The position locally seems to be that the people would welcome any change from their present Government and do not much mind through whom the change comes, though they would naturally prefer that it should be the winning side. The contracts of two of the employees of the htaraadieh Mills are expiring. One of them has been succeeded, not by a German as was feared, but by a Czecho-Slovak from Ispahan who is said to be very pro-British. The Manager of the Mills is said to be in correspondence with German firms regarding the supply of new weaving and electric plants. Two Germans, believed to be employees of the cigarette factory in Tehran.and two Italians, employed on the construction of the dam at Shahbantareh, the work of which is nearing completion, visited Bushire during April. Lt.Col. Malik Nasiri, recently appointed military officer in charge of Dashti and Tangistan, took up his headquarters at Bushire on the 31st May. He appears to have some sort of control over the other Departments and his first act was to institute enquiries as to the position and past history of the Office^ of the Consulate- General. There has been a gradual improvement in the condition of security on the roads in the outlying districts, though incidents are still reported. It is reported that the Persian sloop, Babr, has been conv eying a party of 25 Staff Officers to assess the importance, for defence purposes, of the smaller ports along the Persian coast. There were rumours of troop movements from Shira* to Bushire. A number of very well presentred^nagazines, written in as well as German, with illustrations and news-propaganda articles were received by various merchants during April. Reception of broadcasts, both from Delhi and from London, has been very good. It is felt, however, that the 8 o*clock news from Delhi follows too closely on the B.B.C. Persian news. It is suggested that the time should be altered to 9*30 (Persian time).

Work on the construction of the Shahbankareh dam is nearing completion and attention has now been turned to the cementing of canals and water channels. 252. Iranbar have not yet taken over full control of Bushire port facilities. A contract has however been given for the supply of coolies for loading and unloading ships and shipping agents are already complaining of the difficulties they experience in discharging cargo. 253. Three Greek ships carrying large cargoes nf wheat and flour arrived at Bushire at the beginning of May. Though the local authorities were anxious to discharge as much as possible of their cargoes only one ship was permitted to unload 1600 tons at Bushire, the balance being sent to Bandar Shahpur and other ports. III. MILITA RY. 254. Lieut .-Colonel Malik JMasiri who was recently appointed military officer in charge of Dashti and Tangistan took up his headquarters at Bushire on 3ist May. His position, in relation to other government departments, is not well defined but it is clear that / hehe has some sort of control over them, and the navy Depart- sent, which has hitherto regarded itself as separate and I above all local government, suffered a rude shock when they attempted to treat him with the same disrespect they show to other officials* 255# Colonel Nasiri’s first act was to set on foot enquiries as to the position and past history of officers of this Consulate-General• 256* It is reported that the Persian Sloop •babr' has been conveying a party of 25 staff officers on a tour of the Persian Coast, the object of the tour being to assess the importance, from the point of view of defence, of the smaller ports along the coast* 257* Rumours of considerable troop movements from Shiraz to Bushire were current during the month, nothing has so far come of them but it is believed that 200 or 300 men have { been transferred from Shiraz to Dashti with a view to pressing forward the disarmament campaign. IV. NAVY . 256. The Persian Sloop 'Babr' called at Bushire twice during the month. V. MOVEMENTS OP PORBIGNBRS . 259. Gottlieb, a Czechoslovakian from Ispahan, has arrived at Bushire to take over from one of the English employees of the Etamadieh Mills, he is reported to be thoroughly pro-British in sentiment and saw much of the British community in Ispahan. VI. TRADE AND DBVELOBESNTS . 260. The Turkish firm of Vanderzee who are believed to be agents for Ford Motors have recently made enquiries regard ing the possibility of shipping cargo for Turkey in transit through Bushire for Tabriz and thence to Trebizond. The Bushire Chamber of Commerce are interesting themselves in the enquiries. / , / ^oi.261 . 262 . 263. 264 • I The Manager of the Etamadieh Cotton Mills at hushire JL is reported to be in correspondence vith German firms regarding the supply of new weaving and electric plants for the Mill. Til. PUBLIC OPBriON . Considerable interest was aroused in the Iraq disturbances and though the Police took special measures to ensure that discussions and criticisms should be reduced to a minimum there is no doubt that Broadcasts from Bagdad were creating a fairly strong anti-British reaction. The sudden collapse of Rashid Ali*s government, however, following swiftly on reassuring broadcasts from Bagdad, did much to convince people that Bagdad had paid singularly little attention to the truth in its earlier news bulletin and the position has now returned to normal. Iraq news fortunately tended to distract attention from Crete, proof however that German successes there have not altogether passed unnoticed was given by the Governor, who, when speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the new Town Electric Supply publicly held up Germany as an example of the success which attends unity within a country* The audience, on the whole, resented this reference to a belligerent State. This is the first time the Governor, who recently acted as a third party in the transmission of an anonymous gift of Tomans ICO/- to the British Red Cross Society, has shown himself as anything but pro*britieh in sentiment. VIII. BROADCASTS. m i « ■■■ Reception was good throughout the month and the increased number of broadcasts being given from both Delhi and London have been welcomed, it is generally / felt19 41 felt however that the 8 ©•clock news from Belhi fellowe too closely on the B.B.C.

He is said to be a particularly good speaker and has been making a propaganda tour of the country. It has been announced that the sale and purchase f of barley and tea has become a monopoly of the Government• Rumours are current that the sale of woollen goods, ironware, paper and medicines will also be monopolised in the near future. Shipping agents are greatly concerned by a report that the control of loading and unloading steamers at the port of Bushire will shortly be handed over to Iranbar. Hitherto this work has been carried out by the shipping agents themselves and they greatly fear that if iranbar gets control there will not only be a loss in efficiency with consequent delays but also a great increase in the charges for I transporting goods fran the jetty to ships, since ! the outer anchorage is some 7 miles away from the Customs House.

Meyer Fngeno and Newman Balila, two Italian engineers employed by the Iranian Government on the construction of the dam at Shahbankareh, visited Bushire twice during the month, on each occasion they returned the same day after buying stores. The Italian Minister passed through Borazjun on 18/19th April on his way from Ahwaz to Shiraz, he spent two days at Borazjun, having his motor repaired, during which time he occupied himself sight-seeing. He is also believed to have spent one or two days at Gach Saran.

VI TRADE AND DEVELOPMENTSVII* PUBLIC OPINION. 243 244. 245. Although nobody is yet prepared to make an unbiased forecast of the final result of the war Greek campaign, where the news of the first attack caused considerably more gloom than the news of our withdrawal which had apparently been accepted as more or less inevitable from the beginning. That we will make a desperate effort to hold Egypt is also taken for granted and if we are pushed back any further on that front the effect on public opinion is likely to be more definite. At the moment the position seems to be, that while people are desperately tired of their own inefficient and corrupt administration, the war holds promise of a change, and nobody particular ly cares who brings about the change - German, Britain or Russia. They would welcome any of the three, but would prefer it to be the side v/hich is most likely to win the war. if we are forced to give more ground on the Egyptian front and the Germans are able to establish themselves in Ira«*, which at the end of the month was just coming j.nto the nev/s, they are likely to decide that they would prefer the Germans.

On the 27th March four members of the Majlis in Tehran came to Bushire for a short holiday. They were hospitably received but appeared to depress the merchant class by saying that they could hold no prospects of any immediate improvement in trade coalitions. During the course of their conversations they are said to have reported favourably on Britain*8 prospects of defeating Germany.

THE HINTERLAND, DASHTI AND TANGISTAN , Reports of robbery and murder on the roads and in the districts are received with increasing frequency and the authorities seem to be able to do little to cope with the situation. On 25th March four cars were held up on the Masheleh within 15 miles of bushire town and only 2 or 3 miles away from a police post. One of the drivers of the cars was wounded and the remainder lost money and clothing. On the same day two road guards were captured near Borazjun and not released until they had been thoroughly beaten up. XI. CCMMUNICATIONS . Nil. XU. MISCELLANEOUS . There are rumours that a Government Monopoly Company will shortly take over charge of the landing of cargo from steamers at Bushire. If there is /any-4- r EXT 3754 I 1941 any truth in this the British firm of Messrs, Gray, Mackenzie 8c Co .Ltd* will be badly hit and landing charges will increase con siderably.

CCNPITICWS OF THE HINTEP.IATO. DASHTX ASP TAKGTSTAg . 190 . Dsshti and rangieten continued to be in o disturbed state throughout January. A number of travellers and caravans were attacked and robbed, in one instance, a house in Deshti was broken into by robbers, the landlord and his son being killed the household goods carried away. An attack was also made on a party of eight road guards bringing contraband goods from down ports to Bushixe and resulted in the death of two road guards and the wounding of another. The contraband goods and the road guards* arms were captured# It is understood that the Central Government are taking a serious view of these disturbances and have ordered their immediate suppression. The local military authorities being authorised to use as many military conscripts (from the Bushire Garrison) as may be required for the purpose. So far, apart from arresting five of the followers of Ali Ismail, one of the chief instigators of the disturbances, the military authorities have done nothing* In the meantime All Ismail is reported t o be collecting arms to meet all emergencies. XI. CCMMJNICATI COTS . 191. Nothing further has been heard Of the project tc construct a railway from Bushire to Shiraz. The local authorities however take the view that, though the proposals were seriously intended, funds will not permit any active steps being taken to put the project into effect for a number of years. ; f92. Work, on repairs, has been started at the Borazjun end of the Mashileh section of the Bushire-Shiraz road. XII. MISCBLIANEOUS. l9 3. On the 7th January, the Education authorities at Bushire invited some 300 persons consisting of locel Government officisls, traders/-the charges against Aqai Xhakpur• 180.

He is arranging to carry out an inspection of the district as well as the town branches of the Land Registration Department® 181® On the 29th January, Aqai Mir Ali Zahir, the Governor of Bushire, went to Shabankareh to see the irrigation dam which is being built across the river Shahpur. III. MILITARY . 182. A detachment of the Bushire Garrison has been seen landing a number (about 50) cases containing single shells of about 4 H size and weight. The cases bore German markings and were landed from an Arab Dho w at the long disused jetty at Dastak Since it would have been a great deal easier to land them in the normal way, at the ordinary customs, or naval jetty in Bushire, it is assumed that the military authorities wished to observe as much secrecy as possible. IV. NAVY . 183. rhe 'Palang' visited Bushire in January. 184. On the 20th January the navigational lights which have for many years been suspended from the Consulate flagstaff were removed being no longer required since the Iranian Government has now constructed a lighthouse a short distance away from the Consulate* V. MOVEMENTS OR ?QRi£IGNSRS . 185. Messrs Cross Meyer and Hermann Montejeberz, German subjects, arrived at Bushire from Shiraz on the 20th January. They stayed at the Hotel Iqtisad where they met Shaikh Rahim Mazkoori the clerk in charge of the office of Messrs Deutche Dampfschifffahrts-Gesellschaft Hansa, formerly known as the Hansa Lines Bremen, and set out for Shiraz en route for Tehran the next day/-dpy# They told the Police that they were Germ&amp;n merchants buying Iranian products. 186.

Further restrictions have been imposed on the sale of wheat which must now be mixed with at least 20^ of Per ley. The price has also been increased by 5^ . It is rumoured that the price of tea and sugar will also be raised, vn, PUB IT C CPI FT ON . 187. News of the further British successes in Africa has been well received. The defeat of the Italians however appears to have served principally to lower Italian prestige rather than to increase ours and it seems unlikely that any of the non partisan elements will change their attitude until we have taken on and ■ defeated German troops. In the meantime the uncertain attitude of Russia continues to cause uneasiness. VIII. BROADCASTS * 188. Critics of the Delhi broadcasts state that they do not appreciate the tone of the announcer which is toe similar to that of a preacher. On the whole they appear to prefer the ^.B.C. broadcasts. A further criticism is that the times of the Delhi and B.B.C. broadcasts are too close together and on occasions when the Delhi news finishes late it overlaps into the time for the B.B.C. broadcast. Listners must in consequence miss either the end of the Delhi or the beginning of the B.B.C. news. IX. PROPAGANDA . 189.
