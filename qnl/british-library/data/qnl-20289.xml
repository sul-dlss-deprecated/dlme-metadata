After Compliments, I beg to enclose herewith the statement of Mutlaq bin Abdullah, who is a Kuwait tribesman, and request once again, that you will kindly take up the question of the 'Iraqi cars which are still wandering about our territory of Kuwait without the least thought of consequences, and with apparently no attempt on the part of the T Iraq G-ovemment to stop them. I am in truth anxious and afraid lest their unchecked rounding up and meddling with the tribes will create a dangerous situation.

I was camped with my family at Hauma, north west of the Li^ilu On Tuesday the 8th Safar 1353 (22 # 5.34) , I proceeded to the 'khabra' (a pool of rain water) to fetch our supply of water. As I arrived there, I noticed two large lorries coming towards me, one of which was equipped with machine guns and the other carried armed soldiers. They stepped where I was and asked me y/hether I had seen any smugglers. I replied in the negative. Two days earlier (20.5,34) they met my friend, 'Id bin Salih, who was grazing his flocks near the Liyah at a place west of the Idairi* al-Khillah, and asked him the same question, men he told them that he knew nothing about smugglers, they beat him very severely. He told me the whole story himself, when I saw him shortly afterwards, and begged me with pressure to report his story to G-ovemment, as he knew I was coming upto Town.CONFIDENTIAL.

I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to transmit to you, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a despatch from the Political Resident, Bushire, dated the 1st March, 1934, on the subject of Koweit-Iraq smuggling. I am, &amp;c. S. F. STEWART. Enclosure in No. 1. Political Resident, Bushire, to India Office. (Confidential.) Bushire, March 1, 1934. WITH reference to his Excellency the Ambassador's Bagdad despatch No. 96 dated the 15th February, 1934, which I received after the despatch of my express letter dated the 20th February, 1934, I have the honour to make the following comments :— 2. With regard to the first sentence of paragraph 2 of his Excellency's letter : There can be no doubt that the Koweitis are inveteiJ^P and daring smugglers, both by sea and land, and have themselves largeLjy™W)lame for the blockade which Ibn Saud maintains against them andfoiyl^P^getic preventive measures taken by the Persian and Iraqi G^p^BpjBl^^Tcannot admit that the Koweitis themselves are to blame for Ibn Saud's blockade, nor do I think that His Majesty's Government are of this opinion. However, this is something of a side issue to the present subject. 3. As far as Koweit-Iraq smuggling is concerned, the above-quoted state ment is, I venture to point out, not quite correct. The actual state of affairs, which has an important bearing on the question of smuggling, is given in some detail in paragraph 7 of my express letter referred to above, i.e., that, while the Koweitis are smugglers by sea, it is the Iraqis themselves who are smugglers by land, com posed of Iraqi tribesmen who visit Koweit and return to their own country with the smuggled goods. 4. With regard^ to the proposals of the Iraq Government—mentioned in paragraph 3 of his Excellency's letter. The one which concerns the tightening up of manifests has now been accepted in principle by the sheikh, and was dealt with at the conclusion of paragraph 7 and in paragraph 8 of my express letter referred to above. 5. With regard to the agenda mentioned in paragraph 5 of Sir Francis Humphrys's letter. Item [a) deals with the main cause of dispute between the two countries, i.e., smuggling, and if this can be solved, or even partially solved, the relations between the two Governments should improve, especially if item {d) —complaints—can be settled. Item (6). The settlement of boundaries of the territorial waters of Koweit and Iraq. This would seem to be a complicated matter of some importance, in which His Majesty's Government are presumably interested, and which I venture to suppose could hardly be settled locally without their views being previously ascertained. Item (c). On the land, as far as I know, no frontier incidents affecting Koweitis and Iraqis have occurred; such incidents have been confined to clashes between the Iraqi customs officials and Iraqi smugglers. 6. With regard to the reasons put forward in paragraph 11 of his Excellency the Anibassador's despatch to the effect that a conference such as the one on smuggling was of the type where the sheikh's representation should be undertaken [56 ee—2]by British officials. My objections to either Colonel Dickson or myself, or both, representing the sheikh at such a conference are based on consideration tor the interests of neither Koweit nor Iraq, but for those of His Majesty s Government. The latter have already a number of commitments of varying responsibility with regard to Koweit affairs. The date gardens, concerning which they gave a dehnite promise to the sheikh, is one; Ibn Sand's blockade, concerning which no actual promise was given, but certain hopes were held out, is another; the protection 01 the whole of the Koweit Principality— vide India Office despatch, dated the 1st February, 1934, to the Foreign Office—is a third; while oil interests represent a fourth. I do not imagine that His Majesty's Government, if they can avoid it, wish to take on their shoulders any further responsibilities with regard to Koweit. At present the Koweit-Iraq smuggling is not such a responsibility. His Majesty s Government have given promises to neither side, and if Koweit should suffer by lawful retaliatory measures on the part of the Iraq Government (see para graph 6 (2) of my express letter already quoted), His Majesty's Government are not affected, and the sheikh must take the consequences, of which he has had ample warning. The situation, therefore, seems to be one in which His Majesty s Government should, restrict their efforts to good offices, while themselves formally remaining in the background. I am strongly of opinion, therefore, that the sheikh, at any conference or talk, should be represented by his own representative, with Colonel Dickson or me, or both, present for purposes of advice, as put forward in my telegram (No. 85 of the 25th January, 1934) quoted by Sir Francis Humphrys. If, on the contrary. Colonel Dickson and I appear as actual repre sentatives of the sheikh, then it seems inevitable that His Majesty's Government will assume some direct and, in my opinion unnecessary, responsibility for the smuggling question, more especially if the conference at which we appear is in any way a failure. In other words, there is no need^—if I may put it that way,— for His Majesty's Government to pick the chestnuts out of the fire for the sheikh, and possibly burn their fingers in consequence. 7. I thmk it extremely unlikely that the sheikh will, for the present anyhow, agree to an;^™aference at Bagdad. If the two parties, therefore, cannot be brought togethSk^i formal conference, the only alternative is to proceed by informal conversOT^fc^i^mi^tii^arious points at issue stage by stage, and the first step in this directio^WHIiWno way commits the Iraq Government to any thing, is for an Iraqi customs official to visit Koweit for a discussion with the sheikh on the latter's offer to tighten up his manifest system. 8. To sum up : The smuggling which is prevalent from Koweit into Iraq is a source of loss and annoyance to the Iraq Government. This smuggling takes two forms : {a) by land, the actual smugglers being Iraqi tribesmen, who purchase their goods at Koweit and smuggle them into Iraq; and (&amp;) by sea, in which the Koweitis are themselves concerned as carriers. The Iraq Government have asked for the co-operation of the sheikh to check smuggling. The sheikh is within his legal rights to refuse co-operation, as the burden of checking smuggling rests on the country into which the smuggled goods are taken. On the other hand, if the sheikh does not co-operate, the Iraq Government have various legal methods, stopping the Koweit water-supply being one, with which they can retaliate. The Koweit-Iraq Conference, which was to have taken place recently in Bagdad, did not materialise owing to the sheikh's refusal to give proper authorisation to his representative. The sheikh has, however, agreed to tighten up his manifests which, if carried out in a way acceptable to the Iraq Government, should consider ably lessen (if it does not altogether stop) the smuggling by sea, and it is on the sea and not on the land that regrettable incidents have taken place by the action of Iraqi customs officials shooting Koweiti boatmen. The next step, therefore is for an Iraqi customs official, as suggested by the sheikh, to visit Koweit for discussion with the sheikh on the subject of manifests. With regard to Koweit being represented at any conference by British officials : this would, in my opinion tend to make His Majesty's Government directly responsible for the Koweit-Iraq smuggling question and Ihus unnecessarily add to their commitments.

You may also like to know that I passed on privately to Sievwright your suggestion that an Iraqi Customs official should visit Kuwait and have an informal talk with the Shaikh. I am afraid that Sievwright T s answer was a flat refusal. He explained that the Iraqis had taken the trouble to prepare for a conference here to settle the whole business and that at the last moment the Shaikh had 'ratted': in the circumstances the Iraqis do not feel like waiting upon him when it suits his convenience. Whilst I consider it regret table that nothing can 'be done on these lines to improve relations 'between Kuwait and Iraq, I cannot help sympathising to a certain extent with the attitude of the Iraqis. m o 'ur o C*. .

Situation has been considered here in the light of views expressed by you and Baghdad, ^t contains awkward possibilities and we are anxious to liquidate it satisfactorily as early as possible. While appreciating force of reasons for Shaikh to be represented by his Director of Customs, we cannot help feeling thaljhe may think his case would be prejudiced if his Director, presumably an Arab of no very high standing, had to deal direct, even with assistance of Resident or Political Agent, with Ambassador, European Customs experts and possibly members of Iraq Government, and that he would feel greater confidence and be more well disposed if we were to agree to Political Agent or yourself directly representing him with assistance of Director as local expert. Nor in x our view would this infringe facade policy since it would be entirely consistent with fact that Shaikh's engagements preclude direct dealings with Foreign Governments ( a restric tion which as you know we are anxious in future to intrepret still more strictly than in the past as regards Ibn Saud and which it is at least equally as important to interpret strictly vis a vis Iraq).

If Sievwright or other expert could visit Kuwait for preliminary discussion with Shaikh and yourself we would welcome this as most satisfactory course. If preliminary informal agreement can be reached at Kuwait this might later be formally confirmed, if necessary by conference at Bagdad at vvhich you or Political Agent would represent Shaikh. If, owing to objections of Iraq Govermnent, it is impossible for Sievwright to go to Kuwait, prospects of agreement would be in any case improved by preliminary discussion of quite informal character between British officials on both sides at Bagdad or Bushire. Any conference at Bagdad should, we consider, be confined to question of smuggling. We agree with you as to objection of its extension to questions such as territorial waters though it will be desirable if at all possible to take opportunity of reaching friendly settlement of recent dhow incidents. 3, You should arrange as soon as possible most convenient procedure on the lines of above in consultation with Baghdad, whom Foreign Office are asking to co-operate (see Foreign Office telegram 123 of July 10th repeated to you 28). / 7. -Secretary of State for India-53/54 Telegram JJL* Fran m .M * s Secretary of iitate for foreign Affairs, London• H.M'a Charge d*Affaires, ^agtidad. xo* 123 Repeated to political xiesident, ijushire. mo * 28* i)ated 10th received llth jTuly 1934. india Office telegram to iiuahire ^0.1716.

The Shaikh was inclined to be vague in the scheme he proposed to adopt to prevent sea smuggling into Iraq and airily declared he would insist on all goods exported to Iraq being manifested. I explained that something more than this was required and eventually obtained from the Shaikh his willingness to carry out the following measures:- !• That all concerned in Kuwait would be warned that no goods could be exported by sea without being manifested: persons found violating this order would be punished. 2. The Nakhuda of every boat sailing from Kuwait woul be given a spare copy of the manifest of the goods carried by him. On the ships return to Kuwait this manifest would have to be produced showing an endorsement by the Customs official of the port or ports of destination, certifying that the relevant goods had been duly landed at that port. 3 # The certified manifests ntfien surrendered on the ships return to Kuwait would be kept in the Customs Office and the information obtainable^' from them (i.e. quantities and destination of goods shipped from Kuwait) would be furnished to the Political Agent if required, for communication to the Iraq Government. Note^ Item 3 was suggested by me. The Shaikh was somewhat reluctant to agree to it. I think however that its inclusion in any scheme likely to be acceptable to the Iraq Government is necessary.

In view of the seriousness of the position and the desirability of putting an immediate stop to these violations of the Koweit frontier, I am to suggest that His Majesty's Representative, Bagdad should be asked to report at once by telegraph what further action has been taken by him since the British Embassy's note of 19th May to the Iraq. Ministry for Foreign Affairs and whether a reply has yet been received from the Iraq. Government to his representations# 2.

As pointed out by Colonel Dickson in paragraph 2 of his letter of 18th May, this is not the first occasion on which cases of the kind have been r eported.

After Compliments, We beg to infoim you that Nasir bin Fahhad and Murshid al-Buraihi, both tribesmen of Kuwait, left their party of Kuwait tribesmen camped at the Ra^iyeh (in Iraq territory) proceeding to Jahrah with six camels and their weapons♦ Coming to the vicinity of Sanam (mountain) on the 4th inst (August?) they were met by two (Iraqi) police cars whose occupants without any warning opened fire at thou. Nasir fell wounded and they both were arrested* Th^e wounded man was taken to hospital at Basra, while the other was handed over to the prison authorities; and their six camels were sold at Zubair. This action of the Iraqi policemen is very wild indeed; without any reason they fired at shepherds travelling on camels unloaded. Moreover, when Nasir was wounded and his com panion Murshid was arrested, the policemen started beating the latter mercilessly in order that he should say that it was he and his companion who first opened fire, and thus they would get themselves rid of this painful crine. Murshid, however, after fierce beating promised to say what they wanted, but when he was brought before the questioning authorities, he told the truth and what had befallen them at the hands of the said policemen and the torture they inflicted upon him to make him say that it was he and his companion who first fired. It is much distress ing and unfair, indeed, that innocent shepherds proceeding from their tribe be treated so badly by men belonging to a neighbouring brother State. Further/Further, we have now received a news that the wounded man has died in hospital. His brother and relatives have approached us with a complaint for their dead man and his camels sold at Zubair. Please, therefore, be so good as to refer the matter to the authorities concerned, so as to make them aware of the real facts, and in order that they should take the necessary action against the culprits and restore the camels looted.

He brought with him tentative proposals whioh the Shaikh had at last been induced to make with the object of restricting smuggling by sea , and these were discussed at an informal conference at the labassy, at whioh were present Golonel Fowle, Sir iCinahan cornwallis, Mr. Hogg and Mr.Sievwright, besides myself and First Secretary. The Shaikh's proposals are:- (1) A warning to be issued in Kuwait that no goods may be exported by sea without being manifested; persons found violating this order to be punished. (2) The nakuda of every boat sailing from Kuwait to be given a spare copy of the manifest of the goods carried by him. On return to Kuwait this manifest to be produced showing an endorsement to be made by the customs at the port or ports of destination certifying that the relevant goods had been duly landed at the port or ports specified. TheThe general upsliot of discussion in which Colonel Fowl© concurred, ^as that these proposals were inadequate and unacceptable for the following reason#:« (1) As smuggling by sea is but a small proportion ©f the total smuggling that goes on, the proposals only touch the fringe of the problem. Mo proposals can be regarded as satisfactory unless they make provision for dealing with smuggling by land as well as by sea. (2) In the absence of adequate supervision, the proposals are quite unworlsable. For instance, there is nothing to prevent goods other than those manifested, being placed on board, or two sets of manifests being obtained by the nakuda to be used as convenient to him* (3) Ho real progress will be made so long as the Shailch refuses to deal seriously with the A Iraqi proposals of 1932. These proposals CwrrffriI*$5 were, and still are for some form of joint customs control (with adequate safeguards to ensure the shaikh against pecuniary lose) similar to certain agreements at present in force amongst the Baltic states. The Iraqi Government regard this as the ideal solution but they recognise that it is a matter for formal conference between properly accredited representatives, and not one for informal talks between officials with no executive power. The Shaikh is naturally suspicious of anything even remotely resembling a customs union with Iraq and will probably not consent to nominate representatives to confer with the Iraqi Government unless he can be assured;- . . (a)** 3 (a) of the correctness of the Iraqi motiTes and (1)) that his sovereignty would be in no impaired. It iias finally agreed that, as regards (a) it would be well to endeavour to induce the Ixaqi Govern ment to send to Kuwait two highly placed and well -disposed Iraqis (not Customs or Police officials) to confer with the Shaikh and to try and persuade him that, in spite of recent events, he has nothing to fe^r, and nothing to lose, hy entering into a friendly conference with the Iraqi Government. The names of the present Mutasarrif at Basra and the Director-General of Foreign Affaire were proposed, and I will approach the Minister of Foreign Affairs on these lines. As regards ('b) it would 'be of great assistance to me if you could furnish me with information as to the working of the agreements between certain Baltic States mentioned above and possibly Belgium and Luxemburg. Discussion was conducted in a frank and friendly spirit, and the serious view taken by E.M.G. of the present position was made clear so as to ensure tha o regrettable frontier incidents should cease. X had invited the minister for foreign Affairs to be present but as he \^s already digommi and the hour was very late, 1 saw no useful purpose in pressing him to attend. He had no objection to this discussion which lost nothing by his absence.

P.Z. 4986/34. My dear Warner, I send you a note 'by Fowle of the informal / discussion on smuggling 'between Iraq and Koweit which took place at Baghdad on the 19th July. It is, I think, self-explanatory. 2. I might perhaps add (Fowle has not touched on this in the note) that in his view part of the reason for which the Iraq Government are anxious to place the burden of preventing smuggling across the Iraq land frontier on the Sheikh of Koweit is that their position in this area is very delicate, and that while a couple of armoured cars patrolling up and down the 'border would probahly effectively put a stop to smuggling, they are apprehensive of the local political consequences which might result from their having to fire on Iraqis. 3. As Fowle remarks, there seems little to 'be done, for the moment 'but to await the result of the informal conversations which are to take place with the Sheikh of Koweit. We here should, I think, be disposed entirely to share his views as to the Iraqi proposal for a unified customs administration. Yours ever, GILBERT LAITHWAITE. .F.A. Warner, Esq., Foreign Office. INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL. S.W.I. 31st July, 1934.P. Z.4986/34. Gonfidentlal . NOTE Lieutenant Colonel T«G.W« Powle, CBE t on Iraq i-Kuwaiti ftmgg 1 ing , On tiie I9th July, as arrangewhen I flew through Baghdad, I was present at an informal conference at t&amp;e Embassy, with Mr. Ogilvie Forhes in the Chair. There were also present Mr. Bateman of A K L the Emhassy, Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, Mr. Hogg, and Mr. Sievwright. I put the Sheikh's proposals before the meeting; a copy of these I have given to the India Office. /Copy sent to Foreign Office under p.Z.4891/34 on 25th Jul^Z The representative of the Iraqi Customs Department, Mr. Sievwright, however, practically declined to consider these proposals. What the Iraqi Government wanted, so he saia, was a unified Iraqi- Kuwaiti customs administration, the Iraqi Government being willing to guarantee the sheikh a certain sum as customs revenue. After a good deal of discussion it- was finally decided, rather against Mr. sievwright's opinion, since the last thing that he apparently wants is any friendly and informal arrangement between Iraq and Kuwait, that the Iraqi Government should send some trustworthy Iraqi official, not necessarily connected with the Customs Department, to Kuwait to have an informal and heart-to-heart talk with the sheikh. It was hoped that something concrete might result from this conversation. 2. . The Iraqi proposal for a unified customs administration is more or less new, though some of their previo-us suggestions have rather tended in this airectioht/direction. I dare say it would solve the problem from the Iraqi point of view, but from the point of view of and the Sheikh it should be looked upon with considerable suspicion, as from our point of view it would be extremely undesirable for the Iraqi Government to get any real administrative control in Kuwait. 3. The Sheikh's proposals undoubtedly represent a genuine offer to assist in stopping the smuggling by sea, and if these proposals do not go far enough it is up to the Iraqi customs autnorities to make further suggestions. Hov/ever, as has been stated above, the Iraqi Government have practically refused to discuss measures on the sea, but wish to put into force some scheme which will include both sea ana lana. I- pointed out to Mr. Sievwright at the meeting that it would be easier to move a step at a time and first fix up anti- smuggling measures by sea. However, my arguments were of little avail. He pointed out, which is true, that the amount of smuggling by sea was very small in comparison to that carried out on the land. 4. On the other hand, from H^M.G^s point of view, the sea is really the important sphere 9 as until the recent incursions of the Iraqi police, all the smuggling incidents which have occurred, the shooting up of Kuwaitis by Iraqi customs officials, have happened pn the sea, and if sea smuggling was stopped these incidents would, of course, cease also. 5. I think the only thing to do now is to mark time for the present and wait for the result of the informal conversation between the Iraqi official mentioned above and the Sheikh. INDIA' OFFICE. T.G.W* FOWLE. 31st July 1934.I' in 5888/66y/ i o /: J Record Qf i^^tlnp; Qn matt^B afreet,lii^ ^welt A meeting was held on the 8th June 1934 In r r. Renciel' b room to uiscuss the following imtterB:- (1) Kowelt-Iraq smuggling; (2) Ibn Baud's blockade of Koweit; (3) the question of direct corresponaence between Ibn Baud and the bheikh of Koweit. The following were present:- Mr. Rendel, ) Mr. Warner, Mr. Malcolm Mr. Warner, j Foreign Office Mr. Laithwaite.) T ... r ,^, 1 „„ Mr. -Croffibie. J India Oifxce. (1) Smuggling. ivr. Laithwaite opened the discussion by pointing out that the Iraqi grievance regarding the smuggling which takes place between Iraq and Koweit was at least 10 years old, but it had become acute since 1932. He went on to observe that the smuggling seemed to be carried on mainly by sea, (the goods being bought in Koweit), and mainly by Iraqis. So far as it took place by land it was again carried on by Iraqis and by migmtory tribesmen. Mr. Rendel . intervening, observed that colonel Dickson and His Majesty's jtobassy at Bagdad did not altogether agree on the latter point. Colonel Dickson had admitted a year or two ago that the tightening up of Persian regulations had in fact turned the attention of Koweiti smugglers from Persia to Iraq. Mr. Laithwaite suggested that for the purpose of the present discussion it ..... IS*'^ 2, It was pwhape unnecsssary to go into tiiis difference of opinion between the local authorities. e alluded to the varylns estinitos of the financial iraportance of the smuggling. An Iraqi estim .te put it at £60 t Q00 in 1932 but this muat certainly be excessive since Colonel Didcson had pointed out that the total imports into Koweit from all sources in th t ye u* did not exc ed 180, (XX), 'fuming to the problera of the action to be taken, he recalled the opinion of the Foreign Office that Koweit was not internationally obliged to prevent tiie Eraigglins into Ira;;, though it would hardly be in conformity with the attitude of a friendly state for Koweit flatly to refuse all co operation. In these circumatances it would be fair to expect Iraq to pay any expenses involved in raeaaures of suppression. e observed that certain Iraqi sugsestions for the suppression of the srnuogling would in fact have involved expense to Koweit. evertheless a satisfactory settlement of the question was desirable on general grounds .md in the interests of Koweit herself since Koweit was vulnerable in many ways. Both parties had r, rte su jsestions for liquidating the matter. A b Ions ago as May 1933 Lionel ■'owle had suggested a friendly 'Round Table' discussion at Koweit between a iustoms representative of the Iraqi*....''i ^ 3.

It would ■conflict with Ills Majesty's (IttfllTHlt'i 'fapade' policy in conductln-: relations sith the irab states of the 'iulf - tliis proposal had also broken dovm.

AIR MAIL 17th September, 1934. 41° v My dear Loch A / f.nf Your telegram No. 801 of the 17tlySeptember, 7th You will have seen from my telegram No. 25 of today that the Iraqis have decided not to send a Customs official and that the party will therefore consist of two persons only, namely: (1) Dr. Naji Beg al Asil, Director General of Foreign Affairs. (2) Tahsin Beg Ali, Mutasarrif of Basra. The former, whom we have consulted, says that neither takes precedence and that they wish to be regarded as equal members of an informal and friendly delegation. 2. The following history of Dr. Naji Beg is taken from our 'Personalities' report for last year: 'Bagdadi, born 1093. First became prominent in 1922 as 'semi official Hashimite representative in London. Continued to 'represent Hashimite interests in London until final conquest of 'the Hejaz by Ibn Saud. Dr. Naji then became destitute in Sng- 'land, and was deported to Iraq in October 1925. In Iraq he was 'soon employed under the Ministry of Defence in the Iraqi Medical 'Service. Appointed Iraqi Consul-General and Charg(§ d 1 Affaires 'in Jedda in August 1931. Returned to Bagdad in June 1932 to 'be present during the visit of the Amir Feisal, son of King Abdul 'Aziz-al-Saud. Appointed Consul, Mohammerah, October 1932. 'Acting Director-General in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs 'April 1933.' Despite his unfortunate experience in the United Kingdom, Dr. Naji has never shown any signs of being anti-British, and has, on LIKUTENANT-COLONEL G. LOCH, I.A., at Kuwait.I' 1 BRITISH EMBASSY 2 BAGDAD. on the contrary, been on particularly good terms with this Embassy throughout his career at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 3. Tahsin Beg Ali was one of King Peisal's officers in the War and has since held the post of Mutasarrif in various districts in Iraq with varying success. He went to Basra in November, 1933, and has been doing well. in particular, he has shown every desire to be on friendly terms with our Consul there. He went to Kuwait earlier this year, and Dickson re ported favourably on him and on the impression made by him on the bhaikh - in this connection see Fowle's despatch No. C/182 of the 7th April, 1934 (Kuwait No. C/114 of March 29th). /Telegram From To H.30 i/« His Majesty*s'^ecretary of State for India, London.

Subject. 4^ fit Informal Customs Conference at Kuwait.Note of an interview with His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as Subah, with Major Watts(Political Agent, Kuwait) present, on the 22nd September 1934, The occasion of this conversation was the Shaikh^s informal call on me on my arrival at Kuwait. As the discussions with the 'Iraqi representatives were to be quite informal, I had thought it best to make my own arrival private• 2. After the usual courtesies I said to the Shaikh that this call was an informal call of courtesy, but that I should like to take the opportunity of telling him that I had Just received a telegram from the Charge d'affaires at Baghdad saying that the 'Iraqi Government sincerely wished to do everything possible to reach an agreement with him, and that the Director General of Foreign Affairs was bringing some proposals to make to him. I explained that the two 'Iraqi officials who were coming were Dr.Naji Beg al Asil, the Director General of Foreign Affairs, and Tahsin Beg 'Ali, the Mutasarrif of Basrah, whom he already knew. I emphasised that the idea was to have an informal talk. The Shaikh at once said that he had not been consulted about their coming and that he did not want to talk business^ with any 'Iraqi official, though he was prepared to discuss matters with a British 'Iraqi Customs official if one came. 3. The Shaikh clearly thought that he was being 'rushed 1 , and asked by whom the arrangements had been made and whether it was His Majesty's Government or the 'Iraqi Government who had done this• I explained that after Colobel Fowle had been through Kuwait in July, he attended a meeting in Baghdad of the Charge d'Affaires and certain of the British 'Iraqi officials, and that they had decided that the best thing to do was to ask the 'Iraq Government to/~2- a \^ &gt; to send representatives to talk over things quite informally with the Shaikhj with the idea of getting to understand each other's point of view, and to see if some friendly settlement couldnot be reached. The Shaikh said that he had never agreed to this talk and again urged that he did not want to talk matters over with any 'Iraqi in Kuwait. I said that various attempts had been made to arrange dis cussions and they had unfortunately failedj and that I thought that it would look bad if he were to refuse to discuss matters with these two gentlemen (at the same time, I cannot help sympathising with him, as the matter is new to him and very sudden). 5. I said to the Shaikh that I was naturally not very familiar with all that had passed, as I had only read the case on files, but the impression made in my mind, as a new comer, was that it was desirable to do all that was possible to reach a friendly settlement. I said that the position seemed to me to be that Kuwait was an independent State and that there was of course no legal reason why he should help in the matter of smuggling, because it was the duty of any country which chose to impose heavy duties to prevent smuggling into their territory. On the other hand that 'Iraq had various means which were quite legal of bringing pressure to bear on Kuwait, such as water, vegetables, etc. The Shaikh said that he was under the protection of His Majesty's Government and that he looked to them to help him and that if they did not help, he knew of another arrangement which he could make (I took no notice of this: but I felt that some anti-'Iraq pact with Bin Sa'ud was indicated). I said that we had to get down to practical matters and that there were constant troubles between Kuwait and 'Iraq and that every effort should be made to reach a settlement agreeable to/-3- to both sides. The Shaikh reiterated that he did not want to discuss matters with the 'Iraqi representatives. I impressed on him the very informal nature of the proposed discussion, and (seeing that he was likely to be adamant in his refusal) suggested that I should see the delegates and find out what their proposals were and that, if I thought that there was any ting in them which might help towards a settlement, I should let him know about it. He more or less accepted this, but again said that he did not want any discussions while the delegates were here. I thought, however, that this was an answer, given in haste and without full thought, and that,if I see the delegates and then tell him 6f proposals which might form a real basis for discussion, the Shaikh might well think better of it. The Shaikh again asked me exactly how the thing had been arranged, and I explained again. In the course of the conversation I explained to him that he would have been consulted before final arrangements had been made, but that I had not long received Colonel Fowle's note about his meeting in Baghdad and I would have written to him (the Shaikh), but had no idea that things were going to be arranged so suddenly. I said that I had received a telegram suggesting that the representatives should come and had pressed him to receive them as I felt that it was impolitic for him to put himself in the position of refus ing to hear what they had to say. I think that he took my point but still feels that he should have been consulted before. I admitted to him quite frankly that I too was somewhat embarrassed at the haste in which the matter had been put before him but that I felt that the circum stances were such that it would be impossible to refuse to see the representatives without his placing himself in a somewhat awkward position. I said that I had known Kuwait for a long time though I had not been here for many years and that he could rely on me to do my best to try/-4- try to help towards effecting a settlement which would be agreeable to both sides and to look after Kuwaiti interests. Once or twice in the interview the Shaikh said that he was quite prepared to let the Political Resident and the Ambassador discuss the matter and make the settlement, to which he was willing to submit, but in any case, he did not want to talk with 'Iraqis. 6. The Shaikh summed up by saying that he would welcome the * Iraqi representatives socially and would do them well, but did not wish to talk business with them. 7. At the return call the Shaikh said that he would like to ask me to dine with him and whether I would like him to ask the 'Iraqi representatives. I rather thought that he would prefer that they should not come but I thought that it was most undesirable that they should be left out so replied that I would be delighted if he would ask them at the same time. Kuwait. 22nd September 1934.A rs \ Fote for Colonel Fowle's personal information y with reference to my note of the 22nd September 1934. I think that it is well to make clear, for Colonel Fowle's information, that, when I received the Charge d*Affaires* telegram of the 13th September, I was placed in a dilemma. I was pretty sure that the Shaikh would be difficult - and indeed foresaw much the line which he took - (though I was subsequently misled by the Kuwait telegram saying that the Shaikh had fallen in with my viewsX On the other hand it was clearly impolitic to try to postpone the meeting^'though had I known that he adhered to his previous view after my second telegram, I should have had to do so) 1 thought that on the whole the best thing was to come over as quickly as possible and to try to persuade the Shaikh to agree to discuss matters with them. Finding on my arrival how fixed he was in his ideas, I felt that the only course was to see the representatives myself and then, if their proposes were worth anything, to try to persuade the Shaikh to talk matters over with them also Kuwait. 22nd September 1934.i A, ' ' v-1 Note of an informal conversation between Lieutenant- Colonel Gordon Loch, Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and Tahsin Beg 'Ali (Mutasarrif of Basrah), and Dr* Kaji Beg al Asil (Director General of Foreign Affairs, f Iraq Government), with Major R.P,Watts(Political Agent, Kuwait) present. On the 24th September 1934 at 09.15 hours Tahsin Beg •Ali and Dr. Naji Beg al Asil came to the Agency by appointment for a discussion of the Kuwait smuggling question. After coffee and a few courtesies I opened the subject by saying that I had received a telegram from the Charge d f Affaires at Baghdad saying that the 'Iraq Government sincerely wished to do all that was possible to come to a settlement of the smuggling question with His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad of Kuwait, and that I appreciated this friendly attitude. I assured them that 1 would gladly do all that I could to assist in arriving at a settlement. I said that there was one point which had caused me some small embarrassment and that was the haste in which this informal conversation had been brought about. I much appreciated the ♦Iraq Government's having acceded to the proposal made at the discussion in Baghdad in July when Colonel Fowle was present, but the telegram informing me of their coming to Kuwait had only reached me about a week before and I had had no time in which to place the matter before His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad, and that I had only been able to communbate with him briefly by telegram. I said jokingly that in Baghdad they were used to moving quickly, but that in ths part of the world we still had rather a dislike of doing things/tilings in a hurry5 that this sudden arrangement had, therefore, made things a little awkward for me, and that I should have preferred to have put off the informal conversations till I could have consulted His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad. But as I had understood from the Charge d 1 Affaires that the hurry was due to the arrival of the Swedish Crown Prince, I had felt that we must try to fall in with their arrangement. 2. I said that I understood from the Charge d 1 Affaires that Dr. Naji was bringing constructive proposals, and asked him if he would let me know what the position was. A discussion of over 2 hours took place in which we went over the ground carefully and pretty frankly. 3. .The constructive proposals are very much what they were before, except that the 'Iraq Government have definitely stated (so far as informal conversations go) that they are prepared to give compensation to the Shaikh of Kuwait for losses consequent on putting a stop to the smuggling trade. In the course of discussion I said that I thought that it was well to make clear that the question was not merely one of a loss of so much customs duty, but that there was the 'good will' of the business. That is to say the reduction of imports would mean loss of work for labourers, loss of turn-over to wholesale merchants and loss of trade to the retailers, and that whereas it might be easy to offer a lump sum to a Ruler in circumstances like this, it would be very difficult to compensate the petty individuals affected. There was moreover the question of the tribes. For clearly a Ruler in the position of the Shaikh of Kuwait must be able to offer a freemarket to his tribesmen and I added that, indeed, circumstances might conceivably arise when it might be necessary for the Shaikh/-S- Shaikh of Kuwait to feed greater nambers of tribesmen than he did at present, and that any arrangement for the limitation of imports would have to 'be made on an elastic basis. Dr. Naji appreciated both these points and said that in regard to the former(rather vaguely) that no doubt means could be found to afford other employment on the sea or in other ways for persons affected, and in regard to the latter that this point could be met in the admini stative arrangements. In particular, in this connection, he said that if there was an 1 Iraqi official employed in Kuwait he would be able to see that the Shaikh was able to feed any tribesmen which he wished to feed, and that at the same time satisfy the ^raq Government that the goods thus used were not finding their way to 'Iraq. 4. Dr. Naji produced as his constructive proposals the following, and said that the idea was that they should * be discussed in a formal conference (i) the Shaikh of Kuwait should give an under taking to prevent smuggling, (ii) practical measures were necessary to ensure this undertaking, if accepted, being carried out. The suggestions of the 'Iraq Government were:- (a) the possibility of applying 'Iraq tariff in Kuwait with the technical advice of the 'Iraq Customs authorities, or (b) the retention of the Kuwait tariff in Kuwait and the management of the Kuwait Customs by 'Iraqi Customs Officials in the employ of the Shaikh of Kuwait, and that there should be a limitation of imports. In both cases, (a) or (b), compensation would be paid to the Shaikh. 5. If neither of these suggestions was acceptable to the Shaikh, the 'Iraq Government would be prepared to discuss any suggestions which he might wish to make for a/ *- He admitted, however, that if a settlement could be reached by informal means, there would be no need for a formal conference and any agreement reached could be affirmed through the ordinary diplomatic channels.-4- ylj 0 a settlement agreeable to both parties» The question of compensation was mentioned at various times in the course of the discussion and I particularly asked what they meant by compensation as the word might mean much or nothings Dr, Faji was not prepared to suggest a figure offhand but said that he would be prepared to try to do so after consulting Tahsin Beg 'Ali and after showing him certain figures which he had in his possession* He said that he was not authorised to put forward a definite figure but that if need be he would be prepared, if the trend of discussions warranted it, to suggest a figure to his Government. He assured me, however t that the idea of compensation was put forward genuinely and was not illusory- 7- I asked what their intentions were regarding the suggested 'Iraqi Customs official, and they said that the idea was that he should be loaned from the f Iraq Customs Service and would be under the control of the Shaikh of Kuwait• The 'Iraq Government would be assured, however, by the presence of' their own man that they would get correct figures of the imports into Kuwait, on which the limitations and the compensation would be based, I asked whether in the event of some arrangement of this sort being made, they would be prepared to accept a British Customs official borrowed from, for example, the Karachi Customs. This did not seem to find favour, though Dr. Nsgi did not refuse the idea straight away- He, however, suggested that there should be 2 officials, one British and one 'Iraqi. I asked who was going to pay and he said that the 'Iraq Government will be prepared to pay for the 'Iraqi and India might pay for the British official. 1/I said that he might be perfectly certain that India would not pay*. 8. Throughout the conversation, which was on friendly andJ^ank lines, it became clear that the 'Iraq Government were very anxious to settle this matter by arrangement as they manifestly did not wish to incur the considerable expense (and odium) of an effective cordon, and at one point .1 I summed it up by saying that I understood that the aim of their coming was to try to arrange a settlement of the smuggling question on an economic rather than a preventive basis, to which Dr* Naji heartily assented. I made it clear that I thought that there was no chance of establishing the 1 Iraqi tariff, because it would be impossible to expect the population to accept such a measure peaeefully. 9» At one point Dr. Faji, when discussing compensation, said that from something that had passed in a conversation between him and the Prime Minister, it seemed that the • Iraq Government were likely to include in the compensation a liquidation of the question of the Shaikh's properties along the Shatt al 'Arab. I said that I had understood that these were on the point of liquidation in any case in pursuance of the promise given by the late King Feisal. Naji said that they had recently nearly come to a ( settlement, but that some thing had arisen and he was not quite sure about it. It is clear that we should have to approach any question of compensation with the greatest c^re* I enquired, however, more than once, and Dr. ICaji was explicit that the compensation proposal was genuine and not merely a bargaining figure of speech. It was arranged that I should talk over the morning's conversation with His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad/-6- Ahmad in the evening, and that in the meantime they would work out their figures regarding the condensation Kuwait. 24th September 1934. k.&lt; A x Note On the afternoon of the 24th September 1934 His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad bin Jabar came to see me at the Agency in regard to the smuggling question (I had sent a message saying that I would come and see him but he preferred to come over to the Agency). 2. I told him that I had had a long discussion with the 1 Iraqi representatives and that one thing of importance had emerged which should be of benefit to him, that is to say, that the 'Iraq Government were prepared to give compensation for any loss which he might incur through putting a stop to the smuggling trade. The Shaiih said at once that he already knew that they would be prepared to give compensation. I explained(without definitely referring to the Kuwaiti Customs official which I thought would merely irritate him) that their idea was to talk over matters with a view to discovering whether it was not possible to come to some arrangement for stopping the smuggling on a basis of the 'Iraq Government giving compensation in return for a suitable arrangement in the Customs* The Shaikh took up his original line and said that he had not asked them to come and did not want to discuss matters with them; if the 'Iraq Government wished to make proposals it would be better for them to do so in writing when he c®uld say whether they were acceptable or not. We then went over much the same ground as before and I emphasised that I feared that a refusal to discuss matters with the representatives would make an unfavourable impresaon on His Majesty's Government, quite apart from the 'Iraq Government. The Shaikh's attitude was, however, adamant, and he is clearly genuinely doubtful about the good faith of this deputation. I again begged him to listen/—2- listen to them even if he was not prepared to discuss matters, but he said that he was really unwilling to do this. He obviously regards this mission as a 'plant', and I am not really surprised at this, especially having regard to the nature of the so-called H constructive proposals', which are nothing more or less than the old idea of an 'Iraq Customs control of Kuwait in a slightly altered guise. 3. Fortunately the hour of prayer arrived and I took the opportunity of saying that 1 hoped that he would think matters over and that I should come and see him the following morning at 0900 hours. Kuwait. 25th September 1934.Note. For Colonel Fowle's information* Not to be sent anywhere out of the office without his specific orders inwiting . On the morning of the 25th September 1934 at 0900 hours I went to see His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad bin Jabir, accompanied by Major Watts. 2. At the beginning of the interview I explained to the Shaikh a mistake, which had been made and which had obviously accounted for tsx. some of his feeling on the subject of the 'Iraqi representatives. 3. It appears that when the Head Clerk received my telegram No•795 of the 14th September 1934, he sent a co®y of it with a covering letter to the Shaikh. The Shaikh replied in a letter which was not altogether clear and the Head Clerk asked Dr. Greenway to go to see the Shaikh to make certain what was meant. As a result of that he sent his telegram No.246 of the 15th September. I then sent my telegram No.800 of the 16th September. Unfortunately a translation was not sent to the Shaikh, but Dr. Greenway told him of the contents and brought the Shaikh's reply back to the Head Clerk, who sent his telegram No.246 of the 17th September saying that 'the Shaikh has fallen in with your views'. In view of the Shaikh's attitude in the matter I suspected that something had gone wrong and asked Dr. Greenw^y exactly what the Shaikh had told him, and it appears that, on being told the gist of my telegram No.800 of the 16th September, the Shaikh had said that that was all right (meaning my coming) and that after discussion with me it could be decided whether the representatives were to come or not. When I told/Ol told the Shaikh, what had occurred and what had been said in the telegram, he at once said that that was not what he had said and confirmed at length what Dr. Greenway had said to me. That is to say, that he fell in with my coming but did not intend the representatives to come till after we had discussed matters when it could be decided whether it was any use their coming. Had I known that the Shaikh had maintained his objection to the coming of the representatives, I would certainly have asked that the visit might be put off till I had had time to pave the way. 4. My explanation, however, had the good effect of removing from the Shaikh t s mind a probable suspici 0 n that we were helping the * Iraqis to play some trick on him. It is unfortunate in the'last degree that the mistake I should have occurred. Kuwait. 25th September 1934.Note. I &gt; e On the morning of the 25th September 1934 at 0900 hours I went to see; His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad bin Jabir accompanied by Major Watts* The usual courtesies were exchanged and coffee and sherbet handed round, 2* After a brief explanation of a misunderstanding which had arisen over the coming of the ^raq representatives, the Shaikh and I took up the thread of our previous evening's discussion, I asked him whether he had thought over the matter and he went over much the same ground as on the previous evening. On this occasion the Shaikh \ asked for further details about the way of arranging for the Customs and I told him about their desire to have an 'Iraqi Customs officer lent to him (I explained to be under him like Mr. de Grenier was under His Excellency Shaikh Hamad). The Shaikh laughed and asked if I thought that it was possible for him to agree. I asked whether, if an officer was required in such a capacity, it would not be possible for him to get a British officer. After further discussions I asked him what the difficulty was and he said that he saw in this coming 'damage'. I enquired what he meant by 'damage' - what 'damage' h# saw ? He replied that he saw damage to his prestige, people would say that representatives had just come without his permission and uninvited by him. It was to be inferred, though he did not actually say so in as many words, that he feared that the visit was a 'plant' and that the representatives would go away and make capital out of the visit. I said that I also saw difficulties in the matter because if His Majesty's Government were informed that he would not discuss matters with the delegates, or even listen to what they had to say, that His Majesty's Government would feel difficulty in helping/-2- ^ helping him, and that they were actually helping him very much in ^raq^ I reiterated that the arrangement had been made by the Embassy and the British officials of the 'Iraq Government when Colonel Fowle was present, and that I felt that it would be rather hard for him Aot to incur a measure of resentment if he would have nothing to do with the representatives • I asked the Shaikh v/hether it would not satisfy his feelings regarding his prestige, if I was to communicate with His Majesty t s Government on the subject and perhaps write him a letter asking him to see the delegates, but the idea did not seem to appeal to hinu I then asked (as I had m various occasions before) what his own view was in the matter and what he thought should be done. 3. The Shaikh had evidently thought the matter over in the night, for he almost at once said that a course which would 'save the face' of everybody was for me to tell the delegates that the Shaikh wanted full details about their proposals which t^ey could give him through me either verbally or in writing and that he would like time to tlbink them over, as things had been put to him so hurriedly and that, after he had had sufficient time to consider matters, he would ask the Political Agent to convey an invitation through the usual channels to the 'Iraq Government to send a representative to discuss matters* On reply to an enquiry, he said that this representative could come either informally, or, if they liked, officially. The Shaikh emphasised that this course would ease matters for all concerned. 4. I appreciated that it was impossible to move him in the direction of immediate discussions(for he declined feven a suggestion to have a quite informal meeting at the Agency), and the Political Agent is asking Dr. Naji Beg al Asil and Tahsin Beg 'Ali to tea this afternoon. I will then enquire whether they have any figures of compensation, and/1^ and will in any case suggest that they should give me what information they have and that the Shaikh should be given a breathing space to consider matters before entering into actual discussions. i Kuwait. 25th September 1934,Note • On the afternoon of the 26th September 1934 Dr. Naji Beg al Asil and Tahsin Beg t Ali came to tea at the Agency. After tea I suggested that we should talk 'shop' a little. 2. I said that I had had some talk with the Shaikh and enquired whether they had managed to produce an estimate of the amount of the proposed compensation. With a dis claimer of the figure 'being anything more thun a suggestion on their part and the remark that it might be a thousand more or a thousand less, Dr. Naji said that they thought that something like 3000 dinars a year would be a suitable figure. He said, however, that in his discussion with the Prime Minister (Ali Beg Jowdat) it had been thought that the compensation should not be so much a figure based on customs losses as a general token of good-will. He did not, however, refer again to the settlement of the Date Garden question forming part of the compensation. 3. I said that the Shaikh had informed me that he would like to have fuller information, in particular as to how the proposed Customs officer was going to ensure that goods were not smuggled into f Iraq. I amplified this by explain ing that the point was how as a matter of administration one was going to ensure any particular goods not going to 'Iraq and at the same time not putting a stop to trade in other directions. We talked on this subject for a considerable time and the 'Iraq representatives did not seem to have any concrete suggesticn . All they said was that it was a technical point with which they were not well qualified to deal and that doubtless a way could be found. I asked again whether in the wvent of a Customs officer being appointedin Kuwait, a member of the Indian Customs I would/-2- would not satisfy his Government. His attitude resolved itself into the obvious one that the 'Iraq Government want their own man. I asked again in the course of the talk why they did not stop this smuggling by enlisting the help of their own tribal Shaikhs on the lines of Bin Sa , ud f s system. Dr. Kaji replied suggesting that they were rather civilised for anything- which might produce troubles and said that they did not want to have incidents up and down the frontier and so onI He also said that they had a plan in readiness to enforce the stoppage of smuggling but that they did not want to put it intoeffect because of the cost and possible troubles which might ensue. On the whole it is pretty clear, as has been surmised, that the ! Iraq Government have not got much control over their tribes. 4. I said that the Shaikh would like time, say 10 days or a fortnight, to think over the proposals and that he was then prepared to invite a representative of the •Iraq Government to discuss matters in Kuwait. Dr. ITaji asked whether it would be informal or official and indicated ■ that the next discussion would have to be official. I said that the Shaikh had told me that he was prepared to make it informal or official as they pleased. . 5. By this time I think that Dr.ITaJi had appreciated the fact that the Shaikh was not really prepared to discuss matters with them and this was a suitable means of avoiding an unpleasant deadlock, for he only asked whether it would be all right if they were to leave the next morning. I said that that was of course a matter in which they could ■ please themselves, and so far as I was concerned I should have to wait on for a day or two for the Mail. 6. Dr. Haji told me that the Shaikh had asked them to/-3- Later Agent to come round and see him after dinner that evening and whether I had any objection to their talking matters over with the Shaikh if he 'brought up the subject. I said that I did not think that the Shaikh would be likely to bring up the question, but that, if so, they might by all means discuss it. the Shaikh told the Political ) that he had not done so. ) 7. There was some little further talk after which the representatives went away. 8. Throughout all these discussions it appeared quite clear that the 'Iraq Government have no constructive proposal whatever except that they wish to control the Kuwait Customs, and I think that apart from that, to them, very natural wish, they have not much understanding of the practical difficulties involved. The representatives left Kuwait at 0815 ^ours on the 26th September 1934 by motor car for Basrah. Kuwait. 26th September 1934,Hote \UtH On the afternoon of the 27th September 1934 Shaikh Sir Ahmad bin Jabir came to the Agency to say goodbye. He did this although I had sent a message to say that I was coming to say goodbye to him. representatives and told him that I had informed them of what he had said to me: that is to say, that he wished for time to consider the proposals that had been made by them and that after a short time, say about 10 days or so, he would send an invitation through Major Watts (and the usual channel) to the 'Iraq Government to send representatives to discuss matters, either informally or officially. I said that Dr. Naji had said that he thought that the next dis cussion should be an official one. I also handed to the Shaikh a note showing briefly the proposals of the representatives in English and Arabic• 3. At this interview the Shaikh again quite spontaneously reaffirmed what he had said about inviting representatives from the 'Iraq Government, so that there should be no question whatever of his going back on the arrangement. I should, however, place on record that when I mentioned 10 days again, he said^'Oh yes, but it will be a little longer than that owing to the Crown Prince's visit'. There had apparently been some mention of this invitation for a further discussion when he saw the representatives to say goodbye. 4. I gathered that the Shaikh had had a very pleasant telegram of thanks from the representatives for the hospitality and courtesy which they had received. 2. I mentioned the matter of the visit of the Kuwait. 2&amp;th September 1934./ • ^ 0 ^ J—*U^t^ O 1 ^ ( T ) I **jy jU-^&gt; IJ I &lt;?■ ■♦ vW ^ j| — 5 ^&gt;-k iHj^J I iWrf u^' ( ^ ) v —^ i^l^l i^l S^Jklt J;_yi«ji JJII^I 41^1 IfSl J ,&gt; I i4^t •UL.I (-) £t jSJt ^ jUI iSljUii 5;»Ji j L. 0* uyj^t s?r A &lt;jMi |»jl &gt;&lt; -&lt;U t ^JI jji • ts.i^iyj J- jl (1 'J^r^•Mr) 1 ■' S, yUi u jjAJi jy ^l/^ 1 jUnl ^ «•■*» c!^' (i) The Shaikh of Kuwait should give an undertaking to prevent smuggling* (ii) Practical measures were necessary to ensure this undertaking, if accepted, being carried out* The suggestions of the f Iraq Government were:- (a) the possibility of applying ♦Iraq tariff in Kuwait with the technical advice of the 1 Iraq Customs authorities 9 or (b) the retention of the Kuwait tariff in Kuwait and the management of the Kuwait Customs by ^raq Customs t officials in the employ of the Shaikh of Kuwait, and that there should be a limitation of imports.

(Designation)ml wfeich prpvod ie^ossible to diep«l. 1 should mak« it clear that the Shaikh showed th«t representatives personally math courtesy asm hospitality| housing them in his palace, inviting them to dinner and so on* 4, I had hoped that, when X could tell him more of the constructive proposals which hmX been promisee by the 'Iraq Government, 1 should be able to persuade the 3haiteh to eater into the informal discussions* Unfortunately the proposals were not of a nature to encourage the Shaich to do so# they were $- (i) The Shaikh of Kuwait should give an unaertaking to prevent smuggling* (ii) Practical measures were necessary to ensure this undertaking, if accepted, being carried out, and the suggestions of the 'Iraq govern- ment were:- (a) to apply the 'Iraq tariff in Kuwait with the technical advice of the 1 Iraq Customs authorities, or (b) to retain the Kuwait tariff in r .uwait and to place the management of the Kuwait Customs under •Iraqi Customs officials in the employ of the Shaikh of Kuwait, and that there should be a limitation of imports • In either case, (a) or (b), compensation would be paid to the Shaikh* (iii) If neither of these suggestions was acceptable to the shaikh* the 'Iraq Geveraaent would be prepared to discuss an^ suggestions which he might wish to make for a settlement agreeable to both parties* except, therefore, that the principle of compensation has been admitted openly, the proposals are simply for the institution of 1 Iraqi control of the Kuwait Customs* 5* I conveyed these proposals verbally to the shaikh and made further efforts to bring about a meeting* After a long talk the Shaikh said that he wished to have fuller information as to the practical measures by which it was suggested/-3- \U$ suggested that an officer eiaployed In the custoius would i^eirent supplies reaching 'Iraqi tribes while maintalnlog the freedom of the market for Kuwaiti and other tribes. He was firmly opposed to the employment of an •Iraqi officer• xi e also aaked for fuller information about the amount of compensation* 6* Major Watts and I further discussed at considerable length the general question of stopping smug^lin^ and tneir proposals in particular, with Jr» Kaji al Asil and Tahsin Beg V a II i but were unable to elicit any definite answer to the Shaikh 1 ® enquiry about practical measures. 9r» Haji said that that was a technical matter in which he was not qualified to give an opinion i but he thought that a way could no doubt be found. I hope that it will be possible for the ^raq Government to amplify this point in order to help the Shaikh in considering their proposals. ab a very tentative figure, 3000 dinars a year was suggested as a suitable amount for compensation, but it was explained that, the compensation would not be so much a payment against actual loss of customs revenue as a kind of payment for good will. At one time it was hinted that a liquidation of the Shaikh•s Shatt al ^rab date garden affairs might form part of the compensation, but I said at once that 1 had always understood that these questions were already being liquidated under the promise made by the late King* Subsequently no refer^ce was made to this point, but this mention of the date gardens was noteworthy. 7. In the end, it was arranged that the haikh should have time to consider the proposals put forward to me by the representatives, and that after a short time, say ten days or so, the Shaikh would, through the usual channel, invite/-4- \U r \ iiivi te vas ox txia 1 1;r&amp;q Qov&amp;jrw&amp;fsnt to discuss hsid %2&amp;ttST8 with Mm* The -haikh/toXd. me that he was prepared t&gt;© accept either an inJTorraaul or on official discussion| Dr. Maji saia that any further discussion should, he thought, be official. E# The representatives left earl#- on the morning of the 26th September after taking farewell of the Shaikh on the previous evening. 9# Although this visit to Kuwait has not led. to any immediate outward result, 1 feel that good should ensue from the fact that the Shaikh and Br» Naji al iuBil (Tahsin Beg VAli was known to hi© before) have established personal relations, and that the two representatives and Major Watts and I have had the advantage of long informal, and very tYienaly, discussions of the subject. 10* If I may give personal impression for what it is worth, I should say:- (a) that it would be well nigh impossible for any iiuler, in circumstances such as obtain in Kuwait, to impose an high tariff owing to the resentment of the population, both urban and desert, (b) that for reasons of prestige such a nuler would be unable to accept a loan of the services of a Customs officer from a more powerful neighbour, though he might well accept an officer from elsewhere, (c) that it wold be helpful to the Shaikh in considering the proposals if the 1 Iraq Government would indicate i- (i) precisely what form of control they wish to see exercised in the Kuwait Customs, (ii) whether they would accept as satisfactory to/to tiieia the exercise of that control by a Customs Officer of suitable standing from the Indian Customs, and (ill) on nlmt basis the suggested coxapensation would be calculated. 11 ♦ I would add, that, on hearing that a customs Officer was to accompaay the partjr, I arranged with the Shaito of Bahrain to place at disposal for a few days the services of Mr# C«C«L*de Orenier, Director of Custume, Bahrain, as 1 thought that consultations between Customs* experts might provide us with useful practical suggestions.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 3^0 of the 30th December last, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the agreement between Finland and Sweden, signed on the 29th December, relating to co-operation in the prevention of alcohol smuggling. This copy has been printed by the Finnish Government, but was communicated to me by the Swedish Legation. 2. The Swedish Charge d'Affaires drew my attention to the clause giving the smuggling preventive services of each State the same rights and duties in the territorial waters of the other State as in their own waters, which, he said, introduced a new principle in international law. I had heard, however, that a similar arrangement existed between the Danish and Norwegian services in the Kattegat, and, on enquiry at the Danish Legation, was informed that such was indeed the case, but that the practice rested on no international agreement, but was merely a private arrangement between the respective coastguard services. 3. A point of interest is that Sweden claims 4 marine miles of territorial waters in the Gulf of Bothnia, whereas the Danish Legation state that on the west coast, at 0resund, she only claims 3 marine miles. 4. I have sent a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's Minister at Stockholm. I havej &amp;c. J. THYNE HENDERSON. P.S.—It appears that the reason why Sweden has less than 4 marine miles of territorial waters at Oresund is not that she claims less, but that the sound is so narrow that there is not room for 4 miles.

Unhelpful attitude of Shaikh is regrettable. Present Prime Minister of Iraq has often reiterated his desire for more friendly relations. By sending carefully selected delegates to this infor mal conference, one of whom was known to be persona grata to the Shaikh, Iraqi Government have mad© a practical gesture of friend ship towards settlement of smuggling problem. It is well known that Shaikh and his subjects have for many years made great profits out of contraband traffic. In view of his present attitude towards Iraqi Government and x&gt;f fact that actual smugglers in most if not all cases are Iraqi subjects, it does not seem reasonable that His Majesty's Government should inter vene with Iraqi Government every time that Shaikh cries out he is hurt in connection with this profitable smuggling* I hope this consideration may 'be borne in mind when next incident occurs* The Shaikh cannot have it 'both ways. 1 9 nevertheless, feel that, despite outwardly barren results, this meeting has done good, thanks to the efforts of Colonel Loch and to the admitted good will of the Iraqi delegates. I have dis cussed this matter, both with the Minister and Secretary General of Foreign Affairs. Nuri pasha is in favour of continuing the negotia- / tions and at the same time proposes to strengthen the police posts at Safwan and Zubair and to exercise stricter control in Basra, where the smuggling is organized. The Secretary General of Foreign Affairs advocates a 'gentleman's agreement' with the Shaikh providing forw for no smuggling on the present organized scale in return for some monetary compensation. He is certain that it is within the Shailch^ power to stop the smuggling. Here Colonel Loch's suggestion for the appointment of a British Indian Customs Controller, who would of course be in close liaison with the Iraqi Customs, seems an excellent idea. The British Director of the Iraqi Customs informs me that as Iraq loses at least £60,000 a year from Kuwaiti smuggling, Iraqi Government can afford to pay the Shaikh handsome compensation for stopping it. The idea of including settlement of Date Gardens case in an Iraq-Kuwaiti settlement on smuggling seems worthy of encouragement, as the more His Majesty's Government is out of that picture the better. While Secretary General seemed favourable, I doubt whether the Iraqi Government would play up without involving His Majesty's Government, but the Date Gardens problem might well be settled about the same time as the smuggling and benefit by the existing atmosphere of good will.

It 18 revealed by tbeae Inreatlgatlone that the complaints raised by Hie Excellency the sheikh are apparently based en the erldence of persone aoetly jaored by a special feeling produced by the legltinate measures ♦Iraqi forces had carried out within the frontiers of 'Iraq for the suppression of tsauggllnfr aetlritles^of the extending scope of which the Ministry 'haTe' {? had) informed you, 2 ' There la no doubt that the 'Iraqi forces^ who had no object other than that of exercising control on the frontier and stopping the entry of aaagplere with their suDuggled goods into 'Iraqi territory, would not purposely cress the Kuwaiti frontier. Her have they aggreeeed en may one of Kuwait's subjects, especially so in Tiew of the fact that the orders leaued to theee forces require them to exercise great caution in regard to the frontier line; while the members of theee forces were wa^ careful in their observance of these orders. Assuming that they hare crossed the frontier at certain localitlee In the course of the moTement of oars between any two- 2 - n ^ la call ties, there is no doubt that such crossing Ims not done on purpose, The land there is, m you are aware, flat with similar surface features, and void of i&amp;ain frontier line mark® such as will facilitate the iaentification of the boundary separating the territories of the two states. If His Excellency the Shaikh has heard of members of these forces having visited bedouin enciyapment® and dranJfe coffee and water there, this is a coiamon custom of racial etiquette which cannot be stopped and is in no way considered to constitute purposeful trespass. It is noteworthy that the information given by kurshid A1 Sharmawi, which foms the basis of complaint, is itself based on hearsay; whereas he had been especially sent out to ***** (? spot or watch for) the armed cars and should have been able* to see them had they really crossed the frontier of Kuwait in the manner stated by hiie, especially so as he claims to have roamed about for 3 days in the small northern corner of the territory of Kuwait and auiong the various bedouin encampments there, I wish to draw special attention to ^urshid Ai Shaaaaar^s statement a propos his visit to Amir Half ibn Hajraf at Urn al ^adafi 1 on the 13th ^ay last, and to state that it is proved by enquiry that Amir Ha if was not at 0m al .iiadafi 1 on that date; he was on the 1 Iraqi lands of AX •Udhaiba and Al Hahil. This* is confirmed by tribal chiefs who were encamped on lands adjacent to his encampment. It is to be concluded from this that the information given by ^urshid cannot be taken as a sound argument, U AB regard® -utlaq ibn Abaullah Al IwllamaBi, this person owns camels engaged in the carriage of nuggled- 3 - n k goods, 'ollce patrols had came cerase lil« in the sandy wadis at 'Udbalba, ®fa«n he concealed hie camels aaoag the sadia and then started to ma a*ay with theai^taking advantage of the sandy lande which motor cars eannot negotiate, whereupon it w &amp; b necessary to fire a number of shots in the air to compel him to stop only. He was not, assaulted hy the Police, It appears that the action Urn taken by the P 0 lice in the mnner stated may have induced iutlaq to fabricate this informatien. As to the statement made by Mr. Chiehola, I Bay point out to Your Honour that it it impossible for one passing on the public road to make out cars follewine in their progreet the route of the water welle and bedouin encaaptaente far removed from the straight Kuwait-Safwan road. It appears that the reasons which vexed this individual and called for hie dissatisfao* tioa with the proceedings of the 'Iraqi force lie in the fact that a quantity of sugar, tea and coffee ; *hich he had sent to Artf {Sergeant) ZaraJ at Safwan, through a driver of 'the' (? a) Basrah transport company, was confiscated and declared smuggled goods. Your Honour will agree with me that Mr. Chieholm holds no capacity authorising him to ascertain the laoveioents of 'Iraq forces in the event of his actually happening to (? com across) them, ^ me 'Iraqi Government In giving assurance of their good intentions towards His Excellency the shaikh of Kuwait and of their dssiras to avoid all that is calculated to give rise to Misunderstanding, will be glad if you will urge His sxcellency not to reckon upon such reports spread about by advocates of aaugglUe who have been deprived of sources of illegitimate profit as a result of measures adoptod by the -Iraqi- 4 • OQY^Trment and mtepw tmtm by ji®ighfe©uriii^ for the mppvem*i*n of Bnaiggli^ # At th« mm® tim I am ioelin^a to find s hap^y au^ur in the TftemMmt hopes set ©a th@ Tinit of tho 1 Imql daX#gstioa to Kuvait and the iNlsnltft to foliow from th® friendly diseufttiona which haY« take-ia pXmeM th&amp;m * romilta #iich are calculate a to lead to th® auupr^salon of mulling and to the pr^veatioa of any ineidonts likely to enone there fro iii« ,, As regards the Sanam incident, the ministry hart seked the 'Iraqi departments concerned to expedite the completion of inire^ti^Uonsinstitnte.d in this connection, and I will inform you of the result st the earliest poeBible opportunity♦ X araii ^yaelf of this opportunity to express to Your Honour my highest consideration and esteem* Tours sincerely, (Sd # ) Huri si Said # lie Honour ^r # Ogilvie-Forbesi Charge d*Affaires, His Britannic i&amp;ajesty* s .Msassy, Bagdad*No. 34.

From The Hon'ble Lieut.-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.iii., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf., To His excellency Sir F.K.Humphrys f G»C. .G. f etc.,etc., His Majesty's embassador, -agdad. from leave I approached the Shaikh on the matter of the conference in question. His jiDccellency said that there had been some misapprehension in the matter and that what he told Colonel Loch was that if he - the shaikh - wished for a conference, he would arrange for one. Both Colonel Loch, with whom I had the opportunity of discussing the matter here, and Major Mtts at that time officiating Political Agent, Kuwait, who was present at the interview in question, state quite categorically that the Shaikh's statement was as reported in paragraph 7 of Colonel Loch's Express Letter Ko.C/293 of 27th September 1934. I am afraid therefore that the Shaikh is adopting evasive tactics, which, in the present circumstances especially, are much to be regretted, since Dr .Naji, one of the 'Iraqi representatives, was naturally informed of the Shaikh 's statement, vide paragraph 7 of Colonel Loch's Express Letter No.C/293, dated the 27th September 1934. The Shaikh's tergiversation has placed Sir, I have the honour to. refer to Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes f % despatch No.34(90/91/34) of the 26th October x934, a copy of which was forwarded to His Majesty's rincipal Secretary of State for ioreign Affairs. 2. When passing through Kuwait recently on my returnvrU placed us all in an awkward position, which is most regrettable » 3, The Shaikh went, on to say that if it was a | question of accommodation between himself and the 'Iraq Government, i.e♦ that he was prepared to give away something on his side and the ^raq Government were prepared to take similar action on theirs, the conference would be useful# This, however, in his view, was not the case. The 'Iraq proposals were quite unacceptable to him, while his did not go far enough from the point of view of the 'Iraq Government, and he was prepared to go no further. He thought therefore that the conference vvould do harm rather than good# It was not mu®h use his inviting the 'Iraqi representatives to visit him only to inform them that their proposals were quite unacceptable. 4. On these grounds the Shaikh suggested that he should write an official letter, which v ^ould be forwarded by me to Your Excellency for communication to the ' Iraq Government, on the following lines: (a) That he understood that the proposals of the 'Iraq Government as stated by their representatives on their visit to Kuwait, and which had been given to him - the Shaikh, by Colonel Loch, were as follows: (i) The Shaikh of Kuwait should ^ive an under taking to prevent smuggling# (ii) Practical measures were necessary to ensure this undertaking, if accepted, being carried out, and the suggestions of the 'Iraq Govern ment were:- (a) to apply the 'Iraq tariff in Kuwait with the technical advice of the 'Iraq Customs authorities, or (b) to retain the Kuwait tariff in Kuwait and to place the management of the Kuwait Customs under 'Iraqi Customs officials in the employ of the Shaikh of Kuwait| and that there should be a limitation of imports# in- 3 - In either case&gt; (a) or (tO* compensation would t&gt;e paid, 'to the Sliaikii* (iii) If neither of these suggestions was accept able to the Shaikh, the 'Iraq Government would be prepared to discuss any suggestions which he might wish to make for a settlement agreeable to both parties. (Please see paragraph 4 of Colonel Loch's Express Let .er referred to above)• (b) That the Shaikh was quite unable to accept proposals (i) and (ii) above, since they infringed on his sovereign rights. s^ith regard to (iii), in view of the friendship which he had with the »Iraq Government he was prepared to take the following measures: (1) That all concerned in Kuwait would be warned that no goods could be exported by sea without being manifested; persons found violating this order would be punished* (2) The Nakhuda of every boat sailing from Kuwait would be given a spare copy of the manliest of the goods carried by him. On the ship s return to Kuwait this manifest would have to be produced showing an endorsement by the Customs official of the port or ports of destination, certifying that the relevant goods had been duly landed at that port. (Please see Note of conversation between Colonel Fowle and His excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad, Ruler of Kuwait, on the 18th July 1934 at which Major Watts, iolitical .vgent, Kuwait, was present, on the subject of Kuwait-*Iraq smu. ^ -.linjC j * 5. We can now take two courses: We can insist upon holding the Shaikh to his promise of a conference, or B. We can accept his proposal of his suggested above and lorwarc it to the Iraq Government with the remark that though the ^liaikh a-reed to a conference, in tue circumstances explained in his letter the gulf is so wide between the proposals ot the Shaikh and the 1 Iraq Government that a conference would do no good. personally I advocate B as I do not see what good in all the circumstances a conference would do. 6. Finally, I venture to take this opportunity oi making/• 4 - i ^ iQ£tkiiig some general remarks v /hich have some bearing on this question# The attitude of the 1 Iraq Government seems to be that if they Cannot obt&amp;in the co-operation of the Shaikh of Kuwait they cannot stop the smuggling* This does not seem to be correct. It is of course not for us to dictate to the 'Iraq Government as to what measures they should take to stop smuggling into their territory, but that they could Wke the following action seems very obvious, (a) Institute an efficient patrol of the Kuwait-* Iraq frontier, say, with half a doxen cars, two of which might ——* *' i be provided witj^ wireless and all have machine guns end armed men on bo&amp;rd» The cost of this measure to the 'Iraq Government, especially in view of the large loss which they state they are put to by way of smuggling, v/ould be very small. The present measures appear to be limited to the following, vide paragraph 107 (a), end (c) of the Kuwait Intelligence Summary for October ^S34, quoted below:- (Colonel Dickson) ,f (a) Since the writei^ returned froia leave on x6th October 1934, he has made many enquiries as to the steps taken during the summer of 1934 by the f Iraq Government to combat the smuggling which they are never tired of accusing Kuwait of fostering. Among ot..er things the writer paid two visits to the Northern nd north western frontier of the principality to x 'ind out for himself by personal enquiry i/vhat actual ly was going on. (b) He again feels it his duty to record the melan choly fact that apparently only 6 men under a Chaoush are expec-ted. to hold the frontier line of 150 miles. These six men are permanently posted at Safwan, are immoDile as far as one can see, and spend theie time apparently only in examining cars that ply between Kuwait and .ubair. They are indeed the only visible evid- ence along the whole desert frontier of the steps that are being t aken by the 1 Iraq Govern ment to combat the smuggling problem ♦ (c) There are, it is true, 2 old Chevrolet armed cars which act as support to the above six men, but these are stationed at ubair some 30 miles from the frontier and cannot affect the situation much* One could get no evidence tha these cars ever went down the Western side of the frontier as far as Rigai on the Saudi Arabian border*' (b)1^7 (b) lut a stOjj to 'optional import 1 between Basrah and Kuwait. This system is as follows: 1 Iraqi merchants in Basrah import considerable consignments of goods by steamer, marked 'Basrah optional Kuwait', that is to say the goods can be landed at either port# The consignees take advantage of this to inform whether to unload their consignments at Kuwait their agents in Kuwait^, or send them on to Basrah according as circumstances dictate at the time of their arrival at Kuwait* If this system is put a stop to by the ♦Iraq Government it is obvious that such consignments would have to proceed to Basrah and not be unloaded at Kuwait with the chance of their being smuggled into 'Iraq tex*ritory. (c) prevent the export to Kuwait, free of excise duty, of cigarettes manufactured in 1 Iraq, which are at present despatched to Kuwait in large quantities by 'Iraqi merchants with the intention of smuggling them back into 7\ aoj -ir.q. 7. A further consideration which I have to bring to the notice of His Majesty^ Government is that should the Shaikh under pressure whether from the f Iraq Government, or ourselves, institute checks on trade in Kuwait, which would seriously impoverish his subjects already hard hit by depression and Ibn Saud♦s blockade, it is not unlikely that His Excellency would have to face a large measure of unpopularity, perhaps even disturbances led by members of his family. (There is the usual opposition party in Kuwait as in every Arab Shaikhdom). Such disturbances would, especially if the Shaikh had given way to the ^raq proposals under pressure from us, place a large measure of responsibil ity on Fis Majesty's Government.

They are as follows (a) The men who were shot up Y;ere actually retainers of Shaikh Salim al Hamud al Subah, cousin of His Excellency the Ruler. This was confirmed on 2nd November 1934 by Shaikh Salim himself to me in presence of Murshid. (b) From this Office telegfam No.242, dated 28th iV August and para marked 'Secondly, it might be inferred that the two men, on leaving their camp at Athaiba and Ruhail which lie just across the frontier North-West of Kuwait, proceeded direct' from the^r to Jahara (near Kuwait) and passed a place called Raf* iyeh en route. Actually the men proceeded north in the first instance to the wells called Raf^yeh lying 23 miles North-West of Jebel Sanam and well in Iraq5./ s - iyt Nnfc [{*-'*&lt; Iraq territory (Papworth's map of 1934 calls it Rafahiyah, and Million Sheet RAJTAIflYA), where some of their friends were staying. After spending one night there^they left again for Jahara and Kuwait. (c) The men entered Kuwait territory slightly 'Test of Jebel Sanam, and when they reached a spot 15 miles inside Kuwait territory, and slightly /est of a dried \ up lakelet called HOTHA. (Fapworth's map) on the Kuwait - Basra Road, they met the two Iraqi armed Police cars which shot them up. (On the Million Sheet the spot corresponds with the of A1 Eamar ridge. (d) Although the man, Murshid al Buraihi, has been released, ■ the camels still remain in the hands of the Iraq Police. 2. It might be asked what these two unfortunate Kuwaitis were doing in Iraq, and no doubt the Iraqi Police will suggest that they were returning from a smuggling expedition. The reply to this is that after the Araibdar and Fiddawiyeh camp at Ruhail and Athaiba broke up through lack of grazing, the majority i of individual tents proceeded along with many Awazim tribesmen [ to the country lying south and South-./est of the Hamar lake - These scattered over a large area in a pitiable attempt to eke oui; an existence. 2. Close investigations since my return from leave show that very many of these unfortunate Kuwaiti and Awazim tribesmen 1 i are still South of the Hamar lake, and are quite unable to return home, let alone move their sheep, owing to the entire absence in the Northern area of Kuwait of any grazing at all. 4. It is a melancholy fact that the late rain which fell in Kuwait in May 1934, and from which so much was hoped for, resulted in no benefit. New grass actually came up but was burned up as soon as it appeared. The result has been that ■ x* for the Bedouin famine conditions have existed throughout the Summer of 1934 and still continue.- 3 - 5. So bad have conditions been that I understand from tp^ Bedouin frineds that some of the Awazim and a few Kuwait Araibdar have actually crossed the Euphrates near Nasriyeh and are now West of Shatra on the Shatt al Kar # I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.

My dear George, Yfe he en considering Ogilvie-Forbes' Saving en Telegram No,35 of 1st October on the question of smuggling 'between Iraq and Koweit and have shown it to Fowle. After discussion with him I venture to make the following comments. hitch arose over the visit of the Iraqi intermediaries to Koweit and it looks as though through some error there had been failure to give the Sheikh notice sufficiently far ahead. We cannot help feeling, too, that Bagdad were at fault in sending representatives to make cut and dried proposals, whereas the plan agreed on at the meeting with Fowle on 19th July had been a different one ~ the despatch of representatives to prepare the way for a conference by making it clear to the Sheikh that he had nothing to lose by entering into such a conference* On the other hand, as Ogilvie-Forbes says, there seems reason to believe that the meeting has done some good, and from paragraph 7 of Loch's express letter, 0,293, of 27th September (copy sent We quite agree that it is unfortunate that any Rende1, Esq., GMG,, FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.I. to/2. 1^/ to you on 5tli October under our printed letter P.Z.6183/34) it appears that the Sheikh, as a result of the visit, is prepared to accept either an informal or an official discussion of the question* 3, We feel at the same time that it is important to emphasize as regards paragraph 2 of Ogilvie-Forbes' telegram that the Sheikh is on very strong ground legally and internationally in this question. As the Foreign Office have previously informed us the onus of suppressing smuggling cannot be regarded as resting upon him, and is essentially a matter for the Iraq Government. The incidents of which he has complained are all incidents, so far as can be judged, in which equally he has a genuine cause of complaint, and so long as he has a legitimate grievance it is of course our duty (as I think has been accepted by all the interested Departments in the discussions that have taken place) to defend his interests with Iraq. It would be impossible, for instance, to justify the shooting of Koweitis by Iraqi officials in Koweit territory merely on the ground that the reception g;iven the Sheikh to the delegates to the recent informal conference had been rather cool. 4. On a second point we are strongly averse (as I think the Foreign Office have been in the past) from linking in/3. in any way the question of the date gardens with that of smuggling. They are quite separate issues and can only satisfactorily in our view 'be dealt with independently though, as Ogilvie-Forbes says, if it were possible to settle 'both in the near future this would 'be all to the good. 5. Copies of this letter are being sent to India and to Bushire. , Yours ever, GILBERT LAITHW'AITE.-Secretary of State for India- What is the present position 7 Political Agent Kuwait should of course take part in discussions whether they are informal or officials If they are official it would be preferable that he should preside and he should in any case make it clear that whatever their nature their outcome must be submitted for confirmation through the ordinary official channels.

Operation of Iraq Customs Launch in Kuwait territorial waters. Sir, I have the honour to enclose for your information translation of a letter from His -Excellency the Ruler of V Kuwait, No.R-4/1803, dated the 6th November 1934, to my address which speaks for itself. 2. The latter is as you see very moderately worded, and in no way attempts to magnify a small incident, into something big. Indeed I have always found this to be the case when the Shaikh has thought fit to report some overt act on the part of Iraqi officials whether by land or sea. 3. In the present instance the irritating point frcm the Shaikh's point of view, is that WARBA Island which lies immediately north of Bubiyan Island, belongs to Kuwait, and clearly the Fao launch had no right to act as it did, let alone fire on the boat or the Shaikh's hawking party. 4. Happily no harm was done, although one must condemn, the reckless firing of the launch's crew as a stupid and mad act, seeing that those fired on were also armed and might easily have retaliated, to the disadvantage of the launch's crew. Indeed it is a curious fact in passing, to record how ready the Iraq preventive officer's man is with his gun. Fire is opened on the least provocation, which shows an irresponsible state of mind, to say the least of it. 5./s 5, The point of political significance in the above story is of course the fact that the Iraq Customs authorities have in the past steadily denied that their Fao Customs Launch ever proceeded as far as TJarba Island or beyond, as it was so small that it would be dangerous for it to go any distance frcm Fao. They made great play of this fact when the Shaikh accused the Launch Commander of operating in the narrows north west of 'ailika Island (See this Agency Report No.245, dated the 11th October 1933.) and ag.in when the launch attacked and captured the two small Kuwait woodcutters * boats in the northern portion of the .Chor Subiyeh (See this Agency despatch ITo,G-182, dated the 13th Hay 1934). I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. Poli ti cal Agent, KuwaitTranslation of a letter No,R-4/1803, dated: the 29tli Rajab 1353, corresponding to the 6th November 19 34, from His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwa it• After Compliments, I have the honour to inform you that at this time of the year ,Autumn, and with the approaching hawking season snarersfof falcons make a practice of going out into the country to catch young hawks* Some of these actually the servants of my^brothers (actually cousins) Shaikhs All al Khalifa and Salim al Hamud, were camped^and had set their traps on .Yarba island (appertaining to Kuwait), On the 22nd Rajab 1353 (31.10,34) a small boat whose nakhuda was one Jasir bin Khalil, proceeded from Kuwait to Warba Island with the following provisions for the said trappers, viz half a bag of Rice, a basket of dates, and some drinking water. As the boat, after having discharged these provisions, was anchored close in shore opposite the trappers* hut, a Fao Gust cms launch appeared and started firing at them from a distance of about half a mile. Six shots were discharged in all, while the launch gradually came near to them. The crew of the boat and the trappers, meanwhile, were standing up conspicuously, the' latter with their hawks on their wrists, to show that they were trappers. Coming within earshot the people in the launch shouted to the men in the boat and the trappers to stand quite still and not move. They all complied. Then the launch drew quite close in, ard a man from it asked the men in the boat to send him their canoe (houri), to enable him to come to their boat. Two of them went in the canoe to fetch him. He detained them alongside in their canoe, and in his launch came alongside the boat, which he inspected. Having satisfied himself that they were servants of ours and only trappers, he left them and proceeded on his way. In drawing/- 2 - % nyo 7 In drawing your attention to the above occurrence, I would once again request you to give full consideration to these sort of outrages, which although regularly denied by the Central Government at Baghdad,'are regular occurrences where the j?ao Custccis officials are concerned, I do not think that our sister State the Iraqi Government really knows what is going on or would approve of such acts of her servants, which are inconsistent with the rights of friendship and neighbourhood.

I regret to see that H.E.Imri Pasha instead of tnndering a handsaae apology for the incursion of the Iraq armed cars into Kuwait territory, as I had hoped he would,has seen fit, all through his letter, to not only deny the whole story as a fabrication, but has gone out of his way to try and shake the evidence of Kuwait's various witnesses, notably that of Murshid al chammari (vide page 2 and para 5 of His Excellency's letter) a particular trustworthy officer of the Shaikh of Kuwaits and that of Mr.Chisholm of the A.P.O.C. (pa^e 2 and para 4 of His Excellency's letter). 3. As regards Aurshid's evidence: I would draw attention to my Intelligence Summary No.3 for period jr'Yxst to 15tli May 1934, paras 33(a) (b) and 34(1) In wMoh I wrote as follows: Para 55 (al tT A sharp thunder storm burst over Kuwait town^Kuwait town at 3 A.M. on the morning of 14t]li M May. This ?/as followed by a series of thunder storms embracing practically the whole of the 'Principality etc, n '(b) Heavy rain fell over a wide area etc... ft Para 24(i). Tt The following were the grouping of the Kuwait 'tribes (Fiddawiyeh and Araibdar) up to and on 'the 15th ay Those under Haif bin ''ajraf• 'as a result of the heavy rain. made for 'the „1 Hauma region south of the SHIGGiiG-, Tt near the Bat in and are now echeloned southwards n to Abrag al Tiabari n . That is to say on the 15th . ay 19S4, the iunir Eaif as a result of the heavy rain moved, from Um al Madafa where he had been camped for about 3 weeks (I myself visited him there) and proceeded to AL HAUIvIA region with the Kuwait ] ? iddawiyeh and Araibdar. Al HAUMA is about 22 miles of Um al Mudafa and 10 miles south of TJglat ibn S1GAI, See 1 Branch -iir Zeadqaurters, Iraq^ map of Basra Area of 19S9. The iimir HALF did not cross the BATIN and go to Athaiba and Ruhail till the end of May (and then only with a few tents). See para 46 of my Intelligence Summary No.4 for period 16th to 21st May 1934* 4. As regards Ilr.Chisholm r s evidence: I sent the latter a relevant extract of H.S.Nuri Pasha*s letter and asked for his comments. The enclosed reply speaks for itself. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lt.-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait.COPY, Kuwait* 16th ovember 1934. Dear Colonel Dickson, I am interested and amused to learn that my mention to you of having once met Iraqi armoured cars on the Kuwaxt-Safwan road within the Kuwait frontier now figures in official correspondence. I am much more interested, and much less amused, to find that by misrepresentation of the facts it is insinuated that my information was untrue or maliciously misleading* I can hardly let so unpleasant an insinuation be broadcast in official correspondence without co ment. 7 I do not know why it is represented that the armoured cars which I met were 'far removed from the straight Kuwait—Safwan road Tt . They were not: if they had been, I could not have met them. They were travelling at a good pace towards Kuwait on that very road; and I met them, being myself travelling towards Safwan, at a point some four miles on the Kuwait side of the large sign-board which notifies the Iraq-Kuwait boundary. 2 nay, except for reasons of advocacy, it should be imagined that I should be 'vexed' or 'dissatisfied' at these, or any other, proceedings of the Iraqi forces because of the confiscation of a present of cof.ee, sugar an&lt; tea to the sergeant at Safwan is incomprehensible. The only person likely to be vexed or dissatisfied was the sergeant. The present, (two pounds of coffee-beans, two loaves of sugar, and one pound of tea) was similar to those given from time to time for many years past, both by myself and other travellers on the road in return for the coffee and other courtesies given at this isolated post. In case it is next suggested that such presents were bribes, it should be noted that customs examination took place not atk ~ 2 ~ not at this post but at Zubair. The above facts show that there is no justification for the adroit but baseless insinuation that I supplied incorrect information for interested motives. Yours sincerely, id.

It will be seen from paragraph 2 of Mr.Chisholm's letter that the latter met the 1 Iraqi armoured cars on the road and not as stated in paragraph 6 of Nuri Pasha 1 s letter 'far removed from the straight Kuwait-Safwan road'. 3. Nuri rasha's further remarks in paragraph 5 of his letter anent Mr.Chisholm being 'vexed' over'the quantity of sugar, tea and coffee' incident, (explained by Mr.Chisholm in paragraph 3 of his letter) appear too absurd for comment, except perhaps the obvious one that they give me the personal impression that when important officials of the 'Iraq Govern- j ment /Government descend. t»o such trivialities tiie !
