Oil Royalty Rs. 30,00,000. The royalty on oil is estimated at the same amount as in last year's budget, which is Rs. '2,00,000 less than the actual amount received in 1358. Ks. 16,00,000 is due to the Government at the end of March 1940 for the six months which ended on 31-12-1939. I have assumed that during the first half of 1940 production will be maintained. 2.

Passport Receipts Rs. 10,000. Passport receipts last year produced Rs 18,000 but this income will not be maintained. Stricter enforcement of regulations, especially in the case of Persians resident in Bahrain and the cancelling of steamer passes for visitors to mail boats will rednce this source of revenue very considerably. 4. Judicial Receipts Rs. 8,000. There is no basis on which to estimate this revenue which depends upon the type of cases made in the courts. 5. Motor Vehicle Taxes Rs. 25,000. The revenue last year was Rs. 28,000. A reduction in the number of tax paying cars on the roads has been anticipated. 6. Land Revenue Rs. 25,000. This includes registration fees, leases, sales of land and aerodrome rent. Last year there were certain abnormal payments such as the price of land boughi by the Royal Air Force. 7. Interest on Reserve Rs. 1,89,000. This consists of interest at 3^% on £378,550, and interest for six months on Rs. 11,00,000 which it is proposed should be added to the reserve during the year. 8. Oil Gauging Fees Rs, 10,000. Fees paid for gauging oil which is shipped on tankers other than Bahrain Petroleum Company's own vessels. 9. Oil Concessions Payment Rs. 4,00,000.

The revenue of the State of Bahrain, the prosperity and almost the existence of the country, depends upon oil and pearls and neither the production nor the markets of these two commodities are controlled by the Bahrain Government. Both the oil industry and the pearl industry are likely to be affected by the European war. Although the war started in the eighth month of the Arabic year which is under review the disturbed conditions in Europe prior to the war affected Bahrain during the summer: no foreign buyers made important purchases of pearls during the year and the only activity in the Bahrain pearl market was caused by local merchants who gambled on the possibility of war causing a boom in pearls, as was the case in 1914-15. The royalty from oil in 1358 was Rs. 32,35,000 which was Rs. 3,00,000 less than in 1357. The total revenue was Es. 45,78,000 which was Rs. 2,33,000 less than in 1357. Expenditure in 1358 was Rs. 36,75,000 including the gift of 4 lakhs to the British Clovernment as a war contribution, Rs. 1,36,000, which was spent on purchasing rice as a war measure and payments to the Ruling Family amounting to Rs. 15,16,000. The total expenditure in 1357 was Rs. 31,00,000. In spite of less revenue and greater expenditure it was possible to add 10 lakhs to the Reserve Fund during the year bringing it up to Rs. 49,98,000. In the budget for 1358 I anticipated a serious decrease in customs revenue owing to developments on the mainland : the actual decrease was slight. I also assumed that 4 lakhs would be received in payment for an oil concession over the additional area but the payment was not made during the year. In the budget for 1359, which is the 14th budget that I have had the honour to submit, I anticipate a revenue of 45 lakhs, expenditure of 32 lakhs and a contribution to the Reserve Fund of 13 lakhs. Provision has been made for the cost of additional defence measures, for completing the Manamah-Muharraq causeway and bridge, the state hospital and for expansion of the technical and other schools. Conditions in Bahrain during the year were quiet. There was only one serious crime and no recrudescence of the political disturbances which ocurred in 1357. At the outbreak of war the Government took immediate steps to control the prices and the supplies of foodstuffs and necessities. This action was appreciated by the public and was imitated, rather late in the day, by neighbouring Arab States. The Government purchased 3,000 bags of rice from Rangoon in order to ensure a supply for the population in case of a shortage of food. Part of the rice was sold during the year and the remainder will be sold early in 1359. His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad at the beginning of the war and on subsequent occasions expressed his sympathy with the cause of the Allies and placed the resources of his state at the disposal of the British Government. The most important local event during the year was the visit to Bahrain of His Majesty King Abdulaziz al Faisal al Sa'ud who was accompanied by many of his sons and ministers. His visit demonstrated the friendly relations existing between the Rulers of Bahrain and Sa'udi Arabia. During the summer His Highness Shaikh Hamad spent a few weeks in Simla and Shaikh Mohammed bin Isa paid a visit to New York, being the first Bahrain Arab to visit America. There has been no change in the relations between Bahrain and Qattar. Bahrain, April 1940. C. DALRYMPLE BELGRAVE13 Note on Revenue 1358. The estimated revenue was Us. 42,41,500, the actual revenue was Rs. 45,78,600. With one exception the actual receipts from all sources equalled or exceeded the estimated amounts. The sum of Rs. 4,00,000 which was expected during the year on account of the oil concession over the additional area was not received during 1358; customs receipts however amounted to Rs. 4,28,000 more than had been anticipated and the oil royalty produced Rs. 2,35,000 more than the estimated revenue. Total revenue was Rs. 2,33,000 less than in 1357. The oil royalty decreased by approximately Rs. 3,00,000 and customs receipts were Rs. 60,000 less than in 1357. None of the sources of revenue require particular explanation except Land Revenue, Rfc. 75,000, which is abnormally high owing to the receipt of Rs. 34,000 from the Air Ministry on account of outstanding rents of the aerodrome and the price of land at Muharraq, sold to the Royal Air Force, of which the price of Government land was approximately Rs. 18,000. • Note on Expenditure 1358. Estimated expenditure for 1358 was Rs. 31,41,000, actual expenditure was Rs. 36,75,000. The difference between actual and estimated expenditure was mainly owing to the following reasons. His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad gave Rs. 4,00,000 to the British Govern ment towards the cost oi the war. The Bahrain Government purchased a large supply of rice, half of which was sold during the year. The value of the remainder at the end of the year was Rs. 1,36,C00. Although this sum is included in expenditrre for 1358 it may be regarded as an item of revenue for 1359 and has been shown in the estimated revenue for that year The expenditure on public protection was approximately Rs. 41,000 more than the estimated cost. The oil royalty amounted to more than the anticipated sum and therefore the one third which was paid to His Highness's Privy Purse was more than was provided in the 1358 budget. In spite of heavy unexpected expenditure the Reserve Fund was increased by Rs. 10,00,000. Allowances to the Ruling Family. Rs. 15,16,662. One third of the oil revenue paid direct to His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad amounted to Rs. 10,78,427, the remaining Rs. 4,38,235 represents Civil List pay ments to the Ruling Family. The total amount was about Rs. 1,00,000 less than last vear owing to decrease in oil revenue. J *-/ Adviserate. Rs. 66,499. Expenditure was approximately Rs. 7,000 less than the amount which was anticipated. Provision was made for an Assistant Adviser but the appointment was not made until after the beginning of the year.

Several vacant appointments in the customs staff were not filled and expendi ture was approximately Rs. 5,000 less than was expected.14 Judicial, Awkaf and Minors Departments. Rs. 54,177. Fxpenditnre was less than estimated but approximately Es. 7,000 more than .ist year.

Of this amount, Es. 5,91,000 was spent on works which were included in the budget, and Es. 44,000 on new work approved and sanctioned during the year but not provided for in the budget. In most cases the expenditure exceeded the estimated amount but this was frequently due to additions to and extensions of the original plans, especially in the case of the hospital buildings and the pier extensions. 1. Manamah-Muharraq Swing Bridge. Rs. 59,463. The contract was made during the current year. A sum of Es. 3,00,000 was provisionally included in the budget before it was known how much thfi bridge would cost. The contract price was Es. 3,82,000 of which Es. 59,000 was paid during J 358. A sum of Es 35,000 was budgeted for extending the two ends of the sea road to the pier terminals. The woik was done by the Manamah and Muharraq municipalities and the cost was Es. 61,376. Each side cost approximately the same amount. 2. Hospital Buildings. Rs. 2,35,000. The amount provided in the budget was Es. 2,57,000. The dispensary was entirely completed, the women's hospital and staff quarters were almost finished, and considerable progress was made with the men's hospital. Foundations of the administrative building were finished and various additional buildings, such as boiler house etc., were completed. The cost of building was very much more than was estimated owing to the need for deep foundations: in part of the ground it was found necessary to build twelve feet deep before reaching solid ground. The work which is still to be done consists of completion of men's hospitals, the administrative block which includes operation theatre etc., and various walls and outhouses. Manamah Pier extension. Rs.1,01,588 The explanation of the additional expenditure and work is given under Public Works Department. Pier Trolley Lines. Rs. 16,718.

Two additional rooms were added to the Manamah boys' school and another room and a yard were built at the western end of the Technical School. Transport Department. Rs. 12,379. The expenditure includes the cost of one large additional garage and two Hats above the Transport Building. The flats are occupied by the staff of the Electric Department. Passport Office. Rs. 13,416. The existing passport office was converted into a Post Office and let to the Indian Postal Department, and a new Passport Office was built at the western end16 of the Customs house facing the square. The building consists of one large office, a small office and a record room. The reconstruction of the Post Office entailed more expense than was anticipated. Miscellaneous. Rs. 4,296. A flight of stone steps was built in front of the central tower of the Palace and the old wooden stairs were removed ; a steel folding door was put into the archway at the head of the steps and a wooden door was fixed on the back stairs so that the Majlis and guest rooms could be locked separately. Mosque at Hawar. Rs. 3,250. A. small mosque was built in the northern village at Hawar and various water cisterns were repaired. Kozabia House. Rs. 4,485.

The extension of the experimental garden at Budeya necessitated more drains for surplus water. Annual Repairs. Rs. 17,770. Various special repairs not anticipated in the budget were carried out and included under this heading. Road Repairs. Rs. 19,298. This includes the cost of metalling the Customs square and part of the sea road.

The Pearl Industry. The Pearl Industry. During the last war there was a boom in pearls and many Bahrain merchdnts made small fortunes. When the present war began some of the local dealers imagined that the pearl market would improve because of the war. This, in my opinion, is unlikely. Twenty-five years ago the cultured pearl had not appeared m the market: a pearl was a pearl and there was no question of its being a cultured pearl. The war has now lasted long enough to show that a sudden improvement in pearl prices is improbable. Again there was a serious decrease in the number of the boats which went out diving and a drop in the value of the catch although the quantity of pearls found was greater than last year and the quality of the pearls was unusually fine. Pearls were bought from the boats at less than last year's prices but merchants sold their goods at better prices towards the end of the season. The divers and nakhudas had a bad season but the merchants and brokers did not fare badly. The total number of the boats licensed during the year was 219 which is 33 less than in 1357. The amount received by the divers and nakhudas for their pearls was approximately Rs. 6,25,000. This sum is calculated from actual figures of boat17 accounts which are recorded and a proportional calculation of boats whose accounts are not recorded. The following table shows the decline of the pearl industry ; Year No. of boats Approx. value of catch 1856 271 Rs. 13,22,000 1357 252 „ 7,56,000 1358 219 „ 6,25,000 The market in Bahrain was affected by the disturbed conditions in Europe before the war and then by the war itself. The only foreign buyer of note to visit Bahrain was Mr. S. Pack who returned to France at the outbreak of war without having done much business. The pick of the season's catch was bought by the firm of Abdulaziz Gosaibi and Brothers who, with no important competitors, were able to acquire a quantity of very fine pearls at a low price, but in order to do this the Gosaibis used all their available capital and credit. It remains to be seen whether this big gamble in pearls by a local dealer results in profit or loss. One outstanding pearl was found which weighed 204 chows : it was larger than the famous £ 15,000 pearl from Bahrain which was eventually bought some ycasr ago by Barbara Hutton, the Woolworth heiress. The pearl was sold by the nakhuda for Rs. 35,000 and the shares of the men in the boat were, divers, Rs. 475 and pullers, Rs. 317. The two main diving systems are Salafieh and Khammas ; men diving in Salafieh boats take advances. Out of 72 Salafieh boats only 36 covered their expenses and advances. The Khammas divers were somewhat better off. The Hahrain Court in dealing with the estate case of the late Ali bin Saggar, at one time one of the leading pearl merchants of Muharraq, financed a diving boat which belonged to the heirs. The accounts were kept by the Court. This boat had a fairly successful season and found pearls which were sold for Rs. 7,265. The ex penses amounted to Rs. 1,563 not including the advances, and the final share of a diver was Rs. 80/8/3 and a puller Rs. 53/10/10, but the advances received by the divers and puller amounted to Rs. 50 and Hs. 40 respectively. The following summary of the diving account of this boat is typical of the Salafieh diving system. Account from diving boat of Ali bin Saggar. The crew consisted of the nakhuda, 29 divers, 35 pullers and one radif (apprentice). Diving was carried on throughout the season with only one visit to shore : there were 130 diving days. The expenses for the season amounted to Rs. 1,563 including Rs. 100 for the diving license, paid to the Government. Included in the cost of provisioning the boat were rice, dates, ghee, firewood, tea, coffee, sugar, kerosene, dried lemon ( used to prevent scurvy) ropes, porterage, knives (for opening shells) lamps, pails, cooking pots, ginger, pepper, a goat (killed on the day the boat set off) and purgatives. The pearls were divided into seven lots, each lot being kept separate for the purpose of accounts because some divers did not work all through the season. I hey were sold in one transaction to one buyer for Rs. 7,260. The final account was as follows :— Government Tax Nakhuda's share being one fifth of the sale price 1 Expenses Share of divers „ „ pullers „ „ radif Each diver received „ puller „ .. radif Rs. 100 1433 1463 2341 1799 26 80/ 8/ 3 (3 shares) 53/10/10 (2 shares) 26/13/ 5 (1 share)18 But the three advances received by the divers and pullers amounted to Rs. 50 and Hs. 40. respectively.

In America much publicity was given to Bahrain pearls during the year. Newspapers and periodicals published articles and illustrations on the subject of pearls emphasising the great difference between pearls and cultured pearls. Reports from the Alellon Institute dealing with cultured pearls were given prominence in the American press, and the visit of Shaikh IVIohammed bin Isa to New York as the guest of the Standard Oil Company of California was made the occasion for further propaganda in favour of pearls. Unfortunately the war is likely to affect the results which may have been obtained from this advertisment.19 Police and Public Security. 1. Police Administration. (a) Strength.

Most of the additional naturs were employed on defence measures. (b) Recruitment. After the war began there was some difficulty in obtaining the necessary number of suitable recruits conforming in height and physical standard to the Police requirements. This was partly due to a rumour which was circulated locally that the men might be sent abroad for military service and partly owing to the unpopularity of service at the Refinery and in the oil fields. If the standard of height and physical fitness had been lowered plenty of men could have been enlisted but this was considered undesirable. (c) Routine. Until the war began the Police carried out their usual procframme of duties and training as in previous years. In the spring they spent about a week in camp near Budeya where they did extended order drill and attack practices etc. The camel section was almost incessantly on patrol along the coasts of Bahrain, the horse section was in camp near Jenabeya for about a month. The route march in the autumn was abandoned owing to the war. The rifle range was in constant use and several recruit sections completed their training. Until September the usual posts and guards were maintained, employing about 85 N.C.Os. and men.20 Daring the visit of His Majesty King Ibn Sa'ud the Police supplied special guards and escorts and performed a ceremonial parade in front of the Palace on which they were w T armly congratulated by His Majesty. They also presented a torchlight tattoo and spectacle on the last night of the Royal visit which was enthusiastically received by an audience of many thousands of people and appeared to make a great impression on the Arab guests from Sa'udi Arabia. (d) Defence Duties. From the day that war began the Police with a number of specially enlisted naturs took over the duty of guarding the Refinery, Oil Field and Bahrain Petroleum Company s works, and special guards consisting of Police and naturs were posted at various'places in and around Manamah. The Police worked in conjunction with and under orders of the specially appointed personnel of the Bahrain Petroleum Company staff who were employed on the defence scheme. Their duties included car patrols, camel patrols, and guards on gates, tanks and pine terminals etc. There were three sections of recruits in training when the war started and it was difficult to obtain the necessary number of men for duty with the Bahrain Petroleum Company and to carry on the normal Police work at the same time. All leave was stopped and men who had served their contracted time in the Police 1- orce and who wished to be discharged were not allowed to leave. Later, men who had earned leave were given one month's leave pay as a temporary measure. Granting of leave and discharge has not been resumed. In spite of this it was necessary at first for a number of men to remain on duty at the Refinery and Oil T' ield for six weeks continously. At the beginning there was some difficulty over arranging rations and accomodation for the Police and as the men were sent out at a few hours notice they were unable to make arrangements for their families who lived in the Fort married lines or in Manamah and Muharraq. After a month or two conditions improved and it was possible to make more satisfactory and more permanent arrangments. The camel section wes relieved by Police mounted on motor bicycles and the section which had been stationed on a barge at the sea terminal of the pipe line, three miles from shore, was brought back ; the total number of Police on defence duty was reduced and the number of naturs was increased. Although the duties of the Police on the defence scheme were not arduous, merely monotonous, the new conditions in which they found themselves were difficult. For the first time they had to deal with and to work under Englishmen and Americans whose language and methods they did not understand. There were misunderstandings and complaints on both sides. The Police suffered from being gi\en orders b^ a number of dn^erent people in authority, usually through interpreters, which often seemed to them unintelligible and contradictory. Eventually how ever the Police became accustomed to their new duties and to the Europeans employed in the defence scheme and the work proceeded more smoothly. (e) Health of the Police. During the year 1358 a total number of 6,172 Police were seen at sick parade giving an average of 17 approximately out of a force of 347. Last year the average sick parade was 10 out of a force of 316. In 1358 there were 2160 malaria cases but many of the cases were recurrent. There was less malaria among the Police than in former years due to the anti-malaria measures in the adjacent gardens which used to be one of the worst mosquito breeding places in the neighbourhood of Manamah. Last year ulceration of the legs was responsible for 28% attendance at sick parade An experiment, which proved very successful, was made during the summer when the wearing of puttees was discontinued. This reduced leg sores very considerably. J v u • Ir ! fant WeIfare Clime. The clinic was continued throughout the year. It is held in the married lines by Mrs. Belgrave and a Government nurse. Over 1 100 cases were dealt with. The Policemen's families are gradually being taught to21 appreciate proper medical attention and to make use of the Government midwives whose services are given freely to the wives of Policemen. (/) Mounted Sections. The camel section maintained patrols around the coast continously throughout the year except when employed on patrolling the oil field. The cavalry section carried out some patrols and acted as mounted escort on various state occasions. During the summer the section was under canvas for several weeks near Budeya. A number of the horses were out of action during the year owing to a bad epidemic of strangles which is thought to have been introduced by five new horses which were bought from Iraq. (^) Machine Gun Section and Motor Bicycle Section. The Government pur chased a dozen Vickers Berthier machine guns during the year and a machine gun section consisting of 13 men and 3 N.C.Oa. was trained. Another section was under training at the end of the year Captain H. Ranee, of the Indian Army, and an Indian Havildar instructor who was lent for three months by the Government of India, gave instruction to the Police. A course was fired on the new machine gun range at Safra and the result was satisfactory. One N.C.O. and 8 men were trained as a motor bicycle section by Mr. H. D. Furber. The Police already had two B.S.A. motor bicycles, and five new Norton bicycles were bought in India, one of them having a side car. The bicycles were first-class machines, some of them of the type used for racing in England: they were adjusted in such a way that their speed was reduced. When the patrol work began at the oil field there were frequent accidents and several of the riders were damaged but after some practice they acquired a certain degree of efficiency. (h) Buildings. Details of buildings are given in the Public Works Department report. They included new barrack rooms, a kitchen and mess hall, and the rebuilding of part of the Fort wall. The improvement in the health of the Police is probably partly due to the increased cleanliness of the Fort and the adequate sanitary arrangements and washing facilities. More phower baths and more latrines were being installed at the end of the year. The old buildings of rubble walls and mud floors were dark and dirty and it was impossible to keep them clean and free from mosquitoes. (i) Promotions and Appointments. Shaikh Khalifah, son of Shaikh Mohammed bin Isa, and a nephew of His Highness Shaikh Hamad, was appointed Superintendent of Police after completing his training in India. Havildar Abdul Karim, son of the late Superintendent of Police, Haji Sulman bin Jasirn, was sent to the Police Training School at Nasik. 3 Lance Naiks were promoted to Naiks. 11 Policemen were promoted to Lance Naiks. 2. Naturs. Before the war little attention was given to the training and the recruitment of the naturs who were in fact night watchmen similar to the ghaflQrs in Egypt. Although provided with rifles and ammunition few of them were efficient in the use of firearms and they were not required to pass any physical test when enlisted. Their work, however, for the last twenty years has been satisfactory and owing to them the number of thefts and robberies in Manamah and Muharraq has been small. When the war began and the defence scheme came into operation it was considered advisable to reorganise the naturs and to give them some training. On examination 70% of the men failed to pass the eye test. These men are now being replaced by men who are physically fit and whose sight is satisfactory. They are being trained to use firearms and they have to pass a musketry course. They are also being given some drill under men among them who had previously served in the Police.22 3. Traffic Control. There has been a further decrease in motor accidents. No. of accidents No. of persons killed investigated. in motor accidents. 1356 56 6 1357 20 2 1358 12 . 2 The public are acquiring more road sense and drivers are driving more carefully. Road and driving regulations are being strictly enforced by the Police and public vehicles are frequently inspected. It is now mainly on public holidays that wild and reckless driving is conspicuous: on these occasions local drivers appear to suffer from a species of dementia. .The number of motor vehicles registered during the year was 521: the number of licensed drivers is 774, and 183 new drivers were tested and passed in 1358. 4. Crime. A U T t !f r ? wa8 littl ® cr 'T d,lriQ g 'he year. One murder took place ; a mainland Arab killed a prositute, he was tried, convicted and executed. Towards the end of the year there was an increase in the number of thefts in Manamah which was considered by some people to be due to changes in the personnel of the nature A number of prosecutions were made under the regulations for the control of nrices and sale of foodstuffs. ^ Altogether 469 persons were charged with criminal offences during 1368 of whom 182 were foreigners. In the case of Bahrain subjects all criminal oomp laints are inolnded, in this figure even those of the slightest importance. Number of cases of violence ... 86 „ of cases of theft ... 53 „ of persons convicted ... 355 „ of persons discharged ... 114 Miscellaneous There was a decrease in liquor cases which is partly due to the restriotinn. which were placed on the sale of scents and lotions etc. which contained a Ch percentage of alcohol.

(23 The medical staff at the end of the year, not including menial staff, was as follows :— British Staff. Lady Medical Officer Matron Indian Staff. Sub Assistant Surgeons Dispensers Laboratory Assistant Nurse Malaria staff ftemporaryj Local Staff. Compounder Dressers Clerks Registrars Driver Females (local) Clerk Interpreter Helpers It was hoped that the Women's Hospital would be opened during the year, but the building took longer than was expected and will not be ready for use until the spring. Medical work during the year has been confined mainly to village dispensaries and clinics and to the anti-malaria campaign. The increasing use of the govern ment clinics by the public makes the people familiar with the medical staff and accustomed to medical treatment and should encourage them to make use of the hospital when it is opened. Without a proper hospital or operating and X-Ray facilities it has been difficult for the medical staff to carry out the work during the year. Cases requiring surgical treatment have frequently been taken over by the Mission Hospital whose X-Ray apparatus has been constantly made use of by the Government doctors. The purchase of an X-Ray apparatus is under consideration and provision is being made for an X-Ray room in the Administrative Block of the hospital. The quarantine work continued to be carried out by Dr. Holmes, m.b.e , the Quarantine Medical Officer. No cases of plague or cholera were reported during the year. The following report has been submitted by the Medical Department. 1. The Village Dispensaries. Work at the village dispensaries has continued throughout the year and two new dispensaries were opened. The Naim out-patient clinic was held at the police hospital until June 27th, when the Government hospital dispensary was opened and civilian men, women and children were treated there in addition to police. A new women and children's clinic was started at Rafaa on July 2nd. The school premises were used once a week during the school holidays for three months, later an Arab house was leased as a dispensary. On November 27th the women's side of Naim Government dispensary was opened and morning clinics were held there four days24 weekly. In addition to work at Suk-al-Khamis the doctor there visits, weekly, the villages of Budeya, Karzakan, Sitra and Rafa.

Health As there is no compulsory registration of births and deaths in Bahrain it is not possible to give very detailed information about the health of the people, but examination of several thousands of outpatients at the dispensaries gives some in dication of the diseases prevalent in the island. No epidemic has occurred during the year. A comparison of diseases amongst the male and female population shows that in the main they suffer from the same general diseases :— Malaria General disease Respiratory „ Alimentary „ Eye diseases Ear nose and throat Ulcers Women's diseases Atresia Rheumatic disease Men 21% 2% 11% 10% 19% 5% 8% 6% Women 12% 10% 13% 20% 20% 10% 3% 10%'25 Malaria. Attendance at the clinics Bhows that approximately 20% of patients are diagnosed as suffering from Malaria. This figure is 12% lower for women. Many women suffering from the complaint are too ill to attend the clinics. They not uncommonly suffer from severe Malaria for six months to a year before seeking advice, then they are very ill and in an advanced stage of anaemia. Eye disease. 20% of all cases attending the clinics suffer from eye disease- Trachoma, Keratitis, Ophthalmia, Cataract are the commonest eye complaints. It is hoped that child welfare clinics and school treatment clinics will help to teach the people that eye diseases can be cured and need not be a permanent disability. Ear diseases. This constitutes 20% of cases attending the women's clinics. Otorrhea or discharging ears is very common among young children. It is gratifying to see that the parents are beginning to realise that it can be cured. Respiratory disease. Bronchial asthma is the commonest respiratory complaint in the island. The diet of the people, combined with climatic conditions, is responsible for this. It is particularly common among the Persian community. Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Fifteen cases were diagnosed at Nairn. The help of the laboratory is invaluable in diagnosing this complaint as is also an X-Ray apparatus. Bone, joint, and glandular tuberculosis is found among children, particularly those who visit the island from Arabia, Venereal disease. Constitutes . 02% of the diseases treated. Since laboratory tests have been instituted more accurate diagnosis of these diseases will be possible. Of 133 blood examinations made for the Klein test for syphilis 84 were positive, i.e., 64% of the examinations made. A special clinic is held on Wednesday afternoons for the treament of these diseases. Patients are reluctant to attend for a full course of treatment and so do not benefit as they should. Small-Pox. No case of small-pox was reported in Bahrain throughout the year. Many vaccinations of civilian adults and children were done at the dispensaries and school children. Boys and girls found unvaccinated at the school inspections were subsequently vaccinated with the consent of their parents. Alimentary diseases. Dyspepsia, carious teeth and worms are some of the complaints treated under this heading. Complete lack of knowledge about personal hygiene is responsible for these complaints. The care of the teeth is unknown among the Arabs in Bahrain. Only . 06 of patients attended the clinics suffering from dysentery. Rheumatic disease. This is common among the adult population. 7.5% of the school girls w T ere found to be suffering from circulatory disease in Manamah, one of the results of rheumatic fever. Gynaecological and Obstetrical diseases. Some remarks must be made on a gynaecological condition peculiar to women on this island, e.g., Vaginal Atresia. This is an acquired condition due to the practice prevalent among the Arab community of using slabs of salt after a confinement. No fewer than 243 patients suffering from this complaint came to the clinic at Muharraq. In a total of 84 confinements 79 were found to be suffering from Atresia which complicated the confinement. This practice causes permanent suffering and disablement to the patients : it makes child-birth impossible without artificial aid and so contributes to producing a high maternal and infant mortality rate.26 3. Medical examination of school children. The boys' schools were examined in Bahrain once during the year as was also the girls' school. The main diseases and defects from which the children were found to be suffering are shown on the following tables ;— Boys' Schools. School No. of scholars examined Enlarged spleen Scarring from Small-pox Advanced disease of the eye Carious teeth.

He suggested that all boys unvaccinated should be vaccinated, subject to the consent of the parents. This was carried out. He also stated that medical inspection of the school27 children should be carried out bi-annually. In view of the high incidence of malaria, eye disease and malnutrition among the school boys, this recommendation would appear to be necessary. School boys who are ill, attend Naim Government Dispensary for treatment, on the advice of the headmaster of the school. The number of children suffering from diseases and defects in the girls' school is high. For this reason a weekly school treatment clinic is held in Manamah School and a Nurse attends bi-weekly at Muharraq school to give treatment. It is hoped that in this way minor ailments will be treated and much chronic disease prevented. The attention to general hygiene is part of the teaching given by the Nurse; no less than 37.3% of children in Manamah school were suffering from unclean heads. All children found to be unvaccinated were, subject to consent of parents, vaccinated in the schools. Malaria, Respiratory disease and Enlarged Tonsils and Adenoids, are the main diseases from which the children suffer. Children with the latter complaint are prone to attacks of Tonsillitis and Bronchitis. These in turn interfere with nutrition and growth. General malnutrition is common : 25% of children in Manamah school suffer from this complaint. 4. Health of the Police. During the year 1358 a total number of 6,172 police attended the police out patient clinic : this is a higher number than last year, but the strengh of the police force has increased from 321 to 347. The following table gives information about the diseases for which the police were treated :— Malaria ... 35.1% 4-2% 2.5% 3.5% 8.6% 1.2 ' 2.1% 7.3% 15.8% 16.6° 1.8% •3% 1.0% Rheumatism Dysentery Diseases of the Alimentary system „ Respiratory „ „ Skin „ Tooth „ Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Surgical diseases Ulcers Gonorrhoea T.B. Syphilis Other diseases The average daily number of in-patients at the police dispensary was 8. The following shows the diseases from which they suffered. Malaria ... 52.1% Pneumonia ... 2.8% Surgical diseases ... 17 4% Diseases of the Respiratory system ... 8.7% „ Alimentary „ ... 10.8% „ Nervous „ ... .7% „ Urinary „ ... 1.1% „ Syphilis „ ... .7% „ Gonorrhoea „ ... 2.4% „ Typhoid Fever „ ... .3% T. B. „ ... 1.0% „ Other diseases „ ... 2.1%28 As in the previous year Malaria was the main cause of ill health of 35.1% out-patient and in-patients : ulceration of the legs was the second main cause of complaint of the out-patients and respiratory and alimentary disease of the in patients. Three cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were treated as in-patients. It is hoped that in the future, facilities will be available to segregate advanced cases of pulmonary tuberculosis from other hospital patients. One case of enteric was treated in the Police hospital. There were no fatalities among the police this year. Infant welfare clinic. The weekly clinic for policemen's children was con tinued throughout the year. The women find it as popular a clinic as the children, and present themselves for treatment. The number of women and children who attended in 1358 was 1143. Prisoners* health. The doctor from Suk-al-Khamis pays a weekly visit to the prisoners at Jeda Island. Any patients who are ill are brought to the mainland to the police hospital for treatment. Several patients with dysentery were sent in this year. 5. Malaria. In order to interest the citizens of Bahrain on the question of Malaria control, it was decided by the Government to invite prominent citizens to serve on an Anti- Malaria Committee. The progress of Anti-Malaria work done can best be estimated by following the work of this committee throughout the latter half of the year. The first meeting of the Anti-Malaria Committee was held at the Government Hospital, Manamah, on 11th July 1939. In view of the prevalence' of Malaria infection in Bahrain (60% school children being infected), particularly in Manamah, it was decided first to commence anti-malaria operations in Manamah. (a) Removal of shalloiv wells breeding mosquitoes. It was recognised that shallow wells in compounds should be removed and an alternative water supply provided. Meantime breeding was to be controlled in wells by putting fish in the wells. A hatchery for fish was established in the Manamah Municipal garden, (b) Draining of stagnant water. The committee was informed that attempts were being made to deal with swamps by means of vertical drainage. (c) Irrigation ditches and drains in gardens. These are a prolific source of mosquito breeding. It was pointed out that all owners should keep their ditches clean, in good condition and properly graded. (dj Anti-Malaria.propaganda. The necessity for effective anti-malaria propaganda among the population was discussed and agreed upon. (e) Grant of Funds. Funds for expenditure on malaria control were provided by a special grant under Public Health in the Government Budget. The second meeting of the Anti-Malaria Committee was held on September 16, 1939. The minutes of the last meeting were read and approved. (a) The State Engineer reported that experiments in vertical drainage of swamps had received some measure of success. He reported progress regarding the grouping of artesian wells in Manamah city. As a trial measure four wells were linked up. The amount of water available from the four wells when they were linked up was approximately 23,000 gallons an hour., i.e., 552,000 gallons per day. It was decided by the committee that no dwelling should be more than 600 feet from a source of water supply and that each terminal should be provided with wash houses, each with 6 taps for men and women.29 (b) The State Medical Officer reported experiments made in. introducing fish into shallow domestic wells and recomended the filling in of large swamps where vertical drainage had failed. He also proposed that an anti-larval squad should be organised to clean drains, and distribute oil and paris green. (c) Three sub-committees were formed—executive, finance, and propa ganda committees. A third meeting of the Anti-Malaria Committee was held on December 14th. The minutes of the last meeting were approved and the committee considered the following reports. (a) The report of the work done by the anti-malaria supervisor and the two insect collectors. (b) The report of the State Engineer. The latter stated that No. 1 group of wells had been linked up and washing places built at Juma Mosque Momin Mosque Hussein Wavi's quarter (under construction) He stated that steps could now be taken to close all the house wells within a radius of 600 feet from points A. and B. A discussion followed as to the closing of the house wells and the disposal of waste water in compounds. As six weeks had passed since the date of the last meeting it was decided to include detailed reports on the work of the supervisor and insect collectors in the report. These are full reports of the work they have done since they came from India—29th November 1939 to 3rd February 1940. The amount of work accom plished in two months has been considerable. It resolves itself into five by groups. A. Breeding gangs. B. Oil and paris green distributors. C. Fish distributors. D. Garden and compound and house inspection by the insect collectors. E. Collection of adult mosquitoes. The work affects the whole populations in their gardens and houses and at last the people are beginning to realise that Malaria is a preventable disease which can be eradicated if every one will co-operate. Land Registration Department. Registrations. The total number of registrations of all kinds carried out during the year was 573 including 361 sales, 129 titles, 82 gifts and 1 wakf. The revenue from registrations etc. was Rs. 6,179. Last year 710 properties were registered. The registration of transfers of immoveable property by sale or by gift is compulsory but the registration of titles is optional. Since 1343, when this Depart ment began its work, over eight thousand transactions have been registered. Iranian Properties. The Land Department dealt with the property of certain Iranians which was taken over by the Government in accordance with the nationality and property law, in most cases the properties were resold to Bahrain subjects, sometimes at a lower price than the purchase price. Island Beacons. The stone beacons on the reefs and isles surrounding Bahrain were inspected and, when necessary, repaired. The only one found to be in really bad condition was the beacon on Qat'at al-Jaradah. Survey Students. Three young men from Government schools who had worked for some time in the Land Department were sent to Calcutta to take a course of survey work etc., with the Indian Government Survey Department. At the end of the year they were still in India. Apart from registrations very little survey work has been done during the year.30 Judicial. CASES HEARD DURING THE YEAR. Bahrain Courts. Land cases Civil suits Criminal cases Pending cases 230 82 215 95 Total 622 Bahrain Small Courts. New cases Pending cases 700 210 Total 910 Total court fees collected from all courts Rs. 9,000—12—6. Thirteen cases were referred by the Bahrain Courts to the Majlis Tijara and six cases were transferred to the Shia and seventy-five to the Sunni Shara Courts. All the cases sent to the Sunni Shara Court are pending. Two important estate cases were dealt with by the Bahrain Court, those of the deceased Aly bin Sagar and Ahmed bin Saad. The estate of the bankrupt Khalifah bin Khammis al Gharair and his late brother Kashid bin \ usuf has been partly disposed of, but the matter is complicated as the surviving brother, who possesses the pearls which form the bulk of the proper ty, is in Bombay and is unlikely to return to Bahrain. The court dealt with the divers of eight other cases and collected their earnings for the creditors. 1 he number of appeal cases increased to about forty and there were six appeals from the Shia Shara Court to the Appeal Qadi. Live cases ^\ere transferred to the Department of Minors which administered the property on behalf of the minor heirs. There is still criticism of the Bahrain Courts. There always will be criticism but it will decrease when a regular code is introduced. Attempts were made durin^ the year to obtain expert legal advice on drawing up a code but no suitable person was found to undertake this work. In criminal cases the court follows more closely than before the Sudan Penal Code which is in Arabic and which has been found by experience to be a suitable guide for most of the cases which are dealt with. This code could be easily adapted for use in Bahrain but the procedure code would require considerable simplification. In many cases the court acts according to precedent establised in previous cases. The aged Shia Qadi, Shaikh Ali bin Hasan tendered his resignation on account of his failing health. In fact he had been incapable of carrying out his duties for some time before his final retirement. He was granted a pension of Rs 50 per month and retired to live in Qatif where he owned property. During his tenure of office he was a loyal servant of the Government. No other Shia Qadi was appointed. Shaikhs Bakr and Mohomed Ali, under the supervision of Shaikh Abdul Hussein al Hilli, now form the Shia Shara Court. This arrangement appears to be satisfactory. The Sunni Shara Court has been the subject of some criticism owing to its slowness in dealing with cases.31 Manama Municipality. Eevenue Expenditure Municipalities. ... Es, 1,04,544. „ 95,133. 1. Anti Malaria Measures. The municipal authorities, under the Secretary, Mohamed Saleh, did much valuable work in assisting the prosecution of the anti-malaria compaign both by propaganda, by distributing oil, and by allocating Rs. 8,000 from the municipal funds which had been set aside for medical work towards filling in the swamp on the south west of Manama near the Wireless Station. The Municipality constructed, on behalf of the Government, a drain from the Palace Garden to the sea which removed much of the standing water in that area. 2. Widening and Constructing town roads. The important road connecting the fruit and vegetable markets with Barrett Road was completed and is in use, and in various other parts of the bazaar streets were widened by demolishing buildings or reducing their depth. Nine shops were removed, 2H shops and 14 houses had their frontages reduced in order to widen streets, and 14 new shops were built and given, as compensation, to owners whose property had been affected. Public opinion regarding widening streets has changed in the last few years. In the past it was usually strongly opposed by the owners of property but to-day landlords willingly submit to losing several feet from the frontage of their shops in order that the streets where shops are situated should be made wide enough for motor traffic. 3. New Road. A new road was made from the western end of the Sea Road to the Govern ment Hospital. Part of a garden and a boat yard were acquired in exchange for a narrow strip of land in order that the new road should be straight. 4. Water Cart. The Municipality purchased a new water cart combined with fire engine with a capacity of 500 gallons which is always ready for service, day or night. 5. Road Metalling. The work of metalling the Customs Square and the road from the square to Municipal Road was completed. The result, as far as it can be judged, was satisfactory but the cost was high : it worked out at approximately Rs. 0—4—0 per square foot. The Municipality was given a special grant for this experiment. 6. Lease of Markets. The Municipality leased from His Highness Shaikh Hamad the vegetable and fruit bazaars and the open market, shops and stalls etc., which were previously let to private contractors. By doing this the Municipality obtained more authority over the markets which can be kept cleaner than before . 7. Swamp Reclamation. The work of filling the swampy ground behind the Arabian Mission was continued : 72,000 square feet of stone were used for this purpose. 8. Miscellaneous. During the year large numbers of trees were planted along the main roads of the town including casuarinas and a species of ficus. Twelve additional street lamps were installed and two new tanks, fitted with taps, were built. Town rubbish was used for filling in areas of water, belonging to the Municipality, between the Sea Road and Prior Road.32 Wakf Departments. Shia Wakf Department- Revenue Rs. 24,430. The revenue increased by approximately Rs. 6,000. The total expenditure was Rs. 22,000 of which one half was spent on Mateme and about Rs. 6,000 on repairs and upkeep of wakf house property, mosques, gardens and mats, lights and equipment of mosques During the year 900 new date trees were planted and much work was done in wakf gardens after inspection by the committee. Sunni Wakf Department. Revenue Rs. 24,860, The Sunni Wakf Department consists of the Sunni Kadis and clercial staff. There is no wakf committee. Two-thirds of the revenue is from house property in Manama and Muharraq and the reminder from gardens. Most of the wakf income is paid to the persons officiating in the mosques. Very little was spent on upkeep of wakf property or purchasing new property. Education. School Reforms and appointment of Director of Education. Important changes were made in the Education Department during the year 1358. In the first month of the year the Inspector of Schools, Mr. Faik Adham, tendered his resignation, which was accepted, and he and his wife, who was the head-mistress of Manama Girls School, left Bahrain. For the remaining three months of the school term no Inspector was appointed. A short time before the end of the term the Bahrain Government arranged for Mr. C.R.L. Adrian-Vallance, of the Iraq Government Education Department, to visit Bahrain in order to report on the state of Education and to make suggestions for improving the schools. Mr. Adrian-Vallance produced a valuable and comprehensive report in which be described the state of schools as he found them and made detailed suggestions for their improvement. He found one outstanding feature, the comparative neglect of village schools in comparison to the big schools in Manama and Muharraq. Among the reasons for lack of scholastic efficiency he mentioned bad health, especially eyesight, irregular attendance, premature leaving, overcrowded classes, lack of modern methods of teaching, and absence of sound grounding. His suggestions for improvements included a scheme for dividing the educational life of a boy into three stages, infant stage, intermediate stage and final stage, entailing separate infant schools in Manama and Muharraq and a new final school open only to bright boys who qualify by examination and who, unless given a scholarship, pay school fees. This scheme has been approved and will be adopted at the beginning of the 1359 new school term. It means that a dull boy would not attend school for more than 4 years (age 6-10) and an intellegenb boy would be able to leave when he is 15 years old, after being at school for nine years having learned all that the schools can teach him. In November Mr. Adrian-Vallance was appointed, through the British Council, which pays the greater part of his salary, as Director of Education to the Bahrain Government. Mr. Adrian-Vallance took over the administration of the school and began to make various improvements, especially in the country schools, but important changes, such as separating infants and primary students in different buildings, are deferred until the next school term.33 The appointment of a British Director of Education, which had been advocated by many Arabs in the past, was almost universally popular and resulted in a steady increase in boys in all schools so that by the end of the year it became increasingly difficult to accomodate the number of students. Technical School. Progress of boys at the Technical School continued to be satisfactory. A number of boys, trained as carpenters, left after their two years course and obtained employment locally, some being taken on by the Public Works Department. Boys in the Engineering class did practical work in the Government Garage and the Power House. The Kuwait Oil Company asked permission to send two paying pupils to the school and at the end of the year arrangements were made for them to be admitted. One of the main difficulties in making the school as successful as it should be is the low educational standard of the boys who enter it. Although the school is part of the Education Department it continues to be under the supervision of Mr. W.B. Steele, the State Engineer. Next year it is proposed to enlarge the school again and to increase the number of subjects which are being taught there. Arrangements were made at the end of the year for Mr. G. E. Hutchings, Director of the Baghdad Technical School, to visit Bahrain and advise the Government about the expansion of the Technical School. It has been a year of transition in the Education Department and the results of the changes will not begin to be apparent until the end of the next term. Female Education. At the end of the year there were three Girls Schools in existence, Manama, Muharraq and Hedd, whose attendances respectively were 190, 150 and 85 pupils. The school at Hedd, which is the third largest town in Bahrain, was opened towards the end of the year. At the beginning of the school term Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa, Minister of Education, appointed Mrs. Belgrade as voluntary inspector of Girls' Schools. The headmistress of the Manama school, who was the wife of the previous Inspector of Education, left Bahrain when her husband returned to Syria. The other Syrian teacher in the Manama school was appointed headmistress. The teaching staff is now as follows: Manama, one Syrian headmistress and seven local teachers, (one of them was trained as a teacher in Beyrout); Muharraq, a Syrian headmistress, one Syrian teacher and five local teachers (the headmistress and one of the local teachers were trained in Syria) ; in Hedd, three local teachers. The following subjects are taught in Manama and Muharraq : Quran, religion, arithmetic, geography, history, poetry, Arabic reading, writing and grammar and composition, hygiene, domestic science, embroidery, designing and kindergarten handwork. English is taught only in the senior classes. Dressmaking, mothercraft and cooking are taught in Moharraq where there is a more qualified head mistress than in Manama. At Hedd only Quran, religion, reading, writing, arithmetic and embroidery are taught. The schools are visited by the female staff of the Medical Department. The students are of all nationalities, including Indians, Jews, Persians and Goanese. Education is free and books etc. are provided free, but the girls pay themselves for some of their sewing material. The chief object of the schools is not, as in the case of boys' schools, to train girls to earn their own living, because at present, except in the Education and Medical Departments, there is no employment for women. The aim of the schools is to teach the girls better methods of managing their homes and bringing up their children. Minors Department. This Department, whose duties somewhat resemble those of an unpaid Public Trustee, completed its second year. During the year 26 new estates were administered on behalf of minors and the total funds dealt with by the Department amounted to Rs. 83,000.34 The Department recovered a number of old debts due to estates without resorting to the courts and it collected the rents of 160 different properties. Over Rs. 10,000 was spent on purchasing house property for minors and Rs, 6,000 was advanced from minors funds in loans at 10% &amp; 15% interest secured by mortgages on gold or house property. The Department maintained 70 orphans during the year, paying them regular allowances from the income of their properties. The Minors Department, although not as effective as it might be, is doing valuable work and its existence is a deterrent against administrators who in the past had nothing to fear if they misappropriated the funds of the persons entrusted to their care. It is not possible, at present, to insist on the estates of all minors being automatically administered by this Department as such a suggestion would cause strong opposition from the Bhara as well as from a number of notoriously corrupt administrators. The experimental garden at Budeya, which is now in its third year, was put under the charge of Captain A. C. Byard, who reports upon it as follows :— In the autumn the whole area of the garden was taken into use and laid down to the following crops :— In addition an acre on the east side was taken in and planted with grain, half wheat and half barley. The total area now under cultivation is 10 acres. A considerable amount of additional space for cultivation was made inside the garden by digging up unnecessary paths and water channels. The whole cultivated area has been deeply dug twice, cleared of stone, and enriched with good manure and as much green manure as was available. The value of green manure is not appreciated by local cultivators in Bahrain who are accustomed to burn all such material before using it in the ground. I he water supply, which is from one artesian well, is good and adequate, but irrigation neods careful attention owing to the unsatisfactory drainage system. This is a difficult problem owing to the relative levels of sub-soil water and the sea, which is about a mile away. A solution of this problem may be found expensive as there is much rock in the garden and between the garden and the gea. A very healthy crop of lucerne was grown from local seed, which is considered better than imported seed. The second cutting produced 7 tons. The income from this main crop should cover the cost of maintenance of the garden. The lucerne is being bought by the Police Department for the camels and horses. The potato crop was sown from South African tubers which were bought locally. A quantity of seed potatoes were ordered from England, including samples of about a dozen different kinds, but these were lost at sea. The potato crop was healthy: the early yield produced 4^ cwts to the quarter acre, which is not a full yield, but better results will be obtained with the improvement of the soil. It is possible that other types of potatoes may produce better results but the South African were the only ones available at the time. I ho tomato crop did well under the trellis system and is producing well, but tomatoes, in Bahrain, are not a money-making proposition. Agriculture. Approximate acreage. Main crop, lucerne Vegetable crops, Potatoes 4 1 i „ „ Tomatoes Miscellaneous vegetables etc.35 The following vegetables, all from English seed, have been grown ;— Artichokes Beetroot Beet Spinach Asparagus Sugar Beet Cabbage Broad Beans Beet Kale Cauliflower Onion Spinach Mixed Herbs Lettuce Parsley Turnip Leek Peas Swede Dwarf and Kidney Beans. These crops have been sown at fortnightly intervals. The majority failed at the first two sowings, but successive sowings have produced good results, with the exception of all varieties of beans which apparently cannot withstand the cold north winds. The soil appears to be suitable for growing most garden vegetables but needs to be enriched as propagation of seeds and maturing of plants is at present slow. The sugar cane crop was transplanted around the garden to assist in the establishment of wind breaks. This crop is doing well and should be profitable. The grain crops are doing well under irrigation. In addition to the 91 date trees already growing in the garden 524 have been planted this year, of which 440 have survived. A few young citrus trees are growing and some guava, fig and miscellaneous fruit trees and shrubs have been planted. Farm buildings are being erected to house a small herd of pedigree cattle which is expected to arrive from India in the near furture. The Government obtained a quantity of vegetable seeds and tried to sell them to the public. A small amount was bought but the response of the public was disappointing. Several Arab landowners and one Indian grew successfully crops of European vegetables in gardens near the town. The agricultural report by Khan Bahadur M. Fateh-Ud-Din, who visited Bahrain in the spring of 1938, arrived during the year. It has not been of very great help to the Government and unfortunately the reports on soil were less valuable than they should have been as many of the samples which were sent to India for analysis were mixed or mislaid. During the year His Highness agreed to a restriction of well drilling. This has caused some discontent but it is a very necessary measure as numbers of artesian wells have shown an alarming decrease in pressure and in His Highness's own gardens at Sadad many artesian wells have dried completely. From experience in the Experimental Garden it appears that the most profitable crop is lucerne. European vegetables have an uncertain sale and as many of them ripen simultaneously there is sometimes no sale for vegetables which are ready for picking. By the beginning of August conditions in the local markets were already causing grave concern to Government. Prices were unsteady, food and clothing commodities were being withheld from sale, and import trade was being threatened by the uncertain conditions. In the last week of August conditions became so abnormal that the Govern ment had to take action. It was decided to build up and ensure the maintenance of a six months' supply of necessary food stuffs, keep prices as low as possible, and prevent hoarding. Report on Food Control. (by Captain A. C. Byard, m b e)36 On the 26th August government issued proclamation No. 32/1358 prohibiting :— (a) Exports of foodstuffs fthis did not apply to direct transhipments,). (h) Increase of rates over those prevailing on that date. (c) Refusal of sales to public. A list showing these prevailing rates was issued. On the 26th August government also issued a circular No. 1411/SF-1358 requesting foodstuff merchants to inform government of quantity of foodstuff in their possession. The Assistant Adviser, then acting as Director of Customs, had many personal interviews w r ith merchants, when he explained the aims of the government to them and requested their co-operation. Some days later merchants reported that there was a sudden and extraordinary demand for foodstuff, especially tinned provisions, the latter mostly by housewives of Awali. Consequently government issued proclamation No. 33/1358 dated the 27th August, 1939, restricting the quantities of individual purchases. On the 28th August direct importers of sugar complained that there was a heavy demand for this commodity. Investigations were made and it was proved that the local wholesale purchasers and retailers were purchasing more than their normal requirements and that the normal sales to the general public were not being maintained. By this time the prices in countries of origin had considerably increased and the deduction was obvious. On the 2nd September the direct importers were summoned to a conference and the subject was thoroughly discussed. The general opinion was :— (a) That traders should be classed as, i. Direct importers ii. Local wholesale purchasers Hi. Retailers. (b) That rates should be fixed for each class of traders. (c) That permits for the purchase of sugar should be introduced. The government adopted this measure and fixed the rates whereby the direct importers obtained at least 5% of profit and the other two classes profited in proportion. On the 11th September this was made known to the general public by customs notice No. G/38/350. Upon checking transactions between these classes of traders it was found that the local wholesale purchasers were endeavouring to cheat by concealment of purchases. They were purchasing from several sources per day. On 23rd September the government called a conference for the discussion of this subject. Thirty-four traders attended and all classes were represented. It was suggested that better control could be obtained by ;— (a) Calling for a weekly return of foodstuffs from direct importers. (h) Making local wholesale purchasers maintain a book showing a record of their daily purchases and sales. This system has been adopted and is already in force. As regards cotton and woollen piecegoods the government issued a proclama tion forbidding the raising of the prices over those prevailing on the 26th August, 1939. About the beginning of October merchants complained that they were selling woollen and cotton piecegoods at a loss, so they were allowed to raise their prices by 10% over those prevailing on the 26th August 1939, reference proclamation No. FC/5/58 dated 8th October, 1939. Towards the end of the month of December public complained that cloth merchants were not selling freely certain qualities of the piecegoods, which are generally used by the locals. It was found that there was a stock of piecegoods valued at about 7 lakhs of rupees in the bazaar. By proclamation No. FC/68/58 dated the 10th January, 1940, exports of certain3B Stock on Hand as on 9th February, 1940. Average Monthly consumption. Approx. lbs. Rice Rangooni Rice Ballam Sugar Java Wheat Flour Vegetable Gbee Pure Khaldi Gbee Coffee Tea 31,000 1 8,000 6,500 bags 2,900 bags 1,600 tins 600 tins 1,600 bags 8,000 bags 164 1,200 bags 224 2,600 bags 196 1,400 tins 36 to 40 600 tins 36 to 40 160 bags 168 400 cases 70 cases 100 to 140 From the comparative figures of prices it will be noticed that there is no marked increase in prices of British manufactured goods with the exception of cigarettes, the prices of which have gone up by about 40% over pre-war. However, the slight increase in selling prices of general commodities of British manufacture in Bahrain is due to a very slight increase in manufacturers' prices and due to increased rate of freight and additional war risk insurance. In regard to goods of American origin, the manufacturers' prices of many American commodities remain same as pre-war. The increase in selling prices of American products in Bahrain by about 25% is due to increased rate of dollar exchange, and also due to increase in freight and additional war risk insurance. The local prices of tea and coffee are same as pre-war, due to there being no imports of these commodities since the war. As most of the essential foodstuffs are produced in India and Iraq, and as long as there is a regular steamer service between the ports of Bahrain, India and Iraq a shortage of essential foodstuffs in Bahrain appears unlikely. In view of the rise in prices of the essential foodstuffs and other necessities of life, it is estimated that the cost of living has gone up per head by about 25%. It has only been necessary to take legal action against 18 persons for breach of the regulations since food control was introduced. At the end of April, 1939, his Majesty King Ibn Sa'ud came from Nejd to Hassa to visit the Dhamam oil field and his Highness Shaikh Hamad took this opportunity of inviting the King to pay a visit to Bahrain. The last time his Majesty was in Bahrain was ten years ago when he landed for a few hours on his way from Iraq to Hassa. The Amirs Sa'ud and Faisal arrived before the King; the former from Arabia, the latter by air from Cairo where he had been attending an Arab conference. The Amir Khalid and his Excellency Shaikh Hafiz Wahba, Minister of Sa'udi Arabia at the Court of St. James', accompanied the Amir Faisal. The royal visitors and their suite, which included a number of ministers and notables and several hundred followers and retainers, were accomodated at Rafaa, because it was cooler than Manamah, in houses of the Khalifah Shaikhs and in the Kozaibi house. Telephones and wireless were installed and guards were provided outside the King's residence. A programme of events, had been arranged for the visit, which included the King's official arrival at the new customs pier where he was met by his Highness Shaikh Hamad. After inspecting a guard of honour he drove with Shaikh Hamad in an open car, with a cavalry escort, to the Manamah Palace, where the leading Shaikhs of the Khalifah family and a number of local notables' were presented to him. During the following days his Majesty witnessed a review of the State F'orces in front of the Palace and attended a reception in the Municipal garden given by the Manamah and Muharraq municipalities, a garden party in the Political Agency, and visited the refinery and the oil field, where he was entertained by the KING IBN SAWS VISIT TO BAHRAIN.H.M. King Ibn Sa'ud inspecting the guard of honour, accompanied by H.H. Shaikh Hamad.39 Bahrain Petroleum Company. On the day before his departure he was present at a night display and torchlight tattoo on the Fort parade ground in which five hundred police, naturs and schoolboys took part. When his Majesty left he was presented by Shaikh Hamad with a number of cars, horses and camels. The King's visit, which was given much prominence in the Arab press and in European papers, did much to advance the already friendly relations existing between Bahrain and the Kingdom of Saoudi Arabia. Passport Department. The revenue from this source, which was at one time third largest revenue producing department, is likely to decrease considerably owing to the effect of the war on travel and the enforcement of various restrictions. It is possible that the revenue will no longer cover the cost of the passport control organisation. During the year 12,500 passengers landed in Bahrain from steamers, aeroplanes and native craft, the details of each person being recorded. Over eighty prosecutions were instituted by the Passport Officer against persons failing to comply with regulations. A number of local residents were convicted for giving false evidence about the place of birth of Persians residing in Bahrain who wished to obtain Bahrain passports. The number of foreigners, mostly Persians, who apply for Bahrain naturalization increases every year. Out of 28 applications 16 were given Bahrain nationality during 1358. Numbers of Arabs, mainly from Qattar, continue to evade passport regula tions by entering Bahrain illegally at various points on the coast. When they are caught action can rarely be taken as they obtain a sympathetic hearing from hie Highness the Ruler. Public Works Department The work done by this department during the year was carried out by Mr. Mohomed Jafar with a small permanent staff of supervisors and local and Indian artisans and workmen. 1. Recurrent expenditure. The annual expenditure on departmental salaries and staff was estimated in the 1358 budget at Ks. 29,750; it amounted to Rs. 23,273. Recurrent expenditure on upkeep of buildings was estimated at Rs. 9,000 and repairs to roads at Rs. 16,000: actually Rs. 17,770 was spent on the former and Rs. 19,298 on the latter. Towards the end of the year the Government took over the maintenance of the Manamah - Rudm al Kowari section of the main Rafaa road. This had previously been kept in repair by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Road mending material is being provided by the Company. The increased number of government buildings entails a large annual expen diture on repairs, painting and general upkeep. Roofs in Bahrain require replastering at least every three years and white plaster and paint appear shabby if not frequently renewed. 2. Non-recurrent expenditure on special projects. A. Manamah Muharraq Causeway and Bridge. The contract for the swing bridge across the gap in the Manamah - Muharraq causeway was placed during the year with Messrs. Holloway Brothers Limited of London. The firm has recently built the two bridges across the Tigris in Baghdad and among other important work done by this firm is the new Bank of England. Owing to the necessity for allowing boats to pass up and down the channel, especially barges bringing cargoes from the Sitra anchorage to Manamah, an opening40 bridge was necessary. The bridge consists of a swing span with two clear openings of 50 feet and two approach spans of 35 feet. A roadway ten feet wide with two five feet wide footways is provided. The roadway on the bridge is designed to carry a super imposed line load of a continuous string of lorries or buses having a maxi mum loaded weight of 8 tons each. The footways will carry a superimposed weight of 112 lbs per square foot. The swing span is to be electrically operated from a control cabin at one end of the causeway. The electrical machinery will be housed in a chamber inside the central pier. An important feature of the bridge is the centre dolphin of reinforced concrete, with vertical fenders extending from the centre pier, thirty-four feet on each side, at right angles to the bridge. This is required to prevent boats being dashed against the bridge when the tide is running strongly. The current in the channel was always strong but since the gap has been narrowed by the extension of the caiiFeway on each side the current has become more powerful. All the steel work, electrical equipment and machinery, etc., are of British manufacture. The contract price is £28,291 and there is a clause provided for certain eventualities arising fiom war conditions. The work is to be completed within one year from the date on which operations were commenced but it is possible, provided that present conditions continue, that the bridge will be finished some months before the specified time. r l he work on the bridge was started in December but during the year the two ends of the causeway were extended leaving in the centre little more than the space which will be occupied by the bridge. This work was done by the two municipalities. The two end sections of the causeway were in deeper water than has been encoun tered before and the cost of this was Ks. 61,376. A toll will be levied on vehicles crossing the bridge. The details of charges have not yet been decided but the revenue from this source is expected to be more than sufficient to pay for the maintenance and upkeep of the bridge. According to statistics, the daily number of persons crossing to and from Muharraq is 4004 and 47G motor vehicles go to the end of the causeway every day. B. Manamah Pier Extension The pier extension was completed during the first half of the year. Thb original plan was altered and the T piece at the end of the pier was enlarged to 216' x 75'. The new part of the pier, which is 50 feet wide, is 1,240 feet long. The length of the whole pier is now 675 yards. There is no longer any need for passengers and cargo to be transhipped, at low water, from launches or boats into small skiffs in order to reach the pier. The largest dhows and launches can now come alongside the pier at all states of the tide. The new pier has made it possible to land cargo without delay and has put an end to the difficulty and inconvenience which passengers had to submit to in the past. The estimated cost of completing the pier extension was calculated for the purpose of the 1358 budget on the basis of the cost of the section of the pier which had been finished. It was found however that much of remainder, including the T piece, was on a soft part of the sea bed and the quantity of rock needed for the construction greatly exceeded the anticipated amount. This and the enlargement of the terminal caused the cost to be greater than was expected. The expenditure on this work was Ks. 1,01,588. The whole of this amount, except masons' and foremen's wages and the cost of the wooden beams bridging the water passages which were made at intervals of 200 feet along the pier, is the cost of stone. The stone was brought by local Arabs in their own boats and thua employment was given to many hundreds of men for several months in the year during the season when there was no diving. In the past one of the customs charges was described as 'pier fees'. It was originally levied in about 1918 to pay for the building of the pier which, it was thenintended should reach deep water. The work was dropped in 1923 and the end of the pier was faced with stone in lO^. The present and final extension has been under consideration from that time. C. State Hospital. The building of the hospital has made slow progress. It was hoped that by the end of the year the women's hospital would be in use but it has not yet been opened. Owing to the situation of the hospital at one end of the town in a secluded neighbourhood surrounded by houses on three sides the extent of the building is not generally appreciated. The four blocks consisting of out-patients dispensary for men and women with the Medical Officer s flat above, the women's hospital with Lady Doctor's and Matron's flats above, the men's hospital and the administrative and surgery block will eventually cover a ground area of over 31,000 square feet and all the buildings are two storied. This hospital is the largest building in Bahrain and, I think, the largest building in the Persian Gulf. The dispensary was completed during the year. It is divided into two parts for men and for women which necessitated duplicating most of the rooms. Male and female patients are attended to at the same time and arrangements have been made to ensure the privacy of the women's rooms. In the women's hospital the two flats and the nurses' quarters were completed with the exception of some fittings in the latter. The first floor of this hospital was ready for use at the end of the year and the ground floor was nearing completion. The wards in the women's hospital are 14 feet high and are provided with large windows and clear story ventilators. Walls up to a height of 5 feet and all the floors are made of green 'Terrazo '. This is the first time that flooring of this type has been used in a government building in Bahrain. All woodwork is made of teak wood. There is a central water heating system for the whole hospital and hot and cold water is laid on in every ward. The verandahs, which are 12 feet wide, are enclosed with mosquito wire, though unfortunately, owing to the dampness, it has been found to have a short life in Bahrain. There are four special wards for one or two beds with private Enropean-style bathrooms attached. The doctor's and matron's flats consist of sitting room, dining room, bedroom, dressing room, kitchen, pantry, etc. On the ground floor there are rooms for Indian nurses, with common rooms, dining room, and bathrooms and kitchens. The water supply for the whole hospital comes direct from the main flow of an artesian well in the neighbourhood and is lifted to tanks on a 36 feet high water tower by an electric engine. Electricity is supplied from the nearest sub-station by an underground cable. It is not proposed to install an air-conditioning plant but some separate air-conditioning units will be used in certain wards. The men's hospital is similar in style and construction to the women's hospital. The structural work on the ground floor was completed at the end of the year with ward accomodation for about 40 beds but flooring, plastering and wood work has not been begun. It is not proposed to commence the first floor at present until part of the administrative block has been built. Only the foundations of the administrative block have been completed. All the hospital buildings are of solid stone with walls 2 feet thick. The foundations are, on an average, from 10 to 12 feet deep. This excessive depth was necessary as the ground on the site consisted of loose sand and rubble. The unusual depth of the foundations has added very greatly to the cost of the buildings, a fact which cannot be appreciated by the ordinary observer. D. The Fort. During the year the eastern wall was rebuilt and work on the north east tower was begun. The tower will be similar to the one at the north-west corner, but will contain a large store on the ground floor. Before building had started most of the old tower and part of the wall had fallen down and for some months it was possible to walk through the walls into the Fort. A new barrack room, with accomodation for about 30 men, was built and the main entrance and guard room were re-roofed and repaired.42 A kitchen, large enough for the needs of the Police and a mess hall and a canteen were built inside the Fort. Previously the men had no proper place in which to eat their meals and it was impossible to prevent food being left lying about in the barrack rooms. The parade ground was enclosed by a strong wire fence which was purchased from the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Only a small portion of the old walls of the fort now remains. The building has been so much enlarged, heightened and strengthened that its original occupants would hardly recognise it. E. Government Schools. The Technical School was enlarged by the addition of another room at the west end of the building and a walled yard was added. Various alterations were made in the Manamah Boys' School, including the addition of two new rooms on each side of the main entrance. Classrooms were whitewashed and ceilings were painted white, and a number of new windows were put into existing classrooms. The proposed school at Xaim was not proceeded with. The religious school continues to function in a hired building. F. Transport Building. Two large new garages were built on the north of the existing building. There is now accomodation for 6 cars and lorries. A ramp was constructed outside the garage on which cars can be examined. IVo small flats were constructed above the garages, each containing two rooms and bathroom and kitchen, for the accomodation of garage and power house staff. G. Passport Office and Post Office. A new Passport Office consisting of one large oftce 24 x 24 feet, a small office, record room and verandah was built on to the western end of the Custom House. The Passport Office resembles the Custom House in style of architecture and it has improved the appearance of the Customs square. T he old Passport Office and former Police Station, with the lar^e room on the first floor, was converted into a Post Office. The ground floor rooms are used for postal purposes and the first floor was made into living quarters for the Post- master 'Vht new building provides ample space for the postal work and is centrally situated. Ihe Government telephone exchange is in the same building on the first floor. It was enlarged and provided with a separate staircase. H. Manamah Palace, New entrance stairs. (See illustration, Opposite). A handsome flight of stone steps leading from the ground to the central archway of the first floor verandah was built at the Palace. The steps are tiled with locally-made tiles and have carved teakwood railings. A steel expanding door was fitted into the archway and the second staircase was fitted with a wooden door so that the whole first floor can be locked. The steps have greatly improved the appearance of the building and have made it possible for visitors to make a dignified entry without any danger of hitting their heads on the cross bar This frequently happened on the old staircase. Hawar Mosque. A small mosque was built in the northern village at Hawar Island. 11 is used by the local Arabs and the garrison of the Fort. Some altera tions were made to the Fort and a verandah was built outside the barrack room in the courtyard. 3. Works not provided for in 1358 budget. » A. Rifle Range. The existing rifle range, which is close to the Fort was found unsuitable for w T ork with the new Vickers Berthier machine-^uns. This range iias gardens on each side and faces an inlet of the sea where boats' frequently pass- On the recomrnendation of the special officer who assisted in training the hrst Macbine-Gun Section a new rifle range was built near the old road leadinc to bakhir, about ten miles from Manamah. It appeared that this was the nearest suitable place J he rif1e range '3 m a valley surrounded by high ground and there is a cliff behind the butts. A range of 900 yards was obtained over flat groundI4S ) I I 43 with the possibility of another 200 yards from the hillside. The expense incurred in building this rifle range was great owing to cost of transport and the distance from the sea. It cost Rs. 8,000. It will only be used occasionally by the Police for machine-gun practice as the .old range is more suitable and convenient for the daily rifle shooting. This expenditure may be considered as part of the expenditure on defence measures. B. Jida Island. Jida Island, a rocky island about three miles south-west of Budeya, has been converted into a penitentiary for long term prisoners. An artesian well was drilled and ground has been put under cultivation. A pier was constructed, reaching deep water; also accomodation for the police guards and prisoners. Overhanging rock was utilised in building the prison so that one side and the roof are of natural rock. A square two-storied watch tower, which is now being used as a store, was built on the high cliffs at one end of the island. Jida contains what is probably one of the oldest known inscriptions in Bahrain. It is in Arabic writing, carved on the face of one of the rocks, and commemorates the cutting of a thousand stones about five hundred years ago. In those days this island was used as a stone quarry and most of the stone in the Portuguese Fort was cut at Jida. C. Idari Spring. The sides of Idari spring, which have been leaking in many directions, were repaired and cemented in order to preserve the water and also to improve the amenities of the pool, which is thronged with people during the summer. A small pavilion was built on the edge of the pool, providing shade, and a Hat roof for use at night. A temporary coffee shop was put up during the hot weather, and as the experiment proved a success a permanent building is contem plated which will be in keeping with the surroundings. This place, in the summer, might be described as Bahrain's Lido. D. Hedd Girls' School. Extensive repairs and alterations were carried out in a house in Hedd, which has been taken on a long lease as a Girls' school. The building, like all old fashioned local houses, contained a number of dark unventilated rooms which had to be provided with doors and windows. The floors, previously of mud, were cemented and walls and roofs were repaired. E. Om Ashaoom Spring. The spring was repaired and the sides cemented and the roads leading to it were repaired and bridges constructed so that it can now be reached by car from several directions. General. New Appointments. Captain A. C. Byard, m.b.e ., was appointed as Assistant Adviser, and commenced duty on 1st R/Thani 1358 (21st May, 1939). Mr. C. R. L. Adrian-Vallance, m.a., l.l.b , Cantab., was appointed Director of Education and commenced duty on 16th Shawal, 1358 (17th November, 1939). Local Newspaper and Cinema. An Arabic weekly newspaper was started at the beginning of 1358, edited by Abdulla bin Ali A1 Zaid, a Bahrain Arab, brother- in-law of Shaikh Mohamed bin Isa al-Khalifah. At the end of the year it? circulation was about 800 copies, including subscribers in other parts of the Gulf. This is the first and only newspaper published in the Persian Gulf. The Govern ment has made use of it by publishing in it all public proclamations and by various 'inspired' articles on Education, anti-malaria measures, etc., etc. Towards the end of the year the local Cinema arranged to show the news reels which were shown at the Bapco cinema. The cinema audiences increased immediately and many people, especially Arabs, took to patronising the cinema only in order to see the news reels, walking out at the beginning of the big film. H. H.'s visit to India. His Highness Shaikh Hamad spent about 6 weeks at Simla during the summer. He returned just after war had been declared. His Highness was received by H.E. the Viceroy and met various prominent people at44 Simla. He was accompanied by several of his sons. A Regency Council, consisting of Shaikh Abdulla, Shaikh Salman and the Adviser, acted during his Highness's absence. Press and Broadcast propaganda. Since the death of H .M. King Ghazi of Iraq the broadcast propaganda from Baghdad about Bahrain has ceased. German wireless stations, however, continue to publish entirely untrue reports about the Persian Gulf, with occasional references to Bahrain. The Bahrain Government issued an order forbidding the broadcasting of news from Germany in coffee shops and public places but there have bean no restrictions on private wireless sets. Considerable publicity was given to Bahrain by the B.B C. and in the British press during the year especially in connection with H.H.'s gift to the British . Government and his public statements about the war. Catholic Church. His Highness Shaikh Hamad gifted a plot of ground on the southern edge of Manama to the Catholic community, numbering about 400 persons, on which a church was built The building was completed at the end of the year. The majority of the Catholics are Goauese, many of them being long resident in Bahrain. Government Rest House. Owing to the war the number of visitors to Bahrain decreased during the latter part of the year. The Rest House was used however by 68 visitors in 1358. Appointment of a Government Representative with the Oil Company. At the beginning of the year the Government appointed Shaikh Ali bin Ahmed al-Khalifah as Government representative with the Bahrain Petroleum Company to act as mediator in case of discussions between the Company and the Arab employees on matters of general interest. Shaikh Ali has been Amir of Raffa for 10 years and is a magistrate of Bahrain Court. Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa's visit to New York. At the end of July, 1939, (Jamad-Althany 1358) Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa visited New York as the guest of the Standard Oil Company of California. He travelled from Egypt, wherp he was staying, by s.s. 'Conte de Savoia' and landed in New York on 28th July. He sailed for Europe in the 'Queen Mary' on August 9th. During his visit a reception was given in his honour at Peryton Hall at the New York Fair, where he reviewed the United States troops at the World's Fair Court of Peace. Shaikh Mohomed was the guest at a dinner given for him by the Bahrain Petroleum Com pany and at luncheons given by the Pearl Associates and the Texas Oil Company. He visited his Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and attended a reception given by the British Chamber of Commerce in New York. He also received a visit from the representative of the Persian Government. During his stay in New York Shaikh Mohomed went several times to the World Fair and made tours of museums and other places of interest in the city and in the neighbourhood. On August 8th Shaikh Mohomed, with Mr. Moffett and Mr. Thornburg, was received at Hyde Park by President Roosevelt. The visit was given much publicity in the American press and was made the occasion for further publicity about Bahrain pearls. Shaikh Mohomed was accompanied by Mr. Hussein Yatim, who acted as interpreter. Electric Department. 1. Electricity Department:— Units generated for the year 1358 showed an increase of 134,748 over 1357. Units sold and used on works for the year 1358 showed an increase of 95,299 over45 1357. This was due to extra load amounting to approximately 128 K.W. The nature of the new load connected during 1358 was as follows;— Lighting &amp; fans (1163 points) 58.0 K.W. Power:—Motors 16.0 Heaters 8.0 Ice Plant 22.0 Kefrigerators 1.0 A.C. Units 13.0 Miscel. apparatus 10.0 128.0 K .W. Revenue from units sold during 1358 amounted to Rs. 122,467-15-0 as compared with Rs. 102,811-4-0 in 1357. Increase: Rs. 19,656-11-0. 227 new premises were connected during 1358 :— In Man am ah 205 In Muharaq 22 Total consumers connected to date 1,339. Maximum load recorded 167. Total kilowatts connected to date 548 K.W. Capacity of generating plant 400 K .Y .A. Wiring Contracts:— The local wiring contractors continued wiring in the State during 1358. Premises wired were as follows :— 1. Haji Salman Abdulla Zayani 69 2. Haji Khalil Ebrahim Kanoo 7 3. Mr. Yousuf Khalil Almoayed 49 4. Messrs. M. &amp; A. Koohiji 44 5. Haji Abdul Rahman Mohd. Zayani 8 The last two contractors were licensed in 1358. The Department carried out the wiring of Government and certain other buildings including :— Assistant Political Agent's residence (Govt, house at Gudhabia) Government Hospital — Female Block „ — Lady Doctor's Flat „ — Matron's Flat Nurses' Quarters. New Passport Office Juma Mosque Minaret And a few other small premises. Temporary Wiring:— During the year 1358 Manamah and Muharraq were specially illuminated on two occasions, once on H.M. King Ibn Saud's visit to Bahrain, and once to celebrate the anniversary of the accession of H.H, Shaikh Hamed, Ruler of Bahrain, 1200 extra lights were temporarily installed. Main Extensions:— A 400 volt, 3-phase pole line was run from the transformer at his Highness's Palace (Gudhaibia) to the new Air Liaison Officer's residence at Gudhaibia (distance approximately 750 yards). The cost was partly borne by the R.A.F.46 A 3-phase overhead line was run on the existing poles between the Power House and Yateem's Ice Plant premises ^distance approximately 400 yards). A new 3300/400 volt sub-station has been erected and equipped at Nairn adjacent to the new hospital. One 3300/400 - 3-phase transformer has been installed and put to work, and provision made for a duplicate. To feed the sub- tation an underground high tension 3300 volt P1LSSTA 3-core cable was laid from 'B' sub-station near Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Go's premises to Nairn, a distance of 1200 yards. Alteration to Mains :— One span of the high tension overhead line opposite the Government Garage was removed and an underground cable substituted. Air Conditioning:— Eleven residences were equipped with 28 units in the summer of 1358, and an additional seven units have been ordered for 1359. A central conditioning installation is being put in the Air Liaison Officer's office and residence during 1359, the supply being taken from the Government mains. II. Government Telephone Department: - The number of subscribers connected at present is 83, and applications continue to be received. A new 50 line exchange was erected to meet the demand in 1358 and one additional 50 line exchange has been ordered for 1359. The oldest of the three boards was removed. The Department is self supporting. Owing to the growth of the central exchange the number of overhead lines radiating from it has caused overloading of the electricity pole lines on which they are conveyed. It is proposed to lay, in sections, multicore underground cables in place of the overhead lines. In addition to releasing the strain on the existing poles, better telephone reception should result, as line noises, etc., are often caused by the swinging of the wire in high winds and by leakage through loose material caused by dampness wind or by damp. Expenditure for this has been provided for in the Budget. III. Transport Department:— The following additions were made during 1358 :— Two staff houses were built over the Garage to accommodate two of the senior Power House staff. A ramp for the examination and cleaning of vehicles was erected near the Garage. The area surrounding the garage was fenced in to provide space for vehicles, and the public footpath was diverted The usual servicing of government vehicles was carried out during the year. Number of vehicles dealt with is 30—including seven police motor-cycles. IV. Fire Department. A number of small fires were extinguished by the Fire Department during the year, and further suction pits have been placed in the town of Manamah for lire purposes. The grouping of wells, mentioned under 'Anti Malaria Campaign', helps in this matter, as it is now possible to put the pits along the routes of the feed pipes to outlying districts. V. Traffic Section:— The State Engineer's Department carried out the registration of all the motor vehicles in the State (521 vehicles), and the testing of brakes, lights, etc., in accordance with the Bahrain Government Motor Vehicle Proclamation of 1357.47 The licensing (and re-licensing) of all drivers was also carried out by thf Department. 100 drivers were examined for driving licenses during 1358, out of which 52 passed. License holders for all motor vehicles are being obtained from England and will be fitted to wind screens. Each taxi driver is also being given a numbered disc to wear. Danger and directional traffic signs fitted with reflex lenses are being erected at suitable points, such as dangerous cross roads, concealed turnings, etc., in the town of Man am ah. VI. Government Technical School: The training of boys as mechanics and carpenters was carried out under the supervision of the State Engineer as in 1357, and one boy ffrom the mechanical section) was sent to the workshops of the Bahrain Petroleum Company for his final six months' training. Three more boys from this section will be sent early in 1359. The preliminary training received in the School has proved profitable to the boys as ground-work for the more advanced training in the Company's workshops. New Government Hospital—Naim :— The State Engineer's Department carried out the electricity and hot and cold water installations for the portions of the Hospital which were completed. Lady Doctor's and Matron's flats, Nurses' quarters and Female blocks. This includes three A .C. units. Two Beeston hot water boilers, one of 185,000 B.T.U's capacity and thr other of 580,000 B.T .U 's capacity, were installed, the smaller to provide hot water for the Dispensary, and the larger for the main Blocks. Anti Malaria Campaign:— In connection with the anti-malaria work now in progress a number of artesian wells within the Manamah Municipal boundary were grouped. The objeet of this is :— YD To conserve the water supply, as, owing to the number of wells sunk at present, the general head of water is tending to fall. More wells than necessary exist within the town area, and the waste of water is great. (2,) To construct at outlying points (where no wells exist) public drinking and washing places fed from the grouped wells, and thereby eliminate the shallow wells which exist in most of the houses. These house wells are a danger to public health as they encourage the breeding of mosquitos. Oil Royalty and other gauging: The whole of the oil produced by the Bahrain Petroleum Company field, amounting to 1,008,080 tons (1,112,620 tons in 1357), was :gauged and sampled by this Department. The decrease in 1358 was to some extent due to the bringing in of crude oil from the California Arabian Standard Oil Company's field on the mainland of Arabia, the field production in Bahrain being slowed down. The Arabian Oil is brought over for refining, and the Bahrain Petroleum Company's refinery has been worked to its capacity for most of the year. Oil is received from Arabia at two points, the Sitra aud Zellaq Terminals. Various grades of oil for shipment were also gauged, sampled and tested for the Bahrain Petroleum Company, twenty-five ships in all being certified during the year.48 Muharraq Bridge:— Work was connnenced on the erection of the new Swing Bridge across the Khore Khalya on 10th December, 1939, and is proceeding at normal rate of progress. Most of the foundation material, etc., had arrived by the end of January, 1940. Messrs. Holloway Brothers, the contractors, anticipate that the Bridge will be completed and ready for use by about the end of October, 1940 (Ramadhan, 1359) provided that the steel work, etc., shortly to be shipped from England, is not delayed in transit. A supply of electricity is being given to the contractors for their crane, etc.. from the Government mains in Muharraq, and a water supply from the nearest artesian well. Financial Position:— After meeting all charges, including depreciation, a nett profit of Rs. 16,964-12-11 was made for 1358. If the present international situation does not adversely affect the revenue oi the Electricity Department, it may be assumed that the usual annual increase in revenue will continue. The bazaar is prosperous at present and the leading merchants are renting larger premises and expanding their business. The building of house? continues at a fairly rapid rate, and most of them will require electricity. Electricity Charges. A.C. Units:—The charges (including hire of machines) for electricity consumed by A.C. units have been reduced by the introduction of a sliding scale. Lighting and Fans :—It is proposed to reduce the price per unit to consumerp of electricity for lighting purposes (which includes fans) to seven annas per unit, a reduction of one anna in the present rate. The reduction will be subject to the usual war clauses. Prospects for 1359:— The connected load is expected to increase at the usual rate, i.e. 50 K.W. per annum. In addition, the new Swing Bridge should be in operation by the autumn of 1359, and the new Government Hospital at Naim should commence taking current in larger quantities during the first three months of 1359. The connected load from these two sources should amount to approximately 45 K.W. There is a proposal for installing a high tension sub-station at Jufair to deal with their increased load, which will possibly amount to an additional 15 K.W. during 1359. The lighting of the new Customs Pier extension will be carried out during 1359, additional connected load from this source being approximately 3^ K.W. The Air Liaison Officer 's air conditioning plant should be in operation during 1359, the connected load being 5 K.W. Estimated additional connected load is about 70 K.W. The question of increased generating capacity arises, and an addition to the Power House plant of another 200 K.W. set should be made before the summer of 1360, as, by then, it is thought that the total connected load will be over 600 K.W. The present generating capacity, including standby plant, is 400 K.W. The matter of standby plant (and spares generally) is of considerable importance in a country as far from sources of supply as Bahrain.63 Customs Department.

The decrease in Export Duty Receipts is explained mainly by (a) the outbreak of war having stopped the export of 'Linga' mother-of-pearl shell to German ports, and (b) a falling-of! in the export of dates due to a desire to conserve food supplies. F. The Customs Report for 1357 explained that year's abnormal increase in collections from Direct Transhipment duty by the great quantity of machinery and plant etc, imported via Bahrain by The California Arabian Standard Oil Company Inc. prior to the development of the Saudi-Arabian port of Ras Tanura. [t was to be expected that, in any case, the quantity of 4 capital' plant would decrease once it had been installed and consequently the collections of duty would56 diminish. Having regard to the fact that the port of Has Tanura is now sened by ships of the Pacific-Java-Silver Line and, to some extent, by the ships of the B 1 S N Coy. Ltd., it is of interest to note the large sum collected from this source during the past year, which is, in fact, nearly twice the amount collected in 1356, and more than thrice the collections of previous years, before the development of the C.A.S.O.C. working. It is agreed that the passage to lias Tanura is tortuous and dangerous; and it cannot be doubted that steamers prefer to use the Port of Bahrain if only on account of the efficiency of its service. While the above collections from Direct Transhipment may be regarded as unexpectedly good, there is little reason to expect that this figure will be maintained. From all other sources of Customs income, an increase in receipts will be noticed. I would like to infer that this suggests an increase in commercial activity; but the true explanation may be found in the sudden activity caused by the outbreak of the European War on IBth Rajah, 1358, (3rd September, 1039) when many local importers placed orders for commodities, especially foodstuffs, in anticipation of rises in prices in India, due to war speculation. There cannot be any doubt that such rises would have occurred to a degree more marked than obtains at present if the Government of India had not instituted regulations to control such speculation. Coincidently the Government of Bahrain purchased fifty thousand bags of rice to form a reserve of food, and instituted a local system of Food Control which has had the effect of stabilising the retail prices of food, aid preventing speculation to any great degree. This control did not extend to ' Luxury Articles ' in the sale of which local retailers immediately increased their prices, and have given reasonable cause for considerable complaint against profiteering. It is to be noted that in the past year there has been no change in the rates of Customs Duty or Import Yard charges levied. The main imports into the State of Bahrain are the necessities of life: foodstuffs and wearing material, as against its main export of pearl and, in later years oil products. Although a large quantity of dates is grown locally, the crop is insufficient for local needs, and the quantity of vegetables grown locally is very small, though slightly increasing yearly. A comparison of some of the principal commodities is of interest: Commodity. Year 1357. Year 1358. Quantity. Average value. Quantity. Average value. Rs. Rs. Rice Wheat Flour Tea Coffee Sugar: loaf „ crystal ... „ soft 3,55,499 cwts. 7 ,198 „ 69,295 „ 5,652 „ 8,203 bags. 750 „ 1,075 cwts. 47,306 „ 18,18,600 42,880 3,51,890 3,23,580 2,87,450 5,420 6,470 2,39,240 4,02,300 cwts. 16,100 , 53,200 „ 3,200 „ 13,200 bags. 81,000 cwts. 22,98,700 87,000 2,78,400 2,07,600 4,86,300 5,18,400 Piece Goods: Cottons Silk ... 21,16,380 3,79,970 • • • 23,95,400 2,86,00066 The increase in the quantity of rice is explained by the Government of Bahrain's purchase of a war reserve stock, part of which is at present in store against contingencies. The import of wheat has more than doubled, while flour has relatively decreased. The consumption of rice by the poorer classes is decreasing in favour of the wholemeal bread made from the cheap wheat exported from Iraq, which is steadily increasing in popularity. Manufactured flour from India is also falling off as against the competition of the cheaper flour from Iraq, which, however, is not so clean as the Indian product and is thought to be mixed with barley flour. The increasing consumption of Iraq flour is due to its cheapness. A local attempt to mill flour, encouraged by Government, has proved a failure, as the quality of the product was poor, and little enterprise was shown. The traffic in sugar has undergone change, since the better kind of crystal sugar has lost its market in favour of soft sugar which has re-captured its old-time popularity, having become cheaper both in price and in transport expenses. The export traflic in loaf sugar has completely fallen away, but a certain amount of soft sugar continues to be exported to neighbouring countries. The traffic in coffee has considerably increased, at the expense of tea, due to a much cheaper brand of 'Robusta' coffee coming into the market, of an inferior quality, and some increase in India in the price of tea due to speculation. But it is to be noted with regret that the steady traffic in coffee from the Yemen, of the best quality and therefore most expensive, has fallen away. In the local market for any commodity, cheapness, not quality, is the main selling argument. The decrease in the values of imported silk is offset by an increase in values of imported cottons. Here again this year, the prices of Japanese goods have some what increased, and Indian prices have increased by war speculation. Also, local importers have increased their local stocks, fearing a further speculative rise in the Indian market. It would be an exaggeration to say that Indian piece goods are recapturing the market lost some years ago to the Japanese, but there seems an indication that Indian piece goods are regaining favour with the local consumer, perhaps on account of their quality being superior to the Japanese brands. The import of Manchester piece goods is slight, and does not affect the local market. I again submit the suggestion of local registration with legal sanction of Trade Marks and Designs; as instances have occurred where British designs have been copied by Japanese factories for the local market, a dishonest trick which involves some importers in a loss, for which at present they appear to have no remedy. The following is a comparison of the average annual unit values of some principal commodities imported into Bahrain.68 B. Native Craft. The collections on cargoes imported by native craft shew an increase over 1357 by Rs. 12,718 In general the traffic is steady and tends to increase, as there is believed to be increasing activity in the movement of cargoes, particularly from Iraq. I give a comparison of such visits to this port. Origin. Year 1357. Year 1358. • • » Rs. Rs. Africa 15 4 India 73 39 Oman Coast 183 212 Iran Coast 317 366 Arabian Mainland 719 626 Kuwait 65 57 Iraq . .... 119 123 Totals 1,491 1.427 The seasonal visits from Africa and India have decreased; and this is thought to be accounted for by the general competitive lowering of freights by the B.I.S.N. Coy. Visits from Oman and Iraq have increased, as this port is still favoured by such craft as an entrepot for traffic with the mainland of Arabia. It is believed that craft from the mainland now proceed direct to Iraq for their grain; and it will be remembered that only in Bahrain is there a Food Controller covering the exports of food since the outbreak of war; and it is possible that certain mainland craft avoid Bahrain on this account. Kuwait craft often purchase grain in Iraq, and call at Basrah if unable to sell their cargoes on the mainland. Traffic between Bahrain and Qatar is still suspended. It may perhaps be anticipated that, on account of the Food Control system, the traffic with the mainland for some time will be reduced; but other ports in the mainland are not subject to this control, and consequently their traffic will continue. C. Parcels Post. The collections from this source have increased by lis. i ,145, and while the number of parcels does not appear to increase markeclly, the value of the imports is greater, mainly because of imports by the personnel of 1 he Bahrain Petroleum Coy. ijtd. This Parcels Post is of great service to the community, and is regularly used by certain importers. G. Import Yard. These receipts have increased by Rs. 19,152, and this is consistent with the larger number of packages imported by steamers. It will be remembered that in 1357 the old rates of Khanchia were abolished, and a new rate of one anna per cubic foot was instituted. This has proved to be a great success in simplifying work and enabling importers to estimate their costs. It might perhaps have been thought that this new rate would result in a considerable increase in collections, and therefore a reduction might be justified; but such does not appear to be the case. The Government has not suffered loss, and the importers are gainers by equality of treatment. Nor, for the same reason, does there appear to be any necessity to reduce the stampage on Customs Bills. 2. Pearling Licenses. In 1356, in view of the poor pearling seasons, the rate of collections from Pearling Licenses was halved; but the amount of the Budget Estimate (Rs. 34,500) was unchanged. This estimate was reduced in 1357 to Rs. 24,500, yet the collections of Ks. 13,353 showed a decrease of Rs. 11,147. If the estimate had been halved down to Rg. 17,250, there would still be a decrease of Rs. 3,897. which clearly indicates the present condition of the pearling industry.59 3. Bahrain Registered Craft. For the year 1358 the Budget estimate of collections from Craft Registration was Rs. 2,500. Actually the amount collected was Rs. 2,724 , which was Rs. 23 more than the actual collections of 1357. The rates of the registration fees has not been changed during the past year. The following table shows the position of the Bahrain Craft. Barges. Small Motor Launches. Motor Launches &amp; S/Tugs. Sailing Craft. Total. Registered craft at end of 1357 ...

The same number of motor launches were built for port work in 1358 as in 1357. This is on account of the regular traffic between Bahrain and Al-Khobar, and the marine service of The Bahrain Petroleum Coy., Ltd. To encourage the building of motor launches, preferential treatment is given by way of a refund of Customs Duty when a British marine engine is installed in Bahrain-built craft. Rome technical assistance has been given by the Bahrain Petroleum Coy., Ltd., to the local craftsmen, who work without plans; and, as a result, several of the launches constructed last year are very fine sea-going craft, easily able to travel to any part of the Persian Gulf. It is a matter of regret that so many of the larger sea-going sailing craft are laid up ashore, since, in view of the poor pearling seasons, there have not been available funds to equip them for service.60 4. The Port of Bahrain. The amenities of the Port of Bahrain remain unchanged with one important exception, namely the extension of the Customi Pier at Manamah, which was begun on the 1st Dhul Qaada 1357 (c/w 23rd December, 1938) and finished on the 30th Jamad al-Awal, 1358 (c/w 18th July 1939), the work having taken about seven monthb to complete. The extension was planned as a mole with a T-piece at its head in deep water, so that craft may come alongside independent of the tides; and this has been effected. In the past winter, however, several violent storms have badly damaged this pier-head. When the new extension has thoroughly settled down, there should be put in hand the extension of the system of trolley lines and the adequate lighting of the whole Pier system, which scheme is now under consideration and will doubtless be done during the coming year. It is possible, also, that a crane may be found necessary for heavy work at the Pier Head. During the year 1358 four hundred and six steamers called at this port (excluding H.M. warships and the Light Tender 'Nearchus'), as compared with three hundred and forty-one in the previous year, an increase of fifty-five ships. Of this increase forty-one ships were tankers for oil products. Occasionally such ships bring cargo imported by The Bahrain Petroleum Coy., Ltd. These ships may be classified as follows :— NATIONALITY. Year 1357. Year 1358. British: B.I.S.N. Coy., Ltd. 149 188 M. Strick-Ellerman Line 38 36 S. Asiatic S.N. Coy., Ltd. 5 6 M.

British 3 - Dutch 5 Norwegian 4 Norwegian 3 Of the above steamers, two hundred and thirty called at Manamah, and one hundred and seventy-six called at Sitrah. There is now a double service of B.I.S.N. Coy's, steamers at Manamah, one fast mail up and down, and one slow mail up and down, every week; and, as may be expected, the majority of the passenger traffic to and from India now passes on the fast mail. Another improvement in traffic occurs through mail being carried when possible upon the fast mail. In this connection it is curious to observe that while parcels sent from India to Bahrain proceed to Bahrain upon the fast mail the parcels for Bahrain sent from Europe proceed by the fast mail to Karachi only, where they appear to be re-sorted, and sent to Bahrain on the subsequent fast mail. This explains the delay in arrival at Bahrain of European parcels, which causes local complaint. The approximate quantity of oil products in tons exported in 1358 was 8,90,971 tons, as compared with 7,36,292 tons in 1357, which includes the re-export of products of crude oil imported from Arabia. I give below a comparison of the quantities of cargo brought to this port by cargo steamers (as distinguished from tankships) during the past year.63 The overside deliveries of Direct Transhipment Cargo shown above sufficiently indicate the importance of this port as a distributing centre for the Arabian mainland. The deliveries by the Pacific-Java-Silver, the Isthmian, the Mansa, and the Lloyd-Triestino Lines, aggregating 1,24,339 packages, may justly be regarded as material and stores for the C .A.S.O .C. on the mainland; while the balance, i.e. practically two-thirds of the total, would be for usual commercial purposes As the steamers' callings at Has Tanura increase, it may be assumed that this quantity will decrease. The system of issuing free manifests for cargo borne in Native Craft to the mainland ports of Saudi-Arabia is still maintained, and appears to be appreciated locally; but the arrangement for its reciprocation does not seem to be so well carried out. Complaints are heard of discrimination on the mainland in their Customs' assessments between import brought by Bahrain subjects and their own nationals. Complaints are also heard of Bahrain Craft Registration certificates being destroyed by Iranian Government officials. 1. Accidents within the Port On 3rd March 1939 (12th Muhurrum 1358) in a shumal storm, a local joliboat was sunk in the neighbourhood of Sheriba, and one person was drowned. The body was brought to shore, and interred. 2. In the same storm a local joliboat laden with 750 bags of cement, cargo delivered overside, intended for Al-Khobar, foundered in the Khor near Maharaq, and became a total loss. 3. On 10th November, 1939 (27th Eamadhan 1358) a sa'lor named Fakuda aboard s.s. 'Akagisan Maru' was struck in the back of his neck by a bag of cement falling from its sling. This Japanese was brought to The American Mission Hospital for treatment, bub died on the 12th December, 1939 (2nd Shawal, 1358). 4. On the night of 15-16 January, 1940 (6th Dhul Haj 1358), an unusually heavy storm struck a local craft loaded for Jubail, with 400 tins of kerosene oil and 300 bags of rice, and broke its anchor cables, so that the craft was wrecked near the Customs Pier. One of the crew was saved from drowning by a local sailor, but another was drowned. The craft and its cargo became a total loss. 5. Accidents outside the Port. In the same storm a Kuwaity boom foundered in the neighbourhood of Eas Tanura, and three passengers and one of the crew perished. The boom was later salvaged with great difficulty, and brought to Bahrain for re-conditioning; and it has now returned to Kuwait. 6. Establishment. During the past year the number of clerks employed was twenty-two, also two apprentices, who drew salaries and allowances amounting to Es. 41,784 , a slight increase upon the previous year on account of regular annual increments. The menials numbered thirty-nine, who drew Rs. 13,083 in wages. This staff dealt with the receiving, handling, and delivery of 8,28,245 packages of dutiable cargo, with the maintenance of the necessary records therefor, including a large volume of statistical reports for the service of the Political Agency. The duty-free imports by the Bahrain Petroleum Coy., Ltd., were also dealt with. In all, nine thousand five hundred and thirty-two Bills of Entry, five thousand seven hundred and six Shipping Bills, and one thousand nine hundred and four Direct Transhipment Bills were lodged for payment of duty and the relative appraisement. The institution of the Food Control system has given additional work to the Customs Department without any increase in staff. 7. Concessions and Exemptions. There is no import or export duty upon specie or bullion; and a considerable amount passes through Bahrain especially64 daring the Pearling Season, and also for financing the exchange between India and Saudi-Arabia. The gold exported during the past year has amounted to :— India ... Ks. 6,30.000 Iraq ... „ 1,99,500 England . ... „ 1,98,100 Arabia ... „ 7,700 Total ... Rs. 9,35,300 On account of its abuse for drinking purposes, the import of methylated spirits is effected only under Permit issued by H. B. M's Political Agent.
