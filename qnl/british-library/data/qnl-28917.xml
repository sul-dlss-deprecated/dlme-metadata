At 1^ast one plot of land the acquisition of which is desired falls within the area the acquisition of which by Government has I understand been urged by the I.G.C. 5.

Neither Mr. Yari nor * or 'en have a power of A- attorney which in my ooinion justifies me in recog nizing them as fully accredited agents of the firm and the former has b^en somewhat disingenuous in the matterNo. 4 NOTIFICATION. It is notified, for pener^l information, that owing to the le - ect ion of many of the officials of t&gt;ie Tapu department and the destruction of records, andjfor other adrinistrative reasons, the alienation of immovable property situated within the Occupied Territories of ’esoootamia to persons other than Arabs ox the Occupied Territories will not be recognized unless the previous sanction of the General Officer Commanding in CMef or of some persons authorized by him in this behalf has been obtain -d in writing, 3d. ?, Z, Sox, Dated, November 20th, 1917, Civil Commissioner.''S# c °py* % 1 &lt;m ■ Wf '■Jk 4V/ '■ j ■ ^ ♦ Mo* 6161-W* I Political Department. ;&gt; ^ 8 Bombay Oastle, 20 tii August 1918.
