No.of copies 7 received -5 Serial No. of XMEMORANDUM ON TRIBAL DIVISIONS IN THE PRINCIPALITY OF 'OMAN. TO ACCOMPANY TABLE OF TRIBES. The classification of the Arabian tribes or clans inhabiting ‘ Oman into two great divisions, “ Hinawi ” and “ Ghafiri,” is peculiar to that kingdom, and has been adopted in comparatively recent times. The modern history of ‘ Oman being mainly the narrative of the contentions between these great rival factions, a precise understanding of their mutual relations, and the origin of their differences, is desirable. With a view to a clear explanation of these points it is necessary to refer back to the older and better known tribal classifications. Arabian historians have divided all the tribes of Arabia into three primary classes. IsL El ’Arab el ’Arabeh, i.e., pure Arabs, those created speaking Arabic. 2nd. El ’Arab el Mota’arribeh, or genuine Arabs, those who acquired the Arabic language. 3r&lt;/. El ’Arab el Mosta’ribeh, or the naturalized Arabs. Of these three classes the first is considered to be lost or extinct, and there remain the classes known to Europeans as genuine Arabs and naturalized Arabs. The former consists of those descendants of Kahtan (or Joktan of Scrip ture), many of whom settled in Yemen, and they are also termed Kahtanite or Yemenite Arabs. The naturalized Arabs are said to be descended from Ishmael, but do not trace pedigree further back than ’Adnan. This class is termed Ishmaelite, ’Adnanite or Ma’addite, and also Nizarite, from Nizar bin Ma’add. The first Arab settlers in ‘ Oman came from Yemen, and were Kahtanite. Later immigrants arrived from the westward, and were mostly tribes of the Ishmaelite branch.The terms however, by which these rival branches were distinguished in ‘Oman were &lt;£ Yemeniyeh” and “Nizariyeh”; and these terms continued to be employed up to the beginning of the 18th century. At that epoch, civil wars occurred between the Yemeniyeh and Nizariyeh, in which the tribe Beni Hinah, under their leader Khalf bin Nasir, on the one side, and the tribe Beni Ghafir, under Mahommed bin Nasir, on the other, took pro minent part. Owing to the ability and reputation of these leaders, it happened that the Yemen tribes ranged themselves under Khalf the Hinawi and the Niza riyeh under Mahommed the Ghafiri. This circumstance led to the adoption of the terms “Hinawi” and “ Ghafiri” in their present extended sense, in supersession of the older and more correct nomenclature. The term Hinawi, therefore, as now applied, may be said to correspond with Yemeniyeh or Kahtanite, and Ghafiri with Nizariyeh, Ma’addic or Ishmaelite. With this modification, however, that, since the period of the adoption of the present party names, certain tribes have, from political causes, changed their denomination ; Hinawis becoming Ghafiris, and vice versa. From the supersession of the old system of classification it has resulted; firstly, that the tribes are ranged in political parties; and secondly, that the original genetical lines of demarcation are in course of being effaced. It would undoubtedly be possible still to classify the various clans according to the older systems, but for practical official purposes the division into “ Hinawi” and “ Ghafiri” must be adhered to. There can be no doubt that this is an instance where the assumption of a name or party cry has, to a considerable extent, influenced the course of historical events. At the present time, a Prince of a Yemen house is supported in power by the descendants of the settlers from Nejd. A reference to the table of tribes will show that the majority of the Hinawis follow the Ibadhi sect, whilst the opposite faction are mostly orthodox. This religious distinction was, in older times, more general and marked, but it is one which has powerfully affected the political condition and government of ‘ Oman. In some provinces the tribes of either division have usually recognized one ( hief, as the head of the faction generally, and the person so recognized is term ed Temimet.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000884.0x00013e_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/20/C57</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000884.0x00013e</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/20/C57</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Oman.
