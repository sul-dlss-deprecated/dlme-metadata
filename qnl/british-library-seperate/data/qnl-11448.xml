The note discusses 'The Status of the King of the Hejaz [Ḥusayn bin ‘Alī al-Hāshimī]' and 'The Status of Iraq', and largely focuses on British interests in Mesopotamia [Iraq]. The policy note makes it clear that Britain’s main objective was to gain control of the whole of Mesopotamia.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Hejaz</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Assistant Under-Secretary of State for India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Mesopotamia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Arabian Peninsula</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002dc#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
