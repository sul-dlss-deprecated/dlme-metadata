The codex was written in Nasta'liq in black ink by Ibn Sayyid Murad al-Husayni and illustrated by Muhammad 'Ali Mashhadi in 1068 AH/AD 1657. According to the colophon, Ibn Sayyid Murad al-Husayni copied the manuscript for the painter Muhammad 'Ali, the \"Mani of the time,\" as a \"souvenir.\" The fact that the manuscript was produced for one of the most prolific artists of 17th-century Iran makes it a highly significant document. It opens with an illuminated incipit with headpiece (fol. 1b) and closes with an illuminated tailpiece with colophon (fol. 21b). Text pages have interlinear illumination and small rectangular and triangular pieces with polychrome floral and scrolling vine motifs. There are 8 miniatures in a style associated with the Safavid centers of artistic production of Mashhad and Isfahan (fols. 5a, 9a, 10b, 13a, 14a, 16a, 17b, and 19b).", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/30391", "Keywords": "Islamic; Mughal; Persian; Safavid; Book; Calligraphy; Codex; Colophon; Illumination; Illustration; Manuscript; India; Iran", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "Safavid Dynasty", "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Muhammad Riza Naw'i Khabushani (died 1019 AH/AD 1610)", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.649.binding_ClsdTop_DD_300.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.649.binding_ClsdTop_DD_300.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.649.binding_ClsdTop_DD_300.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.649.binding_ClsdTop_DD_300.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.649.binding_ClsdTop_DD_300.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1507667", "ExhibIDs": "2827", "Images": "CPS_W.649.binding_ClsdTop_DD_300.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not on View"}
