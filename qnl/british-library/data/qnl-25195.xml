Sir: - I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknow- ledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant inclosing copy of a telegram from the Viceroy, reporting a rumour that French dealers in arms at uscat hope to defeat the Sultan's recent regulations by transhipping arms from Russian or German steamers into 'French dhows, instead of landing them. The Sultan requires advice as to the best method of overcoming the difficulty that would thus be created. 0 sir E. Grey presumes that the object of the A * manoeuvre is to prevent interference with the export of arms from Muscat to Persia and other Illicit destina tions and before giving any final opinion as to the advice to be offered to the Sultan., he would be glad to know what is the exact position at present as regards export of arms. Bub3 sets e Under Secretary of State, India Office.(52147/12) 4 Subjects of His Highness are of course prevented * by the regulations from purchasing arms out of the warehouse except in small quantities and by previous decrees of the Sultan from exporting arms to places where the importation is prohibited. It is not however apparent from the regulations what steps would be taken in the case of a French citizen wishing to remove arms from the bonded warehouse for export, as the provisions of Fule XI can, it would seem, only apply to the pur chase of arms by persons residing in Muscat. This at least was what Sir E. Grey understood when the terms of the rule were discussed with your department. / Meanwhiie Sir E. Grey is disposed to think that f'i i it would be difficult to carry on a flourishing trade under the conditions suggested in the Viceroy's telegram and that if the plan is tried it might be defeated by dealing with the German and Russian ships concerned when they enter the harbour, as offenders against uhe ordinary customs law of the place, which doubt h^ | provisions of which use could be made. On this last point I am to suggest Lord Crewe might perhaps thxntv it desirabledesirable that information should be obtained. // regards the Question of issuing a notification as the Viceroy proposes. Sir E. Grey thinks it would be sufficient for the present for the Sultan to issue a notice to his subjects, reminding them that Rule 4, which deals with all arms inported into 'uscat terrloorj necessarily covers, not only all goods lanced at Muscat but all goods brought into ' uscat territorial waters. Sir E. Grey is advised that the rule would bear this interpretation. When opportunity offers, it may be well to amend the wording of the .tatter part of Rule 5 so as to read after 'marked B' in line 5, 'showing all arms and ammunition and parts thereof which are carried on board their vessels and are intended to be discharged at Muscat. Sucn arms, ammunition and parts thereof must not be transhipped to another vessel but must be landed and taken direct to the arms warehouse in accordance with Rule 4. I am. Sir, Your most otodiont f huirib 1 e S e r v ant,5 On the other hand, I should like to make it plain that with the issue of the notification our chief difficulties are by no means over. The Sultan indeed himself seems to feel that he has crossed the Rubicon, and that the rest will be a simple task of adjustment with us, but there is clearly plenty of room left for disagreement in matters of detail, and one cannot say more than that the ground has been further cleared. 3. The point on which, as far as we can see, ve shall have most difficulty in coming to an understanding is the manner of the supply of the needs of Oman. In this regard the Sultan is no doubt in a difficulty. His subjects will not unnaturally resent having their freedom to purchase and sell arms curtailed, and he will no doubt earn a good deal of odium for co-operating with us in a scheme from which he received substantial compensation which, however, his subjects do not directly share. Again, there are plenty of interested persons ready to ply him with the argument that our motive in restricting the liberty of the Omani to arm himself is no doubt to reduce the population of Oman to a state of defencelessness, of which we shall take advantage when oppor tunity offers. However, I need not anticipate the difficulties which Major Knox or I are likely to meet with—they will develop as the negotiations progress, and we shall do our utmost to subject them locally to a process of gradual elumination before troubling Government. For the present I am leaving Major Knox to pursue single-handed a most difficult task, which, however, I am reasonably sanguine that patience will eventually carry to a satisfactory conclusion. Translation of vernacular letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the address of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, No. 124 M., dated the 2nd June 1912. After compliments .—I have now received an intimation of the approval of the British Government of the notification on the subject of the Maskat arms warehouse, which Your Highness, after consultation with the Political Agent and myself, expressed your readiness to publish forthwith. A copy of the notification is annexed to this letter. The British Government have, at the same time, inti cated their accept ance of the conditions, which Your Highness attached to the issue of the notification. That is to say, 1 am authorised to inform you on their behalf— (1) that the British Government undertake full responsibility to give Your Highness all necessary support to dispose of objections which may ensue from the Government of France or from other Powers; (2) that it is understood that the institution of the present arrangement does not give the British Government, or its officials, the right to take action in Your Highness’s territories in the future beyond what they have in the past; (3) that they are ready to come to a friendly understanding with Your Highness for the devising of suitable arrangements for the supply of the bond fide needs of Your Highness’s administration and subjects ; (4) that their undertaking to pay Your Highness compensation on the lines already agreed upon holds good and is confirmed. In making this communication to Your Highness, I have the honour to express the hope that the said Notification will be issued forthwith in the usual way.

After compliments .—With reference to my conversation with you of a few days ago, I have the honour to enclose a copy of a notification which Ihave issued this dav making known to the public my intention to introduce from the 1st September next a special warehouse in connection with the import of arms into my territories. . . , „ It is incumbent on me by way o£ friendliness to give you and your fellow .™r'oortlil fapp&gt;«, » »“ “nwmed, ,n rend.n ing the measure effective. Notification by His Highness the Sultan of Maskat and Oman, dated Maskat, the 4th June 1912. Whereas large quantities of arms and ammunition are at present stored without proper control in private buildings, distributed in this our town of Maskat, and thus exposed to the risk of attack, robbery or fire, we impressed by the serious menace to the safety of our capital arising therefrom, have resolved to remedy this state of affairs, in accordance with the needs of the times and the requirements of our municipal administration, by the con struction and establishment of a special customs house magazine or arms ware house for the storage of arms and ammunition under safe precautions. It is proposed to introduce this warehouse arrangement from on or about 1st September next. It will be conducted on the following general lines : Firstly—On or after 1st September all arms and ammunition or parts thereof imported into my territories will he taken direct from the steamer to the special arms warehouse, to the control of which a special Superintendent will be appointed by us. Secondly .—Similarly all arms-dealers in my territories will be required to deposit stocks remaining'in their hands on 1st September in the said warehouse. Any trader offending against this regulation will, in addition to other penalties, render all future consignments of arms and ammunition arriving in his name liable to confiscation, unless and until he complies with this regulation in full. Thirdly .—No arms will be allowed to issue from the warehouse until duty has been fully paid thereon to the Customs Superintendent in the usual way. Fourthly .—The withdrawal of arms from the warehouse will be regulated by the issue of special licenses prepared by the Superintendent and counter signed by myself. Fifthly .—Such licenses will not be granted to traders hut only to approved individual purchasers or their duly authorised agents, on the production of satisfactory proof that the number, quantity and destination of arms, ammu nition, &amp;c., to be withdrawn from the warehouse are free from justifiable objection. Sixthly .—All arms issuing from the warehouse will be marked with a special warehouse mark and serial number. Seventhly .—Special rules will be drawn up providing for and regulating the issue to approved traders of sample stock for exhibition in their shops. Eighthly .providing for the collection of arms warehouse charges, on stocks therein deposited, will he drawn up on the analogy of the present Customs House Hegulations for the levy of such fees on general merchandise. Ninthly. Special rules will be drawn up governing the transfer between traders’ stocks deposited in the arms warehouse. Tenthly. Special relaxations will be arranged for in favour of flint-locks, muzzle-loading gun powder and caps in reasonable quantities. Detailed rules embodying the above principles are under prepa ration and w ill be published in due course tor the further information of all concerned.

If, however, all other methods fail, we would agree to payment of compen sation for remainder of stocks that were in Maskat on 1st September on the understanding that this finally secures French acceptance of regulations precluding further obstruction on their part, together, if possible, with an assurance that they will discourage operations by French arms traders elsewhere in the Gulf. Further, to prevent bogus claims, we stipulate as suggested in Cox’s telegram of 14th December, 1442 : (1) that French stocks be at once inspected and sealed; (2) that persons and goods claiming French protection furnish documentary pyoof; and (3) that only stocks of other traders actually deposited_ in the warehouse be paid for.

We could not advisedly agree to purchase of the French without also purchasing stocks of the non-French traders already deposited in the warehouse, but provided it is worth our while to pay sum involved by all categories, I see no local objection to our doing so. It would seem unnecessary however, and unadvisable to include any stocks which had already left Muscat itself. , ^ /J On the latter assumption there would be, according to Muscat estimate approximately 12,000 rifles and 2,000,000 cartridges to pay for. Basing -C. / r calculation for present purposes on rate employed in letter 324 dated ^ f 5th March 1911, from Political Agent at Muscat to Foreign and taking average value of rifles at Rs. 60, and of cartridges at Rs. 60 per ' k thousand we arrive at a total of Rs. 840,000, say 60,000L, but this figure might be reduced if we could stipulate for 25 (sic.) invoice prices. m J If we undertake to compensate, I would urge condition that all French ' stock be formally inspected and sealed at once, and cases so sealed placed in ^ the warehouse within so many days for examination and assessment. If this is * not done, traders who are now selling arms cheap outside would be able to bring back unsold stocks to Muscat for inclusion. r*? yy ; We should also make it clear that while we are prepared to treat all those compensated on same basis, yet before admitting title to compensation fA and intervention of Irench Consulate, we shall reguire full documentary proofs that the individual nr xrnnds wnm tfimnsol-vT-oc! hr,^A -tidn .

WITH reference to my despatch No. 66 , Africa, of the 26th ultimo, I have the honour to aquaint you that I enquired of M. Poincare to-day, whether he could give me his views in regard to the suggestions which I had communicated to his Excellency on the 26th ultimo for a settlement of the question between the French Government and His Majesty’s Government on the subject of the Sultan of Muscat’s arms regula tions as an alternative to an arbitration. M. Poincare said that it had been necessary to consult the Ministries for Commerce, Agriculture, and the Colonies, and the replies from those departments were not complete. The Governor-General of Algeria wished for information as to what particular articles His Majesty’s Government had in view for the transit trade through Algeria, and the Ministry for Commerce was disposed to regard the suggestions as more advantageous to British than to Erench interests. His Excellency promised to let me have a reply as soon as possible, and on my reminding him that the end of the year was drawing near he observed that, in the absence of notice, the arrangement of 1897 in regard to cotton goods entering Tunisia would continue in force.

I had an interview v/fth the Minister for Foreign Affairs this afternoon in order to ask for his good offices with Monsieur Froinageot to obtain that gentle man’s services as Umpire in the Arbitration for the settlement of Pecuniary Claims between Great Britain and the United States, and I took advantage oi this opportunity to recur to the question oi the Muscat Arms Traffic. I askea His Excellency whether he -was pre pared with an answer to my last communication on one subject vis., that made to nim on the 1U on iiiotant, (reported to you in my despatch No.61 Africa oi the same date). si our Poincare said that the reply was nearly ready. The difficulty in regard to an arbitration was the sequestration of the French arms. I reminded His Excellency that he had spoken uo me of the Parliamentary difficulties which ne migot with e Right Honourable Sir Edward Grey, Bart., M.P., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.with if he accepted arbitration and if he would prefer another way than arbitration for dealing with the question I could offer him one and I then handed to him the memorandum of which I have the honour to transmit to you a copy herewith. Monsieur Poincare after reading it said that the question of the impoi oation of British cotton goods into Tunis was a very important one (une tres grosse question). Monsieur Moline nad urged him to denounce the arrangement of 1897, but he had for the present declined for he desired not to do anything to annoy (”froisser”) England. There was however a powerful combination of those interested in French cotton goods who would put pressure on tne Government for the abolition oi tne advantages unjoyed in Tunis by British cotton goods. I pointed out to Monsieur Poincare that Monsiem Briand when acting as Minister for Foreign Affaiis i nto r im nad represented to me the difficulties in one way of carrying out the stipulations of the 1-04 Agree ment in regard to the transit through Algeria oi Biiox^; goods destined for Morocco. By the offer which was made in the Memorandum His Majesty s Government wouldV — npr\ be Lie.king a very great aonceBBion to French interests, and in view of it the proposals might probably recom mend themselves to the French Parliament which His Excellency said it would be necessary to consult. Monsieur Poincare said that he would consider the memorandum but he would have to consult the Ministers of Finance Commerce and Colonies on the proposals con-1.

The French Government to recognise and place no further obstacle in the way of the execu in on of the recent Decrees of the Sultan of Muscat for the regula tion of the trade in arms. 3.

Political agent at Maskat wired 16tli November :— “ Sultan of Maskat to-day informed Admiral and myself that the French are concocting a new scheme for defeating warehouse system. They will ship arms and ammunition in German or Russian steamers, call it trans shipment cargo, and send French boat to discharge into, not landing it at Maskat at all. He wishes to know how to deal with case. According to instructions, it appears that His Highness will not be able to defeat this impudent and transparent fraud on his Customs Department, as well as his new arms traffic regulations.” To meet this, Cox suggests notification by Sultan prohibiting trans shipment to any jurisdiction where import is prohibited, except under license from jurisdiction concerned, coupled with rules on lines of Sections G to 10 of Arms Act, and Chapter XII. of Sea Customs Act. We think, however, that much simpler method will be for Sultan to issue a notification stating that warehouse rules apply to all arms brought into and trans-shipped in Maskat territorial waiters. Such arms to be regarded as imports to Maskat and taken to warehouse, but no duty to be imposed until removed for sale. This safeguards us against complaints under Article 10 of French Treaty. Such notification would accord with general principle of international law, and would be no more infringement of French treaty rights than existing rules. Enforcement of notification would be difficult, but we think that we should be prepared to assist with our ships if necessary.r a 3 k P ■ .

GUN-RUNNING IN MUSCAT. LORD LAMINGTON asked his Majesty’s Govern ment whether the arrangement made with the Sultan of Muscat for the prevention of gun-running was working satisfactorily, and whether the French Government were co-operating in the matter. VISCOUNT MORLEY said that the arrange ment made with- the Sultan by which arms were bonded, though by no means ideal, had worked as satisfactorily as a limited arrangement of that kind could work. His noble friend referred to the atti tude of the French Government. The French Government had their own difficulties. We were perfectly sensible of them. But he was glad to think and hope that the French Government, which could not have two minds |us to the demands of civilization in this case, were doing the best they could to meet us in the matter. The adverse con tention held by the French Government to the arrangement we made with the Sultan was that these arms were not merely bonded or sequestrated, but confiscated. In our view that was not the case, and we should continue to use every effort with the. French Government tp bring them actively and fully into line with us. LOUD LAMINGTON.—Does the noble viscount mean to say that the arms which are bonded are considered by the French Government to be con fiscated ? VISCOUNT MORLEY said that the arms were undoubtedly bonded, and one contention of an important interest in France was that what we called “ bonded ” was in truth confiscation. But the relations between ourselves and the French Govern ment upon the Muscat question were such that the present moment was particularly inopportune for a discussion of the case in Parliament.

AN UNFOUNDED REPORT. From Our Own Correspondent PARIS, Thursday Night. The French cruiser Montcalm, which left Brest the other day for the Far East, will call on her way at Muscat. No particular import ance need be attached to this visit with regard to the ancient question of gun-running expedi tions, and it is quite wrong to infer that the French Government intends making anything like a demonstration in the matter. For the time being the Montcalm is lying oh the coast of Syria. I BRITAIN &amp; FRANCE. FRENCH CRUISER FOR MUSCAT. THE TRAFFIC IN ARMS. The difference between Great Britain and I'ranee regarding.the traffic in arms at Muscat, at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, has once more reached a troublesome stage. France has taken the significant step of sending a large cruiser to Muscat. The vessel in question is now on its way to that port. Great Britain has responded in similar fashion. There is no warship in the East Indies Squadron equal in size to the French vessel. A large cruiser has there fore been specially detached from the China Squadron and is now proceeding to Muscat. The trouble has arisen in consequence of the recent arrangement between Great Britain and the Sultan of Oman, under which that potentate has taken special measures to stop the arms trade at his various ports. Great Britain is deeply concerned, because it is from Muscat and other ports of Oman that Afghan traders have obtained the vast quantities of rifles and ammunition with which the tribes on the North-West Frontier of India have been supplied. For the. last three years the East Indies Squadron has at intervals maintained a costly blockade along the Mekran coast against dhows from Oman ports laden with arms. • About eighteen months ago an expedition commanded by Admiral. Slade landed in Persian Mekran to disperse Afghan gun-runners, who were roving the district in strong force. ' The arrangement recently made be- ; tween Great Britain and the Sultan of Oman seemed likely to terminate this ne farious traffic for ever. France, however, ■ proceeded to bring pressure to bear on the Sultan, who is associated with Great Britain by special ties. It is unquestion ably as a development of this pressure that the French cruiser is being sent to Muscat. France wishes the new arrange ment between Britain and the Sultan to be terminated. The purpose of the visit of the cruiser is not denied, although its ultimate destination is farther east. Other French warships have occasionally called in a casual way at Muscat, but the object of the coming visit is more definite. French interests in Muscat are defined ih an old treaty which for all practical purposes is obsolete. Under cover of this treaty and in defiance of the wishes of the Sultan, one or two French subjects have built up a lucrative trade in arms bec-ween France and the North-West Fron tier of India, by way of Muscat. Other nations, including Great Britain, have in the past largely participated in the traffic. The French traders have the sup port of a few French deputies. They are also supported by the small Colonial Group in the French Chamber, which has advanced the amazing proposal that in exchange for the abrogation of this worth less treaty Great Britain should hand over to France the British Colony of Gambia, in West Africa. The suppression of the whole traffic is only prevented by the ad herence of France to her treaty. This trivial question has at intervals embarrassed the relations of the British and French Governments during more than ten years. Its settlement is blocked because no French Ministry seems strong enough to overcome the interested opposi tion of a handful of deputies.4511'l 2 - Enclosure v- 4 5 'i, er from F r ‘ 7 NOV 44 Telegram P., No. 1237, dated (and received) the 30th October 1912.

From—L ifutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to paragraph 3 of my letter* No. 2621, dated the 17th October 1912, I have the honour to • Semi No. 33 . address Government on the question of the notice to be taken of the Shaikh of Shargah’s failure to co-operate with the son of the Residency Agent in connection with the recent seizure of arms at Thowaimah. 2 Subsequent to the seizure of the consignment, the Residency A £entf who had been absent at Ras-el-Khaimah, wrote to complain that his son had seen Arab strangers from Katar or Nejd lurking suspiciously in the vicinity of his premises and that on one night a shot had been fired at his house, and that Shaikh Sagar, on the matter being represented to him, had pooh-poohed his son’s apprehensions and had neglected to take serious precautions as requested. I therefore telegraphed to Captain Birdwood whom I had deputed to the Coast in the “ Lawrence ” in connection with the British India Com pany’s affairs and who was then en route, to call at Shargah and give the Shaikh a rousing and inform him that if I heard any more of these apparently well-founded apprehensions on the part of our Agent or his son, I shou advise Government to give Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif a sepoy guard. I attach copies of Captain Birdwood’s report of a letter from Shaikh Sagar to me, and of my reply to him. It is hardly surprising that the Residency Agent and his son, who have nothing in the shape of a personal o&gt;uard except their own household retainers, should have felt somewhat apprehensive after the recent seizure, and of course where the arms-tradmg gentry are concerned acts of violence or revenge are by no means incon ceivable : but Captain Birdwood and the Arabic Munshi who accomparned him did not derive the impression that our representatives were m such linger as to make measures of our own at present necessary and unless the R I. M. S. “ Minto ” brings any unsatisfactory news, I think the action taken will suffice. News by last mail (Lebai, 16th) was normal. 3. It remains to appraise Shaikh Sagar’s behaviour in neglecting to co operate in the seizure of the arms. In No. 4i5, dated 27 th September 1912. j^is connection I attach a copy of the Agent’s report in reply to my query. The position proves to have been Ag F F J practically that anticipated in paragraph t Serial No. 380, Part xi. ^ i e tterf No. 2221 of 15th Septem ber. Shaikh Sagar, as the GoTernment of India must be aware from the reports of the past, is hopelessly inert and apathetic in all his affairs, but e is not in any way disaffected, and in the present case it is necessary to view his conduct from his standpoint as well as our own. I find it difficult to know what precise recommendations to make to Government either m this connection or in regard to a later report just received from the Residency 4„ent to the effect that “ since the recent seizure of arms at Thowaimah, the ffidividuals who transport arms from the Batinah Coast to the hinterland of he Truffial Coast town, no longer find it safe enough to leave their consign- ments in the charge of Bedouins, but are now bringing the weapons actually into the towns of Debai, Shargah and Ajman . . . n .. I have already made suggestions in ml M./mr D “ P ‘ rt ' ' regard to this phase of the traffic and Teleer*m§ from Foreign Department to Resident, , reaSOUS which made Government Ho. aio s., dated tbe 25tb May ^inclined to accept them have not ceased i i isi no a ss it ^ e * ist in the meaiiwbUe -. 4. The practical prospect which we have to contemplate in making our present dispositions seems lo be this .32 We hope that an early arrangement with the French will make the Warehouse arrangement completely effective and will practically put an end to the import of arms to Maskat, in which case the present export through the Trucial Coast may he considered limited to the number of arms now loose in the hinterland, and will ere long die a natural death. Meanwhile, however some thousands of arms have left Maskat since 1st September and probably most of them are now being got rid of via the Trucial Coast and Katar. We hope, simultaneously, that during the coming cold weather we shall strengthen our general position on the Trucial Coast and our check on the Chiefs by alighting at Zora. If it is considered that this action can be taken at once and the arms smuggling from this coast dealt with effectively at the j same time, so much the better. If, on the other hand, the Government of India consider that, though in all probability these hopes will be realised, the project must take its present deliberate course, then I am inclined to recommend th;it we confine our action for the present to a forcible warning on behalf of the Government of India to the three Shaikhs above-mentioned, a propos of the Agent’s latest report, concluding with the hint that unless they exert them selves to put a stop to the use of their towns and coast for illicit export, we shall be driven to impose heavy fines upon them for their neglect, or even to take our own measures on shore for the purpose. To Shaikh Sngar mi^ht be added an expression of the Government of India’s surprise and strong disapproval of his neglect to co-operate with us in the Thowaimah case. Such a reprimand would be another step towards the ultimate intimation of our intention to occupy Zora and introduce the telegraph. At the same time, if the need for concentration at Maskat admits of it, I trust that His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief may find it possible to send one of His Matesty’s ships back to the Trucial Coast beat as soon as practicable. 5. The only feasible alternative course to one of the above seems to me to be to exact, either as a fine or as security for the fulfilment of their obliga tions, a sum of Es. 5,000 orEs. 10,000 from the Shaikhs of Debai, Shargah and Ajman, to be retained until such time as the coast has been purged from the export and sale of arms. This course would be quite justified by the facts, but, on the other hand, it would create in the minds of the three ‘Shaikhs a reeling of soreness, which has its inconvenient aspect if we soon intend to carry out the occupation of Zora on the pacific and “ telegraphic ” lines hitherto contemplated. ° r 6 '«, S ! 1 ?u ld ha PP e °&gt; as the res ult of the success of the Maskat Ware- th . a “ h ® a . rms tra T d ; n ? community show any signs of arranging direct shipments to Katar, as I hare heard adumbrated, then we shall be faced with nn^nrtl»l!i deV f e ° I l meilt i ° £ , t l le arms traffie question which will need more comprehensive treatment alhoc- but in regard to this contingency I am i addressing Government separately. 5 ^ InnV koil ^ at tljm Government of India wili he pleased to give the out- whL tb T e r hr; :,r SldU ? tl r- a , nd f . aT0Ur me with ^ ; mean- tnmee Ltlu^X thtCto ^ ^ “ d CommandX-i’n.Chiih 161 ’ S comnlunicate&lt; l His Excellency the Naval Xeport by First Assistant Captain R, L.

The (First) Assistant came to us and informed us that our brother the Agent, Khan Bahadur Shaikh Abdul Latif, has expressed his apprehension to you and that he had already communicated the same to us, but that we did not do what was incumbent on us in affording him protection, i his is a matter even the mention of which is not desirable and it never occurred to us that we should not afford protection to him or that we should not do what is necessary. Our understanding is not so small as that, thanks be to God, and your Agent is respected by us and we do not withhold the necessary protection, consideration and respect from him, and you should not think about us but what is good, and should not listen to the words of mis- representers of facts who communicate them to him for their own objects in order to bring about dissension between us and you. And we have explained to him not to hear the statement of those who misrepresent matters and interested parties and that, by the grace of God, he will not notice any failure on our part in what is necessary in all circumstances. And we pray to God for success and a good end. This is what was required to be stated and we will esteem it an honour to do what you may require of us. No. 229, dated Bushire, the 24th October 1912. From—L ieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— Shaikh Sagar bin Kwaled, Chief of Shargah. After compliments.— I was greatly displeased and surprised to receive from Sharjah the report of vour failure to take proper precautions to provide for the safety of Isa bin Abdul Latif and of the protection of the Agent’s house from the attentions of suspicious strangers from the people of the West. Immediately on hearing it I telegraphed to my First Assistant, who was en route to Debai, to call and see you and give you a message from me. I have now received his report regarding the assurances which you gave him and also your letter of 1st Zilkhadah (13th October) in which you repeat the same assurances to me, and for these I thank you. But my friend, what is necessary in these cases is real co-operation and action at the time. Harm can only be warded off by precautions and not by words alone. In taking tlie action which he did against the arms smugglers, Isa hin Abdul Latif was in the highest degree acting in the interests and earning the approval of the Residency and of the Great Government, and if you are unable or slow to take all necessary measures for his safety and his father’s, and of their property, Government will not hesitate to make their own arrange ments.34 In view of your explicit assurances and captain Bird wood’s report, J accept what you promise me for the present, but R. I. M. S. “Minto” will call in a few days, and if the news she gives is not satisfactory, I shall have to recommend other steps to Government, so, it is an urgent matter for you not to fail in any way to keep the Agent and his family safe and guarded. This is what had to be explained. May you be preserved and salaams. No. 415, dated the 27th September 1912. From—The Residency Agent, Sbargah, To— Lieutenant-Colonel Sie Pekcy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to report that Shaikh Sagar did not afford any assistance whatever in the matter of the seizure of the arms and that he even refused to keep the three Arabs whom we had captured with the arms until I stat&lt;d to him that he would be responsible to the High and Imperial Govern ment if the said men escaped from him. Even then he confined them without fetters and the men would have probably escaped if Your Honour had not arranged for them to be taken away by the man-of-war. I did not expect, indeed, that Shaikh Sagar would fail to render assistance in the arms question and that he would not even send tw r o men to ascertain the report concerning the weapons while they were lying at Thowaimah. I imagine that the Shaikh was under the impression that the arms had been escorted by Bedouins and that fighting and war would be the inevitable result ii he sent anyone on his behalf. He delayed his measures, therefore, and told Isa that if he (Isa) was bent upon seizing the weapons, he (Shaikh Sagar) would appoint a number of outsiders, such as Baluchis and others, so that he may go accompanied by them to seize the arms. There is no doubt that the delay on the part of Shaikh Sagar and his remark to Isa that the latter should proceed to seize the weapons with persons who should not be inhabitants of Shargah, were due to his apprehension that a fight would take place between the Bedouins and Isa and his party ; and that (he had made this suggestion) so that he may employ the excuse, in the case of an emergency, that Isa himself took measures in seizing the arms. Isa, however, ventured to proceed towards the aims on the strength of the assurance given by the Bedouins who accompanied him and who had made a condition to receive presents and to be entitled to remuneration if the arms reached the Agency house. 62 No. 2758, dated Bushire, the 27th October (received 4th November) 1912 (Confidential).

The Mudir of Customs says the import is not prohibited in Turkey and they do not appear to be prescribed by the regulations. The ten cases were landed at the Custom House as usual and all have now been cleared except the one case for Adnan Saleh Zelkha, which is still lying there. There is no European now in charge of the Austrian Ld. Co. or (Aktien Handels-gesellschaft , but the native agent, Eliaho Levy, says he got out six cases for detail sale as ordered by Basrah shop-keepers. The caps are used by the Arabs in Montific and in Nejd, and he says they are not destined for Persia. Moshi Isaac Zelkha states he sold his three cases to a Nejdi from Kuwait, who had also bought up six other cases (presumably those sold by the Austrian firm to the retail firms), and that the Nejdi intended taking them to Kuwait to sell to Nejd Arabs, the season for these sales being from September to November yearly. He too says they are not destined for Persia. He did not know the name of the Nejdi from Kuwait who bought them. The import of loaded cartridges of all kinds, rifie and sporting, is now prohibited in Turkey, and the Arabs, especially those in Montific, are in diffi culty as regards ammunition. It may be that they too are using these caps for their old-fashioned arms and employing loose charges. 63 No. 2818, dated Bushire, the 27th October (received 4th November) 1912 (Confidential). From Lieutbnant-Colonel Sib Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In connection with my letter* No. 2706, dated 24th October 191.2, I have the honour to offer some observ- • Serial No. 6i. ations on the present aspect of the posi tion at A1 Bidaa, and in Katar generally, regarded alike from the point of view of the arms traffic and of our comprehensive negotiations with the Porte for the settlement of conflicting interests in the Gulf. 2. Pursuant to my letter No. 1660, dated 25th June 1911, authority was accorded me to endeavour to get the Bin Thani family to agree to n . otlf y a prohibition of the import of arms, a development which, it w^as considered, would eliminate the remaining recognised loophole for the disposal of arms, and would deprive the French smuggling clique at ^ ask .at of a colourab y unprohibited destination for their wares. The Bin Thani family, however, politely declined to come in with us, feeling no doubt that tbe financial prospects of Katar as an emporium greatly surpassed those ot any inducement we might offer in the way of a subsidy.—_— 36 The A1 Bidaa problem was next dealt with in my telegram, No. 17 M., dated 26th November 1911, to the Government of India, and in Government of India secret despatch No. 24, dated 15th February 1912, w ith enclosures, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State. The proposals made in the latter communication were probably not made the subject of lively consideration in London as in the meanwhile friendly negotiations had been inaugurated with the Porte for the general adjustment of our interests in the Gulf, and the question of Katar came under specific consideration in this connection a month later. It is not known precisely what stage the negotiations, then re-opened, had reached, when, earlier in the present month, war broke out between Turkey and the Balkan States; or whether or not they stand any chance of being resumed, on the conclusion of hostilities, at the point at which they were adjourned. But there seems every reason to apprehend that they may be at a standstill for an indefinite time to come. Meanwhile, the speedy advance of A1 Bidaa as an emporium for the distribution of arms and the threatened possibility, freely advocated and discussed in the local bazars, of a direct foreign steamer call at that port, in supersession of Maskat, provide a prospect which we cannot safely allow to take shape. 3 . Without fuller knowledge of the precise position at the moment of the problems under negotiation with the Porte, it is difficult for me to formulate particular suggestions for present adoption, and my motive in addressing Government now is rather to urge that the Katar question be taken into immediate consideration with due regard to the present state of Anglo-Turkish politics, with a view to a decision being arrived at as to whether or not we are in a position to take independent action forthwith to bring Katar into the fold. If it is decided that measures are possible and expedient, His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, who is now at Maskat and to whom I have forwarded a copy of this letter, will, doubtless, be in a position to suggest, in consultation with me if necessary, the most feasible form that such measures might take. 64 Telegram P., No. 102, dated the 2nd November 1912.

I cannot undertake that Sultan would confiscate, whether free or not to do so, the arms and ammunition exported in contravention of the second undertaking if their arms were restored to French traders. Extreme limit of concession would he suspension of those clauses of the regulations regarding confiscation until the result of the arbitration, and an undertaking that if the French, in the event of adverse decision, submitted to regulations, clauses re confiscation would not have retrospective elfect and would not he enforced until the French had had time to remove their stocks now detained, sav, three months after the announcement of the result of the arbitration.Dr a ft t o F* 0 . j^pr ? ffr-t/fl'-) jiy d-y t Sv5&lt;^' IMMEDIATE.

With reference to my letter of the fCj instant, respecting the progress of the negotiations with the French Government respecting the Muscat Arms Regulations, I am directed by Secretary Sir E.

It will be seen that His Excellency asks for i information as to the policy which it is proposed to pursue with regard to the question of granting compensation for arms which have been deposited in bond since the 1st % September last, and Sir E.

I am, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, The Under Secretary of State, India Office.[This Pocument is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's | (N 0&gt; 64. Africa.) Sir, Paris, November 16, 1012. WITH reference to your telegram No. 7, Africa, of the 6th instant, and your despatch No. 278, Commercial, of the 13th instant, on the subject of the suggested negotiations for an arrangement with the Prencli Government to include the questions of the Muscat arms traffic, the Tunis cotton trade, and the Moroccan transit trade, I have the honour to inform you that I to-day handed to M. Poincard a note drawn up in the terms of the enclosure in your despatch above-mentioned. I take it that your intentions are as follows, viz., that I should avail myself of the opportunity when M. Poincare replies to the communication which I made to him on the 13th instant (see my despatch No. 61, Africa, of that date), and to previous communications on the subject of the Muscat arms traffic, to say to his Excellency that, as he is aware, His Majesty’s Government feel it incumbent on them in defence of vital British interests to support the Sultan of Muscat in enforcing his recent decrees; but that part of His Majesty’s Government in supporting the Sultan in a controversy with France, as well as the unfortunate effect of an acute difference between such friendly Powers as England and France over Muscat affairs. You, therefore, have instructed me, with a view to obviating so undesirable a state of affairs, to suggest some arrangement by which the matter at issue may be settled a l'amiable. I should then mention to his Excellency that it has occurred to His Majesty’s Government that an arrangement might be come to on the following lines:— 1. His Majesty’s Government to consent to waive their rights to absolute equality of treatment between French and British goods in transit for Morocco through Algeria, as set forth in the note handed to his Excellency on the 16th November; 2. The French Government to agree to recognise and place no further obstacle in the way of the execution of the recent decrees of the Sultan of Muscat for the regulation of the arms traffic; 3. The French Government to give an assurance, to be made public or not as they may wish, that, during a term of fifteen years, they will not denounce the arrangement of 1897 by which British cotton goods entering Tunis are not subject to import duties higher than 5 per cent, ad valorem. In the discussion which would doubtless ensue, I should say to M. Poincar^that it seemed to you that such bilateral concessions should be easy to defend if any criticisms were made in Parliament, but that it was obvious that a French trade in arms in Muscat could not weigh in the balance against the renunciation on the part of His Majesty s Government of their rights under article 4(2) of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1904 about Morocco, as these rights secured advantages for a great variety of British hade, actual and prospective, and constituted an important asset obtained by Great litain in the Anglo-French agreements of 1904. A prolongation of the lunis arrangement of 1897 would therefore be absolutely necessary if a fair bargain was to be struck between the two countries. It would be useful for me to know the views of His Majesty’s Government as o the question of granting some compensation to the French houses whose arms have een deposited in bond under the Sultan’s decrees since the 1st September, and jl e ther there would be any question, for instance, of His Majesty s Government or e n dian Government taking them over. It would not be necessary for me to enter into this matter when I broach the question of a negotiation to M. Poincare, but the claim to compensation is sure jONPWENTIYL. [A] ARMS TRAFFIC.

On the 28th October the French Ambassador suggest ed as a way out of the difficulty in regard to the suspension of the regulations pending arbitration, that the arms already confiscated might be restored and that there might be a cessation of the import of French arms meanwhile. It was explained to Sir F. Bertie on the 6th instant, for the information of the French Government, that no arms belonging to French nationals had so far been confiscated, nor was it intended to confiscate any pending a rapid arbitration if that could be de cided upon forthwith. All that had happened was that arms arriving since September 1st had been placed in the bonded warehouse. It was impossible to agree to a cessation in the import only of French arms because that would imply that the large quantity of arms and ammunition belonging to French citizens, which have arrived at Muscat since the above-mentioned date and which are now in the warehouse, would at once be dis tributed among persons whose only object, for the most part,part, is to foment trouble in Persia and Afghanistan. The fact that no confiscations are at present taking place is in itself practically a serious modi fication of the regulations and one which cannot con tinue very much longer. Foreign Office.

BEITISH EfvIBASSY, PARIS. November His Majesty’s Government have re ceived and considered the proposals for executing Article IV (2) of the Anglo- French Declaration of li04 as regards British trade in transit through Algeria to Morocco, contained in the Note from the Minister for Foreign Af fairs ad interim dated August Sth last. These proposals, which would have the effect of limiting the interpretation and restricting the execution of the British rights under the Anglo-French Declaration, have occasioned consider able surprise to His Majesty’s Govern ment who were the less prepared to re ceive them as in the various communica tions from former French Governments onon the subject, no disposition was shown to question the extent of these rights. Indeed, in Monsieur Pichon's Note of May 27th 1909 it is expressly J stated that tie French Governaen t w ere 'desireux de donner pleine valeur a cents clause comrne a toutas celles qui sent inscritss dans la m§me arrangement' His Majesty*s Government regard the stipulation in the Anglo-French De claration on the subject of British trade in transit to Morocco as an impor tant part of the general agreement of 1904 with France, as they consider that it is designed to enable British trade fully to participate on terms of absolut equality with French trade in the exten sion of commerce in Eastern, South Eastern and Central Morocco which must, inevitably ensue from the establishment of a French protectorate in Morocco and the opening up of those regions to trade through the construction of railways andof conr:''unloa the increased facilities -tion with the Mediterranean seaboard. That such equality cf treatment between British and French trade was fore seen in the negotiation of the Agreements between Great Britain and France in 1904 is shown by a despatch from the Marquess of Lansdowne to His Majesty’s Ambas sador at Paris, dated April 8th, 1904, enclosing the Convention and Declarations signed by the French Ambassador in Lon don and His Lordship. It is stated in this despatch, which was laid before parliament, that the French Government had undertaken 'that British commerce, ”including goods in transit through 'French territory and destined for the 'Moorish market, is to be treated on a 'footing of absolute equality with that 'of France'. His Majesty’s Government have ex perienced considerable difficulty in meeting the protests of British commer-commercial interests concerned in the trade with Morocco against the ncn- execution up to the present of Article IV (2) of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1904 - a state of affairs for which they are not responsible as they have repeatedly pressed upon the French Gov ernment the necessity of carrying it in to effect. It would he difficult for His Majesty's Government to justify them selves before Parliament, in face of the protests which would be raised, if they were now to accept a restricted inter pretation of the rights obtained, under that Article of the Declaration. His Majesty's Government cannot ad mit that the validity of these rights, formally granted to Great Britain by the Agreement of 1904, is affected by the considerations now put forward by the French Government as to the claims which may he made by other nations as a con sequenceconsequence of the execution of Article IV (2) of the Declaration; nor can they accept the suggestion that the character and extent of actual British trade with Morocco afford a proper criterion for estimating the future commercial rela- tions between Great Britain and that country, as they hold that the changes which may he expected to ensue as a re sult of the French Protectorate are likely in the future, hy facilitating the influx of Europeans and the crea tion of townships, settlements &amp;c., to alter considerably the present condi tions of trade. His Majesty's Government feel them selves therefore obliged to insist on the full execution of the stipulation contained in Article IV ( 2 } in favour of all classes of British goods in transit through French territory to Morocco. They would desire again to call the attention of the French Govern ment to the proposals contained in the draftdraft agreement for carrying out Ar ticle IV ( 2 ) communicated to Monsieur Pichon on May 15th, 1909, and would point out that in order to make that draft agreement complete it only re mains in their opinion, for the French Government to make known the conditions of transit and points of entry on the Moroccan frontier, established in regard to French goods, so that British goods may he assimilated to them, and receive the absolute equality of treatment which His Majesty’s Government have a right to claim under the Anglo-French Declaration of 1904.py- 89C)o. 7599) essing.

Foreign Office, London. Sir: - f I ara directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. P. 420? of the 1st instant, respecting the Arms Traffic at Muscat. Copy of a telegram on the subject bo His Majesty's Ambassador at Paris dated the 6th instant, has already been forwarded to you in my letter of the 7th instant. I am however now to suggest that the following method of dealing with French rights at Muscat might render it unnecessary to have recourse to arbitration on the question. As the Marquess of Crewe is perhaps aware His Majesty's Government have for the past eight years been in controversy with the French Government as to the proper interpretation of Article IV 2 of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1904, which, in the view of His Majesty's Government, gives British goods an entire equality of treatment with French goods in transit through Algeria to Morocco for a period of •»1 (47314/12) The positive value to His Majesty’s Government / of these rights is not great at present, though it might well increase with the development of Morocco. Their assertion is however inconvenient to the French Government who forsee that similar claims may he made on the part of Germany and other nations possessing a right to most favoured nation treatment. The French Government have therefore teen endeavouring to escape from their liability, or at any rate to reduce it to the smallest possible proportions. Recently the Board of Trade who do not attach great importance to the privilege in question, as the French Government are.so likely to make it illusory, have suggested that it should be given up in exchange for a prolongation of the present arrangement in re gard to cotton duties in Tunis. This arrangement, which limits the duties to f^ive per cent ad val o r em, can be denounced with six months notice on December 31st next or on any day subsequent to that date. Sir E. Grey considers that such a bargain would not do justice to the value of British rights under the Declaration(47314/12) (4 Declaration of 1904, which there is strong reason to believe are a source of serious annoyance to the French Government. It is therefore suggested that the French should be asked to abandon their rights under their Treaty with Muscat of 1844, in addition to granting the extension of the arrangement respecting cotton duties. It would not be suggested that the Treaty of 1844 should be cancelled altogether, but merely that the British Interpretation of it should be so far accepted that it should be admitted to be within the rights of the Sultan to act as he has done in regard to the Trade in Arms. It is hoped that a proposal of this nature would not.arouse any very violent opposition in the French Chamber, and there is some reason to believe that the French Government in the absence of such oppo sition would be disposed to consider favourably any proposal which would enable them to put an end to the present situation as regards Muscat. It is therefore proposed that His Majesty’s Ambassador should, without delay, be instructed to address to the French Government a nooe insisting on British(47314/12) British rights under the 1904 Agreement, and that shortly afterwards it should he intimated to Monsieur Poincare in conversation that His Majesty's Government might consent to negotiate on the subject. The exchange of British rights in Morocco against French rights in Muscat and the continuation of the Tunis cotton duties could then be suggested. The proposal as regards Muscat would be made without prejudice to the rights of His Majesty's Government in the matter, and Sir E. Grey does not consider that the British case for arbitration, should arbitration prove necessary, would be weakened by the proposal being made. I am to enquire whether Lord Crewe agrees to the adoption of the course indicated in which case the necessary instructions will be sent to Paris as soon as possible. I am.

No confiscations of arms in possession of French nationals have yet taken place, and all that has happened is that cargoes which have arrived since 1st September have been deposited m bond, noi will any confiscations be made pending rapid arbitration if French Government accept without delay. It would not, however, be sufficient that import of arms should be suspended, as M.

Instructions on the subject will be sent to you in a few days m the commercial series.” Negotiations referred to are for cession of certain British rights in Morocco in exchange for French acceptance of Sultan of Muscat’s regulations. In view oi language used above, His Majesty’s Government think it better not to confiscate until the French have had a reasonable time to reply. I will telegraph again, and in meantime consignment should be detained in warehouse. Explanation to Sultan should be that as there has been no confiscation so far, it would be a mistake to begin at the moment when His Majesty’s Government are trying to bring French to agree to regulations by friendly means.c i Foreign Secret, ultimo :— From Viceroy, 4:th November 1912. Muscat Arms Traffic. Knox telegraphed 15th u To-day German S.S. “ Nicomedia ” has landed 171 cases arms and ammunition on an incomplete manifest form b, consignee’s name not entered. These are clearly liable to confiscation under Rule 6. “ I recommend that I may be allowed to advise immediate confiscation, as lack of saleable arms in the Muscat warehouse causes Sultan some anxiety regarding his Omani subjects who are being persuaded that their supplies of arms and ammunition are being cut off. I think for the present His Highness will not permit issue from warehouse except in accordance with rules, and this lot of arms and ammunition will enable him to undersell French. Consignor is Louis Dieu, so French Consul shonld be informed they are confiscated under Rule 6.” Cox wires 17th ultimo. ‘‘Muscat telegram 201, J5th October. Case on its fiscal merits is clearly one for confiscation, and if we do not let Sultan make good his rules there is danger of his attitude weakening owing to doubt as to our readiness to see him through. Frimd facie therefore I think we should either inform him that we will support him in confiscating out right, or specifically ask him, as a conciliatory act, to suspend confiscation in this case on the grounds that French are about to withdraw their objections to operation of rules. In the former case His Highness does not appear called on to inform or discuss matter with French Consul.” “ Letter received from Political Agent last night makes it clear that French subjects in Muscat are making themselves as truculent and offensive as possible, apparently in the hope of provoking an incident calculated to force French Government to act against the Sultan. Tension at Muscat is very acute. Is there any fresh news of negotiations or hope of early solution ? ” This appears excellent opportunity of showing French sincerity of our intention to enforce rules, and strong action is more likely to bring Muscat French subjects their senses than weak line.

Our position in tbe Gulf would be sacrificed if the regulations for the arms traffic were suspended. _ M. Gambon urged that it was impossible for a tribunal to sit to consider such a case unless the regulations were suspended. I said, on the contrary, that the regulations did not prohibit trade—they regulated it; and the object of the tribunal would be to decide whether, in fact, such regulations did inflict damage on a legitimate trade, for which compensation should be given. ^ It seemed to me that it would be very difficult to decide this point unless the regulations were enforced. 1 am, &lt;xc.

I repeated my statement, and urged that France should agree to regulations, and arbitration would decide question of compensation; we should have to send ships to Muscat, and the situation would become very awkward.

'Karan,ia' and subsequently transferred to H.M.S. 'Pelonis'. A further request was received later to renove the 3 prisoners who were taken with the arris; these were surrendered to H.M.S. 'Peloms' and are being taken to Jashk. It is understood that they are the servants of 3 Masqat Arras Merchants but this has not yet been verified. Ho reports have been received frora Makran and Byaban, but R badans are reported to be waiting with arras on the Batinah Coast, their intention being to cross to the neighbourhood of Maidani. \ A dhow with a considerable cargo of arms was reported to have left Matra on the night of the 9th September♦ Acting on instructions received overnight, a steamboat was sent., on receipt of the report, to look for her but owing to a fair wind the dhow was not found. The fact that a steamboat had been searching dhows in the offing soon became known in the Bazaars and as a resnli, no dhows with arms in quantity are believed to have left Masqat or Matra since then. The few remaining arms requiring removal to the Batinah Coast are believed to have been put on board the French dhow 'Faith FI Khair' which left Matra on the night of the 15th of September. As a result of the steam cutter’s cruise, a written protest against seizing Oman dhov7s was received fro?i the PoliticalPolitical Agent, Masqat* The Bucknall Line S*S* n ! ^shona 11 airivod early on the 14th Septenher, details of the ar^s and anminltion brought out by her 'ire attached.

The Feast of Id passed off quietly, and I can still see no sign of any unfriendliness on the part of the Arabs: though there are many wild rumours about, It is probable that these are started by interested parties. The crews of the dhows captured by H.M.S. 'Miner' on 23rd May 1912, have been released except the h’akodas. Owing to one ship having to remain at Masqat, it has not been possible to detail a Ifen-of-War to determine this. * , Minto ,, has been directed to do this as soon as possible and it is hoped will be able to take the necessary observations at the end of the week. Considerable heating, accompanied by small outbreaks of fire* has occurred in the coal exposed or partly exposed to the weather.

As regards the 33 cases, the Secre- * Senai No. 397 . tary of State’s presumption is entirely correct, hut I know nothing of any threat by His Highness the Sultan to con fiscate existing stock of arms and ammunition on Prench premises and it is unlikely that such threats were ever made considering his refusal even to post cordon round French premises reported t Serial No. 292. in my telegram,f No. 157, dated the 7th September 1912, to the Pob'tical Eesident in the Persian Gulf. X am taking action, but if no telegram from the Secretary of State again raises the question of placing cordon, I hope to be assisted, owing to some correspondence of yesterday and to-day between Saltan and my colleague, in persuading Sultan‘to accept my advice. French subjects received a verbal warning intended for Arabs through the mistake of a petty warehouse clerk, to deposit existing stock in the warehouse. A letter was immediately written by French Consul, demanding severe punishment of the offender, and I was consulted in the matter by His Highness. Consul had a right to expect that official courtesy which, it was evident to me, the clerk’s conduct had tians- gressed, and His Highness on my recommendation explained in writing that his instructions had been misunderstood by the clerk and requested the Xrench Consul to overlook the clerk's mistake which was not intentional, but acci dental. His Highness the Sultan received in reply what I consider a patroms- ino- letter in which French Consul wilfully misunderstands the Sultan s request and pardons not the clerk but the Sultan, and says he has changed the telegram he was sending to Paris. Copy of this correspondence is being sent by post.217 tfhet' 406 Telegram P., No. 580 S., dated the 26th September 1912.

His Highness has not done so, and the subject has by tacit consent since been dropped. I imagine Sultan thinks that French Government and papers will twit him with being a puppet in our pay if he is known to be in receipt of the subsidy now and he therefore prefers, until present dispute has been settled, to wait. 413 t hi Telegram P., No. 1071, dated (and received) the 28th September 1912.

From— Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Maskat, To—The Political Resident and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to inform yon that, from an interview this morning with His Highness, to whom he had been sent by me to congratulate His Highness on Ins safe return from Sur and to ask if His Highness wished any message to he sent to you regarding the state of the country and the general attitude of the inhabitants towards the new regulations relating to the arms traffic, my dragoman brought baek the copy of a proclamation, for my inform ation, which His Highness the Sultan has thought fit to issue to allay any excitement that may have been caused by the malicious rumours and foolish talk which has been recently flying about the bazars. I have the honour to forward, for your information, a translation of this proclamation. I have not thought it necessary to send on a copy of the Arabic. I was not consulted by His Highness about the terms of this proclamation or as to whether it should be issued, but it is, in my opinion, entirely free from objection, so long as precuations are taken that the issue of arms to Oman subjects should be sufficiently restricted to enable tbe arms issued to be easily recognised and to ensure that they shall not be sold retail to collecting traders who intend to resell in countries to which the entry of arms is prohibited. 3. I am of the opinion that to note any such restrictions in this proclam ation, merely intended to allay tbe fears of bis subjects, would have been out of place, but I have the honour to request the favour of instructions as to whether it is necessary for me to address, either verbally or in writing, any warning to His Highness to the effect that we shall expect that the restrictions noted in paragraph 2 will be observed. 4. A copy of this letter, with its enclosure, is being forwarded to the Hon’ble the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department.220 Translation of a proclamation issued by His Highness the Sultan of Maskat to his subjects, dated the 9th Shawal 1330 Hijra (21st September 1912). In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. From Faisal-bin-Turki. Peace be upon you and the mercy of God and His blessings. And after, I inform you about the arms. We have prohibited the sale of them to the people outside (our territories), I mean the Afghans and the Persians and the Haluch and the people of the north, because we saw in the dealings of the aforesaid injury against us and profit to the merchants only. And, as for our subjects, the people of Oman, there is no prohibition against them. And reports have reached us that some one has been informing you that you are prohibited from the purchase of arms. Then those who thus reported lied to you in that, for the prohibition is against those aforesaid ones only. We will not allow our merchants to sell to them any arms at all; and the mode of selling to our subjects is that the buyer buys from the merchant according as they agree together and a paper goes from the merchant to the agent ot the Arms Warehouse, on the customs wharf for the release of the arms and the ammunition. This was what it was necessary to explain to you that you might know the truth and Peace.

I •Semi No. 413 no ^ cons ider it advisable now when so many problems press Sultan, to trouble His Highness to state his views on the method of regulating sales to prevent fraud. Contingency of supply to his subjects has not yet arisen, and it will be time enough when arms and ammunition begin to issue from the ware-house, to discuss the subject. 421 Telegram P., No. 193, dated (and received) the 29th September 1912. From—The Political Agent, Maskat, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla (repeated to the Resident, Persian Gulf). Reply to the French protest was in accordance with the instructions of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf sent by him (? me) to His Highness to-day. The reply of the French Consul has reached me; he has shifted his ground of defence and detention is, he claims, opposed to the 4th clause of rule 2. I will send as soon as possible a copy of the correspondence. As it involves a point raised in paragraph 7 of my letter* No. 124, dated/V • serial No 197 . 6th ultimo (to which no reply has been t Serin No. * 72 . received), the French defence is interesting. Letterf No. 3066 P., dated 15th August, to the Foreign Office, London, from /d, India shows that they consider that the French arms and ammunition in the arms warehouse are on the 1st October liable to confiscation. Should I advise Sultan on that date to confiscate and should the French Consul be warned officially by His Highness of the action he is taking and be referred to the last paragraph of rule 2 and rule 3 “in the proper form” saying that His Highness considers it useless to refer the matter for adjudicating to the French Consul, as the Consul is supporting openly his nationals in their disobedience to rule 1, a fact beyond dispute ?It will be well, it is my personal view, to defer confiscation until the * Sultan can act in accordance with rule 9 and avoid all hasty action. We must wait three months from the date of the importation of arms for this and confiscation will be by instalments. By proceeding under rule 9 the advantage to be gained will be that under the rules no reference to the French Consul appears to be necessary though it would be courteous, as all the goods thus liable to confiscation are under manifest form B consigned to French subjects, to inform him. This practice and the contumacy of the French are exposing to confiscation goods sold by British subjects and bought by Arabs. 422 Telegram P., No. 593 S., dated the 30th September 1912.
