International Islamic Economic Conference and Exhibition which are proposed to be held in November were initiated by committee of Muslim business men, with the encouragement of the Pakistan Government. Object is 'closer commercial relationship between all the Muslim States of the world as the surest safeguard against economic exploitation oi industrially backward Asia generally and the Middle mast in particular'. From an economic point of view, the conference should not be taken too seriously but I know of no reason for non-compliance with Pakistan Government’s request, though as Conference is supposed to be unofficial I should not have expected Pakistan Government to issue invitation. I feel that it would be well to do no more than post-office work in passing on invitations.INWAiiD TELEGHAM TO COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS QPrlCE ALLOTTED TO POLITICiiL (II) DEPARTMENT CYPHER (TYPEX) FROM: ACTING U.K. HIGH COMMISSIONER IN PAKISTAN TO: COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS OFFICE RPTD.TO: BAHRAIN TEHRAN D.

Reference our letter dated June 4th 1949 in connection with the invitation of the International Islamic Economic Conference to Government of Bahrain. 2. Iranian representative has strongly protested to the spon sors of Conference against direct invitation to representatives of Bahrain and has threatened that they would not participate if Bahrain’s representatives attended. The sponsors fear that non-participation by Iran would seriously jeopardise the success of the Conference and have with much regret therefore requested us to treat their invitation to Bahrain as cancelled. We realise (gp.undec) situation but it is difficult to see what else the sponsors could do. The Government of Pakistan have no desire to get involved in the controversy between Iran and Great Britain over Bahrain. As we are anxious to give no offence to the Shaikh of Bahrain we trust that you will in withdrawing your let ter to him use your good offices and explain that our previous approach was expressly on behalf of the sponsors of the conference who are non-officials (sic) and we did not anticipate that it would give rise to any controversy. We regret any inconvenience that may have been caused. You may also assure the Shaikh that this does not in any way lessen the high esteem that the Govern ment and people of Pakistan entertain for the Shaikh and people of Bahrain.- c® \3- Secret.

Pinhey, 'Public Helations Officer, c/o The agency, BAHhAlH WITH THE COMPLIMENTS OF HIS MAJESTY’S POLITICAL RESIDENCY PERSIAN GULF. 37433—5COPY (PR 3620/38/913) CONFIDENTIAL. FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. f 7 28th November, 1949. Dear Information Officer, A Soviet commentary for listeners in Persia included an attack on the Economic Conference of Islamic countries shortly to be held in Karachi. The commentator remarked that the Pakistani Finance Minister ‘’assuming the physiognomy of a learned man,' had said that the question of applying Islamic principles to economic tendencies was rather complicated. But, he added, upon looking into the matter it became clear that the Minister himself was'not unwilling to create complications And to divert the attention of public opinion from the real aims of the conference.' In the course of. last summer, the commentator continued, Khalegh Al-Zaman, head of the Pakistan Moslem Union, suggested that a conference should be held to discuss plans for the setting up of 'Islamistan', and afterwards visited the countries of the Near and Middle mast to take local soundings. At first the nature of 'Islamis- tan' was outlined only vaguely as a collective organisation embracing the Near and Middle East. Later, however, Khalegh Al-Zaman became more precise, and 'admitted' in a speech in Cairo that 'the iormation of ’Islamistan’ would be tantamount to an Atlantic Treaty for Eastern countries from Pakistan to Turkey.'. The Pakistan newspaper 'DaWN' had supplemented this by explaining on its own account that the idea was to band together the Moslem countries 'in a strong coalition with a common defensive and economic system, like the Western coalition.' Thus, the commentator concluded, from the foregoing evidence, coupled with Kahlegh Al-Zaman’s subsequent visit to London to discuss the project it had become clear that the purpose of the Karachi conference would be to prepare the ground for tne creation 01 'a milit ary and political bloc of the Moslem countries', resembling the Atlantic group in its aggressive and anti-Soviet character. We thought you might be interested to see, and perhaps to mention in the right quarter, that this conference has attracted a rather forceful criticism. As usual, the fear of any regional solidarity in the Islamic world has provoked this attack. We have sent similar letters to Information Officers at the other Posts whose countries were represented at the conference, and copies to Moscow, Batavia and Singapore for information. Yours ever, information research department Information Officer, BAHREIN. -N s £ j 'k - HH J VirarA pA C.
