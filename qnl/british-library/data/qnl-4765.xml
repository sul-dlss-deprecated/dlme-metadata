I am , Sir, Your most obedient servant, ffCopy, J 3 C R E T. Ko. 84 , © The Residency i Aden, 4th May, 1932, Sir, I have the honour to refer to your 1 Secret despatch oi the 14th April, 1932. on the subject of the araft treaty with the isiam# and to enclose copy of a letter that I have addressed to him, 2. As regards Article V paragraphs (1) and (2) I am advised that the Imam’s Courts are not iikej.y to deviate from the Islamic rule that in the eyes of the Sharia law all persons, of whatsoever race or creed, are equal, I am therefore of opinion that while it would be theoretically desirable to secure national treatment, there would be little practical advantage in doing sO| and if the present counter draft proves generally acceptable to the Imam, it may be unnecessary and inexpedient to press the point* I therefore propose to use my discretion whether or not to raise this issue during the negotiations with the Imam, and I trust that you will approve of this course* 3c I agree that after the conclusion of the treaty it will be desirable to establish a British representative at Sana 5 and to accept a Yemeni representative at Aden, I am considering the question of the appointment of the former officer, and I shall address you separately on this subject* 4. *fejesty f s Secretary of State for the Colonies, London*4 noxe tnat His Majesty ? s Government consider it desirable that I should conduct the negotiations in person. I have therefore proposed to the Imam that I should visit him at Sana' if he is prepared to proceed with the negotiations on the lines indicated. I have inadffl ii, olear that His Majesty's Government regard the evacuation of Protectorate territory and the restoration of hostages as essential preliminaries to the signature of the treaty* 5. The revised draft drawn up by His Majesty Government follows so closely the draft proposed by the xmam that he cannot in rqy opinion raise any substantial objection to it if his desire for a treaty is genuine* His attitude towards the evacuation of territory and the restoration of hostages is more doubtful a When he made hj-b overture last year he was engaged in a boundary dispute in Asir which might have involved him in war wi i,h I bn Saud« He knew that his opponent was in very good relations with His Majesty 1 s Government * and he therefore probably thought it prudent to improve his own relations with the latter. Since then he has settled nis dispute with Ibn Saud, with whom he has signed a treaty of friendship, and he is therefore no longer impelled by this special motive for arriving at an accommodation with the British Government. His general desire for a treaty on terms acceptable to himself no doubt remains, but it is open to doubt whether it is strong enough to induce hiai to withdraw from territory which he persists in regarding as his own and which has beenbeen in his occupation for many years. If he were convinced that he would in any case be compelled to evacuate this territory before long he would probably take this opportunity of accepting the inevitable with a good grace and without loss of prestige. But it is obvious from his draft terms that he hopes to stabilise the existing 'status quo', and if he thinks that he can achieve this object by obstinacy he is now less likely to yield on this point than he would have been last year, when he was nervous about his northern frontier- 6 a fhe recent British medical mission to Taia and the Imam T s cordial reception of Colonel Lake on an informal visit to Sana* created a good impression and promoted personal friendliness on both sides, but it cannot be assumed that they have influenced the Imam ! s general policy- 7. In my opinion an official Mission to Sana* headed by the Resident at Aden ought not to be undertaken unless there is clearly a fair prospect of success, and future developments must depend on the nature of the Xmam f s reply to my letter, especially with regard to the territorial question. I have, &amp;e., (Signed) B. R. Reilly, Resident, etc-.To 3213 | - a -r r &gt; His Highness Imam Yahya. ,b3ja Jilhhaiamad Hamid Uddin SANA*. Your Highness, I have the honour to refer to my letter Ho, 5£5 of the 17th October, 1931, on the subject of the ^ conclusion of Treaty relations between Your Highness and ' Eis Majesty f s Government, and to state that I have now received His Majesty 5 s Governments reply to my communi cation of Your Highness f s proposed draft to them* His Majesty 1 s Government welcome Your Highness 7 s proposal, and instruct me to inform you that they consider that Your Highness f s draft provides a suitable foundation for treaty negotiations, subject to certain modifications which are embodied in a revised draft which I enclose for your I information, with a brief explanatory note- 2 * Your Highness will observe that His Majesty 1 s Government are willing to re-open negotiations on the basis of terms which are in form and substance similar to those embodied in Your Highness r s draft, but I am at the same time instructed to point out to Your Highness that certain territories and subjects of Chiefs with whom they are in Treaty relations are still held by Your Highness, I refer especially to the territories of the Amir of DKALA 1 in the vicinity of SAHAH, to the territories of the AUDHALI Sultan at ADH HHAHSR, and to J J the subjects of the latter Chief who are hostages under 1 Your Highness f s hand, about whom I have already addressed i Your Highness. 3- I am instructed by His Majesty’s Government to j explain that they regard it as an essential preliminary condition to the signature of the proposed treaty that thesethese territories and hostages should be peaoefully restored by Your Highness to the Amir of Dhala* and the Audhali Sultan f without damage or detriment to person or property^ 4* I trust that Your Highness will agree that the elimination of the difficulty caused by your occupation of these territories and by your retention of these hostages is a desirable and necessary preliminary to the conclusion of a treaty which will put an end to all past causes of misunderstanding and estrangement and will ensure peaceful relations and cordial co-operation in the future. If Your Highness accepts this view there should be no difficulty in reaching a settlement by mutual agreement on the basis of His Majesty‘s Governments response to Your Highness’s proposals. His Majesty’s Government consider that this would be achieved most effectively and speedily by direct and personal negotiations rather than by further correspondence. 5. For this purpose I am authorised by His Majesty’s Government to suggest that if Your Highness is prepared to proceed with the negotiations on the lines indicated, X should visit you personally at Sana- as soon as can conveniently he arranged* 6. I hope that your reply will enable me to ta&amp;e this favourable opportunity of endeavouring On conjunction with Your Highness to establish a good under standing and lasting friendship between Great Britain and the Yemen, and at the same time to have the pleasure, for which I have long hoped, of seeing Your Highness personally and of visiting your State.7. I take this opportunity to convey to Your Highness the expression of tny high esteem and regard i %EXPLANATORY note Preamble. The wording haa been slightly moaifiaa to conform with the customary phraseology. Article I, Reference to n the Governments n has been omitted, as it is more appropriate and seemly that the Treaty should be concluded between the heads of the States, The phrase n in all affairs of whatsoever Jcind^ has been substituted for Your Highness’s phrase, as being completely logical and comprehensive! Article II, The references to n the Governments ’ 7 has been omitted for the reasons stated above, and the Article has been simplified. Article 111, The phrase n eouthern frontier of the territories of His Majesty the King of the Yemen” has been substituted for Your Highness’s phrase 'southern frontier of the Yemen', as being more precise and clear. Reference to 'the Islands' has been omitted as His Majesty’s Government are not free to enter into any bi-lateral engagements with Your Highness in regard to them. The last sentence of the first part of this Article is so framed as to make it clear that the Treaty is being concluded on conditions of complete reciprocity* The clause relating to the maintenance of the situation existing at the date of the signature of the Treaty has been reworded with a view to clearer definition. Article IV.Article IV It is not the practice of His Majesty* s Government to enter into formal agreements for the establishment of consular arrangements but the exchange of consular or political representatives can be arranged separately. Reference to political and consular relations has therefore been omitted in the text of the treaty, though Hie Majesty's Government hope that they will be established as an immediate and natural consequence of its conclusion. Article V has been remodelled to embody the normal practice that obtains in such matters. It is for consideration whether in view of the new form of Article V, Article IV may still be deemed to be necessary. In paragraph 3, the terms 'territories”, 'Subjects', and 'Vessels' have been defined for the sa&amp;e of clarity. Article VII. The question of the validity of the language of the Treaty is one which is amenable to discussion with Your Highness in the course of personal » negotiations.i CAivADA oOJUIOHWBAXffH OJ* AUSTRALIA I^EW m&amp;LMV UlsIOl'i OF SOUTH AFRICA IRIUi mm STATE BSWJfOUiiDLAtlD ---- - H Say, 1932. \H O ... ; ''■ircula? despatch A.

A draft treaty has been received from the Imam and the Resident at Aden has now been instructed to communicate to the Imam a counter draft in which provision is made inter alia for the settlement of frontier questions and for the regulation of trade and commerce on a basis of reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment. I have, etc,, r ri tj ■ % *7 /' O / / ' -howning ^treet,Sir, I have the honour to refer to your Secret despatch No*2^0 of the 21st October last* and. c\j telegr^ Ho.6 of the 16th of March on the subject of the dr ft Treaty with the Imam, and to enclose a counter draft of the proposed Treaty which has been prepared after consultation with the various Government Departments concerned. 2* I have the following observations to make:- that the ref ere, nee to the 'Governments 1 * has been omitted, as it is inappropriate to make both them and the Heads of the states undertake the same obligation. The words 'of since it is impossible to have 'internal international affairs'. If, however, the Lfiam sets store by them, the words 'internal or external' could be added as shown in the draft. i. article II has been redrafted in a simplified form and the reference to 'Governments^ again omitted for the same reason as in article I. form With regard to Art!ale I, you will observe % words of the lmi f s draft article which are contradictor” 4 £ BGSIDhNT kf k D E i.4. With regard to Article III, His Majesty 1 g Govemaeat consider it jarefera 'I@ to substitute the phrase 'Southern frontier of the territories of His Majesty the King of the Yemen* 1 in lieu of the expression 'southern frontier of the Yemen', thus making it clear that the reference is to the territory of the Kin; of the Yemen, and not to the vague term 'Yemen* which has been used to describe the entire South-test portion of the Arabia* 5* As regards the 'Islands of the Yemen', His Majesty’s Government agree with the views expressed by you in paragraph Z (3) of your despatch under reference* It see jus probable, as you suggest, that this term is intended to cover Kamaran, Ferim, the Hanish and Jebel Hukur group, and possibly the Farsan Islands, With the exception of the latter all these Islands, which had formerly been Turkish, {with the exception of p erim), fall ;jj to be dealt with under Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne, so that His Majesty’s Government is not free to enter into any bi-la tend engagements with the Imam in relation to them, and the Parsan islands have now been incorporated in the territories of King Ihn Baud. As regards the “original rights 5 '* of the Imam, whilst His Majesty’s Government could not accept any phrase which might imply an admission that the Imam possessed any 'rights' in the ’rotectorate, they considered it desirable to make it clear t at the proposed treaty was without prejudice to the rights and claims of His Majesty’s Government, more especially as regards treaty relations with frontier tribes, Ac.ftie wording now inserteu covers, therefore, the ’’rights claimed” by either High Contracting party and has the further advantage of suggesting that the treaty is being concluded in conditions of complete reciprocity. • 'ou will not® that the paragraph relati^ to the 'status quo' has been reworded with a view to clearer definition, and the alternatives 'signature' or 'coming into force' have been substituted for the imprecise word 'conclusion'. It is suggested that, as the Imam must evacuate the parts of the Protectorate which he occupies before the Treaty is ai^n&amp;d, the word 'signature H would perhaps be preferable. 7. In Article I? the reference to the establish ment of political and consular relations has been omitted. His Majesty’s Government do not enter into agreements for the establishment of consular arrangements but there is no objection to the Imam being informed, if he presses the point, that this would not prevent arrangements for the exchange of consular representatives being made later, as and when necessary. As regards political relations. His Majesty’s Government consider that every effort should be made to secure the formal agreement of the Imam to the reception at iianaa of a permanent representative of the Resident at Aden, and it could be agreed, if the Imam so desired, to his having, in exchange, a permanent representative at Aden, if the Imam agrees, hie agreement should, without further reference to me, be embodied not in the Treaty itself, but in an exchange of notes. If he does not agree to any permanent British representative at Sanaa, or will only agree to a formal exchange of diplomatic representativesrepresentatives to reside in Sanaa and London* this question should be referred to m. 8 . I am of the opinion that, as jou and jour staff are best fitted, both from the standpoint of local knowledge and knowledge of Arabic, to deal with the Imam, will be a very isolated and trying one, could be most from your staff. This officer might be relieved as often as ms necessary by another member of your staff, and 1 should be glad to have your viwws as to whether it is necessary to increase your staff by one officer for this purpose, in which case it will be necessary for m to consult the Secretary of State for India* who may wish to refer the question to the Government of India. 1 should also on this point be glad to receive your views as to the emoluments to be attached to this post* suggested that article 1?, as now drafted, is unnecessary in view of Article ?, but if the 1 mam attaches importance to it, no objection need be raised to its inclusion. 9. Article ¥ has been re?'rafted to emhodjr the norm! practice which at present obtains in such matters. that Article 16 in the original draft Treaty prepared in 1934 contained a provision for securing n&amp;linn&amp;d. treatment in matters concerning the administration of justice. 1 should be glad to receive your views as to whether you consider that, in practice, most-favoured nation treatment is the best that can be secured, and whether, having regard to the preauaauly primitive nature the staffing of the post at uanaa, which, it is admitted easily arranged by detaching an officer of suitable rank You will see that, in the counter draft, it is As regards paragraph (1) I have to point out ofof the administration of justice by the Imam in respect of his own subjects, there would in fact be any practical advantage in securing national treatment* 10. With regard to paragraph (2) it is the practice to include in present-day treaties national and most favoured-nation treatment for vessels, their cargoes and their passengers, probably in this instance, national treatment is of little practical importance, but here again, I should be glad to receive your views as to whether you consider most-favoured-nation treatment is the best that can be secured. On both these points 1 am prepared to be guided by your advice, and if you consider article V of the counter draft as it stands secures the best treatment in practice, the re-opening of negotiations need not be delayed thereby. 11. In para raph (3) you will observe that the words rf territories' 1 , 'subjects* 1 and 'vessels' have been defined. If necessary it can be explained to the imam that these definitions are necessitated by the constitutional position of the different parts of the British ijnpire. 12. As regards Article ¥11, His Majesty’s Government hold the view that the negotiator should hold out for English and Arabic texts of equal validity if it cannot be secured that the English text should prevail, and that he should not on any account give way on this while any other points connected with the proposed Treaty remain unsettled, as it would create an embarrassing precedent. If, however, the Imam remains adamant on the point, where all else is agreed, and the language question alone, therefore, prevents the conclusion of a satisfactory treaty, His Majesty’s Government consider that the negotiatorHis Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond th&lt;§ beas* Emperor of India on the one part., and His Majesty the King of the Yemen, the Imam, onAS£IC 1 ILIX.

THE CHAIRMAN* in opening the meeting* stated that uhere were two questions for consideration - (a) The point raised by the Resident at Aden in his telegram No. S9 as to the preliminary conditions prior to a treaty. It appeared that the Resident’s view was that the Imam should at once be told tnat tnese pre-conditions were a —hf- 3 -, HRA 3 that their fulfilment should be required prior to the signature of a treaty ana noo prior to opening negotiations themselves. (b) j_he second point was referred to in telegram No. 50 from the Resident at Aden and dealt with V;hat dCGion should be taken to s ecure evacuation by the Imam of occupied territories should the treaty:fail to go through* in which event a decision r st be made either to drop the question of evacuation or insist on it* if necessary* by force. He proposed that the Sub-Committee should begin with the first question. MRP COEEiX sGated that the Colonial Office understood Colonel Reilly's proposal to be that the Imam should be toldat once v/hat the conditions were and informed that they were a .sine—£ha__^on 5 hut that their fulfilment should he required prior to the signature of a treaty and not prior to its discuss!on» The Colonial Office accepted this proposal* COLONEL MURRAY stated that the War Office generally agreed with this view- CAPTAIN CUNNINGHAM was doubtful as to the exact meaning of the words 'at once’M He considered that there was some doubt whether this v/as intended to mean at the present time or at any moment during negotiations should the evacuation of the Audhali territory be treated by the Imam as a matter open to discussion. As it at present stood he considered the Resident's telegram was liable to be misconstrued* MR. COGELL considered that the intention of the Resident at Aden was to inform the Imam before negotiations began what preconditions were required* but that the fulfil ment of these preconditions need not necessarily be insisted upon until the time of the conclusion of the treaty* He considered that the actual time when these conditions should be intimated to th . Imam should be left ’ : the Resident's discretion. GROUP CAPTAIN PEIRCE said that the Air Ministry were primarily concerned wi J 1 the military aspec ' 1 and regarded it as most important that the Audhali occupied territories and the restitution of he stages should be conceded by the Imam* They were* therefore* opposed to the Resident's suggestion, which in their opinion placed the Imam in a stronger tactical position for negotiations. He tnought that this question could not be considered separately from the second suggestion of the Resident to introduce a threat at some period of the negotiations* 2*LIv. 00 .ELL stated that at present the Imam is in the position of a suitor asking for a treaty. he should make it clear to him that he cannot obtain a treaty until he has evacuated the districts in dispute. Should this fail the threat of air action could always he considered at a later date* MR. BAXTER stated that the Foreign Office had no strong views in the matter? and would he prepared to concur in Colonel Reilly’s proposal? if this accorded with the general opinion of the meeting. MR. CLAUS ON sa.id that the India Office also generally agreed. He thought that the two questions could he treated separately. MR. GRIEVE considered that Colonel Reilly had put forward his suggestion with a view to establishing personal contact with the Imam. He could then inform him on what conditions we were prepared to negotiate. THE CHAIRMAN then invited discussion on the second question (Telegram No. 3C ). GROUP CAPTAIN PEIRCE said that the Resident’s sugges tion that a threat should he introduced at some time during negotiations actually implied thd these negotiations would he carried on under the threat that unless the Imam concluded a treaty we would take coercive action against him. This would he a somewhat imp ssihle way of conducting negotiations. MR. COTELL stated that the sole new feature since the decision was reached last Autumn not to insist on the evacuation of Audhali country the time that action was taken to secure the evacuation of A1 Ain was the fact that friendly overtures had now been received from the Imam. -3--4- Although y. r e had never adnittprl tao r » admitted the Imam’s right to occupy the district &lt;3 so thr w^ 'h^a 7 - 1 ^+ j-j. hwd n0t att ^Pted to ante him out hy force.

THE OHAIRMAh said he though! the general feeling of the meeting was that the question of a threat should he considered as a separate issue in the event of negotiations breaking down 9 the time when the Imam shows himself friendly being hardly the opportune moment to talk about coercive action. GROUP CAPTAIN PEIRSE again reverted to the question of evacuation of AudhsQi territories and restoration of hostages as a precondition. He foresaw a possibility that should negotiations he proceeding in a satisfactory manner, and should the Imam demur finally with the conditions just referred tok there would, be a possibility that on political and commercial grounds pressure night be brought in favour of concluding the treaty at the expense of The preconditions. THE CHAIRMAN suggested that the Ais Ministry fears on this point were unfounded. GROUP CAPTAIN PEIRSE then said that he would like to record that the Air Ministry held definitely strong views that the preconditions laid dev/n should be fulfilled prior to the opening of negotiations. He pointed out that our prestige in the Protectorate would not be enhanced If treaty© negotiations were opened with t with the Imam whilst the i maa was still occupying Protectorate territory. Ho reminiel the meeting that the Previous eonsensus ef opinion ha d ,ecn primarily concerned in obtaining the evacuation of the Audhall territory and restitution of hostages, and that the importance of this was borne out by Colonel Reilly wh o stated that the present position „as incompatible with our treaty obligations. The Air Ministry view had always been that the Imam's proposals for a treaty offered the one opportunity of achieving these requirements without firing a shot. A discussion then took place as to the literal meaning of the following passage in Telegram No* 29:- M I consider that the Imam should at onco he told that they are a sine qua non , hut I propose that their fulfilment should he required prior to the signature of a treaty and not prior to its discussion’** The conclusion re- shed was that the intention must he that when informing the Imam that His Majesty*s Government were prepared to negotiate a treaty on the ha sis of the Imam’s draft, the Resident would make it clear that no treaty could he concluded until after the evacuation of the Audhali and Sanah districts and the return of hostages-* GROUP CAPTAIN PEIRSE said that this interpretation would in part meet the Air Ministry contention. CONCLUSION, THE SUB-COMMITTEE AGREED:- That the Colonial Office should, subject to agreement by the Air Ministry, instruct the Resident at Aden to th© following effect - His Majesty’s Government approve of your informing the Imc.m at onc-e that treaty canno'bo concluded until after eTscuetion of districts and return of hostageso You should not, however, indicate in any raanner that failure to evacuate will involve hostile action.

A meeting of the Official Sub-Committee of the C.I.D. has been called to consider two further telegrams from Colonel Heilly. (1) He is anxious that the actual evacuation of ^adhali territory and of Sanah and the return of hostages should not be made a condition of the commencement of negotiations but only to the actual signature of a treaty; the Imam would at once be to ld however that they are a sine qua non to the latter. This is the point we tentatively made in our letter of the 11th January (P.Z.118) which the Colonial Office decided to leave out of account. We may now press it with greater confidence. It might however be wise to secure a definite undertaking^ from the Imam to this negotiations being rendered nugatory by a subsequent would put us in the position of having shown our hands without gaining anything. must in any case withdraw from Protectorate territory or His Majesty 1 s Government will be compelled to take action. It is submitted that there are here two distinct questions:- (a) what His Majesty T s Government intend in their own minds eventually to do in order to clear up the deadlock which has persisted since 1928, (b) how far they tell the Imam their intentions before and during the negotiations. ns for (a) we must, I think be guided by the views of the other departments.

(b) But whether or not it is decided that force may eventually be necessary, it seems undesirable r to tell the Imam so unless he proves refactory. 77e A know from Aden Intelligence Reports that the Imam (or at any rate the Amir of Taiz whose influence with him is considerable) is at last definitely anxious for a Treaty, and that he recently gave an informal audience to Colonel Lake who no doubt helped to smooth the path to a reconciliation. It seems tha 1 there is an excellent chance that he will be willing ! to agree to the evacuation of the districts in question in a friendly spirit as a concession necessary in ord 4 r to secure a treaty with the British Government.

It is surely worth while attemptiig to secure the conditions to the treaty (which, in effect are bound to be regarded by the Imam aspart of the negotiations themselves) by ordinary agreement before using threats to secure them. It is therefore submitted that the correct line - assuming that it is agreed that His Majesty's Government are prepared to use force, if necessary, in order to secure the Imam's evacuation of Protectorate territory^ - is to make every effort to secure his promise of evacuation, olV which the negotiations depend, without using the threat of force; this should be kept in reserve and only used as a last resort which may prejudice the negotiations themselves, even if it does secure the evacuation of the territories.

There is evidently no need to consult the Government of India on this further proposal of the Colonial Office* It has already been agreed that before negotiations are opened with the Imam, he should be required to evacuate all the Audhali t er ri-or^ which the Zeidis are at present occupying. Since tnis was agreeo., a despatch has been received from Colonel Reilly, which is now submitted, making two further proposals. Upper Yafa Sultans claim to IWeiatein. It seems unnecessary to go into the details of this claim. It appears from pages 3 and 6 of the papers now submitted that the claim is well substantiated and documented, but that the (l&gt;KjC £) claim to Ra’wa and Dhabyan is much weaker and could not probably be sustained. All these places are marked roughly in the attached map - flagged. We may presumably concur without difficulty in tht . proposal, especially as it will not A delay the opening of negotiations, Inri Tri' Evacuation of Sanah . Sanah - see map - is a small district just on the Aden side of the border opposite Kataba. There is no doubt about its being Protectorate territory,in the Amiri district, the property of the Amir of Dhala. It was not evacuated by the Zeidis in 1928, and the Resident did not press the matter at the time, as he feared that, owing to its strategic position, if the Amir of Dhala’s tribes regained possession of it during the disturbed period, they might use it as a base for an attack on Kataba. Colonel Reilly is, however, definite that its restoration/i restoration to the Amir should be ensured in any permanent settlement with the Imam. Thepolonial Office propose to add this to the Audhali territory as territory which must be evacuated before the resumption of negotiations. Colonel deilly does not seem to suggest this - nor in facu did he seem to make the same suggestion as regards the Audhali territory quite as definitely as the Colonial Office seem to think, in his previous despatch. It may not be worth mentioning the fact, but I have added a paragraph to the draft in case it is thought worth while. Our main desire from the 'Moslem reaction' point of view is presumably to get the negotiations started, and it seems a nity that there should be too many precedent conditions Draft to the Colonial Office submitted. .VW’''-'' f/'A.

YilE ChAIRMAN stated that the first question for decision was whether the Imam's ccmmunicaticn enclosing the new draft treaty justified us in agreeing to re-open negotiations. MR. COWELL stated that the Colonial Office considered that though the situation hitherto existing was on the whole satisfactory ? wo would be open to considerable criticism in Parliament and elsewhere if we refuscd to entertain the Imam 5 s proposals. MR. R.SNDEL explained that in the view of the Foreign Office the Imam 1 s new proposals appeared to offer a reasonable prospect for the re-establishment of relations with the Imam on a satisfactory basis. While there was no urgent need to change the present situation, since the Imam was no longer in occupation of any important area in the Protectorate, the Foreign Office/ol considered tnr.t it would do preferable if H,M*Government could re-establish relations with the Imam 3 provided this could he done without mailing any unreasonable concession. Hitherto the Imam had put forward outrageous claims 3 and no negotiations had therefore been possible; tut 3 now that the Imam had presented us with a draft treaty whicn 3 in its main essentials 3 corresponded i so closely with the draft treat 3 ^ which we ourselves had sent him a year age. the situation v/as materially changed, and he considered that it would be unwise to reject the Imam’s new proposals out of hand. The Foreign Office moreover saw considerable dangers and disadvantages in allowing the present situation in the Yemen 3 which might be described as a vacuum, to continue unnecessarily. There would be many advantages in re-establishing relations, and particularly in securing the appointment of a resident British representative in the Yemen, to watch, and if necessary to counteract, the activities and intrigues of Soviet and other foreign agents. Moreover, the Yemen was the most fertile and potentially the richest part of Arabia, and offered a promising field for British commerce and enterprise* The Foreign Office, therefore, considered that the balance of argument lay in favour of mooting the Imam’s overtures half-way and agreeing to re-open negotiations on the basis now proposed. The matter had however not yet been submitted to the Secretary of state for Foreign Affairs, to whom any conclusion reached by the Sub'-Committee would of course have to be referred. MR. ANB3R30N stated that the India Office were only indirectly concerned and had not therefore sent in a memorandum. If His Majesty’s Government refused to otreat with the Inam this might have come re-action on Moslem opinion in India. The India Office were,' therefore, in favour of negotiation* LrROUP CnPTAIiT PJIIESS said that the Air Ministry would net oppose the conclusion of a treaty if this v.as considered to he politically desirable. The ^ir 'Ministry would, however, wish to ensure that no concession was being made to tho Imam which might prejudice our ability to give active support to our Protectorate tribes. COLOMhL MU PI AY stated that the war Office were in genoral agreement with the Air Ministry view. THE CHAIPMAN pointed out that in 1908 the question of a treaty with the Imam had been considered by the Cabinet and negotiations had then been sanctioned. Suspension of those negotiations had been caused by the intransigent attitude of the Imam, and in ro-opening negotiations at the instance of the Inam wc wore acting in logical sequence. MR. RONDEL agreed that, in accepting the Imam T s proposals to re-open negotiations, we should be acting in harmony with the policy which had been previously laid down-. Negotiations had only boon suspended because of the imam’s insistence on his preposterous claims. Now that he appeared to have adopted a more reasonable attitude the original decision to negotiate with him appeared once more to apply. THE SUB-COMHITTEE agreed that the conclusion of a treaty with the Imam would be generally in the interests of Kis Majesty's Government. THE CHAIRMAN stated that the next point for con sideration was what conditions should be laid down before negotiations for a treaty were opened with the Imam.«' H® citud the evacuation of the Audhali country and the return of hostages, as recommended by Colonel Reilly, hut there was also the question of the return of loot and reparation lor damage at A1 Ain, which matter had been held in abeyance since the receipt of the Imam’s letter proposing a treaty* He thought that this should also bo considered in this connection* GROUP CAPTAIIT PEIRSE agreed. MR. REN'DSL sug to give the Resident gested that it would be desirable at Aden a wide discretion as to tne precise nature of the demands which he should put forward as regards restitution of loot etc* , in connection with tne evacuation of a 1 Ain* It might well prove difficult for the Imam to recover loot which might now have been dispersed, and there might be considerable difficulties in the way of obtaining financial compensation. THE CHAIRMAN also suggested that having regard to past experience, provision should be made against looting by the Zeidis on their retirement from the Audhali country. THE SUB ~C 01.1.1 IT TEE accordingly agreed that in any demand which Colonel Reilly night be instructed to make to the Imam for the evacuation by the latter of the north- west Audhali territory it should be clearly specified that that evacuation must not be accompanied by any looting or destruction of property. MR. RENDEL recalled the fact that at a previous meeting of the Sub-Committee, the Resident at Aden had explained that it was doubtful whether the north-west section of the Audhali tribe would be ready to return to -A-9 —5' their allegiance«. Colonel leilly hod explained that the Chief cf this section of the tribe had apparently transferred, his allegiance to the Inara&gt; and that, even if we secured the latter* s evacuation of the area in question &gt; ve might have some difficulty in re-establishing cur own position there* On the other hand, it was apparently important to recover the north-west area of the Audhali country which was now in Zeidi occupation: (a) because it was the most fertile territory belonging to the tribe and. the south-eastern s ection of the tribe wore economically dependent on it; and (b) because cur continued failure to secure such evacuation exposed us to charges in the Protectorate of heving dishonoured our obligations* lie therefore thought that we should certainly press for the evacuation cf the north-west Audhali territory as a preliminary condition for the re-opening of negotiations* But even so it would he difficult to decide the precise limits of the area to be evacuated, since apparently the natural geographical frontier ran between the two sections cf the Audhaii tribe, and it would be difficult to define a good natural frontier further to the north-west* he therefore suggested that one Hesi dent should be given as wide a discretion as possible as to the precise nature of the demands to be made oi tno Imam in this respectv GROUP CAPTAIN PURSE considered that as a necessary condition precedent to a treaty, the I rum shouucl oe required to withdraw his forces from the Beidha and Beihan areas to the former fuiglp-'Turkish frontier. THE CHAIRMAN observed that although the Beidha area was on the Aden side of the Anglo'-Turkish frontier, we h^d no treaty with the Beidha tribe*ivIK. F'j^TDEL doubted whether* anything would be gained by insisting on the evacuation by the Imam of any territory beyond the Audhali territory as a condition for the re-opening of negotiations. The Imam did not recognise the nnglo-Turkish boundary, and it was by no means certain “that we should be able to count on the allegiance of any tribes between that boundary and the Audhali area. MR. CObSLL pointed out that according to the terms of the draft treaty, the question of the ultimate boundary line was definitely deferred for settlement later. CAPTAIN CUNNINGHAM stated that as the settlement of the southern frontier of the Yemen was for later considera tion, it was not possible at this stage to press for the reotoration of the original Anglo—Turkish boundary. GROUP CAPTAIN P3IRSE considered that it was desirable that the original boundary should be established as a* basis for future negotiations. MR. RSNDEL pointed out that the Anglo-Turkish boundary north-east of Juban was an arbitrary and artificial line running tov/ards a purely geographical point in the middle of the desert. He considered that for the present it would be a mistake to insist on an immediate withdrawal from any but the Audhali territory. The settlement of the final boundary was, in any case, to be left over for further hegotiations; and the draft treaty now under discussion would he without prejudice to the final frontier. MR. COY/ELL agreed and stated that this was borne out by para. 2(d) of Colonel Reilly*s despatch, in which the opinion was expressed that evacuation by the Imam of all nudhali districts that he holds and the restoration ofAudhali hostages was an essential condition of the conclusion oi a tneaty with him* hut that other claims * might perhaps he compromised or waived by His Majesty’s Government« Ke felt that this would in no way prejudice the ultimate settlement* GHOIjP CAPTAIN PlilRSE considered that evacuation of the Audhali territory only, involved the Fish that the Imam might conclude that His Majesty’s Government had modified their earlier claims to the former Anglo-Turkish frontier and that subsequent negotiations might be prejudiced thereby. He wished, therefore, that it should be made clear to the Imam that the line to which he might withdraw by evacuating the Audhali country should not be assumed to be the line that would be finally acceptable to His Majesty’s Government. IT V/A 8 AGPEED to recommend that Colonel Reilly be instructed - (i) That as a necessary preliminary for opening negotiations, the Imam should evacuate all the Audhali territories which he is now occupying and restore all Audhali hostages. (ii) That in communicating this condition to the Imam it should not be so phrased as to imply that the line to which he would thus withdraw would subsequently be acceptable to His Majesty’s Government as a frontier with the Yemen, if it were short of the frontier as delimited with Turkey. (iii) That it should be left to Colonel Reilly’s discretion to determine the precise line to which the Imam must withdraw in order to effect evacuation of the Audhali country. (iv) That Colonel Reilly should stipulate that in the evacuation of territory there should be no looting or damage to persons or property. (v) That the question of demanding alse the restoration of loot and reparation for damage recently incurred at Al Ain should be left to Colonel Reilly’s discretion. (vi) That Colonel Reilly should inform the Imam that subject to the fulfilment of the above preliminary conditions, His Majesty’s Government are prepared to re-open negotiations on the basis af the Imam’s draft and to send a representative to Sanaa for the purpose.THE SU3---C0MMITTEE then considered the draft of the treaty as proposed by the Tmcnio THE CHAIRMAN assuned that this draft treaty would be revised by the legal authorities of the Foreign Office and Colonial Office from the point of view of correct phrasing, MR* RENDEL suggested that the Sub-Committee should at this stage confine themselves to the consideration of malor points of substance in the treaty, and that minor questions of form, etc* , which had not yet, in any case, been submitted to the Foreign Office experts, should be left over for subsequent discussion, more especially as the draft would probably be drastically modified in the course of negotiations. There v/ere no remarks* ARTICLE lie The omission of the latter part of this Article, as submitted to the Imam by Sir Stewart Symes in ISC9, was agreed to, since the sense appeared to be sufficiently reproduced in Article III of the Imam’s present draft, ART ICLE I II* v MR* RENDER stated that the Foreign Office considered it preferable, though not essential, to substitute the phrase 'southern frontier of the territories of His Majesty the Ring of the Yemen” in lieu of the expression 'southern f rentier of the Yemen”, thus making clear that the reference is to the territories of the King of the Yemen, and not to the vague term ’’Yemen” , which has been used to describe the entire south-west portion of Arabia* This was agreed to* MRo RENDER, referring to the question of ’’the Islands of the Yemen”, explained that all the islands which had formerly been Turkish .(i»e* , all the islands in-9 question except Perim) tell to pe dealt with under Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne ? so that we were not iree to enter into any bilateral engagement with the Imam in relation to them. .After some discussion he agreed that it would be preferable from every point of view to omit any reference to these islands in the draft treaty* If, however, the Imam pressed the point strongly, it had been suggested by the Foreign Office Legal advisers that we might obtain sufficient protection if the relevant passage of the draft treaty were altered to run 'the territories of His Majesty the King of the Yemen and the islands appertaining thereto” * CAPTAIN GUNNINGHAM considered that any reference to the islands should be omitted. In the first place there could be no question of the sovereignty of Perim, besides which, several claimants are already in existence to the other islands* It was obviously undesirable to imply that an additional claim on the part of the Imam should be added thereto. THE CHAIRMAN considered that any reference to the islands should be omitted from the treaty. If the point were pressed by the Imam, the Foreign Office phrase might have to be used, but it would probably be best to discover exactly what the Imam meant to include as fr islands of the Yemen”, and the matter could be further considered then in the light of the Imamds definition of tho term* ■ la inpIDEL expressed the view that any vague phrase in the treaty regarding these islands might, cause trouble at some later date, and agreed that it would be-10- definitely preferable that all r efere-nce - ho -thesis lands should he omitted. IT ¥AS AGREED that it -was desirable to omit reference to the islands of the Yemen in the treaty. TED CKAlKvuilT said that the next point was what words should he substituted for the term ‘'original rights' in the latter part of Article III. HR. REND EL said that while it was clear that we could not accept any phrase in the treaty which might imply an admission that the Imam possessed any 'rights' in the Protectorate, it was equally clear that the Imam attached considerable importance to the use of the word 'rights'. The Foreign Office Legal ,\dvisers had therefore suggested that the words -'rights claimed' should he used* which might satisfy the Imam* hut would give us adequate protection. Further * it was desirable that we should make it clear that the proposed treaty was without prejudice to our own rights and claims, more especially as regards treaty relations with frontier tribes etc. 3 and incidentally as regards our position in Kumaran. The Foreign Office therefore suggested the following wording:- 'It being understood that nothing contained in this article 3 or in other articles of the present Treaty, is to he taken os meaning that either High Contracting Party renounces the rights claimed by him in those regions'. This wording would have the further advantage of suggesting that the treaty was being concluded in conditions of complete reciprocity ? which should help to save the Imam’s face. CAPTAIN CUNNINGHAM agreed that this safeguarded the British claims; and that it would, in terms, place thetwo High Contracting Parties on a 'basis of equality in regard to their respective claims and so should he acceptable to the Imam* The wording proposed by the Foreign Office was accepted* MR* RENPSL drew attention to the fact that the provisions of the proposed treaty regarding the maintenance of the status q uo as regards the frontier would want careful wording in order that there should be no mistake as to the line which was to be observed. As regards the point raised by the Air Ministry - i.e. 5 whether the conclusion of the treaty might not prevent us from taking air action against the Imam in the event of his mailing any further encroachment on the Protectorate - the Foreign Office were advised that the conclusion of a treaty providing for the maintenance of the s tatus qu o would not necessarily preclude Hie Majesty’s Government from taking air action against the Imam in such an event, since a definite encroachment by the Imam’s forces on the territory of the Protectorate would constitute a violation of the treaty 5 which would thereby lapse^ so that His Majesty’s Government would equally be released from its obligations. A violation of the Protectorate territory by the Imam after the conclusion of a treaty would in fact constitute an act of war and have to be dealt with as such. GROUP CAPTAIN PURSE stated that the Air Ministry welcomed this statement and would not raise further objection ^ ie statu s quo provisions of the treaty ? provided it were understood that His Majesty’s Government would not be precluded from.if necessary, meeting an invasion of the Protectorate by force. MR. COWELL said that Sir Stewart Symes had expressed the view that Zeidi incursions were usually due toirrosponaible local raiders. At present there was no official relationship with the Imam and therefore no machinery which might localise and check such incursions. Should diplomatic relations he established it should be possible to come some mutual arrangement; for the restriction and settlement of such incursions on the spoto It was agreed that re-drafted on t Office* this sentence should 'be he lines proposed by the Foreign AR T IC LE IV* MR, RENDER said that the Foreign Office felt that it would 'bo very desirable to take this opportunity to secure British diplomatic representation in the Yemen 3 Oxther at S uiaa or possibly at Hodeida* It ’would be preferable that this representation should be secured in the present treaty* and not left over* as suggested 'by the Imam* for subsequent negotiation. ARTIC LE V, It was agreed that this Article should be re drafted on the lines of corresponding Articles in other treaties in order to cover such points as the inclusion of British protected persons* the definition of the territories of the King A. which this article should a PPly arid the definitio'' of the term ^vessels 1 '. A RTICLE V Io No comments* AR TICLE VII, It was agreed that the Treaty should be drawn up in both English and Arabic* each version to have equalau~.«.o sug-^es ^Gd that a dcciuion was rsQiiix*ecl as to where any eventual negotiations should he oonducted* He recalled that Colonel Reilly had been anxious in the summer to send a representative to Banaa* hut that it had seen decided that this suggestion should not he pursued unless and until the Imam took the initiative in suggesting tne re-opening of negotiations. The Imam had now done so 5 and there seemed no reason why Colonel Reilly’s original proposal should not be reverted to, and why he should not he authorised to send a representative - e.g. 5 Mr, Champion - to Sanaa to conduct any negotiations which might result. If negotiations were to he carried on at Aden, progress would oe difficult as each point 'would have to re referred to the i.rao.n a hose replies would probably he slow ana unsatisf actory. THE CHAlRitAN whether formal refer stated that it would have to be decided ence to the Ministerial dub-Ccmmittee would he necessary. The question of entering into nego oiations with the Imam was covered by previous Cabinet sanction. But the Official Sub-Committee was laying down conditions precedent to negotiation of the proposed preliminary treaty, which might lead to negotiation of a treaty being indefinitely postponed, or even abandoned. In the circumstances, it was not clear, even if the action recommended by the Sub “-Commit tee was finally approved by Ministers in their individual capacity, that reference to the Ministerial Sub-Committee might not be thought desirable. He proposed, therefore, to put the matter before the Secretary of State for the Colonies, as Chairman of the Ministerial Sub committee, at an appropriate stage, in order to take the secretary of State’s instructions as to reference to the Ministerial Sub-Comml 11 ee.- 14 ' P: ONGI£S.m:T^.

It will be remembered that the Middle East official Sub-Committee of the C.I.D. recommended 1 recommended last July that ,T no immediate steps should he taken 11 with a view to promoting closer relations with the Yemen failing a spontaneous invitation from the Imam' and considered that the policy of declining to negotiate with the Imam on any basis that would involve recognition of his claims in respect of the Aden Protectorate had been fully justified.(P.Z. 4538 / 31 ). Colonel Reilly now forwards the Draft Treaty which the Imam sent him quite spontaneously on September 2nd,i.e. before the recent incident in connection with the Zeidi encroachments into the Protectorate. The Resident considers that the immediate cause of the Imam s sudden change of attitude was the crisis with Ibn ^aud and his fear that H.M.G.might support the latter. The Resident suggests - and the C.O.support him - that the new draft shows sufficient common ground with the draft put forward by H.M.G. in 1929 to make it worth v/hile to enter into negotiations is not unsatisfactory to us and the Imam has more to gain by a Treaty than we have, yet we should welcome an opportunity to regularise the position. Para.7 of the Residents letter sets out the main pros and cons to the Treaty: in addition it might be added that it will satisfy Parliamentary opinion and that, from India 1 s point of view, it will be satisfactory to reduce the possibilities of air action being required, although the operations of 1928 did not in fact produce any hostile repercussions on Moslem either at Aden or at Sana. Although the status quo “Uii 3000 8/31is a reasonable The crux of the matter therefore is whether there: s a reasonable chance of finding a solution of the The crux remaining remaining points of difference between ourselves ana the Imam. Inasmuch as the Imam is now prepared to recognise and respect the _statun _ a uo pending a settlement of the question of his southern frontier before the expiry of the Treaty (40 yeaiS, instead of 10 which we suggested - but so long as the 'status quo' is recognise before the expiry preserved, the point is not of great imp or tan Ct) , it is submitted that the Imam has virtually given way over what has been the great stumbling-block for so many years, and that his omission of any recognition of the Protectorate treaties is largely face-saving. -his being so, it seems probable that we can secure such comparatively minor modifidations in his draft as we should require. J Coming now to the - details of the uer_.uS, Colo-iel Reilly T s letter draws attention to all the essential points. It will be seen that he considers that three changes are required in the Imam 1 s Draft Article III. (a) The Imam claims !I the islands of the Yemen. ' So Zukur group, and the Parson Islands (the last named are presumably under the sovereignty of Ibn Saud since his absorption of ^sir) there does not seem to be any harm, as Colonel Reilly says, in letting the Imam maintain a hypothetical claim, provided that this does not conflict with our obligations to Italy under the Lausanne Treaty of 1924, which left the future of these islands T, to be settled by the parties concerned 51 and the Rome Conversations of 1927, by which we undertook of the two countries 11 and that IT neither Kamaran nor the Farsan Islands should fall into the hands of an unfriendly Arab ruler. r?

E 57D0/7RB/91. vfr V 4 tet * i/1'7' Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to inform you that he has had under consideration Paper No* MoEo(O) 41 of November 16th, enclosing a copy of Colonial Office letter No * 89280/31 of November 12th, regarding the proposed Treaty with the Imam of the Yemen. 2* In Sir John Simon’s view, the new draft treaty sent to the Resident at Aden by the Imam represents a distinct advance on the part of the Imam towards meeting the views of His Majesty’s Government on the principal points at issue, and may therefore be considered as affording a suitable basis for a renewal of negotiations. It may be argued that His Majesty 7 s Government suffer no serious practical inconvenience from the fact that they have nc formal treaty relations with the Imam* On the other hand, there appear to be considerable -l-economic disadvantages in the unnecessary continuance of a situation which, in practice, prevents British nationals from taking advantage of commercial opportunities in what may be regarded as potentially the richest part of Arabia - a con sider a oion whi ch must weigfe. with His Majesty’s Government at the present time, and to which attention has often been called in Parliament. Further, Sir John Simon doubts whether His Majesty’s Government would be justified in ignoring any favourable opportunity to terminate a situation in consequence of which, largely owing to the absence of British representa tion in the Yemen, a clear field is left in this area for activities on the part of agents of the Soviet or other powers. .3. As regards the text of the draft Treaty put forward by the Imam, it appears unnecessary to deal at the present stiage with minor questions of a drafting nature. I am, how ever, to offer the following comments on more important points. (aj Article II. There seems no objection to the omission of the latter part of this article as submitted to the Imam by Sir Stewart Symes in 1929, since the sense appear: to be sufficiently reproduced in the latter part of Article III of the Imam’s present draft. (b) Sir John Simon agreed with Lieutenant-Colencl Seilly that the expression 'Southern frontier of the Yemen’ in the first sentence of Article III, might be admitted. He would however Prefer that an attempt should be made to secure acceptance of the phrase 'Southern frontier of the terri tories of His Majesty’ the King of the Yemen”. (c) As regards the reference to ’’the question' of the tf Y -» islands of the Yemen', I am to observe that, apart from the .o„-3 question or the possible reference to Perim, His Majesty* s Government are logically committed to the recognition of the sovereignty of King Ibn Saud over the Farsan Islands, which they recognised previously as being part of the territories of the j. drisi as they have now tacitly admitted that those territories have 'become incorporated in the territories of King i'bn Saud* Further, under Article 16 of the Treaty of .u&amp;usanne, a. c is agreed ihiat the future of such islands as Kama i an, Jo Dux Zux_up and the Hanish G - roup is left for subse quent settlement by the Powers concerned* His Majesty 7 s Government could consequently not admit a claim by the Imam to sovereignty over any of these Islands, On the other hand, the drat t as it stands, does not embody any admission by His Majesty’s Government of the Imam’s implied claim, but on the contrary specifically defers its settlement; and, further, having regard to the vagueness of the phrase n the Islands of the Yemen’*, it could always be contended that the above- mentioned islands, including Perim, cannot be considered to be covered by it* In these circumstances, Sir John Simon is not clear that the inclusion of this phrase is necessarily objectionable, (d) Sir John Simon concurs in the Resident’s view that the substitution in the first sentence of Article III of the words 'original rights' for 'claims', and the omission of any reference to the non-recognition of the Imam’s claims by His Majesty’s Government is objectionableo The following re draft of the concluding part of this sentence would, however, in his view, safeguard adequately the interests of His Majesty’s Government, and might be more acceptable to the Imam than the wording of the corresponding passage of the British-4- draft of 1929:- n .. a it being -understood that nothing con- stained in this Article or in other Articles of the present 'Treaty is to be taken as meaning that either High Contracting 'Party renounces the rights claimed by him in those regions*” (e) Article III. Second sentence* Sir John Simon is in general agreement with the views expressed by Lieutenant- Colonel Pie illy in paragraph 2 (d) of his despatch of the 21 st October as to the inclusion in the text of the treaty of a specific reference to the Protectorate treaties and to the old Anglo-Turkish boundary line 5 and as to the evacuation by the Imam of the Upper Audhali territory* P/ith regard to the latter point, the evacuation of this territory, and the return of the hostages held by the Imam, might be made a condition of re-opening negotiations* In the Secretary of State's opinion, a re-draft of this sentence, which made it clear that the Imam agreed to observe the status quo as regards the frontier (after evacuation of the Upper Audhali territory) for the period of the Treaty, or until the successful issue of the proposed negotiations for the settlement of the frontier, could be acce] 3 ted by His Majesty's Government as satisfactory* He is advised that such a clause v/ould not preclude His Majesty's Government from t aking air action against the Imam’s territory in case of a violation by the Imam of the status quo on the frontier, since the Treaty must be regarded as a whole* Such action on the Imam's part, in violation of his agreement to observe the stat us quo on the frontier, would thus release His Majesty's Government from any corresponding obligations under Article II, or any other part of the Treaty* (f) Article III* Last sentence. Subject to some clari fication, this sentence appears adequately to provide for non- aggression and non-interference by the Imam and his subjects on Protectorate territory*5 ( g ) A rt i Cle IV, R i r* TnVcn _ nn oimon sees no objection to the substance of this draft article r nm lcle “ 1 aIil however to suggest that unless it be considered impracticable, an attempt should be made to secure the consent of the Imam in the Treaty to the reception of a resident representative of His Majesty's Government. (h) .Article V. This article would have to be re-drafted on the lines of corresponding articles in other treaties concluded by His Majesty’s Government, in order to cover such points as the inclusion of British protected persons, the definition of the territories of the King to which the article should apply* and the definition of the term i? vessels'. (i) Article VI. The second sentence of this article appears to be of definite advantage to His Majesty's Government (j) article VII 8 If the treaty is to include a guarantee on the part of the Imam to maintain the status quo on the frontier, the proposal that it should be concluded for a long term such as forty years is evidently in the interests of His Majesty's Government. (-&amp;) As regards the question of the language in which the ireaty should be drawn up, Sir John Simon sees no objection to an Arabic text, provided that there is also an English text of equal validity. 4* It it is eventually decided that the Imam's draft •provides a possible basis for negotiation*, it would, in Sir dohn Simon's opinion be well that the Hesident at Aden should be instructed to examine whether any additional points oi interest to His Majesty's Government should be dealt with in the Treaty. 1 am, etc,, (Sgd 0 ) G 0 Vo KHNDEL. intehaii Gardens, S.W.lo, 8til December, 1931 0(THIS DOCUMSHT IS THE PROPERTY 0?

'' e beg t0 State ihat we ^Ith great pleasure, received your eminent letters Nos.525 and 526 dated the 17th October, 1931, particularly the intimation about your return to Aden safely and in good health. The reliance we place on your honourable character and the friendship we maintain for you are facts which cannot he doubted. Te have been fully informed by a notable whom we like and on whom we place great reliance, of the humane and lent qualities, perfection and high learning that you possess. For this reason we feel confident that there shall te no incidents which will lead to argents between the two Governments, while Your Excellency is i n existence in Aden. *e are confident that there will not be repeated discussions over trifling matters branching out of the desired treaty which is about to be concluded shortly. If the case demands it, we beg to represent and submit to Your High Excellency again that the question of the rights of toth Governments, cannot be settled except by the conclusion of a y between them and for this reason we are sure that it is necessary cautiously to avoid actions which might lead to distur- t-ince, mischief, argument and misunderstanding.In view of all this, for friendship's sake we request you, whose true and sincere service to your Great Government is known, to do your utmost speedily to secure the conclusion of the treaty of friendship 'between the two Governments in consideration of the friendship you enter tain towards us and our Kingdom. lie heg to confirm our best respects to Your Excellency.The following is an extract from printed papers wherein the people gave an exaggerated account or th* interruption of relatione between Nejd and the Yemen* In witness of the truth we affirm that it is not cf the question that warfare should break out between the Yemen &amp; Nejd* r /hat happened is that one of the iauils of the Imam meddled in the affaire of certain Arabs living on the extreme western borders (of Asir) near fiacin* This interference was directed against the Amil of Jisan, and led to disturbances between the tribes in that part of th* country# As a result of this# precautionary measures hev* been taken to keep both parties under control and allay their agitation. Owing# however, to the great distance between Imam Yehya (ana Ibn 3&amp;ud) and as negotiations might occupy a long time# it was deemed necessary to take departmental action until the situation should clear. His Majesty the King wired to Imam Yehya expressing his regret at the action taken by his AmiIs and asking him in the name of God not to allow trouble or war to break out between the Arabs at their homes* The Imam replied repudiating all responsibility for any action to cause trouble# This reply was much appreciated by Hie Majesty the King who replied thanking him for his friendly sentiment and at the same time suggesting that delegates from both sides should meet at the places in dispute in order to solve the problem# The Imam accepted this suggestion# His Majesty the King issued immediate orders to Mie forces and tribes on the borders to remain where they are and to take no action whatever# and also ordered his Amils in their various districts to observe the peace and to prevent aggressive acts# He chose Abdulla bin Hu'amuar# the Amir of Bisha as the head of the mission# which consists of Fahd bin Zo’air - the Amir of '''unfida# Mohammad bin Duleim - the Sheikh of Kahtan tribes living in the neighbourhood of the Imam’s borders# Abdul ahab Abu Malha - the Senior Officer of the Finance Department at Abda# Ahmed Al-Abdali - the Senior Finance Officer at Jizan and Mohammad bin Yehya Ba-Sahai one of the leading merchants at Sabia# Imam Yehya h&amp;s replied that his delegates are about to leave# It is expected that the delegates of both parties will meet shortly# somewhere near the borders# and thus the trouble will end in a peaceful manner# The situation on the frontier has resumed its normal condition and will so continue provided that nothing will occur to disturb the peace#(p)l. “ Interview frith £r« Carl Batl^gons on the 2Cth October 1931* (The oircuinatancea of this gentlemen * s visit to the yscien ere described in paragraphs 1400 1 1493 f 1516, 1522 f 1561, end 1645 of the Political Intalllgenoe Suciiarv)# Dr# Rathgene arrived fren Kodeidah en the 28th October, and 2 heard of his presence in aden just in tine to have a sfc&lt; conversation vrith hiii on the subject of the Veuen generally, before his departure for Germany on the nail on that day# (a) Dr* Bathgens had had a nunber of conversations with Bagheb Bey and several v/ith the Ic^a on this particular subject* hilo his last conversation vrith the haan in this connection had been in about nid-.'iurpast, he vras definitely of the opinion that the Asir incidents of that nonth had not been the direct cause of the 2tan f 6 chants of attitude as illustrated by the nev; draft terns that he had submitted to the Resident on the 2nd of September* Dr* Rathgens gaid that the Imam was exceedingly anxious to enter into treaty relations v/ith H*II*G*, for the tvro main purposes of the occr.‘ercial and economic advantage of the Ya en, anu of the prestige that a treaty with H*i,;*G* would give the Inai:i in the eyes ,y f Arabia and the vrorld* In respect of the former reason the Irian realised that the Russians were active in the Ya:;en merely for vrhat they could nalce out of the country, and had no intention of concerning themselves with its economic developed 8J&amp; as a race the Russians v r ere dislilr.ad and distrusted* On the other hand the Italian Treaty was now a dead letter, the German treaty had broken Gc n on the point of capitulations the Turkish treaty was admittedly merely political, and the ^ 3fciam felt that his only present hope for the development sno economic provinces of the Yew.en lay dn a treaty v/ith H*ii*G* In Trans-nJordan were all in very close political relations with H#iI*G# But while the imam had these advantages his mind in his desire for a treaty v/ith H*h*G* he was det sit lined for reasons of his own prestige net to give specific recognitic to the ji^en Protectorats ms such* He had, however, assureu Dr* Rathgens on more than one occasion that he woulu never interfere with the 'Aden Protectorate' or v/ith the Chieis or tribesmen inhabiting it, and his one essential oDjoct was that his claim to ultimate suzerainty over the Pro tector ate as^an integral part of the Yemen id bo recognised, to ensure that no territories *nthe Protectorate' should ever be alienatea by H#ii*G* or ever hanoed over to any Power but the Government of the Yemen* fb) As to Basheb Bey^ participation in the present draft by the Imam, Dr# Rathgens said that while Bagheb Bey haa usea and was still using his influence vrith the Imam xor a pecMieillation vrtth that influence v/ae fast uanin^* In illustration of this Dr, Bathgene aescrihed hor, rocentl/, Bagheb Bey had married a local Arab lauy ax£ ?

IvI.E^O^ 41 ) Memorandum uy Air Ministry Representative (forwarded under cover of letter No. S.27C23/?art III of 27-11-31). The Air Staff are of the opinion that the recent draft treaty proposals put forward by the Imam of the Yemen represent a considerable advance towards a more favourable attitude to H.M.G. At the same time it is considered that the Imam* in adopting his more conciliatory attitude, may have a motive bearing on his relations with Ibn Baud in connection with the situation on the frontier of Asir. It may be noted that while the Imam was submitting his proposals he was at the same time receiving strong protests from K.M. Ibn Baud regarding Yemenite encroachments into Asir and conveying a warning that, if these incursions continued, steps would be taken to defend the frontier. In putting forward his proposals therefore the Imam may have been seeking a means of securing our passiveness while he was involved in difficulties on his northern border. The attitude of the Air Staff,regarding treaty negotiations with the Imam, has consistently been that the situation on the border is quite satisfactory in the absence °f any settlement. This view was expressed in an Air Ministry letter dated 24th August, 1929* to the Colonial Office when it was stated “that as far as the military aspect is concerned no difficulty is likely to arise owing t0 tMe absence of a treaty,, Indeed if negotiations were to disturb the existing equilibrium, there would, from the purely military aspect of the question, he certain advantages in the continuance of the present state of affairs 5 '. No developments have since taken place which cause 8 -uy modification of the Air Staff point of view and in this connection they entirely agree with the Resident’s opinion statedis already ensured by the Royal Air Force and the existence of a treaty might lessen our freedom to take immediate air action in case oi aggression or interference on the Imam , s part'h flie Air Staif consider that the correctness of this point of view is well borne out by the reaction of the Imam to the threat of immediate air attack following upon his recent interference with Protectorate tribesmen in the region of Wadi Beihan. In this instance the existence of a treaty would have necessitated negotiations and the futility of negotiating with a potentate possessing the mentality of the Imam can be appreciated in the light of past experience. Furthermore the Air Staff wish to draw attention to the effect which the negotiation of and possible agreement on a treaty with the Imam might have on questions affecting the Protectorate tribes and the problem of air control,, It is the degree of protection afforded to Protectorate tribes against Imamic aggression which decides their attitude towards British administration, If the active protection to which the Tribes have now become accustomed is replaced by the less direct method of negotiation with its inevitable delays the allegiance of the tribes will cease to be so ready and adverse reaction on internal security will be the likely result The Air Staff have put forward these views in order to show that from the purely military aspect there is more to be lost than to be gained by the conclusion of a treaty. If 5 however, political or commercial interests are considered to override the military aspect the Air Staff feel that should press for terms no less favourable than those contained in the proposals submitted to the Imam hy Sir Stewart Symes in November 1929, In connection with the specific proposals now put forward by the Imam it is considered that reversion to the original frontier, that is, evacuation of Audhali territory and the restoration of Protectorate chiefs held as hostages must be a pre-condition to the opening of negotiations. Moreover the Air Staff are of the opinion that a treaty should contain definite acknowledgment by the Imam of the boundary settlement of 1903, 1904 and 1905 and. of the special relations existing between the chiefs of the Protectorate tribes and His Majesty 5 s Government. The Air Staff agree with Lt.Col. Reilly that the insertion by the Imam in M -• T —_T- «- tt ill draft article III of the words original rights” in place of ’'claims' as in the H.M.G. draft of 1929 and the omission of the words 'or that His Majesty's Government recognise any part of his claims' is not acceptable in view of our obligations under the treaties with the Protectorate chiefs. In addition it is considered that the Imam should be required to omit his reference in article III to the 'islands of the Yemen* j-iie sovereignty of Perim, which we have occupied continuously since 1857, cannot be called in question,. Nor should we al]_ow even a hypothetical claim by the Imam to 'the islands of the Yemen' in view of the strategic value of these islands. Their status is already sufficiently indeterminate without adding this additional complication. - 2 ' *ur iJS 1.0------ - - . u ixuocu u,/ uno Kesiaenu between the Imam s draht propoaals and those submitted by Sir Stewaru Symes in 1929, the Air Staff' have noted an omission by the Irfiam in his article II and \ 7 ©uld prefer that the; folloving words, v?hich were included in H.M.G* s draft ~j- - - — — — u ^ «. v u,y ax a. means at its disposal to prevent its territories being used as a base for unlawful activities directed against oeace and tranquility in the territories of the other party r JUuxt la 3 Air Staff, 27th November, 1931.m T T'TT ■}.

Letter by the Colonial Offing. Downing Street, 12th November, 1931, Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister to refer to the semi-official communication from this Department of the 15th of October to Major Hind, enclosing J|l a copy of a telegram from the Resident at Aden (No. 21 of the . 15th of October), reporting the receipt by him of a Draft Treaty from the Imam, and to transmit to you a copy of a despatch (21st. Oct. 19 31.) received from Colonel He illy, enclosing a. copy of the Draft Treaty referred to. ^Secretary of State finds himself in general agreement with the viev/s expressed by Colonel Reilly, and desires that the question may be referred to the Standing Official Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence x °r Questions concerning the Middle East for their considera tion. Copies of the following documents are also enclosed ±or the information of the Sub-Committees- (1) Sir Stewart Symes T despatch No. 193 Secret of the Util cf November, 1929, to which Colonel Reilly refers in the first Paragraph of his present despaten.(S4&gt; '« '= ■ *• © (^ Letter Ko- ^08 from Colonel Bo B. Be illy, C.I.i;., C.L.B., ^ Resident at Aden to the Secretary oi State for tne Colonies of tne 15t 11 October, regaminL tne relations between His !;a jesty T s Government ana the Imam, and to enclose herewith translations of tne Imam’s communication dated the 2nd September, 1931, (Annexure I), and of his new draft Treaty terms that were attached thereto (mnnexure II) t for convenience of reference I also enclose a comparative statement (Annexure III) in which such of the Imam’s new- draft terms as are relevant are set side by side with those which were communicated to him by Sir Stewart Symes on the 11th November, 1929, as the basis on which His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to re-open negotiations, (vide Sir Stewart Symes’ despatch No. 193 oi that date). You will observe that the Imam claims that his draft ’completely agrees both in form and effect with the draft treaty proposed by the British Government’. 2. The main points cf difference between these two drafts are as follows :- Article III . (a) The Imam accepts in principle tne proposal of His majesty’s Government that the question of his southern frontier should be deferred, but he has maae certain alter ations in this article which raise points oi material s Secretary of State for the Colonies, N D o N.importance,. i.he fix st is the addition of the words fr oi the Yemen' to 'frontier'. The term 'Yemen' is open to two interpretations. In a geographical sense it is widely accepted as comprising the whole of south-west Arabia,, including the iiuen .Protectorate and Aden itself. In a restrictea, or poritical sense it can be regarded as applying only uo the actual territory of the Imam,, and i o is presumably in this sense that ilis Majesty Is Government have offered to recognise the Imam as 'Ming of the Yemen'. There is a possibility that the Imam may interpret the word in one way, and we in another, but from the context it appears that in this case he is using it in its restricted sense, because in its wider geographical interpretation the Yemen is bounded on the south by the sea; and it seems clear that the Imam, line His Majesty T s Government, is referring to a land frontier. If sc^ the point is not of great importance, and the addition, 'of the Yemen', might be accepted, (b) The ImanMs second alteration is more serious. He has added the question of 'the islands of the Yemen' to that of his southernfrontier. The phrase is indefinite - perhaps purposely so - but it is probably intended to cover Kamaran, Perim, the Kanish and Jebel Zukur group, and possibly the Fansan Islands. The sovereignty of Kamaran and the Hanish and Jebel Zukur islands is undecided and there may be no harm in letting the Imam reserve a hypothetical claim to them, to be decided at a later date. But His Majesty T s Government will presumably refuse to be a party to an agreement which implies that the sovereignty of Perim is open to doubt/ and in my opinion there should be noambiguity either on that of Aden itself. point or in regard to the st at us (c) The third change of importance made by the Imam in this article is his substitution of the words n original rights' for the word 'claims' in His Majesty’s Government's draft, and his omission of the words 'or that His nritannio Majesty’s Government recognise any ^arb of nis Cj_aiins'. Both these alterations appear to me to be unacceptable, and it would be difficult to reconcile acquiescence in them with our obligations under cur Protectorate treaties. I recommend that on this point the Imam should be told that His Majesty’s Government preier to adhere to their original wording-, and must insist on it. (d) In the last part of his draft Article III the Imam omits all reference to the frontier demarcation of 1903, 1904 and 1905 and to the special relations of His Majesty’s Government with the Chiefs and rulers enumerated in His Majesty’s Government^ draft, (Article IV) that is to say, he declines to endorse the Anglo- Turkish agreement or expressly to recognise the validity of the Protectorate treaties. On these two points he adheres to the attitude that he has adopted throughout all the negotiations that have taken place during the last ten years. On the other hand he offers to accept and to guarantee the existing status quo for the term of the treaty. This is a great advance on his part and amounts to an acceptance in principle of the terms offered by His Majesty’s Government, although not entirely in the manner that His Majesty’s Government desire. It may not be necessary to insist on specific recognition of the Anglc-Turkish boundary or of the tribal treaties, if we accept this definite assurance from the Imam that he recognises and v/ill respect the existing situation. His offer is a satisfactory one except in one respect. The status quo leaves half thes. cuh! ^ -e ♦ 0 Aurihaii territory in the Imam’s hands, I understand that it was never the intention of His Majesty’s Government to acquiese in the permanent continuance of this occupation* and the wording of Article IV in His Majesty’s Government’s draft clearly implies that all the tribal territories enumerated, including the whole of the Audio,ali territory, should remain under the rale of their own Chiefs 0 I consider that evacuation by the Imam of all Audhali districts that he holds, and the restoration of Audhali hostages P is an essential condition to the conclusion of a Treaty with him 0 Failure to secure this would constitute a breach of our treaty obli gations to the Audhali Sultan, and would perpetuate the present unsatisfactory situation in the tribe„ In my interim reply to the Imam I have suggested that an immediate withdrawal would help the negotiations that he has re-opened, With regard to Rub’atein, N awa, and Dhabyan, districts in Zeidi occupation which the Upper Yafa’ Chiefs claim as dependencies, but whose real status is in doubt, I recommend that His Majesty’s Government should be prepared to accept a compromise or to forego their* claims altogether,, i . 3. I see nothing objectionable in substance in the Imam’s draft Articles IV, V and VI, which I suggest might be accepted,.. 4„ In his Article VII the Imam has proposed a term * of 41) years for the Treaty, to which I suggest that His Majesty’s Government might agree 0 He has also stipulated that the treaty should be drawn up in Arabic,, He endeavoured to obtain this concession in 1926 from Sir Gilbert Clayton, who recorded his discussions on this point in his Reporl on hxs Missionttie lESn ’ (Mlddle 5sst Ho.10). If His Majesty's GoYerrment consider that the treaty must he i n both languagec^ a solution might perhaps he found in the suggestion made in para 46 of sir Gilbert Clapton’s ) Record of Proceedings, at page 56 of that Report, In addition to the important variations thct I have described^ there are certain other alterations m the phrasing of the Imam's draft that do not appear to me to make any material change in its sense or intention anu which I suggest might he accepted as far as possible- ^ 1 * You Yvill ooserve that these nev^ proposals ,y the Imam that are made in a spirit of such unusual conciliation, and that show such a notable, and sudden advance on any that he has made in the past, were addressed from Sana.’ direct to me in London on the 2nd September 1951 - nearly a month before his receipt of His Majesty’s Government’s ultimatum regarding A1 T Ain. The Imam’s communication was accompanied by a private letter to me, under separate cover, from Ragheb Bey, a Turk who occupied a prominent position in the administration of the Yemen until the Turkish evacuation of the country at the end of the ' ar* He has since for some yearns been the Imam’s Minister or Adviser for Foreign Affairs* I became acquainted with him in Aden in 1919 when he with other Turkish officers end officials made their surrender under the terms of the Armistice* I was able at the time to give him some assistance with regard to his repatriation, and since that time he has affected to consider himself as being under a personal obligation to me*- The tone of his letter, of which I attach a copy, Annexure IV bears out indesender.t information that his influence with the Imam-8- has for some years teen exerted in favour of friendly relations with His Majesty's Government, and suggests that tho present draft is largely due to his efforts. He apoears to have taken advantage of the sudden straining of political relations between the Imam and Ibn Saud during August to induce the former to make this change in his attitude towards His Majesty’s Government* it seems probable that the Imam 5 knowing of the treaty relations between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Baud, and hearing of the representations made by the latter in London in regard to alleged Yemeni incursions into Asir, feared lest Ibn Saud should receive British support against him, and therefore thought it politic to improve his own relations with the British Government* It is obvious that the Imam has more to gain from the conclusion of a treaty than His Majesty’s Government* The defence of the Protectorate is already ensured by the Royal Air Force, and the existence of a treaty might lessen our freedom to take immediate air action in case of aggression or interference on the Imam’s part* The only substantial advantages that v.e can look to gain from a treaty are commercial ones, and this possible gain has to be balanced against the undesirability of admitting to any degree the existence of claims by the Imam to the Protectorate, and of accepting a frontier which is not strictly defined* Assuming, hovr-ever, tnat His Majesty’s Government adhere to their policy of desiring that our relations with the Imam should be regular!oed by a formal treaty, and that they are piepared to s„nnd by their offer of 19S9 In order to gain this object, I consider that subject to the remarks tlmt I n^ve maao, his draft offers a favourable basis for the renewal of-in the name of God the Merciful and Compassionate ( o&amp;LJj OF IBS JMm) To Lieutenant-Colonel B.Bo Be illy, (Resident at Aden (in London).

I have tried to dispel the former delusion by the terms of my letter, and the latter one by an alteration in the v/or ding of a revised draft of Article 4.

THE SUB -COMMITTEE AGREED : - (a) That the situation that has now arisen was not covered by the existing authority to take coercive measures. (b) That a report should be prepared for presentation to the Ministers concerned, informing them of the new situation that has arisen and recommending that the Acting Resident at Aden should be authorised to send an immediate note to the Imam stating that unless the looted property is restored and compensation for the destroyed village is paid within a specified time, air action, similar to that previously threatened, will be taken against him. Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1 ., October 12 th, 1931.THE SUB'COMMITT.EK h.ad Bel'ore tiiein P&amp;ptr L'i„ E* (0 )27 containing * (a) copy of a telegram from the Acting Resident at Aden to the effect that the Zeidis had evacuated A1 Ain but looted livestock and other property in the area and destroyed the village ? and that in order to obtain restitution it mis. ht still be necessary to carry out action as previously arranged, (b) a draft telegram in reply, prepared by the Colonial Office, and (c) an alternative telegram drafted in the Air a Ministry, together with/semi-official letter explaining the reasons for the alternative draft 0 THE CHAIRMAN stated that a situation, which had not teen anticipated by the Sub-Commit tee, when is hey met in September, had arisen, the incident having now taken in effect the form of a raid by Zeidi forces across the Aden Protectorate frontier for purposes of loot. The first question ' to be settled was whether the Acting Resident was authorised to resort to air action in order to obtain restitution of the stolen property. The draft telegram, as given in M.E. (0) 27, prepared in the Colonial Office, was based on the view that existing authority did not cover air action for the purpose of obtaining resti tution of loot and reparation for damage’ to Al Ain. It Had been concurred in by all departments except the Air Ministry who considered that very urgent action was necessary if fi ny restitution was to be obtained. They had prepared an aluerna tive draft which was based on the assumption that the Acting Resident at Aden was authorised to take air action it necesoary. AIR VICE-MARSHAL BURNETT considered that any long drawn out negotiations to recover the loot now would only lead to endless haggling and discussion, as had already occurred on the Trans- Jordan-lie jd border. He thought that/ - 1 -the decision to use air action to effect the return of the loot should he left to the discretion of the Acting Resident, v/ho was in immediate touch with local conditions, and contended that the existing authority to use coercive measures covered this situation. If no immediate action was taken, as appeared to he the present intention, he considered that we would lose in prestige enormously, as it would appear that we were incapable of protecting the tribes within our 'borders,, MR. RENDER considered that there were two separate questions for decision (a) whether the existing authority for eventual air action could he regarded as covering the present case; and (h) whether eventual recourse to air action, or the threat to use air action, in onder to obtain the restoration of the loot and reparation for the destroyed village, was or was not the right policy in the circumstances,, As regards (a) he considered that existing ministerial authority definitely did not cover the present case, since it applied only to the ejection of invading forces from Protectorate territory. Our ultimatum had merely demanded evacuation and it had sa.ld nothing about the conditions in which that evacuation should be carried out. Evacuation had now been effected,. What was now proposed was a new - though no doubt perfectly justifiable ~ demand# If that demand was to be accompanied by a threat of air action it would amount to a fresh ultimatum and fresh ministerial authority was in his view essential.As regards the question of policy, it was essential from the Foreign Office point of view that nothing should he done which might render the re-estahlishment of peace between the Imam and Ibn Saud more difficult or encourage Ibn Saud to re-open hostilities. It must also be remembered that the Italians v/'ere exceedingly suspicious of our attitude towards the Imam and were inclined to regard the whole A± Ain incident as having been engineered by ourselves in order to enable us to attack the Imam while he was occupied elsewhere. On general principle, moreover, the Foreign Office were opposed to air action, except in the last resort, since it might always be difficult to localise active operations, which were apt to lead to wider and more serious consequences than might be anticipated in any particular case c If, however, it could be shown that a further threat of air action was likely to prove the only means of obtaining a satisfactory settlement, it was for consideration whether the Sub committee should not recommend the issue of a further ultimatum* AIR VICE -MARS HAL BURNETT suggested that the threat of air action might be of use in inducing the Imam to refrain from taking hostile measures against Ibn Sand. THE CHAIRMAN took the sense of the Sub-Committee on the question whether the previous authority granted for air action covered only the former situation in which evacuation was demanded and not the present contingency. With the exceptionof the Air Ministry representatives, the Sub-Committee were agreed that this 'sas the position and that further authority was tliereicre r &gt; 6 C[iii.r , 6 &amp; _lx a d. 6 Liaiicl fop pss tituoion and. reparation was to l^e accompanied -by a threat of air action* The question of the 'best action in the present circumstances was then discussed. AIR VICE-MARSHAL BURNETT said that if nothing was done to recover the captured property our position as regards the protected tribes in Aden was bound to deteriorate. Experience showed that the threat of air action was the sole effective means of bringing pressure to bear on the Imam, He -suggested that the Sub committee should confine themselves to selecting the best line of action* a nd then obtain the necessary Ministerial authority to carry it out. He recognised that while it might be difficult to get Ministerial authority* some immediate action was essential. He maintained that the draft telegram prepared by the Air Ministry did not vary very much from that prepared by the Colonial Office. The affair had now developed into an act of brigandage which elsewhere local police might be expected to deal with, THE CHAIRMAN suggested that the Acting Resident might be asked to furnish fuller Information as to the present position. AIR VICE-MARSHAL BURNETT considered that little furt-her information would be forthcoming* as the fact remained that the property of tribes under our protection had boen/looted. Such a reference would merelv the agony a few days and delay action tend to prolong thus rendering it less effective. He considered that the matter should he referred immediately tor Ministerial authority, as the object of this Committee was to prevent, rather than make, delays. He was inclined to think that the looting had been carried out by the local Seidi commander, and certainly not . itn the - maml s ac ion owl edged authority. ? a. a. A. L O HE EEL stated that. while the Foreign Office were 6 enernll;y ojjposed to coercive measures on princinle, he personally v/as impressed by the arguments nut forward by the x ii Finis try, -^9 the ret ore, it could be shovm that it was essential s for the sake of cur prestige in the Protectorate and 01 our relations v?ith the tribes, that we should secure the restoration of the loot and reparation for the destroyed village, and if there was really no other means of doing this than by issuing a new ultimatum containing a threat of air action, failing a satisfactory settlement within a specified time he would personally be prepared to agree to 'recommending the adoption of this course, of course, yet know the views of the higher Foreign Office on the subject, COLONEL MURKNY and O/PT/IN CUNNINGHAM the Sub-Committee although he did not authorities at the expressed their agreement, subject to Ministerial sanction being obtained. THE CHAIRMAN stated that it would be desirable to despatch some interim telegram to the Acting Resident at Aden pending a decision by Ministers. MR. H1HDEL suggested that the Resident should be instructed if possible, to defer the presentation of his demands for restitution until it was known whether he could be authorised to send in an ultimatum. To send a demand for restitution without e. threat might - 'well prove useless and might mane it ffiore difficult to send in an ultimafaum until a reply from the Imam had been received. He considered that any ultimatum should He sent to the Imam himself and not to the local commander''- n -itehali Gardens, 3.’?. 1 October 18th, 1931 . actually concerned in the looting (as had been suggested) since the Imam was ultimately responsible for th&lt; acts of his forces and any attempt to short-circuit him might only make matters worse and cause further confusion. THE CHAIRMAN prepared the draft of an interim reply to the Acting Resident 9 which is attached.

AUDHAII QUESTION . Before the meeting dismissed the Chairman asked the / representatives of the various Departments whether there would be any objection to the Colonial Office telegraphing to the Acting Resident to the effect that the Audhali question,-which was entirely separate to the Al Ain incident,-must await the return of Colonel Reilly and that the Acting Resident's proposal to secure evacuation of that territory could not be approved 0 The meeting agreed with the Chairman's view. 6APPENDIX T 89291/31.

Instructions to this effect were telegraphed to Men on 15th September (with the approval of Lord Reading and Mr. Thomas); The Imam was given a general warning in 1927 * thatthat occupation of any portion of theMen Protectorate would, render him liable to retaliatory measures. Inuia's inuirect interest in our dealings with the Imam lies in the possibility of reactions on Indian Juslim opinion.

Reilly, British Resident, Aden, (now on leave) concurring in the abeve proposal. (0), 19 - Telegram from the Acting Resident, Aden, dated 3th September, 1931, urging immediate action. MR. RENDER who, at Sir John Shuckburgh T s request, took the Chair in the absence of Mr. .Parkinson and Mr. Cowell of the Colonial Office, opened by asking Mr. Howard to give the Colonial Office point of view. MR. HOWARD said that the Colonial Office generally agreed with the Acting Resident’s proposal to request the Imam to withdraw 7 his troops that have recently occupied AL AIN in the region of WADI BE IRAN. Should he fail to do ho t agreed that an ^t imam urn to be implemented, if necessary, by a action should be despatched. He understood that the Air Ministry considered that sunh an operation w r as authorised by a Cabinet decision of 1926 and might thus be regarded as a normal peace operation. The Colonial Olfice had, noweve^, considered it best to refer the matter to this Committee before sanctioning any action. AIR VICE MARSHAL BURNETT stated that the jiir Ministry They recognised, considered immediate action necessary.hoover, the necessity for adequate warning being given. COLONEL RETLLY. iii. ■pp'h'itr + , ' 11 reply to a Question by Mr. Rendel as to whether there was any doubt whether AL AIN was within our boundary, stated that as the boundary of this area was undefined he himself had had some doubts on this question, from air reconnaissances he had satisfied himself that this was not only politically, but geographically within our boundaries. He therefore concurred in the proposals of the Acting Resident 0 AIR VICE MARSHAL BURNETT enquired whether the warning and ultimatum that it was proposed to send could not also be made applicable to the BEIHiA area and UPPER AULALI country which the Zeidis have been occupying since 1925, and which in spite of frequent warnings they have made no attempt to evacuate. MR. KEhEEjjj asked Colonel Reilly to describe the position - n tc the Beidha and Upper* Andali area. COLONEL REILLY stated that in 1925 the Zeidis evacuated the lower AURAL I, hut have ever since remained in the upper AJLAI.I country. Prom our point of view the situation was most unsatisfactory as it gave rise to endless tribal quarrels besides forming a salient well within the line drawn up by the original Anglo-Turkish Boundary Commissi ori c It had been considered essential that we should regain control of this area ? but negotia- tions to this end were at present held up„ MR* RENLEL said that, while it was clear that there was a strong case for attempting to recover the Upper Audali area, the two cases, i. e c that of the recent Zeidi incursion at A1 Ain, and that of the earlier Zeidi penetration of the Upper Audali area ( ^icl not seem to be quite on all fours. In the former case we were dealing with quite a recent invasion of our territory whichdemanded immediate action of a more or less police character^ In the latter case, it was a question of utilising a recent incident elsewhere to redress a situation which had 'been allowed to go on for several years. Moreover, while it seemed clear that the ejection of the Zeldl invaders at AL AIM would not he a matter of much difficulty, the recovery of the Upper AUhA.lI area might involve operations on a much larger scdle* He asked for Gouonel Reilly's views on this point In reply, COLONEL REILLY read the following extract from a lecher oy Mr 0 Champion, Political Secretary to the Aden Hinterland which, he stated, reflected his personal opinion:- n It is for consideration whether, if the Note to the Imam has no effect, the Ultimatum might he made the opportunity for simultaneous action for the withdrawal of the Zeidis from the AUDHALI DHAHER, Here may he our casus belli. But while our successful action at AL AIN, only, would serve further to inflame the AUDHALI Sultan, I am still doubtful whether the two parts of the AUHIALI tribe, above and below the QAUR, are sufficiently united under the influence and authority of the Sultan to be able to turn the Zeidis out of the DHAHER, and keep them out. Furthermore, tribal operations in tne DHAHER would be far more difficult in view of the long occupation by Zeidis, who may well have taken root there, and of the possible contention of the 'upper' AUDHALIS that just rule and peace under BEIDHA is better thanf I I ^ .■urue^ freedom under their oven. Sinltar, 1 am a :iittle apprehensive of the influence of Qasim Mn Abdullah among then, I a.n ? ho-Trevor y making secret enquiry so that ve may oe better able to judge when (and if) the AL AIN affairs coma to the ultimatum stage,” He therefore considered that the two questions should be treated separately,, .f.lh RliNfhL said that the communication which Colonel Reilly had just read furnished a strong further argument for dealing with the two cases separately. The question of the eventual ejection of the invaders from A.L AIN had been submitted to Lord Reading, who was prepared to concur in the adoption of the course of action suggested by the Acting-Resident, If the scope of the proposed ultimatum were to he extended to cover the Upper AURALI area, however, Mr* Rendel thought it would probably be necessary to obtain Cabinet author!by. In view of the urgency of the matter, he therefore considered it preferable that the question of AL AIN should be decided forthwith, leaving that of the Upper ATJTALI to be considered separately. COLONEL REILLY wished to point out that at AL AIN it was i'he Imam' s troops and nob local tribesmen who had acvually maue the aggression. He considered tlierefore chat warning of proposed action should be given to the local Zeidi Commander.-5- ■Mi- HENjjEL said that this anD°arpd + a -'P- a red to strengthen 'fcli© case lex* sendin^r ne ttLe P r °Posed ultirsatum to the imam, and net merely dropping notices locally as had at first been proposed by the ,ir Ministry. Meanwhile the question had an international aspect which could not be overlooked. The Imam had recently advanced his posts against !bn Saud in Asir, and His Majesty^ Government had not only strongly urged counsels of moderation on Ibn Saud and his Government, but had also, m accordance with the Home understanding of 1927, asked hie Italian Government to co-operate with them in trying to keep the peace, and to exert such influence as they might possess to restrain the Imam from embarking on hostilities„ ±. u . at this moment v/e were suddeni.y to take hostile measures against the Imam on the frontier ol the 1 rotectorate, without first explaining the position frankly to the Italians, and giving the Imam himself an opportunity to evacuate peacefully, our conduct might well be misunderstood a.nd misrepresented. The Italians would feel they had good reason to doubt the sincerity of our desire to bring about a peaceful solutioi of the difficulties between the Imam and Ibn Saud, while Ion Saud himself might be encouraged by our action in the south to embark on hostilities in the north. The Foreign Office therefore felt that it was essential (a) that the position should be frankly explained to the Italians, and (b) that the Imam should be given an opportunity to evacuate peacefully before operations were actually begun against him. 1.IE YICH Marshal BOPHI.TT was of the opinion that this situation made urgent action all the more imperative, and quoted the wire of the Acting Resident, Aden, in support of this contention.lib:. REHEEL agreed that in view of the Imam's pre- occupations m the north, any action we might eventually have to take against him would certainly be more likely to prove effective. He was not urging that such action should not oe taken, but merely that due precautions should be taken to prevent it from causing an unnecessary de t e i i o rat i on of the situation between Ibn Ss,ud and the Imam, or leading to misunderstanding with the Italians. COLONEL REILLY, in reply to a question by Mr. Rendel as to how long it would take to deliver any communication to the Imam, considered that a week was the normal period. In Aden the authorities usually allowed four weeks from the date of despatch before receiving an answer. He suggested that time might be saved, should the warning and ultimatum be combined in one letter to the Imam. AIR VICE MARSHAL BURNETT welcomed Colonel Reilly's suggestion. It should be possible to save a month's delay and thus expendite action. He recognised that not only would it take a week for the letter to reach SANAA, but some time must also be allowed for to enable the Imam to issue the necessary orders to his troops for evacuation. COLONEL REILLY considered that a fortnight from the date of despatch from AU3N was a reasonable warning period. This would allow a week for the delivery o_l the letter and a week for the Imam to issue the necessary instructions and to complete evacuation. In his view the Italians had very little influence on the Imam-MR ‘ Ha,B:EIj agreed that the Italians little real influence with the Imam, it howeverthat we should observe the terms had was important of the ) Rome understanding of 1927 to keep them informed O-l our intentions and, so far as possible, to act in concert with them in our dealing with the Imam. Pro\ ided it was made clear to the Italians that our proposed operations at Al AI1T were quite independent of the conflict between the Imam and Ibn S&amp;ud in the north, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was quite prepared to agree to the course of action proposed by the Acting Resident. MR. RERDEL, speaking personally, saw no objection to combining the two steps proposed by the Acting Resident in the manner now suggested by Colonel Reilly, i.e., that a single ultimatum, to expire in, say, a fortnight from the date of its despatch from IREN, should be sent to the Imam forthwith. This course of action, however, differed slightly from that which his Secretary of State had concurred in, and it would therefore be necessary for him. to submit the revised proposal to Lord Reading for approval. He was however prepared to do this immediately. AIR VICE MARSHAL BURNETT feared the of the AUDALI question being lost sight agreeing that the AL AIN and the AuTALI possibility of. While questions should be taken separately^ he regarded the one merely as a stepping stone to the other.He pointed out that the Imam load penetrated miles on our side of the line dra TO up by the Anglo-Turkish Boundary Commission and had consequently formed a salient which included BEIDHA and the 'upper- AUDALI country. He considered that it would be quite easy to combine Draft A, the warning, and Draft B, the ultimatum, which were attached to the Acting Hesident's letter (M.E.(0)17) into one letter. COLONEL REILLY concurred. MR. RE: DEL agreed that the question of the Upper Audali and Beidha area ought to be considered. So far as he remembered, however, this aspect of the question had already formed the subject of considerable discussion in the autumn of 1928, when it had been agreed to postpone action in regard to the Zeidi occupation of the Upper Audali country. He thought it would be well that what passed on that occasion should he looked up before matters were carried any further, in order that we might be sure that the reasons which had led us to defer immediate action three years ago no longer operated. MR. HOWARD also agreed to refer to the previous v correspondence in the Colonial Office on this question. THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed to recommend:- (1) That it is undesirable to link up the question of the ejection of the Zeidi tribes men from Beidha and the Upper Audali country, which has been in Zeidi occupation for some six years, with the present proposal to secure the immediate withdrawal of the Imam’s troops from the A1 Ain area and the Wadi Beihan, which they had recently occupied. (2) 'That the action suggested by the Acting Resident to enforce the withdrawal of the Imam 1 s troops from the A1 Ain area and the Wadi Beihan be generally approved; but that, subject to the approval of the Secretary f State for the Colonies and of the Secretary State for Foreign Affairs, the warning and ultimatum proposed by the Acting Resident should be combined, and that an ultimatum be^ sent to the Imam as soon as possible, inlorining him that unless the A1 Ain area were evacuated by a definite date air action would be taken to secure its evacuation. - 8 -( 3) Tb telegrsj him on approve. iciineh csrore hsGpatcho d (^) That a tins limit of date of the despatch of the the Resident at Aden 5 shoul Imam to evacuate the AL ATN limit of a fortnight from the tch of the vanning letter hy den^ should he allowed to the the AL AIN area* \. °) That the Foreign Office should prepare a telegram for despatch to H.M 0 Ambassador in Rome, instructing him to inform the Italian Government that a situation^ entirely inde pendent ofand unconnected with ? our attitude Imam and Ibn Gaud, has arisen on the YEMEN- ADEN borderj where the Imam's troops have recently made an unprovoked incursion into British territor 3 n It may consequently be necessary to eject these by force 5 after a warning period of fourteen days has elapsed* ADDENDUM TO C O NCLU SIONS,&gt; A copy of a telegram, approved by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and concurred in by the Secretary of State for Fo??eign Affairs, which was sent to the Acting Resident at Aden on September loth, in accordance with the conclusions of the meeting, is now attached (Appendix l), together with a copy of a telegram which lias been sent by the Foreign Office to 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.l. 14 th S ept e mb e r, 1931j&amp;rsBferage oo py nf „ wjrg. de_ 8 patoh S d hy Colo^ p«io e..t Reside nt~ Z. . : j. 5 ra 0 Tour despatch Number 160 of 5th August.

BURHEPT enquired whether the warning and ultimatum that it was proposed to send could not also be made applicable to the BEIIHA area and UPPER AUIALI country which the Zeidis have been occupying since 1925, and which in opite of frequent warnings they have made no attempt to evacuate, MRe RENHSL asked Colonel Reilly to describe the position -ui regard to the Beidb.a and Upper Audali area. COLONEL REILLY stated that in 1925 the Zeidis evacuated hie lower AURAL I, hut have ever since remained in the upper A URAL I country. From our point of view the situation was most unsatisfactory as it gave rise to endless tribal quarrels besides terming a sa lient well within the line drawn up by the original Anglo—Turkish Boundary Commission 0 It had been considered essential that we should regain control of this area* but negotia tions to this end were at present held up,, MR* REN IE L said that* while it was clear that there was a strong case for attempting to recover the Upper Audali area, the tuo cases, i. e. that of the recent Zeidi incursion at A1 Ain, and that of the earlier Zeidi penetration of the Upper Audali area did not seem to be quite on all fours. In the former case we were dealing with quite a recent invasion of our territory whichdemanded immediate action of a more or less police character. In the latter case, it was a question of utilising a recent incident elsewhere to redress a situation which had heen allowed to go on for several years. Moreover, whilU it seemed clear that the ejection of the ISeidi invaders at AL AIK would not be a matter of much difficulty, the recovery of the Upper AUDALI area might involve operations on a much larger scale. He asked for Colonel Reilly’s views on this point, In reply, COLONEL REILLY read the following extract from a letter by Mr* Champion, Political Secretary to the Aden Hinterland which, he stated, reflected his personal opinion:~ n It is for consideration whether, if the Note to the Imam has no effect, the Ultimatum might be made the opportunity for simultaneous action for the withdrawal of the Zeidie from the AUDHALI DHAHER. Here may be our casus belli. But while our successful action at AL AIN, only, would serve further to inflame the AUDHALI Sultan, I am still doubtful whether the two parts of the AUIIIALI tribe, above and below the QAUR, are sufficiently united under the influence and authority of the Sultan to be able to turn the Zeidis out of the DHAHER, and keep them out* Furthermore, tribal operations in tne DHAHER would be far more difficult in view of the long occupation by Zeidis, who may well have taken root there, and of the possible contention of the ’’upper” AUDHALIS that just rule and peace under BEIDHA is better than-4— disturbed freedom under their 0TO Sultan, I am a little apprehensive cf the influence of Qasxm bin Abdullah among then, r am, hcwe j er, making secret enquiry so that ve may ce better cune bo judge when (and. if) the AL A„N aiiairs come to the ultima turn stage. He therefore considered that the two questions should be treated separately,, i ®° RSN ' DEL Eald that the communication which Colonel Be illy had just read furnished a strong further argument for dealing with the two cases separately. The question of the eventual ejection of the invaders from .AL AIN had been submitted to Lord Reading, wno vras prepared to concur in the adoption of tne course of action suggested by the Acting-Resident, If the scope oi the proposed ultimatum were to be extended to cover the tfopeF AUPA.LI area, however, Mr 0 Ren del thought it would probably be necessary to obtain Cabinet authority* In view of the urgency oi the matter, he therefore considered it preferable that the question of AL AIN should be decided forthwith, leaving that of the Upper AURALI to be considered separately* COLONEL REILLY wished to point out the Imam f s troops and not local tribesmen the aggression* He considered therefore action should be given to the local Zeidi that at AL AIN it was who had actually made that warning of proposed Commander*iQjS^ - 5 - iviH. BMUEL said that this a speared to strengthen the case for sending the oropoeed ni j -- + ^ ^ uj^osea ultimatum to t&gt;ae imam, and not merely dropping notices locally as te d at first teen proposed ty the ,ir Ministry. Meanwhile, the question had an international aspect xvhich could not be overlooked. The Imam had recently advanced his posts against I bn Saud in Asir, an d Kis Majesty's Government had not only strongly urged counsels of moderation on Ibn Saud and his Government, but had also, m accordance with the Rome understanding of 1927, asked ohe Italian Government to co-operate with them in trying to keep the peace, ana to exert such influence as they might possess to restrain the Imam from embarking on hostilities. II at this moment we were suddenly to take hostile measures against the Imam on the frontier ol the 1-2 otectorate, without first explaining the position frankly to the Italians, and giving the Imam himself an opportunity to evacuate peacefully, our conduct might well be misunderstood and misrepresented. The Italians would feel they had good reason to doubt the sincerity of our desire to bring about a peaceful solution of the difficulties between the Imam and Ibn Saud, while Ibn Saud himself might be encouraged by our action in the south to embark on hostilities in the north. The Foreign Office therefore felt that it was essential (a) that the position should be frankly explained to the Italians, and (b) that the Imam should be given an opportunity to evacuate peacefully before operations were actually begun against him. AIR VICE MARSHAL BURNETT was of the opinion that this situation made urgent action all the more imperative, and quoted the wire of the Acting Resident, Aden, in support of this contention.— -O Mh * ilBjiiJjSL agreed that in view of the Imamus pre occupations in the north any action we might eventually have to tahe against him would certainly be more likely to prove effective * He was not urging that such action should not oe taken &gt; but merely that due precautions shou be taken to prevent it from causing an unnecessary deterioration of the situation between Ibn Saud and the Imam, or leading to misunderstanding with the Italians. COLONEL ^O-'-iLLfin reply to a question by Mr. Mendel as to how 7 long it would take to deliver any communication to the Imam, considered that a week was the normal period In Aden the authorities usuaj_ly allowed four weeks from the date of despatch before receiving an answer. He suggested that time might be saved should the warning and ultimatum be combined in one letter to the Imam. AIM VICE MARSHAL BURNETT welcomed Colonel Reilly's suggestion. It should be possible to save a month's delay and thus expendite action. He recognised that not only would it take a week for the letter to reach SANAA, but some time must also be allowed for to enable the Imam to issue the necessary orders to his troops for evacuation. COLONEL REILLY considered that a fortnight from the date of despatch from A BEN was a reasonable warning period. This would allow a week for the delivery Oj. the letter and a week for the laiein to issue the necessary instructions and tc complete evacuation. In his view the Italians had very little influence on the Imamagreed that the Italians had little real influence with the Imam. it was important however, that we should observe the terms of the Rome understanding of 1927 to keep them informed of our intentions and, so far as possible, to act in concert with, them in our dealing with the Imam. Provided it was naae clear to the Italians that our proposed operations ac AX AI1T were ou.it© independent of the conflict hety.'een the Imam and Ton Saud in the north, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was quite prepared to agree to the course of action proposed by the Acting Resident. 1£R. RUT DEL, speaking personally, saw no objection to combining the two steps proposed by the Acting Resident in the manner now suggested by Colonel Reilly, i.e., that a single ultimatum, to expire in, say, a fortnight from the date of its despatch from iDEN, should be sent to the Imam forthwith. This course of action, however, differed slightly from that which his Secretary of State had concurred in, ana it would therefore be necessary for him to submit the revised proposal to Lord Reading for approval. He was however prepared to do this immediately, AIR VICE MARSHAL SQRRRTT feared the possibility of the AULALI question being lost sight of. While agreeing that the AL Aid and the AGiALI questions should be taken separately, he regarded the one merely as a stepping stone to the other.He pointed out that the Imam had penetrated some-fifty miles on our side of the li ne drawn up by the Anglo-Turhish Boundary Conuaission and had can^nuem-M^ a uun ^equentiy termed a salient which included BuIBHA and the upper^dDAX/I country. He considered that it would be quite easy to combine Draft A, the warning, and Draft B, the ultimatum, which were attached to the Acting Resident's letter (M.E.(O)l?) into one letter. COLONEL REILLY concurred. MR, RE: DEL agreed that the question of the Upper Audali and Beidna area ought to be considered. So far as he remembered, however 9 this aspect of the question had already formed the subject of considerable discussion in the autumn of 1928, when it had been agreed to postpone action in regard to the Zeidi occupation of the Upper Audali country. He thought it v/ould be well that what passed on that occasion should be looked up before matters were carried any further, in order that we might be sure that the reasons which had led us to defer immediate action three years ago no longer operated. MR, HOWARD also agreed to refer to the previous correspondence in the Colonial Office on this question. THE SUB -COMMITTEE agreed to recommend (l) That it is undesirable to link up the question of the ejection of the Zeidi tribes men from Beidha and the Upper Audali country, which has been in Zeidi occupation for some six years, with the present proposal to secure the immediate withdrav/al of the Imam’s troops from the A1 Ain area and the Wadi Beihan, which they had recently occupied. ( 2 ) ’’That the action suggested by the Acting Resident to enforce the withdrawal of the Imam 7 s troops from the Al Ain area and the Wadi Beihan be generally approved; but that, subject to the approval of the Secretary f State for the Colonies and of the Secretary State for Foreign Affairs, the warning and ultimatum proposed by the Acting Resident should be combined, and that an ur oimatuin be ^ sent to the Imam as soon as possible, informing him that unless the Al Ain area were^ evacuated by a definite date air action would do ijeav^n to secure its evacuation.(3) That the Colonial Office should prepare telagram to tha Resident in Aden, ■ instructino* him on the above lines; to which Sa formal' approval of the Foreign Office should he ob tained before despatch. a (4) That a time limit of a fortnight from the date of the despatch of tne warning letter by the Resident at Aden, should be allowed to the Imam to evacuate the AL AIN area. (°) That the Foreign Office should prepare a telegram for despatch to H.M, Ambassador in Rome ? instructing him to inform the Italian Government that a situation, entirely inde pendent of, and unconnected with, our attitude on the existing frontier quarrel between the Imam and Ibn Gaud, has arisen on the YEMEN- ADEN border, where the Imam* s troops have recently made an unprovoked incursion into British territory. It may consequently be necessary to eject these by force, after a ^warning period of fourteen days has elapsed. ADDENDUM TO CO NCLUSIONS, A copy of a telegram, approved by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and concurred in by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, which was sent to the Acting Resident at Aden on September 15th, in accordance with the conclusions of the meeting, is now attached (Appendix l), together with a copy of a telegram which has been sent by the Foreign Office to His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires at Rome.

(Home), foreign OlTioe, I6th September, 1931, 2.00 No. 240. p.m Since despatch of Instructions in my telegram No. ^33 (cl 5th September) news has been receiwed that troops of Imam have occupied group of villages in Aden .protectorate territory. Imam was clearly warned in 1927 that occupation of any portion of Aden Protectorate rendered him liable at any time to retaliatory measures (see Foreign Office despatch No. 388 of 10th March, 1927) . Instructions have therefore been sent to Acting Resident, Aden, to address letter to Imam protesting, and informing him that, if his forces are not completely withdrawn from villages referred to within two weeks from date of despatch of letter from Aden, Seidi garrison towns in neighbourhood will be bombed. Please inform Italian Government accordingly.) No. lv\ • 'H'j 'fr sum Aden, February 1931 . My Lord, I hare the honour to report that Zeidi Intrigue ana martial demonstrations in the direction of the Beihan region are causing anxiety. The region liot 160 alias 11, ;., of Aden and beyond the Beida di.triot ,hl«h is now .ff.oto.n, 8eidi contr|)ll most if not all 01 it .existing maps are unreliable^ is to the south of the 'north-east line” prescribed by the Anglo-Turkiah Convention of 1904. Our treaty with the 3herif of Beihan was made in 1903, The Imam 1 a design, apart from his habitual one of occupying any vacuum left by our political control, is to establish his authority at a nodal point on the line of a future 2©idi penetration to the Hadhramaut. The Sherif with his neighbours and allies the M03ABI tribesmen are hostile to a Zeidi advance and have pestered us with reports - latterly confirmed - of Zeidi activities, and with requests for more armament and aeroplane support. Since 1926 they have received from us, in all, 162 rifles and 345,900 rounds of ammunition. But it seems fairly sure that unless we take further action Zeidi initiatives from the north (Marib), west (RADA) and south (BUM) will depress Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, London,loo&amp;l ^ppoiii ^io v : fe,nd oncibls a Zcidi ndlitery occupation of BKIUM Ah QASAB. the Mae&amp;bi aefctl in ths Wadi, which will then be extended to our It now t? kes 7 day a, for a letter and 12-14 days for an arms caravan to pass between Aden and Beihan. Desirable action by us would show that we wish to fulfil our treaty obligation - of protection - to the Sheriff thus enhancing the value of his alliance with the liss&amp;bi while reducing the risk of military invasion by the Zeidis, It would be possible to notify the Imam that Zeidi aggression on Beihan would cause reprisals by us in the Yemen, but I am averse to this notification, which to be effective would have to take th-? fora of an ultimatum, at this juncture. The alternative action is to send a British Officer to Beihan to study the military situation and capacity for local resistohce, to construct if possible a landing ground there, and to report on the feasibility, by inter-tribal co-operation (e.g. with the Aulaqi) or other measures, of creating an effective bar to further Zeidi advances. Lieutenant- Colonel Lake, Political Officer, is proceeding shortly to HI SAB, the head-quarters of the Upper Aulaqi confederation, and will endeavour to carry out this further mission to Beihan# I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your most obedient, humble servant, \ Resident etc#(0) 8th Ivltg i COPY MO, COlSnTTKS O P gAPERIAL DEFENCE. 0 OHCEHITJl fG~THE MIDDLE EAST'; A meeting of the above Sub-Comniittee Vvill be held in Conference Room tt A r ', Mo. 2* Whitehall Gardens, on Monday, 14th September, 1931, at 11.0 a.m. (1) Mote by the Colonial Office.

ENCROACHkEiNTS BY THE IMAM OF YEME NI.. Note Uy the Colonial Office, At the end of the Cxreat Far the Aden Hinterland was the only place within the British Empire where enemy troops were still in occupation,. The Turks were never ejected hy force they were negotiated out after the .Armistice, Later* their place was taken hy the Imam of the Yemen, whose forces occupied, without any show of right* a consideraile area of the land within our Protectorate houndary. Various attempts were made to induce the Imam to withdraw* and to negotiate a treaty with him that would regulate our future relations ;J All these attempts failed; and the despatch of special mission, under the late Sir Gilbert Clayton* to the Imam’s capital proved equally unsuccessful, The result was that in 1926 British prestige in those regions was low. Not only had we failed to drive out the Turks during the ■ar, hut we had failed in our negotiations with the Imam* He remained., in the teeth of our protests* in occupation of our pro tected territory. Eventually in 1923 the Imam’s forces were expelled hy air action from within our boundarieswith the ex ception of one small strip. To that extent- the position was re trieved, and a status quo was established which need no longer he regarded as one of humiliation. Since 1928 the situation has remained unchanged,&gt; Though irregular* it is not an altogether and there is much to he said for the view-2- that we can afford to wait on events and leave the Imam to malcB the next move. This is in fact the policy which we have hitherto pursued. It has been criticised in Parliament and elsewhere, on the ground that, by our negative attitude, we are missing a great opportunity of political and commercial advantage. This criticism has been prompted in the main by certain individuals (not officials) who are anxious to obtain concessions in the Yemen, and who find their way blocked by the Imam’s refusal to deal with British traders until ho has concluded a political settlement with Great Britain. The outstanding difficulty in arriving at any agreement is that the Imam claims the whole of the Aden Protectorate as part of his ancestral domain, and refuses to negotiate with us on any basis that does not recognise this claim. He does not accept the boundaries of the Protectorate as laid down between Great Britain and Turkey before the War, and argues that he cannot be bound by a settlement to which he was not a party. If this difficulty could be overcome, an early settlement could probably be reached; but acceptance of the Imam’s conditions would involve abandonment of tribes whom we are under a treaty obliga tion to protect - a proceeding which would not be consonant with the honour of the British Government. The gist of the Treaty obligations entered into between His Majesty’s Government and the tribes of the Aden Protectorate is, generally speaking, that the favour and protection' of His Majesty's Government are extended to the territory of the various rulers in return for an undertaking by them to refrain from corresponding ox- entering into Treaty relations with, or from ceding • . Tt , r*pr*tain of the Treaties territory to, a foreign Power* 1 athere is a further provision- that- trade-routeujshall he kept open and protected hy the various Chiefso Stipends are granted hy His Majesty’s Government to the Chiefs concerned, and it is also the policy of His Majesty’s Government to support the protected tribes hy the judicious distribution of arms and ammunition. The result of the Imam’s encroachment into the Protectorate (after the Turkish evacuation) was that trade routes wore closed, though we continued to pay subsidies to Chiefs who v/ere unable to keep their Treaty obligations in this respect* Many verbal protests were made to the Imam., all without success* Ultimately, as stated above, air action was taken* The authority for this action was based on a general decision of the Cabinet taken in 19 26, that the Imam was to be warned that occupation of the portion of the Aden Protectorate rendered him liable at any time to sucn measures by land, sea or air, at such time and in such manner as His Majesty's Government deemed suitable. The circumstances in which the present dispute has arisen are fully explained in the despatch -iom the Acting Pee si dent at Aden of tne 5 th of August, and Lieutenant-Colonel BoR.

Politically, the Masa’bi Chiefs are closely allied with the Sherif of Beihan by ties of common interest and habitat and, more formally, by undertakings between them to co-operate in the face of threatened Zeidi aggression; and it is no exaggeration to say that it would be impossible for the Sherif to stand alone * Not reproduced. -2-are in without the support of tile Jfesa'bi tra^awm, who a large numerioG.!. majority in uadi Beihan n- e ]-f o q - .L^xi and who in lact form hie mainstay. j 4 rnni «.-wi ^ Acquiescence m the Zeidi occupation of this important aasa'bi area would tend to alienate the sumpathies of the tribe, and have a most unfortunate effect on British prestige in the iiotectorate particularly in view or the „ , . * bxie G °ntinutid occupation of the Dnaner section or the Audhali territory by the Imam f s forces, based on Beidha. 6.

Copy of a Letter dated £5th August, 1931, from Lieutenant Colonel B.R 0 Reilly, British Resident, Aden, (now on leave) to the Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, commenting on the Acting Resident T s letter dated 5th August, 1931. (Reference M.E* (0) 17)„ 25th August, 1931. Sir, In reply to your letter 89276/31 dated 21 August, 1931, I have the honour to submit my observations on Major Wight-wick’s secret despatch of the 5th of August regarding the Zeidi encroachment into the A1’Ain region. The first point for decision is the puestion whether the A1’Ain district can properly be regarded as being within the Aden Protectorate. The boundary of the Protectorate has never been defined in this area, p.bout which little accurate information has been available until recently. Colonel Lake’s visit to Beihan early in the present year and aerial reconnaissances have now gi\en as clearer knowledge of the local conditions and the geogiaphy of the district. The only Chief in it with whom we have a Protectorate treaty is the Sherif of Beihan, and the question to be decided is whether our obligations to this Chief involve the protection of the Masa’bi territory, and, if so, whether the outlying Masa’bi villages of A1’Ain should be protected. - 1 -The first part of this question has already been carefully consiuered both by nr Stewart Symes and bv nyself and has been discusser in despatches from Aden. Our conclusion *«us chnu the j.*asa bis are so closely connected with the Sherif both politically and geographically^ and he is so dependent on their co~operation and support for the maintenance of his independence and authority, that the Sherif T s territory and the l!asa T bi territory in the Wadi Beihan must in practice be treated as a single unit, and protection of the fomer must, to be effective, be extended to the latter also. The llasa’bi tribe is not, however, entirely confined to the ^adi Beihan. There are outlying Masa 7 bi villages to the north and west of the valley. In nxy opinion our commitments to the Lasa’bis (to whom we have no direct treaty obligations) should be limited to the Beihan area, and we should not attempt the defence of their remote settlements in the Wadi Karib district. On this principle I WciS in favour of excluding A1 'Ain from our protection, but I took this view subject to the result of further aerial reconnaissance The additional information that has since been obtained has shown that A 1 '‘Ain is not a single village, but a group of villages, separated from the Wadi Harib by a line of hills and forming politically an integral part of the main Maga’bi tribal territory. In the light of this further information I am disposed to agree with the Acting Resident that A1 T Ain should be included in our protection for the following reasons (1) It appears that ul ' T Ain is more important and more closely connected with the main lias a T hi trice than Aas at first supposed.( 2 ) We have an example of divided control in the Audhali tribe, part of which is under Zeidi rule and part independent under British protection. This division leads to frequent intrigue and unrest, and it would be very undesirable to have a repetition of this unsatisfactory position in another part of the Protectorate. {Z) Experience has shown that'acquiescence in a Zeidi occupation of one portion of M. a 3 a * b i territory is likely to be followed by an attack on the remainder of it. The complete subjugation of the Masa T bis would make it impossible for the Sherif of Beihan to maintain his independence, and would give the Zeidis effective control of the whole Beihan area. This would in turn expose the Upper Aulagi territory to attack, and would open to the Imam a line of advance to the Hadramaut. I think therefore that Major Wightwick is right in considering that the Zeidi advance towards Beihan must be checked, and that we should not acquiesce in the occupation of A1 ’Ain. I agree with his recommendation that a formal protest should be addressed to the Imam, and that it should, if necessary, be followed up by air action. Long experience has proved that protests unaccompanied by action have no effect on the Imam. He is in the present instance pursuing his established policy of seizing all territory on his borders which is not effectively defended, and he will relinquish it only if he is convinced that refusal to do so will expose hin to active reprisals. Air action, if it becomes necessary, can be localised, as it was in 1925 and 1928, and does not imply a war which wduld involve the whole frontier. Our general relations with the Imam will remain much as they have been while ourposition in the Aden Protectorate is improved, by -proof that we are able and willing to defend it. These remarks are, of course, subject to the O.C., British Forces in Aden, being satisfied that he can carry out the proposed air action effectively, and to the Air Ministry 1 s approval of his doing so. Subject to this condition I support Major Wightwick T s proposals. I regret the delay in replying to your letter, which is due to my absence from London. I expect to return there early next week. I shall then be at Wilton (near Salisbury) until September 14th, after which I expect to be in London until I leave for Aden on September 24th. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) B.R.

Sir, I have the honour to infonn you that advantage was taken of Colonel Reilly's presence in this country to discuss with him the question of the future relations of his Majesty's Government with the Imam of the Yemen. 1 enclose, for your information, a copy of a semi official letter in which Colonel Reilly discusses the advisability of sending a British official representative to visit the Imam, not with the iranediate object of concluding a lreaty, but in order to create a better atmosphere and a clearer understanding of each other's policy and aims. 2.. The matter was fully discussed in Colonel Reilly's presence, with representatives of the Depart ments concerned, and the following conclusions were reached (a) It is considered that the policy adopted during the last few years of declining to negotiate with the Imam on any basis that would involve recognition of his claims in respect of the Aden Protectorate has been fully justified, both in principle and by its results. (b) It is fully recognised that advantages might accrue from the visit of a responsible British official to Senna for the purpose of entering into personal relations with the Imam and dispelling the atmosphere of suspicion that has hitherto prevailed. In the present circumstances, however, in the absence of any spontaneous invitation on the Imam’s part, the opinion is held that great MID© RESIDENT ADEN. -iwpp— *' i* ' .'rmif §&amp;'{ .‘’■ycA.nl o*t ra^mi 0 ,# evad I iu$f ai I^.^oloD It iir^ 10 . •; .; r •‘.‘.•.u. 0 ;; :• cSl'y Bt? lo i ’*v^r, v ' 0 %C,QO M % mtl DWTCr-m TOO^ 70- ,&lt; &gt;‘JC-TfiM- I mic /^x : IJ.'. f.( -‘ l * cs. r r,. inJt^ -o - : ■ v : - : C ! t !:• ■: '0 r, T^i 7C 6 ,i. in^f ,V.t v f'!i ,•; '•' ; 5 £ X-: 8 # iiisiHf la hm&lt;£^mbw m tom rif' .

A formal enquiry on the point has now been received from the Colonial Office and a draft concurring in their proposal to make the conclusions in question the basis of official instructions to the Residency at Aden is submitted. Paragraph 3 of the Colonial Office letter raises the question whether, before a final decision is taken, the matter need be referred to the Ministerial Sub-Committee. As stated by the Colonial Office, it was contemplated when the Ministerial and Official Middle East Sub-Committees were established that the former need be troubled to assemble only when the Official Sub-Committee failed to reach agreement, or it was necessary to reconsider recommendations of the Official Sub committee which any Minister concerned found himself unable to approve. So far as this Office is concerned, I submit that we may agree with Lord Passfield T s view that it is -unnecessary to trouble the Ministerial Sub-Committee.

S O.B.E., Resident at Aden, to Sir Joiin ShucldDurgho 815 &lt;TOiI11 SiIUCKBURGrK explained that the choect of the meeting was two-fold, namely (l) to deal with a specific proposal as to which there was some difference of opinion between the interested Departments, and ( 2 ) to tahe advantage of Colonel Keilly's presence in London to initiate a general discussion on the situation vis-a-vis the Imam Yahia of Yemen. as this was the first time the Committee had discussed the question of Aden? he wished to offer a few general observations* At the end of the Great ..ar the Aden Hinterland was the only place within the British Empire where enemy troops were still in occupation* The Turks were never ejected by force; they were negotiated out after the Armistice* Later? their place was taken by the Imam of the Yemen? whose forces occupied? v/ithout any show of right? a considerable area of the land within our Protectorate boundary* Various attempts were made to induce the Imam to withdraw? and to negotiate a treaty with him that would regulate our future relations® All these attempts failed; and the despatch of special mission? under the late Sir Gilbert Clayton? to the Imam’s capital proved equally unsuccessful* The result was that in 1926 British prestige in those regions was low* Not only had we failed to drive out the Turks during the 'far? but we had failed in our negotiations with the Imam* He remained? in the teeth of our protests? in occupation of our protected territory. Eventually in 1928 the Imam’s forces were expelled by air action from within our boundaries? with the exception of onethe Imam's eon trillions would involve abandonment of small tj’trip* i o laal ©xl© 11 ! Ih.© positioii was PslpievccLj 5 U 1 G. a status qiio was ©staolislicd. wlwicii 11 s© 1 no longep le regarded as one of humiliation, since 1928 the situation had remained unchanged* Though irregular it was not em altogether unsatisfactory one; and there was much to he said for the view that we could afford to wait on events end leave the Imam to moke the next move. This was in fact the policy which we had hitherto pursued* It had been criticised in Parliament and elsewhere«, on the ground that 5 by our negative attitude 5 we were missing a great opportunity of political and commercial advantage* This criticism was prompted in the main by certain individuals (not officials) who were anxious to obtain concessions in the Yemen 5 and who f oimd their way blocked by the Imam T s refusal to deal with British traders until he had concluded a political settlement with Great Britain. The Chairman said that he was anxious to hear Colonel Reilly 1 s views as to the actual value of the advantages, whether commercial or political ? trial we stood to gain by coming to terms with the mi am si^d as uO the extent and nature of the sacrifices thao nigh ^ reasonably be iu.ade in order to secuie sucn a seuulemento The outstanding difficulty was that the Imam claimed the whole of the Aden Protectorate as part of his ancestral domain, and refused to negotiate with on any basis that did not recognise tn^o c -elmHe not accept the boundaries of the Protectorate as laid down between Sreat Britain end Turkey before the War, and argued that he could not be bound by a settlement to which he was not a party. If this difficulty could be overcome, an early settlement could probably be reacaed; but acceptance - iUl *protect - a proceeding wh' 5 ^, wm-Pd - ^ woua.cL not dq consonant ^ith the honour of the British Government. Sir J. Shuokburghinvited Colonel Reilly to state his views to the Committee. COLONS B3ILLY consider ed that the views put forward by non-officials, such as Colonel Jacob and Lieut o Commander Crauford, were exaggeratedo The TniAm made full use of these persons, and the prospect of commercial advantages, as a lever to obtain the recognition of his authority over the Protectorate. ...he governing factor in that region is the religious one xn tne uenoral iemen the inhabitants are Seidis, who are akin to the Shiahs, and consequently followers of the Imam, who is their spiritual leadsr as well as their temporal ruler. In the Aden Protectorate the Arabs are Sunnis (locally known as Sliafeis) and they have no desire to break away from our protection. Treaties with these local tribes had been made by us within the last hundred years. On the departure of the Turks in 1919, the Imam asserted his claim to certain districts of the Hinterland, which he regarded as part of his ancestral inheritance« As the local tribes had thrown off the author it 37 - of the then Imams about two hundred years ago and had retained their independsnee since then, this clain was somewhat meagre and was repudiated by the tribes concerned* Hon- officials, like Cranford, urged that the Imamus claim should be recognised in return for trading concessions« He doubted very much whether the concessions hoped for \ would be forthcoming even if a Treaty were concluded. The and The Italians had gained very little from their Treaty had not secured any political puli in the femeu. truth tras that the Iman wished to avoid any Auj. ope an It was true that the influence or interference. -3-ic stabilisation of relations with the Imam might generally make uhings easier and might result in the improvement of the land trade via Aden,, Politically it was desirable to inuizce the Imam to abandon the strip of Audhali territory within our borders which he still occupied&lt;, In conclusion ? he seated that while the improvement or relations was desix'abl 6 s we are not now on bad terms with the Imam, though nc formal agreement exists e In answer to questions, he stated that the coffee trade from Mocha, which formerly came to Aden, had now been largely diverted to Hodeidah, whence it was shipped to Purope via Massow&amp;h, as produce of an Italian Colony. The mineral possibilities of the country had never been exploited* The highlands around Sanaa were very fertile, this region being the old TT Arabia Pelix n of the Romans* As regards the position of the Imam; his was a long dynasty, his authority being based mainly on religious n ^ , ephemeral,, ^ . grounds. It was not the re more/like that of the Idrisi, and may be regarded as secure * Trouble might occur when the present IiAam dies, as he has many sons; his eldest, Ahmed, being the probable successor. In the event of serious trouble, the outlying tribes of the Tehama on the Red Sea coast would probably try and throw off his yoke. There is a standing cause for a quarrel between the Imam and Ibn Saud over the territory which formerly belonged to the Idrisi. do actual conflict has, newer or, arisen« CROUP CAPTAIN PEIRSE stated that it was the view of the Air Ministry that the internal security of the-5- kjtj ~~ Protectorate wae depeadeat on our * j &lt;v Ur to protect our tribes fror: the Imam. it ^ v,„„- ^ hot/v o^^ i'*** +^, t v^s3.D.i.e to ao this in a greater mearruro than hitherto and he regarded the present situation as more satisfactory than it had ever been. He did not think that anything could be gained by making overtures to the Imam which might invite a rebuff * COLOiOil 35ILLY suggested that as no British official had visited the Imam since 1926, a visit by some competent officer might prove beneficial. At present non-officials like Cranford and Jacob had ao authority to speak and merely gave the Imam false impressions, with the result that he was encouraged to hope for more than we could possibly give. SIR JOHN SHUCE3URCHasked whether besides encouraging false hopesj these non-official representations did not create on the Imam's mind on impression of double-dealing on the part of the British Government; icQ* of appraoching him on different lines through official and non-official channels« COnONBL RHIIiIY agreed that this was true» He suggested that a visit .by a competent official might remove false impressions and create a basis of understand ing* He suggested that Mr-. Champion, Political Secretary in Men ? should go up* He then gave the following terms, and suggested instructions on which this visit might be based c lo Mr* Champion should go only in response to an unconditional invitation from the Imam - erg &amp; , there must be no stipulation on the latter's part that the object of the visit should be a discussion of the '''Craufcrd draft' or the immediate conclusion of a treaty * 2 o The main object of lor. Champion's visit should be- (a) to make the personal acquaintance of the Imam and his sons and principal advisers, and, as far as possible, gain tlieir oonf idenoe *(c) tbia jmrpooe Mr. Ch«apion ehoal^^w (r-^ f?0r neoess^-Uy for oomication to ta 3 &amp;*£) bow f) r H ° V ° Go ai ’ 6 P^epai-ei to go to mset the iaui.t to asoertatn as far t.e possible the real views cf regaS'to 6 ? 0 “ aei ' pe01,i5 of ^rtanoo with (i) political relations with His Majesty's (ii) ooiumeroial interaouree with iuien.

(b) will be difficult, and may be impossible unless His Majesty's Government are prepared to intimate that they intend to fulfil their obligations to the Audhalis if necessary by force. (cl will also be difficult and is of less importance. Mr. Champion should also note, as far as possible, the attitude of the Imam towards other foreign powers and towards Ibn Sand. He did not consider that even if the visit proved abortive, ^ should be regarded as a failure, as we would then haYe some ^finite indication of the Imam's attitude, and it could also he that we had been ready to cultivate friendly relations. He Was 'kks opinion that conditions had boon favourable for an Citation from the Imam during the Spring of the present year, they might continue to be so*0 Jgf }£R* RErTDEL expressed the view that however delicately the hint was conveyed that an invitation would he acceptable, His Majesty’s Government would appear in the position of a n suitor. He regarded it as an essential condition that the Isan, rather than His Majesty’s Government, should desire and propose a meeting. So long as the Imam thought we were in the position of an 'asking” power, no satisfactory result would he likely to come of the meeting. The attitude and character of the Imam could he judged from the report of Sir Gilbert Clayton’s Mission, and from the course of his relations with the Italians, who, in spite of all their efforts, could never rely on his goodwill. Should, however, the Imam require some counter-poise to Italian or Russian influence, or should he become seriously alarmed as to Itm Baud’s intentions, he might make approaches to us. Meanwhile ne thou^-t tnat it would he better to wait until the Imam was convinced that it would be to his interest to make advances. At present it was clear that we should be the chief gainers by a rapprochement, so that any advances we might make would be suspect and wou be unlikely to improve our position. V l GROUP CAPTAXH PEIRSE considered that^bis recent friendly attitude was largely attributable to his increased respect for H.M.G. who had shown clearly that they were prepared to enfo their authority in the Aden Protectorate both for the protection of Aden tribes from the Imam end for intexuial security 0 further considered that the only hope of inducing the Imam to invite Treaty proposals was an active frontier policy and tnat we were, if necessary, prepared to use force to regain our original territoryc SIR JOHR SRUCKBimaH stated that criticism had heen made that proper respect and treatment had »et teen accorded to the I«. It had heen ecgse.ted, tor cm.-ple, that it »= beneath the Imam’s dignity to deal with the Aden authorities.he ought to 'be invited to Cairo or to London in order to negotiate direct with representatives of the British Foreign Office. COLOBEL REILLY considered that perhaps too much respect had 'been paid bo hiin^ particularly 'by non-officials® The Imam had thus got an exaggerated view of his own importance and considered that his claims would he recognised should he persist*. in them® HR® kENDSL stated that everyone who had dealt with the Imam had found him quite exceptionally intractable and unreliable® The Italians 9 who had made a Treaty with him 3 were perpetually at odds with him and had made little headway® COLONEL REILLY stated that the invitation might come spontaneously from the Imam, but it may be necessary to convey some hint that it would be acceptable. He agreed that since he had been turned out of Dhala by force, his attitude had 'become more friendly® MR. LAITHYAITE said that the India Office were in general agreement with the Foreign Office point of vie?f® It seemed desirable, in the circumstances, that we should avoid mailing overtures, or what might be construed as overtures® If,however, Lie Imam were spontaneously to volunteer an invitation, the situation would be different, and there would seem no objection L) its acceptance. COLONEL REILLY said that some form of co-operation was already in force between the local officials on Doth sides of 01 -' lr “ boundary® The situation was on the whole satisfactory, accept in the Audhali country* At present, without a Treaty, °ur hands were free® The Imam had displayed his friendliness some extent by releasing hostages, but he still retained in stodgy some twenty of our tribesmen.* In reply to a question by Sir John Shuclchurgh, he said he did not consider any useial purpose 7/ould Toe served by invitirv' an envoy from the Imam to come to Aden. lie stated tn c tt the present situation was more nropitiaus for a Treaty than in 1926 when Sir Gilbert Clayton visited the Imam. He deprecated the use of any threat that we were not prepared to carry out. At present s reports from the many diverse official sources do not give a clear idea as to the Imam’s attitude, re is hnown to 'be suspicious of all foreigners. The main object of Mr. Champion’s proposed visit v/ould be to dispel this distrust by personal conversation,, and ascertain the Imam’s real attitude. CONCLUSION . (a) The Committee consider that the policy adopted during the last few years of declining to negotiate with the Imam on any basis that would involve recognition of his claims in respect of the Aden Protectorate, has been fully justified both in principle and by its results. (b) The Committee fully recognise the advantages that might accrue from the visit of a responsible British official to Sanaa for the purpose of entering into personal relations with the Imam and dispelling’ the atmosphere of suspicion that has hitherto prevailed. In present circumstances^however s in the absence of any spontaneous invitation on the Imam’s part, the Committee are of opinion that great caution should be observed and that no action should be taken which^ could in any way be represented as a definite overture on the part of His Majesty's Government. They recommend that no immediate steps should be taken in the matter failing a snontaneous invitation from the Imam, but that Colonel Reilly should be^ invited to review the whole question on his return to Aden. (c) The Committee recommend that such measures as may be considered practicable should continue to be taken to procure the release of the remaining hostages. 4■3 (d) They recommend that, if any suitable opportunitv shouldoccur, steps might he taken, as was ^ when air reconnaisances were recently carried out and a landing ground made at Behan to give the Imam ocular demonstration of our intention to resist aggression against our protected territory. 2 5 Whitehall Gardens ; S .

Please see previous submission on P.Z. 3025/31 / U on the subject of future relations with the Imam, and in particular a proposal nade by Colonel Reilly to send a British representative to Sanaa for the purpose of improving relations between the Residency (and so his Majesty 1 s Government) and Yemen. Our suggestion that the matter should be further discussed on Colonel Reilly's arrival in this country has been accepted and, as will be seen from Sir John Shuckburgh's letter of 2nd July and the C.I.D. memorandum below, a nesting of the Standing Official Middle East Sub-Committee is to be 4*. held to discuss it on Thursday, 9th July. Much most turn on what Colonel Reilly himself says and on the general trend of the discussion. I understand, however, that the Foreign Office are unlikely to modify their objections to ma.king any move in the direction of sending a representative to or seeking for an invitation from the Imam, and that the Colonial Office are rather shaken by the Foreign Office objections. rjjfe have in therecent discussions been rather inclined to think that no great harm would be done by action on the lines proposed by the Resident. But I cannot help feeling, after looking through the earlier papers, that the sound policy for us to pursue in this matter is the previous policy of the waiting game. If the Imam volunteers an invitation to us either to send an accredited representative or to send a junior officei of the Residency staff, the situation would be different and we might, I think, readily concur in this. But seems no prospect whatever of the Imam abandoning h c laims/ i ?claims to suzerainty over the Protectorate (and over the disputed islands in the Red Sea). Colonel Reilly in his latest letter equally considers that he is not likely to evacuate those parts of the Protectorate which he still holds, except under pressure; and the Resident remains of the opinion that, while the Imam wants a treaty, he wants it on terms that His Majesty’s Government will not accept but which he still hopes he may persuade them to grant if he presses his point sufficiently strongly. The conclusion of a treaty on our own terms would indeed be a satisfactory solution of this tiresome and longstanding problem. But we have nothing to lose by maintaining the status quo . If the Imam aggresses against our protegee in the Protectorate we are in a position, with the assistance of the Air Force, to deal with any attacks he may make expeditiously and economically. As Sir Stewart | j Symes pointed out at the interdepartmental conference held on 15th August, 1930 (P. 5476/30, at flag A), it is 'satisfactory that the Imam was now in the position of a suitor to His Majesty’s Government. In the past he may have had the impression that H.M.G. were anxious to conclude a treaty with him.' I think the balance of advantage is definitely in favour of leaving things as they are, maintaining courteous and friendly relations with the Imajm as far as possible, but making no move which could be interpreted as an indication of our anxiety to conclude a treatysave on our own terms. The Imam knows what those terms are; he knows that we are in a position to deal with him if he aggresses; and if the Resident is right m thinking that he is unlikely to abate his pretensions, there is nothing to be gained on our side by making overtures, or what might be construed as overtures. 1/53pJ- o? ?&gt; r- * * St Q-t-P, (^v ir^J^fU/' ~J J L_CKLAL ClFPLCE v JU^A.

On the other hand he will not abate his claims nor evacuate those 10 arts of the Protectorate which he still holds except under pressure* which he believes that His Majesty’s Government are not likely to apply® That he wants a Treaty is no doubt true* but he wants it on terms that H.M.G. will not accept* ana which* unfortunately * he still imagines mat he may oe able to obtain from perseverance and persistence® This belief is due in considerable measure to misleading impressions created by certain non-oxficials* who have visited him. Although the present state of affairs is* as you say* reasonably satisfactory* I of course entirely agree-2- thuo it would 'be much better if we could get a proper Treaty with the Iman.

Such an appointment is impossible as our relations stand at present 5 but if the Iman would give an indication to the British official representative to visit him s it might be a good thing for one - say Champion - to go 5 not with the immediate object of concluding a Treaty * but in order to create a better atmosphere and a clearer understanding of each others policy and aims. I agree that personal contact and discussion is worth far more than correspondence® he shall make no progress (peacefully ) with the Iman unless we can substitute some degree of actual confidence for the present feeling of mistrust and antagonism® It may prove impossible to do this by any means* but it certainly will not be accomplished by letter writing* to which the Iman attaches little value® The idea of a visit by a British official to Sanaa is a course open to the objection that it may very likely produce no immediate result end so appear to have been a failure® I should personally be disposed to risk this, it being borne in mind that the primary object would not be an immediate Treaty* but better relations which may eventually lead to one® If this suggestion were-5- &lt;g) accepted I think it night he possible to obtain an invitation iron the Inan without, in the first instance, making any official proposal on our side to the visit, but I shall of course make no move in this direction without your previous approval./ 0.*. \M. y Please see Sir John Shuckburgh’s letter of 3rd July below, enclosing a draft reply to Mr. Day’s question for the 7th July on the subject of relations with the Imam.

As 1 was given certain instructions to carry Qht C which are attached to this report) , the report will commence by dealing with these instructions as briefly as possible*. 2.

We arrived at im-Nucub at about mid-day on oimday, 15th March, on approaching which our escort was reinforced by another contingent of Ahl Mus'Abein, in view of the fact that Beyyid nalim bln Deiran, who is at feud with the hherif and lives on the opposite bank a of the Wadi about 600 off, had tiireatened to fire on is us, or so it was reported.#*e were met by w*e inherit, Atoed bln kune in, with the usual ceremony, and given comfortable quarters in his nouse. Everyone from the ^rlf downwards was most hospitable and Kind. fttiat was chiefly noticeable, from tne time of our entry Into Pei Jan territory, was (1) the unity 0 f the various portions of which the personnel are composed, viz Ashraf, am fhisa’Bein and Bal-narith, and aeyyid -*u!isin bin jsusein and his followers, the nosti Important of the hey,,ids, (5?) the orderly conduct and good manners of everyo , tribesmen and ^IviHohs, ni. (3) the evident pleasure with which our visit was regarded. with my previous experience of other portions of the protectorate 1 was rather suspicious of the last, attributing it cniefly to a l ist for ‘filthy lucre* and the nope of making wnat they could out of us. fits begging attitude of Beinan Chiefs when they visit Aden also contributed to this suspicion. But I think 1 was wrong, as I never heard the word ‘Bakhsnish* or Fisah* from tne time we entered Beihan to tne time we left, except on the part ot U-o soldiers of the Upper Aulaqi oultan who had accompanied ue. It was most refreshing after the importunity of personnel in the Upper Aulaqi sultan's territory, of whom the auitan and his haqib were the worst. The tribal Sheikha and tribesmen themselves, both of the Axil musa'&amp;eln and Bal harith struck me as being of quite a different type from others in the Protectorate, and a better type altogetner. vn Monday, loth March, all the principal uneikhst .0 Manawa, i ia8 to go via UM kablaqaa i aas and AX** * Aili# 1 am or opinion taat both lor political mid strategical reasons these two villages should be included in the area to be defended against Zeidi agression and that any attempt at zeidi occupation of these two villages should be opposed. For political reasons, because the sections of the Ahl ha'lm wno occupy that territory are a portion of the Ahl Na'lm inhatn ting the wadi Kharr ( which should be considered as part of the &lt;.&amp;di Beihao) and are very closely connected with than. For strategical reasons owing to the proximity of these two villages to the wadi to the wadi Beihan, and the threat to Beihan Zeldl occupation of them would cause. while we were at Ar-hona, a messenger was supposed to i*ve brought news of another threatened attach on these places and hhelkh hasida bin Jabar, was brought to me by the Na'lml dneikh, Aiimed msein, accompanied by tne kas'Abi nheikhs and the niiarif'e sons, for orders as to the action to be adopted by them. 1 think the whole thing was faked and was put up as a test to hear my decision. I told them that, until'ray return to Aden and the submission of ray report, they must accept the Resident's decision tnat h.ti.G.wlU give no assistance in the defence of areas other than the Wadi Beihan itself. I told them that they were at perfect liberty to undertake themselves the defence of these villages against Zeidi attack and that the wnole of the Aid f asa'Bein could support them if they so desired, but they must understand that there must be on no accountaccount any encroacrment on their part occupied ieidi territory. part into treaty with nim alone and ti*t all mattere in Sheika aa independent of him. Sheikh Alawi Aimed, at one time the rival of the fcaea'Bi niieikh and an intriguer with the Imamlc Government, appeared to nave quite cimnged hie views, ne was strongly anti-ze-idi and very friendly with both the Sharif and Sheikh Ahmed self, ne is a man of strong personality and of Jovial hearty demeanour and sr(-med to be a favourite with everyone, nis Ci^ige of attitude may be due to two causes. iJiratly hie cold reception by the imam in saoa'a aiid secondly an agree- meat at which ne ii&amp;s arrived with hnelkh Aimed seif that they should go halves lh everything, ihey got me to bear witness to this agreement which 1 consented to do, explaining that 1 was very glad to see than 4 ; united again but tnat any arrangements to which they came amongst themselves did not concern us, and they must understand that we still recognise Aimed neif as the Masa'Bi Chief. As regards local defeaee against neidi attack, 1 am of opinion that, shewing a united front as they wouldmould do, and UUcing into consideration the spirit and war-like qualities of the Ahl Musa 1 Be in and Bal arith, they are capable of defending thecseeives against Imainic aggression (except on a large scale) provi led that they are adequately supplied with arms and aniHunl tiom ihe tribesmen we saw all seemed to be well-armed and to nave full cartridge belts and 1 do not think that they really need my more of either just at present though per naps a small quantity of each to both the Bharif and the feasa 1 !! Bhtikh as an encouragement to them in view of our recent visit would do good* 4* Now that there is a landing ground at Beihan Al-^asab, aanunitlon can always be flown there in case of urgent necessity. The Upper ulaqi bultan and his followers seem to have feeling of enimity against the Bharif aind the Beihanis ovd ng to a long standing feud, and tneir antipatiiy came as a surprise to me* 1 do nob think any reliance can be placed on the Upper Aulaqi ^uitan going to the aseiatanee of Beinan in case of Zeidi attack* I put the question direct to the bultan pointing out that it was to tneir advantage to support the Beihanie, as should the geidis succeed in establishing themselves in heihan , the an ..®ce to Aulaql territory would be a grave danger* he replied that they would support the bharif only if actually ordered to b^ us, and that as for meeting any menace to Aulaqi territory by the Heidis, tne nulaqis were one and united and quite capable of looking alter their frontier provided they were adequately supported by3m. by his a-ajeety 's Government. 5. tte Heidis dlapoaiuons at tiie time of our visit were no different to Uioae already Known, viz.a headquarters at Al-dauba, and Barrieotm at iarb A1 all harib and Murad and tne usual garrison at Rada*. While we were in del nan, it was reported that Aid. 'Abld (in the vicinity of arlb) had received a letter from Ibn oa'ud telling them not to submit to the Imam and that they could expect assistance from id.® in near future. ih® luaia is still, tr^-iug to triug tlic Aiil 1 Abi d under nio control and to talc# nostages off them, but without success. As objectives for air actions the places mentioned above would be suitable, but as their locality is not accurately Known, 1 suggest now tiiat there is a lauding ground in Beihaa, that these places be flown over and pointed out by an intelligent Beihaal, either one of the nnarif’s younger sons, or Sheikh Kasim Ahmed, and be piiotographed. Other places such as Al*Ain, Manawa and bfiaoir could also be Identified. Failing itself, hada’ would be a desirable objective for bombardment. 6. Immediately we arrived at An*huciub, it was evident to F/L Kickards that there was no piece of ground in the neigiibourhood of the un&amp;rif’s residence suitable for a laxidirig ground. I pointed this out to the hnarlf who was naturally very disappointed and also Inclined at first to be a bit obstructive, he hinted at putting difficulties in our way in proceeding to Beihan Al-^sab unless he 1 J iwas presented with a gun, and wanted me to »»/T thie to Aden and get a reply: 1 pointed out to him tiiat, even if 1 did w/1 his refiueet to Aden, the fiesident wae not In a position to grant iiim a gun, but would nave to get permission from H*M« U, 1 also explained to iilm that, as far as the defence of Beilmi was concerned which wae the primary object m constructing a landing ground, it was immaterial whether it was at An-Huqub or Beiiian Al»^asab, However the old man, wiao is really in his dotage, soon came round after he had been taken in hand by his two younger sous, Awadh and Husein, who more or less told him to keep quiet and not to talk nonsense, and in the end he wae quite satisfied and gave us every assistance. He is rather naturally afraid, 1 think, that the presence of a landing ground actually at the door of the Kas’Abl Sheikh’s residence, will give the latter, already the most powerful and influential Chief in Beihan, still more feiluence. He asked tiiat, any time it was decided that a machine should laud in Beihan, he might be informed first. I told him tiiat this would be done when possible but that as a rule it would not be feasible. P/L Rickard* made a landing ground at Ar-Hona, where the Masa’Bl hheikh lives. 7. Prom the time of our arrival in hi sab, it was made clear to us tiiat we could expect a certain amount of opposition to our visit toBeihan on the part of heyyid balim ibn Aimed bin Dei ran, not due to any hostility towards H.M.G.but owing to a feud he had with the Sharif and the fact that he refused to recognise thethe Sharif as the Chief of Belhaa. *hile we were at hieab, he paid a visit to the Upper Aulaqi sultan at An-lAiqub. and I heard afterwards that had expressed a desire to visit me at Misab with a view to asKing me to try to settle his dispute with the Sharif, but he was not permitted to do so and returned toBslhan. It was clear, ho*.f ver tiiat he could make no active opposition to ue as his following does not consist Of more than about 10 men. he lives at A1 *Atf, a small village on tim opposite bank of the Wadi to An-Nuqub and about 600* from it. While we were at An-huqub the hnarif expressed a desire to patch up hie quarrel with the neyyid and later on at Ar-hona, hheikh Ahnmd neif Al-Masa'bi told me tiiat he was going to try toarbitrate between them. 8. Ihe hiarlf made clear his intention to abdicate in favour of hie youngest son, iiisein and wished the turban to be placed on the latter's head in my presence, while all the chief hheikhs and notables of Beihan were on the spot. I did not agree to this and advised his writing in officially to tne Resident about it before taking say action, the bharif's abdication will be all for tne good as he is too old now to carry out multifarious duties of a Chief and nas not got the grip of affairs which he used to nave though he still commands the respect and affection of ids subjects. ids choice of iuseln is a good one. nt is the most Intelligent and active of his sons and universally popular. 9. we accepted invitations to lunch with nheikh Alswi Aimed at Al-'Allan which is part of Beihan Al- qasab, with nheikh Ahmed .susein, the Chief of Ahl-Na'Im at Al*Ahmar in the wadi Kiiarr about one nour from Beihan■ an advance from K.M.

Should we n&amp;lt to bivouac for the night, it was 'Be it hard. Asakar* who brought us firewood lamps and other necessaries, union duties they would not permit our servants to perform, the control the Chiefs had was most noticeable, especially on the march and in the villages and we were always protected from petty annoyances such as tribesmen crowding round, ladivlduals asking for presents etc.which is often a feature of the inhabitants of other tribes. There was no case of any Chief or anyone else asking for a present, neither were we permitted to pay any escort fees « and our escort were large, not for safety's sake, but as 'Bharaf' to us.

Sir, I have the honour to inform rm you that a certain SI Sayed My al Ahdali of the Yemen recently called on the Oriental Secretary and profeaeed wiiiin^neea to render ser to His Majesty's Government in the Yemen. render service 2. He came with a letter of introduction from j?l s.yed Merthani K1 Idrisi. He was app t ,rea$ly a friend of the late Sfyed MuBtafa El Idrisi. He claims to have worked in co-oper-a with the late Air trilhert Clayton and other British authorities during the war. 3. Ha said that a very considerable proportion of the population and tribes of the Yemen were discontented with the Imam Yehia and would like to overthrow him. He suggested that these discontented elements could be utilised by Ibn Saud againi his rival the Imam. He apparently imagined that Ibn Saud was our favourite and that v^e would welcome his getting hold of the Yemen. 4. Mr.Smart explained that the affairs of the Yemen were not within the competence of the Keeidency. He added that we had, anyhow, no wish to interfere in the internal affairs of the Yemen or to intrigue for or against the Rulers of the Arabian Peninsula. He concluded by suggesting that if Al Ahdali wished to make any political communications regarding the Yemen to British authorities, he should address himself to the Residency at Aden within whose competence such matters lay. 5* I have forwarded a copy of this despatch to Hia Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

Lord Passfield is disposed to inform the Resident that he sees no objection to the adoption of his suggestion, if it is found possible to ootain an invitation from the Imam without in the first instance making any official proposal for the visit. I am to enquire whether Mr. Secretary Wedgwood Bern concurs in this proposal. I am, Sir, —r- Your most obedient servant,c. r/ K /-■/ r ; ! 2670 THS RS3ID3NCY, Aden, lot April, 1931. 1Q; tX Dear Sir John, Thank you for your letter of 6th larch 1951 enclosing copies of a memorandum from Mrs* Craufurd and a letter and memoranda from Lieutenant-Commander ^Faufurd* As you say, the status quo is at present being preserved on the Protectorate frontier* The imam is not likely to try to disturb it (except by propaganda) as long as he believes that to do so will expose him to reprisals on our part; but from our past experience I think that he would not hesitate to do so if he supposed that we would take no action. He is a realist and does not wish to risk a serious quarrel* On the other hand he will not abate his claims, nor evacuate those parts of the Protectorate which he still holds except under pressure which he believes that H. *G* are not likely to apply. That he wants a treaty is no doubt true. But he wants it on terms that H.iv’.G. do not accept, but which unfortunately he still imagines that he may be able to obtain through perseverance and persistence, ihis L^eliei is due in considerable measure to misleading impressions created by Craufurd and others who have visited i®. Although the present state of affairs is, as you say, reasonably satisfactory, i of course eniirelj agree that it would be much better if we could get a proper treaty JOHN SHUCKBHRGH, K.O.: .G.,C.B.4 . treaty with the imam. The negotiations have been confused and hampered by Craufurd’s well-meant but very ill advised intervention, and an important first step is to efface the false hopes raised by his conversations and pourparlers at Sanaa, I wish we could have a reliable accredited (Arab or Indian) oslem representative there who might cultivate good personal relations with the Imam and his advisers and try to remove the suspicion with which they regard us, while at the same time making clear the point beyond which E.M,Gp* are not prepared to go. Such an appointment is impossible as our relations stand at present; but if the Imam would give an invitation for a British official representative to visit him, it might be a good thing for one - say Ch&amp;nqpidn- to go, not with the irmiediate object of concluding a treaty, but in order to create a better atmosphere and a clearer understanding of each other’s policy and aims. X ogre© with Oraufurd that personal contact and discussion is worth far more than correspondence. We shall make no progress (peacefully) with the Imam unless we can substitute some degree of mutual confidence for the present feeling of mistrust and antagonism. It may prove impossible to do this by any means, but it certainly will not be accomplisbat by letter writing, to which the Imam attaches little value. The idea of a visit by a British official to Sanaa is of course open to the objection that it may very likely produce no immediate result and so appear to have been a failure. I should personally be dispose a risk this, it being borne in mind that the primary object would notnot be m r-mediate treaty but better relations which may eventually lead to one. If this suggestion were accepted I think that it might be possible to obtain an invitation from the Imam without in the first instance making any official proposal on our side for the visit, but I shall of course make no move in this direction without your previous approval. lay I suggest that Parliamentary replies to enquiries about the cause of delay in the negotiations should concentrate on the main - and, in fact, the only serious - ebstaele to than, namely the Imam* s demand that his sovereignty should be recognised over tho tribes of the Aden Protectorate, whose independence H.M.G, have by old-standing treaties undertaken to protect? The more clearly that this single point is insisted on, the less open will our attitude be to misrepresentation in England and in the Yemen. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) B.R.

Your Lordship will observe that the Imam reiterate® his claim to be recognised a® the ultimate suzerain over the tribes inhabiting ’that division of the Yemen which is under the charge of the British Government 1 (a.g. the Protectorate), and by virtue of that claim denies the ri pt of His ajasty’s Government to interfere in any way in the affairs of the subjects of the Yemen, or (by implication) to intervene on behalf of the persons detained by him. 3. He explains that these persons are of two categories, e. a) those who, having been previously in his military service have been imprisoned in accordance with his ilitary negations, and ^ b) 8 MAJSSTY's BilCRSTARY OP STAT3 K0R COLON I IS, LONDON.b) hostages, who have been detained (it is to be understood, for political purposes) in accordance with ancient custom, ihe Imam states that he has given orders for the trial and disposal of the persons in the former category by his ilitary department: in r ; :ard to the host^es his attitude is more conciliatory, and his promise to enquire into their condition with a view to their release is obviously intended as a gesture of friendliness. Your Lordship will note, however, that even this concession is made ex r:ratia. 4 . In this connection I am pleased to be able to in for * Your Lordship that the Imam has so far fulfilled his promise as to have released eight hostages from hadhira on the 4th arch 1941, and that i t has been reported from bhala* that further releases are expected. 5. In so far meeting my predecessor’s representations, the Imam has plainly had ti e farther object in view of reconciling His lajesty's Government to his attitude in regard to treaty relations, and he again p ts forward the terms of the 'Craufurd draft* as the basis for negotiations. ' e complains that his previous proposals have been misrepresented in Aden to imply that he desires a British withdrawal from Aden and its vicinity, without specifically denyin: this implication, he proceeds to point out the necessity for the proper reli ious and social organisation of the Protectorate in view of its identity with the 'motherland 1 , and refers to the expression of his aims this respect in(2€*$ I in the 'Craufurd. draft ' (vide Articles II and III P. thereof). 6, While it is satisfactory to note the friendly tone of the Imam’s c orrriun i c at ion, it is obvious that his letter does not represent any substantial alteration in his attitude towards the outstanding question of recognition of the Men Protectorate, 1 therefore propose, subject to Your lordship 1 s concurrence, to reply to the Imam in the terns of the draft letter attached hereto, of which I have the honour to request Your Lordship’s approval., 7. I have already addressed an interim reply to the Imam, expressing appreciation of his action in regard to the hostages, and informing hin that his letter would be laid before Your Lordship at the earliest opportunity.

After Compliments, After the presentation of full respect befitting your position, and our sincere wishes, we beg to enquire about the state of Your Excellency and wish you success both in the beginning and in the end. 7/e also beg to state that we have received your most civil letter No.C/41 dated the 1st Ramazan 1349. &lt;e have considered it with the high appreciation that w© have for long entertained for your excellency, as you have had full experience of public affairs ana as you have always entertained good intentions both for us and for our Kingdom we deemed it necessary to say that Your Excellency’s wisdom and kindness has caused us to give consideration to your esteemed letter in a manner befitting it, and we confidently expect four excellency to consider our reply in a manner befitting it, ana reouest you to exert your utmost zeal to secure the very important and necessary agreement between the two kingdo s. ,p s r e; ards the persons about whom you engp^r-: in your letter under reference, no oppressive or ^j rigorous treatment has been imposed on them in our j territoryterritory, as intimated by youfrom the news news received by lour excellency from evil disposed persons, but they have been detained in accordance with procedure usua; uice with procedure usual kost of these men were ano n -tural in every State. Lost of these men were soldiers ior long employed in our Army and they were detained as required by our ilitary Regulations. It is not conceivable that there was any political motive for this action. As to the detention of the others, you must know that it was done in accordance with ancient custom in force in our territory. It is but natural that the people of our territory, being inhabitants of the Yemen only, and Imamic subjects, are bound by the rules and regulations of the Government of the Yemen. Our Government can agree to no exception to this principle, for it is an admitted fact that in accordance with the ri ;hts of Governments and Nations and their approved current regulations, the legal natural and original allegiance of the people of that division of the Yemeh which is under the charge of the British Government is preserved, and that it is not to be changed by reason of that charge, it is obvious also that the Aden authorities, in accordance with the regulations of national rights, have no legal right to interfere in any way in the affairs of the subjects of the Yemen. Government, during the last 12* years, have made every effort to show our good intentions, for the removal of all causes of trouble and disturbance between our Government and the British Government. In spite of these means to organise affairs officially by a treaty between Notwithstanding this both we, kind our the two Governments, our previous efforts to this end ,/ / havehave been strangely rsiicinberprebed and cornplBtQly were represented to show that our Government had no wish or object other than to remove th© British Government from ^cen and its vicinity. These were the reasons which prevented the conclusion of concord and agreement between the two Governments till now. Both we and our Government have thought it appropriate that such an arrangement should be considered and effected as would secure the proper control of among the inhabitants of that part of the Yemen which is under the charge of the British Government, in their dealings with the inhabitants of the other part which is th© mother land, owing to their being united in religion, origin and disposition. $e are confident that the execution of this essential arrangement is necessary for th© interests both of the British Government and ourselves. In the draft treaty wich was drawn up with Commander Craufurd there were clauses which embodied our real objects and aim, but as the representation of our expectations and requests was always met with misinterpretation and misunderstanding, as we have previously explained, those draft terms which were sent with Commander Craufurd have, until now, been shelved and forgotten. Actually we believe that the said draft terns are feasible and sue!’, as could secure a final enduring agree ent between the two Governments, in that they are suitable to the interests of both parties. It is therefore only just that you should reciprocate our good wishes, expectations ano reversed. it has been repeatedly mad© clear that they religious affairs, public morals and good conduct intentionsinte iionB by similar ours. God forbid that there should be any other differences between us. you enquire, this is a question that may cause mi sunders tiding and dissension between the two Governments and lead to constant rupture arid variance between both parties. It is therefore necessary to eliminate such ill-feelin by hastening to bring about a treaty between the two Governments, that would deal with such particular points by me-uis of suitable terns Ge have at all times paid due regard to the greatness and honour of the British Government and have always cherished hopes of concord and absolute and perpetual friendship with the British Government, relying on their good reputation and national honour, but, as the proverb says, the natural instinct of a man is to avpid him who loves him* Our aesires are not reciprocated by the British Government and this w rescret excaedingly. as stated in the beginning of our Proof of our intention and of the true respect re re ;ards the persons detained, about whom present letter a sincerely wish to comply with your eataemad request, and for this reason we again say in entertain for the British Government, that we have issued orders to the Officer Comnanding our Force to take early steps for the prosecution and trial of issued orders to the uiiicoj take early steps for the f-r&lt; 1 for enquiries to be maae presentpresent hoBtages now in Taiz district and for full particulars about them to be submitted to ub. -»e ive a promise to Your Excellency that we shall, if (iod wills, accord these persons pardon and consolation after receipt ol the reports about them, Ihis action on our part is taken solely out of the special regard we enter tain towards the admitted and acknowledged reputation of the British Government. It far exceeds the limits of our* rules and regulations and is confined to this occasion only.
