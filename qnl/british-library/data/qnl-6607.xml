( Confidential.) 18977 ' Note on the Turkish Fort at Fao on the Shat-el-Arab. (With Sketch Map of the Shat-el-Arab.) 1883 to 1897. Fao is a village on the west (Turkish) hank of the Shat-el-Arab, and is thus described in Findlay’s Directory for the Navigation of the IndianOcean. (Persian Gulf, Chapter XIII., p. 712.) “ Passage up the river to Basrah. “ After entering between the regular banks with vegetation, the eye is the chief guide. The southernmost part of these banks is quite swampy, all of soft alluvial mud, thickly grown with weeds and coarse grass. It is almost impossible to land, so soft is the mud. The first date grove is on the west bank, about four miles from Has al Bisheh; and there is a small village called Fao or Fan in it. The direction of the river is N.W. from the mouth, until past the south end of Kusbeh Grove, when it turns to N. ^ E. for about four miles. “ The Electric Telegraph Cable, as before stated, is landed at Fao from Bushire. It is not a station, but the line is continued on to Basrah, and thence along the course of the great rivers, through Asia Minor to Constantinople and the European system.” * “ Aitchison’s Treaties, Vol. X., Appendix, page It, Third Edition.” “/Translation of Articles of Agreement concluded at Erzeroum and signed by the Turco-Persian Commissioners on 31st May 1847 :— “ Article 2 .—The town and port of Mohammerah and the Island of Khizr with the anchorage, as well as so much of the Eastern bank of the Shat-el-Arab as is occupied, by tribes confessedly belonging to Persia, are to remain in the possession of Persia, besides which, Persians will enjoy the complete liberty of navigating the Shat-el-Arab from its mouth to the point of contact of the two frontiers. Soolumaneeyeh will remain in the possession of Turkey. In regard to Nohab, the Persian Government settles that all the mountainous portion with the pass of Kerrond on its eastern part will be retained by it, and the plain of Nohab, which forms the western portion, will be given over to Turkey.” Letter from Foreign Office, 16tb April 1887. H. C., Yol. 9.‘3, page 825. “ The Commander-in-Chief came down to Fao to fix on a site for a lighthouse which is to be erected there, and to arrange about a light-buoy to be placed at the bar, to enable ships to enter the river during dark nights. # # # # # “The Pasha visited Fao at the end of April in a small river steamer. He steamed past Fao some two miles and back again. He did not land lower down, and could not have decided on anything there. He arrived at Fao about noon, landed, and with his siaff, was the whole time at the Telegraph Station, and nearly S. 19. A 3. In May 1883 the Officiating Political Agent and Consul at Basrah mentioned, among; items of intelligence, that the Commander-in-Chief of the Bagdad Corps d’Armee, accompanied by the Com modore, the Mutessarif of Basrah and other officials, had paid a visit to Fao, “ where it is rumoured the “ Turkish Government desires to build a fort or “ a lighthouse.” In subsequent reports it was stated that,— 2. The eastern bank of the Shat-el-Arab is Persian territory, and under the terms of the Articles of Agreement* concluded at Erzeroum in 1847, the Persians enjoy the right of navigating the Shat-el- Arab from its mouth to the point of contact of the two frontiers.the whole time with me either rifle shooting or talking. He spoke of improvements, and I suggested that he should drain and fill in the swamp at the back of the godown ; he promised, but has not done so. Nothing was said about building anything, and there is not the slightest rumour of any such intention. Some thousands of building stones were ordered from Bushire, but were expressly to be shipped to Basrah. The Pasha dined with me, and not a word was said about Fao. Some years ago it was proposed to buila a small round fort at back of trees, but Sheikh (of Koweit) asked, ‘ What for, there was no necessity,’ and so the idea dropped. This was some six years ago.” 4. Tims the matter rested till 16th December 1885, when the Basrah Consul, Lieutenant-Colonel Mockler, reported that, during a conversation with Admiral Ali Biza Pasha, Governor-General of Basrah, it had come out that the Ottoman Government contemplated building a large fort at Fao at a cost of 93,000h 5. In 1886, the following further information was supplied by Her Majesty’s Consul at Basrah.— “ 1st May.—Orders have been received from the Porte to erect fortifications at Fao at a cost of 180,000/., to be contributed as required from the Pashaliks of Basrah and Bagdad. “17th May.—One hundred and sixty soldiers, under the com mand of Major Kamal Bey, have arrived at Fao with a quantity of building materials for the purpose of commencing the fortifications there. Kamal Bey took a simple letter of introduction from the Wali of Basrah to the Sheikhs of Koweit, who are the proprietors of Pao. The letter did not mention the project of constructing fortifications, or ask for the grant of a site, or offer to purchase one. On arrival Kamal Bey marked out a large extent of river frontage, about 50 acres, which he said would be needful for the fortifications, and summoned all persons owning boats at Fao to meet him. He told them that their boats would be required to convey earth from El Dora, some miles up the river, to the fortifications, and asked them what hire they would want. They replied 20 piastres for 2 tons. He told them he would give 8 piastres for 2 tons, and that, if they did not accept it, their boats would be seized and used without any payment. The Sheikhs of Koweit strongly resent the seizure of their land, which is valuable, and purpose petitioning the Porte against it. 26th May. Mohammed el Sabbah, one of the Koweit Sheikhs, arrived at Basrah to protest against the construction of forti fications on their property at Fao without their consent or compensation being made to them. “ 29th May.—The Wali returned from Fao. He and Sheikh Mohammed el Sabbah failed to come to an understanding about the ground taken for the fortifications, and the latter is petitionin 01 the Porte. * ° ( 13th November. Admiral Ali Riza Pasha, in company with Rafat Pasha, who came down from Bagdad, went in the Turkish river steamer ‘Iunit’ to Fao to inspect construction of forts there. 6* Pending the receipt ol further intelligence the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs' inquired on the 16th April l 00 ”’ ’ ” • - ^ of Yiscount Cross, that Her Majesty’s should be instructed Persian Government to the matter, and'To surest that they should ascertain whether the fortitica- tions were of a nature which would enable the lurks to obstruct the navigation of the Shat-el-Arab. If such should prove to be the case, it would not be desirabl Charge d’Affaires at Tehra to call the attontinn nf +1,Letter from Foreign Olfice, 13th June 1887. H. C., Vol. 94, p. 1557. Mr. Nicolson might be authorised to state that Her Majesty’s Government would be ready to support the representations which the Persian Government would no doubt think it necessary to make at Constantinople on the subject. Viscount Cross concurred in the proposal looking to the importance in the interests of Persia of maintaining free access to Mohammerah from the Persian Gulf. At this time the project for opening up the Karun river and constructing a railway from Ahwaz to Teheran was under consideration. The construction of a fort at Pao was consequently a measure hostile both to British and to Persian interests. Instructions in this sense were accordingly sent to Mr. Nicolson on the 3rd May 1887. 7. The Shah having inquired what was the best mode of proceeding, Mr. Nicolson suggested that the matter should be referred to the Persian Am bassador at Constantinople, who could confer with Sir W. White. The Foreign Olfice, however, telegraphed to Mr. Nicolson on the 13th June that it appeared that, in the event of the Shat-el-Arab being closed, navigation to Mohammerah would still be open by the Bamishir. In view of this, and of the Treaty engagements of the Porte to Persia, it might be unnecessary to raise the question at Constantinople. It -was subsequently ascertained that the Bamishir channel was full of sand-banks and shallows, and, in fact, impracticable. The fortifications at this time were not of a very formidable kind, and the Foreign Office considered it not “ worth while to make a fuss about the fort under the circumstances.” Letter from Foreign Office, dated 6th August 1887. H. C., Vol. 96, p. 467. 8. Before Sir W. White had received the instruc tions sent to him on the 20th July to support the protest of the Shah’s Ambassador at Constantinople, lie had mentioned that Mohsin Khan had been for some time consulting him on the subject of repre sentations to the Sublime Porte regarding the construction of fortifications at Fao, but, as the Ambassador had very little knowledge of the subject, Sir W. White could not give him much assistance, having received no instructions from the Foreign Office. He had, however, urged Mohsin Khan, who was a personal favourite with the Sultan and was about to have an audience with him, to speak to His Imperial Majesty and obtain an Irade to stop the works to which his Government objected. On learning the above, Lord Cross observed that, according to the reports of Colonel Murdoch Smith, the projected fortifications were of a nature to enable the Turkish authorities to obstruct the free navigation of the Shat-el-Arab between Moham merah and the sea, and it was very possible that this might lead to works of a similar nature being constructed by the Persian Government on theopposite bank of the river—a not _ altogether desirable result, considering the great importance of this route in connection with British Indian trade. Lord Cross was, therefore, glad to learn that instructions had been sent to Her Majesty s representative at Constantinople to support the protest which the Persian Ambassador was preparing to address to the Sublime Porte , hut suggested, for Lord Salisbury s consideration, whether it might not be desirable that supple mentary instructions should he issued to Sir ~W. White, directing His Excellency, without awaiting the result of any personal representations which Mohsin Khan might make to the Sultan, to formally intimate to the Turkish Ministers that Her Majesty’s Government could not view with indifference the action taken by the Ottoman Government in this matter. Instructions to this effect were accordingly issued to Sir W. White on the 21st August. 9. His representations were not well received^by the Porte as appears from his report of the 25th August, which is as follows :— “ Said Pasha (Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs) to whom the subject appeared to be very distasteful, observed with much animation, if not irritation, that he did not see on what grounds the two Governments, the British aud the Persian, could fairly dispute the right of a great independent State to erect forts or fortifications on its own territory, adding at the same time that the fort in question, which was but a very insignificant one, was not at all intended to interfere with the free trade and navigation of the river. “ Said Pasha concluded the conversation by stating that he had also been spoken to by the Persian Charge d’Affaires who had invoked in support of his representations the Treaty of Erzeroum of 1847 which he (Said Pasha) wished now to consult together with any other documents which might exist at the Porte, before entering into any further discussion on the subject with the Persian Embassy.” 10. In consequence of this denial by the Porte of the right of Her Majesty’s Government or even of the Persian Government to object to the con struction of a fort at Eao, and of the Turkish contention that it could not be considered as interfering with the free navigation of the Shat-el- Arab, the Foreign Office sent to Sir W. White “ copies of two memoranda relative to the nego- “ tiations connected with the Treaty of Erzeroum “ in 1847,” and stated that the contention of the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs was in direct contradiction with the view held by the Porte in 1847. “ At the time when the Treaty was drafted by the British and Russian Commissioners, who acted as mediators, the Turkish Government objected to the relinquishment to Persia of the Island of El Khyzr, on which a portion of the town of Mohammerah is situated, and only withdrew their objections on the condition that no fortifications should be erected on the Island or at any point where they could interfere with the free navigation of the river. “In March 1848, the Turkish Government submitted to the British Commissioner a proposal for an addition to Article 2 of the Treaty, which they desired should be inserted in the Acts of Ratification,5 T he cW in question contained a formal en-a-ement on the part of the Persian and Turkish Governments“Erolnv to ^ T n ereCtmg . fortlfi cations on the banks of the Sluft-el- Arab in their respective possessions. “ The Turkish negotiators consented to sign the treaty in its original form on receiving an assurance from the British and Russian Commissioners that the wishes of the Porte on these and other points would be supported at Teheran. With some difficulty the British Minister at Teheran obtained the consent of the Shah to this condition as to the non-erection of fortifications and still further pressure had to be used by the BriS S i? Ambassadors at Constantinople before a formal assurance cmdd be ( obtained from the Persian Ambassador on the subject. addrLdto the plrtf tyTtaBrS 3 Tl •‘° VT' ^ on the 26 th February (^hMa^ls^ Poite consented to the ratification of the Treaty whiVW™L- place on the 21st of March following. whlch took “ It follows from the above facts, which are detailed at neater length in the Memorandum which forms the second enclosure of this Despatch that the Turkish and Persian Governments 8 tan d mutually pledged to one another to abstain from fortifvinp- on either side the banks of the Sbat-el-Arab, and that Great 7 Britain and Russia, who were the means of obtaining for the Porte this engagement from the Persian Government, have a directTutere t and right to watch over its faithful observance by the contracting party, on whose behalf they intervened at the time. g “ possible that the Minister for Foreign Affairs tyihv ho unaware of these facts. Or he may, perhaps* argue tlmt^the engagement being a reciprocal one, the Turkish Government have he option of departing from it, with no other consequence thin that of leaving the other party free to do the same. Her Majesty’s Government cannot admit, in view of the history of the S tiation, that such a contention is valid in international law or that the Porte can iree itself from the engagement which it took to the Bntish and Russian mediators, as well as to the Persian Govern ment, without previous arrangement with them. “ And, setting the legal question aside, Her Majesty’s Govern- mei.^ being interested in the integrity both of Persia and the Ottoman Empire, and having regard to the fact that British subjects are largely interested both in the trade of Basrah anl Mohammerah, would greatly regret the construction of opposh o foitiiicntions on either bank of the river, which must constitute a menace to its peaceful navigation, and might, under certain circumstances, become a source of danger to Ihe’maintenance of SniT^rew BriS“° tW0 e0UntrieS ° r e^er of them Enclosure in above. Memorandum on the Negotiations respecting the erection of fortifications on the Shat-el-Arab, in connection with the Ireaty of Erzercum in 1847. h t n at ’ When the Treat y of Erzeroum was drafted by the mediatmg Commissioners (British and Russian) the Porte at first objected to the relinquishment to Persia of the island of El Khyzr, upon which a portion of the town of Mohammerah is situated. ‘ They Ultimately withdrew their objections, on the condition however, that no fortifications should be erected on the island or at any point where they would interfere with the free navigation of the river by Ottoman merchant ships. ‘ Wellesley, in reporting this, observed that if the Porte were willing to make this condition reciprocal, and that if they Sw d i e A ga ? e erect no Ifertifications on the right bank of the hhat-el-Arab, this need not be considered a difficulty. “ The Persian Government had already accepted the Com- missionors Draft Treaty. * 11 “ On the 17th February 1847, Mr. Wellesley sent home a Memoiandum presented by him and his Russian colleague to the lurkish Government. It contained assurances relative to three points in connection with the Treaty, which they understood that Government to require. They related — S. 19. ' B6 “ (1) to the definition of the term ‘ anchorage of Moham- merah ’; “ (2) to the divisions of the tribes and territory occupied by them, &amp;c., mentioned in Article 2 of the Treaty; “ (3) To Government and individual claims. “ Nothing was said as to fortifications ; but in March 1847 the Turkish Government submitted to Mr. Wellesley (with other clauses) an additional clause to Article 2, respecting the non- erection of fortifications by Persia on the left bank of the Shat- el-Arab, or by Turkey on the right bank, which they desired should be inserted in the Acts of Ratification. “ The text of this proposed clause was as follows :— “ { Attendu seulement que I’illustre cour de Perse s’engage ici formellement a ce que jamais il ne soit construit des forti fications d’aucune espece sur ceux des endroits situes sur la rive gauche du Shat-el-Arab qui, comme il est dit plus haut, doivent rester en la possession de la Perse, la Sublime Porte s’engage de son cote aussi a ne construire aucune espece de fortifications sur les cotes de ses terres situes sur la rive droite du fleuve susdit, qui sont vis-a-vis des endroits sus- mentionnes.’ “ Assurances were thereupon given by the British and Russian Ambassadors at Constantinople that the wishes of the Porte would be supported at Teheran. “ The Porte then agreed to the signature of the Treaty as originally drafted; at the same time stating that unless Persia agreed to the assurances given by Great Britain and Russia on the various points raised, Turkey would not ratify the Treaty. “ The Treaty was signed on the 31st May 1847 in the presence of Colonel Williams and Colonel Oairese, the British and Russian mediating Commissioners, and the signature was recorded in a Proces Verbal signed by Colonel Williams. “ The Persian Government at first refused to have anything to do with the assurances given by the British and Russian Representatives at Constantinople, but eventually the Shah informed Colonel Sheil (with reference to the question of the fortifications) that he was willing to declare that, so long as Turkey refrained from fortifying the portion of the Shat-el-Arab opposite to Persia, he would abstain from fortifying the Persian branch. “ When the Persian ratifications of the Treaty arrived at Constantinople, the Persian Ambassador refused to give his adhesion to the assurances given by the British and Russian Ambassadors to the Porte previous to the signature of the Treaty, but after great pressure had been put upon him by the two Ambassadors,—Lord Cowley threatening to break off relations with him,—he signed his adhesion to them, receiving from them in return an assurance that the requirement relating to the forti fications did not include the existing fortifications at Mohammerah. . “ The Porte appearing inclined to delay the ratification of the Treaty, the British and Russian Ambassadors sent in to them a Note recapitulating the assurances previously given by them, to which was annexed a copy of the Persian Ambassador’s declaration alluded to above. “ The ratifications of the Treaty were then exchanged on the 21st March 1848, in the presence of the British and Russian Ambassadors, and the exchange was recorded in a Protocol signed by the Turkish and Persian Plenipotentiaries and by the Am bassadors of the two mediating Powers—Great Britain and Russia. “ It will be seen from this memorandum that although no stipulation with regard to fortifications on the Shat-el-Arab was inserted in the Treaty of Erzeroum (which, however, contained a clause securing to Persia the free navigation of that river), yet the Porte required that such a clause should be added to the ratifications; “ That the Porte, however, ultimately signed the Treaty on i • i receiving from the mediating Powers assurances on the subject * Namely, that the wishes (among others) of the non-construction of fortifications*; should be supported at Teheran “ That the mediating Powers, after great difficulty, obtained from the Persian Plenipotentiary his adhesion to these assurances in the form of a declaration or note;&gt;7 &lt;g) / Turkish Contention, Condition on which it may construct fort. Letter from Foreign Office, 20th January 1888. H. C., Yol. 99, p. 483. y S * Namely, that the wishes of the Porte should be supported at Teheran. 7 “ An(i on this adhesion being communicated to the Porte by the mediating Powers, the ratifications were exchanged ; the mediating Powers being parties to the exchange, and signing the Protocol in which it was recorded.” 11. In answer to the above Memoranda the Porte rejoined that it had the right of constructing the Pao Ports (sic), subject to no other consequence than that of conceding a similar right to the Persian Government. “ Pro Memoria, dated 29th December 1887. “ Le Traite d’Erzeroum de 1848 ne contient aucune clause ayant trait aux fortifications des deux rives du Schatt-el-Arab. Le seul engagement pris porte qu’aussi longtemps que la Turquie ne batira point de fortifications sur la rive droite de ce fleuve, situee vis-a-vis du territoire Persan, la Perse de son coti s abstiendra d en construire sur la partie de la rive gauche qui lui revient selon les dispositions du traite. “ H s ’on suit que si le Gouvernement Imperial eleve des forti fications sur ladite rive, le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste le Schah se trouve evidemment delie lui-meme de son engagement. “ Cette maniere de voir est conforme d’ailleurs a la note collective remise a la Sublime Porte a la date du 9 Mars 1848 par les Ambassadeurs de Russie et d’Angleterre. “ La stipulation susvisee etant falcultative pour le Gouverne ment Imperial, qui ne s’est jamais engage a ne pas elever des fortifications dans les parages en question, il n’y a eu de sa part aucune derogation qui puisse justifier les observations du Gouvernement de Sa Majeste le Schah. “ Telles sont les considerations que le pro memoria remis par 1’Ambassade de Sa Majeste la Reine le 21 Septembre dernier a suggerees a la Sublime Porte, et tout en appreciant 1’esprit amical qui a dicte sa demarche, le Gouvernement Imperial demeure persuade que dans son jugement eclaire le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste Britannique en reconnaitra lui-meme la justesse.” 12. In forwarding this rejoinder Sir W. White wrote (2nd January 1888) as follows :— “ As your Lordship is aware, the Minister for Foreign Affairs was very much inclined to resent any attempt at interference on our part, and although I am aware of the views of Her Majesty’s Government, I am reluctant to continue a controversial corre spondence with the Porte without positive instructions from your Lordship. “ The chief difficulties in my way are:— “ (1.) The length of time the works have been carried on without giving rise to any spontaneous protest on the part of the Persian Government. “ (2.) The hopelessness, so far as I have the means of judging, of obtaining any support from our co-mediator, Russia. “ (3.) The Government of Persia never moved or showed any interest in this question tiH it was taken up by us, and appeared indifferent; the Ambassador has been kept “ au courant ” by me of every step taken, and His Excellency’s interest has been lately considerably awakened by instructions from Teheran.” 13. It appeared to Lord Salisbury that Her Majesty’s Government had grounds for complaining of the action of the Porte, who, having in 1847 made use of the intervention of Her Majesty’s Government to obtain the consent of Persia to a reciprocal engagement that neither party should erect forti fications on the banks of the Shat-el-Arab, had then, without giving notice of the termination of this agreement, proceeded to build a fort which Her Majesty’s Government had only become aware of from reports from the Agent of the Indo- European Telegraph Company there, and from Her Majesty’s Consul at Basrah.14. But it could scarcely be said, as a matter of strict international right, that Her Majesty s Government were in a position to claim that the fort should be demolished or abandoned, and as the Porte was almost certain to suspect some hidden design if the British Government took too prominent a part in the discussion, Lord Salisbury proposed to instruct Sir W. White to drop the controversy until the Persian Government took the matter up. Meanwhile the construction of the fort was progressing. The earthworks of the enceinte were completed, a high inner rampart wall and quarters for the garrison were begun, and guns were expected from Constantinople. 15. In January 1888, the Persian Ambassador Persia protests against erection presented a note to the Porte, in which he protested of fort. against the erection of a fort at Pao as being Letter from Foreign Office, 28th February contrary to the Treaty engagements, and demanded 1888 - H - c -&gt; Vo1 - 100 &gt; P- 33 - its demolition. Sir W. White was authorized to give his Persian colleague such support in the matter as he thought judicious. 16. In that year the Government of India ■^ or * Colonel forwarded a Report by Colonel M. S. Bell, on the ‘ ‘ e ' position of the Pao Port and the effect of the l8 g tter from India No * 82 &gt; dated 26th Ma y entrance to the Karun being commanded by it, from which the following extracts are taken :— “ The fort being constructed at Fao is a Jlettr d’eau on the right bank of the river Shat-ul-Arab, 6,800 yards below the Fao telegraph buildings, three miles above the Fao inner buoy, and over 30 miles from Muhammerah. “ On the river side is a parapet 4' high and 6|' thick at the level of the crest. It is said that a high inner rampart and quarters for its garrison of brick are being built. “ Half a mile below the fort the channel narrows, and the deepest water is on the Turkish side. The width of river at fort is 1,500 yards. The front face of the fort measures 673', rear face 787', side faces 626'; along front face, seven heavy guns can be mounted to fire straight across the channel ; along the down stream side face, six heavy guns can be brought to bear upon the channel. At high tides the river washes the front face of the work (tide recedes 250 yards at low-water). On either side are creeks 90 and 60 yards wide respectively; to the rear, at a distance of 2,000 yards, is a bund or sea wall, behind which lies an extensive mud flat at times covered at high-water; the ground to the rear of the fort can be inundated. It is supposed that 13 guns (12-ton) placed as noted will be mounted in the fort. The position is strong against a land attack, and if it be armed as stated, will be too strong for our Persian Gulf gun-boats. It commands the main river channel across and down-stream as already noted.” “ The description given of the Shat-ul-Arab from the bar to Muhammerah will serve to indicate that the fort is not built as an express menace to the town of Muhammerah, and therefore as a direct menace to Persia. It is 30 miles below Muhammerah. “ This it was meant to point out by Intelligence Branch notes on the case of 23rd September and 19th October. By them it was desired to indicate that the menace was thought to be primarily directed against Great Britain and not Persia, i.e., that it was a continuation by the Turks of their hitherto fruitless endeavours to get the river traffic into their own hands, and to compel the withdrawal of Lynch’s boats from the Tigris ; a river which the Turks hold that British boats have no right to navigate, permission having been given by them to navigate the Euphrates and not the Tigris. # “ The diplomatic history of this disagreement is not in this office, and I refer to it as the cause of the building of the fort only25 (See also Report on the construction of the Turkish Fort at Fao (April and Sep tember 1888), dated Simla, 1st December 1888.) Government of India consider erection of fort prejudicial to British interests. Her Majesty’s Government ad dress remonstrance to Porte. 9 Letter to Foreign Office, 27th June 1888. H. C., Vol. 102, p. 541. (Foreign Office to Sir II. D. Wolff, dated 11th July 1888. See II. C. Vol. 102, p. 1293.) as the generally received opinion in local unofficial circles. Its construction can, I think, have but one object, i.e., that stated above and apparently well known, and an opinion which is strengthened when taken in conjunction with the threat of the Turkish Admiral at Basrah some few years ago to fire upon Lynch’s river boats, a threat which he was only dissuaded from carrying out apparently by the astuteness of Captain Ramsay, then Political Officer at Basrah, who pointed out to him the anomaly of the Wall of Baghdad ordering him to blow the river steamers out of the water when it was equally in his own power to have done so himself at Baghdad. The consideration that Turkey is a bankrupt nation and its Mesopotamian walayats in want of funds but (sic) confirm this opinion. “ Doubtless on the first favourable opportunity the Turks will again call in question Britain’s right to navigate the Tigris, and endeavour to enforce their opinion by blocking access to it even as low down as Fao.” 17. In transmitting this report the Government of India wrote,— “Your Lordship will observe that the Fort commands the main channel of the Shat-ul-Arab, and will enable the Turks to block, at least temporarily, all access to the Tigris. It Avill further give to the Turks the command of the traffic to Muhammerah, and thereby control British trade with Mesopotamia and Arabistan. “We are of opinion that the erection of the Fort is prejudicial to British interests ; and if Her Majesty’s Government do not feel themselves in a position to demand that it should be demolished or abandoned, we would at least recommend that strong support should be given to any similar demands made by the Government of His Majesty the Shah of Persia.” 18. And Lord Cross, in forwarding tliis communi cation to the Foreign Office, expressed doubts whether— “ in existing circumstances diplomatic protests on the part of the Shah against the construction of this fort would be effectual even if supported by Her Majesty’s Government, but if the Marquis of Salisbury should deem it opportune to press the Persian Government to take active steps at Constantinople with the object of inducing the Sultan to abandon the construction of this fort as menacing the approach to the Persian town of Mohammerah, Lord Cross would entirely concur in such a course.” 19. It appeared to Lord Salisbury impossible to allow the construction of the fort to be persisted iu without serious remonstrance and a warning of the maimer in which it was regarded by Her Majesty s Government Sir W. White was accordingly authorised to present the following Memorandum to the Porte, and, if he thought it desirable, to take measures to bring its contents to the know ledge of the Sultan, llather than leave the matter to be discussed by the Persian Government and to support their representations, the Marquis of Salis bury thought it desirable to remonstrate again directly with the Porte. H. C., Vol. 102, p. 1139. “ Memorandum. “ Her Majesty’s Government desire again to call the serious attention of the Sublime Porte to the objections which they have already urged to the erection of a fort at the mouth of the Shat-el- Arab, near Fao. “ According to the latest accounts which have reached them, this fort has now nearly been completed, and is so placed as to command the deepest part of the channel, so that when armed it will have the power of completely closing the navigation for sea going merchant vessels to Basrah and Mohainmerah. Ihe treaty between Turkey and Persia, signed at Frzeroum on the 19/31st May 1847, contains in Article II. the following engagement on the10 part of the Sublime PorteOutre cela, les navires Persans ‘ auront le droit do naviguer en pleine liberte sur le Schatt- ‘ el-Arab, depuis I’endroit ou ce fleuve se jette dans la mer ‘ jusqu’au point de contact des frontieres des deux parties. 5 “ But before consenting to ratify the treaty, the Turkish Ministers required certain further assurances from the Persian Gorernment one of which was to the effect that neither party should erect any fortifications on the banks of the Shat-ul-Arab where the possessions of the two States were opposite to one another. These assurances were obtained with great difficulty by the exertions of the British and Kussian Representatives at Teheran. The Turkish Ministers desired that the assurances should be confirmed by Great Britain and Russia as the mediatory Powers, and to satisfy this desire a joint Note was addressed to the Sublime Porte by the British and Russian Representatives at Constantinople on the 26th February (9th March) 1848, which contains the following passage:— ° “ ‘ La declaration de 1 Envoye Persan enonce enfin, quant a la defense reciproque de batir des fortifications sur les cotes du Shatt-ul-Arab ou les possessions des deux Etats se trouvent opposees les unes aux autres, une resolution ou Schah, pleineinent conforme an desir exprime par la Sublime Porte et appuve a Teheran par les bons offices des deux Representants mediateurs, c’est-a-dire que le Schah consent a ce qu’aussi longtemps que la Turquie ne batira point de fortifications sur la rive droite du Shatt-ul-Arab, situee vis-a-vis du territoire Persan, la Perse a son tour s’abstiendra d’en construire sur la partie de la rive gauche qui lui revient selon les stipulations du Traite. 5 b “Having been thus instrumental in obtaining this reciprocal engagement, and having themselves confirmed and endorsed it at the express wish of the Turkish negotiators, Her Majesty’s Government consider that they were entitled to expect on grounds of courtesy, and indeed of international obligation, some previous announcement from the Sublime Porte of its intention to depart from the arrangement. ^ “It has been argued by the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs that the erection of this fort is not a breach of any absolute engagement, but that the effect of this measure is merely to leave the Persian Government free to erect similar fortifications on its side of the river. It is undoubtedly true that the Persian Govern ment have the means of erecting fortifications on the left bank of the river in their possession which would obstruct completely the navigation of the river upwards toward the Tigris and Euphrates. And for any power which desired to see Turkey and Persia in antagonism, or to make use of Persian assistance or 1 ersian tenitory in fuithcrance of aggressive designs against the Ottoman Empire, such a solution would not be an unsatisfactory one. J “But Great Britain has no such designs; her interest is in the peaceful development of trade with the' districts on the banks of the Shatt-el-Arab and of the several rivers which debouch into it and in fact by far the largest proportion of sea-going vessels which ascend the river to Basrah and Mohammerah are under the British flag. “ Her Majesty’s Government are not aware of any circumstances in the present relations between Turkey and Persia which can be held to call for the construction of the fort at Fao as a measure of necessaiy precaution, and according to the reports which have leached them, the fort is so situated as to constitute in the existin (r state of things, a menace, not so much to Persia as to the British commerce frequenting the river. “ Her Majesty’s Government cannot therefore regard the con struction of the fort as undertaken otherwise than with a view to possible hostile action against British interests. They trust that the Sublime Porte may be induced, on reconsideration, to o-ive orders for its demolition or abandonment. But they think it rmht to warn the Sublime Porte distinctly and emphatically that if the fort is completed and steps are taken towards arming it, they will regard this action as one of hostile preparation which they will be entitled to i esent and to take the necessary measures for counteracting.” 20 - ^ Memorandum to the same effect was Letter from Foreign Oificej 7th August supplied by the Foreign Office to the Turkish Ambassador (Rustem Pasha) at his request.Letter from Foreign Office, 4th September 1888. H. C., Vol. 104, page 209. . L Turkish attitude on the Fao question. om Foreign Office* 7tli August 11 21. On receipt of these instructions, Sir W. White wrote:— ‘‘I got a Turkish translation carefully made of the said Memorandum, a copy of which I instructed Sir A. Sandison to deliver to the Grand Vizier. His Highness, after having taken some days to study it expressed, I am sorry to say, subsequently, an opinion less favour able to our demand than the one he has stated on previous occasions- whilst the Minister for Foreign Affairs had become in the mean time more open to entertain these (objections ?) on our part especially on learning the serious consequences of a refusal on the part of the Imperial Government. ‘ I continued to urge on the Grand Vizier the representations i was instructed to make by your Lordship, when I suddenly learned that this controversy so uselessly raised by the Turkish War Department had reached the Sultan’s ears. ' His Majesty then ga\e orders that all the documents should be submitted to himself pending any further decision, and the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs declared himself unable to do anything before receiving his Imperial Majesty’s commands. “ On the 9th instant I forwarded to the Sultan’s First Secretary, m lurkish, a copy of the above-named Memorandum, and also of the 1 ersian Note addressed to my predecessor and to the Russian Ambassador on the 31st January 1848, as bearing upon this point, so as to leave no doubt whatever in the Imperial mind of the importance of his decision as affecting the future relations of England and Turkey. “ Ihe question of Massowah and financial complications may probably have occasioned His Imperial Majesty to delay studying the subject, and I propose immediately after the Bairam holidays to resume urgently pressing this question. “ I cannot, however, refrain from stating to your Lordship very confidentially that M. de Nelidoff has been working in a sense hostile to our demands, both at the Palace Avith the War Minister, and even indirectly with the Persian Ambassador. “I beg likewise to forward to your Lordship translations of a Note addressed by the Porte on the 31st ultimo to the Persian Ambassador here, and of an article which appeared in the ‘ Tarik ’ newspaper of the 2nd instant, with reference to this question, and which both show sufficiently the animus which inspires them and the obstacles with which we have to contend.” “ Copy of a Note addressed ify the Turkish Foreign Office to the Persian Embassy. “ We have perused your Note of reply stating that the con struction of fortifications at Fao is contrary to the decision arrived at when the Treaty of Erzeroum was concluded, viz., that no fortifications should be made on the banks of the Shat-el-Arab, and declaring that any modification of this decision must be subject to the consent of the mediating Powers. It is needless to explain that the agreement arrived at on this subject was not a reciprocal undertaking, but Turkey at that time in her own interests reserved to her own initiation the right of constructing fortifications on those banks, and brought about the engagement that so long as Turkey should not fortify the right bank of the river, Persia should abstain from building forts on her (the left) bank. Now that Turkey has had forts made, Persia is released from her engagement, and is also free to construct forts on her own ground and has no right to object. And this agreement being between the two Governments, there is no kind of engage ment vis-a-vis the mediating Powers, and the two Governments aforesaid are not dependent on their consent, and the construction of these works is no violation of any treaty between the two countries.” Translation. “‘Tarik,’ Thursday, 2nd August 1888. “ The ‘ Tarik,’ referring to the statement which appeared in the ‘ Standard ’ that England had made representations to Turkey with regard to fortifications which are being constructed at the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab by the 6th Army Corps, remarks that it has no official information on the subject, but that it considers the statement in question as to the construction of important forts at that point must be exaggerated.12 if Should it, however, be correct, the question of how such a step is a violation of any treaty between Turkey arid Persia surely belongs to those two countries to decide, and Jin gland s interference in the matter, while causing surprise, can only be explained on the supposition that she is seeking to acquire influence on the Shat-el-Arab and in the Gulf ol Basrah a proceeding which is, however, contrary to England’s established policy.” 22. The Turkish Ambassador, haying made no communication to the Foreign. Office respecting Fao, was asked if he had instructions to present a Memorandum on the subject. He said that lie had no formal instructions, hut had been privately told to give explanations and assurances to Her Majesty’s Government. They were to the effect that the intentions of the Porte were far from being hostile to any one, and that there would be no interference with the navigation of the Shat-el-Arab. But His Excellency could give no explanation of the object with which the fort was being built. Rustem Pasha was warned that unless ^ an assurance that the works were stopped was given to Her Majesty’s Government, ships from the Zanzibar squadron would be sent up to see what was going on, and that under no circumstances would guns be allowed to be landed at the fort.

White wrote:— “ I have come to the conviction that it is a question on which the Ottoman Ministers who constitute the Sublime Porte, with the exception of the Minister for War, are entirely powerless, and that the matter rests with the Sultan with whom are all the papers. “ As regards the present Seraskier or Minister for War, it is not unlikely that he has some secret personal interest in these costly constructions. “ As I have some reason to believe that Russian partizaus have represented here that in reality the Shah himself entertains no serious objections to these Fao fortifications, but that it is only Great Britain that has some selfish motive to prevent those fortifications, I have been constantly pressing Mohsin Khan, the Persian Ambassador, to urge the Sublime Porte on the subject; and seeing how unavailing all these repeated representations to Ottoman Ministers proved to be, I suggested to my Persian colleague to place in the Sultan’s hands a short Turkish memo randum which I got drawn up for His Excellency on the subject, and of which I promised also to send a copy to the Palace after he had done so. “ After considerable delay His Excellency had the honour of dining with the Sultan on Monday the 25th instant, and got His Imperial Majesty’s permission to send a memorandum on the next day, which he did, and which was followed by an exactly similar memorandum (also in Turkish), given on the next day by Sirmi s Sn d to°?he n sZ n bCha ' f ^ PMha '° r rM l , « tW ™ b - r ‘r 0 ’’; ,0 “'f 10 , 86 ,he *«t »f that memo- randum, and I have forwarded a copy of the present Desnatch and of the enclosure to Sir H.

In July 1893* it was reported that work had been resumed under Military Engineer officers, and that 80 men were employed, presumably on earthwoiks, as masons had not been sent from Basrah. Portions of the site were said to have subsided. 27. Acting in accordance with instructions from the Foreign Office, Mr. Nicolson, Her Majesty’s Charge d’Alfaires at Constantinople,— “ called upon the Foreign Minister and left with him a Pro Memona renewing the remonstrances and warnings formerly made by Her Majesty’s Government in regard to the construction of the Fort at Fao. Said Pasha, in accepting the Pro Memoria said that it should not be imagined that the fort was intended as a menace to British commerce, and he could not conceive the possibility of Ottoman guns ever being turned against British merchant ships. I said I presumed the fort was constructed with some object, and I could not think of any other object than the one which had been mentioned in the Pro Memoria. If the fort was constructed without an object, there could be no difficulty at all in ceasing further work upon it. His Excellency said that he would tell me privately, but not as Foreign Minister, that the fort was built solely with the object of putting money into the pockets of the Minister of War, and that he himself would have preferred to see the expenditure laid out more usefully in the defences of the Bosphorus. He begged me not to repeat these observations on his part, as, if they were brought up against him, he would be compelled to deny them. ' “ Said Pasha is clearly opposed to the continuance of the works at Fho, and it is to be hoped that the Pro Memoria will strengthen his hands in obtaining a definite abandonment of the project. “ Pro Memoria. Information has reached Her Majesty’s Embassy that further activity is being shown towards the completion of the works at the Fort at Fao; and in accordance with instructions from Her Majesty’s Government, Her Majesty’s Embassy desires to call the very serious attention of the Sublime Porte to the above report. Should it be correct that fresh measures are being taken towards S. 19, D14 completing the construction of the Fort at Fao, Her Majesty’s Embassy must recall to the serious consideration of the Sublime Porte the representations which were formerly made to the Ottoman Government on the subject, and especially to the Memo randum which was communicated by the late Sir W. White to the Grand Vizier in August 1888. Her Majesty’s Embassy desires to review the remonstrances which were set forth at length in that Memorandum against the completion and arming of the Fort at Fao, and to impress strongly on the Sublime Porte the view of Her Majesty’s Government, that this fort will constitute a menace to the British sea-going commerce frequenting the Shat-el-Arab. Her Majesty’s Embassy hopes that the Sublime Porte will give orders for the prompt discontinuance of the work in question; for should the fort be completed, and steps be taken towards arming it, Her Majesty’s Government will regard that action as one of hostile preparation, which they will be entitled to resent, and which they will be justified in taking the necessary measures to counteract.” 28. Her Majesty’s Government continued to press for the discontinuance of the works at Fao. On the 19th November 1893, Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople (Sir C. Ford) wrote:— “ I spoke to His Highness (the Grand Vizier) on the subject of the works which were reported to be going on at the Fao forts, and I expressed the hope that the proper instructions might be sent at once to the Turkish Authorities there that they might be discontinued. “ I pointed out to His Highness a fact of which he appeared to have been entirely ignorant, or to have lost sight of, namely, that in the year 1847 an urgent request had been addressed by the lurkish Government to the Mediating Powers, Great Britain and Russia, that as a condition to their ratifying the Treaty of Erzeroum it should be established that the Persian Government should on no account raise fortresses on their side of the Shat- el-Arab river, the prohibition to apply equally to the Turkish Government. randum on the point, which I read to him, and as he expressed iMlesire to that effect, 1 have supplied His Highness with a copy infirm ww. n iGr- • l J xiurusuip s inior- mation. The Grand Vizier gave me to understand that orders would be given for the works at the fort to be discontinued.” “ In 1847 the Porte were afraid of the Persians erecting forti fications on the Shat-el-Arab, and proposed to Mr. Wellesley to insert m the Treaty of Erzeroum a clause forbidding them to do so, and containing the following declaration aucune espece de forUficatfonf sur Ts tbtesTses WrreTsIt'ules Ultimately, the lurkish delegates consented to siyn th Treaty in its original form, on receiving an assurance that Great Britain nn.l Russia would support tlie wishes of the Porte at lehran hut on 3rd (16th) May 1847 a note was sen' To lie Majesty s Embassy, saying that the Porte would only rat fy the ireaty o„ condition that the Persian Court ‘ n’eleye™ oucune pretention contraire a ces assuring ’ z,-„ fi eieveKl aucune the assurances already given amieved T . ? ra^P'Mating by the Persian AmbaaLZ ’ ° Whlch ™ » ^laration In other words, the Porte onlv fUn '■p that Persia agreed to erect no fortihV ii r on condition seen by the Sraft of Si &lt; T“ a °“ &lt;« implied that Turkey agreed to erect f ™ as P ro P osed to insert) shore.” 7 fc eCt no for t , bcations on the opposite Letter from Foreign Office, dated 4tli December 1893, Vol. 145, p. 803. v f * i 416 1894.

Currie thought the despatch of a man-of-war might be delayed. Letter from Foreign Office, diited 2Gth May 1897. H. C., 1931. 32. The British Consular Agent at Pao has recently heard that the Turks contemplate im provements at Pao. Writing on the 9th April he says :— 1 ' -n! ^ S « everal iurkl8h military officers arrived herein bneith Yusufs steam launch, and early this mornhm pro ceeded to the Fao Fort. So far I have not been able to °obtain any reliable information as to their intentions, but I hear that the Turks contemplate improvements at the Fort. . “ The number of Turkish soldiers at Fao have to some extent increased lately. This may be due to the fact that the Mudir is a mihtary main This increase does not in any way incommode il 16 -“/'‘tish subjects at Fao, aud I am glad to inform you that the Turkish Mudir, and the Turks in general, are at all times very friendly and the Mudir does everything in his power to make things pleasant for us.” Actual condition of Port. ^ - x/uugms vvepori' on aooun from India to the Mediterranean via Persian Gulf, Baghdad and the Euphra Valley, chapter “ The Wilayats of Baght and Basra,” page 9. * G. 66. Summary. 33 ; The fort seems to have fallen into decay and to be without guns. In a report received here on the 10th June it is said— “ The fort which the Turks commenced to build at Fao has never been finished, no work having been done on it for the last six or seven years ; the walls which were built are already falling into disrepair, there are no guns in it, and the garrison consist's only of some 30 or 40 men.” 34. Thus it has been shown that despite the action of the Porte, which in 1848, with the aid of Her Majesty’s Government, obtained the consent of Persia to a reciprocal engagement that neither Power should erect fortifications on the banks ofthe Shat-el-Arab, and notwithstanding the repeated protests, verbal and written, of the British Government, the Turkish Government has never abandoned the project of constructing a fort at Eao, and at intervals has carried on the works. It is evident from the above narrative that measures other than those which have been adopted in the past, and which have failed, will have to be resorted to if any extension of the works at Fao is to be stayed.
