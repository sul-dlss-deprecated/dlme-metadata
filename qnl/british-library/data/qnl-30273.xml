Letter/ from . to Plonipi I have the honour to refer to your despatch No.730/2/38 of the 22nd December 1938 regarding the proposed closure of the Exchange Post Office at Mirjawa. Apart from the inconvenience which such a procedure would cause us locally, the p($posal is in my opinion open to many objections. In the first case I deprecate handing over responsibility for transporting the mails from Mirjawa to Nok Kundi to the Iranian Ooverrment. If the latter should consent to such an arrangement it could only be for political reasons. They would, for instance, be glad to remove British influence from Mirjawa and mi^it well see in the scheme an excuse for putting forward the ridiculous claim, which has previously been reported from Zahidan, that the true frontier between the two countries lies at I ok Kundi. Blether the Mirjawa office is, or is not removed, it is, I think, essential that the Indian Government should continue to be responsible for the carriage of mia; mails between 1 irjawa and Nok Kundi. 2. It may be true that the post office staff at Mirjawa has now less work than a formerly but the Sub-Postmaster is a not inconsiderable political asset and I should be reluctant to see him moved. He is able to look after British interests on the frontier and is frequently of great assistance in acting as an Interpreter for travellers unacquaMted with Persian who get into difficulties with the Customs there. During the past year he lias been able to settle at least three awkward cases which but for his assistance n?&lt;ght babe given rise to considerable difficulties. 3 . A further consideration is that of the buildin s at present occupied by the post Oifice . These actually belong to the North Western Railway administration. Shoild the Post Office be closed it would be necessary to return these buildings to the Iranian Government and it would of course be quite impossible ever to recover them should it be desired at any time to reopen the Mirjawa Office. 4.

The Persians contend that its functions should he limited solely to the exchange with the Persian Exchange Post Office of closed mails made up hy Indian post offices for Persia and hy Persian post offices for India, and that these hags should not he opened and sorted in the Indian Exchange Post Office. On the other hand the Indian postal authorities reply that in making up closed mails from articles received from various Indian Offices they are acting in accordance with International Postal Regulations. The/ 4475b 1000 5.30The controversy h&amp;s now come to &amp; head, and the Director General, Indian Posts and Telegraphs ^ proposes to inform the Persians that, ii the functions of the Mirjawa Office are restricted in the manner they propose, it will not serve any useful puipo^ as far as India is concerned ana will he closed dovn, unless they agree to its exercising the nonnal functions of an exchange office. In the event of the kirjawa office being abolished, mails between India and East Persia would have to be sent by sea via Karacni. Before taking this step, however, the Government of India (Foreign and Political Department) are consulting H.M. Consul, Sis tan, to see whether in the event of the Mirjawa Office being closed down it would be possible to make satisfactory arrangements for the conveyance of Consular mail bags, which at present pass through the Indian Exchange Office, under the courier system. The present arrangements for the carriage of consular mail bags between India (Nok-Kundi) and Zahidan (Duzdap) are described in paras. 5 and 6 of a letter from the A.G.G., Baluchistan of 18th December last (copy attached), and the restrictions proposed by the Persiar postal authorities would appear to involve Persian interference with these mails which are carried in the same bags as other registered matter as far as Mirjawa. Between Zahiaan, Sistan and Meshed they are conveyed under a private system arranged by the Consuls themselves. With regard to the “courier system' referred to in the Government of India's letter of 3rd October please see the minute on the attached file (P.Z*4769/32). There appear/Department. appear to be strong objections to the introduction of this system as between the consulates in East Persia and the present unofficial system is much better (vide the letter from the Consul, sistan of 29th March - P.Z.3037/32 in the attached file), but in the event of the Mirjawa office being closed down it is just possible that satisfactory arrangements might be made with the Persians for a courier between Zahiaan and Quetta without disturbing the present system as between the consulates. -ft 1 4 (k L*v\, ca fi*-o t / / * i h tfD b Lt^^jcU ^ &amp;Lo?jC^iL ’Tv^c+^xr' ^ ^ bymammmmammmmmm \s) Translation f*4n a latter from Mi 9 121 rector 'i •' * ,&gt;1 &amp;£*** A General, Poota f Persia f »o.

The Special Consular Mail bags from India to East Persia are enclosed with other Registered matter in large sealed mail bags which are specially pointed out to the Chagai Levy Escort on the Mail L^rry which takes over the Mails at Nok Kundi Post Office each Tuesday morning. The Mail Lorry travels with this escort to Mirjawa and delivers its load direct into the Indian Exchange Post Office where it is sorted according to the Indian Exchange Post Office Manual. The Special Bags are delivered by the Indian Exchange Post Master to the representative of the Vice Consul, Zahidan. This takes nlace in the Indian Exchange Post Office, where the Mirjawa Persian Post Master is present at the time of sorting, the latter affixing his arrival date stamp. The Special Bags are olaced in a large mail bag which is locked and despatchedto Zahidan by Consular Courier. This courier travels to Zahidan on the mail lorry and delivers his bag to the Vice Consul that same evening. The sealed Mail Bags from Persia to India are prepared in the Zahidan Vice Consulate on Tuesdays. They are sealed and stamped ready for registration, and are carried to Mirjawa by the Consular courier on the mail lorry which leaves Zahidan during Tuesday/Wednesday night. At Mirjawa these bags are taken to the Persian Post Office and registered, and accompanied by the Consular Courier to the Indian Exchange Post Office where they are includedincluded in the Registered Mail hags end despatched in charge of the Levy escort. Thus the Special Bags do not remain for any length of time in Persian Postal hands. Bags for Persia are not touched Ly Persian Postal authorities (except for affixing date stamp in Indian Exchange Post Office) and bags from Persia are not unattended during the short period of half an hour occupied by their registration at Mirjav/a Post Office and their transfer inside sealed outer bags from the Persian to the Indian Exchange Post Office. 6. As fan* as the safety of the mails is concerned it is thus immaterial who drives the Postal lorries as the Soecial Bags are continuously under the special super vision and charge of the Levy escort and the Consular courier. Further, a regular system of passport control has now been introduced at Nok Kundi and drivers on the Mirjawa-Kundi line are required to obtain special visas from our representative in Duzdap. The chances of the Consular Mails being tampered with between Nok Kundi and Duzdap are therefore remote.FILE COPY ^4 (Oopy to InalA Q^^icti ana Tehran j* 9 AUG 193i 2 ^ Copy of a letter Ko. 297 fM/Sl, aatea aimla, tne 14th July 19o2 f froa the Deputy director General# Inalan Posts and Telegraphs ^apartment# to the Direotor General oP Posts, Toheran, Persia* ^ *»ith referanoe to the conr&amp;sponaence ending with your letter dated the 13th February 1932# Ko* 14052# 1 sm directed to state that the Indian OPPice of exchange at lirjawa in taxing up a olosed ^ail Por the Persian OPPice oP Exchange with the articles received Prom various Indian ofPioes is acting in oonPonuity with cirtiole 2 oP the Detailed Regulations of the Universal Postal Convention.

All mails originating in India for East Persia are consigned 'by the post offices in India to the Indian office at Mirjawa which prepares hags for the local Persian Office in accordance with International Postal Regulations. Similarly the Indisui office of exchange at Mirjawa receives from the local Persian office mails closed hy the Persian office of exchange at Zahedan. The position of the Indian office at Mirjawa is the same as that of the former Indian office at Duzdap (Zahedan)* In other words* it will not accept from the public in Mirjawa any article for transmission by post or effect delivery of postal articles addressed to Mirjawa. Instructions in the matter are being issued to the postal officials concerned. 2. With regard to the last paragraph of your letter citedj I am to say that the expression M existing arrange ments'* mentioned in this office telegram dated the 24th August 1931 referred to the location of the Indian office of exchange at Mirjawa instead of at Zahedan.

A similar arrangement has already been proposed to the Persian Government in respect of correspondence between the Foreign Office and the Tehran Legation, and iifc is proposed to accept the Forei^i Office offer to asK His Majesty^ Minister to propose to the Persian Government, on behalf of the Government of India, the conclusion of such an agreement. This seems preferable to the Government of India’s suggestion that they should ask the Minister themselves* J.C.Uorthcott, 17th May* We have been for some time expecting that the Persian Government would raise difficulties about the trananission of correspondence to and from the Tehran ion direct (see the correspondence at P.6141/28). The existing arrangements for transmission of correspondence between India and the Consul-General at Meshed (see his letter of 33nd December 1938 at P.2120/29/P.2120/29 p*5) were also liable to be called in question. Now that this has occurred (as explained in the correspondence at P.2544/29), and the Government of India are themselves willing to have a reciprocal arrangement with Persia providing for the transmission of the official correspondence of both countries with their Consular officers direct without customs examination (see their telegram of 6th May P.3260) we can accept the proposal of the Foreign Office that they should instruct Sir R.Clive to propose at Tehran an agreement in this sense, i.e. on the lines of the exchange of notes as regards the mails of the two Legations which he was instructed (P.6141/28) to propse in November 1928# A draft letter to Foreign Office and draft telegram to Government of India are submitted.

It is clear that the transmission of sealed bags to His Majesty’s Consular officers in Persia by means other than the ordinary post or official courier constitutes a violation of the postal monopoly which cannot be justified under international law, and which might place His Majesty’s Government in a difficult position, if the Persian Government took active steps to prevent the delivery of bags transmitted in an irregular manner. Furthermore it appears likely that the Persian Government in the future will refuse to tolerate the continuance of this procedure® 3. Somewhat similar arrangements for the transmission of official consular correspondence towhich the Persian Government have now objected, have in the past also been employed in connection with the transmission of diplomatic correspondence to His Majesty’s Missions in South America and also at Tehran. Objections to the arrangements were recently raised by certain South American Governments, rnd as it was important that the transmission of the correspondence should continue, thematter was, with the concurrence of the Postmaster-General and the Board of Customs, arranged by the conclusion of reciprocal, agreements with the Governments concerned* 4. The Persian Government have also recently objected to the arrangements in use in the case of His Majesty’s The Under Secretary of State, Mission/ India Office.Mission at Tehran and His Majesty^ Charge d f Affaires has proposed a similar agreement to them also* A copy of the draft note, which was sent to Mr.Parr for presentationjWas sent to the India Office in Foreign Office letter No*T.12333/ 30/373 of November 15th last, and a further copy is enclosed herein for convenience of reference. No reply has as yet been received. You will observe that a special clause has been inserted in the first paragraph of the note,the acceptance of which will ensure that the conclusion of the proposed agreement in regard to the method of transmission will in no way affect existing customs procedure under which the usual privileged treatment in respect of exemption from customs examination shall be enjoyed. This will enable the Customs authorities to detain if necessary for examination in the presence of the addressee a bag, the contents of which are clearly not merely official despatches* 5. It appears to Sir Austen Chamberlain that an agreement on similar lines providing for the transmission of consular correspondence between the Government of India and His Majesty’s Consuls in Persia on the one hand and the Persian Government and Persian Consuls in India on the other would furnish the best solution of the present difficulty, and I am to enquire whether Viscount Peel would wish His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran to propose to the Persian Government on behalf of the Government of India, the conclusion of such an agreement. It is observed from the correspondence enclosed in your letter No.P.2544 of the 5th April that a suggestion on those lines has already been made to the Government of India by Sir R. Clive in his telegram No.53 of the 20th February* I am, &amp;c*, W.H.Robinson.(T.12333/30/373) November 1928 Your Excellency, By this note I have the honour to propose to Your Excellency an agreement between His Majesty T s Government in Great Britain and the Persian Government for the transmission of diplomatic correspondence between His Majesty’s Legation in Tehran and the Foreign Office, on the one hand, and between the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Persian Legation in London, on the other hand, in special diplomatic bags which shall enjoy the usual privileged treatment in respect of exemption from Customs examination. 2.

Skrine, Esquire, His Majesty^ Consul for.Sistan and Kain, The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Hew Delhi. Mail bags sent to the Indian Pos t Office at Duzdap . Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of letter Ho. D. 4522-H., dated 22nd January 1929 from the Government of India enclosing copies of correspondence between the Indian and Persian Postal Administrations on the above subject. 2. With regard to paragraph l(a) of the Government of India*s letter, I would respectfully point out that the question of the presence of a Persian Customs official at the opening of the mail-bags is not raised in the correspondence between the two Postal Adminis trations. A customs representative has in fact been present at the opening of the mails regularly since October 1927. The words tt afin que les formalites re- quises puissent etre remplies.. • ** in the Persian Director General*s letter of 8th December almost certain ly refer to the formalities connected with the ex change of mails laid down in Part VI Chapter I of the Detailed Regulations attached to the Universal Postal Convention of £8th August 1924. The existing (Indian) Exchange Office at Duzdap has hitherto delivered the mails to, and received them from, the local Persian office without observing the above formalities. 3. -- ' - ' :. mi itfowg3 . It may be surmised that the object of the Persian Postal Administration in demanding that the mail-bags be delivered direct (i.e. unopened) to their office at Luzdap is not so much to prevent smuggling as to bring about the abolition of an Indian post office situated in Persian territory. Obviously, if the mails are to be addressed and de livered direct to the Persian post office, the raison d^tre of the Indian Exchange Office at Duz- dap will disappear. Arrangements will have to be made which will amount in effect to the establishment of two Post Offices of Exchange, an Indian one at Dalbandin or Quetta and a Persian one at Duzdap, in accordance with the practice on international fron tiers in Europe. This will, of course, involve the Persian Administration in considerable additional expense, a much better-trained and more efficient staff than the existing one at Duzdap will be re quired to carry out the requirements of the Universal Postal Convention, and the cost of carrying the mails from the frontier to Duzdap and vice versa , now paid by the Indian Government, will fall upon the Persian Postal Administration. Presumably, however, the latter are prepared to undertake the new responsibilities involved. 4 . The Indian Postal Administration has also for some time past desired for departmental reasons to remove their Exchange Office from Duzdap to Quetta. The question was raised by them in March 1924 and thoroughly threshed out in the correspondence, cited in the margin of this letter, which ensued between the Government of India* His Majesty^ Legation andthis Consulate.

Letter No. 88 , dated 25th March 1925 to the Government of India. Letter No. 52-M. , dated 13th April 1925 from the Government of India. mails by the Persian Post Office have been frequently pointed out by my predecessors. I need only refer to the lengthy representations made by Mr. Gould in his letters Nos. 179 and 309, dated 23rd June and 1st October 1924 respectively, and by Major Fisher in his letter No. 88 , dated 25th March 1925. If the Government of India now consider that on postal grounds the demand for the abolition of the Indian Exchange .Exchange Office at Duzdap cannot be resisted, there is nothing more to be said. Considerable increases, however, will have to be made in the budget grants of Consulates under the head “Postal and Telegranh Charges - . In the first place, additional postage will be payable on outgoing mails which will have to be stamped with Persian stamps at foreign rates instead of with Indian stamps at inland rates. In the second place, the removal of the Indian exchange post office to Dalbandin or Quetta will necessarily involve the abolition of the Indian post and telegraph office at Mirjawa. Considerable sums have been saved to Government in the past by the practice of this Con sulate and the Duzdap Vice Consulate of sending telegrams to Indian addresses by train to Mirjawa for despatch thence ±ss. at Indian inland rates, instead of despatching them through the local I.E.T.D. offices at Krans 2.50 (annas 12) per word. The Mirjawa telegraph office is for similar reasons used very extensively by Indian traders at Duzdap, and there will be much discontent on the part of the latter if it is abolished. 6 . With regard to the carriage of secret and con fidential correspondence, Colonel Biscoe*s suggestion in his telegram Ho. 39-C., dated 14th February 1929 of a special bag for Duzdap would be by far the best solution of the problem. Failing this, secret and con fidential covers could be carried by the Railway Police constable who travels on all trains between Q,ue;.ta and Duzdap. This constable reports himself immediately on arrival at Duzdap to the Trade Assistant and at Quetta to the Superintendent of Police Opetta-Pishin. He has never been interfered with by the Customs authorities, and I have good reason to believe that he would be able to carry a kb reasonable number of covers without the matter being raised officially. Subject to the concurrenceconcurrence of the Superintendent of^B Police, who would have to act as M post office w for such correspondence, I think there would he no difficulty in making the above arrangement. The M&amp;x cover?, as in the Persian Gulf, would be classed as non-postal matter. 7.

At present question of transmission of Consular mails cannot be treated separately from that of location of Indian exchange office which Persian Postal authorities have now raised openly. They have officially informed the Indian Postmaster, Duzdap, that Persian frontier exchange Post Office is about to be transferred to Mirjawa and that the Indian Office will therefore also have to move there. Object is merely to get Indianmm Indian Office away from Duzdap at all costs. It is not necessary to have Indian exchange at Mirjawa and it should be moved to British territory if at all. At any rate secret and confidential mails should on no account go through Persian inland post but should be delivered to and despatched by the Consular Trade Agent, Duzdap. Persian authorities have not objected to existing arrangements for Consular mail inside Persia and I do not think they are likely to do so. This refers to your telegram 1018-S. Telegram P.

Dated 22 MAR. 1823 Received 10 APR. 1328 Proposal for estaolishing insured parcel service between Persia, and t India via Duzdap. K'r H v /p I have the honour to enclose a copy of letter bo. 10, 783/A dated 31st December 1927 from the Superintendent of Post Offices, Baluchistan Division, informing me that the Persian Post Office has raised the question of the establish ment of an insured parcel service between India and Persia via Duzdap and asking for my views. 2. So far as this Consulate is concerned there would be no objection to the establishment of such a service. It would in fact be of considerable benefit for trade, as well as a convenience to the Consulate staff here and also, presumably, at Meshed and Kerman. It would be as well, however to make sure that the Persian Post Office do not use the existence of an insured parcel service, when established, as an argument _ for the removal of the present exchange post office from Duzdap to Mirjawa, and the abolition, of the Indian post office at Mirjawa. As explained by my predecessor in his letter bo. 88 of 25th March 1925 and recognised by the Government of India in their letter to His Majesty’s Minister, Fo.52-M of 13th April 1925, any alteration in the status oi these post offices would be undesirable pending the conclusion of the negotiations regarding the bushki-Buzdap Railway. / 3.3.

Proposal for establishing insured Parcel Service between Persia and India via Buzdap. Memorandum. Sometime before the Railway line was extended from Eushki to Duzdap, the question of introducing insured parcel service between India and Persia by the land route via Duzdap was taken up but it had to be dropped as the mails were conveyed on camels, mules, etc, which means of transit was considered unsafe. After the completion of the railway line, the Persian Postal Authorities moved the matter again but as the service v/as not regular and the post offices on this line were all Field Post Offices, the transmission of insured articles through which was not permissible under the codes of this ‘h'.' ; ■Imb ~ m W' The Persiein Post Office has moved the matter again and now that s- (1) The railway service is regular and the line is safe (2) The mails are conveyed under the charge of the lost Office Mail Guard. (3) The responsibility of the Indian Post Office ceases at Duzdap after delivery of the articles there to the Persian Post Office. and (4) The Persian Post Office takes all responsibility beyond Duzdap. I think that the Indian Post Office may agree to the insured parcel post being established betv/een India and Persi via Duzdap and I request you kxx will kindly let me have your views in the matter at your earliest convenience. This may kindly be treated as urgent.

As the establishment of such a service might possibly endanger the continuance of the present exchange Post Office at Duzdap, the Government of India are of the opinion that it is not advisable that the question should be discussed at present, especially during the present uncertainty regarding the future maintenance of the Duzdap railway extension. The Director General, Posts and Telegraphs is accordingly informing the Director-General of Poets, Persia, that the Indian Post Office is not in a position at present to extend the system of insurance to parcels exchanged with Persia by the land route via Duzdap and the Superintendent of Post Offices, Baluchistan Division, is also being asked not to proceed any further in the matter*3* A copy of this letter is being sent to Hi® llfiajesty’s Minister, Tehran* I hare the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.

Monsieur le Ministre, His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed has drawn my attention to the fact that parcels usually take two months to reach Meshed from Duzdap while the journey might be accomplished in a few days if parcels between these two points were carried in motor lorries. Letters under the existing arrangements, whereby they are carried by camel or cart via Sis tan, also take sixteen days to three weeks to cover the same distance. iiVhere parcels in particular are concerned the delay to which the post is subjected operated to the detriment of trade, and in both cases to the discomfort of private individuals. I therefore venture to hope that Your Excellency will use your influence with the Ministry of Posts in order to hasten the introduction of a motor service for the post between Meshed and Duzdap.

I consider that the conversations which you have been good enough to initiate with M.Pire, combined with the further representations referred to in paragraph ii of your despatch which you propose to make to the Persian Government in concert with your French, Italian and Belgian colleagues, will greatly facilitate the attainment of this project. 3. I presume that detailed negotiations in this connection will now be conducted by the Postal departments of ’Iraq, Syria and Persia in direct communication. I may mention that the ’Iraq Postal Department has already addressed the Syrian Postal Department more than once on the subject of the inauguration of an overland parcel service between Beyrout and Baghdad, but has as yet received no reply. No doubt the knowledge that the Persian Government are also interested in the project will now induce the Syrian authorities toto give the matter their attention. I will inform you in due course of any further developments in this direction. 4 # With regard to M. Fire’s objections to the system of using bags for parcels as stated in paragraph 5 of your despatch, I would observe that Article IX of the Detailed Regulations for the execution of the Madrid Parcel Convention provides that it shall be obligatory to make up closed mails when the number of parcels is such as to hamper the work of an intermediate Administration according to the declaration of that Administration. I understand that the ’Iraq Government are willing to meet the wishes of the Persian Government as far as possible in this respect, but they must retain the right to apply the above provision should At become necessary as a matter of convenience. 5. With regard to the proposed classification of parcels to which you refer in paragraph 9 of your despatch, I understand that the maximum weight for parcels accepted by the ’Iraq Post Office at present is 5 kilos (the maximum provided for under Article 1 of the Universal Postal Convention), but the question of increasing this maximum is under consideration. Correspondence is now passing between the ’Iraq Postal Department and the General Post Office, London, with a view to arranging for a reciprocal exchange of heavy parcelsCB) parcels exceeding 5 kilos or 11 lbs. but not exceeding 20 lbs. in weight. This matter should therefore prove susceptible of arrangement. 6. I observe that M, Pire is sensible of the disadvantages of the H taxe Int4rieure' and that you are hopeful that the Persian Government may agree to a substantial reduction of the tax, You will realise however than an objection to the 'taxe int4rieure w system equal to or greater than the additional charge involved is the delay in the delivery of parcels under this system. This delay, whereby parcels remain for indefinite periods at a posts restante on the frontier, will largely discount the advantage to be derived from the use of the quick overland service. I trust therefore that the Persian Government will care fully consider the possibility of eliminating this delay as well as of reducing the tax itself. 7. I may add that the introduction into ’Iraq of a system of postal insurance, to which reference is made in paragraph 3 of your despatch, is now an accomplished fact. It is limited at present to internal postal traffic, but arrangements for extending it to foreign traffic are already in train. 8. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies, and to His Majesty’s Consul-General, Beyrout. I have, etc., ( Sgd.) H. DOBBS.

O / O Tehran. 7th April, 1925. Sir, In my despatch No .88 of 25th March addressed to His Majesty’s High Commissioner, Baghdad, copy of v/hich was sent to you under cover of my despatch No. 149 of the same date, I reported the intention of the Pex*sian Government to institute e Parcels Post service between this country and Europe vie Soviet Russia. I have since learnt that merchants in Tehran and elsewhere are awaiting this development with impatience and ere at the same time wondering v/hy the same facilities are not being made available via ’Iraq; a route which they would mostly prefer to use, on account of their greater trust in British than in Soviet methods and intentions. You will be aware from my previous despatches of the use to which even the expensive letter post is now* being put for the purpose of bringing merchandise without delay into this country and there can be no doubt of the benefit that a proper parcels post service via 4 Iraq would confer on British as well, as other foreign tra.de were the ’Iraq route available es an alternative to the Soviet route where favour and discrimination are likely to be the order of the day. Moreover the opportunity is likely to occur in the near future of utilising motor-lorries for transport of the parcels post, since in a short time the Persian Govern ment will probably make up its mind to ratify a contract The Right Honourable Austen Chamberlain, M.P., gox e jL/ y , Q&amp;fAog• with Vv/ith the Eastern Transport Company for the carriage of its mails by motor-car in seventy-two hours from raiDhead at Khaneqin (’Iraq) to Tehran and there would be no diffi culty in extending this service to include parcels-post. This system would have to work via Beyrcut and Baghdad in order to compete with the Russian route in the time token between England, France and other Western European countries and Persia; but the two motor-transport companies operating from Beyrout to Baghdad could no doubt be entrusted in equal proportions with this service, thereby making it possible to send either two or four consignments of parcels a week from Europe to Persia; the Persian mail contract providing for three services weekly. I estimate that by this means parcels would be delivered in Tehran within fifteen days of leaving London, whereas the Russian route now takes at least eighteen days and is unreliable, particularly in winter, even for letters. For example no mails were received during one period of the past winter for over four w r eeks. The European Governments concerned w r ou 3 .d, in my opinion, have to fight against a certain amount of reluctance on the part of the Persian Government to agree to this scheme because of certain vested interests which wish to give preference to the Russian route and because Soviet Russia is keenly alive to the benefits which will accrue &gt; to her from having a monopoly of this Parcels post service. But the resultant benefit to ’Iraq s.s v/ell as to British trade would appear to me to make it imperative to take earlye:-:r 3 y steps in the matter if other considerations unknown to me do not miiitate against such action* There is _uither the danger to he considered that if Hamad an in particular is supplied with parcels via Russia, as would he the case at present British trade with that important centre in light and valuable piece-goods would almost certainly he diverted to other countries and particularly to Germany.

As I understand that 'Iraq was not represented at the recent International Postal Congress at titockholm I beg leave to transmit to Your Kxcellenoy the enclosed summary of the obligations undertaken by Persia as the result of the Congress which may be of some interest to 'Iraq. I have personally impressed on the Persian Minister of Posts and Telegraphs the desirability of a punctual fulfilment of these obligations. You will observe that the failure of 'Iraq to adopt the “declared value* system is given as the reason why Persia has hitherto not undertaken this service; and that this difficulty will not arise on the Russian route, the Soviet having accepted the system. inquiry was made of Monsieur Pire, the Belgian official on the Persian Delega tion at the Congress, whether the arrangements mentioned in paragraph 5 of the enclosed memorandum were Intended to exclude any possibility of a parcels post via 9 Iraq between Europe and the worth and west of Persia. He replied that this was not so, the choice of route was left open to the sender; but it would be unable to compete with the Russian route unless it was quicker and cheaper than the Persian Gulf route; this qualification might be obtained by the Beyrout-Baghdad-Khanikin route, which would attract traffic between Persia and &lt;'ranee, Italy, Belgium, the Mediterranean and possibly Great Britain, absorbing probably about 200,000 out of about 500,000 parcels, the estimated yearly total of the paroels traffic. It remained to be seen, however, whether His excellency Sir Henry R.C.

In that case, parcels for and from Keraanshah, Kazaadan and Kurdistan would no doubt be sent by that route. In a recent letter to Hr. Hadow, Mr, Bourdillon suggested that the Persian Administration was guilty of some measure of dishonesty in charging a fee for the deli very of parcels to consignees in Persia besides accepting ite share of the fees paid by the senders abroad. Monsieur Pire having himself spontaneously mentioned the **taxe interieure* i.c, # the fee for transport of a parcel within Persian territory, enquiry was made of him whether this was compatible with Persia^ international obligations. He replied that it certainly was; it was agreed that certain countries, e.g. the Belgian Oongo, where transport was difficult and costly, might charge this fee, which was indeed, necessary. For a parcel sent to Tehran from huropc via Bushire, for instance, Persia received only 75 centimes as her share of the fee encashed by the country of origin, whereas the cost of transport from Bushire to Tehran notually amounted to at least two tomans: it was therefore necessary to charge the consignees accordingly. As he ex plained, parcels from abroad cannot be addressed and deli vered direct to the consignees in Persia: they are addressed to ‘♦Posts Hestante* at the frontier pest, which re-despatches them at the cost of the consignee. It may be that this ex- plains the state of affairs referred to by Mr. Bourdillon.

A -/ Arrangements for disposal of mails for Consulates in East Persia. In .Lorwcnding -herewith a copy of the letter No.2286i dated 12th October 1924, from the Director of Posts, Tehran, to tne Postmaster General,Bombay, I have the nonour to bring to your notice the fact that the presen- practice of dealing with the Consulate mails by the Sub Postmaster Duzdap Indian Office of Exchange has been considered objectionable by the Perr« ^ - S'- cian Government, in as( wmammmmam much as it is a breach of Postal Convention. I have been instructed to put immediately a stop to this prac tice. In order to give postal facilities to the Consu lates and other Government servants in the Persian territory I propose the following alternate procedure. The proposal means no change except in as far that instead of Duzdap Postmaster,the Postmaster l.lirjawa will | deal with the Consulate mails etc. I have considered the matter from all points of view*, and I intend making llirjawa a Sorting Office for the purpose. And for this it will be necessary for you and other Consulates and the Vice Consul and’other Government servants to inform your and their correspond ents to address your and their articles care of the Postmaster Mirjawa. The Postmaster Mirjawa will prepare a special bag for you and your sxfs staff and separate packets for the Kerman and Meshed Consulates, the Vice Consul Duzdap hallway Staff and for the Police servants at Duzdap and enclose them in a sealed transit bag to the address of your Trade Agent at Duzdap. The transit bag will travel under the charge of the Mail Guard. The Trade Agent will receive delivery of the bags from the mail guard at the hailway Station and will dispose of the contents as under. Bag for your Consulate will be handed over to your Sowar. 2. Packets for Kerman and Meshed Consulates will be registered in the Persian Post Office Duzdap by the Trade A gent. 3. Packets for Vice Consul Duzdap, Railway Staff and Police at Duzdap will be made over to their respective orderlies. As to the despatch of mails from your Consulates Special bag should be made up for the Postmaster Kirjaw§i, who will dispose of its contents as if posted in his office, RegisteredRegistered packets from Resiled and Keinan Consulates should be addressed to your Trade agent at Dusdap who will enclose them along with other packets from Railway Police and Railway officials in a transit bag addressed to the Postmaster llirjawa. This transit bag will then be handed over under receipt to the mail guard at the Railway Station. Arrangements will be made to dispose of the mails addressed to and from the Consulates and other Government servants, by the Postmaster Rirjawa by the same train by which they will be received at Mirjawa in order to avoid delay. I am given to understand that the Sub Postmaster Robat,before the war was in receipt of a certain allowance from your Consulate for the similar service as will be rendered by the Postmaster Mirjawa. I hope it will be convenient to you to grant the similar allowance to the Postmaster I.'irjawa. As regards the adjustment of postage account etc., I would suggest that all Consulates should keep sufficient deposit with the Trade Agent Duzdap, who will settle the etc count v.' i th the Pus owas ter Mi r j aw a as under — The Postmaster Mirjawa will prepare a C^alan in duplicate in which he will enter details of postage recoverable or any expenditure incurredby him by way of registration fee etc. Pfe will also forward with this dialan, receipts for XEgix&amp;xaxljm registered articles received iron; Consulate bags etc. , end posted for despatch mo India by his office. The Trade Agent will retain one # copy of the dialan and will return the second copy with the amount due to the Sub Postmaster Mirjawa. This will be ore quickest way to adjust the accounts. I should be ooliged to you if you kindly favour me v itn an expression of your opinion in the matter at a very rcrly uate to enaole me to give effect to this new system. The matter is important from the Postal point of view.A copy of this letter has been sent by me to the consul General^ Meshed and Kerman and Vice Consul husdap for an expression of their osinlon. also .. p * • ! d 6 3 !

Sir, In reply to your letter No. l4955/&amp;-Duzdap dated the 27th January 1925, I have the honour to refer you to the Deputy Secretary, Foreign Departments letter No. 52-M dated 8th December 1924 (copy attached) from which it will be seen that the Government of India have decided not to remove the Exchange station from Duzdap at present. 2. 4s regards alleged breaches of postal convention constituted by the present practice of dealing with Consu late mails at Duzdap, it appears that the report mentioned in the enclosure to your letter as having been received by the Director of Posts, Tehran, was based on a single instance of an irregularity which occurred last September. k letter originating from Meshed and bearing an Indian anna stamp defaced by the Duzdap Exchange Office on August 30th 1924, was received by a Persian in Calcutta, who reported the occurrence. Tn explanation was given to the local Persian authorities on October the 4th last, for transmission to Tehran, and it tfas at the same time explain ed that no letters were poste r ‘ for India at the Indian Exchange Office, where Indian stamps were neither kept nor used, and where no local work of any sort was performed.■ This reply, which coulr? not have reached the Director of Posts, Tehran, before he despatched the letter, a copy of which you enclose, presumably satisfied the autherilies concerned, and, beyond the fact that the question of the removal of the Exchange station from Persian Territory has been discussed in the Persian Press, there has been to my knowledge no further cause of complaint. If, however, the Persian Government have formally objected to the present system of dealing with Consulate mails, their objection, when communicated, will be considered in detail. 3. &amp;ny procedure that is considered by them objectionable at Duzdap will be considered equally objectionable at Lir- jawa, which is also in Persian territory, and your sugges tion of transferring the Exchange office to that station, besides b^ing opp.n to strong objections on political grounds, will afford no remedy for the 'evils it is design*^ li— 3 to remove. 4. For the above reasons I d 0 no think it is necessary at this stage to recapitulate the objections from the point of view of this Consulate to the removal of the Postal Exchange office from railhead. These have formed the subject of considerable correspondence with the Government of India on the part of my predecessor, with whose views on the subject I entirely concur. I have the honour tc be. Sir, Your obedient servant, (Sgd.) G.f. fisher Major, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain.mmmmmmmmmamm / r\ No.18. Sir, /| o f* Q. I Q D O 1925 British Legation, Tehran. 5th February 1925. I have received from His Majesty*s Consul for Seistan and Kain a copy of letter No.52 M., dated 8th December 1924, addressed to him by the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, in which it is stated that it has been decided not to remove the Exchange Post Office from Duzdab, seeing that the Persian Government have not objected to it. You 135? will have since received my despatch Mo.155 of December 27th, forwarding copy of my note to the Persian Government No.342 of that date, from which you will have seen that an objection has in fact been raised by the Persian Government, not only to that office but also to the post office at Mirjawa. It has been shown in the correspondence with your Department that there are objections to the removal of the Exchange Office either to Mirjawa or to Quetta, end I appreciate Mr.Gould’s view that it would be better, if possible, to leave things as they are pending the settle ment of the railway question with the Persian Government. It may not, however, be possible to do so: I do not yet know whether my reply of December 27th has satisfied them on the subject of the Duzdab Office, or whether they are merely waiting for my reply regarding the Mirjawa Office to return to the charge. It is,therefore, desirable that I should be in a position to meet them with a counter-proposal, and. it occurs to me that this might take the form of a sugges tion that the Exchange Office at Duzdab should be a joint The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, H e. 1. h i.joint Perso-Indian concern, which appears to me, on the fac^ of it, a reasonable and natural character for it to assume. I should be glad to learn your views on this sugges tion and to be furnished with any further arguments which may occur to you with a view to convincing the Persian iiovernment of the necessity of the Office at Duzdab. I am also sending a copy of this despatch to Mr. Gould for his observations. In conclusion, I must point out that the above does not deal with the Question of the Indian post office at Mirjawa, and I should be grateful for an early expression of your views on that subject, in case the Persian Government should, as appears probable, again press me for a reply on that point. I am send ing a copy of this despatch to His Majestv T s Consul at Seistan. I I have the honour to be, 3ir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,No.88, ClKO His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate Sistan &amp; Kain. Sistan, 25th March 1S25. From His Britannic Majesty’s Consul fof ^ Sistan and Kain, y 1 o r* o ! I O b o To The Secretary to the Government of-- in the Foreign and Political Department,Delhi. Exchange Post Office at Duzdap. Sir, As desired hy you in your telegram No.286-S of 13th March 1925, I have the honour to forward an expression of my views on the subject matter of the despatch, No.18 of the 5th of February 1925, of H.M’s Minister at Tehran regarding the Exchange Post Office at Duzdap. The exact grounds on which the Persian Government have based their protest to H.M’s Minister against the continued location of an exchange post office at Duzdap have not been communicated to this office. It is assumed that their sense of nationality is disturbed by the situation on Persian soil of a foreign post office, which, together with the Duzdap railway and Passport Officer, serves to commemorate the fact that the functions of Government, which they had ceased to exercise for many years, were, under the stress of circumstances discharged, within their own boundaries, by an outside power. The injury to self esteem in the case of the railway is salved by customs receipts already amounting to over £200,000 a year, with the certainty of more to come. No compensation is being received for the other survivals, and the post office is suspected to be a rival concern interfering with the legitimate profits of the Persian State service. 2, The question of the present Ea status of the exchange office at Duzdap is one of comparatively minor importance whichwhich arises from the fact that we still own and manage British Indian railway in Persia, and it cannot be definite ly and finally settled until the main issues of railway ownership and administration aKd are decided, and the Indo-Persian boundary determined. The question of postal communication and the safe custody of mails will clearly not be one of the least important of the subjects for discussion when a final agreement regard ing the Persian sector of the line is being considered. It may then be possible in the interests of trade, to obtain a concession for special rates for letters posted and delivered in the railway area. Part of Mirjawa station may be within our border. For these and other reasons I think it would be most undesirable for us to abandon the claim we have pegged out at Duzdap, and to make, at this stage, any decisions which might have the appearance of finality and prejudice our interests when the settlement of the larger issues, on which our postal arrangements must ultimately depend, is being resolved. 3. Sir Percy Loraine has expressed his agreement that it is desirable, if possible, to leave things as they are, and suggests that if the Persian Government again press for the removal of the exchange office from Duzdap he should propose a joint Perso-Indian management of the concern. In ray opinion this would probably be accepted by the Persian authorities, but would lead to the very reverse of the result desired and necessitate the premature considera tion of several questions which would be immediately raised by the Persian Staff. This Consulate, since its institution twentyfive years ago, has always employed its own postal sowars, who carry the mails in sealed bags between the exchange office and Sistan. Being independent of the Persian postal service the Sistan Consulate has hitherto enjoyed the privilege of sending and receiving its letters with regularity at Indian inland rates. Besides effecting an economy of four annas on ordinary■BH ordinary letters this arrangement saves at least fortyeight hours on each journey between Sistan and railhead, and the outgoing post can be despatched with the assurance that it will not miss the bi-weekly train, which coula certainly not be relied on if it were entrusted to the rival insti tution which depends on donkey transport for the conveyance of its mails. As has been explained by Mr. Gould, Consulate mails for other destinations are, whenever possible, handed over in sealed bags by the exchange postmaster to responsible persons who happen to be travelling between Birjand,Meshed, and railhead. This procedure saves nearly a month in the return journey to Meshed, and the services of the Persian postal depart ment are consequently utilised as seldom as possible. A proportion of letters received from India for Consulates in East Persia are not stamped at foreign rates. These, when they have to be sent through the Persian post, are handed over by the exchange postmaster to the British Trade Agent, w r ho encloses them in other covers and posts them to their destinations as booked at Duzdap. If the exchange station were removed from railhead, and Consulate bags were made up at Quetta or elsewhere, it is by no means certain that the Persians would agree to their being handled by Consulate carriers; they would probably require an assurance that each cover in the case of an outgoing mail was fully stamped at Persian rates, and they would certainly not go out of their way to expedite the despatch of mails to distant destinations by private motors. As soon as the mail bags are / received from the train at the exchange post office, letters for local traders are immediately sorted and handed over to the Persians for delivery, so enabling the recipients to reply to letters by the next mail which leaves the same day. It is extremely doubtful if the same consideration would be exercised by a Persian sorting office.Cia) If Persians are admitted into the exchange office, as has been suggested, they will not fail to report that the existing procedure is causing a loss to Persian revenues. They will say that every letter coming Into the office insufficiently stamped must pay double the difference (four annas). They will draw attention to the fact that the weight of letters which can be carried in Persia at ordinary rates that is balf^&amp;iiE allowed in India. They will object to insufficiently stamped letters being included in a single cover and rebooked. They will question the right of this Consulate, admitted by the Indian post office, to run its own postal service and pay Indian inland rates for its correspondence. They will require an assurance that each separate letter in the outgoing Consular bags is adequately stamped (five annas for half an ounce), whether the bags are handled by the Persian postal authorities or by private arrangement. They will almost certainly quarrel with the Indian portion of the staff, and continual friction and complaints may be expected. 4. H.M’s Minister has asked to be furnished with further arguments to convince the Persians of the necessity of the Duzdap office. I venture to offer the following suggestions. The Persian Government might be told*that there is precedent for the location of an^exchange office on foreign soil;that the Afghans had one at Peshawar and that the Indian Govern ment have under consideration the proposal of withdrawing the present exchange office to Quetta. In this case would the Persian postal authorities be pre pared to maintain a staff so far from their frontier? Would they undertake responsibility for the safe custody of mails from Quetta to Duzdap? Would they arrange for insurance for parcels between Duzdap and Quetta ? WouldWould it not te better to leave things as they are until the questions of the railway and boundary are determined? Consular Officers have been warned to see that no outside letters are carried in their bags, and the Vice Consul, Duzdap has been directed to exercise supervision over the Duzdap office. If the Persians consider they might occasionally lose a small amount of revenue under existing arrangements, this is quite .negligible when the huge profits they receive from Ehsy the railway, with which the postal arrangements are intimately connected, are taken into consideration. The existing postal arrangements in East Persia are extremely primitive, and what steps would they be prepared to take to maintain an efficient service, vital at a trade centre as important as Duzdap, were the Indian office of exchange to be removed? Have they under consideration the provision of a motor mil service to Birjand and Meshed with an insurance system for parcel post by which silk is largely exported? Such questions as these might effectively postpone any question of removal until it suits our purpose to put the matter on a permanent footing. 5.

I have, etc., Sd/- G.T.Fisher, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and K&amp;in,C!!3) Copy of a letter No. 52-11, dated Simla, the 13th April 1925, from the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, to His Majesty’s 3nvcy Extraordinary and Minister^ Plinigo.t.g^.t i&amp;i'J,, Tehran. I Status of the post offices at Dufcdaj) ^dbl^rjawa I am directed to refer to your letter No. 1C, dated 5th February 1925. p. The Government of India recognise that it will not be possible to resist a demand for the removal of the post offices at Duzdap and Mirjawa if the Persian Govern ment press for it. The Indian Postal Authorities, however, are not in favour of a joint Perso-Indian Sxchan-e Post Office at Duzdap. The dual control in such an arrangement woul^, it is feared, be a fruitful source of controversy. 3. The Exchange Post Office at Duzdap and the Post Office at Mirjawa are almost essential adjuncts to the Mirjawa- -Dusdap Railway an' any change in their status would also j , .- x .. • ^ . cause great inconvenience to Consular Cificers m ^ast Persia and to the Indian trading community at Duzdap and H Mirjawa. 4. For these reasons the Government of India consider it very desirable that this question should be treated with that of the railway and hope that you will be able to persuade the Persian Government to allow the status of the post offices to remain unaltered pending the result of the railway negotiations.moMwm - politioal IlQsident, liusiiire To - Foreign, Dc Ini U L. «-i n 'ir W felagpam - H, No* B4&gt; reed*) 21st February 1925 * (Repeated to Te to n ijo 0 9, ooflF by bag; to KaracM*) p Director, Post, South Persia ms notified R.P.S., ^itichi that he is sending Persian officials to take charge of post offices at Oiiaroai*, Jask and Henjajn« Please see Appendix 6 of import of delegate from India ' V at Dushire Postal Conference«, I have -sked Director foknis reasons ana reminded him that present post offices are located in telegraph buildings ana tmt he will find it difficult in getting accorrmodation elsewhere, he replied that he lias received sanction from Teimn anc tliat he will arrange.

Ohauviaux) already fulfilled the funotiona mentioned and that-the Persian Government Intended to retain his services for a number of years. The situation when I left Tehran in March last was that M* Tire, a comparatively Junior heiglan official, was acting as hlreotor-General in Tehran, while B.Chauviaux bad been got rid of and replaced by a Persian. On ay return to Tehran a month ago I found that there was no longer a single foreign official in the Postal Administration, M* Pire The Eight Honourable Auwten Cbaoiberlai n, Foreign Office*M* Pire hevlnf r«£aained In Europe aLnoe the Stockholm Postal Congress, where he had acted as assistant to the Persian delegate, Fahia-ed-howleh, and there being no apparent intention of recalling him to Persia to resume any duties under the Ministry of Pests* The Minister of Poets is Sardar Assad Bakhtiari, a gentleman doubtless l ossessing many admirable qualities but among which a competent knowledge of postal affairs cannot be included* The Under Secretary of State is Mu*£.hber-ed-lowloh, who has held that post, off and on, for a long period of years and, though hardly a blameless official, has nevertheless an intimate knowledge of the details of the administration even if he does not always use that knowledge to the benefit of the public interest* The 'Wrsian offioial in the South, Miraa hahla /rjowand, is, I believe, an honest and personally meritorious man, but lacking the necessary experience and authority* In the Tehran administration there is a gang of employees, organised into a kind of trade union, with an eye wide open to the main chance and, I fear, with slightly communistic leanings* Another im ortant element in the situation is the serious friction which exists between the ostal adminiatration and the American Adviser* hr* Millspaugh has tried to bring the Postal administration under the Treasury Law which centralises all receipts and expenditure: the Post Office has resisted by every means in its power any serious control by the Ministry of Finance and aja y cur tailment of the practical financial autonomy wnioh it formerly enjoyed* The struggle has developed into a personal one of great bitterness between Jr. Millapaugh,on the one hand, and M. lire a d |fukhber-od-X)owleh # on the other* I recently had a oonYerisation on the subject with i&gt;r. Millspaugb who explained to rae his difficiiltiee in this regard and aeeaed to suggest, for reasons which 1 was and still m unable to fathoia, that this Legation was in aooie way countenancing or backing the recalcitrants in the Ministry of posts and encouraging their resistance to reform or financial control. I did ray best to disabuse Dr. Millspaugh of this ludicrous idea, and assurer* him that the sole desiderata of His Majesty 1 a Gorernraent were that the Persian Governmeaat should ouserve its obligations, and that the postal administration should provide the ^foreign as well as the native public in Persia with an efficient postal service* as regards the Question of applying the treasury Law, that did not concern us; it was a domestic Persian affair, and if Dr* Millapaugh was going to clean the Augean stable of the postal adminis tration, I wished him every success* Thereupon hr* illspaugh said in a rather guarded way that he aid not aim at olacing an American citiaen at the head of the postal adiainistration and would be will satisfied with the en gagement of a Belgian* I said that all we required was the fulfilment by the ersiaii Government of its obligations, adn we did not care who the new Lirector-General was so long as he was a competent foreign official o. sufiicient standing and authority. I have the honour to inform you that, having thus satisfied myself that the situation as regards the postal service was-most unsatisfactory, 1 immediately took up the matter with the Persian Government. I sent a strong messageI aeeoa^e to Kuktobor-ed-jowleb to aay that unless proapt measures were taken there would certainly be a grave scandal as regards the ostal administration, and the brunt of it would unfailingly fell on hla owing to his long and intimate association with that department# I urged him to initiate hiiaaelf a rrogramae of reform and to press for the appointment of a foreign lirector General. 1 took advantage of an interview with Sardar j;seed %o explain to him the miserable state of the sor- vises for which he was responsible, and emphasised the iiaportance of tho lersian Government fulfilling its undertaking to ue, which had better be done spontaneously end without awaiting pressure from outside under which tho Imperial Government would have the appearance of capitulating. To the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the prime Minister I held similar language. The effect produced was, for Persia, almost startling in its rabidity for a resolution was immediately brought before the Council of it ini stars to attention the engagement of a Belgian hireotor General. then I saw the Minister for Foreign Affaire on the 14th instant I again took up the subject. Moehar-ul-l’ulk told me that as a result of the Cabinet discussion the Minister of Posts had been directed to put forward a proposal for the engagement of a high Belgian official for Tehran: the matter would then be taken up either through the Belgian Legation here or through the Persian Minister in Brussels. The question of an inspector General would be left in abeyance until tho new Lireotor General had reached Tehran and reported to the Government in regard to the requirements of the postal services in the south.mmm ^■N I iaey a4cl in oonoluaion \h&amp;% the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been helpful in this matter and that bardar Sepah, when 1 explained to him the true situation, of which he was unaware, a&amp;ii characteristically that as the Persian Government had accepted an obligation, that obligation must be fulfilled.

WITH reference to your despatch No. 471 of the 27th September, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a note addressed by me, before the receipt of your above-mentioned communication, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, with regard to the maintenance of a European or American Director-General of Posts in Tehran. I took the opportunity of the weekly reception at the Foreign Office on the 29th ultimo to discuss the matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who assured me that my note would receive attention and that the Persian Government were determined to carry out their undertaking in this respect. In the afternoon of the same day I impressed upon the Prime Minister the importance of appointing a European director-general, and discussed also the question of a European inspector-general at Bushire. His Highness informed me that it was I the intention of the Persian Government to appoint a Belgian official of high rank and experience to Tehran and a Belgian of lower rank to Bushire. His Highness was under the impression that his Government, had already approached the Belgian Government with regard to the Tehran appointment. My Belgian colleague, M. Gallet, saw the Prime Minister after me, and received a similar assurance with regard to Tehran. With regard, however, to Bushire, he seems I to have been informed that a Belgian official would be appointed “ if the British could prove their claim to such an appointment.” In this connection I would call your attention to Appendix I of the proceedings of the first sitting of the Postal Conference at Bushire on the 5th December, 1922. At that conference the Indian delegate requested the Persian delegate to report on behalf of his administration the assurance given to His Majesty’s Government with regard to the maintenance of a European or American director-general at Tehran and a European or American inspector-general for South Persia. As regards the inspector-general for South Persia, the Persian delegate replied that the then incumbent, M. Chauviaux, had been definitely nominated for a period of years to that port, and he trusted that such action on the part of the Persian Government would be regarded as adequate. M. Chauviaux was dismissed within eighteen months of that assurance and has been replaced by a Persian official, although on the 16th February last the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed this Legation by letter that M. Pire, a Belgian, had been nominated Director of Posts in the south, and his services there would be continued as long as considered expedient. M. Pire did not take up the appointment, having been sent as second Persian delegate to the Stockholm Conference in July. It appears to me that, although we have no more formal undertaking than the above for the continued presence of a European director or inspector-general in South Persia, yet the spirit of the agreement has not been observed by the Persian Government, as the retention of M. Chauviaux for a period of eighteen months is hardly in consonance with the assurance given by the Persian delegate at the Bushire Conference that he was appointed there for a number of years. The Persian delegate to the Bushire conference, who is still in Tehran, informed me a few days ago that he shares my opinion, and that a European director for the south is, in his opinion, essential, as the amount of money order remittances between India and Persia is very considerable and no Persian postal employees really understand the system. I have, &amp;c. ESMOND OYEY.2 Enclosure in No. 1. v/ Mr. Ovey to Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. M. le Minisbre, Tehran, October 11, 1924.

The promise made by his Excellency Zoka-uLMulk in his letter has not yet been fulfilled.

ITo complaint has been received of failure to pay compensation for the loss of an insured parcel. The Postmaster General observes that the schedule of cases enclosed in Hr. Ovey’s Despatch, Ho. 250 of the 16th of Hay last includes only one batch of parcels sent from this Country. There is no record or recollection of any complaint having been received here in respect of these parcels. Reference will, however, be made to the matter in the letter which is about to be sent to the Persian Post Office. The Postmaster General does not think that internal maladministration in the Persian Post Office could properly be raised by the British Delegation at the Postal Union Congress; but a copy of this correspondence is being forwarded to the Head of the British Delegation at Stockholm for his information. It should be added that the British Post Office, The Under Secretary of State while Foreign Officewhile it has made separate arrangements with the Persian Post Office for the exchange of parcels between the United Kingdom and Persia, is not a party to the Postal Union Parcel Post Agreement* I have etc., (Signed) Edwd. A. Prancis.. ——w— mi — —(E 5494/93/34) Ho. Tehran. May 16th 1924. ^ 1 In his Despatch Ho. Overseas Trade (B) 41 of May 7th last, addressed to the Department of Overseas Trade, the Secretary in charge of Commercial Affairs drew attention to the prevailing practice of the Ministry of posts and Telegraphs of accepting parcels for insurance before despatch and subsequently refusing to pay claims which they recognise as valid for loss of such parcels on the ground that the necessary funds have not been voted by the Majlis. The attached representative list of claims by British subjects against the Persian Government on this score, although it does not claim to be complete, will serve to show the delay which is being experienced in this matter, and I have the honour to transmit at the same time copies of a note addressed by Mr. Monson to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject on the 11th March last and of another I have transmitted to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to-day. As I fear that in spite of my above-mentioned note no result is likely to be achieved by these representations. I feel that an excellent case has been made for reporting the matter to the Triennial Conference of the International Postal Union to meet in Stockholm this year which might have the effect of galvanising the Persian Government into action in. The Bight Honourable J. Ramsay MacDonald, M.P•,in view of the fart that non-romplianne would deprive them of the present revenue derived from insurance of parcels if a warning were issued to merchants of present conditions regarding payment of insurance claims in Persia. You will be aware that paragraph 4 of Article 16 of the I'adrid Convention lays down that such claims must be met with all possible despatch and in any case within one year of the loss of the parcel, the responsibility for the loss devolving on the post office concerned if proof of despatch of the parcel can be forwarded by the sender. You may therefore consider it advisable to bring the matter before the Congress which is, I understand, to meet at Stockholm in July and to instruct the British Delegate to raise the question, in such a manner as to threaten Persia with the application of certain sanctions should she not meet such claims promptly and without reference to the Majlis as it * appears to be her duty to do if she accepts liability by accepting fees for the insurance of parcels. The question of the present inefficiency of the parcels post service between Bushire and Tehran which results in parcels taking five months or more to reach the capital in spite of repeated protests by this Legation with consequent serious losses to trade might also, with advantage, be raised at the Congress if you concur, proofs can if necessary be furnished showing that the time mentioned - five months - is the rule rather than the exception to-day in spite of Persian assurances to the contrary, and the Belgian Government would doubtless be glad to cooperate in this matter owing to the recent unjust dismissal of the Belgian head of the Persian Postal Administration and several of his Belgian subordinates since whose departure the inefficiency of the Persian postal Service is becoming more and more marked.

Co py of t ext. Ho. 73. British Legation, Tehran, March 11, 1924. Monsieur le Ministre, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency’s Notes Nos. 20682 of March 3rd (Hoot 13) and 20895 of March 6th (Hoot 16) on the subject of the claims of British subjects against the Imperial Persian Postal Administration for the insured value of lost parcels. Of course the validity of these claims does not in any way depend on the vote of the necessary credits by the National Assembly. The Imperial Government’s liability was incurred when the Postal Administration accepted the insurance fees. It is therefore astonishing that, if the sanction of the National Assembly to discharge such liability is necessary, it was not obtained before the liability was incurred, instead of being only ’’proposed” two or three years afterwards. This procedure is in the highest degree unjust, since no warning was given to the insurers, when the insurance fee was accepted, that no provision had been made for meeting their eventual claims. I venture to suggest to Your Excellency that, if the postal Administration already had authority to accept the insurance fees, that authority surely carried w T ith it the authority to psy the claims without furthet reference to the National Assembly, otherwise the acceptance of the fees is unjustifiable. It appears to me altogether inequitable that the His Excellency claimants Zoka-ul-Mulk, Minister for Foreign Affairs.2 MW clrinants should he made to wait any longer, and, snould that he the case, I feel that it will he my duty to bring the facts to the knowledge of His Majesty’s Government. I av ai 1, etc., (sgd.) E. MOHS ON.British Legation, Tehran. 16th May, 1924. Your Excellency, Mr. Monson had the honour, in his note ¥ 0 . 78 of March 11th, to make certain representations with regard to the attitude of the Persian Government in with-holding, on the ground that the necessary funds had not been voted by the Majlis, the payment due on the insured value of lost parcels. Some of these claims it will oe seen date from July and August 1921. In the absence of any reply to this note I have felt constrained to send a copy to my government. I have further felt it my duty to call attention to the very serious delays in the service between Tehran and Bushire amounting in some cases to five months. I desire particularly to call Your Excellency *s attention to this action in view of the fact that the British Postal Administration may perhaps feel obliged to call attention to the facts on the occasion of the forthcoming Triennial Congress of the International Postal Union which is, I understand, to meet at Stockholm in July, in which case Your Excellency’s Government would no doubt be glad to be forwarded. I feel, however, that the facts regarding non-payment on insured parcels and the delays aoove reierred to are so patent that Your Excellency will realise that the best defence would consist in the earliest possible settlement /of His Excellency Zoka-ul-Mulk,of the claims on the attached list, and a speedy and permanent amelioration in the Tehran - Bushire service and an undertaking that in future all substantiated claims for insurance on lost parcels will be met without unnecessary delay. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my high consideration. (Sd.) Esmond Ovey.x British Legation, Tehran. May 7th 1924. I am informed by His Majesty^ Vice-Consul at Kesht that non-registered letters sent to Persia via Russia have not, in some cases, been delivered, especially where they have been addressed to commercial institutions. Registered letters, however, appear to be safe. The Acting British Vice-Consul at Yezd also reports the disappearance of registered and non-registered letters in Yezd and himself suspects the local postal authorities. There can be no doubt that since the dismissal of Monsieur Camille Molitor and other Belgian officials, the Persian Postal Service is deteriorating rapidly, noticeably in the case of parcels which, as has already been reported to you, are subjected to endless and indefinite delays oetween Bushire and Tehran. The Persian Government has also in some recent cases refused to refund the value of registered parcels in Persia under the plea that the necessary credits have not been obtained from the Majlis, although it continues to accept insured parcels and to levy tie fees for insuring them. As these questions are of considerable importance to trade you may think fit to approach the Post Office with a view to bring the matter up if they think fit, either at Berne or at the International Postal Conference which, it is understood, will be held this year An His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs in the » Department of Overseas Trade.in Sweden, and obtain from the Persian Government some assurance that steps will be taken to remedy these evils and that merchants may count on receiving the full value of insured parcels lost or damaged in transit in Persic; without excessive delay. Otherwise the acceptance of insurance charges appears to me to amount to fraud. I have, e tc. (Sd.) R.H. Hadow.

There is no doubt (he added) 'that such an appointment will oe made in due course arter the 'necessary reference to the Majlis h?s been made, prooably 'during the month of March.' The Agreement for the transfer of the offices was concluded and signed on the 9th December 1922, and it is stated in the preamble thereof that the Agreement has been concluded 'after confirmation by the 'representative of the Imperial Persian Government or the 'assurances given by this Government • As I pointed out to Your Excellency in my note of March 24th 1925 that it would be in more regular form to insert the assurances in the text of the Agreement, lour Excellency replied on 21st April 1923 that it was unnecessary, since the Persian Government had spontaneously engaged the services of Europeans, which would be continued as long as it was considered necessary for the good working of that administration.

There is therefore no shadow of a doubt of the condition on which the Southern offices were transferred; and it is, to say the least of it, surprising that the Persian Government should, without a word to the Representative of the Governments which concluded the Agreement with Persia, violate that condition by transferring the direction of the Administration from European to Persian hands. .-his action is, moreover, particularly ill-uimed in view of the grave defects in the service which I have been recently ooliged to bring to Your Excellency^ notice.

From / The Hon r ble Lieut-Colonel S.G.Knox, C.E.J., C.I.E To Denys de S.Bray, Esquire, C.S.I., C.i.E., C.B.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India Sir 1 have the honour to refer to your letter No.609/3-(ii)~ M., dated 17th May 1923 in which you ask for a report in due course on trie working of the Persian Post Offices in the Persian Gulf with especial reference to the needs of the British and Indian communities. The opinions of those whom I have consulted differ considerably. The Consul at Bandar Abbas reports most favourably on the new service which he states to be prompt and efficient. The same is the opinion generally of the Consul Ahwaz and the Consular Agent Lingah, except that both report delay in the matter of delivery of parcels. On the other hand the Bushire British chamber of commerce, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Mohammerah - and es pecially the latter - have many criticisms to bring forward- I enclose for the information of the Government of India copies of their reports. It will be seen that in both cases complaint is made in regard to the scarcity of stamps, and the surcharge on insufficiently stamped letters, while the Parcel Service is again unfavourably commented on. Delays in delivery of parcels are more the concern of the Customs Department than of the Postal Department: but whichever Department is responsible, the result is certainly general inconvenience.! ' ' (t*^) inconvenience. At Bushire, tor example, parcels arrive on Wednesday by the mail steamer; lists are made out on Thursday by the Customs Department; Friday is a holiday; the lists are sent out to addressees on Saturday; and the latter receive their parcels on Sunday - Thus a delay of 4 days invariably ensues - and in the case of perishable goods lying exposed to the heat m the Customs this delay is often a serious natter* The Conclusion seems to be that in small place s such as Lingah, Ahwaz and Bandar Abbas the Persian Postal De partment has been able to deal with the work sufficiently well; but in Bushire and particularly m Mohammerah where the volume is far greater they have so far proved unsatis factory * I would like to bear testimony to the industry, energy and invariable courtesy of M.Chauviaux, the Provincial Director of Posts in the South who faced with a formidable task and hampered by many difficulties, has spared no efforts’ to make the postal service efficient, it is, 1 venture to submit, hardly to be expected that the Persian Postal Service after less tnan 6 months working should be able to invite serious comparison with that of the Indian Postal Department m the Persian Gulf with 60 years of experience behind it.

Commerce to the Secretary to the Politi cal Resident, Bushire. 1 have the honour to invite reference to your letter r . • No.920 of dune last requesting to be furnished with a re port from my Chamber on the working of the Persian Post Offices in the Persian Gulf and Arabistan. I much regret the delay in acceding to your request, but this has been due to indisposition of and absence from Bushire of certain members. A meeting was, however, held this morning and I now beg to give you below my Chamber’s report si on tne working of Postal Service under the Persian Authorities.. PUNCTUALITY - This was an unknown factor at ohe commence ment of the operations and considerable delay was occasioned in the delivery of letters. Matters, however, have improv ed but it should be possible for quicker delivery of letters to be given than is done at present. On the other hand, with regard to the prompt closing of outward mails, the Chamber is of the opinion that this reflects great credit on the Postal services. PARCEL SLRTluE - The Chamber is of opinion that; this ser vice is in need of considerable improvement. At present great delay occurs between the arrival of the parcel mail and the time when addressees are able to obtain their par cels, and this branch of service calls for great improve ment before it can be termed satisfactory. MIS-uL la VERY UP LETTERS - It .has been the frequent experien ce with the members of this Chamber to have delivered to tne-Li letters addressed to other firms, which, as you can realise, is most undesirable, and which can only be attrlbut- ed to inefficiency, carelessness, or indifference on the part ol the Postal staff, and greater care should be shown by the Postal Authorities and steps taken to put a stop to thesethese mis-deliveries. It has also happened that letters have been received in an open condition, showing signs of having been undoubtedly j forcibly opened. suRCHABGrE - tiy Chamber’s opinion is that the present system of collecting 'tax' is far from satisfactory, and it considers that the Postal Authorities should define more clearly the rates at which these taxes are collected and the rate of ex change at which the various foreign currencies are converted. SCARCITY OF STAMPS - Occasions have also arisen where no Persian stamps have been obtainable from the Post Office, and senders of letters have been told to send money to the Post Office to cover the necessary postage. This you will realise is a most undesirable proceeding; and for your private inform ation I have been asked to inform you that one member of this Chamber, although he sent the necessary money round to the ; Post Office,‘ subsequently had returned to him by the addressee, * one of the envelopes in question which bore no Bushire Post Office Stamp, and uhe consequence was tha i the addressee at {destination had had to pay a tax of five Annas. In the opinion of my Chamber, the Persian Post Office should see that their stocks of stamps are sufficient for all purposes and in the event of their running short of any one denomination, the local director should be empowered to surcharge other denominations to remedy the defect. In conclusion the Chamber would like to bear testimony that the operations of the Postal Services by the Persian Authori ties, from being extremely unsatisfactory, have in indubitably improved in the interim, but there is still ample scope for further improvement.■■MB His Britannic Majesty's Vice Consul, MOHAMvEB/Ui. \&lt;**) 29tii August, 1923. ivDHAIMHAH POST OFFICE. Mith reference to your letters 11/5/1481 and No. 11/5/1409 of 24th and 15th August, the Persian Post Office compares un favourably both in promptness and punctuality with the former 'Iraq Post Office. English and Indian mails, -arriving at 10 A.M. on Thursday are never distributed before 4.0 or 5 0 P.M. and .should the mail boat arrive at 12.0 or later, letters are seldom delivered till the following day. Deliveries of under paid letters are delayed several days, as are V.P.V. parcels. Money Orders to India , of which we send large numbers each month, have not only to be made out on the usual form but also to be entered by us upon the Persian n A.A.* form (advice of des- jf txX v«D' patch). This form of which we attach a sample is a list of pay ments which have to be made in India and should'be compiled by the Persian Post Office from the original forms. Tills simple piece of work however proved beyond the capacity of the clerks, who made so many mistakes in copying that payment of money orders in -India was repeatedly delayed due to no defect in the original money order form (which is kept at Mohammerah) but in the list compiled therefrom which is sent to India. We in fact, attend to practically all work for the Post Office in the matter of Money Order routine otherwise they could not carry on. The Persian Post Office moreover requires Money Orders and 'A.A . 11 lists to be submitted by Wednesday morning whereas the Consular Post Office used to accept up to Friday inclusive. We have also^6o) also been asked to post our nail letters by noon on Friday (24 hours earlier than in the past) though uhe mail boat seldom leaves Mohammerah before Sunday morning. Persian- Postal Dues are 100% or more higher ohan those of ^ ’Iraq or of India. This, as will be appreciated, is a cause of dissatisfaction to the Company’s employees whose complaint that tney are now required to pay double dues for an appreciably less satisfactory service is well founded. Stamps. There has been almost continuous failure by the local post office to obtain adequate supplies of Stamps. Although we have given ample warning of our needs for several months ahead, our applications for stamps have time and again been met with the reply that stocks are insufficient to complete . our requirements or that certain denominations are exhausted. The inconvenience nas often been serious and, needless to say, another ground of complaint by the Company's employees who have the option of putting on stamps of higher values than needful on their letters or of sending them insufficiently stamped. » 4t the time of writing this report the Provincial Director has once again notified us that he cannot supply Stamps of certain denominations, as the central Administration at Teheran nas failed to respond to his repeated and urgent i requisitions. Surcharge . v British Postage was reduced in April last from 3 to 2id per first ounce. The Provincial Director was not apparently notified of the reduction and therefore conti nued to surcharge all letters, bearing 2 i postage, as under stamped, although such letters bore no indication from the country xlx of origin that any payment was due thereon. Despite of our repeated protests, the Provincial Director continued to enforce the Surcharge and it was some four months before he received authority from Teheran to discontinue the practice. General . The Persian Postal Service has. now been in operationmmm ^operation, vice the Consular Post Oil ice for, 6 months and it is with regret that we are unable uo report any signs of improvement during this period. On the contrary we incline to the opinion that the service is steadily losing its original impetus, and we view the future with misgiving. The Provincial Director himself is invariably willing and obliging and is not without some business capacity but we venture to submit that had we not augmented our Mail Department in Mohammerah, Abadan and Ahwaz whereby we ourselves are able to undertake a considerable measure of Postal routine, the Persian Post Office would have proved even more incapable of handling the heavy inward and outward service which this approximately Rs.lOOOA per mensem, has been necessitated and the Company has had to bear this expense in order to assist the Persian Post Office which has about 12 clerks at Mohammerah alone to carry on an organisation which in the days of the Indian and 'Iraq Post Offices was adequately run by an Indian Post Master and two assistants.b»3V.' 7 / ?03-ffn+ I 11 any further communication cm this subject, please quote No. £ fO 3 and address— not to any person by name, but to— “ The Under-Secretary of State,’ Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. f P j 3164 •192-4 THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to / J ^ f and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop ^ of the under-mentioned paper.

June 26til 1923 r\ Air Hw-il Copy. I'y Lord, The Acting Resident and Consul-General at Bushire and His Majesty’s Consul Shiraz having respectively, in reply to ray reminders of the necessity for economy in expenditure on telegrams, drawn my attention to the excessive delays in the postal service which form one of the principal reasons for their extensive use oi the telegraph, I caused the Belgian Director-General of posts to be approached on the subject. It was pointed out to Monsieur Pire that letters now take from eight to ten days to pass between Shiraz and Bushire, whereas they used to take only three days before the service 'was taken over by the Belgians, and that the service between Tehran and Shiraz was also very slow, so that letters take from thirty five to forty five days to go from Tehran to Bushire via Shiraz. Monsieur pire was therefore asked whether it would not be possible to return to the old time of transit between Shiraz and Bushire and to shorten the time taken between Tehran and Shiraz, and also whether letters could not be transmitted in about a fortnight between Tehran and Bushire via ’Iraq. Monsieur pire explained that the contractor for the service between Shiraz and Bushire was a constant source of difficulty to the Administration (whom he appears to bully The Most Honourable The Marquess Curzon of Kedleston K.G.! etc. , etc., etc Foreign Officety exaggerated claims for repairs to posthouses etcetera), but promised to telegraph to the Inspector of the southern post offices to enquire what could be done. As regards the service between Tehran and Bushire, he said that it might be possible to arrange a transit of about 16 days via 1 Iraq: he would study the question: at present the ''ohammerah, but not the Bushire mails were sent by that route. Ifonsieur pire has since informed the Legation that Monsieur uhauviaux reports that the delay between Shiraz and Bushire is due to the fact that the local authorities forbid the movement of mails by night owing to the insecurity on the road. Monsieur pire accordingly requests me to support his request that escorts may be provided for the night mails, and I shall do so, although I gather from Hr. Chick that the alleged insecurity is only an excuse. monsieur pire expressed a hope to see eventually a motor postal service instituted in Persia, since, in his on inion, it would be useless to wait for the establishment of railways, the prospect of which appeared so remote. There is already a postal 'service of motors provided oy an Italian firm, between Teheran and Kazvin. Konsieur pire enquired about the ratification of the Southern post Offices Agreement, and was told, in reply, that we had informed the Persian Government that we were prepared to ratify, but had received no reply. Ke remarked that it seemed impossible to get anything done now by *ae Hajlis, and that the money order service of the Southern oilices w.as non-existent because the Hajlis had not yet repealed cue prohibition of export of rupees., (a matter on which I continue to press the Government). I am sending copies of this Despatch to His Hajesty's Acting High Commissioner at Baghdad, His Majesty's Acting Consul-General at Bushire and to His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz. ..</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0002b7_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/4117</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0002b7</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/4117</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 35/14 'Persia and Persian Gulf: postal administration'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1923/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-11-23T22:16:14</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (204 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 205; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns the postal service in Persia and in the Persian Gulf.The file contains:Review of postal service in Persia [Iran] and in the Persian Gulf, with complaints of inefficiencies since their transfer under Persian administration, 1923Bushire - Shiraz mail service, 1923Proposed appointment of a Persian Director-General of Posts in Persia, whilst the Foreign Office was suggesting a Belgian to be appointed instead, 1924Appointment of Prince Moazed-ed-Dowleh as Director General of Posts, 1924Refusal of Persian Government to pay claims for loss of registered postal parcels, 1924Transfer of the Indian Post Office of exchange from Duzdap [Zahedan] to Mirjawa [Mirjaveh], 1925Transmission of parcels between Europe and Persia via Iraq, 1925Additional parcel post service via Lebanon, Syria and Iraq to Tehran, 1926Relations between Duzdap Railway authorities and Persian Customs administration, 1926Proposal for establishing insured parcel service between Persia and India via Duzdap, 1928Indian Exchange Post Office at Mirjawa, 1932; proposed closure of, 1939.The file is composed of correspondence between: HM Legation at Tehran; HM Consulate for Sistan and Kain; the Foreign Office; the India Office; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs; the Secretary of State for India; Anglo-Persian Oil Company; the Superintendent of Post Offices for Baluchistan; and the General Post Office.There are letters in French in the file, from the Universal Postal Union, from the Foreign Office to the Persian Government, and from the Director-General of the Persian Postal Service.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consulate, Seistan and Kain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>General Post Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India and Burma, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Wireless telegraphy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Post offices</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0002b7#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
