Dear Q-ibson, Many thanks for your letter No. P.Z. 6941/37 of the 4th November about the proposal (l) that the abolition of the limit of Muscat customs dues to 5% under the French treaty of 1844, and (2) jurisdiction in French loges in India, should be made part of the consideration for the surrender of certain British commercial rights in Morocco. I write to say that in view of the reasons to which the Government of India have drawn attention, we gladly agree that neither of these matters should be raised in the Morocco commercial negotiations. Proposal (l) we felt it our duty to bring to your attention without being very keen on it. Proposal (2) did not come from us and I doubt if we could have agreed with it. J. P.

Oir y His I have the honour to refer to article 6 of the Convention of the 29th July 1937 for the abolition of capitulations in Morocco and Zanzibar, whereby it is stipulated that the British post offices in the French Zone of the Sherifian Empire shall be closed at a date to be notified to the Residency-General at Rabat by the British Consulate-General and in any case not later than thirty days after the entry into force of the convention. 2. The post office at Casablanca and the postal agencies at Gaffi, Mazagan and Marrakesh were, in accordance with the instructions of the Postmaster-General after consultation with the Foreign Office, closed on the 14th August last, and the only British postal agencies in the French Zone still in operation are those at Rabat and Fez. 3. The Residency-General, who have for long past entertained ill-founded but ineradicable suspicions as to the British post Offices being capacious channels for the entry of subversive literature, have latterly shown certain signs of restiveness, and would no doubt welcome a notification •f the closure of the two remaining agencies at an early date. Although I would be averse from interpreting their wishes in the matter too nearly as dictates (and the period for closure, which in the British draft convention was sixty days after entry/ Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office,entry into force ? was at the request of -the French delegation reduced to thirty days), it would possibly facilitate the settlement of other outstanding questions if I could give to the Residency-General early notification of a definite c date for the closure of the offices at Rabat and Fez. 4. I have the honour to enquire whether the Postmaster-General has any wishes in the matter. The coming into force of the convention is foreseen for the 1st January next, and Saturday, the 8th January, 1938 is submitted as a suitable date for the closure of these two posts at the end of work on that day. 5.

It would therefore be of some advantage if, as a quid pro^uo for the abrogation of the provision in the Commercial Treaty of 1856 which limits the rates of customs duties to be levied in Morocco to 10 % , we could / I'nlcp. m. dept. HOCT 1937 . no (Signature) (Designation)( 2 I could demand the cession of French jurisdiction in the Loges. On the other hand, the French Government might argue tha.t to raise this question in connection with the proposed conmercial negotiations regarding Morocco, is to betray a premature lack of confidence in the success of the impending negotiations regarding the Logeso Moreover it must be admitted that the cession of jurisdiction in the French Loges is not a very apprepriate set-off against the abrogation of the limits on the French right to levy customs duties in Morocco &lt;&gt; In any case the French Government seem likely to adhere to their contention, which seems plausible, tha/t article 7 of the Commercial Treaty of 1856 is of a capitulatory nature and therefore must go, without any quid pro quo ^ with the rest of the capitulatory rights which have been abolished. For these reasons we consider that nothing will be gained by introducing questions connected with French possessions in India into the proposed conmercial negotiations. 3. As regards the proposal that the French rights under their Treaty of 1844 with the Sultan of Muscat should be linked with the question of British capitulatory and conmercial rights in Morocco it would seem technically that we have no locus standi to negotiate with French Government on behalf of Muscat which is an independent State. We appear however to have been doing so in the past, vide India Office memorandum No_.Pg .l95 0 / 36, dated the 20th March 1936, and letter No&lt;&gt;PZ. 3548/3 6, dated the 30th May 1936 and perhaps therefore no objection be raised on this score. 4. /- 3 - 4* One point however requires consideration. The existence of the article in the Treaty of 1844 limiting the rates of customs duties which the Sultan of Muscat can impose on French goods makes it virtually impossible for him to demand the ripjit of applying rates in excess of the same limit to British goods. If the article concerned in the French Treaty is abrogated before the new commercial treaty which v/e are about to negotiate with Muscat is signed it seems likely that we shall be compelled to agree to the Sultan imposing such customs duties as he pleases within reasonable limits on our goods. For this reason also we deprecate the proposal to link the question of French rights in Muscat with that of British rights in Morocco. 5. Our observations in paragraph 3 and 4 are subject to any comments the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf may wish to make.

BaggsOlay’s letter of the 18th August below in which it is suggested that the question of French commercial rights under their Treaty of 1844 with the Sultan of Muscat might be linked with the question of British commercial rights in Morocco. 2. In view of the independent status of Muscat, it would appear that any practical advantage which might result from the surrender by the French of their commercial rights under the 1844 Treaty would be gained by the Sultan and not by H.M.G., and in such circumstances it seems doubtful whether the other interested Departments of H.M.G-. (e.g. Board of Trade) will be willing to accept the view that the abrogation of French rights in Muscat should be made even a partial quid pro quo for the surrender of British commercial rights in Morocco. 3. But on general grounds the surrender by other foreign Powers of their Treaty rights in Muscat would be to the advantage of H.M.G., particularly if brought about through the influence of the latter, and, subject to any further observations which the Government of India may have to offer, it is submitted that we should support the Foreign Office suggestion. It will be recalled (see telegram of 1st March P.Z.1418/37 - flag A) that the Government of India asked that they should be consulted before the negotiations for the surrender of British commercial rights in Morocco began, and we might therefore take this opportunity of ascertaining whether they have any further observations to offer. 4.

Glauson, Esq# Dear Clauson, With reference to Brenan’s letter Wo. E 4038/1865/91 of the 30th July regarding the modification of the Muscat tariff, Beckett has raised a further point which you may like to consider. In Brief he suggests that the question of French rights under their Treaty of 1844 with the Sultan of Muscat might he linked with the question of British S oa P it ulatory and commercial rights in Morocco. a? £ 2 * The Position with regard to the relationship ghetween the two questions and the grounds for thinking that they might possibly be linked together are as follows? 3. The limitation on the right of the Sultan of Muscat to impose customs duties on goods arriving in French vessels springs from a treaty concluded hy the Sultan in 1844 at a time when he was the ruler not merely of Muscat hut of the territories which are now the/the territories of the Sultan of Zanzibar, Rightly or wrongly, we have for many years contended that these limits have ceased to apply to the Zanzibar tariff because of the abrogation of the limits on customs duties in later Congo Basin treaties, 4, We have recently finished negotiating with the French a Convention for the abolition of British capitulatory rights in Morocco, which, according to us, only covered consular jurisdiction and the exemption of British subjects etc. from local legislation. During these negotiations the French contended with great force that a provision in our Commercial Treaty of 1856 with Morocco, which limits the rates of customs duties to be levied in Morocco to 10$, must be considered to be a right of a capitulatory character which we should give up when abolishing the capitulations. We declined to agree with their contention on tne legal issue (as to which the views of both parties remain intact) but we did agree in a separate letter to embark on commercial negotiations for the replacement of the Commercial Treaty/Treaty of 1856 and it is our intention that as a result of these negotiations, and in return for some suitable £Ull^ro,,,quo L the limits on the Moroccan customs duties laid down in the treaty of 1856 shall be abolished for the French zone of Morocco* 5. I may add here that as part of the terms of the Convention abolishing the capitulations in Morocco there are articles under which the French surrender the vestige of capitulatory rights which they still maintain in the territories of the Sultan of Zanzibar by reason of certain articles in th* Muscat Treaty (the same Muscat Treaty which creates the limits on customs duties). But the Convention leaves intact the application of the old treaty of 1844 with Muscat and does not deal, even as regards Zanzibar, with the articles imposing the limits on customs duties, for the reasons (l) that we hold these articles have already gone as regards Zanzibar (see paragraph 3 above) and the French do not seem to dispute this, and (2) it was our case that limitson customs duties were not capitulatory matters (see paragraph 4 above). 6. It may, however, he worth considering whether, at the time of the negotiations relating to the modification of the Morocco Commercial Convention of 1856, upon which we must soon embark, we should endeavour to obtain the abrogation of those articles limiting the rates of customs duties in the Muscat Treaty, not merely as regards Zanzibar but also as regards Muscat itself, using against the French their own arguments about the unreasonable character of articles limiting customs duties* We should be grateful for your views on this suggestion, which means virtually making the abrogation of the French rights in Muscat, the quid pro quo , at any rate partially, for the abrogation of our rights in Morocco. 6. I am sending copies of this letter to Hibbert at the Colonial Office and Shackle at the Board of Trade asking for their views.5031 Copy FOE .

In their recourse to such tribunals British subjects, British-pro tected persons and British companies shall be subject to the same conditions as French citizens and French companies. After the expiry of ten years from the date of the coming into force of the present convention, the provisions of the second paragraph of this article cannot be invoked, unless the subjects of His Majesty the Sultan of Morocco and companies duly incorporated under the law of the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire enjoy in the United Kingdom the treatment of the most-favoured-nation as regards the matter referred to in that paragraph. Article B. In respect of matters occurring before the entry into force of the present convention, laws and regulations of the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire shall only be applied to British subjects, British- protected persons, British companies and British ships in cases where in accordance with the existing practice such laws and regulations w r ere then applicable to them.

Certificates given by the British consular officers to the effect that the said decisions are final will be accepted. * His Majesty The King undertakes to retain in Morocco all the judicial records of the British consular courts. These records shallbe made available to the tribunals of the irench Zone of the Shereefian Empire wherever these tribunals require them for the purpose of cases within their jurisdiction. Certified copies of these records will be furnished on request to the said tribunals, the competent authorities of the zone and to any other properly interested party. Article 5. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 below, no person owing allegiance to His Majesty the Sultan of Morocco can claim in the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire the protection of His Majesty The King. Natives of the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire, who at the date of the entry into force of the present convention enjoy British protection, either as employees of a British consulate or as semsars, shall for the remainder of their life be justiciable by the French tribunals of the Shereefian Empire except as regards matters coming within the jurisdiction of the Moslem or Jewish religious courts. A list of these persons shall be drawn up within six months of the coming into force of the present convention by agreement between the French Residency-General and the British Consulate-General at Rabat. This list shall include the wives and minor children of these persons living under the same roof, and the provisions of this paragraph shall apply in the case of the wives during the lifetime of their husbands, and in the case of the children until the death of their fathers or until their majority, whichever happens earliest. The persons enumerated in the annex to the present convention shall also enjoy the benefit of the provisions of paragraph 2 above. Article 6.

Article 9. Extracts from ‘ ‘ easier judiciaire ’ ’ shall be delivered to British subjects and British-protected persons resident in the French Zone of Morocco in the same conditions as to French citizens.

Article 10. His Majesty The King shall have the right to maintain consulates at any place in the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire where British consulates are at present established. The establishment of new consulates at other places in the said zone shall be subject to the agreement of the Governments of both High Contracting Parties. British consular officers in the French Zone shall enjoy privileges and immunities not less favourable than those accorded to British consular officers in France or to the consular officers of any other Power in Morocco. Neither this article nor article 20 of the General Treaty signed at Tangier on the 9th December, 1856, on behalf of Her late Majesty The Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and His late Majesty the Sultan of Morocco and Fez, shall, however, entitle His Majesty The King to claim jurisdictional privileges accorded on the basis of existing treaties concluded by His Majesty the Sultan of Morocco and the United States of America. Article 11. British schools of every grade shall continue to enjoy in the French Zone, especially in regard to the teaching of English, the same liberty as hitherto. They will be subject to the laws relating to State control which are applicable to all European schools in the French Zone. Article 12. Article 4, paragraph 1, of the General Treaty signed at Tangier on the 9th December, 1856, does not affect the right of the authorities of the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire to regulate admittance and immigration into the territory or to expel persons forreasons of police or public order or to apply immigration regulations, provided that there is no discrimination against British subjects or British-protected persons. Nevertheless, British subjects and British-protected persons who have been resident in the French Zone of Morocco for more than five years shall not be expelled unless— (a) They have committed a crime or offence punishable with more than three months’ imprisonment. (b) They have been guilty of conduct prejudicial to public safety, public order, good morals or public health. (c) They are in such a state of indigence as to be a burden to the State. The provisions of paragraph 2 of this article may be terminated at any time after the expiry of twenty years from the date of the coming into force of this convention by six months’ notice. Article 18. The powers conferred on British consular officers in the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire in matter of the estates of deceased persons by article 18 of the General Treaty signed at Tangier on the 9th December, 1856, are maintained. Any disputes arising as regards the estates referred to in the said article shall be determined by the competent tribunals of the said zone in conformity w r ith the provisions of laws of general application. The provisions of this article may be terminated at any time after the expiry of twenty years from the date of the entry into force of the present convention by a six months’ notice. Article 14. The High Contracting Parties agree that the French decree of the 8th November, 1921, relating to French nationality in the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire, and the Dahir of the same date, relating to Moroccan nationality, are not applicable to British subjects or protected persons born before the date of the entry into force of the present convention. If the French or Moroccan Governments should enact measures which would result in conferring French or Moroccan nationality by reason of birth or residence in the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire in any case where the above-mentioned decree would not have conferred French nationality, British subjects and protected12 persons affected by these enactments shall be freed from French or Moroccan nationality if they make a request to this effect in the year which follows their majority. Article 15. The subjects of His Majesty the Sultan of Morocco and Moroccan vessels shall enjoy the same rights as Trench citizens and French ships in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, British colonies and in territories under the protection of His Majesty The King, and in mandated territories administered by the Government of the United Kingdom. The expression “ Moroccan vessels ” means ships duly registered as such in a port of the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire. Article 16. The provisions of all earlier Acts, treaties and conventions which are contrary to the preceding provisions of the present convention are abrogated as between the High Contracting Parties so far as the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire is concerned. Articles 13 and 20 of the general Treaty signed at Tangier on the 9th December, 1856, cannot be invoked by His Majesty The King to claim the jurisdictional privileges enjoyed by the United States of America under treaties at present in force. His Majesty The King renounces all rights in the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire under the Convention of Madrid of 1880. Article 17.

Declare, with reference to Article 7, that the present conven tion in no way affects the treaties in force under which in the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire, (a) British subjects, British-protected persons and British companies enjoy equality of treatment with French citizens and French companies in the matter of rights concerning movable and immovable property, mining rights, the exercise of professions, commerce, business and industry; (b) British ships enjoy equality of treatment with French ships; (c) British subjects, British-protected persons and British companies enjoy equality of treatment in matters of taxation with French citizens and French companies; 3.

Declare that the effect of Articles 1 and 16 of the convention is— (a) as regards the General Treaty signed at Tangier on the 9th December, 1856, to abrogate in so far as they are still in force Articles 2, 3, 4 (except the first and last sentences), 5 to 12, 14, 17 and 18 (except in so far as the provisions of this article are main tained by Article 13 of the convention); and (b) as regards the Act of Algeciras to involve the renunciation by His Majesty the King of the right to rely upon Articles 1 to 50, 54 to 65, 70, 71, all pro visions of Article 72 after the word “permit,” 75, 76, 80, 97, 101, 102, 104, 113 to 119; further, in Article 81 the words “by the competent consular authority ’ ’ must be deemed to be omitted and in Article 91 the word “ competent” must henceforth be substituted for the word ‘ ‘ consular ’ ’; 5.

CHARLES CORBIN.26 Minute. The two Delegations desire to record in a minute certain conclu sions wdiich were reached in the course of the negotiations relating to the abolition of rights of a capitulatory character in the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire. These conclusions are as follows :— (1) Upon the promulgation of the projected Arretes Yiziriels, referred to in the Note of the 26th April, 1987, from the Residency- General at Rabat to His Majesty’s Consul-General at that city, which will modify the Arretes Yiziriels of 1938 so as to allow motor- transport enterprises in the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire to insure their vehicles and their employees with different companies, His Majesty’s Government will forthwith cause a King’s Regulation to be made applying to British subjects, British-protected persons and British companies, the provisions of the legislation governing trans port in the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire. They will also, upon the promulgation in the French Zone of the projected legislation regarding the insurance of motor vehicles, at once cause a King’s Regulation to be made applying this legislation to British subjects, et cetera, subject to such reservations as have already been agreed upon. It is possible that the point arising on Article 17 (g) of the projected Vizerial decree on insurance of motor vehicles may have to be the subject of further discussion, but there should be no difficulty in settling this point long before January 1938. (2) With reference to paragraph 2 of Article 5, the terms of which are limited to natives of the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire, the United Kingdom Delegation requested that, when the list provided for in this paragraph is drawn up, the British Consulate- General should be permitted to include in it about 10 semsars and consular employees at present resident in the Spanish Zone on the grounds that these persons are at present subject to the British con sular court if they engage in litigation in the French Zone, and, further, that it would be illogical if in the future by reason of a similar agreement with the Spanish Government they should be subject to the Spanish courts in the Spanish Zone, that they should be subject to the native courts in the French Zone. The French delegation took note of this request and explained that it was a point on which they had at present no instructions from their Government, and that there was not at this stage of the negotia tions time to obtain such instructions. They, nevertheless, undertook to recommend this request for the favourable consideration of the French authorities when discussions took place with regard to the drawing up of the list.28 (8) With reference to Article 7, the two Delegations wish to place on record that a copy of the Dahir of the 12th August, 1918, which at present regulates the status of French citizens and of foreign nationals in the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire was produced and note was taken thereof by the United Kingdom Delegation. (4) With reference to paragraph 2 of the Protocol of Signature, it was agreed by both Delegations that the existence and duration of the rights referred to in this paragraph should not be deemed to be affected in any way by any abrogation of the Commercial Treaty signed at Tangier in 1856 or by its replacement by another commercial treaty of a non-permanent character. (5) It is understood that, during the commercial negotiations envisaged in the letters with regard to the Commercial Treaty of 1856 the question of the “ Reglement sur les douanes ” in the French Zone may be included as one of the matters to be discussed.

At the moment of proceeding to signature of the convention for the abolition of rights of a capitulatory character in the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire, your Excellency expressed the desire to be informed as to the regime which will be applied in this zone to British missionaries. I have the honour to inform you that the French Government has authorised me to state that British missionaries, both those established there at present and those that may come in the future, other than Roman Catholic missionaries, will enjoy in the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire the same treatment as French missionaries. British Roman Catholic missionaries will enjoy the same treatment as that accorded to Roman Catholic missionaries of the most favoured nation other than French Roman Catholic missionaries.

Yeuillez agreer, &amp;c. Ch. CORBIN. (Translation.) French Embassy, Sir, London, July 29, 1937. At the moment of the signing of the convention relating to the abolition of rights of a capitulatory character in the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire, I have to inform your Excellency that the French Government will raise no objection to representations by the British consul-general at Rabat with the competent authorities in favour of the persons covered by paragraphs 2 and 3 of article 5 of the said convention.

I have, &amp;c. ANTHONY EDEN. No. 5. Mr. Eden to M. Corbin. Foreign Office, Your Excellency, London, July 29, 1937. There have been disputes in the past as regards the application to the immovable property of British subjects, British-protected persons and British companies in the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire of protectorate legislation relating to expropriation, or the imposition of servitudes, for reasons of public utility and as regards the compensation payable therefor. Since it is the desire of both Governments that all these disputes shall be settled or provision made for their settlement at the moment when British subjects, British-protected persons and companies in the zone cease to be subject to a special judicial regime, it has therefore been agreed that within two months of the date of this note His Majesty’s Consul- General at Rabat shall present a list to the Shereefian authorities of all the cases of this kind which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom consider should be settled. In the two months following receipt of the list the Consul-General and the Protectorate authorities will settle as many of these cases as possible by agreement between them. If there are any cases which cannot be settled in this way, it has been agreed that they shall be referred to M. Cordier, First President of the Court of Appeal at Rabat, to give his opinion as regards the amount of compensation which is due as a matter of equity on the understanding that the Government of the French Republic and His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom agree to accept this opinion as final.34 t I have, &amp;c.

At the moment of the signature of the convention for the abolition of rights of a capitulatory character in the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire, your Excellency expressed the desire to be informed with regard to the regime which would be applied in this zone to British Chambers of Commerce. I have the honour to inform you that the French Government have authorised me to state that British Chambers of Commerce will be permitted to carry on their work in the French Zone of the Shereefian Empire on condition or conforming to the laws and regulations applicable to associations. These Chambers of Commerce will not be assimilated to the French consultative chambers on which rights of a political character are conferred. On the other hand, it is the intention of the French Government that they shall be treated in the same manner as French professional associations, and, in particular, that they shall be able to present to the French Adminis tration of the Protectorate their wishes and suggestions in the same conditions as French professional associations.

The Government of India, in their telegram No.554 of 1st March, 1937, agree) that it was inadvisable to introduce the question of the French jx’sssssions in India ii# the negotiations on capitulatory rights in French Morocco, but wish^to reserve judgment regarding the possibility of introducing in^the negotiations concerning commercial rights. This view was communicated to the Foreign Office on 5th March, 1937 (P.Z.1418/37). Gince that date the Foreign Office have apparently not written to us further on this point; and it appears from paragraph 2 of the Foreign Office letter dated 17th April, 1937, to the British Ambassador, Washington, that the question of commercial rights is regarded as a separate matter, and that negotiations had not at that date been begun- If that is the case, no further action'''' seems necessary at present, and I presume that the Foreign Office will let us know if and when such negotiations are likely to be held. If approved, however, I will ring up the Foreign Office and confirm this. i ThM M* ^ ^ tvs tc ijk \ G*V&lt;aUmu ir $11 Am ko ^( )&lt;&gt; t/\M^ '?Jlu4 AM P\ u foftftco UMAjfjHA tkuA AM IA UjJaAu Uuh+A* — B063 9696/P 5000 4.37^^ H*HtO , ^ ^ fa W(U M‘ PtJfctA ) l/* mIuJ uA/ito )&lt;/(v' 'Jam $} \In any further communication on this subjeet, pleasefquote k ° u3 u^a.MdiS and aaaiess —not to any person by name,\\kit to— I Hie Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. x. 4 1957 j THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents liis Similar letter sent to 14-6130 14649(4)* f (w 11SV2/46/28) COPY OREIGN OPPICE, S.W. 1 30th June, 1937 Deer Flood, I enclose the latevSt version of the draft convention which we have ore-oared here for the discussions with the French on the termination of our extra territorial rights in Morocco.

Mr. Johnson was also informed that commercial questions relating to Morocco, including the 10% limit of customs duties, were regarded both by His Majesty's Government and the French Government as a separate matter^ There was, however, a possibility that commercial discussions might take place and in that event Mr. Johnson said that the United States Government would His Excellency The Right Honourable .

The United States Government did not want a recurrence of the situation which arose in connexion with the exchanges of notes between His Majesty’s Government and the french Government of the 29th January, 1935, which have not come into force owing to the failure of the French Government to secure the agreement of the United States Government to the arrangement in respect of quota Mr. Johnson was fairly sure that the United States Government were still opposed to the introduction of a quota system in Morocco. I am, with great truth and respect, Sir, Your Excellency's obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State) (Sd.) D. F. HOWARD.COPY ^ (W 5933/46/28) The British Merchants' Morocco Association, 37, Gracechurch Street, h C . 3. 23rG March, 1937. Sir, In view of the approaching discussionswhich it is Rnder«wood are shortly to take place for the nurpoec of giving effect to Article 13 of the Treaty of - Alliance between Great Britain and i^gypt, this Association conciderc it desirable again to put forward its reasons for urging His Majesty's Government to resist any request which France may consider the occasion warrants her in making to invite a surrender of the Capitulations in Morocco. ihe chief reasons for this Association’s strong opposition to any question of surrender is the complete lack of confidence it has in any arrangement that is not enforceable by definite safeguards. It should be remembered that it was only on condition of maintaining the 'open door' in Morocco that the other Powers agreed to allow France to establish her Protectorate there. The capitulations serve as a valuable lever for preventing discriminative action. That this Association should resolutely opnose any proposal to surrender the Capitulations can he understood when the fate of British trade in the past is considered in those cases where France has been allowed to obtain unrestricted control. The cases of Algeria and Tunis are well known, but perhaps the more recent example of Madagascar The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S . W. 1» may/16 l ^ I k i may be quoted as typical of the lengths to which France will go when she is not held unhesitatingly to the letter and the spirit of her undertakings. The negotiations for the establishment of a French Protectorate over the Island of Madagascar were debated in the House of Commons on 25th February 1386 when Mr. 3 ryce, the Foreign Under Secretary, replying to Sir Robert Fowler, said:- ’’.Distinct assurances have been given by France to the Powers that the Treaty will make no change in their existing treaties with Madagascar. ,f The Declaration of 5th August 1890 itself stated ”It is understood that the establishment of the Protectorate will not effect any rights or immunities enjoyed by British subjects in that Island.” It also embodied the most-favoured nation clause. For some time, France adhered to the arrangement, but in 1897, after having annexed the island on the pretext of subduing a rebellion, she began to allow French goods to enter free of the 10/d duty levied on ’’other nationality” goods. Finding she was able to ignore the British protests she increased the duty until British cottons were taxed from 40..o to 120,o over and above the duty levied on French goods, with the result that the values of British cotton imports fell as shown on the following table 1896.. 1897.. 1898.. 1899.. 1900.. Mth such an example before them, the Association cannot contemplate with equanimity any proposal which might involve the repetition of a policy so much opposed to that of the ’’open ’’door” in Morocco, to which France has pledged herself. Another/Another reason for opposing any surrender of capitulations in Morocco is the damage to British prestige which such surrender would cause. In the eyes of the Moors and, indeed, of all the British Moslems throughout the world, British prestige would suffer irreparable harm if they saw the British deprived of the old established rig ts in Morocco which they have long regarded as one of their most efficacious safeguards against oppression by their own Sultan end his officers, and even the French themselves» It is a question o:? some moment, which cannot he lightly brushed aside whether Great Britain can afford to risk injury in this direction at a time when the whole of the Moslem world is profoundly disturbed and Italy is making a bid to become the •’Protector of Islam,” The French, no doubt, will endeavour to place the British Government in an embarrassing position by asking why His Majesty’s Government is willing to recognise the responsibility of the Egyptian Government for the lives and properties of foreigners in Fgypt whilst at the same time they refuse to give the same responsibility to the Moroccan Government, fortified as it is with the protection of France, and no doubt that would be a difficult question to answer unless His Majesty's Government is prepared to speak ”en clair' to the French Government, There is, however, a great difference to be noted. The surrender of British Capitulations in Fgypt assists that country towards independence, whereas surrender of British Capitulations in Morocco can only have the effect of strengthening France’s hold on Morocco and encouraging her to increase her efforts to discriminate in favour of her own nationals at the expense of British and other foreign competitors. Furthermore,/Furthermore, the abolition of the capitulations in ^gypt was advocated by Great Britain in Lord Cromer’s time, long •before there was any thought of Lgypt’s independence because they were found to be cumbrous and led to perpetual difficult! with foreign countries whereas, in Morocco, they serve as a useful safeguard. lor these reasons this Association is opposed to any surrender of any of the rights Great Britain has enjoyed in Morocco in virtue of treaties concluded before the coming of £ reach influence to Morocco and would be glad to have your Department’s assurance that no effort will be spared to maintain the Capitulations in Morocco if and when the question is raised. I am, etc. * (Signed) M.3.Milne.

As the result of a communication made by the French Government, His Majesty’s Government have accordingly explained to them their attitude in this matter and are preparing to negotiate a convention containing safeguards against non-discrimination. The Secretary of the Association was informed of the position at a meeting at the Board of Trade on the 12th March. a. I am to add that the instances cited of Algeria, Tunis and Madagascar are not relevant to the case of Morocco owing to the non existence in those territories of treaty instruments of the nature of the Act of Algeciras or the United Kingdom Commercial Convention of 1856 with Morocco.

The draft convention was discussed at an informal meeting held on the 19th March in Paris with officials of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, during which it was suggested that article 10 ( 4 ) (h) might he so amended as to apply only go holdings of shares by British subjects possessed at the date of the convention and not to holdings acquired suosequently, M. de St. Quentin, however, pointed out that the large British holding in the State Bank had been disposea of, ,ith the consent of His Majesty’s Government, a few years ago and he doubted whether the provision in article 10 ( 4 ) (b) was really necessary as only a very few British subjects now possessed shares. “this connexion I am to refer to correspondence enuing with Treasury letter of the 6th February, 1930 (F.11682) and to enquire the views of the Lords Commissioners of His The Secretary t o the Treesury.

Article 2 provided that;- T, In the event of their (i.e., His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom) considering it desirable to introduce into Egypt reforms tending to assimilate the Egyptian legislative system to that in force in other civilised countries, the Government of the French Republic will not refuse to entertain any such proposals, on the understanding that Hie Britannic Majesty’s Government virill agree to entertain (the French text uses the term ’examiner’) the suggestions that the Government of the French Republic may have to make to them with a view to introducing similar reforms in Morocco”. In present circumstances it is, of course, the Egyptian Government who are proposing ?t to introduce” the reforms, the action of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom being limited to the use of theirtheir good offices in securing the assent of the other interested Governments, but it is not considered that it would be possible on this ground to refuse to enter into negotiations with the French Government for the purpose of concluding an agreement under which British ex-territorial rights will disappear on conditions laid down therein. 2. The British exterritorial privileges in Morocco which are in question cover the exercise of consular jurisdiction over British subjects who are placed outside the jurisdiction of the local courts (except in matters relating to real property or when suing as Plaintiffs Defendants who are subject to that jurisdiction) and the exemption in general of British subjects from the operation of local legislation unless applied to them by regulations made by British Consuls, including the operation of legislation imposing taxation, other than customs duties. These rights spring from the General Treaty of 1856 with Morocco, particularly Articles 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, n and 14, but are developed to some extent in subsequent multilateral agreements in particular the Madrid Convention of 1880, and a number of provisions of the Act of Algeciras 1906 are based on the existence of such rights although the main object of that Act was to secure the maintenance of freedom and equality in commercial matters. 3. As regards consular jurisdiction, these rights are now possessed only by British subjects and United States citizens, all other foreign nationals being amenable to the French courts, although enjoying the benefits of equality of treatment in commercial matters under the Act of Algeciras. It is considered that British subjects wold find a fairly satisfactory substitute for consular jurisdiction, however, in the French courts. In the matterof legislation including taxation it would be desirable to provide for national and moat-favourad-nation treatment, 4. Generally the consular jurisdiction and personal rights now enjoyed are not in themselves of particular importance, but they afford a valuable safeguard against discriminatory acts by the French Protectorate and their disappearance might, it is considered render it easier for the French authorities by disguised discrimination to circumvent the commercial rights for equality of treatment. This possibility would be increased if certain rights contained in the Commercial Treaty with Morocco of 1856 were also surrendered in particular Article 7 which, ae revised by Article 86 of the Act of Algeciras, forbids inter alia the imposition of a higher duty than 12-^ on goods imported by British subjects. The principle of economic liberty with equality is indeed enshrined in the preamble of the Act of Algeciras and this Act cannot be modified without the assent of all the parties, but that principle alone may prove to be an insufficient safeguard for British trade. These rights in the commercial treaty should, it is thought, only be given up in return for further explicit guarantees to prevent such disguised discrimination. 5. In the circumstances, in the view of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, it is desirable that in the first instance an attempt should be made to confine tl e negotiations to the subjects upon which the French Government have the right under the 1904 declaration to demand eonsideration of their proposals, i.e., the abolition of capitulatory rights (any proposals to revise the Commercial Treaty of 1856 being reserved for separate consideration) and that as complete safeguards as possible should7. should be obtained. A draft Convention between the United Kingdom and France has been prepared on these lines with a view to discussion with the French Government in the event of that Government requesting consideration of the question. A copy of this draft is enclosed. ‘The existing treaty rights ^hich it is proposed should be modified are shown in Articles 2, 9, 10, and the guarantees which it is proposed to demand in return are indicated in the other articles of the draft. Articles 1&amp;-14 however deal with Zanzibar. It is understood that the French Government are in fact likely to raise the question in the very near future . 6. It will be seen that the draft Convention is in the form of an intergovernmental bilateral agreement between the United Kingdom and France. The treaty rights which are being modified are however rights enjoyed by all British subjects. In the circumstances it would appear to be appropriate that His Majesty’s Governments in the Dominions should also in some formal manner signify their concurrence in the abrogation of these existing treaty rights. This could be effected either by their participation in any agreement which might be signed, or by means of a note addressed to the French Government notifying that Government that they renounced their rights to benefit by those provisions of the existing treaties, which were superseded in the proposed Convention, and fis renunciation could no doubt be arranged to include the condition that the benefits conferred by the proposed Convention should similarly be extended to them. In this connection it will be observed that an attempt is made in the proposed Convention to safeguard the rights of British subjects, British protected persons, British companies and British ships generally. The practical importance of seGurii* as wide an extension of such safeguards as can be obtained will be apparent from the explanation of the possible consequences of thepropoeed Convention which has already been given.7. If the French Goyernment press for it His Majesty’s Goyernment in the United Kingdom do not ^ * i propose to refuse to enter into commercial negotiations simultaneously involving in return for adequate guarantees the modification of some of the provisions of the Commercial Treaty of 1856* A further communication will however he addressed to you one this matter, if these commercial Tour Excellency negotiations take place. 8.

In this connection they point out that if the contemplated direct negotiations with the French regarding the Loges prove fruitless it may be useful to demand the surrender of French jurisdiction in the Loges as an off-set against the surrender of British commercial rights in Morocco. For this reason the Government of India wish to be consulted when the negotiations for hearing commercial rights are about to begin. It is pointed out, however, that the negotiations regarding commercial rights will probably be well under way before the results of the contemplated negotiations regarding the French Loges in India are available; but since the Government of India have made the request there is no harm in asking the Foreign Office to let us have a further opportunity of considering the matter before the negotiations regarding commercial rights begin.

January 1, 1937. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1 . W 46/46/28] Consul-General Hurst to Mrl Eden.—(Received January 1, 1937.) Copy / (No. 141. Confidential.) Sir. Rabat, December 7, 1936. ON the receipt, contemporaneously with my arrival at this post, of your despatch No. 161 of the 14th September last, instructing me to submit any further observations supplementary to those of Sir A. Ryan and Mr. Edmonds, which might appear necessary as to safeguards against the event of the surrender of British capitulatory privileges in the French Zone of Morocco, I invited the views of Mr. Stonehewer-Bird, whose experience of Morocco extends back to 1923. 2 . I have the honour to attach copies of a useful memorandum which he has compiled and with which I am in agreement. 3. My short stay in Rabat suffices for me to share certain opinions which my predecessors have already expressed. British subjects, though many will no doubt raise despairing cries when the time comes, are not likely to suffer great hardships from the loss of jurisdictional and other special privileges which, however pleasant, are now an anachronism. With British trade, on the other hand, it is likely, whatever precautions are taken, to be otherwise. The economic and financial situation of Morocco continues to be decidedly unsatis factory; the budget is expected to leave a heavy deficit to be filled by whatever expedients can best be devised, the harvest has again been disastrous, trade and industry are sluggish, wholesale and retail prices are steadily rising and Moorish nationalism is stirring uneasily. The limitations imposed by the Act of Algeciras are becoming progressively more irksome for a mother country which has poured much money into Morocco, which will have to provide much more, and which is struggling in return to increase by any means which are likely to succeed the lion’s share of the Protectorate’s imports which she already holds. The Pro tectorate attitude towards British interests has for some years past—-and especially since the arrival of M. Ponsot—become progressively more intransigent and unaccommodating, and apt to whittle away the British trade share. 4. Since the peak year of 1929, when both imports and the United Kingdom share therein reached their highest levels (respectively 2,547,430,000 and 260.216,000 fr.) there has been a progressive falling off year by year both in the total imports and in the United Kingdom figures and proportion (1930, 193 million francs or 8-7 per cent.; 1931, 176 million or 8-5 per cent.; 1932, 136 million or 7-6 per cent.; 1933, 94 million or 5-9 per cent.; 1934. 58 million or 4-4 per cent.; 1935, 49 million or 4-3 per cent.). The devaluation of the franc is now likely to make the British task, suffering already from the Japanese competition of the past years, still harder. Measures for safeguarding what is left of our imports are suggested in the enclosure to this despatch and in the two previous memoranda referred to in paragraph 1 , nor can I think of any further proposals likely to be of material use. 5. The president and two members of the British Chamber of Commerce m Casablanca called on me on the 4th instant to enquire whether I had any infor mation as to the impending abolition of the Capitulations, and to express their grave concern at such a possibility. The position of British merchants in Morocco would, the deputation said, become untenable in such an eventuality; they would all have to close their businesses and leave the country. I demurred at such an extreme picture. I said that no request had yet been made by the French Government nor could I say if, or when, it might be advanced. The Chamber would doubtless bear in mind that, when the time came, His Majesty’s Government had undertaken to consult them. I suggested that, had they not already tabulated their proposals—the possibility of the disappearance of British 1 capitulatory right was no new matter, but extended back a number of years— they might wish to do so, and bring them up to date at occasional intervals. [912 a—1] Br 2 6 . A minor alteration which has been introduced since the date of Mr. Edmonds’s memorandum and which is not referred to in that of Mr. Stonehewer-Bird may be mentioned for the sake of completeness. The postage on letters between the United Kingdom and Morocco sent through the British Post Offices has now been reduced to inland and empire rates, while a cash on delivery service has been inaugurated for parcels sent from the United Kingdom to Morocco. These concessions have undoubtedly been of son^ advantage to British trade. 7. In conclusion, I would suggest the usefulness of getting into touch— perhaps at a later stage—with my United States colleagues, the consul-general in Tangier and the consul in Casablanca, whose experience might result in some helpful suggestions. 8 . I am sending a copy of this despatch and enclosure to His Majesty s consul-general in Tangier. I have, &amp;c. L. H. HURST. Enclosure. Memorandum. SIR ANDREW RYAN, in his memorandum of the 19th March, 1930. and Mr. Edmonds, in his memorandum of the 28th October, 1932, have dealt so exhaustively with all aspects of the question that there is little to add. 2 . The situation since these memoranda were written has not changed to any great extent, though the tendency to regard Morocco as a part of France, and to introduce purely French legislation has certainly greatly increased of late years. 3. Both Sir'Andrew Ryan and Mr. Edmonds refer to the possibilities of (1) the annexation of Morocco by France and (2) the declaration of the indepen dence of the country, and feel strongly that the treaty or instrument of renuncia tion of Capitulations should be made with both France and Morocco. I agree, though I feel that the chances of Morocco obtaining her independence are remote for as long as France maintains her position in Africa. 4 . There is, I believe, generally speaking less feeling against the capitu latory regime (consular courts, semsars and postal agencies) than against the treaties, whereby France is prevented from favouring French imports and Fiench industries in Morocco. Herein may lie the main difficulty in negotiating any instrument which will ensure the maintenance of the principle of economic and commercial liberty and equality. . , , 5. Sir Andrew Ryan and Mr. Edmonds have dealt so thoroughly with the question of safeguards for our trade that I would only stress one point namely, that any departure from the principle of a uniform ad valorem tax on all imports will almost inevitably result in the loss of most, if not all, of our trade. If the French are allowed to place higher import duties on certain articles than on others even while maintaining the same rate for imports from all countries, this freedom can be so used as to favour French to the exclusion of other imports An example would be edible oils ; a tax of 5 per cent, cou d be placed on olive ml and a tax of 25 per cent, on groundnut oil. There would be theoretical equality between importers, but the effect would be that the article m which the French have the greater interest would be favoured. But the greatest danger m this respect lies in the power of the French to impose internal duties— taxes de consommation and in the case of oils cited above, even if a uniform tariff for all edible oils were imposed, it would be possible, by the imposition of a higher “ taxe de consommation” in other oils, to ensure the exclusive sale of olive oil. The question of internal duties is, I feel, of the greatest importance, as it can rob of its value any agreement as to customs tariffs ; a heavy horse-power tax or, as in France, a heavy tax on petrol could, for example, completely destroy the trade in American motor cars. It would certainly be advisable, if possible, to oress for the abolition of veiled import duties, “ droits de portes ' and taxes de consommation” on imported goods while agreeing, if necessary, to a higher uniform rate of duty on imports.6 . There are a few other matters dealt with in the memoranda on which 1 venture observations :— Consular Courts and Future Jurisdiction (Sir Andrew Ryan's memorandum, paragraphs 35 to 39).-—While provision is suggested for the termination of cases pending in the consular courts or brought within sixty days of the renunciation, 'me case of the plaintiff who, while wishing to proceed against a British subject, prefers to wait until he can bring his action against the defendant in the French court, has apparently escaped notice. I do not know how far it would be possible to stipulate that an action the case for which existed before the renunciation of Capitulations must be tried by the consular court, but the absence of some such stipulation may result in :— {a) The trial by a French court of a British subject for some act committed by him before the renunciation of Capitulations, which though in the eyes of English law not illegal, was yet an offence in the contemplation of French law. (b) The hearing in the French court of a case brought against a British defendant in respect of a transaction which took place before the renunciation of Capitulations, the successful issue of which might depend on the application to the British defendant of a local regula tion not covered by King’s Regulation. 7. This matter is most important where the potential plaintiff is a branch of the Administration. There exist a number of regulations which have not been applied to British subjects, and it would be necessary to stipulate that non- compliance with such regulations at a time when they were inapplicable could not form the basis of a charge against the person concerned or render him liable to an administrative fine. 8 . Taxes. Arrears of Taxation (Sir Andrew Ryan’s memorandum, para graphs 6 - 8 ) (Mr. Edmonds’s memorandum, paragraph 32).—I think it should be stipulated that no arrears of taxes not applicable by King’s Regulation should be claimed from British subjects in respect of the year preceding that in which the renunciation takes place, and that it should be further stipulated that no tax should be claimed from British subjects in respect of any period more than twelve months previous to the renunciation. Thus, if Capitulations were renounced in 1940, only taxes applicable by King’s Regulation could be claimed in respect of 1939, whereas no tax could be claimed, whether applicable or not, in respect of 1938 and previous years. The reason for this stipulation is that there is a tendency on the part of the authorities to keep on their books as taxes still due, items of taxation in regard to which a case has been heard in the consular court and a decision unfavourable to the authorities has been recorded. There may, of course, remain judgments for arrears of taxes which have not been executed at the time of the renunciation; there would be no objection to the authorities them selves executing these judgments of the consular court after the court had ceased to function. 9. Nationality. —Sir Andrew Ryan has dealt very fully with this question in paragraphs 28 to 32 of his memorandum, and I would merely draw attention to the fact that the problem dealt with in his paragraph 31 is in process of solution (see correspondence ending with Foreign Office despatch No. 138 of the 22 nd July, 1936). 10 . Missions. —The number of missionaries has increased of late years, and a bishop with headquarters at Casablanca has been appointed. A provision for treatment similar to that accorded to Franciscan missionaries would probably provide sufficient safeguard. IE Bank of British West Africa. —As Mr. Edmonds points out in para graph 27 of his memorandum, the great asset of the bank is its freedom from inspection and its consequent secrecy. I do not anticipate that the authorities would, when Capitulations are renounced, pursue an active policy of interference, but I fear very much that knowledge of the removal of the bank’s special asset of secrecy may result in a considerable loss of local custom, which, if coupled with a decline in British trade, may make it impossible for the bank to carry on. A declaration on the lines suggested by Mr. Edmonds would undoubtedly help the bank in any difficulty which they might encounter with the authorities, but it is doubtful whether it would appreciably prolong its life. [912 a—1] b 24 12. Patton-Bethune Case (paragraph 11 of Sir Andrew Ryan’s memorandum).—This case has been settled. RT Licences. This question is touched upon by Sir Andrew Ryan in para- graph 39 of his memorandum. It might perhaps be possible to provide that British applicants for licences as taxi-drivers, purveyors of liquor or municipal guides should have the same treatment as French applicants. Theoretically^^ applications for taxi licences are taken in order of date, but in practice there is considerable juggling with the list, the excuse usually being, when the facts cannot be denied, that special consideration had to be given to the later application of a pere de famille nombreuse ” or a “ mutile de guerre.” 14. With regard to Sir Andrew Ryan’s suggestion that we might seek to establish the principle that no penalty shall be enforced except by decision of a court, I feel confident that the French will not agree. It seems to me impossible for the Irench to admit that an Italian taxi-driver can be punished administratively, but that a British taxi-driver can only be punished by the French courts. The reason for the administrative, rather than the legal, punish ment of taxi-drivers is two-fold, first, the delay, if the matter were brought to court, between the commission of the act and its punishment would be unduly long, and, secondly, the taxi-driver is a servant of the municipality, and the municipality argue with some force that they should be free to inflict punishment, or discipline must suffer. 15. Consular Immunities (paragraph 28 of Mr. Edmonds’s memorandum).— Consular franchise and freedom from taxation is presumably enjoyed by French consular officers serving in Morocco, in virtue of the fact that their British and Fmted States colleagues still enjoy these rights. If there are any analogies for the maintenance of these privileges after the renunciation of Capitulations \e.q., Syria ?), it would be pleasant if consular officers could retain them. If customs franchise is to be withdrawn, six months’ grace could perhaps be accorded, as in the case of the ‘ c premiere installation ” of consuls in non-capitulatory countries. 16. Cemeteries—Vavcz remain only about four or five British subjects who by reason of their great length of residence and early association with the Church, may be said to have a prescriptive right to burial in the cemetery. The French may press for complete disaflection of the cemetery, i.e., for the 'removal of the graves as they did in the case of the Spanish cemetery. I fee] that we have a stionger case for resistance than had the Spaniards in that our cemetery surrounds our church, and is, moreover, further from the centre of the town. If, however, it is found necessary to accede to a request by the French for the removal of our graves, we could presumably claim in exchange a special portion of the municipal cemetery of sufficient size to permit of the transfer of existing graves and of all future burials of British subjects. 17. Casiers Judiciaires (paragraph 47 of Sir Andrew Ryan’s memorandum and paragraph 35 of Mr. Edmonds’s memorandum).—I feel that it would be unreasonable to expect the Protectorate authorities to continue to accept consular certificates in lieu of extraits de casiers judiciaires.” Such certificates are acceptable at present because the consular court alone is competent to know whether a British subject has, or has not, been condemned for any crime in Morocco, but after the renunciation of Capitulations such certificates would be valueless except in so far as they related to the period during which the person concerned was subject to the jurisdiction of the consular court. 18. I understand that “extraits de casiers judiciaires” may be obtained by any European born outside Morocco on application to the “ Garde des Sceaux ” in Paris, while a European born in Morocco has merely to apply to the court of first instance in the town in Morocco, in which he is domiciled.' I think that in these circumstances it would be sufficient if an assurance were obtained that “extraits de casiers judiciaires” would be issued to British subjects on completion of the same formalities as those required by French subjects. At the same time, we could not well object if the authorities required, as an additional formality, the production of a consular certificate to the effect that during the period when the applicant was subject to consular jurisdiction, he was not found guilty of any crime. A certificate of this nature might reasonably be required if no record is kept by the local police of sentences passed in the consular court. 19 Personal Status (paragraph 36 of Mr. Edmonds’s memorandum).—The principle whereby the national law of the foreigner is applicable to questions ofI n o marriage, divorce and estates of deceased persons, seems, as Mr. Edmonds states, acceptable. 20 I would merely point out that this system involves the granting by consular officers in Morocco of certificates which they may only grant in virtue of their judicial capacity, and in accordance with the Rules of Court. Some mention ^ould presumably have to be made in Consular Instructions to meet this require- ^Aent. 21. Outstanding Claims (paragraphs 1 to 5 of Sir Andrew Ryan’s memorandum).—There are still a few outstanding expropriation claims, but none of any magnitude. Mr. Bullard was endeavouring, before his departure, to obtain the Residency s agreement to the following basis of settlement : the compensation to be paid to a British subject to be the value of the land at the time of the expropriation decree plus interest at, say, 5 per cent, until the date of payment. This seems fair and it might be stipulated that all claims outstanding at the time of the renunciation should be settled on this basis (arbitrators to be appointed by agreement between the parties to decide on the value of the land). I fear that it would be difficult, though it would be desirable, to ensure that future cases should be dealt with in this way, unless the French were prepared to enact that all cases of expropriation of all nationals should be similarly treated. The French subject at present is paid (at any time it may suit the municipality within twenty years) the value of his land at the date of the expropriation decree, and obtains no com pensation for the fact that during a period of years he has been unable to utilise the land. 22 . The only outstanding case of any magnitude of which I know is Mr. Bryce Nairn’s claim against the “ Travaux publics,” which is at present the subject of correspondence between the Foreign Office and Rabat. I feel that this case should be settled before the renunciation of Capitulations. Casablanca, November 23, 1936.r Register No. P. ? • 16l/ 1937. SECRET.

So long as French claims rested on that ground, His Majesty's Government possessed a good case for presenting 'counter-claims', of which one (although i never strongly pressed) was the question of territorial adjustments in India. Our full desiderata, under this heading is set out in the letter addressed to the Foreign Office on the 25th June, 1925 - P.Z. 1881/25 - Flag B. It has, however, always been recognised that the time might come whercthe French would be in a position to demand the abolition of British extra-territorial I ! rights in Morocco as a quid pro quo for the surrender j of French rights in Egypt . With the signing of the Treat/, of Alliance with Egypt, that time has arrived, and it is extremly doubtful whether the question of 'counter-claims' will now arise. That being so, it is necessary to reconsider our attitude, and in their letter of the 4th January (Flag C), the Foreign Office ash MhicL for our views in the light of the circumstances. The contemplated negotiations with the FrenchGovernment are likely to fa.ll into two categories, viz:- (a) those relating to the capitulatory rights proper, and (b) those relating to British commercial rights /Wt^rr-^-o As regards (a), it has alre c dy been pointed out that the French are in a position to demand the surrender of British capitulatory rights in Morocco as a quid pro quo foi similar French rights in Egypt. In such circumstances we can, it is suggested, have no hesitation in accepting the Foreign Oiiice view that questions connected with the French Possessions in India should not be introduced (Hi. into the negotiations capitulatory rights proper. As regards (b), it would appear that there is a prospect of bargaining with the French, and that the negotiations unaer this head may possibly afford an opportunity to broach questions in which we are interested. In this connection, however, it is pointed out that we are on the point of initiating negotiations with the French Government with a view to settling long-standing troubles connected with the French Loges in India, and it seems desirable that this latest method of approach to a difficult and complicated problem should not be disturbed. If questions connected with the Loges are excluded, it seems doubtful whether India could hope to obtain any concessions from the French arising out of the commercial negotiations, but the Government of India may think differently, and it is proposed to ask for their views. A draft Express letter is submitted accordingly. M. /gg / k+m ry&gt;, y y*yyyy\ id 1 , &gt;. : ^ mg ^ ‘ •)Q£_ 14 4-^ ir^Aow P&amp; J 15319c 5)01) 10.36 Draft Paper. % \ tv 55?) P.Z. 161/37.

V)i5 With reference to Foreign Office letter No.W 14943/5962/28 of the 19th November regarding the possible surrender of British extraterritorial rights in Morocco, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit, herewith, the draft of a convention which has been drawn up in this Department as a possible basis of discussion in the event of negotiations for the surrender of such British rights in the French zone of MIorocco, together with copies of letters which have been addressed to the Board of Trade, Dominions Office and Colonial Office on the subject. 2, Mr. Eden is aware that when the surrender of these rights was being examined in 1933, in which connexion I am to invite attention to the printed memorandum enclosed in Foreign Office letter No. W 2548/25 48/28 of the 23rd April, 1934, the possibility was considered of putting forward as one of the British counter demands, a claim by the Government of India to exercise police jurisdiction over British subjects in the French enclaves in India. As the Marquess of Zetland will observe from the Foreign Office letter enclosed herewith, the circumstances in which it is contemplated that the negotiations with the French Government will take place are different in an important respect from those existing in 1933, as the French Government will be able to claim, in return for the surrender of their capitulations in Egypt, the surrender of British extraterritorial rights in the French zone without His Majesty^ Government being 0. 2 a JAM 1937 :,ii secretary, pout. The Under-Secretary of State, India Office. able/able to put forward any counter demands, unless connected with capitulatory rights proper, such as the proposed counter demand in connexion with French extraterritorial rights in Zanzibar. Mr.Eden feels considerable doubt as to the advisability of introducing the question of police jurisdiction in the French enclaves in India into the contemplated negotiations on capitulatory rights proper, in view of the fact that the French Government would no doubt claim some additional equivalent concession in return, but if the Marquess of Zetland attaches considerable importance to the point it is possible that the negotiations in regard to British commercial rights in Morocco, in particular the right to a fixed maximum rate for customs duties, may possibly afford an opportunity to broach the matter. 3. In view, however, of the proposal now under discussion with the French Government to initiate negotiations regarding certain of the French loges in India, it is not clear whether it would now in any case be desiraole to endeavour to raise such questions as that mentioned in the preceding paragraph of this letter during the contemplated forthcoming negotiations in connexion with Morocco. 4. Mr.Eden will be glad to receive as soon as possible the views of the Marquess of Zetland on this question. 5. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Board oi Tiade, Dominions Office, Colonial Office and Department of Overseas Trade. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant,(W 17918/5962/28) FOREIGN 0 NICE, S.W.l. 4th January,. 1937. Sir ? With reference to Foreign Office letter No. . W 14943/5962/28 of the 19th November regarding the possible surrender of British extraterritorial’, rights in Morocco, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit herewith copy of the draft of a convention between the United Kingdom and France which has been drawn up in this department as a oossible basis of d.iscussion in the event of negotiations for the surrender of such British rights in the French zone of Morocco. 2. I am to explain that on the assumption that the French Government are prepared to surrender their capitulatory rights in Egypt, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom must be prepared, in return, to surrender British extraterritorial rights in the French zone of Morocco. In the opinion of Mr. Eden His Majesty’s Government will be unable to obtain merely in return for the surrender of British extraterritorial rights in the French zone guarantees of a commercial character in the French zone such as they had hoped to claim if these rights had been surrendered before the surrender of French capitulatory rights in Egypt. On the other hand, it would be reasonable to expect that the French Government would agree simultaneously to surrender the vestiges of extraterritorial rights which they claim in Zanzibar. The present draft convention is drawn up therefore/ The Secretary to the Board of Trade.therefore on the basis that it deals only with capitulatory rights proper and matters which may he regarded as hound up with such rights, leaving commercial matters aside. 3. In some cases it is a matter of appreciation whether the provisions of some of the old treaties relating to Morocco should he regarded as of a capitulatory or commercial nature. Mr. Pden considers, however, that as the Egyptian Capitulations Convention will almost certainly include a guarantee against discrimination there is reasonable ground for inserting such a guarantee in the present draft convention. 4.. The french Government will no doubt insist on a similar guarantee for French nationals in Zanzibar, and unless good reasons can be advanced for rejecting this claim His Majesty’s Government will probably have to concede it if they insist on the guarantee as regards the .French Zone.. The draft convention includes, therefore, similar guarantees as regards non-discrimination in respect of Zanzibar as are provided for the benefit of British subjects in respect of the french Zone of Morocco. Mr. Eden is inclined to the view that such guarantees do not really go beyond what French nationals in Zanzibar are already entitled to under the most-favoured-nation provisions of the Muscat Treaty of 1844 and the Convention of Ot. Germain revising the Berlin and Brussels Acts. 5. The French Government may possibly wish to discuss other provisions of the old Morocco treaties, which as being of a commercial character have been left unchanged in the present draft convention, in particular the article imposing a maximum ad valorem rate for customs duties, and probably those provisions&lt;lg) provisions of the Act of Algeciras and the Franco-Cjerman Convention of the 4th November 1911 relating to adjudications for state contracts etc. in that event it may be convenient to take the line that these points must be discussed separately from capitulatory points proper. His Majesty’s ‘X Government may be willing to discuss them and perhaps even to discuss them simultaneously but thejr would, inter alia, require the presence of other additional personnel than those concerned in the discussion of purely capitulatory points. In the commercial sphere the articles of the old treaties which are left untouched in the present draft convention afford sufficient scope for bargaining if His Majesty’s Government desire to conclude a new agreement. The draft convention has left aside, as being of a commercial nature, articles 19 to 36 of the General Treaty of 1856 with Morocco, articles 1 to 12 of the Commercial Convention of 1856 with Morocco, the preamble to the Act of Algeciras of 1906 and articles 66 to 69, 71, 73, 74, 77 to 101 and 105 to 119 of that Act as well as the Franco- German Convention of 1911. Similarly, in the case of Zanzibar, the draft convention leaves aside articles 10 to 17 of the French Treaty of 1844 of Muscat. In the latter case His Majesty’s Government have in the past adopted the attitude that the limitation laid down in the Muscat Treaty on rates of customs duties is to be considered as superseded as regards Tanzibar by the St. Germain Convention of 1919 and have given practical effect to this view, although the French Government have never specifically admitted it. 6. ir.

H -.ith reference to Foreign Office despatch No. 161 of the 14th September in which you were renuested to forward suggestions, supplementary to the information previously furnished to this department as mentioned in paragraph 3 of the above-mentioned despatch, in regard to the terms for the renunciation by the United Kingdom of their capitulatory privileges in Morocco, I am directed by ■h o secretary T.den to draw attention to certain particular points on which your opinion is invited. 2 o Assuming that the United Kingdom surrender in Morocco (i) the jurisdiction of British consular courts, (n) the non-aoplication of Shereefian legislation to British subjects unless a King’s Regulation is issued - which constitute the two aspects of the capitulations, j am to ennuire what provisions you consider a convention with France should contain in resrect of (a) jurisdictional measures (b) further safeguards for equality of treatment. o. As regards (a) it should no doubt be stipulated that British subjects and protected persons must be subject to the same courts as -reach citizens. it seems necessary also to consider the question of reserving consular jurisdiction in questions of 'personal status 11 for a period of years equal to that in which this jurisdiction is reserved in Egypt if this reservation , Hurst, Esq., e ^ c ° ? etc., etc. , Rabat. etc. ,, v\ reservation is agreed to in the Egyptian capitulations discussions.. ^Personal status” includes matrimonial causes, inheritance, guardianship of 1 children, legitimacy and other matters of family lav/. Moreover, as regards the possible effect of the surrender of capitulatory rights in conferring Prench nationality upon certain British subjects and British protected persons who do not at present acquire it, T am to refer to the documents mentioned in paragraph 3 of the above-mentioned despatch and also to the correspondence ending with Poreign Office despatch No. 138 of the 22nd duly and to enquire whether you have any suggestions to offer. m he effect of the Prench nationality decree of the 8th November 1921 would appear to have the effect of conferring Prench nationality on the children born in Morocco of a British father who was born in Morocco v/here the child was born after the surrender of British capitulatory rights. In this connexion it might be reasonable to ask for assurances:- d'': that the French decree of 1921 should only be applied to persons born after the date of the renunciation; (ii) that the Prench Government will not go beyond the terms of this decree in imposing Prench or Moroccan nationality on British subjects and British protected persons by reason of birth or residence in Morocco. 4. As regards (b) it is a question whether it will be possible to obtain further concessions from the Prench Government unless His Majesty's Government are prepared to offer counter concessions in respect of the 12^ ad valorem limit * fjf / limit for customs duties. m the present circumstances, it is essential for the purposes of the policy of His Majesty's f-overnment with regard to Egypt, that the french Government should have no reasonable ground for refusing to agree to the proposals which the Egyptian Government with the support of His Majesty's Government will be proposing with regard to the capitulations in Egypt (see Article 13 of the Treaty of Alliance with Egypt and its annex, copy of which is enclosed herewith). If His Majesty's Government refused to agree to renounce their capitulatory rights in Morocco the French Government would have a reasonable ground and the renunciation of french capitulatory rights in Sgyot will, perforce, become the cm id pro quo for the renunciation of British capitulatory rights m Morocco. Since the French Government have this lever, it would not be possible to hold out for further guarantees as regards trade in return merely for the disappearance of British capitulatory rights in Morocco as it might have been if the renunciation had taken place in other circumstances. 5. M r . hden realises that the questions of the maximum customs duty and equality of treatment in commerce are not, strictly speaking, involved in the matter of capitulations, though there is, of course, a de facto connexion and it remains for subseouent decision, dependent to some extent on the attitude of the french Government, whether it will be advisable to enter upon negotiations, in the first instance, solely on the basis of capitulatory rights as such, leaving the question of trade and taxation on a footing of non-discrimination in exchange for concessions by His Majesty's Government on the maximum customs duty for separate and subsequentsubseouent discussion, or whether an endeavour should be made to connect these problems. Go hr. Oden will be glad to receive an early expression of your views on the above-mentioned despatch and on the points raised in the present despatch in the light of the changed conditions and having regard to the possibility that His ‘ajesty’s Government may be approached, in the matter by the French Government at an early date, thus necessitating the opening of negotiations either prior to the conference on Egyptian capitulations next spring, or during the course of that conference. It would be proposed to make the coming in force of the Agreement surrendering British capitulatory rights in Horocco simultaneous with the French ratification of the Egyptian capitulations convention. 7o finally, I am to enquire whether you consider it possible to consult members of the British Chamber of Commerce at Casablanca and to explain the position to that body confidentially and without risk of leakage. If there is the slightest danger of a breach of confidence, the communication to the Chamber must be postponed until a later date. 3.

Sir, Foreign Office, September 14, 1936. I AM directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to inform you that the treaty of alliance between the LTnited Kingdom and Egypt, signed at London on the 26th August, 1936, copy of which is enclosed herewith^ 1 ) contains, in article 13 and annex thereto, provisions regarding the eventual abolition of Capitulations in Egypt, and it is probable that in due course the French Government will take the opportunity to invoke article 2 of the secret articles annexed to the declaration between the United Kingdom and France of the 8th April, 1904, respecting Egypt and Morocco, and claim the surrender of British capitulatory rights in the French Zone of Morocco. In that event, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom must be prepared to enter into negotiations with the French Government. It is almost inevitable, moreover, that the surrender of British capitulatory rights in the French Zone will involve their surrender in the Spanish Zone. 2. A copy of a report of a preliminary meeting between the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade, which was held on the 8th July to discuss the attitude to be adopted by His Majesty’s Government, is enclosed for your confidential information. 3. Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 51 of the 19th March, 1930, Mr. Edmond’s memorandum of the 28th October, 1932,( 2 ) Mr. Gurney’s despatch No. 57 of the 27th March, 1930, and Mr. Gardener’s memorandum of March 1933( 3 ) contain valuable suggestions with regard to possible safeguards in return for the surrender of British special privileges in the French and Spanish Zones. I am to request that you will submit as soon as possible any further observations which you consider should be borne in mind in formulating the terms for the renunciation of capitulatory privileges in Morocco. 4. Mr. Eden has not lost sight of the fact that an undertaking has been given to consult the British Chamber of Commerce at Casablanca when the question comes up for discussion with the French Government, but he considers that such consultation is premature at the moment, and he would prefer to postpone it until a later stage. 5. A similar despatch has been addressed to the acting British consul- general at Tangier. I am, &amp;c. P. LEIGH-SMITH. [W 6735/5962/28] Enclosure. Report of Meeting between Representatives of Foreign Office and Board of Trade on July 8, 1936. IN accordance with 7 (b) of Cabinet Conclusions 48 (36) of the 1st July, 1936, a meeting was held at the Foreign Office on the 8th July, under the chairmanship of Sir George Mounsey, between representatives of the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade to discuss the attitude to be adopted in the event of France proposing the abolition of British special rights in Morocco, should the treaty negotiations with Egypt cover the question of Capitulations. (1) C.M.D. 5270 . ( 2 ) “ Further correspondence respecting Morocco,” Part 70 , No. 26 . ( 3 ) “ Further correspondence respecting Morocco,” Part 71 , No. 28 . [812 o—llArticle 2 of the secret articles attached to the declaration of the 8th April, 1904, between the United Kingdom and France respecting Egypt and Morocco runs:— £t In the event of their (His Majesty’s Government) considering it desirable to introduce into Egypt reforms tending to assimilate the Egyptian legislative system to that in force in other civilised countries, the Government of the French Republic will not refuse to entertain any such proposals on the understanding that His Britannic Majesty’s Government will agree to entertain (the French text uses the term ‘ examiner ’) the suggestions that the Government of the French Republic may have to make to them with a view to introducing similar reforms in Morocco.” This article, it will be observed, refers to reforms introduced into Egypt by His Majesty’s Government. In present circumstances, it will, of course, be the Egyptian Government who will introduce the reforms, the action of His Majesty’s Government being limited to the use of their good offices in securing the assent of the other Powers. Further, according to the French text of the article, His Majesty’s Government undertake to “examiner” (which is rendered in the English text by “ entertain ”) any suggestions of the French Government. Although it may be necessary to obtain legal opinion on the obligations of His Majesty’s Government under the article, the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade are nevertheless doubtful whether it would be possible not to enter into negotiations with the French Government if the latter demand them, in the eventuality envisaged by the Cabinet, on the basis of the disappearance in Morocco of existing special British privileges. It is almost inevitable, also, that a claim by France of this nature in respect of the French Zone of Morocco would be followed by a similar claim by Spain in respect of the Spanish Zone. The special rights of His Majesty’s Government in Morocco cover consular jurisdiction and personal rights. (i) Consular Jurisdiction. —By certain articles of the United Kingdom General Treaty of 1856 with Morocco, British subjects, as defendants, are only amenable to the British consular courts and are immune from the local jurisdiction. Moreover, by article 4 of the same treaty, British subjects ££ shall not be obliged to pay, under any pretext whatever, any taxes or impositions.” Consequently, no tax not covered by treaty provisions can legally be levied on British subjects unless His Majesty’s Government have agreed to the tax, and a King’s Regulation, under the Morocco Orders in Council, has been issued making it applicable to British subjects. Payment of the tax can only be enforced by proceedings in a British consular court. (ii) Semsar and Mokhalat {Local British Proteges) System. —Semsars are natives in Morocco appointed as agents of British firms. Mokhalats are registered employees of British subjects. (iii) British Post Offices in Morocco. —As regards consular jurisdiction, these rights are possessed only by the United Kingdom and the United States, all other foreign nationals being amenable to the French courts; it is considered that British subjects would find a fairly satisfactory substitute in the French courts. In the matter of personal taxation, we should no doubt endeavour to provide for national and most-favoured-nation treatment. It is not considered that the abolition of semsars and mokhalats would be a serious loss to British trade. The disappearance of the British postal service is also not considered to be a matter of great importance, as there is now a good local postal service. The L T nited Kingdom Commercial Treaty of 1856 contains a provision that no import duty higher than 10 per cent, ad valorem is to be charged on goods imported by British subjects, a provision which also appears in the Spanish treaty with Morocco of 1861; other countries possess the benefit of this provision by virtue of most-favoured-nation treatment. This flat rate of 10 per cent, is increased by an additional 2^ per cent, under article 66 of the Act of Algeciras. This restriction on Morocco’s tariff autonomy is resented by the French Govern ment and the French Protectorate authorities, and the French Government will no doubt take the first opportunity to claim a modification. We should probably be prepared in this matter to agree to a reasonable non-discriminatory increase in tariff, but claiming in return concessions in other directions. It is also, possible that the consent of the other Algeciras Powers may be required for any alteration of the existing customs regime.As already stated, the opinion of the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade is that, if the French Government put forward a demand under article 2 of the secret articles of the 1904 declaration, Flis Majesty’s Government would probably not be in a position to refuse to enter into negotiations. It is generally agreed that our consular jurisdiction and personal rights in Morocco are not in themselves of particular importance, but that they afford a very valuable safeguard against discriminatory acts by the French Protectorate, and their disappearance might well pave the way for the loss of our commercial rights also. It is because the French have to bear in mind the special position of British subjects that they cannot attack our trade as much as they would like to. The United Kingdom export trade with Morocco has seriously diminished in the last few years, more especially, as a result of Japanese competition, in the case of cotton exports, and it is realised that it will be exceedingly difficult to frame new treaty provisions so as to prevent still further inroads on British trade. Once we lose our position of special privilege our trade in French Morocco, worth about £1,240,000 in 1933 and £750,000 in 1935 (these figures include Tangier), will almost certainly proceed to dwindle even further. Until some idea is obtained of what the French demands are likely to be, it is hardly practicable at the moment to indicate in any detail what our own attitude should be. Generally speaking, it will probably have to be on the lines of framing non-discriminatory provisions as favourably as possible. The principle of economic liberty without inequality is enshrined in the preamble to the Act of Algeciras, and this Act cannot be modified without the assent of all the parties, but that principle cannot be regarded as a sufficient safeguard, since it will always be open to the French to impose high duties on goods of particular interest to the United Kingdom. The Foreign Office and the Board of Trade are agreed that it should be left to the French Government to make the first move in the matter of the surrender of our special rights in Morocco.~~% 1 ' 'v '« oqpy.

Memorandum respecting the A ttitude to he adopted in the event of Renewed Demands by the French Government for the Surrender of the Capitulations in Morocco. ^ OUR extra-territorial rights in Morocco are based on the General Treaty with the Sultan of 1856 and consist for practical purposes of the following main privileges :— (1) Immunity of British subjects from the local jurisdiction (mainly articles 8, 9 and 14( 1 )). (2) Immunity of British subjects from local taxation (article 4( 1 )). (3) Extra-territorial privileges for consular officers (article 3). [There are also privileges for protected persons—Mokhalats and Semsars. But we do not now attach any material value to these. The same may be said to some extent of our right to operate a postal service.] In addition to our extra-territorial rights proper we have certain important commercial rights, principally :— (1) A fixed maximum rate of duty for goods imported by British subjects of 12^ per cent, (article 7 of the Commercial Convention of 1856 and article 66 of the Act of Algeciras). (2) The general guarantee of commercial equality and economic liberty (articles 1 and 5 of Commercial Convention, article 4 of Anglo-French Declaration of 1904, article 4 of Franco-German Convention of 1911 and the preamble of the Act of Algeciras). The extent of our rights under this heading is not accurately defined, e.g., it is doubtful whether we are entitled in all respects to national as well as most-favoured nation treatment. These rights in Morocco are, however, more important than those conferred by the usual most-favoured-nation treaties since they entitle us in any case to equal treatment with the French and the Spaniards in their respective zones. (3) Adjudications : public contracts to be put up to open tender (articles 66, 74 and 105-111 of the Act of Algeciras and article 6 of the Franco- German Convention of 1911). II. All the above rights( 2 ) were acquired by agreements between us and the Sultan of Morocco. In 1912 the French established a protectorate over the greater part of Morocco (the French Zone), and became responsible for the foreign relations of Morocco and also, practically speaking, for the administration of the country. Since then they have made several attempts to induce us to give up our extra-territorial rights, which are irksome to them and, with the establishment of French courts and a French-controlled Administration, are more or less an anachronism. Their grounds for pressing us are :— (1) Arguments connected with the Anglo-French Declaration of 1904 con cerning Egypt and Morocco : Article 2 of the secret articles attached to the declaration states :— “His Britannic Majesty’s Government have no present intention of proposing to the Powers any changes in the system of the Capitulations, or in the judicial organisation of Egypt. ( 1 ) These immunities are not absolute: e.g., British subjects sue as plaintiffs in the local courts; certain local taxes are by treaty applicable to British subjects, and, in practice, the bulk of local taxation is applied to them by King’s Begulation. The immunity of British subjects from the jurisdiction of the local courts and from the operation of the local law, has the important effect of precluding the application to them of the French decree and the Moroccan dahir of the 8 th November, 1921 , on the subject of nationality in Morocco, and preventing their acquisition of French or Moroccan nationality if born in Morocco of a father or mother born there (see “ Further Correspondence respecting Morocco,” Part 70 , No. 26 , paragraph 12 ). ( 2 ) Apart from those under the Franco-German Convention of 1911 . 7333 [62 o—2] B‘ 1 In the event of their considering it desirable to introduce in Egypt reforms tending to assimilate the Egyptian legislative system( J ) to that in force in other civilised countries, the Government of the French Republic will not refuse to entertain any such proposals, on the understanding that His Britannic Majesty’s Government will agree to entertain the suggestions that the Government of the French Republic may have to make to them with a view of introducing similar reforms in Morocco.” The abolition of the Capitulations in Morocco was contemplated in connexion with projected judicial reforms in Egypt and a draft convention was prepared in 1919 providing for the surrender by us of our extra-territorial rights in Morocco in return for the French consent to abandon their similar rights in Egypt. The scheme for the abolition of the Capitulations in Egypt subsequently fell through and the proposed convention was not proceeded with. However, in 1922 His Majesty’s Government, in informing the French Government that they took note of the latter’s recognition of the termination of their protectorate over Egypt, added that His Majesty’s Government remained ready, if and when the Capitulations were abolished in Egypt, to acquiesce in the abolition in the French Zone of Morocco. It is understood that we still contemplate sooner or later concluding a treaty with Egypt which would include an undertaking by us to assist in obtaining the consent of the Powers concerned to the abolition of the Capitulations. If and when in pursuance of such an undertaking we ask the French to agree to the abolition of the Capitulations in Egypt, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to resist their demands as regards Morocco, if they consent as regards Egypt. (2) Article 4 of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1904 contains a clause providing for termination, after thirty years by one year’s notice, failing which the period is to be extended for five years at a time. It was suggested that the French might give notice under this clause in April of year with a view to demanding the termination of the Capitulations in Morocco irrespective of the position in Egypt. They did not do so. In any case there does not appear to be anything in this point: (i) it seems obvious that the clause with regard to termination applies only to article 4 (commercial provisions) and has nothing to do with the article concerning the Capitulations; (ii) even if the French could and did denounce the declaration we would not for that reason be obliged to agree to give up the Capitulations in Morocco. What we maintain is that under the secret article the French cannot require to give them up in Morocco till they are abolished in Egypt. But the French do not, in any case, admit this. (3) Article 9 of the Franco-German Convention of 1911 (to which His Majesty’s Government have acceded) :— 4 4 In order to avoid, as far as possible, diplomatic representations, the French Government will urge the Moorish Government to refer to an arbi trator .... complaints brought by foreign subjects against the Moorish authorities 4 4 This mode of procedure shall remain in force until such times as a judicial system founded on the general principles embodied in the legislation of the Powers interested, shall have been introduced, which shall ultimately, by agreement between those Powers, replace the consular courts.” In 1922, in reply to His Majesty’s Government’s statement of their position mentioned under (1) above, the French Government took up the attitude that, irrespective of the position in Egypt, we were bound to agree to the abolition of the Capitulations in Morocco in virtue of the introduction of the judicial system contemplated in the above article. We replied that the article in question was not an agreement for the suppression of the Capitulations, but provided a means for dealing with claims by foreigners during the period before the establishment of the new system. (Although this is no doubt correct, the article seems to imply recognition of the principle that the establishment of a satisfactory judicial system would lead to the abolition of the Capitulations.) (4) The status of Tangier. At one point in the correspondence we had implied that we could not consider the modification of the position in Morocco ( 3 ) It appears from the French text that this is intended to refer only to legislation affecting the Capitulation's and the judicial organisation.pending the internationalisation of Tangier.( 4 ) Accordingly on the adoption of the otatute of the Tangier Zone the French reopened the question and renewed then suggestion that His Majesty’s Government should abandon their capitu- ri ^ ts French Zone in view of the internationalisation of Tangier. v\ hen we refused they threatened recourse to arbitration. They are clearly doubtful of their chances of success, since, when we accepted the proposal of arbitration, they let the matter drop. (5) In his despatch No. 23 of the 27th February last Mr. Edmonds suggested that the subjugation of the Atlas might afford the French a pretext for reopening the question of the Capitulations. This has just been completed and the French may soon be able to claim that the whole of Morocco is under the control of an efficient Administration and that the maintenance of the Capitulations is there fore an anomaly. (6) All the other Powers except ourselves and the United States have already given up their extra-territorial rights. This was usually done by a unilateral declaration taking note of the judicial equality offered to foreigners by the French courts. The rights of the United States are dependent on our own, being enjoyed under the terms of a simple most-favoured-nation treaty. To sum up, Mr. Edmonds has expressed the opinion that we shall shortly have to meet further pressure from the French to abandon or at least modify the Capitulations. In that event they will be able to put up a fairly strong case on the general ground that the circumstances which the system was designed to meet have^ disappeared and that the maintenance of it is an unreasonable impedi ment to the internal administration of Morocco; and they will point to (a) the completion of the pacification of the country; (b) the establishment of an Adminis tration which, as far as is known, cannot be maintained to be substantially inferior to general colonial standards; (r) the fact that all other European Powers have already given up their extra-territorial rights. Whether they would succeed in an arbitration against us seems uncertain. We have our definite rights under the 1856 treaty, and the Erench do not seem able to point to any treaty obligation on our part to terminate them, except in case of the Capitulations being abolished in Egypt. On the other hand, we cannot presumably claim to retain rights of this kind under a treaty which contains no revision clause for ever. The French case and their pressure may therefore be expected to grow stronger as time goes on even if the eventual abolition of the Capitulations in Egypt should not cut the ground from under our feet. III. In view of the likelihood that the French would reopen the question, steps were taken to estimate (cl) the advantage to us of retaining the Capitulations, and (b) what safeguards or compensations we should try to obtain if we agree to renounce them. Memoranda were furnished by Mr. Edmonds at Rabat and Mr. Gardiner at Tetuan.( 5 ) The position, as it appears in these memoranda, may be summed up as follows:—( 6 ) 1 1 (1) British Subjects. The British community in Morocco is unimportant (amounting to 2,000 or 3,000, of whom only 200 or 300 are from the ETiited Kingdom), and would not be seriously affected personally by the loss of extra-territorial rights. (2) British Trade. Our trade in the French Zone would be squeezed out almost entirely were it not for our special privileges. Of these, the most important are :— (a) The 12-| per cent, maximum rate of duty. {b) The provisions regarding commercial equality and adjudications. Neither of these need necessarily be surrendered if we were to abandon our extra-territorial rights as regards jurisdiction and taxation. But while these ( 4 ) See “ Further Correspondence respecting Morocco,” Part 51, Enclosure in No. 86. ( 5 ) “ Further Correspondence respecting Morocco,” Part 70, No. 26 and Part 71, No. 22. ( 6 ) The following paragraphs are based on Mr. Edmond’s conclusions: Mr. Gardiner states generally that the same considerations apply in the Spanish Zone and concurs in Mr. Edmond’s recommendations. In any case our policy with regard to the Capitulations in the Spanish Zone must follow that adopted for the French Zone, where our interests are far more important. If we surrender any of our rights in the French Zone we shall have to do the same in the Spanish, but not unless.

Mr. Edmonds thinks we could ask a high price. • + ^ wro l te .^ a y ^ ast to Board of Trade and proposed that an in er-departmental meeting should be held on this subject, having in mind at that ime the possibility that we might make use of the surrender of our rights in Morocco as a make-weight in some general commercal agreement with France. A meeting was ultimately held on the 21st September between representatives of the Foreign Office, Board of Trade, India Office, Colonial Office, Dominions Office and Department of Overseas Trade, with Mr. Edmonds also present. • - e ^ ard objected strongly to the idea of bargaining with our lights m Morocco, fhey pointed out that, even if it were possible to obtain counter-concessions of an equivalent value in return for what we should lose bv giving up our privileged position in Morocco (where they estimate our trade provisionally as worth £2 million a year), they would find it impossible to defend politically the principle involved in sacrificing the interests of one group of British subjects (those trading with Morocco) in return for advantages to be granted to others. If it were a question of covenanting for concessions of a political nature m return for the surrender of the Capitulations in Morocco, the Board would, of course, take into consideration the views of the Departments concerned as to the value of such concessions. For the reasons stated, however they would consider such a solution objectionable in principle. The Board of Trade also endorsed very definitely Mr. Edmonds’s view as to the importance of our extra-territorial rights proper (consular courts and immunity trom local taxation) in maintaining our trading position in Morocco Both they and Mr. Edmonds were firmly convinced that once we lost our extra territorial rights, it would only be a matter of time before the French authorities round means to squeeze our trade out of Morocco as effectively as has been done f °r instance, in Syria. Mr. Edmonds explained that, put crudely, the position was that the only thing which prevented the French from discrimmating against oui tiade more than they did, and enabled us to some extent to insist on the observance of our commercial privileges, was the knowledge that we had it in our power to make trouble by refusing to apply local legislation to British subjects. Neither the Board of Trade nor Mr. Edmonds therefore attach any material importance to the possibility that, if we were willing to bargain now for the abolition of our extra-territorial rights, we might be able to obtain on paper the reaffirmation of our present privileged position in commercial matters The Department of Overseas Trade supported the views of the Board of Trade and Mr. Edmonds as regards the probable effect on our trade of the surrender of extra-territoriality. The Board of Trade further expressed considerable doubt as to whether it would, m fact, be possible, if we once agreed to the revision of our treaty rights m Morocco, to insist on the retention of such exceptional commercial privilegesD as the 12^ per cent, maximum for import duties. Both they and the Colonial Office are of the opinion that this latter provision, just as much as the system of extra-territorial jurisdiction, can be represented as an obsolete restriction on the autonomy of the Moroccan administration. They doubt if the French authorities HO''^d be induced to reaffirm it. They suggested that similar provisions in old ^i^Mies had before now been held by legal authorities to be inapplicable. The Board of Trade therefore see no advantages in any of the three courses proposed except the first, namely, to insist upon the maintenance of the status quo as long as possible. They do not overlook the fact that, if we are forced later on to abandon our rights in Morocco, we shall probably not be able, as we might be now, to obtain any quid fro quo for their surrender. Their view as regards this possibility is that, in the first place, the respite given to British trade in Morocco would, they hope, have contributed so far to strengthening our position in the market; and secondly that, in any case, even if the loss of our trade can only be postponed for a number of years that will be so much to the good. If we are forced later on to give way to the French demands we shall not at any rate be open to the criticism that we should incur if we surrendered our privileges voluntarily before we were obliged to, whether in return for counter-concessions or not. A further point made in favour of course (A) was that, if we were to give up our extra-territorial rights in Morocco in return for counter-concessions before the question of the Capitulations in Egypt is finally disposed of, the French Government might legitimately claim to be relieved of their obligation under secret article 2 of the declaration of 1904 and might later raise difficulties with regard to judicial reforms in Egypt. It would, therefore, in any case, be necessary to obtain as part of any settlement regarding Morocco, an assurance that the French would agree, when the time came, to the abolition of the Capitulations in Egypt. This would, of course, reduce our bargaining powers in other directions. As regards the views of the other Departments concerned, the position of the Colonial Office is that they would raise no objection to the abolition of the Capitulations from the point of view of the British subjects of colonial origin who form the majority of the British community in Morocco. In principle, they would be glad to see the provisions of the Moroccan treaties modified. They made the point with regard to the 12^ per cent, tariff that we were being much embarrassed ourselves by the terms of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 regarding the duties to be levied on Dutch shipping in the East Indies, and they would like to see His Majesty’s Government adopt the attitude that the provisions of such old treaties were inapplicable at the present date. If the treaty position in Morocco were to be brought up to date, they would look for the termination of certain old treaties affecting Muscat and Zanzibar (they do not attach much importance to this as the treaties are to some extent a dead letter, but they thought it desirable that the position should be regularised). They would also hope that it might be possible to obtain most-favoured-nation treatment in France for our colonial produce. The India Office have put forward suggestions in the past that territorial ( adjustments in India should be sought as the price of our surrender of the I Capitulations in Morocco. They did not, however, press these suggestions at | the meeting in view of the general opinion against surrendering our rights at the present time, but merely stated that they would like them to be considered if I there should be any question of obtaining counter-concessions from the French later on. They have since pointed out that the principle underlying the more important desiderata put forward by the Government of India in the past has been, not so much the acquisition 'of territory at the expense of the French settlements in India, as the power to exercise police jurisdiction over British subjects in foreign enclaves, which provide “cities of refuge” for political agitators and terrorists from British India. In the opinion of the India Office | it might be argued that a claim to exercise such jurisdiction over British subjects j in French territory in circumstances where it can be shown to be of substantial practical value to a neighbouring Administration is an appropriate demand to make in response to a French claim that we should abandon extra-territorial privileges in a territory where, under modern conditions, their maintenance is an anachronism. As a result of the decided views expressed by the Board of Trade and Mr. Edmonds the conclusion was generally accepted that we should confine ourselves for the time being to course (A), and that there was therefore no use in considering further the possibilities of counter-concessions.6 e o In the circumstances, there is nothing further to be done at present with regard to this question, but to await the next move from the French Government. If and when they reopen the question, we must presumably ignore, as far as possible, any arguments based on the reasonable claims of the French administra tion m Morocco to be freed of obsolete servitudes and stand uncompromisi^m^ ^ on our treaty rights. Our position in this respect is fairly strong, m that rights are clearly laid down in the treaties, and there is, as far as we know, nothing which definitely commits us to giving them up at any specific date prior to the abolition of the Capitulations in Egypt. This attitude may be hard to reconcile with the liberal policy which we have adopted elsewhere, but the I rench are scarcely entitled to press very far an appeal to liberal principles; and it may be hoped that they will continue to obscure the real strength of their moral case, as they have done hitherto, by hair-splitting arguments on the interpreta tion of the treaties. It is, of course, possible that the French may return to then suggestion of arbitration. If they do, our legal advisers see no reason why we should not accept the challenge. If for any reason the position in this respect should change and it should be considered that our case was not strong enough to risk an arbitration, the whole situation would be altered, for the pohticai objection to bargaining for the surrender of our privileges on which the Board of Trade principally insist, would decrease if not disappear, and the whole question would have to be reconsidered. Nevertheless, it must be recognised that our position is morally weak and will weaken progressively as conditions of civilisation in Morocco improve, and it seems inherent in the nature of the case that we shall sooner or later find a non 'possumus attitude untenable. It is therefore perhaps desirable that we should not lose sight entirely of the alternative courses (B) and (C). As regards (B), we must accept as decisive, as far as anything can be decisive, the considered views of the Board of Trade and our consular authorities that any modification of our present privileges would involve inevitably the loss of our trading position in Morocco and that little importance would attach to any written safeguards we might be able to obtain for our commercial privileges if once the extra-territorial position is modified. As regards (C), it is doubtful whether, if we are to hold on to the Capitu lations until we find our position untenable, we shall be able to obtain much in the way of outside compensation for their surrender (bearing in mind the necessity of insisting on an assurance as regards the Capitulations in Egypt). If, however, we have not been forced by circumstances to give way before then, it might be worth while to review the question before the end of 1935 when the Statute of Tangier may be coming up for revision, since this is a question (in the view of the C.I.D. one of considerable importance) on which we might reasonably hope to obtain some concessions to our point of view on the part of the French and Spanish Governments as part of a general revision of the treaty position in Morocco including the surrender of our extra-territorial rights. On the other hand, His Majesty’s consul-general at Tangier, who has been consulted, is not in favour on general grounds of making any connexion between the question of the surrender of our extra-territorial rights in Morocco and that of the revision of the Tangier Statute; and it would probably be unwise to make any reference to the Capitulations in the course of eventual negotiations over the statute unless- their abolition is actually under discussion with the French Government.

IX and XIV 35 ) o Immunity of British subjects from local- taxation; {Article IV *) 8 3* Extraterritorial privileges for Consular officers (Article III)* /There are also privileges for protected person© - iiokhaiats and Semear©* But we do not now attach any material value to these® The same may be said to some extent of our right to operate a postal service 7 « In addition to our extraterritorial right© propel 6 we have certain important commercial rights * principally: 3L A fixed maximum rate of duty for good© im ported by British subjects of 12Jh {Article VII of the Commercial Convention of 1856 and Article 66 ©f the Act of Algeeiras)» 2o The general guarantee of 'ccmmerciaX equality and economic liberty” (Article© I and VI of Commercial Convention* Article- 4 of Anglo-French Declaration of 1904* Article 4 O X &amp; d o ' These immunities are not absolute: e^g* British subjects sue aa plaintiffs in the local courts; certain local taxes are by treaty applicable to British subjects* and in practice the bulk of local texation is applied to them by King 5 © Regulation®of Franco-Oemaa Convention of 1911) * Tlw extent of our rights under this heading is not accurately defined* e*g* it is doubtful whether we are entitled in all respects to national as well as most favoured-nation treatment* These rights in Morocco are however more Important than those conferred by the usual most-favoured nation treaties since they entitle us in any case to equal treatment with the French and the Spaniards in their respective zonee* 3 a Adjudication©: public contracts to be put up to open tender (Article© 74 and 105-111 of the Act of Algeeira©). XI* All the above rights were acquired by agreements between u© and the Sultan of Morocco,, In 1912 the French established a Protectorate over the gref.ter part of Morocco (the French Zone ) ? and became responsible for the foreign relations of Morocco and also practically speaking for the administration of the country,, Since then they have made several attempts to induce us to give up our extraterritorial rights? which are irkscme to them andj. with the establishment of French courts and a French-con- trolled administration? are more or less an anachronism* Their grounds for pressing us are:- (1) Arguments connected with the Anglo-French Declara tion of 1904 concerning Egypt and Morocco: Article 2 of the Secret articles attached to the Declaration states; 'His Britannic Majesty’s Government have no !? present intention of proposing to Powers any ^changes in the system of the Capitulations? or in ,E the judicial organisation of Egypt* 'In the event of their considering it desirable 'to introduce in Egypt reforms tending to assimilate ?t the Egyptian legislative system 35 to that in force 55 It appears from the French text that %his is intended to' refer only to legislation affecting the capitula tions and the judicial organisation,.by«*.♦ 'in other civilised countries* the Government of 'the French Republic will not refuse to entertain any 'such proposals, on the understanding that His ^ 'Britannic Majesty’s Government will agree to enter- * 'tain the suggestions that the Government of the 'French Republic j;iay have to malce to them with a view 'of introducing similar reforms in Morocco'* The abolition of the Capitulations in Morocco was contemplated in connexion with projected judicial reforma in Egypt and a draft convention was prepared in 1919 pro« vidlng for the surrender by us of our extraterritorial right© in Morocco In return for the French consent to abandon their similar rights in Egypto The scheme for the abolition of the Capitulations in Egypt subsequently iell through and the proposed convention was not proceeded with* However in 1923 Hie Majesty* s Governments, in informing the French Government that they took note of the latter's recog nition of the termination of their protectorate over Egypt* added that His Majesty^s Government remained ready 9 if and when the capitulations were abolished in Egypt p to acquiesce in their abolition in the French Zone of Morocco* It is understood that v/e still contemplate sooner or later concluding a treaty with Egypt which would include an undertaking by us to assist in obtaining the consent of the Powers concerned to the abolition of the Capitulations* If and when in oursuance of such an undertaking we ask the French to agree to the abolition of the capitulation© In E^rpt it 7/01 be difficult if not impossible to resist their demands as regards Morocco, (2) Article 4 of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1904 contains a clause providing for ternlnaticn ? after 30 year©t&gt;y 1 year*8 notice s failing which the period is to he extended for 5 year© at a time* It wes suggested ^ that the French might give notice under this clause in April of this year with a view to demanding the termination of the Capitulations in Morocco irrespective of the position in Fgyptc They did not do so* In any ease there doe© not appear to he anything in this point: (l) it seems obvious that the clause with regaid to termination applies only to Article 4 (Commercial provisions) and has nothing to do with the Article concerning the capitula tion©; (ii) even if the French could and did denounce the Declaration we would not for that reason he obliged to agree to give up the capitulation© in Morocco* What we maintain is that under the Secret Article the French cannot ask q© to give them up in Morocco till trey are abolished in Egypt* But the French do not in any case admit this (And the Article doe© not seem to give us very strong ground for the contention 3 especially si ace our protector- ate has been terminated)« (3) Article 9 of the Franeo-German Convention of X91X» {to which Hie Majesty’@ Government have acceded): u In order to avoid 9 as far as possible?

the French Government took up the attitude that,, irrespect ive of the position in Fgyptj we were bound to agree to the abolition of the capitulations in Morocco in virtue of the introduction of the judicial system contemplated in the above article,. We replied that the article in question was not an agreement for the suppression of the capitulations but provided a means for dealing with claims by foreigners during the period before the establishment of the new system^ (Although this is no doubt correct £ the article seems to imply recognition of the principle that the establishment of a satisfactory judicial system would lead to the abolition of the capitulations) a (4) The statue of Tangier, At one point in the corres pondence we had implied that we could not consider the modification of the position in Morocco pending the inter nationalisation of Tangier* 1 * Accordingly on the adoption of the Statute of the Tangier Zone the French reopened the question and renewed their suggestion that His Majesty’© Government should abandon their capitulatory' rights in the French Zone In view of the internationalisation of Tangier* When we refused they threatened recourse to arbitration* They are clearly doubtful of their chances of success since when we accepted the proposal of arbitration they let the matter drop* (5) In his despatch No,-23 of 2?th February last Mx*o Kdmonde suggested that the subjugation of the At la© might *,* % Bee Foreign Office memorandum of 22ncl June 1922 (W 4611/197/28/1922).under » o o o might afford the French a pretext for re-opening the Question of the capitulations* This has just been completed, and the French may soon be able to claim that the whole of Morocco is under the control ©f an efficient administration and that the maintenance of the Capitulation® is therefore an anomaly* oj All the other power® except ourselve© and the United .States have already gl^en up their extraterritorial rights* This was usually done by a unilateral declaration taking note of u th« judicial equality offered to foreigner© by the French courted The rights of the United State© are dependent on our own* being enjoyed under the terms of a simple most“favoured-nation treaty* To sum up P Mr. Edmond© has expressed the opinion -n.a we shall shortly have to meet further pressure from the French to abandon or at least modify the capitulation©* In that event they will be able to put up a fairly strong case on the general ground that the circumstances which the system was designed to meet have disappeared and that the maintenance of it is an unreasonable impediment to the internal administration of Morocco; and they will point to (a) the completion of the pacification of the country; (b) the establishment of an administration which B as far as i known # cannot be maintained to be substantially inferior to general colonial standard©; (e) the fact that all other European Powers have already given up their extraterritorial rights* I/he the r they would succeed In an arbitration against us seems uncertain* We have our definite right©under the 1856 Treaty and the French do not seem able to ^ point to any treaty obligation on our part to terminate them &amp; except in case of the Capitulations being abolished in Egypt* On the other hand we cannot presumably claim to retain rights of this kind under a treaty which contains no revision clause for ever* The French case and their pressure may therefore be expected to grow stronger as time goeg on even if the eventual abolition of the eapitulationg in Egypt should not cut the ground from under our feeto IIIo In view of the likelihood that the French would re-open the question steps were taken to estimate (a) the advantage to us of retaining the capitulations and (b) what safeguards or compensations we should try to obtain if v/e agree to renounce them a Memoranda were furnished by Mr* Edmonds at Rabat and Mr. Gardiner at Tetuan The position as it appears in these memoranda may be summed up as follows:- ^ X* B riti sh Subjects* g*gjgr»gie» inii u , n a—» m il ——slfc— mu M m The British community in Morocco ie unimportant (amounting to 2^000 or 3*000 of whom only 200 or 300 ©re from the United Kingdom); and would not be seriously affected personally by the loss of extraterritorial rights* ^ W 12432/12432/28/1932 and W 3011/3011/28/1933* ^ The following paragraphs are based on Mr* Kdmond f s conclu sions =, Mr. Gardiner states generally that the same considera tions apoly in the Spanish Zone and concurs in Mr* Edmond’s re commendations. In any case our policy with regard to the caoi- taxations in the Spanish Zone must follow that adopted for the .French Zone p where our interest© are far more import ant 0 If we surrender any of our rights in the French Zone we shall have to do the same in the Spanish* but not unlese.i 2o British Tradeo Our trade in the French Zone would he squeezed out almost ^entirely were it not for our special privileges^ Of these the most important are:- (a) The 12^ maximum rate of duty; (h) The provisions regarding commercial equality and adjudicationso neither of these need necessarily he surrendered if we were to abandon our extraterritorial rights ae regards jurisdiction and taxation But while these latter are not considered of great value in themselves (in practice we agree to a 11 reason able new taxation and enforce it on British subjects)* Mr,, Edmonde holda that they provide an important lever for maintain ing the ?J open door 5 ' (e 0 g a British subjects cannot be brought to hook except through the British Courts; diserimlnatory taxation can be held up by refusal to apply it to British subjects ) 9 and that whatever 'open door' assurances we might obtain their loss would .mean that our trade would eventually be ousted from Morocco ao it has been from other French Colonies* On this showing we have the choice of three courses (if and when the question becomes actual): A c to fight for the retention of our present privilegeE as they stand; Bo to surrender our extraterritorial rights proper and retain* if possible* our commercial privileges with such other safeguards for equality of treatment as we can obtain; Co to surrender the whole of our special privileges {which would be renlaced by a commercial treaty on the usual lines) in return for suitable concessions elsewhere,, From the point of view of our interests in Morocco* Mr. Edmond© favour© Ao MPo Edmonds considers would only postpone for a few year© the loss of our commercial position in Morocco. 0 . depends on whether we have any suitable counter-conces sion in mind* Mr.Edmonds thinks we could ask a hi$h price® TV WeXV. We wrote in May last to the Board of Trade and proposed that an interdepartmental meeting should be held on this subject, having in mind at that time the possibility that we might make use of the surrender of our rights in Morocco as a make-weight in some general commercial agree ment with Prance. A meeting was ultimately held on September 21st between representativee of the Foreign 1 . 0 . Office, Board of Trade,, ? Colonial Office, Dominions Office h and Department of Overseas Trade with Mr. Kdmonde also present o The Board of Trade objected strongly to the idea of bargaining with our rights in Morocco. They pointed out that, even if it were possible to obtain counter-concessione of an equivalent value in return for what we should lose by giving up our privileged position in Morocco (where they estimate our trade provisionally as worth £ 2 , 000,000 a year), they would find it impossible to defend politically the principle involved in sacrificing the interests of one group of British subjects {those trading with Morocco) in return for advantages to be granted to others. If it were a question of covenanting for concessions of a political nature in return for the surrender of the caoitulatlone in Morocco, the Board would, of course, take into oonsldera« tion the views of the Departments concerned as to the value of such concessions. For the reason stated, however* they would consider such a solution objectionable in principle* The » # a «i) . ^ —, —— —^ i) . ^ u The Board of Trade also endorsed very definitely Mr. Kdiaonds* view as to the importance of our extra territorial rights proper (Consular Courts and immunity from local taxation) in maintaining our trading position in Morocco., Both they and Mr, Bdmonds were firmly convinced that once we lost our extraterritorial rights, it would only he a matter of tine before the French Authorities found means to squeeze our trade ©ut of Morocco as effectively as has been done, for instance 9 in Syria 6 Mr„ Edmonds explained that, put crudely, the position was that the only thing which prevented the French from discriminating against our trade more than they did, and enabled us to some extent to inslet on the observance of our commercial privileges, was the knowledge that we had it in our power to make trouble by refusing to apply local legislation to British subjects. Neither the Board of Trade nor Mr. Edmonds therefore attach any material importance to the possibility that, if we were willing to bargain now for the abolition of our extraterritorial rights s we might be able to obtain on paper the reaffirmation of our present privileged position in commercial matters. The Department &amp;t‘ Oversea© Trade supported the views of the Board of Trade and Mr. Edmonds as i^egards the probable effect on our trade of the surrender of extraterritorialityo s The Board of Trade further expressed considerable doubt as to whether it would in fact be possible, if we once agreed to the revision of our treaty rights in Morocco, to insist on the retention of such exceptional commercial privileges • • 6in o e o privilege® as the 12^ maximum for Import duties.. Both ^ they and the Colonial Office are of the opinion that this latter provision f just as much as the system of extra- territorial jurisdiction, can be represented as an obsolete restriction on the autonomy of the Moroccan aduin1strat ion* They doubt if the French Authorities could be induced to reaffirm ito They suggested that similar provisions in old treaties had before now been held by legal authorities to be inapplicable* The Board of Trade therefore see no advantages in any of the three course® proposed except the first namely f to insist upon the maintenance of the st atu® quo as long aa possibleo They do not overlook the fact that 9 if we are forced later on to abandon our rights in Morocco? we sh&amp;ll probably not be able*, as we might be now? to obtain any qu i d pro quo for their surrender* Their view as regard® this possibility is that? in the first place? the respite given to British trade in Morocco would? they hope? have contributed so far to strengthening our position in the market; and secondly that? in any case? even if the loss of our trade can only be postponed for a number of years that will be so much to the good* If we are forced later on to give way to the French demand© we shal 1 not at any rate be open to the criticism £hat we should i.icur if we surrendered our privilege® voluntarily before we were obliged to? whether in return for counter-concessions or not 0 A further point mads in favour of course A was that ? if we were to give up our extraterritorial rights in Moroccohope » &gt; .&gt; o in return ior counter-concessions before the question of the capitulations in Kgypt is finally disposed of* the French Government might legitimately claim to be relieved of their obligation under Secret Article 2 of the Declaration of 1904 and 3 might later raise difficulties with regard to judicial reiorms in Kgypto Xt would therefore-, in any case* be necessary to obtain as part of any settlement regarding iioroccoa an assurance that the French would agree 9 when the time came P to the abolition of the capitulations in Kgyptc This wouldp of course $ reduce our bargaining powers in other directions^ As regards the views of the other Departments con cerned, the position of the Colonial Office is that they would raise no objection to the abolition of the capitula tions from the point of view of the British subjects of colonial origin who form the majority of the British community in Morocco, In principle p they would be glad to see the provisions of the Moroccan treaties modified. They made the point with regard to the 12'f; tariff that we v^ere being much embarrassed ourselves by the terms of the AngXo- Butch Treaty of 1824 regarding the duties to be levied on Butch shipping in the Fast Indies a and they would like ta see His Majesty’s Government adopt the attitude that the provisions of such old treaties were inapplicable at the present date. If the treaty position in Morocco were to be brought up to date 3 they would look for the torminat-iQEi of certain old treaties affecting Muscat and 2anzibar 9 (they do not attach much importance to this as the treaties are to some extent a dead letter but they thought it desirable that the position should be ^egulsrised)«, They would alsohope that it might be possible to obtain most-favoured- nation treatment in France for our colonial produce. The India Office have put forward suggestion* in the past that territorial adjustment© in India should be sought as the price of our surrender of the capitulation© in Morocco* They did not? however* press these suggestion© at the meeting in view of the general opinion against surrendering our rights at the present time, but merely stated that they wuld like them to be considered if there should be any Question of obtaining counter-con cessions from the French later on. As a result of the decided view© expressed by the Board of Trade and Mr. Kdmonde the conclusion was generally accepted that we should confine ourselves for the time being to course A and that there was therefore no use in considering further the possibilities of counter- concessions. In the circumstance©, there is nothing further to be done at present with regard to this question but to await the next move from the French Government. If and when they reopen the question* we must presumably ignore* ae far as possibles any arguments based on the reasonable claims of the French administration in Morocco to be freed of obsolete servitude© and stand uncompromisingly on our Treaty rights. Our position in this respect is fairly strong, in that our rights are cleanly laid down in the Treaties* and there is* as far as we know* nothing which definitely « w •definitely commits us to giving them up at any specific date prior to the abolition of the capitulations in Egypto This attitude may be hard to reconcile with the liberal policy which we have adopted elsewhere?, but the French are scarcely entitled to press very far an appeal to liberal principle©; and it may be hoped that they will continue to obscure the real strength of their moral ease? as they have done higherto? by hair-splitting arguments on the interpretation of the treaties,. It is, of course 3 possible that the French may return to their suggestion of arbitra~ tion. If they do ? our Legal Advisers see no reason why we should not accept the challenge. If for any reason^ the position in thie respect should change and it should be considered that our case wae not strong enough to risk an arbitration 0 the whole situation would be altered* for the political objection to bargaining for the surrender of our privileges on which the Board of Trade principally insist P would decrease if not disappear? and the whole question would have to be re-considered? Nevertheless 3 it must be recognised that our position is morally weak and will weaken progressively aa conditions of civilization in Morocco improve? and it seeias inherent in the nature of the care that we shall sooner or later find a non possumu© attitude untenableo It is therefore perhaps desirable that we should not lose sight entirely of the alternative courses B and GoAs regards B p we must accept as desisive p as far ae anything can be decisive, the considered views of the rsuana of Trade„ and our Consular Authorities, that any modification of our present privileges would Involve inevitably the loss of our trading position in Morocco and that little importance would attach to any written safeguards we might be able to obtain for our commercial privileges if once the extraterritorial position ie modifledn Ab regarde C ?

Representatives of the Board of Trade and of the department of Overseas Trade maintained that it was most undesirable to give up any capitulatory rights which British subjects at present enjoy in Morocco on the ground that ; whatever might be the paper safeguards which could be obtained in exchange for such surrender, the effect would necessarily be the giving up of British trade with Morocco to the value of some £2,000,000 a year. They accordingly would strongly oppose any suggestion that a voluntary surrender should be made*and would return an uncompromising negative to any French approach in the direction of negotiating a surrender of such rights in return for concessions elsewhere. The/ihe Oolonial Office said that they attaehzoC little importance to the protection of British subjects resident in Morocco from Gribralt4r, Malta, or Mediterranean Colonies, but that their experience was that where a limit was imposed by treaty on the import tariff of a Protectorate it was usually possible to secure its revision on the ground that such limitations were obsolete in modern economic conditions. They had suggestions to make in regard to possible concessions elsewhere^should it be decided to surrender British rights in Morocco by negotiation but, in view of the attitude of the Board of Trade, these were not discussed in detail. I explained briefly the desiderata of the Government of India especially in regard to Chander Pagore which might be put forward as a quid pro quo in return for the abandonment of rights in Morocco, but stated that I did not think that the India Office attached so much importance to them as to outweigh the considerations (advanced by the Board of Trade)regarding the political disadvantages of surrendering British trading interests with the Protectorate,€*4 which seemed to demand thatn at any rate in the first instance a negative reply should be returned to any French demand for a surrender of existing British privileges in Morocco.

Memoranda on this subject are included (folios 289-303 and 305-312).The majority of the file deals with the drafting of a convention between the two powers to cover all related matters. Further correspondence with the Governments of the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State, and Canada, as well as the British Merchants' Morocco Association, is included as part of this process. A copy of the convention, signed in July 1937, is contained in the file (folios 76-93), along with a number of drafts.The need for and drafting of a new Order in Council is also a matter covered by the papers. A copy of The Morocco (French Zone) Order in Council, 1937 is found on folios 7-8.Correspondence with the Postal Services Department of the General Post Office and the British Consulate General in Rabat regarding the closure of British Postal Agencies in Fez and Rabat is also included.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Board of Trade</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Dominions Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Department of Overseas Trade</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000371#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
