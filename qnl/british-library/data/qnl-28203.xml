Dated the 17th November, 1945. Gun Salutes and ceremonials in the Persian Gulf. Reference India Office Express Letter No. P.Z.677/37 Gated the 25th March 1937, and connected correspondence• 2. Some doubt has arisen in regard to the correct procedure to be adopted in regard to the exchange of ceremonial calls at Muscat between the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, and the official deputyof H.H. the Sultan of Muscat, in the latter*s absence. When the Council of Ministers was in exist ence the Council as a whole was accorded a salute of 17 guns, and the Political Resident, whose salute is 13 guns, apparently paid the first call on the Council. The Council of Ministers was disolved by the present Sultan in 1932, and in 1937 the Table of Salutes was amended to provide for a salute of 13 guns for the Sultan*s official deputy if a member of the ruling family, and 9 guns if not a member of the ruling family. 3. In recent years only three visits by Political Residents have been made to Muscat in the Sultan*s absence, the first in 1938 by Sir Trenchard Fowle, the second in 1941 by Lt.Col. Hay, and the third in this year by myself. On all th£se occasions the Political Resident paid the first call on the Sultan*s official deputy, Saiyid Shahab, a member of the ruling family. I am doubtful, however, whether the procedure that has been followed in these instances is correct. There is an obvious difference in status between the Council of Ministers as a whole and a single individual, and I am of opinion that as the salute accorded to the latter is not higher than that of the Political Resident, the first call should be paid by the Sultan*s deputy. I should be glad of a /decision.... \- 2 - 3V h ** decision by Government on this point. 4. The Sultan has recently dismissed Saiyid Shahab and proposes to appoint an Adviser and Foreign Minister. Should he appoint this official, and not a member of the ruling family, to be his deputy in his absence, there is no question but that the deputy should pay the first call on the Political Resident.

C. SALUTES. At present the Politioal Resident enjoys a salute of thirteen gins and the Politioal Agents of 11 guns* If the proposals about the ranking of officers are accepted, the Politioal Resident would appear to become entitled to a salute of seventeen or fifteen guns according to whether he is regarded as a Minister Plenipotentiary or a Minister Resident and the Politioal Agents to salutes of 7 guns* It does not much matter whether the Political Resident's salute is increa£. ed or not but I am opposed to the reduction in the salutes of the Politioal Agents which cannot fail to lower their status in the eyes of the local Shaikhs especially as the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait enjoy salutes of 11 guns* D FLAGSD.

My dear Baxter, The Political Resident has sent heme lor consider ation a note on various ceremonial matters ishich require to be settled as a result of the transfer of the control of the administration from the Grovommont of India to K.h. G. Kxcept for the question of the flags to be flowi no immediate decision seems to be required and you may f©el that things can remain as they are until the Poreign Office take over from the India Office in April of next year. You may, however, like to have our views on the points raised in Hay’s note and I set them do*n for convenience in this letter. ( A ) Designation of Officers We'agree with the Political Resident that there is no necessity to change the designation of any of the officers which have been in use for a long time and are well understood in the area. The Political Agent at Muscat is already H.M. Consul as well but we see no necessity for a change in the description of the Political Agents at Bahrain and Kuwait. ( 0 ) ?. edonoe • it seems only necessary to regulate the comparative precedence between the Political Officers and Officers in His Majesty's fighting services. Ac the Political Resident at present ranks senior to all Plag, General and Air Officers, it seems appropriate that, within his charge, he should continue to enjoy this precedence and that the Political Agents should rank with, but after. Captains, R.H., Colonels and Group Cap tains in the R.A.P. and that the Junior officers should rank with, but after, Lieutenant-Ccmrranders, Majors and Squadron- Leaders « (C) Salutes I am inclined to think that the best solttion is to leave the ntanber of guns as they are at present, and in any case not to reduce the Salutes accorded to the Political Agents below the 11 guns which they new enjoy. (L) Plage It seems clearly desirable that the Political Resident should no longer f ly the 'Union Viceroy*' (which is, I believe, a Union flag with the Star of India in the centre) but should in future fly the Union flag with the Royal Arms in the centre and the Political Agents the Union flag with the Tudor Crown. (E) The Political Resident’s title of 'Hon’blc 1 * I expect you will feel that the time has now come to drop this and we should not object if you so decide, but the point about the use of the honorific in Arabic correspondence should be brone in mind; this could perhaps be treated as a local usage and left undisturbed. (P) Uniform The Political Resident’s suggestions seem to be sensible, and we think that, at any rate until new incumbents are appointed the Political Officers should continue to wear the uniform they already possess. 3.W.Baxter Esq.,CMG, UC, Yours sincerely, 3d* S.P.D0MALD30N.u \v Reference the ceremonial in connection with the Political Resident’s Official visit to Muscat• 2. On receipt of information that your visit was to be official I discussed the ceremonial procedure with fir* Jamali the Sultan’s Secretary and we agreed verbally on the programme to be followed. Later I sent him a v/ritten copy of the suggested programme asking him to confirm that orders would be issued for a salute to be fired from Mirani Fort and for the usual guard to be provided in the Consulate premises, ^fter some delay I received a letter confirnung the salute and saying the guard would be provided at Bait al Barza. I at first thought this t^Be merely a slip and asked the Treasury Officer to call on the Secretary and clear up the discrepancy. It then turned out that under instructions from Saiyid Shihab, he had deliberately notified me that the guard would be at Bait al Barza and not the Consulate since Saiyid Shihab maintained that this was where the guard was customarily provided. I referred the matter back but got no satisfaction. Finally I called on Saiyid Shihab and managed to convince him that for the last three years anyway, the guard had been provided in the Consulate. I maintained that this was in accordance with the agreement drawn up by Major Hickinbotham in consultation with the Sultan and approved by the Sultan. Saiyid Shihab ii i eventually agreed that the guard should be provided in the Consulate compound this year; maintained that the procedure drawn up by Major hickinbotham and the Sultan must have been altered since from his own ) personal knowledge he recalled that when you paid your first official call in Muscat in 1941 when he was representing the Sultan, the guard.was drawn up at Bait al Parza. He therefore would provide the guard without prejuidice to his objection which he would reserve the right of raising on the Sultan’s return. After my meeting with Saiyid Shihab I consulted rqy records for the year 1941 and find that Saiyid Shihab T s contention that the guard on that occasion was provided at Bait al Parza and not at the Consulate is correct. I do not know the reason for this change in the accepted procedure. SIAN C DAi / CON t3. I think in raising this question it is not Saiyid Shihab f s intention to get a dig at us so much as at the Sultan. I think he genuinely believes the procedure of providing the guard at the Consulate to be incorrect and is taking this means of pointing out to the Sultan who is rather keen on ceremonial that he has approved an incorrect procedure. The question in any case will have to be gone into after the Sultan’s return and I should be glad for guidance as to the attitude I should follow. It is my own view that much of our ceremonial procedure here is out of date and we should be prepared to make concessions in keeping with modern times before the suggestions of these concessions come from the other side. I cannot but help feeling that it is not in keeping with modern ceremonial for the guard of honour to be supplied at the landing stage except perhaps, o^ the occasion of the very first call after a new Political Resident has been appointed. If this^coneeded I think we, in our turn might be satisfied if the guard of honour on subsequent visits were provided at Fait al Barza. L. h U ^ P.(\. 1 ^ C-cWow U/ow_ K P.ft. 1 ^CON*' UkJTTlAL.

X am commanded by My Lords Con&amp;ndLssionors of the Admiralty to acquaint you that a list of Saluting Stations in ports throughout the world has been promulgated recently as an Admiralty l 1 leet Order. The list, however, is not complete and the only information available in certain cases is that for July 1939 when the previous iosue of an Admiralty Fleet Order on this subject was -ade, 2. It was known at that time that in MUSCAT and OMAN a saluting battery existed in luscat and I am to request that you obtain an up to date list of Saluting Stations in Muscat and Oman and the position of the batteries which will return salutes in order that this information can be promulgated as an amendment to the latest Admiralty Fleet Order.

The Sultan confirms that the only batteries capable of returning salutes in his territories were the Mirahi batteries in Muscat. ASHft I told the Sultan today that I thought that India eventually might want to appoint a Consul or Vice Consul in Muscat hut I did not think that Pakistan would wish to be represented for the present. The Sultan made no particular oomment except that if a Consul of another natioh were appointed to Muscat it would be necessary to raise the question of the Political Agents salute. At present the Political Agent is given a salute of 11 guns but as Consul he ma only entitled to 7. If the Consul of another nation were appointed and he was only given the 7 guns to whioh he was entitled he would object to the Political Agent's 11 gun salute under the most favoured nation treatment. I said that I thought India would probably be represented by a Vice Consul and not a Consul and asked the Sultan to let the matter rest until the difficulty actually arose. Copy to PJl.

The Sultan has agreed to call officially on His Majesty’s Consul on New Year’s Day. He will not expect the call to be returned. I explained to him that although New Year’s Day is no longer Proclamation Day it is the occasion on which in the Gulf we officially celebrate the festival of Christmas, and I suggested that it would be proper for him to call on the Consul as a counterpart to the 'Id calls which the Consul pays. The position therefore will in future be that the Consul calls officially on the Sultan on the two 'Ids and the Sultan calls on the Consul on His Majesty's birthday, and , New Year’s Day. I understand that the Consul is received with a guard of honour when he pays his 'Id calls and I presume that similar guard will be arranged for the Sultan when he calls officially on His Majesty's Consul.
