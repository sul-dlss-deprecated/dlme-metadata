Mr Memorandum Ref. your 889 of E2nd Deer, 1928. I do not agree with the cbpinion of the Insurance company that the duty on the car in question has been .wrongly levied. 3very import is liable to dj^ty and the Customs are not con cerned with the fate of an import after it has been cleared. If the import suffered damage between ship and shore it Bhould surely be a question between the Landing Company and the firm concerned. I see no reason why the State should suffer for the benefit of an Insurance Company's claims expenditure account. I suggest that it is creating a dangerous precedent to grant a refund of duty, properly collected, to please a party who may feel aggrieved at having to pay it.

Memorandum. Rewards. In the case of an offence against the Customs Regulations which is punished by a fine, the persons detecting same are enti tled to one-half of the fine as a reward for their diligence. These rewards have proved to be wholesome incentive towards detection of offences. Inhave recently brought a prosecution under the Passport Regula tions and the one half of the fine awarded has not been granted, on the ground that the offence in question was not against the Customs' Regulations. In view of the fact that the passport regulations work forms part of the duties of the Customs 1 Officials, and a good deal of the success in operating the regulations depends upon the dili gence of these officials, might I with deference venture to suggest that such a reward as is granted for a Customs Offence mi^ht very reasonalhly be granted for an offence against the Pass port Regulations; and if this view is acceptable, might I ask that a rule to that effect might issue, please.

M ADVISER TO THE BAHRAIN GOVERNMENT, BAHRAIN.government of bahrain. No. //*#-/-3 pf 1352 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Dated, Dil Qaad 19, 1352 ('V March 5, 1934. p£ R | From 7 The Adviser to the Govermaent of Bahrain, Bahrain# To His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain, Sir, I have the honour to inform you that a matter has recently come to my notice which raises some douht in my mind as to whether the Customs department is at present receiv ing the correct duty on petrol and kerosene imported from Abadan by the Agents of the Anglo Persian Oil Company, Limited. Palm Tree kerosene is invoiced by the Anglo Persian Oil Company, C.I.F at m /6 per tin. The prime cost in Bahrain would be:- One tin of 4 gallons Rs 1. 6. 0. Customs duty (say) 1. 0 Import Yard Charges (say) 1. 3. Landing and coolie charges 0. 9. Total Rs 1. 9. 0. The bazaar sale prices (retail) of a tin of Kerosene —Kerosene Oil are for a quantity of one thousand tins^about Bs 2/2 per tin, and by the single tin at about fis 2/9., this price varying with the supply and demand, and is sometimes higher. Thus the value of a tin of Kerosene Oil in Bahrain is considerably more than the invoiced price. 3. Aviation Spirit is invoiced at Rs 3/3 per tin and the prime cost in Bahrain would be very nearly One tin of 4 gallons Bs 3. 3. 0. Customs duty (say) 2. 6 Import Yard charges (Say) 1. 3. Landing &amp; Cooly charges 0. 9. Total Rs 3. 7. 6. The local sale price is fis 9/8, but customs duty is paid ad valorem on the invoice value of Is 3/3 per tin, which I think is too low, having regard to the Bahrain value (not the Abadan value) of a tin of Aviation Spirit. 4. There may possibly^some explanation for the very large difference between the invoice value and the value in Bahrain, but unless this can be satisfactorily explained, I think it would be justifiable when charg ing customs duty to take into consideration the price at which it is sold locally and to disregard the invoice price. I should be obliged if you would let me have your opinion on the matter. I have the honour to be. Sir. Your obedient servant. Adviser to the Government.NOTES Serial No. ; ill i; Subject.

Apparently His Excellency Shaikh Hamad had suggested that the exemption should now be extended to Shaikh Salman as he was the eldest son of the Ruler^ and in communicating this order to the Director of Customs,Mr.Belgrave had put in that certain people had to be exempted including so and so and so and so^ and the Political Agent. The Director of Customs had interpreted this as meaning that the exemption was only to cover the Political Agent in person. Mr.Belgrave said that^ had he thought about it at all^he would have written w Agency tt instead of ^Agent'. 3. The whole matter is a mistake.

Dear Sirs, I thank you for your letter of this date, enquiring to Provisional Duty; and would inform you that the question of the clearance of cargo 'being permitted under payment of Provisional Duty arises when an Importer is unahle to submit satisfactory evidence of the value of the import, for Customs purposes, often 'because the relative pucca invoices have not yet come to hand. In such a case the value of the goods may 'be assessed 'by the Customs on the local market rate; or, if the Director permits^! a Provisional Duty may 'be levied, on the hasis of the local value, plus a percentage. Wh en Provisional Duty is sanctioned, the importe is ahle to obtain a refund of the difference 'between the amount paid and the amount payable on production of satisfactory evidence of the value of the import, provided that such claim is made within three months from the date of payment of the Provisional Duty.
