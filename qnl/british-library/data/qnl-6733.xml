Finally, I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to reconcile the navigational and constructional requirements. In some cases alternative proposals to those recommended by the Committee are put forward, as the result of further personal investigation since I left the Persian Gulf, or are suggested by the probable expenditure after the preparation of the estimates. In regard to the scheme generally as prepared and advocated by the , Committee of Enquiry, I would draw attention to the abstract statement of lights proposed by the British India officers at the beginning of the Report, and would state that, since the Committee dispersed, I have had numerous opportunities of confidentially discussing the lighting of the Persian Gulf with masters of vessels engaged in navigating these waters, including some of those whose opinions had previously been submitted to us, and discovered, without divulging the recommendations of the Committee, that the scheme proposed would meet with, practically, universal favour. In submitting estimates for each of the proposed lighthouses, it has been assumed that all materials which require to be imported into the Gulf will be carried by regular trading steamers to the nearest port, and be taken thence, landed, and delivered on the site by the proposed lighthouse tender and her crew, as the services of an attendant steamship are considered essential in the interests of works on sites of such isolation and inaccessi bility. No allowance has, therefore, been made in the estimates for freight on material after it leaves the trading steamer, except the hire of native craft for barge work where necessary. Where portions of any works demand fresh water for building construction or other purposes, it has been assumed that such water will be delivered on the site by the steamer if it cannot be procured locally. Nor has allowance been made for the purchase of land for lighthouses or other works. In Paper ^o. ISGj dated 5th November 1908, embodying the official correspondence in regard to the construction of a lighthouse at Ras al Arz, s. 11.—2. -2 it is recommended (page 11) that the work be executed by experienced lighthouse constructors from England. I have, therefore, assumed that all lighthouses, &amp;c., in the Persian Gulf will be erected by a Superintendent of Works of the Constructive Staff of Trinity House, and by lighthouse mechanics where necessary, all skilled labour being procured from India, and unskilled labour from the locality in which the work is being executed, and that none of the lighthouses will be erected by contract. Lighthouse Tender. The necessity for the provision of a steamship to serve exclusively in the capacity of lighthouse tender has been pointed out by the Committee of Enquiry. The cost of construction and maintenance of this steamer would form very considerable items in any scheme for establishing lights in the Persian Gulf. Possibly, however, the Royal India Marine have at their disposal an existing vessel which, if possible to release from other duties, could at comparatively small cost be fitted and adapted for use as a lighthouse tender for the district. She should have a good hold and good deck accommodation for the conveyance of stores and buoys, be fitted with storage gas receivers and compressor for charging buoys or light vessels, and have a powerful winch and derrick for dealing easily with weights up to 8 tons at sea. Her capacity for water storage or distilling, as recommended by the Committee of Enquiry, should not be overlooked. Should a suitable vessel of the Royal India Marine not be available, and it becomes necessary to build a new ship, with proper appliances and permanent living accommodation for officers and crew, she would in all probability require a displacement of approximately 800 tons. I estimate her cost, delivered in the Persian Gulf after construction in England, at 30,000Z. The Indian Government, from their own experience, will be able to estimate what her annual maintenance would be in the East, but it would probably amount to about 5,000L per annum, inclusive of wages, repairs, coal, stores, and all charges. The Committee of Enquiry recommend that one of the officers of the ship should be a qualified surveyor, and I would farther suggest that her Com mander hold the appointment of Superintendent of Lighthouses, and be responsible for the proper maintenance of all lighthouses, light vessels, and buoys. The engineer of the ship should be fully trained to overhaul and adjust all working parts of all lights, including clocks, rollers, buoy flashers, &amp;c., and be thoroughly grounded in the management and adjustment of modern lighthouse burners. Lighthouses. As already stated, the order of navigational importance as tabulated in the report of the Committee of Enquiry should, for constructional expediency, be departed from to a slight degree. In the opinion of .the Committee of Enquiry, the first lighthouse in the Gulf should be established at Little Quoin, Musandam. The establishment of a lighthouse on Little Quoin, however, would be dependent on the attendance of the lighthouse stedmer ; and, if it is the intention of the Government of India to proceed forthwith with a lighting scheme, I would point out that, as the services of the steam tender are not required for the construction and maintenance of the proposed works at Muscat, Linga, and Debai, the establishment of these lights could be undertaken during the period in which the proposed lighthouse tender is under construction or adaptation. Then, on the arrival of the steam tender in the Gulf, the construction of the Little Quoin lighthouse could be proceeded with ; and considerable economy would be effected if Little Quoin and Tanb Island lighthouses were built simultaneously, as they are close together, and could both be attended to easily and conveniently by the ship, while allowing her ample time to attend periodically to the requirements of any floating or other lights that may meantime have been established in the Gulf.3 0 The construction of lighthouses at Shaikh Shuaib, Bushire, Kubbar, Ras al Arz, and Kishm, from the different nature of the structures, could be undertaken separately and in any required sequence, as in these cases continual attention by the ship would not be so essential. In all cases [ would recommend that the illummant adopted for light houses in the Persian Gulf be ordinary lighthouse paraffin. As incandescent oil burners of the ' Chance ' type are already installed on the coast of India, I would suggest that the same system be adopted for the lights now under discussion, as the lighthouse officials appointed to the Gulf will in all probability have had some experience of these burners in Burma, Madras, and other portions of the Indian coast. In regard to machinery and the working parts of each lighthouse, only mechanism of the simplest nature is recommended, in view of its maintenance by local keepers. DfiroT. • While the earliest works are in progress in the Gulf, the establishment of the gasworks should be completed. The site for the depot and gasworks which appeared to me to offer the greatest advantages in the Persian Gulf was the shore of the Sweikh Channel at Koweit, when it transpired that a portion of the adjoining land had already been secured by the British Government. I subsequently inferred, and have assumed, that the con struction of a pier or jetty at this point is in contemplation, and that part of this British land will be placed at the disposal of the lighthouse authorities for the establishment of a buoy yard, gas works, &amp;c., and that the pier or jetty will be available for the use of the lighthouse service. The cost of establishing gasworks, erecting a small workshop, oil storage tanks, store houses, offices, forming buoy yard, and boundary walls, would probably entail an expenditure of about 22,000L, complete with spare light vessel, gas buoys, unlit buoys, moorings, and general equipment, but nothing has been allowed in this estimate for the purchase of land, or any proportion of the cost of the proposed pier. On the assumption that the work already contemplated by the Govern ment at Koweit will be commenced immediately, matters would be considerably simplified if the establishment of the lighthouse depot formed a part of the Admiralty scheme, and if the work could be carried out by their constructive staff. It is assumed that Koweit will shortly be placed in telegraphic communication with Bushire. The cost of maintaining the depot is covered by the corresponding amounts given for each of the proposed lights. Light Vessels. Simultaneously with the building or adaptation of the steam tender the construction of one or more light vessels could be undertaken. They should be modelled, both as regards hull and lighting apparatus, on the most recent Trinity House practice; and I would suggest that they be copper-sheathed composite ships, about 85 feet in length. Each ship should be fitted with storage gas holders for the maintenance of a dioptric light, similar to those on this principle established successfully in France and England. The dioptric apparatus should consist of large fourth order panels of 375 m/m. focal distance, and each ship should be arranged to show a single flashing white light, so that she could be removed from, or placed on, any station without alteration. This can be done without any possible confusion of lights. They should be fitted with 2-wick capillary stand-by lamps. In England the crew of such a vessel consists of six men, i .e., four on board and two on relief; but in the Persian Gulf I would suggest that the crew consist of six men on board and two on relief. I estimate the cost of such a vessel, complete, with moorings on her station in the Gulf, at approximately 9,500L, and the maintenance at about 650L per annum, inclusive of wages, stores, periodical overhaul, and all sums chargeable against the ship for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit.I am of opinion that the construction of these ships should not be undertaken in India. A dioptric ship is of special form, and should be trimmed for proper riding, have her lenses balanced, the swing of the vessel determined, and the period of the pendulum finally adjusted to it under the supervision of experts at home. The first ship completed might be towed to the Gulf by the new light house tender, and the others could be sailed to Port Said, and towed from there to the Gulf by the tender sent round specially for that purpose. All proposals as to lightships and lighted buoys are put forward provisionally, as the illumination of all descriptions of floating lights is on the eve of very important, and, I confidentally anticipate, successful development. The estimates of first cost and maintenance may, however, be accepted as covering figures in any case. Muscat {see Appendix L). The summit of lias Muscat is at present practically inaccessible, and a zig-zag path with occasional steps would require to be made to the top. The flat reef below the headland, and on which a landing can easily be effected, requires making up with concrete, and considerable excavation would be necessary on the summit of the headland to form a shelf or plateau on which the necessary buildings could be erected. The tower and dwellings should be constructed of masonry, the former being only about 12 feet b inches high, floor to floor. This would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 250 feet above high water, or sufficient for a geographical range of about 22 miles. The necessary living and storage accommodation should consist of living room, sleeping- room, oil store, fuel store, general store-room, and water storage tanks. The provision of a low retaining wall around the plateau might be found necessary, as the surface rock on the summit is very loose. The light should, I consider, be of the Third Order, and show one flash of about '34 second duration every 5 seconds. The intensity would be about 100,000 candles with an incandescent oil burner having a mantle of 55 m/m in the focus of the lens. I estimate approximately, from the information at my disposal, that the cost of establishing such a lighthouse, complete with lantern, lighting- apparatus, dwelling and stores, and inclusive of forming a landing place, approaches to the summit, temporary stores, and living quarters for superin tendents and workmen, would be about 8,000Z., and the annual maintenance, inclusive of oil, stores, wages and repairs, at about 350L, an amount that would cover the sum annually chargeable against Muscat for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. I consider that the establishment necessary for maintaining this light should consist of six men (natives of Muscat), who should be chosen by the Superintendent of Works and the erecting mechanic, in consultation with the British Political Resident at Muscat, from amongst the labourers employed on the works, and who will have been under observation for a considerable time by these officers. It would then be the duty of the erecting mechanic to instruct them in the management of the burners and everything in their charge. It would be necessary for Muscat lighthouse to be maintained as a u rock station,' i.e., the men only residing at the lighthouse and their families in the town. Four men would, therefore, always be on duty at the lighthouse, with two on relief. Little Quoin {see Appendices 11. and III.). On the completion of Muscat lighthouse, the workmen's living quarters, cement store and plant should be conveyed to the Little Quoin by the lighthouse tender, and the construction of the lighthouse on the island begun. The most conveuient landing place is at the north-west point; but to face up the rock so as to render the landing of men and stores easy, and execute the necessary protective work to the cliff over the landing place.would, though presenting little constructional difficulty, entail considerable expenditure. The edge of the cliff at the south end is 154 feet high, and the proposed site 134 feet above high water. The tower should be of masonry, 30 feet high from base to gallery, which would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 175 feet above high water, or sufficient for a geographical range of 20 miles. This light—one of the most important in the Gulf—should, I consider, be of the Second Order, and show two flashes in quick succession every 10 seconds as follows :— Flash - - - - - '23 second. Eclipse - - - - 1' 54 „ • Flash - - - - '23 ,, Eclipse - - - - 8'00 seconds. Total period - - 10'00 The intensity, with an incandescent oil burner having a mantle of 55 m/m- in the focus of the lens, would be about 200,000 candles. I estimate the cost of establishing the light, inclusive of landing place, cliff protective work ; tower, dwellings, stores, lantern and lighting apparatus complete at 12,500^., and the annual maintenance at 400Z., inclusive of all stores, wages, structural repairs, and charges against the Little Quoin lighthouse for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. The lighthouse should be maintained as a rock station, the keepers only living on the island. The establishment should consist of six men, four on duty and two on relief. Probably a very frequent relief of the Little Quoin lighthouse would be necessary in the summer months, as it is characterised climatically as the worst place in the Gulf, Bunder Abbas {see Appendix IV.). Alternative proposals for lighting the approaches to Bunder Abbas are suggested by the Committee of Enquiry, viz. :— 1. A lighthouse near Kishm Town, in conjunction with a lighted buoy at the seaward extreme of the shoals off Kishm Point, or— 2. A small light vessel or gas boat alone in the latter position. A site for a lighthouse was selected near a small gully just beyond the extreme water tank to the southward of Kishm Town, the site being about 100 yards from the sea. Good building materials, except for concrete work, are not available locally, and 1 would suggest that the tower be a braced cast-iron structure about 65 feet high from ground to gallery. This would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 86 feet above high water, or sufficient for a geographical range of 15 miles as recommended by the Admiralty and the Committee of Enquiry. The light should, I consider, be Third Order occulting, and show red between the bearings of about S. 14° E. and S. 66° E. over Larak Island. Its character should be one occultation every 20 seconds. With an incan descent oil burner, having a mantle of 55 m/m diameter in the focus of the lens, the intensity would be about 9,000 candles. 1 estimate the cost of establishing the lighthouse, inclusive of tower, lantern, lighting apparatus, stores, dwellings, &amp;c., complete at 7,500L, and its annual maintenance, inclusive of wages, stores, repairs, and painting, at 400?., which sum would cover all amounts chargeable against Kishm for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. Kishm lighthouse would rank as a shore station, the establishment con sisting of four men, who should live with their families in dwellings erected near the tower. With regard to the proposed lighted buoy off Kishm Point, I estimate its cost, with lantern and moorings complete on its station, at 6002., and its annual maintenance at 40/., inclusive of gas, cleaning, periodical overhaul, and depot charges. s. 11— 2. bG 1 In regard to the alternative proposal to establish a small type of light vessel off Kishm point, I estimate the cost of placing an unattended gas boat, with an occulting light of about 500 candle power, at 6,000Z. complete on her station, with moorings, &amp;c. The maintenance of such a vessel would probably amount to about 250Z. per annum, inclusive of gas, stores, periodical overhaul, and all sums chargeable against her by the depot at Koweit, and periodical and frequent attention by a local man. Either of these schemes for lighting the approaches to Bunder Abbas involves considerable expense both in first cost and annual maintenance, to obviate which a third and possible alternative suggests itself, viz., to establish a small outer light on the east end of Larak Island, and a lighted buoy at the Euphrates Patch west of Hormuz. As already stated, the first cost and annual maintenance of the buoy would be 600L and 40L respectively, inclusive of all depot charges. A navigator could ascertain his position in approaching the port from any direction by the Little Quoin light, and all that would be necessary to guide him safely past Larak is a small light of short range to mark the end of the island. If this were a standard semi-watched port light, it could be attended to by a native of the adjoining village. No provision would be necessary for living quarters, as would probably be the case if the light were established on the west end of the island. A light of only 5 miles range on the east end of Larak would, it appears to me, be as efficient as a 15-mile light on Kishm Point, If the lighting of the approaches to Bunder Ahbas he restricted to one channel only. In addition to the cost of the proposed buoy at the Euphrates Patch, the establishment of a port light on Larak Island would involve an expenditure of 450Z., inclusive of a small corrugated iron oil store, &amp;c., and would, I consider, be maintained at an annual cost of about 351., inclusive of all depot charges. The estimate of first cost of this port light provides for an erecting mechanic being already employed in the Gulf, as no provision has been made for sending a man specially from India or England to erect the light. Jezirat Taxb (see Appendix V.). The best sight for a lighthouse on Tanb is the summit of the island, a flat tableland near the N.W. side. Good building stone is available, and I would suggest that the premises be constructed of masonry. The site is about 1G5 feet above high water; but, as there are several points on the island nearly as high as the proposed site, I would suggest that, in order to reduce the shadows cast seaward by them, the tower be 30 feet high. This would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 200 feet above high water, or sufficient for a geographical range of 20 miles. The light should, I consider, be of the Third Order, and show one flash of ' 34 second duration every 5 seconds, the intensity being about 100,000 candles. I estimate the cost of establishing this light complete with tower, dwellings, stores, lantern and lighting apparatus, at about 7,500L, and its maintenance at 350L per annum, which would cover all sums chargeable against the station for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. Tanb lighthouse should rank as a shore station, the establishment con sisting of four keepers, who should live with their families in dwellings erected beside the tower. These men should, if possible, be natives of the island. Debai. The site selected for the proposed light at Debai is on the sea front. The structure should be a column 20 feet high, and the light (fixed red, as recom mended by the Committee of Enquiry) should be shown from a Fourth Order port light. It would be of about 200 candle power, which would probably give an effective range of 5 miles, and often more in very clear weather.I The light could, I estimate, be maintained for about 35Z. per annum, and # I estimate the first cost, inclusive of column, lantern, stores, and corrugated iron oil store at approximately 450£. if carried out a time when other work was in hand in the locality and an expert erector was available. L ingah. The site selected for a light at Lingah is the centre of the courtyard of the new offices of the British India Company, in which position I would suggest that a high column with four stays be erected. The light, fixed red, as recommended by the Committee of Enquiry, should be so arranged that the lantern is hoisted nightly on the mast or column. It should be a Fourth Order port light, the establishment of which would not, I estimate, exceed 6()0Z. if carried out at a time when other work was in hand in the locality. Such a light would probably be maintained at an annual cost of 35Z. inclusive of all depot charges. Its maintenance would only require the partial time of one man for extinguishing and cleaning purposes in the morning and for lighting up and hoisting into position at night. Shaikh Shcaib (see iVppendix VI.). The best position for a lighthouse is, as indicated by the Committee of Enquiry, near the SAV. point of the island. The tower should, I consider, be a braced cast-iron structure about 85 feet in height from base to gallery, which would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 120 feet above high water. The resultant geographical range would be about 17 miles, or rather more than is recom mended by the Committee; but the slight additional height allowed for in the tower is to obtain a satisfactory bearing of the light over the higher land to the eastward. From this elevation the light would, in all probability, show from N. through W. and S. to E. The light should, I consider, be of the Third Order, and show two flashes in quick succession every 10 seconds as follows :— Hash - - - - - *34 second. Eclipse - - - - 1*5 „ Flash - - - - - '34 „ Eclipse - - - - 7'82 seconds. Total period - - 10 '00 „ The intensity would be about 100,000 candles. I estimate the cost of establishing such a light, inclusive of tower, lantern, lighting apparatus, dwellings, stores, &amp;c., complete at 8,000L, and its maintenance at 400^. per annum, inclusive of all sums chargeable against the station for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. The four keepers should, I consider, be natives of the island, and reside with their families in quarters erected near the tower. Shaikh Shuaib would, therefore, be a shore station, and require no regular relief. Ras al Mutaf. The tyj^e of floating light proposed for establishment at Ras al Mutaf is described provisionally under light vessels, where it is also estimated that her first cost would be about 9,500L and her annual maintenance about 650L The light should show one flash every 10 seconds, and the intensity would be approximately 40,000 candles. Bushire. As suggested by the Committee of Enquiry, the most efficient means of lighting the approach to Bushire is by means of a light vessel placed near the outer anchorage. The cost of establishing a suitable ship would be8 about 9 5001., and her annual maintenance approximately 650Z., as already stated for Ras al Mutaf. The light could be single flashing every 10 seconds, with an intensity of about 40,000 candles. i i The alternative scheme, as indicated by the ('ommittee, is a lighthouse on shore. The first cost and maintenance of a light vessel as compared with a light house would be, of course, considerably greater, though the difference would probably not be so marked in this instance as in England; still, the establishment and maintenance of a large floating light would be heavy items of expenditure for a port like Rushire. 1 o obviate tins, J would suggest yet another scheme, which is, in effect, a simple combination of the recommendations of the Admiralty and the Committee of Enquiry, viz., a lighthouse on Has as Shaghab, and a gas buoy with a large lantern and a high and conspicuous topmark, outside the 5-fathom line, so that in hazy weather, even in daytime, a vessel would not overrun the anchorage. A lighthouse on Ras as Shaghab shonld be a braced cast-iron structure as recommended for Shaikh Shuaib ; and I estimate its cost, complete with tower, lantern, lighting apparatus, dwellings, oil store, &amp;c., complete, at 8,0007. , and its annual maintenance at 400L, inclusive of all depot charges. The light on shore should show two flashes in quick succession every 10 seconds, and be a duplicate of that proposed for Shaikh Shuaib. The establishment should consist of four keepers, who would reside with their families in quarters beside the tower. I estimate the cost of establishing a large gas buoy m the outci aiichoiage at 7501, and its maintenance at 45Z. per annum, inclusive of all depot charges. The light should be single occulting. The gas buoy proposed by the Committee of Enquiry for the inner anchorage at Ras al Marg would, I estimate, cost COOL complete on its station and 40Z. for annual maintenance, inclusive ol all depot charges. I refrain from stating the candle-power of proposed lighted buoys, in which connection 1 would draw attention to the last paragraph of my remarks under 'Light Vessels.' Shat al Arab. The li^ht vessel proposed to be established outside the Shat al Arab Bar should be'in all respects similar to that described for Ras al Mutaf. The first cost would also be about 9,500L, and the estimated annual maintenance 650L The light should be single flashing every 10 seconds, and the intensity about 40,000 candles. . The crew is estimated to consist of eight men, viz., six on board and two on relief. 1 . The advantages to be derived from this ship as a day mark cannot be over estimated. . . Each of the lighted buoys proposed by the Committee of Enquiry lor the bar would, 1 estimate, cost about G00L complete in place, and involve an annual expenditure of 40L for maintenance, or a total first cost of 2,400?. and an aggregate maintenance of 1607. inclusive of depot chaiges. The characters of the lights could be :— Outer Buoy No. 1 - One occultation every 10 seconds. No. 2 - Two flashes every 10 seconds. ^ No. 3 - One flash every 10 seconds. Inner Buoy No. 4 - One occultation every 10 seconds. The colour of all these lights should be white. Kubbar Island {see Appendix VII.). All ships approaching Koweit from any direction make this island the landfall, and as it is very low and flat, it is most difficult to pick up even in very clear weather, so that a lighthouse on Kubbar Island would be found almost as great a benefit as a daymark as the light by night. The proposed site is only about 6 feet above high water. A cast-iron braced tower similar to that recommended for Shaikh Shuaib would place9 the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about 100 feet above high water or sufficient for the geographical range of 15 miles recommended bv the Committee of Enquiry. It would, 1 consider, be necessary to maintain this lighthouse as a rock station, the reliefs being effected from Koweit, living quarters for men onlv being provided on the island. I estimate the cost of the establishment of the light inclusive of tower, lantern, lighting apparatus, dwellings, stores, &amp;c , complete, at 8 oOO/., and its maintenance at 4001. per annum, inclusive of all sums chargeable against the station for the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. ^ The light should be of the Third Order, and show four flashes in quick succession every 15 seconds as follows :— Flash Eclipse Flash Eclipse Flash Eclipse Flash Rclipse '26 second - 2 *00 seconds '20 second - 2'00 seconds * 26 second - 2'00 seconds '26 second 7*96 seconds Total period 15*00 seconds I he intensity with an incandescent oil burner having a mantle of 55 m/m diameter in the focus of the lens, would be about 85,000 candles. Has al Arz {see Appendix VIII.). The most convenient and best site for a lighthouse at Has al Arz is immediately in rear oi the existing beacon, and nothing is to be gained bv placing the structure on the higher ground inland of this position, as suggested in paragraph 4 of a letter from Major Knox, dated 21st Mav 1907 and printed on page 2 of Paper So. 189, dated oth November 1908. The site there is of blown sand; and, though a lower tower would suffice, the tounuations would be a very expensive item. I he tower should be a braced cast-iron structure about 40 feet hio-h which would place the focal plane of the light at an elevation of about leet a,)0v e high water or sufficient for a geographical range of 12 miles as recommended by the Committee of Enquiry. It should, I consider, be of the I om th idei, and show one wdiite flash everv 5 seconds. This lio-ht lamp 3 Semi ' Watched nature &gt; the luminary being a 2-wick capillary A watchman is already maintained to guard the beacon, and the provision ol another keeper would complete the establishment necessary for the requirements of such a light. \V ith the proposed semi-watched system, the driving clock is arranged to maintain the light in action all night without re-winding, and the lamp to burn without attention. 1 estimato tin 1 cost of such a light, with tower, lantern, and lighting apparatus, oil store, lighthouse store, &amp;c., complete, at 3,000Z. and its mamteViance at 100/. per annum, inclusive of all depot charges. It is noteworthy that the present watchman, a Bedouin, although provided with a house of two rooms of the usual native construction, does not occupv it, piefeiimg to live with his family in a tent of native matting. Local opinion is against the provision of further permanent living quarters as Bedoum prefer the tents. An oil store and lighthouse store room have however, been provided for in the above estimate. I he type oi' light provided for in the estimates embodied in pa^es 9 and 10 of Paper No. 189 of 1908 is, I consider, unsuitable for the position and would not fulfil the conditions laid down by the Committee of Emiuirv! I he estimate for its establishment on the lines proposed is also inadequate. In estimating the cost of erecting the iron tower, &amp;c , it has been assumed that a Loreman ot works to supervise the construction of the foundations, and S. 11.—2. c10 an erecting mechanic, are already engaged in the Persian Gulf, lis no allowance has been made for the sea passages of skilled workmen from England, the employment of whom is recommended on page 11 of Paper 189, dated 5th November 1908. B ahuefn (see Appendix IX.). For the efficient lighting of the approaches to Bahrein, the Committee of Enquiry propose a 20-mile light on the reef at Fasht ad Dibal, a floating light near the present outer bnoy, and gas buoys at Kaseifa and the West Spit. To erect a lighthouse at Fasht ad Dibal would involve an expenditure which 1 estimate at 35,000L The reef is practically awash at low water, and the structure would be subjected to assault by the sea. The estimate provides for a massive concrete base on the coral reef, surmounted by a braced cast-iron structure about 150 feet high, in the design of which the necessary living accommodation would be embodied. The light should be of the Third Order, single flashing every 5 seconds, and the intensity about 100,000 candles. 1 estimate the cost of maintaining siich a lighthouse at 500L per annum, inclusive of wages, ration allowances, stores, oil, structural repairs and painting, and all sums chargeable against the station lor the maintenance of the depot at Koweit. In view of the heavy cost anticipated by the Committee of Enquiry entailed in erecting a lighthouse on Fasht ad Dibal, they suggest the alternative of placing a light vessel about 5 miles north of the reef. The cost of a suitable vessel complete on her station would be about 9,5001., and her annual maintenance about 6501. The light from the light vessel should he single flashing every 10 seconds, and the intensity about 40,000 candles. Whatever form of outer light for marking the approaches to Bahrein be adopted, the Committee of Enquiry propose that a floating light be established near the present outer buoy to mark the entrance to the channel. This light might be a gas boat, with an occulting Fourth Order light of about 500 candle power. Such a vessel would require to be about 65 feet long, and would, I estimate, cost about (),000Z. complete on her station, involving an expenditure of about 2501. for maintenance, inclusive of gas and periodical overhaul. She would have an unattended light and carry no crew. Each of the gas buoys proposed for Kaseifa and West Spit would, I estimate, cost about 600/. complete on its station, and involve an annual outlay of about 401. Summarised, these two schemes for the lighting of Bahrein are as follows:— — First Cost. Annual Maintenance. No. 1. Lighthouse ... Gas boat - Two gas buoys - - - £ 35,000 6,000 1,200 £ 500 250 80 Total - 42,200 830 • No. 2. Light vessel - Gas boat ... Two gas buoys 9,500 6,000 1,200 650 250 80 Total - - . 16,700 980 Either of these schemes, with its attendant heavy lirst cost and maintenance, would, in the opinion of the Committee of Enquiry, be necessary to render ingress and egress of Bahrein harbour practicable and safe by night.11 1 would point out, however, that, since I left the Persian Gulf, I have had 1 *'^ me that leaving Bahrein by night is of much more importance than entering the port, as a vessel, on completing her loading bv night, could leave at any time instead of waiting for daylight. If this'argument be admitted, all that is necessary to render egress from the harbour safe is a gas Imoy at Kaseifa, and another gas buoy with a high and conspicuous superstructure lor a day-mark near the present outer buoy. It is a matter for very serious consideration, however, whether the establishment of these two lights would not tend to induce men to use them for entering Bahrein, as it might involve considerable risk. I estimate the aggregate cost of these two gas buoys at 1,3502. complete on their stations, and their combined maintenance at Sol. per annum inclusive of all depot charges. Beacon. I o erect a suitable structure in place of the present beacon at Bahrein would piobably entail an expenditure of about 5002., and ol. for annual maintenance. Buoys. W ith regard to the question of placing the unlit buoys recommended by the Committee of Enquiry, I estimate the cost as follows ;— Jask. —A fifth class conical buoy at Jask, about 1002. complete with moorings. A sum of about 152. per annum would probably cover its repairs, cleaning, tfcc. Bunder Ahbas. —A second class can buoy at the anchorage at Bunder Abbas, about ^002. complete with moorings, &amp;c. A sum of 202. per annum would probably cover its repairs, cleaning, &amp;c. Koiveit.— l o replace the three existing buoys at Koweit belonging to the British India Company with two fifth class buoys and one second class can buoy, would probably involve an outlay of about 4002., and an annual expenditure of about 502 for maintenance. Jadum. — r l o replace the existing Jadum buoy with a fifth class conical buoy would cost about 1002., and about 152. for annual maintenance. The unlit buoys required are, therefore, as follows:— Four fifth class buoys, plus two spare - - (3 Two second class buoys, plus one spare - - 3 Total . . . . 9 All of the unlit buoys could be constructed in Bombay.
