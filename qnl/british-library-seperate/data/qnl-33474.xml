He is dismissive of the threat of French designs against the British in India, but questions whether the Persians would get any extra benefit from a French controlled India.Also mentioned is that the Resident has arranged for a series of gifts to be sent to Nasuroollah Khan which are now in the charge of Jaffer Ali Khan's [Ja‘afar ‘Alī Khān] servant; an itemised list of these is provided. Jaffer Ali Khan is also advised on the accounts he is to keep in order to claim expenses from the British and it is requested that he obtain as much intelligence on the French as can be safely gathered. In addition, the Resident also requests advice on a proposed gift to Ḥusayn ‘Alī Mirzā, the Prince at Sheraz [Shiraz].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100075534085.0x000081#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
