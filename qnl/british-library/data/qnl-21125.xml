Conversation v;ith ^iad TTanza on March 16th 1036 refrardin* the Eastern and smith eastern frontiers of 3audi Arabia. I reverted to this subject in the conversation with ’hiad y , the general nature of which I have recorded in a separate minute. I said that His Majesty's Govern ment were studying the reaction of the Saudi Government to the new proposals which I had communicated to the latter during ray visit to Riyadh. It would he difficult as I had then foreshadowed, t 0 modify our nroposals but f he examination of the matter was proceeding. tfor the moment, I was instructed to tebe up one matter that of the Tebel Hakhah which was one of thp most crucial, issues, thoughpe others also presented dif^icultv. I reminded 'hiad ! ^ev that he had exn3*essed doaht at Hivadh as to whether the Andlo-Qatar Treaty of 1916 had been communicated to the Saudi Government. He had admitted that this was not of material importance but in any case there could be no doubt on the subject, as this particular treaty had been mentioned specifically in Fr. Bakins' note of December 4th 1927. *^ ie y re aty must m fact have accompanied the note, as, if it had been udi Governmer f . Riyadh raised a ouesti His Majesty's Government bed ins nstructed me to elucidate thev* © the question of fact, hut, in making the erniuiry I wan directed to nake, thev were not prejudicing the quention of law. 'Aiad 3ey had aaserted a legal theory, to which I had demurred. The question of lav; wan difficult and required further study. 4. Ab regards the question of fact. His Majesty's Gov ernment had many records previous to 1916. They had no record in their own archives of any such agreement an that invoked hy Tuad ^ey a* Riyadh. Hie Political Agent at Bahrain had therefore naid a special visit to the Gheikh of r^atar on January 20 th. ’'he Gheikh had e ffirmed mont positively that he had no recollection of any agreement hy which he had given up the Jehel Nakhsh. 7. sunned up the relevant pas^ageo in C 0 1 .

P * In the of '■he conversation, I adverted to the nesoapes reported by Col.

I have recoraed separately the portion of my first formal conversation witn Shaiim Yusuf Yasin yesterday in which we resumed u he discussion of the proposed prolongation of the ireaty of Jeada and connected questions. I have explained in that record that i ai^ not wish Shaiith Yusuf to think that I was coniining my attention to that subject, because I had t^aen it first; ana that X therefore pruposely went on to the question oi the Eastern and South Eastern frontiers. ^ reminaea Shaixh Yusuf that, wnen discussing the frontier question with me at Riyadh, Faud hey had invoxed an agreement between Ibn Saud and the ShaiKh of Qatar prior to the Anglo-Qatar Treaty of 191o and hao held that, whatever the position might be now, the Shaikh was then a free international agent.. He had said that by tne alleged agreement, Ibn Saud had recognised the Shaiim's right to the Jebel Dukhan ana the Araiq but that the Jebel Naksh had been left to Ibn Saud. Faud Bey's contention as to the Shaikh's position before 1916 raiseu a very difficult legal issue but my Government, as practical people, wished in the first instance to be informed on the simple question of fact. The Shaikh of Qatar had no recollection of any such agreement. His Majesty's Government would line particulars of it and a -opy. I Had put this to Fuad Bey on March 16th. fle had not reverted to the subject. This astonished me. Surely, if the agreement existed, it could be produced at short notice. Vie had given all our agreements with tne Persian Gulf rulers to the Saudi Government ,-nu were justified in expecting tne information for which I ftact a s^ed. b. Shaikh Yusuf was most evasive. It became clear in /the/ 7 . - 2 tiie 0 ns-/ling conversation tiiat h.e ^new very little about wnat Fuaa Bey haa said anu equally little about tne whole business, ne suggested at an early stage that the King might have 'allowed' the Shaikh to have certain places. I retorted snarply tnat 1 tooK exception to language of* this sort^ useo. as though it rested with Ibn Saud to determine the Shaikh*s rights. The Shaiitn was an independent ruler, who had conlided the charge of his foreign affairs to His Majesty*s Government. He was not Ibn Saud*s vassal. 4. At a latex stage Shaikh Yusuf tiled to make our tnat the authority of tne Shaikh of Qatar did not extend beyond what ne called the Safhat al Qatar. This expression being new to me, I asne^ whether the Safhat included the Jebel Dukhan and the Araiq. Shaikh Yusuf replied in the negative ana tried to make out tnat Ibn Saud exercised authority in those two areas. I expressed amazement. Fuad Bey nad said that the King had ceded those two areas over twenty years ago. Shaikh Yusuf now accused the King of having nung on to them ever since. 5. Shaiith Yus^f invited me to &amp;sx tne Shaikh of Qatar whether it was not a fact that Ibn Saud hela the ar e as in question. I said tnat I should not liKe to ask the Shaikh to bring such an accusation, which I was sorry to hear frcm tne lips of Shaiiih Yusuf. As regaras tne main issue the^^aikh haa already been questioned. Heheld in principle tnat nis 1 ~£ nts extended to Salwu but ne was not now claiming tnat place, as Ibn baud had taKen it. ne claimed most emphatically tne Jebel Dukhan ana the Jebel Naksh, as being in relation to Qatar ana the Jebel Dushan 'as the nose is to the face'. Under further pressure to produce the alleged agree- ment, Shaikh xusuf iuggested that Fuad Bey would have to be asked about it. I scoutea this. Fuad bey nad invoked an agreement ana I presumed it was either in tne archives of the King’s Diwan or those of the Ministey of Foreign Affairs.7. After some more wrangling. Shaikh Yusuf asked whether the frontier question was to be settled on the basis of Saudi proposals or our proposals or on what basis. I recitea with what patience I coula tne main stages during tne past year. Fuaa Bey nau infermed me of the Saudi desiderata on April Brd 1935. The subject had be n discussed in London in June-July. I had taken new proposals to Riyadh. These had been rejected. One of the Saudi objections to them was that our proposeu oounuary ran south of the Jebel Naksh and Fuad Bey had involed the agreement for which I was asking. The negotiations must proceed on the same basis as that on which I was about to leave Shaikh Yusuf; one foot befor-u the other, step by step ana not by a flying leap from one ena of the room to the other. 8 . I was deliberately provocative in this conversation, which I have described only in its main outlines. I iriitated Shaikh Yusuf all the more as it was very late and he was longing to get rid of me. He is notoriously most difficult in negotiations ana it is desirable sometimes to go for him not ana strong. He irritated me too, so that the conver- 3 tion, thouth mostly friendly in form was aci at times and sub-acid throughout. My objects were tneeefold, viz. (a) t^at statedin the first paragraph above, (b) to keep it well before Shaikh Yusuf, without making it a main point, tnat we controlled the foreign relations of Qatar; ana (c) to press him as iictrd as possible about the alleged pre 191b agreement.

He had no counter proposals to mane to latest offer of his Majesty* a Govern ment, claimed that southern boundary proposed by Eaudi Government waa based on essential needs of tribes and professed indifference to suggestion that line along longtltude 55 L might be moved eastwards, on the ground that country thereabouts is desert. Taking aov&amp;nUge of cnange of Minister he tried the transparent manoeuvre ^ pretending that His Majesty*s Government had always been most keen about Khor al Odeid and much less so about Jabal Nuaksh 'which Eaudi Gcverrssent r eg arced as most important, 1 held out no hope of any concession beyond on* mentioned above and se id I could only report to you.- 2 - 2 . If problem bac not been complicated by oil I should have been in favour of leaving it in abeyance for a while. As things are I can only suggest this: (1) to counter Fuad’s manoeuvre and leave baudi Government unaer no illusion I should tell him that His Majesty’s Government regard both Jabal Nuaksh anu Khor ai Odeid as essential. At the same time I should ask him on what other parts of frontier he thinks he and I could produce joint proposals that would appeal to our Governments. ( 2 ) meanwhile it should be considerec .hetiitr His Majesty’s Government could afford to offer further slight concession at dufuk and on borders of Oman and Aden Protectorate# 2 # I know difficulties in second su gestion ana I arr extremely doubtful whether sucn concessions ^ould induce Ibn baud to mane formal renunciation of Jabal Nuaksh, but alternative seems to be to do nothing. I have impression that Ibn baud would regard Sufuk as a substfcntial gain but I know nothing about the merits of his claim to that place. - BULLAhl -—-Ak- CONFIDENTIAL. No. 21-S of 19 37.

The Khor itself is out of the question for steamers owing to its long, winding, narrow entrance (unless even if practicable vast dredging v/oriss were undertaken) • Parts of tne banks are low ^sabakhsh* which flood at high tides or after heavy rain and parts are low sand hii-s. The heat from these hills is terrific. It is possible for steamers to anchor some distance off the mouth of the Khor (l have seen n Shoreham n and another sloop there), but the navigation to get there is very difficult (though 1 suppose that a passage could be buoyed, if it were a question of an oil terminal). 6, If Bin ka ! ud is once accorded any formal n free transit 0 or other similch* facility, it will mean in practice a wedge of Sa f udian authority and intrigue inserted between Abu Dhabi and Qatar, and we shall be regarded as having sold our friends to their powerful neighbour, I most earnestly deprecate any such compromise, both on behalf of our friends, the Rulers of Qatar and Abu Dhabi, and on behalf of our own good name along the Trucial ^oast. 7, I do not think that, from the local point of view, it is possible to make any further concession so far as Qatar or tne Trucial Coast is concerned, 8, Though 1 am in the wood so perhaps only see the trees, I personally think that we have already offered to* give considerably more tnan Bin “aiud could have really hoped to get and I cannot help feeling that it is partly our compliance which has encouraged him to press the matter as far as he has.It h£S also to be remembered that Bln Sa*ud cannot live for ever and too great admissions now may prove embarrassing to us in the years to come.

If it is a day with a sandstorm, so that nothing can be seen, it may be necessary to come on the next morning, the 5th March, but we shall not postpone the flight unless it is absolutely necessary. 4. It is possible that you may be able to telegraph to me from Abu Dhabi through the Geologists 1 wireless; otherwise please send a special messenger to Sharjah Badio by car to inform me whether you have been able to make the necessary arrangements and in particular whether the Shaikh’s representative can reach Sufuk wells in time to be ready on the early morning of the 4th March. 5. There is no objection to your going with the Shaikh’s man if you find that it is desirable for you to do so. Please state in your telegram whether you are going. 6. After the Shaikh’s man has seen the aeroplane circle round the wells he can return to Abu Dhabi. 7. For your personal information there will be with me a representative of the Foreign Office in London and probably the Honourable the Political Resident. 8. Please impress on Shaikh ohakhbut and Shaikh Khalifah that it is very important from their point of view that we should know exactly where Sufuk wells are in order that we may be in a position to know whether we can support his claim to them. Indeed, if he makes any difficulty, you can emphasise that it will be very difficult for us to support his claim w ; ith success unless we are in a position to say that we know exactly where the wells are. a.

The Government of India agree in your view that Shaikh Zaid^ right to Odeid la undoubted, but the Chief can have no claim to British support in re-occupying a place which he admits hi 3 inability to hold unaided and which has apparently remained deserted ever since the flight of Shaikh Batay and the demolition of its habitations by the Chief of Abu Dfliabi himself in 1878. Past experience, moreover, shows that the place has been a source of cons iderable trouble to the Shaikh, being used as a resort j[ vide letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, No.232 dated 30tn October 1878, and No.20 from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the secretary to the t Government of India in the Foreign Department, dated the 14tn January 1879. j v by aeceders from his authority and as a refuge by pirates. If the Shaikh were now again to people tne place, it is probable that the settlers would again secede and would form a fresh cause of embarrassment to Sha ikh ii&amp;id. 3* From the point of view of British interests there appears at present to be no reason why the Government of India should lend their support to the enterprise.

There will be no reason for wishing to establish a port to rival those of 151 Katr, and indeed it Ad II probably be inadvisable that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi should re-occupy a place which has been a cause of contention between himself and the Dintnani family in the past, and the re-population of which might easily become a source of fresh quarrels in the future. 4. For the above reasons, the 'government of India are inclined to think that in present circumstances the place should be left uninhabitea and that, unless there are other strong reasons which have not been merit ioned, there are, at the present time, no sufficient advantage in lending any encouragement to the re-occupati on of the place by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi- Before passing final orders in the matter, however, I am to enquire whether Colonel Kembail’s suggestion was actuated by fcny considerations other than those mentioned in his letter. \ I nave the honour to be, sir, Your most obedient servant, sd.

To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In continuation of my telegram Ko. 85 dated the P4th March 1937 3 I have the honour to inform you that I carried out the air reconnaissance to fix the position of Sufuk Wells on the forenoon of the 23rd March. 2* Arrangements had been made beforehand for the Resi- dency Agent to proceed to Sufuk Wells with a reliable man from Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan of Abu Dhabi to guide him 5 so that in future there can be no question of any doubt that in Abu Dhabi the wells in question are what are known/as Sufuk Wells; and that he (the Residency Agent) should spread a white cloth 30 yards by 10 yards on the ground at the wells and light a smoky fire to help us to pick up the place. 3. We quartered the ground north and south in the pro bable area starting from roughly Donat an Nakhalah (Admirclty Chart 2837 b). The information obtained in Abu Dhabi (see paragraph 3 of my telegram No. 150 dated the 4th November 1935) proved reliable and vie saw the viiite cloth at the second turn.4. Bearings were taken from about 7000 feet on various points aud a comparison of them makes Sufuk Wells twelve miles due south of Has as Sila, with a possibility of an error ox naif a mile either way. An attempt to check by wireless bearings on Sharjah and Bahrain was not successful It should be remembered that the coast line in that vicinity as shown in the Chart is not very accurate, so that bearings taken on points shown in the Chart may have tne effect of putting Sufuk on the Chart slightly out of ito actual position, but its position is now fixed suffi ciently accurately for our present purpose. 5. luring our first flight inland, while quartering, we proceeded probably some 40 miles roughly south west from near Dohat an Hakhalah and the country appeared all the same — patches of sand with low dunes alternating with patches of salty plain. The land over which we passed was a barren waste without even desert bushes to alleviate its desolation. 6. I am most grateful to the Air Officer Commanding British Forces in ^raq, for placing aircraft at my disposal for this reconnaissance and to Flight-Lieutenant A.Allen of No, 84(Bomber) Squadron who carried out the flight and would request that, if there is no objection, my thanks may be con veyed to them* 7# I snould like to commend the Residency Agent for the arrangements made for proceeding to and marking the Wells, which enabled us to pick them up without difficulty or delay.

Mr. Phil by's expedition to tne soutn and question of southern frontier of Saudi Arabia. j 5Cody Np .i 37 (269/316/8) British legation, Tedda. Febrnary 1937. In accordance with the Instructions .onyeyed l„ tne last paragraph of your telegram .No. 135, dated Lecember 5th, regarding Mr. Phllby's expedition into the ^ Aden Protectorate, I had the honour to send you, in ay telegram No. 9 of February 22nd, an outline of Mr.Philby's attitude. I now transmit a full summary of statements whicn he maae to me in the course of a conversation on February 18th. The collapse of his motor transport and later, heavy floods, delayed his return so long that he had only a few hours in Jedaa before leaving for Mecca for the pilgrimage, but during that short time he called at the Legation and he talked freely about his journey. 2. As I anticipated, isr. Philby was in his most heroic Prometheus mood. Indeed, he was even more difficult than 1 haa expected, for to his desire to bring the light of science to mankind is now added a quite ferocious in- tent ion to expose the alle^eh duplicity of Hie ifa,jesty r B Government towards the Arabs of the Peninsula. He asserts that the second part o^ this programme v/as added only under the provocation which he considers he received fro ;3 the Aden authorities. I aid not enter upon a discussion of the pledges given or alleged l jto have been given in respect of Arab independence. I haa never studied the McMahon correspondence closely from the point of view of the Arabian peninsula, and in any casdit would be unwise to treat Mr. Philby as the protagonist of the Arab clairas. Moreover I Had in hand the less nebulous argument that Shabwa lav outside the extre^ 1 traits ever claimed by the * /Sat: hiSaudi Sovornment. Mr. Pnilby’s attitude towards tmt fact is shown in paragraph 6 of the enclosed record, de professes to demand independence for the Arabs in the Arabian peninsula without regard to the Saudi demands, of which he however claimed to be fully aware. tie informed me that he nad 0 n hi s maps the two proposed frontiers in the south, the British and tne Saudi. In that case he was aware before he set out for Shabwa tnat it lay beyond the limits claimed by the Saudi Government. 3. Mr. Philby is unable to see that ne treated Ibn 3 a ud badly in obtaining a n escort for topographical work and explora tion in Saudi Arabia and using it, unknown to his patron, to enter territory outside Saudi Arabia. As to the Aden authorities, he regards their claim to Snabwa as a trespass on territory which was abandoned by His Majesty's Government in favour of Arab independence in tne McMahon correspondence. In that correspondence His Majesty^ liovernraent agreed to recognise nne independence of tne Arab coantries 1 * witnin tne limits laid lo.vn by the Sherif Hussein, wnicn included tne wnole of tne Arabian peninsula except Aden and, possibly, tne Arab states on one Persian Julf, but tney added the proviso: 'witnout prejudice to the existing treaties with Arab chiefs,' Probably • Phixcy would say that His Majesty’s Government had no treaty then and have none now with the Arab chief of Snabwa, and regard that as the last word on a subject of great practical and legal complexity. I assume that the observations of the Chief Commissioner of Aden on Mr. Philby's claims will be recorded in due course. At first sight it seems to me that there is just enough truth in Mr. Philby ’3 contention to afford a moral shelter behind which he can indulge his personal tastes and feelings and interests to the full. Mr. Philby’e claim that from the political point of view his /hlS ex P edltlon w »3 on all fours with that of Mr. Bertram Tnomaa ia unfounded. It ia true tirnt Mr. Ttiomas waa at the time in tne employ of the Sultan of Muacat, but he had no official escort, and the Sultan had never given reason to anyone to suppose that he wished to increase hia territory. Moreover the whole of Mr. Thomas's route lay to the east of tne Blue Line which at the time of the McMahon correspondence represented -ne legal western boundary of the territories of those Arab chi ef s on the Persian 'Julf with whom His Majesty's Government had treaties. Mr. Philoy would probably say that the Turks had no authority to agree to the Blue Line, which took no account of their defeatat the hands of Ibn Baud, xn but he does not know that Ibn Saud has recently admitted that His Majesty's Croveminent saved nim from being crushed by the Turks, This admission was made in the message transmitted through Shaikh ^Yasin which I reported in my despatch No*283 dated October 11th, But in any case Mr, Philby could not be expected to i ox ego an opportunity to use Mr, Thomas as a stick with which to beat His Majesty^s Government. Tne statements recorded in paragrcvpn o or the enclosure left little doubt in my mind that Mr.Philby did enter the territory ol the King of the jfemen, and since he cannot accuse the King oi' encroaching on Arab territory he will nave tc find another excuse for the encroachment whicn the King Mgntly resented. But he will probably think the purity of his intentions sufficient excuse. 6. Mr 0 Philoy does not seem to nave entered the band of territory lying between tne proposed British and Saudi lines, but he may have gathered some information about it.

It is unlikely that Mr. Phil by has collected any better informaticn on this point than Bertram Thomas, who passed through tne territory in question and halted at Shisur, but he may make it more difficult for Ibn Saud to renounce his claim, by representing tne tribes thereabouts as entirely beyond the control of the authorities in the coastal states but ready and willing to submit to Ibn Saud. Ibn Saud is so much more a statesman than Mr.Phil oy that I am hopeful that nothing Mr. Pniloy can say will influence him in this matter, the more so as having repudiated responsi bility for the expedition he can hardly quote the results to his own advantage. I am more anxious lest the appearance of the promised attack 0 n His Majesty’s Government in Mr. Phil by *s next book should drag the question of the smaller Arab states in the Arabian peninsula into the vortex of controversy about the McMahon correspondence. 7.

R # W.BULLARD.SUMMARf of statements made by Mr. Pniiby about his expedition to Shabwa and beyond, in the course of a conversa tion which he had with His Majesty's Minister on the 18th l?ebri&amp;ry 1937. 1. It was ^uite true tnat Ibn Saud n a d notnirig to do vith t he expedition beyond instructing all local officials t0 asslst nira# ?iiilby had defrayed all the expenses himself (and they had turned out to be much heavier than he had expected), though he had financed nimaelf by drawing on Saudi treasuries, where they existed, and refunding the advances through his firm in Jedda. The object of the journey was purely scientific, and he had in fact collected a great mass oi iniormation which he hoped would be of use to science, and md established the position or over a hundred points. Throughout the expedition the only connection he had had vbl tn Ibn Saud was that as a matt er of courtesy whenever he was within reach of a Saudi telegraph station he sent a telegram to the King reporting the date of arrival and the probable date of departure. 00 snow that the journey had originally no concern with politics he could state that he had written all he had intended to s ay about the Nadhramaut before he started back from Shibam, l«e., before the oreakdown of one of his cars compelled him to go to Mukalla to try t 0 get a new back-axle. The chapter was colourless, in spite of the fact that he had 'seen a lot of things’* about which he might npve written. But after the reception he received when he applied to the Resident at Aden for assistance he had changed his mind. Having been attacked he proposed to defend himself, and he would add chapters to nis forthcoming book which would tell the world• V W ity - 2 - tne factg about the Aden Protectorate. He was prepared to give Hia aaj esty's Minister ala theee facts, but he also proposed to gi * c 'tiisiii lio tii© 3&amp;ud i Government • 3. The criticism directed against his visit to Shabwa was entirely unjustixied. His journey was on all fours with tmt of Bertram Thomas across the Hub- al Khali. He was quite right in claiming that apart from the Hadhramaut his journey lay in unexplored, undemarcated territory. To claim Shabwa and those parts for the Aden Protectorate was fantastic, for no protection was afforded. Nor could the Aden authorities claim the virtue of leaving the people thereabouts to manage their own affairs, for they bombed them. The Aden attitude towards anabwa was exactly like that of the Italians towards Walwal a t the beginning of the Italo.Sthiopian dispute, and British policy was no more honest than that of Italy had been. The British were trying to expand at the expense or tne Arabs. Hi.* policy remained what it nad always been, vi z ., to try to obtain for the Arabs what they were promised early in the (ireat fer. He had challenged His Majesty's Government to publish the promises made then (the McMahon correspondence), but with their habitual cowardice they had refused. There were plenty of copies in Arabic to be had, but the English correspondence ought to be published # He would tell His Majesty’s Minister a 'Secret'* he used to possess copies of the correspondence in English, given t '° T.E.Lawrence* but they were stolen from him by a clerk of his in Jedda. 5# He w as interested to near (for the first time) that the King of the Yemen had protested to Ibn Sand, alleging that the expedition had entered Yemen territory at Jauf and Marib. He wondered how the King had heard about it. In point of fact he had hot gone to Marib, but had taken photographs and bearings from a height /height from which it wa8 risible. (Ur. Phil by evaded, or at leaet did not answer, the question whether the height in question was in Yemen territory), 6 ’ * 0 ' U WaS n0t &lt;1Uite corre ^ to say that ne was asking for more for Ibn Saud than Ibn Saud was askir^ for himself, though it was near the truth. *hat he wanted was the establishment of the promised Arab independence in the Arab Peninsula and the elimination of any foreign rule which conflicted with the {remises. Mr. Philby claimed to know all about the British and Saudi proposals for the southern frontier of Saudi Arabia and to nave the two lines marked on maps in his possession. men His Majesty's Minister said that in that case he must have known tnat Shabwa l^ weli t0 tne 80Utn Qf ^ ^tuda line, he said tiat the position of tihabwa on the map was a long way out, but he did not deny that Sha bwa was even farther to the south than the mapjshows and therefore at a greater distance from tne extreme limits claimed by Ibn S a ud than appeared from the map.CONFIDENTIAL.

It is true that the position of the southern end of the ^ahana has never been fixed, but such evidence as we have oeems .o show that a line drawn south 30 degrees east from the southern end of the westerly edge of the bahana would cut the const well to the east of iJharbat Ali, the point of division Mis Hadhraiaaut and Oman.

Dear sir Reader Bullard, The moment I received Your Excellency’s letter No* 393/430/22 of 23rd March 1937 I hastened to put right the point which Your Excellency raised. In the interview I had in haste with Your Excellency at your house just before noon on Tuesday 10th Muharram (22nd March 1937) I explained to you that I did not believe that H.M.the King, in his conversation to which you referred, meant A1 ’Ureyq, but Dukhan* There was a slip of the tongue© After I left Your Excellency I enquired of His Majesty concerning the actual fact, and His Majesty stated that he did not intend that place which is south of Naksh, but the one which is south of Dukhan which makes Naksh within the Saudi Arab Kingdom. During the conversation His Majesty did not think of giving up the claim concerning the frontiers put forward by the Government of His Majesty. His Majesty’s statement was accidental and did not concern the details of the case. The question was not one of discussing the exact position of the frontiers and I therefore think the question still stands where it did.Copy Saudi Arab Kingdom* H*M.the King^s Diwan* Political Section. 10 th Muharram 1356. 23rd March 1937. x have spoken clearly about the historical stages in the relations between me and the British Government, all of which have been courteous and consistently amicable on my part, and sometimes on the part of the British. But what filled me with misgiving, much annoyed me and affected ny honour i a the two following points: (1) The question of the frontiers of Qatar, Oman and other principalities of the Gulf. (2) The question of trade and marine transport. As regards the first point, these territories themselves, as you are aware, were under the aizerainty of my ancestors and until the time of my grandfather Faisal paid an annual tax for the preservation of the relationship of vassal to overlord. But in view of our desire for the continuation of our friendship with the British Government and the said Amirs to whom we are bound by old ties, we have recognised their positions in the Persian Gulf and their principalities and have respected the treaties between them and the British Government. But it never entered my head that this could be a reason for taking away a part of our territories and annexing it to those territories at a time when everyone admits that the Peace which those places enjoy is due to God and to us. It is not reasonable that such pressure should be due to suspicion of us or to doubt as to our intentions or our friendship or to the accusation that we covet a territory which is ours. For the covetous man does not covet a mountain or an inlet; he covets rather a densely populated country. That we eare for is the protection of our honour and the defence of the rights of our subjects and tribes.2 - ilo Aa to the question of trade I know that ships call at, and carry goods and all kinds of merchandise to, ports on the Persian G ulf which are less important than mine, and I who count myself the oldest friend of Britain and the greatest of the Arabs am placed at the mercy of Kuwait or Bahrain; and whenever the question is raised, it is said that it is one for the shipping companies. I did not believe that friends could treat each other in such a cruel manner. Praise be to God who granted me and my country more power than that of Kuwait, Bahrain and Abjfu Dhabi Ac, &lt;yhy should ships call at those places and mine suffer deprivation in that no ships call there. I hope you will, as you have stated, consider the situation as it is and a veil will be drawn ever the past if its mistakes can thus be corrected. Otherwise you may inform me of the real reasons. I have summarised in this letter that I have told you at length in my conversation.\ (Received under Jedda Printed letter No.448/430/34 of the 27th March, 1937). No® 47© ■(TdV^o/Sn). British Legation, J edda. 27th March, 19 37. Sir, !« / 1 hav '® the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a record made by Mr. Hendel of a discussion which we had with Shaikh Yusuf Yasin and Shaikh Hafiz Wahba on March 19th, about the eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia in and near the region of ^atar. The record is accompanied by two sketch maps made ( !&gt; by Mr. Rendel, viz. (1) the Jabal Naksh area, (2) Khor al Ode id* K? j.n acc^adance with the instructions conveyed in your telegram Ho.l of January 4th I had for some time been discuss, ing the southern frontier with Fuad Bey, as neither His Tfejestys Government nor Ibn Saud felt able to give way about either Jabal Naksh or Khor al Odeid. The information collected by Mr. Rendel on the spot seemed however to be so clear, that I fully agreed with him that it would be worth while to make an effort during his stay in Jedda to come to an agreement on this the most difficult part of the frontier m the hope that this potential cause of friction, perhaps dangerous friction in time of crisis, might be cleared out of the way. The history of the case subsequent to the discussion recorded by Mr. Hendel is given in my despatches Ho.41 of March 23rd and No,46 of March 27th, but for convenience of reference I summarise the relevant portions of those despatches here. 3. At an interview with Ibn Saud 0 n March 21st Mr.Rendel made an appeal for a settlement of the Jabal Naksh - Khor al Odeid -Sufuk (Safaq) portion of the frontier, Ibn Saud Th e Right Hon'ble Anthony 3den,MC. ,KP., repeated / stc#, c., etc.i'-K //V 2 - repeated his familiar argument that the whole of the ec a st used to belong to his ancestors and that the present rulers v'isuld not deny it. It was true that he had recognised the treaties between the coastal rulers and His Majesty's Govern, ment in the Hadda Agreement, but on the question of the boundaries there was a limit beyond which he could not go. ■'he boundary of (Jqtar was well known to be Araik ('Uraiq) which was in the nufud. The maps which were at hand were examined, but none showed Araik. I said that unless my memory was a t fault I had seen a map on which Araik was shown to the south of Jabal ITakshs if that were so there would no longer be any disagreement on this point. Ibn Saud then turned to Khor al Ode id and said that in claiming it for Saudi Arabia he was thinking of the interests cf His Majesty's Government as much as of his own. No one else could govern that region, yhen crimes were comitted there it was to him that the people applied for redress© 4. On my return to the legation I found that in the only map that showed Araik (that enclosed in I£r. Rendel's letter No. S.228/35/91 of January 16th 1S36 to Sir Andrew Ryan) it was in fact shown just north of q*sr al S alwa i.e. exactly where we have proposed that the boundary should run. I also consulted telegram No.92 which the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf sent to the India Office on February 1st 1936, which supports this view. I therefore wrote to Shaikh TJusuf Y as in suggesting that the definition of the boundary given by the King left Jabal Td.cuh to Qatar. His reply, which is given as a n enclosure to my despatch No.46 dated 27th March, if confused in some respects, is clear enough in denying that the King admitted that Q^tar included Jabal Naksh and in implying that the boundary runs between /-3- ft) 'li.A' i between Jab a l XiKais Dukhan and Jabal Ilaksh. I have since discussed the matter with Shaikh Yusuf Yas in as well as one can discuss a subject with a man who admits /hat he knows noohxng about it# He quotes Yu ad Bey's statement of April 3rd 1935, a copy of which was sent to you in Sir Andrew Rian's despatch No. 109 of April 7th 1935, and declares that that ^ etter 8t 111 ^Presses the King's views. Now this statement ( ' assunes, in its first paragraph, that there is an area lying between .Tabal Dukhan and Jabal Naksh, and although we know, from MT. Nendel's observations, that Jatel Naksh is only a Part of the Jabal Dukhan which is slightly higher than the adjacent crest, this difference in our premises will never be settled by looking at maps in Jedda, and I feel that if the argument is to be pursued profitably, responsible representa tives of the two sides will have to visit the spot together and to come to an agreement about the physical features. 5. I have however suggested in my telegram No.24 dated 25th March that it is not desirable to try to force a settle ment on the frontier question $t the present moment. If what seemed to be the overwhelming evidence obtained by Mr.Rendel had convinced Ibn Saud it would have been an excellent thing, but the note which forms the second enclosure to my despatch No.46 dated March 27th shows clearly that he is not convinced ✓y' and that the frontier on the east remains a veiy sore point with him. liven this feeling, and the difference of opinion about the physical features in the Jabal Naksh, I feel that to continue to urge Ibn Saud at present to accept our point of vie.v would be useless, and would go far to counteract the good effect of the conversations which took place during Mr.Rendel's visit. in any case I think that no decision to continue to M4 press /-4- preas fur the frontier *e want should be taken until you have had an opportunity to consider the matter in the light of the ✓ recent conversations, and I have recommended this in my above -mentioned telegram Ho.24. In the meanwhile I have sent replies to the two communications on this and kindred subjects \ . wllich formed the enclosures to my despatch No,46, but I have foreborne to press our claim. Copies of these replies are enclosed. In one I acknowledge receipt of Ibn Saud’s ccmplaint against being hemmed in by His Majesty’s Government on the east, in the other I transmit to the Saudi Government the information about the position of Sufuk which has been received m Bahrain telegrams Nos.64 and 65 dated March 23rd arrl 24th * and give my opinion that there is some serious discrepancy between the Saudi information and our own as to the physical features in the Jabal Naksh region. 6. It may be said that as we have made up our minds about Jabal Naksh and Khor al Odeid Ibn Saud has nothing to gain by delay while we stand to lose in that a cause of friction is left which might lead to trouble at a time of crisis. I do not think that either of these arguments is completely sound. Ibn saud may feel that he cannot hope to obtain either of the two coveted areas, but that is not the same as signing the places away in writing and thus belittling himself in the eyes of the Arab world. As to the danger likeiy to result from an undetermined frontier, I suggest that the fear of such a danger can be exaggerated. If there should ever be war in which His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia were on opposite sides, it is not a description of the frontiers on paper that would prevent Ibn Saud from trying to advance to the shores of the Persian Gulf at various points, while if Ibn Saud were on our side or neutral he would not disturb the status quo. Every thing now suggests th*t he realises that his interests and those of His Majesty’s Government are bound up with each other and /-5- and if we are unable to give him all that he aeice for we should at least, I think, refrain from pressing him to make an admission that v/e can do without* 7. In order that our claim may not go by default we might suggest that a jioint commission should visit the Jabal Naksh - A raik area and examine the physical features on the spot. It is beginning to be a little late in the year for such a task, and we might suggest the end of the year as a suitable time. Then I would urge that we should examine carefully the possibility of giving ibn Saud a royalty on ary oil that may be struck in or near Jabal Naksh on the pretext tiat the oil-bearing strata must run partly under his terri- t0ry - In des i &gt;8t ch No.38 3 dated Uth March 1937 on the finances of Saudi Arabia I stressed the poverty of this country and the strain that will be placed upon Ibn Saud if the search for oil and minerals in his territoiy continues to be unsuccessful and oil should be discovered, as it has been at Bahrain, in the territozy of some minor Shaikh like the Shaikh of Qatar. Anything that can reasonably be done to reduce this risk should be done. 8 * 5 ' rC,n correspondence going back to 1904 of which copies have been received from Bushire it is clear that the Government of India have always regarded Khor al Ode id as belonging to Abu Dhabi. on the other hand it seems equally clear that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi never exercised any authority there then and Ibn Saud claims that it is he who exercises authority there now, though it seems that the population is very scanty, if indeed the area contains any inhabitants a t all. But even if it were possible to induce the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to give Up T ' h ° r al ° deid t0 Ibn s a ud I d °«bt whether the transfer would /would be worth the making, since it would not give Ibn Saud the port he needs, and we should have made a political sacrifice without gaining the advantage which I think we stand to gain from any improvement in Ibn Saud’s economic position• 9, Copies of this despatch and enclosures are being sent to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushir e.

Sir Reader Bullard and I called on Shaikh Yusuf Yasin on March 19th to discuss the frontier question. Shaikh Hafiz Wahba and a secretary from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Muhammad Shaikho) were also present. Shaikh Hafiz interpreted with sir Reader Bullard’s assistance. 1. 2. Sir Reader began by explaining that not long ago, according to the records he had seen, there had been some thirty questions outstanding between Great Britain and Saudi Arabia. These had now happily been reduced - as regards questions of major importance - to threes- i.e. the Eastern and southern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia, the Transjordan frontier and the Kuwait Blockade. He explained that I had taken the opportunity of my present journqy to make a special study on the spot of the first of these three questions, §.nd suggested that the occasion of my visit to Jedda might use fully be taken to discuss it in the light of my investiga- tions. 3. Shaikh Yusuf replied that, though certain questions might still be outstanding, no question at issue could make any difference to the firmness of Anglo-Saudi friendship. 4. I explained that while it was happily true that Amglo-Saudi friendship rested on so solid a foundation that such local issues were unlikely ever to disturb it, it was nevertheless wise to take the opportunity of the calmness and cordiality of our friendship to clear up all outstanding points and eliminate as far as we could all potential causes of local friction. An unsettled frontier, as had been shown over and over again elsewhere, was always a potential danger. It /2 It would surely be well then to get the matter finally settled and out of the way as soon as possible. 5. Vfith this end in view I had taken the opportunity of the King’s invitation to me to visit Saudi Arabia to go into the whole matter again with renewed thoroughness. I had dis eased it with the British authorities in the Persian Gulf, I had gone through the relevant archives at the British Residency, and, in order to satisfy myself personally that we were not making any exaggerated or unjustified claims, I had, in compahy with Colonel Fowle, Colonel Loch and Captain de Gaury, flown over and round all the disputed points of the frontier on the northern section of the line, particularly the Jabal Naksh and the Khor al Odeid # I confessed that I had hoped that the facts would prove such as to enable us to offer some further compromise in regard to these two points. Our object, as the Saudi Government well knew, was to meet King I bn Baud’s wishes to the utmost possible extent. But un fortunately iay hopes of finding our case ill founded or of devising a means of suggesting some compromise over the more difficult parts of the line had not been realised. sections of the frontier in detail and that we should begin with the Jabal Naksh. I showed Shaikh Yusuf Yas in our latest map of the qatar Peninsula, and also a sketch map and elevation of the Jabal Naksh and surrounding district which I had drawn myself as a result of my observations from the air (copy attached). I left him a duplicate of this sketch, which showed unmistakably that the Jabal Naksh is geographically an integral part of the Jabal Dukhan and of the Qatar Peninsula. I pointed out that the obvious line for the frontier of the peninsuia ran across tne flat sand south of the Jabal, and I developed I then suggested that we should consider the various II. the /the obvious general arguments against establishing unnatural and unsound frontier lines. 7* Shaikh Yusuf Yasin replied that the King could legitimately claim a great deal more than the Jabal Naksh. All the tribes in this area really owed him allegiance. But he was nevertheless prepared to abandon his rights over the greater part of the area, if the Jabal Naksh remained in his possession. 8 # I answered that this might perhaps have been an argument if he were claiming the whole of qatar. But this was not practical politics. tie had, by our treaties, guaranteed Qatar and the Trucial Shaikhs against absorption by any other Power, and King Ibn Saud had recognised and accepted this situation by the Treaty of Jedda. The integrity of Qatar must therefore be maintained, and we really could not reason ably be expected to accept any claim which would involve its dismemberment. Had any concession in this area been at all possible I could assure Shaikh Yusuf Yasin that I should h a ve been the first person to urge it. 9* I added that, in all the early stages of this dispute there had never been any question of a Saudi claim to the Jabal tfaksh. The claim indeed, which had only been put forward by Fuad Bey Humza at an advanced stage of the controversy, had come as a complete surprise to us. Was it worth then risking a settlement for it ? III. 10. We then passed on to the second part of the frontier i.e. that between Saudi Arabia and the Shaikhdom of Abu Dhabi. This brought us to King Ibn Baud's claim to the Khor al Odeid. 11. I explained that here also I had very greatly hoped that /-4- that something might have been done to meet King Ibn Saud's wishes. But my reading of the archives of the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf had shown that the claim of Aiu Dhabi to this area was far older and stronger than I had imagined and that the Khor al Odeid had been formally recognis ed by us for the past sixty years at least - long before there was any question of ,ny Saudi claim - as the property of the Shaikhdom of Abu Dhabi. 12* I then gave Shaikh Yusuf Yas in a summary of some Of the relevant history, notably the correspondence of 1878, 1881, 1890 ana 1906. (See attached note, of which Sir Reader Bullard gave the Shaiich a copy later) and read him the second paragraph of sir Percy (then Major) Cox's letter of December 1st 1906 to Shaikh said bin Khalifa of A bu Dhabi, which Shaikh Hafiz Wahba translated and which Muhammad Shaikho took down. 13. Shaikh Yusuf Yasin and Shaikh Hafiz Wahba attempted to argue that King Ibn Saud-s recognition by Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda of our special treaty relations with the Trucial Shaikhs did not imply any recognition of ary particular frontiers; but I pointed out that our recognition of a valid claim such a Shaikh to any Particular place formed part of our treaty relations with that Shaikh, and must be regarded as covered by Ibn Sand's recognition of our special relations with him, 14. I added that as regards the Khor a l Odeid itself King Ibn Saud would not be losing anything of any value. The sea here, as I had seen from the air, was a mass of reefs, while the entrance to the Khor was so long, narrow, winding and shallow, that I could not conceive of its being an y use to any one as a harbour. But to us and to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi the continued possession of this area had a different importance, which it could not possess for King Ibn Saud. ffe &lt;Ud not want the Khor al Odeid as a harbour; but the land immed lat ely /-5- immediately to the weat of it afforded the only land passage between Abu Dhabi and ^ a tar, and it wae far more important for Abu Dhabi to retain the caravan route *nd to keep a coterminous frontier with qatar, than for King ibn Saud, who already had good potential harbours at such places as Has Tanura, to obtain a new fragment of sea coast of very problematical value. But in any case, as King Ibn Saud would be the first to realise, could not go back on the categorical undertaking contained in Sir Percy Cox's letter of 1906. IV. 15. »e then considered the next section of the frontier i.e. from the point south west of the Sabkhat Matti where it turns Bast, to the point where it joins the frontier of Muscat and Oman. I said that in regard to this sector the situation seemed to me rather more hopeful. In their note of April 3rd 1935 the Saudi Oovernment had agreed to the Sabkhat Matti and the line of wells described on the latest edition of Hunter's map as the qufa Liwa remaining to Abu Dhabi. All we wanted to be sure of was that the wells of Sufuk, which according to iniormation lay on the caravan route from Abu Dhabi to Doha, should remain, together with the caravan route itsilf, within A bu Dhabi territory. The discrepancy between our line and the Saudi line in this area, which was in any case slight, was due to Sufuk being marked where it was on Hunter's map. But there was some reason to believe that this marking was inaccurate, and that Sufuk wells and the caravan route really l«y rather nearer to the coast. I had hoped to be in posses, aion of accurate information on this point in time to clear up the matter with Shaikh Yusuf Yas in at once. Unfortunately we had not been able to find the wells during our flight, and I had just learnt that it would be impossible for Colonel Loch to complete the further investigation he had at once embarked upon /msmamm - 6 - upon before .veil on in the next week. The point ought not however to lead to serious difficulty since we were really agreed on the main principles involved. 16. shaikh Yusuf said that Sufuk was a Murra well. I replied that we could not accept these progressive claims for the Murra tribe. Te had agreed that Banaiyan was a Murra well and given up Abu Dhabi's claim to it in consequence. But %ll our information showed that the normal Murra dir a ended well to the south west of Sufuk wherever it was. If the Saudi Government always claimed as a Murra well the next well beyond the last well we had conceded, there would be no reason why they should not eventually claim Muscat town. I made as much Play as I could of our concession at Bamiyan, in order to show how ready we had been to concede a point whenever careful enquiry showed that the facts were against us. But this was not so now. V. 17. After a good deal of further discussion in -which the historical and legal aspects of the question/ were touched upon, only to be set aside in favour of a more practical solution on the basis of the situation now existing, sir Header Bullard explained that he had at first expressed the view that it would be best to leave discussions on this part of the frontier in abeyance for the present. But the investigation I had made into the matter had led him to change his mind and he now agreed that it would be far better to get the matter settled and disposed of as quickly as possible. 18. I suggested that, although we had at first proposed tnat the frontier question should be dealt with as a whole, we were now more likely to make progress if we took the various sectors of the frontier one by one. The sector between Saudi Arabia and Muscat involved consultation with the Sultan of Muscat, /7- 1 Muscat, which was not yet completed and would involve further loss of time. The sector between Saudi Arabia and the Hadhra- nsut area of the Aden Protectorate was still being reinvestiga- ted by the Aden authorities, and I could not yet say what might emerge. But for the northern sector, i. a . the frontier with Qatar and Abu Dhabi, we now had practically all the material we could need, and X greatly hoped therefore that a settlement of it could be reached without further delay. I felt sure that, after all that had passed, it would now be best to tackle this frontier bit by bit, 19. shaikh Yusuf did not demur to this suggestion but said he must refer the whole matter to the King. He would do this at once and let us know the result as soon as possible. 80. In conclusion I again urged the desirability of reaching an early settlement. I pointed out that three years ago the position had been that we were taking our stand on the strictly legal position and claiming the 'blue' and 'violet' lines, as a result of much very hard work and of our great desire to go to the utmost limits to satisfy King Ibn Baud we had eventually agreed to concede a very large area to him and had finally put forward the 'Riyadh Line'. I showed Shaikh VU3Uf the8e lineS on the a'* emphasised the extent to which we had modified our attitude in order to show our friendship iOr the King. But what was the position of the Saudi Govern ment ? They had put forward, 0 n April 3rd 1935, a line, which I showed fjhaikh Yusuf on the map, from which they had never retreated an inch. I was no supporter of a policy of bargain ing, and I did not believe in progressive concessions. But now that the new lines were so close to each other as to approximate within a few miles, I felt the time had really 0 ome for the Saudis to make some concession too and reciprocate the conciliatory /* conciliatory spirit we ourselves had shown. There was really now veiy little between us; but, as Shaikh Yusuf would realise from what I had said earlier in the discussion we really could make no further concession. sir Header wamly endorsed this appeal and the conversation concluded with a renewed promise from the Shaikh to refer the whole matter to the King without delay.

I am sending a translation of that note to the foreign Office immediately and I am sure that it will be considered by His Majesty* s Government, like all the communications from His Majesty, with close and sympathetic att ention.

I am now able to inform you that Safaq has been located accurately. It has been found by careful observations that it is twelve miles due south of Has Asqhsila.

I take the opportunity to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 23rd, in which you explain the reference which His Majesty the King made to Araik. From this letter, and from the letter to which you referred in our conversation on the 24th March, via. the letter written by Shaikh Fuad 3ey Hamza to sir Axxsx Andrew Ryan on Afr il 3rd 1935, I have come to the conclusion that the picture which the Saudi authorities have in their mind of the nature of the physical features in those parts is quite different from the one which we have formed as *he result of our inquiries and of the observations made by Mr. Renddl and other British officials His Excellency on / ohaikh Yusuf* Yas in«0 - 2 - on the spot.

Sir, Ihe secona enclosure to my despatch No. 4b^ datea fc7th MarCh ’ vlz &gt; a translation of a note in which Ibn Sana complains of being 'hemmed in' by his Majesty's Government on tne east, raises questions on which the Political Resident in tne Persian Gulf is muc^l better informed than I am.

I nave written separately about tne Qatar frontier, in my despatch No. 47 of March 17th. Some time ago Fuad oey said tnat some British hand-book ascribed the ownership or the suzerainty of Qatar to Ibn Saud, I said that if one of tne hastily-compiled war-time handbooks made such a statement it could not be binding on Kis Majesty's Govern ment, ana Fuad Bey aid not Press the point. There is no such statement in the handbook of Arabia, 1917, of which, by tne way, Fuaa Bey proudly displays a copy from time to time. Quite recently Mr Philby has made a similar state ment, and he attributes it to one of the handbooks drawn iup The Rignt Honourable Antnony Bden,if arawii up for the British delegation at the Versailles Conference. Mr Philby has doubtless told Ibn Saud, as he tora me, taat there is such a booit in existence, and that tne statement in question shows that His Majesty's Govern ment took no interest in Qatar until they wanted an alternative air route to the one through Persia and until tney tnought that triere might be oil in Qatar. However untrue this might be it would doubtless help to exasperate Ibn Baud's feelings of envy on this point. o. Copy ol this despatch is oeing sent to Bushire.

Your Royal Highness, After Compliments, I have the honour to inform Your Royal Highness that accoraing to recent reports which have reached His Majesty's Government it appears that the Standard Oil Company of California (California Arabian Oil Company) are prospecting in the neighbourhood of Qasr al Salwa. The views of His Majesty's Government with regara to the frontier in the said area have already been communicated to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, and His Majesty's Government are prepared to reopen negotiations for a settlement on the lines they have indicatea. They assume that in the meantime no attempt will be made by the California Arabian Company to pass tne line defined in tne latest proposals of His Majesty's Government to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz so long as no final agreement has been reached as to that line. Since, however, there is some uncertainty as to the precise position of certain of the physical features concerned. His Majesty's Government propose that a joint Anglo- Saudi topographical mission should be appointed to establish on the spot the exact nature and position of those features. To obviate misunderstanding I beg to repeat the relevant proposals of His Majesty's Government as made under the first four headings of the note which Sir Andrew Ryan communicated to His Excellency Faud Bey at Riyadh on His Royal Highness The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mecca.on November 25th 1955 (the reference can be followed on tne map ol which two copies were handed to His Excellency Yusuf Yasin on March 24th.;. (i; A straight line starting from a point on the coast of the Dohat-as-Salwa four miles to the north east of the point on the sea coast closest to Qasr-as- Salwa and running due south-east for ten miles. (The terminal of this line is indicated as key-point A)• ( from (2; A line/key-point A to $ point (key-point B) midway between Kaluwain and Nakhala, to be drawn as straight as possible but so as to leave to Abu Dhabi the following places namely Nakhala, Aqlat al Manasir, Farhud Rimth, Khafus and the route from Doha to Abu Dhabi, which passes west of Sabkhat al Amra, ana to leave to Saudi Araoia the following places namely Haluwain, Bil Deirish and Raghuwan. (3; A straight line from key-point B to the intersection of Meridian 52 degrees East with Parallel 22 degrees North (key-point C). (4) A straight line from key-point C to the intersection of Meridian 55 degrees East and Parallel 22 degrees 50 minutes North (key-point J). Since the above proposals were made by Sir Andrew Ryan in November 1955 there has been a modification in favour of the Saudi Arabian Government in that it has been discovered that Safak (SafaqJ is much farther north than is shown on the map referred to above, and that in consequence key-point C and the proposed boundary in that region are in reality much nearer the coast than they appear to be on the map. This fact was brought to the knowledge of His Excellency Yusuf Yasin-5- / Yasin in a letter No.44(5/430/33 which I wrote to him on March &amp;7th 1337. In conclusion I wish to assure Your Royal Highness of the desire of my Government to arrive at a settlement on this point ana thus to approach still closer to the moment when all questions outstanding between the two Governments will have been cleared up.
