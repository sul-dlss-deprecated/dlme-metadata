It further mentions a report indicating that Sooltan bin Suggur [Sulṭān bin Saqr] has arrested a man called Hassoon for engaging in piratical activity from Sharga [Sharjah].The letter outlines the feuds that the Resident views as the main threat to peace and tranquillity in the Persian Gulf, principally focusing on the feud between Rama bin Jauber [Raḥmah bin Jābir] and the Shaikh of Bahrain; it explains that Sooltan bin Suggur may be the key to resolving these disputes.It notes that there have been no further developments on the prospects of a Persian-led invasion against Bahrain, and that Shaikh Abdool Russool Khan's [Shaikh ‘Abd al-Rasūl Khān] apprehensions over his status as Governor of Bushire are not unfounded. It mentions that Hussain Ali Merza [Ḥusayn ‘Alī Mirzā], Prince at Shiraz, contemplates his removal, and has sent his wife to be received by the authorities at Bushire.The letter is likely to have been dated incorrectly; it should perhaps read 26 December 1823, as indicated by the dates of the surrounding correspondence and the content of the letter.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054362.0x000073#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
