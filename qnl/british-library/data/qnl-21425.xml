AND ON TEE Withdrawal of the British Military Mission IN EAST PERSIA 1910=20 GENERAL STAFF, INDIA ^635 Case No. ^ u r^ operations. DELHI SUPERINTENDENT GOVERNMENT PRINTING. INDIA 1921INo. L.-302, dated Quetta, the 31st December 1920, Xrom—The General Officer Commanding, Baluchistan District, To—The Chief of the General Staff. Subject. —The withdrawal of the troops of the British Military Mission at and beyond Meshed, and of the Lines of Communication. I have the honour to forward a report by Brigadier-General H. A. Lane, on the working of the East Persia Line of Communications, and on the with drawal of the troops of the British Military Mission at and beyond Meshed, and of the Line of Communications. 2. The previous report submitted to you under 4th (Quetta) Division letter No. 024—3-1 (G. S.), dated 8th March 1919, dealt with the working of the Line of Communications up to the 15th January 1919. This report dealt fully with the general plan of organization which had been framed to carry out the orders of His Excellency the Commander-in-Ohief as set forth in Chief of the General Staff’s letter No. 2447-1, dated the 23rd September 1918. 3. The scheme outlined, subsequently modified for a smaller force, was dealt with by Brigadier-General W. E. R. Dickson in a very efficient manner. Preparations to pass the force through to Meshed were ready in due time, though much still remained to be done to bring the Line of Communications up to an adequate standard of efficiency. ♦ 4. During December 1918 the Line of Communications was extended to Askabad, 200 miles beyond Meshed, Brigadier-General W. E. R. Dickson proceeded with the completion of the most urgent requirements which were :— {a) Hutments for hospitals. (b) Sanitary measures. (c) Shelter for troops from the great extremes of climate in East Persia. (d) Road work. (e) Protection and conservation of animal transport. At the same time a system of Intelligence defence, measures for the Line of Communications, and a scheme for the utilization of local resources were elaborated. 5. On Brigadier-General Dickson’s transfer to Tehran in December 1919, Brigadier-General Lesslie carried on the scheme of organization. By this time hutted accommodation for troops and hospitals was practically complete, effec tive sanitation, and an efficient and smoothly working svstem of maintenance established. Brigadier-General Lesslie touk in hand the improvement of camps and watering places for transport animals. 6. The matter of transport on this long Line of Communications was a subject of great difficulty and anxiety. Practically the only form of animal transport suitable and available was the camel. It was impossible to render the road fit for heavy mechanical transport, and no attempt was made to construct more than a fair weather road suitable for light mechanical transport (Eord Vans). With the exception of a Motor Ambulance Convoy, and No. 5 Mecha nical Transport Company, motor transport, however, was not available, due to the needs of the Afghan War, and therefore practically the whole of the trans port work was done by camels. In the northern sectors a few Russian fourgons were used. The number of camels required to carry out the organization of this line was enormous. Camels, though admirably adapted to the country, when work ing under local conditions, are not capable of working on an intensive scale to meet military requirements without special arrangements for feeding and water ing, and rest for grazing. The percentage of wastage up to the end of 1919 199 CGS2 ^ras very great, but during 1920, after adequate arrangements had been com pleted the percentage fell to : — Government Camels . Hired Camels . 18 . 10 The discrepancy between the wastage in Government camels and Hired camels is due to the facts that:— («) All Government camels were employed on connecting convoys, marching to a fixed time table, for troops, ammunition specie, etc., while Hired camels convoys proceeded more or less at their own time and pace. (&amp;) The extreme difficulty is obtaining sufficient and efficient personnel for Government Corps. (c) The indifferent class of remount available due to the enormous drain on camels in India. The locally hired Afghan, Birjandi and Meshedi camels are of a good type, and, of course, fully acclimatized to the sections in which they are w r orked. 7. In April 1920, Brigadier-General H. A. Lane succeeded Brigadier- General Lesslie as Inspector-General of Communications. • By that time orders for the withdrawal from East Persia had been received. *It remained, therefore, for Brigadier-General Lane to put the arrangements on the Line of Communications to the test. 8. The difficulties to be faced in the movement of troops in East Persia are mainly geographical and climatic over 800 miles of roads which pass through vast desert tracts, cross several ranges of mountains, with in many parts a very scanty and impure water supply, and no local supplies of any sort. Each column pf troops has necessarily to be accompanied by a large camel baggage train, for which forage and water have to be pre-arranged at each halt ing place. Each camel consumes in fodder the weight of its own useful load in an average of twenty days, while the march from Meshed to Huzdap occupies on an average 44 days. Each camel requires a minimum of 5 gallons; of water daily, and works, on an average, only 20 days in a month. 9. The climate varies from intense summer heat in the Kainat, to intense' winter cold in Khorassan. In the region between Madeh Karez and Shamadar, the temperature in June, July and August ranges up to 125 degrees in the shade (though no natural shade whatever is available), and this is accompanied by the formidable “ 120 days ” wind. Erost is usual early in November. In Khorassan, and occasionally also in Kain, Birjand and Shusp, the winter temperature falls considerably below zero. . t T ntil posts had been established along the Line, and hutted accommo dation provided at the other halting places, no shelter was available, except in Persian towns in which the sanitary conditions are extremely bad, and infecti ous and contagious deseases rife. 11. The actual movement in withdrawal commenced on the 24th July and was completed on the 22nd November. The plan of withdrawal had to deal with a temperature varying by 100 degrees in the space of four months. It will be recognized that, in these circumstances, without the most careful staff wm'k, based on an accurate forecast of requirements, and the exact fulfilment of ordeis by departmental officers, and by the troops themselves, disaster might easily have overtaken one or more of the columns. physical endurance under very trying climatic conditions.^1 3 13. The difficulties of fhe withdrawal were enhanced by the fact that the route, followed from Meshed to Duzdap lay parallel to the Afghan Border, and in some parts, especially in the southern section, in dangerous proximity to the Afghan Border. A spirit of unrest was prevalent in Western and South-Western Afghanistan at the time, and long convoys, which had in some cases of necessity to move unprotected or inadequately protected, were a tempting bait to the tribesmen on both sides of the Border. The system of Intelligence was brought to a degree of excellence, that enabled timely warning to be given on any large gathering of tribesmen, while the measures adopted of picquetting well known watering places, and of tilling in other water-holes, in conjunction with a very efficient system of patrolling, secured complete immunity both for troops and convoys during the withdrawal. 14. No special report has been submitted on the working of the Line of Communications for the period 15th January 1919 to 23rd April 1920, during which the organization of the Line of Communications, as outlined in the former report was in progress, and 1 therefore wish to mention briefly, the- principle features of this period. The first is the great improvement in the health and comfort of the troops due to the provision of adequate shelter from the weather, hutted hospital accommodation, sanitary surroundings, and a pure- water supply. The prevalence of heat stroke and frost bite, of bowel and chest diseases, and fevers of all descriptions steadily decreased until in 1920 they w r ere practically non-existent. Wastage from sickness decreased to a very small quantity. The establishment of a convalescent depot at Shusp (though this was primarily intended for the force it w as proposed to employ at and beyond Meshed), proved of great service. The next achievement was the development of the local purchase and backloading system, by which not only was great economy effected, but the demand for foodstuffs and forage from India wus reduced at a period wdien such reduction w r as of extreme urgency. Luring this period also the difficulties of obtaining labour, and the provi sion of sufficient camel transport was successfully overcome. Though organized on a far less elaborate and expensive scale than Line of Copimunications in other Theatres of the Great War, I am confident that it would have fully met the requirements of the Poree it was intended to employ beyond Meshed, and that the maintenance of this Force together with the treat ment and evacuation of the sick and wmunded would have been effected over 800 miles of difficult country in a thoroughly efficient manner. 15. I have also to mention the work of the Nnshki Extension Bailway Line of Cemmunications, organized under an Administrative Commandant, w ith two Section Commanders. This extends 500 miles from Quetta to Bailhead at Duzdap. Until recently the open line extended only as far as Nushki, but now has been opened as far as Ualbandin. From Nushki as far as Juzzak the line passes through desert country wdiere the heat in summer is intense, and the cold in winter is severe. The transportation of troops, animals, and supplies has been effected in the most satisfactory manner. I desire particularly to mention the part played by the Bail Line of Communications on the with drawal from East Persia. The work thrown upon the railway officials was of an arduous nature, and has been most successfully accomplished, and I take this opportunity of expressing my acknowdedgment of their assistance, and of the courtesy and help rendered by the management of the Nushki Extension and North-Western Bailways. 16. I shall forward later a list of officers and other ranks whose services the Inspector-General of Communications has specially recommended for recognition and reward, and also those on the Bail Line of Communications whose services merit special recognition. 17. Brigadier-General Lesslie took over command of the East Persia Line of Communications from Brigadier-General Dickson in December 1919.. ’He performed his duties in a most efficient manner till April 1920, when he was transferred to Meshed to take Command of the “ Malmiss Mission ’k He then came directly under Army Headquarters.4 Brigadier-General Lane took over command of the East Persia Line of Coramunications from Brigadier-General Lesshe in April 1920- S° on a ^ er taking over, he was required to draw up plans for the withdrawal from the East Persia. This was a very difficult task for a man who had only just taken over, and would have been a still more difficult one, but for the notes on the same already drawn up by Brigadier-General Dickson. General Lane deserves Greatest credit for the way in which he did his w'ork, and the fact that a with drawal which bristled with administrative difficulties was carried through with out a hitch, clearly proves the excellency of General Lane’s work and that of his staff.

I arriyed at Birjand on the 23rd April 1920, and took over the appoint ment of Inspector-General of Communications, East Persia, from Brigadier- General W. B. Lesslie, C.B., C.M.G., on the forenoon of 27th April 1920. 2. By the 22nd May, I had made a complete tour of the Line (Sistan excepted) including a visit to Bui-Khaf, a Blank Detachment some 48 miles from the borders of Afghanistan. 3. What I found was the work of two previous Inspectors-General of Com munications, Brigadier-General W. E. B. Dickson, C.M.G., C.I.E., and Brigadier-General W. B. Lesslie, C.B., C.M.G., my immediate predecessor. It would he quite out of place to make any comment or criticism on the work of these officers, so I merely record under suitable headings, a brief report of the working and organization of the Line of Communications as it existed in April 1920 (Medical excepted), and I do this as I understand that no official report on the working of the Line of Communications, East Persia, has been rendered since that submitted by General Dickson in Eebruary 1919, and this was more a record of what was being done at the time, and a forecast of what still remained to be accomplished. Mine was the good fortune to reap the benefit of others’ labours, heavy and great too, they must have been. That there were T’s to be crossed and I’s to be dotted goes w ithout saying, but in the general organisation of the line and in the actual administration of the same I made no change. My own particular task is dealt with in Part II, “ The Withdrawal.” 4. I deal with Intelligence in Part I, as the system w T as organised before I arrived and continued without any important alteration till the troops evacuated East Persia. With regard to the heading “ Medical ” the report goes back to August 1919 as the previous report dealing with the Medical History of the Line' of Communications from its inception up to the close of the Afghan operations in August 1919 was submitted in Eebruary 1920, there will now be a complete Medical History of the Line of Communications up to the end of the with drawal, the latter period is dealt with in Part II. Duzdap, Dated 22nd November 1920. H. A. LANE, Brigadier-General, Inspector-General, Line of Communications, East Bersia. II. —Organization. 1.

Distribution of these troops are shown in Appendix I. 3. By April 1920, Railhead had been carried to Duzdap whence extended the Road Line of Communications to Meshed, a distance of about 600 miles. 4. The Line of Communications was divided both for defence and Administrative purposes into seven sections, viz .:— 1st Section Meshed to North of an East and West line, through point immediately South of Hauz marked Aghunj of Degree Sheet. Head quarters, Meshed. t i 2nd Section 3rd Section _ 4th Section . 5th Section . 6th Section . 7th Section . . Sonth of the above line and North of East and West line through point south of Maina.

The authority of Administrative Commandants was inclusive of the Southern point in each Section and exclusive of the Northern point, except in the case of Meshed in the 1st Section and Duzdap in the 7th Section, where except for small Line of Communications enclaves, the administration remained in the hands of the General Officer Commanding, Malmiss Force, and the General Officer Commanding, Quetta, respectively. In addition to the above the Sistan Area formed a separate Command both for Administration and Defence. The Administrating Commandants and Sistan Area Commander, were also responsible for the intelligence system of their respective areas.9 5.

Ordnance work in the sections and Sistan Area vas carried out by the Supply Officer and directed by the Headquarters of the Ordnance Directorate at Lirjand. Ill — Military Situation. Beyond the possibility of a Bolshevik invasion from the North towards Khorasan and raiding by local tribes in the Southern Section of the Line, the situation was a peaceful one. Following the cessation of hostilities with Afghanistan the danger of an Afghan Invasion towards the Main Line of Communications was considerably lessened, but precautionary measures to guard against aggression from the East were never relaxed. Local frontier tribes required careful watching as a cry of Jehad was quite sufficient to start them raiding in small parties even if they never collected in sufficient force to menace our posts of the Line of Communications. The Afghan situation which had remained normal for a considerable time, became somewhat acute towards the end of April when information vas received from India that Afghan Regulars had occupied certain points on the North-West Frontier. This action had instant effect on Western Afghanistan where local tribes were quickly recruited in Chakansur area with an obvious threat to our Communications, This combined with the uncertainty of the situation in Khorasan necessitated a demand for reinforcements from India ; this demand was all the more imperative as I found that the fighting forces of of the Line of Communications had been reduced by a whole Battalion of Infantry and the Kurman Motor Battery since the close of the Afghan War. The reinforcements were never actually despatched from India but a Battalion was earmarked in Quetta and was at my disposal had I actually required it. As a fact I never had occasion to call on this Battalion for, by agreement with the General Officer Commnding at Meshed by which I was able to detain all men of the Meshed Troops returning from leave, I was able to build up a striking force of over 1,000 rifles which was quite sufficient to make the Southern Section of the Line secure against any probable form of attack. IV, - Intelligence. The Question of maintaining an adequate intelligence system during the occupation of this part of Persia (excluding Meshed) was receiving the most careful consideration. Intelligence for which Headquarters was responsible, embracing the collec tion and dissemination of external and internal information required consider able organization. It is perhaps undesirable to set forth in detail the methods adopted in securing information demanded by the needs of this Line of Communications, but I show briefly the organization in force when 1 arrived which, I feel sure, proved of value to those with wdiom co-ordination was maintained and which continued uninterruptedly till the end of the withdrawal. 2. After the passing of the German Agent danger an entirely new system of Intelligence had been introduced. The Line of Communications was divided into Intelligence Areas, the Officer Commanding v usuall y tlie Administrative Commandant) being responsible for the tract allotted to him. ^ Special instructions were issued regarding the undesirability of overlapping and particularly with regard to the proper use of Secret Sei vice Funds. The Intelligence Areas and general organization pf the Intelligence System are shown in Appendix (2) to which reference is invited.14 3. The following are some of the points which were receiving particular attention : — Raiders and robbers who might interfere with the safety of (b) A-ffairs in Afghanistan (West) from Herat to Girishk, including movements of foreigners in this part of Afghanistan, and all military matters across the Border. (c) First hand information regarding Tribal affairs. {d) Anti-British propaganda, External and InternaL (e) Feelings of the local inhabitants, and any anti-British or anti* European feeling. (/) Foreigners resident in East Persia, i.e, Russians, Armenians^ Turks, Belgians, enemy agents. (g) Censorship. {h) Counter-propaganda, V&gt; ith regard to (a) I deal with the subject of raiders and raiding elsewhere but to the speedy transmission of new s of impending raids, may be attributed the success attending operations against these elusive individuals. The undertaking of (b) required careful handling which is shown by the fact that certain spies were caught and reported shot, at any rate agents showed considerable reluctance in accepting service across the Frontier, where special precautions had been adopted to prevent the ingress of British spies. Carrier Pigeons were employed in transmitting important information from the h rentier to the Headquarters concerned. Pigeons were not used across the Frontier but I can speak very favourably of the use of Carrier Pigeons for local work. The information required from (c) w^as more easily acquired, and at no time was there any difficulty in securing accurate information regarding the conditions in Tribal Areas, which I may add demanded constant attention in view of the raiding tendencies of the Tribesmen. j ^ S]X months anti-British progaganda had increased made both internally and externally. Receiving Agents in the various areas forwarded these malicious documents to my Headquarters where full use was oi them by issuing counter-propaganda. (a) I was, at all times, closely in touch with the fpeliWc nf ^ Tlie s J stem of censorship was complete and was entirely satislWn™ convoys. MUN basin i od tnsmission ] ents to Head Intelligence ordination b its on L. of n Transmis diligence to c f C. Head Qi or Road ndary Line, CON16 ID Krans 4,000 (or about Hs. 1,300) which may be regarded as particularly small taking into consideration the number of agents employed, the area controlled, and the successful results attained. 5. In addition to above, Corrections and Additions to “ Military Report on Persia,” Volume I, “ Routes in Persia,” Volume I, and “ Routes in Afghanistan” (South West), were completed and forwarded to the Chief of the General Staff. V.—Survey. 1. Orders for the formation of a Survey Party to carry out the survey in East Persia were issued in September 1918, and work was commenced shortly afterwards The Area which was orginally out-lined comprised about 42,000 square miles. Additional work in the Meshed Area was subsequently undertaken and on my arrival in East Persia this was nearing completion. The work of Pield Survey in the Sistan Area w as then taken in band. The Survey Party in April consisted of one British Officer (Lieutenant G. A. Norman), four Indian Officers and 25 Indian Ranks. 3. Field Survey.—Sistan Area. The programme in this Area consisted of 8,000 miles square of country in Sheet No. 29-D. ; 520 square miles in Sheet No. 29-A. N. E., and 775 square miles Sheet No. 30-E. S. W. This work was duly completed early in June and the party under Lieutenant G. A. Norman returned to India in July. T. General. , In addition to the Triangulation and Topography carried through by the detachment during the period under report, additional work such as the Reproduction of Maps, Intelligence Diagrams, Convoy Charts, and Route Maps were reproduced. The detachment also served in the Reconnaissance Surveys of the Meshed Force, in the neighbourhood of Bajgiran, Kuchan and Meshed. The Areas in which the Survey Party operated were mostly situated in the most exposed part of the Afghan Frontier, beside being waterless and un inhabited. The Survey Party has been of the utmost value to the General Staff both on the Line of Communications and the Meshed Force and it is a matter of regret that the valuable maps which are now being published as a result of the work of the Survey Party have come too late to be of use to the Troops in East Persia. VI.— Raids. 1. Prior to my arrival raiding in the Southern Sections of the Line, i.e., Safadawa, Hurmuk and Duzdap, had been common and the measures then in force were insufficient to dealwuth the situaiion which had become decidedly troublesome. The chief difficulty to contend with was the number of Convoys plying North and South, and the inadequacy of Regular Troops to provide escorts for all Convoys. The Sistan Levy Corps was being utilised advantageously in patrolling Areas frequented by raiding bands and this Corps was carrying out excellent work in effecting the recovery of raided animals and goods. 2. Raiders. Raiders invariably came from the neighbourhood of Rudbar and the Helmund region, generally slipping through the chain of Levy Out-Posts and past the night patrols, always manoeuvring at night in twos and threes to a pre-arranged rendezvous hidden away in the Hills near the Main Line of Communications, from which point they emerged and raided at favourable opportunities. It w r as impossible to patrol all the Hills which afforded ex cellent cover for raiders and it was difficult to detect raiders from ordinary wayfarers. In some cases they actually accompanied maundage contracted, unescorted convoys, undetected, which they subsequently looted. Raiders17 chose the favourable hour of Sunset when committing raids, which allowed escape across the Frontier before dawn the following day thus evading caotuie bv Levies in pursuit. Stolen camels were often abandoned when captore ap^earld inevitable, while the raiders implicated made good them own escape over the Border where they could not be followed. Reports were promptly received regarding organised raiding parties and reception prepared for the intruders, but with the limited number of Troops obviously other measures were necessary to deal with the situation. 3. Raiding. Raiders from South-West Afghanistan, composed chiefly of local Tribes men expert riflemen, were at this period able to raid as tar a held as the Hurmuk-Mukhi-Surkh-Eurmuk-Duzdap road. Taking into consideration the scarcity of water in this Area, the carrying off of large numbers of camels pursued by Moveable Columns, must be regarded as an achievement. Raiding was less common on the Sistan-Lutak-Hurmuk Road, owing to the rapidity 0 with which information could be communicated to Out-Bosts. All Out-Rosts were in Telephonic communication and Very Lights were also used with success. On the Baring-Bandan route raiding was more frequent owing to the fact that raiders could find w r ater anywhere in the vicinity of the Hamun. Escape from this Area was also comparatively easy, as retreat could be made across the Afghan Border in a northerly direction. 4. Measures adopted. On examination of the circumstances, it was apparent to me that without watering facilities raiding of any large extent w T ould be impossible, and I therefore, ordered that all well-known watering places frequented by raiders during their incursions to the Bine of Communications, should be picqueted and other watering holes filled in. This was quite feasible, although involving a lot of labour. Patrolling was continued as heretofore, and unescorted maundage Convoys were ordered to proceed by the protected routes, otherwise compensation for loss of camels under the terms of the contract would be inadmissible. These measures insured the complete immunity from raids on the outer ring of the Main Line of Communications and incidentally secured effective protection for the Line of Communications itself. Attention was also given to the possibility of raids from the West from the direction of Lehani-Baghi, and Uarageh. Out-Posts and Patrols were here also established, forming a complete Cordon encircling the raiding Area which succeeded in stopping raiding and the capture of many suspects. Appendix No. (1) shows the schedule of raids which occurred from 17th jNovember 1919 to 19th August 1920.

(J) Supplies .—The normal method of obtaining and distributing supplies is descjibed in Appendix (1) by means of a graph and explanatory notes. In April 1910, however, the conditions had varied from the normal, for the supply of cereals from Sistan, owing to previous heavy drains upon it, had since the beginning of 1910, ceased for the time being, so that the rela tively barren Area of the Kainat was dependent entirely on India and on Khorasan. On the olher hand the supplies from Khorasan had exceeded expectation and compensated for the suspension of contributions fiorn Sistan. The drain upon India had not therefore became any greater. * The period from March to July of the year before had been an anxious one, owing to the then increasing scarcity of forage aid atta in Khorasan. This was due to the very poor harvest of 1918. The harvest of 1919 itself had not been prolific, and therefore, in April 1920, it was still uncertain whether the supply of cereals would m t fail before the middle of July, wdien the new harvest would be available. It vas, therefore, decided at the beginning of the year 1920. to buy up enough of the local produce of Kborasan by the 1st of April to stock all Supply Depots on the Main Line of Communications, that were dependent on l^cal produce with atta, grain and bhoosa sufficient to last till 15th July, by which date produce from the new harvest wmuld be available. Bv the’third w r eek in March this programme had nearly been completed, and this was a very favourable circumstance, in view of the forthcoming withdrawal, for the reserves that had thus been laid in to meet a possible shortage in Khorasan (which never actually occurred) were available subsequently to meet the extra demands of the troops that were to march down the line from Meshed. In the lower part of the line, where the posts were fed almost entirely from India, the reserves did not in April 1920, exceed on the average the eight weeks’ stock that was prescribed. The system of replenishing supplies was still the same had originally been instituted. Those that came from India were delivered from Railhead at each Post in weekly instalments based on w r eekly consumption. They were given a weekly maundage allowance in the Table of Transport allotment. In the case of articles supplied exclusively from India the upward flow was fairly uniform and for the most part varied only with occasional changes in the feeding strengths. It w as much harder to maintain a uniform flow in the case of articles that were purchased either wholly or partly in Persia, since it was seldom possible in dealings with Persian traders to count upon deliveries of fixed quantities at fixed intervals. For instance, with Shusp and Birjand partially ^ dependent on Sistan for forage, a sudden cession of deliveries from Sistan might result in a sudden demand for extra transport to bring forage from Railhead to Shusp. Or again, if the supply from Sistan remained constant, and meanwhile some hitherto reluctant Persian trader in Turbat suddenly released the stocks which he had hitherto been withholding, there would be a greater influx of forage into Birjand from the North and this w'ould at once decrease the demand for supplies from Railhead, and for transport to carry them. On the lower half of the line from Du/dap to Shusp, and sometimes as far as Birjand, the upward flow largely preponderated. In the upper half the reverse was the case and a far greater weight of supplies was habitually back- loaded than was uploaded, since, as shown in the graph in Appendix 1 there was usually a large flow from Meshed to Birjand of the bulkier articles namely atta. grain and fodder. The downward flow was, however, intermittent depending on the seasons and on the caprice of the traders, but since the transport in the North was mainly local and not imported, it w r as comparatively easy to improvise extra transport when required and reduce it when the requirement became less. It was the function of Major A. E. Byrch, Deputy Assistant Director, Supply and Transport (Purchases), to purchase supplies at Meshed and regulate the purchases made by Supply Officers at Turbat, Jumin and Khaf, and so arrange for the downward flow of supplies from21 Meshed to Birjand, in accordance with purchasing and backloading pro grammes which were periodically given him by the Assistant Dnector, Supply and Transport, to carry out. In determining the amount of supplies that it would be economical to where it was required was more often the determining factor. The prices in East Persia were sometimes much higher than Indian prices, but the difference w'as as nothing to the heavy transportation charges that had to be incurred on the Southern half of the main Eine of Communications where the transport itself had to be fed entirely with supplies e^-lndia. On the other hand the maundage or hired transport that plied from Sistan to Shusp or from Khorasan to Birjand maintained itself, and thus the only addi tion to the cost of forage when conveyed by it to a distant post was the maundage rate, or the cost of hiring camels at so much per day. M he.*i however the forage had to he carried on animals to w T hom rations were issued (whether free or on payment at stock book rate), the cost of delivering those rations to the posts wher^ they were required by the transport had to be added to the cost of the net quantity deliveied. In order, for instance, to deliver one ton of forage weekly at Birjand from Duzdap on such transport, it was necessary to deliver four tons in addition every week at Shusp, for the camels that delivered the net load of one ton from Shusp to Birjand, and to lay in still more at Safedawa for those wmrking thence to Shusp, and more again at Hurmuk for those working from Hurmuk to Safedawa. These additions ta the maundage actually charged were all part of the real cost of any forage that had to be delivered at Birjand from Railhead, and therefore, it was actually cheaper to pay a relatively high price for an article in Khorasan or Sistan, since the transport and incidental charges from those places to destination were relatively small. As a matter of fact the price of cereals in Sistan compared for the most part favourably with Indian prices. (2) Animal Transport. —Camel convoys in March 1920, were still organised on the system that had been in force for more than a year. Each section of the line had its own quota of transport, which as a rule worked only in that section, though from time to time it was necessary to take camels from one section to another to meet some particular change in the general military situation, or in the arrangements for procuring supplies. The convoys v'ere either ‘-Connecting” or “Subsidiary”. The Connecting Convoys worked to a fixed time-table and connected with the connecting convoys of the adjacent Sections. The progress of a consignment despatched by a connecting convoy w'ould, therefore, be timed ahead wdth accuracy from Meshed to Duzdap or Duzdap to Meshed, or between any tuo posts en route. Parties of troops despatched up and down the Line normally moved by “ Connecting Convoy ”. Sufficient camels were maintained for Connecting Convoy duty to allow of ten days rest a month, while with one or two exceptions no camels marched more than seven days consecutively and in the large majority of cases not more than five days and in some only four davs. The Connecting Convoys from Hurmuk to Meshed were partly furnished by organised Military Camel Corps, but were supplemented from Hurmuk to Jumrn by Sunder Dass camels on special terms of hire, and from Jumin to lurbat by hind Turbati Camels, and from Turbat to Meshed by hired Meshedi camels. The connecting convoys between Hurmuk and Duzdap were entirely supplud try hired ca.nels, sometimes by those of Sunder Dass and sometimes by the so-called Political Camels ’ that is to say, camels whose owners had been induced m the Autumn of 1918 by the Political Agent, Ohagai, to take up carnage contracts on the Line of Communications. S‘'f e . the departure of several Camel Corps for India in the summer Cnnr,»lvi n ad been , to . intr oduce the hired element into the each of the Mo nV&lt; ^ S a - ldat r? 6 t '' ma ,0 exten d the range over which rtat-from Dmln e r a l? m8 ° rpS , For ’ ^pt in the short »ta = ( trom Dutdap to Huimuk, tt was desirable still to have a number ofcamels and camelmen of organised cc/ps with each Conned mg Convoy. The 72nd Hired Camel Corps, therefore, worked from Hurmuk to Birjand with their Headquarters at Shusp. This was the part of the Line with which the camelmen of Sunder Dass was most familiar, and there was less difliculty here than elsewhere in inducing 1, the requisite number to accept the conditions of marching with Connecting Convoys. Hence one troop of Military camels per convoy was found sufficient, and this enabled the 72nd Hired Camel Corps, to wmrk a total length of 250 miles. The 54th Silladar Camel Corps, worked Irom Birjand to Jumin, a distance of abont 150 miles, with their Headquarters at Kain, and the 60th Grantee Camel Corps worked from Jumin to Meshed (about 170 miles) w r ith their Headquarters at Turbat. By April 19^0, the Turbati and the Meshed camelmen who had originally been even more averse so regular marching than Sunder Dass camelmen had been, had became quite contented. In March the 72nd Hired Camel Corps w r as in a fairly good condition and had a good percentage of camels effective, but both the 60th Grantee Camel Corps and the 54th Siiladar Camel Corps were still suffering from the effects of the winter, which had been exceptionally severe in the northern part of the line. Apart from the direct effects of the extreme cold, the winter had coincided both in Khorasan and the Kainat with a great outbreak of mange.. There w T as hardly a privately owned camel plying between Meshed and Birjand that was not mangy, and the outbreak had extended in a severe though not so complete a form to the 54th and the 60th. It was decided to work the slight cases in segregation, as well as the jhooling cases, of which there was a considerable number, but the percentage of sick animals ineffective from severe mange, and from debility induced by mange, and by cold, was a high one. The extreme cold was also the cause of a temporary increase in the death rate. I here had also been a considerable number of casualties from Influenza among the personnel of the 54th including their Commandant, who Hied after a few days illness. The outlook in March 1919 was not bright for either of these corps, and it was surprising how they eventually rallied under treatment, when the w eather became warmer. The Subsidiary Convoys existed for the carriage of bulky articles such as forage and were not used with troops marching nor for articles of special value or of great military importance. They had no escorts and were not kept to a strict time-table. On the other hand, to ensure their delivering loads in a reasonable time it was usual to prescrible a period within w hich a Subsidiary Convoy had to return to its base after departing for the farthest point in its section. The convoys could as a rule march by what route they pleased, though, when paid by mileage, the distance was calculated on some recognised route. It was only between Safedawa and Hurmuk that a precise route had actually to be ordered, in order to avoid the raids that sometimes took place in that area. The period allow ed for each such cycle of movement w as a liberal one, and gave ample opportunity for grazing en route and for slight deviations to take advantage of good grazing grounds, where one or two days halt might be made. The scale of rations issued to Sunder Dass maundage camels on payment could thus be supplemented by grazing to a considerable extent for a great pait of the year. On the other hand the camels of the Camel Corps were allowed the same fodder ration whether they got grazing or not. When on the march they got 12 lbs. a day and at most posts on the line the stocks latterly made it possible to give them twenty pounds whenever halted. There was however a short period during the recent summer of 1920, when the grazing near one or two posts was so plentiful that the camel corps camels halted there would not eat the full bhoosa ration in addition to their grazing and the Officer Commanding the Unit had to short-draw^ in order that the uneaten bhoosa might not be wasted. Indian gram was fed to Government Camels as far North as Birjand. Khorasan gram, which was very costly, and of which only a limited quantity was obtainable, was fed when available to camels as far North as Kain. When not available parched barley and parched wheat were substituted. (Among 199 CGS23 i,r&gt;o+ io n vprv favourite feed for camels).

They were selected not from the very long haired breed which is unsuited to warm climates, hut from another breed hat grows a short curlv coat in winter and sheds most ol it in summer. There a lars no reason that these animals should not do well hereafter m India. They are however, expensive and usually cost not less than eighty tomans or about Es. 2 60 each As their purchase was somewhat of an experiment it was decided to fix the luaximum age of purchase at the relatively high limit nf 1 9 YPfU’S. (S') Mechanical Transport.— from the Motor Ambulance Units, the Mechanical Tiansport in East Persia consisted of No. 5, Motor Transport Company and a few fctaff Cars. The Staff Cars for the purpose of administration were attached to the Section of No. 5, Motor Transport Company which had it Headquarters at Birjand, and were used mainly by the Inspector-General of Communications, Staff Officers and Head of Services when on tour, and by Officers who visited East Persia from India on Inspection duty. ^ Eor other Officers who had to tour, and vffiose tours could not coincide with regular Mechanical Transport Convoys, Ford Vans had to be specially detailed. In most Sections it Mas necessary for the Administrative Commandant and the Section Engineer to be thus equipped, M r hile two vans had always to be placed at the disposal of Officers of the Sistan Levy Corps. This diminished consider ably the number available for regular Mechanical Transport Convoys. The convoy referred to took the form of Motor Mails, carrying Mails, and also any passengers who had for one reason or another to be expedited to their destination. There Mas constant traffic of this kind betM T een Meshed and Huzdap and betMeen Duzdap and Meshed. During the winter and the spring a very large number of British Officers and British Other Hanks had to be sent by Mechanical Transport to railhead for demobilization and their reliefs had also to be expedited by Mechanical Transport to the Posts Mhere their services Mere required. Snow and rain in the m inter often made motoring extremely difficult, and the wear and tear of the Pord Vans was naturally very great, is evertheless a through mail although the m inter had run Meekly between Meshed and Birjand and tM r ice a M eek at least, and for part of the time thrice a Meek, between Birjand and Duzdap, the Mhole of the vehicles and personnel being furnished by No. 5, Motor Transport Company. As a rul? about im o- thirds of the vehicles were in commission at one time, and the rest M 7 ere undergoing repairs. The long line of six hundred miles which one Mechanical Transport Company had to cover by regular convoys had made it necessary to divide the supervising and workshop establishment of the Company into three parts. The Headquarters remained at Hurmuk M’ith the Officer Commanding and the Workshop Officer, for the number of Vans working between Duzdap and Shusp still formed the major portion of the total establishment, and Hurmuk was the most convenient centre from M’hich these vehicles could be M-orked. A detachment with a small M’orkshop and with one Officer (or with two Officers m hen available) was based on Shusp and plied over the hundred miles betM r een Shusp and Birjand. A similar detachment—also with one or two Officers- was based on Birjand, and with a small convoy, restricted to six vans and cue ii’eakcloMn van, plied weekly over the three hundred miles between BirjandAPPENDIX I25 APPENDIX L Notes explaining Graphic on opposite page.

(3) The parallel lines drawn along the routes from post to post represent the flow of supplies from post to post and like the reservoirs, referred to in note (2), are coloured or shaded according to the particular categories of supplies carried, while the space between the lines represents the relative maundage. Arrows represent the direction of the flow. (4) It will be seen that there are two main currents of supply, one starting from railhead and the other from Meshed. That from railhead carries articles of all kinds as far as Birjand, but in dwindling quantities, since it drops supplies en-route at each post. Erom Birjand to Meshed it carries nothing except those supplies that are only obtainable in India. Bn-route it feeds both Sistan and Rui-Khaf with such supplies by means of a small distributary to each place. It is shown as being itself reinforced at Shusp by a large tributary from Sistan which brings atta, grain and fodder, and the main current is thus still able, after feeding the Shusp Garrison, to deliver a large quantity of atta, grain and fodder at Birjand as well as some other articles. The other main current starts from the Meshed reservoir, and carries all articles except those which are only obtainable from India. it passes through a reservior at Turbat and through another, though smaller one, at Jumin. These reservoirs, though they supply no petrol, are nearly sufficient to supply the local garrisons with the other articles, so that the current reaches Kain with a volume that is still considerable. At Kain, though it finds no reservoir, it is met by a tributary from Rui-Khaf where there is a reservoir consisting mainly of atta, grain and fodder. Reinforced by this tributary the main current delivers a considerable quantity of atta, grain and fodder at Birjand as well as a few of the other articles. (5) It will be noted that except for petrol and for articles obtainable only from India, Birjand is shown as fed from the residue of both currents. Though this has normally been the case, there have been times when the current from the north failed and Birjand became entirely dependent on India and Sistan. (The recent period when the Sistan tributary failed, but was compensated for by an increase in the current from the north, is referred to in the^body of the report.) (6) The graph shows that the line from Jumin to railhead is for military purposes a desert Line of Communication. What was produced in the neigh bourhood of Kain, Birjand and Shusp left as a rule little or no margin for troops. There have, however, been occasions when a certain amount of atta and forage has been purchasable in these areas. However, for political reasons, it was deemed advisable even then to limit purchases in the Kainat very strictly in order to prevent the discontent that would have arisen there from a serious rise in the prices of staple articles. 199 CGS26 BUCKSS39M and Meshed. Without more establishment and plant than was allotted to No. 5 Motor Transport Company it was impossible to form a fourth workshop, though another at Meshed would have been a great advantage and the necessary extra plant and establishment for the purpose had been applied for just before the withdrawal was decided upon. As it was, the single break down van, carrying an Indian fitter, a spare back-axle, a few tools and a few miscellaneous spare parts had to be relied on for carrying out necessary repairs to six vehicles during their fornights trip from Birjand to Meshed and back. When a van broke down and needed more repairs than could be done on the road, before it could proceed on its own power, it was stripped of such detachable parts as were likely to be stolen by Persians and left to be towed by camels. The time table allowed for a full days halt at Turbat as well as at Meshed, and the breakdown van was often employed during one of these baits in going back to retrieve a van that needed repairs, which, though capable of execution on the road side, yet needed more time than could be spared while the convoy w as actually running. An additional breakdown van w as kept at Birjand, and this went out to retrieve vans that were left stranded between Birjand and Kain. To allow 7 for such breakdowns as well as for the steep gradients between Birjand and Kain and between Turbat and Meshed, the maximum load at the starting point on this part of the Line was reduced to tw r o maunds. The load of a broken down van be distributed among other vans without undue strains on springs. On some of the more difficult passes road mending coolies were held in readiness on convoy days, to help the vans up steepest gradients. The steepest gradient was about I in 'l. Cases of the vans finally left derelict on the road w r ere very rare. VIII.— Medical. »* (1) Instruction. A report on the Medical History of Line of Communications, East Persia, which w r as submitted in February 1920, carried the history of the Line of Communications up to the close of the Afghan Operations on 8th August 1919. The present report continue the history from that date. (2) Medical Administration. Colonel H. Boulton, I.M.S., remained as Assistant Director, Medical Services, with Major M. A.

Half No. 20 Sanitary Section which had previously been under Senior Medical Officer, Troops, Meshed, was plac3d under the administration of the Assistant Director, Medical Services, Line of Communications, from 28th of February 1920. (1) Ambulance Transport. The Hupmohile Ambulance Section which bad been sanctioned in 1919, and afterwards diverted to Rawalpindi during the Afghan Campaign eventually arrived in Last Persia on the 17th Lehruary 1920. Several of the Ambulances broke down on the journey from Duzdap to Hurmuk and required extensive overhaul before they could proceed turther. This Section started from Birjand on its first trip to Meshed on 19th of March 1920, but only reached Ghibk (18 miles from Birjand) and was obliged to return to Birjand as it was found that the bodies were too heavy to allow the ambulances to climb the Ghibk Pass. Sanction was applied for to make the bodies of the ambulances lighter which was granted. One ambulance body on being removed was found to weigh 24 cwt., i.e., nearly a ton and a quarter. Owing to scarcity of labour the work proceeded very slowly but in the case of those ambulances in which it was carried out, the efficiency of the ambulances was greatly improved and they were able to accomplish the journey to Meshed and back without much difficulty. No spares were sent wdth this section and considerable delay occurred in getting them from India which great lessened its utility. * B ’ Section No. 45 Motor Ambulance Corps (Ford Ambulances) w'as sent from Quetta to assist in the evacuation of sick during the withdrawal. It arrived at Duzdap on 5th of July 1920 and proceeded to Shusp wffiere its Head quarters were established, the ambulance worked between Birjand and Duzdap. In October 1919, 55 Carts Desert Ambulance ” were sent to Duzdap for work in East Peisia. They w ere apparently intended for mule traction but two of them were comerted for camel traction. Though suitable for transport of sick in sandy deserts they w ere quite unsuited for the boulder strewn country which prevails in East Persia. Tw o of them were tried on the road from Duzdap to Hurmuk hut the camels were unable to drag them up the hills and the whole consignment w T as returned to Quetta. A number of Turkish pattern Kajawahs were received for trial in October 1919. These, though much more comfortable for patients than the old pattern Kajaw r ahs, were found to he too fragile to stand the knocking about to which they must necessarily be subjected on service. A report on them w’as submitted to Deputy Director, Medical Services) Quetta Division, in December 1919 in which the following defects were pointed out : The special camels saddles sent with the Kajawahs were far too28 East geon.

As might be expected on a line 600 miles long with posts at altitudes xarying from 2,000 feet at Hurmuk to 5,000 feet at Shusp the variations of temperature are very wide, ranging during the year 1920 from 2° Fahrenheit at Birjand in February to about i20° at Hurmuk in July. A cold snap occurred during the first week in February, the maximum temperature recorded at Birjand on 4th of February being only 14° (F) and falling to 2° (F) on the morning of 5th February. The minimum tempera tures on 3rd, 4th, 6th and 6th February being 7°, 5°, 2° and 6° respectively. The heaviest fall of rain known for many years occurred on 21st of February and caused great damage to buildings and roads. The highest temperature recorded at Birjand was 104° on 16th of July. the h of ture at Birjand for the months December 1919 to September 1920. Month. Minimum.

With the exception of the outbreak of epidemic jaundice at Meshed during August and September 1919 and the epidemic of influenza from December 1919 to March 1920, the general health has been remarkably good considering the trying climate, violent dust storms and great variations of temperature. The total number of admissions during the'period 9th August 1919 to the 13th November 1920 was : — 465 British, 7,412 Indians (of whom 1 British and 11 Indians were wounded) equivalent to an admission rate of 761 per 1,000 for British and 539 per 1,000 for Indians. Deaths numbered 2 British Officers both from Influenza, 1 Prisoner of War from Typhus and 300 Indians. The numbers evacuated to India were 95 British and 1,040 Indians. A tabular statement showing admissions, discharge to duty, died and evacuated is attached as Appendix (1). A graph showing weekly admissions is attached as Appendix (2). The principal diseases which call for special note are Epidemic jaundice, influenza, relapsing fever, tick fever, typhus fever, enteric group, colitis* venereal diseases, frost-bite, malaria and appendicitis. 199 CGS29 / a ) Epidemic Jaundice-hroke out amongst tbe troops composing Malmiss Force at Meshed in July 1919, and continued in epidemic form throughout lu '^fc and September. Sporadic cases continued to occur throughout the rear The outbreak originated in the 19th Punjabis in which unit cases had occurred during the previous year in Trsnscaspia. The iroops were living in tents in hired gardens, the tents in most cases being pitched much too close together and being also overcrowded. Major Haiold, R.A.M.C (Deputy Assistant Director, Medical Services (Sanitary), proceeded to Meshed at the i _ c T __i j i,,-a arhrioA thp fents Avere opened out and more tents end of July and on his advice the tents fn rplipvft t.hp overcrowdin Cases of jaundice also occurred at all the posts on the Line of Communi cations during September, October and November 1919, but the disease never assumed epidemic proportions as it did in Meshed, It would appear that the casual organism, whatever it may be, is ubiquitous all over East Persia as infection can hardly have been conveyed from Meshed to Sistan, which is 70 miles from the direct Line of Communications. The incidence of the disease at the various posts is shown in the Table attached as Appendix (3). (b) Influenza.—A severe outbreak of influenza occurred during December 1919, January, February and March 1920, and lasted intermittently during April, May and June 1920. The first cases occurred amongst the men of the Camel Corps at Hurmuk at the end of November 1919, and two British Officers were also attacked at the same time, the disease having been contracted at Duzdap. The disease next occurred in No. 5 Motor Transport Company and was conveyed by Mechanical Transport Convoys to Safedawa and Shusp, where, in spite of all precautions, it spread rapidly. A few isolated cases occurred at Birjand and Kain but the disease did not assume edidemic pro portions at these places until tbe latter part of January at Kain and February at Birjand, the infection having been brought from the North, Turbat and Meshed became infected towards the end of December. The disease did not reach Sistan till the middle of March. The total number of cases for tbe whole Line of Communications (includ ing those received from Malmiss Force) was 1,834) with 214) deaths, giving a case mortality of 11'7 per cent. 4:5 of the cases occurred amongst British Troops with 2 deaths.

Whole Line of Communications 14-8 9-4 14-4 (c) lielapsing iW.—There were altogether 41 admissions for this dise^ of which 2 were British Other Banks, 2 Prisoners of War, 31 Indians anTs31 Levies Of (he 2 British Banks one was a Sergeant of 48 Camel Corps Field Ambulance who contracted the disease while on the march, down from Meshed to Bailhcad and the other was a Lurasian Military M orks Overseer who had been living in a Persian village. Of the 31 Indians, 18 were admitted at IVlesled and 8 at Kain, the remaining 5 cases being distributed between Birjand, Turbat and Skusp. The above numbers compare very favourably with the 69 admissiois which occurred in the period 14th October 1918 to 8th August 1919 and show r ed the advantage of the troops being housed in hutted encampment instead of living in dirty Persian Villages. (d) Tick fever. A severe outbreak of Tick Fever occurred in November 1919 in a company of 107th Pioneers working on the road near Sharifabad, between Turbat and Meshed. The men composing the Company were Mahrattas and being down country Indians, complained of the severe cold. In consequence of this the Office^ Commanding, Company took over a Persian Sarai and billeted the men in it instead of keeping them out of the village in tents. Out of the total strength of 175, 72 men contracted the disease, and pains in back and limbs. The majority had enlarged spleens and well marked bronchitic symptoms with frothy sputum, the latter in some cases being blood stained. Specimens of both Argas Persieus and Ornithodorus Lahorensis were fhund in the bedding of a sick attendant who subsequently developed the disease. The oulbreak was thoroughly investigated by Major C. H. H. Harold, B.A M.S., Deputy Assistant Director, Medical Services (Sanitary), and the result of his enquiries and the differentiation\)f this disease from the ordinary louse borne Kelapsing Fever of India have been sent for publication in the lloyal Army Medical Corps Journal. The diseases yielded to injections of Neo Salvarsan, but in some cases as many as three or four doses of 6 gm each were necessary to effect a cure, the spirillum of Tick Fever being much more resistant to the drug than the spir illum of .Relapsing Fever. (e) Typhus Fever.—Two Prisoners of War were admitted for this disease at Meshed in March 1920 of whom one died. One case occurred at Turhat in November 1919 in a Sepoy of 22nd Punjabis, the disease having probably been contracted in Turbat City. lour cases occurred in 8arw r anceof 60th Grantee Camel Corps of w T hom two died, and one case in a Sepoy of 107th Pioneers at Turbat in March 1920. In tnese cases the disease was probably contracted while on convoy duty between Meshed and lurbat, there being no cases as far as is known in Turbat City at that time - In this connection it has been advocated that all Followers, especial Sarwans should he provided with two suits of Khaki clothing.

P T 0 &gt; theiefore is that some of them d(g) Enteric Group .—There were only 6 ad missions for this Group of disease amongst British Troops, with no deaths, and 30 admissions amongst Indians, with 3 deaths. Of the 6 British eases, 2 were admitted at Kain, 2 at Birjand, and 1 each at Shusp and Hurmuk. Of the 30 Indian cases, 9 occurred at Meshed, 6 at Birjand, 4 at Kain, 3 each at Turbat and Shusp, 2 each at Jumin and Sistan, and one at Safedawa. Most of the cases were clinically Para &lt;c A ” but owing to the want of a properly equipped laboratory, the diagnosis could not be verified. Inoculation with TAB vaccine was carried out at regular intervals. -vr {h) Colitis .—With the exception of Influenza, this disease was responsible for more admissions than any other, the total being—22 British and 502 Indians. There were 3 deaths amongst Indians and none amongst British. The largest numbers were, at Hurmuk 132, Safedawa 114 and Sistan 63 where dust storms are most prevalent. Seventy-one cases were admitted at Birjand but many of these were admitted from convoys passing up or down the line. Meshed accounted for 41 admissions, Kain 39, Shusp 38, Turbat 19 and Jumin 7. W Venereal .—The total number of admissions for Venereal amongst British Troops was 24 and amogst Indians 283. Of the British admissions 10 cases or nearly 50 per cent, of the total and of Indians 112 cases or 40 per cent, of the total, were admitted at Meshed. A large proportion of the latter came from Kuchan. The next highest number of admissions was at Birjand, where 5 British and 38 Indians were admitted. Of the 26 admissions at Hurmuk, nearly all were amongst men returnino 1 from leave in India. All Venereal cases were transferred to the General Hospital at Shusp or Meshed for treatment and men were warned that no one suffering from Venereal would be evacuated to India. (/) Frost Bite .—Warned by the experience of the winter of 1918 when a large number of cases of Prost Bite occurred amongst convoys between Turbat and Meshed, arrangements were made for the supply of Veseline to all convoys marching North of Shusp after last December and printed instruc tions were given to each Convoy Commander detailing the precautions to be taken for the prevention of Prost Bite. It spite of this however, 37 cases of Prost Bite were admitted at Meshed, 6 at Turbat, and 6 at Birjand. In addition to the above which all occurred in Indians, 3 Prisoners of War who came from Kuchan in March were admitted at Meshed. The Indian cases nearly all occurred during the cold snap which took place in the first week of Pebruary. Only one case was admitted in January at Meshed {k) Malaria .—Except at Hurmuk where 17 British and 135 Indians were admitted for Malaria during August—November 1919 there were very few admissions for fresh infections. Amophel^s Larvae were found in a small stream which issue from a spring at the back of Mechanical Transport lines at Hurmuk. The channel of this stream has been cemented and there has been a considerable reduction in the admissions for Malaria this year, the total for August to October bein^ only 22. {1) Appendicitis .—The relatively large number of cases of Appendicitis which have occurred on the Line of Communications calls for remark, there having been 7 cases amongst British, of whom 6 were Officers, and 15 cases amongst Indians. No special cause can be assigned for this unless it be due to the excessive amount of dust ingested owing to frequent dust storms.2T7 38 IX.— Ordnance. In Aprl 1920 there existed nine Ordnance Depots on the Line, situated at Hurmuk, Sistan, Safedawa, Shusp, Eirjand, Kain, Jurain, Turbat and Meshed, that at Meshed being by far the largest as it supplied the \tants of the'u hole of the Meshed ^ Force. In addition, there was a large Ordnance Depot at Duzdap administered by the Quetta Division. Each Depot was in charge of a non-commissioned ofl[5oer with or without an assistant, who worked under the orders of the Supply and Transport officer of the Section who in turn was responsible to the Deputy Assistant Director of Ordnance Services at Line of Communications Headquarters in all matters pertaining purely to Ordnance duties. Practically all of the non-commissioned officers were temporary sergeants of the Supply and Transport Corps who were not in any w ay conversant w ith Ordnance Stores and duties. T his can hardly be called an ideal organization, hut owing to the shortage of trained Ordnance personnel in India it was persumably the best that could be devised. 2. The system adopted for keeping up the reserves and stocks at the various Depots was as follows :— Six monthly estimates of requirements of Clothing and General Stores were called for from each Depot and after supervision in the Ordnance Direc torate Office a consolidated estimate giving the detailed requirements at every post was forwarded to the Ordnance Depot at Duzdap who included same in their demand on Quetta when making provision. It was found necessary to work on a six monthly rather than a three monthly basis owing to the great length of time required to get stores through the upper post on the Line, and to the delays which often occurred in obtaining stores from Quetta Arsenal. The average time taken to forward Stores, after arrival at Duzdap, to Meshed was from 10 to 12 weeks which necessitated larger stocks being maintained than would otherw ise have been the case. All other requirements and liabilities outside these estimates were reported by the officers in charge of the Depots direct to the Ordnance Directorate Office so that stores could be moved from Post to Post as circumstances required. In the case of Meshed, the British Senior Officer of the Force forwarded this Office a weekly list of his outstanding requirements so that these could he expedited from India and from Post to Post. In those instances where intima tion wns received either from the Ordnance Depot at Duzdap or Quetta Arsenal that certain Stores were not available, these were then procured by Local Purchase through the Ordnance Directorate Office, or in the case of Meshed, Turbat and Birjand wffiere local bazars exist, they were purchased by the Supply and Transport Officer concerned. Only very small quantities of Stores were procured by means of local purchase as it was seldom that either Quetta Arsenal or the Railhead Depot failed to produce the Stores required and the sums thus expended w r ere accordingly very small. X.— Works. 1. The establishment of the Works Directorate consisted of an Assistant Director of Works and Six Section Engineers with six Assistant Engineers. Headquarters was situated at Birjand with other Headquarter Offices of the Line of Communications. The Six Sections had their Headquarters, 1st Section at Meshed, 2nd Section at Turbat, 3rd Section at Kain, 4th Section at Birjand, 5th Section at Shusp, 6th Section at Hurmuk, with a subsidiary Section at Sistan. The strength of each Section was nominally a Section Engineer, an Assistant Section Engineer with one clerk for accounts and correspondence, a Store keeper and a varying strength of subordinates according to the personnel available and work in hand. There was an establishment of 27 Overseers and Sub-Overseers approved but this was never up to strength. Sufficient Officers to provide Assistant Engineers in all sections were never available. 199 CGS39 Ti e sections corresponded with the Administrative Sections of the I ne except in the seventh Duzdap where for building purposes, it was under Ouetta until the withdrawal commenced. There was no Engineer under \\ orb Directorate posted to Seventh Section and Engineer, Hurinuk, was responsible for the road as far as Duzdap* The Section Engineer was directly responsible to the Administrative Commandant of his Section. The Section Engineers w T ere responsible to Assistant Director of At orks for technical details as to construction, execution of works, the cost and accounts for same. The Section Engineer at Meshed, with his Assistant Engineer, were also responsible for work for Malmiss Eorce. The Assistant Engineer was detailed to act as Eield Engineer and the Eorce could claim his services for work without reference to the Assistant Director of Works. The Malmiss Force could also claim the services of the Section Engineer for works outside Meshed on reference to Headquarters with the proviso that if very urgent necessity arose the Section Engineer could be taken and notification of the fact be sent later. 2.— Stores. The stores ayailahle locally were of a very poor quality, of limited quantity and extremely expensive; at Meshed and Turbat there was a fair quantity of timber available, but unseasoned and soft. South of Turbat as far as Dirjand timber is scarce hut obtainable. South of Birjand timber does not exist except in small quantities in Sistan. Burnt bricks w T ere bad mainly owing to lack of materials to burn them, as clay is in many places good. Good gatch was obtainable for internal plastering work but the local cement (so called) and lime is very poor but is used north of Hurmuk owing to excessive cost of supplying from India. There was a certain quantity of small stores of Russian origin at Meshed such as glass, hinges of sorts and iron but price was high and quality poor. The stock is now almost exhausted as source of supply is closed. Stores were therefore indented for from India and stored in Engineer Park at Duzdap, unfortunately there Tvas also difficulty iu obtaining in India, such items as cement, glass and hinges, which did not begin to come in any quantity till late spring of 1920. The system for issue was for Section Engineers to send indents to Assistant Director of Works who authorised Engineer Park to issue. Section Engineers were not allowed to indent direct on Park. Section Engineers were also required to send in three-monthly and six- monthly forecasts of requirements so as to ensure that they foresaw require ment. 3.— Accounts. Each Section Engineer ^ kept a cash account in which he entered all receipts and payments; duplicates of these Cash Accounts were sent at the close of each month to the Assistant Director of Works Office where they were checked and amounts entered under their various allocations in Register of Works. Accounts were then passed to the Audit Officer for Audit. lie Section Engineer obtained his money from the Bank from the Field Treasure Chest Officer, Meshed, or in cash from the Field Treasure Chest Officer or Administrative Commandant of his Section, a monthly forecast of probable cash requirements being sent to the Financial Adviser by the Assist- ant Director of Works three months in advance. The Section Engineer asked the Assistant Director of Works for the cash he required for the current 8 eX n P i en A lt n r l and the A f istant Director of Works authorised the Field tn iln. -f c heSt ? fficer n Admmistr ative Commandant, as the case may be, accounts couldTe checked ^ reqUi ‘' e(L In Way side ° f4.— Contracts. For the purpose of making contracts the area under consideration must be divided into two parts. 1.—Buildings. A.—*Meshed and Turbat. In this area there were Persians with large capital who had a certain amount of experience of both building and road w ork but no idea of contracts. They were shy of coming forward, so at first at Meshed the w ? ork fell into the hands of Armenians. The Persians worked under these Armenians and so got used to the principles of contract w r ork and finally tendered them selves. However, ideas on the subject of working to a time limit and penalties for failure to comply with conditions of contract or for bad work were beyond their comprehension and led to endless argument. There appears to be no Commercial Laws in Persia under which any agreements can be enforced. A simple form of contract was used giving particulars of wmrk, estimated cost, time limit and fine for non-completion. The contractors were eager to do good w ork as a wdiole for the credit of Persia, and in one case wdiere a contractor failed another big man came forward and took over unconditionally the whole contract (including the liabilities of the contractor who failed), and finished the work. There were very fev cases of really bad woik and when such did occur the most effective penalty w as to black-list the contractor. B.—South of Turbat. There were no Persians with capital to take building contracts and the Indians, either resident or w ho had come w ith the Line of Communications to Persia, w T ere unwilling to take building contracts and so most of the work was done by daily labour. Towards the end of 1919, however, a few build ings, notably at Birjand, w r ere put up under lump-sum contract and one or tw r o under percentage current account contract with a time limit. Both these methods were found to be cheaper and quicker than daily labour as the class of subordinate supplied was unable to get the Persian labouier to work very hard. Finally a few contracts were obtained on a rate basis and the position would have become normal in 1920, if building operations had continued. The difficulty in getting the Indians to tender was, I think, largely due to the fact that the work being done was, in quantity, far beyond the capacity of the locally domiciled labour to get done in the time and so labour had to be imported. This meant offering higher wages to men living hundreds of miles away to induce them to leave their homes. Directly they arrived on the scene in the local labour put up prices to bring their wages level, and consequently the contractors could not tell what he wmuld have to pay and so he waited until work slackened off before starting to tender. 2.— Bo ads. In this again the country can be divided into three, i.e., Meshed and Turbat, Turbat to Shusp where there are patches of cultivation, and south of Shusp which is desert. A.—Meshed and Turbat. As in the case of buildings so also for roads the Armenians started taking contracts but here the Persians followed sooner than in the case of buildings. Tenders were called for to make a road to a certain specification, two rates being paid, one for work on plains and one for hills, the Section Engineer to be the judge of which was wdiicli, and the Assistant Director of Works the final court of appeal. The work was done satisfactorily. B.—South of Turbat to Shusp. In thi« stretch deserts occur and there w r ere no influential Persians with capital. Owing to lack of subordinate staff daily labour cculd not be resorted41 , 1 ± 1 , -no! or levies could not be employed, contracts had to and where technical l - 0 tract t i iat 00u ld be obtained up till the t0 7m9 1920 was the percentage current account contract. Owi„ ? to St'™- T brS'l“™!!r.ir&gt;3 .'Sk to pwMrfr i' ralm.. ment to avoid difficult places and Anally Persians with small capital were induced to take up small contracts for construction of short engths of roads usually about 500 yards at a rate per yard, on a specimen made by Pioneers wUh Persian labour attached to them. Contracts were also made in tins Section for maintaining hilly portions of the road on the approximate basis of one man a mile and was found to be satisfactory. C.—South of Shuap. There was no local labour and no one would take road contracts. o. — General. Where lengths of road were made by contract it was specified that road should be maintained for three months after completion at contractor s expense and final payment was not made till after the three months. Breaking or Terminating Contracts. On completion of a contract a “No claim ” certificate was embodied in the final payment. Engineers always reserved the right of terminating con tracts without reason being given with a short period of notice, and at any time for bad work. Wdien a contract was broken the work done was measured up, necessary deductions for bad work calculated, and payment made. Ihe contractor, if he was not satisfied with the Engineers ruling could and did apply to Persian authorities and the matter was settled by arbitration through the Consular authorities. Compensation. Compensation, whether for land taken up, for roads or buildings, or for ■water used, was invariably settled by arbitration between Persian Government authorities and Consular authorities. The Persian claims were first submitted for remarks to Line of Communications Headquarters, and then forwarded for final settlement of claims, to the Consular authorities. Water is Tery scarce in Persia and compensation was invariably claimed at any place where the water supply was tapped or where buildings encroached on any land that might possibly be cultivated. In some cases, such as Meshed, rent and water rate were paid and in others, such as Sistan, a lump sum was paid down. In the cases where contracts have been closed through no fault of the contractor, but only owing to orders being issued for the withdrawal, any work that has been done has been measured up and the out-of-pocket expenses of the contractor investigated, such as cost of importation of labour, etc., and a sum of money paid him to cover these with a small margin of profit on his outlay. 6.—Buildings and Roads. All buildings on the Line of Communications, except those at Meshed, and about half ^ those at Turbat, are roofed with the Persian domed roof or Gumbaz. This is due to the scarcity of timber for rafters, etc. Where timber is available the Gumbaz is an uneconomical type of roof owing to excessive thickness of the walls required to take the thrust. It is also impossible to construct this type of roof in the cold or wet weather as the walls do not dry enough to stand the thrust of the roof. On my arrival in April I issued orders t at no new works were to be commenced; a few works that were in hand•were completed, otherwise with the exception of a few minor works, such as additional latrines, incinerators and additions to petrol storage, no new building work was done. Maintenance of buildings. Maintenance of buildings externally was a simple matter merely requiring proper graded roof drainage and renewals of mud plaster. This necessitated the careful w r atching of the buildings during the first rainfall and readjust ment of slopes, etc.; afterwards mud plaster renewals were fairly heavy owing to the rain, when it does come down, being almost in the nature of a cloud burst, washing away a lot of plaster and in many cases carrying away the spouts for throwing water clear of the buildings and then washing deep channels in the walls; all through the w r et season a gang of masons and coolies was kept in each hutted camp to deal with this. Internally, owing to the inferiority of the burnt bricks, and the local line, all pucca floors required constant repair. Indian cement was not obtainable in any quantity till well on in 1920, and what was obtained before then was used on hospital floors such as operat ing rooms and venereal wards and for w r ater supply purposes. Throughout the cold w eather, as pucca bricks were available, the floors of men’s barracks were made of bricks as ordered by the General Officer Commanding, 4th (Quetta) Division, on his tour of inspection in December 1919, but this work was not finished and was closed dow r n on intimation of withdrawal being received. Roads, Orders bad been issued that a road capable of carrying light motor traffic was to be constructed from Duzdap to Meshed, This w r as taken in hand and a clear run was ready by 1st May 1919. This line was hastily chosen and then required to he built up to stand the traffic. It had to be realigned in many places owing to sand, moving sandhills or too steep gradients, and may be said to have been finally ready in May 1920 This does not necessarily mean w’ork was completed, as a road of this type made without rollers or water, requires continual care and improving, but by May the alignment, as far as could be seen, was correct in the main, though the gradient wanted altering in many places. Koad diagram attached with Appendix I. In Persia, owing to shortage of water and intense heat in parts of the line during the summer months, the best time for road construction is the winter. Hence, in the spring of 1920, a good deal of new construction had been done, mainly owung to the necessary realignments. The most important of these was the new alignment to avoid the moving sandhills immediately to the north of Jumin and the sandy plain north of this again. This bit was 20J miles long and was embanked, rough soled, and gravelled. It was nearing completion when orders for withdrawal came but was finished off as it was nearly ready. Work was started by Pioneers, mixed wuth Persian labour, and finished off by small contracts when the local inhabitants grasped what was required. Work was also started North of Surkh Eud Bridge with a view to carrying on the realignment to Maina but this w^as not very far advanced and was stopped when orders for withdrawal were received. The other works on the main road were realignments on the passes between Turbat and Meshed to reduce the gradients to a minimum of 1 in 10. Those in hand were finished off but the project as a whole was not com- pleted owing to the withdrawal. Of the main road the following works were carried out. The road from Turbat to Pui-Khaf was made passable for an occasional motor car. During the winter the road from Sistan to Hysamia was embanked to prevent flooding and the Sistan-Girdi-Hurmuk Eoad made passable for occasional cars owin' to the Safedawa-Lab-i-Baring-Sistan road being but by the rising of the Hamun.43 Maintenance. The road throughout, owing to there being few bridges and culverts, was liable to considerable damage from rain as well as from wear and tear. The road was in no sense a pucca road, but w^here only motor traffic was encountered damage from wear and tear was small. In the .Northern Sector, however, before the withdrawal there was a considerable amount of heavy fourgon traffic which damaged the road considerably ; this traffic did not come south of Shusp. The damage caused by fourgons w T as due to its very narrow wheel, with an iron tyre, and the very heavy loads carried. The weight caused the wheel to cut into the surface, except in the case of a properly consolidated pucca road; also on the hilly slopes the drag-shoes used cut up the road like a plough. In the Northern Sector the road maintenance in places was given out to contract at a rate per mile per month, with rate varying according to the season of the year. These rates w r ere compiled from the experience and records of previous work; the gangs and material w T hich had been necessary were carefully checked and scrutinized. This principle was adopted in the hill passes and was the most successful. In the plains, on the other hand, when the necessary Military Works Services personnel arrived it was found to be cheaper to keep gangs on section? of about 20 miles each and to increase them temporarily when any severe damage occurred. These gangs spent their time improving the road by rough soling and gravelling as well as repairing damages. South of Shusp rain damage w r as not very great, except after one very severe, storm and it was found best to send out gangs periodically from the Labour Corps reinforced by imported Sistani labour, w hen necessary, and a few Sappers to deal with the various parts of the road as they began to show signs of wear. The same principle was observed in dealing with the two tracks to Sistan. Cost. It is a little difficult to allot the cost of the roads under the two headings construction and maintenance as gangs were improving, i.e., re&lt; constructing, at the same time as maintaining, but approximately cost is as in appendix (I). Employment of Technical Troops and Local Labour. The technical troops on the Line of Communications were the Sistan Detachment, 3rd Sappers and Miners, equivalent to about half a company, the l-107th Pioneers, the l()4th Labour Corps, who returned to India on the 21st June 1920, and the 128th Itailw T 9y Construction Company, who returned early in 1920. Of these the Sistan Detachment, 3rd Sappers and Miners, were stationed at Shusp, and W’ere employed on the building work and maintenance and the water-supply of the place, and provided a certain amount of supervision of Persian coolie road gangs. These were also used in preparing water and camping arrangements for the withdrawal. The 1-1 (7th Pioneers were stationed as follows :— Headquarters and one Company One Company One Company One Company • at Birjand. . at Kain. . at Jumin. . at Turbat. Owing to shortage of troops the Pioneers were used a lot as escort to came convoys, but they also were used to assist in building operations, defence of posts, ana on road work, the principle being that Pioneers were employed on the heavy road work such as rock cutting and blasting and ^ar semi-conglomerate formations, particularly in regrading passes, andPersian gangs were attached to them for the ordinary soft-earth digging and embanking. One platoon was detached from Jumin for w r ork between Kuchan and JBajgiian for 'work on roads and preparing mines. The 194th Labour Corps were stationed as follows : — Headquarters and two Sections ..... at Shusp. One Section ..... at Safedawa. One Section ..... at Hurmuk. These men were used on the building work and also on road construction and maintenance, the major portion of maintenance of roads South of Shusp was performed by them as there was no local labour obtainable. The 128th Eailway Construction Company was stationed half at Safedawa and half at Hurmuk. The half Company at Safedawa cleared and levelled the road from one Safedawa to Labi Baring and then w r orked on brickmaking and building at Safedawa. The half Company at Hurmuk worked on road maintenance, brickmaking, and building at Hurmuk. This unit returned to India before I arrived. In addition to these troops there were masons and carpenters imported from India and posted as required at the various Hutted Camps from Railhead to Birjand. Local labour. Owing to the large amount of work to be done on the Line of Communi cations and the lack of sufficient technical troops the majority of both building and road work had to be done by local labour and also no Indian-trained mason was capable of constructing the type of roof, i,e., the gumbaz used practically everywhere. On the South end of the Line there is no population and all classes of labour had to be recruited and transported to Hurmuk and Safedawa. This labour was obtained from Sistan. Sistan also supplied labour for Shusp; when building was started in Sistan it became impossible to supply sufficient skilled labour for Snusp and masons were brought down from Meshed and Turbat. Owing to scarcity of food, rations had to be supplied to all • imported labour and was one of the conditions laid dovn by the Consular authorities before labour was allowed to go. In the South in addition to the Sistan labour for roads and buildings the Indian Contractors at Hurmuk imported men of all classes from India to help out the Sistan labour. North of Shusp the situation was better as population increases and as one progress further North, until at Meshed itself there is a large population and plenty of men available. It was found that the local Persian labour is not satisfactory as it is quite useless for really hard work. Bock cutting and blasting are beyond the powers of the ordinary Persian though they can dig fairly well in soft soil when well supervised and encouraged. Some turquoise miners from Nishapur were engaged for rock cutting on the Northern passes, but as they are very limited in number the Governor-General requested us to let them go back to the mines. Persian skilled labour is very variable, some of the carpenters and masons being much above the average of Indians but all are very lazy and require constant supervision: all Persian labour required payment either daily or every other day or the men would not remain on the work. Serais. Owing to the inclemency of the weather in winter Serais had either been erected or were in course of construction at all Convoy halting places except in the Hurmuk and Huzdap sections. The whole programme had not been completed by April 1920 wdien, in view of the probability of withdrawal, I stopped any further work on these buildings. Por statement of serais see appendix (II)./ 45 APPENDIX- (I). Cost of Boads. Total cost of roads and tracks from October 1918 till completion of withdrawal is :— Krans 10,160,410, plus R26,719. This splits up into expenditure on main roads from Meshed to Duzdap including to Eobat, Krans 97,43,068, plus E26,719 on tracks, mcludmg both routes to Sistan, track from Eobal to Eui Kha and an amount of Krans 12,600 spent between Meshed and Bajgiran, Krans 4,17,o42. The amount spent on main roads is further divisible into construction and maintenance. Separate headings in expenditure were “O 1 , kept owing to some gangs doing both works and there being insufficient staff to maintain the necessary registers. It may be said that the road was through for traffic on its present line on the 1st May 1920, though after that date there were still gangs completing gaps in soling and gravelling the same, a fact which brings the average maintenance higher than it should be, but it is impossible to allocate exactly t he “ gangs up to the 1st May 1920 ; expenditure was Krans 79,08,006 pl«s B20,419. A further sum of approximate Krans 9,00,000 was spent after the 1st May in settling bills for expenditure incurred prior to that date; this brings the total up to Krans 88,08,006. Of this, original works cost approximately Krans 84,87,310, plus E20,41&amp; maintenance, Krans 3 , 70=696. Expenditure after the 1st May 1920, exclusive of the Krans 9,00,000 debitable to settling bills for work prior to the 1st May totals up to Krans 9,35,062 and R6,300, and must be considered as maintenance, though, as explained above, it is not an accurate figure. Average monthly maintenance per mile approximately is as follows :— (Maintenance can be said to begin from December 1919.) December 1919 maintenance 111*5 Krans per milel J anuary February March April May June July August September October 1920 8-r8 144-2 163*6 116-7 431*7 373*3 354*6 302^3 162*6 45 T 580 milesv 564 miles.. 287 miles. The road may be said to start directly north of Birjand from the 1st October 1920 and south from the 1st November, though, as seen above, maintenance' expenses were kept very low after. To maintain the road m its condition of the 1st September should cost approximately Krans 6,00,000 per annum, exclusive of salary of supervising staff. Supervising staff should be an engineer and three subordinates, each with a car.46 Hanz • f* • Kaffir Kaleh . Khameh • • Secunderabad Maina. . « Robat-Mahi . Amrani Borjuk • • • Khidri • • Naughab .

General Organization and Working. In April 1920 the following postal staff was attached to this force, beside an Assistant Director of Posts and Telegraphs:— Base Postmaster Inspector of Field Post Offices 1 Field Postmasters . . . . * • . • .13 Clerks 32 Followers . . . . . . • .51 Distribution of offices and staff is shown in appendix (1) and (2) respectively. The remotest Field Post Office was Kuchan, No. 422, a distance of 670 miles from the Base Office, Duzdap. In April 1920 there were twelve Field Post Offices, and to serve the Levies a Field Post Office had been opened at Bui Khaf, Mail Arrangements. From Hurmuk to Meshed the letter mails and parcels under 80 tolas were carried by motors, and the transit was twelve days. From Meshed to Kuchan the letter mails were forwarded thrice a week through the Persian Post, and the transit was twenty-six hours. The parcel mails for Kuchan were forwarded from Meshed three times a month by connecting convoys and the transit was seven days. From Duzdap to Birjand all parcels were sent, with letter mails, by motors. Between Birjand and Meshed any parcels that could not be sent by motors were despatched thrice a month by connecting convoys, and the transit was twenty-two days. Very few parcels were sent by connecting convoys as special lEshmctiOns were issued to the Base Office to despatch all small parcels for Meshed with letter mails. t In April 1920 the following services were in force:— Sanction Duzdap to Hurmuk „ Hurrauk to Shusp Sbusp to Birjand . „ Birjand to Meshed Daily motor service. Motor service thrice a week, » ,, twice a week. }) „ once a week.

In April 1920 there were twelve Telegraph Offices and twenty-eight Telephone Stations, the latter were subsequently increased to forty-one. To assist in the prevention of raids it was very essential that Levy posts should always be at call on telephones and, as there was only one wire from Sistan to Birjand, which was shared with Persians, constant attention had to be paid to prevent office faults in Telephone Stations which interfered with Morse working. Traffic. Traffic has been very heavy, averaging at Sistan about 1,500 telegrams daily and at Birjand 500. Long cipher telegrams to and from Malmiss Meshed and Beuter’s full service telegrams had also to be disposed of. To cope wdth the above traffic and, as we had to share the telegraph line with the Persians, Cardew’s Vibrators were superimposed, and this permitted of the line being utilized on vibrator both day and night. A duplex set at Sistan and one at Birjand were also installed, and have been very useful in disposing of traffic. Owing to casualties the signalling staff were frequently called upon to do overtime, and this they very willingly complied with. Maintenance. During December—January 1919-20 maintenance of the telegraph line, a distance of nearly 600 miles, was started at five different points, and completed before the raiil and snow came down. Construction of New Lines. Telegraph line of 70 miles was constructed in January 1920 from Jumin to Turbat. Specification is as follows - Wooden posts 22 ft. long, 17'6 posts to the mile. Wire iron, 300 lbs. to the mile. Brackets, spike, with field service insulators. Accommodation. \ All Telegraph Offices were moved into hutted encampments prior to April 1920, with the exception of Sistan, which was moved on the 1st May 1920, and Safedawa on the 21st May 1920. The Base Telegraph Office at Duzdap is still under canvas.53 XII.— Veterinary. In April 1920 the Veterinary personnel on the Line of Communications consisted of the following :— Maior W. H. Walker, D. S. O. . Deputy Assistant Director, Veterinary Serv- £ J J ices, Line of Communications, also responsible for the supervision of the Malmiss Force ; Captain K. S. Simpson, R. A. V. C. Veterinary Officer, Malmiss Force, and i a charge of Line of Communications details, Meshed ; Nine Veterinary Assistants . . (Four Regular Indian Veterinary Corps, three Indian Civil Department (Temporary), Indian Veterinary Corps, and two Supply and Transport; and One Indian Clerk . . . On loan to the Veterinary Service at Head quarters at Birjand ; the establishment being short of one British Veterinary officer and two Veterinary Assistants. The Veterinary Assistants were distributed as follows :—- One each at f Meshed; Turbat; Kain; Biriand : 1 Ship; Hurmuk ; iSistan ; ^ Duzdap; this arrangement allowing for one being on furlough. The policy has been to place Veterinary Assistants in veterinary charge of all Government animals at stations, and at the same time to act as Veteri nary advisers to Administrative Commandants through whom all reports have been rendered. No definite orders had previously been published defining the duties of Veterinary Assistants, and it therefore seemed advisable to issue such orders [vide appendix (1) ]. The system of treating sick animals in unit sick lines by unit personnel, particularly in large units like Camel Corps, is unsatisfactory, but was unavoid able as no veterinary personnel for Veterinary Hospitals were provided. If A eterinary Hospitals bad been established at the larger stations I am convinced that the number of inefficient animals would have been greatly reduced. General State of Animals on Line of Communications in April 1920. * . condition of horses and mules was on the whole good, the exception being in the case of horses of some of the small units in which the manage ment left much to be desired through inexperience. Mules in the maiority of cases had done very little work, were well fed but rather too fat. The shoeing o horses was indifferent, particularly in small units, due to shortage of sioemg smiths. The majority of shoeing smiths required more training. Mules as a general rule were unshod. With the exception of isolated cases of mange, no cases of specific disease had occurred, and the health of horses and mules was good. Government Camels.

B. Lesshe, C.B., C M G., the officer P I was relieving, letter No. L.-31, of the 1st April 19^0, from ^ rl S a ’ dier-General-in-Charge, Administration, 4th (Quetta) Division, to his address, containing the orders to formulate the scheme referred to m Bv the 9th May 1920 I had drawn up the scheme, which was despatched f/o ptta on the 11th May by the hand of Major D.

The work of the various services in co musfc here ar ^ is gone into in detail under the . services, I have much felt that, with regard to the Supply f aa * or ^ or Trall sport.

The scheme allowed 112 days for the withdrawal, including the liminary notice. No bitch of any kind occurred, and on the 13th vember, i.e.^ on the 11 *th day, I was able to wire to the Baluchistan trict, repeating to the Chief of the General Staff, that the withdrawal was com pleted. Bor this satisfactory result I have to thank my staff and heads of services, who spared no effort to ensure the comfort and welfare of the troops on the march, and who so loyally co-operated with me in carry ing out every detail of the various orders and instructions I issued. Through out the whole of the withdrawal the troops had only tw r o days’ reserve rations in hand, and any breakdown in the arrangements w r ould have resulted in, if not disaster, at least an unfortunate situation, which it would have been extremely difficult to rectify. 8. A very satisfactory feature of the withdrawal is the extremely small number of sick—in all less than 5 per cent, of all ranks—of which the serious or “ lying ” cases were under 2 per cent, of the total strength. 1 attri bute this satisfactory result largely to the sanitary care of the troops on the march, and to the arrangements made at all camps for the protection and distribution of water. 9. In accordance with the instructions I received, all British other ranks s whose presence was not absolutely necessary with columns and final garrisons on the march, were evacuated to railhead by motor transport from Shusp— thus avoiding the extreme heat of the last twelve marches in the southern section of the line. prevention of raiding described in Part l withdrawal, and proved perfectly successful, against any convoy or .column; the strong southern section proved a very effective deterrent, while very great credit is due to the Sistan Levy Corps for their unceasing watch on the Afghan frontier, a distance of close on 400 miles. 11. The spiritual and moral welfare of the troops was the care of the Beveiend Langdale femith Chaplain to the Porces. The Chaplain made constant visits to all stations of the line, including Meshed, and I am glad to say the services he held were w T ell attended. Considerable sums—~the result of collections at these services—were sent to various charities in India. The preseivation of graves, both British and Indian, has received my special attention. Graves of all British ranks have been clearly demarc ated with raised cement slabs, w itk a standing cross at the head let into the ground. The name of the officer or British other rank, with date of death, has been let mto the cement slab. In the case of Indian graves, owing to several severe epidemics, many had been buried in isolated spots with no identification marks. ! have, however, with very few exceptions, been able to identily these Many Mohammadans have been buried in recognized Mohammadans cemeteries. The remaining Indian graves have been enclosed in walled enclosures. Detailed lists of all graces, both British and Indian, have been given to Consular authorities concerned. 12. On the 8th June 1920 a complete 500-Watt C. W. wireless station arrived in East Persia, and was erected at Duzdap. This wireless placed at my disposal during the withdrawal possibility ot communication with interruptions occurred. The B.E., who manner, and credit is due to this non by the Duzdap wireless 10.

The smartness and good discipline of the troops under my command have, I know, made an impression on all classes in Persia and in every respect have these troops upheld the good name and fine traditions of the Endian Army. If, during the latter part of their stay in Persia they have not had the excitement of fighting, they have had the extremely harassing duty of perpetual convoy work in every kind of trying climatic condition—intense heat, intense cofd, and in some eases for on average of over 300 days in a year! Right well have they done their duty. 16. On my arrival I was glad to find that our relations with the Persian officials were most cordial, and I lost no time in cementing a friendship which my predecessors had begun, and which stood us in good stead throughout our sojourn in East Persia. I know of no serious crime committed by the troops under my command against any of the inhabitants of Persia and I am happy to say that very friendly relations have always existed between the two; in fact, I have received ample proofs from all classes that our departure is a matter for regret. I cannot express too deeply my appreciation, of the loyal assistance given me by His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk, Governor of Sistan and Kain, whom I have come to look on as a personal friend, and, further, I feel sure a lasting friendship has been cemented between His Excellency and the Eritish. I also desire to acknowledge the friendly assistance I have received from His Excellency Qawam-us-Sultaneh, Govern or-General of Khorasan, and his Deputy Governor at Turbat, Prince Jalal-us-Sultan. My remarks on our political relations would be incomplete without reference to Lieutenant-Colonel Prideaux, Consul-General at Meshed, Colonel W. G. Gray, the former Consul-General, Mr. Gould, Consul, Sistan, and Mr. T. V. Brenan, Vice-Consul, Birjand, whose advice and help, both before and during the withdrawal, have been of the utmost value to me. . „ . „ 17. I also wish to record my appreciation of the services of the officers and men of the Khorasan and Sistan Levy Corps; while both have h a( l their share in guarding the flank of the Lines of Communication and in the haras sing duty of escorting convoys, it is with the Sistan Levy Corps that I have come more in personal contact, and to them has mainly fallen the tas o dealing with raiders and w'atching some 400 miles of the Afghan frontier, right well have they performed these duties, and the greatest credit is due to their past and present Commandants—Major Lang, M.C., and ^ ajor a journey of some 400 miles to a extension to Meshed would, of course t cannot believe there is sufficient of it concern.

From Zero day tlio Duzdap area was formed as a separate command for de fence and administration, as outlined in Lines of Communication Order No. 2. This organization was in complete working order very shorly after zero- day ' I detached Lieutenant-Colonel V. F. W. Tregear l-98th Infantry for this command and gave_ him sufficient departmental and staff officers Irom my It was originally ruled that the administration of the Duzdap Area Commander was exclusive of railhead, which was to remain under the Admin istrative Commandant, Rail Lines of Communication. This oigamzation denned that the Duzdap Area Commander should hand over all personnel, animals, stores supplies, and mechanical transport to the Administrative Commandant, Lines of Communication, Rail, for entrainment, the responsibility of the Duzdap Area Commander ceasing on handing them over en bloc after arrival in Duzdap. * . -r. -i i The Administrative Commandant, Lines of Communication, Rail, had no sbff and personnel to cope with this excessive amount of work. This proce dure was therefore found impracticable, and would not work. The matter was represented to the General Officer Commanding, dth (Quetta) Division, whereafter all railhead and entraining arrangements were administered by the Duzdap Area Commander. At the end of September 1920 I sent Lieutenant-Colonel V. R. B. ■Williams, D.S.O., my Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster-General, with the main Headquarters office to Duzdap, and instructed him to take over the Duzdap Area Commandership from Lieutenant-Colonel V. E. W. Tregear, in addition to his other duties. It was then that the chief work of the rail evacuation commenced and increased to its maximum from the 26th October 1920 onward. After this date to the end of the withdrawal columns followed each other every second day. All officers in each column on arrival at Hurmuk w ere issued w ith orders (copy “A.” attached) giving the necessary information and instructions for their arrival in Duzdap. This ensured no delay in the rail evacuation. Columns arrived in Duzdap according to programme, and the personnel and animals of each column w r ere ev acuated by rail from Duzdap the day following their arrival without interruption. There w r as a constant flow of large consignments of stores, etc., to railhead which were checked, stored, and repacked at Duzdap and promptly evacuated. The table (marked “ B ” attached) show s the details of all personnel and animals evacuated by rail during the withdraw al. Out of 18,111 animals entrained there was only one casually in the 60th Grantee Camel Corps. Sixty vehicles of all descriptions per diem were allowed for entrainment. There w r as only one loading platform with a capacity of 24 vehicles, but there was never any hitch or delay. No extra expense was incurred in engaging extra labour. Ry the 14th November all personnel of all columns w T ere evacuated by rail. With the exception of 95 mechanical transport vehicles, which were detained at Duzdap pending decision as to their disposal, the entire evacuation was completed by the 22nd November 1920.

For lack of exact data on various points it was impossible, til late in the period of preparation for the withdrawal, to estimate witl accuracy the quantity of supplies tha£ had to be maintained at each pos as a reserve. On a previous occasion, when a withdrawal had beet mooted, it was estimated that, by increasing the reserve of rations af each pos from five to eight weeks for the garrison, enough supplies would be available tor the troops on their way down from Meshed, as well as for the garrison o: the post itself. It was then fully realised that the lower down the line £ particular post was the more garrisons from other posts it would have to feet on their way through, but it was held that this extra provision could be made m 1 . e i on p. r P er i°d that, in their case, was available for making it. The policy of relying on an eight-weeks’ reserve had, however, been adopted to mee the possibility of a sudden hurried withdrawal, in which no attempt would be made to salve surplus stores, and the transport of columns marching down the a a . Ca t e - W0U1 ? have been COm P ar atively small. When, however, il nnp Cldea t0 l )r + wi OW ? a lar ^ e fi uautlt y of stores with the troops it wai at once apparent that the former calculations would not be applicable Foi CommSinn 'If both from id eshed and from the posts on the Lines oi increZ the d *n° W b6 com P aratl '' el J' large, and this would not onl 3 lunnlv nn^l.e n^tef fU 6 , reS0U f eS 0 l the lowei ' Posts, but so tax the water of th/withdra«nl 't 'I' 0 Shusp to Hurmuk that during the process ot the withdrawal it would be undesirable, if not impossible to send convovs oi couM* be placed mm IT t0 ShUS P' 14 thus that no See Hence itw*! 1 P he ?

All these requirements had again to be severally sub-divided under the headings (i) rations e^-India, (ii) rations, if any, obtainable by purchase on the not and (m) rations that could only be replenished by back-loading from costs above (or by sideloading from Sistan or Rui-Khaf). In the case of the two latter headings dates had to be fixed up to which it might be considered safe to rely on replenishment. In the case of rations ^-India there was not the same difficulty in * estimating a date for final replenishment Little had to be done beyond naming one date for the whole line, after which no post was to forward any of these rations. The posts were all approximately seven days’ march apart by connecting convoy (including halts), and there were therefore roughly seven days’ rations for each post and for all posts above it and for the Meshed force always on their way to each post from the post below and, by naming the date after which each post was to hold up its next consignment and send no more forward, each post was provided approximately not only with seven days’ rations for itself, but with the seven days required by it to feed both the garrisons of the posts above it and also the Meshed columns as they passed through. This date was determined by the length of time that,the Meshed reserves would last without replenishment. These were a five weeks’ supply [dus surpluses, of which a considerable quantity had accrued), ihe date alter which replenishments were to be held up was fixed accordingly, but allowed not only for feeding the Meshed columns till they reached lurbat, but also for providing the Malmiss and Consular escorts that were to remain behind with the reserve of *r-India rations that it had been decided to leave with them. Though very nearly meting the case, this holding up on a fixed date ot the current week’s consignment for posts beyond did not quite do so owing part y to the posts being on the average nearer six than seven clays apart (mclu i g halts, and also to the lower posts having to maintain themselves or longer t a those further to the north. Butty distibutmg surpluses to posts where they were required to make up deficiencies the necessaiy a Justme provided without difficulty, aud a certain margin for emergencies was ajso provided^ A further margin was also made available by each post fj e ady mamtai^^^ eight weeks* reserve for its full garrison, whereas it was on y • on haq garrison that would remain in each post when once ie su } ^ 1 “'tuvaTLo decided that every column should reach each post ^ith ^vvo days’ rations in hand, so that on arrival it bioug w i ‘ arose to itself which it would carry to railhead so long as no cm , carried.

(b) Supply situation at the beginning of the withdrawal. v^-rvnc for the withdrawal were being made it was of course •When the P r ®P a ‘ „ would fa i]. Had it fallen very soon, there would not known when , n ruins of atta and forage in the northern half of hare been a consu era ^ to b(J disposed of for what it would fetch. If the line, winch ^ t ]r ree we elis later than was the case, the stocks of these zero da y ba f,d have^een greatly diminished. It actually fell on a date that madeTt necessary in the upper half of the line forage to a slight extent, but not sufficiently to put up p e a e were willing to selfthese articles as required up to the end ot the withdrawal. Thpre had been time to stock the lower posts on the line with the extra Quantities that the withdrawal demanded. The difficulty here was to stop the nffiux at the right moment. The supply from bistan hail been resumed, but could not reach Shusp direct owing to the intervening Hamun Lake now being in Tod, and had therefore to be sent to Safedawa to which access from S.stau was still practicable by a diversion that avoided the flooded aiea. Safedawa, therefore, instead of Shusp, now became the meeting place of the upward flows of supply from railhead and Sistan. (c) Terminating contracts. The charges for compensation for incompleted contracts were comparative!) small. For more than a year a rule had been in force on the Lines of Communi cation that no contract was to he made without a clause allowing Government to terminate it at one month’s notice, though the contractor was not allowed me same privilege. This paved the way for the withdrawal, but without risking a sudden stoppage of supply at any moment beforehand. Bai Shib Jowala ferngi had a contract for the supply of sheep at Shusp, and, though given the due notice of one month, he was yet entitled to deliver S00 more sheep than m view or t e stock then in hand—were required during that month. His agent claime twenty Krans per sheep as compensation for Government’s lailure to take t ese 800 sheep, but on consideration Bai Shib Jowala Singh reduced the claim to one Kran jer sheep. He also had a maundage contract extending from Birjan J umin, and—apart from the one month’s notice —it latterly became impossi e o give him all the loads to carry to which he was entitled. On the °ther ban , on several occasions he had failed to lift the loads given him to lift. W hen _ is and certain other considerable, though disputable, counterclaims were set agams his own claim he agreed to cry quits. The claim of Bai Sahib Sunder J a ^ s 1 °, account of the premature termination of his contiact was dealt with and se in Quetta, where the contract had originally been arranged. It was terminaK at three months’ notice which, in view r of the comparatively long peri cf service for which he had to engage his camelmen, was the least notice he could have been expected to consent to. It is understood, however, ^ when the orders for the withdrawal w r ere issued he made some con l :(?s?l0 ! 19 r regards this notice while, on the other hand, arrangements were made as a ^ possible to release the political camels before the Sunder Bass camels, an release the Sunder Bass camels in the order in which their owners agieem with Sunder Bass terminated. (Tt e contracts with the owners of the P 01 .^ camels had been framed with the usual clause admitting of one mont s ^ ot termination.) In Khorasan the transport contracts were all made ov ^ periods at a time so that no question of compensation arose. A considera e ^ however, had to be spent during the few weeks prior to the withdrawal o Meshed columns in retaining fees for the Khorasani camels for v ' h*h d i were at the moment available, but which would be wanted for t e w ltlia ^ itsell. Such animals were allowed to go out to graze, but had to Q forty-eight hours’ recall. 199 CGS69 (d) Estimating surpluses. It had not been possible while the preliminary arrangements for the withdrawal were being made for final conclusions to be arrived at concerning tbe personnel to be left behind in East Persia and the reserves of rations required for them. It was therefore somewhat late in the day before it was known what provision was to be made for the Sistan Levy Corps, and later still before it was decided that at each post on the main Lines of Communication a reserve of rations for men and animals was to be left in Levy charge for use, as required, by the General Officer Commanding, Malmiss Mission. The decision to leave certain Mechanical Transport details behind for duty in Meshed and Sistan came last of all, and this also involved a slight increase in the post-withdrawal feeding strength. However, the margin allowed in the calculations of the final requirements of each post made it possible to meet these additional demands. It was also possible to leave petrol behind for the eventual withdrawal of the Malmiss Mission in the following approximate quantities. At Turbat 200 gallons, at Jumip 1,000, at Kain 200, at Birjand 300, Shusp 1,500, Safedawn 1,000, and Hurmuk 3,000. Allusion has already been made to the difficulty of determining far ahead what exact quantities of supplies w ould be required for the various columns and final garrisons. This difficulty, from one cause or another, continued to be felt till a comparatively late date, and it was of course impossible to inake any exact estimate of surpluses until “ zero day ” was fixed. It w T as also in no case desirable in the early stages to part with any apparent supluses of either men’s rations or of forage at posts where these were drawn from India, since any check to the withdrawal, if it came while the troops from Meshed were halted at such a post, would involve there being fed from these surpluses until the system of replenishment from railhead could be reorganised. It was on this account deemed a necessary precaution to make each post retain a 20 per cent reserve in addition to all estimated requirements, until the final garrison trom the post next above it had actually started on the march. Then and no i then could this 20 per cent, be regarded as really surplus. (&lt;?) Disposal of surpluses: (1) Surpluses of Services other than the Supply and Transport Corps.— esides disposing of its own surplus supplies and equipment, the Supp!y and ransport Corps w 7 as also concerned to the following ex en wi ® P * , , f other services. It had to arrange transport for the conveyance torailhad of lose that were not sold, and in one important instance, ie ^ mvey ■ irge consignment to Meshed instead of to railhead. os rmrnose ere also handed over to the Supply and Transpor 01 1 3 , ^ ^ istead of being sold independently by the Service concerne • ’deD6ts ase of Ordnance Stores, although orders for disposa weie ^ :om the Ordnance and not from the Supply and Iranspor D rectorat^ t^ xecutive w r ork connected with these devolved upon e.

In this way 7.400 maunds o men s rations i, aannds of medical comforts were brought down to railheach „ . , , (3) Disposal of ala and forage at a valuation ^ msidtrable surpluses Consul for Ltan-lt eventually became a Pf ^ 'f be eft behind f grain and atta and large supluses of bhoosa ^Id ha^ to ne ^ h the lower half of the line. It had rn fact been ’“P—J the P Bur p luse s f these articles from Sistan and railhead m a wa y to make iccruing, and at Shusp it had latterly been possible for onee in way70 some purchases of bhoosa on the spot, the delivery of which could not be refused. Backloading these surpluses was out of the question, and it was equally clear that to dispose of them by sale would result in a serious loss to the State, since there would be no market for them, either in the sparsely populated neighbour- hood of Shusp or in the Safedawa-Hurmuk desert. It was therefore decided to exclude them from the selling as well as from the backloading programme, and, instead, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan was asked whether he would take them over at a valuation. It happened to suit him for political purposes to acquire control over a good stock of staple foods located at post&amp; along the shortest trade route from railhead to the north, and he was glad to take them over. Since the Sistan Levy Corps were able to take charge of them till the time came for utilising them, he was in a better position than private traders for assuming possession, and was able to do so at a valuation that greatly exceeded any price that they were likely at the moment to fetch in the open market. The valuation agreed upon for each post made the transfer to the Consul more economical for Government than backloading would have been. About 10,000 maunds of bhoosa were thus left in Consular charge at Shusp, another 5,000 at Kunik, two marches south of Shusp (where there was an outpost of the Shusp Supply l)ep6t) and about 10,000 maunds at Safedawa. • The quantities of grain and ata taken over by the Consul were much smaller. (4) Sates.—Major A. E. Birch, Deputy Assistant Director, Supply and Trans port, Local Purchases, was deputed to organize and administer the sales under the orders of the Assistant Director. Supply and Transport being already in close touch with the leading traders of Khorasan, he was in a favourable position for negotiating with them over sales as well as purchases, and, since it was highly desirable to have one controlling authority, the supervision of sales of stores onfall other services as well as of supplies was made part of his duty. The Supply officers of all posts were therefore ordered to collect statements from local heads of all services regarding articles for sale and inform the Deputy Assistant Director, Supply and Transport, Local Purchases, accordingly. An advertising propaganda was organized, private bids were invited and articles could be sold forthwith to individual dealers if their offers were favourable, but if not, they were to be put up later to auction. The Persian Customs authorities were to be kept informed through the consulate of all transactions as they were made, and to be given access to all auctions, so that they might levy the prescribed customs duty at the time of sale. The indiscriminate sale of alcohol by public auction was forbidden. Sal bs were accordingly held at Meshed and at all posts down the line. The Ueputy Ass ls tant Director, Supply and Transport, Local Purchases, super intended at every sale except at Kui-Khaf and Sistan where the duty was assigned to the Local Supply officer. J Reliance was not solely placed on auctioning.

Incidentally this fitted in with- the backloading programme. These articles that, owing to distance from railhead it would have been more difficult or expensive to backload, fetched relatively high better prices, while those which being nearer railhead could be back- loaded were thus saved from being sold at a very poor price. The amounts realised by sales were Krans 172, 817, 815 in the Kran account, and Rs. 4,293 in the rupee account. Taking three Krans to the rupee and ten rupees to the Sovereign these sums totalled approximately £58,000. (5) Disposal of unused packing material in Sistan .—At the time of the withdrawal being ordered, a very large number of perfectly new bhoosa bags and new grain bags were stored in Sistan. It had been intended that these should be used in collecting all grain and bhoosa of the Sistan 1920 harvest that was available for sale to the troops, and to export them to Shusp, and so save the expensive uploading of cereals from railhead, the economic disadvan tage of which has already been explained when the withdrawal was ordered, the use for these bags in Sistan promptly ceased. Their disposal was some what a difficult problem, though they would have been invaluable for the purpose for w r hich they were intended, bad the troops remained in East Persia, they were now a drug in the market of Sistan, and at the high rate of transport between Sistan and railhead which prevailed Avhile the troops were still in East Persia, their carriage back to railhead would have been very uneconomi cal. Officers were eventually invited for them, and the best offer was one lakh of Krans for the lot, w T hich worked out to little more than one anna per bag. The Consul, Sistan, was meanwhile asked whether, if it was decided not to sell the bags but to return them to India after withdrawal, he would be able to assist in obtaining transport at favourable rates. It was hoped that by that time, the railway being less blocked by military traffic, there would be a considerable influx of trade goods to railhead and camel transport in comparatively large quantities would be going down from Sistan to railhead to pick up trade goods, and that these camels, which would otherwise be going dowm empty, could be hired at reasonable rates to take these gunny bags with them. The Consul expressed his willingness to assist in this matter, and anticipated that the rate per maund from Sistan to railhead would fall to four or five rupees per maund. This would be less than half the rate that had hitherto usually prevailed. On these data a decision was asked for from India whether to sell the bags for one lakh of Krans or to leave them in charge of the Officer Commanding, Cavalry Detachment, Sistan, to be backloaded to railhead after the withdrawal and as soon as transport at favourable rates could he obtained with aid of the Consular authorities. The reply was in the favour of the latter course. The bags have therefore been left in Sistan for the present. (6) Abandonment .—It was necessary to abandon some of the firewood which had been collected at halting places for the various columns : though laid in for their approximate requirements according to scale, was not all drawn by them. The only other supply that could not be disposed of in one of the ways above referred to and had to be abancioned was 198 maunds of so mew hat doubtful onions that were left over at Safedawa. [fj Supply arrangements at Duzdap. Considerable preparations had to be made at Duzdap for the evacuation of surpluses to India. A.s soon as it was decided to hand over the rahtmad supp y dep6t to the Lines of Communication it became necessary to determine how muc i of the stock in that dep6t was to he treated as surplus, so that this might he hande over direct to the railwav for despatch to India without being takea on c arge of the Lines of Communication. The quantities not thus earmarked for despatch were then taken over by the Supply Officer of the 7th Section, who, under ie new designation of the Base Supply Officer, oj^ened and organized a new ase Supply Dep6t. As soon as the Officer Commanding of the io mer lai ea Supply Dep6t had despatched all his surpluses, he also handed over his “ tally section ” to the Base Supply Officer, who was then m a position to hand over to the railway any consignments that arrived later iiom up e72 line for despatch to India. In the case of Ordnance stores he did not how ever hand over direct to the railway but to the local representative of the Chief Ordnance Officers, Quetta. Ordnance stores, till thus handed over, remained in the Base Supply Officer’s charge, and he had therefore to open a new ordnance sub-division such as had existed all along in the Supply Depots up the line (for, as elsewhere pointed out throughout the occupation of East Persia, there had been insufficient ordnance establishment available for organizing separate ordnance dep6ts on the posts on the Lines of Communication, and the Supply Officer at each post had also had to act as the local Ordnance Officer). A prominent feature of the newly formed Base Supply depot had to be a miscellaneous sub-division for receiving and despatching the surplus stores of all services except the Supply and Ordnance services (which each had their separate sub-divisions). The miscellaneous sub-division had also com prised different sections for the stores of every unit on the line, including the private property of individuals belonging to the unit. It was also deemed advisable to include among these sections a Lost Property ” section for articles which arrived without proper identification marks. (Strict orders had, however, been issued to all units to mark packages clearly and indelibly, with the name of owner’s unit as well as with his own name.) Animal Transport, The task~was as follows : — (а) to provide convoys for such replenishments of supplies and stores as w ere still necessary; (б) to clear Meshed and the posts on the Lines of Communication of surplus stores that it was decided should be returned to ladia, and to accompany the surplus personnel of the various posts to railhead, other than those for whom Mechanical Transport was provided; (c) to send down to Duzdap for despatch to India all e#-India camels that w ere not required for the actual period of withdrawal, and to do so in good time to prevent them either from draining the water supply in the lower part of the line at the time wheq it was wanted for the Meshed columns and final garrisons, or • from causing a block in the entrainment arrangements; (d) to convey the four Meshed columns in succession to railhead, with their remaining stores and baggage; (e) to convey the final garrisons in succession to railhead. The giaph in Appendix I shows the method adopted to carry out these various processes. It will be seen from it that the connecting convoy system was kept on in its entirety as long as possible and that, even after its complete continuity had ceased, it was possible to utilise the transport allotted to final garrisons so as to deliver stores at posts far up the line by special escorted convoys up till a relatively late date. On the other hand the upward flow from Hurmuk .0 Shusp had to cease in good time, so as to leave the watering arrangements intact for the downcoming columns. The connecting convoy system was also used to clear surplus stores and surplus garrisons. it was decided to send down one consignment weighing over 1,100 maunds of surplus hits of he Jieshed force by the connecting convoy which left of The surffi^it 1 U 7 ai T ari ! ved T P UZdap ° n 26th Au S usfc - T ^ e personnel ° eaCh p0S t als ° hRd t0 be ^en transport on one or other of the connecting convoys.

This was done by converting noany of the Sunder Pass maundage or subsidiary camels into connecting convoy camels for the occasion. By th's time service on the connecting convoy terms had become quite popular, and there w 7 as no difficulty in inducing the maundage camel- men to submit to the more exacting conditions of marching strictly to time table under military escort. In this way the connecting convoys from Shusp to Hurmuk were increased first to 750 and latterly to 1,000 camels each, and those from Birjand to Shusp to 600 each. All the camels working on connect ing convoy north of Shusp were required for further work with the Meshed columns and final garrisons that were to march later, but in the Shusp-Hurmuk Section no Sunder Dass connecting convoy camels were allowed to return from Ilurmuk to Shusp after a certain date, and on arrival at Hurmuk from the north were sent on to Duzdap for entrainment. Camels employed on subsidiary convoys anywhere from Birjand southwards w r ere also to reach Hurmuk in time to give the watering places between Shusp and Hurmuk a complete rest of eight days, before the first Meshed column had to use them and on arrival at Duzdap were to be entrained. With this essential object in view it would have been fatal to retain these camels longer merely because at the moment there were not enough loads available for them all to carry. Moreover, according to the contract, their owmers paid far less than cost price for their rations and the saving effected in getting them quickly off the line compensated for the fact that some of them had to march down empty. A certain number, exceeding a thousand, though their owners were given strict orders to report at each post on a fixed date, were never seen again, but are believed to have drifted into Sistan where their owners could obtain lucrative employment for them in carrying trade goods. (This in itself showe w unwise it would have been to entrust them unescorted with ^luable Govern- ment stores.) There are certain lines on the graph showing the latest dates allowed for Sunder Dass subsidiary camels (a) to eave Shusp for B -jand on their last upward trip, (4) to leave Birjand finally for railhead («) to leave Hurmuk for Shusp on their last upward .trip, (d) to k-a '« -l’ ■ ,. d raUhead.

The same .system of exchange could also be applied to the transport of all final garrisons, so as to relieve tired animals. The Turbat and Jumin final garrisons were provided with camels of the 60th Grantee Camel Corps. Kain final garrison and the Rui-Khaf flank guard, that afterwards became the rear guard, used up a large part of the 54th Silladar Camel Corps. Detachments of the 60th, 54th and 72nd, rein forced by some Sunder Dass camels, furnished the transport for the Birjand final garrison. Sliusp final garrison received two troops of the 72nd Hired Camel Corps and a large number of Sunder Dass camels. Safedawa received Sunder Dass camels only and Hurmuk five troops of the 72nd Hired Camel Corps as their first instalment. The camels required to complete the Hurmuk final garrison were found from those that could be dropped at Hurmuk by Meshed columns and other final garrisons. These for the short two days’ march to Duzdap, could dispense with many of the camels that had been detailed for carrying seven days’ men’s rations and five days’ forage. The ISistan final garrison marched with local Sistan camels as far as Hurmuk, where, like the Hurmuk final garrison, it received camels dropped there by other final garrisons. Wherever there was to be a change of transport in the Meshed columns it was considered desirable to detail an additional 10 per cent, to allow for casualties that might occur before the change took place, and the transport allotted to final garrisons was in every case at least 10 per cent, in excess of the calculated net requirements The reserve thus created was also intended to allow for the almost insuperable difficulty in estimating accurately the maundage of the miscellaneous stores that would have to be lifted from the various posts. This reserve proved of great advantage on this account. calculating transport requirements, the net camel load after allowing for five days rations for the camel, was taken at 3^ maunds^ Camel Corps equipment, in the case of organized camel corps, was included in the useful or net load^ and was therefore not an extra tax upon the camel. To meet unforeseen demands a central reserve of 1,100 Sunder Dass camels was established at Birjand. Some of it was eventually used in replacing the camels referred to above that went astray when detailed from Birjand for the Shusp final garrison. The rest, if not already used up, was to be attached to the various columns and final garrisons as they passed through Birjand. Many of these were eventually employed in carrying the treasure that accrued from the sale of surplus stores and that could not be accurately estimated before, and others picked up surplus supplies and miscellaneous stores at the posts lower down the line, whereas as was only to be expected these had been somewhat underestimated. ,, The premature termination of certain transport contracts consequent upon e wi urava, lough strictly a transport matter, has already been referied to in a previous paragraph under the head of “.terminating contracts ”. ^°a mo ^ P ar ^ Ih® transport movements took place according to plam A few special escorted convoys were added to relieve congestioS of X?

Such convoys were arranged so as to meet the Meshed columns halt way between two halting places The reserve of camels—approximately 10 per cent, above estimated actual requirements-that was detained at posts to relieve the Meshedi or Turbati camels which accompanied the Meshed columns on the first part of their march or was detained foi the final garrison of posts, proved unncessarily lar^e for the particular purpose of replacing possible casualties, though ample use was found id it in backloading stores that would otherwise have been sold at a loss. It greatly exceeded the actual percentage of ineffective camels. Tor this percentage went on decreasing instead of increasing. In organised camel corps it fell below 10 per cent, at an early stage of the withdrawal and latterly to 7 per cent. As the Meshed columns and final garrisons reached railhead, the exact timings of their arrival there had to be slightly readjusted with reference to the facilities for entrainment. Meshed D column was a large one, and since, during its approach to Burmuk, there had been a chance cf clearing Duzdapof animals, it was decided that this column should forego its halt at Safeuawa and also do the last two marches into Hurmuk in one day and so arrive at Duzdap in time to get all its camels away before the first of the final garrisons armed. These final garrisons, as the graph will show 7 , were to follow at intervals of two days until the end of the withdrawal, and, since, some of them brought as many camels as some of the Meshed columns had done, it w as particularly desirable that D column should be cleared before they arrived. It w r as for similar reasons decided that the Shusp and Birjand final garrisons should forego their day’s halt at Hurmuk. (These minor modifications of the original marching programme from Hurmuk to railhead are shown by dotted lines on the graph.; Since the water supply held out well, it was unnecessary except at Kundi, two marches south of Safedawa, to deprive the camels of their daily drink. The weather being comparatively cool, this produced no effect on their condi tion. At most places they were able to drink both morning and evening. (The condition of the camels on the arrival at railhead after their long march dow r n the line is dealt with in the final remarks on Supply and Transport matters together w ith other points in camel management). The four-horsed Tourgon which had for a long time been discarded as a form of transport on the Lines of Communication on account both ol its com parative expense and the damage which it at times did to the motor-road, had to be brought again into use to some extent during the withdrawal, but only on the northern part of the line. At a very late hour it became a function of the Lines of Communication to evacuate from Meshed of India a procession of Russian Polish Czecko-Slovak and other Anti-Bolshevik refugees of all ages and both sexes. While the Meshed-Duzdap motor mail still ran, a good many were able to come dow r n by Mechanical Transport. Afterwards it w r as only a Tory few, for whom touring cars and ford vans could be specially arranged, to bring them from Meshed. The remainder had to come down by fourgon as far as Shusp. They had to leave at intervals, so that one batch could be evacuated by any available Mechanical Transport from Shusp before the next batch arrived. It was not practicable to take the fourgon below 7 Shusp in the hot weather owing to the reluctance of the fourgon-owner to send his horses so far into the heat of the south. The rationing of the horses and the provision of quarters and rations for the refugees themselves, and the additional wear and tear of the motor road (at a time w hen it was specially desirable to have it in good order for the evacuation of sick) were all somewhat of a strain upon the Lines of Communication, but it yet proved possible to do all that was required for these refugees. Tourgons, for reasons to be explained later, had also to be used from Meshed to Turbat in evacuating sick. Mechanical Teanspokt. The role of the Mechanical Transport had to be changed. As already stated, No. 5 Mechanical Transport Company had hitherto been mainly engaged ] u providing a motor service for mails and passengers between Duzdap an76 Meshed. But it now became necessary to have the mails carried by hired mules under the Levy Escort, and? to restrict the Mechanical Transport, passenger service to a few final convoys that were arranged as required to meet special cases The vans detailed for Administrative Commandants and local heads of Services and those detailed for Levy Officers, had to remain detached, and a few vehicles had to he earmarked for evacuating surplus British other ranks from Shusp southwards. But all the rest of No. 5 Mechanical Transport Com pany was now detailed to assist the motor ambulances in the evacuation of sick. Till actually required for this purpose, the vans were to be overhauled as far as possible. *With this in view the motor post north of Shusp was replaced bv mules w ith effect from the 23rd July and from Hurmuk to Shusp with*effect from 27th July. All the vans thus detailed were lent with their personnel by the Assistant Director, Supply and Transport, to the Assistant Director, Medical Services, and while remaining under the Assistant Director, Supply and Transport, for the purpose of administration and discipline, were placed at the disposal of the Assistant Director, Medical Services, for duty. The task before the mechanical transport detailed for the evacuation of sick was hound to be an arduous one, and the number of available vans was so limited that it was clear from the start that on this special occasion the proportion of vehicles in reserve must be reduced to a minimum, that would be far below the normal. To counteract this disadvantage, extra mechanics and an additional supply of workshop tools were asked for and granted, and fifteen vans were also promised from India in anticipation of forthcoming condemnations and eventually arrived. Six new touring cars were also sent out to facilitate touring, for during the withdrawal it was nece c sary that Staff Officers and head of services should inspect freely and be as mobile as possible, It was decided that with the additional fitters and additional tools it would be possible to establish a miniature workshop at each po^t. This being so, it was obviously best to abandon the system of long distance convoys, and to make each post the base for a few vehicles, plying only between that post and the next. It w 7 as also possible to provide each of these lots of vehicles with its own breakdown van. After the Mechanical Transport arrangements had been made for the withdrawal, a series of difficulties arose which were hard to combat. As already stated there was to be a lull in Mechanical Transport activities, w r hile the ford vans were being overhauled, to prepare them for the somewhat formidable task which they were to share with the motor ambulances of evacuating the sick from Turbat southwards. It had originally been intended that the sick should be evacuated by Mechanical Transport from Meshed itself, but some curtailment of the programme w 7 as necessary, owing to the prolonged delay in providing renewals from India of covers, tubes and other essential parts. This delay was due partly to shortage of stocks in the Mechanical Transport Store Depot, Chaklala, partly to an extensive railway strike in India and partly to certain truck loads, that had been consigned from Chaklala, getting side-tracked and lost for a considerable time. Another countretemps was the arrival of 15 new vans as replenishments without any of the detachable parts that had been ?rv^^ e( ^ ^ ronl t ^ eni - These had been loaded in a truck that had gone astray. weie a gocd many day-van-miles lost by the temporary disappearance of this truck. i ^ n otioirages at Chaklala had to be made good as far as possible by loca purchase, to which Army Headquarters assented, and it was necessary t dispense vith the services on the Line of Communication of the Deputy Assistan Director of Transport, Mechanical Transport, in order that he might be in Indi; and arrange these purchases. Zero day could not be delayed indefinitely am the evacuation of sick had to begin while many vans were laid up awaitinj tubes and tyres. Before the long-expected influx of tubes and tyres begar it was necessary to strip the tubes and tyres from every van that was i; reserve or m workshops, in order to lend them to others and so keep th mimmum complement of vehicles on the road. Though there' were alway 111 shops, there were, however, very few ever in reserve. I ° Ut ^ P r u 0 ' ramme with this very limited number of vehicle! it was necessary, as has been stated elsewhere, to fix the reserve far below th 199 CGS77 ordinary, percentage, sincG no more Mechanical Transport was available from India. According to the ordinary canons of Mechanical Transport manage ment this curtailment of the reserve of vehicles coupled with the difficulties of the motor road and the long distance from a heacy workshop, might easily have resulted in a disappointing breakdown. The result was, however, entirely different. On August 14th, which was the day that Mechanical Transport was to be in position for the sick evacua tion, the number of Ford Vans in commission including those that only lacked covers or tubes was 80. On October 10th, after nearly two months’ incessant work, the number in commission was 97. After that date owing to the closing of the northern part of the line, many vans employed on sick evacuation were dispensed with. No. 5 - Mechanical Transport Company, which during its tour of duty in East Persia had served with varying credit and varying efficiency responded splendidly, on the occasion of the withdrawal, to the call made upon it for a special effort. Apart from the genuine endeavours made by all ranks to do their best for the sick men whom they had to evacuate, it is noticeable that the system of dividing a Mechanical Transport formation, however small numerically, into sections with a workshop at the base of each section, when the total distance to be covered by the formation is comparatively long, is greatly preferable to having bases at fair intervals and sending convoys on long journeys between the se bases. The former system is of course only possible when the workshop establishment is increased out of proportion to the road establishment, and without the additional establishment of fitters and the additional workshop equipment that were so wisely sanctioned by Army Headquarters for the occasion of the w ithdrawal, the problem of evacuat ing the sick in East Persia by means of mechanical transport might have been much more difficult. When the sick between Turbat and Jumin had all been evacuated, a certain number of vans were set free. More w r ere set free when Jumin had been evacuated, and so on. The vans set free from the evacuation of sick were added to the few that had remained available for general duty, and these w r ere first used in evacuating Headquarters offices and personnel from Birjand. Similar evacuations were subsequently carried out from Shusp and Hurmuk of officers and important stores. The number of available vans increased at each stage, those that became superfluous being detailed for detrainment at Duzdap according to a pre-arranged programme. This programme w r as latterly interfered with by difficulties in taking over the lord Vans in India. Most of them had, therefore, eventually to be parked at Euzdap and left there. It had been decided that after a certain date vans or touring cars that could not be made fit to go under their own power with out extensive repairs should be towed down to railhead by came s, and funeral processions of such vehicles on their way down to railhead could occasiona y be seen on the road. One van that had been sent to Meshed with the last convoy that went there to fetch refugees, was left stranded at Turba. owing to engine trouble that could not be remedied on the spot. A few' vans had to be condemned and broken up on the spot. The best 7 were e for the Mechanical Transport detachment that were to stay m this country for Malmiss and Consulate use. The remainder reached railhead, most of them doing so under their own power. No touring car had to be abandoned. Since, owing to shortage of water, it had been necessary to close up w ar camel traffic from Hurmuk to Shusp, the only ^^l^The van' this part of the line was by mule post or by mechamca P * nyailable attached to the ambulance convoys on their upward ] ur ? , downward for miscellaneous up-loads.

This I attribute not so much to any inherent defects in the vehicles themselves, as to the deplorable inefficiency of the drivers. During April and May, just when the withdrawal from East Persia was about to take place, some sixty Eord drivers were sent from the Mechanical Transport Training School at Dehra-Dun. The majority of tnese men had no idea of driving at all and many of them had had only three days’ training. This meant that many vehicles had to be used to train them—the vehicles suffered badly in the process and much personnel, which should have been otherwise employed, had. to be detailed for training purposes. It was quite imposTbie to spare time for thorough training and many drivers had to be sent on to the road for convoy duty while still only partly tiained which resulted in many aecidents and much further damage to the vehicles of the Company. Special Points tor PiEport or Consideration. Provisions of Supply and Transport Personnel. In pointing out to what extent the Supply and Transport personnel fell short of requirement, it is not intended to make any complaint. It is recognised that the provision of personnel for post-w ar operations has been a very difficult problem, and that East Persia could only get its share of establishments available. The Supply and Transport services on the Lines of Communication were, however, at times very hard hit by the shortage of personnel. The crisis came in the winter of 1919-20 when the demobiliza tion of all demobihzable British ranks became impervative, even though no reliefs were immediately available. The Supply and Animal Transport duties at the base of each section of the line could not be carried out efficiently without two Supply Officers, a Transport Officer of the section (whose duty was to arrange convoys and control hired transport), and a Commandant and an Assistant Commandant for any organised camel corps that might have its headquarter there. The volume of supplies coming into the supply depbt was so great that an Assistant Supply Officer was required to give all or nearly all his time to the responsible vork of superintending the receiving duties, thus leaving the senior officer to superintend the whole dep6t and control the office w T ork and keep in personal touch with the Administrative Commandant. A really experienced and reliable British ether rank, preferably a warrant officer, was also wanted to superintend despatches. Instead, it was more often the case that there was only one Supply Officer on the strength of the Supply Depot and the senior Butish other rank was an acting serjeant. In some cases, for con siderable periods, a single Supply and Transport Officer, more or less new to is vork, and with little or no knowTedge of Hindustani or Indian customs, and assisted in his supply work by equally inexperienced acting serieants had o command the Supply Dep6t, be Transport Officer of the section and also com man ^ a camel corps single-handed.

B. SunderJ Dass had been framed so as to admit of full effect being given to this scheme, should officers become available. Latterly the Mechanical Transport units on the Lines of Gommanication were given their full complement of officers and the effect of this was most marked. Even so, these officers like many of the Supply and Animal Trans port officers, were handicapped by their ignorance of Hindustani. This is specially a handicap when the officer, besides performing administrative duties, has many Indians of combatant status under his command. His lack of power to converse with his men impairs his relations with them, and the practice, that had inevitably to be adopted, of an officer dealing with his men through an i Aerpreting clerk, is a most pernicious one. A certain amoimt of unrest in No. 5 Mechanical Transport Company that occurred at the begin ning of the year was very largely due to the man missing the time-honoured privilege of direct and unimpeded access to his commanding officer. An attenpt was made at this time to import Munshis from India to teach Hindustani to newly joined officers, but no Munshi would volunteer. The experience gained in East Persia leads to the conclusion that while the &amp;r-Army Service Corps officer with wide European experience of Mechanical Transport or Animal Management is a valuable acquisition to the Supply and Transport Corps, he should spend at least three months with an Indian Cavalry Regiment or Infantry Battalion to learn the language and customs of the Indian fighting classes before he is given command of an Animal Transport or Mechanical Transport unit. To replace the demobilized British other rank who had been employed in Supply duties, the only possible course had been to send to Persia a large draft of men from battalions newly arrived in India. There were a few old soldiers among them, but for the most part they were raw youths In f ^ every case they were put through a short course m supply duties at Birjand before being poTted to Supply Depute. The few that were l-rly well educated and had also the right temperament, profited by the grounding that y thus eot and turned out well. Most of them, however, including many who claimed to have been in the highest standard of their far from intelligent and were surprisingly illiterate, though some had the necessary ability, niany were more like school-boys m character than grow up me/ and without a great deal more regimental discipline than they had as P yet had were liable to be demoralized by extra-regimental employ.

Ordnance storekeeping and ordnance accounts being more intricate than the corresponding supply duties, it was the rule to detail the more efficient of the Supply and Transport acting serjeants for ordnance duties, hut even so it was impossible in many cases to provide the right stamp of man. Making Supply Officers officiate as Ordnance Officers in addition to their other duties and supply serjeants do the work of ordnance serjeants was by no means an ideal arrangement, and was due entirely to the shortage of personnel. The difficulties inherent in this system were got over as far as possible by letting the Supply Officer- take his orders on ordnance matters direct from Deputy Assistant Director of Ordnance Stores and his orders on supply matters from the Assistant Director, Supply and Transport, while all supply establishments remained under the Assistant Director, Supply and Transport, for discipline, whether employed in ordnance or supply duties. If an officer or other rank failed in his ordnance duties, the remedy lay in his being reported to the Assistant Director, Supply and Transport, for disciplinary action. This w r as not a good arrangement in theory, but it was the best that could be devised, and in practice it resulted in any slackness over ordnance duties being usually visited with rather more severity than a similar slackness over supply duties would have been. It is hoped, however, that in future expeditions the necessity will not arise of calling upon twq directorates to share the same executive personnel. Supply units. The recent organization of supply establishments into small units resulted in there being 28 small supply units in East Persia. Some of them belonged to the new Supply Dep6t organization, and to “S” Supply Dep6t Company, which was the designation assigned to the group of Supply Dep6t Sections allotted to East Persia. There w T ere also among the 28 units 2 Brigade Supply Sections, I Divisional Troop Supply Section, 3 Bakery Sections, and 3 VV orkshop Sections. These, though not part of the Supply Depot organization were shown in returns as attached to “ S ” Supply Dep6t Company. The k conditions in East Persia made it impracticable to keep the different units apart. Personnel of Brigade Supply Sections had to be employed in Supply Dep6ts, while the personnel of the Supply Dep6t Sections had to be detailed to particular Supply Depots according to requirements, and not as complete units. Among the 28 units w’ere also included the 33rd Divisional Supply and Tiansport Headquarters and the 34th Supply and Transport Head^ quarters. ^ The Assistant Director, Supply and Transport, therefore, besides berng Assistant Director, Supply and Transport, had to be shown in returns tv • • CGr i S ” Supply Depot Company, Officer Commanding, Divisional Supply and Transport Headquarters, and Officer Commanding, 54tb Supp y and Transport Headquarters. Some simplification of the present k upply and Transport organization might, it seems, bo introduced to prevent anomalies of this kind. r Stock-taking. .

If so, the face of an Army Form does not appear the right place for it. Such an important order ought to be contained m a book^ of regulations. It can hardly be said to be properly communicated by being printed on the face of an Army Form. On the other hand, since no rules on the subject are given elsewhere, this note stands out as the only authority regarding stock-taking in the field, and, in default of a better communicated order, appears to take the place of an army regulation. In East Persia every endeavour was made to treat it as such, and supply establishments were reminded in Supply and Transport Orders that the note contained in these Army Forms must be regarded as an order and implicitly obeyed. On the other hand, it has to be admitted that the rule as it stands is unsatisfactory, for it is one that, it is obvious, can seldom be obeyed to the extreme letter and contains no indication of the way in w r hich it is to be interpreted when difficulties of an obvious kind have arisen. It is also vague in meaning. What, for instance, is “ stock-taking ” ? To what degree of certainty and accuracy must stock be taken once in every “ decade ” ? Are bags of grain and stock of firewood to be weighed and deficiencies then and there recorded and adjusted ? or may a stock be taken at marked contents or its contents estimated by weighing a proportion of the units composing it ? May a store-keeper accept in good faith a tally-board that was on a stack or pit or tower when he took over charge, and that perhaps, through the negligence of his predecessor, omits all record of a certain previous issue or receipt and so gives an erroneous statement of the contents however careful his own subsequent records on the tally board may have been. Further* is the signature of the store-keeper on his account, w r hen rendered on Forms 1040 and 1041, a voucher that the note as to stock-taking on the face of the form lias been complied with? And does the countersignature of the Supply Officer on the store-keeper’s account furnish a similar voucher ? All these questions seem to need answering before the store-keeper knowa exactly what his duty is, and before the Supply Officer knows what degree of responsibility he assumes for the correctness of the store-keeper’s account when he countersigns it. It is almost impossible in the stress of Active Service for either the store-keeper or Commanding Officer to take a long view of what may happen at a future date if stocks are not accurately checked at frequent intervals, Other matters are continually pressing. It is also impossible for either of them without detriment to other and more pressing work to spend much time in stock-taking. And yet, if stock is not taken fairly accurately and at frequent intervals, a day of reckoning is bound to come, wdien not only must an effort be made to trace losses to the responsible parties, but when a long latent deficiency suddenly brought to light may bring about a disaster. The remedy seems to lie in realising that periodical stock-taking by^ the store-keeper himself, as a matter of routine, is impracticable in the field, and that this duty should he carried out for him by a specialist who should be employed in verifying stocks and doing nothing else. If in East lersia a Supply Officer with a tally clerk could have been made available for the sole duty of touring incessantly by car all over the Line of Communication to verify stocks and to do nothing else, a great deal of loss would haae been discovered in time to remedy it, before it could affect the supply situation and while it could still bo brought home to the party responsible. As a res ^ ^ a very much larger amount of preventable loss would have been prevented. 1 ns officer’s task would not have been an enviable one. The work would have been monotonous in the extreme, for it would have been in the essence o i , to carry on with the dull task of verification, wherever he was and what ever was happening, and his sudden advent at each Supply epo m arn would perhaps have been as unpopular as it would have been sa u aiy. is obviously quite impracticable for an Assistant Director, fcupp } anc lanspoi , when making a hurried tour from one end of the line to the other to spend sufficient time in verification to produce tangible resu ^s. e is jus - much bound as bis juniors to attend primarily to the pressing neecs o moment.82 The idea of having a special department’svithin a supply service existing for verification of stocks and for that only is not a new one. One branch of the Royal Army Service Corps Department of Administrative Control was similarly employed in France for part of the Great War with most beneficial results. Miscellaneous notes on supplies. Vegetable gardens. Except at Meshed there was no post on the line where a sufficient supply of fresh vegetables could be relied upon. It had therefore been decided that at any post where a sufficient quantity of w r ater could be obtained, w ithout cutting short the water supply for other purposes, a vegetable garden should be established. The primary object being the health of the troops, it had been determined to run these gardens if necessary at a loss, while at the same time expenditure was to be kept down as far as possible. Accounts w r ere kept of each garden. '1 he entries on the expenditure side consisted of rent of land local labour and in some cases charges for water, The receipt side of the account showed the amount of vegetables produced, the prices being taken at the price paid locally for similar articles. Appendix II is a summary of these accounts for the wffiole line for the year September 1st, 1919, to August 31st 1920. The accounts on the above data show a profit of Krs. 1,100, from which however, for the purpose of strict accountancy, there should be deducted some share of the pay of the British supervising establishment. This, however, is a very difficult item to estimate, since the supervising establishment on almost all occasions were available for other duties as well. Even if this item more than counterbalanced the profit show n in the account as it stands, the nett loss would be inappreciable, while the benefit to the troops was undoubted. At Birjand the only land obtainable, wdthin the reach of waiter to irrigate it was near the city, and being already a cultivated garden, the rent for °it w as ex tremely high. The Birjand garden on that account shows a considerable loss, which was how ever made up by profits elsewhere.

Another P difficuUv thaTat ^he it aC t &lt; i UirinS any buted to a certain amount of unrest in No SMechanicafTr contri - was the lack of precise rules as to the relation of British ntW PO t P 0 ' npan y ranks.

S ' subject in Supply and Transport units became apnar^t it w„ a ‘'i 6 foHow the lead of the Sappers and Miners. Orders were therefore issued pre- venting British other ranks exercising any military authority ^ 6 Indian ranks. That is to say, thought ias thefr Lty whf/p^^n ch^ _ ec in , 1&lt; l al S ^ cl1 as lr ? work-shops, to supervise and direct that work they were yet forbidden to exercise military discipline over the Indian ranks whose work they were supervising. If an Indian rank failed to carry out a British other rank s directions on technical matters, it was for the British other rank to report the matter to an officer, hut not for himself to place the Indian rank under arrest for disobedience of orders. When Indian ranks paraded for drffi of any Kmd, they paraded under the senior Indian non-commissioned officer or Indian officer (if any) and not under a British other rank. Similarly—and this was perhaps the most important point of all—if an Indian rank had a request to make or grievance to bring forward, it was through an Indian non commissioned officer and Indian officer (if any) that he represented his case to his British officer. In this way the direct access of Indian ranks to their British Commanding Officer, which is a cardinal principled the discipline of the Indian Army, was preserved. The same principle was applied to Supply formations in which the Indian ranks, though not fighting men, were enrolled followers. Since many Indian ranks of the Supply and Transport Corps a-e now either fighting men or have the same status as the fighting man, and since presumably there will continue to be many Supply and Transport units' com prising both British other ranks and Indian ranks, it seems that the time has come when the Standing Orders of the Supply and Transport Corps should contain as clear directions on the subject of the relation between British other rank and Indian ranks, as are contained in the orders which govern a similarSI . „ f isam-.ers and Miners.

For instance, when a warmaV officer wi placed in sole charge of Supply duties at Safedawa he tls not allowed to place Supply and Transport tollowers under arrest or give summary punishments. He had to refer such cases to the Officer Commanding “ Whether this was or was not the correct ruling, it appears that some authoritative pronouncement on the subject should be made. The rule by which the Superior Indian Establishments of the Supply and Transport Corns, and other services were graded for stauts as Indmn officers, if they drew Rs. 50 a month or over, did not work very satisfactorily. Many Indians, with little education and no social standings and no sense of military or any other sort of discipline, were entertained as Supply and Transport clerks, and since the demand for the clerks of any kind at one time exceeded the supply many of these had to be paid Rs. 50 or over. But classing them m the field as Indian officers was in some cases an insult to the regular Indian od 10 ® 1 - Further, though the strictest orders were in force that British other ranks who had official relations with Indian clerks or Indian Agents should show then all the respect due to Indian officers, it was trying British ranks extremely hard to enforce this rule on occasions when some of these Indian clerks and agents failed conspicuously to live up to the official status which had been grained them. Camel management. The need of a comprehensive yet convenient hand-book on camel manage* mert had long been felt on the Lines of Communication. At the end of 1919 it was decided, as a provisional substitute to such a hand-book, to issue a com prehensive order which should embody all previous orders on the subject ^including those contained in the original Lines of Communication Standing Order dated October 1918) and should also contain any further instructions on the subject which seemed to be required. Every animal transport officer was given a personal as well as an office copy of this order, and to ensure his cons tant attention to it, the first paragraph of it enjoined that he must have his personal copy alw r ays in his possession and be able to produce it at any inspec tion by the Inspector-General of Communications or Assistant Director, Supply and Transport. It w T as, however, never intended to be more then a makeshift, and its suppression by the Quartermaster General’s C{ notes on Camel Manage ment ” was very heartily welcomed. In the first instance only very few copies of these notes were allotted to East Persia, and more were at once asked for. On their arrival they were promptly issued to all animal transport officers with a special order directing their attention to such points as had not been dea with in the Lines of Communication order above mentioned. The value of th ls hand-book arriving as it did just when the three camel corps were to come under the command of officers fresh from Europe, who hitherto had only beea used to equine transport, was very great indeed. By its aid it became possible to give these officers a short course of intensive training in camel managemen that has stood them in good stead throughout the tenure of their comma 11 ^ 8, 199 CGS85 brochure reference be made to^fhffolbwicg points'':— lltl0nS ° f th!s exce,lent (1) In^tb Whea e 7 l0 f d “ a «l^ a te such as prevails in' East Persia ’ (2) The necessity of feeding grain dry instead of damped, when the “P“ e falls s° low that damped grain freezes and together with the bhoosa that is mixed with it is converted into a solid mass that the camel cannot eat. (S) Theadvisabilityin very inclement weather of keeping camels verv close together when feeding or resting, so that they may derive as a much heat as possible from one another’s bodies. (4) The scientific treatment of mange (dealt with in this report under e leading Veterinary ” ) which is desirable as a substitute for the spasmodic dabbing of camels with Taramira oil under corps arrangements-a practice which has proved as ineffective as it is expensive. The desirability of giving camels a rest at some point on route when the march exceeds 15 miles had been fully recognized, but the climatic conditions in East Persia rendered this impracticable. All that could be done was to keen the marches as near to the average of 15 miles as the location of the watering places permitted. In winter, when a march exceeded this average it would have been impossible owing to the shortness of the day to complete it in the hours of the day light, if a half-way rest had been allowed, unless the animals had started before dawn and foregone the interval for ruminating after their morning feed. It was thus far better for them to remain huddled together in the comparative warmth of the camels line with their two jhools on, till the sun rose. In summer, on the other hand, the sun’s rays radiating off the sand in a particularly dry atmosphere made marching by day an impossibility for the men accompanying the convoy, if not for the animals also, and therefore made night marching a necessity. In spite, however, of the greater liability to exhaus tion and to pressure galls that had to be incurred by foregoing these half-way rests, the record of the Meshed columns and final garrisons on their march to railhead shows that camels, even if worked continuously for several weeks on end, without any half-way halt when the march exceeds, the average, and with only one complete day’s halt in every six days, can yet arrive at destination in a fit state. The following table shows the state in which the Headquarters of the 5d)th Silladar Camel Corps (less troops elsewhere employed, but including over 500 camels) arrived at Duzdap, after a march of 360 miles, under the above conditions, during the withdrawal from East Persia.

Column A which at Kain picked up more than 600 Sunder Dass’ camels brought them all into Duzdap except 7, of which one died en-route and 6 were missing. Column D, which packed up over 1,000 at Jumin and did a forced march from Safedaw T a to railhead, lost none en-route by death but arrived with 4 camels missing. (Camel manage ment had latterly been regarded by many of the employees of Sunder Dass as a more important matter than heretofore). It may be urged that Lines of Communication of 800 miles in length are rare in the present day, and that conditions in East Persia are abnormal. How ever what has happened in the past may well happen again. So I put forward these various points for consideration and in the hope that remedies may be found for the various difficulties I have had to face. Complaints, too, have sometimes been made by Supply and Transport Officers, interested in studying their profession, or engaged in Supyly and Transport Instruction, that the official records of expeditions often leave out much information on Supply and Transport matters that might prove useful. It has therefore seemed desir able in this report to furnish somewhat full details both on Supplies and Transport. It is in any case obvious that a Lines of Communication of this length, only equipped with a few light motor vehicles, and for the most part served by camel transport only, and dependent for many things upon its base and for the rest upon occasional cases, must be full of Supply and Trans port problems, the study of which should prove as useful to the student as they were engrossing to those who were employed in working them out on the spot.COLUMNS AND CONVOYS WORKING IN CONNECTION WITH WITHDRAWAL FROM EAST PERSIA. app endix | .YegetalU Garden Account for year September 1919 to Augutt 1920.90 III. —Medical.

Evacuation of sick during withdrawal. Instructions were sent to Senior Medical Officers, Malmiss Force, Meshed, on 9th July to hold a medical inspection of all troops and followers and to send weekly men to hospital immediately. At the same time Officer Commanding, 58th Combined G eneral Hospital, Meshed, was ■ ordered to commence eyacuation of sick by 1 ourgons as far as Birjand at intervals of one week. By this means 98 sick were brought down to Birjand whence evacuation proceeded either by motor ambulance or camel convoys. In addition to the above, 29 men who were reported as being unfit to march, but not sick, were sent dowm by camel convoy. On Zero day there were 14 British other ranks and 194 Indians awaiting evacuation in medical units, or in transit down the line. The transport available consisted of 10 Ford ambulances of the old East Persia Motor Ambulances Corps Section, 15 ambulances of B Section, 45th Motor Ambulance Corps and 9 Hupmobile Ambulances of the East Persia Hup. Ambulance Section. Owing to shortage of spares for Hups, these latter were an uncertain quantity and were therefore kept in reserve at Birjand for use in emergencies. Owing to delays on the railway and consequent late arrival of Ford ^tyres and tubes, the Ford Vans of No. 5 Mechanical Transport Company were not available for evacuation of sick until August 14th. The maintenance of the vans and ambulances was a cause of considerable anxiety during the early weeks of the withdrawal, but owing to the timely arrival of spares and the untiring zeal and energy of all ranks of the Motor Ambulance Corps and No. 5 Mechanical Transport Company, in keeping cars on the road, the evacuation proceeded without any hitch. The distribution of ambulances and Ford vans, and Graph showing the working of these in the different section of the Lines of Communication is shown in Appendix (Y) and (VI). These arrangements worked smoothly and sufficient sick to fill the two ambulance coaches, collected at Duzdap week by week, any excess of sick being despatched by ordinary carriage. It was found unnecessary to ask for the complete ambulance train. The numbers evacuated from Bailhead each week were as under :— — British. India. Remabks.

In view of the great heat likely to be experienced on the March, lance Transport {i.e., camels with kajawahs or riding ponies) will be provided at the scale of 12 per cent, of strength of columns for casualties falling out on the march. Motor ambulances or Eord Vans will be attached to each section of the line. They will be employed in carrying sick from camps to the nex post. It is not known at present how many ambulances or vans will o available for duty in each section, 199 CGS94 The general principle on which these Mechanical Transport vehicles will be worked will be as follows :— The vehicles will be based on the post at the southern end of the section (i. e.) Turbat in the case of First Section, Jumin in Turbat-Jumin Section, Kain in Jumin-Kain Section, Birjand in Kain-Birjand Section and so on. One-third of the total number of vehicles allotted to each section will be kept in reserve to replace casualties in vehicles, the remaining two^ thirds being divided into two convoys “ Y ” and “ Z Say 12 vehicles are allotted to a sec tion, then 4 will be kept in reserve, and each convoy will consist of 4 vehicles^ In the Shusp-Birjand Section there will be 3 convoys. The two convoys in the other sections will run on alternate days and will be despatched from their base so as to reach the different camps on the day before the column is due to arrive there. Suppose a column leaves Meshed on the afternoon of 20th and i^due to arrive at Hauz during the night 20-21st then “ Y ” convoy would leave Turbat and arrive Hauz on 20th, leave Hauz with sick and arrive Turbat on 21st. “ Z ” convoy leaves Turbat and arrives Kafir Kaleh 21st, leaves Kafir Kaleh and arrives Turbat 22nd. “ Y ” convoy leaves Turbat, arrives Asadabad 22nd, leaves Asadabad, arrives Turbat 23rd. “ Z ” convoy leaves Turbat arrives Khami 23rd, leaves Khami arrives Turbat 24th. The evacuation from Turbat to Jumin, Jumin to Kain, etc., etc., will be carried on by the vehicles of the next section when they are not engaged in running to meet the columns. Thus the first lot of sick arriving at Turbat will all have been evacuated to Jumin by the vehicles of Jumin Section before they are wanted to meet the Meshed 4 A ’ Column. Senior Medical Officers of posts will inform the Senior Medical Officer of the post next below (as well as Assistant Director, Medical Services) daily by wire, the number of cases for evacuation. 4. Tentage for sick. Below Birjand tents will be provided for 10 per cent, of sick calculated on the strength of each column. These tents will be doublefly ones to the extent to which these are available. 5. Sanitation. All drinking water will he chlorinated, either with Chlorogen or by means of Field Chlorinating Apparatus. Where practicable all faeces and refuse will be incinerated. At the camps where this cannot be carried out deep trench latrines will be used. The trenches must be at least 4 feet deep and men must be instructed to cover their excreta with earth before leaving the latrine. The trenches must he filled in and the earth well rammed down before the camp is evacuated, the site or the trench being marked with an 4 L ’ in stones. Urine and sullage pits will be dug at all camps. All offal skins, etc., must either be burned or buried deeply, in the latter case being covered with at least 2 feet of earth well rammed down. Horse and mule litter will be burned as far as possible. 6. Evacuation of sick. (а) Immediately on receipt or orders for withdrawal, motor vehicles will be sent to Meshed, and will bring down sick to Turbat, and will continue to run between Turbat and Meshed until Meshed is cleared, when they will proceed to clear from Turbat to Kain; then from’ Kain to Birjand, and so on. (б) While clearing of Meshed is in progress, the sick from all other posts will be evacuated to railhead by Mechanical Transport, This evacuation will commence as soon after Zero day as possible.95 (o) Any further sick which accumulates m Meshed after the initial { &gt; evacuation will accompany the Meshed columns until arrange- ments can be made for their evacuation by Mechanical Transport. (d) Officers Commanding Medical Units and Medical Officers of posts { will inform the Assistant Director, Medical Services, daily by wire the number of sick awaiting evacuation. 7. Disposal of medical equipment and stores. (a) lurniture made locally will he sold at Kuchan Meshed, Turbat ' ’ Jumin, Kain, Birjand and Sistan. As much as possible will be back-loaded to Duzdap from Shusp, Safedawa and Hurmuk. (b) Medical comforts will be sold locally as above, and back-loaded to Duzdap from Shusp, Safedawa and Hurmuk. (c) Bedding and clothing will be sent down with ‘ Surplus Garrisons.’ I'd) Fluid drugs in excess of field equipment at Kuchan, Meshed and ' Turbat will be handed over to Malmiss Mission. At Jumin, Kain, Birjand and Shusp will be handed over to Consulate Dispensary at Birjand. At Sistan will be handed over to Consulate Dispensary at Sistan. From Safedawa and Hurmuk will be back-loaded to Duzdap. All other equipment of field medical units or post hospitals in excess of what is required for treatment of ‘ Remaining garrisons * and for the march of the latter to railhead will be sent down with ‘ Surplus garrisons.’ 5. Deports. —Reports will be sent to Assistant Director, Medical Services, at Bin and till further notice. APPENDIX II. Telegram No. G.-1-—16, dated lith July 1920.

IV. —Ordnance. The preparations for the withdrawal involved a very considerable amount of extra work on the part of all concerned, as not only was it necessary to make repeated issues to equip units for the march, but while this work was in progress the remaining stores in the Hep6ts had to be packed and got ready either for sale to the Persian Army (which sale never materialized), or return to India, or in certain instances for sale locally, and all this work was in addition to ordinary duties in connection with check and despatch of stores from post to post, up or down the line, as the case may be. The mere packing and marking of stores intended for sale to the Persian Army was in itself a big undertaking, and involved a considerable amount of extra clerical work just at time when the personnel at the various Depots were working at great pressure. The delay on the part of certain units (although due notice had been given to all concerned) to submit their demands until after the withdrawal had actually commenced, caused a lot of extra and unnecessary work, as stores already packed and even in transit down the line to Duzdap had to be re-opened to make numerous petty issues, and in some instances further demands had to be submitted on Quetta Arsenal for the items which had only recently been returned to them. A routine order was published on the 31st July 1920 closing all Dep6ts for further issues, but it was found necessary to re-open everyone of them to meet urgent demands from every direction. 2. The ultimate disposal of Ordnance Stores, including those earmarked for the Persian Army, was as follows :— Stores at Meshed were sold, except certain articles of equipment^ which would be of use to an enemy ; these were back-loaded to railhead ; this action was taken in accordance with instructions from the Chief of the General Staff forwarded with Genstaff Division, Quetta, wire No.L.-128 of 30th July. The Consul-General and Malmiss were also consulted as to what stores should be sold. With regard to the stores south of Meshed, I realized that at the last moment there w r ere likely to be few bids for stores which traders would well know must either be destroyed or abandoned ; such stores for which transport was available were back-loaded to railhead by connecting convoys. The balance was sold. Accounts of all sales have been sent to Audit, Quetta, by the Deputy Assistant Director of Supply and Transport, Purchases (Meshed), Major Byrch, who superintended the auctions. 3. Under instructions from India all surplus rifles and ammunition were back-loaded to railhead \ no sooner had they arrived when orders were received to send them all back to Meshed for the use of the Persian Army. I uasonly able to arrange for transport as far as Jumin where the rifles and ammunition were taken oyer and transported to Meshed under arrangements made by the Meshed authorities. 4,. I consider all clothing and equipment, issued by the Ordnance Depart- ment was good and serviceable. I have, however, drawn attention to a few points regarding mule pack saddles under heading “ Veterinary m connec- tion with sore backs. Y.—Works. On receipt of orders to prepare for withdrawal the points Reding atten tion were (1) the stopping of all unnecessary work and sending back to the India of all Indian labour that could be spared, (2) the final consideration of all claims and the obtaining of clearance certificates to ensure that no appeals would come in after the Headquarters! Lines of Communication had gone to India, (3) the water-supply at all marching stages, (4) camping grounds at all marching stages, and (5) disposal of all buildings, stores, tools and funiture on Works charge. 1. As it was not desirable that knowledge of the impending withdrawal should become general, orders to close down absolutely all expenditure on works could not he given and it became necessary to delay w orks as tar as possible. In April, orders were issued to section engineers that no large works were to he given out to contract and no building work was to be done before May and then only after further orders from the Assistant Director or Works. At this time road work was still going on and it was considered advisable to finish the proieet in band. By this means expenditure was kept as low as possible without publishing the fact that the Lines of Communication was being withdrawn. The 104th Labour Corps was returned to India leaving Duzdap on June 21st. This meant that Shnsp and posts south of it were deprived of most of their labour and so, for some little time, the Indian masons were kept on and employed completing one or two partially built blocks which it was considered more advantageous in view of final disposal to finish. Practically all Indian labour was employed at the south end of line up to and including Birjand. Owing to the rains continuing late this year and tlneatening at intervals up to withdrawal, a few masons were kept to deal wuth any possible damage. Carpenters had to be kept at each post for repairs and packing of stores, but as it became possible the Indian labour was returned in small parties to their Depots in India. Actual Works Personnel could not be returned, as it was required in the various sections until withdrawal was complete in that section. On the 13th July orders were given fixing Zero day for 24th July and then all expenditure was stopped openly except for work useful to withdrawal, i.e., road maintenance, camps, and w T ater*supplies and essential maintenance of buildings in event of rain. 2. In the end of June all Section Engineers were called on to submit list of all disputed bills, outstanding claims for compensation for land or water and any possible other claims for compensation which might arise. Disputed bills were easily dealt with and finally closed and “ No Claim certificates taken. Compensation claims were a little more difficult and took time to settle. They were all, however, finally assessed by consular agency on representation from both sides. Consuls also put forward claims submitted direct to them. Where Persians were concerned a “No Claim ” certificate, was made out for signature in Persian and English and for all recent and disputed bills copies were lodged with Consuls for future reference. 3. The water-supply at the various marching stages had been improved by the provision of some drinking troughs and improvement to facilities for getting at running water towards the end of 1919. Immediately after my arrival in April, I went thoroughly into the question of the water-supply at each halting place on the Lines of Communication. The result of this examination was forwarded with my original scheme and the necessary102 arrangements were put in hand; these included the provision of tanks for distributing drinking water for man and, where water was obtained from wells, provision for pumps to enable the animals to he w r atered more quickly. Additional troughiug had been supplied at Kain and some places south of it in the beginning of 1920 to enable the Government animals to be watered separately to hired transport ; similar arrangement, where nece.-sary, were now made in ail sections. These troughs were not built at places where animals could water easily at running water. The water-supply at all places was ample without storage except at those places show n in Appendix (l) w r hich show^s the arrangement at each place where special work was necessary. Rules for regulating water at each place were written out. • 4. Camping grounds. % \ Sufficient space cleared and cleaned had to be prepared at each halting stage to accommodate columns ol the size necessary to carry out withdrawal and temporary latrine accommodation provided. Scats were provided for British officers and British other ranks and for Indian ranks existing accommoda tion was increased by trench latrmes with gunny screens on posts round them. These trench latrines were filled in as each column left and another lot dug before the arrival of the next column and screens shifted. On the cleared ground a space lor each unit of the column was marked out and labelled, i.e., one space* for British officers, one for British other ranks, one for hospital. Supply and Transport Cavalry, Artillery, etc., and ground allotted for camels both Government and hired. 5. Disposal of Buildings, Stores, Tools and Furniture on 'Works charge. (a) Buildings. Buildings were handed over to the various Consuls in whose area the narticular hutted encampment was. Blue prints were given showing all buildings with serial number against them and a list prepared giving number of rooms in each building, purpose of building and floor area of each room. (h) Stores and tools. The Consuls were given instructions from India that they could apply for and take o\er such stores and tools as were necessary to maintain the buildings, roads and uater-supplies. The balance of all stores and oo s ux-re back-loaded to India with the exception of some of the heavier road tools Tn the north which vere not worth transport over the long distance and road lools of Persian origin. Those tools not back-loaded were sold by auction. Barbed wire was banded over with the buildings to Consuls. Explosives, if in good condition, were back-loaded ; if not in good condition, destroyed. (c) Furniture. A certain amount of beds, tables, etc., were handed over for use of Levies. The balance was sold by auction. Notes-—Receipts were taken for everything handed over. Withdrawal, T. • i .1 from Meshed and the Lines of Communication, During the 'r s erTioes was ; _(i) To keep the road in a the most importan p r ^ traffic due to the evacuation of sick from ht « th t e be a X mus on the march. (2) The regulation of the waie P r°suurlies It the various halting places with care of camping grounds. ■, ' rp .fpnanee of the road was made more difficult by the increased 1. The ^ 1! te , pVacua tion of refugees from Meshed and also owing • ^“shortage of cars and the consequent use of Eourgons to help out the CG3evacuation of the sick. The damage to the road was worst in section south of Birjand where there were sandy stretches which had been treated for light car traffic only, and could not stand the stream of Fourgons going and returning. This section was dealt with, with a special repair. Other sections having a more solid foundation only required increased gangs. 2. Immediately on notice of Zero day being given, water guards and any stores, such* as pumps, were sent out to each camping ground. The Meshed columns were all personally conducted through each section by an Engineer officer who saw that the camping grounds were ready for them and that watering regulations were observed. ‘The other columns coming at short intervals had to be dealt with in another way; to meet their require ments a subordinate was put in charge of two camping grounds to take the place of the Engineer officer. This subordinate supervised the digging of the new sets of latrines and erection of screens and the refilling of the distri bution tanks for men and storage tanks wher they existed and was responsible for the salving of water stores by the last column to pass that particular camp. The subordinate and water guards came in with the last column. In addition to these two duties there was the reparation at Duzdap to jeceive the columns as they arrived and to accommodate them while waiting for railway accommodation. For this, it was necessary to prepare camp sites, increase latrine accommodation, and provide temporary ccok-houses and water arrangements. A Royal Engineer officer was posted at Duzdap to supervise this work which was mainly carried out by the agency of the 7lst Company, 3rd Sappers and Miners. Camp sites were available and only required marking out. Additional latrines were added to the existing In fantry block and fresh ones put up for the Cavalry and Camel Corps which were accommodated outside the perimeter. Temporary cook-houses of cor rugated iron were ercted for a unit camp and the ordinary rest camp was used for details. By arrangements with the Railway Authorities a conuection was taken off the distribution main to the railway platform and a pipe laid to the unit camps and stand posts with taps provided. For the Cavalry a new well was sunk fcr men’s drinking water near their camp and similarly for the men of the Camel Corps, iron tanks, with taps being provided. The existing troughs for Government camels had orginally been tilled by a Karez, but this had run dry and Iwo wells had been dug, the water from which was pulled up by hand. The troughs were deepened and two more wells dug and pumps supplied. The troughs, were divided into three and the upper third was told off for the horses of the Cavalry and the two lower portions for the Government camels. The Hired Camel Camp was also outside the perimeter and about half way to the Chamak Spring. This spring was improved, collected into one channel and kutcha troughs made. As the evacuation proceeded it was found necessary to march some of the camels straight to the train and to avoid the delay in sending them to. their authorised watering place an emergency water place was formed by making a bye-pass at the pumping station for the military supply for Euzdap, and by providing 5 canvas 600 gallon troughs to enable the camels to water on their way to the loading platform. The camping grounds at Huzdap are all on sandy ground and required little clearing. It was also considered necessary to provide an alternative route from Mukhi Surkh to Hurmuk in case of any emergency causing two columns to be on the stretch at the same time or in case of total failure of water supply at Kundi and Lavari Ab. A camping ground and water-storing arrangements were made, therefore, on the side of the motor road 25 miles north of Hur muk. A distribution tank, for men of the usual pattern was provided and a paulin storage tank for water for horses, etc., with troughs. It was not intended to water camels here. There was no necessity to use this camp but all arrangements were completed except filling up of the water tanks. A certain amount of water was put there ready and the necessary Pakhals and kegs were stored at Hurmuk to complete if necessity arose.104 APPENDIX “ E ” 1, Places at which special water arrangements for storage of water HAD TO BE MADE. Ham ,—Water supply vas from spring. The spring was opened up and then a small closed service reservoir built over it overflow channel made. The ground all round the spring was fenced off to prevent fouling. The overflow channel had three branches, one to row of galvanised iron water tanks to supply drinking water for men, one running into the nullah where bunds were made to store w r ater in natural drinking troughs and the third running into a paulin lined pit for reserve store ot water from which water could be pumped into animal troughs when pace of drinking w as quicker than natural supply. Bohat- T-Mahi.— There is no drinking water at this place ; w ater is obtain able at an approximate depth of 60 feet, but it is too salty for use. Water, therefore, has to he brought by gravity fee from a distance of about 16 miles and payment made. There were two Persian permanent reservoirs and a third was built by works for use of the Seiai ; these three had about 50,000 gallons, but in case of trouble w ith the Persians it was decided to prepare paulin lined tanks to hold a further reserve. There was a little difficulty in filh'ng up the first time as the channel had not been used for some time, and though it was agreed with the Deputy Governor of Turbat that he should clean end nearest to Khairabad, he did not do so ; this was, however, quickly rectified and the water flowed down taking 24 hours to arrive at reservoirs. Pumps supplied the water troughs from these reservoirs. Amrani .—Is another place where there is no water, but contrary to Robat- I-Mahi there is a village near and consequently the water which comes from about 8 miles away is turned cn legularly. All that was necessary, therefore, was to put paulin storage tanks and pumps to fill the troughs. Water could be turned on at any time by sending a man up to source of supply. Birjand —The halting place for columns marching through was near Birjand City and not up by hutted camps. The w ater supply at the camp w as insufficient to do more than supply the reeds of the garrison. There was plenty of water in city supply which w T as from a karez, hut unfortunately it was unsuitable for consumption by men and a special supply for drinking and cooking had to be brought from another karez some little distance off. Shusp. —At Shusp there was plenty of water for men and Government animals and tw o karezes for w atering hired transport. Both these discharged into ponds. One was easily improved by lining the channel from w T bere the karez came to the surface of the pond with stone. The other discharged straight into the pond itself. This pond was filthy and had to be frequently cleaned. It was practicable to make temporary troughs here, hut local oppo sition w'as so strong that it w as considered inadvisable to press the matter, and continual emptying and cleaning pond w as restored to. Chah-I-Kurgaz —This was the beginning of the desert. Two new wells were sunk and wall protection given to prevent the sandstorms filling the wells up. Two paulin-lined tanks for storage were made with capacity of approxi mately 20,000 gallons apiece These were filled gradually from the wells by pumps. The wells with one exception could only be pumped half an hour at a time twice a day. The one exception, however, could be pumped for half an hour only but recouped in about one and half hours thus enabling pne reserve tank to be kept filled. There were six pucca round troughs for drinking, but six more portable 600 gallon troughs were required and placed at the various wells as the yield varied. JMadeh Karez. —The w ater supply here was from w'ells, though to the east of the read water of too salt a nature for ordinary use could be obtained in fair quantity. Paulin storage tanks were supplied here and filled from the wells against the arrival of the columns. The hired transport camels watered mainly on east of the road where kutcha troughs were made, Safidawa.—The water supply here was piped from a distance of approxi mately 4 miles. The only additional requirements were throe of the 610 gallonsi 105 canvas troughs and paulin storage tanks as the daily flow was not sufficient to supply columns in addition to garrison, though more than sufficient for garrison alone Hukhi Surek .—Water supply here when work was started was from springs and was poor both quantity and quality. However, by opening up the existing springs and digging to find otners the quantity was greatly improved and ample water obtained. Paulin storage tanks were necessary, however, as the daily flow at first was not sufficient for a column though towards the end it improved very much and was sufficient for a column in itself. TTwmff.—The supply here was from springs and in spite of all efforts could not he increased. Supply was only about 1,800 gallons a day at commencement, but improved as the temperature dropped up to about 2,800. Storage by paulin tank was started a long time before withdrawal commenced, but after “a” Column of the Meshed garrison had passed it became necessary to stop the camels drinking at this halt. This was the only stage on the line where limitations were necessary. At all other places the storage preparations and improvements to supply enabled all animals to be watered. Jarrika .—Water supply was from wells. These became exhausted on. pumping but recouped quickly. Storage was made in paulin tanks and supply was sufficient. Lowar-I- Ab .—Supply from springs This place also had a flow of ajiout 1,800 gallons a day when work started, hut by opening up the springs great improvement was made and by storage in paulin tanks all columns could he fully watered. Hurmuk .—The water supply here had previously been improved from about 12,000 gallons a day to about 50,000. All that was necessary was addi tional troughing, and this was partly provided by zinc troughs which were available at Huzdap and partly by putting beffie plate in the overflow stream. Supply of drinking water was from wells and animals watering from springs. Shamedar .—Water supply here was from springs up a long narrow nullah about f mile from the road. The flow was not good and the sanitary condition of the nullah was very bad. By opening up the springs the flow w'as improved and the water was piped down to near the road thus avoiding congestion in the nullah and fear of cantamination of the water. Storage in paulin tanks lad to be undertaken as daily supply never exceeded 7,500 gallons. * Notf.— On this lire ti e quality of the water rruch improved as greater demands wers made on it and purging tendencies were decnased. Si&amp;tan Line .— Only small columns had to be considered on this line and so storage on large scale was cot necessary. There were only 5 halting places and of these the two nearest Sistan, namely Chilling and Lutak, were well supplied with w ater by tubes and ft was only necessary to facilitate distribution. The other halts were :— Chah’Mohamed-llaza .—Two additional wells had to he sunk here and storage by paulin tanks used. The existing water hole was in a very bad state and was improved into a well also. Tasuki.— Two additional wells had to he sunk and the existing well cleared and storage provided with paulin tanks. Naicar-Chah .—Two new wells had to he sunk and storage provided. Yield- of wells was very poor and a large storage tank was necessary. GENERAL. All halting places. 1. To avoid contamination, waste of w r ater, wiatting of ground and to facilitate distribution to men, at every halting stage on the line of march except at Rui-Khaf, masonry tank of approximate 2,000 gallons capacity was built and fitted with short projecting lengths of pipes furnished with bibcocks.-106 These tanks were the only supply from which water for drinking and cooking was allowed to be drawn. 2. The capacity of each tank varied a little, but was known exactly in each case thus enabling the medical officer concerned to chlorinate the water to the requisite strength. The tanks were all filled from the immediate source of supply, airect, before the water had a chance of being contaminated by dirt being blown into it and no encroachment was allowed on ground near source of supply to avoid fouling. No camp was allowed within one hundred and in most cases two hundred yards of source of supply. In most cases these tanks were filled by pumps, but in a few cases the conformation of the ground enabled the water where it came from springs or karezes to be run by gravity directly into tank. (Incineration. —At the northern halting places where serais were in existence there were pucca incinerators provided. In southern part i.e , south of Shusp, there were no serais and no pucca incinerators were in existence. There w r ere, however, small incinerators of a temporary type for incinerating rubbish; these were increased to deal with added work. Latrines were of trench pattern in this section.) VI.—Post and Telegraphs. Owing to the withdrawal certain changes in the existing Mail Service had to be made, viz \— («) Section Hurmuk-Shusp.—Fvcm 2nd June 1920 motor service between Hurmuk and Shusp ran twice a week instead of thrice, and from 30th June 19 : ?0it was further reduced to once a week and from 23rd July 1920 motors were removed and mails were carried Levy mules twice a week, viz. } La^aiiab - Kundi and Mukisurkh. (b) Section Shusp- Birjand. - From April 1920 to 4th July 1920 mails were carried by motors twice a week between Shusp and Birjand and from 5th July to 23rd July 1920 once a week. Prom 2nth July 1920 mails were carried by Levy mules twice a week. (e) Section Birjand-Meshed.—From April 1920 to 23rd July 1920 mails were carried by motors once a week and from 24th July 1920 twice a week by Levy mules. Transit from Base Office, Duzdap, to Meshed by motor w'as 12 days, by levies 11 days. Motors did 70 miles a day and halted, while levies travelled night and day, averaging 3 miles an hour. 2. Very few complaints have been received about the non-delivery of letters and tliese, on investigation, have generally been f ound to be due to Bombay mis- sending to Basra. I consider great credit is due to the Post office officials for the prompt delivery of all letters and parcels. 3. Only 15 cases of loss of parcels have been reported, and considering that 59 473 parcels have passed through the Field Post Offices and that the total length of the line is some 800 miles, I consider that here again great credit is due to all officials of this Department. 4 A few days previous to columns and final garrisons leaving their station the Base Office was wired to prepare special bags addressed to respective com mandants and intermediate offices were instructed to effect delivery and these special bags were despatched and delivered to columns wherever they happened When practicable a Postmaster was sent with the columns and final garri- S0I1S '5. To meet the convenience of troops before entraining for India, the Base Office, Duzdap, exchanged all krans for rupees. . «. A „„— r; . a ots few. V-;» L 8ub v«*.«'» fe' '*'« left at Meshed, Birjand, Sistan and Duzdap. 199 CGS107 7. For the past three and a half years the postal staff have worked \villing- lv under very trying climatic conditions in certain posts, and although m many of the offices there was only one official, there was never a case of a man going sick when he was ill and thus dislocating the service. 8. From 7th October 1920 mails are being despatched for Kerman and Yezd twice a week; these mails are transferred from the office of exchange at Fuzdap to the Persian Post Office. 9. A statement of work done from 1st December 1919 to 31st October 1920 is shown in Appendix II. TELEGRAPH. 1 To facilitate communication during the withdrawal, I applied and obtained sanction for a light telephone line between Hurmuk and Mukhisurkh via Kundi and Lavariab. This 58 miles of line was started on the 11th and completed by the 16th September 1920. In the construction of this line very valuable assistance was given by Jemadar Shabir Hussain and 40 men of the 1-307th Pioneers. This party worked extremely well and in very trying climatic conditions, as the heat in this part of the line in September was intense. This line enabled Headquarters to be in constant telephonic communication with all troops marching along this section of the Lines of Communication where the water supply was a constant anxiety. This line has been left standing in accordance with instructions received from India. • 2. To keep in touch with the columns and final garrisons coming down the Lines of Communication, I wanted telephonic communication at places w r here columns halted and where telephonic communication did not exist, so new stations were opened at— 1. Maina, 2. Robatimai, 3. Birjuk, 4. Terminal near Kidri, 5. Terminal near Najimabad, 6. Sedeh, and, as the final garrisons passed through, ab^ve stations were closed. 3. Special arrangements during withdrawal were made for Telegraph Offices to keep open up to half an hour prior to departure of final columns and garrisons, and this was achieved by resorting to vibrators, which permitted of other Morse instruments, battery, etc., being packed the night previous; and the staff who went down with final columns were ready to leave as soon as required with their respective columns. 4. Sub-Inspectors accompanied each Meshed column with a phone, and a telegraphist with a phone also accompanied the final garrisons so that Headquarters was always in touch with the troops. 5. On departure of final columns and garrisons Field Telegraph Offices were closed as detailed below :— Meshed Camp Office closed on . Turbat-i-Haidri closed . . Jumin „ • • Kam &gt;) n • • Rui-Khof „ „ • • Shusp » » • • Safedawa ,, ,, • . 6. As Headquarters was shifted, the Telegraph staff was strengthened right down from Shusp to Duzdap, and on arrival at Dazdap the men that could be spared were immediately demobilized. l*2th September 1920, forenoon. 20th 28th 5th October 28th September 23id October 1st November* r— €7) 108 7. As no orders had been received up to 31st August regarding the dispo sal of the Posts and Telegraphs Service after the withdrawal, I made certain suggestions, in consultation with the Consuls concerned, and which were eventually approved by the Chief of the General Staff, for a post withdrawal service, vide Appendix III. 8. In accordance with the wishes of the Consul, Sistan, a combined Post and Telegraph Office has been established at Hurmuk. 9. Of the six Russian telegraphists whose employment was sanctioned in Government of India letter No. 9743, of 14th September 1918, one declined to accept the terms offered, one died at Rui-Khaf on 8th July 1920, and one resigned in July 1919, the remaining three have been paid up and discharged in accordance with the terms of their agreement. 10. Telegraph lines erected during the existence of the Lines of Communi cation and which have not been dismantled are shown in Appendix IV. 11. The Telegraph Service has been thoroughly efficient during the time I have been Inspector-General of Communications and the greatest credit is due to Major Kilmon and his staff, both Postal and Telegraph, for the good work they have done in East Persia.

A final inspection of all animals, except those at Sistan, ^as niade by my Deputy Assistant Director, Veterinary Services, before withdrawal and a small number of useless animals were weeded out and destroyed. No animals were sold except 35 cast horses of 42nd Cavalry at Duzdap, the majority of these going to the Sistan Levy Corps and a few horses at Meshed. 3. AH surplus serviceable veierinary equipment and medicines other than those on unit charge, and those left with units remaining in East Persia, including Levy Corps, were withdrawn and sent to the Medical Store Keeper to Government, Bombay, or Officer Commanding, Station Veterinary Hospital, Quetta. 4. Special orders were issued regarding the exercise of mules with loads on to harden their backs for the long march, and every effort was made to get all animals fit for the task before them. Mules were shod in front for the march. 5. The condition of all animals was well maintained on the march and at the time of entrainment was on the w hole satisfactory. The improvement in the condition of Government camels between April and November w T as particularly marked. Appendix I gives a comparative statement of sick camels week by week from May to November 1919-20. Very great credit is due to the various Commandants'and Transport Officers (often very inexperienced in camel management) for the interest they took in their animals and for the keen attention ttey paid to the orders issued for the welfare of their camels. At the end of the march the total number of Government camels evacuated sick to India was 214, i 7 per cent., vide Appendix IT. The total number &lt;f animals destroyed on the march was &amp; camels, 8 horses and 4 mules. There was no outbreak of contagious disease during the withdrawal; in fact there was very little sickness of any sort. Camels have already been referred to, and the total number of sick horses and mules, all able to accompany units to India, was horses 30, mules 54. As is usual after a march sore backs helped to swell the percentage of sick animals. The 60th Camel Corps had 50 cases partly due to bad fitting palans but more perhaps to the coarseness of the lining. The percentage of sore backs in horses was negligible, but in mules amounted to just over 8 per cent, and this in spite of every precaution being taken in advance to avoid sore backs. Slack gerthing and uneven loading are of course common contributory causes, but the type of mule pack saddle in use in East Persia seems capable of improvement and the following points are worthy of attention :— (1) The straps fastened to the side bars are in many cases not counter sunk on bearing surface of side bars. (2^ Some of the side bars are straight and not shaped, and do not bear 1 ^ evenly on the back ; in many cases lower edge only takes the bearing. . , , (3) The Numnah is fastened to the side bars on inner side by means of 1 j a metal flange often bent into all shapes, causing uneven (4) The Numnah does not afford the protection to the hack afforded by well padded pannels. (5) The padded part of the Numnah is often insufficiently padded. n Vnonial diseases Treatment and special precautions adopted Mange JJ^TtfCTeenby iarand away the most important drsease dealt with during the period “ nt * e practically the whole of the camels of As previously mentioned I p Modified Dep6t Unit of the 64th, 60th and 72nd 1 &amp; ]ar&lt;ie nufn j, er of which had greatly Transport, Duzdap, were a ed,^ to ”£ e djs!eas0 being of long standing. thickened and corru 0 ated si P | Unit Headquarters, the remainder About 300 ^els were under tr^tment at l mt ^ carfied working if otherwise fit Ihe treatment ^ e ive forni „i rtat . obtained from India. The question of treating such113 a large number of camels practically always on the move over such a long* Lines of Communication presented many difficulties. The unsatisfactory condition of the camels in April and many of the casualties and cases of debi lity could be ascribed to mange. Treatment by dipping all camels every five days in a solution of calcium sulphide was decided on. Temporary dips lined with paulins were made at Meshed, Turb tt, Jumin, Kain, Birjand, Sbusp, Harmuk, Luzdap. The ingre dients of the dip, sulphur being crude sulphur which was finely powdered before use and made quite a satisfactory dipping solution. Liquor Creosol, when available, was added in the proportion of 1 to 2 per cent. Palans and gear generally were disinfected every ten days either by an immersion in a solution of liquor creosol in water or fumigation in closed building with sul phur dioxide, obtained by burning sulphur. Detailed orders for treatment were issued to all concerned (vide Appen dix 3). This treatment, in spite of many difficulties, has been satisfactorily carried out with gratifying results, at the time of withdrawal mange having practically disappeared, all camels being in good coat and only a very small minority showing any traces of thickened skin. The danger of re-infection with so many hired camels on the line is difficult to guard against, and for this reason periodical dipping for all camels working under such conditions is advocated. Mange in horses and mules —Cases of Sarcoptic mange in horsts and * mules have been met, also Psoroptic mange in horses. Mange in horses or mules has never made any headway, as cases have been detected early and all necessary precautions taken against spreading. Mange in goats .—Saicoptic mange v\as met with in many stations amongst slaughter goats, often in a very advanced stage. This disease was very soon eradicated, affected animals being slaughtered, pens disinfected and greater care being exercised in veterinary inspections when taking over from contractors Jhwling .—This disease was very prevalent last winter. On April 25th, 1920, the number of cases under treatment was 196. Eoutine dipping for camels for mange has, I believe, to a large extent, been the reason for the reduction in the number of cases, only 33 remaining under treatment on October 30th, 1920. The 54th Camel Corps, in which unit dipping has been most thoroughly carried out, had 51 cases in April, and on October 25th on return to India, not a single case remained under treatment. The specific treatment adopted for this disease was rigid isolation of cases, the application of binoxodide of mercury blLter, followed by a dressing of a strong solution of crystals of potassium permanganate. Surra .—A careful lookout has been kept for Surra in camels. Only one case has been diagnosed and that in a remount camel from India No Govern ment camels have been employed in Sistan where Tabanidae and other biting flies are numerous and Surra in camels is reported to be prevalent. Tabanidae have been seen at Kain and Stomoxyes are common on the whole length of the Lines of Communication. Glanders .—During the period under review, six cases of Glanders occurred in Meshed in animals of Malmiss Force and Lines of Ccommunication animals, the majority of which w r ere diagnosed by a general testing of all animals with Mallein. All cases were destroyed and the usual precautions taken. One horse with Meshed B. column showing suspicious symptoms was malleined, reacted and was destroyed at Birjand on 14th September. Special orders re garding disinfection of water troughs on the Lines of Communication during the withdrawal were issued, also orders forbidding the use of Government troughs by civilian owned animals. As a further precaution, all horses and mules w T ere tested with mallein on arrival at Hurmuk or Duzdap before proceeding to Sistan, Kwash or India with the following results. Two horses and 2 mules gave positive reactions and were destroyed and burnt; 49 horses and 19 mules gave doubtful reactions. Of these to date 14th, 11th, 10th, 11 horses and 2 mules have been retested and all passed except one horse which reacted and was destroyed and burnt, leaving 38 horses and 17114 7o ) mules still to be retested. The majority of doubtful cases were retained for retest for temperature reactions, very few showing suspicious local reactions. Glanders is reported to be common amongst ciyilian owned horses and mules in Meshed District. Contagious Pleura-Pneumonia in goats. —The disease has been responsible for many casualties in slaughter goats at Birjand, Shusp, Safedawa and Hur- muk. The largest outbreak occurred at Shusp. This was stamped out by isola tion of sick, inoculation of the remainder, provision of larger and new pens and the disinfection of pens. With greater care in veterinary inspection on taking over systematic inspection of flocks, better penning arrangements, im mediate and effective isolation of sick, the disease has practically disappeared. Contagious Pleuro-Pneumonia in goats is a disease which is well known to the Persians and for which they practice a crude but effective form of inoculation. The seat of inoculation being the ear. Liver Fluke, Hydatid, Cysts and Intestinal Parasites—axe very com monly met with in sheep and goats and are responsible for a large number of cases of debility and deaths. Leeches These are very commonly met with at most watering places, mrtioularly in Southern Sections and caused great inconvenience to animals. The Larnyz in sheep and goats is common location, resulting in loss of condi tion. Such cases have been slaughtered when found. Straining of water through gunny cloth, where possible, has been carried out with good results. Ma(wots .—In the nasal passage and in the sinuses of the head in sheep and goate are common, causing a profuse mucoid discharge from the nostrils and loss of condition. Slaughter is the only treatment. _ Kiaht blindness. —This condition was found to be very prevalent in caval- rv horses at Hurmuk. 78 horses out of 92 examined were found to be affected Very few cases were found in horses at other stations. The cause is due to the intense heat and glare, no shelter being provided at Hur muk Eve shades of blue cloth were provided for the cavalry horses at tt i liftte or no improvement was noted at an examination about six Hurmuk but little or no mprov^m number of camcl9 it would appear tlmt'from ten to fifteen per cent, of camels are affected with night blindness, ft Prom September 24th onwards Headquarters of the Deputy Assistant animals before entraining for I^ia and to take ov ™ u c nct;oil of the sick and - jurats*“rts and his staff renderin'* great assistance in running the Dep . 9 The attached charts, marked 1, 2 and 8, show the weekly fluctuations of , ' !k ** of the units had despatched the majority of the sick to India. rZts 2 and 3 show an increasing number of sick shortly after I arrived.

Mange in camels. —At the present time is very prevalent and is respon sible for loss of condition in camels and great wastage. Mange can only be cured by sustained and vigourous treatment. Cases are more amenable to treatment during the summer months. I wish treatment on the following lines carried out as soon as possible and every effort made to eradicate the diseases. The most satisfactory way of treating at present is to look upon the whole of the camels as affected and carry out the treatment systematically as a routine measure until further notice. Dipping. —All camels to be dipped as far as possible every five days, camels arriving on convoy at Birjand, Jumin and Hurmuk can be dipped at these places. Clipping, —When necessary, camels must be clipped as dipping camels with long coats is futile. Animals shoi^ld not be clipped in lines but in a special place and the hair either destroyed or disinfected by soaking in creosol place and the hair either destroyed or disinfected by soaking in creosol and water and dried in the sun before being taken away. Grouping in cases. —Advanced mange cases should not be worked and should be segregated. All other cases should be grouped according to the extent of the disease, slight cases together and so on. Cleanlines of lines. —Camel lines should be kept as clean as possible and, where possible, standing changed frequently, say every 14 days. Camel ceding troughs should be kept clean and edges where camels rub neck frequently ime washed. Camel dip. —Until such time as permanent dips can be constructed q good dip can be made as follows A hole of the following dimensions is dug in the ground.

If ground is stony the surface should be covered with mud con &gt; alning bi oosa. Pauli ns which are water tight should be spread in the dip and at entrance nd at e&gt; r, three medium-sized paulins are required. The edges should be cry w&lt; ’ i egged down and the sides covered with bags full of earth to keep n position. ‘ r A wooden crush at entrance facilitates getting the camels into the dip. An old paulin placed op the good one in the dip will prolong the life of the good one. Preparation of dip.—The ingredients of dip are :— 1) Fresh lime.—It is of the utmost importance that the lime b e freshly burnt and when water is added should bubble and become hot. Lime which is usually found on the lime is slaked o badly burnt and is useless, (2) Sulphur. —Flour of sulphur is the best preparation, but if this is no forthcoming local sulphur can be used. This must be well powdered. This is very important as if at all lumpy it will not unite with the lime when boiled.118 (c) Liquor creosol. —To make dipping solution proceed as follows :—■ Take 10 pounds of fresh lime and spread it out on a paulin or wooden surface to a thickness of 3 inches, and water and slake the lime thoroughly, then add 221b suplhur and mix the whole thoroughly into a thick paste. Add this paste slowly to 20 gallons boiling water, stirring -well ; continue to boil well and keep stirring until the colour assumes that of chocolate. Continue to boil for 15 minutes more, add water to keep up the original bulk of 20 gallons during the process Then allow the solution to cool and settle. Carefully decant off the amber coloured fluid and throw the residue away. For the purpose of dipping, one part of this solution is added to 3 parts water ; into this liquor creosol is added in the proportion of 2 parts to 100 of the diluted solution. If a large boiler cannot be obtained, smaller quanti ties can be boiled in same proportion. The dip should be fulid and kept filled to a depth of about 18 inches. Process of dipping .—The camel should have a head collar put on and quietly led into the dip, not pulled in by the nose rope. Restive camels may be blindfolded and assisted into the dip by a rope round buttocks and pulled in. When in the bath the camel is made to sit down and both forelegs roped. One man holds the camel’s nose and three others armed with brushes and buckets proceed to scrub the solution thoroughly into the skin, paying particular atten tion to the head, neck and parts affected with mange. Each camel should be timed to stay in the dip for five minutes. The camel should be kept at the exit of the dip for a few minutes to drain. It is of the utmost importance that no part of the skin should escape the dressing. Becord of dipping.'—k register should be kept showing against the number of the camel, dates dipped. Disinfection of rugs, palans, grooming kit, water proof sheets and all camel gear. This must be carried out systematically either by immersion in a solution of 2 per cent, liquor creosol and water for 10 minutes or by putting in a closed building and exposing to the fumes of burning sulphur for half an hour. Application of Tar amir a This will be confined to dressing the affected parts where the skin in thickened and corrugated on the evening of the day following the dipping. ■Until the sulphur and lime can be obtained dipping will be carried out, the dip bein&lt;* ma de of water containing 2 per cent, liquor creosol. In places where lime and sulphur cannot be obtained by local purchase, application sbould be made to Deputy Assistant Director, Veterinary Services, Birjand, who will arrange for supplies to be sent. When dip is not being used, it should be covered with p&amp;ulins to keep dirt out*( e c VETERINARY CHARTS, L. of C EAST PERSIA showing I.
