If you agree with the suggestion that, in its application to Bahrein,the Indian Christian Marriage Act should he modified, as the Foreign Office suggest by a King* s Regulation, if haps we should give the Political Resident some guidance on the ihaming of his draft. He has no Legal Adviser in the jS-ulf to advise him. I attach a dral^t letter to Sir Rupert Hay with a tentative draft of the King's Regulation which might give effect to the Foreign Office suggestion if you accept it.—I am not sure that the draft amendment suggested is in all respects suitable. The sectior^provides that the notice shall be given to a Marriage Registrar 'of the district within which the parties have dwelt', - residence v/ithin such district being assumed rather than expressly required. A mere dispensation of the 'requirement' will thus fail to make it clear to which Registrar notice must then be giveri^ I would be inclined to suggest to the P.0, an amendment on the following lines 1. Add (as the 3rd para, to s.38) - 'or, if neither of the parties dwells or has * dwelt within the district of any Marriage Registrar, shall give the like notice to the Marriage Registrar by or before*whom the marriage is intended to be solemnised'. 2. Insert in s.41, between the first and second clauses of the proviso 'that, in the case of parties neither of whom dwells or has dwelt v/ithin the district of any Marriage Registrar, the Marriage Registrar is satisfied that the marriage cannot conveniently be solemnised at the place where either of the parties has dwelt and that the marriage is not clandestine;' 3. Add to s.42(b) 'or, as the case may be, that neither party has had his or her usual place of abode v/ithin the district of any Marriage Registrar,' 4. Add to the 4th para, of s.51 the following proviso: 'provided that, in the case of parties neither of whom dwells or has dwelt within the district of any Marriage Registrar, the Marriage Registrar in whose presence the marriage shall be solemnised shall be the Marriage Registrar to whom the notice under s.38 was given.'u?

Legal opinion xiere is doubtful whether the extension of the Political Agent's jurisdiction for this xourpose beyond the limits of tiie Order- in-Oouncil would not be ultra vires the Order. There would appear however to be no objection in giving the P.A. authority, in his cap acity as Marriage Registrar to dispense with the requirements of residence in Bahrein in indivi dual cases.

FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 23t4 October, 1947. fNDSxeo Dear Harrison, you wrote to me on the 27th September (your reference Ext. 2017/U7) about the proposed amendment of the Indian Christian Marriage Act in order to enable the Political Agent, Bahrein, to marry United States citizens residing at Dhahran in Saudi Arabia. 2 . while we agree that the only way to confer this power upon the Political Agent is by amending the Indian Christian Marriage Act by means of a King^ Regulation, we rather doubt whether amending Section 8 of the Act to enable the Political Agent to perform the general functions of Marriage Registrar in respect of Dhahran is the best way of doing it. Such an amendment of Section 8 would look too much like an extension of the Agent f s jurisdiction and ■v might be ultra vires the Foreign jurisdiction Act, 1890. This would be avoided if the Political Agent were to be given authority, in his capacity of Marriage Registrar,to dispense with the requirement of residence in Bahrein in individual cases by adding a suitable additional proviso to Section 38 and making a small consequential amendment.to Section l\2 (b). The Marriage Registrar would thus be empowered, when he was satisfied that either of the parties had been unable to reside in Bahrein, to grant a dispensation from such residence. 3. If you agree to this proposal we shall be glad if you will let us see a copy of the draft King*s Regulation in due course. What we F. A. K. Harrison, Esq., Commonwealth Relations Office, King Charles Street. / havehave in mind is to add to the end of Section 38 some such words as:- 'provided further, that if either party has not 'been able to comply with the requirement of 'dwelling within the district of any Marriage 'Registrar, and the Marriage Registrar before 'whom the marriage is intended to be solemnized 'has satisfied himself that the marriage cannot 'be conveniently celebrated at the place where 'that party has dwelt, and that the marriage is 'not clandestine, the Marriage Registrar may, in ' respect of that party, dispense with that require- 'ment.' The words to be added to Section 1+2 (b) would read:- 'or that a dispensation from the requirement of 'dwelling within the district of the Marriage 'Registrar lias been granted in respect of either ' party.'

Sir, I have the honour to refer to the correspondence //OS resting with my letter jfo. 1702-I B/4 dated the 1st August^ 1947, and to state thatThe intention of the issue of King *3 Regulation No. 2 of 1947 (The Christian Marriage (Ammendment) Regulation, 1947) was to legalise the marriage in Bahrain j of American citizens resident in, among other places, Dhahran - 757 ^^ 6 . c.f. my letter No. 3270-18/4 dated the 14/18th October, 1946. 2. Under Section 51 of the Indian Christian Marriage iict a marriage by, or in the presence of, a Marriage Registrar can be solemnized only after the issue of the certificate mentioned in Section 41 of the Act. Under Section 42 (b) of the Act such certificates cannot be issued until one of the parties intending marriage has made oath before the marriage Registrar that the party making such oath has had his or her usual place of abode within the district of such Marriage Registrar. The district of the Political Agent, Bahrain, as Marriage Registrar, does not extend beyond the limits of the Bahrain Order-in-Council; and, while in practice he performs certain consular functions for persons resident in Dhahran, the Political Agents district as a Marriage Registrar does not extend to Dhahran. 2. To overcome this difficulty it would appear to be necessary to have the district of Dhahran in Saudi Arabia included within the jurisdiction of the Political Agent, Bahrain, for the purpose of exercising his functions as Marriage Registrar under the Indian Christian Marriage A c t. I therefore propose, that, under Section 70 of the Bahrain Order-in-Council, 1913, a King*s Regulation, as in the draft enclosed, should be issued.

Mr. Bevin would further suggest that the Political Resident should be advised to warn all aliens whom he may marry under the new regulations that the marriage may not be valid under the lav/ of the country to which they belong and that they should consequently take the earliest opportunity of being married under their national laws or by a ceremony which will be recognised as valid under those laws. 5.

J ( 3 ;- ') £. P. DONALDSONr-s The authority of the Political Agent, Bahrein, to celebrate marriages is derived from the application to Bahrein of the Indian Christian Marriage Act XV of 1872 by King's Regulation No.2 of 1922, which/limited the application to British subjects. The Act was omitted from the. Schedule attached to the Bahrein Order in Council, 1913, which document is the sole authority empowering the Political Agent to act in the case of foreigners. faj) A** fft-sjUjUf** ^ fk / /fhc question arose recently when the United States f Consul at Dhahran in Saudi Arabia approached the Political Agent, Bahrein, with the request that he should marry two American citizens. The Political Agent found that although both parties were Christians he was unable to perform the ceremony as foreigners were specifically excluded from his jurisdiction by the limited application of the Indian Christian Marriage Act. He had, therefore, to refuse the request of the U.S. Consul. vV; V; vO A similar case arose in Koweit in 1937* The Political Agent, Koweit, was, however, found to be empowered to marry foreigners, provided one of them was a Christian, because the Indian Christian ularriage Act was applied to Koweit by the Koweit Order in Council, 1933, which specifically included foreigners within the jurisdiction of the Political Agent. A doubt arose as to the validity of marriages thus performed, but the Foreign Office considered that the law as prescribed in the Koweit Order in Council would be regarded as the lex loci by the authorities of foreign countries, and that in cases where the law of the foreigner's country regarded the form of marriage as governed by the lex loci celebrationis , a marriage ceremony by the Political Agent would be regarded as valid as to form. As such cases are likely to occur in Bahrein in increasing numbers in the future, the Political Resident/Resident in the Persian Gulf proposes to issue an amendment (attached) to King*s Regulation No.2 of 1922 under his powers under Section 70 of the Bahrein Order in Council, 1J13, so as to empower the Political Agent, Bahrein, to perform marriage ceremonies between foreigners in Bahrein. V j. should be glad of your opinion as to whether there is any legal objection to the issue of this amendment by the Political Resident, and whether, on the analogy of Koweit, such marriages are likely to be held as valid in the foreigners’ countries. Ufr should also be glad to know if you concur in the terms of the draft letter to the Foreign Office submitted herewith.4 FILE COPY. .&gt; V No Y t X FiW &lt;§&gt; - 3270 - 18/4. PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, I BAHRAIN. I\K (279 on'b] 4 Q.n the Persian Gulf. The^Hon'ble the Political Resident 4f4 n To His Majesty*s Secretary of State for India, India Office, London. Dated Bahrain, the 14th/18th October, 1946. Sir, I have the honour to state that the Political Agent, Bahrain, was recently approached by the United States Consul, Dhahran (Saudi Arabia), with a request to marry two American citizens. Both of these persons were Christians but the Political Agent had to refuse the request as the application of the Indian Christian Marriage Act XV of 1872, as applied to Bahrain by King*s Regulation No. 2 of 1922, is limited by the terms of that Regulation to~BPltlsh suBJects only. There is therefore no legal provision for the marriage, according to British Law, of non-British Christians in Bahrain. In respect of Americans, the United States Consul at Dhahran has, of course, no jurisdiction in Bahrain and he is, in fact, not authorised to conduct marriages at all, even in his own Consular District in Saudi Arabia. 2. A reference to the correspondence enclosed with India Office letter No. PZ 4815/37.dated the 29th July. 1937. will show that the position in Kuwait is different. There the nationality of the parties does not affect the Political Agent»s authority to marry them because the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872, was applied in Kuwa it by A r tic le 11(2) of the Kuwait J)rder in Council, 1925^ (read with the schedule thereto), to all persons subject to the order* Foreigners, as defined in Article 4, would include nationals of the United States of America and, under Article 8 , all foreigners are . persons subject to the Order. 2. Since it appears that cases of the kind referred to in paragraph 1 of this dispatch are bound to recur in increasing numbers in the future, I submit that the time has now come for the Political Agent (as Marriage Registrar) and other persons detailed in Section 5 of the Indian Christian carriage Act to be empowered to conduct marriages between Christian foreigners, as well as between Christian British subjects.

Sir, r?' ni°i ■3^ 29th ultimo relative to the celebration of marriages by the Political Agent at Kov/eit I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that he concurs in the view of the Government of India that the Political Agent can solemnise marriages when at least one of the parties is a Christian, irrespective of the nationality of the parties. 2. I am to explain that when the Foreign Office letter E 6143/5255/91 of the 21st November 1933, was written, no account was taken of the fact that the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872, already applied, under the Kov/eit Order in Council, 1925, to all persons in Kov/eit subject to the Order in Council. The passages in the above-mentioned Foreign Office letter dealing with the question of registration of births, marriages and deaths of foreigners were also written under a misapprehension of the actual position. I am therefore to request that you will now regard as cancelled paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of that letter. The question of registration in Bahrain was discussed in the semi-official letter E 414/414/91 of the 6th March, 1936 from Mr. Brenan to Mr. Clauson, and the considerations therein/ The Under Secretary of State, India Office.

As regards the validity in the countries to which the parties 'belong of marriages celebrated hy the Political Agent at Koweit, I am to state that the law prescribed by the Koweit Order in Council as applicable to persons subject to that Order would no doubt be regarded as the lex loci by the authorities of foreign countries, and it therefore seems probable that in cases where the lav/ of the foreigners country regards the form of a marriage as governed by the lex loci celebrationis &gt; a marriage celebrated by the Political Agent would be regarded as valid as to form. It would however be for the parties themselves to ascertain, by consulting the authorities of their own country or a lav/yer with a knowledge of the law of that country, whether any additional formalities would be required in order to render the marriage valid under their national law.

From the correspondence, a copy of which was forwarded to the Foreign Office with India Office printed letter No. P.Z. 3695/37 of 9th June, it will have been observed that notice of marriage between a British and an American subject was given in April last at Kuwait, and that the Government of India in their Express letter of 17th May 1937 advised the Political Agent that the marriage should be solemnised by him in accordance with the Indian Christian Marriage Act 1872 9 this Act having been made applicable in Kuwait by the Kuwait Order-in-Council of 1935.

Minute Paper. political Department. 5853 5000 3/37 Le;{al Acwlser. tt* In paragraph 6 of their letter of the 21st November, 1933 (flagged below) the Foreign Office expressed the opinion that it was undesirable that the Political Agent at Kuwait should perform marriages between Christian foreigners. It was stated that the celebration of marriages by.British officers was under the authority of the Foreign Marriage Act, 1892 (see r \ also Section I, Chapter XXX, Consular Instructions) which only applies where one of the parties is a British subject, and that it was doubtful whether any legislation by Order in Council empowering the Political Agent to perform marriages between two foreigners would render such marriages valid in the foreign country concerned. 2. In connection with the recent case of a marriage at Kuwait between a British and an American subject, the Government of India have stated (paragraph 5 of their letter of the 17th May below) that as the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872, has been applied to Kuwait by the Kuwait Order in Council, 1935, marriages between two foreigners can be performed by the Political Agent. 3. I should be glad of your opinion as to whether the present position is as stated by the Government of India. Presumably, if so, it is still undesirable that such marriages should actually be performed by the Political Agent since it is doubtful whether such marriages would be valid in the countries-9 JUNB57 (® Cop/ of Expresa letter No.C/87 of 1937, dated the 16th April 1937, from the Political Resident, Bushire, to Government of India, New Delhi, repeated Political Agent, Kuwait. y -- '1 $695 Subject: Solemnisation of marriages by /« the Political Agent, Kuwait. { I have received a communication from the Political Agent, Kuwait, to the effect that a Mr. Allison, a British subject employed in the Kuwait Oil Company, and Dr. Miss Bruins, an American citizen in the employ of the Arabian Mission, have given notice of marriage about the middle of May. 2. There seems no doubt that the Political Agent can solemnise marriages in general vide Section ll(2)(ii) of the Kuwait Order in Council, 1935. The question arises whether he can solemnise a marriage between Mr. Allison and Miss Bruins. 3. The Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872, was applied to Kuwait by King's Regulation No.4 of 1927 in regard to British subjects as defined in Article 4 of the said Order. The King's Regulation in effect requires that both parties to the marriage^should^be^British subjects, and under the definition/of the Kuwait Order in Council Miss Mruins is a 'foreigner*. It would appear, therefore, that the Political Agent cannot solemnise the marriage in question, and I would be glad to know by telegram whether the Government of IndiaTo ....

The Political Agent can solemnise the marriage in question. Indian Christian Marriage Act has been applied in Kuwait by Article 11(2) of Kuwait Order in Council, 1935, to all persons subject to Order which includes foreigners. It therefore follows that in its application to Kuwait the Act would operate in respect of every marriage between persons one or both of whom is or are a Christian or Christians and any such marriage solemnised otherwise than in accordance with the provision of the Act will be void. It is not necessary that either or both parties to marriage should be British subjects. Letter follows.1 'in O Govarnment of India. '■''■J'-Jy., j SXTKRNjiL AKFAITS DSPARTMiSNT.

Foreigners as defined in Article 4 would include nationals of the United States of America ana under Article 6 all foreigners are persons subject to the Oraer. The only modiiication (other than the usual adaptations) made in respect of this Act is that the Political Agent, iuwait, as long as he is a Christian, is to be deemed to be the Registrar of Marriages.

It is not necessary that either or both the parties to the marriage should be British subjects. 3. It is not correct to say that the Act was applied to Kuwait by King’s Regulation No.4 of 1927 in regard to British subjects. That Regulation merely purports to appoint the Political Agent, Kuwait, as the iegistrar of Marriages# No doubt it contains a recital to the effect that the Act is applicable in Kuwait in regard to British subjects. It is not clear how this recital came to be included but it is unnecessary to enquire into this because i-he application ot the Act to Kuwait now depends upon Article 11(2) of the Kuwait Order in Council, 1935. 4. The position therefore is that the proposed marriage between Mr. Allison and Dr. Miss Bruins, one is or or both of whora,/are Christians, not only can but must oe solemnised in accordance with the provisions of the Act. o# The application of the Act to 'all persons subject to this Order” causes the Act to be equally applicable to a marriage between two persons both of , whom are foreigners.

The Chief Court may, where it appears so expedient, by warrant under the hand and seal of the Political Eesident, cause the accused to be sent for trial to Bombay accordingly.

St. G. 327Extract from letter from Foreign Office No. E 6143/5255/91, dated 21st November, 1933. XXX 6. There remains the question of the celebration of marriages. Sir John Simon considers it undesirable that the Political Agents at Bahrain and Koweit should perform marriages between foreigners. The celebration of marriages by British officers is under the Foreign Marriage Act and that Act only applies where one of the parties is a British subject. Althou 1 it may be legally possible to provide, by Order“in-Council under the foreign Jurisdiction Act, for formalities of marriage for foreigners subject to British jurisdiction, Sir John Simon does not consider it necessary or desirable to endeavour to legislate specially for the purpose of marriages by these officers between foreigners, to whom the Bahrain (or Koweit': Order-in-Council applies. In the first place, it is doubtful whether, for instance, such a marriage celebrated by the Political Agent at Bahrain between two United States citizens would possess increased validity m United States lav/ owing to provisions for such marriages having been made by Order-m- Council. Again, United States law, and indeed the laws of most countries, contain principles similar to the English comi on law marriage, under which marriages celebrated by a minister of religion or per verba de praesenti in countries where there is no local form available are recognised as valid. Since, therefore, in all probability no special legal provision by His ajesty’s Government for such marriages would increase their validity in the eyes of foreign governments, it seems best to leave them to be celebrated in one of the forms referred to above. 7. Finally, as regards the registration of marriages, the Secretary of State sees no objection to the Political Agent keeping a register for the marriages of foreigners in Bahrain, in which he will record the particulars of marriagesoiD reported by the parties to have been celebrated between them and the manner of their celebration. Registration of this kind is merely a record of what has taken place and is in no way a celebration of marriage. Nor, as stated m paragraph 4 above, woald sach a register add any validity to the marriage or purport to lo ^o, bat it might assist m the proof of a marriage if the question whether it had been celebrated arose at a later date.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000370_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3330</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000370</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3330</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 25/25 'Orders in Council: Kuwait and Bahrain: Celebration of marriages between foreigners by Political Agents at Bahrain and Koweit'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1937/1948</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-11-29T22:54:09</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (115 folios)</extent><extent>The file is arranged in chronological order from the back to the front.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 117; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Correspondence, drafts, and minute papers relating to the drafting and issue of amendments to The Christian Marriage Regulation, 1922, made under the Bahrain Order in Council, 1913. Amendments to the regulation were thought necessary in order to authorise the Political Agent, Bahrain, to marry non-British subjects (The Christian Marriage (Amendment) Regulation, 1946) and those who were resident in Saudi Arabia (The Christian Marriage (Amendment) Regulation, 1948). Discussion of the need for and wording of the amendments occur in exchanges between officials at the India Office, Foreign Office, Government of India (External Affairs Department), and the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf.Also included in the file is correspondence concerning similar questions in Kuwait, namely, whether the Political Agent is able to solemnise the marriage between foreigners or non-Christians (folios 87-98). A copy of The Kuwait Order in Council, 1935 is included for reference purposes.A copy of The Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872 (XV of 1872) is also contained in the file (folios 16-39).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000370#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
