A translation of the Imam of Muscat’s letter (folio 243), dated 23 May 1854, is enclosed with Kemball’s letter. In the letter the Imam states that the Beni Boo Ali tribe no longer submit to his authority. Enclosed with Kemball’s letter is another letter, the translated substance of a letter (folios 244-45) from the British Agent at Muscat, addressed to Kemball, dated 28 May 1854.
