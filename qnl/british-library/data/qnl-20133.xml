His Majesty's Government to address a letter to the Sultan in the following sense. of both (a) and (b) above concerning which the Sultan gave me no information. With regard to (a) that His Majesty^ Government would be glad of as long notice as possible of His Highness's intended travels outside his State in case he should wish them to arrange any facilities required. With regard to (b) that when it is to the advantage of his State, His Highness avails himself of His Majesty's Govern ment for communication with foreign Powers on his behalf, which His Majesty's Government are of course very pleased to do e.g. raising of Muscat tariff. In return for this His Majesty's Government would be grateful if His Highness would inform them through me of any communication which he proposes to make to foreign Powers.

With regard to (a) I doubt whether Sultan has any intention of visiting Rome for purposes of intrigue as after the Abyssinian episode Sultan (at present anyhow) has a cordial dislike for the Italians. *&gt;• In regard to (b) Sultan is obviously try ing to have it both ways, using His Majesty* s Government when it is to his advantage and disregarding them when it suits him, and I think that the above communication may have a salutary effect.

Our reply is as follows:- Resident in the Persian Gulf for what he stated in his message, which comes of nothing but his well known friendship. And We are, as ?. r e have ever been, very grateful to Our friend, His Majesty's Government, for their kind favours and good wishes for the prosperity of Our State. We do not doubt their helpful attitude to assist and give all necessary facilities, whenever these are wished and repuired by ^s, as nas a,l?ays been their custom with Our predecessors and with Us in view of the close friendship existing since Treaties have been exchanged between them and Our Government. In the ie is hour We have received We thank Our friend the Hon 1 ble the Political 3./Il 3. You will probably remember that after Our return from Dhofar in February last V e received the letter addressed to Us by the Hon T ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in regard to the Coronation of His Majesty the King in London, In Our reply to him We mentioned that v . T e would visit London when the opportunity offered and would then see His Majesty the King and have the oleasure of His Majesty T s personal acquaintance and that that meeting would be a substitute for the meeting at the time of His Coronation, 4. You will also remember that while in Karachi some one and a half months ago at one of Our meetings a mention was made of Our visit to England in the course of a talk about Our visit to His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General for India in November next. We then asked you how long a period was necessary to notify His Majesty's Government when Tr e intended to proceed to England. You replied that We should notify them at least six months beforehand. There was no doubt that you. understood that We had the intention of going there, though you were not sure of it and did not know the time We intended to be in England. We ourselves were not sure about it and when it should be. So, We were not in a position to intimate it to you, but intended to inform you in good time when We maice Our determina tion, Hence Our question as stated above. There is no doubt that Our travels in Europe is not a matter of secrecy and that We have to inform you of it in good time, as We shall oass through your Possessions and shall request you to arrange the necessary facilities for Us when We are in your Countries. 5. as for Our writing a letter to Our friend the president of the U.S.A. and what We stated therein. It is a/8./ is a fa.ct l-nat 6 wrots a iG'ttGr to him on 'bb-6 occasion oi his assuming the office of the President of the U.S .A. for ir.ie second time, off erring him Our congratulations, Tnis T ve did in viev.. of the bonds of friendship existing between Us and that Government since a long time. We took this opportunity and mentioned to him what you stated in your letter: that Fe intended to travel in Europe and suggested that We might visit him in America to renew the bonds of friendship. This letter We wrote to him a fev days after We had written Our reply to the Political esident in the D ersian Gulf f s letter to which We have made a reference above. We thought When We decided to travel in Europe the distance from there to the U.S.A. would be short and We could visit it at the same time. We did not inform the Hon'ble the Political Resident of either of these projects, because, as We have already stated, ' e had not made Our decision. There is no doubt that We realize what are the ireaty helations that exist between Us and the British Government. We do not think that Our writing directly '■o resident of the TT ,S,A. would make a breach of the provisions of the Treaty, Further, as you are aware, there are Treaties between TT s and the Governments of the , .A, and France and We have to write to them directly on certain occasions when necessity calls for it. 7. As for previous communications on the subject of the increase of the Muscat Tariff. That was done as a result of special representations made by Oi^r Government and not by the Hon T ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, for that matter only. We recognize the pains taken by the British Government over this question and Our benefitting therefrom, which is due to their kind and benevolent attitude._ 4 ~ s- c^t) jfou stated that His ae. iesty T s Government wouid be grateful if i- r e 1 ould inform them through the non ? hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf of any communication We intended to senjto foreign ?ov- r ers. We thank you for these expressions. You are well avare that at present e have no treaty relations with any foreign Powers but the U.S.A. and France with whom Our Government have since time long ago been communi cating directly in accordance with the treaty relations existing between Us and them, e do not want to incon venience the British Government with any communications but those which ■ e consider ought to go through them. We are confident that the British Government would never agree that their officials should make such demands as neither Our predecessors nor Ourselves have been accus tomed to do, 9. There is no doubt that whenever ' e have matters on which We think His Majesty T s Government should be consulted, We shall not fail to do so. At present there are no important communications which We intend to make to any foreign power that We should according to the Hon ! ble the Political Resident ask His Majesty is Government to communicate with such Power on Our behalf. But should ^'e have any sue a communi cations in future and We consider that it is in Our interests to send them through His Majesty ! s GoveiD— ment We would be pleased to do so,, in vie'- tne advantages that this will give to Us. Otherwise ' e shall continue to act in accordance with the old pro cedure which is usual to Our Government, and shall not in the least inconvenience His Majesty's Government and their offic ials. 10. We are well aware, as stated by you, of all the common interests and. close relations e^.i^tin between/12^ &lt;:© between Us and His Majesty's Government, and We are always observant of and following the path of friend ship and affection that bind lis with His Majesty's Government, in accordance with the old conventions and even more. Moreover, We shall endeavour as far as possible to strengthen the bonds of friendship between Us and maintain the independence and interests of Our State, 11, Now We would inform you to convey the follow ing to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for communication to Our friend the British Govern ment : - God willingly and trusting in Almiijftty God, We intend to visit His Excellency the Viceroy at Delhi in the month of November next, as ' e have 3J4ready in formed you. This visit having been fulfilled, We shall proceed to Bombay in an unofficial capacity, thence \ e shall leave for the Far East to visit Our Lord and esteemed Father, which is 0 ur duty towards him (and We have already informed you of this x -. America being nearer from there We shall make Our way to it and visit His Excellency the President of the U.S.A.., having intimated in Our letter to him that We would visit him when We visited Europe. Our intention formerly was to visit Europe first end then America, but as we have now decided to visit Our Father in the Far East, and in view of the short distance from there to America, Our arrival in England will be via those routes. We do not Y/ant to return from the Far East to India and thence oroceed to Euro'oe, for this means d longer dis tance and We have not got the time for it, as We want to return ea.rly to Our State a.nd. Day attention to the many reforms of which it stands in need.7 - 12, Accordingly, Our arrival in London will, as We calculate, be in the middle of March 1938, when We shall be glad to mefet His Majesty the King and make the acquaintance of the Leading Men of His M ajesty^s Government. Our stay there will be for a short period according as His Majesty^ Government would advise, if they would be kind enough to do so. We shall then- return to Our State, passing through France and visit ing its President and some other European countries if opportunity offers and We consider it suitable at the time, This intimation is sent to you six and a half months before Our arrival in England, 15, We request you to enquire from His Majesty T s Government whether - e shall be their guest during Our stay in London, as was Our esteemed Father when he went for medical treatment. We would further request them kindly to arrange all necessary facilities for Us while We are in their Kingdom. We are no doubt causing His M ajesty T s Government and you a certain amount of in convenience by Our request for this. We are awaiting your reply regarding Our visit to England and other questions as detailed above. The object of these visits is to strengthen and reinforce the bonds of friendship and aifection and everything connected with the interests ox Oui Government.

I enclose for information a copy of^a letter from tne political Agent, Muscat, to tne sultan, and of His reply, P 3, It will be seen that, although tone of Sultan's letter is on the whole restrained, he resists advice that he should give information through Political Resident to His Majesty's Government of any communications which he proposes to make to foreign powers. He qualifies this attitude by statement tmt he has at present no important communications to make to any foreign power . 515 (though even here he proposes to consult His Majesty 's Government only in cases when he considers it to be in his own interests to do go). Effect is, moreover, considerably discounted by his obvious desire to be entertained by His Majesty 's Government and to have the honour of audience with His Majesty The King, (Signature) 4./ S. 44. MFP—1374 S&amp;P—(M-2043)—15-1-36—10,000. (Designation) ■ i r2 4. As regards communications to foreign powers I doubt whether any purpose will be served in attempting to press Sultan further except by means of friendly explanations for which opportunities will no doubt present themselves both during forth coming visit to Delhi and subsequently in iSngland# It may for instance be possible to convey verbally a hint somewhat in terms of final sentence of paragraph 3 of Bowie's telegram ITo # 650 of U U 1st July. h' 5. For the rest Sultan sets out an indefinite programme for a round-the-world journey, starting from India after visit to Delhi, via Japan and U .S.A. to London, and thence back tnrough France and possibly other European countries, only fixed date being arrival in London on March Ibth 1933. Date proposed for his departure is likely to be inconvenient in that negotiations will still be afoot for revision of Muscat Commercial Treaty at express request of Sultan himself* Projected tour will take him through Japan and America in depth of winter and bring him to England at inclement time of year# Visit to the U.S.A. may possibly lead to some embarrassment, if question of tariff revision is under discussion as a result of negotiations for revision of his treaty with His Majesty's Government. Finally owing to Sultans protracted recess in Dhofar we have tiad so little opportunity of maintaining touch with him tJ^at renewed absence at this juncture will certainly be ill-timed. Sultan is due to leave for Delhi on 7th November and, if He adheres to his programme, he will be unable to meet the Resident again until he returns from his world tour. 6« Subject however to Fowle T s views I feel that little is to be gained by placing these considerations before Sultan and, endeavouring to prevail on him to postpone his tour. ?e may hope that treaty negotiations will be well on way before visit to /7$ to Delhi, arid it would probably be preferable to use some of tliese arguments as means to induce Sultan to agree to continuation of present ?reaty until sucJi time aa new agreement can taice snape, I therefore recommend that Sultan be informed tnat his Majesty's u-overnment are glad to near of his projected visit ana will welcome him as State guest# His request to be received by His Majesty will no doubt receive consideration. 3ultan f s father was treated as State guest for one month when he visited Hlngland in 1928 and .vas received by His Majesty {aee correspoudence ending with your telegram JMo, 1664 of otn July 1928). There are also recent precedents of visits of 3nai.i£hs of Kuwai t and Bahrain, and it will no doubt be thought desirable to accord similar treatment to Sultan. as regards projected visits to France and other European countries, when the time comes, it may be possible, despite attitude taken in his letter, to suggest to lultan that His M? jesty's Government will be glad to communicate on his behalf with Governments concerned if he will inform tnem in more detail of his itinerary* sd# 0# X, Garoe Officiating Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf.

After consulting Fowle I agree with acting Resident that no useful purpose would be served in attempting to press the Sultan further. Approach has had the effect of acquainting the Sultan with our views ana it is to be hoped he will in fact consult us in advance on any important up matter which he proposes to take/with Foreign Powers e.g., revision of his existing treaties with the United States of America and France. Subject therefore to any observations which you may wish to offer I propose to let matter rest for the present* 2. As regards the Sultan*s visit to foreign t. ; - , 1* ' countries it appears that he is content to rely on his own powers to obtain facilities etc. and does not want any assistance from His Majesty 1 s Government. In the circumstan ces Fowle thinks that we should leave Sultan to his own -/ devices &amp; 11 ■ \\(g) devices and that we should not go out of our way to press our services on him, Fowle also suggested and I agree that the opportunity should be taken curing the Sultan 1 s visit to Delhi to make it clear to him that His Majesty* s Government understaxidthat he does not desire that they should approach any foreign government with a view to arranging facilities for him and that therefore they are taking no steps in the matter . He will o^course be given all appropriate facilities when he visits British territory but he should be advised to give timely and adequate information of such parts of his proposed tour . I would also propose to ask that His Majesty's representatives in foreign countries to be visited should be kept informed of bultan* s proposed movements so far as known in order that they may be prepared to give any assistance asked for, Secretary of btate for Inuiau C.V.A.s s 35/154 &lt;7 Telegram s q.

If King^ movements permit .His Majesty will be pleased to receive Sultan after his arrival. Palace authorities state that as far as it is possible to foresee there should be no difficulty in arranging audience during third week in March but that at this distance of time it is impossible for His Majesty to be definitely committed when his movements at that time of the year have not even been considered. /ftien the time approaches I will endeavour to arrange audience for a date as ^arly as convenient after Sultan's anticipated arrival. It is essential that the exact date of Sultan's arrival in England should be kno¥/n several weeks in advance for the purpose of arranging programme of entertainment. Presumably date depends on sailings from America. It would be of definite advantage if Sultan could be committed to a f ixed /s jt -2- ( €D fixed date before he leaves India. If that is impossible he should be asked to let Political A.D.G# to Secretary of State for India, India Office, know early in January at the latest precise date of arrival and also to inform him of any subsequent and unavoidable change of plans.

I should be glad to have your views on this suggestion. 3. A British officer (Mr. Bertram Thomas) was attached to the Sultan's father during the 1928 visit, and it see^s desirable that an officer should be appointed on ohe piesej.i.t occasion.

Assuming that consideration of the Sultan's proposals for revision of the 1891 Treaty will have proceeded sufficiently far, his presence and entertainment in this country might give a good opportunity, if this is agreeable to the Sultan, for making further progress with the question 'by at any rate informal discussions with him. Atmosphere might be favourable for this and it might moreover save time in view of the delays inevitably involved in dealing by telegraph with aspects of the negotiations in which other Departments of His Majesty's Government are concerned. For the purpose of such discussions or conversations, however, it would of course be desirable that we should have available here a political officer competent to conduct them, who might be either the oixicer attached to the Sultan for his visit or an oiiicer deputed for the purpose of such treaty discussions.

As it will probably be necessary to submit a similar memorandum in connection v/ith the forthcoming visit we should be grateful if you would have the enclosed memorandum brought up to date. The Government Hospitality Fund have booked accommodation for the Sultan and his party at the Dorchester Hotel and we have been asked to find out whether His Highness would like a member of his suite to occupy a bedroom next to his own, and if so, which member.

(a) The Sultanate of Muscat and Oman. (b) Kis Highness The Sultan Saiyid Taimur Bin Faisal 'bin Turki, TSrLitli'QxtY. Oman in its geographical sense represents the South Eastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula from Abu Dhabi in the Korth to the borders of Kadhramaut. Politically speaking, the Sultanate consists of the littoral extending from xias Mu sand am at the entrance of the Persian Gulf along the East and South coasts to Has Fartak in Central South Arabia,a coast line of 1 ,100 miles, together with the overseas possession of Gwadar, an important Mekran port which handles the trade of much of Southern British Baluchistan and South Eastern Persia, and is situated on the Imperial Air Route to India. Zanzibar, once attached to the Sultanate of Oman, but now a British Protectorate, still pays a nominal tribute to the Muscat Treasury, and the Zanzibar Ruling Family is a collateral branch of the A1 Sa 1 id Dynastic family of Oman, whose head is the Sultan. HISTORICAL . This maritime Arab State is believed by some to have been the original home of the Phoenicians. its sailors carried the trade between Babylonia and India, and its seas were the cradle of navigation. Oman figures before the rise of Islaa aa an appanage of Persia, and in turn fell into the hands of the Abhaside Caliphs of Baghdad, but from the Kiddle Ages onwards secured independence under its own native rulers. The present dynasty rose in 1741. Hapoleon, to further his Indian designs, regarded the Sultanate as of such importance as to seek an alliance, but the period of greatest prosperity came fifty years later under the Sultan Saiyid Sa'id, the great grandfather of the present Sultan, who was perhaps one of the greatest Arab figures to appear since the Arab prophet. He extended his , oKcsorbin * Bahrain and Bushire and influence northwards, abborDin 0 asserting/&lt;■/&gt; 2. asserting his mastery of the entire Persian Gulf, finally reaching Basrah, where he conducted a naval expedition. He invaded and colonised /uanzibar and the adjacent East African territory. He presented a irigate to our Royal JMavy and received another, the 'Prince Regent 1 in return. The Sultanate has since then diminished gradually in importance. Internal disaffection and rebellion have restricted the authority of the Sultan to the coastal districts. British policy has throughout this later period been chiefly concerned with suppressing (a) the Slave Trade and (b) the Arms Traffic. Both had their centre in Muscat, which derived from them great wealth. Muscat was the slave market for South East Arabia and the Armoury for European arms destined to be smuggled across the Persian Gulf for Afghanistan, Baluchistan and the North West Frontier. Both have disappeared largely through the activities of the Royal Navy and the collaboration of the Sultan under Treaty obligations. PiiYdIGa ^ j ^ EATURE ^ . The dominant physical features of Oman are (1) a lofty range of mountains running almost parallel with the coast, the great backbone of the country rising to a height of 10,000 feet in Jebel Akdhar, (IIj a coastal plain distinguished for a date grove one hundred and fifty miles long and from three to seven miles in depth, (IHj beyond the mountains, the immense unpenetrated spaces of Ruba al Khali, which have hitherto baffled explorers. The deep waters off the Oman coasts render navigation simple, and Muscat is a safe harbour as well as being a very beautiful one. CLI^TB . Encircled by precipitous volcanic cliffs, its summer climate is intensely hot and there is scarcely any difference between day and night temperature. It was of Muscat that the , | j vior*p the oanting sinner receives a Persian poet wrote '.a-nd here, i-ne pauv. 0 „ The average rainfall varies foretaste of his future destiny . me a. 6 between three and six inches. p OP u ju a T I O jn /n ■f 3 / ^ o ♦ i ^ POPUL a TIQ im . The total population ox Oman has been estimated at 500,000, representing perhaps 15^ of the entire population of the Arabian peninsula: 80^ of these are tribal Arabs, there is a considerable pure negro element generally in domestic service, and a less numerous foreign trading element which consists of British Indians, Persians and Baluchis, There is, however, a large admixture of African blood in uhe population at large, as also in the Ruling Family. PRODUCTS a I^- u Ti-vAiJi^ . The overseas trade is largely with Bombay, Aden and Zanzibar, though America takes a considerable portion of Oman's date crop for her own black population. The fisheries, chiefly shark for export to the iar iiiast, are of second importance to the date industry. The camels of Oman are famous throughout Arabia, but the country is too thirsty to allow the horse to flourish and very few are bred. Indigo dyeing, copper and brass work and cloth weaving are among other industries, and there is a crude but characteristic variety of gold and silver work, especially used for sheaths and mountings of daggers and swords. tyaiUIOfl. The State religion is the Ibadhi sect of Islam, which is elsewhere found in Morocco. Fiercely intolerant of other creeds, Oman has been traditionally hostile to foreign penetration, and the Sultan himself, disapproved of for his infidel associations, has himself never deemed it expedient to visit the interior mountains. The tenets of Xbadhism, in their puritanical narrowness, resemble the Wahabism of Central Arabia. GCWTCHiWP.M'J . The Government of the oul tanate ib patriarchal • j a Kir wpcstern bureaucratic standards is without feudal, and judged oy western niencv but it admirably suits the conditions much system or efficiency, • At one time a theocracy, the and needs of the mhabita n • • f .rations have been dropped by later Sultans in favour religious functions nctvc of an elected Imam. (hj/4, ■ (bj His Kighness ihe Sultan Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal bin Turki K.C.I.iU., C.S.l! l 1 he Sultan succeeded his father in 1913 v/hen he was 27 years old, so that his age is now 42 and he has been rulins'for 15 years. In appearance he is bulky, of middle height and distinguished looking. Slow of speech, he is regarded by Europeans as possessing Arab charm and dignity, as a young man he passed through a phase of 'religious bigotry 1 . But he has long since outgrown it. a sign of this is his fondness for smoking which practice is anathema to the strict Ibadhi. he, however, remained a good Muslim in that he is a teetotaler, he is popular with his subjects; is not politically minded outside the boundaries of his own State: is proud of and loyal to his British alliance and was awarded the K.G.I.E. in 1926. he has three sons, the eldest of whom Saiyid Sa'id, is being educated at an Arab School in Baghdad. 'The Sultan has suffered in health for many years and will undergo an operation for appendicitis in England. His long absences from iviuscat on this account led him some jears ago to wish to abdicate in favour of his eldest son - a course he was dissuaded from taking by our counsels. He has paid many visits to India where, at Dehra Dun, he possesses a bungalow, but spends most of his time at Phofar in South Arabia (y/hither he is given passage in one of H.m . shipsj - to his Grown Estates. Ihere he has a residence and some shooting. His chiet interest is 'shikar 1 of the kind that the desert provides, gazelle, antelope, and an occasional panther. Hut he a lover o± sport and open air life generally and in spite of his health, last year under bo jk a 300 mile camel journey northwards from Muscat through his country, iie has made a fine collection of Arao oooks, out his scholarship is limited and he knows little of any language buu his own. As an Arab chief he is of necessity a poor man as compared with certain of the Indian Huling mnoes, ni3 axinuoj. w fi-nmrntinp* to £100,000, but the historic State revenues scarcely amounting - ' importance/9i 5. importance attaciiing to his office is su^^ested by his salute of 21 guns, Sultanate is not a British Protectorate. In law it has sovereign status. Besides its Treaty relations with H.M.G. it has Treaty relations wii:h France and America. Before the Great War these Powers had Consuls stationed at Muscat, and France still communicates directly with the Sultan, as does the League of Nations. In practice, however, British influence in the State is paramount.35/164 v Telegram G«T^G» From Secretary of State for India, London* To Political Resident^ Buahire.

(5) Madame Tussaud'a (6) Ice Hockey# (7) Theatres (preferably Ballet or musical comedy). (8) Cinema (if possible to see a news film featuring himself)« (9) Coliseum or Palladium ^non-stop variety 4 . The genBral idea might be to fill in His Highness^ afternoons and evenings with entertainments etc. while keeping tne mornings for aiscussions on the treaty (see paragrapn b below)• 3, I am entirely in favour of the s ingestion tnat His Highness might broadcast a talk in Arabic. Possibly ne mignt give his impressions of wimt he had seen in England during his visit. 4. Paragraph 3 of India Office letter. Attacnment of British Officer. Since His Highness knows Englisn tne task of his temporary A.B.G. will be rendered somewnat easier, thoygn it would be an advantage for this officer to Know Arabic, I suggest that either ^ajor Watts, or Colonel Daly - wno is relieving Msg or Watts at Muscat « would be suitable. Whicn of these two would be available would depend on the date tnat Colonel Daly leaves England. Failing either of these Mr.Bertram Thomas wcu Id be suitable, or Colonel JLoch, or pernaps some other Department, e.g® tne Colonial OfzS ce, could provide s cane suitable officer. /0V { | £&gt; J/ ^ -A'- 5, (1) Para^rapn 4 of India Ofrice letter.

With Arab Rulers (as with other people) tnere is a psychological moment for approacning tnem, and I imagine tnat tne Sultan when in London should fee in a receptive mood# He will be the guest of Government, ne will 1 una erst and Oe received in audience by His Majesty, and ne may receive the honour of a K.O.I,2. It might toe possible tnerefore to arrange during his visit an agreed draft of tne new Treaty as between him and His Miajesty^s Government, leaving to a later date the 1'oraalit ies connected witn tne confirmation of tne Treaty by tne Dominions. (2) The Sultan nimseif is anxious to conclude the new Treaty as soon as possible, and I expect would welcome a discussion in Xiondon. I suggest, nowever, tnat trie proposal for this discussion might be made to him through tne Ambassador, Washington, ^d nis reaction reported. The message to His Highness might indicate tne informal nature of thf discussions and pernaps be linked witn tne proposal wnich i£ nimself has made tnat the Political Agreement witn Petroleum Concessions Limited might be discussed during his visit to ^ondorj, (vide „ tjr \\7- h'tt'i my Express letter 865-3 of tne 20th December 1937),? In this connection see also correspondence ending #ith mj express letter *6*0/18 of the lath January x938. (3) There would seem to be obvious advantages in tne India Office suggestion tnat a Political Officer snoold be aval lable /(6} available to take part In the discussions. Such an officer might be (a) Major Watts or Colonel Daly or (b) myself on deputation. The advantage of ( q .) would be that one of these officers would be available in England. The advantage of ( b) would be that telegraphic references to ma would be obviated, and I suppose tnat as Resident I would carry more weight v is^a-vig the Sultan than a Political Agent.

WITH reference to your despatch No. 556 of the 15th November last, I have the honour to report that His Highness Saiyid Said-bin-Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman, left Yokohama on the 27th January for San Francisco by the steamship Tatsuta Maru, thus concluding his stay of five weeks in this country. 2. His Highness arrived at Kobe on the 23rd December by the steamship Hakone Maru from Hong Kong, and stayed at an hotel there. He was accom panied by his brother, Saiyid Tariq-bin-Taimur, by two secretaries, Helal-bin- Bader and Saiyid Abdulmunim Zawawi, by an official. Khan Bahadur Ahmad Shubaily, and by two negro servants. The main purpose of his visit was to see his father, Saiyid Taimur, who, having abdicated in 1932, has for the last two years been living in Kobe with a Japanese wife. The announcement of the Sultan's arrival appeared in the J apanese, although not in the foreign, press, and through out his stay in Kobe His Highness was constantly troubled by J apanese reporters, although he refused to grant any interviews. 3. I instructed His Majesty's consul at Kobe to call on His Highness and to inform him that I desired to take an early opportunity of welcoming him to Tokyo, and that I hoped to arrange a dinner in his honour. I also asked Mr. Ovens to make discreet enquiries as to whether His Highness would like to stay at e Embassy when he came to Tokyo. . o 14. 4. On the 31st December Mr. Ovens called by appointment on the buitan, who received him most courteously and appeared to be gratified by the solicitude shown on his behalf. He looked forward to visiting the Embassy but hoped .hat any entertainment which was arranged in his honour would be o a pma e nature, since he was anxious to maintain the strictest mcogm o w i e m As regards staying at the Embassy, he had already decided to s ay a an o Tokyo in view of his desire for as much freedom of movement and as much privacy as possible. Mr. Ovens reported that the Sultan had been very papermen, and that the impression which he and his suite a oim country up till then had not been an entirely happy one. \ ^ a TnVvn 5. After a short visit to Kyoto, the Sultan and his party arrived in To y on the 10th January, where they were met at the station y a me ^ ^ ^' who conveyed my greetings to His Highness. Fears for e P • i ^ Sultan's incognito however-to a very large extent these deteimined all the party's movements—led to a sudden change m their P ar ^' i staved night in Tokyo they left hurriedly for an hote m Yokohama ^ until they left Japan, and where they successfully concealed their identity, at least ^^^ThrSuitan eventually accepted my invitation an n f p ^ the Embassy on the 18th January, the guests consib mg s y staff and their wives. . , • „ ^ f v.o r&gt;ipf whioh was 7. As he had expressed a desire to attend a sess . , together with then sitting, two members of the staff accompanied His Highness togetner wit Mr. Zawawi and Mr. Bader to * — 8. On the following day, colleague having been concerned in making the steamship Tatsuta Maru. His father was m p y 5 he will soon return to Kobe. [230 ee— 2]in Th P immersions which the Sultan and his party formed of Japan were far from fav3le Reference has already been made to the unwelcome attention tai trom xa\ouia • , , reD orters in Kobe, who on more than one occasion I Si'-r t 1 - - ita ■ ta, f r «. and in Kyoto were as mrportunate as usual. As is the case with most tourists their contacts with the Japanese were almost confined to their dealings w.tb ouTdes hotel employees, taxi-drivers, shop assistants, curio dealers and others of fhat nredatorv class which may account for the low opinion they formed of Japanese intelligence and efficiency. While the party were in Tokyo a member of my Staff accompanied them at their invitation to a Japanese wrestling tournament, tfie classical Japanese drama and on a motor-car tour of the sights. On the whole hey appeared to derive little pleasure from their visit to Japan and to find the time hanging heavy on their hands. So far. His Highness confided, Japan had proved to be the least interesting stage of his tour round the world. 11 It is unlikely that anv discussion took place between the bultan and Japanese officials. When I suggested that he might like to meet some Japanese officials at the luncheon-party, he recoiled from the idea as if nothing could have been more distasteful. In the course of a conversation with a member of my staff, he stated that Muscat was not in treaty relations with Japan, that there had been no talk of opening relations, and that it was unlikely that relations would be opened in the future. If any discussions did, in fact, take place during the Sultan's stay in Japan, the fact was concealed with considerable skill and a deliberate attempt made to suggest the contrary , , ^ , 12 I was impressed by the friendly attitude ot the feultan when he caine'to the Embassy, and his manner towards the British officials with whom he came into contact was consistently affable. He appeared to desire to keep on good terms with us, expressed to me several times the warm feelings which he had towards the British, and seemed to appreciate the little which we were able to do for him.

The Sultan travelled from New York in the s.s. 'Queen Mary' which reached Southampton on 28th March. 2. He was welcomed at Southampton 'by Major E.IT.3. Cranks haw, Secretary of the Government Hospitality Fund, (on 'behalf of the Minister in Charge of Government Hospitality) and at Waterloo by Lord Stanley, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State (on 'behalf of His Majesty's Government), Sir Trenchard Powle# Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, representatives of the India Office, Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry, and 'by Colonel Dalyell of the Binns, who had kindly consented to come to London to look after the Sultan during the official visit. 3* During the period of official hospitality the Sultan and his suite were accommodated at the Dorchester no tel. !{-• Although the Sultan wore European clothes on arrival ne wore his national costume for the remainder of the o.. - ici^l visit and it is understood that he preferred to ao so. 5* Press arrangements were hancileci 'by the iniormauion O-^icer at the India Office. Copy is attached or a stauement regarding the Sultan and his country which was issued on the eve of the Sultan's arrival. On the eve of His Highness's departure at the conclusion of the official visit no issued a statement (which was released through the India Ox^ice) in the following terms:- 'On the eve of my departure from England at the end of my visit as the guest of His Britannic ^ajesoy s Government I am anxious to give expression to i.iy bc.nse of gratitude for the kindness and hospitality extended to me in so generous a measure hy His Majesty's Government, 'by official and non -official organisations and/p- ■ \&lt;^ 2. and 'by private individuals. I am indeed appreciative of the cordial welcome I have received. No effort has 'been spared to make every moment of my visit interesting and enjoyable, and I shall always preserve the happiest recollections of a country with which I and ray people are linked in true friendship.' 6. Partly owing to the elaborate programme of entertainment which was arranged for the Sultan during his visit to America the official programme of entertainment in this country was somewhat more elaborate than is usual in the case of visits of this nature, and special efforts were made by Major Crankshaw to ensure the success of the arrangements made. There is not the slightest doubt that the Sultan enjoyed himself immensely and that the visit was an unqualified success. At all times the Sultan expressed himself as interested in what he was shown and appreciative of what was done i.or ^j.m. As in the case of similar items in the programme ox xixs oftici^l visit to Delhi last November, the two events most appreciated by the Sultan were the trips by air over London and uhc vioit to the Agricultural College at Cambridge. If anyuAin,- u^e programme was too full and on any future similar occasxon it might be a good thing to leave a little more uime io* leisure and private affairs. It la true that Oxi this occasion certain mornings and afternoons were lext free for the purpose of official discussions with the Sultan. His Highness, so far from resenting tiis encroacnment on ulie short period of his visit which was not fillea witn official entertainments, welcomed the opportunity xor tcilks o^ official matters and was most anxious to complete the I'reaty discussions, so far as possible, during Sir T. Powle's presence in London* The Sultan did not seem particularly interested m things/1 &lt; 3. things mechanical; 'but he liked scenery, trees, flowers etc, and on the occasion of any future visit it might 'be a good taing to show him more of the country. During the period of official entertainment His Highness refused all 'private' invitations except that of Lord Cadman. The proposed visits to Broadcasting House and to the de Havilland Aircraft Factory were cancelled at the Sultan's request. His Highness declined the invitation to ma''e a short 'broadcast in Arabic hut did not give his reasons for doing so. The visits to the Tower of London and to Windsor Castle were arranged at the Sultan's request. The informal dinner on the '7th April at which bir Lancelot Oliphant acted as host was arranged in order to give the Sultan an opportunity of meeting representatives of certain foreign missions i.e. Saudi- Arabian; Iraqi; Egyptian and French. ?. A copy of the speech delivered hy the Sultan at the Government dinner on 21th March is attached. 8. A list of guests who accepted invitations to attend the Reception held 'by the Sultan at Dorchester Hotel on 8th April is also attached. 9. The Sultan was greatly Interested in the news films of himself taken during his visit. Copies of tne films (specially reduced to fit his cine -camera) were purchased hy the Government Hospitality Fund and presented to His aighnes 10. The Sultan was granted an interview hy lord Kalitax, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, on 11th April. 11. Eai Sahib Dulichand, the Sultan 's Accountant-General, arrived in England at the end of March and remamea throughout/^3 ( 4. throughout the visit. He stayed at a different Hotel and at the Sultan 's request he was not included in the official party. 12. 'The Bui tan left England for France at the end of trie official visit on the evening of 12th April end at his request his departure was kept as quiet as possible. So anxious was His Highness to prevent his identity from being discovered in France that the waole party travelled under assumed names. He was seen off 'by 6ir Trenchard I'owle, Major Gran^sha^ and a representative of the India Office. 13. The Sultan returned to England 'by air, (in a purely private capacity) on 19th April and, using the name of ir.Ozdi, occupied a suite of rooms at Queen Anne's Kaneions. he was. accompanied by Mr. Dulichand and one servant only, the remainder of his suite remaining in Paris. It is understood tnat his highness preferred the privacy of Queen Anne's Mansions; and on tne occasion of any similar official visit in the future it might he better to engage accommodation at that place in preference to an Hotel. His Highness ended his private visit on 1st May and was seen off at Croydon Air port hy Major Crankshaw and a representative of the India Office. During this private visit most of the day-time was occupied in official talks connected with the revision of the Muscat Treaty etc., and with shopping excursions. His Highness accepted invitations to ts-.e tea with Lady Willingdon and Lady Linlithgow hut otherwise refus accept any 'private,' invitations of importance. During this period the Sultan gave the impression that he was enjoying the novelty of being separated from his suite - he stated that this was the first time he had been alone . ■, , 4. -fhot bp would have liked was 14 years old - and it is tnough • ^. ivit as he had made arrangements to remain for a longer period, to return to Muscat in July this was not possible. jgd. ) A.

Politically speaking, the Sultanate consists of the littoral extending from lias Musandam at the entrance of the Persian Gulf along the East and South coasts to Has Partak in Central South Arabia, a coast line of 1,100 miles, tuget- x ' ltl1 overseas possession of Gwadur, an important mKrsn - js . which x r&lt; nr ,fhprn British Baluenistcui handles the trade of much o.- oou.-^xn . t a « r--? + n ^t pr! on the iiiiperi ^l and South Eastern Persia, ana io o Air Route to India. HISTORICAL This maritime Arab State Is believea oy oane been the original home of the Phoenicians. Its sailors carriecv0J§^ carried the trade between Babylonia and India, and its seas were the cradle of navigation. Oman figures before the rise 0 f islam as an appanage of Persia, and in turn fell into the hands of the Abbasid Caliphs of Baghdad, but from the Middle Acres onwards secured independence under its own native rulers. The present dynasty rose in 1741. Napoleon, to further his Indian designs, regarded the Sultanate as of such importance as to seek an alliance, but the period of greatest prosperity came seventy years later under the Sultan Saiyid Sa 1 id, the great great granaiatner ox une present Sultan. He ruled from 1307 to 1356 and was perhaps one of the greatest Arab figures to appear since the Arab prophet. He extended his influence northwards and asserted his mastery over the entire Persian Cru.u-. colonised Zanzibar and the adjacent East African territory. He presented a frigate to our Royal handsome yacht, the 'Prince, Regent', in return. Sultanate has since then diminished gradually in importance, largely as a result of the influence on Muscat trade of the development of steam navigation and tne openj.ng of the - Canal.

Lord Zetland, my Lords and Gentlemen^ I should like to tiiank Your Lordship for the kind words in which you have proposed my health, .and you, Gentlemen, for honouring the Toast in this way. And I should like to say how much I appreciate the welcome that I have received. As you know, the Sultans of Muscat and 'Oman have 'been in 1; treaty relations with the British Government for more than a century, and I welcome this opportunity of visiting Great Britain. I hope tomorrow to have the great pleasure of seeing His Majesty King George and to enter into a personal friendship which I trust will endure. As I said, the Governments of Great Britain and 'Oman have 'been long in treaty relations, but I would claim more than treaty relations, relations of true friendship and real understanding. Your Lordship has referred to certain help which I have been able to give and I should like to assure you that I am very glad to have been of assistance to H.M's Government, . And I on my side am deeply appreciative of the nelp and assistance extended by His Majesty's Government from time to time to the Sultans of Muscat and 'Oman which the baudi dynasty will not forget. I hope that these happy relations will be furtner strengthened by the personal friendship which I now have the privilege of forming with you all. I have greatly enjoyed my journey and am sure that I shall e nooy my stay in this country. I do not think that you will wish for a long speecn and I will close with renewed thanks and wish you all good health and happiness.Si]List of acceptances for Sultan' Reception. 8.L1..38.

Lebrun on the day before his departure, the Jul tan preserved the strictest incognito; and he appeared to shun any official contact with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Indeed, as late as May 5th, the Ministry were still without news of his arrival in France, a fact which caused them some anxiety, as trie visit had originally been announced by the French Ambassador In London as being due to begin as early as April 12th. 4, M. Corbin had also reported that the Sultan's representative/ The Right Honourable r. ^ t r p t f The Viscount Halifax, K. G. , G. C .b. I. , etc,, etc., etc#representative had Informed the French Embass/ in London that His Highness was exhausted by the receptions and 'banquets offered in his honour in the United Kingdom and by the numerous visits which he had made to museums in that country; and that he therefore intended to devote his time in aris to pleasures of a ore private nature. ^Tn the event, the only activity of the Bultan of waich the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would appear to have any knowledge, apart from His Highness* s call at the Elysee, was a visit wnich he paid to Pontainetoleau in a motor-car placed at his disposal by the Ministry. 5. The Paris Press of May 13th chronicled the Sultan's visit to M. Lebrun, and on the same day the Petit Parisien' contained a short paragraph recording the cordial relations obtaining between Prance and the Sultanate since the signature of the Convention of Commerce and Friendsnip in 1844. Apart from this, however, no interest at all appears to have been taken by the Press in the Sultan's visit to this country. I have, etc., Sgd.

Details of the entertainment of the Sultan are not available on our files but the detailed programme of the Shaikh of Banrain's visit in 1956 furnishes a precedent. 3.

The Sultan of Muscat had arranged a world tour including visits to Japan, United States of America and Europe without consulting British officials. As the Sultan was 'an independent sovereign in treaty relations with, but not under the protection of His Majesty's Government' there was no basis for the British to take exception to visits by the Sultan to other countries. The Sultan was accompanied by Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur [Tāriq bin Taymūr], his brother; Halal bin Badr, Secretary; Khan Bahadur Ahmad Shubaily, State Official; Saiyid Abdulmunim Zawawi, Aide De Camp; two servants. The volume includes the itinerary for the Sultan's visit to England; a memorandum prepared in 1928 on the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman and the Sultan, Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal [Taymūr bin Fayṣal]; a report on the Sultan's visit to England; a letter from Neville Henderson, noting that the Sultan did not actually make a proposed visit to Germany.Correspondents include the Secretary of State for India; Sir Trenchard Fowle, Political Resident Persian Gulf; Major Ralph Ponsonby Watts, Political Agent Muscat; Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat; Lacy Baggallay, Foreign Office, London.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Royal visits</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001b4#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
