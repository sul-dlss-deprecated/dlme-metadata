Dear Cole, Regarding the question of prisoners: I am very short of police at present owing to the various duties which they have to carry out and also because there have been • some casualties during the summer. I will send one more prisoner with the four who go to the Agency which will not necessitate an extra policeman. According to our regulations one police man is not allowed to take charge of more than five prisoners working outside. I will arrange for the prisoners who come to this office to go on to you every morning. Yours sincerely, Captain G. A. Cole, I.A., Officiating Political Agent, Bahrain. /CK1 © A.P.A. T n accordance with your instructions, I made the prisoners sweep the Tennis Court. Now it requires to be rolled. Four prisoners are not sufficient to sweep, carry water, go to yaur house and also do the rolling. Submitted for orders as to whether you like to ask the Adviser to send us more prisoners to roll the Tennis Court* * S&gt; * 27.1.37 t f t 4J ead Farrash. r u ,V b \ yu,—/ c No. -k£HH Of 1362 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, Ramadhan 27, 1362 September 27, 1943.

Presumably now tliat the month of ^teunadhan is over the Courts are functioning again, and the flow of short term prisoners has been resumed. I hope you will be able to see your way by making use of less hardened criminals to continuing a Custom and privilege which lias been in existence for nany years. C.D.^elgrave Bsq., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain./ d.o.no.^6&lt;T G V &gt;' - %.-^7 /&lt;•«&lt;&gt; /&gt; Adviser at o, November 13, 1943 /luy I musi, Apologise for not having replied to your D.0.No.2&lt;£58-6/3 dated 7th October 1943 before now. Apart from prisoners in the Police Station, awaiting trial, who are frequently numerous, we are having from 6-12 prisoners at the Fort -which always includes old men and persons physically unfit. Some of these go daily to hospital and there are usually one or two inpatients. Those who can work are employed on sanitary duties at the Fort aid. on cleaning the lines. On occasions lately there have not been enough prisoners to do these duties. The Bahrain Courts have been instructed to avoid giving sentences of imprisonment whenever possible. ^ It has been found that since living conditions here became difficult many pauper offenders are in fact glad to be sentenced to confinement in the Fort where they are well and expensively fed and do not have to work hard. In case where the offenders are young men and youths the Bahrain Courts are sentencing them to strokes with a cane otherwise, whenever possible, fines are ordered. Any able bodied offenders who are sentenced to one month R.I. or more are sent to the Fail in Jida which although salubrious is not popular. There they work on stone cutting, building a pier at Budeya and comp leting the new jail premises. It is for this reason that the supply of convicted prisoners is at present insufficient for supplying working parties to the Agency, or to the Ad vis er ate but as soon as there are sufficient short term convicts the practice will be resumed.
