Much of this correspondence is between Charles Belgrave, Adviser to the Government of Bahrain and the Political Agency in Bahrain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Public Works Department, Superintendent, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00010b#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00010b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
