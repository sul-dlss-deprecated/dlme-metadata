REVENUE DUTIES— In the case of persons dying between 1st August, 1894, and 19th April, igoy^the rates were :— Exceeds per cent. £ £ £ $• 150,000 and does not exceed 250,000 6 10 250,000 ,, ,, 500,000 7 o 500,000 ,, ,, 1,000,000 7 10 1,000,000 .. .. .. ..80 The above general rule for aggregation is subject to certain qualifications. The prin cipal qualifying provision is as follows :— Where settled property passes on the death of a person dying on or after 19th April, 1907, under a disposition made by a person dying before 2nd August, 1894, and such property would, if the disponer had died on or after 2nd August, 1894, have been liable to Estate Duty upon his death, it is not to be aggregated with other property, but is to be treated as an “ estate by itself.” Note .—Under the Act (63 Viet., c. 7) in force immediately prior to the Finance Act, 1907, such property would have been liable to aggregation with other property so as to enhance the rate of duty payable, where the value of the estate required it, to the limited extent of one half per cent. In addition to the above, where property liable to Estate Duty is settled by the will of the deceased, or having been settled by some other disposition, passes under that disposition, on the death of the deceased, to some person not com petent to dispose thereof, a further duty —called Settlement Estate Duty—is pay able at the rate of £1 per cent, on the settled property, but from that payment the ad val. Stamp Duty (if any) charged on the settlement may be deducted. Small Estates —(i.) If the net value of the property, real and personal, passing on the deceased’s death (exclusive of property settled by any prior disposition) does not exceed £1,000, such property is exempt from Settlement Estate Duty, and from Legac} 7 or Succession Duties, (ii.) And where the gross value of the unset tled property passing on the deceased’s death does not exceed ^300 or ^500 respectively, and a grant of probate or administration is taken out in a certain special manner, a fixed Duty of 30/- or 50/- is payable, and such estate is exempt from all other Death Duties. With respect to Personal Estate, interest at 3 per cent, per annum, without deduction for Income Tax, is also pay able on the Estate Duty from the date of the death up to the date of the delivery of the affidavit. The Estate Duty on real property may be paid, if desired, by eight yearly or six teen half-yearly instalments, the first at the expiration of 12 months from the death, with interest at 3 per cent, per annum from the last-mentioned date on the duty for the time being unpaid.

The Husband or Wife of the Deceased is not chargeable with Duty. A Legatee, whose Husband or Wife is of nearer Relationship to the Deceased, is chargeable with Duty at the rate at which such Husband or Wife would be chargeable. Relations of the Husband or Wife of the Deceased are chargeable with Duty at ^10 per cent, unless themselves related in Blood to the Deceased. Appraisements or Valuations of any Property made for the purpose of ascertaining the Legacy Duty payable in re spect thereof are exempt from Stamp Duty. Rates of Duty payable on Successions to Real and Personal Property, Charges on Real Property, and Money from the Sale of Real Property :—Lineal Issue or Lineal Ancestor of the Predecessor,t 10s. per cent.; Brothers and Sisters of the Prede cessor, or their Descendants, £4 10s. per cent.; Brothers and Sisters of the Father or Mother of the Predecessor, or their De scendants, £6 10s. per cent.; Brothers and Sisters of a Grandfather or Grandmother of the Predecessor, or their Descendants, £7 10s. per cent.; Persons of more remote Consanguinity or Strangers in Blood, £ii 10s. per cent. The Husband or Wife of the Predecessor is not charge able with Duty; and a Successor whose Husband or Wife is of nearer Rela- tionship to the Predecesso r is chargeable * Persons otherwise chargeable with Duty at the rate of one per cent, are exempt in respect of any Legacy, Residue, or Share of Residue, pay able out of, or consisting of, any Estate or Effects upon the value thereof Duty shall have been paid on the Affidavit or Inventory, in conformity with the Act 44 Viet., c. 12, or in respect of any property taken by them under a title under which Estate Duty ts payable. t Per Section 2 of the Succession Duty Act, 1853, the term “Predecessor” denotes the ‘ Settlor, Disponer, Testator, Obligor, Ancestor or other person from whom the interest of the Successor is or shall be derived.” 8 REVENUE DUTIES — contd. with Duty at the rate at which such Husband or Wife would be chargeable. The Relations of the Husband or Wife of the Predecessor are chargeable with Duty as Strangers, unless themselves related in Blood to the Predecessor. If the property which is the subject of the succession is chargeable with Estate Duty, the rates for Legacy and Succession Duty are identical. Moreover, where the Successor is lineal issue or ancestor (or husband or wife of lineal issue or ancestor) of the predecessor, the payment of Estate Duty under the title under which the Succession is derived wholly relieves such Succession from Succession Duty.

Entries start at 1 January and end at 24 December (some dates in between these dates do not have any entries). The entries are usually brief (although entries for some dates run over into the space for the entry for the next date).There are brief references to the weather and what Hirtzel did on particular days, such as his attendance at church services, but Hirtzel’s diary entries largely concern John Morley (Viscount Morley of Blackburn, Secretary of State for India, referred to as ‘J.M.’ throughout).The entries mostly record the following:The views and opinions expressed by Morley on India and India Office business, including the Indian Councils Act of 1909 (entries including: 12 February, folio 22 recto; 25 March, folio 28 recto; and 27 and 28 July, folio 45 verso), and possible candidates to be the next Viceroy of India (30 March, folio 28 verso; 9 May, folio 35 recto; and 21 July, folios 44 verso to 45 recto).The views and opinions expressed by Morley on various individuals.Meetings between Morley and various individuals, including King Edward VII (10 January, folio 17; 5 February, folio 21 recto; and 21 July, folio 44 verso to 45 recto), and the Prime Minister Herbert Henry Asquith (3 February, folio 20 verso).Cabinet and meetings and other events attended by Morley.Morley’s health.Before the entry for 1 January on folio 16 recto, there are five lines in German, including an (inaccurate) quotation of the second verse of
                           O Gott, du frommer Gottby Johann Heermann.The volume itself is a
