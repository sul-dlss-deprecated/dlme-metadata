It includes a detailed account of the treaty negotiations, 1913-1915, between Bin Saud and Sir Percy Cox, the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, as well as the drafts and final text of the friendship treaty between the British Government and Ibn Saud, as signed on 26 December 1915 and ratified on 18 July 1916.There is one item of correspondence in French dated November 1930. It is a letter of enquiry to the Foreign Office, from the French Ambassador to London, regarding French treaty negotiations with Ibn Saud and the latter's demand for assistance in obtaining a renewal of the supply of revenues from the Haramain Waqfs, which are Muslim endowments for the upkeep and improvement of religious shrines in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100076636912.0x000002#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100076636912.0x000002#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100076636912.0x000002#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
