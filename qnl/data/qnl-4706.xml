In order to avoid having to cancel the order (and pay a large cancellation fee) the Residency requests that the Political Agent make enquiries in Bahrain and elsewhere in the Gulf, in the hope of finding a buyer for the equipment, which was intended for the consulates at Bunder Abbas [Bandar-e ʻAbbās] and Bushire but is now no longer required. The file contains the Political Agent's correspondence with the following: the Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain; the Residency Agent, Sharjah; the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain; the Manager of Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd; the Secretary to the Ruler of Qatar, Salih Al-Mani' [Ṣāliḥ Āl Māni‘].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Qatar, Secretary to</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bushire</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Electricity supply</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00016d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00016d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
