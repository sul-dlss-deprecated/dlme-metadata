Morphine: This heading refers to morphine in the following forms: {a) pure morphine; (6) crude morphine; (c) salts of morphine; {d) preparations which contain more than 20 per cent of morphine made direct from raw or medicinal opium; [e) preparations which contain more than 0.2 per cent of morphine made from any of the forms of morphine mentioned in (a), (6), (c) or {d) ; (/) solutions and dilutions of morphine in an inert substance, liquid or solid, made from any of the forms of morphine mentioned in {a), (b), [c) or {d), even if these solutions and dilutions contain 0.2 per cent or less of morphine. Where the figure entered in this column includes pure morphine contained in crude morphine, the weight of such pure morphine and also the weight of the crude morphine should be indicated separately under ' Remarks Note 2. Cocaine: This heading refers to cocaine in the following forms: (a) pure cocaine; (b) crude cocaine; (c) salts of cocaine; (d) preparations which contain more than 0 .1 per cent of cocaine made direct from the coca leaf; (e) preparations which contain more than 0 .1 per cent of cocaine made from any of the forms of cocaine mentioned in (a), (b), (c) or (d); [f] solutions and dilutions of cocaine in an inert substance, liquid or solid, made from any of the forms of cocaine mentioned in (a), {b), (c) or (d), even if these solutions and dilutions contain 0 .1 per cent or less of cocaine. Where the figure entered in this column includes pure cocaine contained in crude cocai the weight of such pure cocaine and also the weight of the crude cocaine should be indicated separately under ' Remarks Note 3. When figures are given for one of the substances mentioned below in answer to the questions in the present form, the quantities required should be inserted in the blank column ; when more than one substance is required, additional columns should be added. Dihydromorphine and its salts (paramorfan) and preparations; Morphine-iV-oxide (genomorphine) and its preparations; Thebaine and its salts and preparations; Ecgonine and its salts and preparations; The esters of ecgonine and their salts and preparations; The esters of morphine other than diacetylmorphine and their salts and preparations; Benzylmorphine and its salts (peronine) and preparations; The other ethers of morphine and their salts and preparations, except methylmorphine (codeine) and its salts, and ethylmorphine and its salts (dionine); The esters of the following : dihydrohydroxycodeinone. dihydrocodeinone, dihydromor- phinone, acetyldihydrocodeinone or acetyldemethylodihydrothebaine, dihydro morphine and their salts and preparations; The morphine-iV-oxide derivatives and the other pentavalent nitrogen morphine derivatives and their preparations. Note 4. By medical needs are to be understood all requirements for medical purposes, including dental and veterinary requirements. Note 5. The preparations for the export of which export authorisations are not required are: (.1) preparations containing any of the drugs which have been exempted under Article 8 of the Convention of February 19th, 1925; (2) preparations containing 0.2 per cent or less of morphine or 0.1 per cent or less of cocaine, but not the solutions or dilutions in an inert substance (see Article 13, 1 (6), of the Convention of July 13th, 1931); (3) preparations containing of the drugs in group II (codeine and dionine) which are adapted to a normal therapeutic u. v see Article 13, 2, of the Convention of July 13th, 1931). Note 6. In order to secure a uniform basis for the preparation of estimates and statistics, it is recommended that Governments should adopt the following interpretation of the terms ' reserve stocks ' and ' Government stocks '. The term reserve stocks ' should be taken to mean the normal working stocks maintained by manufacturers and wholesalers for the normal domestic consumption of the country, for conversion in the country, and for export. The effect of this interpretation will be that, in making estimates and in compiling statistics of reserve stocks. Governments will not take into account stocks in the hands of retailers. 'Government stocks' should, as far as possible, be regarded as including only stocks under Government control for the use of the military, naval and air forces of the country or to meet exceptional circumstances. Any stocks of drugs held by the Government for normal domestic consumption in the country by the civilian population, whether such drugs are sold by the Government or distributed gratuitously, should, for the purpose of the estimates and the statistics furnished to the Permanent Central Board, be included in the 'reserve stocks'.mbk Statistical Form B (G). ) Geneva Opium Convention of February 19th, 1925.

The Contracting Parties agree to adopt the following definitions for the purposes of the present Convention: Raw Opium. — 'Raw opium' means the spontaneously coagulated juice obtained from the capsules of the Papaver somniferum L., which has only been submitted to the necessary mani pulations for packing and transport, whatever its content of morphine. Medicinal Opium. — 'Medicinal opium' means raw opium which has undergone the pro- cesst/j necessary to adapt it for medicinal use in accordance with the requirements of the national pharmacopoeia, whether in powder form or granulated or otherwise mixed with neutral materials. Coca Leaf. — ' Coca leaf ' means the leaf of the Erythroxylon coca Lamarck and the Ery- throxylon novo-granatense (Moms) Hieronymus and their varieties, belonging to the family of Erythroxylaceze, and the leaf of other species of this genus from which it may be found possible to extract cocaine either directly or by chemical transformation. Indian Hemp. — 'Indian hemp' means the dried flowering or fruiting tops of the pistillate plant Cannabis sativa L. from which the resin has not been extracted, under whatever name they may be designated in commerce. Note 1. One kilogramme of tincture is the equivalent of 100 grammes of medicinal opium; one kilogramme of extract is the equivalent of 2 kilogrammes of medicinal opium. Note 2. One kilogramme of tincture is the equivalent of about 100 grammes of Indian hemp; one kilogramme of extract is the equivalent of about 7 kilogrammes of Indian hemp. Note 3. In the estimates should be included also the quantities to be imported which are to be converted into other substances intended for internal consumption. Note 4. 'Medical purposes' includes the use for dental and veterinary purposes. Note 5. 'Other purposes'; for example, opium imported for eatmg or conversion into prepared opium for consumption in the country itself. Notes. * % \VI the a m e v vcfcul* ^ ft , Persian Gwlf &gt; H ?

My dear Coles, I have Just goo oaclz I'rom Geneva, and Vidien I have picked up the threads of rny various jobs again and, incidentally, also recovered from the fatigues of travelling abroad under war conditions. I hope to look in on you and cell you how I found things out there. Leanwhile, would you have a look at the Bahrein .oGiLU-ibe j.or 1940, which we (i.e. the Supervisory Body) found it difficult to understand. I enclose the figures 01 uhe Estimaoes -.or the current year for comparison. There may be some special reasons why they will want 10 kgs. Ox morphine next year as compared with 48 grammes this y ear ~ 5 k g s - of diacetylmorphine as against 15 grammes this, etc; but even the war liardly seems to provide an explanation. As we have to issue our statement by December 1st, v/e have provisionally accepted the estimates submitted; but perhaps you will be able to take up the matter at once and make s ome i nqui ry.

'Exported to': Give the country which imported the goods and whose competent authorities have issued the import certificate according to Article 13, paragraph 2, of the Geneva Convention; but, if no such certificate has been issued, the importing country is the country to which the goods were actually despatched. Import and export include consignments arriving or leaving by post. Import is also intended to include entrance from abroad into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, and export is also intended to include despatch abroad from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, although such traffic may not ordinarily be treated by the national Customs laws as technical import and export; but care should be taken to ensure that goods passing the Customs from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone into the country itself shall not be treated as imports, and goods trans ferred from the country itself into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone situated in the country shall not be treated as exports. However, if a shipment passes in transit through the country to another country and is accompanied by a proper export authorisation or diversion certificate (see Article 15 of the Geneva Convention of February 19th, 192.5), the country through which it passes in transit should not consider it as an import and export, even if the shipment is placed for a time in a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone. Goods returned by a country for any reason whatever to the original exporting country shall be entered as exports by the one country and as imports by the other.

The letters G and/or L placed at the head of a column or against an item indicate the Convention in virtue of which the information is required — i.e.: G = Information required in virtue of the Geneva Convention; L = Information required in virtue of the Limitation Convention. A Government Party to only one Convention need only supply information when the letter denoting that particular Convention appears both at the head of a column and against a corresponding item on the left. The Board would, however, greatly appreciate it if a Party to only one Convention could see its way to supplying the information required under the other Convention also, except in the case of crossed-out spaces.

Note 4. By imports 'for Government purposes ' is to be understood substances imported for the use of the military, naval and air forces of the country, or to meet exceptional circumstances. Substances imported by the Government for normal domestic consumption by the civilian population, whether the substances are to be sold or to be distributed gratuitously by the Government, should not be considered as imports for Government purposes. Note 5 STATISTICS SHOULD BE BASED ON ACTUAL MOVEMENTS ACROSS THE FRONTIER AND NOT MERELY UPON THE IMPORT AND EXPORT AUTHORISATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN ISSUED. 'Imported from Give the country which exported the goods and whose competent authorities have issued the export authorisation according to Article 13 of the Geneva Convention; but, if no such authorisation has been issued, the exporting country is the country from which the goods were actually despatched to the importing country. 'Exported to ': Give the country which imported the goods and whose competent authorities have issued the import certificate according to Article I3» paragraph 2, of the Geneva Convention, but, if no such certificate has been issued, the importing country is the country to which the goods were actually despatched. Import and export include consignments arriving or leaving by post. Import is also intended to include entrance from abroad into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, and export is also intended to include despatch abroad from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, although such traffic may not ordinarily be treated by the national Customs laws as technical import and export; but care should be taken to ensure that goods passing the Customs from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone into the country itself shall not be treated as imports, and goods trans ferred from the country itself into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone situated in the country shall not be treated as exports. However, if a shipment passes in transit through the country to another country and is accompanied by a proper export authorisation or diversion certificate (see Article 15 of the Geneva Convention), the country through which it passes in transit should not consider it as an import and export, even if the shipment is placed for a time in a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone. Goods returned by a country for any reason whatever to the original exporting country shall be entered as exports by the one country and as imports by the other. TABLE OF EQUIVALENCES.

M Note 6. In order to secure a uniform basis for the preparation of estimates and statistics, it is recommended that Governments should adopt the following interpretation of the terms ' reserve stocks ' and ' Government stocks '. The term ' reserve stocks ' should be taken to mean the normal working stocks maintained by manufacturers and wholesalers for the normal domestic consumption of the country, for conversion in the country, and for export. The effect of this interpretation will be that, in making estimates and in compiling statistics of reserve stocks. Governments will not take into account stocks in the hands of retailers. 'Government stocks' should, as far as possible, be regarded as including only stocks under Government control for the use of the military, naval and air forces of the country or to meet exceptional circumstances. Any stocks of drugs held by the Government for normal domestic consumption in the country by the civilian population, whether such drugs are sold by the Government or distributed gratuitously, should, for the purpose of the estimates and the statistics furnished to the Permanent Central Board, be included in the 'reserve stocks'.I \ ^ 110 .1867-8/4 rolltlcal Agency, Bahrain. 2nd Gctober, 1940.

'Imported from ': Give the country which exported the goods and whose competent authorities have issued the export authorisation according to Article 13 of the Geneva Convention; but, if no such authorisation has been issued, the exporting country is the country from which the goods were actually despatched to the importing country. 'Exported to ': Give the country which imported the goods and whose competent authorities have issued the import certificate according to Article 13, paragraph 2, of the Geneva Convention; but, if no such certificate has been issued, the importing country is the country to which the goods were actually despatched. Import and export include consignments arriving or leaving by post. Import is also intended to include entrance from abroad into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, and export is also intended to include despatch abroad from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, although such traffic may not ordinarily be treated by the national Customs laws as technical import and export; but care should be taken to ensure that goods passing the Customs from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone into the country itself shall not be treated as imports, and goods trans ferred from the country itself into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone situated in the country shall not be treated as exports. However, if a shipment passes in transit through the country to another country and is accompanied by a proper export authorisation or diversion certificate (see Article 15 of the Geneva Convention), the country through which it passes in transit should not consider it as an import and export, even if the shipment is placed for a time in a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone. Goods returned by a country for any reason whatever to the original exporting country shall be entered as exports by the one country and as imports by the other. TABLE OF EQUIVALENCES.

Note 4. By imports 'for Government purposes ' is to be understood substances imported for the use of the military, naval and air forces of the country, or to meet exceptional circumstances. Substances imported by the Government for normal domestic consumption by the civilian population, whether the substances are to be sold or to be distributed gratuitously by the Government, should not be considered as imports for Government purposes. Note 5. STATISTICS SHOULD BE BASED ON ACTUAL MOVEMENTS ACROSS THE FRONTIER AND NOT MERELY UPON THE IMPORT AND EXPORT AUTHORISATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN ISSUED. 'Imported from ': Give the country which exported the goods and whose competent authorities have issued the export authorisation according to Article 13 of the Geneva Convention; but, if no such authorisation has been issued, the exporting country is the country from which the goods were actually despatched to the importing country. 'Exported to ': Give the country which imported the goods and whose competent authorities have issued the import certificate according to Article 13, paragraph 2, of the Geneva Convention; but, if no such certificate has been issued, the importing country is the country to which the goods were actually despatched. Import and export include consignments arriving or leaving by post. Import is also intended to include entrance from abroad into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, and export is also intended to include despatch abroad from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, although such traffic may not ordinarily be treated by the national Customs laws as technical import and export; but care should be taken to ensure that goods passing the Customs from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone into the country itself shall not be treated as imports, and goods trans ferred from the country itself into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone situated in the country shall not be treated as exports. However, if a shipment passes in transit through the country to another country and is accompanied by a proper export authorisation or diversion certificate (see Article 15 of the Geneva Convention), the country through which it passes in transit should not consider it as an import and export, even if the shipment is placed for a time in a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone. Goods returned by a country for any reason whatever to the original exporting country shall be entered as exports by the one country and as imports by the other. TABLE OF EQUIVALENCES.

Import is also intended to include entrance from abroad into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, and export is also intended to include despatch abroad from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, although such traf&amp;c may not ordinarily be treated by the national Customs laws as technical import and export; but care should be taken to ensure that goods passing the Customs from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone into the country itself shall not be treated as imports, and goods trans ferred from the country itself into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone situated in the country shall not be treated as exports. However, if a shipment passes in transit through the country to another country and is accompanied by a proper export authorisation or diversion certificate (see Article 15 of the Geneva Convention of February 19th, 1925), the country through which it passes in transit should not consider it as an import and export, even if the shipment is placed for a time in a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone. Goods returned by a country for any reason whatever to^ the original exporting country shall be entered as exports by the one country and as imports by the other.

In the event of any High Contracting Party failing to furnish, by the date specified in Paragraph 4 of .-jrticle 5, an estimate in respect of any of his territories to wnich this Convention applies, an estimate will, so far as possible, be furnished by the Supervisory Body specified in paragraph 6 of Article 5. 3. The Permanent Central Board snail request estimates for countries or territories to .yhich this Convention does not apply to be made in accordance with the provisions of this Convention. If for any such country estimates are not furnished, the Supervisory Body shall itself, as far as possible, make the estimate. ' 2. The President of the 3oard, therefore, has the honour to send you the form for the estimates in question - Form B (L) - and to ask you to be good enough to return it, duly filled up in respect of 1942, to the Board at 3723 Morrison Street N. rY. , Washington, -^.C. On receipt of the form, the Board will transmit it to the Supervisory Body for examination. According to Article 5 of the Convention, these estimates should reach the Board not later than August 1st of this year.

Note 4. By medical needs are to be understood all requirements for medical purposes, including dental and veterinary requirements. Note 5. The preparations for the export of which export authorisations are not required are: (1) preparations containing any of the drugs which have been exempted under Article 8 of the Convention of February 19th, 1925; (2) preparations containing 0.2 per cent or less of morphine or 0.1 per cent or less of cocaine, but not the solutions or dilutions in an inert substance (see Article 13, 1 (6), of the Convention of July 13th, 1931); (3) preparations containing any of the drugs in group II of Article I of the Convention of July 13th, 1931 (methylmorphine, ethylmorphine and their salts), which are adapted to a normal therapeutic use (see Article 13, 2, of the Convention of July 13th, 1931). Note 6. In order to secure a uniform basis for the preparation of estimates and statistics, it is recommended that Governments should adopt the following interpretation of the terms 'reserve stocks ' and ' Government stocks The term ' reserve stocks ' should be taken to mean the normal working stocks maintained by manufacturers and wholesalers for the normal domestic consumption of the country, for conversion in the country, and for export. The effect of this interpretation will be that, in making estimates and in compiling statistics of reserve stocks, Governments will not take into account stocks in the hands of retailers. 'Government stocks' should, as far as possible, be regarded as including only stocks under Government control for the use of the military, naval and air forces of the country or to meet exceptional circumstances Any stocks of drugs held by the Government for normal domestic consumption in the country by the civilian population, whether such drugs are sold by the Government or distributed gratuitously, should, for the purpose of the estimates and the statistics furnished to the Permanent Central Board, be included in the ' reserve stocks! *'4 ~ M- M za'rr f, iqj-i vv It&gt; l i ' , lO ♦ ^ iiU.Statistical Form B (G).

The term ' reserve stocks ' should be taken to mean the normal working stocks maintained bv manufacturers and wholesalers for the normal domestic consumption of the countiy, for conversion in the country, and for export. The effect of this interpretation will be that, m making estimates and in compiling statistics of reserve stocks. Governments will not take into account stocks in the hands of retailers. 'Government stocks' should, as far as possible, be regarded as including only stocks under Government control for the use of the military, naval and air forces of the country or to meet exceptional circumstances Any stocks of drugs held by the Government for normal domestic consumption in the country bv the civilian population, whether such drugs are sold by the Government or distributed gratuitously, should, for the purpose of the estimates and the statistics furnished to the Permanent Central Board, be included in the 'reserve stocksNo. ZlZl.-8/4 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 2■ October 1941 Sir, t I have 'the honour to to your letter No. Eict. 4446 ^41 dated the 7th August 1941 and to forward herewith Statistical ^orms B(L) - Annual Estimate of drugs - and n (Q) - Annual Kstiraatee of raw raaterlals - duly filled, in respect of 1942. 2.

Noie 6. In order to secure a uniform basis for the preparation of estimates and statistics, it is recommended that Governments should adopt the following interpretation of the terms ' reserve stocks ' and ' Government stocks '. The term ' reserve stocks ' should be taken to mean the normal working stocks maintained by manufacturers and wholesalers for the normal domestic consumption of the country, for conversion in the country, and for export. The effect of this interpretation will be that, in making estimates and in compiling statistics of reserve stocks. Governments will not take into account stocks in the hands of retailers. 'Government stocks' should, as far as possible, be regarded as including only stocks under Government control for the use of the military, naval and air forces of the country or to meet exceptional circumstances Any stocks of drugs held by the Government for normal domestic consumption in the country by the civilian population, whether such drugs are sold by the Government or distributed gratuitously, should, for the purpose of the estimates and the statistics furnished to the Permanent Central Board, be included in the 'reserve stocks'.Statistical Form B (G).

The 'Total of the Estimates' (Article 5, paragraph 2), consists of the sum of the amounts given in the columns I, II, IV and V. All drugs are given in terms of the basic anhydrous alkaloid; they are referred to by their scientific names' 1 '; abbreviations used are explained below. The names of countries and territories for which estimates were framed by the Supervisory Body are marked with an asterisk (*).

That is why the Convention of 1931 rlaced upon the Supervisory Body the duty of establishing, itself, estimates for those countries and territories which fail^o furnish them. Such estimates have the same binding force as those furnish ed by 'e^arn^lits themselves. In regard to 1948, the Supervisory Body had to frame estates for tWn 1^ram?nfes'™fes!^rsSrvisoiy 0 Body'is guided largely by estimate.. ^^/^tf' ports of previous vears. As in the past, estimates are framed only for Consumption (..eading I o Mte organ must be that no omission on its part should Jeopardize the supplies of drugs for medical and aolentlficneecsto nonulatlons in any Jart of the world. Accordingly. It has framed estimates for all countries and terr!- to?les from which no estimates have been submitted, including countries where political and administra- tive conditions have changed of the lt beC0Bies apparent that the estimates framed by the Supervisory Body are inadequate to meet the medical and scientific needs of the country, the Covernnentconcerned has, under the Convention, the right of supplementing and revising these estimates. This is accomplished by furnishing a supplementary estimate accompanied by.an explanation of the circum stances which have made it necessary (Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention). + + Q . Present circumstances make the system of Supplementary Estimates especially important, as Governments seek to adjust their estimates to changing conditions. It is important that the Supple mentary Estimates should be sent well in advance of the date when additional supplies will be re quired' in order to allow sufficient time for the Supervisory Body to receive and examine the esti mates /and the particular headings (Consumption, Conversion, Stocks) under which alteration is desired should be precisely indicated. IV The Supervisory Body would again draw attention to the fact that many countries heve taken meao- ures to safeguard themselves against interruption of trade due to the war conditions, and considerable stocks have been created. Thus the amount of drugs available to the world shows a considerable increase which may in itself constitute a danger unless the system of control is fully maintained. It is par ticular importance that Governments of countries where large stocks are kept should exercise the strict est possible supervision over these stocks, .2^61 gxiJtiuf) 1° rlooe ^o a^nans'iirirps*! sil^ to iaBnaietZ Y The following table summarises for each drug covered by the Convention of 1931 the estimated world requirements for 1942. * L0 T 9ti * rf0iriW T 3i8ad f' lc \ bsyaal raumiAarfT aejpoxDni j I , acraei wot asirto ax/oiaannD ni wnKJ ons io 93j to iounoo xsxioxu TOTAL ESTIMATED WORLD REQ'.mRElU'ITS OF EACH DRUG IN THE TEAR 1942 FOR MEDICAL AKD SCTEITIEIC PUPPOSES Drugs (in anhydrous alkaloid) noid'sn 5ne iBnoxl Bfiietni —oo rfolriw ^ Morphine••••••••• Diacetylmorphine Cocaine .........

The Convention atatea (Article 2(2) and (3)) that the Supervlaory Body shall 'so far ee poeBihla' furnish estimates for countries which do not themselres furnish them. In framing eatimatea for conversion in respect of certain r ig 3 9 which did not furniah eatimates for the years 1941 and 1942, nor the required statistics for 1939 and 1940 the Supervisory Body found itself in a difficult position. Owing to war conditions the requirements andl^conaaquently, the manufacture of and trade in drugs obtained by conversion of morphine might have undergone substantial changes. In the absence of estimates and statistics men tioned above, the Supervisory Body has not the means of appreciating correctly the needs of such countries with respect to morphine required for conversion. It has, therefore, repeated in the State- ^ for 1942 the estimates fx^ed by it for these countries for the year 1941 If the conversion estimatea do not correspond to actual requirements, it is always possible for the countries con cerned to rectify the situation by furnishing supplementary estimates. TCSTTMATRS 07 AMOUNTS TO BRING STOCKS TO DESIRED LEVEL (Headings IV and V of Estimates Form B(L)). Governments generally are adopting the practice suggested by the Supervisory Body of leaving headings 17 and V blank in the original estimates and sending a supplementary estimate after the end of the year when the atocka in hand have been ascertained, . It should be recalled that the quantities necessary to bring reserve and Government stocks to the desired lew! form part of the total of the estimates. Unfortunately, some Governments, while leaving headings IV and V blank in the original estimates, fail to furnish the necessary supplenen- tary estimates and thus risk not being able to import the ar^unts required for replenishing of stocks. The Supervisory Body has observed In recent years that the reserve stocks in hand as reported to the Permanent Central Board often exceed considerably the level of such stoc .s fixed by the e mates. To avoid what may be considered a technical violation of the Convention, Governmen 3 are requested to watch carefully the stocks and, if these should exceed the authorised level, to fu ™ish supplementary estimates either under heading IV(b) ('the amount to be deducted from the reserve stocks to bring them down to the level it is desired to maintain') or, under heading III, thus raising level of the reserve stocks if such measure can be justified. There appears to exist in some manufacturing countries a misconception as to the function t)f the reserve stocks under the Convention. In some cases, estimates have been furnished under heading III for quantities far exceeding the normal level of reserve stocks, in the belief that reserve stocks should Include the total quantity required during the year for domestic consumption, for conversion purposes and for exports. But, in addition to being a precaution against emergency the role o. the reserve stocks is that of a working stock in order to supply current requirements of the home and ex- oort trade. Furthermore, exports do not count against the estimates of the manufacturing-exporting country. As far as the export trade is concerned, the function of the reserve stocks is only to fur nish sufficient amounts of drugs to meet actual export orders without waiting for additional manufac ture* 1 STTPPT.T?MENTAHT ESTIMATES. Since the issue in December, 1940, of its Statement containing estimates for 1941, the Supervisory Body has received and dealt w i t^ ei ^ty-^o supplementa^ esti.^ates for that year. By aupplementary estimates, the totals of the estimates for 1941 of the five principal drags were Increased by the following quantities: morphine 3776 kg., dlacetylmorphine 133 kg., cocaine 1412 kg., methylmorphlne (codeine) 3456 kg., and ethylmorphine (dionine) 531 kg. BRANCH OFFICE. In order to diminish, as far as possible, difficulties and delays in commuii- catlons with Governments of countries outside Europe, a branch office of iat Supervisory Body was opened on February 4th, 1941, at Washington, D. C., United States of America. STMPT.TFTED FORM OF STATEMENT. To permit a considerable economy in the cost 0 ^_P riirt ^^§» a s 1 -®? 3 - 1 -- ficatlon of the tables containing the estimates has been introduced. The tables II and III which were found In previous Statements have been merged into one table (table II) which gives all the inxorna n retired by the Convention. The Supervisory Body believes that the Governments will find the Statement In its almpllfied form convenient and easy to use. : m fc *41 1Tableau II SVALUATIONS POUR 1942 i i •4 ' &lt; &lt;0 a O M Table II ESTIMATES FOR 1942 Pays Country Drogue Drug &lt;4- a Quantity nteessaire pour Atre utilise comme telle « &gt;4 k - aotelj: » (Article 5. par*, a («)) Quantity necessary foe uae as such Y compris la marge, le cas Acbiant Including margin, c if any a - Marge Margin ' ' 5 J (Article s, para, a (b) Quantity necessary for ooovenioo (including margin, it any) tr 11 in Quantity nteeaaaire auz fins de transformation (Y oompris la margc^ le cas fehtont) M M Niveau des stocks de reserve que Too desire (Article s. pars. 2(c)) &gt;4 .t r- t. g Level of reserve stocks which it is desired to maintain 15 'J 11; 17 Quantity i ajouter aux ( + ) ou 4 d^doire des (—) stocks de reserve pour les amener au niveau indiqu^ sous III TT Quantity it ajouter aux (+) ou 4 (Uduire des (—) stocks d'Etat pour les amener au niveau que Too desire maintenir (Article Sf para. 3, denxiime adln^a) Amount to be added to (+) or deducted from (—) the reserve stocks to bring them to the level indicated under III Amount to be added to (4-) or deducted from (—) the Govern ment stocks to bring them to the desired level &lt;0 o • ta. t-. »-r *4- ^ 4- o &lt;4- Total des Evaluations (Article j, para. a. deuxitaae alin^a) Total of the estimates (Col.

In this form, the term ' Geneva Convention ' has been used to denote the Opium Convention signed at Geneva on February 19th, 1925, and the term 'Limitation Convention' to denote the Convention for limiting the Manufacture and regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs signed at Geneva on July 13th, 1931. The letters G and/or L placed against an item indicate the Convention in virtue of which the informa tion is required — i.e.: G = Information required in virtue of the Geneva Convention. L — Information required in virtue of the Limitation Convention. A Government Party to only one Convention need only supply information regarding those items against which the letter denoting that Convention appears; the Board would, however, greatly appreciate it if a Party to only one Convention could see its way to supplying the information required under the other Convention also. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS Show weight in kilogrammes; if impossible, state clearly the weight used in the tables. Quantities less than one kilogramme should be omitted from the figures entered in this report. Fill in every blank space in every column. Where there is nothing to report, or less than one kilo gramme of weight, write the word 'nil'. If there is not sufficient space on this form, attach additional pages with a proper designation at the head of each page. Figures should be shown without full-stops or commas. Only net weights should be entered in the tables {i.e., excluding packing material, such as cases, bottles, tubes, and other containers, wrappers, etc.).

When the Supervisory Body considered this estimate, they thought that the 'nil' return must be due to a misunderstand ing, and it was decided to disregard the 'nil' estimate ani to write to you in the matter. pQv^ps you will explain to the Bahrain autiiorities that if there is consumption of drugs, there must also be consumption estimates whether the drugs are imported or not.

Note 4. By imports 'for Government purposes ' is to be understood substances imported for the use of the military, naval and air forces of the country, or to meet exceptional circumstances. Substances imported by the Government for normal domestic consumption by the civilian population, whether the substances are to be sold or to be distributed gratuitously by the Government, should not be considered as imports for Government purposes. Note 5. STATISTICS SHOULD BE BASED ON ACTUAL MOVEMENTS ACROSS THE FRONTIER AND NOT MERELY UPON THE IMPORT AND EXPORT AUTHORISATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN ISSUED. 'Imported from Give the country which exported the goods and whose competent authorities have issued the export authorisation according to Article 13 of the Geneva Convention; but, if no such authorisation has been issued, the exporting country is the country from which the goods were actually despatched to the importing country. . . ' Exported to ' : Give the country which imported the goods and whose competent authorities have issued the import certificate according to Article 13, paragraph 2, of the Geneva Convention; but, if no such certificate has been issued, the importing country is the country to which the goods were actually despatched. Import and export include consignments arriving or leaving by post. Import is also intended to include entrance from abroad into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, and export is also intended to include despatch abroad from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone, although such traffic may not ordinarily be treated by the national Customs laws as technical import and export; but care should be taken to ensure that goods passing the Customs from a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone into the country itself shall not be treated as imports, and goods trans ferred from the country itself into a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone situated in the country shall not be treated as exports. However, if a shipment passes in transit through the country to another country and is accompanied by a proper export authorisation or diversion certificate (see Article 15 of the Geneva Convention), the country through which it passes in transit should not consider it as an import and export, even if the shipment is placed for a time in a bonded warehouse, free port or free zone. Goods returned by a country for any reason whatever to the original exporting country shall be entered as exports by the one country and as imports by the other. TABLE OF EQUIVALENCES.
