At the 13th ,nesting of the I.D.C,UC, held In London on 5th Fehraary^ 1946, which the Chief Locust officer attended, it was recommended that 9 taking into consideration the con tinued world food shortage and possible political repercussions if the Middle Kast Anti Locust Unit withdraw at this critical period, IL U, (h shoiild continue its policy of Anti Locust con trol in the Middle Kast and in Last Africa. Estimates were therefore submitted and although they showed a considerable increase on those of previous seasons due to the withdrawal of military aid, they were duly sanctioned. 2. By the end of the 1945/46 campaign (July), most of the key appointments, except for locust officers, had been made and the maintenance of the vehicle fleet and all ot^er prepar atory work for the 1946/47 campaign was well in hand. ^ 3 . Ihe Unit was therefore prepared to commence operations against the earliest (October) breeding in .Saudi Arabia. 4. It was suggested in London that the Arab League should be asked to enlist the support of all Arab States who benefit from the work of the Middle Last ,Jiti Locust Unit in nau&amp;i Arabia. The proposal was received syjsapa the tic ally by the Secretary-General who has subsequently asked all Arab States if they are willing to contribute either in cost or kind. 5. Two meetings held subsequently at the Headquarters of the Arab League in Cairo v^ere attended by representatives of these Arab States, At the last meeting financial help was promised by Syria and Iraq- In the meatirae the Middle Kest Anti Locust Unit has proceeded with its own plans as its work would have been handicapped if it awaited these final decisions. 6 a The Egyptian Government has agreed to co-operate in Saudi Arabia along similar lines as during previous seasons. They will cover certain parts of the Northern Uedjaz and the j iddlf? East Anti Locust Unit will provide an agreed amount of transport and petrol, the latter against repayment. They will make their own arrangements with regard to bait and commence -operations in November. 7- The workshops component has been reconditioning the vehicles during the summer at Jed&amp;a'and the Senior Entomologist and Administrative Officer returned to Jedcla early in October, when operations against locusts commenced.

With the highest respect Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant,LABOUR ADVISER . ma iA 1* The Labour Advisor visited the Anglo Iranian Oil Company^ installations at Abadan from 31st May to 6th June and again from the 26th to 27th June in connection with labour difficulties which had arisen there. His first visit enabled him to form a general impression of the more immediate dilficulties and the probable lines of approach, A full report was submitted to the Foreign Office. 2. His second visit was largely occupied in attending a lengthy meeting of the Joint Committee where it seemed to him that the attitude of the local Tudeh leaders had changed and become more hostile and where they appeared to be determined to go their own way and ignore the more sober advice of the Central Tudeh leaders in Teheran. This attitude resulted in the general strike of the 14th July. 3. He visited Teheran from the 28th June to the 12th July when he was closely associated with the Director General of Labour and other Persian officials regarding the Labour Law. After long and protracted discussions it was apparent that the latter had been drafted without preparation of the essential factual details, and by the end of the visit he had done little more than reach agreement with the Persian officials regarding the broad interpretation of their intentions. He prepared several memoranda with the object of recording these agreements and drafted outlines of procedure. He was also present at several official meetings dealing with the fixing of wages under the law. These discussions, at which the Tudeh representatives were present, were involved and rendered diffi cult by the absence of essential statistics relating to con sumer goods and cost of living generally. Nevertheless they proceeded in a friendly, co-operative atmosphere and by the 10th July substantial progress had been made towards definite conclusiSns. 4. On his next visit from July 31st to August 19th he was wholly engaged in advising the Minister of Labour (Prince Luzzafor i'iruz) and senior officials on a wide variety of matters connected with the labour lav* and the organisations of the newly-created Ministry of Labour. He attended several meetings of the Supreme Labour Council and its sub-committees. He drafted outlines of regulations dealing with Trades Unions, contracts of service and settlement of disputes procedure. He gave advice on dangerous and obnoxious occupations, the gra ding of work, differential rates of wages for women and juve niles, hours of work and factory legislation. He drafted a simple sickness benefits scheme, and indicated the factual details they should obtain respecting family allowances, unemployment payments, and social benefits in general. He was also asked to examine and criticise the proposed organisation of the Ministry of Labour. IM£ 5. He visited Baghdad twice, from the 11th to 16th July £ ro ^ a £9th to 23rd July. The first visit was at the request of the Ambassador when he conducted an enquiry jointly with the local representatives of the Army and Air Force regarding the application of the Iraq Labour Law to the employees of H. M. Forces in Iraq. On the 13th he visited Kirkuk Oilfields, at which a strike was in progress, to advise on terms of settle ment. On his second visit he met many prominent persons including h. H. H. The Regent and the Prime Minister. There was general agreement that the social and labour conditions of the country •...page 2. of the country! and in particular the provisions of the existing Labour Law, required to be studied by specialists, and the indications were that they would welcome British advice and guidance. He arranged to return to Baghdad for the purpose of a preliminary survey in the light of which it will be possible to make concrete proposals to H. R. H. the Regent and the Iraq Government. EfilgT. 6. In Egypt he has at times been able to give advice in respect of the need for reform of the Egyptian Civil Service, and proposals have been made to the Minister of Finance. Owing to his absence from Cairo he has not had the opportunity personally of talking with the Egyptian Trade Unionists on their return from the U. K.. but it is his intention to meet them as soon as possible Jointly with the Under Secretary of the Ministry of Social Affairs. LEVANT STATES . 7. In the Levant States contact with various persons concerning social and labour conditions has been maintained. His last contact with the governments of these two countries was in May but there is an urgent need for much closer contact with their problems, particularly as Russian influence in the lebanon is strong and is reflected in neighbouring countries. SUfiAfi 8. A visit was paid to the Sudan in February, as a result of which constructive work has been undertaken and the Labour Adviser has been invited by the Sudan Government to make a further visit early next year. October, 1946. Copied.6/ HEALTH ADVISOK 1. The Health Advisor returned from a week*s visit to Baghdad on 1st July where he had carried out a thorough inspection of the health services and the Royal Medical College and spent the next three weeks completing his work in Egypt befor e proceeding to England. He visited Alexandria for two days to discuss International Air Quarantine Administration particularly the differences of opinion which are continually taking place between the B.O.A.C. and the R.A.F. and the Sudan on the one hand and Egn. quarantine atthorities on the other. His work in Egypt is mainly concerned with maintaining the closest personal contact with health officials and their administration and *±k* advising them unofficially as regards their epidemiological and other health problems, arranging with the British Council and the Egn. health authorities for visits of officials of the Ministry of Public Health selected by him. to England and persuading the Egn. authorities to engage British medical experts or invite distinguished British doctors to visit Egypt for a short time when he considers it indicated. He keeps in close touch with both the Cairo and Alex, medical schoold so as to/personally acquainted with their problems. 2. The Health Advisor proceeded on three weeks duty to the U.K. in the middle of July and made about 60 vlsiti in London and Liverpool connected with his work in addition to making personals contact with the M.E. Secretariat. He spent sometime in the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine trying to arrange closer contact of Liverpool university witji the Egn. research services and discussed the health and other medical problems of Egypt with the Ministry of health officials, the presidents of the Royal Colleges and other medical authorities in London and Liverpool. 3. On his return to Egypt he proceeded to tk Teheral on the 24th of September for 10 days as the British delegate to the celebrations of the 25th anniversary of the foundation of the Pasteur institute. While there he Inspected thoroughly the healt services and medical institutions, discussed health problems with the American advisor to the Iranian Ministry of Health and made contacts with the British Embassy staff. He also visited Isfahan and inspected malarial areas in the Elpnuz mountains. 4* Shortly after his return to Cairo he proceeded to Addis Ababa for 10 days on the 10th September at the invitation of the Emperor, as the guest of the Ethiopian Govt, and made a detailed inspection of the health services in Addis Ababa and the community centre at Debra Behan at the rernest of the Emperor. He submitted a report to him pointing out the many defects of the health services of Ethiopia and incidentally recommending the employment of some British medical experts. He speni a night in Asmara each way and took the opportunity / and the the principal medical officer of the British Military international ac *®l n £ s Ration, the Chief Administrator and the area Commander quarantine discussing with P.M.©. the health problems of Eritrea/ ~ ~ request had beem made the Asmara area to be quarantine aisc ussmg with P.M.O. the health health rroblem^ health advisor’s suggestion am re&gt; affecting U.N.Q. health Organisation for th&lt; affecting Eritrea. excluded from the yellow fever endemnlc area of Africa which has now been agreed to. 5. The health advisor spent three days in Khartoum on his way back where he discussed the various health and cuarantine prectJbems affecting both the Sudan and Egypt and visited the Kitchener School of Medicine, the Stack laboratories and the Graphic Museum to find out how these institutions might be of help t&gt; the Ethiopians by training Ethiopian doctors, health staff, laboratory attendants &amp;c.- 2 - 6. After his return to Cairo he was engaC*d in routine work mostly connected with Egypt until 10th October when he visited Syria and the Lebanon for a week’s tour* He inspected the Syrian medical school at Damascus and the American Medical School at Beirut- He made contact with Lebanon officials and the Syrian and Lebanese health authorities and visited the rural areas in an attempt to asses the standard of living* On his return to Egjtpt he was occupied with routine work 9 including air ruarantlne problems and the appointment of British health experts to the Egyptian medical schools| until October 29th when he proceeded on a week’s tour in Libya at the reruest of the Civil Affairs Branch, O.H*Q*, M.E.L.F. 7* The health advisor has been agreeably surprised on the manner in which the local health authorities and the foreign experts of various nationalities have welcomesLhis visits to Iran, Iran and Ethiopia and how they have readily discussed their health problems with him and taken him into their confidence* His relations with the health administrations of these countries must of course be on an entirely different basis to those of Eg ypt and the Sudan where he has close personal links with the officials and can always keep in the closest touch with their uJUdbclx activities* He can, however, help the officials of these other countries by advising them about any health problems they are worried about at the time of his visit, informing them of what neighbouring countries are doing in health work, of which.they are often deplorably Ignorant, and suggesting which countries should visit or get in touch with on any particular health problems* He can also help them in other ways and can suggest the employment of British officials where indicated as during his recent visit to Ethiopia* When he has visited a country and made contacts he can visualise what is happening and keep a watch on its health.activities evern from a distance* ■ r\3r£ 19^7 Sir, In continuation of ray despatch of 2nd November, 1947; I have the honour to present a short report on the work of the Development Division of this Office during Xioveribsr and Deaezuber* 2. In early December. I paid a abort visit to Syria and t)r.« Lebanon, in company with Mr. Crawford, where many oontaots ware nade with the Ministere and Directors who are concerned with the eeoromio developtsent of these States. We were ingiressed with the opportunities for agricultural developifient in Syria and much encouraged to note the ftotive inte rest shown in Dazsasous in the survey being undertaken by the firm of Alexaxs&amp;vr CJibb &amp; Partners, .US well as the wish expressed by the Syrian President to mke use of the services of British Middle Bast Office experts when he raociTed the firm’s report. Wo were also glad to ascertain in Beirut that \fce Lebanese Government wore on the point of naking (and have now aiado) similar arrangements for a survey by this fins. 3. Dr. Pridio, the Medical Adviser, has bean mostly occupied with affairs in Bgypt and esp»ecially with increasing British influence in the medic*..', schools. It is gratifying to record that in spite of present political troubles, British influence in medical matters has remained as high as it has ever boon. 4 . Mr. Audolay, the Labour Adviser, was for two months in the United Kingdom, where he was able to discuss labour questions with senior officials of the Foreign Office and Ministry of Labour* His promised visit to was postponed in view of tbo preeont caretaker govsririiont and the forthcoming elections. 5. Sir Herbert Stewart, late Agriciiltural Advisor to the Viceroy of India, joined the staff on 15th November, 1946 , an®, has succeeded in gaining the oonfidenc© of the senior officials of the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture^ I have little doubt that his wide experience of Indian agriculture will so of the greatest value to the Middle Bast, which seems to me to have had in the past far too few contacts with India. At the end of December he joined the War Office 'v/orking party” which visited Cyronaica, as their agricultural adviser. 6. Dr. Murray joined as Statistical Advisor on 19th November. It was originally intonated that he should go at once to Baghdad and stay there for about two months to advise the Gcvermoeist on the organization of their statistics. His departure was postponed by illness but while in Cairo he was able to make a start in collecting statistics for the British Kiddle East Office library end in drawing up plans for the proposed Statistical Section which is necessary for the other Advisors ansi for the Aconccuic Division of the Office. He eventually left for Baghdad on 29 th December. 7. Tfee Middle Bast Anti-Lscust Unit (KSAUJ) r/aa busy with preparations for the campaign in S&amp;udi Arabia. Ho final decision has yet been taken on the appointaesmt of a head for the Entomological Section or on whether the Unit is to mount another campaign in Sami Arabia in 1947 - 8 * 80 The administrative work is increasing with the arrival of further Advisers and as a result of the increasing number of persons!, contacts made by travelling throughout the region. These contacts are of the first £s&lt;port*nce in the present troubled times and must be the' main fouxidation on which to build our work. he Higbt Honourable Brneat Bovin, M.P&lt;2 S® Arrangements have baon cesapletae. for the eiigagement of Advisers on Aaijna Husbandry .(Pr w Ffcwler of tb© Hannah 3&gt;iiry Xostitute, Ayrshire) aM.

As you ere aware, surveys with-a view to the ineu^ureticai of major schemes of economic development &amp;r© be:\ng carried out in Iraq,, and Syria and a similar survey is due to be sterted shortly in the Lebanon© These surveys should enable the Coveramemta coacernt'd to decide ov* a ’long term plan of economic development ana also to decide the order of priority of the items in, or parts of, that pl%n, having, regard to the financial resources which they can themselves devote to the work a;9d to the money which they will need and be able to borrow externally» 11.

Sir, xn continuation of ray despatch of July 5th, I hare the honour to present a further report on the activities of the Development Division of the British Middle East Office for the third quarter of 1S47. East Office in July on taking over his new appointment as Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Civil Aviation* Hia quiet and kind encouragemant will be greatly missed by all members ef the Development Division. United Kingdom to continue his efforts to find agricultural experts for the Iraq Government. The task has been a most difficult one as there is a very great demand for all such personnel, though new and more favourable regulations for housing and passage allowance for families have, to some extent, lightened the task. Names have now been submitted for most of the posts, including those of the two key positions of agronomist and soil technologist. It now remains for the Iraq Government to make the engagements. The Organisation is now fully informed of the activities of the Development Division and it is hoped that use Trill b© made of its expert knowledge when, as seems practically certain, a Regional Organisation is sot up in the Middle East* There is no question that the wide knowledge of Middle East conditions which has now been acquired by the various experts should be of th© greatest help to it® In company with Dr. Bruce Wilson, Regional Director of the Rockefeller Institute, Dr c Pridie, th© Health Expert, visited Northern Persia including those parts of Macanderon along the Caspian Sea* Particular note vme taken of the problem of malaria which is such a scourgo in this region. On his way to Persia Dr. Pridie discussed various problems with Iraqi and Britieh officials and gave a lecture on the health aspects of irrigation tc the Royal College of Medicine at Bagdad. The reminder of his tiiaa* was fully occupied with health questions in Egypt. in person his report on statistics for the Iraq Government. His report is a voluminous one and bears vd-tness tc the very great amount of tins and trouble taken in its compilation. The Iraq Government is now taking steps to implement that part which advises the setting up of a Central Statistical Bureau and the necessary machines have been ordered. The report is an indication of the backward state of statistics in so many Middle East countries. Dr .'Murray also spent six weeks in Beirut preparing figures for and helping Dr. Robson who had been engaged by the Lebanese Government to draw up a scheme of Social Insurance. Before going to Beirut he visited Teheran where he received an invitation to return later and advise on th© establishment of a Central Bureau. He will go back in December. He has also been Sir Arnold Overton relinquished charge of th© Britieh Middle Sir Herbert Stewart, the Agricultural Adviser, visited the Sir Herbert Stewart also attended th© Food &amp; Agricultural Organisation Conference at Geneva as a member of the British delegation Dr. Murray, the Statistical Expert, ooiz$&gt;leted and presented /asked The Right Honourable Ernest Bovin, M.P- 2 ~ naked to retui'n to Beirut in the spring for a similar purpose, and •it ia likely that he will be invited to do the same for Syria and the InterSts Consauns. In this case, an assistant statistician becomes a necessity, for the repeated visits which will have to be undertaken will be too much for one expert. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance -of statistics in all those countries which have schemes of development in mineL MTo Maitland, the Forestry Expert, was given an enthusiastic reception in the Lebanon and Syria. In company with the respective Directors of Forestry, he made a lengthy tour of both countries. The forestry and soil erosion problems are enormous and demand large sums of money and courageous administrative action,, He has been asked to return shortly to help in drawing up more detailed plans for the study of their solution® In August Dr. Fowler, the Animal Husbandry Expert, visited Cyprus where he has been able to discuss with departmental staff the progress made on the island. He lias also made further contacts in Egypt, one of them with an importer of Sudanese cattle who is having considerable success in fattening them quickly with local fodder mixtures. It is hoped that these experiments zaay be beneficial to the Sudanese cattle trade. Dr. Fowler is now asking an ox tens 5. va tour of Persia. SC' Sir Herbert Stewart, Hr. Maitland and Dr. Fowler are still studying the relevant parts of the long and cosoplicated Persian Seven Year Plan with the idea of being in a position to offer suggestions for its simplification. Mr. Audsley, the Labour Adviser, has spent most of the period under review on urgent personal affairs in England® Mr. Watereton. Chief Entomological Officer and Head of the Middle East Anti~Looust Unit, discussed in London with the Middle East Secretariat and Dr. Uvarov, Head of the Anti«Loouat Research Centre, the question of the formation of the Middle East Entomological Centre® No decision has yet been reached by th© Treasury on their proposals 0 Dr. Uvaro.* has pointed out that in any case discussions on anti«locust measures for 1£48~49 will be necessary between th© various British administered territories concerned. Advantage was taken of Dr. Uv&amp;rov presence in Egypt on his way to and from Rhodesia for talks with the Egyptian Government on the question of the draft Anti-Desert “Locust Convention which they had drawn up and which is unacceptable to His Majesty’s Government. The Egyptian Government agreed as a compromise to circulate the draft convention to the states concerned for their remarks only. It has not been possible to find out whether this has been done, though there is a rumour that invitations have been issued for a meeting in December. If this is so. His Majesty’s Government have not received ore , and in any case the meeting cannct take place because of the outbreak of pholera. In the present political atmosphere, the postponement of the Convention can only be for the good. All arrangements have been made for the coming anti-looust campaign in Saudi Arabia. The serious outbreak of the desert locust in French territory and subsequent breeding in the Western Sudan has come as a bad- shock. Dr. Thuriaux, Head of the UNESCO Field Science Co-operation Office, arrived in Cairo in the middle of July. We have been able to put him in touch with various scientific bodies and notably with the Board of Scientific and Industrial Research in Jerusalem. /AtA*b the moment it looks as if the outbreak of cholera in Egypt will severely limit or even put an end to further travelling by the experts of the Development Division, This is most serious as a considerable amount of constructive work had been planned for the coming winter. Copies of this despatch and its enclosures are being sent to H.Ii, Representatives at Cairo, Bagdad, Teheran, Jedda, Ausaan, Addis Ababa, Beirut, DanascuG, the High Coramisaioner for Palestine, the Governor General of the Sudan, the Governor of Aden, the Governor of Cyprus, the political Resident for the Persian Gulf, the Special Commissioner for S.E.

In a number * of cases the contacts were arranged in order to endeavour to locate and to secure come 20 agricultural officers of standing and experience required by the Government of Iraq on contract to staff the various sections of the very greatly expanded Agricultural Department which that Government Is establishing in connection with its large agricultural ^ development programme• Similar objects lay behind the one-day visits to each of the following well known agricultural institutions outside London: 1) East Mailing Fruit Research Station, Sent, 2) S.B* Agricultural College, Wye, Kent. 3) Bothams ted Experimental Station Harponden, Kerte. 4) Macaulay Soil Research Institute, Aberdeen* 5) Edinburgh. 6 ) National Institute of Agricultural Engineering,Aflkham Boyen, Yorks. 7) School of Agriculture, Cambridge University. In contacts both in London and at the above Institutions, lraq # s requirements of expert officers in the different scientific aspects of agricultural development were explained, our anxiety to find suitable British scientific officers for these appointments was stressed, and no effort was spared to secure the co-operation of the heads of the( 2 ) * £ v (S' Tarioufl institutions and of tho agricultural sorriscs, both at hoaac and in tho Colonies, in finding good officers* At the present time the supply of good* scientific officers in the agricultural sphere falls far short of the deustnd, both at home and abroad, for such mono Nevertheless, it is pleasant to be able to record that everywhere the greatest measure of co-operation was forthcoming, and though in some cases it would obviously be difficult to fill the places of some of the officers who might be selected for Iraq, the Secretary Agricultural Research Council, the Directors of the various Institutions, the heads of the Colonial Agricultural Service and the N.A.A.S 0 in Great Britain agreed to seoond a number of their good officers for service' ir Iraq if tho officers themselves were interested in the appointments« Sir Herbert Stewart interviewed, both in and outside London, a considerable number of officers likely to be suitable, and met with a very fair measure of success in interesting several of them. One or two who would obviously have been excellent selections in their respective fields, though definitely interested in the work in Iraq, had to declizio for health reasons 0 / o In otner cases, the M.S,S», on the basis }f information which he wa» able to obtain, took up with their employers th© question of the possibility of securing for Iraq th© services of other individuals whom Sir Herbert could not maet personally 0 In short, nothing has been left undone to try to fill Iraqis need?* in this connection, and bhough it has not been possible to obtain suitable men for some of the posts, the efforts made h&amp;vo resulted in securing some very good officers fer the remaining posts 0 • Whilst in London Sir Herbert attended a meeting called by the Ministry of.

Apart from any contribution which his ^ personal knowledge of Eastern and Middle Eastern agriculture enabled him to make to tho discussions on various items on the agenda and to the decisions finally reached on them, hie attendance at this Conference has been of the greatest value in a number of directions, but particularly in bringing him into direct touch with th© world food situation, in making knom to tho representatives of the nations attending th® Conferenc® the existence of the British Middle East Office, its organisation and tho work it is doing, and in making oontactp, not only with th® officials of the F.AoO* itself, but more especially with the delegates from the various Commonwealth countries, the U.S.A* and elsewhere* These contacts will prove of considerable value and use to the British Middle East Office as its work develops* After the Geneva Conference, Sir Herbert proceeded again to London, primarily for further interviews in connection with the Iraq appointments, and also to deal with various matters connected with his own work* Whilst in London in July and September he had two interviews with Mr* Bevin, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. He returned to Cairo on 25th September and the remaining days of th© month were spent in dealing with work which had accumulated during his absence.HEALTH ADVISER Dr* Pridle, th© Health Expert, visited Iraq and Iran in July* H© diecuasod health problem* with the Iraqi and British officials in Bagdad. He gave a talk on the health problems of irrigation at the Royal College of liedicine* He visited Kena&amp;nshah, Ham&amp;dan, Kazvin and the Ma zander an Province along the Caspian Sea, as well as Teheran 0 Particular attention was paid to malaria problems, as malaria . is the biggest public health question in Iran at the present time. He was accompanied by Dr, Bruce Wilson, Regional Director in the Middle East of the Rockefeller Foundation, During the remainder of the period he was occupied with his routine duties in Egypt, particularly quarantine questions and problems concerning British experts in the Egyptian Government. He visited the Canal area with the Egyptian Director of Malaria to discuss local malaria problems with the British Military Authorities 0 He proceeded on leave on August 4th. 1st October, 1947At th© commanceteent of the quarter Dr. Hurray returned from a short visit to Beirut whore he had organised the initial extraction of statistics necessary for Professor Robson's future work on Social Insurance, and had received a provisional invitation to build up a Central Statistical Bureau following interviews with the Ministry of Rational Econeny and various government officials. i During the first three weeks Dr. Murray was occupied in Cairo with the completion of his report on Iraq, a comparatively extensive document covering the. general principles of statistics, designing and layout for government statistics in Iraq, and giving the organisation of the Centralised Bure&amp;Uo The main body of the report consisted of a detailed examination of the statistics of several government departments with criticisms and recommendations 0 Among the major recommendations ms that for the installation of punched card machines&lt;&gt; Dr* Murray returned to Iraq on July 23rd where he had intervis;^ vita several ministers and a long talk with the Prime Minister to whom, ho presented his report 0 The Prime Minisber agreed on the vital necessity of statistics, particularly in view of the planning which was projected, and stated that he would poroonally see that ths major recoBacendatioas of the report were put into action. Arrangements were immediately set in hand for the translation of the report into Arabic and for its printing in Arabic and Engl5.sh* The third part dealing with the Centralized Bureau is to be put up at once to the Council of Ministers for general approval that the Centralised Bureau will come into being probably about the 1st December. At the some time arrangements have been put into hand for the acquisition of trained staff and for the purchase of punch card machines. This Bureau will eventually also work for certain other gcr/eminent departments, e.g. railways. When the third part of the report has been approved, printed copies will be distributed to all department b and the detailed icpiomentation of the second part will be put in hand whereby the statistics of each department will be reorganised in detail over a period. Dr. Hurray has been invited by the Iraq Government to make further repeat visits in order to press on the implementation of the report. During his stay, ho also visited two Liwa headquarters, to examine the embryonic statistical organisation there, and made recommendations. • • Prom 4th to 11th August Dr. Murray was in Teheran where, after interviews with HoM. Ambassador and M&gt;aasy staff, he saw senior officials of the Ministry of National Economy, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Labour and the Customs Department, arid had a series of discussions with Monsieur Ebtehhaj, Governor of the Bonk Me Hi. The net result of these discussion® was to show that Persian statistics lacked co-ordination and to produce an invitation to build up a Central Statistical Bureau© Dr. Murray returns to Persia on the 16th of December. After brief interviews in Iraq, Dr. Murray returned to Cairo for one day and proceeded to Beirut where he remained from 14th August to 29th Septejs&amp;er. During this period he was actively engaged in extracting statistics fop the work of the actuary and Professor Robson in designing a Social Insurance Scheme for the country. Owing to the paucity ©f Lebanese statistics and the lack of exactitude in th© attitude of many officials to such work. Dr. Hurray was forced to make .several basic . studies himself in order to extract statistics never previously available /in • ••••••in the Lebanon. A fair body of material 1ms now been produced. At the same time Dr. Hurray had many interviews with ministers and senior government officials, culminating in one with His Excellency the President, and resulting in a firm invitation to set up a Central Statistical Bureau in the Lebanon in the months of April, Hay and Juno 1948. He then visited Damascus, and after talks with senior government officials it appears more than probable that he will be invited to construct a Central Statistical Bureau for the Syrian government, either after or simultaneously with that in the Lebanon 0 The natural consequence would appear to be the reconstruction of the Central Statistical Office of the Interdts CoamamSo 14th October, 1947.FORKS TRY ADVISER During July and August, pending arrangements for a via it to Syria, the Lebanon, Iraq or Persia, Hr,, Maitland remained at Headquarters collecting and arranging information on various countries and dealing with routine matters. In late August, Mr. Paterson, Cossnarcial Secretary at the Legation in Beirut, wrote to the effect that H.E* General Hof&amp;l, the Minister of national Economy, would be glad to have Mr. Maitland's advice in the drafting of Forest Laws. He therefore went to Beirut on the 26th August. He contacted the Inspector General of Agriculture M. Acari, the Director of Agriculture M. All Pasha Tabbarak, and the Head of the Forest Service, M. Antoine Baiba* After discussion with these various officials and with the Minister, H.E. General Nof&amp;l, the latter asked him to go round the forests and write a report. Accordingly he toured with the Head of the Forest Service in the principal areas of the Lebanon, using Beirut as a base. Through the courtesy of Mr® Frank Antony of the Near East Foundation and Col® Brown of the DoS. Airlines, he was able to carry out an air survey for two and a half hours on 6th September. Nhile on tour various landowners and influential ex ministers and deputies were met. At the end of hia tour, Mr. Maitland was asked if it was possible for hia to write a report before leaving the Lebanon, and he made it his business to do so. The prompt produetien of this report created a good ingression. The Director of the Forest Service produced with his help a French translation end when he left was arranging an Arabic translation. While in Beirut Mr. Maitland was in close touch Kith Mr. Sykes of Alexander Gibb &amp; Partners, and he also met Major Holt of the same firm. Mr. Sykes consulted him frequently regarding the forest and similar sections of his report on the Lebanon and was shown hie report on forest development and soil conservation. Mr. Maitland gave him notes on technical matters regarding shelter belts and farm forestry. On the 12th September Ur. Maitland went to Damascus and contacted the Legation. l!r. Beaumont, Charge d 1 Affaires, arranged for him to call on the Director of Agriculture, Amin Bey Nasif, and the various other officials connected with that subject and with forestry. He also met Drs. Hunt and Pickett, American Advisers on Animal Husbandry and Horticulture respectively to the Government of Syria. He called on * the Minister of National Economy, H.E. Bikm&amp;t Hussein, with the Directors of Agriculture and Forestry, Amin Bey Has if and Wajid Bey Malki, and at the end of his interview the Minister said that he would be glad if Mr© Maitland would go round Syria in th© short time available with the Director of Forestry. Mr. Maitland toured with the Director of Forestry, Wajid Bey Malki, in a car provided by the Government and covered 2000 kilometres, visiting th© min forest areas (except for the Jezirah region). The Director of Forestry inf ormed his Government by phone as to* how he ms getting on and the Minister of National Econoiry mat the party at Latakia, where l!ro Maitland had a brief conversation with his. Th® Minister then asked Mr. Maitland to produce a report on his visit. The latter returned to Beirut via Tripoli without going through Damascus. In Beirut Mr. Paterson had arranged for final typing of Mr. Maitland 3 s Lebanon report, and it was handed to the Government. He left on 26th September for Cairo. On his return to Cairo Mr. Maitland found an invitation from the Minister of Agriculture of Iran to visit that country, but unfortunately due to the restrictions on travel caused by th© cholera epidemic he was unable to fix it definitely. His report on Syria was completed by the end of the month. 16th October,1847.(7) ANIMA.L HUSBANDRY ADVISER» Dr 0 Fowler, th© Aniiaal Huebandry Officor, hao been engaged in writing hio report on the vie it to Iraq and the study of the Persian Government a a Seven Year Plan aa regards animal husbandry, fisheries, etCo He paid -a visit to Cyprus between August 19th and September 1st and made contacts with the various officers concerned* In the interim he has made further contacts in Egypt, visiting the Government Poultry Farm at the Barrage, the Farm Estate of Galil Fahim Pasha, the Cairo Abattoir and the old and new premises and dairying installations of the Department of Dairying.

Dr. Murray reached Tehran on th© 8th March and remained there until 25th July on the invitation of th© Persian Covernnont to undertake, as in Iraq, a detailed examination of the statistics of every Government Oepartroent and to draw up a aoheme for their reorganisation, with particular emphasis on the creation of a Central Statistical Bureau,, The mowent of .i-uG arrival was peculiarly favourable to such roorganiuation eince the T-l'ear Plan had reached the stage which called for a statistical working pU»o Throughout hie stay. Dr. Murray was in regular and close contact with Dr e Kaficy, the ©xecutiv© head of tho 7~Year Plan organisation, and • lr » KbtehaJ, the Governor of the Bank Melli, and in feet was allocated by th© Persian Governnont an office In the Planning Board buildingo The first three weeks of Dr, Murray*• stay were spent in an intensive atudy of th© various drafts and detailed preliminary projects ic.-* the Persian j«T©ar Plan and of the American Morrison Enudsen Report and 'jthor background material,, In order that he should be fully cognisant of the statistics required, the Persians placed at his disposal practically aii their material on the Plan. Consequently throughout his stay Dr. Murray was in a position to advise H.B.M. Eabansy on the economic ir^rticationfi oi the Plan, and v/as in fact intimitely connected with the disouff-sions between the British and American Embaesies, acting as rapporteur xn the drawing up of tho agreed short list of projects. In so far as his statistical work proper tme concerned. Dr. Murray began his examination of Government Departments on the 28th March, dealing in turn with the Central Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, the Census and Civil Registration Department and the Ministries of Health, Labour and Agriculture between that date and the 16th April.

Dr. Murray also spent two weeks working &gt;m the statistics of the Sank Melli, which included the Coat of Living and Wholesale price indices, and the usual currency, banking and similar figures. Dr. Murray's stay was greatly lengthened, not only by hie woric on ths 7-Year Plan, but by the reception given to him by the Persians which resulted in his being asked to examine statistics which were strictly outside •she Governmental field e.g„ the Tobacco Monopoly. The chief field in which Dr. Murray was able to take executive action immediately however, was, as in Iraq, on the Balance? of Payments; he was invited to act os Technical Adviser J ° Committee established by the Bank Me Hi to construct this, and spent nearly a month on this work. His conclusions were embodied in a long report laying out a plan for the calculation for the first complete Iranian Balance of Payments, on the basis of which the officiale of the Bank Melli have now produced a calculation, for two years and despatched this to the International Monetary Fund. /br.
