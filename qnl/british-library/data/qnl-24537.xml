No. 1. Sir A. Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—(Received August 5.) (No. 139. Confidential.) n 1 n t 9i My Lord Gulahek, June 2,1, 190o. I HAVE the honour to report, with reference to previous correspondence closing with your Lordship’s despatch No. 78 of the 13th ultimo, that I to-day asked the Mushir-ed-Dowleh if the Persian Government had arrived at any decision respecting the status of Koweit Arabs in Persia. _ i i j i His Excellency replied that the result of his inquiries at Constantinople had been to establish the fact that the Sublime Porte regarded all Koweitis as Ottoman subjects, and would strongly object to their being protected in Persia by any other 1 ower. What ought he under these circumstances to do, bearing m mind that tire Persian Government did not want to have a quarrel on the subject with Turkey r I said that I fully agreed with his Excellency that good relations between the two neighbouring Mahommedan Empires were most desirable, but, on the other hand i Koweitis were oppressed by the Persian Customs authorities, it was natural that the Sheikh of Koweit should, in virtue of his special arrangements with us, apply to us tor redress, and I thought, in the interest of Persian pilgrims and traders m the Ara ) reo-ions more or less affected by his influence, that he should not, by applying to us in vafm be tempted to resort to reprisals. It was for the Persian Government to decide whether he was, de facto, sufficiently independent of Turkey to do tffis if provoked, an^ to be guided in its policy accordingly. I again repeated that w^e had no dnsi embarrass Persian relations with the Porte by any ostentations in this country, but only wished, in fulfilment of our obligations to Sheikh Mubarak to afford to tbLn such effectual if officious assistance as we from time to time extended t0 ^ The ^ushir-ed-Dowleh said that he would write to the Shah and report what I had said unless I preferred to let the matter stand over until His Majesty s return to PersL and thVin the meantime he would direct the Customs and other Persian officials in the Gulf to avoid giving occasion to awkward questions by treating Koweitis with harshness. I replied that, whilst unwilling b^ welUhat he hard on a matter which I admitted to be delicate, I thong ' £ or should auain communicate mv suggestions to the Shah without waiting tor tlis Maiestv’s S return. I added that' the orders which he had suggested giving the Persian Customs and other officers on the Gulf appeared to me to be very judicious, and likely, if loyally carried out, to assist in tiding over the present difficulty. It is not probable that any definite decision will be taken till the Shahs return on a question as to which the Persian Government is clearly anxious to procrastinate, bu the taowledge that we may again raise it in a form likely to embarrass them make he Lrsiaii futhorities more careful in their treatment of Koweit dhows and subjects.

I might get them to send an informal hint to their officials in the south to refrain from molesting Koweit subjects and dhows, but I think they would most likely stick at formally recognizing our protectorate over the place.

TEHRAN, 3 6th March 1905. My Lord:- I have the honour to report in continuation f of my telegram No.33 of to-day's date that on receipt of Your Lordship's latest instructions respecting the status of Koweit Arabs in Persia, I spoke on this sub ject to Monsieur Naus, His Excellency informed me that the orders telegraphed by his Department to the Belgian Customs Officials in the Persian Gulf, of which he gave me in confidence the enclosed copy, had been issued by the desire of the Mushir ed Dow!eh, v/ith whom he advised me to discuss them. The Mushir ed Dow!eh stated in reply to my enquiries that his own action was the result of a pro test made by the Turkish Consulate at Bushire against the acquiescence of the Persian Government in the inter vention of His Majesty's Residency on behalf of a native of Koweit. I may mention that the Arab concerned was a pilot employed on a British India steamer and that when the case, which so far as I recollect was one of assault ‘ Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., ., &amp;c., £c. arose.arose, I prevailed on the Persian Foreign Office to instruct the Bushire authorities to allow Major Cox s intervention and exclude that of the Turkish Consul, by pointing out that the.former might be justified, with out raising the political question, on the ground of the Koweit Arab’s being a sailor on a British ship. As a consequence of this Turkish protest, the Persian Government had made enquiries, by the Shah's commands, of its Embassy at Constantinople, and the latter had reported that the Sublime Porte objected to natives of Koweit being treated in Persia otherwise than as Ottoman subjects. The Mushir ed Dow!eh added that they had always been so treated in tne past, tnat is to say that they had 'been subject to the criminal Jurisdiction of the Persian tribunals and authorities to the subjects of the other within their respective territories, but the intervention and representationsnoted, puts Koweitis in a position different from that of Afghans, who having no regular treaty or diplomatic relations with Persia, are treated, except in so far as 'our good offices* are allowed on their behalf, on the same footing as natives of Persia. I explained to the Mu Shir ed Bowl eh that in our view Koweit was de facto independent of Turkey, which had not established or maintained an effective control over the country, although the Sheikh recognized in common with most orthodox Sunnis outside Africa, the religious authority of the Sultan as Caliph and was moreover the owner of large estates in the Vilayet of Bussorah. On these latter grounds the Turkish Government, I believed, claimed him as its subject, much as it asserted, with out enforcing it a claim to sovereignty over many other chiefs in Arabia^such as the Sheikh of Bahrein apd the Ameer of Nejd. Sheikh Mubarak Ibn Sabah however repudiated this claim and had entered into certain ar rangements with His Majesty*s Government bearing sore resemblance to those made by us with other Arab chiefs in the Persian Gulf, in virtue of which we had under takenundertaken to extend our good offices to his subjects, when outside Koweit. If the Persian Government re cognized, as they seemed to have done in their in- &gt; structions to Monsieur WaffaJaert, that Koweit was politically separate from and independent of Turkey, \ would there be any objection to a!Jowing the Sheikh to entrust the protection of his subjects in Persia to His Majesty’s Representatives, much as Swiss citizens were protected by the French Legation, or at least to recognizing such a limited intervention by us on their behalf, as we exercised under a *dast- khat' of the late Shah in the case of Afghans? The Mushir ed Dowleh asked what view would be taken of such a claim by us on behalf of Koweit sub jects (l) in Turkey (2) in other foreign states. Would the French Consul at Bushire for example admit the intervention of the Residency in a suit between a French citizen and a native of Koweit? I said I felt certain that in Turkey the Turkish authorities would insist on treating Koweit is as Ot toman subjects. This however proved nothing, as theyput forward the same claim in the case of Tunisians and Algerines (or at least used to do so when I was at \ Constantinople) notwithstanding the fact that Tunis had been a French protectorate for a Quarter of a century and Algiers a French possession for sixty years. As regards other foreign powers, I was not aware that any opportunity had arisen for any discussion with them on the question, Koweit having no intercourse with any States except those on the shores of the Persian Gulf. If such a case as he had supposed for the sake of argu ment were to arise with the French, the French Consul would either admit our intervention or an exchange of views would follow on the political issues at stake similar to that now taking place between His Excellency and myself, i have since sent His Excel lenc 3 . r a French- geographical work, based on Eli see Reclus'Geographie Universe!le, which whilst describing Bahrein as a Tur kish dependency, includes Koweit among the States of 'independent Arabia*. His Excellency observed that it was somewhat re- markable that no such test case as he had suggested should asas yet have arisen and that we should now for the first time last year have had occasion to intervene on behalf of Kcweitis. I said this seemed to me quite in- telligihle as it was only within quite a recent period that Europeans other than Englishmen had concerned them selves with the trade or politics of the Persian Gulf or that an European customs administration, with its strict and precise procedure, had raised questions which in the days of the old farmers had been left to be dealt with in a much more irregular and haphaz- ard fashion. The strict repression of the traffic in arms, in connection with which the Sheikh had complained to us of the harsh treatment of Koweit dhows hy the Persian authorities, was moreover a comparatively The Mushir ed Dowleh said he could not give me an answer off hand as to the view which the Persian GovernmentS' CA'i. I one or two representatives ]ess decidedly identified with opposition to our Interests in the Gulf, such as those of France and Germany, he fore giving me a defin ite answer. From a Persian point of view it is pro bably more desirable that Koweit subjects oppressed or robbed by the Persian authorities should be under the lethargic protection of Turkey rather than the strenuous care of a British Resident and the Persian Government certainly regards Turkish influence in the Gulf with much less fear and distrust than it does ours. This last consideration may however Induce it out of prudence to lean rather to our view than to that of Turkey and while I think that it will hesitate for a long time to commit itself on one side or the other, I am not without hope that a working understanding may be arriv ed at, especially if we can get the Persians to admit, which they seem inclined to do, that Koweit is de fac to independent. I told the Mushir ed Dowleh that I thought it would be to Persia*s interest to maintain good relations with Koweit, as the Sheikh was on friendly terms with the IbnIbn Saud dynasty which had apparently re-established its authority over the greater part of Nejd and thus controlled the overland Persian pilgrim route from the holy cities of Irak Arabi to Medina, K owe it was moreover becoming every year an increasingly im portant commercial centre and it would be to the ad vantage of the Persian Government to secure friendly treatment for Persian subjects proceeding there for trade or travelling as pilgrims across Jabel Shammar 1 I N{ u and Nejd, by a conciliatory attitude towards the poli tical views of the Sheikh and the commercial interests of his subjects visiting Persia, His Excellency made a note of this last observation and repeated that my representations would receive the most careful attention, I have sent him the enclosed written reminder of our conversation, but have thought it better to avoid formulating in writing any views about the status ofCopy. TEHERAN, 16th March, 1905.

The case was tried by the Karguzar (Persian Foreign Office Agent) Bushire in the presence of representative from this Residency and the Karguzar’s decision was communicated to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, who authorised him to settle it as he proposed.

From— -Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In continuation of this office telegram, dated 22 nd September, and with reference to the communications from the Foreign Department detailed in the margin, I have the honour to submit details of those cases of interference by Belgian Customs officials with Koweit subjects or property, which are up to now unsettled or may he regarded as still being a source of irritation at Koweit. 2 . I am as yet unable to report further regarding the incident which recently took place at Fao, in which the Agent for the care of Sheikh Mubarek’s property there was involved, as His Britannic Majesty’s Consul has not been.able to conclude the further investigation and report which I am expecting from him. The Political Agent at Koweit has at the same time been away in camp in co-operation with Mr. J. G. Lorimer, so that he has not been available for obtaining further information. 3. I now append separate precis of the detailed facts of six cases numbered respectively (a), (b), (c), (d), if), and (#). The first four of these havey. already been briefly dealt with in paragraph 2 of despatch No. 230, dated 8 th ! : ' December, from the Government of India, to the Secretary of State for India, of which a copy was forwarded to me under Foreign Department endorsement No. 42C9-E.B. I will briefly comment on the items in detail:— ^ (a) This case was mentioned to Government incidentally in this office letter No! L 203 of 2 nd July 1904, and remains in statu quo, the Customs having refused to refund the fine imposed. In reference to it Sheikh Mubarek addressed me a long complaint, in the course of which he wrote:— “ We cannot endure this treatment, and your sense of what is right will surely not permit that those who are under your protection shall suffer in this way. If you afford us relief you will do us honour, and for such actions your great Government is noted. If you neglect to do so and if this tyranny is not put a stop to, then we must seek some other state of things which will relieve us of it. At present all my subjects who travel for trade are in a state of terror.” I had to inform the Sheikh on 6 th July that the Customs had refused to comply with my representations and that I was still not unmindful of the matter, but had had to report it to the Government of India for orders. (ft) This case was only just alluded to in paragraph 3 of my letter No. 203 before mentioned, and was reported to he £&lt; still under correspondence.” Its further developments have been most unsatisfactory and have resulted in much hardship to the Nakhoda of the dhow in question, who appears to deserve substantial compensation both for the loss of his goods and for the harassing protraction of his case over a period of six months. (c) Requires no special comment here, as the Government of India have already expressed their opinion on it, and there has since been no further development. 4087 F.D. A I2 A (d) The same remarks apply to this case also, which is at present under ^ reference to the Persian Government. (e) This is the case of the Pilot Khalid. I last addressed the Govern- 1 ment of India on the subject in this office letter No. 254, dated 13th August. The Persian Government having been silent on the matter for some five months, 1 thought that on receiving their Karguzar’s report they had wisely decided to let the matter die a natural death. Such prohabJy was the case. But realising perhaps from Kenters telegram of 13th November regarding the withdrawal of our Agent at Koweit, that we were not prepared to take up a strong position in regard to Sheikh Mubarek, they have within the last few days begun to interest themselves again in the case. I hope, however, that I may be able to settle it locally with the Karguzar without the necessity of troubling higher authority with it again. (/) This is the case to which the Government of India have alluded at * the end of paragraph 6 of their despatch No. 230 above men tioned, and have decided not to press it. I am not sure, however, whether, when they arrived at this decision, this office letter ^ No. 397, dated 20th November, had been considered. * It is common report at Mohammerah and Bussorah, that these 28 rifles were intended for the Nakib of Bussorah, but I quite understand the difficulty of pressing a case in which the arms, even if not bound for Persia, were evidently being smuggled. It will be noted, however, from the precis of the case appended and from Captain Trevor^ observations at the end of paragraph 3 of his letter No. 397, that there were also innocent goods on board belonging to Bahrein and Koweit subjects, who had shipped them in the ordinary way, and that these have been included in the confiscation. The case of these unoffending persons seems to deserve independent con sideration, and the principle governing the seizure of their merchandise has been referred to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran whose decision is awaited. Foreign Department telegram No. 4207-E.B., dated 15th December 1904, regarding the boundaries of jurisdiction on the Shatt-el-Arab, refers to this case. I still await information on this point from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah, who I think has been away from head-quarters. I have sent him a reminder on the subject. Mr. McDouall writes, from a Mohammerah point of view, that there appears to be^ nothing definitely laid down, but that in practice Sheikh Khazzal accepts the view thnt the deep channel used by the largest steamers represents the dividing line of jurisdiction. I will report separately on this question as soon as all available material is to hand. {g) Alleged confiscation of some merchandize belonging to a Koweit subject from a Persian dhow. This case has not hitherto been reported to Government, and at piesent sufficiently strong evidence has not been obtained to make it any use approaching the Customs in the matter or to ask the Government of India to take any action in regard thereto. 4. Apart from the cases of Koweit subjects with the Persian Customs, a vu ^ ertln g to the original inquiry made in the telegram from Foreign with Viceroy, dated 1st December, I am led to believe that Sheikh Mubarek is, genera y speaking, a good deal aggrieved by alleged oppression of Koweit 10W p J na j^ e J s quarantine at Bussorah, but until I receive details from *r 6 i ° 1 ., lca ^ a t Koweit on his return from camp, I am not in a position . su rai a satisfactory report in this connection, and beg leave to postpone time 6 1676 grievance is not a very pressing one at the presentCASE (a).

In March 1904, the Besidency Agent, Lingah, reported that the P ersl . a £ Customs Revenue Steamer Mvzaffer had brought in tow a boat under lurkisn colours which she had overtaken opposite Chiroo ; that the boat beion S ed ™ the Koweit subjects above mentioned and was commanded by Aakhoda KasUid bin Preh; that she had shipped “ chandals ” (rafters) at Kuran (on the island of Kishm) for Koweit; that as the Nakhoda could not produce a Customs nass for the chandals the Director of Customs, who was on hoard the Muzaffer, wished to search the boat for contraband; that finding it incon venient to carry out a search in the open sea, the Director had ordered the vessel to be taken in tow in spite of the protests of the Nakhoda who had nothing contraband on hoard; that on arrival at Lingah the boat was searched, and in spite of the fact that no contraband articles were found on boaid the Nakhoda was fined 100 tomans ostensibly for not possessing the Customs uaners for his cargo; the Nakhoda stated that the papers were with the £wner of the cargo a°t Kishm and wrote to him for the same H e then applied to the Turkish Consular Agent for assistance and the latter ap?roached^ the Director-General, but without success, so that m °^® r J detention the Nakhoda paid 100 tomans and eventually got his boat released. The papers were ultimately produced and the fine was reduced to 25 tomans. The Chief of Koweit, who had meanwhile been petitioned by the Nakhoda, addressed the Resident on 31st March 1904, strongly protesting against the action of the Belgian Customs Administration. # The Director-General was then addressed on the subject, and m reply declared that the vessel was seized between the island of Keis and land, and that she was fined 25 tomans as the Nakhoda did not possess necessary Customs documents. t 0 i- •.

CASE (i). Detention of Koweit Mow of NModaUuUrM tin Khalifa at Shivoh. » May and June 1904. This dhow which is the property of a Koweit sub ^ b “®“^ d e ^ttlf M^y Munis, left Koweit with a cargo of dates and wheat on or about * 1904 bn arrival at Shivoh (near Lingah), the first port at^which she called^the Customs Mudir there demanded of the Nakhoda he possessed no such The Nakhoda explained that as he came from “ k P the effeot that paper, but that he held a certificate from jjudir refused to accept this both dhow and cargo were from Koweit. me mucurand declared that the wheat was doubtless fraudulently shipped from some Persian port and accordingly seized 20 bags of it. After detaining the boat for about 5 days the Mudir gare the Nakhoda a letter on the Customs Director at Lingah; the Nakhoda carried this to the addressee who took the same view as his subordinate at Shiv oh and added that the vessel must await the decision of the Customs Inspector who was expected to arrive shortly ; or, if the Nakhoda did not choose to wait, must land all his cargo. After a couple of days the Ins pector arrived, and declined to acknowledge the authenticity of the Sheikh’s letter, told the Nakhoda that he would refer the matter to Bushire and that pending orders from there he and his vessel would be detained. The Nakhoda finding that although he had been detained about three weeks he had failed to get any definite reply and being unable to afford to waste any more time lest he should lose his chance of selling his dates, left the 20 bags at the Customs House and sailed for the Arab Coast to dispose of the rest of his cargo, which he found was rotting. At the same time he sent a petition representing the matter to Sheikh Mubarek. The latter on receiving the Nakhoda’s complaint wrote to this Residency under date the 22nd June protest ing against the action of the Customs authorities and enclosing a Customs Jowaz obtained from the Persian Port of Mashoor whence the wheat had been originally imported into Koweit. The Director-General of Customs was addressed on the subject by this Residency and was asked to state on what grounds the wheat had been confis cated and whether he could see his way to release it. In reply, the Director- General stated that he was writing to Lingah for particulars. He subsequently wrote on the 16th July that as the Nakhoda had declared that the wheat had been shipped at a Persian Port, but had failed to produce the necessary Customs pass, 20 bags wheat had betm taken charge of as a security pending production of the necessary papers : that before the matter had been definitely settled, the Nakhoda had left in his dhow without giving any notice, and that therefore he had directed the sub-offices to seize the Nakhoda on his arrival. He concluded by enquiring whether he was bound to furniskany explanation to the Residency on behalf of Koweit subjects. He was informed that as the Nakhoda was a Koweit subject, the Resident considered he was entitled to give the man his Consular good offices. About the same time the Government of India were addressed with a view to ascertaining how far British protection was to be extended to Koweit subjects, and it was suggested that the Chief of Koweit might be advised to use a distinctive flag for Koweit boats. Meanwhile on the 5th July the Residency Agent at Lingah reported that e ow in question had been seized with her Nakhoda at Mokam by the Customs authorities. The Nakhoda was subsequently released through the intervention of the Zabit of Mokam and left in his boom for Koweit, but his jolly boat was detained. in e *' a ^ c orrespondence, Monsieur Waffelaert ultimately wrote °* a P™ 111186 had made to the Resident he was “ prepared to be vpIctsp flip ; o w ^rds the above Nakhoda, and as an exceptional case the mvnpr n a ^ S ° W1 i°f ^ , in fl ues ^ on ” and that they were at the disposal of boat hn^hppn^ 6 be u ?der an impression that the Nakhoda’s jolly to be iniwrppf ^r! 0 ^ -^his, however, on reference to Lingah proved detention of the Customs at Mokam. 8 ° UIld t0 W been wrecked while UIlder 3rd ^he 8 nu psHat? ^ ra ££ ed on fill the end of November, and on December the Director Cpt p J 30111 ^^ 8 ^ 1011 ^ 01, the loss of the jolly boat was broached to and dedined 1 t^correspond t0 ' in * subjects. sponcl turther with the Residency in regard to Koweit doubt snoilHoni^lp 0 ^ been taken °ver by the owner and are no 20 bags of wheat P T’iT ^ owner has lost both his jolly boat and his ” ot wheat.

Sheikh Mubarak having heard that his boat named which habitually plies between Koweit andEao on his own business, had been stopped, detained and searched by a boat from the Persian Customs steamer Muzaffer. about the middle of September 1904, wrote to the Political Agent, Koweit, strongly protesting against the action of the Muzaffer. The Political Agent in forwarding the Sheikh’s complaint stated that the feeling in Koweit itself was very bitter against the Belgian officials of the Persian Customs owing to this incident and the seizure of Koweit boats in the Shatt-el-Arab and might lead to retaliation. He also stated that the men for the Muzaffer were in the habit of firing ball cartridges at random l when stopping a boat and had done so in this case. The case was represented to the Director-General of Customs, Bushire, who, after some letters had been exchanged with this office, replied, under date 3rd November 1904, that the Muzaffer “ has detained many ‘ booms and heliums,’ but has never kept them longer than it was necessary for searching the inside of the craft He added that “the Commander of our boat does not recollect anything particular about the boom Muselim, but the mere fact of the crews shouting out that the vessel belonged to Sheikh Mubarak waa not sufficient to prove that the boat did not carry contraband goods”. No satisfaction was obtained and the matter was, therefore, reported to the Government of India in this office letter No. 395 of 20th November 1904. CASE [d).

News reached Bushire from Mohammerahin the middle of September 1904 that the Persian Customs Steamer Muzaffer had been searching all sailing vessels going up the Shatt-el-Arab for arms without reference to the Chief of Mohammerah in whose jurisdiction the operations were conducted. The Chief was greatly exercised at these proceedings and sent a complaint to the Persian Minister of the Interior. On the 23rd September His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, reported that His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Bussorah, had sent to mm the owner of a Koweit boat named Teysir, Nakhoda Ali bin Muhammed Mubara , which had been seized by Van Muzaffer io? having 12 rifles and 1,200 cartri ges on board. The owner stated that the vessel was bound for Sibiliyat near Bussorah to load dates, and the arms and ammunition had been taken on board at Kowei for protection against pirates in the Shatt-el-Arab and the villages e ween Bas-el-Had and Partag; that the arms had not been concealed; that the vessel had no intention of communicating with Persian territorythat w i e s e tacking up the river off the Turkish fort at Pao, she met boats from the Muzaffer and was seized. On His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, representing the case to the Director-General of Customs, he stated that the rifles were conceae an new, with full complement of cartridges and that as the impor a w (i s prohibited in Turkey as well as Tersia, it was imma aia wi y were bound, . He suggested that, as it would take some time to settle the case ^ reference would have to be made to Tehran, the owner may pay6 dnnMe the value of the rifles under protest and get his vessel released The owner! under the advice of the Consul, adopted the suggested course and paid Sheikh Mubarak on hearing of the proceedings of the Muzaffer made a ^nmnlaint to the Resident through the Political Agent, Koweit, and the matter iT before the Government of India, who are in communication with His Maiestv’s Legation, Tehran. The Wali of Bussorah has protested to the Persian Government against Persian gunboats stopping and searching vessels m the Shatt-el-Arab proceeding to Bussorah. The Government of India decided {vide telegram No. 83-C., dated 28th November 1904) to represent case to the Persian Government on the grounds that the arms were evidently for the defence of the dhow.

About the middle of September 1904 the Persian Customs steamer Muzaffer while searching sailing vessels for arms near the mouth of the Shatt- el-Arab came across a Koweit boat commanded by Nakhoda Ghanum and seized it for having 28 rifles concealed on hoard. She was brought up to Mohammerah, where the Director of Customs offered to release her on receiving a fine of Krans 18,000 which he said could ba paid under protest. As the fine demanded was more than the value of the boat, which was, moreover, mortgaged, the owner could not accept the terms. The Director-General of Customs, Arabistan, then wired to the Director- General of Customs, Bushire, who went up to Mohammerah in the Persian gunboat Fersepolls and brought the Koweit boat in tow to Bushire, the Muzaffer following. At Bushire Nakhoda Ghanum was at first placed under ordinary detention, but later on consigned to a room in the Government House set apart for prisoners. ^ He was then approached by a Customs representative with a sugges tion that if he signed a paper making over his boat to the Customs, he would be released. Before complying with the suggestion, he communicated with the Residency through his head priest and was advised not to do so pending receipt of a reply to a reference which was being made to the Government of India vide Captain Trevor’s telegram dated 11th November 1904. Meanwhile, on the 12th November, orders were received by the local Customs authorities to definitely confiscate the boat, together with all her cargo and confine the Nakhoda pending payment of the fine. The dhow was put up to auction on 26th November, but no buyer came forward and she still remains unsold. The Nakhoda was released as nothing moie could be got out of him and returned to Koweit on the 7th December. x our ounaies canvas and some skins belonging to Bahrein and Koweit su jec s which were shipped quite innocently in this boat for Bussorah were S °^ ^ 0r k ene fi4 of the Persian Government, the endeavours o is esidency to get the Director-General of Customs to release them The case was reported to the Government of India in this office letter No. 397, dated 20th November 1904.

Yusuf stated that the goods were consigned to him from Karachi in a Bahrein boat and were to be transhipped at Bahrein for Koweit, but that on the Nakhoda of the Bahrein boat finding near Basidu a Persian boat bound for Koweit, they were transhipped to her at sea. It was after this transhipment that the Muzaffer met the boat bound for Koweit. The Nakhoda of this dhow is a resident of Koweit, but a Persian subject, as also were the crew. On the matter being represented by the Residency to the Director-General cf Customs, Bushire, he replied as follows■ “ On the 1st July last, on our way to Cherek, we came across a big boat flying the Persian flag. Having stopped the boat we learned that it belonged to Haji Mahomed Dilomy. Prom the statements which Khalifa bin Abdulla, • Moses Khan, Armenian .seUtant. tlle i n ?P heW , ^6 said Haji Mahomed, made m reply to my * questions, it resulted that the boat came from Khamir, a Persian port, near Bunder Abbas, where she had been to sell her cargo of wheat and barley. The Nakhoda declared now to have on board 20 cases vermicelli and 13 bags dried beans shipped at Khamir for Dilom. In searching the boat we found the statement regarding the quantity of the goods correct. To my demand to produce the Customs Cabotage Jowaz, the Nakhoda replied that the documents were sent to Dilom by post. This kind of proceeding appearing to me very strange, I demanded that two cases vermicelli and one bag beans should be deposited as a guarantee with us and to be released on presentation of the necessary documents. As to the box of 17 compasses and 6 yards broad-cloth, we did not see any of them on board the said boat.” The above answer was communicated to the Political Agent, Koweit, who informed Sheikh Mubarak of it. Sheikh Mubarak thereupon sent the Nakhoda of the vessel and Yusuf-el-Haris to the Political Agent, who took down their statements. The Nakhoda declared that the Muzaffer confiscated the boxes containing vermicelli, broad-cloth and compasses, but his unsupported statement alone will not be accepted by the Customs, and although endeavours have since been made to obtain corroboration from the crew of the vessel and from the Nakhoda of the Bahrein vessel from which the goods were transhipped, so far we have been unable to find them, and Yusuf-el-Haris was not himself present when the goods were transhipped.No. 89^ dated Bushire, the 29th January (received 7th February) 1905.

In Foreign Department telegram No. 4207-E, B., dated 15th December 1904, in connection with the confiscation of a Koweit Dhow by the Persian Customs, I was instructed to report the existing practice as to the division of jurisdiction on the Shatt-el-Arab and as to the powers exercised by the riparian authorities oyer non-Persian and non-Turkish subjects. 2. In reply I have the honour to attach copies of communications received on the subject from His Majesty’s Consuls at Bussorah and Mohammerah. 3. According to personal conclusions to which both officers have been brought, it seems that usage, or supposition based on incidents that have occurred, recognises the deep water channel used by steamers as the dividing line, but it will he understood that the point is one with regard to which specific inquiries from local authorities has not been desirable, and it seems probable that if the issue were actually raised, Turkey would and could reason ably claim, under article 2 of the Treaty of Erzeroum, to exercise jurisdiction over the whole river, excepting only the anchorage outside Mohammerah Town. If half the river, opposite that part of the eastern bank occupied by Persian tribes, had been then claimed by Persia, they would not have been under the necessity of stipulating for the special concession granted them under the terms of Article 2, of liberty of navigation from the mouth of the Shatt-el- Arab to the point of contact of the two frontiers. If again, we presume half the river opposite the eastern bank occupied by Persian subjects to have been left to Persia, this Would have caused the jurisdiction over the river to take the following form when reduced to paper and this surely would have been specially provided for in the Treaty of Erzeroum, whereas only the anchor age at Mohammerah, a natural and necessary re servation, is mentioned therein.

The Treaty of Erzeroum gives the left bank below Mohammerah to Persia and free right of navigation from the sea to the point of contact between the two frontiers. On the other hand, the question of actual boundaries and kindred problems have never been finally defined or settled diplomatically and there is therefore only local usage to go on and that recognises the deep water channel as the border. Up to some years back we had constant complaints that Turks had inter- 'fered with boats coming to Mohammerah, and when some issue was raised in connection with Eao quarantine, the Turks, I believe, shelved the question by ordering all boats to go to Eussorah to do quarantine there. After this those craft only going to Mohammerah were not interfered with. No. 2, dated the 2l6t January 1905. From—J. H. Monahan, Esq., His Britannic Majesty’s Acting Consul, Bussorah, To— Major P.

If I can first get an official declaration by Persian Government that they regard Koweit as independent, and then communicate text or substance of Sheikh’s Agreement with ourselves, this would strengthen our claim to ask that Koweit Arabs should he treated on same lines as Afghans. Would there he any objection to acquainting Persian Government officially, hut, if need he, confidentially, with these arrangements ?

Rout William, the 8th December 1904. Sie, We have the honour to address yon regarding our relations with Koweit with special reference to the question of the protection which His Majesty’s Government are prepared to grant to subjects of the Sheikh in 1 eisian territory. 2 The question is one which has been brought into prominence by the action of the Customs Department of the Persian Government, whose officious activity has recently produced a series of incidents which have roused a strong popular feeling at Koweit, and appear to he dictated by a dehberate policy to destroy our prestige and influence with the Arabs of the western shore of le ■ Gulf. The details of these occurrences are narrated in the enclosures of this despatch, and their principal features may be briefly stated: (a) In April 1904, Mons. Dambrain, then Director-General of Customs at Bushire, while cruising in the “Muzaffari” overhauled a Koweit dhow which he apparently suspected of carrying arms. The vessel, which was stopped out of sight of land, was taken to Lingah, where her cargo was found on examin ation to be innocent. She was detained, however, for some daj b. and ^s not finally released until her master had been fined a sum of 25 tomans lor alleged technical breach of Customs regulations. (b) In June one Mubarak-bin-Khalifa was detained with his vessel for eight days at Sheivah and twenty-one days at Lmgah on ™^«AhaLe” he was offence against the Customs. Pending an investigation of charge he was reouired to surrender, as security, a part of his cargo and eventually, rattier thaifincur further delay, abandoned this portion of his freight, and left with his vessel for Koweit. c£ nr n* &gt;&gt; (cl In the same month a vessel of Sheikh Mubarak’s, the ‘ Mussallim , sailing between Koweit and Pao with a cargo of ''“A^Ltel Arab and hlld up for search by Belgian Customs officials m the Skat-el-Arab. (d \ T September a Koweit vessel, the “ Teyser ”, bound for Basrab, w as seized in the Shat-el-Arab ^ ^e^beTalue 11 ^ ‘la^h ffi twelA'rffleTXh w^riecffiy tfemastertobe carried for purposes of defence against pirates, a statement which was not improbably true. T ^i a Steam (e) In June a Koweit A^fo^b^maiUteZmers 6 , was accused of having ?* KTaZufi, V o rThP matfpr was referred to Tehran, where Sir Arthur Hardinge arranged that the case should he removed to the Court of the Foreign Office Agent or — to allow of a representative of the British Consulate-General \ / Karguzar, so as to allow or a representative ui ^ attending at the trial. In agreeing to this course, however, the Persian Gov ernmentex pressly intimated that their consent was based on the British nation ality of the Arab’s employment, and abstained from committing themselves to an acceptance of either the British or Turkish view as to the international status of Koweit. Mention of this incident has been added, as the issue involved is the same, though the case is of a somewhat different character to those preceding, and we do not propose any further action in regard to it. 3 . The present is not the first occasion on which the question of the status of Koweit subjects has come under review. The point was raised in 1900 in connection with the importation of certain arms into Persia by a merchant said to be a subject of the Sheikh. Our Political Besident in the Persian Gulf was then informed by Lord Lansdowne that Koweit was not under formal British protection, though we had promised the Sheikh our good offices; that natives of Koweit could not be claimed as British protected persons, nor would they be justiciable by BritislTConsuiar Tribunals in Persia. It was added that interference to protect any Koweit subject was undesirable, and that action on the part of the Resident was unnecessary until he was appealed to, but that endeavours should be made to ascertain the facts as to the man’s nationality and the Sheikh’s wishes as to resisting Turkish claims to jurisdiction over him. 4. In the recent cases we are left in no doubt as to the nationality of the affected parties or as to the wishes of Sheikh Mubarak, who has requested our assistance in formal and strongly worded communications addressed to our Political Agent at Koweit. We have not overlooked the fact that His Majesty’s Government have intimated that they are not prepared to declare a foBmal protectorate over the Sheikh’s territories, and have even admitted that Koweit is within the Turkish Empire. The latter pronouncement, however, was accompanied by the important qualification that the authority of the Sublime Porte is of an entirely unsubstantial character, and that in fact the Chief enjoys a large measure of practical independence. By his engagement of the 23rd January 1899, the Sheikh virtually placed the conduct of his external relations in our hands, and he now naturally looks to the British Government to assist his subjects when in trouble with officials of the Persian Government. In 1902 he was formally assured of British protection against an attack on Koweit, and he has repeatedly been informed that His Majesty’s Gov ernment will lend him their good offices, so long as he adheres to their advice. The visit of His Excellency Lord Curzon, in December 1903, was regarded as a further declaration of our intention to protect and befriend him; while the recent appointment of a British Agent to reside at Koweit or, as we now un derstand from your recent telegrams, to pay periodical visits to Koweit, has led the Sheikh and his subjects to expect a larger measure of support than they have hitherto received. We feel strongly that it is incumbent upon us to assist him to the utmost of our powers, and that failure to do so must lead not only to a complete loss of the influence which we have acquired over the Sheikh who plainly warns us that he will be obliged to seek other relief if we are unable to put a stop to Persian tyranny over his sea-faring subjects, but also to a serious decline of our prestige throughout both the Arabian and Persian coasts of the Gulf. The prospect of the Jatter result is one wffiich, in view of the evident designs of other Powers in these regions, we could not regard with equanimity. r ^ e repudiation of Turkish pretensions to treat as subjects of the bublime Porte natives of Koweit territory is no new thing. In 1902, in connec tion with the “ Lapwing ” incident, His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah directly challenged a claim to this effect preferred by the Wali of Basrah. But for tunately, in connection with the present cases, it is unnecessary to raise this issue with the 1 urkish authorities, or to take any action which need bring us into direct conflict with the Porte at a moment when, we understand, His Majesty s Government are anxious to avoid complications in that quarter. Allr, t i,y or e ;Gefieta| Go|, if tie sracterto &lt; in eur TO n Persia, lesiraile, it ie wj cts asto claims to i to oar 'hat Eis Ware a y of tie ctoflis Br'tisl Pefiiai ainstai adFice, in tkj o assist unable so to a neffef irectlj t fe‘ se# in? hs 1, Bij AH that is required is that we should arrive at an understanding with the Persian Government as to the status of subjects of the Sheikh within the dominions of the Shah, hut this is a point as to which we hold that our relations with the Sheikh and his direct demand for our protection no longer permit the attitude of the British Government to remain undefined. So far, it will be observed from the correspondence of which we have the honour to enclose copies, the local officials of the Persian Customs Department have declined to admit the ‘T^ht of our representatives to intervene on behalf of Koweit subjects. We suggest that His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran should now he authorised to explain to the Persian Government that we claim recognition of KoweitansjiSL Britis h protected pers ons. Should the Shah’s Ministers question our pretension, they might be informed of the terms of our agreement concluded with the Sheikh in 1899, and it might be pointed out that our right to intervene, by virtue of similar treaties, on behalf of subjects of the Trucial Chiefs, has already ‘ v ^ *'u*ir — -a -■ i- ^ J A 4- V* /-v -i4* i nr»l-» 4- l-v/ - * ■m/'i it I 4*Ta O 4' been recognised and acted upon. At the least, it might be required that '?**** Koweitans should be entitled to the same privileges as Afghan subjects in * - x Persia, on whose behalf it has been arranged that “ the friendly recommend ations and wishes of the British Government should be accepted”. 6. As regards the specific incidents which have made it necessary to raise the general question, we consider that in cases (a) and (6), in the absence of satisfactory explanation by the Customs Department, there is good ground for a claim to compensation. In respect of (&lt;?), we think that the Sheikh is clearly entitled to an apology; while as regards (d), without entering into the question of the doubtful claim of the Persian Government to exercise a right of search on the waters of the Shat-el-Arab—against this we understand that the Porte have already entered a protest at Tehran we hold that, in t!m particular instance their action was entirely unjustified, inasmuch as the vessel in question was bound not for a Persian, but for a Turkish port, while the confiscated arms may reasonably be taken to have been required for purposes of self-protection. The insecurity of the Shat-el-Arab is notorious; we have recently had occasion to uro-e that representations should be made to the Persian Government regard ing a ‘'rave outrage on a British vessel in the estuary; and we understand that the Persian Government have themselves lately admitted the propriety of native craft carrying arms in these waters. In this case also, therefore, we would press for pecuniary amends. The Persian Government may rest assured of our anxiety to check the traffic in arms, but, even assuming that their proceedings were directed solely to the repression of illicit trade, and were m no way inspired by a desire to harass &amp; protege of the British Government, we are unable to countenance high-handed action, such as that of the Persian Customs officials in the present instance. We have purposely abstained from mention of the further case in which a vessel sailing from Koweit was admittedly found to have concealed on board 28 rifles, in respect of which suspicions may reasonably exist that they were contraband, whether intended for a Tuikish or^ Persian destination. # ' i 7. It will be observed that, in connection with this subject, Major Cox has raised the question of the flag flown by Koweit vessels. I he matter was considered in 1901, and it was then decided that, in view of the objections which the Sublime Porte might raise to any change as involving a disturban of the status quo, it was preferable to abstain from advising the adoption o another flas^ We agree with the Kesident, however, that theie would be a distinct advantage if Koweit ships hoisted a distinctive ‘ the approval of 5 His Majesty’s Government, we would propose to approach the Sheikh on the subject.

Cox, C.I.E., Officiating 1 Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—L. W. Dane, Esq., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department Simla. ’ Certain cases have recently occurred in which the Nacodas of Koweit dhows appear to have been needlessly oppressed by Belgian Customs officials, and the Residency Agent at Lingah asks to be informed definitely as to what amount of protection he is entitled to afford them. 2 . In one case the late Director-General of Bushire Customs, Monsieur Damhrain, while cruising in the “ Muzafferi ” last April, overhauled a Koweit dhow at sea, between Hindarabi and Kais Island in the hopes of finding arms in her. Being unable to search her at sea he towed her in to Lingah where he had her cargo taken out and detained her several days. Finding her cargo innocent (it consisted of wooden rafters from Kishm) he allowed it to be put hack, but (as if to show that his action was justified) he found the Nacoda guilty of neglecting some technical detail of Customs Regulations and fined him 2 o tomans. The Nacoda went straight hack to Koweit and complained to Sheikh Mubarek that in the first place he had been seized on the high seas out of sight of land, and that secondly, though his cargo was innocent and he had not inten tionally committed any breach of rules, he had been delayed for several days and eventually fined 25 tomans. The Director-General was approached informally by my predecessor, and the process was repeated by me but without any satisfactory result. 3. A second complaint has now been received from the Residency Agent at Lingah, giving details of another case in which he alleges that a Koweit dhow, with a certificate from Sheikh Mubarek to say that the dhow and cargo were Kow r eit owned, has been mulcted of 20 bags of wheat and has been detained several days. This case is still under correspondence. 4. It is not however with regard to individual cases or the details of them that I have thought it necessary to trouble Government. My object is to invite the consideration of the Government of India to the general question of the extent to which protection or good offices can now be afforded to subjects of the Sheikh of Koweit when in difficulties of the kind above explained. It is evident to me that if we wish to maintain our influence with Sheikh Mubarek, much less to stengthen it, we must accept some responsibility to see ordinary justice meted out to his subjects in places where we have Agents, as far as lies in our power. I am also inclined to deduce from one or tw r o local incidents that there is some tendency on the part of local officials, possibly prompted from outside, to make a special set against Koweit subjects at the present time. With an Agent at Koweit and in view of Sheikh Mubarek’s energetic entreaties, •we shall henceforward be in a stronger position to use our influence in the direction desired; and while on this subject, I venture to inquire whether we might not now press the Sheikh to adopt a distinctive device for his flag, which would enable the vessels of his subjects to be identified. At present the fact that Koweit dhows fly the Turkish flag unaltered in any way makes it easy for Customs officials to ignore their Koweit origin, and encourages Turkish Consular representatives who wish to obtrude their ex pensive protection. Translated extract from a Utter dated 31st March 1904, from Sheihh Mubarek to the Resident. After giving details of the seizure and detention of a Koweit dhow * * “ And we will not endure this treatment and your sense of honour will not permit that those who are under your protection shall be treated in such a way.“ Therefore have I made this appeal to yom “ And in this connection, when we see that we get protection from you we shall feel honoured and so will our subjects. And such treatment is hoped for and is an attribute of your glorious Government. “ If, on the other hand, you take no notice of this and such tyranny over our subjects who ply their seafaring pursuits is not put a stop to by you, then we shall be obliged to look out for some other condition of affairs which will give us relief from it. The result of it is that all our subjects who travel are in a state of alarm, and all we ask of you is to see that the trade of our seafar ing subjects is not brought to a standstill by such treatment, etc. • * ' Finally we beg your kind solicitude for the protection of all our subjects in any direction which will honour them and preserve them from tyranny. ‘‘May you be preserved, and salaams.” i •XNo. 254 3 dated Bushire, the 13th August 1904, From— Major P.

I have the honour to refer to the case of the Arab pilot Khalid, regarding which we have been in telegraphic correspondence. In his telegram No. 46 of 12 th July, Mr. Grant Duff informed me that instructions had been sent three days previously to Bushire for the speedy disposal of the case in the presence of a Residency representative, but it was not till 14 th that orders were received by the Karguzar. He took up the case on 16 th, and admitted my Vice-Consul and Assistant Surgeon Lobo. The circumstances were found to be that the parties were good friends, dined and got drunk in company, and in the morning the negro found he was wounded. Neither party could remember how it happened. The wound was a very simple one and was under treatment at our dispens ary, and was going on very well, when the man was prevented from coming by the Derya Begi’s order and practically kept in custody by him. On the negro’s appearance at the trial, the wound was examined by a Persian doctor and our Assistant Surgeon, and found to have a plug inside it, so as to aggravate the wound and keep it open ! It was taken out, and the wound is quite healed, and the man completely recovered. The Karguzar disposed of the case on 16 th, as far as he was concerned, but had to report his conclusions to Tehran. Nearly three weeks have now elapsed, and he has received no orders. The pilot Khalid having been in custody at the Residency for five weeks, and the British India Company being in urgent need of his services, I released him on 21 st instant after taking security, and a guarantee from the Company that they would keep him on board their steamers and produce him when required.

I have heard on good authority that on the 24th September 1904, the Director of Customs at Mohammerah submitted the following report to the Ministry of Customs: Begins. Having received a report to the effect that a large number of rifles had been shipped from Maskat for Gosbah, which is at the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab, where there is no Custom-house; 1 sent Muzaffari there for a few days simply to seize the arms. 42 rifles and nearly 6,000 cartridges have been found and confiscated. Muzaffari left some days ago for Bushire. Ends. He does not mention having applied to the Sheikh for boats, I am having enquiries made at Mohammerah. Two Koweit dhows have been seized ap^ parently between Goshah and Pao, one of them which had 14 rifles on board was released on payment of a fine of 800 tomans under protest : the other which had 28 rifles on hoard has been detained at Bushire pending the payment of a fine of 1,200 tomans. McDouall’s good ofiSces have been accepted unofficially, but the Director- General says that he is unable to discuss the matter here as the report has been submitted to Tehran.

In continuation of my telegrams of the 14th and 19th September, on the Bubject of the proceedings of the “ Persepolis ” and “ Muzafferi” in the Shatt- el-Aiab, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government •Nos. 7 and 8, dated the 16th September 1904. ° f In(iia &gt; COpieS of two letters,* addressed . nr • , » tit- • i. x ™ i Consul McDouall to His Britan nic Majesty s Minister at Tehran, reporting the dissatisfaction of the Sardar Arfa with the Customs arrangements in Arabistan, and his objection to the despatch to the Shatt-el-Arab, without his permission, of the Customs steamer ‘ MuzaTeri No. 7, dated Mohammerah, the 16th September 1904 (Confidential). From— W. McDouall, Esq., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah, To Sir Arthur Hardinge, K.C.M.G., C.B., His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. I have the honour to report that, on the evening of the 11th instant, the Sardar Arfa sent to inform me that his official at Gusbah at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab reported that the Imperial Customs steamer “ Muzafferi ” was there, and was stopping and searching boats of all kinds, and he was afraid there might be trouble, as he could not be everywhere at once. His Excellency, as the Customs had thus assumed the policing of the river, was very glad to be relieved of that expense, and would remove his patrols in a few days’ time if the vessel remained, and inform us officially that he was no longer responsible for the safety of the river which had been assumed by the Customs. Therefore I sent a telegram to Basrah to be sent to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire, giving the above facts, and Haji Bais Tujar promised that the patrols should not be removed for a few days to give time for a reply to be received. I have seen the Sardar Arfa twice on this subject. He points out that, although he is supposed to be head of the Customs, the “ Muzafferi ” has been sent into his jurisdiction without his being informed : secondly, as Governor, he should have been warned in order to take steps to prevent trouble by sending men of his own to be present at the searching of suspected boats. He understands they stop both sea and river boats and their boats enter the creeks, so that a collision might occur with the tribesmen in the absence of his men. Thirdly, he is warden of the marches (Sarhaddar), and the Shatt-el-Arab being the border between Turkey and Persia, complications with Turkey may arise over the actions of the “ Muzafferi”; and if the Turkish authorities at Basrah ask for an explanation, he has none to give. He also reiterated what he had said regarding withdrawing the patrols, and wished His Majesty’s Minister to be informed that he might take any action, if advisable. In the event of his withdrawing the patrols, there is, in my opinion, a likeli hood of a recrudescence of piracy in the river. I also believe that interference with the tribesmen, in the absence of the Sardar Arfa’s men, is likely to lead to trouble. No. 8, dated Mohamraerah, the 16th September 1904 (Confidential). From—W. McDouall, Esq., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah, To— Sir Arthur Hardinge, K.C.M.G., C.B., His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. I have the honour to report that the Sardar Arfa is making certain com plaints to the Minister of the Interior at Tehran, of which he wishes you to be informed, but not with a view to asking for support in the matter.I ■^r In the firman given him in connection with the Customs, it is distinctly stated that the Directorship-in-Chief (Riasat-i-kul; of the Customs of Arabistan is his : that, as there are no capable local men, Mons. Waffelaerat and Mons. Mirzavanty are to be sent to be in charge of the Customs under his Director ship and orders, and his Directorship is under the Ministry of Customs. He undertakes to carry out the orders of the Ministry of _ Customs, and to lend his private steamers, when required, for preventive service. This Directorship appears to be practically ignored, but whether this is the fault of the local Customs or the Ministry he does not know. Clerks have been appointed with out reference to him, and other small matters show that the local Directorate ignore his headship. Again, the Customs of Arabistan is not under Bushire as is shown by the firman above, yet the Bushire administration have sent the “ Muzafferi” into the Shatt-el-Arab to search for arms and other contraband, and, on the Captain reporting that he had arrested two sailing boats with arms, the Bushire Director ordered him to bring them to Bushire. The Captain could not do this, so brought them to Mohammerah, and telegraphed to Bushire for the “ Persepolis” to come for them. Some months ago the Cashier of the Mohammerah Customs embezzled moneys belonging to the Customs and absconded to Karachi, where he was arrest ed. The Sardar Arfa, at the request of the Customs, issued a warrant to two of his guards to receive the prisoner and bring him to Mohammerah, and his signature and position were authenticated at this Consulate. On this warrant the prisoner was extradited and brought to Mohammerah, and detained at the Customs House. After a preliminary examination, at which the Sardar Arfa was represented, Mons. Waffelaert being transferred to Bushire, took the prisoner with him, and handed him over to the custody of the authorities at Bushire, although the offence was committed in the jurisdiction of Arabistan. Prom this it appears that the Customs wish to ignore his position as Governor, as well as that of supreme Director of the Customs of Arabistan, and he considers it necessary to report this to the Central Government. foreign 0«C« PreH—tfo, 1470—6’10.04-H^. *Extracts from the Diary of the Political Pendency in the Persian Gulf for the meek ending 24th September 1904, A ' Mohammerah. * * * * 13.

I am making further enquiries into tbe matter, and also asking the Director General of Customs on what grounds these dhows were seized. No. 24, dated the 14th September 1904. From— Captain S. G. Knox, Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in tbe Persian Gulf, Busbire. I have tbe honour to forward herewith a copy (witb translation) of a letter received from Sheikh Mubarak, in which he complains of a fresh set of acts of interference with Koweit vessels on tbe part of the Customs Administration of Persia. 2 . I have not had time to verify tbe allegations, as tbe letter only reached me yesterday, and Sheikh Mubarak is anxious that you should be acquainted with his complaint without delay.3. I am afraid, however, that these constant complaints prove a deliberate policy*on the part of the Persian Government, of which the object is to destroy our prestige and influence with the Arabs of the western shore of the Gulf. The initiation of this policy was marked by the abortive attempt to occupy Abu Musa and Tamb and, since that failed, the policy has been continued by constant vexations, petty acts of oppression on Arab dhows, especially those hailing from Howeit, and it has now culminated, if I have been correctly informed, in a wanton and unjustifiable insult to an independent Chief under British protection. 4. One of the most oppressive and vexatious forms of this policy is the invariable assumption by the Customs Department that the Arab Nakhoda is in the wrong, and must prove his innocence. I will instance the case of an unfortunate, named Mubarak-bin-Khalifa. 5. This man was detained at Lingah for twenty-one days, having been brought from Sheivah, where he had already been detained eight days for the purpose. Twenty bags of grain were taken from him as security, and he was told to wait and prove his innocence. There is fairly strong evidence that his wheat cargo for which he was unable to account satisfactorily was legitimate, and, having come under a pass from the Persian port of Mashur, was, six months latter, re-exported from Koweit, but this naturally took time to prove. The case has my attention. 6. Finding his other cargo rotting during his detention, Mubarak made his escape, and put out to sea. The Belgians have detained him, and some of his crew, pending trial for a month, and have confiscated twenty bags of his grain for an offence which, there is reason to believe, he never committed, and has yet to be proved against him, but for this last heinous offence in disobeying their order to wait and prove his innocence, he is to be persecuted in every Persian port, in winch he dares to show his face. They have caught him once already, and attached a small boat of his, but could not manage to detain the man himself, who is now in Koweit. 7. It is perhaps unnecessary to call to your remembrance the case, on your office records, of the Koweit boat which, it is alleged, w^as searched unsuccessfully for arms in the open sea, and then towed into territorial waters and heavily fined for a technical breach of the Customs Begulations. 8. This extraordinary assumption that Arab Nakhoftas are bound to prove that they have not committed an offence against the Customs Department can have only one result, where on the one side we have a well-regulated department, armed with clerks, regulations, and engines of oppression of every description, and on the other ignorant Nakhodas seldom able even to read and write. . ^ ie filing in Koweit itself is very bitter against the Belgians, and might at any time, lead to acts of retaliation on Persians, and thus the situa* tion would become acute and dangerous. 10. If the Customs Administration persist in this course of conduct, the only remedy that appears to me at all likely to meet the situation is that one of our gun-boats should attend the Muzofferi and Persepolis, wherever they go, especially in the open sea, and whenever they overhaul a boat hailing from the western shores of the Gulf, the Commander of the gun-boat should insist on laving a clear pnmd facie case against the boat being made out to his satis faction or the immediate release of the vessel. 11. The alleged interference with boats hound for Basrah will no doubt form the subject of a protest from the Turkish local authorities, and I would venture to suggest that His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah be addressed on the subject. . conclusion, I would crave indulgence for this hastily written preli- mmary report. The whole subject is under the close and anxious attention of b eikh Mubarak and myself, and I hope, at leisure, to submit more fully matured proposals for the solution of the very important difficulties involved' {Translation).

After compliments. —We petition you that the Persian ship, in which are posted Belgians, is now cruising from the buoy to Gusbah within the Shat-el-Arab, and seized vessels, and searches them, and delays them on their journeys; that^ it has seized our boom and helium which voyage between here and Pao, bringing wood and dates for us, and delayed them some days, and they (the boom and bellum) told them that they were our private boats, and that their work was between Koweit and Pao, bringing wood and dates, and after this vexation they let them go. And now they have seized a boat of our subjects going to Basrah from Koweit, and have taken their arms which all the boats carry for protection from pirates, and this matter is well known to all the Governments. Every boat carries a small gun for saluting purposes on return to their country and arras, according to the number of the crew in her, as piracy in Basrah is notorious. Now they have posted soldiers in her, and taken her small arms to the number of 12, and delayed the boat. And now a letter from the Nakhoda of the boat has reached us, saying that they had seized them at the buoy, and towed the boat into Kasbah in front of the house of the servant of Sheikh Khazal, Euler of Mohammerah, and they left soldiers in the boat, and kept her in custody with him.

I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of the Govern ment of India, a copy of a letter No. 83, dated 23rd September 1904, from His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah, on the subject of the proceedings of the Persian Revenue steamer cc Muzafferi” in the Shatt-el-Arab. 2 . In reply to a reference from me, Mons. Waffelaert, Director-General of Customs, states that the “ Muzafferi” did, in fact, capture two Koweit dhows, one of which was released on payment (under protest) of a fine of 8,000 krans and the other of which was brought to Bushire to he detained till’ a fine of krans 18,000 is paid. Mons. Waffelaert added that it was not in his power to discuss the matter further at Bushire, as a report of the capture had already been despatched to Tehran, presumably from Mohammerah. 3. The position of British Consular officers in Persia with regard to Koweit subjects is at present so undefined that, in view of Mons. Waffelaert’s attitude, it seems unlikely that very much will be effected here. _ 4. A copy of this communication, with its enclosure, has been sent to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran.

Z Cox, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Acting Consul-General for Ears, Khuzistan, &amp;c. With regard to the seizure of native craft by Customs S.S. “ Muzafferi ”, I have the honour to report that the owner of a Koweit bum made a complaint to His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah who sent him to me. I have no instructions as to whether Koweit subjects are entitled to more than good offices, and enquired from the Customs authorities if they would accept my intervention on behalf of Koweit subjects. Mons. Waffelaert, Acting Director-General, Bushire, informed me that at Bushire, as he had no orders from Tehran to recognise the right of His Majesty’s Consulate-General to represent Koweit subjects, there was an understanding that, pending instruc tions, any action of the Consulate-General should be unofficial, and suggested that the same should be done here to which I agreed. Mons. Waffelaert said that, as it would take some time to settle the case, and reference would have to be made to Tehran, to avoid delay to the vessels, he was prepared to accept payment of a fine under protest, the fine to be twice the value of the rifles, estimated at thirty tomans each, and the vessels could then be liberated ; when the case had been settled, and amount of fine .fixed if anything to be returned to the owner it would be returned. The owner of bum accepted this on my advice, and has received a receipt, stating that the amount was paid under protest. The owners are Abdulla-bin-Muhammad and Alwan-bin-Hosein who state that they bought the vessel two years ago from Abdul Aziz Angri, in whose name the register was issued by Sheikh Mubarak. The vessel is the bum “ Teyser”, Nakhoda Ali-bin-Muhammad Mubarak. She was bound from Koweit for Sabiliyat near Basrah to load dates. The case for the vessel is that they carried twelve rifles and twelve hundred cartridges for the defence of the vessel and did not coneal that they had these rifles on board : that they were bound for Sabiliyat in Turkish territory, where their owner is awaiting them and had no intention of communicating with Persian territory : that the river being the border they were not in Persian waters : that as they w r ere to load dates for sale at the Bedouin villages between Ras-el-Had and Partag and on, they had brought these arms for protection.The Customs case is that the rifles were concealed and were new with the full complement of cartridges : that as the importation of arms is prohibited m Turkey as well as Persia it is of no importance where they were bound. If the vessel can prove that the rifles were not for sale, I am of opinion that twelve rifles are not an excessive amount, as piracies often occur oft' the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, and all vessels therefore should carry sufficient arms to protect themselves ; and the Bedouin coast is also unsale. A second bum, Nakhoda Ghanim, is also understood to belong to Eioweit. She had twenty-eight rifles conce/iled on board, and ibis fact is not denied, she had some bundles of hides consigned to Basrah to which port she was bound. She was captured near the inner buoy and can only put forward that she was bound for a Turkish port and was not within Persian jurisdiction. Tins vessel has been taken to Bushire, as the owner cannot pay a fine. The fine demanded would come to more than the value of the vessel, and the owner’s entire capital was invested in these rifles and the vessel which is mortgaged already. The “ Teyser ” proceeds to Sabiliyat where I can communicate with her; she will be there for at least a fortnight. I enclose herewith the deposition of the Nakhoda and, if necessary, he will swear an affidavit in these terms. The owner states he can get evidence at Koweit that the rifles were pur chased for the defence of the vessel only. If the presence of the owner, Nakhoda, and others is necessary in Bushire to support or prove their claim for a refund of the fine and return of the arms, I would beg to be informed as soon as possible. Deposition of Ali-bin-Muhammad Mubarak, Nakhoda of the bum “ Teyser” of Koweit. I, Ali-bin-Muhammad, Nakhoda of the bum “ Teyser ”, state as follows:— The vessel left Koweit for Sabiliyat to load. On the 10th September, Saturday, was off the Turkish fort at Fao tacking up the river. At midnight two boats from the S.S. “ Muzafferi ” came and asked what I had. I said “ nothing ”. They then asked if I had any arms. I replied “ yes, we have twelve rifles for the eighteen men of the crew for the protection of the vessel, two are here and ten below”. They then searched the vessel and detained her three days and then brought her to Mohammerah. These arms were bought for the protection of the vessel, as she was bound for Yemen after loading, that is for the villages beyond Bas-el-Had and two years ago having no arms I was attacked and robbed there. I solemnly declare and am prepared to take oath that the above statement is true in every particular. Seal of Ali-bin-Muhammad.

India, a copy of a letter* from Captain Knox, Political Agent, Koweit, on the subject of the detention and search of a “ boom belonging to the Sheikh of Koweit. 2. Captain Knox s letter explains the case fully, and it is unnecessary for me to comment on it at length. In regard to the last paragraph, however, I beg to give the following remarks:— Acting on the complaint of Sheikh Mubarek sent to me by Captain Knox under cover of his letter No. 24, dated 14th September 1904 (a copy of which was sent to the Government of India with my letter No. 336, dated 24th September 1904), I approached Monsieur Waffelaert on the subject of the alleged seizure of a “ boom ” and a “ bellum ” belonging to the Sheikh of Koweit, and received the following reply:— “ As regards the “ boom ” and the ' bellum ” belonging to the Sheikh of Koweit, I beg to inform you that the “ Mozaffar ” has operated searchings in many dhows which she has come across, among which there have in fact been a “boom” and a “bellum” of which one was coming from Basrah, and the other going to Maniouhi; from what I have been able to gather from the Com mander none of these (that is of the 2 mentioned) appertain to the Sheikh of Koweit, as also appears from the one’s origin and the other’s destination.” I am again addressing the Director-General of Customs in view of the information in Captain Knox’s letter, which was unfortunately delayed a week by missing the mail steamer at Pao. 3. I have had the opportunity of conversing with Captain Knox on this subject, and I think that undoubtedly popular feeling has been much roused in Koweit by the high-handed proceedings on the part of the Persian Customs Department, and especially by the minute search of a boat belonging to the Sheikh. 4. I trust, therefore, that the Government of India will be pleased to take such action as they think fit to prevent such occurrences in future, and if necessary to cause the Customs Department to make some explanation and apology to the Sheikh for the behaviour of their employes on this occasion. 5. A copy of this communication has been sent to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. No. 32, dated the 26th September 1904, From— Captain S. G. Knox, I. A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General for Fare, Khuzistan, etc., Bushire. I have the honour to forward herewith four statements of the Nakboda and three sailors of the boom “ Musallini,” property of Sheikh Mubarek, which, it was alleged, was stopped by the servants of the Imperial Customs Department of Persia on or about the 16th instant. 2. The statements which were recorded separately present the usual discrepancies to he found when a number of ignorant witnesses, incapable of correct observation, are examined, but I see no reason to doubt the general,, h nf their story. Witness No. 2 is obviously unreliable, as it will be an easy matter to prove that the boom reached Nao and did not, as he asserts, return to Koweit at once without being searched. 3 I would venture to suggest that there are two matters on which it is sneciaily necessary to call for an explanation from the Customs Department. The reckless firing of ball cartridge into the air in the direction of Fao at such close quarters as the Shat-el-Arab must be a proceeding attended with con- siderable risk to person and property. As we have a telegraph station at Fao and Sheikh Mubarek’s followers and employes form, I understand, the bulk of the population of the place, on this score alone, apart from what ever protest, the Ottoman local authorities may see fit to present, I venture to think that we should be justified in protesting strongly against the action _ T ~ 4-t'Y'i n* Tl ■f'.O 4 . Further, I would ask that the Customs Department be called on for an explanation as to why Sheikh Mubarek’s private boom was searched at all. It is difficult to imagine that a well known boat like this, always on the xnn between Koweit and Fao, was not recognised by the crew of the Persian jolly boat even at a distance but, even granting this, after the explanation furnish ed by the crew of the boom, the minute search conducted over Sheikh Mubarek’s private boat can only be construed by me into a deliberate and purposeless insult. 5 . I have already explained in my letter No. 24, dated 14th instant, that popular feeling in Koweit is greatly excited over this incident and I have heard remarks, though not from any responsible quarter, asking why the English, who have been so long in the Gulf, permit such high-handedness on the part of the Persian Government. The report which has recently reached Koweit that an English man-of-war has appeared at the mouth of the Shatt and that the Belgians promptly decamped has been received with undisguis ed satisfaction. 6 . I have only to add that, with reference to Sheikh Mubarek’s letter of which a translation was forwarded under cover of my letter quoted in the preced ing paragraph at an interview I had with Sheikh Mubarek this morning, he in formed me that the mention of the bellum was based on incorrect information. The boom only was detained and searched. STATEMENT No. 1. Name ... ... ... ... Migrin. Father's name ... ... ... Ibrahim-bin-Sauad. Age ... ... ... ... 30 years. Occupation ... ... ... ... Nakhoda.

We entered the Shatt about 10 a.m. and saw the Belgian boat just before we entered the Eao creek. They were in the jolly boat belonging to the “ Mozaffar.” All the five men in her were Persians. There was not a single Christian. They shot at the boom four times at about 25 paces distance. They used ball cartridge. I said to them—“ This is the boom of Sheikh Mubarek taking the post. Do not shoot.” They replied—“We must search your boat.” They fired high through the sail and no one was hurt and we have sewn up the holes. They said—“ We are searching for arms ” and searched the entire boat. When they found nothing, they went away. They kept us waiting for the purposes of their search about an hour and then let us go. After that day, we have had no trouble with the Belgians. Dated Koweit, the 25th September 1904. STATEMENT No. 2. ••• ... ... Abdulla. • •• ... ... Ahmed. ••• ... ... 40 years. ••• ... ...

They were about 100 yards away or more. They shot ball but did us no harm. They hit nothing at all in the boat. The boom stopped and we all said—“ This is the boom of Sheikh Mubarek. It takes the post to Bao.” They said—“ We must search it.” They searched the boom and found nothing. When they found nothing, they went off to Gusbah and we went to Bao and anchored by the Sheikh’s house. This all happened in the afternoon and we were kept waiting from the afternoon until the evening over this business. Of the six men in the boat, one was a Belgian and the rest were Persians.

They did not hit the boat but they hit the sail. There were six men in the jolly boat. They were all of the same colour. They were none of them Persians but all Belgians. I did not say anything, but the other men in the boom said— “ This is the boom of Sheikh Mubarek. There are no arms in it.” The Belgians said—“We do not know Sheikh Mubarek. We have to search for arms.” They spoke to us in Arabic. Our boom stopped and the Belgians got in and lighted a candle and went through the cabin and hunted all over ; they found nothing. They went off and another jolty boat came and opened the Nakhoda’s box and found nothing in it. There were seven men in the second jolly boat. Theysearched among the sail and among the bundles of date wood and found nothing. Then that lot also went off to the man-of-war, the small one, belong ing to the Persians, We went off and anchored in the head of the creek. We were delayed about an hour.

The ships of our subjects of Koweit which travel to Basrah, great and small, carry arms according to the number in the boat, Nakhoda, steersman and crew; and that has been done for the past three years for self-protection from pirates, who are notorious in Basrah; and the officials of the Turkish Government and of the Euler of Mohammerah, Sheikh Khazel Khan, who protects the Shatt, see that and have not prevented them because of the neces sity, for the object of the people of the ships is the protection of themselves and their property. And now the Persian ship, in which are the Belgians, has occupied the Shatt between the buoy and Pao and has seized two vessels belonging to our subjects of Koweit and with them their arms, which were only in case of need they have annoyed them to the utmost and have seized the weapons and taken the boats to Mohammerah; and now news has reached us that they will also take the aforesaid boats to Bushire.

And as for the Belgians who seized the boats of our subjects in one of which was 10 rifles and in the other 24 rifles. 2 . As for the 10 rifles, they belonged to one of the people of Bussorah and the Nakhoda was not aware of what had been added and wrapped up by the owner. 3. And the 24 rifles were in two boxes belonging to one of the people of Zubair ; the barrels were in one box and the butts in another and equally the Nakhoda of the boom knew nothing about it except that there were two boxes containing goods. 4. And the boat of the Belgians seized them and fined the boom in which there were 10 rifles, 6,000 krans and released it. And the Belgians took the other boom to Bushire and imprisoned the Nakhoda and demanded from him krans 12,000. 5. Now the crew of the boom are my subjects and are under the protec tion of the Government. It is, therefore, necessary that the Belgians should hand over the boats either to the Consul of the British Government at Moham- merah or to the Resident in Bushire, and the punishment they deserve should be at your hands, for we also are prohibiting all our ships from the carrying of arms and restraining them ; but, in a case like this, it will be hard on them, for they do not know what tbe consignor loads and we remain watching events as they pass over us unjustly and have explained the state of affairs to you. Then let not what we have mentioned to you pass into (neglect—forgetfulness). These are matters injurious and may you remain safe.Ud-to.Zq. Telegram No. 83 C., dated the 28th November 1904.

In continuation of my letter No. 355, dated 14th October 1904, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, the following report on the subject of the search of a boom belonging to Sheikh Mubarek by the Persian Customs ship Muzaffer, On the 27th October I addressed Monsieur Waffelaert giving him a precis of the statements of the crew of the Sheikh’s boom and pointing out that the boom was apparently examined close to Fao and asking him to enquire into the matter.

Monsieur Waffelaert appears to be under the craft can be searched in any place on suspicion board. The Sheikh’s “ boom ’* plies between Koweit and Fao taking mails, bring ing firewood, etc., and even if it had firearms on board, it seems to me that the matter would lie between Sheikh Mubarek and the Turkish authorities. The action of the Muzaffer undoubtedly caused a great deal of irritation throughout the Arab Coast, and if such high handed actions on the part of the Customs continue, I think the Arabs may possibly attempt some kind of reprisals. If therefore the Government of India agree that indiscriminate searching of native craft in the Shat el Arab is contrary to International Law and custom, I trust that they will be pleased to take steps to prevent the Persian Customs Department from abusing the rights of search in this way. impression that any native of having “ contraband ” on Dated the 3rd November 1904.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. In confirmation of my telegram of the 14th November 1904,1 have the honour to state, for the information of the Government of India, that the Director-General of Customs has informed me that the Koweit dhow belons?- ing to Abdul Aziz bin Farah of Koweit, which has been detained here, will now be confiscated. Instructions have been issued by the Central Cus’toms Administration that the Nakhoda of the dhow will he imprisoned until the fine of 18,000 krans is paid, or until further orders. 2 . I submit that this is an exceedingly high-handed proceeding as there was absolutely no evidence brought forward at the investigation at Moham- merah {vide Mr. Consul McDouall’s report sent with my letter No. 341, dated 1 st October 1904) to show that the rifles were intended for Persia. 3. Monsieur 'Waffelaert also declares that “ all articles on board ” will also be confiscated under Article IV of the Act of the 5th Eamzan 1317. I have pointed out that only articles used to conceal the contraband goods should be confiscated, but Monsieur Waffelaert does not agree, and the question has been referred to Tehran. There were on board the dhow 4 bales of canvas belonging to one Haji Mukhbil of Bahrein consigned by him to Suleiman bin Mahmud-el Thakeir of Busreh, and it was in connection with a request made j by me that Eaji Mukhbil’s canvas should be returned, that the question of Article IV of the Act of 5th Bamzan came up.
