If two dollars only are charged, (vide Circular T 3730/14/378 of March 19th, 1937), this will be considerably less than the ten gold francs payable for similar visas granted to British subjects - a somewhat paradoxical situation. * We understand from the American Consulate here that a native of Bahrein travelling to the United States would be required to pay a ten-dollar fee.

Passport Office. /* /• . .7 A/l political Department. Would you kindly refer to your letter A.V. of the 21st July about Imperial Airways employees landing at Bahrain ? The question has been considered by the local political authorities and the upshot seems to be that a good deal of the visa trouble which has arisen at Bahrain could have been avoided if Imperial Airways servants regularly employed on the Alexandria-Kara,chi route had been provided with visas before leaving for Bahrain. These employees do not seem to have been in possession of visas because of a misapprehension on the part of the Consulate-General at Cairo as to their power to give visas for Bahrain and Kuwait. The Political Resident has taken up this point directly with the Consulate-General and he anticipates that in future Imperial Airways employees should have no difficulty in obtaining visas. As the men serving regularly on the Alexandria-Karachi section are stationed at posts where visas are (or should be) easily obtainable, and as one of their functions is to visit Bahrain where they must pass through the Bahrain Government control, the Political Resident is of opinion that the 6030 Wt 9128—P 18 10,000 4.37 IOP regulat ions /regulations need not normally be relaxed in their favour. We agree with this viv,w and suggest that you should inform Imperial Airways Ltd. accordingly Imperial Airways might also be told that visas will not be required either from the passengers or the crew in the case of a f or ce ma.j eure landing, and that should an employee not regularly employed on the Bahrain section of the line be required to halt at Bahrain to make way for a full fare-paying passenger, arrangements will be made locally to provide a visa on the lines set forth in Consular Instructions.

Dear Department, Your despatch No, 376 . (T 7843/195/378) of July 20th. Before we notify the Iraqi Government and His Majesty Consuls in Iraq of the reduction to one rupee of the visas granted to Iraqi nationals travelling to Bahrein and Koweit, we should like to make sure whether, as we suppose, the reduction is also to he made in respect of visas for the other Arab States in the Gulf. The reciprocity originally recommended (cf. paragraph 1 3^7 3 (ii) and (iii) of our despatch No. 135 of March 12th, 1936) was to affect ^nationals of the Arab States in the Gulf” and, throughout our correspondence with you on this subject (cf. your telegram No.17 (Saving) of March 15th last) we have assumed that visa-fees for all the Persian Gulf States would be affected. The sum of about £130, mentioned in our telegram (No. 31 Saving) of April 3rd last, included fees taken in respect of visas for all the Persian Gulf States, so that there is no question of any further loss by His Majesty’s Government if States other than Bahrain and Koweit are included and the Treasury need not presumably be consulted further. We hope very much that you intend the new arrangement to be extended to all the States in question. This seems to us to -be the only fair solution and we do not believe that the Iraqis will be satisfied with any thing less. May/ stern Department, FOREIGN OFFICE.ITn May we please have a very early reply (if possible by airmail) as we have already kept the Iraqis waiting nearly two years and should like to get the reduction in visa fees put into force with the least possible delay.

Dear Clauson, Will you kindly peruse the enclosed letter from Imperial Airways Limited. * It is of course clear from paragraph 4 of Foreign office circular No. T 1Q325/593/378. dated the £7th October 193E. that passengers who break their journey at any one of the air ports in the Persian Gulf must comply with the ordinary passport requirements regarding endorsements and_ visas* Xt may be^ however^ that the authorities in Bahrein are strictly interpreting the regulations in spite of the fact that the passengers referred to are members of the Company’s staff who are forced to break their journey at Bahrein on account of the Company’s economic considerations. Imperial Airways stated verbally that they trust that their letter will not be regarded in the nature of a complaint. but as the Company can never be certain whether a returning member of their staff will have to ^i ve + ^ r , his seat at Bahrein or not they would like some further advice on the matter• Yours sincerely.

For the attention of Mr. Courtico Sir, With reference to our conversation on the telephone, I am writing to advise you that members of our staff travelling through Bahrein have recently experienced a certain amount of difficulty when landing in that territory. I would explain that this particularly affects employees of the Company travelling from India to England who have been compelled to relinquish their seat on the aircraft on arriving in Bahrein in order to accommodate full fare paying passengers. In consequence as their stay in Bahrein was not foreseen visas were not previously secured and I understand that the Political Agent has viewed their landing with disfavour. Having regard to the special arrangements which are in force for the Arab States in connection with both transit passengers and staff of the Company, I should esteem it a great favour if you would be good enough to communicate with the Political Agent in Bahrein to request him to permit our staff to land In the territory without a visa in cases of force majeure.

What little we know of Mr. Lindt is not in his favour, although the report we have which suggests that he is socially insufferable need not necessarily be a serious disqualification. On the other hand Eastwood is not prepared to vouch for him, and if the circumstances of his proposed visit are not such as v/ould normally v/arrant the grant of facilities, I fear that we cannot recommend that he should be treated exceptionally. A copy of your correspondence with Eastwood has been sent to our Consul at Berne to whom, as you have already suggested, Mr. Lindt might be advised to apply for the necessary information.

Lindt. Visas for the Arab States in the Persian Gulf are granted by ILL. Consular Officers abroad, but rieas for persons other than British subjects are not granted without prior reference to the local lolitioal Authorities. I should think tint probably the best plan will be lor Lindt to apply to our Consulate at Berne, but we are consulting the Foreign Office on the guest ion# In the meantime perhaps you would care to inform Lindt that you have enquired as to the proper procedure and will let him know as soon as possible. I should perhaps add that facilities fox travellers in that part of the world are exceedingly meagre, and I think visas are not generally granted except to persons who are actually eoixig to stay with people or are golag to take up a job.

March 9th 1937. Dear Eastwood, I wonder if you are still in London, or away in the Outposts again 'by this time ? We as usual are all over the place - at present in Berlin, making plans for a contract with German and Swiss newspapers for a trip to the Persian Gulf. I am sorry to be such a bore, but if you are still at home might I trouble you for a spot of information, as Switzerland has absolutely no representatives in that part of the world ? We want to visit Oman, Keweit and the Barein Islands. As these three are in treaty relations v/ith Great Britain, could you tell me whether one has to obtain any special visa or permit for entering them ? Or if this does not come under your department, perhaps you could tell me to v/hom I should apply for such information ? I should be awfully grateful if you would let me know.

Dear Dunlop If the subject of visa fees between Iraq and the Persian Gulf States is not within your province, will you please pass to the right quarter, these questions arising out of Bland’s letter of the 11th December, 1936. (T 17559/1876/378). 2. Our first question is, how much revenue we are asked to give up? We are not anxious to give away revenue in these times, and if the amount involved is at all considerable, we may wish to consider whether it is possible to narrow the field of concession. But I am not sure that I have the facts right. 3. Am I right in thinking that subjects of the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms obtaining a visa for Iraq pay one rupee in Koweit and Bahrein and ten gold francs elsewhere? If so, is it not possible that the Iraqi demand for reciprocity would be met by allowing Iraqis visas for 1 rupee for Koweit and Bahrein alone without altering the fee payable by subjects of the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms obtaining visas elsewhere, or those payable b^ Iraqis visiting Persian Gulf States other than Koweit and Bahrein? 4. .L.M. Dunlop, Esq. , Foreign Office,4. We are not aware of any other cases in which visas (apart from transit visas) are given for less than 10 gold francs.

From The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. To The Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office, London, S.W.1. Dated Simla, the 6th August, 1936. Description of Bahrain as Iranian territory on passports issued hy Foreign Consuls in Bombay. Sir, I am directed to state that some cases have 'been 'brought to the notice of the.Governraent of India in which foreign consular officers in Bombay, while endorsing the passports of their nationals for Bahrein, have shown Bahrain as a part of Iran. In a recent case the Bushire Residency brought to the notice of the Government of India that the Chinese Consul in Bombay had given such an endorsement on a Chinese passport of a Chinese subject who v/ent to Bahrain. A visa for Bahrain was then given on this passport by the Passport Officer to the Government of Bombay. The Government of India asked the Bombay Government to bring it to the notice of the Chinese Consul that Bahrain was in no way connected with Iran. In reply* the Government of Bombay have suggested that a general notice should be issued to all foreign consuls in Bombay to the effect that Bahrain is an independent Arab Shaikhdom and is neither geographically nor otherwise connected with Iran and it should not be shown ao on passports 2. If the Government of India should issue a circula te all foreign consuls as proposed, the question would arise2, nr the Iranian Consul should he included in the distribution list. It seems probable that on receipt of such a circular the Consuls of States other than Iran would make enquiries from the Iranian Consul, and if he had not been included in the distribution list, this fact would arouse suspicion in the minds of other Consuls as to the genuine nature of our claim that Bahrain was not a part of Iran. It would therefore seem necessary to include him. In either case therefore the action proposed would tend to force the issue and raise the vexed question of sovereignty over Bahrain. 3. The Government of India are therefore inclined to the view that this course should not be adopted, and, after consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, would propose the following alternative action. Entry into Bahrain cannot be secured on a foreign passport without the visa of a British passport authority acting on behalf of the Ruler of Bahrain. The Government of India suggest that instructions should be issued to all British passport authorities issuing such visas prohibiting the grant of visas on foreign passports which show Bahrain as in any way connected with Iran. These instructions might suitably be included in paragraph 9 of the Foreign Office draft circular received with the India Office letter No.P. 2.1933/35 &gt; dated the 1st April, 1935, and communicated to His Majesty’s Consular Officers abroad. Individual cases of such refusal would be brought to the notice of the foreign consular officer concerned, a course which would not be likely to raise the general issue to the same degree as would a circular addressed to all foreign consular officers. Should the Iranian consular authorities India or elsewhere then seek to grant Iranian vi^as on the passports of nationals of other States for Bahrain, thus claiming3. Bahrain as a part of Iran, such a document would not he regarded as valid or as sufficient to obtain ingress to Bahrain. U- The Government of India would he grateful if they could kindly he favoured with the views of His Majesty 1 s Government on these suggestions. I have, etc., (Sd) O.K.

Dear Department, Please see our despatch No. 135 of March 12th last, about Iraqi visa fees at Koweit and Bahrain. We are still awaiting the authorisation asked for in paragraph 3 to reply on certain lines to two notes from the Iraqi Government. We have now heard from the Political Resident at Bushire that, with the approval of the Government of India, he has issued instructions to the Political Agents at Koweit and Bahrain to charge the full fee on passports other than those of Persian Gulf nationals. We can thus safely include the first of the three points which we suggested including in our reply to the Iraqi Government (cf. paragraph 3 of the despatch under reference). As regards points (ii) and (iii), may we have your observations soon, so as to avoid undue delay in answering the Ministry? Yours ever, CPIANO ERY. ■ a r Department, ’°reign office.f,z MEMORANDUM. Before 1932 it had apparently been the practice to levy visa fees at the rate of one rupee in Koweit and Bahrein from subjects of the Persian Gulf Arab Sheikhdoms proceeding to Iraq. The matter was discussed in 1932 with the Iraqi Director of the Department of Passports, Residence and Nationality, who informed the High Commission that the Iraq Government had no objection to the continuance of this practice, but suggested that reciprocity should be introduced. This request for reciprocity was overlooked at the time, and the standard rate of 10 gold francs is charged on visas for Iraqi nationals desiring to visit the Persian Gulf States. The Iraqi Government have now objected to the grant S at Koweit of visas for entry into Iraq for so small a fee as one rupee. They suggest that this encourages smuggling. This suggestion is absurd since (a) the smugglers between Koweit and Iraq are chiefly Iraqi subjects, (b) obviously a smuggler would in any case avoid getting a visa. It may be that the Iraqi Government wish to use this objection merely as a lever for obtaining a reduction of the visa fees for Iraqis visiting the Arab Sheikhdoms, and it has accordingly been proposed by H.M. Ambassador, Bagdad, after consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, that he should reply to the Iraqi Government to the effect that H.M.G. are now proposing to introduce reciprocity in the matter and that in these circumstance it is hoped the Iraqi Government will withdraw their objection. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is very strongly of opinion, and the Ambassador agrees, that it would cause considerable hardship on subjects of the A business connections with Iraq Sheikhdoms who have close in respect of date farming, etc., if the visa fee was increa^edZ/ 1 £t u^dr \ 2 .

It appears, therefore, that the only hope olT retaining the one rupee fee for “ A i, r )A Ik if’-v’' subjects,ef the Arab Sheikhdoms is to offer to introduce \ regj^rucrl^ ^sTTHTrAmbassacTor suFg Although the reduction to one rupee of visa fees charged in Iraq would be contrary to Standing Consular Instructions there seem to be the following reasons for not regarding this objection as insuperable:- (l) It is particularly desirable on political grounds to avoid any unnecessary friction between Iraqi and Koweiti interests. There is already considerable tension between the Sheikh of Koweit and the Iraqi authorities and the Sheikh would certainly feel considerably aggrieved if a substantial financial burden were put upon his subjects who have to go to Iraq in the course of their business. At the present time when it is hoped to reach an amicable i solution of the longstanding question of the Sheikh of Koweit’s date gardens in Iraq it would be most unfortunate » if the Sheikh were given cause to feel that H.M.G. were not protecting the interests of his subjects who have business in Iraq. (2) In issuing visas for the Arab Sheikhdoms H.M. Consular Officers in Iraq are acting not on behalf of H.M.G. but on behalf of the Rulers of the Arab Sheikhdoms. (3) The position regarding the Arab Sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf is probably unique and the present proposal, if adopted, can hardly constitute an inconvenient precedent. (4) The fees in question are not paid into Imperial Revenues but to the Government of India.In any further communication this subject, please quote T 9511/1876/378. 1 address— iot to any person by name t to— 1 The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.l.

X am to observe that the Political Residents at Bahrein and Koweit in effect grant visas for Iraq as agents of the Iraqi. Government and if it is indeed the desire of the latter to raise to the standard figure of 10 gold francs the fee charged for visas granted to natives of Koweit and Bahrein proceeding to Iraq ; there would appear to he no grounds upon which His Majesty's Government could refuse to comply with a request from the Iraqi Government to this effect. g. xt is possible, however, that the real desire of the Iraqi authorities is to obtain for their nationals travelling to Koweit and Bahrein visas at the fee of 1 rupee and that the proposal to raise to 10 gold francs the fee for visas granted to Koweitis proceeding to Iraq is intended to bri g pressure to bear upon His Majesty's Government to that end. 4/ Under-Secretary of State, India Office.4 In this connexion I am to explain that the fees V levied hy His Majesty's Consular Officers for affixing visas to foreign passports are fixed by Order in Council and that the Secretary of State has no authority to vary them except as a measure of reciprocity in the case of the nationals of countries which charge a fee higher than the prescribed fee of 10 gold francs* It would therefore be necessary to obtain the sanction of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, and possibly a new Order-in-Council, if it were decided that, on political grounds, a reduction of the visa fees for Iraqi nationals travelling to Koweit and Bahrein was desirable* 5. The view held by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and supported by the Secretary of State for India is that an increase to 10 gold francs of the visa fee for natives of Koweit travelling to Iraq would cause considerable hardship to the persons concerned ? and Mr* Sden is himself of the opinion that it is desirable to remove 7 if possible,any obstacles to the improvement of relations between Iraq and Koweit* He is therefore, prepared to approach the Treasury with a view to the reduction, on political grounds as a measure of reciprocity, of the visa fees levied by Majesty's Consular Officers in Iraq to Iraqi nationals desirous of travelling to Kov/eit and Bahrein* 6. I am to enquire whether the Marquess of Zetland concurs in the action proposed, and in this event, to request Mr ♦/Mr. Eden may 'be furnished with such further information on the subject as would appear to support an application to the Treasury in this sense.

T ^45/187 6 / 378, in regard to the grant of visas for l\(Kc^ in Koweit and Bahrein. 2. The Marquess of Zetland considers that whilst the Iraq Government have a justifiable complaint on the ground that a fee of only Re.1 has been charged for visas granted in Koweit and Bahrein to 7^4 .44 persons other than subjects of th-€H# States, their statement that the small fee charged encourages smugglers is hardly V tenable in view of the considerations saLsagI by Colonel Fowle in para. 2 of his letter of the 19th February. His Lordship is moreover impressed by the a.rguments advanced by Colonel Powle and the Political Agent, Koweit, that the raising of the fee charged for visas to Koweiti* »ahi-g±rrio would cause great hardship; t1rie retention of the practice whereby the Political Agents at Koweit and Bahrein grant visas to subjects on the payment of one rupee, ^t he f*«=* 4to8 _ a&gt;i:w ^ erT ^ reciprocal treatment^granted to Iraq subjects desirous of visiting JWicA-i.ui Jlnnrem. 4599 5000 2.36His Lordship appreciates the difficulties mentioned in para.2 of the Foreign Office letter under reference, but he suggests for the considera.tion of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that it would be possible to make an exception in the present instance without involving a breach of the general principle^,because when granting visas to Iraq subjects 'tr Ard desirous of visiting Ko wa i tr- d 1 hahr e in H.M. Consular Officers are not acting as such but as the visa-issuing authorities of the Sheikhs concerned. His Lordship therefore hopes that Mr.Secretary Eden on reconsideration of the matter will see his way to instructing Sir Archibald Clark-Kerr to proceed along the lines indicated in para.3 of Bagdad Despatch of the 12th March, IT 0 .135, with which His Lordship is in full agreement.

The Ministry for Foreign Affairs present their compliments to His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy, Bagdad, and, in continuation of the Ministry’s note No. C/3463 dated 22nd December, 1935, regarding fees for entry visas for Iraq granted by the British Political Agency, Kuwait, have the honour to state : 1 . It appears that the British Political Agencies at Kuwait and Bahrain have been granting (? travel) documents and certificates of identity endorsed with entry visas for Iraq against a fee of 75 fils, not only to subjects of Kuwait but also to persons of various nationalities. Th© I inietry give below the names and nationalities of a number of persons who were granted such documents : (a) Tueuf Kuwaiti ibn Ya’qub, an Iranian merchant, entered Iraq from K u wait on 16th / ugust, 1935, on an Iranian passport No. 191 dated 3/7/1312 issued by the i uhammerah (Khoma Shahr) Hadhmiyah, bearing an entry visa for Iraq No# 1463 dated 12th August, 1936, granted by the British Political Agent, Kuwait. (b) Mulla Khudhaiylr al Mulla Ismail, an Iranian, entered Iraq, coming from Kuwait, on 15th August, 1935, on an Iranian passport No. 719 dated 9th Bahman, 1312, issued by the Iranian Consul, Muhammerah (Khorm Shahr), beard ng an entry visa for Ip&amp;Q. Ho. 1163 dated 23rd July, 1936, granted by the British political Agent, Kuwait* (e) Mulla Ibrahim ibn Haklat, an Iranian, entered Iraq, coning from Kuwait, on 12th September, 1934, on a laiBaea-paaeer •°* 1681 dated 8th September, 1934, issued by the political gent, Kuwait, (d) Bibi bint ’Abbas, an Iranian, entered Iraq, coming Bahrain, on 3rd April, 1934, on a laissez-paaser Wo. 119 dated 28th March, 1936, issued by the political Agent, l ahrain.- 2 - (e) Mudinah Mnt Khalaf, an Iranian, entered Iraq, on 27th March, 1935, on a Xalssez-paaser No. 105 dated 20th March, 1955, issued hy the Political Agent, Bahrain. (f) 1 All ibn Ibrahim, an Iranian, entered Iraq, coming from Bahrain, on 27th March, 1935, on a laissez-passer No. 103 dated 10th March, 1936, issued by the Political Agent, Bahrain. He was accompanied by two women, one about 50 years old and the other about 65, together with 3 infants (Double the fee actually collected by the Agency should have been collected, as the person in question was accompanied by two adults). (g) 1* Lewis Cardet, a Portuguese Indian, entered Iraq, coming from Bahrain, on 19th December, 1934, on a laissez-passer Ho. 429 dated 15th December, 1934, issued by the Political Agent, Bahrain. (h) Manuel Kishanwood Silna, a British Indian, entered Iraq, coming from Bahrain, on 19th December, 1934, on a laissez-paaser No* 430 dated 15th December, 1934, issued by the Political Agent, Bahrain. (i) * Abdullah ibn Ahmad, a Kuwaiti, entered Iraq, coming from Kuwait, on a Certificate of Identity No. 407 dated 23rd April, 1935, granted by the Political Agent, Kuwait. 2. It has been noticed that the majority of persons to whom such visas were granted entered Iraq for the purpose of visiting the Holy Shrines* Hence their passports are much like pilgrim passes, issued by certain Indian authorities to Indians visiting Iraq for the pilgrimage, whereas political Agents in Kuwait and Bahrain are not aut iorised to issue such passes, because : (a) The procedure under which pilgrim passes are issued was agreed to following correspondence exchanged at the time between the Iraqi Government and the British Residency, Bagdad, according to which power to issue such passes was confined to certain Indian authorities, and the question of the said procedure covering -uli territories under British influence was not raised. (b)(Id) It is feared that the issue of such passes and the grant of visas thereon against a trifling fee not exceeding 75 fils might open the way for the entry into Iraq of fugitives and persons who have adopted smuggling as a profession* S, In view of the above, and of the fact that the persons in possession of such travel documents are recognised natives of well-known Governments, there is nothing to justify their entry into Iraq on other than ordinary passports visaed valid for entry into Iraq in accordance with procedure* 4* The Ministry will be glad if the esteemed Embassy will be so good as to communicate the above to the British Political Agencies in Kuwait and Bahrain, and inform the Ministry of the result of the action to be taken on the subject* The Ministry avail themselves of this opportunity to express their highest consideration and esteem* Britannic Majesty’s Embassy, BAGDAD.dXlG Xo S\XX*6 ill. .i:'J£l£^(i6i&lt;jL DOSPO-icll al 1A/3/S6.

I agree with Colonel Dickson f s views. 3.- 2 3* Colonel Dickson further points out that to raise the rates of Kuwait visa fees to 10 gold francs would cause very great hardship to several thousands of poor Kuwaitis who proceed to Iraq every year to find work as date pickers, and in other directions* In this also I concur with Colonel Dickson’s views* 4 , Personally therefore I see no valid reason for the request of the Iraq Government that the Kuwait visa fee should he raised, and strong reasons against it. I am of opinion, however, that the suggestion put forward hy the Iraqi Govern ment for reciprocity of treatment (vide Bagdad despatch of 7th September 1952 quoted above) is eminently reasonable, and should if possible be adopted* I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Political Agent, Kuwait# I have the honour to be, Sir, Your moat obedient, humble servant, (3d) t* C* POULB* Lieut-Colonel* Political .Resident in the ersian Gulf*KT ** u fomim Affairs to %hm Mlmlatty of l : oraign Affair* on thm linos that /ou suggest {of. agr 4ospatoh Ho, im of tod^ 1 # date to the foreign Office, of *iil*&amp; m oopy la an- oloa#4 heroin * I oonsl4or t now#ir©r» that in now of tl:ia facts mmt out In paragraph U mboim, it la doalmhi# that the .'olltlcal ,^@nta mt Ihiwalt and Bahrain should ho Inwtruetwd to oems# forthwith froa granting visas at lass thim the standard rate of 10 Hold Bmmm to any 'but the inhabitants (W whloh wust he understood, the nationals} of Arab Ht&amp;bM in the Persian Gulf.

(a) Up to t^4 time of writing the Shaikh c£ Kuwaiti launch whlc/was seized early in December at Fao and full duty demanded,6n it, had not been released, even though necessary representations had been made by H.M. 1 s Ambassador to the Iraq. Government. The matter was dealt with in separate report. The launch is now said to be at Basra. (b) There were rumours at the end of December that the Iraq Government were preparing to try and force Kuwaitis entering Iraq, to pay 10 gold francs for their visas, and had already approached the British Embassy in this connection. The move, if true, can only be regarded as another unfortunate attempt to hurt Kuwait, seeing that on an average a hundred persons visit Basra per month during normal times while during the summer months several thousand women and children cf the poorest classes regularly visit the Shaikhs date gardens in Iraq both to get away from the intense heat here and to find employment as date pickers and packers. It will be quite impossible for this latter class to afford ten gold francs for their visas. For the information of those reading this at a distance, it has been the custom for many years now or this Agency to charge only Be.l/- on all persons proceeding from Kuwait to Basra as well as to India and other Arabian ports, and the Shaikh-s steady policy has been to allow nationals of such Arab States more especially Iraqis to enter Kuwait on payment of the equivalent^of^BUnfortunately the British Consular authorities in Iraq would seem to have been steadily charging Iraqis proceeding to Kuwait Rs.7/8/- or the Fils equivalent, which may have given rise to the story that the Iraq Government were now out to retaliate. Clearly and in the interest of friendly relations and intercourse, e specially to assist the very poor date packers and pickers, and other poor travellers who visit Fao, the visa charges for Iraqis visiting Kuwait should be reduced to the equivalent of Re.l/~especially too as the Kuwait Government desires this. Ror can the Iraq Government claim that the increased visa which they apparently want Kuwaitis to pay, will affect smuggling, if this is their intention, for those engaged in smuggling are Iraqi tribesmen who never have passports of any kind, and enter the town, as desert men pure and simple. These smugglers naturally never come near this Agency but disappear into the desert again when they have got what they want. (c) On the plea of tightening up anti smuggler activities, it is also reported that travellers proceeding by car to Basra, are no longer able to take their car, into Iraq, after registering it at the Customs House at Zubair for the fee of Rs.2/8/-, as heretofore. It is said that the traveller now must take his car under police escort, to the Central Customs House at Basra, and there give money security that he has no intention of selling the car. How this measure can afiect the smuggling fraternity*s activities it is difficult to see. Steps are being taken to find out exactly what the rule is in this respect, though on the surface it would seem that law abiding travellers are going to be penalized, for the sins of the wily smuggler. 241.

The Government of India have accepted the Political Resident’s recommendations (see P.Z. 6943/35) and the Sheikh himself has now agreed to the proposed change in procedure. 2. The reasons advanced by the Political Resident for allowing the Sheikh to issue his own passports (see paragraphs 4 and 5 of his letter P.Z. 5103) are convincing. It is therefore submitted that in writing to the Foreign Office we should support this proposal as well as the minor drafting alterations suggested. 3. The Political Resident’s suggestions in para.9 of his letter, P.Z.5103, may however prove difficult to bring into effect. It would clearly be a simplification if all British subjects were charged a flat rate for visas, but the Foreign Office may find technical difficulties in agreeing to this. I understand that Consular Officers under Foreign Office control are prevented by their consular regulations from charging less than 10 gold francs for a visa.* We might, however, invite the Foreign Office to state their views on the suggestion. 4. Para.10 of the Political Resident’s letter,P.Z. 5103 mentiencd is somewhat obscure, and is presumably based on the assumption that the suggestion above (i.e.that |f a flat rate should be charged for all British subjects) would be adopted.

British passports and emergency certificates may be issued and endorsed in the ordinary course in the case of British-protected persons who are natives of the Aden Protectorate (including Hadramis, i.e., natives of the Hadramaut), and who are not seamen following the sea. Instructions in respect of the latter were issued in the Circular despatch from this Department T 7912/473/378 of the 2nd August, 1932. * The territories of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman include Gwadar. 7 S 33 11247—99 * 3. His Majesty’s consular officers should recognise Bahraini and Muscati passports bearing the signature and seal of the respective Political Agents in those States/ and also certificates of identity issued by the Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla (part of the Aden Protectorate), and should extend their good offices to the holders. Such good offices may include the endorsement, at the discretion of the consular officer, of -r . Bahraini and Muscati passports, and certificates of identity issued by the Sultan of Shehr and Mukalla, for travel to countries not already specified therein, and the grant of visas for travel to British territory. 4. Holders of Koweiti certificates of identity signed and sealed by the Political Agent, and of Trucial certificates of identity signed and sealed by the Residency 'Agent at Sharjah, or, m the case of Qatar, of certificates signed and sealed by the Political Agent at Bahrain, should be similarly treated. 5. Emergency certificates on the lines of that given as Annex 5 to Chapter XXVI ^ of the Consular Instructions may when required be granted to natives of the Trucial Sheikhdoms and Qatar who are in possession of documents establishing their nationality issued by the rulers of those States, and duly endorsed and sealed by the Residency Agent at Sharjah, or in the case of Qatar by the Political Agent at Bahrain. 6. In the event of persons without papers claiming to be subjects of the rulers of Bahrain, Koweit, or Muscat and Oman or of Qatar or any of the Trucial Sheikhs, and applying for travel facilities, they should be invited to fill up a suitably drafted application form. These forms in the case of the Trucial Sheikhdoms should be forwarded to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; in the case of Qatar to the Political Agent at Bahrain; and in other cases to the Political Agents in the States concerned. Passports will, when appropriate, be issued by the authorities concerned and forwarded to the consular officer for delivery to the applicant. If, however, the applicant desires only to return to his place of origin, and time is pressing, telegraphic reference may be made, at the expense of the applicant, to the Political Agent concerned, or in the case of a native of a Trucial Sheikhdom to the Political Resident, and on receipt of the confirmatory reply emergency certificates may be issued, valid only for the single journey. 7. Subject always to standing instructions, visas may be granted to foreigners, other than British subjects and British-protected persons, desiring to proceed to any of the above-mentioned territories, but only after reference to the appropriate local British authorities. The requirement of visas for entry into these territories applies also to Iraqis. In cases of persons, either British subjects or foreigners, proceeding to two or more of the territories, a separate visa and a separate fee will be required in respect of each territory. It should be noted that persons of“A subiect of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman.” An emergency certificate on the lines of that given as Annex o to Chapter XXVI of the Consular Instructions would he the only document issued to them by His Maiesty’s passport or consular officers. For such emergency certificates, whether issued by officers residing outside the Gulf or at posts in the Gulf, Fee No. 79 ( 65 . 6 ^.) should be charged; endorsements should be charged for at the rate of 25. In cases of destitution, however, these fees may be waived. 11 . Visa fees for foreigners, other than British subjects, proceeding to any of the territories named above, should be levied according to the nationality of the applicant, on the same scale as British visa fees, except in the case of nationals of countries with which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have concluded visa abolition agree ments, when the standard fees of 10 gold francs and 1 gold franc for ordinary and transit visas respectively should be levied. 12. His Majesty’s consular officers should bear in mind that, in carrying out the above instructions, they will be acting m a dual capacity. In granting visas to natives of the territories referred to in paragraph 1 (ii) and (iii) above for travel in the British Empire, they will be acting in their normal capacity. In granting visas to British and other foreign nationals for travel to those territories, and in issuing to, or endorsing travel documents for, natives of these States, they will be acting on behalf of the States concerned, although the fees chargeable for their services will be levied by means of consular fee stamps and credited to the Foreign Office in the customary manner, 13. This circular despatch does not affect any procedure usual in the case of persons travelling to and from Saudi Arabia on special pilgrim passes issued by the authorities of their country of origin. Such passes do not necessarily of themselves constitute evidence of nationality, although the particulars contained in them may be useful in considering applications by the holders for passports or emergency certificates for purposes other than the pilgrimage. 14. This circular despatch is in substitution of the circular despatches from this Department T 2117/593/378 of the 10th March, 1932, and T 7205/818/378 of the 16th August, 1934, which are hereby cancelled. 15.

Could you please refer to your letter No*P.Z&lt;&gt;176/35 of the 9th January 1935 on the subject of visas for the Trueial Coast* 2* The position is that before the issue of Foreign Office Circular NooT 2117/593/378 of 10th March 1932, nobody, whether British or Foreign, could visit the Trucial Coast without special permission from the Resident* By this Circular, however, we have put the Shaikhdoms of the Trucial Coast on the same terms as the other Shaikhdoms: Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait, for which foreigners cannot obtain visas without \ reference to us, but for which British subjects can get visas, (which cannot well be refused them by the Consular authority concerned as long as they are respectable individuals) without any such reference. In other words the Foreign Office Circular in question, in the paradoxical way in which things happen in the Gulf, while intended to strengthen our hands, and actually doing so as regards foreigners in general visiting the Arab Coast as a whole, has weakened it with regard to the Trucial Coast* 3. Neither the Trucial Coast towns,(we do not allow imperial Airways passengers to enter Sharjah town), still le^ the interior, are really fit places for casual foreigners or British subjects, to visit or reside or travel in, unless in special circumstances. We cannot from the practical point of view adopt the 'at your own risk' attitude, since in ^e case / ►G*Laithwaite £squire,C*I.^*j The India Office, LoikLon* I licase of anything unpleasant happening to a British or Foreign traveller the onus of taking some action rests on us. I would like therefore as far as the Trucial Coast is concerned to get back to the old position that nobody, whether British or Foreign, should visit it without special permission from the Resident. 4 . In order to effect this a fresh clause would presumably have to be inserted in the Foreign Office Circular quoted above and worded something as follows: Neither British, nor Foreign, subjects can visit the 7 Umm al waiwain, Arab States of: Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Dibai, Aj manSharjah and Ras al Khaimah, without special permission from the Resident, Persian Gulf, to whom applications should be made by intending travellers through the nearest British authorities ♦ 5 . we can meet without difficulty any complaints from British subjects over this restriction. If any foreigner is refused permission, and complains through his (or her!) Govern ment, we are on strong ground in pointing out that owing to local conditions residence, or travel, in those areas is not safe for the casual traveller, and that owing to our special position in those areas, we have a measure of responsibility for the safety of foreign travellers. If tnis restriction were imposed each case would of course be considered on its merits and any special circumstances taken into account. I quite realise that in these days, when the whole of the Arab Coast is being opened up, it is much more difficult than formerly to prevent travellers visiting it. _p + o letter to Loch, and, with I am sending a copy of this xeuner copy of your letter, to Metcalfe.

We concur in your view that the Government of India are not bound by the rates laid down in Foreign Office Consular Instructions so far as the levy of fees for visa, etc. between these Principalities and India is concerned, but in the interests of uniformity it has been thought better not to make any reduction in the scale of fees, without consultation with the Foreign Office. 2 . As regards Bahrain, there seems to have been a misunderstanding. We did indeed accept the suggestion Ox the Foreign Office that the reduced fee of Re.l/- should be charged from all British subjects proceeding to Bahrain, Dut anticipating that further orders on the Government of 10 / India letter No.l63-G/32, dated the 2 nd December 1932 , would he received, did nothing to give effect to the reduced rate.

Sir, I AM directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to inform you that the Persian Government have refused to grant visas for Persia upon, or otherwise to recognise, British passports which have at any time been endorsed for travelling to Koweit or Bahrain. 2. In order to avoid the restrictions upon the movements of British subjects in the Near East which would otherwise result from the attitude of the Persian Government, you should in future refrain from endorsing for Koweit or Bahrain the passports of British subjects who contemplate travelling also, whether immediately or at any future date, to Persia. A person desirous of visiting Koweit and/or Bahrain as well as Persia should be advised to travel via Basra and to apply to His Majesty’s Consul there for the necessary facilities. Should this course be impracticable, you are authorised to grant a separate and temporary passport, to be held in addition to the ordinary passport, valid only for the specific journey to Bahrain and/or Koweit, and to be surrendered to a British consular officer as soon as possible after its object has been achieved. This passport should on no account be produced to any Persian authorities. 3. Persons holding valid passports which already bear endorsements for Bahrain or Koweit who wish to travel to Persia should be advised s Majesty’s Consular Officers authorised to issue or renew passports.

In such cases the usual endorsement fee No. 78 should be charged, the issue of the special passport being regarded as equivalent to endorsement. The usual fee No. 76 should be charged for the issue of new passports in the circumstances described in paragraph 3 of this circular. 5.

Political Department. On P.Z. 1218/31 the Foreign Office in their letter dated 26th February, 1931, proposed to embody in a general circular instructions for the guidance of His Majesty’s Consular and Passport Control Officers in issuing travel documents for persons proceeding to, and for natives of, certain British Protectorates and certain Arab States. As regards the fees to be charged for such visas, they suggested that Consular Officers should be informed that fees should be levied according to the nationality of the applicant on the same scale as British visa fees, except in the case of nationalises- of countries with which H.M.G. in the United Kingdom had concluded visa abolition agreements, when the standard fees of 10 gold francs and one gold franc for ordinary and transit visas respectively, should be u levied. To this the Government of India agreed in their letter of 7th September, 1931, (P.Z. 5932/31). In due course the Foreign Office circular appeared on the 10th March, 1932, (copy at P.Z. 1728/32). In para. 8 it lays down that the fees payable by British subjects proceeding to the territories in question shall be one and 10 gold francs respectively for transit and ordinary visas, but no mention is made of the lees be paid by subjects of these territories proceeding iC w to Brit ^ X ish territory (including I ndia )./ What fees were charged by the Government of India before the issue of circular is not clear from the papers, but, at any 'tw C 26 -l 6000 3/34 rate in the case of Bahrein, they had already (see their letter to the Government of Bombay dated 17th February, 1931 fees to be charged for visas be 'the standard fees of one and 10 gold francs, (and had re , flagged, P.3. 1412/31) issued instructions that the from India to Bahrein should spectively, for transit and ordinary visas',Bahrein Koweit Trucial Coast Muscat (including Gwadur) lo gold francs Re. 1 Re.l Nil Nil Re.l Re.l After the Foreign Office circular had issued the Government of India appear to have felt themselves 5 vsCo 1 ^ hound hy it, for before adopting Col. FowlaJs suggestion, ^made in 193R, that visa fees for journeys between India and Bahrein should be reduced to Re.l, they referred it home for approval (see P.l. 3001/32). Incidentally, although the Foreign Office agreed (on P.Z. 6765/32j^hat the reduction might be made by the Government of India without amending the F.O. circular of the 10th March, 1932, the Government of India appear still to be charging the old fee of 10 gold francs for ordinary visas for Bahrein. The reason for this is not cleax (the G. of I. are being asked d.o.). Actually/ had added - although the visas were granted on behalf 0 the Bahrein Government - that the fees should be credited to Indian revenues TT as in the case of the visa service for Iraq')- These instructions v/ere given before the F.O. had made their proposal at P.Z. 1218/31. The fees charged at present, and the Government of India’s proposals, are set out in the following table: - Yisa fees charged by Government of India for journey between the States shown and India, and the modificatio now proposed. Present Rates . Proposed Rates , from India to India From India to Tr s ns dia.Paper, Department. Actually there appears to be no reason why the G. of I. should feel bound to adopt the fees laid down in the circular. The question of the visa fees to be charged seems to be a matter of Indian domestic concern at least as far as journeys to India are concerned. The Government of India seem to recognise this though Muscat appears to be in a rather special position since the Political Agent there is also a P.0. Consular Officer. It will therefore be necessary to ask the P.0, to give instructions in the case of Muscat. As regards journeys from India to these territories the fees are (theoretically) charged on behalf of the Sheikhs. It therefore seems desirable to secure P.0, concurrence to their reduction. It is accordingly proposed to refer the whole question of the G. of I.'s proposal tabulated above to the P.0, for their approval. Draft letter to P.0, and draft d.o. to Government of India are submitted. ^ ft ^ o-d 5K. i ? ^ . £e^ ?J ['^^ s - 3/34I have spoken to Mr. Shepherd about this and he agrees that strictly speaking India is entitled to vary its visa fees without reference to the Foreign Office, hut he would prefer, for the sake of comity, that India should, wherever possible, maintain uniformity with Foreign Office charges. Since our view of the position has been put to the Foreign Office in the d.o. letter at P.Z. 5048/32 dated 14th October, 1932, and they have never challenged it he has no strong objection to the attention of the Government of India being drawn to it demi-officially as in the draft letter to Mr. Metcalfe below.P.z. 5148/34. \ 4 raft Paper.

Will you please refer to your telegram No.577 of the 19th July 1933. 2. A protest against the high charge now levied for visas for the Gulf ports has recently heen made hy the Karachi Indian Merchants T Association. 3. You will remember that Sir Hugh Biscoe recommend- jJ /L Q(1 in 1932 that the fee for journeys between Gulf ports and IrLdla sllould5 ln future,, be Re.l/-. His proposal was supported here hut no decision appears to have heen taken a s yet hy the Foreign Office. There seems however Pi-to he no reason why the Government of India should not themselves do something to remove the disahility now SU ff ere (i tiy Indian traders and the position has therefore heen re-examined. It seems that the Government of Indio., if they thought it advisable to do so, mi.jio themselves (a) give instructions to the passport issuing authorities in India that the charge for a visa on a British or British Indian passport for a journey to the Persian Gulf ports (including Mam- but excluding Basrali) sbould to mture be Re.l/- aid not tne tee specified in toe consular Instructions, m ^ Kn.lt (b) asK you to instruct toe and Bahrein that they sno u ^ certificates for ° f under their ccntrol or for a States of the u-uju _ vl sa on passports held hy them. ■ V U s ,'heThe charge now levied at Bahrein from Bahreinis said Nejdis ior journeys to India is apparently onlv Re.i/- cJid no altex cition in the practice followed there is therefore necessary except to extend it to the inhahi- tants of the other Arad States in the Gulf. No reduction in the fees levied in Muscat or hy Consular Officers on the Persian side of the Gulf can apparently he made except oy the Bor eigu Oifice hut it seems possible that if fees were reduced here and in Bahrein and Kuwait, a.s suggested aoove, they might, sooner or later, agree to follow suit. In the case of Gwadar, although the position is not quite clear, it seems that the Govern ment of India might themselves issue orders to their representative that the fee for India should he reduced to Re.l/- and since he is under their control, these would presumably he obeyed. 4. I am desired to ask that you will kindly let us have your comments on the above proposals as soon as possible and inform us particularly whether in your opinion the instructions at (a) and (b) above with the addition of a reference to Gwadar in (b) cover all the necessary points. Before they can be issued it will of course be necessary to obtain the concurrence of the other Departments concerned here and it is also proposed to consult the India Office.D.O.NO.2586. British Consulate General, Bushire. Dated the 16th December, 1933 . My dear Burnett, ^ill you please refer to your demi-official letters NO.F.98-G/33 dated the 9th August and 16th October, 1933. Wlth regard to visas for Indians visiting the Arab States of the Gulf, and subjects of those States visiting India, the general position, as I understand it, is as follows. As the Rulers of these States have no Consular officers in India, the representatives of the Indian Government in India act as Passport Officers for the Arab States, and give the visas on the passports of British subjects, whether British Indian or otherwise who visit these States from India. Vice Versa, the Political Agents in the Arab States give visas to the subjects of these States who wish to visit India. 3. The normal practice is that the authority which fixes the fees to be charged for visas on the Passports of foreign subjects entering a State is the Government of that State, and the Government of these 'foreigners” fixes reciprocal fees for the visas of subjects of that State who wish to visit their territory. Thus, for example, the authority for fixing the visa fees for British or British Indian subjects travelling to Muscat would appear to be not His Majesty T s Govern ment but the Muscat Government. Why therefore the Foreign Office without consulting the Muscat Government, or the Governments of Bahrain and Kuwait, raised the visa fees for British subjects entering those States to ten gold francs, I do not quite understand. 4. in these circumstances the Indian Government wouldwould certainly appear to have the right, with the consent of the Arah States concerned, to fix the visa fees at Re, 1/- as suggested, and personally I am in lavour of it, as it seems to he to our interests for coirmercial r easons to encourage people to travel between India and the Arah ports. Since the Shaikhs do not benefit by the fees charged in India, whether | they be high or low, the Shaikhs would not have any objection to the reduction proposed. The present position with regard to the visas in question from the various States is as follows Mus cat. Visa fees for British subjects from India to Muscat (10 gold francs] Rs.7/8/-. Visa fees for Muscat subjects from Muscat to India. ... Free. ucial Coast. isa fees for British subjects from ndia to the Trucial Coast. (10 gold 'francs). ... Hs.7/8/- Visa fees for Trucial Coast Subjects,from Trucial Coast to India. Free. Visa fees for British subjects from ( , India to Bahrain. (10 gold francs). Rs.7/8/- Visa fees for Bahrain subjects from Bahrain to India. Re. 1/- Kuwait. Visa fees for British subjects from India to Kuwait. (10 gold francs). Rs.7/8/- Visa fees for Kuwait subjects from ^ Kuwait to India. Re* 1/' 5. There is a slight complication at Muscat, be cause there the Political Agent is also the Consul, and as granting visas is part of his consular duties, he works under the Foreign Office, and strictly speak ing should charge their fees. He was, however, autho rised by the Resident, when the question came up some time ago to carry on with the previous practice on the basis of reciprocity i.e. to charge no fee since &gt; there were ,no visa fees charged on the passports ofBritish subjects coming from India. While therefore it seems to me that the Political Agents at Bahrain and Kuwait and the Residency Agent at Sharjah are Govern- ment of India officials, and can therefore charge what visa fees may he settled by the Government of India, in consultation with the Shaikhs, the visa fees charged at Muscat for Muscat subjects travelling to India will have to be referred to the Foreign Office. I suggest that if reference is made to the Foreign Office, it should be on a basis of reciprocal treatment, i.e. Re.l/-. 6 . I have said above 'in consultation with the Shaikhs'. In the present case, however, I do not see that any consultation is needed and the proposal can be adopted straight away. The Shaikhs do not benefit by the vis^. fees charged in India, as already pointed out above in paragraph 4, whether these be high or low, and will not offer any objection. Yours sincerely, Sd.

Department As a result of certain difficulties experienced by His Majesty * s Consul at Basrah, the Foreign Office proposed in a letter dated 26th February, 1931 (P.Z.1218/31) to embody in a general circular, / ' instructions for the guidance of His Majesty 1 s Consular and Passport Control Officers in issuing travel documents for persons proceeding to, and for natives of, certain British Protectorates and certain Arab states. The Foreign Office letter was referred to the Government of India and, after consultation with the acting Political / Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Government of India submitted their views upon certain points which had been raised by the Foreign Office. These views are conveniently summarised in the tabular statement which is flagged in the file (P.Z.5932/31). The proposed Foreign Office circular duly appeared on 10th March last (P.Z.1875/32 and 1728/32) and it incorporated practically verbatim the recommendations of the Government of India. Experience of the instructions contained in the circular soon showed that they would require considerable modification, and in his despatch No.20 of P7th June, ir F.O. 1932/the late Political Resident and Consul General, Bushire, made certain proposals for improving the —■ circular. The relevant paragraphs of the circular with Sir Hugh Biscoe’s proposals and observations thereon are given below in parallel columns 212 5C00 0.32 Para.5/Ij ill I Hi Paragraph 5. Travel facilities may be granted to natives[of the Hadramaut and/of the Trucial Sheikhdoms who are &lt; in possession of documents establishing their nationality issued by the rulers of those States. Paragraph 6. In the event of persons without papers cMining to be subjects of the rulers of /the HadramautJ Bahrein, Koweit, or Muscat or of *hny of the Trucial Sheikhs, and applying for travel facilities, they should be invited to fill up a suitably drafted anplica- tion form. These,£in the case of the Hadramaut, should be forwarded to the ^ Resident at AdenJ/ in the ^ case of the Trucial Sheikh doms , to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; and in other cases, to + he Political Agents in the States concerned. If, however, the applicant desires only to return to his place of origin, and time is pressing, telegraphic reference may be made, at the expense of the applicant, to the Political Agent concerned, or in the case of a native of Trucial Oman, to the Political Resident, and on receipt of the confirmatory reply emergency certificates may be issued, valid only for the return journey. Paragraph 8. British subjects proceeding to any of the above- mentioned territories require a special endorse ment on their passport for the territory concerned, which may be granted gratis and a visa, for which Me standard fees of 1 and 10 gold francs respectively should be levied for transit and ordinary visas. Such visas may be granted to British subjects without In view T of para.4, this paragraph w T ould seem to be superfluous so far as the Trucial Sheikhdoms are concerned. Certificates nationality or travel documents issued by Rulers of the Trucial States should not be recognised unless they bear the seal of the Residency Agent. y- jtlin iJ Ij vj* In the Persian Gulf it is customary in such cases to call on the applicant to produce suitable reference from a local merchant of standing or notable who knows him, and this is regarded as adequate ground for the issue of an emergency certificate. This practice should be maintained as regards those Arab States within the province of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. European British subjects are not at present authoris to visit the Trucial Coast. This paragraph should be modified to make this clear ed At the present time it is the practice for British Indians and the indigenous population w r hen travelling by steamer to be granted identity certificates, or, alternatively, visas on their passports for traveli to/Minute Paper.

The fee to be levied for the visas given to British and British-Indian subjects between Gulf ports and between Gulf ports and India should be fixed at Re.l; and, conversely, the fee'for the grant of visas to natives 0 j the Arab Coast for travel to India should also be fixed at Re.1.* A subject of any of the Arab Coast principalities should be referred to as 'A subject of the Sheikh of ....” An emergency certificate (on the lines of that given as Annex 5 to Chapter XXVI of the Consular Instructions) would be the only document issued to them by His Majesty’s Passport or Consular officers. It is the practice for the Political Agents at Muscat, Bahrein, and Koweit to issue certificates of identity; in order to make this fact clear, the words' ’’with the exception of Political Agents at Muscat, Koweit, and Bahrein and the Residency Agent at Shargah, by whom certificates of identity are issued at the rate of Re.1” should be added at the end of the paragraph. The Foreign Office asked us for observations on the Political Resident’s recommendations, and we have now obtained the views of the Government of India_, The [ AtP ve-rrp-'ient of Inaia- agree with the suggestions in the Political Resident’s despatch except in regard to the fees to be charged for emergency certificates. It appears, however, that some confusion must have arisen in this respect, since Sir Hugh Biscoe’s despatch of 27th June, while it makes suggestions regarding the fees for identity certificates and visas, does not appear to deal with the question of the fees for emergency certificates. The position in regard to the latter is as follows: The fees for emergency certificates to be issued by His Majesty’s Consular Officers to subjects of the Arab Coast principalities were fixed in accordance with the recommendation of the Political Resident in the Persian 1212 5COO 9.32 Gulf/Gulf, the rates being 7s.6d. if issued by officers residing outside the Gulf and Re.l if issued at places in the Gulf (see paragraph 4 of the tabular statement), but the Foreign Office pointed out that these documents are emergency certificates of nationality, the fees from which accrue to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, and suggested that, in accordance with customary practice, the total fee to be charged for these certificates at all posts should be 6s.6d. - P.2, The views of the Government of India upon the Foreign Office proposal were sought in India Office lette (P.Z.6001/32) dated 23rd June, and the Government of India consulted the Political Resident in their letter of 25th July (P.Z.7366/32). Some slight confusion has been caused owing to the fact that, in replying to the Government of India and suggesting that Re.l should continue to be charged for emergency certificates, Colonel Fowle referred to Sir Hugh Biscoe’s despatch of . MSI 27th June the question of emergency certificates had been dealt with in that despatch. The Government of India in their letter of 15th November (P.Z.7366/32) stated that they did not agree with Colonel Fowle’s view and that they regarded the Foreign Office proposal as reasonable, but their Express Letter of 2nd December (P.Z.7586/32) implies that they too are under the impression that the question of emergency certificates is dealt v/ith in Sir Hugh Biscoe’s despatch. The difficulty might be explained if the emergency certificates in question were the same as the identity certificates mentioned in paragraph 5 of the despatch, but the two are specifically distinguished in the paragraph -which follows (paragraph 6).Paper.

It is suggested that we may assume that the Government of India do agree with the Political Resident’s proposals as to the fees to be charged for identity certificates and only disagree as regards emergency certificates.

ISSUE OP THE ABOVE HAS BEEN DULY AUTHORISED.N •y- 231* i 1 / Aden. 16th November, 1932. Sir, I have the honour to refer to Foreign Office Circular Despatch No.T.2117/593/378 of 10th March, 193a, concerning Travel documents for persons proceeding to certain British Protectorates and Arab States. 2. Since the instructions contained in this despatch have been in force, a period of 5 months, I have received from His Majesty*s Consul-General at Batavia 27 references containing 78 applications for travel documents to the Aden Protectorate* 3. The reason for this large number of applications is that there are a large number of Arabs in the Netherlands Bast Indies who are either Hadhramis or descendants of Hadhramis born in the Netherlands Bast Indies, (the former being British protected subjects and the latter Dutch subjects), the majority of whom possess no valid travel documents. These people frequently wish to travel to their native country, the Hadhramaut, and, in accordance with paragraphs 6 and 7 of the above-quoted despatch, may be issued with travel documents only after reference has been made first to Aden, and then to Mukalla, the port of the Hadhramaut. 4. This procedure entails much delay and consequent inconvenience to the applicants; and much additional clerical work in the Residency Office at Aden. PS MAJESTY'S SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES, LONDON.5. In none of the 78 applications referred to above was an applicant’s claim to be a Hadhrami found on investigation to be false, and it appears to me that these troublesome precautions are in fact unnecessary. 6. I therefore suggest that His Majesty’s Consul- General at Batavia be authorised to use his discretion in all such cases, and that a previous reference to Aden should cease to be obligatory.

Since that date, however, the situation has changed to the following extent, viz:- (a) passengers (this word does not include Imperial Airways staff, either flying or ground) of whatever nationality require no visas (transit or ordinary) or endorsements for Kuwait, Bahrain, Sharja, or Gwadar (Muscat Territory) if only passing along the Arab Route without breaking journey; (b) but such passengers would, on the contrary, require visas (transit or ordinary as the case may be) and endorsements for such places if breaking their journey or remaining thereat. 3.

With regard to paragraph 2 of your letter, Sir John Simon would be glad to learn as scon as possible the views of the Government of India in regard to the fee to be charged for the issue of emergency certificates, 3, With regard to paragraph 4, sir John Simon does not consider that an amendment to the Foreign Office Circular of the 10th March last should be issued.

It will be observed that paragraph 2 of Foreign Office circular despatch Mo. 16 (T 2117/592/278) of March 10, 1922, is quite explicit on this point, i.e., the recognition of Bahraini and Mascati passports ’’bearing the signature and seal 'of the respective Political Agents in those States, and there is a clear and consequent inference that such passports not so sealed and signed should not be recognised. Phis Consulate, therefore, cannot but be very definitely of the j opinion that the seal and signature above alluded to must be present on Bahraini and Mascati passports. 2.

My dear Selous, Please refer to your D.O. ho. 16EO dated the 1st September, 1932. So far as I remember, Bahrain Passports when issued are always signed either by the Commandant of Police or the Adviser. Both these officers occupy the position of a commissioned officer and their signature is the sole guarantee that exists that details in the passport are correct. Any signature by the Political Agent countersigning this signature would only be a formality, since we have no means of checking the statements made therein and it would prove an additional expense to travellers, as a fee would presumably be charged. I am, however, making certain that the State passports are signed by a responsible official and will take up the question of this endorsement with the Resident when I go to Bushire in October. Yours sincerely, (Signed) C.C. PRIOR. Selous Bsquire O.B.E. , His Majesty's Consul, Basra.British Consulate, Basra, August 17, 193E. Sir, I have the honour to invite your attention to paragraph three of foreign Office circular despatch go • 16 (T 2117/593/378) of the 10th ilarch last, which reads as follows:- u His Majesty f s Consular officers should 'recognise Bahreini and Muscati passports 'bearing the signature and seal of the 'respective Political Agents in those 'States, and should extend their good 'offices to the holders. Such good offices 'may include the endorsement, at the 'discretion of the Consular Officer, of 'Bahreini and Muscati passports for travel 'to countries not already specified, and 'the grant of visas for travel to British 'territory.' 2. This morning a Bahreini, Abdulla bin Jasem, presented his passport no. 199 dated March 7, 1932, issued by the Passport Officer, Bahrain, for a visa for iuiwait. While the passport was in process of examination, it was discovered that page 6 of the said travel document had been left blank and not dealt with in accordance with the rulings cited above. 3 . Considering, however, the fact that the applicant was granted visa Bo. 235 by your Agency on June 6 last, presumably for Iraq, but the destination space had been left blank, I have instructed my passport clerk to give him the necessary visa for iLuwait. 4. This is, incidentally, the third case of this kind of which this Consulate has recently become aware. I have, etc. (Signed) G.JEU SELOUS. olitical Agent, Bahrain.So. 9S7 of 1932.

Gulf addressed to the Foreign Office, London, a copy of which was sent to the Government of India, I would observe that in view of the uncertain political conditions in the Aden Protectorate (including the Kadhramaut) I consider that a visa to allow a Europea British subject to proceed to these territories should not be granted without prior reference to this resi dency.No.147. The Residency Aden, 3rd August 1932, I have the honour to invite your attention to a distinction that is dram hy the Foreign Office het¥/een the Aden Protectorate, and the Hadhramaut (vide 'General Instructions to His Majesty's Consular Officers' - Annex to Chapter XXII, (June 1930) wherein the latter territory is described as the 'coastal area offeouthern Arabia lying 'between the Aden Protectorate and the Sultanate of Mus cat and Oman'). 2. This distinction is further emphasized in Foreign V Office Circular No.T.2117/593/378 of the 10th March 1932 on the subject of Travel Documents for persons proceed ing to, and for natives of, certain British ProtecttCrates and certain Arab States. 3 . I am not aware of the reasons which have prompted the Foreign Office in their separation of the Hadhramaut from the rest of the Aden Protectorate for the purposes of Consular Instructions. 4. The Hadhramaut is a geographical expression, and the only occasion known to me on which it has been used in a political sense in any document appertaining to political relations is in the Agreement of 1918 between Sultan or to t e Sultan of She hr and Muhalla. It does not include the territories of the Vvahiai ^ulx^ans of Balahaf and Bir All nor tho^e of the Mahri -ulta.^ of .ishn, all of whom arc in His Majesty’s Government. 5. The Treaties between His Majesty's Government and,r the Chiefs in the Aden political sphere who are under British protection are all similar in form and intention: there appears therefore to he no justification for the distinction drawn hy the Foreign Office between the 'Aden Protectorate' and the 'Hadhramaut'; anu it is in my opinion misleading. 6 . I recoim-nd that the '..den Protectorate' he regard ed as including the 'Hadhramaut' and as extending to the western limits of thdultanats of Muscat and Oman; and that 't J .1 o Foreign Office Instructions referred, to de amended o.ccordingX^ 7 ’* I hevo tae honour tode Sir, Your most odedient, humble servant, Sd/- B.R..

Sir I have the honour to refer to Foreign Office Circular No. T 2117 / 593/378 of March 10 th, 1932 , relating to the procedure to he adopted in dealing with applications for travel documents for persons proceeding to, and for natives of, certain British Protectorates and Arah States, and venture to submit the following observations in connection therewith. 2 * Paragraph 5 of the Circular . I am not quite clear as to the intention and scope of this paragraph so far as the Trucial Shaikhdoms are concerned, and in view of para graph 4 it would seem to be superfluous. The Trucial Shaikhs are not encouraged to issue Certificates of Na tional ity or travel documents to anyone without the en dorsement of the Residency Agent, and I think this pro cedure should be adhered to, and that documents not bearing the seal of the Residency Agent shoul'd not be recognised. 3 . Paragraph 6 . In this paragraph it is stated that if an applicant desires to return to his place of origin tnd time is pressing, telegraphic reference may be made, at his expense, to the Political Agent concerned, or in : the case of a native of Trucial Oman, to myself, and on receipt of a confirmatory reply an emergency certificate Hi a Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,fto'V may be issued valid for the return journey only. In the Persian Gulf it is customary in such cases to call on the applicant to produce suitable reference from a local merchant of standing or notable who knows him, and this is regarded as adequate ground for the issue of an emergency certificate. I would suggest that this practice should be maintained as regards those Arab States falling within my province and should be glad to know if the Chief Commissioner at Aden has any objection to it being adopted as regards both residents of the Hadramaut and natives of the Aden Protectorate. 4. Paragraph 8 . European British subjects are not at present authorised to visit the Trucial coast, and I would therefore suggest that this paragraph should be modified to make this clear. 5. At the present time it is the practice for British Indians and the indigenous population, when travelling by steamer, to be granted Identity Certificates or alternatively visas on their passports, for travel to other places on the Arab Coast of the Gulf, for the sum of Re.l/-. Much hardship would be caused to petty Indian traders in this region if they were compelled to pay full visa rates every time they wished to travel from one State on the Arab coast to another, or from India to the Persian Gulf. I would therefore suggest that the fee to be levied for the visas given to British and British Indian subjects between Gulf ports or between Gulf ports and India should be fixed as Re.l., and that conversely the fee for the grant of visas to natives of the Arab coast travelling to India should also be fixed at Re. 1. 6 .6 . Paragraph 9 of Circular. As it is the practice for the Political Agents at Muscat, Bahrein and Kuwait to issue certificates of identity I would suggest, in order to make this fact clear, that the words !, with t le ’’exception of Political Agents at Muscat, Kuwait and Bahrein ’♦and the Residency Agent, Shargah, by whom certificates of ’’Identity are issued at the rate of Re.l” he added at the end of the paragraph. 7. Copies of this despatch have been sent to the Government of India, to the Chief Commissioner at Aden, to His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah and to the Political Agents at Kuwait and Muscat.

The question of visas for Bahreinis travelling to India seems to us to be a matter of domestic concern to the G. of I., and we assume that it is within their competence to give what orders they like to the Political Agent.

I am informed that Imperial Airways propose to stop at Kuwait only if there are passengers who wish to embark or disembark at that place. At Bahrein they will halt to refuel; at Shargah there will be a night halt, while at Gwadur also they will halt to refuel. I would suggest, therefore, that in the oase of passengers, either British or foreign, booked to proceed by east- bound aeroplane to India, they should net be required to obtain either visas or endorsements for ai^* cf tae ^ ra b Principalities, and similarly passengers oy West-sound aeroplane would not require visas or endorsements ror the Arab Principalities if they are becked to P rc oe©d toBasra cr placGS Beyond* Passenger's wisiiing to step at Kuwait, Bahrein, Shargah or Gwadur (Miscat territory) cr to Break their journey at any of those places should Be required to comply with the usual passport procedure prescriBed in the circular, and Messrs.

This is the letter to which the Political Resident refers in suggesting a reduction of the ordinary visa fee for Indians (with a corresponding reduction of the fee for Bahreinis and Nejdis going to India).. The reduction for Indians travelling from India is presumably within the Government of India’s own competence and that for Bahreinis and Nejdis travellirg J ought also to be assuming that to India from Bahreir}/ within their competency the P.A., is not bound by such other Consular instructions / Bahr e i nyau^ ^ &gt;- -i _ • The Government of India’s suggestion, that the Foreign Office circular addressed to consular and passport control officers throughout the world should be amended,does not seem a necessary or appropriate means of giving effect to Sir H.Biscoe’s proposal.

Similary many of the Indians who come to Bahrein are of the same sort of position and earn their living as assistants in shops, clerks etc.,. The British India Steam Navigation Company deck fares from India to the Gulf are already high and to call on. such persons to pay perhaps Rs.28/« or Rs.35/- extra for a family party (at Rs.?/- per head) is certainly a very substantial tax. Yusaf fasin asked me if 1 could also get it reduced for Nejdis. 4. I consider these representations merit sympathetic conside. ation; a reduction would benfit Indians as well as Bahreinis an 'l ’ Nejdis. The poorer members of the mercantile community are pass ing through difficult times at present, and I think it behoves us to help them if we can. I would therefore suggest that in future the charge for visas for India issued to Bahreinis ana Nejdis and vice versa, i.e.visas granted to Indians proceeding to Bahrein should be reduced to Re.l/- in each case. This lee might be the same for both transit and ordinary visas.C'iS 'i&gt;' is» H'llS &lt; S*i.XXit« ^^1 *.* *■••&gt;• 4 &gt;' • t » ./■ 1 C*.: y 10 y not - £ ,i ,t nx £ ns i)X a 9&gt; - X .b ox c i .iijkjiii 2 0 X nsainisv oO srw &lt; I o‘.=i ^rf« : . * ndl 5 lij 010 'Usmx! . ’rt&amp;S agi 03 ,'Uut) next , ♦y : «wr \ 4* r '»&amp;&amp;.&amp;$&gt; m C. m oK xsXX sX j riSiiiijXnoxjXX^i ^ © ? xo'i ©ocssxs'isH. » V XsCffllOS X&lt;„ X ilSiiHTiu V C f SXiJ OJ X6^' X ^'iBil'iO © “. xfj Vx ©lit £'-8X ££• , 0£\D' 0^ gt.«QXV *X01 ii©©i ©JUX 3X&amp;l-'.X UV/CX) ^.XJ^X Sifej*- •&gt; X J©X nX » aon^xl oloa nsX bna ©no lo ass'i arfX ©o' Mi/ode ax©‘a1fiS X doxqxoa'i oos 8S8.-.V ^T^axjio .b/io XxanB^X 10 I \X9TiXosqidei haft olx a*xx.&gt;-Xi o« /•- ''•» -xv c^s x &lt; , xox •©©x v©i. si... c:S'^ano ,x.xi&gt;nl ©J ^nxi)©eoxaq e^os^Qi/a to! osXs yu nGaso©x a.v&gt;xi 4 itx ax&lt; Xxt s^A Xuoxui X ot^ diiX * i&lt; aiaal 'i.aeu^.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that I have received instructions, in Foreign Office Circular despatch No. T 2117/593/378 of March 10th last, regarding travel documents for persons proceeding to, and for natives of, certain British Protectorates and Arah States. The sixth paragraph reads as follows ”In the event of persons without papers claiming to he subjects of the Hadhramaut and applying for travel facilities, they should he invited to fill up a suitably drafted application fornu These in the case of the Hadhramaut, should be forwarded to the Resident at Aden; If however, the applicant desires only to return to his place of origin, and time is pressing, telegraphic reference may be made, at the expense of the applicant, to the Political Resident, and on receipt of the confirmatory reply emergency certificates may be issued, valid only for the return journey.” 2. As you are no doubt aware, in the return pilgrimage season this Legation annually receives applications from a large number of Hadhramis for travel documents to enable them to return home. Most of them claim to have lost their original Mokalla passports or to have handed them over to other joint holders who reuurncu 1931, for instance, 431 and 471 Emergency Certificate , _ tt„ +. r-n vfi 1 lers in this category. It is expected this year that, in economic depression, more than in the four months following pilgi im8 S , it has not been the 3. As you are further aware Itical Resident, A D E N.practice in the past to refer these applications to you either by letter or by telegraph owing to the numerous applications that are received - in some cases at the rate of ten to fifteen a day - and in view of the long interval that would necessarily elapse before your sanction could be obtained. 4. Owing to the imminence of the return pilgrimage season I propose, subject to your concurrence, to continue to grant travel facilities to Hadhrami travellers as heretofore and on receipt of your reply to approach His Majesty's Government with a view to modifying, in the case of this Legation, and in view of the exceptional circumstances ruling in the Hejaz, the strict application of the provisions of paragraph six of the * I circular under reference* 5# If you see no objection to the course proposed, I should he grateful if you would so inform me by telegraph, so that I may he in a position to make the necessary arrangements before the commencement of the main return season* 6* I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs* I have, etc., (Sgd) C.G.

The fees for the Emergency Certificates to be issued by His Majesty’s Consular, Officers to subjects of the Arab Coast Principalities were fixed in accordance with the recommendation of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in his letter of the 26th July last, a copy of which was enclosed with your letter No. PZ 5932/31 of 21st '6d. September last, the rates being seven shillings and sixpence e 1. if issued by officers residing outside the Gulf, and one Rupee if issued at places in the Gulf. These documents are Emergency Certificates of nationality, for which the fees will be remitted to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, apd it is desirable to have legal sanction for their collection. It is the practice in such circumstances for His Majesty’s Consular Officers to levy the appropriate charge in the British Table of Consular Fees, and not the fees which may be levied for a similar service by the Government concerned, and Sir John Simon considers taa^ the charge made at all posts, whether within or without the dull., should accordingly 'be Fee 79 in the Consular ruble, whicn, wi th/ Unler Secretary of State, India Office.i \ % g \ with the addition au^^^^moTihts to a total of six shillings and sixpence. Any possibility of cases of exceptional hardship arising from the levy of this sum at posts in the G-ulf can be met by the waiver of the fee on the ground of destitution. 3. I am to enquire whether Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare concurs in the issue of a supplementary circular in this sense. 4. At the same time I am to enquire whether Sir Samuel Hoare desires Sir John Simon to take any action upon his letter No. P.Z.4257/31 of 9th July last. 5.

Travel Documents for Persons proceeding to, and for Natives of, certain British Protectorates and certain Arab States. Sir, I AM directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to inform you that, in dealing with applications for travel documents for persons proceeding to, and for natives of, the territories specified below, His Majesty’s Consular officers should be guided by the following instructions : (1) The Aden Protectorate (as distinct from the Aden Settlement, which is considered as forming part of British India). Natives of the Protectorate are British-protected persons by virtue of treaties between His Majesty’s Government and the chiefs of the various tribes inhabiting the Protectorate. (2) The Hadramaut. —The Hadramautis are considered as British- protected persons by virtue of treaties between His Majesty’s Government and the principal rulers in the Hadramaut. ( 3 ) Bahrein, Koiveit, Muscat and Oman, and the Tracial Sheikh- X doms. — These independent Arab States are in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government, under which, except in the case of Muscat and Oman, the conduct of their foreign relations is entrusted to His Majesty’s Government. 2 . British passports and emergency certificates may be issued and endorsed in the ordinary course in the case of British subjects and British-protected persons who are natives of the Aden Protectorate and who are not seamen following the sea. Further instructions in their case are being issued. 3 . His Majesty’s Consular officers should recognise Bahreini and Muscati passports bearing the signature and seal of the respective Political Agents in those States, and should extend their good offices v- is Majesty’s Consular and Passport Control Officers.to the holders. Such good offices may include the endorsement, at the discretion of the Consular officer, of Bahreini and Muscati passports for travel to countries not already specified, and the grant of visas for travel to British territory. 4 . Holders of Koweit Certificates of Identity signed and sealed by the Political Agent, and of Trucial Oman Certificates of Identity signed and sealed by the Residency Agent at Shargah, should be similarly treated. 5 Travel facilities may be granted to natives of the Hadramaut and of the Trucial Sheikhdoms who are in possession of documents establish ing their nationality issued by the rulers of those States. 6. In the event of persons without papers claiming to be subjects of the rulers of the Hadramaut, Bahrein, Koweit, or ALuscat oi of any d of the Trucial Sheikhs, and applying for travel facilities, they should ^ be invited to fill up a suitably drafted application form. These, in the case of the Hadramaut, should be forwarded to the Resident at Aden; in the case of the Trucial Sheikhdoms, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; and in other cases, to the Political Agents in the States concerned. If, however, the applicant desires only to return to his place of origin, and time is pressing, telegraphic reference may be made, at the expense of the applicant, to the Political Agent concerned, or in the case of a native of Trucial Oman, to the Political Resident, and on receipt of the confirmatory reply emergency certificates may be issued, valid only for the return journey.. 7. Subject always to standing instructions, visas may be granted to foreigners, other than British subjects, desiring to proceed to any of the above-mentioned territories, but only after reference to the local British authorities as specified above. The requirement of visas for entry into these territories applies also to Iraqis. 8. British subjects proceeding to any of the above-mentioned territories require a special endorsement on their passport for the territory concerned, which may be granted gratis, and a visa, for which the standard fees of 1 and 10 gold francs respectively should be levied for transit and ordinary visas. Such visas may be granted to British subjects without prior reference to the authorities in the territory concerned. 9 . A subject of any of the Arab Coast principalities should he referred to as “A subject of the Sheikh of .....” An emergency Certificate (on the lines of that given as Annex 5 to Chapter XXVItantii «in fell ibove-Bieatiii assport ioi'tls utedtoBi n the territi of the Consular Instructions) would be the only document issued to them by His Majesty’s Passport or Consular officers. 10 .

(• —~rI am sorry that there has been delay in replying to your letter Ho. P.Z. 6384/31 of the 15th October, about Bahreini passports. The statements which gave rise to the enquiry of the oniciating rolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf ar^ no doubt, the last sentences of paragraphs 2 and 5 of Bel grave ’ s letter to Laithwaite of the 28th May last. ;ie think the most probable explanation is that the letter was somewhat loosely vended, that the word 'authorities' in paragraph 2, stands for 'French authorities”, and the word 'visas' in paragraph 5, for 'endorsements”. We noticed the point at the time, and in copying Belgrave’s letter to the Embassy at Paris, we omitted the second of the two sentences. The position is, of course, that Bahreinis do not require British visas for travel to France, but presumably require endorsements on their passports -which they may if necessary obtain outside Bahrein from the competent British/ * Anderson, Esq., D.S.O., M. C.rrwvmmaaxa ~ British authorities. o. As regards the necessity of French visas for ^ Bahreinis visiting France, you will be aware from our ianssfu. letter ao.

What I don't understand is why the British authorities at Bombay should have visaed for France the passports of the two Bahrain subjects ? ( see Belgrave’s letter of 28th May to you ). A British subject going from India to France needs no visa* A Bahraini subject presumably does, but surely he should get such a visa from the nearest French Consul ? In this case the one at Bombay. 3. I mention this point as, though the French F*G.Laithwaite,Esq. , Fndia Office, London. Government V il ■ jGovernment, having been approached on the subject vide Foreign Office letter No.1951 of 5th August 1931 t0 the ^assador,laris, will doubtless now recognise the existence of Bahrain, and its pass ports, they may still insist that holders of such passports, when travelling to France, should have French consular visas. 4TWi/} T ■ c .P.Z. 5932/31.

The Government of India agree that the necessary instructions may be embodied in a general circular. They are oi opinion further that the circular should be communicated to all Consular and Passport Officers and not only to consular officials in certain specified territories. The proposed circular might also, it is suggested, explain the special relations subsisting Between His Majesty^ Government and the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. ft’ / it 33. In regard to sub-paragraph a (a), (h) and ( of paragraph 1(2) of foreign Office letter of ^ 26th .tfeoruai / 1931, the Government of India concur in the viewa expresaed oy the Political Kesident in o) the Persian Gulf in his letter which forms an enclosure to this communication. ^* lrie Government of India agree with the loreign uxiice that fees for the grant of visas should be levied according to nationality on the same scale as British visa fees, except that nationals ol countries with which nis ixtajesty's Government have concluded visa abolition agreements should be charged 10 gold francs and one gold franc for ordinary and transit visas respectively, ihey also agree that it should be made clear that Iraqis require visas for entry into the territories to which this correspondence especially relates* 5* As regards paragraph 1(4) of the foreign Office letter, the Government of India do not consider that a previous reference should necessarily be made to the Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf before visas are granted to British subjects desiring to travel to these territories. In connection with the levy of a fee in such cases the foreign Office letter mentions endorsements only, but the practice of the Government of India in dealing with British subjects proceeding to territories such as Iraq, etc,, is to grant both an endorsement and a visa* Ihe former is given gratis and a fee charged for the latter when a fee is leviable, rhe Government ol India propose- to continue tnis practice (since British subjects proceeding to Bahrein, etc., axe 'aliens') and to charge standard lees of one and ten gold francs, respectively, for transit and(iw ordinary visas.

Si r, 1 have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No .D.968-G/31 of 7 th May 1931 and to reply to the points raised therein asl'oTlowss- (a) There do not appear to me any objections to embodying the instructions issued to Bis Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Basrah in a general Circular letter to all passport and Consular officers, in thrs connection please see Colonel Biscoe’s despatches No. 1784 of 2nd August 1930 *(la,st para) and No.39 of 8th January 1931 13rd para), on the subject of granting visas to persons d&amp;aosi desirous of travelling to Arab Coast principalities* lb) I would submit for your consideration the following proposals regarding the travel facilities to oe accorded to subjects of the Persian Gulf States by Bis Majesty’s Consular officers. 1) Consular Officers should recognise Bahreini and Muscat! passports bearing the signature and seal of the respective Political Agents in those States and extend their good offices to the holder. Such•SB? (3?1 || be charged for at the rate of 1 gold franc and 10 gold I francs. Endorsements should be charged for at the rate of 2/«». The main points to be oorne in mind when dealing with Arab Coast passport problems are I think that the Consular or Passport officer^ is acting in a dual capacity. Firstly he is acting to a limited extent as passport officer for each Arab Coast Principality and Shaikhdom (see suggestions re Emergency Certificates and Endorsements in B(2) and (3) above), his position as regards the issue of visas to British and Foreign subjects for travel to Bahrein, Kuwait and Muscat being somewhat similar to that of a British Official acting as passport officer^ on behalf of the 'Iraq Government. Alternatively he is acting in his normal capacity as one of His Britannic Majesty's Consular or Passport officers dealing with friendly aliens and as such will issue natives of the Arab Coast States with visas for travel in the British Empire ana to British Mandatory Territory where such axe necessary.

No definite instructions appear ever to have been issued to consuls - other than the consul at Basra - about the issue of visas for the states in the Persian Gulf, although a general circular is at present under consideration and will issue in due course, thus covering Colonel Bis coe's request in para.3 of his letter The confusion may best be explained by a short summary of the present position. The question of visas for aliens wishing to enter uhe States in the Gulf was brought up early in 1929 by the Consul in Basra and on March 31st the Foreign Office sent him instructions (P.2211/30 flagged). The relevant portion stated:- 'Visas may be given to aliens desiring to proceed to any of the above mentioned territories but applications from Germans or from citizens of the U.S.S.R. should be referred to the appropriate local British representative ” An enquiry shortly after by an American travel agency was made the occasion to ask the Government of India to clear up the actual position since no definite instructions appeared ever to have been given save those to Basra. In reply to the Air Mail letter from this office ('I propose to reply that intending travellers to Koweit, Bahrein or Muscat should obtain British visa'), the Government of India said M We agree but think that perhaps caution should be added that visa can only be granted after reference to local authorities which may take time'. On the strength of this, the Foreign Office replied to the Agency 'Intending visitors should obtain British visas. It should be noted, however, that visas for these places can onlybe granted after reference to the local authorities concerned”. This letter has caused Colonel Biscoe’s difficulty since no consular instructions to this effect had at the time been issued - even to Basra - and it was only subsequently (P.7626/30) that the Government of India formally suggested an amendment of the Basra Consul’s instructions. It would thus appear that the Consul- General at Cairo was perfectly correct in his action and that the misunderstanding was due to the wording of the Foreign Office letter to the Agency. The Foreign Office and India Office have since approved the Government of India’s suggested amendment and when certain other points have been settled, the new Consular Instructions, which cover Colonel Biscoe’s request, will be issued, if not to all consuls, at any rate to those in the countries likely to be concerned (P.Z.1218). The new clause, as it stands at present, will read (P. 7 626/30):- ”... visas maybe given to aliens desiring to proceed to any of the above-mentioned territories, but only after reference to the local British authorities as specified above.”wiHi Minute Paper, B, &gt; 4 fTVv.

Since it may well be some time before the new Instructions issue and the matter is of some political importance, it is submitted that the F.O. should be asked to bring Col. Biscoe-s third paragraph to the immediate notice of passport Control officers, as well as embodying the sense o'f' if in ftoc t o_ it m the new Instructions. The position with regard to passport visas for Bahrein is set forth in the Political Resident's letter of 31/7/30 to the G. of I. (P.6347/30 flagged). 'The Bahrein authorities required that the passport of any person wishing to land should bear a visa. Since,however, Bahrein has no officials abroad who can give such visas the service is performed for the Bahrein Government by British officials it does not therefore follow that Bahrein is considered to be a British protectorate. In fact since Bahrein has not even Been described in the Annex to Chap. XXII of the Consular Instructions as a “British - Protected State but is now imply classed as 'Certain other Territories'. (P. 4203/29 flagged). The Foreign Office may therefore be asked to draw the attention of the Passport Office to this fact and to suggest that it would best be referred to on passports as 'Bahrein' or 'Bahrein State' Drafts appended.

Advice, Assistance and Protection to be given to British Subjects and British-protected Persons.-Definition of British-protected Persons. Replies to Enquiries from British Subjects and British-protected Persons. 1. A Consular officer should give his best advice and assistance to His Majesty’s subjects trading in, residing in, or visiting his district, and should do his utmost to avert and arrange differences among them, or between them and the natives of the country. 2. If British subjects suffer injury, or are likely to suffer injury, either in their persons or property, the Consular officer must uphold rightful interests and privileges, secured by treaty, by due representations in the proper official quarter, made in the manner prescribed by these instructions. He must be temperate and judicious in such representations. 3. If redress cannot be obtained from the local authorities, or if the matter of complaint be not within their jurisdiction, the case must be referred to His Majesty’s Diplomatic representative. 4. A Consular officer should reply to the best of his ability to enquiries addressed to him by British subjects, and also by other persons where such enquiries can properly be answered by him in his official capacity.* He must in any case acknowledge as soon as possibl e the receipt of all letters addressed to him in that capacity. * For replies to be given to enquiries from British traders, see Chapter XVII, Fart VI (3). 5225 [20506] BPROTECTION.—CLAIMS.] [Chap. XXII. 5. A Consular officer should not, as a general rule, incur ex penditure in undertaking enquiries or obtaining documents for private persons unless a sufficient guarantee be given for reim bursement. This caution applies to enquiries instituted under instructions from the Secretary of State in the absence of special authorization to incur expenditure. When, however, such expenses are inconsiderable and are incurred in pursuance of a trade enquiry from a firm or individual in the United Kingdom, the amounts thereof may be inserted in the Quarterly Accounts with the Foreign Office as “ Advances on behalf of the Department of Overseas Trade.” In such cases the amounts chargeable should be notified to the latter Department concurrently with the information in respect of which the expen diture has been incurred, in order that steps may be taken to obtain repayment from the applicants before the information is forwarded to them. 6. Vice-Consuls and Consular agents must be guided by the above instructions, bearing in mind the limitations as to corre spondence with local authorities prescribed in Chapter V. 7. Letters of introduction from the Secretary of State which may be presented to a Consul by visitors are not intended to give any claim to hospitality, but merely to certify that the persons who present them are either personally known to the Secretary of State, or have been recommended to him; they are intro duced to the Consul for such marks of attention and courtesy, short of hospitality, as he may have the opportunity of bestowing upon them. Consuls must clearly understand that letters of introduction must not in any circumstances be construed as committing His Majesty’s Government to the promotion of any particular enterprise, such as specific commercial or industrial undertakings, or applica tions for concessions. facilities should not be obtained for British subjects who visit foreign towns in order to study conditions of trade and labour, municipal organization, the administration of canals, forests, &amp;c., unless such visitors are furnished with letters of introduction from the foreign Office, or from the Department of Overseas Trade. S. In the event of a Consular officer having to report any case o a serious nature affecting British subjects, their rights and interests, in which the intervention of His Majesty’s Government3 Chap. XXII.] [PROTECTION.—CLAIMS. may be required, it is important that be should furnish a full state ment of all the material circumstances, and with this view he should bear in mind— That when any important documents are referred to in a case or are evidently connected with it, a copy of them, or, if preferable’ an accurate abstract, should be forwarded. Copies should also hp supplied of the text of any foreign law, decree, sentence or rela tion material to the determination of the case or question • copies of depositions on oath, formal protests, declarations, statements of parties or witnesses, and legal documents which may be referred to in or foim part of such statements should be appended ■ the full names and descriptions of the parties or their agents should be given. In all cases of any importance, more especially in those likely to give rise to legal or international questions, a full statement of the facts should be supplied. 9. Although it is the primary duty of Consular officers to offer such protection and assistance as may be in their power to British subjects, it must be borne in mind that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has the right, in his absolute discretion, to refuse to extend British protection or assistance to any particular individual. &gt; IB. The provisions of this chapter apply not only to British subjects, as defined in Chapter XXV of the present Instructions, but also tc persons w r ho enjoy British protection on other grounds (“ British-protected persons ”). &gt; A list of the territories and States the natives, nationals or subjects of which are here referred to is given in the Annex to this chapter. 11. The provisions of this chapter do not necessarily apply at posts where Consular officers have Dominion colleagues, or in cases where separate Dominion representation has been established at the capital of the country in wffiich they reside ; in such cases Consular officers will receive from time to time special instructions upon such of their duties as are affected by inter-imperial constitutional developments. 12. Natives of Egypt and Iraq form separate categories, regarding which special instructions will be issued from time to time. [20506] B 2PROTECTION-CLAIMS.] [Chap. XXII. 13. British subjects and British-protected persons possessing a second nationality cannot receive British protection in the country of their second nationality, although they may be registered, as provided for in paragraph 18 of Chapter XXVII of these Instruc tions, and, where the local authorities do not object, they may receive passports in accordance with the terms of paragraph 9 of Chapter XXVI of the Instructions. 14. The fact that a British subject or a British-protected person possesses a second nationality does not dehor him from British protection in a country which is not that of his second nationality. 15. Where a British subject or a British-protected person applies to a Consular officer for protection, and the Consular officer thinks that there is reason to believe that he is also a subject or citizen of the country in which he is resident, he may require him to produce evidence that by the local law he is not a subject or citizen of that country.* lb. It should be noted that British-protected persons cannot claim the same right to land in the United Kingdom as British subjects, and are subject in this respect to the ordinary restrictions imposed on foreigners. 17. Persons holding local certificates of naturalization as British subjects, issued under the local law of one of His Majesty’s Dominions or Colonies, or of India (see Chapter XXV, paragraph 4 (hi)), may only receive the good offices of His Majesty’s Diplomatic and Consular officers as a matter of courtesy, and then only subject to their being persons of good character and undoubted loyalty, and to their not having lost their claim to the good offices of Ilis Majesty’s Government by 7 prolonged residence outside the Empire. These conditions may in general be regarded as fulfilled by persons provided with valid passports issued by the Government of the Dominion or Colony in which they were naturalized, or by some other competent authority. Doubtful cases should be referred to the Secretary of State for instructions, except in the case of persons whose last place of residence was, or vvho were naturalized, in a Dominion. In such cases the Consular officer may, at his discretion, refer direct to the Government of the Dominion concerned. ^ ^ am Consular officers should be g-overned by the local regulations as to the classes of persons who should be protected:IgOOUil iflan’fgfe 'tot ti? !: A ^ Chap. XXII.] [PROTECTION.—CLAIMS. *• In a]1 cases m which a Consular officer receives applications for protection or assistance from British subjects or British-pro tected persons, he should be careful to satisfy himself that the national status of the applicant is such as is claimed. A passport may in general he regarded as constituting sufficient proof of the national status of its holder. If a passport is not produced the Consular officer should he guided, in the case of persons claimin to be British subjects, by the instructions in Chapter KXV.6 PROTECTION-CLAIMS.] [Chap. XXII. Part II. Evidence for and Reports on Claims. 1. Claims which are made by British subjects against foreign Governments for compensation frequently fail from lack of the necessary evidence in support of them. A considerable period of time must usually elapse between the date when the claim arises and its investigation, and it may be impossible at the later date to obtain evidence which may be of vital importance, though it might have been obtained wbth com parative ease when the claim was first notified to the Consular officer. It is alw r ays possible that the claim may have ultimately to be submitted to a Claims Commission, where the evidence will be subjected to the closest scrutiny and all possible objections raised, and it may, therefore, be useful to call attention to the probable requirements of such a Commission. It will be found advantageous that, in all claims which are filed at the Consulate, the evidence should approximate as far as possible to the following standards. Where parties are unwilling to take the trouble to collect the evidence necessary to support their claims, and to put it fonvard in the proper form, it is unlikely that the claim is worthy of serious attention. 2. It is essential for the claimant to establish the fact that he is a British subject. It may be assumed that a Claims Commission will accept as sufficient evidence the fact that the claimant is in possession of a valid British passport, and where such is the case a note showing the place of issue, date and serial number of the passport and the description of the national status of the holder given therein (see Chapter XXYI, paragraph 6) should be annexed to the papers. If the claim arose at a time when certificates of registration were still issued and the claimant is in possession of one, the certificate should be annexed to the papers, as this will equally serve as evidence of nationality. If the claimant holds neither a passport nor such a certificate of registration, the Consul should be guided by paragraph 23 of Chapter XXY and Annex IV to that chapter, and the documents which the claimant can produce to establish his British nationality, or certified copies thereof, should be annexed to the papers. . should be borne in mind that it is necessary that the claimant should be a British subject both at the time when the c aim arose and at the time when it is presented to the foreignChap. XXII.] [PROTECTION—CLAIMS. Government concerned, and that if he has lost his British nationality in the interval, the claim cannot be presented. Where the claim is put forward by a company, they should produce a certified copy of the certiftcate of registration under the Companies. Acts in force in the United Kingdom or in the particular Dominion or Colony in which the company was formed. It should be remembered, however, that where a companv is virtually a foreign body owing to the great hulk of the share holders being foreigners or to other causes, the fact that the com pany is registered in the British dominions will not necessarily obtain for it the protection of His Majesty’s Government. Where a claim is made by a partnership or unincorporated Syndicate the nationality of each partner or member should be ascertained. Consular officers should not accept claims from partnerships or firms unless evidenee is given to show that they are substantially British in their constitution. The nationality of a British ship is proved by a certified copy of the certificate of registry. In the case of British-protected persons, evidence will be required of the status of the person which entitles him to British protection. For this purpose a passport or certificate of registration will suffice, as in the case of British subjects. If neither can be produced, evidence will be required that the claimant is a native, national or subject of one of the territories referred to in Part I, paragraph 10, and Annex to this chapter. 3 In considering the form in which the evidenee should be presented, and the amount of evidence necessary to support the claim, it must be borne in mind that claims which are submitted to a Commission undergo the severest scrutiny, and that all possible objections will not improbably be taken. It is not possible to lay down more than general rules as to the form of the evidence. If any particular mode of placing evidence on record, such as the depositions of witnesses before a Judge, is customary in a country, it is desirable that that course should be adopted. In such case care should be taken to see that the documents bear all necessary stamps and signatures. Statutory declarations or affidavits made on oath before a Consul or other competent authority would in all probability be accepted by any Commission. Mere signed statements or letters addressed to the Consul or other people are, technically speaking, worthless, and Consular officers should warn claimants that, if better evidence cannot be supplied, they run great risk of the claim failing altogether. 4. The evidence must establish not only that the loss or damage occurred, but that the Government of the country are responsible for it. For instance, the evidence in claims for robbery or violence must not only show that the injury took place, but that8 PROTECTION-CLAIMS.] [Chap. XXII. it was done under circumstances that render the Government responsible, as, for instance, if it was done by an agent of the Government, e.g., a policeman or soldier acting under the orders of an officer; or, if the wrong-doer is a private individual, that the Government or their officers knowingly instigated or permitted it, or that they might have prevented it by the exercise of due diligence and reasonable care. Where claims are made for compensation for damage done bv insurgents in armed insurrection against a Government which was unable to control them, claimants should be reminded that His Majesty’s Government do not regard a Government as liable in such cases unless that Government were negligent and might have prevented the damage arising, or unless they pay compensation either to their own citizens or subjects or to other foreigners in similar cases, or unless the rebellion has been successful and the insurgent party has been installed in power. 5. The evidence must establish with precision the dates when and places where the damage occurred and the circumstances in which it happened. 6. Claims must be presented in the fullest detail. It is of no use for a shopkeeper to state merely that his shop has been robbed to the extent of so many pounds, or for a householder to say that his furniture has been destroyed, and was worth so much. A list as detailed as possible should be appended to the affidavit, and the deponent should swear that it is correct. 7. The evidence of the claimant should, as far as possible, he supported by the affidavits of other persons as to every part of the claim. Such corroborative affidavits are of very little value if the deponent merely states that he knows what the claimant says is true, and that the claim is correct; they should set out all the facts which the deponent knows. 8 Where a claim is put forward by an agent or solicitor on behalf of another individual the power of attorney or other authority to the agent or solicitor to make the claim should be produced, and either the original or certified copy should be annexed to the affidavits. this does not apply to the manager or secretary of a Joint Stock Company. 9. Where documents relating to claims are to be presented to f° re igu Government through the Secretary of State for Toreign Aftairs, and the documents are forwarded to the Foreign Office for t iat purpose, the original documents, and not copies, should be sent, and copies should be retained in the archives. Copies should also be supplied of the text of any foreign law, ecree, sentence, or regulation material to the claim; copies of9 Chap. XXII.] [PROTECTION.—CLAIMS. depositions on oath, formal protests, declarations, statements of parties or witnesses, and legal documents which may be referred o .n or form part of t ie claim should be appended; the full names and descriptions of the parties or their agents should be mven iO When pecuniary claims upon a foreign Government, or upon His Majesty s Government, are either made directly or sanctioned or supported by a Consular officer, he should furnish a statement of the data, basis, or mode of estimate or calculation upon which he has determined the amount. _ Where losses or damages have been experienced by British subjects m consequence of insurrection, military requisition im pressment, or seizure,, and so forth, for which they intend to make pecuniary claims against foreign Governments, such details should be supplied by the Consular officer (independently of the statements of the parties) as may enable His Majesty’s Government to form an opinion as to the real merits and character, as well as the fair amount of the claims, which are, in these cases, frequently exa®- gerated. * ° 11. A Consulai officer should be very cautious as to expressin 0 ’ to individuals an opinion on the merits of any claim they may conceive themselves to have on His Majesty’s Government or on a foreign Government, as an opinion given either directly or indirectly to the parties interested may tend, on the one hand, to raise false expectations, and, on the other, to embarrass His Majesty’s Govern ment in dealing with the case.PROTECTION-CLAIMS.] Chap.

In the course of correspondence that has taken place in the matter, the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has informed the Government of Bombay that as Bahrein is not a British Protect orate, nor part of the British Empire, a British passport even if it bears an Empire-wide endorsement should be specifically endorsed for Bahrein, in order to be available for that place. In this connection I am to invite the attention of the Government of India to Foreign and Political Department memorandum No.869-G, dated the 18th June 1918, in which it was stated that all subjects of States in the Persian Gulf and of the King of the Hedjaz should be treated as British protected persons in the matter of passports. The subsequent letter from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department Jo.927-G, dated the 15th August 1923, in which it was stated that the orders contained in the foregoing memorandum were cancelled in so far as they concern subjects of Muscat,Kuwait of the King of Hedjaz, have led the Government of Bombay assume than Bahrein is still a British protectorate. Another reason for this assumption is that a Bahre ^overnmer^'-r I mGovernment proclamation (co# enclosed) which has been received from the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf lays down that all Persians, who intend to »» t . their pass5orts one of the British Consuls prior to travelling. A British visa can only be placed on a foreign passport if the foreigner intends to proceed to a country which British juBisdiction, and therefore, if Bahrein was not a British Protectorate, there would be no necessity of a British visa for that place. I am accordingly to request that the Government of Bombay may be informed at an early date whether Bahrein should still be considered as a British protectorate, and if so, whether British passports which bear an Empire-wide endorsement should be specifically endorsed for Bahrein.

Since, however Bahrein has no officials abroad wlio can give such visas the ' service is performed for the Bahrein Government by British 3. A somewhat similar analogy occurs in the case of the 'Iraq Government who enlist the services, of H.B.M's Consular officers in places vT/iers they hs,v© not* as yet* 3&gt;opoin'b6d 'their own representatives. J 4. It does not therefore follow that Bahrein is considered to &lt; be a British Protectorate simply because British officials perform passport duties oh behalf of the Bahrein Gbvernment and I would request that the Bombay Government should be informed that visas are required for British and foreign subiects alike. Hitherto the orders on the subject issued by the Bahrein Government have been somewhat loosely and ambiguously worded. They have, however, just started issuing their own passports and I forward for the information of the Government of India a copy of Bahrein Government Proclamation No.5 of 1349 introducing the revised procedure. A copy of the proclamation has been sent to the Government of Bombay.Copy of a letter No .1784.dated Bushire, the 2nd August 193o, from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, SSmla. I have the honour to refer to letter No .2229/30 dated the 23rd May 1930 from the India Office to the Government of India regarding the question of visa requirements for foreigners visit|ng Koweit, Bahrein and M u scat. 2. The present position is as follows:- RAHREIN A British visa is insisted upon for all travellers except Bahreinis landing at Bahrein,British and foreigner alike. In this connection I would invite a reference to ny letter No.1772 dated the 31st July 1930 with which was forwarded a copy of the latest orders issued by the Bahrein Government on tne subject. KOfETlh A passport control system is just being started at '''Koweit and in future no foreigners will be allowed to enter Koweit unless thay hajre a properly visaed passport. MUSCAT. A foreigner arriving at Muscat is now allowed to land until his passport and such other particulars as are available« nave been examined by the Ruler himself or his Council of State, with whom the decision rests whether it is desirable &lt;r not {.hat he should land. 3. No British visa is required, though the Ruler has never raised objection to their issue. 4. Entries of European foreigners to Muscat are rare. 5. I would suggest that the practice of granting visas for these Arabs States be continued, if possiole, and that Consular Instructions be amended accordingly.nwynwuimriiui Copy of a letter No.P*C.936^ dated Bombay Castle, the 7th August 1930, from the Ag.Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, to the Foreign Secretary to the Oovernment of India, Foreign and Political Department. Subject:- Issue of passports to Bahrein subjects. In continuation of my letter No .P.C.938,dated the 2nd instant I am directed by the Grovernor in Council to state that the Procfemation of the Government of Bahrein, wherein it is stated that - Bahrein is an independent Arab State, and that that Government will issue its own passports to its subjects in future, gives rise to the following points as regards the grant of passport facilities to those who are now resident in India, and who desire to return to their own home or to travel abroad; (1) should the passport issuing authorities in India continue •oo give Certificates of Identity to those subjects of Bahrein who are resident in India, and who 4 desire to return to Bahrein or travel to any other destination, or should these subjects be required to apply to their own Government for a national passport. (2) If the validity of the passports issued by the. Government of Bahrein expire whilst the holders are in India, should they be Tfcnewed by the passport issuing authorities in India? ‘'if so, what fees should be charged? (3) Since the Bahrein Government proclamation (copy of which was forwarded with my letter No.P.0.938, dated the 14th June 1930) requires that passports of Persians - and a s a natter of fact of all persons coming from India - should be«r British Consular visas, should these visas continue uo be given, or shoiid Bahrein be included in the same category as Muscat, the Hedjaz, etc., for which British visas on passports of foreigners are not required? Presumably, since the iore- going Proclamation has not been cancelled and no orders been received to the contrary, visas should continue to be ^ive on behalf of the Bahrein Government as m the case o± Iraq. 3.

VO * ^&gt;v/ JT PvWA Under Secretary of State, wirfr ILt) It seeras desirable to find out, what we do not know at present, whether foreigners visiting Bahrein, etc., are required to have a British visa. The need for the enquiry has been felt in connection with references from the P. &amp; J. Department on papers regarding the Anglo-Czech and Anglo- French Visa Abolition Agreements, and the point at issue is explained in the draft now submitted. J.P. Gibson. The U)vemment of India’s reply to our express letter of 2 nd May on P. 2229/30 should throw some light on the point. But it is, I suggest, on the whole worth making a specific enquiry on the lines of Mr. Gibson’s draft. In the first place, the question is of importance m connection with visa abolition arrangements. Two cases only of this nature have so far arisen - Czechoslovakia and France. In the case of the agreement with Czechoslovakia (see P. &amp; J. 2239/30 below), the Czechoslovak enquiry is so couched as to enable us to omit in replying to them any reference to the Arab principalities in the Persian Gulf. - or are Czechoslovak subjects in practice perhaps very likely to have much to do with 'the Gulf area. The position is less simple in the case of the French Government (and here it will be seen (compare P. &amp; J. 2362/30 below)'^the i^oreigi Office have made definite proposals on the subject). I ranee uas - or had - definite interests in Muscat, and French sloops pay yearly visits to the Gulf. Apart from visa abolition, it may be remarkeo thaw in the last two or three months we have had two or three instances in which persons of non-British nationality have been anxious to proceed to the Gulf. P. 2229 contains a general/general enquiry fronia ilnu of ilmericsn travel agents) v/e have recently with some difficulty headed off the Italians from an attempted exploration by air of the Rub-al-Khali, vhich would almost certainly have involved visits to Bahrein and the Trucial States; and a request by a young German for permission to visit Muscat is at the moment under reference to the Government of India. In the circumstances, I suggest that we might write to the Government of India as in the draft. A reply to the Foreign Office letter of 8 th May on P. &amp; J. 2362 about the Anglo-French Visa Abolition Agreement could be postponed pending the Government of India's reply: the'matter cannot be one of urgency. The draft reply which has already been approved in the case of the ikiglo-Czechoslovak Agreement might issue, since it is proposed, in replying to the Czechoslovak Government, to make no reference to the position of the Persian Gulf Principalities. 71. *In any further ^PMminication , this subject, please quote f No- E 1581/1581/91. j a ,a address— not to any person by name, but to— i • ‘ The Under-Secretary of State, ” Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. 1 0 3 0 I &amp; Foreign OPFicfe' S.W.l. 3rd April, 1930.

As far as I know, up to the present, Mohammedans only are allowed to go to Mecca and Medina, and that any traveler entering Arabia does so at his own risk. I think, however, that there is some Arabian representative who probably would be located in London. If you could give us some definite information about this matter you would indeed oblige. Yours very respectfully, (Signed) Kurt G.W.Luedecke, Editor P.S.

Your obedient Servant, 1 tpolitical Department. Please see previous submission on P. 7350/29 below, ao far as vie are concerned, the draft is innocuous, except that I would suggest that the second sentence of paragraph 2 should be redrafted as follows:- ’’These in the case of the HadrarnQjat should be forwarded to the Resident at Aden: m the case of the Trucial Sheikhdoms to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; and in other cases to the Political xlgents of the States concerned.” I submit a draft letter to the Poreign Office. Mr. Wakely.asked that before letterCTssued we should ascertain more precisely what exactly was covered by the phrase 'Standing Instructions” in paragraph 1 , sub-head 3 , of the draft Foreign Office letter to Basra on this paper. The Foreign Office were asked for the information in question on the 31 st December. It has only now been produced - see the letterffrom the Passport Control Department on In the light of the explanation given by the Passport Control Department, I submit that we need not press tins point further, ihe position as regards the entry of Germans and of Russians into the ports of the Arab littoral has been further investigated. As regards Germans the various Arab Rulers - Muscat, Bahrein/Ill f i; i i Bahrein, Koweit and the Trucial Chiefs - were consulted in 1925, and replied (see P. 895/25)'that they were not prepared to agree to the entry of Germans. The German Ambassador was informed accordingly in the Foreign Office letter of 23rd April, 1925, on P. 1271/25. A further question arose at the end of the same year (P. 64/26) consequent on the refusal of the Gheikh of Dabai to permit a German vessel to land cargo at that port. The German Ambassador was on this occasion informed that the Sheikh had been told that, so far as His Majesty’s Government were concerned, he was at liberty to permit trade between natives of Dabai and nationals of all foreign Powers. His majesty’s Government would not, however, feel justified in interfering further with the Sheikh's liberty of action.' No general passport instructions as regaras the grant of visas to Germans for the territories m question appear to have been issued. As regards the Russians, the position is that in 1928 Iraq was advised to confom to the practice of the Egyptian Government, *o had prohibited the landing of cr^s from Russian steamers in their territories.

Passports and Endorsements. British Subjects and British Protected Persons, british passports may, as a general rule, be made available by endorsement at the time of issuing for travel anywhere within the British Empire, whethei the holder intends to use it for such travel immediately or not.. Ihis endorsement should, however, not be given in any cases where the issuing otficei lins good onus© to consider tlint some measure of restraint on the movements of the holder is desirable. In such cases he has full discretion to endorse the passport only for the country or countries (foreign or British) to which the holder contemplates immediate travel, provided always that the issuing officer is not aware of any sufficient reason for withholding the endorsement for any such country and, in the case of British territory, does not consider it necessary ’ to refer first to the Government of India or of the Dominion or Colony concerned. Under this rule the British Empire endorsement should not be given, nor should a passport directly valid for India be granted, except after reference to the India Office, or to the Government of India, in any of the following cases : — (1) Persons named in any list or instruction circulated with regard to passports for India. (2) Persons known as having been convicted of any grave offence, or as likely to cause disorder or foment sedition. 2 . Visas .—There will be two classes of visa for India:—(I) The transit visa ; ( 2 ) the non-transit visa. 3. Aliens other than Russians .—Subject to the provisions hereafter mentioned, aliens—other than Russians—who are of good character and standing, may ordinarily be granted visas for India. Visas for India should not be granted, unless after reference to the India Office or the Government of India, to any person named in a Passport Control Department or Home Office circular as one to whom visas for British territory should not be granted without reference, or to whom visas for the United Kingdom should be refused, nor to any person named in any list or instruction circulated with regard to the grant of visas for India. Visas should not be granted to any person who, so far as is known:— ( 1 ) is not in a position to support himself and his dependants; ( 2 ) is a lunatic, idiot, or mentally deficient; ( 3 ) has been sentenced in a foreign country for any extradition crime; ( 4 ) is the subject of a deportation order in force under the Foreigners Act, 1864; ( 5 ) has been prohibited from landing by the Government of India or the Secretary of State for India; ; ( 6 ) is a person likely to cause disorder or foment sedition by reason of his revolutionary views, or one whose presence in India is politically undesirable ; or ( 7 ) fails to satisfy such other requirements as may be prescribed by* any general or special instructions of the Secretai} of State foi India or of the Government of India. Particular care should be taken in the scrutiny of any applications of vouug women proposing to travel alone; where such an applicant is 11 ^ e to produce reliable evidence that she is proceeding to India for a bona fide purpose, and that she will be in a position to maintain herself adequately or will be otherwise suitably provided for, reference should be made to tae India Office or to the Government of India before a visa is gramed. 3247 1000 11.28•7 4. Alien Missionaries .—These are subject to special arrangements described in the separate printed Memoranda, A, B, and C, revised copies of which, dated November 1925, have been circulated. The efleet of these memoranda is that aliens desiring to proceed to India for missionary work ma}^ receive visas (unless from other points of view there is any reason to doubt their desirability), without reference to the India Office, at smht of any document certifying their identity which is signed or countersigned on behalf of the Missionary Conference of Great Britain and Ireland the Foreign Missions Conference of North America, or Cardinal Archbishop Bourne. Except as provided below, the applications of all other alien missionaries desiring to proceed to India should be referred to the Foreign Office for transmission to the India Office, and a reply should be awaited before a visa is granted; an exception is made in the case of missionaries on furlough from India who are in possession of “no objection” certificates from a Local Government in India; a visa for India may be ^ranted at sight of such a certificate. 5. Former Enemy Aliens .—Former enemy aliens are no longer subject to any special restrictions as such, but special care should be exercised in scrutinising their applications to ensure that they satisfy the general conditions laid down in para. 3 above. When there is doubt whether'a formei enemy alien falls within any of the prohibited classes defined in that paragraph the case should be referred. Reference should also be made before granting a visa to any ex-enemy alien who — ( 1 ) has previously resided in India ; ( 2 ) desites to proceed to India as a surveyor or prospector, or for any other similar occupation which might afford facilities for gaining information of military value. 0.

I have got from tie Foreign Office, and attach, a copy of chapter 22 of Consular Instructions and of the revised i\nnex. The explanation of the omission from the Annex of Koweit is probably that at the time when the Annex was drawn up, its precise international position was not yet quite clear. I agree, however, with the Foreign Office that there is no objection now to its inclusion in the same category as Bahrein, and that the Consul at Basra may be authorised to grant visas for Koweit and the other Arabian coast territories, as described in the Annex to chapter 22. I agree entirely with the criticism in para,graph 3 of the Foreign Office letter of the inclusion under the heading ' British Protected States” of the territories in the Persian CrUlf end on the Hadramauti coast of Arabia. I think that the best solution of the question would be that suggested by the Foreign Office in paragraph 4, and I agree that the Kingdom of Nepal may also be included under the proposed, new heading - “D. Certain other Territories'. On a minor point, however, we are no 3222a 5000 11/28P &amp; J. 2330/29. India Office, Whitehall,S.W.l. 10th August 1929 .

Mr. Benn also concurs in the proposal to revise the above-mentioned Annex so as to place in a separate category the territories mentioned in your letter, including the Kingdom of Nepal, which are not under formal British protection.

For this reason/ the Secretary of state considers that it would he preferable *&gt; adopt the first of the two alternative courses suggested in paragraph 2 of your letter under reply vis. that a reference to Iraq shouldbe included with the mention m rs-r vnri T of Chapter XXII of the Of Egypt in paragraph 11 of Part I —^^ + hp -^notnote to paragraph 10 v / Instructions.

I arn directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India, copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Basra regarding the grant of visas for the town and territory of Koweit. 2 # It is not clear why in the first instance Koweit was omitted from the list of British Protected States in the Annex to Chapter XXII of the General Instructions to Consular Officers as there would appear to be no objecticn to its inclusion in the same category as Bahrein. Mr. Henderson would suggest, therefore, that, subject to Captain Wedgwood Bern’s concurrence, His Majesty’s Consul at Basra should be authorised to grant visas for Koweit and the other Arabian coast territories as described in the Annex to that Chapter. 3 . At the same time this enquiry raises the Question whether the inclusion in the Annex to Chapter XXII of the Consular Instructions, of the territories In the Persian Gulf, and possibly also of those on the hadramaut coast of Arabia, with which his Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have special treaty relations under the heading 'British Protected States' is altogether desirable. This description is technically inaccurate since the position of His Majesty's Government vis-a-vis these territories is undefined; and, although His Majesty’s Government are no doubt responsible up to a point for the protection of natives of such territories abroad, the rulers of the territories have not, it is Under Secretary of State, understood, India Office.understood, formally accepted British 'protection'. 4. I am to suggest, therefore, for the consideration of Captain Wedgwood Benn, that the above-mentioned territories, and possibly also the Kingdom of Nepal, should be placed in a separate category to be inseted in the Annex after '(c) Mandated Territories' and headed * (D) Certain Other Territories'. The list might then be arranged as follows: (1) Kingdom of Nepal. ( 2 ) Hadramaut. (3) Bahrein and Koweit. (4) Sultanate of Oran. (5) The Trucial Sheikhdoms. « j-f t-his pi oposal meefs wit»ii Capfain Wedgwood Benn* s approval a further revision will he necessary in para.1C of Chapter XXII, to which a section entitled M (d) Certain Other Territories w will have to he add/ed. 5* If the Annex is to he revised the word 'Mesopotamia' should presumably now he omitted under 'Mandated Territories”; and Mr. Henderson is therefore suggesting for the consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies that either a reference to Iraq should he included with the mention of Egypt in paragraph II of Chapter XXII, or else that 'Iraq' should he placed at the'' head of the list of 'Certain Other Territories' which it is proposed to add to the Annex.

Advice, Assistance and Protection to be given to British Subjects and British-protected Persons.—Definition of British-protected Persons. Replies to Enquiries from British Subjects and British-protected Persons. 1. A Consular oflicer should give his best advice and assistance to His Majesty’s subjects trading in, residing in, or visiting his district, and should do his utmost to avert and arrange differences among them, or between them and the natives of the country. 2. If British subjects suffer injury, or are likely to suffer injury, either in their persons or property, the Consular officer must uphold rightful interests and privileges, secured by treaty, by due representations in the proper official quarter, made in the manner prescribed by these instructions. He must be temperate and judicious in such representations. 3. If redress cannot be obtained from the local authorities, or if the matter of complaint be not within their jurisdiction, the case must be referred to His Majesty’s Diplomatic representative. I. A Cousular officer should reply to the best of his ability to enquiries addressed to him by British subjects, and also by other persons where such enquiries can properly be answered by him in his official capacity.* He must in any case acknowledge as soon as possible the receipt of all letters addressed to him in that capacity. 5.

When, however, such expenses are inconsiderable and are incurred in pursuance of a trade enquiry from a firm or individual in the United Kingdom, the amounts thereof may he inserted in the Quarterly Accounts with the Foreign Office as “Advances on behalf of the Department of Overseas Trade.” In such cases the amounts chargeable should he notified to the latter Department concurrently with the information in respect of which the expen diture has been incurred, in order that steps may be taken to obtain repayment from the applicants before the information is forwarded to them. 6. Vice-Consuls and Consular agents must be guided by the above instructions, bearing in mind the limitations as to corre spondence with local authorities prescribed in Chapter V. 7. Letters of introduction from the Secretary of State which may be presented to a Consul by visitors are not intended to give any claim to hospitality, but merely to certify that the persons who present them are either personally known to the Secretary of State, or have been recommended to him; they are intro duced to the Consul for such marks of attention and courtesy, short of hospitality, as he may have the opportunity of bestowing upon them. Consuls must clearly understand that letters of introduction must not in any circumstances be construed as committing His Majesty’s Government to the promotion of any particular enterprise, such as specific commercial or industrial undertakings, or applica tions for concessions. Facilities should not be obtained for British subjects who visit foreign towns in order to study conditions of trade and labour, municipal organization, the administration of canals, forests, &amp;c., unless such visitors are furnished with letters of introduction from the Foreign Office, or from the Department of Overseas Trade. 8. In the event of a Consular officer having to report any case of a serious nature affecting British subjects, their rights and interests, in which the intervention of His Majesty’s Government may be required, it is important that he should furnish a full state ment of all the material circumstances, and with this view he should bear m mind— That when any important documents are referred to in a case, oi aie evidently connected with it, a copy of them, or, if preferable, an accurate abstract, should be forwarded.

In all eases of any importance, more especially in those likely to give rise to legal or international questions, a clear and con secutive statement or narrative of the facts, with dates and par ticulars, written in a plain and simple style, and with business-like precision, should be supplied. 9. Although it is the primary duty of Consular officers to offer such protection and assistance as may he in their power to British subjects, it must he borne in mind that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has the right, in his absolute discretion, to refuse to extend British protection or assistance to any particular individual. 10. The provisions of this chapter apply not only to British subjects, as defined in Chapter XXV of the present Instructions, hut also tc persons who enjoy British protection on other grounds (“ British-protected persons ”). Such persons are— * (a.) The natives of British protectorates (b.) The natives of British-protected States, including the native States of India ; (c.) The natives of territories for which His Majesty holds a mandate under Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.f Lists of the territories and States included under these heads are given in the Annex to this chapter. 11. Natives of Egypt form a separate category, regarding which special instructions will be issued from time to time. 12. In some countries, e.g., Turkey, Persia, Morocco and China, a certain measure of special protection is accorded to certain specific classes of persons, e.g., dragomans, cavasses, Con sular clerks and servants, “ semsars ” and “ mokhalats ” in Morocco, and certain persons in the employ of British subjects and firms in * In the case of the Anglo-Egyptian Soudan, only those natives should receive protection who can prove that they are regarded by the authorities of that country as its natives. t In the case of Palestine and Mesopotamia, only those natives should receive protection who have in fact acquired Palestinian or Mesopotamian nationality according to the local nationality laws of those territories. feat &gt;-rl * In the case of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, protection should only be accorded to persons holding Sudanese passporis.

Such protection, however, which is regulated by custom or by agreements between His Majesty’s Government and the respective Governments, is based not on the national status of the persons concerned, but on the special functions which for the time being they may be exercising ; and it does not therefore fall ** within the scope of the present chapter. 13. British subjects and British-{)rotected persons possessing a second nationality cannot receive British protection in the country of their second nationality, although they may be registered as provided for in paragraph 18 of Chapter XXVII of these Instruc tions, and, where the local authorities do not object, they may receive passports in accordance with the terms of paragraph 10 of Chapter XXVI of the Instructions. 14. The fact that a British subject or a British-protected person possesses a second nationality does not debar him from British protection in a country which is not that of his second nationality. 15. Where a British subject or a British-protected person applies to a Consular officer for protection, and the Consular officer thinks that there is reason to believe that he is also a subject or citizen of the country in which he is resident, he may require him to produce evidence that by the local law he is not a subject or citizen of that country.* . ^ should be noted that British-protected persons cannot claim the same right to land, in the United Kingdom as British su qects, and are subject in this respect to the ordinary restrictions imposed on foreigners. n u- i , P ons holding local certificates of naturalization as .British subjects, issued under the local law of one of His Majesty’s self-governing Dominions or Colonies, or of India (see Chapter XXV, paragraph 4 (m)) may only receive the good offices of His p, s , ^ 8 iplomatic and Consular officers as a matter of courtesy, n ml on lul m 1 ^ il lb ' ,ect 1 to ^heir being persons of good character and . r** t °^. a a ^ lc t }° their not having lost their claim to the onf -fin f ?

Ik- In all cases in which a Consular officer receives applications for protection or assistance from British subjects or British-pro tected persons, he should be careful to satisfy himself that the national status of the applicant is such as is claimed. A passport may in general be regarded as constituting sufficient proof of the national status of its holder. If a passport is not produced, the Consular officer should be guided, in the case of persons claiming to be British subjects, by the instructions in Chapter XXV.PROTECTION—CLAIMS.] [Chap. XXII. Part II. Evidence for and Reports on Claims. 1. Claims which are made by British subjects against foreign Governments for compensation frequently fail from lack of the necessary evidence in support of them. A considerable period of time must usually elapse between the date when the claim arises and its investigation, and it may be impossible at the later date to obtain evidence which may be of vital importance, though it might have been obtained with com parative ease when the claim was first notified to the Consular officer. It is always possible that the claim may have ultimately to be submitted to a Claims Commission, where the evidence will be subjected to the closest scrutiny and all possible objections raised, and it may, therefore, he useful to call attention to the probable requirements of such a Commission. It will be found advantageous that, in all claims which are filed at the Consulate, the evidence should approximate as far as possible to the following standards. Where parties are unwilling to take the trouble to collect the evidence necessary to support their claims, and to put it forward in the proper form, it is unlikely that the claim is worthy of serious attention. 2. It is essential for the claimant to establish the fact that he is a British subject. It may be assumed that a Claims Commission will accept as sufficient evidence the fact that the claimant is in possession of a valid British passport, and where such is the case a no e s owing the place of issue, date and serial number of the passport and the description of the national status of the holder given therein (see Chapter .XXVI, paragraph 6) should he annexed vo * claim arose at a time when certificates of 1011 ^ le , s ^ 1 ^ ^ sslle( i and the claimant is in possession of pminii 6 certlficate S . 1 i 0llld annexed to the papers, as this will nmflipv Serve as eTldenc e of nationality.

Government concerned, and that if lie has lost Ms British nationality in the interval, the claim cannot be presented. Where the claim is jmt forward by a company, they should produce a certified copy of the certificate of registration under the Companies Acts in force in the United Kingdom or in the particular Dominion or Colony in which the company was formed. &lt; should be remembered, however, that where a companv is virtually a foreign body owing to the great bulk of the share holders being foreigners or to other causes, the fact that the com pany is registered in the British dominions will not necessarily obtain for it the protection of His Majesty’s Government. Where a claim is made by a partnership or unincorporated Syndicate the nationality of each partner or member should be ascertained. Consular officers should not accept claims from partnerships or firms unless evidence is given to show that they are substantially British in their constitution. The nationality of a British ship is proved by a certified copy of the certificate of registry. In the case of British-protected persons, evidence will be required of the status of the person which entitles him to British protection. For this purpose a passport or certificate of registration will suffice, as in the case of British subjects. If neither can be produced, evidence will be required that the claimant is a native of one of the territories referred to in Part I, paragraph 10, and Annex to this Chapter. 3. In considering the form in which the evidence should be presented, and the amount of evidence necessary to support the claim, it must be borne in mind that claims which are submitted to a Commission undergo the severest scrutiny, and that all possible objections will not improbably be taken. It is not possible to lay down more than general rules as to the form of the evidence. If any particular mode of placing evidence on record, such as the depositions of witnesses before a Judge, is customary in a country, it is desirable that that course should be adopted. In such case care should be taken to see that the documents bear all necessary stamps and signatures. Statutory declarations or affidavits made on oath before a Consul or other competent authority would in all probability be accepted by any Commission. Mere signed statements or letters addressed to the Consul or other people are. technically speaking, worthless, and Consular officers should warn claimants that, if better evidence cannot be supplied, they run great risk of the claim failing altogether. 4. The evidence must establish not only that the loss or damage occurred, but that the Government of the country are responsible for it. For instance, the evidence in claims for robbery or violence must not only show that the injury took place, but thatPROTECTION-CLAIMS.] [Chap. XXII. it was done under circumstances that render the Government responsible, as, for instance, if it was done by an agent of the Government, e.g., a policeman or soldier acting under the orders of an officer; or, if the wrong-doer is a private individual, that the Government or their officers knowingly instigated or permitted it or that they might have prevented it by the exercise of due diligence and reasonable care. Where claims are made for compensation for damage done by insurgents in armed insurrection against a Government which was unable to control them, claimants should be reminded that His Majesty’s Government do not regard a Government as liable in such cases unless that Government were negligent and mio-ht have prevented the damage arising, or unless they pay compensation either to their own citizens or subjects or to other foreigners in similar cases, or unless the rebellion has been successful and the insurgent party has been installed in power. 5. The evidence must establish with precision the dates when and places where the damage occurred and the circumstances in which it happened. 6. Claims must be presented in the fullest detail. It is of no use for a shopkeeper to state merely that his shop has been robbed to the extent of so many pounds, or for a householder to say that his furniture has been destroyed, and was worth so ranch. A list as detailed as possible should be appended to the affidavit and the deponent should swear that it is correct. 7. The evidence of the claimant should, as far as possible, be supported by the affidavits of other persons as to every part of the claim. Such corroborative affidavits are of very little value if the deponent merely states that he knows what the claimant savs is true and that the claim is correct; they should set out all the facts winch the deponent knows. hoi u* ? hei ? 1 9 is P ut forward by an agent or solicitor on e lait ot another individual the power of attorney or other authority Qr&gt;a 01 solicitor to make the claim should be produced, affidavits 61 ' ^ 0riglnal or certifiecl C0 Py should be annexed to the Stock' Clompany 10 ^ ^ ie mana g er or secretary of a Joint the forph^w^ 6 ^ ocllmen t s relating to claims are to be presented to Afhn'i’u i meinmen f through the Secretary of State for Foreign that nnvnn if Cl0c . ur p en f s ar e forwarded to the Foreign Office for and eom'pc ^ ^ 011 § lna ^ documents, and not copies, should be sent, and C0 P les sl !°uld be retained in the archives. decree^pnn! 1 ° a ^ S ° su PP^ e( f °f the text of any foreign law, nee, oi regulation material to the claim; copies of9 Chap.

When pecuniary claims upon a foreign Government, or upon His Majesty’s Government, are either made directly, or sanctioned or supported, by a Consular officer, he should furnish a statement of the data, basis, or mode of estimate or calculation upon which he has determined the amount. Where losses or damages have been experienced by British subjects in consequence of insurrection, military requisition, im pressment, or seizure, and so forth, for which they intend to make pecuniary claims against foreign Governments, such details should he supplied by the Consular officer (independently of the statements of the parties) as may enable His Majesty’s Government to form an opinion as to the real merits and character, as well as the fair amount of the claims, which are, in these cases, frequently exag gerated. 11. A Consular officer should be very cautious as to expressing to individuals an opinion on the merits of any claim they may conceive themselves to have on His Majesty’s Government or on a foreign Government, as an opinion given either directly or indirectly to the parties interested may, on the one hand, tend to raise false expectations, and, on the other, to embarrass His Majesty’s Govern ment in dealing with the case.10 PROTECTION-CLAIMS.] [Annex ], Chap.

Rection 2 should, in view of the recent decision as to the duration of the validity of passports, be amended by the substitution of the words 'five years' for 'two years' Section 3 imposes a penalty which is unnecessarily severe; and Mr. Ramsay MacDonald considers that a fine of not more ‘5, 0. 0. than five pounds should suffice for the purpose. It is proposed therefore to amend this section by substituting for the words after 'punishable' the following words: - -5. 0, 0, 'with a fine not exceeding five pounds'. 3.

With reference to your remark that there is no reason to insist on the issue of passports (except for travel purposes) in the case of the Oil Company's employees, I see from your official letter No. T.2060/258/378 that Colonel Trevor had put up to you a proposal for making passports compulsory.
