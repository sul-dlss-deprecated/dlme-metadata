The inhabitants of Masfut, a village near Hattn, which is under Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan, Chief of the Nai'm of Buraimi, have recently appealed., to the Shaikh of Ajrnan, who is also of the Nai'm tribe, for protection as Shaikh Saqr was unable to protect them from various incursions by Beni Ka’ab tribesmen who are hostile to Saqr since he blinded and murdered certain Beni Ka'ab tribesmen on charges of complicity in a plot to assassinate him. The Shaikh of Ajman responded and it is reported that he has gone to 'Masfut with building material with the object of building a tower there. 92. BAPCO . BAPCO are laying a twin pipe line to that already existing /fromfrom Saudi Arabia to the Bahrain refinery. ^This means that not quite double the previous amount of crude oil will cone here ior refining. The Shaikh of Bahrain’s reaction to this has been naturally unfavourable. However, the Company's intention to drill in next December a deep (up to 13,0€0 feet) exploratory boring may compensate him for the feeling that his own wells should provide all che crude oil for the Bahrain refinery. S3. LOCAL AFFAIRS - BAHRAIN. (i) On the 21st the final of the local inter-schools basket ball tournament was attended by Shaikh Abdulla bin Hamad al Khalifah, G.I.E., Minister of Education and Mr. C.D. Belgrave, C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government. An exhibition match between members of the staff and students was also played. (ii) The annual Sports Day of the Bahrain Schools was held on the 30th. The events included displays of physical drill, trick cycling and a staff donkey race. They were watched by the Hon’Lie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, His Highness Shaikh Salman, Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad, Education Minister, and Mr. C.D. Belgrave. (iii) on the 30th Shaikh Abdullah, son of Shaikh Khalifah bin Salman, a step brother and cousin of His Highness, was married to the daughter of Ahmad bin Khalifah bin Ghatam. Celebrations^were held for 3 days before the marriage and included a dancing display at unm in Khalilah. Some of the R.A.F. were invited to attend /chi s and it is said that ladies of Shaikh Abdullah’s family mixed with them unveiled. This is unprecedented and mentioned locally wiuh hated breath. (iv) No one can fail to be impressed by the amount^of building, both for residential and business purposes, in and around Manama ^ town. Apart from the work being undertaken by British firms, sucn as Gray Mackenzies and P.C.L., local merchants are now spending tho-ir war profits on new houses. The Bahrain Government too has a^praise worthy scheme under way for new Customs H°uses, government oifices caid shops built on a uniform plan. This, however, is solely con centrated around the main square of Manama &lt; town and the r esult will be that, as in so many Eastern and other cities, the facade will be comparatively imposing while, behind it, the^'old town' remains a warren of narrow, insanitary streets, crumbling baked-e^rth mansions, mean shops and barasti (wicker) huts for the poor. (v) The snuggling into Bahrain of Hashish and its consumption are said to be on the increase. 94.- SHIPPING.

It would appear that the Shaikh of Sharjah has lost ill sense of proportion in his precautions against what he considers to be Shaikh Humaid bin Abdullah's designs on his life. Not only has he employed, at very considerable expense, a number of bedouin to man everv tower, mosque, and double-storeyed building in Sharjah and the village of Khai^ but he has engaged and armed 40 Baluchis recently reduced from the R.A.F. establishment. No traffic can approach Sharjah from Khan by day or night without being fired on; patrols on foot and in Jeeps nightly move on the Dubai border; suspected spies are arrested and imprisoned on the flimsiest p ■e texts;, while the town guards, demonstrating their wakefulness wich shots and eerie shrieking, combine with startled dogs, donkeys, and cocks to turn night into Bedlam. All of this because the Shaikh of Sharjah's very black conscience suggests to ^him that, now that Dubai is no longer involved with Abu Dhabi, he will certainly help Shaikh Humaid (the nephew of the man supplanted^by_ the present Ruler of Sharjah) to turn him out, if only as a^reprisal^for Sharjah's surreptitious aid to Abu Dhabi. Humaid, for his part, ^ is a drunkard and an opium-eater whose most constant pre-occupa cion, « •. • -7 • J _.r» 4--U ~4.’ T+- A r, r. 1 w-r apart from liquor, is Mis courtes; in of the moment. It is generally thought that, whatever his designs against Sharjah nay have been (there is no evidence that he has any now unless they have recently been put into his head by has tht Sharjah's % obvious panic), he no longer resolution or the energy to carry them out; but it is ironical that the nephew of the man deprived of the Shaikhdom should be able to reduce his uncle's supplanter to a state of terror and, what is far more difficult, induce him co spend money freely, simnly by following his natural inclination to get riotously drunk.

The presentation of news in this publication is, not unnaturally, somewhat oleaginous, but like all BAPCO activity it no doubt serves the purposes for which it is intended. The following is a fair sample?- # ' M AY - A RECORD HONTH . Shipments of oil from Sitra during the month of May climbed beyond all previous records for any single month in the history of 'Bapco'. Thirty seven tankers loaded bulk cargo, two cargo ships loaded drummed products and eighteen vessels called at Sitra for bunkers only.

Captain Georg Anderson our busy port captain, is justly proud of his spritely Mariners and all of us can be equally proud of each and every Depart ment who co-operated to make such a fine record^ possible.

The Ruler of Sharjah has recently complained to the Political Agent about, as he alleges, 'defamations dnd falsehoods' in the book 'The Sand Kings of 'Oman' by Mr. Raymond O'Shea.- Mr. O'Shea was Station Manager at Sharjah aerodrome from December 1944 to May 1945. His book is full of inaccuracies. In fact, the truth about the Trucial Shaikhs, if published, could not fail to constitute a libel, in view of the legal maxim that 'the greater the truth the greater the libel'. Put Mr. O’Shea was not to know that. 254. DUBAI . On the 14th a party composed of 60 Manasir tribes men carried out a raid on a place called Marmum in Dubai territory, killed two ^men, stole 8 camels and 7 rifles and rook into captivity five men whom they subsequently released.

One of the raiders was wounded and taken to Abu Dhabi for treatment. 255. QA TAR . The^health of His Excellency Shaikh Abdulla bin Jasim A1 Thani, C.I.E., Ruler of Qatar, has again been the cause of anxiety, fie has now recovered and is convalescing, but he^is an old man and is unwilling to abide by/regime /the prescribed by his medical advisers.

PALESTINE - LOCAL R EP ERCUSSION S, Bahrain, normally free from political disturbances- 2 - seems unfortunately to have joined the rahks of the other Middle Eastern countries where political activity is accompanied by violence and destruction. The first of the three days set aside in these countries for demonstrations against the partition of Palestine was only marked here bV processions of schoolboys and youths followed by a rabble of women and loafers who marched round the town chanting slogans. A few minor incidents tooK place, two cars, one belonging to a Jew and one ( carrying Jews, were stopped, and stones and mud were thrown at them, An elderly deaf Jew was beaten up by some unknown persons, and a doctor of the American Mission was stopped by a crowd shouting, 'Down with America, Zionists, Russians and Communists', mud was also thrown at the houses of Jews and some Iraqi Christians, and the windows of the Eastern Bank, several of whose staff are Jews, were broken. On the second day, there was a larger procession but no incidents, on the third day, the procession was larger again, and even more highly organised including an open truck used as a rostrum for speakers. It conducted itself in an, orderly way until it reached a building used as a synagogue where a mass of people with it thrust into the building'. The real organisers of the demonstration then seemed to have disappeared, and the synagogue was looted by the lower and tougher element of the town, many of them non-Bahrainis. Within an hour 12 houses and three shops belonging to jews were looted. The police seemed to , have behaved fairly well but found, as is not unusual in dealing with mobs in oriental cities, that on suppressing a riot in one quarter it broke out in another. About 70 prisoners were taken, but these only represented a fraction of the rioters. It is hardly possible to estimate the amount of damage done; here again, only a small proportion of the looted property has been recovered. On the evening of the disturbances, a curfew was declared and an Elan pub lished forbidding the meeting of more than five persons. No further disturbances have since taken place. The instigators of these and of other undesirable political activity in the island are believed to be a set of young men who describe themselves variously as the 'National League', 'popular Front' etc; ordinarily, they confine themselves to pamphleteering and a great deal of talk, but they appear to be quick to seize advantage of any opportunity to make trouble, and it is feared that their recent success may have emboldened them.* The same element, it is reported, have been discussing plans to sabotage the Bahrain Petroleum Company's refinery and other works, but Ibn Baud's declaration of policy towards his oil companies has had a good effect, and there is now less talk^on these lines. One schemer is said to have proposed letting loose cats soaked in paraffin-oil near the petrol installations. 1 The Jewish community is allowing itself to be mulcted of large sums of 'protection money' paid, invariably by cheque to those who profess, in most cases quite falsely, to be able to shield them from further disturbance. The small community of Jews here - there are only a few hundred - have also broad cast their sympathy with, the 'Arab Cause'. I /263. Strikes..... //279. Cw&lt;-V{^ • \0. v - I ^ No. ^4 of 1947.
