BAKHTIARI COUNTRY NORTH OF KARON RIVER, COMPILED IN THE DIVISION OF THE CHIEF OF THE^STAFF, ARMY HEAD QUARTERS, INDIA. SIMLA: PRINTED AT GOVERNMENT MONOTYPE PRESS, 1910.PREFACE TO PART III. This Report was compiled by Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, 32nd Sikh Pioneers, whilst on duty in South-West Persia in command of the “ Indian Oil Guards,” a detachment of 20 men sent out in December 1907 for the protection of the European employes and works of the Oil Company at Maidan Minaftun. The writer has not been able to travel himself over the greater part of the district described in this volume, and has therefore had to rely to some extent upon Major Sawyer’s report, 1891, for geographical details, largely supplemented by more recent informa tion. But in the main the report is based upon new material, obtained to a large extent from Captain D. L. R. Lorimer, I.A., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz, whose official duties and extensive tours during the past three years have brought him into close touch with the Bakhtiari, with the result that the glamour that had come to be associated with their name has been dispelled, and that they have been shown in their true light. Whatever they once were, the Bakhtiari have now been in contact with Persians for sufficiently long to enable them to assimilate most of the vices of the latter, whilst at the same time losing much of their independ ence of character. Part I of this report (Bakhtiari Garmsir) should be consulted for details regarding the low hills south of the Karun, and Part II for information regarding ’Arabistan. Each part contains route reports, and an Index, and may be looked upon as a military handbook to the district dealt with, including all information of importance recorded in the larger route books, or the Gazetteers. All officers to whom this book is issued are particularly request ed to bring immediately to the notice of this office any errors they may notice, and also to forward from time to time any additional authenticated information which may reach them.

The country dealt with in this part of the Report is that north of the Karun under the control of the Ilkhani and Ilbegi of the Bakh- tiari. Taking off from the Karun at Kaleh-i-Rustam and Kaleh-i- Dukhtar, 4 miles north of Gotwand, the approximate boundary runs along the foot of the hills north-west to the point at which the Diz emerges from the hills, whence for at least some distance up its course its left bank forms the western boundary of the Bakhtiari country. The foot-hills in this south-west comer are occupied by certain Lang tribes who migrate in summer to the neighbourhood of Chehil Chashmeh on the left bank of the Zindeh Rud opposite Wargun. Somewhat questionable, however, is the assertion that some Bakhtiari will be found to make, that the west branch of the Diz, in its upper course, forms their western boundary. When visited by Sawyer in 1889, Baznawi and Makhadi on the eastern branch of the Diz, were in the hands of LvristanLi rs and it is probable that the real boundary keeps along th's branch, but a few miles to the east of it, the valley itself rema ning in the hands of Luristan tribes. Between Faraidan and the lower end of the Silakhur Valley, at the head of which Burfvjird stands, is a tract known as Japilak, occupied by Chekar Lang Bakhtiari, whose chief, the Shahab-ul- Lashkar, pays revenue to the Governor of Bumjird, but also pays the Bakht'ari Khans for certain graz’ng r'ghts which might be assumed to pertain to lands falling within their jurisdiction. On the north, the boundary follows the general trend of the mountain ranges, whilst lying sufficiently to the south to exclude Khomrai, Khonsar and Gulpaigan. Further to the south-east it excludes the district of Faraidan, and traverses the Zindeh Rud between Ckadigun and Bard-i-Shlr so as to exclude the latter, and passing onwards to include Binn and Samun. The next fixed point is the Gardan-i-Rukh and the pass north of Kavarukh, where the Bakhtiari boundary marches with that of the Isfahan District. Continuing in roughly the same direction, 12 lb. A“ 2 Paradumba andUrujan are under Isfahan for revenue purposes, and the Tang-i-Halwai between Isfahan and Ganduman is pointed out as lying on the common boundary. From here the boundary turns south, in the first part forming a Bakhtiari-Qashgal, and further on a Bakhtiari-Kuhgalu frontier. Lack of knowledge and the deficiencies of the maps make it impossible to trace the exact course of this eastern boundary ; to. the south-east of Deh Diz, however, it appears to correspond with the Karun. Again the Kuhgalu have extensive rights of occupation in the Kuh-i-Mangasht, which are recognised by the Bakhtiari, and in practice their rights to the whole of the east and south slopes are but weakly disputed. The remaining part of the western boundary (south of the Karun) has been dealt with in Part I of this report. It remains to be remarked that the standard of effectiveness of the Bakhtiari rule is by no means uniform over the whole area delimited above, and that in the west their power must be shadowy, if not non-existent. It may also be mentioned that whilst in a few tracts the land is regarded as the property of the Bakhtiari Government in most cases it is the actual property of individual Khans. Moreover in the north, in tracts which were formerly adminis tered from Isfahan, many of the villages are owned by the inhabi tants who are themselves not of Bakhtiari origin. A case in point is Deh Kurd. This is not so in the case of the villages of the Bamuz District, which in other respects presents a general analogy, though there are Arab camps in the district, and a mixed population of Arabs and Lurs, including Bahmai, in the town. Whilst instances may thus be found here and there where the Khans enjoy jurisdiction without ownership, the converse is much more common. The prosperity which has marked their affairs during the last generation has enabled them to acquire a large amount of property in adjoining provinces. Thus Ghulam Husain Khan has acquired the whole of the rich 'Aqlll District (north of Shushtar) the profits of which he enj oys, whilst being responsible to the Governor of 'Arabistan for the payment of the revenue demand, some 12,000 tumdns. Further to the west Kaunak, and various villages south of Dizful, fall into the same category, and a share of the Bin Muallah lands on the east bank of the Karkheh is held by some of the Khans.The same conditions obtain also in the Isfahan District, where Bistagun and other villages have been acquired by purchase. General Description. The boundaries having been defined as far as possible, we will proceed to some description of the district from a geographical point of view. The Bakhtiari country is a complete section of the Zagros moun tains, and may be said to mark the south-east end of that range's existence as a distinct chain. To the north its boundary is roughly speaking the water parting between the Central Persian river system, and that of the Persian Gulf. To the south the limit of the foot-hills of the Zagros is also the limit of Bakhtiari territory. Two main mountain Kanges may be distinguished— (1) The Outer Range, i.e. nearest to Central Persia. (2) The Inner Range, nearest to the Persian Gulf. The former includes Shuturun, Jehan-bin, and Shahan Kuh. The latter includes Kallar Kuh, Kuh-i-Rang, Zarda Kuh, Isbiana Kuh, and Sabza Kuh. South of the Inner Range, tier after tier of hills succeed each other in a confused mass, retaining, however, their north-west and south-east trend, and gradually decreasing in height as the 'Arabis- tan hills are approached. Two rivers of importance, the Karun and the Diz, force their way through this mighty mass of hills, and their tortuous course is rendered doubly romantic by the precipitous gorges whereby they forge their way through the mountain chains as they rush from valley to valley. The valleys run parallel to the ranges, as a rule, the latter being only occasionally driven through. The Outer Range is thus pierced at Bahrain, at Tang-i-Gazi, making a rift for the Zindeh Rud, and again at Tang-i-Darkash Warkash for the Ab-i-Behisht- abad, a tributary of the Karun. The Inner Range is pierced by the Karun below the Tang-i- Dopulun, and by the east branch of the Diz. The bottoms of these long valleys remain at fairly constant elevations, and carry the main drainage, giving easy gradients for the main tracks which generally follow the banks of the rivers. To the north-west of the Kuh-i-Rang, however, a most peculiar change4 u is seen ; the main drainage, instead of running parallel to the main ranges, now cuts them more frequently, the normal north-ea c .t and south-west drainage and valleys being divided into short reaches. The Karun and Diz rivers, draining as they do those districts of South- West Persia lying beyond the Outer Eange, towards Central Persia, and requiring an outlet to the sea, pierce this part of the mointain range at right angles by several deep channels, which in places form sheer precipices 4,000 to 5,000 feet high. . Though the main roads follow the general direction of the ranges along the high valleys at altitudes of 6,000 to 7,000 feet, these are now cut up into sections at short intervals by deep water-courses and large rivers, rushing through magnificent rifts and gorges thus necessitating descents and ascents of many thousand feet, a disagreeable contrast to the traveller's experiences on the north east side of the Kuh-i-Rang. The Bakhtiari summer quarters, “ sardsir ” or “ yailaq,” con sist of the valleys of the upper Kurang and its tributaries, and the head waters of the Zmdeh Rud. Both these rivers will be described at some length below. Mountain Ranges. The mountain ranges run parallel to each other as a rule. The highlands, however, may be said to be limited to the slopes and valleys forming part of the two main and highest ranges. As such they are nameless : as in most savage countries, mountains, rivers, and valleys are known only by local names, covering frequently but a few miles, and here, especially where tribes live and have lived for years without daring to venture from one valley to another, it is not seldom found that the same high snow-clad range bears one name if viewed from one side, and another if viewed from the other. To describe a country under such conditions, descriptive names must be adopted ; for this reason, as shown above, the “ Outer' and Inner ' ranges have been so called. This distinction is arbitrary, and leaves out of consideration the range of mountain running fairly continuously in a north-east to south-west direction from Urujan to Kaleh Huma, north of Deh Kurd and Wargun. But, though imperfect, this classification is an aid to lucidity in describing the country, and is therefore retained. These two ranges, forming the backbone of the Bakhtiari country, and being its most important feature seen from all sides, deciding the direction of the water-courses and lines of communication, are fairly continuous, and though fre quently cut through at right angles by passable and impassable rifts, can be traced from end to end of the Bakhtiari country. Between these lofty ranges lie the high valleys, in which will be found the summer homes of the Bakhtiari.Reference to the map will show in the centre of theBakhtiari country a remarkable configuration, lying between these two ranges and almost uniting them. This is the Kuk-i-Rang, which also bears the name of Jaihun (i.e., the world’s) and that deservedly, for out of its sides, and 'within a few miles of each other, spring the head-waters of three of Persia’s most important rivers. To the east flows the Zindeh Rud to Isfahan, to the south the Karun, and to the west the Diz. The Kuh-i-Rang, moreover, is a cardinal point in the matter of mountain ranges; it not only, with its several peaks, forms the most elevated group, just under 13,000 , but it also furnishes the head-waters of two perfectly distinct systems of drainage, that of the Central Persian plateau and that of the Gulf. Besides the Kuh-i-Rang, there are one or two other mountains, or ranges, that deserve a word orj^wo of special introduction. The Inner Range. —Of those forming the Inner Range, the Zarda Kuh is covered with snow on the north side until late in the year. Bv the end of July, however, on all these hills the snow lies butm patches, and probably before the new fall arrives it has dwindled away, except in the highest sunless gorges and cracks. The Zarda Kuh is long, narrow, and exceedingly abrupt on both sides (a cre taceous outcrop on a very large scale) and some of its peaks reac 13,000'. Next to it, to the south-east, is the Isbiana range, rather out of dressing, having more of an easterly direction. It is really a large spur, and is 20 miles long, narrow, ragged and bare on both sides. The next section of the inner Range is Kuh-i-Gerrah: this diners from the other two somewhat, having a more rounded crest-line. It has a large double peak (one a cone) in the middle of its length, and is a favourite resort on account of its pasturage. Its altitude may also be just 13,000 . The Inner Range, considered as a chain, ceases south-east of the Chari Pass, breaking up into parallel ranges. West of the Karun these are the Kuh-i-Isblana and Kuh-i-Gurab. East of the Karun lie the Kuh-i-Kallar, and Sabza Kuh (known near Dopulun as Bazgiran). The end of Sabza Kuh, which is also the end of the Inner Range and the south-east limit of the existence of the Zagros Moun tains as a continuous and lofty chain, is marked by a conspicuous peak, just over 13,000' high, known as Sultan; Ibrahim. The Kuh- -i-Kallar is a few hundred feet higher, and of a more rugged and barren character, especially on its southern face. Coal is reported to exist in this mountain, but Major Sawyer, who climbed several peaks in 1889 saw none.* *Major Sawyer also mentions the existence near Arjanak, in the west Bakhtiari country, of coal (bituminous slate) at two points and coal of poor quality also occurs near Ar dal.0 The Outer Range .—To the west of the Kuh-i-Rang, we find in the Outer Range the Kuh-i-Shahan, a magnificent range with an almost perpendicular drop of 3,000 feet to the north. It is traditionally a resort of the ibex, and its crest, close to its summit of 12,800', is reached by a made bridle-path, along which the most nervous and lazy of royal sportsmen could ride without risk. The next range of note is the Kallar Kuh, conspicuous by its erect and rugged peaks, the highest of them (visited by Major Sawyer) being 13,000'. It is a main tap for many mountain springs, and on its spurs are favourite camping-grounds. The next range is the Shu- turun Kuh, which, like other mountains in the Bakhtiari country, is particularly rugged on its south side. The last mountain requir ing special mention is Parvlz, at the extreme north-west end of the Outer Range. It has a large fairly level summit, with snow-springs till July, and is about 11,000' high. It is conspicuous from the north ern lowlands of Burujird and Silakhur, for it stands out as the end of the Outer Range, having a perpendicular scarp, from its summit to the Bahrain gap, of 5,000'. The general features of the slopes of the Outer and Inner Ranges on the northern side differ from those on the southern side in a marked degree. In general terms it may be said that the crest of the Outer Range from near Lake Irene to Lake Chighakhur forms a definite line of demarcation. The outer slopes of this Range, with the countries at its foot towards Central Persia, have the ordinary treeless, grassless, waterless, soft-moulded but corrugated charac teristics of normal Persia. From this crest, which is also the water- parting, to the south slopes of the Inner Range, the country wears a pleasanter aspect. It has a ruggedness and a grandeur of its own, water and pasture in abundance, and many of the hills are clad with a stunted forest growth of dwarf oak, ilex, ash and walnut, the first-named tree greatly predominating. Certain hills, however, notably the Kuh-i-Kallar, are devoid of forest growth, probably because the geological formation is unfavourable to them. The belut (dwarf oak) in particular seems to thrive on lime .tone, and on limestone only. The Kuranq (Kururi) river .—As already noticed, from out of the Kuh-i-Rang and its vicinity flows an abundance of water. Present local nomenclature to the contrary, this mountain holds the sources of the Karim. Though this stream is known locally as the Kurang (short for Kuh-i-Rang) a spring jutting out of the side of Zarda Kuh some 10 miles down the valley, which constitutes the main, if not the ultimate, source, is called the Sar-i-Chashmeh-i-Kurang. There are many such fountain springs in the Bakhtiari country. A continuous flow of water, with sections reaching 150 square feet, is frequently met with. Occasionally such springs are intermittent,7 with rest periods varying from two hours to two days. The southern side of Kuh-i-Parviz contains one such, high up the perpendicular side, 3,000' above the valley. Owing to such springs, e.g., the Marburra, 20 miles below Sar-i-Chashmeh, the Karun even in its upper course becomes almost at once a formidable river, from 50 to 100 yards wide and fordable only from June to December and then only in its upper reaches. It is said to be fordable, though rarely, at Bars, and Captain Lorimer mentions having forded it without difficulty in June 1908, some 14 miles below Sar-i-Chashmeh, and with difficulty at Birgun lower down. Its banks are deep and steep, and in places for long reaches it flows between almost perpendicular banks of 1,000'to 3,000' high. Its waters are therefore useless for irrigation, but many of its tributaries are fully made use of in this respect. The velocity of its ceaseless flow, however, makes its potential water-power very great. The course of the Kurang is a peculiar one dictated by the mountain formation. From its source it flows due south-east for 100 miles; then, with a sharp bend, it flows south-west through the Inner Range, and several lesser ranges parallel to it for 50 miles. It then bends north-west at Bars, and continues for 50 miles in this direction, whence it runs through deep gorges, 30 miles or so to Gudar-i-Landar, and thence north-west to Ziwaru, after which it runs south-west, and then south past Gotwand to Shushtar. The Kurang has, in the Bakhtiari country, three important tri butaries running parallel to the parent stream and no more than 20 miles from it. On the southern slope of the Inner Range flows the Ab-i-Bazuft in a perfectly straight course for 100 miles. It is, like the Upper Kurang, a magnificent stream with a kind of green-blue water, due to the chalk it contains, flowing ever full in deep-set banks through a long well-wooded valley. It is fed by many springs of fresh and also of salt water, the latter sometimes so salt that all the neighbouring trees and vegetation, though green, are encrusted with a saline deposit. In the centre of its course lies Kaleh Bazuft, a ruined square serai fort, reputed to be ancient. The present structure was built by Husain Qull when Ilkhani. The next tributary of importance is what may be called the Ab- i-Chighakhur, as peculiar for its winding course as the Ab-i-Bazuft is for its straightness. This stream may be said to be the approxi mate south-eastern boundary of the Bakhtiari country, though both Ganduman and Lurdagan, 4 miles and 20 miles, respectively from its northern bank, must be included. Between Kuh-i-Kallar and Sabza Kuh, whose northern slopes are washed by the Ab-i- Chighakhur, is a straight, small, but important tributary, watering a valley which is thickly populated in summer.—I—' 1 '' ' ' 8 The next tributary of importance is that flowing through the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash, 4 miles above Ardal: its components drain an area of 2,500 square miles, and are the mainstay and cause of the fertility of the Chehar Mahal. At the northern exit of the short valley which the Darkash Warkash stream has carved out across the main valley of Kaj,is a village known as Behishtabad, on account of its sheltered position and fertility. Of the smaller tributaries, two deserve special notice ; one joins the Kurang just above Dopulun in the middle of the Tang-i- Ardal, a long winding gorge 1,000' to 2,000' deep by which the main stream has cut a way for itself through the Inner Bange. It is called the Dinaran, or the Ab-i-Gurab, as it rises in a beautiful valley of the latter name at an elevation of 7,000'. This stream flows first as a sluggish English meadow brook through a valley, which, in early spring, is one bed of flowers and grass ; and leaving it through a small Tang, flows at the foot of the lofty Kuh-i-Gerrah in a deep impassable ravine, copiously increased by many springs and torrents. There are indications that, many centuries ago, the mountain-locked and well-watered valley of the Ab-i-Gurab must have been as favourite a haunt for savage man as it is to-day. On the other side of Kuh-i-Isbiana the Ab-i-Charl, the outflow of many rock-springs, runs its brief course into the Kurang north-west of Ardal, through a wooded valley, almost every flat square yard of which shows signs of ancient cultivation. Along its right bank is one of the most ancient high-roads of the world. The Zindeh Rud .—The head-waters of the Zindeh Hud are con tained between the Outer and Inner Ranges on the south-east slopes of the Kuh-i-Rang. Not only from this mountain, but also from several minor valleys, such as the Zarin, Dimeh and Qurban, large gushing streams contribute their generous quota to the river, which rushes through the Tang-i-Gazi into the plains of Faraidan and Isfahan. The waters are all sweet, but the head-water basin is called “ Surah,” for in its very centre is a large salt spring, yielding, by evaporation, a plentiful supply of salt which is collected and sold. The Kdrhunun works .—Separating the bed of the Kurang from the Surab Valley, is a long low spur of the Kuh-i-Rang, known as the Karkunun. Shah Tahmasp in the 16th century appears to have initiated the work of cutting this spur in order to divert the head waters of the Kurang into the Zindeh Rud. He began to tunnel but was repelled by noxious vapours. There is, however, no trace of a tunnel now. ’Abbas the Great, abandoning the tunnel scheme.commenced the cutting, on which he is said to have employed from 40,000 to 100,000 men. His successor 'Abbas II, tried the simul taneous experiment of damming the river so as to raise its level, and of mining the rock, under the direction of a French Engineer. Both schemes were failures, and the cutting remains unfinished. The idea was an ambitious one : the waters of the Karun at Shushtar would not be appreciably diminished thereby, but it is probable that the Zindeh Hud at Isfahan would not be materially increased, owing to evaporation and the numerous minor demands en route, and the cost of labour, at all events in these days, would be prohibitive ; tunnel ling would be practicable under European direction, and no doubt cheaper. The Diz River. —To the north-west of the Kuh-i-Rang, as already noticed,. the water system is at right angles to that in the Bakhtiari country. The Ab-i-Diz consists of two main streams, one flowing from near Burujird, and draining Silakhur, and called in this report the Ab-i-Burujird, for want of any generally re cognized name; the other called, for the same reason, the Ab-i- BaznawT, taking its rise in the upper portion of Faraidan. The Ab-i-Burujird passes through the Outer Range by the mag nificent gorge named after the ruined fort of Bahrain, which commands its mouth. The Ab-i-Baznawi, with its two main tributaries, the Guvah and the Gaukun, also bursts by deep and tortuous rifts 'through the Cuter Range. Lakes. —A notable feature of the Bakhtiari country is the pretty lakes it contains. At its south-east end are two lakes close together at an altitude of 8,000': the Siligun, really a double lake, divided in the middle by a low mound, 30 feet above the water, is to the west, and the Chighakhur Lake, 10 miles to the east. Their overflows drain in exactly opposite directions, eventually finding their way into the Karun. To the north-west at the inner foot of Shuturun Kuh is Lake Irene, so named after the daughter of the discoverer, Major H. A. Sawyer. It is 2J miles long and about 1 mile wide, and very deep, lying in an almost deserted valley. A small salt lake is found on the southern slope of the Zarda Kuh not far from the Chari Pass. Geology. —The mountain ranges of the Bakhtiari country are for the most part of cretaceous limestone, with granite and igneous outcrops here and there. In several places evidences of recent volcanic action are visible. The valley in the centre of which lies Lake Irene, below Shuturun Kuh, was found deserted by Major Sawyer in 1889 on account of frequent earthquakes, the effects of 121.B. Bwhich are seen in the masses of huge rock sprinkling the low spurs. Touching the north-west end of the lake is a small volcano, which appears to have become extinct only recently. An earthquake which is said to have killed 6,000 people occurred in the Silakhur Valley to the west of the Bakhtiari country on January 3rd, 1909, but was not felt south of the Karun, nor does it appear to have done any damage in the Bakhtiari country, although the shocks were duly recorded in Bombay, Berlin and elsewhere. Reference is invited to the works of Loftus and De Morgan for information on the geology of the country. Sawyer reports that the cliffs, partly conglomerate, partly cre taceous, on the Ab-i-Bahrain, between Shah Badar.and Khanabad, exude pure pitch; and in the back-water below the rift there was some appearance of an oil spring about two feet below the surface. He also reports bituminous shale, which could be burnt as coal, in two places near Arjanak. There is also said to be coal in the Kuh-i-Kallar, but Major Sawyer found none.CHAPTER II. General. Bakhtidri Levies .—The proposal to raise levies among the Bakhtiari, under the guise of road guards, or otherwise, to be train ed by British officers under arrangements with the Khans, at the expense of the Indian Government, has been frequently mooted, and is mentioned with approval in Cuizon's “ Persia and the Persian Question/' Major Sawyer in his report also mentions it with qualified approval. It appears that it was thought possible that such troops would be valuable auxiliaries in their own country in conjunction with British troops operating against a Russian force. Even this is questionable, and, outside their own country, they would prob ably be of little use. Experience shows that Major Sawyer's hopes have not been fulfilled. Further acquaintance with Europeans bas not improved the manners of the Bakhtiari. He is a past master in the art of boasting: his wild looks, his tales of valour, his reck less rifle practice, his ostentatiously fierce demeanour when no danger is expected, all mark the swashbuckler, and conceal an intelligent appreciation of the probabilities and risks involved by a recourse to arms, and a determination to save his own skin, even at the expense of his personal or tribal honour. The Bakhtiari in time of danger, as the present writer has observed, is a very difierent man from the Bakhtiari when danger has passed. Tribal fights are not as a rule sanguinary, and even when the Khans,rafter exhausting all the arts of bluff and cajolery, are at last compelled to undertake operations against their more warlike neighbours, such as the Kuhgalu, or Dirakwand, they find it difficult to assemble more than 2,000 or 3,000 men, though ten times that number are invariably reported, and by many believed, to have been present. Anything of the nature of a pitched battle is of the rarest occurrence,' and the toll of killed and wounded is small indeed, and generally includes women and children killed by indiscriminate night-firing into camps. The Bakhtiari shows all the unwillingness to come to close quarters, and to fight without a line of retreat safely open to him, which is typical of most Asiatics, and particularly of Arabs, He is devoid of the spirit of self-sacrifice, and tribal sentiment does not seem to be strong, though much talked of: generally ( 11 )12 speaking, he will serve the highest bidder, and his first care is for his own personal welfare and safety. It is not likely that he would greatly improve under European leadership : he is impatient of control even of the mildest kind, and easily tired, physically and mentally, by continuous labour, though capable of great endurance for short periods, with long intervals of rest. Familiarity with Europeans has not increased his respect for them, but has rather taught him that he can misbehave to them with comparative impunity, and extort high rates of remunera tion for trifling services. Avarice, the ruling power of his life, grows more and more rapacious as fast as it is satisfied. Ten tumdns per mensem, with free clothing and equipment, would be the mini mum figure possible for the pay of a private soldier in a levy under European supervision. Unless under strict control, road guards of this type would be more formidable to wayfarers than to rob bers. The officers appointed to organize such a force would have an impossible task, and the result would be prejudicial rather than beneficial to European interests. “European” advisedly, for amongst the common people, whatever respect is paid by the Khans to the British is also paid to “ Farangis ” as a whole. The Khans themselves have no doubt a sufficiently keen percep tion of the difference between the various European nationalities though their only relations of a political nature are with Great Britain. A fair sample of the military value of theBakhtiarl is afforded by their march on Tehran in 1909. After months of procrastina tion, during which the Khans were powerless to prevent tbeif men from indulging in wholesale robbery all round Isfahan, the Sardar Asad contrived to beg and borrow enough money to enable him to advance. This money, which was largely loaned by the Shaikh of Muhammareh upon the security of lands in the Ramuz district, was required to pay the men, who refused to march unless they received pay. A force of about 1,700 men reached Kum under the leadership of Sardar Asad, but would have advanced no further had not the Sipahdar and his Caucasian levies forced his hands, and done all the serious fighting. It is typical of the Bakhtiari that, once in Tehran, they took to themselves all the credit of the Revolutionaries’ victory, and spared no pains to impress this view upon European press corres pondents and others in Tehran. Bridge construction .—The question of the construction of bridges at one or more points across the Karun by the Khans with » —the assistance of an European Engineer, to be lent by the Indian Government on payment, was mooted in 1907 (having been discussed several times previously), but never took definite shape. Of many sites examined by Lieutenant Wilson in 1908 those at Pa-i-Pul-i- Landar, Bard-i-Qamchi and Susan were considered most suitable. All three are favourable to bridge construction, and three-fifths of the biennial migration traffic across the river probably use the ferries at these points, as the roads to and from them are in a special degree convenient for the Iliat.CHAPTER III. - Tribal. f History .—Speculations upon the origin and the history of the Bakhtiari cannot properly find a place in a Military Report. “Who the Lurs are, whence they came, is one of the unsolved and insoluble riddles of history” (Curzon). They have been called Turks, Persians, Semites, and even Kurds, but the balance of prob ability supported by linguistic characteristics inclines towards their being of the aboriginal stock of Persia : they are thus Aryans by descent. It is fairly certain, moreover, that they have lived for many centuries, as they do now, in the hill and plains alternatively. ‘Lur’ is a term of contempt among Persians, and even amongst Bakhtiari: it is held to be synonymous with a boor, and a robber, and doubtless it has always been so. “ From the earliest days we read of this mountain country as a wild and inaccessible region, inhabited by uncouth and formidable tribes. They set at nought the authority of the Medes and Persians : they defied Alexander, and provoked Antiochus. The invading Arabs found them a hard nut to crack. Between the 12th and 15th centuries, how ever (1155 to 1424 A.D.), we find a powerful Mussulman dynasty known as the Fasluryah, ruling the Bakhtiari country from Isfahan to Shushtar under the title of Atabeg. Their stronghold was the mountain fastness of Mangasht, and their winter quarters were at Idej near Malamir (Curzon). “ When the Afghans appeared outside Isfahan in 1722, the Qasim Khan Bakhtiari placed 12,000 horsemen in the field, but he was easily defeated by the invaders. Soon after, the Turkish pasha of Musal thought to take advantage of the general disorder by invading the Bakhtiari country. This he successfully accom plished, but he was not more able to hold it than any previous invader, and presently beat a retreat. ‘ ‘ Nadir Khan made the same experiment, and conquered, but did not subdue. He also tried, but without success, to transport large numbers of the tribe to Khorasan. They fought their way back again. More wisely he enlisted large numbers of Bakhtiari in his army, who acquitted themselves with great bravery at Herat and Kandahar. Upon his death in 1749, we are confronted with the short lived spectacle of a Bakhtiari chieftain (Rashid Khan) as ( is )16 the virtual occupant of the throne of Persia. The inevitable conflict resulted in the assassination of the aged Bakhtiari chief tain in 1751. “Agha Muhammad Khan in 1785 essayed a campaign against these formidable mountaineers. He was not more successful than Nadir had been; and during the rest of his reign left the Bakh tiari wisely alone.” “In the early years of the nineteenth century As'ad Khan, of the Haft Lang, defied the Persian Government: raided up to the walls of Tehran, and when pursued took refuge in his impregnable hill fort (Diz) near Shushtar. Ultimately, however, he surrendered to Muhammad ’All Mirza, son of Path ’All Shah and made his peace with the Government. 44 A little later, when British officers appeared in Persia to drill the native troops, a force of 3,000 Bakhtiari was raised and placed under Major Hart, who found them orderly and tractable in their relations with him, though insubordinate and contemptuous towards Persian officers. “Between the years 1830-40, one Muhammad Taqi Khan, of the Kunursi tribe of the Chehar Lang, and a lineal descendant of Rashid (before mentioned) rose to a commanding position among the Bakhtiari peoples. Starting as chief of his own clan he was presently recognized as head of the Janiki (lit. Jawaniki) Garmsir, a larger tribal unit, which as a rule carried with it the su premacy of the entire Chehar Lang. At his prime his sway was likewise acknowledged by many of the Haft Lang, and by some of the Faill and Kuhgalu Lurs. This was the powerful chief tain whom Muhammad ’All Shah determined to subdue. “ Muhammad Taqi Khamsternly repressed brigandage, encour aged settled as against nomadic existence, attempted colonization on a large scale, fostered trade, and was keenly in sympathy with Layard’s proposals for opening up the Bakhtiari mountains to British commerce. “ Muhammad Taqi Khan ruled well. His influence extended from Dizful to Behbehan : he once took Hawizeh and replaced the K’ab Shaikh in Fallahieh. A Persian army, however, in which Rawlinson was an officer, marched against him in 1836, and re ceived his submission. Again in 1840, the Shah, jealous of his power and wealth, sent an army against him under M’utamad-ud- Dauleh, who in the Government of Isfahan had acquired a reputa tion for merciless severity. The family of Muhammad Taqi wereseized by an act of ill-faith; he himself took refuge with the K’ab Shaikh Thamar, but was persuaded to surrender to the M'utamad upon a guarantee of safety sworn upon the Quran. He was seized, cast into chains, and carried off to Tehran, where he died in impri sonment in 1851. His brothers and sons were either killed or experienced a similar fate. With the removal of Muhammad Taqi the fortunes of the Chehar Lang suffered eclipse, and have never since revived. After the fall of the Chehar Lang chieftain, the Haft Lang regained their supremacy, which has never since been disputed. J’afar Qull Khan, son of As’ad Khan (above mentioned) was recognized as Ilkhani by the M’utamad. To attain the position, he had already slain 14 of his relatives, including his own brother. Like his father, when engaged in hostilities with the Persian Government, a position into which he soon drifted, he withdrew to his impregnable stronghold or ‘ Diz ’ where he was unsuccessfully besieged. Later he took to flight, and was succeeded bv Qalb Ail Khan of the Duraki tribe, who also possessed a famous ‘Diz’ . About 1850, however, Husain Quli, son of J’afar, began to _ assert his authority over the tribes. He slew Qalb ’All a-nd rapidly gamed a predominance which for thirty years remained uncontested. Like Muhammad Taqi, he suppressed brigandage, made the caravan tracks safe, built caravanserais, constructed roads, and was will ing to enter into relations with British merchants for the opening up of the route between Isfahan and Shushtar. Individual pre-eminence, however, has never been very safe m Persia ; and least of all under a centralizing administration like that of the present monarch.^ “ In Jnup. 1882. Husain Qull Khan, who had not long pre- taneously, Isfandiar Khan, eldest son of the mumerea man, wa B thrown into prison, where he remained for 6^ years. The entire series of events was profoundly characteristic of Persian policy in its attitude towards the nomad tribes.j* • Nasr-ud-Dln. t Thus Curzon : Sawyer’s account is somewhat different party to it williievor be known, but C18 'After the assassination of Husain QulT, his next brother, Imam Qull, was appointed IlkhanT, and a third brother, Biza Quli, became Ilbegl; other members of the family were kept at Tehran as hostages. With the fall of the Zill, however, in February 1888, Isfandiar Khan was released from confinement and appointed Ilbegi. Imam Quli was deposed, and Biza Quh appointed in his place. Imam Quli refused to vacate his position, and so Isfandiar and Biza Quli, with the aid of Persian troops, marched against him, fell upon his following at Chighakhur and compelled him to fly. Isfandiar was given the title of Samsam-us-Saltaneh. “In 1890 Imam Quli was reinstated as Ilkhani, with Isfandiar as Ilbegl, and Biza Quli as Governor of CLehar Mahal ” (abbr viated from Curzon’s ' Persia,” II, 285 et seq.). Biza Quli died in 1905. Imam Quli remained Ilkhani till his death in 1896, and was succeed ed by Isfandiar Khan, who had been Ilbegl from 1890—1896, and who retained the Ilkh^aniship until his death in 1903, when he was succeeded by Muhammad Husain Khan, Sipahdar, as Ilkhani, with Najaf Quli as Ilbegl: and this arrangement continued until December 1905 when it was broken by the death of the Sipahdar: a short inter-regnum followed ; 'AH Quli, Sardar As’ad, being made Ilkhanl, and Haji Khusrau, Sardar-uz-Zafar, Ilbegl. Both, how ever, were deposed after six months had elapsed. Najaf Quli became Ilkhani, and Ghulam Husain, Ilbegl. The latter was deposed for three months in 1907 in favour of Naslr Khan, but soon rejoined his position. Najaf Quli retained his supremacy throughout, thanks to a dash of boldness in his character, which gives him, in spite of his lack of perception and diplomatic skill, an advantage over his confreres. In the autumn of 19 &gt;8 an attempt was made by the Shah to depose him, and replace him by Haji Khusrau, the latter having actively supported the Boyalist cause in Tabriz and Tehran. The attempt failed signally. The deposed Ilk: anl, Najaf Quh, refused to obey, and espoused the Nationalist cause, marching rapidly upon, Isfahan, seizing the arsenal, and turning out the information laid before the Shah by the M’utamad-ud-Dauleh is known to have been directed against the Zill as well as against the Ilkhani. It was represented that the e two were conspiring to overthrow the supreme Government. The Zill’s recent visit to the Bakhtiari hills lent colour to it. What passed between the Zill an 1 his royal father will also remain in obscurity. Husain Quli was invited by the Zill to Isfahan, and the latter took his oath on the Quran that he w T ould guarantee his safe retarn to his mountains. On reaching the palace, in open ‘durbar,’ the Zill at once entered on the subject of the dispute'. The Ilkhani remonstrated. The Zjll ordered them to bind the Ilkhani, who, enraged at the breach of faith, abused the Zill and his father, the Shah. The matter telegraphed to Tehran brought back the short but ominous reply ‘ either you or the Ilkhani.* Within four hours of his having been treacherously sejied, the old chief was led out and had his throat cut.”the Governor and his troops. These took refuge in the British Legation for a time, and the Governor eventually got a safe-conduct from Najaf Qull and left for Tehran. Thus the Bakhtiari have cleverly contrived to divide their forces, some siding with the Nationalists, some with the Royalists : whichever side wins, influential Bakhtiari chiefs will be found 0)1 that side, which is probably under the circumstances the best safeguard of the political independence of the Bakhtiari tribes. The Bakhtiari having nothing to gain from either side, and standing only to lose by the establishment of a powerful central Govern ment, are not likely to give continued support to any party in the State. Tribal Organization. The population directly controlled by the Bakhtiari Khans consists entirely of Bakhtiari Lurs, with a few Saiyids and Armenians. They may be divided into three classes, viz., Haft Lang, Chehar Lang and the dependents of the first two named tribes : to these perhaps should be added the population of the Ramuz district, which is part of 'Arabistan, but governed by the Khans and inhabited by Lurs of all kinds. Except for the brief inter regnum of Muhammad TaqT, the predominance has always been with the Haft Lang, whose chiefs, descended from J’r.far Quli, monopolize the chief appointments. Two of J'afar Quli’s sons, Husain Qull and Imam Quli, founded rival families, and the appointments of IlkhanI and Ilbegi are divided between them, each of the two families securing one of the appointments. The Chehar Lang, broadly speaking, have formed two clans—one inhabiting the hills near Silakhur in summer and near Dizful in winter, and known as Mahmud Salih, or Kheraja; the other clan including all the Chehar Lang in various villages and plains south of the Karim : the latter are non-migratory, and their principal • chief is Khuda Karam Khan, of Kaleh Tul. Politically, however, they are of little importance, being wholly in the power of the Haft Lang Khans. The latter, though retaining an outward show of unity, are secretly, often openly, divided, and advantage is taken by the Persian Government of this apparently incurable tendency to keep the Bakhtiari divided into rival factions. The Khans them selves are a numerous body, and are steadily increasing in number : all the male members of the principal Khans’ families demand the wherewithal to keep up retainers and an establishment befitting their rank, and this constitutes a heavy drain on the resources of the country, as such demands, unless partially satisfie 1 by grant of revenues from villages, etc., would lead to open discord and com' plications, which none of the Khans feel strong enough to fa 3 e.20 a Again, some of the Khans have taken to passing long periods in Europe, spending a good deal of money : others waste their sub stance in Tehran : almost all (Najaf QuT being a notable exception) are extravagant in their purchases of European articles. This general tendency to live above their means is typical of Persians, and it is not surprising that the Khans, notwithstanding their prosperity, are in debt for large sums. As a direct consequence of this, their demands upon their subjects increase year by year, and give rise to much concealed dissatisfaction. The taxes, which will be described in detail later, are collected by “ mamurs,” servants of the Khans, specially empowered for the purpose. In the case of the Haft Lang, headmen of sub divisions of tribes appear to be responsible that the proper amount be handed over in due course to the “ mamur” : headmen of vil lages are similarly responsible. In the case of the Chehar Lang south of the Karun, certain minor Chehar Lang Khans, such as Khuda Karam Khan of Kaleh Tul, and Muhammad Husain Khan of Munganun, are made responsible for the revenue demand to the Hkhani and Ilbegi, in addition to which they collect for themselves, and “ mamurs” collect for their respective masters, the rights due to certain Khans (such as Naslr Khan at Mamatain) as owners • of the land. The position of headman of a village, or a tribe, or section is an appointment made by the Khans, but in practice it is hereditary, the family of the holder sharing the benefits and responsibilities. If, however, a weak man succeeds to the office, he is soon ousted on one pretext or another by rivals to the post. Divisions and Numbers. Much has been written on this question, but it cannot be said that any final agreement has been, or is likely to be, reached. In the first place, no two Bakhtiari authorises agree on the proper division and sub-division of the principal tribe, nor even upon tribes which should be considered as having independent existence. In the second place, there is no doubt that tribal divisions are in a constant state of flux ; under strong leadership a sub-section becomes a section, and may gather other sections to it, which, merging their identity, constitute after a few years a tribe with an independent existence. In such a case, some Bakh tiari will, and others will not, include it in the list of clans which constitute the tribe of which it was originally a section. Further, it seems clear that tribal divisions are losing some of their old im portance. Tribal enmity is less bitter ; feuds, if not unknown, are not prosecuted with the savage ferocity that travellers in the firs part of the last century have a scribed. The Dinaruni, the Raki,and tbe Chehar Lang-i-Mahmfid Salih, notably, have retained to a greater extent than others, tribal feeling and characteristics, and the last named, more than any other tribe, are independent of the Khans. The sharp line between the Chehar Lang and the Haft Lang no longer exists; they live side by side and quarrels between them seem rare, or less common at all events, than discussions between rival tribes of the Haft Lang. Appendices II and III show the divisions of the Haft and Chehar Lang respectively, as far as it has been possible to ascertain them. Haft Lang. A scrutiny of Appendix II, which consists in the main (except D-naruni and Janiki) of new information collected in 1908 by Captain Lorimer, will show that considerable changes have occurred since Curzon compiled his lists. Tribes have become sections^ and vice vevsd. The list is incomplete, but the total of 30,000 fam ilies is probably not far wrong, and corresponds closely with previous estimates, allowing for a small increase. The Dlnarunl are perhaps the most powerful, and their support is bidden for by the Khans, who tax them more lightly than others. They seem more homogeneous than other tribes, perhaps because both in the hills and the low-country they are not widely distributed. They have a bad reputation amongst th* * tribes for quarrelling and robbery. (b) The RakI likewise have a deservedly bad reputation, and the Khans are said to deal with them with circumspection: they are also richer than most other tribes: some authorities ^ would put them in a separate category as a distinct tribe: but if they deserve this consideration, it is of recent origin. No attempt has been made to total up more than the families. Roughly speak ing, however, the Haft Lang possess 39,000 families, furnishing 25,000 fighting men, of whom 15,000 are armed, 5,000 owning br-echloaders. *(a) The Babadi are said to be by origin a tribe of Arabs from Basrah, known as Arzaka, who were expelled, and fled to Ahwaz,, remaining there for two years. They revolted, and a certain Mihlab-i-Ab-i-Sufra was sent to punish them : they fled to Andakeh, but again took to plundering, and were at last dispersed, some flying to the Fail! country, others to Surab, Zarda Kuh, and Kuh- i-Kafar. • See overleaf. -M22 Chefidr Lang .—It will be seen from Appendix III that the Chehar Lang are sharply divided, by the Karim, into two roughly equal parts of 3,000 families each, the first part moving between Ab-bid and Zarda Kfih, the second part non-migratory and occupy ing villages scattered over the low-country or Garmsir. In addi tion we must add the Gunduzlu, 650 families, who live near Batwand, and are also migratory. The Suhunni who live near Burujird and pay revenue to the Governor of Burujird, may, for all practical purposes, be excluded. Thus we have, for the Chehac Lang, totals of 7,000 families, and about 6 500 fighting men, with 2,750 rifles, of which probably 2,000 are breechloading. The Mahmud Salih have all the characteristics of the Haft Lang, but the sedentary tribes of the Garmsir are, as might be expected, smaller in stature, and less healthy than the migratory tribes. They are also more peaceable, less savage but not less grasping. Shy lock would meet his master any day in Jaru. Footnote to Babddx (see pre-page.)

This gives a total populat : on of about 250,000, whilst for revenue, but not administrative, purposes the Khans probably con trol in 'Aqili, etc., another 50.000. Manners and Customs. Much might be written under this head, but little that is of more than academical interest. The Bakhtiari is a Shl’ah, and a very ignorant one, but being imitative, like other Persi ns, he has, during the last few years, rapidly acquired the superficial appearance of a devout believer. Prayer-saying is common now amongst the Bakhtiari, and religious superstitions are, if any thing, on the increase. They are excitable, and imagined personal wrongs, magnified and brooded upon, bring them occasionally to a pitch of excitement verging on hysteria. Avarice is their most prominent vice, and is the key to their character. Influenced by their greed for money, they will willingly transfer their services from one faction to another, and serve the hated ‘Farangi,’ though despising themselves for doing so, whilst the plea that they get good wages is a sufficient answer to any Lur who makes it a subject of reproach. A tendency towards disunion, as against union, ‘ nifaq * as against ‘ittifaq,’ is the natural result of their intense individualism, and their l ick of anything approaching the western notion of loy alty and patriotism. The Khans are tolerated as a disagreeable necessity, and feared and obeyed in proportion to their strength : their rule, though often arbitrary, is lax, and does not interfere with the personal freedom of the tribesmen, and, in general, their$4 liberty to do what they like, regardless of the Ten Commandments, as lone as they do not get the Khans into trouble with the Persian Government Ind, oneway add, the British Government Though the Bakhtiari occasionally say that they would like the British take the country, there is little doubt that they would hate the reign of law and order that would result. They readily incur debts, and lend money, at high interest, to each other; and this propensity is the cause of many quarrels, as there is no legal means of redress, and a lender relies upon his personal ability to recover the money, if need be, by force or threats. Mullas and Saiyids meet with less respect than in the more settled parts of Persia, but, to judge from Major Sawyer s account, they are more respected now than they were 20 years ago. As regards his family life, the Bakhtiari is perhaps superior to the average Persian, though less so than he was twenty years ago He is polygamous, but does not veil his women : they are chattels, it is true, freely bartered, and hard-worked, but they enjoy a considerable measure of freedom, taking their share m the family life and conversing freely with outsiders. Family affection is conspicuous, and with it the blessings of comparative morality. Syphilis, except in the vicinity of Ramuz, and Shushtor and Dizful, is almost unknown. S-'domy is uncommon, probably unknown, amongst the more unsophisticated tribes. In the matter of treatment of women, as in other things, the Bakhtiari seems to be degenerating to the Persian standard; the Khans have commenced to veil their women, some of whom are Persians, and frequent visits to Paris on the part of some of the Khans, has resulted in a deterioration of their morals, and a lessened respect for Europeans. Ownership op Land, etc. All land in the Bakhtiari country is held in the first in stance from the Ilkhani and the IlbegT of the Bakhtian, in theory at all events, in return for certain payments. These payments, from which Saiyids are exempt, are in cash or in kind, and are reckoned on the number of “ploughs” of land sown, and the number oi head of cattle which pass the tax collectors at certain points in March and April. Salt springs, owned by a tribe, are taxed in cash and kind. ’ Arab Gao Mishi, buffalo owners, pay in cash and kind, in their case giving ‘ ghi ’ to the Khans. When land is boug or sold it must be with the cognizance of the Khans or then agents, as, theoref icallv speaking, all land is considered to belong to the Khans, who alone can buy or sell it. In practice, however the tenant appears to receive payment for “ improvements in the land made by him, and for water-cuts, etc., kept in order.25 interest, quarrels, upon his i threats, )ie settled 'Unt ( they i superior ity years they are hey enjoy lie family iction is morality, d Dizfiil, irnbown, ings, the ird; tk km are ae oi the a lessened i first ifc i, in theory payments, nd, and® thennmhet rtain points are taxedis in cash d , is bought ^ it agents, is, o the the tenan' telanli ® 11 The vastly greater proportion of cultivable land in the Bakh- tiari country is cultivated by, and really belongs to (the rights of the Khans being very shadowy), sections or snb-sections of the various migratory or non-migratory tribes. From this standpoint the tribes are corporations : the land and the produce are not the property of an individual, and seldom even of one family, but of several families, acting on behalf of the whole tribe, paying a proportion in kind to the section and tribal headmen, and through them to the Khans, sometimes through the intermediary of a minor chief. Mills belong to a tribe, or section, but are worked by an indi vidual by tribal arrangement. The individual receives payment in cash or in kind in consideration of his keeping the mill in repair and arranging to work it. But it appears that new millstones would be a charge on the tribe. Animals seem to be owned by individuals, i.e., by families, and not to be subjected to tribal arrangements. But the ’Arab Gao Mishi appear to own their buffaloes (and horses ?) collectively, pay ing revenue collectively. More often they tend the animals on behalf of a richer Pc rsian tribe, to whom the animals belong. In the latter case they agree to give a certain quantity of £ ghi ’ per annum and make what they can out of the contract. Each tribe moves year after year from qishldq to ydildq and back by the same route, as it has done for many years previously. A change of route is a serious matter, involving questions of grazing rights, etc., which from their indeter minateness are a fruitful source of trouble. Grazing rights are not a subject of payment to the Khans unless the tribe concerned pays revenue to other than the Bakhtiari Khans, in which case a small payment is levied. They are the subject of occasional disputes between the Haft Lang and ’Arabs, and Haft Lang and Chehar Lang, but bloodshed seldom occur,;. One or two specific examples of land ownership may be of interest. Mdmdtain owned by Nasir Khan, Salar-i-Jang, but surrounded by Chehar Lang land. Tenants are partly Bahmai, partly Kalakaj Kuhgalu who have emigrated from Dlshmuk in the last 20 years, partly Chehar Lang Bakhtiari. Official revenue to IlkhanT, payable by Salar-i-Jang, about T. 150; owner’s rights about T. 400 in addi tion. Turuk tribes (Haft Lang) have grazing rights in vicinity of old standing, but pay nothing. Bulfans in Kiihgalu (Bahmai) territory : government revenue payable by owners to ’All Naqi Khan, Bahmai: owners are Turuk Haft Lang, who bought it some years ago from the Bahmai: it is cultivated in summer (rice) on their behalf by Bahmai cultivators. 12 i.b. d26 Bahmai Saiyids have ancient grazing and other rights, with which Turuk cannot interfere. Turuk pay horn-tax (on cattle) and certain other taxes to Bakhtiari Khans. Maiddn Minaftun.—Some, land cultivated by (owned by?) Shlni (ShahnI) section of Raki; the rest owned by Haidar Khan, who collects taxes from cultivators and pays taxes to Ilkhani and Ubegl: oil springs owned by Shushtar Saiyids, who pay no rent for them, but probably bought them originally from the Khans. Various tribes have grazing rights over the ground, and in the im mediate vicinity. Taxation. Appendix II (footnote) enumerates the principal forms of taxa tion imposed by the Khans upon the tribesmen. They are— (1) 1 kran per ‘ plough ’ of land. (2) 20 to 25 ‘ mans ’ grain per ‘ plough ’ of land. (3) Horn-tax ‘ Maliat-i-Shakhi ’ consisting of an annual tax of 15 krans for every mare, for every 4 donkeys or cows, and for every 20 sheep, (4) Entertainment charges, or “ sulhsat, being the duty to feed and supply the Khans or their agents when travelling— 1 ‘ man ’ of bread; 1 load wood, 1 ‘ man ’ of barley; 1 load straw, 2 fowls; l ‘ man ’ of ‘ ghi, ’ 10 eggs, for each ‘ plough ’ of land cultivated by the tribe concerned. The headman of the section or tribe is reponsible for the revenue. There is also a tax known as * dar-i-qishlaq ’ of 5 krans per ‘ flock ’ of sheep or goats, but it does not appear to be regularly levied.CHAPTER IV. Communications. General. The geographical position of the Bakhtiari hills, athwart the . shortest route from Tehran and Isfahan to the navigable waters of the Kanin and the Gulf, make the nature of the communica tions across them a matter of great importance. From Ahwaz or Shushtar to Isfahan via the Lynch road is 271 miles, the highest pass being the ^ r o m Ah yaz and Shushtar g arra p Murdah about 8,000', a few miles south of Gopuiun, the next highest being that near Sarkhun, 7,000'. The height of Isfahan itself is about 5,200'. As things stand at present, this is for all practicable purposes the shortest and quickest route from Ahwaz, or from Shushtar, to Isfahan. It is possible, however, that further knowledge of the Kuhgalu country south of the Karun will show a shorter and not more difficult track via Kamuz, Dishmuk, and Lurdagan. The road from Ahwaz to Isfahan via Batwand, Kaleh m T r i — .. ™ - Zaras, and Kaleh Bazuft is about 271 To Isfahan via Chan pass. fY , .. . . •, miles, but more difficult, and involves crossing the Karun by ferry. The road from Shushtar to Isfahan via Kaleh Bazuft and the Chari pass is about 215 miles, the greatest height attained being over the Chari pass (9,500'). This road was kept in good repair during the lifetime of Husain Qull Khan, but is now in a bad condition ai d difficult for caravans. It is still, however, used to some extent by caravans from Shushtar and Dizful to Buiujird and Hamadan, the direct road via Khurramabad being closed owing to disturbances. Three other passes, the Gurab ( 8,650' ), the Gil-i-Shah Other passes through the (11,700 ), and Pambakal (11,400 ), 16 Inner Range. miles east, and 25 miles and 40 miles, respectively, west of the Chari pass lead from the Bazuft valley to the highlands through the Inner Range. The Gurab pass is useful for lateral communcations between Ardal and Kaleh Bazuft rather than for traversing mountains from north to south. The Gil-i-Shah and Pambakal passes are regularly used by nomads, but they are too high and too long blocked by snow ( 27 )to find much favour with muleteers from Dizful or Shushtar. The Outer Ranee is blocked by numerous passes. Commeno- ing from the south-east, the mam ones Passes through Outer Range. are Tang-i-Halwal, 7,500', and Gardan- i-Arzan, 8,800'. Both these passes, which are situated between Unran and Ganduman, and laradumba and Chigha^hur, res- pectively, are easy, being only actual risea of a few hundred, feet and are the natural route between Shushtar and IsiaLan, but’the routes thereto pass through less hospitable country than do those via the Zirrah pass, and they are consequently less used. The Shushtar-Isfahan route traverses the Outer Range via the Kharaji gap, and the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash, or alternatively by the Gardan-i-Zirrah or Sukhteh (8,300 ), 15 miles to the south- east of the latter. The next pass is known as ’All Kuh, 9,500', an easy pass on the direct route to Isfahan from Shushtar via the Chan pass. Next comes the Tang-i-GazI, on the Dimch, Siligun, Chehil Chashmeh route, forming the cnly passage through the Outer Range within reach of the Gil-i-Shah or Pambakal passes. The Tang-i-Gazi has an excellent level track on the left bank about 100 above the Zindeh Rud, until it enters the broad track of Faraidan a,t Chehil Chashmeh. Last of all is the Gaukun group, leading to Askandana and Chadigun from the valleys north-west of the Kuh-i-Rang. Two other passes of importance, affording easy communica tion between the upper Bakhtiari coun- Lateral communications. an d the watershed of the Diz are the Gal-i-Bard-i-Jamal (10,500') and the Gal-i-Gao, north and south respectively of the Kuh-i-Rang. Both are easy of ascent from the east, but somewhat steeper from the west. To the north-west of the Kuh-i-Rang, every valley, not a gorge, has at least one track for man and beast, but owing to the more broken nature of the country, and the more violent manner in which the ranges have been cleft asunder by the peculiar transverse water system, these tracks compare unfavourably with those of the Bakhtiari country south-east of the Kuh-i-Rang. The remains of what must once have been a main road are to be found more or less along the The Diz basin. course of the Eaznawl branch of the Diz river; and at Baznawi itself are to be seen the remains of tie piers and portions of a masonry bridge of 60' span.

From Baznawi access is obtained to the Silakhur-Burujird valley via the Barbarud district through Fro™ Dizful-Burujird. g a p i ocai iiy known as MakhadI, where by the head-waters of the Diz break through the Outer Range. Ancient bridges and the remains of carefully paved roads in dicate that traffic once passed regularly between Dizful and the highlands of Central Persia along the banks of the Diz via Pul-i-Kul, Baznawi, and Makhadl. Details as far as may be of the various roads across the Bakh- Condition Of tracks. tia p mountains are given in Chapter YII: all that is necessary at this point is to touch upon some of the salient points connected with the traffic thereon. The strategical and military aspects are dealt with in Chapter VI. The sole serious obstacle to all the year round traffic on the Lynch road, and on the other roads also, is the snowfall in winter : information on which to base figures is not available, but it may be said that the maximum period during which the passes are impassable is about one month for every 1,000' in height over 7,000'. In favourable years, however, the Ahwaz-Isfahan route, which attains a maximum height of over 8,000', is never actually closed during the winter, though its difficulties may be tempor arily increased by the snow. All the tracks across the hills, referred to above, are alike in bad repair, and not passable for mule caravans without some difficulty at the best of times. The Bakhtiari road was at one time carefully made ; it has since been allowed to fall into disrepair, but the track that a Persian mule finds impassable must be bad indeed, and few accidents seem to occur on this road, though it is regularly used by large numbers of mules, bound for Ahwaz and Shushtar, or for Isfahan. With the exception of the four stages from Baba Ahmad to Hazar Cham, the Shushtar-Isfahan track via the Chari pass and ’AH Kuh is not particularly difficult. The approaches to the Gil-i-Shah and Pambakal passes are even in June over snow, but for Persian mules and horses neither of them is so difficult as not to be in almost daily use. From30 Gil-i-Shah the drop on the south side towards the Bazuft valley is one of 5,000', almost perpendicular as viewed from above, but the zigzags are worse in appearance than in reality. The Pambakal is very similar to the Gil-i-Shah, if anything more difficult. With the exception of the Ahwaz-Isfahan track, all the roads from the highlands to the lowlands pass through large areas of country deserted in summer, being occupied only in the winter months when the tribes are in their winter quarters. On the Shushtar-Isfahan road from Gotwand onwards it is difficult to ob tain any provisions after May 15th until the Chari pass has been negotiated, and the same remarks hold good in a greater degree to the Gil-i-Shah and Pambakal routes. The question of supplies on these routes need not be considered from a military point of view, as it is impossible to imagine any situation which could lead a force up such routes, unless fully provided with all the necessary supplies. At all events it may be said with confidence that no supplies of any kind can be relied on for more than 50 animals and men on these routes, and that only at certain stages. Drinkable water is obtainable at all stages on all these routes, the only exception being the first stages from Ahwaz of the Lynch road, which, until Jain, is poorly supplied from surface wells : but water can be obtained anywhere in the desert by digging a few feet, and this point need cause no anxiety. All tracks in the Bakht’ari country are alike impossible wheeled traffic. for wheels. Major W. E. Morton, R.E., who reported for the Foreign Depart ment in 1906 on the alignment and condition of the road as a caravan track and as a possible route for a motor car service, came to the following conclusions:— (1) The plains section, viz., Ahwaz to Salmieh, presents no difficulties. (2) The low hills section, Salmieh to Malamir, could be utilized, but at a considerable cost ; sayRs. 35,000. (3) The mountainous section, Malamir to Kharaji, is wholly unsuitable, and parts of it not practically possible of adaptation. (4) The upland section, Kharaji to Isfahan, could be render ed feasible.There thus remains a distance of 67 miles only, i.e., between Malamir and Dopulun, that is not by any means adaptable to wheeled traffic. The outside sections could be made practicable for wheeled traffic. It should be borne in mind that the advent of cheap fuel oil to Ahwaz during the next few years from the Maidan Minaftun- Muhammareh pipe line will go far towards making the adapta tion of this road to wheeled traffic commercially profitable.chapter V. Climate. The article under the heading “Medical in Volume I (Bakhtiari Garmslr) of this report by Dr. M. Y. Young, M.B., applies generally to the whole Bakhtiari country, and reference to it is invited for remarks as to the effect on the health of troops of the climate of the low country. The Upper Bakhtiari country enjoys in summer a cool climate, and possessing verdure and water, offers many charms to those who can escape to it from the parched plains of Persia. In winter the high altitude ^ gives it a severity which is dreaded by the habitual dwellers in tents. The roads and passes are reported closed, and for want of traffic they virtually remain so till the snow melts. A certain propor tion of the inhabitants, however, reside through the winter in per manent villages. The nomadic Bakhtiari, by moving up to the hills in the middle and end of April, and remaining there till the end of Sept ember, contrives to avoid the extremes of heat and cold. Were any circumstance to prevent the migration to the low country of any large number of tribesmen, the mortality would probably be great amongst the women and children, who are quite un provided with clothes suitable to resist severe cold, nor can such be quickly obtained. Mosquitoes are a plentiful source of annoyance, if not of fever, in the marshy plains of Malamir and Chighakhur during the summer and autumn, and also in the Chehar Mahal district. Wherever irrigation is practised, or stagnant water stands, there, as may be expected, flourishes the mosquito : but from the writer’s observation the mosquito seems also to exist in considerable num bers in places where these conditions do not obtain, but where there is vegetation. The sand-fly, not less annoying, and less easy to avoid by nets, etc., abounds everywhere during the summer. The crops of the highland valleys are sown before the snow fall, at the end of October, and reaped in late summer or early autumn, only a short time before the next year’s crop is sown. ( 33 ) 12 I. B. B34 The following examples of temperature at various heights on the Shushtar-Isfahan road from 29th May to 25th June 1908 3 of interest:— Sar-i-Shah .. 2,000' 100° maximum. Chulwar .. 2,300' 105° Haud-i-Nau .. 4,250' 102° Khan-i-Kushta .. .. 3,200' 112° Chilau .. .. 3,900' 103° Ab-i-Anarl .. 4,700' 92° Pahani Tit .. 6,300' 86° Kaleh Bazuft .. 6,300' 100° Pa-i-Chari .. 5,700' 85° Gardan-i-Chari (camp) .. 8,400' 72° „ minimum 50° Surah .. .. 8,000' 83° Samun .. .. 7,800' 85° Kaleh Agha .. 7,300' 91° Sawyer reports that the snowfall in the highland valleys is from 6' to 3', the former being the maximum average of the simple snowfall, but this is not confirmed by natives living in the Ardal and Chighakhur valleys, who name the latter figure as the minimum average. As a general rule it may be said that the shade temperature falls 5° for 1,000' of ascent after 2,000', up to which point there is no appreciable diminution, but rather an increase of heat. Thus at Maidan Minaftun the average daily maximum in July is 118°, at a height of 1,500', so on the Chari pass (9,500') it should be 78°. The climate is not unlike that of the lower ranges of the Himalaya in early summer, before the rains fall, but somewhat dryer on the whole. There is of course no regular rainy season, corresponding to the monsoon in India, and outside the area of heavy snowfall the rainfall probably does not exceed 15' per annum. Rain generally falls in October in the Chehar Mahal and Chighakhur districts, and the nights begin to be very cold and frosty. The general dryness of the air, combined with the height of the country above sea-level, engenders a wide variation between the diurnal and nocturnal temperature. The climate is on the whole well suited to Europeans, and admirable sanatoria could be formed for troops operating in the low country. Except via the Bakhtiari road, however, the trouble involv ed in reaching high ground from the plains is such as to make it scarcely worth while to seek escape thus from the heat of the plains, for it is only after Deh Diz is passed that the summer temperature begins to be comfortable during the day.CHAPTER VI.

The march of events in Central Asia, and on the North-West Possibi ity of collision with Frontier, and the conclusion of the Russia in South-West Persia. Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907, have combined to make the probability of military operations in South- West Persia against a Russian force extremely unlikely. No attempt, therefore, will be made to deal with the question of resist ing an advance of Russian troops through the Bakhtiari country en route to the Persian Gulf. Major Sawyer's report on this subject is based on the assumption that the position recommend ed to be occupied, i.e., from the Ab-i-Diz at Bahrain to Sultan Ibrahim south of Ganduman “ can be easily taken up and made defensible by a force with ^or without the consent of the local inhabitants.' Without going into details, it may be remarked that this posi tion can be turned to the west by the Burujird-Khurramabad road, to the east by the Isfahan-Bushire road, both the latter offer ing greater facilities for troops than any of the tracks through the Bakhtiari country. Moreover it is not easy to concur in the ver dict that “ this position along the Outer Range of mountains can be easily taken up.' The hilly country, and the difficulty of obtaining provisions from the inhabitants, if they were not on friendly terms, constitute formidable difficulties. Internal commotions in Persia, leading to intervention by Great Britain, and the despatch of troops to Isfahan, amongst other places, seem more likely contingencies than Anglo-Russian hostilities. It is advisable, therefore, to consider the relative advantages of the Bushire-Shiraz-Isfahan route and that via Ahwaz. Briefly stated, they may be summarized as follows Via Bushire. 1. Bombay-Bushire, by mail 6 days. 2. Bushire-Shiraz-Isfahan, 478 miles. Via Muhammareh and Ahwdz. Bombay-Muhammareh 7 days. Muhammareh-Ahwaz-Isfahan, 356 miles. ( 35 ) E 236 Via Bushire. 3. Bushire is a bad port for landing ani mals, etc., the wharf being a mile or more from steamer, and the anchor- 4. Cable communication Bombay-Bu- shire, thence all the way en route telegraphic communication with Isfa han. 5. Transport can be collected at Bu shire with less publicity, in greater numbers and with less difficulty than at Ahwaz. 6. 300 cavalry could move along the Shiraz-Isfahan route without diffi culty, and could be greatly assisted by telegraph officials en route. 7. Consular authority always present. 8. Track is on the whole easier than that via Ahwaz, and less affected by heat and snow. 9. Cash for use of Officer Commanding force obtainable at Bushire, where there is a Treasury, without notice. 10. Road does not traverse the country of any single powerful tribe, and troops less likely to meet with resist ance. Via Muhammareh and Ahwaz. Muhammareh a good port, the wharf only a few hundred yards from the steamer, the anchorage in a river. Wire to Muhammareh and Ahwaz from Bushire cannot be relied on and often breaks down in winter. No wire along the road. From 50 to 100 mules could be col lected at Ahwaz from Dizful and Shushtar with afortnight’s notice : to obtain a larger number would require more notice and might be impossible. 100 cavalry and transport could move along the Ahwaz-Isfahan route if three days reserve of everything were carried, but assistance en route could not be relied on. Consul present only from November to May at latest. Cash obtainable after ample notice only, and then not for certain. fed Road traverses Bakhtiari country under the control of Khans who are now closely bound up with Isfahan politics, and whose friendship cannot by any means be assumed. It will be seen, therefore, that the weight of argument seems to be in favour of the Bushire-Isfahan route, should necessity arise for the movements of troops to Isfahan or Tehran. Ahwaz-Isfahan Road. If for any reason the Ahwaz road be selected, 20 days , food for men, and fodder and grain for animals should be brought with the force from India, and also horseshoes forthree months. This procedure will not be appreciably more expensive as far as Ahwaz is concerned, and will free the officers interested from anxiety on this point. Five days rations of food for men, three days’ food for animals (including one day’s fodder) should be carried on mules on the march. Tents on field service scale should be taken. The scale of bedding, etc., should be calculated on field service scale, not relief scale. Sweepers and bhistis should not be taken, and only half the regulation number of saises. The remainder should be enlisted in Persia; if obtained they will be very useful, if not their absence will not vitally affect the efficiency of the force. All ranks should be informed in advance that they must not expect to feed as in India, but must feed as Persians do. The Consulate Guards of Indian Cavalry who for some years have been employed in Persia soon accustom themselves to feed on thin Persian bread, with such condiments as the local bazar affords, and a force entering the country should do the same. Fuel for cooking being so scarce, it will be necessary for troops to purchase bread for four or five days in advance when possible. Persian bread of the thin variety keeps good and sweet for many weeks. Officers should note that no tinned provisions are to be obtain ed at Muhammareh or at Ahwaz. There are certain times of the year during which nothing but urgent military necessity could justify the despatch of troops by this route. From the end of May to the end of September the heat in the low country, which may be taken to extend to Dopulun, is very great, the average maximum shade temperature during these months being 118° F. Water also is not very plentiful, though it is not scarce enough to cause real trouble. Night marching would be almost essential if the force were to reach Isfahan in an efficient state. Moreover, the tribes having migrated to the hill, supplies en route would be scarcer than in winter. In winter also, from the end of December to the end of Feb ruary, troops should not leave Ahwaz en route for Isfahan, if it can be avoided, owing to the snow and the cold, and to the fact that the tribes being mostly in the low country supplies en route would be difficult to obtain beyond Malamir. General Recommendations. Whatever be the time of year and whichever be the route; chosen, the force should be. split up, if the state of the country[38 permits it, into small bodies aggregating not over 100 animals. This will render the supply problem less formidable, as each successive party can do something to prepare the way for the party behind it. 75 per cent, of the mules required should be brought from India, but if it turns out that more than the remaining 25 per cent, can be obtained locally, it would be desirable to leave Indian mules behind, and utilize the Persian mules, who understand Persian roads and food, and whose drivers are also less difficult to cater for than imported ‘ £ drabis. Should it be decided to despatch a force to Isfahan, informa tion on the following points, amongst others, should be given to the consular authorities at Bushire or Ahwaz or Muhammareh as the case may be :— (1) number of officers, men, followers and animals; (2) date of arrival at Muhammareh; (3) general orders regarding them; (4) what rations will be required locally, and on the road ; (5) how many mules are required from local sources; (6) whether interpreters are wanted ; (7) a substantial sum of money should be placed at the dis posal of the consular authority, who can do nothing in the above matters without money. Composition of Force. Guns. A few remarks on the composition of such a force may not be out of place here. The presence of two or more mountain guns with the force would have a moral effect out of all proportion to the difficulty entailed by sending them out. They would be a very efficient substitute for 100 sowars. The mules necessary for these guns would stand the bad roads better than horses, and would in every way give less trouble. No Persian Governor with guns at his disposal will undertake military operations without them, though in Persian hands they are always ineffective and often useless. Amongst hill tribes in particular, the moral effect of guns would be very great indeed. An extra supply of picks, and a crowbar or two and some shovels should be issued to the detachment, to be carried loose on the mules for use on the roads where necessary. Many bad places on the roads in Persia can be substantially improved by two or three men with a pick and crowbar, without delaying the caravan.Interpreters. It would probably be necessary to have an interpreter with each body of troops proceeding inland. Men able to speak Persian and Hindustani would serve the purpose, and there are several such in the employ of the Oil Company at Ahwaz, whose services might be obtained on an emergency, and at Bushire little difficulty in this point should be experienced. Some sowars who have previously served in Consular Guards in Persia should be included in each detachment.CHAPTER VH. ROUTES.Route No. 1. Ahwaz (Nasir!) to Ispahan via the Lynch (BakhtiIri) road. Principal authorities. —Major Douglas, Mil. Attache at Tehran, 1903, Maj. Arbuthnot S. and T. Corps, 1904-05, Maj. W. R. Morton, R.E., 1906, Capt. Lorimer, H. B. M.’s Consul at Ahwaz, June and November 1 9 °6- Epitome. General. —For details of construction see Ch. II and Vol. I of this report. Used all the year round, but generally closed by snow in winter for a short period to mules, t.e., from a few da^ s to a month, and for as long as 2 months to camels. Total distance. —275 m. in 17 stages. General account is contained in Ch. IV of this reporty to which reference is in* vited. Climate. — Vide Ch. VI of this volume. The road is suitable for troops, except in Jan., Feb. and March on account of snow, and June to Aug. on account of the excessive heat, from Ahwaz to Dopulun ; could be used in an emergency all the year round. Local and Indian country-bred horses do not suffer from summer heat. Transport. —The following is an estimate of the probable number of animals obtain able in two months :— (a) For the lower stages, camels from Kuwait, 6,000 ; and Arbuthnot says 2,000 mules from Shushtar and Dizful. Carts and other vehicles nil. Ahwaz itself owns only 100 mules. Lorimer does not think that it would be easy to collect 2,000 mules at one time. The Ilidts have only bullocks and donkeys, and would probably not part with either readily. In any case collection at Nasirx would be a difficult business. (b) For the higher stages, from the Chehar Mahal and Isfahan, camels, 250 » mules 2,500.— {Arbuthnot.) r Sawyer says that Ilidts require all their own transport for at least two months in the spring and two months in the autumn ; and that they would not be induced to give up all their means of nomading. Lorimer considers both donkeys and bullocks would make very unsatisfactory transport for troops. He disagrees with Sawyer’s advice of mounting infantry on donkeys on this route in summer, as he says the whole day would be consumed on the road. He does not believe that in an emergency any pack bullocks or donkeys would be forthcoming. In the course of months donkeys could be collected probably from the Bakhtiari and Chehar Mahal villages ; the numbers would depend largely on the time spent in collecting. Several thousands could probably be collected with an infinity of trouble and months of time. A few hundred donkeys should be obtainable more easily from chdrydddrs. Donkey caravans not uncommonly ply between Ahwaz and Isfahan. The difficulty would be to get hold of them and bring them together. Pack bullocks are practically unobtainable. Shoeing can be done at Ahwaz and Ramuz, but only with Persian shoes. Supplies. —Certain limited quantities of supplies are laid down at most of the stages, probably sufficient for a party of 100 men, and 500 animals for 1 day, but at several of the stages there are often no supplies on hand. At some places where there are villages ( 45 )46 Route No. 1 — contd. these amounts might be obtainable normally, but during the period preceding the har vesting of the new crops in May supplies are a difficulty almost anywhere. The supplies referred, to above are only barley and bhusa. At Ahwaz for 1,000 men at 15 days notice, '200 at 6nc6.' * After Naghun, stage 12, the country is productive, but arrangements for collection would probably have to be made in advance for even a single cavalry regiment. Fuel for a big force would have to be collected atWais, Jaru, Chashmeh-i-Eaughani Mai amir, and from Ardal and Naghun onwards. Ghi would have to be collected and carried for a big force. If the nomads were on the road, as in the early spring and early autumn, ghi could probably be obtained from them, but time for arrangement is necessary. Sheep and goats.—Very numerous, particularly during the cold weather. It is impossible to give figures of produce that are of any value. Years vary very much In 1906 grain and fodder were scarce and dear m the Cheaar Mahal and Isfahan. Sheep and cattle estimates can also only be guess work ; and it must be remembered that they are a moving item and are not available in the same place all the year round. Arbuthnot’s estimation, however, is appended. Sawver says Under all circumstances it would be safer for the commissariat to rely entirely on its Indian resources at first (whatever the country supplies are they would be available later) ” and Lorimer agrees in this dictum. Section (1).—Salmieh would be a very much better place than Bandar Nasiri at which to collect transport Snd supplies, as the low hills to the east of it furnish excellent grazing especially during the winter and spring. Fuel, however would be a difficulty There would probably be sufficient sub-soil water at all seasons, but there is no proof of this To permit of this Colonel Douglas strongly recommends that materials for a light railway should be among the first material to be despatched m case of an advance being made along this route. A light railway could probably be laid and would stand in dry weather. Whether it could be laid, and if laid, whether it would staid traffic, when the soil is saturated, without ballast would require professional opinion. BaUast would only be obtainable from the Ahwaz hills and those beyond Sa m eh- u is very scarce all over the plain.' With the exception of sheep and goats, and some bhu,a in the^autumn, no supplies are obtainable for troops, en route, and would have to be collected beforehand. Section (2).—There are a certain number of poor habitations at all the stages, but supplies for anything but a very small party would not be procurable generally. Grain and fodder, however, are said to be available at all times at Jam, stage 3, and at Chashmeh-i-Raughani, stage 4, in quantities sufficient to meet the requirements of the normal traffic. Except on the Kaleh Tul plain fuel is nowhere to be found in any very great quantities at the halting-places, but it could everywhere be easily brought m from the neighbouring heights. There is a certain amount of grazing for both mules and camels during spring. At other seasons of the year no fodder for mules could be procured locally, though camels and donkeys could usually find something to eat, it would, however, require to be supplemented both with grain and bhusa. Section (3).—In this section fuel is generally abundant from Malamlr, stage 6, to NSahun stace 12. From thence onward fuel for a big force would probably be scarce, there being no natural wooding. Supplies are scarce at the halting-places, at most of which there are no permanent habitations, the exception being Deh Diz, Dopu un, Naghun, and Kharaji. No grazing at most seasons of the year. Section (4).—Some, but not much, dry wood fuel could be collected near the villages also some prepared dung fuel. The amount of supplies that could be collected would vary according to the season and year.t \\ \ ^ 47 Mhk, fte sup^ at 15^ for coIImBu meat, M ^wete« btaiaed fid ier, 'R varj vety sad Isfahj], embered tkt 3 year rong auaissariatto ilies are they -siri at which Bh excelleat a difficulty, no proof of for a light case of an and would ould st;ud a\ opium n'.etu 'Fuel some hhiffl .liave to be j stages, tat rally.

Provided that they had sufficient notice, the Bakhtiari Chiefs could no doubt col lect a certain quantity of bh u-sd or other fodder, barley, sheep and goats, rice and probably a little flour and ghl, at most of the stages but the supplies would have to be seen and not taken on trust, otherwise they might not be forthcoming. In the ChehSr Mahal and Llnjani districts, agents sent on ahead could possibly collect sufficient to enable a few thousand men to be pushed on rapidly to Isfahan, but the country would not bear the strain of a large force passing through. Water.—In the first stage the water from the Karun river is good for all purposes. From the Karun river to A’ala Khurshid (stage 5), the water is obtained from wells and in the event of troops being moved along the road, it would be necessary to send on ahead to have the existing wells cleared out and new ones dug. Most of the water is brackish, the fresh water springs being very small, but the former is fit for animals. The water-supply at Jaru, stage 3, and at Chashmeh-i-Ra ighani, stage 4, is in the form of springs, and abundant. On the remainder of the route there would be good and sufficient water for a brigade with transport. Alternative stages. — {a) From Ahwaz there is a direct track across the open plain to Umm-ul-Gharaibeh. This route is shorter than the regular route vid Wais (stage 1), and ia sometimes used by caravans. Grazing .—Poor and scarce, never sufficient of itself for mules, not particularly favourable for camels, but enough for donkeys during the spring. In summer practically none. Physical obstacles.—No repairs could fit the track for wheels. Stages 3 and 5 would require repair, if in regular use by an army. Local labour bad, expensive and scarce ; few tools available. {b) Owing to the high Zirrah pass (stage 13) on the route from.D.opu!un to Kharaji vid Naghun, being usually blocked by snow for three or four months in the year (December to March), there is an alternative route vid Ardal and the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash. (c) Both the Zirrah and the Darkash Warkash passes may be entirely avoided by a track which diverges at Siligun about 2£ m. north of Naghun, and runs vid Chighakhur, Urujan, Tang-i-Duzdan, and Khulinjan. This route is some 4 miles longer than via the caravan route, but can easily be done in the same number of stages, while the highest point at the Tang-i-Duzdan is more than a thousand feet lower than the Zirrah pass, and the approaches are much less steep. The Bakhtiari Khans have no difficulty in driving carriages from Chighakhur to Isfahan. The track between Khulinjan and tjso-v. Abrlsham is encroached on by cultivation, and the exit of the Ghighakhur valley iTclosed by a rocky spur, and the road continuing to Bulclaji is not driveable. These difficulties could easily be removed. The carriage route actually used is a circuitous one. The following is the route followed by the Khans when driving from Isfahan to Chighakhur :— Isfahan. Najafabad. Tihrun-i-Karwand. Abpinah. Samun. Deh Kurd (over the Chal-i-Shutur). Shalamzar. Chighakhur. (d) A made road connects Ardal with Siligun. (e) Road throughout very easy. For wheeled traffic improvements would be re* quired at the bottom of the Chighakhur valley and in the higher part of its continuation the Buldaji valley. Also probably in the immediate neighbourhood of Urujan (stage 15) ; and, owing to canals the track being narrow, in parts of the cultivated tract beyond Khu linjan. No difficulty would be found in making these improvements.48 Route No. 1 — contd. The Chigh&amp;khur valley is said to be deeply covered in snow in winter. At Lu (stage 16) the snow does not lie long. Water-supply uncertain. In July with 60 animals and 40 men there was no difficulty. Abundant for all requirements at Khulinjan and to near Bagh-Abrisham. Physical obstacles—{a) The descent to the Karun river to the Pul-i-Shalfl (stage 7) is bad. No difficulty would be experienced in improving this point. (6) The descent from the Gardan-i-Marvari (stage 9), to the Pul-i-’Amarat, over the Ab-i-Bazuft, is, in the summer months, the most difficult point met with on the road. There is no feasible way of avoiding this descent, and it would require much labour to effect any very appreciable improvement. ( c) The Gardan-i-Laghamgir (stage 10), the gradients of [which are steep, and on which snow lies some 3 or 4 feet deep near the summit. The surface, however, is on the whole good. Slight improvements could easily be carried out. (d) The Barrah Murdah pass (stage 11), a sort of plateau with a slight depression in which the snow lies deeply between December 15th and March 15th. (e) The Gardan-i-Zirrah (stage 13), a narrow high pass with steep ascent and descent. It is blocked by snow from December 15th to March 15th. Practically no improvements could be carried out. On the alternative stages the following are the 'physical obstacles :— (/) Dopulun-Isfahdn via Ardcd. (c). —The Tang-i-Darkash Warkash has to be pass ed. It is a narrow and precipitous gorge, the track being only 2 feet wide in places. Any improvement to the road in this defile is practically out of the question.

At 2 m. a road, and the Persian telegraph line, go off to the right to Bo /azjfm, on the Biishire- Shiraz road, via Ramuz and Behbehan. At 5|- m. the village of Graneh is passed t m. W. of the road.

Here there The population in this vicinity varies with the season, but is never entirely absent. Water from shallow wells, scarce in summer ; supplies scanty, but after the rains have set in there is a large body of standing water. Here the direct route from Ahwaz across the plain joins in on the right {vide Alternative stages (a)). ^ At about 9| m. in wet weather there is a bad quagmire, extending for a breadth of 300 yards. It appears impossible to circumvent it. At 11m. the wells of Nihairleh are passed similar to those at Umm-ul-Gharaibeh. Tuere are always some Arabs settled here. The skirt of hummocky ground is reached here, and is followed until at about 12J m. the road bends to the N. E. and turns into it. At 15 m. cross a small range of low hummocky hills with sand drifts in places. Although not constituting an obstacle, wheeled traffic would find it rather heavy work crossing it. This hum mocky ground with soft going continues for 3 or 4 m. The highest and sandiest bit is at 15 m. At 16| m. the road changes its direction to E. by S. At 20 m. Raghaiweh is passed i m. to N. It is the name of a tract of country and there are usually some habitations and wells. Two kandr trees about 1 mile apart serve as a landmark. Salmieh is a rather vague term, there being no village nor even permanent camp to give it a definite application. In November 1906 the only water and habitations, and consequently the only place to camp, was at the western kandr tree of Raghaiweh. It is stated, and is credible, that shallow wells anywhere in this tract bounded, by the hills, will yield a constant supply of water if kept in use, but they dry up if abandoned. Water for 20 men in summer, 200 in winter, and for animals pro rata. Both Salmieh and Raghaiweh are the property of the Bakhtiari. Note —Alternative Stage. (a) Ahwaz to Umm-ul-Gharaibeh. 1 Umm-ul- Gharaibeh 19 19 Gen. dir. N. E. This is an alternative to the route usually followed by caravans vid Wais. It saves about 3 m. in the distance to Salmieh and is sometimes followed, thus avoiding Wais and going direct from Ahwaz to Umm-ul-Gharaibeh (17 m. E. of Wais) where it joins the main route. A halt could easily be made at Umm-ul- Gharaibeh, between which place and Salmieh if one is required, Nihairleh is the only suitable halting place, but this is only 5 m. from Umm-ul-Gharaibeh, while it lies 13 m. from Salmieh. The route diverges from the main track just N. of Ahwaz. No defined track. On the way Arab settlements of Zorgan are passed about half-way betweeq Ahwaz and Umm-ul-Gharaibeh. Barley and bhusd can generally be obtained. 12 IB Fuel nil. Water from wells.50 Route No. 1.— contd. 3 t Jaw 18 58 Gen. dir. E by N. After leaving Salmieh the road continues for H m. over the plain, and then steeply ascends a spur between two ravines in a range of gypsum hills, which rise to a level of 450’ above ’Alwanieh. The descent is easy. From the bottom of the descent, where a small brackish stream has to be crossed, the road runs over an undulating plain to 6f m. It then lies in a dip between low hills emerging at 8 m. on’ to a nearly level bit of ground, followed to 8J m., whence it goes up a dry torrent bed between hills of broken rock and earth. At 8J m. is an Arab set tlement, known as Gazin, where grain and fodder can be obtained in season. Oil springs near by. It is located at the head of the brackish Kindik stream. There is a spring of fresh water near t S. E. At 9| m. the first considerable ascent commences up a spur from the h’ad of th? torrent valby, over hills of broken disintegrated rock. The ascent is accomplishe I by zigzags and involves a climb of 800'. The road then crosses a dip in the hills, and a second pass at 10 m. From here the road descends to 12 m. whence to 16 m. it undulates over spurs and ravines running down from hills on the right of the road. From the top of the ascent to Jaru, at 18 m. there is a gradual descent. Jarii is a permanent settlement of 120 houses. A plentiful supply of water is obtained from two springs situated about | m. N. of the village. Pop. 600: 1 , 00 ) sheep a 1 1 goats, 200 cattle. Wheat, budey and rice. Supplies for 1,000 men at 15 days’ notice, and 500 at 4 days’. 69 Gen. dir. E. Leaving Jaru a slight descent is made into a drainage depression, in which, at the point where the road crosses, is a spring. Thence across an undulating plain, gradually ascending. At 2 m. the principal ascent on the whole gtawe commences. The rise is 270' and the descent on the spur side is about 110'. The formation is gypsum. At 4 m. a brackish stream is crossed. Thence the road traverses gypsum hills : the ground is much cut up by ravines. The ground traversed by the route lies in a valley between low hills. After crossing the stream the track runs through a low range of rocky hills, passing through gaps in a series of natural walls of rock running transversely across the route. At 13 m. a small stream of brackish water is forded, the water of which is fit for transport animals. Chashmeh-i-RaughanI is reached at 14 m. on the edge of the Tau ah plain. There are no permanent habitations, but it is occupied by Chehar Lang Bakhtilri, who build hut settlements. There are several brackish springs giving a plentiful supply. Chashmeh-i-Rau- ghaxi. 11 Kalkh Tul 21 90 Gen. dir. for the first 9J m. E. and for the latter half, N. The most noticeable feature of this stage is the number of torrents and ravines that have to be crossed between Chashmeh-i-Raughani and A’a'a Khurshid, 14,| m. From the former place the road runs for the first 3| m. over the undulating plain of Taulah, and then crosses a low range of hills. At 6| m. a road branches off to the south to Ramuz. Undulating country intersected with ravines is traversed until the Ab-i-Dambili is reached at 9| m., which is crossed by a ford. The stream is insignificant in Nov. The route now lies close to and N. of the Bulawas river to 10| m. where it changes direction to the N. At 14 m. the Rui-i-Zard is crossed, the hills here being closer in. The descent to the river is mads by a side ravine, and necessitates a drop of about 100'. The ascent from the stream is somewhat less great than the descent, and leads to the plateau on which stands the village of A’ala Khurshid, in the neighbourhood of which there is much rice cultivation. Close by are villages, BX h Ma ik, Ka'eh Khatnisi and Shang : total about 300 houses, supplies for one batta ion and transport. From A’ala Khurshid to Kaleh Tul there is a gentle rise, except between 16 and 17 m., where a low range of conglomsrate hills has to be crossed, the ascent , being fairly steep. The road runs to the W. of the Ab-i-Gilal as far as Kaleh Tul. At 17J m. a road branches off on the right to Bagh Malik. At 21 m. the village of Kaleh Tul is reached. On an eminence to the N.

Leaving Kaleh Tul the track winds through low scrub on t' e Kaleh Tui plateau to about 4 m. where it crosses a dry torrent bed. Here the Tang-i- Nashalil is entered which continues for about 8 in. On the E. of the road are the lower ranges of the lofty Mangasht mountains, and on the W. a range of hills parallel to them. The Tang-i-Nashalll and the hills to the N. of Kaleh Tul have lallut (holm-oak) wooding. It would probably be better to cut fuel here and to carry on to Malamir. The upper portions of the hills are rocky and steep, t ic lower slopes gentle and undulating, and covered with earth in places. Leaving ti e gorge at about 12 m. the route turns N.-W., skirts some low hills and ascends and then descends slightly on to the plain of Malamir, where there are sm ,ll villages and settlements of Bakhtiari. The population of the Malamir valley is nomadic, and what habitations there are, with the exception of Malamir itself, are deserted in summer. The serai is situated about 1J m. S. of the village of Malamir. Water is available all the year round from a stream, which flows N. and forms a small lake in low ground on the plain, N.-E. of the village, and which ah ays contains s; It water. Large supplies would normally be available here. Grain and fodder would be scarce before the new crops were harvested. This route is not always considered safe for caravans, and one further to the west, via Halagun, joining the other 3 or 4 miles from Malamir, is then used. It is 2 or 3 m. longer. The Malamir valley contains 40 places of habitation and has 2,000 ploughs. Supplies for 2C0 men and for 1,CG0 at week’s notice. Fuel rather scarce. Note.—A good alternative route to Malamir from Kaleh Tul, avoiding the Tang-i- Nashalil keeps to the W. side of the Kaleh Tul plain, past the Shuhrazan settlements, and thence up a low pass to the Halagun plain; from there 5 m. to Malamir, joining the road described above at the north end of the Tang-i-Nashalil. Pul-i-Shalu 20 126 Gen. dir. for the firsts m. N.-E. and for the remainder of the stage E.-S.-E. Leaving Malamir the road runs for about 3 m. N.-E. and then rounds a spur of the Mangasht mountains. Here it runs nearly E. and ascends a practically level valley, reaching the foot of the first climb at about 6 m. The ascent is a steep and broken one by zigzags. Thence to 10J miles an undulating plain is traversed. At 9f m. there is a steep and very rough descent by zigzags of about 900'. The gardan at the top is known as the Gardan-i-Sarrak. In this descent there are the remains of an ancient paved road known as the Rah-i-Sultani, From the foot of the d'.scent the road continues S.-E The valley of a stream lying between high hills is now followed ; water, which mainly comes from a spring at about 12f m., called Chashmeh-i-Khatun, is good. The supply disappears into the ground about a mile further on. At about 14| m. the route runs for a distance of some 60 yds. or so along the perpendicular face of the hills on the N. side of the valley, and elsewhere along the edge of a steep drop to the stream to 40* below. The path to Kaleh Madraseh is narrow, and except at the end lies lo ig the north side of the ndld. At Kaleh Madraseh this ndld is joined by another, rim the east, the Tang-i-Kaf. An ascent is made along the gentle slopes of the hills beyond and the track follows the hill face, sloping down from the S. to the bed of the combined G 252 Route No. 1.— contd. stream. The highest point is reached at 19 m. which is the head of the valley and whence the descent to the Karun commences. The descent is very bad, partly down 1 he led of a narrow ravine, and partly along its edge, the ravine being crossed at a point about two-thirds of the way down. Further on a small plateau overlooking the Karun river is passed, the descent being continuous, and thence a steep descent to the bridge is made. This final descent to the bridge is cut in solid rock and is very steep, winding and difficult. The bridge is placed very low down so as to reduce the span to a minimum. It is an iron suspension bridge built by Messrs. Lynch Brothers. At the bridge the Karun flows between perpendicular cliffs, and the span of the bridge, about 43 yards, gives the un alterable breadth of the river at this point. From the bridge an ascent leads to a wide plateau on the right bank of the river. This ascent, though steep, is not nearly so steep as that on the Malamlr side, and is in less rocky soil. The serai of Pul-i-Shalu is not situated on the plateau, but is on a small inconvenient platform half-way up to it. Before the bridge was built, the river used to be crossed by a ford at Guclar-i-Balutak about 4 miles up-stream. From there the road proceeded S. of the present one through the hills until it reached the Kaleh Madraseh by the Tang-i-Kaf. The best camping ground is found 1| m. E. of the bridge on the river bank. 8 Deh Piz .. 13 139 Gen. dir. E.-S.-E. A steady ascent up a valley from the serai at Pul-i-Shalu to the end of the stage at Deh Diz camping- ground. There are a few habitations in the Rikat river valley, the chief of which is Gurgak. About f m. after leaving the serai a path has been cut for a hundred yards or so in perpendicular rock. In the accent here it is much worn away and very narrow, while at the top of the ascent the hill slope is very steep into the valley below. For the most part the ground traversed is fairly open, but a thick belt of oaks is passed at 9| m. Two inhabited villages, Kulmut and Peh Kuhnah, at 5 J and 8| in, respectively, lie at a short distance N. of the road on the slopes of the Kuh-i-Safld. There are several villages in the neighbourhood, one with a tower on S. side of the read at 4 m. called Rikat. All these villages are practically vacated in the summer months. Even Deh Diz is left a 1 most empty. Deh Diz has 70 houses and a population of 300 souls. 300 sheep and goats ; 150 cattle ; 10 horses. Supplies fairly plentiful. Place appeared well-supplied in June and November. Water-supply of the village is from a spring, \ m. above it, on the road to Shalil. Camp, if in any numbers, on sloping ground immediately below the village, or still lower in the vicinity of the old fort. 9 ShalIl .. 12 151 Gen. dir. E.-N.-E. For the first m. the ascent is steep and zigzag over limestone rocks in places. Then for a mile the road undulates along the slopes of the hills, crossing the range at the lowest part available, at the Deh Diz pass, which is about LSOCK higher than Deh Diz. Thence a steep descent is made down the N. slopes of the Kuh Mushgun. After crossing the crest a small perennial spring is passed near the road. The lower half of the descent is bad. At the foot of the descent a narrow tongue separating two valleys, both of which fall towards the Bazuft river, is crossed, and a steep ascent of about 70(/ follows. From the top of the ascent the route winds round valleys and spurs of the Kuh-i-Marvari. From the Marvari pass a very steep descent leads to the bridge over the Ab-i-Bazuft, the Pul-i-’Amarat, at 10J miles. This descent may he considered the worst on the route. It must always be severe on account of its length, but the state of repair makes a great difference. The bottom portion is' in rocky soil, and thence the track is narrow and rough. The immediate descent to the bridge is a steep surface of rock. The bridge is a steel wire suspension bridge constructed by Messrs. Lynch Bros, From the bridge the road ascends steeply for about 500', again descends, and then rises to the ground on which stands the Shalil serai. Shall] is the most isolated stage of the route. There is no.source of supplies immediately at hand, the result being tnat this serai is usually very badly provided- Supplies come up fromRoute No. 1— conld. the Bazuft valley, and probably a considerable quantity could be obtained from this direction. Water drinkable. From Deb Diz to Pul-i-’Amarat there is constant oak wooding, which reappears at the Shalil serai. 10 SABKHtN 12 163 Gen. dir. for the first 8 m. E. and after that N. Leaving the serai the route follows the valley of the Shalil stream crossed in the last stage, running along the slopes of the hills on the left bank of the stream. The path, which is made for the first If m. is cut in a slope of soft earth which is constantly slipping and being washed away. This is the cause of the track being so narrow that caravans coming in opposite directions have great difficulty in passing each other in many places. Parts of the track become very difficult in wet weather owing to mud. For the last J m. the road runs over nearly level ground, just above the stream. It then makes an ascent of 1,000' in rather more than 2 m. At 2| m. the route, hitherto running almost E. turns sharp to the left, leaving the main valley, and steeply ascends a narrow side valley down which flows the Shalll stream, its waters being used at the bend in the route for driving two flour mills. A path, 5' to 6' wide, has been cut in the steep hillside on the E. of the valley. At 3f m. the road reaches a plateau, and then runs for a few hundred yards alongside rice fields. Thence to 6| m. the route lies along the qndulating country situated at the foot of the Kub-i-Gerrah which slopes down to the Ab-i-Shalil. Just beyond here commences the ascent of a narrow valley, at the entrance to which a rocky cleft of about 50 yards length is traversed. At the top of the ascent at 7f m. is reached the Gardan-i-Laghamglr. From this point the route descends 2,000'. The descent is steep in places, but the surface is comparatively good. The bottom of the descent is reached at 10J m. After crossing the stream, which is forded at all times without difficulty, an ascent of a few feet is made on the far side to reach the higher ground on the right bank of the Sarkhun stream or Ab-i-Hilisat, which is then followed until it is crossed at the end of the stage. Here it issues in the form of a strong spring in a cavity in the cliffs on the left, or west, side of the road. The quantity of water varies with the season, but a few yards below the head spring there is always a copious flow. A wooden bridge of about 12' span has been provided here. To reach the Sarkhun serai on the left bank of the stream, a torrent bed has to bo Grossed. This is often dry, but a considerable amount of snow water comes down it at times. Oak wooding throughout this march. The villages of Hilisat, numbering 7 places of habitation, are near Sarkhun and contain 400 houses ; 500 fighting men ; 2,000 sheep and goats ; 500 cattle ; 40 horses ; 30 mules ; 500 donkeys ; and produce 2,00,000 mans of wheat and barley annually. A considerable amount of supplies could probably be obtained from here. The water at Sarkhun from the Ab-i Hilisat is excellent. For camping-ground there is a small irregular space impeded by boulders between the first bend of the Ab-i-Sarkhun and the torrent bed. There are also small spaces on the N. &amp; E. of the serai. There is some space inside the ruined serai for transport and stores. The walls are only 4 feet high in parts. 41 Dopulujst 16 179 Gen. dir. N. Leaving the Sarkhun serai the route proceeds up the Tang-i-Sarkhun. About 1J miles up it enters a gorge with 1 perpendicular sides. A short distance up the valley the road a scene’s the flanking hill on the left or W. It skirts round the end of this hill called Gul-i-Rukruk reaching the highest point at 3 m. It then resumes the direc tion of Dopulun, skirting the Tang-i-Hazar Jarib, for 1£ m. to the mouth of the Tang-i-Gandumkal. During a portion of this distance it runs along the edge of the high perpendicular cliffs which form the eastern side of the Tang-i-Hazar Jarxb. In this part of the route there are two steep descents, the latter a long one ending at the mouth of the Tang-i-Gandumkal, where this tang joins that of the Hazar Jarib. The lower part of the Tang-i-Gandumkal is a narrow gorge between perpendicular heights. Going gO' d up) re tie ascent to foot of Gardan-i-Gandumkal, tuen steep and stony, and finally ascends in revetted zigzags up a steep hill, face of loose stones and54 Koute No. 1 — contd. earth. There is a good camping-ground at Gandumkal, but no supplies at hand, except fuel and water. A slight descent over a basin quite 1J m. wide succeeds, and a short steep zigzagged ascent then leads to the highest point on the stage, known as the Gardan-i-Barrah Murdah 2,700'above Sarkhun. This path is o me times closed by snow for two months in the year but can then generally be crossed with the help of good mules, and by tramping down the snow sufficiently to bear the weight of laden animals ; but it is dangerous to attempt it in bad weather. From here to the end of the stage the route slants to the left down the mountain side, which slopes down to the Karun river. At 15| m. the upper plateau above the Karun is reached, whence there is a fall of over 200' to the brick bridge, known as the Pul-i-Malik, crossing the river. Span 12 yards ; 11' roadway; 150' above water. Bridge high in the middle. The immediate descent to, and alscent from, the bridge are difficult, being cut steeply in bed-rock. The serai has been built on the left bank of the river, about 100' above the bridge. This is a hard march either way. Oak wooding throughout the march except from the Gardan-i-Gandumkal to Sardab. Dopulun, 100 houses; 1,000 sheep and goats ; 50 cattle ; 4 horses ; 20 donkeys; 3 mills. Supplies scarce in June. Water and fuel plentiful. The best camping-grounds are on the left bank of the Karun on either side of the junction with the Ab-i-Sabza Kuh, and ground on the left bank of the Ab-i-Sabza Kuh, between that river and the village of Dopulun, when these are not under cultivation. *12 Naghun .. 11 190 Gen. dir. E. N. E. Leaving the Dopulun serai the plateau on the left bank of the Karun fiver is followed for about 300 yards. The route then descends to cross the Ab-i-Sabza Kuh, a large tributary of the Karun which it joins about 150 yards below the bridge. The descent is very steep in most parts and is over so t soil. The bridge over the Ab-i-Sabza Kuh is a ricketty structure of hurdle work made of brushwood supported on trees. It is a single span bridge and is at present (October 1906) out of repair and not crossable by animals. In the dry weather the Ab-i-Sabza Kuh can be forded near its junction with the Karun, and caravans cross the river by this means. Onwards there are two tracks. The best leads out of the village about E. by S. and up the Bazgiran mountains until it strikes a made path known as the Rah-i-Gil-i- Safid, which it follows to the left to the pass about N. From this pass the route descends steeply for half a mile and then crosses a plateau overlooking the Ab-i- Sabza Kuh. At 6| m. the edge of the plateau is reached and a descent of about 700' in a mile follows. Sabra Kuh river reached at | m. The river is usually crossed by a ford. At the crossing there was about 2' of water in October. In spring when swollen, it is crossed by a bridge f m. up stream. The bridge is permanent and in good repair. It is a timber bridge supported on two stone piers. The ascent from the river is very steep in places, and is in soft soil. Ascending from the river the route runs over broken ground. The path is a mere track, and at 9| m. it reaches the plain, which slopes down from the north of Ardal and Naghun towards the Karun river. Thence to Naghun, at 11 m., the plain is crossed with a gradual rise. Naghun 350 houses ; 1,500 sheep and goats ; 300 cattle ; 100 horses ; 300 donkeys ; 5 mills, 10 or 20 gardens in immediate neighbourhood and more at a distance. Water good. WTieat and barley grown in considerable quantities. The place is always well supplied and water is abundant. Camping space abundant. * Alternative Stages.

Thence up and down over difficult ground. At m. an ascent of 700' feet is made in less than a mile. At 4| m. the head of the ravine is reached an L the route .turns nearly due E. up the wide open valley of the Ab-i-Sabza Kuh leading to the plain of Ardal, reached in about | m. The route continues to ascend to mile 5|, and then gently descends to the perennial stream of Ardal. Thence an ascent of 100' leads to the large village of Ardal at 8 m. Supplies limited at all times ; nil in June. Water-supply small. 13 KharajI .. 20 207 Gen. dir., for 7 m. N. the i E. Leaving Ardal f.nd running N. W. the tra ;k crosses the plain of Ardal and ascends 100' in 2| m., where a steep descent to a plateau above the Behishtabad river is made. The total descent is some 500'. At about 50 yards from the bottom of the discent, which is 50 feet or so above the river, is a masonry bridge spanning a chasm, the entrance to the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash. The village of Behishtabad is situated close to the bridge, from which the latter takes its name. After leaving the bridge, the path ascends and descends 150' over a spur, through which the Ab-i-Behishtabad has cut its way above the bridge. The general direction here and through the gorge is N. E. Tne ascent to the defile is commenced at 3| m. The route now ascends the hill side which is mainly of earth, though rock crops out in places. The path is well cut in the hill side and the outer edge revetted. For the first £ m. the upward slope is steep, it then becomes flatter. Fr &gt;m the summit, at mile 6, the river can be seen 1,000' below. The descent is more gradual. For about f- m. the general slope is gentle near 6 m., whence the route runs level to 7 m., where there is a sharp drop to mile 7j, at which point the gorge may be said to end. From mile 5 to 7 the path has, to a considerable extent, been made in rock- Zigzags are freely used and wherever possible the path h*s been built out to avoid cutting into the rock. This is particularly noticeable at mile 7, where the whole descent consists of short zigzags thus built out. Fro n m. the route continues in the valley of the Behishtabad river, here situated between high hills. The valley gradually opens out. At about 7J- m. the river is joined by a stream on the right bank, the Ab-i-Junagun, flowing S. down a valley and at the simo point the main valley turns E. Lhe actual route lies up the side valley for a short distance. Crossing the stream by the brilge the route returns down the side valley and then turns E. to continue along the Ab-i-Shalamzar and Ab-i-Jehanbln to Kharajl. Following the valley of the main stream E. the route is level for ^ m. and then ascends to cross a rocky spur wnich projects into the valley, ending near the river in a steep drop, which is avoided by the ascent. A similar descent is made on the far side of the spur leading to a wide valley, through which the river meanders. The route runs over undulating ground, crossing a small stone bridge at 15| m., to about 17 m, where the village of Tasnniz is passed lying on the left bank of the river. The village of Kharajl is reached a: 20 m. (c) Nighun (stage 12) to YaUabad (stage 17) vii Chig lahhir and Urujan. No detailed report available. The track diverges from the caravan route 2J m. N. of Naghun. There is a somewhat steep descent to the Chighakhur basin which might be improved without difficulty. The Bakhtiari Khans find no difficulty in driving a carriage all the way from Chighakhur to Isfahan along this route. The distance is a trifle longer than that via the Zirrah pass, but can easily be done in the same number of stages, while the highest point at the. Tang-i-Duzdan is more than a thousand feet lower °than the Zirrah pass and its approaches much less steep. (d) There is a made road from Ardal, stage 12, alternative (b) direct to Siligun, and then striking the separating point of the Naghun-Kharaji and Naghun-Chigbakhur routes, vide alternative (e). There is a continuous rise; then near the end a ^slight descent into the Siligun yalley.56 Route No..l— contd. * ALTERNATIVE STAGE.

A good road runs along the foot of the hill on the N. or W. of the valley to 3f m. where the end of the valley, formed . ■ by a rocky spur and a dam holding up a large body of water, is reached. On the N. or E. side the dam abuts on the slope of low earthy hills. Cross to the other side of the valley at the dam. At the dam, when the water is low, it is possible to get round the end of the rocky spur in shallow water. Otherwise a very steep and difficult path over the spur which is about 100' high, has to be followed. Here the road is level with the village of Awangun (?) concealed behind earth spurs.

After passing Naghun village the road ascends a range of hills, oyer-looking the Ardal plain, by one zigzag. The ascent to the summit of the range of hills is nearly 800 in one mile. The ascent is in soft earth, and if necessary the gradient could easily be reduced. From the top of the ascent, the route descends to the Siligun stream, at 1| m., a small body of water at any time of the year. In the dry season its waters are almost entirely utilised to supply Naghun. A water course taps the stream at 3 m. and runs along the hill on the left bank and over the range crossed by the route just after leaving Naghun. After crossing the Siligun stream, the road follows up its right bank, running a few feet above it. The valley of the stream here is narrow, and a path has been cut in the sides in places. At 2f m. a track diverges nearly due E. to Chighakhur, about 9 m. distant. Here the valley opens out and the road becomes a mere track over undulating ground, gradually ascending to Similes, where the main ascent of the Kuh-i-Zirrah is commenced. The ground is rocky and steep, and the climb is a stiS one. From the point where the zigzags com mence to the Zirrah pass, at 6| miles, the ascent is not more than 300' in a cfistanco of 1,300 yards. The outer edges of the path are in places revetted with stone work. The road surface at present (1906) over the middle section is broken and bad. The Zirrah pass at an altitude of 8,800' above Salmieh is the highest point the route attains. It is about 3,500' feet above Isfahan. From the pass to Shalamzar—the descent is very steep and long. The bottom of the main descent of 2,000 is reached at about 9 m., where there is a small spring of water. For a mile beyond this the track is mostly very rough and stony. From the bottom of the main descent a further descent of about 200 or 300' in | m. leads to Shalamzar at 10J miles : | m. short of Shalamzar a deepish but narrow irrigation cut is crossed by a stone and earth culvert, which is (1906) breaking up and is only wide enough for a single animal. Bridging material is available at Shal amzar. Just before Shalamzar a small stream, the Ab-i-Shalamzar is crossed by a wooden bridge of two,spans of about 12' each, and roadway 10' wide. It has at present a very bad surface of boulders, but in October the stream was only about 18' deep. It has a sound bottom and level banks. Shalamzar is the chief residence of the Samsam-us-Sal- taneh. 250 houses; 5,000 sheep and goats; 100 horses ; 50 mules ; 200 donkeys. Beyond Shalamzar a low ridge of hills is crossed, the caravan track being steep. The Khans have made a carriage track over it f m. further W. After the descent a gentle ascent leads to the village of Kharaji, at 13 m. To reach the village the Ab-i-Jehan- bin has to be crossed by a masonry bridge. The bridge at Kharaji is in good repair and 12 I.B. H58 Route No. 1— contd. can be crossed by carriages. Kharaji, 200 houses ; 3,000 sheep and goats ; 40 horses ; 20 mules ; 200 donkeys ; wheat, barley, 'adas, and opium cultivation. Supplies and water plentiful. From Kharaji it is possible to drive to Jugagun, Shalamzar, Gishnagun and Isfahan. 14 Kavarukh 18 of Shamsabad at 4| m. 221 Gen. dir. N.-E. From Kharaji the route follows the valley of the Ab-i-Jehan-bin N., crosses the river by a masonry bridge at about 2J m., and reaches the village The path is nothing more than a track, and there is ample room to move on one side or the other, except near the bridge mentioned above, where the valley contracts and the foot of the rocky hills is skirted for a short distance before the bridge is reached ; and again beyond the bridge for about 50 yds., where the valley again widens out and becomes a large plain with hills on three sides. The actual route used by caravans does not go through the village of Shamsa bad, but skirts the hills on the E. and N. of the plain, probably to avoid cultivation which is very extensive here. A short distance N. of the village a low range of hills is crossed, The descent on the further side is somewhat less. The route then lies up a narrow valley, the direction being nearly N.-E., The valley is much culivated, vineyards being seen for the first time. The head of the valley is reached at about 9| m. whence an ascent of about 360' in about 1J m. is made, The descent is somewhat steeper. From the bottom of the descent the route runs nearly level to the village of Kavarukh, over undulating ground in a wide valley, a continuation of the valley of the Ab-i-Jehan-bin. This is the plain of Deh Kurd. Kavarukh, 1,500 houses ; 30,000 sheep and goats ; 1,000 cattle, including 200 donkeys ; 800 donkeys. Cultivation of wheat, barley and linseed. Two mills; 3 oil presses &amp; iron workers. There is a good stream of water which is used for irrigation lower down. Fire wood scarce. 15 Madraseh 20 241 Gen. dir. N.-E. Passing through the village of Kavarukh, the route conti nues to ascend the valley which gradually narrows to its head at about 5J miles. Rocky hills on either side rise to 300'—500' above the valley. There is no cultivation beyond £ m. from Kavarukh. A line of qandts is crossed at 4J m. At the head of the valley an ascent is made to the Rukh pass, at 10 m. The ground is rocky. The pass is insignificant. Then descend to the wide valley below. The top of the descent is bad going for animals. The total descent is about 900' in about 2} m. to the right bank of a small stream, at 11| m., flowing E. to N.-E., and ultimately falling into the Zindeh Rud. For the first J m. from the Rukh pass the descent is steep. From the foot of the descent the right bank of the stream mentioned above is followed for 1 m. whence the route follows higher stony ground, gradually descending almost to the bank of the Zindeh Rud, where the route joins that river. Several gardens are passed, and the country now becomes much closer. This stage can be broken anywhere after the descent from the Rukh pass has been completed. A convenient place for a halt is at Liaubid, 13 m., where there is a small serai. The route now lies along the right bank of the Zindeh Rud through the village of Cham Asman, 18 m., and on to Madraseh, at 20 m. Supplies and water ample. 16 Pul-i-Wargun 19 260 Gen. dir. N.-E. Just beyond Kaleh Madraseh the river is crossed by a masonry bridge of several arches known as the Pul-i-Kaleh. The bridge which originally consisted of 8 arches is in excellent condition.

The route here lies along cultivation, largely rice in summer when the overflow water from the fields swamps the path. For 200 yards the road runs along the edge of the river bank, which is revetted with planks. As Bistagun is reached the immediate neighbourhood of the river is left and higher ground ascended. The camping ground here lies on the N. side of the village, which, with its gardens and enclosures, extends to the river lying about 150' below. Leaving the river near Bistagun the track runs straight over open country to the Gao-i-PlsaJi. The descent is a long one until a small stream is reached, a tributary of the Zindeh Bud. Near the village of Bagh-i-Wahsh at Ilf m. 150 houses ; 10 rifles ; 2,000 sheep and goats ; 75 cattle ; 150 horses and mules ; caravanserai ; wheat, barley cotton, linseed and opium cultivation. Thence the route lies across a low swampy meadow with the remains of a stone causeway. The stream near Bagh-i-Wahsh is spanned by a wooden bridge on rough stone abutments. From here onward the route lies through numerous villages and along gardens, walled enclosures, and cultivation. The caravanserai of Pul-i-Wargun is reached at 19 m. Pul-i-Wargun has 200 rifles; 2,000 sheep and goats; 75 cattle, 3 mills. Supplies and water are abundant. 17 Isfahan 11 275 Gen. dir. N.-E. Immediately after leaving the village of Pul-i-Wargun the Zindeh Bud is crossed by a brick bridge on stone , piers. The bridge consists of 14 arches, and is 150' long by 14' clear width on the road-way. The approach is so narrow that it would prevent any horse-drawn field gun being brought on to the bridge. _ The banks of the river here are low, and in flood time the water may be 100 yards in expanse. From here to Yazdabad, at 3 miles, the road zigzags through cultivation with numerous water courses. At 4 m. the road from Chighakhur comes in on_ the right. Thence entering open country, the archway of the suburb of Dast Gird is reached at 5 m., shortly before which the village of Takht-i-Bustam is passed on the right. The route now winds through numerous gardens, and skirting Julfa for the last mile enters Isfahan by the Pul-i-Marnum. Carriages occasionally drive out from Isfahan over this stage. The track could, with very little work, be made easy in dry weather. Note to Route No. 1. Bistagun.

Track follows the right bank over spurs and through ravines of less fall, but in parts stony, though without losing its character as an excellent mule road. At 5 m. the valley (its cultivable part), till now not more than \ m. wide, opens out gradually to about 1 m., where the “two streams” forma junction in a pretty flat, well-cultivated valley (6,800 ') known as Zamanak or Dast’ali, belonging to the Qand’ali tribe of the Bakhtiari. On the left bank of the “ other ” stream is seen another severe rift, the Tang-i-Kufia, through which bends a small stream allow ing room for a mule track leading from the Duab valley over the Gardan Gil-i-Surkh close to a very red-looking hill top to Birgun and onwards. Through the rift is seen a cultivated upland valley, Mish Mal-i-Kuh. Another cultivated habitation high up the Kuh-i-Qaisru is known as Asbauar. The track continues up the right bank of the Duab to its source, which is at the foot of the pass over the Chari range ; but this track is stony, and is only used by those wishing to proceed to the cultivated plots and tree plantations in this long valley (near the water’s edge) known as Diz Darun, in the centre of which, out of the foot of the still snow-clad Kuh-i-Milli (or Isbiana) gushes another magnificent stream. The through route (that taken to the Gardan-i-Chari and Bazuft) fords the stream Duab at the 8th mile, and leads up a spur (the Gandava) from the Chari range, and, hugging it for 3 miles, re-crosses the Duab near its source at the 11th mile. The banks here are green, and with trees form an acceptable camping ground known as Chari. The ascent of the main pass commences a few yards off. In this basin are the ruins of an old village.

The soil is of a rich red clay. Two small streams are crossed, the second just above a waterfall, both running S.-E .; water good. Track lies along a high ridge for some dis tance and then follows the course of a small stream and passes through a deep ravine. A large stream is then crossed 20 to 30 yards broad, flowing south-east. This is the worst part of the road as some of the descents into the stream are very steep. Steps are very deep, otherwise the stage is an easy one for mules. Sar-i-Dasht is on the river Dunuban, the bed of which is 40 to 50 yards broad with high perpendicular banks. Current not very swift. Population about 40 to 60 people. Huts principally of mud and stone with thatched roofs. There are two forts here—one in fairly good repair the other in complete ruins, surrounded by numerous mounds ; there are also the remains of an ancient reservoir and a beautiful level piece of ground with goal posts of stone at either end.

The road is a well-defined one, rising by gradual gradients up the side of the Munar mountain which in parts is perpendicular, to where it crosses the crest, at 4 m. The roadway has been built with some care originally, as is shown by the way the stones are placed, but by the traffic of ages they have become very slippery, and some have become displaced through neglect and by the action of torrents of rain. The road is, however, quite good enough to ride the whole way up to the crest ( 5 , 800 ')• The road now descends the N.-E. slope by easy gradients, but is very rough.’ Side of hill thickly wooded with oak. After marching for 2f hours a nlain is reached, on which are some llidt encampments, and long lines of stone walls are passed, evidently used formerly as lines for defence. This is said to be one of the battle-fields of the celebrated Bakhtiari Chief, Muhammad Taqi. A descent is-- now made into a narrow valley and the course of a stream is followed through a narrow mountain gorge, numerous springs of beautiful cold water _ being passed on the left; thence a sharp turn is made to the right, along a very attractive and fertile valley about half a mile broad. Another sharp turn is then made to the left (north) and track passes through some small hills into the large picturesque and fertile valley of Shimbar. Supplies.—None.

Notwith standing broken nature of country, which consists of rows and rows or tiers of^hum- mocky hills, there is considerable cultivation. The soil is qf a rich red colour. The ground now falls towards N.-W., as the valley of the Ab-i-Diz, distant some 6 or 7 miles, is approached. At 5f m. cross a stream running north-west; water, good.

From Duma Kail a guide from the lliats encamped there is absolutely neces sary, as the road or track now becomes a mere goat path, often almost invisible where it passes through long grass and patches of cultivation with corn or barley just ready to be cut. Ground very much broken up by ravines. Soil is a rich red clay. A little further on track leads over a spur of the Sikeria mountain at a height of 2,600', and descends into the head of a small valley and across a stream ; and thence ascending again up another spur becomes very stony and rough. Supplies.—None. Water.—Good and plentiful; June, July, August, and September scarce. Forage.—At times the grazing is excellent although the ground traversed is rocky, stony, and broken. Nurabad .. 12£ 37 Passes over the N.-E. spur of the Sikeria mountain, the bearing of gen. dir. being E., across the valley between the two mountain ranges of Sikeria and Lungar. The descent into the valley is difficult as it is over large boulders of conglomerate rock and loose stones. The gradients are not very steep, excepting where the track des cends to cross the beds of several streams, which could easily be bridged over. Here and there a steep bit is met with. At about 7 m. the track is bad for nearly thirty minutes as it passes along the side of the hill, the surface of which is of flint stone and very slippery It is difficult to get loaded mules over this portion of the track. At about 8 miles an old fort called Barnisar, quite in ruins. A little further on the principal stream of the valley is crossed flowing N.-W. to fall into the Ab-i-Diz. The nature of the soil changes to gach (gypsum) and for an hour and a half ridges of gach are constantly crossed, During the last 2 m. the track lies over rich grassy undulating ground when the camping-ground of Nurabad is reached at the foot of the Lungar mountain. Supplies.—None. Water.—Good and plentiful, but reported to become scarce during months of July, August, and September. Fuel.—Plentiful. Forage.—The grazing is excellent up to the middle of June. 4 Pahraj, 4,250'. 9 46 Bearing of general direction is easterly. Track crosses some low hills near foot of the Lun gar mountain. Gradients of the track are not steep, but it is bad going as it is ovef large loose stones which makes it heavy for animals. Track now passes over hillside of slip pery sandstone rock, where mules come to grief. A little further on the track becomes fairly good, and descends to a river -bed down a steep spur of a hill of gach, slope of which fs 15°. Track goes along the riverbed, which is 150 to 200 yards broad with only 2 feet of water in the centre (height 2,900 feet), for about 4 miles, when it leaves river-bed and ascends up side of hill by steep gradients of 8° to' 12° to 4,300 feet, and then descends into a•' Route No. 7^-contd. valley where the remains of numerous Ilidt camps are found ,* this spot is called Pahraj. Country very mountainous, woody, and very stony. The whole distance from Nurabad to Pahraj would require to be considerably improved by a Pioneer battalion before any large transport could be sent up, as with only ten mules great difficulty was experienced in getting them over the difficult portion of the track. Supplies.—None. Water.— Good supply from small stream near camping-ground. Fuel.—Plentiful, mostly oak trees. Forage.—Grazing excellent. Ground only fit for infantry and mule batteries. 6 Chalun 12 58 Bearing of general direction of route north erly. Track very stony over some small hills and down a steep pass of dry water-course 35° slope, into a deep ravine, then ascends up the side of the Chalun mountain, also up a dry water-course 15° slope, but more difficult as the boulders are larger, ramps would have to be. built to get animals over these huge masses of rock. After leaving the top of the water-cours'e continue up a zigzag path, the general gradient of which is about 5°, passing at the same time through a thick forest of Stunted oaks. The soil here is a rich, red clay. About 2J miles further the forest ceases, and the ascent becomes very steep again, having a slope of about 20°. Ground surface of grey sandstone rock, which is very slippery and difficult even for men. At about 10 miles the first water is met with, since leaving Pahraj, in a spring on the lef-t hand of the track. Surface of the ground is of white sandstone rock, very difficult to walk or ride over. Bear ing of general direction of track now changes to easterly and descends to the head of a nar row valley, thickly wooded with oak, by a zigzag path, gradients of which are 5° to 6°, and then follows the general course of a stream flowing easterly, which is crossed and recrossed several times, until the Illdt camping-ground of Chalun is reached. Supplies.—None. Water.—Plentiful and good from stream. Fuel.—Plenty of oak and other trees. Forage. —Grazing excellent.

Track now descends into a deep narrow valley. Slope of hill 25° ; the gradients of track about 8°. Descent difficult as the surface of the ground consists of grey sandstone rock, which is very slippery. After crossing a stream (3,450 feet) in middle of valley track ascends the other side, very bad. Track bad along very precipitous slopes, descends again slightly. Camp on a small open spot near a spring, which is called Nuqdar, on an Illdt encamping-ground. No supplies. Water from several springs. Fuel.—Good supply. Oak and other trees. Forage.— Grazing not very good as ground very rocky. 8 Pul-i-Kul .. 6 78 l Bearing of general direction of route north erly. Track very rough across several deep ravines for first hour when it passes along the precipitous sides of numerous detach ed hills, where one mule slipped and rolled nearly two hundred feet and was with difficulty recovered, and eventually descends by steep gradients of 9° to the bank of the Ab-i-Diz. Camp about J mile from two broken bridges. No supplies. Water.—From river. Fuel— very scarce. Forage.—Grazing in June very poor. About 2 companies only of Infantry with 2 mountain guns could encamp near river bank. Best camping-ground for a larger force would be near the route about half way from Nuqdar. Ab-i-Diz here 100 yards broad and very rapid. A few minutes’ walk brings us into the gorge through which the river Ab-i-Diz rushes at the rate of about 10 miles an hour. The path lies along the edge of the water on slippery slate stone rock, sometimes scarcely broad enough for a man to get a foot hold.

From this stream the track rises over a spur from the main range, and then descends into a long narrow valley, the Lah Gunj avail, containing a small stream of the same name running over bright blood-red porphyry stones. Another spur is reached at the 7th mile, from which the whole of the Shamsirl valley (2 miles by 3) is overlooked. The stream of that name passes through it, and tho Tang-i-Kufia into the Diiab.

The track leading into the Zarin valley is taken, and turning still to the right, going nearly east, enters the valley at the 10th mile. This is a flat and rich looking valley, bordered on the north by low-lying mud hills, at the foot of which winds a shallow stream, 20 feet wide, among reed beds and meadow banks. The valley is crossed and camp made at 8,200'. At the 11m. main track to Mijdav is left, which for many miles is seen running parallel to and at the foot of the Zarra i range. (This valley is inhabited by the Baidarwand and Galla tribes. A very low col separates it from the Tap-i-Chiraghun valley, which is the last of the Illdt valleys.)

It forms one of the sources of the Zindeh Rud, which it joins before entering the Tang-i-GazI. Track follows valley to join here (at 6th mile) ; then fords across the Zindeh Rud, SO' wide. The main track through the Tang-i-Gazi is here struck and followed along the left bank, or N. side, to its S. mouth for 3 m. The tang is a wide gorge and separates the Gurgunaki range from the Zanga range. The ends of this range forming the tang on either si le have sloping spurs over which, about 300' above the river bed, goes the main track on the left bank. The peaks are about 1,000' above the road, and fully command the entrances and approaches. The Zindeh Rud on emerging from the tang leaves the Bakhtiari country of mud hills, separates at first Faraidan from Chehar Mahal, and then slowly winds its way through lower Mahallat towards Isfahan.

For, though hot, the neighbourhood affords excellent grazing all the summer through. From the Gardan-i- Gurgunaki moved along an excellent track due south for two hours, about 6 m. Half-way crossed the Gurba valley and stream, 7,550'; then followed up the Zindeh Rud valley, and camped near the Chashmeh-i-Dimch, one of the main sources of the Zindeh Rud. Close to the spring are the ruins of a square fort. From here a good track along the right bank of the stream, and a better on the left, leads up the Gurba va'ley to the Gardan-i-Bard-i-Mlr Jamal, 15 m. The rise to 9,880 feet is imperceptible except for the last two miles, when it is noticeable but easy. The col is flat for | m. with a good camping-ground and water. It is commanded by peaks on either side which rise to 12,000'. The valley passed through is a large, wide grazing ground, treeless, but with many springs and rivulets. From here an excellent track over low mud hills crosses the Ab-i-Chamandar, and enters the Shurab valley skirting its western edge, moves up a ravine parallel to the Karun range and over a col, Chelgird, 8,750 feet, into the Karun upper valley. Just before entering the ravine leaning to ihe col is the Imamzadch Agha-i-Sabib. From here a road runs over the Gil-i-Shah Lerdakus pass. Track good to entrance of tang, 8,300', crossing2streamsen route, distances m. From the entrance to the tang the path is stony for mile. Then struck snow, and a very easy zigzag ascent for 2 m. to the top. Elev. 11,300'. Pass at this time, June, quite feasible for pack animals and in great request by the Ilidt. The southern descent is also easy by zigzags, though the abruptness of the slope of the hill, a sheer drop of 3,000', makes it look im posing. At the foot of the pass is a camping place with trees and water, whence the road to Shushtar via Chilau can be seen. Ascend by the Gardan or Gal-i-Gav (the cow pass) by an excellent mule track up the stream coming from the Kuh-i-Rang. After 1| miles enter the spurs of this mountain at a prettily watered spot with flour mills called Safir Dlwa, an excellent camping ground. Another such long open space, affording a good camping ground, is passed at the 3rd or 4th mile, by name Chaman Shaikh ’All Khan, having a good spring known as Chashmeh-i-Gulchin. After this, rise gradually over the Kuh-i-Rang spurs as they spread to the south. At the 7th mile enter a valley, where the main track from the Pambakal Pass, now in full view, joins. At the 8th mile, after crossing another spur, descend into the Lah Zard (green valley), 9,200' with nice encamping space and plenty of water. This was once a fertile spot judging from the long aqueducts cut into the side of the large spurs. At the 9th mile another space known as Agha Murad (9,500'). At the 10th mile the track leads over another high spur (9,800 feet) and then descends into an open valley Juh-i-Jar, well dotted over by Ilidt encampments. The track now rises perceptibly, though never without being easy, stoneless, and excellent in dry weather, for 3| more miles to the col known as Gardan (or Gal-i-Gav) at an altitude 10,150'. Fodder scarce ; fuel and water plentiful. 7 Gardan (or Gal- 131 78 i-Gav). 8 Chilhash 10 88 Track leads down the valley to W. It ia an excellent mule track, passing over the cross spurs of the large spur from head of the Kuh-i-Rang. At 4 miles, a steepish but quite good enough path, leads into the valley of the Chilhash, which torrent, coming K 276 Route No. 9— contd. 9 Chashmeh 12 100 SlRDUM 7,000'. from the Kuh-i-Rang, is reached at the 6th mile (7,800'). Two miles further down the stream from this point is the Imamzadeh and village of Pir Sar Shahid,* prettily situated in a niche of the Kuh Rita, 40 houses, terraced on the hill side. This village is on the main track to the garmslrs round Dizful. From here take the main track used by the Illdts passing along the crest of the Rita hill, 8,500'. Leaving the hamlet of Birigun in a deep valley on the left at the 8th mile, reach camp at the foot of the large spur from the Kuh-i-Rang, and on the stream Chilhash, at the 10th mile. No supplies, but an Ilidt encampment close by. Track ascends the col to camp known as the Birigun kutal, and then descends into a long ravine with torrent for 3J m. by zigzag road to where another ravine wi* h torrent is joined at a place replete with trees, affording grateful dark shade from overhanging rock, and waterfall known as feirpul (6,800 ): ^ m. further the thickly wooded Warreh Rasia from the Kuh-i-Rang is entered, and the track taken up the valley on either side of a rushing stream for 3 m. to another camping ground (7,500') at the foot of the ascent to come. This ascent over the mighty spur from the Gantak peak of the Kuh-i-Rang is steep in parts, but is an excellent mule track, and offers no difficulties to riding on horse back the whole way. Though only half a mile in horizontal projection, the ascent took half an hour, and the top registered 9,200'. The descent is less steep, and the track passes over several minor spurs from the main spur, the intervening ravines having springs of excellent water at the 12th mile. After 5 hours’ march, camp was found in one of the lesser ravines, where excellent fodder, water, and fuel were at hand. Continue along fhe main track over the main portion of the Gantak spur. One and a half hours’ climb to top of pass which is 9,680'. The track has two rocky bits requiring a little care to pick out a path, but is otherwise an excellent mule track. Steep in parts, but stoneless. Descent into the Gaukun valley steep also, and the lower portion has a bad bit of rock for about 50 yards, which was, however, negotiated by horses and fully laden mules without difficulty. Track continues down stream for a short way, and ascends a slippery piece of chalk hill side. On reaching the top, main track bifurcates, one to north-east up a kutal to the Gurganaki range, thence to Kalasur, the other goes down the valley to the Pul-i-Gaukun, and then ascends the col between the Fardun and the Shahan hill tops. Camp at m. from the bridge. The Gaukun stream flows at right angles to all the large Kuh-i-Rang spurs, and at this place has somewhat receding cultivated banks for 2 miles. This open space is known as Gaukun. The stream enters this space through a narrow Tang, and leaves it two miles further down through another narrow one, with perpendi cular sides up to 2,000 feet high. 10 Pxjl-i-Gaukun, 10 110 6,800'.

Up the valley between the Shahan and Eardun ranges. The track ascends a spur of the Shahan, which is separated from the Fardun hill by a narrow deep gorge,through which flows the Kamarun stream into the Gaukun. At 1| miles the col of this spur is reached, and a slight descent is made into a fertile, well watered upland valley, 5 miles long, having the hamlet of Kamarun on a streamlet prettily situated about half-way. At the 7th mile from the Gaukun a col is reached (Gardan-i-Kamaran). Here camp was made. A capital mule track, stoneless, and, still within a few feet of the top, over smooth spurs well covered with vegetation, enables the Shahan peak to be reached with ease riding on horseback. The central peak is 12,900 feet, a few feet higher than the Kuh-i-Rang, and from it the two highest peaks of the Zarda Kuh are estimated as between 13,000 and 14,000 feet; the last named figure is certainly not reached. Gen. dir. N.-W. Continue down the Mugui valley westwards, known as the Pashandagan or Samistan valley from two hamlets of that name situated in it. At the 3rd mile from the col a streamlet is struck which flows through a narrow but highly cultivated valley with both banks enshrouded in bushes ; the path follows it down for 5 miles, when another stream is crossed, flowing from the Shahan range through the higher valley and hamlet of Samistan. At the 9th mile the hamlet of Pashandagan is reached. Hence the stream takes a more southerly course, hemmed in by precipitous banks. From here, passing through the hamlet of Samistan, a mule track leads over the high range by the Chukashan pass into the Faraidan lowlands beyond. The main track now leaves the valley and hamlet of Pashandagan (7,700 feet) and at once ascends a spur by a zigzag smooth path for a height of 1,500 feet. From a knoll close to this col (9,200 feet) a good view is had of the country to the south. Hence the track passes the hamlet and cultivated area of Home, and, after going over another spur from the main range, descends into the Masir Mugui valley. Village of Masir surrounded with cultivation, near a stream. 12 Masir Mugui- 12 129 8,100'. 13 Guv ah, 6,500' .. 12 141 Gen. dir. N.-W. Track up the valley along a stream, till a col is reached at the 3rd mile showing 8,800'. Hence the track descends into another straight valley closely hemmed in on the south by a range sharply faced, and to the W. by the well-cultivated spurs of the Miligun range, the continuation in the same alignment of the Shahun range. Following an excellent track, passing now through corn-fields, now along the bank of a stream shaded by pollard and elm, the village of Tursa is passed at the 5th mile, that of Sarkala at the 6th, Dehnau on the left bank at the 8th, and the village and cross valley of Guvah at the 12th mile. Guvah Tang is impassable for mules, but a foot-path exists. The tang and the valley about here are thickly wooded. Stream 6,400 feet. 14 Kaleh Huma. . 13 154 Gen. dir. N.-N.-E. The track after cross ing the stream by a wooden bridge at once ascends, steeply but easily, for 1,800'. The main track goes on in the same general direction to the Zangl country, but a good road leads off to Kaleh Huma about 2 miles further on. The shorter mule track was taken leading over the range. The track is an excellent, easy zigzag, for 1,400'. The kutal and a peak close to it (9,650') afford a full view of the surrounding country. The track descends easily for 800' and then moves along the foot of the range, leading over a low spur at 9th mile (8,400'), and then makes straight for Kaleh Huma across the plain. At the 10th mile the village Racha, and at the 11th the village Hava, conspicuous on a slight elevation, are passed, and at the 12th mile a stream is forded, and the ascent made to Kaleh Huma. Kaleh Huma is the capital of the Mugui78 Route No. 9— contd. tribe. The Kaleh is a mud caravanserai surrounded by mud and stone houses. It is situated at the foot of a large spur from the Talanda hill, and is visible from all parts of the open valley. Numerous springs in the neighbourhood and good grazing Armenian villages scattered about here. 15 MakhadI .. 8 162 From Huma are two good tracks, one a few miles shorter over a col; the other following the water-course through a tang in a chain of low hills. The latter track chosen. An excellent dry weather one over stoneless mud spurs. At 3 miles passed the remains of a village burnt down in a raid. At the 5th mile the Ivaz Tang (6,900' feet ) is entered, and the track changes to the left bank of the stream (the Ab-i-Garmak). The defile,^about 100 yards broad and bounded by steep mud hills (400 feet to 500 feet), is 2 miles long. At the southern end, on a conspicuous crag, the abrupt end of a spur, are the remains of a castle or stone building of ancient date known as Kaleh-i- Dukhtar. It is in a commanding position, and in former days might have been made impregnable. At its foot, 800 feet below, runs the stream, here joined by another water-course from the west named Darreh Shikaft. These two streams make the Vanavl for a few miles, which when joined by the Ab-i-Sa f id, 2 miles low'er down, becomes the Kakuhstan, and when joined by the Gaukun and Gava at Baznawl, the Ab-i-Diz. The track now descends into the Makhadi (7,600 feet) valley, the first ZalakI posses sion encountered. Makhadi, 8 miles from Huma, is a small village prettily situated near a spring possessing an ancient imamzadeh, and surrounded by waving cornfields. From here there is an excellent track to Baznawi and the winter residence and capital of the ZalakI tribe. Distance 10 miles, 5,000 feet. From Makhadi a track to Sang- ala descends more than a thousand feet to the bed of the Kakulistan (6,300'), which stream, has cut for itself a channel through mud hills and rocky ranges regardless of natural formations, and forms an important physical feature of this country. Owing to the low altitude of its bed and immediate vicinity, and its narrow defiles here and there, it is discarded as a habitat, and possesses no track along its course. The high flat, broad, mud spurs alongside form the cultivable portions on which the Ilidts from neighbouring villages reside. After crossing to the right bank the track to Sang Kala moves up a high spur at once, and makes for a col on the Kala Kuh range. 16 ‘Arjanak 7,100'. 14 176 (approx. imate). The Isavand summer head-quarters. A clump of stone and mud shanties, exceed ingly poor, situated at the foot of an abrupt cliff and surrounded by groups of . . , . , , trees. The Biz consists of half-a-dozen Bemi-artificial caves with breast-high loopholed rubble walls. One cave contains a peren nial spring. Close above Arjanak is a small lake 100 yards by 50. From here there is a good path up a ravine, to the Gal-i-Badush, which soon as. cends into one of the large spurs of the Kala Kuh. After 12 miles along a good horse and mule track the Gal-i-Badush is reached. Camp at spring about 300 feet below the col. Follow the main valley, up for 10 miles : along an excellent track.

The track moves up the Zal-i-Ab for 3 miles, and then ascends for one mile to a low kutal (6,700 feet), the watershed between the Ab-i-Burujird and the Khurramabad basin. Thence it descends gently for 2| miles to the village and imdmzddeh of Mamil. One mile from the last kutal a fine clump of chindrs, the only trees seen in the valley, and a good spring, are passed. 24 Khttrramabad, 22J 272 4,200'. Follow the new excellent track to Khurram abad, 22£ miles down the valley, the stream of which is the head waters of the Azna stream ; at 3 miles from Mamil this changes direction at right angles to the south through a tang 3 miles long. On emerging from this tang the track becomes almost a cart road and leads straight north-west ; 4 miles further a low watershed is passed, and a small valley descended, in which at 7 miles further, the Rahband stream is crossed, and the high road from Burujird struck.

Crops (barley) plentiful on both sides of road (May 10th). Temperature in shade 103°. Country undulating ; no steep ascents or descents. After leaving Siah Mansur there are three tracks, the middle one must be taken. Water is plentiful in the vicinity of the road for 7 or 8 miles. Immediately before reaching Sar-i-BIsheh there is a river-bed to cross, stony bottom, about 50 yards wide. At time of crossing there w r as a shallow practically stagnant stream about 5 yards broad. Water in it very brackish. Sar-i- Bisheh a small village of about 30 houses with a mixed population of Persians and Arabs. Supplies obtainable in small quantities. About 300 or 400 sheep and cattle seen. Water fit for drinking obtainable from one spring only. Fuel scarce. Fair grazing.81 Route No. iO~contd. Gotwand, 475'. 13 28 Cham-i-Nuqreh, 15 43 751. General direction south-east. Eoad good the whole way over slightly undulating ground. With very little preparation would be suit able for all kinds of transport. Extensive crops and grazing both sides of the road nearly the whole way, mostly wheat and barley. Ab Bid is a small village of only about 10 houses, no provisions to speak of. Gotwand about 200 houses. Supplies at this time (May 11th) practically m7, new crop beginning of July, supplies then plentiful; 2,000 to 3,000 sheep and cattle. Water good and plentiful from several wells ; also river Karun affords excellent drinking water. Fuel in fair quantity only. Good camping accommodation to the west of the village on the bank of the river Karun. General direction practically east. Road enters directly into mountains and thence out into a small valley. At about 4 miles the track becomes bad and rocky, and animals can only move in single file ; slopes of ascent and descent up to 14|° but no long ones. Passable only by mule and donkey transport. Grazing fairly plentiful. Fuel plentiful all the way from dried and rotten trees. Cham-i-Nuqreh is the name given to a small camping ground on the bank of the river Karun. No village. No supplies. Water excellent from river Karun. No cultivation ; good rough grazing in the vicinity. General direction north-east. Track is some what indistinct, and winding and narrow as far as Gach-i-Lali, about 5 miles distant, where there is a small camping ground, but no supplies. Here the Ab-i-ZIvaru, a small tributary of the river Kaiun is crossed. Water in it is very brackish. From this point the road leaves river Karun and winds over very hilly ground ; the track however, is quite distinct and affords no difficulties, gradients up to 111°. Stray small patches of cultivation passed, but the country for the most part is bare. At about 1C J miles arrive at Chaman Zivaru a large very fertile plateau, highly cultivated, about 3 miles diameter. Crops barley and wheat. A few isolated black tents, very few inhabitants. At a point about 14J miles there is a \ery good spring affording plentiful and excellent drinking water. This is the oqly water found since leaving the river, Karun. Sar-i-Baraka, a small camping ground on the Ab-i-Shur, about 10 to 15 black tents, seen in the vicinity. Water in the Ab-i-Shur brackish, all drinking water had to be brought from the hills on the northern side of the Ab-i-Shur. Fuel plentiful on the road as in the previous march. Fair grazing. No supplies. A very few cattle and sheep seen. This stage passable by mule and donkey transport only. Sar-i-Baraka, 16 59 1,050.' Dar-i-Shah , OR Sar-i-Shah, 1,400'. 10 69 General direction east.

Chulbar 3 81 1,600' On the opposite bank is an old tomb near which are a few black tents. No supplies. Fuel plentiful. Water excellent and abundant from the Ab-i-Baba Ahmad. This stage pass able by mule and donkey transport only. General direction north-east. This stage ab- splutely impassable for anything except cooly transport; the track runs along the rocks directly above the Ab-i-Baba Ahmad, very slippery end narrow; mules, must proceed in single defile and are unable to turn. At 2 miles baggage has to be unloaded and carried by men over the pass of Baba Ahmad and down the other side to the camping ground of Chulbar. Mules can only with great difficulty be driven over empty. The Tang-i-Baba Ahmad 1,800 feet, gradient of ascent both sides 25°. Narrowest part of the pass 3 yards. Chulbar is a small camping ground ; water plentiful from the river of Baba Ahmad, affording excellent drinking water. There is a small mill about 50 yards to the east of the camping ground where a very small quantity of coarse flour is obtainable. No sup plies. Grazing not abundant. Fuel plentiful. This stage, though only 3 miles, took Lieutenant Williams 12 hours and 40 minutes to accomplish. 8 Chal-i-Minab, 3,950’. 20 101 General direction north-east. First 2J miles track good, then it passes over dry stony beds of water courses for at least 3 miles, then narrows and winds considerably till coming out into Ha’id-i-Nau, where there is a small camping ground. There is usually a good spring here, but in summer of 1908 was yielding very little water ; this is the only water met with during this stage. From Haud-i-Nau the track becomes very difficult, as one commences a steep steady climb of over 3,000 feet to the Kuh-i-Minoreh and thence direct down to Chal-i-Minar. The track up to the Kuh-i-Minoreh is very rocky, and in places appears almost impassable, causing many delays. During this stage only a few isolated patches of cultivation are seen. Grazing fair as far as Haud-i-Nau, but after that none. Chal-i-Minar is a fairly large camping space. Water excellent and abundant from three springs. Fuel very plentiful; grazing good in the vicinity and fairly plentiful. Only three tents seen here. No supplies. This stage passable by mule and donkey transport only. Baba Zaid, 3,500’ 14 115 General direction practically north to the Kuh-i- Kaineh, thence south-east. A well defined track with a continuous descent to the Shimbar valleys, consisting of two very fertile valleys adjoining one another, watered by three fast running streams origina ting close at hand from three large springs of excellent drinking water. Extensive cultivation of wheat and barley exist in these valleys, and good grazing. On passing out of the second valley a steady steep climb commences and the track becomes very indis tinct and difficult up to the pass of the Kuh-i-Kaineh. At one part mules and baggage have literally to bo lifted across, and much damage is likely to result to both. There is no sign of there ever having been a respectable roadway here. From the pass the track bends sharp to south-east; it becomes easier and descends gradually through a small valley to Baba Zaid. From the pass an encampment of about 20 tents was seen in Shimbar—the only sign of habitation. Baba Zaid is a very small camping ground. No supplies, grazing scarce. Fuel practically nil. Water from one small spring. A place to be avoided for camping. This stage passable by mule and donkey transport only.83 Route No, 10—contd. of 28f to Hazar Cham. 10 Mauri, .. 14 129 General direction south-east. For first 5 miles the track is easy and well defined over un dulating ground. Crops are abundant in the vicinity of Chilau. No signs of any villages, but a few isolated black tents were seen near Chilau. After 5 miles the track becomes difficult and a steep rocky climb up to Taraz. On passing the crest of Taraz (5,750' ), the track turns sharp.north for | mile, then again south-east. Here it again becomes difficult and winding for about a mile. Thence a continual steep descent to the valley of Mauri. Here there is a large camping ground. Cultivation scarce. Grazing good but not in any large quantity. About 20 people (natives) were encamped here, but not per manently. A few stone huts on the hill-side to the north of the camping ground. No supplies except a little coarse flour. Water good and plentiful from a stream near at hand originating from a large spring in the hills to the north of the valley. Fuel plentiful. This stage passable by mule and donkey transport only. 11 PahnatIt, 10 139 General direction south-east. For about 5 miles the track is good over undulating country till reaching the end of the valley, thence a sharp turn north and a steep ascent The track becomes exceedingly difficult, easy to miss and almost impassable for any transport. The pass of Hazar Cham is just broad enough to allow of the passage offime loaded mule at a time. Thence to PahnatIt the path is good but very winding. Pahnatit is a very small camping-ground. No supplies ; grazing •carce. Fuel plentiful, country here is thickly wooded. No tents or encampments •een. This stage, passable by mule and donkey transport only. • General direction south-east. A short steep climb to a pass called Champaz (6,100'), thence descend into a very fertile valley, richly cultivated, crops mostly rice, barley and wheat. At the end of this valley the road takes a sharp turn to the north across an extensive maiddn in the centre of which is a ruined fort (Kaleh Bazuft). Thence across the Ab-i-Bazuft about 20 yards of water, 2|- feet at deepest part, stony bottom ; no serious obstacle. Thence again the track winds in a south-east direction above the Ab-i-Bazuft which is in sight the whole way to Mawaz. A small tributary of this river has to be crossed at a point about 10 miles. The track the whole way is good and well- defined. Mawaz is a large camping-ground, few stone huts here and black tents. Large water-works. Extensive cultivation seen down by the Ab-i-Bazuft. A minor Bakhtiari chief, ’Abdullah Khan, here takes a small toll on each mule of a caravan, apparently unlawfully. No supplies obtainable. Water abundant and good. Fuel and grazing ecarce. This stage only passable by animal transport. Inhabitants in this place of the Qand’ali tribe. 13 Chabi, 5 157 General direction east. Three large successive hills to climb, track very ill-defined ; rocky and steep, average ascent 22°. Some mules may be expected to be overcome from exhaustion and unable to proceed. Chari is a small camping ground on top of the third ridge. Few inhabitants in tents. About 200 head of sheep and cattle were seen. Water only from snow (May 23rd). No supplies. No fuel. Grazing scarce. This stage can only de done by mules and donkeys. General direction north-east. A sharp climb of about 3 miles to the pass of Zarda Kuh (9,000'), which was under snow. Thence down through undulating country and a final de C3ni of 17° into a rich fertdo valley (7,000 / ) where crops and grazing are plentiful. Thence up again through hilly country to Sham-i-Ser (8,400'), and from there down into the Birgu i L 2 12 Mawaz, 13 152 4,650'.

The track for the most part presents no difficulties, with the exception of abou t half mile after passing the Zarda Kuh, being very slippery from the melting snow, also from Sham-i-Ser to the Birgan valley, the going is very stony and rough. Birgun is a rich fertile valley watered by the Ab-i-Morbar; crops and grazing plentiful. Fuel scarce ; grain obtainable only for tw &gt; or three animals. About 800 sheep and cattle seen. Practically no provisions. About 50 black tents inhabited by the MunjazI tribe. This stage passable by mule and donkey transport only. General direction north-east. For the first 3 miles the track runs north across the Birgun valley until it reaches the Ab-i Morbar, which in May was a raging torrent, 30 yards across, 31 feet at deepest part, and running at 10^ miles an hour. The water was so cold that the men could hardly endure it. It took 35 minutes to get 50 mules across. Thence direction north-west for about 8 miles, no difficulties. Thence north to Gil-i-Kishkak winding through low hills. The track during this stage is for the most part good and passable by all animal transport.

A small ridge to cross, thence the path enters the very fertile Shurab valley, where crops and good grazing exist, watered by a small river running north-west; this furnishes excellent drinking water, and is no serious obstacle. In this valley about 200 inhabitants were encamped in black tents apparently of the Ulurwand Lurs. Thence enter low hills again through the Tang-i-Purk and out into a large valley about 2 J miles long ; no cultivation, but fair grazing. At the end of this valley the Ab-i Gazi is crossed, a stream about 20 yards wide and 2£ feet deep, with stony bottom. No serious obstacle. Thence the pathway again enters the hills through the Tang-i-Gazi and winds about 100 feet above the cleft at the bottom of which runs the Ab- i-Gazi, which runs to Isfahan eventually . On emerging from the Tang-i-Gazi a huge valley is entered which also takes the name of Gazi. This is an exceedingly fertile valley, well-cultivated and covered with most superb green grazing, about 2 feet high, almost resembling corn. Apparently this valley is renowned for its grazing. Several encamp ments seen on the neighbouring hills. No supplies ; fuel very scarce. Water excellent from the Ab-i-Gazi. The pathway in this stage is good and well-defined and there are no serious obstacles. Passable by all animal transport. General direction a little east of north. Track good and level as far as Kaleh Shahrak. and the country up to here is lightly cul tivated, and grazing good and plentiful. At Chehil Chashmeh water abundant from the many springs that abound here and graz. ing good. At 7 miles Aurgun was the first village seen, since Gotwand. Thence many vil lages passed where supplies are obtainable in varying large quantities. At Shahrak the Isfahan river (here the Ab-i-Gazi) branches off east, and the track goes north through hilly country for about l£ miles ; thence out into slightly undulating country, richly cultivated, belonging to the several villages passed, which are for the most part inhabited by Armenians. Water is good and plentiful along the whole road from many springs, and the track is well-defined and good throughout this stage.

Before entering Askandaria a small stream (the Ab-i-Pahasun) must be crossed, but this is no # obstacle. Askandaria is inhabited by Muhammadans ; supplies obtainable. This is the first place after leaving Gotwand where grain is obtainable in considerable quantities. About 200 houses and 2,500 sheep and cattle; fuel fairly plentiful; country in the vicinity well-cultivated; water plentiful and good from the Ab-i-Pahasun.APPENDICES.

Lynch Brothers on the one side, and Isfandidr Khan, Sarddr As’ad Muhammad Husain Khan, Sipahddr, and Hdji 'AH Quli Khan on the other. Article 1. -Isfandiar Khan, Sardar As’ad, Muhammad Husain Khan Sipahdar, and Haji ’All Quli Khan having jointly obtained a Concession from the Imperial Persian Government, under date the 23rd April 1897, for the con struction and maintenance of a road with caravanserais from Ahwaz to Isfahan and from Shushtar to Isfahan, and having in virtue of Article 5 of the ri&lt;dit of calling in the aid of capitalists, Messrs.

Tne first interest and first instalment shall be paid at the end of the third year, counting from the aforementioned date. Subsequently the interest and instalments shall be paid at the end of each succeeding year, the interest being calculated on the balance of capital after deduction of instalments paid on account of capital.91 Payments of interest and instalments of capital to be made to Messrs. Lynch Brothers at Ahwaz. Article 3.—The concessionaires agree to intrust the whole work of adapting existing roads or tracks for caravans and of the formation of diversions and of construction, whether of bridges or of caravanserais, or in any way in con nection with the roads, to Messrs. Lynch Brothers who, on their part, agree to carry out the following works as soon as practicable after the signature of this agreement, namely, to place an iron bridge over the Karun at Gudar-i-Bal- utak, to build a bridge at Pul-i-’Amarat, to clear the present track of boulders wherever Messrs. Lynch Brothers deem it necessary or expedient, and to build caravanserais and temporary or other residences for engineers or work people at such points as they (Messrs. Lynch Brothers) may consider necessary for present exigencies. Messrs. Lynch Brothers agree to execute the works aforesaid for a sum not exceeding £5,500, and it is understood that the condi tions of the Concession granted to the concessionaires by the Persian Govern ment have been complied with when they have been executed. Should it be deemed expedient by the conces ionaires, Messrs. Lynch Brothers to spend more capital, as by converting, or adapting any road from a caravan into a cart- road, increasing the number of caravanserais, or in any other manner, Messrs. Lynch Brothers are to have the right to advance the capital and carry out the construction upon the terms as nearly as practicable as ihose hereinbefore agreed upon. All details of construction of bridges or caraianserais, or in connection with the road, shall be left to the discretion of Messrs. Lynch Brothers. The number, size and locality of the caravanserais shall also be left entirely to their option. Article 4.—-The concessionaires bind themselves always to keep the roads and bridges in good order, and whenever repairs are necessary to carry them out.

PREECE. May 23rd, 1898.101 THE BAKHTIARI KHlNS. 1909. Najaf Quia Khan, Samsam-us-Saltaneh. Born about 1846 A. D. Career.—Hbegi of Bakhtiari, 1903—1905. Ilkhani, Spring 1905. Deposed, December 1905. Re-instated, Mxy 1906. Deposed, April 1907. Re-instated, June 1907. In December 1908 he quarrelled with all the Khans and the Persian Government over the question of furnishing a contingent for the Shah’s ser vice m Tehran and marched off to the support of the citizens of Isfahan who had just expelled the Shah’s Governor and declared for Self-Government. The Samsam took over the charge of the town and the neighbouring country and later became Governor-General after the advance to Tehran had resulted in the deposition of the Shah in July 1909. . Character, ete —He is recognized as the * doyen ’ of the Khans. He belongs m manners and mind to a generation that has passed. He is violent in his pas sions, and generally speaking blunt in his manner, and though in no way above deception or bluffing is not skilled in the nicer forms of finesse. He is spoken of m the country as an old-fashioned Lur, only good for conducting military operations. Though less averse from fighting than are most of his juniors his skill as a Commander need not necessarily be considered as established beyond all question. He is a bye-word among the Lurs for stinginess, a quality that is pecu liarly distasteful to them in another. He is not particularly acute and is probably not infrequently fooled, or made a tool of, by his relations. His narrow-mindedness, and the violence of his feelings and his lack of re straint in expressing them, have laid him open to the charge of being a little mad. He is disliked by his brother, and loathed by the other family. He can, however, accommodate himself to the Sardar Muhtasham, and the an tipathy of his family frequently leads to this result. He is a sworn enemy of Shaikh Khaz’al over an old dispute of no consequence. HajI ’Ali Quia Khan.— Sardar As’ad (1905).— Born about 1853. Aged about 56 years. Career. —Ilkhani, December 1905. Deposed, May 1906. He was not a success as Ilkhani. Character, etc .—He is acknowledged by every one as being the clever one of the Khans. He has read considerably in Persian and Arabic, and pro fesses to read French, and he has acquired the tastes and manners of anothersociety by prolonged residence in Tehran. He is an inveterate intriguer, an indefatigable talker, and an irreclaimable opium smoker. The last quality somewhat disables him from active participation in public affairs, his share in which he resigns into the hands of his younger brother Haji Khasrau Khan. He finds it possible however, while representing himself as equitably arranging the disputes between his relations and restraining them from proceeding to extremities, always to secure the advantage to his own family, and his astuteness is held in much respect by all parties. The Sardar As’ad’s chief affinity is for the Haji Khasrau Khan. He has been to Europe once or twice, and after a residence there for more than 2 years, returned to Persia in April 1909, and a few months later headed the Bakhtiari movement on the capital, which resulted in the deposition of Shah Muhr.mmad ’AH. Haji Khasrau KhaH.— Aged about 51. Born about 1858. Bahadur-ud-Dauleh, then Salar ’Arfa, then Sardar-uz-Zafar, 1908. Career. —Hbegi, December 1905. Deposed, May 1906. Spent the latter half of 1908 in the service of the Shah in Tehran. He is nominally a close partisan of Haji ’All Quli Khan. Character, etc .—He is a man who wears his heart on his sleeve. He is quick in his passions, and easily misled, and so apt to commit himself in vio lent language. If hasty in temper, however, he is equally placable. He lacks the taste or talent for intrigue and is comparatively straightforward, in pleasing contrast to most of his confreres. It is probable that his intentions are really in the main good, but he lacks discretion and practical wisdom. Like the Samsam he is sometimes fooled by the others, and incited to take up a violent tone to suit their purposes. He is very open-handed, and so is popu lar, but as a result his affairs are always embarrassed. When alone he is susceptible to argument, and he has some better instincts. He is the one of the Khans for whom perhaps it is most possible to conceive a liking. He has been to Europe, but does not read or speak any European language. Yusuf Khan —Aged about 39. Born about 1870. Itizad-us-Sultan. Salar-ul-Hishmat, 1907. Has held no official position. Character, ete.—He is a libertine and an intriguer: he does not appear much openly in public affairs, and his machinations are therefore chiefly behind the scenes. He is in Europe at present. He has a small son whom he has entrusted to an English lady in Isfahan to bring up. He went to Europe in the end of 1907 and had not .returned up to February 1909. Lutf ’AlI Khan.—A ged about 68. Born about 1841.103 Shu j at-us-Sultan. Sardar Ashja’, 1908. Character, etc .—He is believed to be the senior member of this family. He has long cut himself off from immediate connection with his country, having entered the service of the present Shah when he was heir apparent. He formerly commanded the body-guard at Tabriz, and until recently held a similar position at Tehran. He was supposea to be in the confidence of his late Royal Master, and he frequently endeavoured to use his influence to promote the interests of his own family. Nasir Khan is his brother by the same mother, and these two usually work in combination. The combination is sometimes made to include Ghulam Husain Khan and Sultan Muhammad Khan, but the former’s readiness to give in to the Samsam frequently gives umbrage to his brothers, and results in his expulsion from their league. Lutf ’Ali Khan bears the reputation of being a good fighting man. He is the only one of the Khans of the two main families who take part in public affairs with whom the writer has no personal acquaintance. Mahmud Khan.—N ever appears in public affairs. Nasir Khan.- —Aged about 40. Born about 1869. Sarum-um-Mulk. Salar-i -Jang, 1908. Ilbegi, April to June 1907. Career .—Spent the latter half of 1908 in the late Shah’s service in the porth, and was in command of the Bakhtiari contingent before Tabriz. Usually in close sympathy with Lutf ’AH Khan. Character, ete.—He bears the reputation of being the pluckiest and most military of the Khans. He is a man of some force and determinaticn, but until recently has not come to the front except in a subordinate capacity. This is probably largely due to his being poorer in property thpn the Khans already mentioned, and hence having a direct hold on a proportionately small section of the population, while at the same time wanting in the prestige and power attaching to wealth. He is generally respected by the tribes men for his manly qualities. He appears to be straightforward and to be anxious to show himself obliging, but there are insufficient data on which to form an estimate of his moral character. GhulIm Husain Khan. —Bom about 1865. Shahab-us-Saltaneh. Sardar Muhtasham (1908). Ilbegi, Spring 1905. Deposed, December 1905. Hednstated, May 1906.Tlkhani, April 1907. Reverted to Ilbegi, June 1907. Character, etc .—This man’s character is more complex and less easy of ana lysis, but the key to it is perhaps that beneath an exterior deceptively strong and determined in appearance, he carries a faint heart. His lack of physical and moral courage has its complement in a decided absence of reliabi lity in his words and deeds. He was for long considered as a mainstay of the British-Bakhtiari friendship, but in recent years he has definitely forfeited this good opinion by the repeated breaking of the most solemn promises, and a line of conduct which has revealed an absolute absence of conscience and the domination of an unscrupulous lust of money. As he is lacking in any particular ability, and his brazen lies and patently false promises only draw attention to his tortuous trail, it is difficult to detect anything attractive in his character, and this difficulty is increased by the absence of the vivacity which in some of the other Khans to some extent distracts the attention. His false promises are as a rule in some measure inspired by purely mer cenary motives, but if ever made in good faith, which is doubtful, they are rendered abortive by his cowardice, which prevents his making good any promise that may be ungrateful to his colleagues. A man of this unattractive type of character has one advantage: he does not precipitate dangerous diplomatic situations by allowing himself to be car ried away by the feelings of the moment into the use of extravagant language and ill-considered action. He also exhibits no disconcerting embarrassment when his depravity stands revealed, and does not think it necessary to cover repudiation of his engagements by an outbreak of temper. He is therefore essentially a safe, if an unsatisfactory, man to have dealings with. Sultan Muhammad Khan.— Aged about 39. Born about 1870. Mu’in Humayun. Sardar Ashraf (1908). He is usually on working terms with Ghulam Husain Khan. Went to serve the Shah in Tehran in 1908. Character, etc. He is own brother to Ghulam Husain Khan, to whom he is junior. So far as observation goes, he would appear to share his brother’s defects, and his attitude is declared by the degree to which at the moment he feels that an attitude of friendship would serve his own affairs. He is consequently not to be relied on. It is only under unusual circumstances that he comes into prominence. ’Al! Ahbar Khan. —Aged about 30. Born about 1879. Saham-us-Saltaneh. Takes no part in public affairs. Character, etc .—-He is a young man without any other characteristics than those conferred by addiction to drink and women. As a force he is negligible.105 Muhammad Riza Khan. —Born about 1886. Mu’in Humayun, 1908. Character, etc .-—He is a pleasant young fellow, but without any particular force of character. Liquor is not so repulsive to him as it should be to a good Mussalman. Haji IbrahSm Khan, Zargham-us-Saltaneh. lives at Paradumba and is head of the family of the late Riza Quh Has had charge of the Faraidan District. He is said not to be a man of force of character. He joined the Samsam-us-Saltaneh when the latter assumed charge of Isfahan in the end of December 1908 or the beginning of January 1909. Other wise he is generally regarded by the other Khans as an outsider to be dis couraged, though marriages have taken place between the families. Fathullah Khan. Zargham-us-Saltaneh. Had charge of the Isfahan roads in summer 1908 and later was deputed to the charge of Faraidan. He is said to be a man of some strength of character. The Rising Generation. He is usually loyal to the interests of the Samsam-us-Saltaneh. Character, efc.—He is a pleasant young man and friendly to the Britisb He has, however, as yet gained no prominent place in the tribal councils, and appears to be deficient in vigour or force of character. Ja’far Quli Khan.—A ged about 27. Born about 1882. Bahadur-ud-Dauleh. Sardar Bahadur, 1908. He has spent same time in Tehran and in 1908 was with the other Khans in the Shah’s service. He appears to be a young man of some ability. Sultan ’Al! Khan.— -Aged about 26. Born about 1883. Shahab-us-Saltaneh, 1908. Was deputed by the Khans as their representative to exercise the Gover norship of Behbekan, but was not a success. A pleasant, well meaning youth, without conspicuous ability. Of the remainder of the rising generation none at present deserve Khan. Muhammad Jawad Khan.—A ged about 26. Born about 1883 Muntazzim-ud-Dauk h. special mention. D. R.
