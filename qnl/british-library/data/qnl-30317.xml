S.11030/30, dated the 14th Novemher^-934, from ^the nir Officer Conuuandins', Bagdad, with photographs,Jon the subject of a landing ground. This facility was not in the final list of air facilities required by the Royal Air Force (see correspondence ending with Residency minted Letter No.254 of 28th February 1934) so we are in no way committed to procuring it for them. 2 . i agree with the Air Officer Commanding that the landing ground would be a good thing in itseli, buo not at the price of raising any trouble thereto! which we have had enough in the past, especially as the place has been quiet since the conclusion of the Sur Show (described in Sir Hugh Biscoe's despatch No.180-3 of 29th March 1932). rlease approach the Sultan informally and without in any way pressing the scheme on him, and let me have his views and your own, Major C.K.U.Bremner,M.C., Political Agent, Muscat.Copy. D.0.No./S.11030/30. Air He adquarters, British Forces in ’Iraq, Hinaidi. 14th November, 1934. My dear Fowle, For some time I have been thinking that it would be an excellent thing, both from your point of view and that of the Royal Air Force, if we could have a landing ground at 3UR. 1 feel sure that if we could send aircraft to SUR occasionally it would not only enable the political Agent Muscat to visit the place and so keep in touch with the locals, but also the presence of a landing ground and visits by Royal Air Force aircraft should have a stabilising influence on the people there and add to their security generally. 2. I instructed the pilot of the flying boat which carried out the last Gulf cruise in October to examine the vicinity of SUR from the air for possible^sites and to take photographs, and I enclose herewith his report and copies of photographs taken. 3. Fpr the reasons outlined above 1 feel that if we do arrange for a landing ground it should be within easy access of the town, and should also require the minimum amount of work to prepare and maintain. Site No.2, described in the attached report, seems to comply admirably with.all_ requirements, the only likely objection beiijg; the possibility of its being required for building purposes in the iuture. 4. I should greatly appreciate your views on the general question of the advisability of having a landing °round at SUR and also, if you agree, whether you will be able to negotiate for the acquisition of Site No.2 and its marking out. Yours sincerely, sd.C.3.Burnett.

In accordance with Air Headquarters signal A/178 dated 13th October 1934, a preliminary air reconnaissance for a suitable landing ground near SUR was carried out by flying boat K.2134 on 16th October x934. Three possible sites were observed, as follows: No.1 . This site is situated on the coast approximately three miles North-West of SITR (Lat.22^35* N.Long. 59*29'SO” E). The surface is sandy and as far as could be seen from the air, is fairly good although some levelling would be necessary. Approaches are clear of obstructions in all directions. Photographs are attached at “A' and 'B M . No.2, This site is situated at W. SUR (Lat.22*34' N. Long. 59° 32* E) and to all appearances woulci make an excellent *L' shaped landing ground, provided that its proximity to the town would not prevent permission bein^ obtain ed to use it. The surface is sand and appears very good although it may possibly be somewhat loose . approaches are clear of obstructions except for the houses of W.SUR. Photographs are attached at 'C' , 'D' and 'E'. No.3. This site is situated on the coast approximately four miles East-South East of SUR (Lat.22^ 33'30' N. Long.59* 37'E ). The surface appears better than that of No.1 above but there are some patches of camel thorn or similar growth and the dimensions are such that the landing area would be narrow in a North and South direction. . Approaches are clear of obstructions except for the plateau on the South side. Photographs are attached at 'F' and 'G'. 31.10.34 (Sgd.) K.F.T.Pickles.

(Bear Fowle,) In view of your demi-official letter No. C/194 of 2nd June 1935, 1 think that we can drop the proposal for a landing ground at SUR for the present. 2. I had originally thought that the existence of a landing ground there would help the Political Agent to visit the place quickly and easily, and that occasional visits by aircraft might have a salutary effect on the people. f If,however, this is not the opinion of BrenJker andyourself, I have no other strong reason to put forward, as we have, of course, a landing ground at RAS AL HADB which should provide us with the operational facilities we require in the area. 3. I still think, however, that it may be worth re-o.;en- ing the question of SUR later on, and shall be grateful if you will continue to bear it in mind.
