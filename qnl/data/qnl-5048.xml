This chronological ordering means that correspondence relating to specific manumission applications is scattered through the file, rather than grouped together by application. There are office notes at the end of the file (folios 310-347), whose arrangement mirrors the chronological order of the file correspondence.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 340; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio. An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled. A previous foliation sequence between ff 303-348, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The majority of the file is correspondence relating to about forty-eight manumission applications, most of which were made at the Political Agency at Bahrain. Some applications are made with the Residency Agent at Sharjah, and forwarded to the Agency at Bahrain for submission to the Political Resident in Bushire. Other applications involve Trucial Coast slaves applying for manumission at the Political Agency at Muscat. These applications were sent by the Muscat Agency to the Political Residency at Bushire, from where they were forwarded to the Political Agency at Bahrain for enquiries to be made at Sharjah.Aside from the manumission applications, the file also includes printed copies of the Proclamation of the Slave Trade Act (1873), distributed annually around the British offices of the Persian Gulf (folios 30-32, 215-217), and an Arabic copy of the Saudi Government's 1936 regulations regarding the slave trade (folio 178, with an English translation on folios 180-184).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Slave emancipation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Slave trade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000231#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000231#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000231#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
