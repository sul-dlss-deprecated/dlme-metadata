Mohsim Pasha is also said to have stated that the Turkish (jovernmeiTt had fixed 150 karas (a kara=about 1| tons) of dates as his yearly subsidy, and that five years' allowance at this rate would be ffiven him forth with.

This letter is in reply to a letter from me, asking him to ascertain how- far a report, which reached me, from Mr. Gaskin at Bahrein, in a confidential letter (extract from which is also forwarded herewith), was true. No. 90, dated Basrah, the 15th June 1900 (Confidential). From—H. S. Shipley , Esq., British Consulate, Basrah, To—C aptain C. A. Kemball , Acting British Consul-General for Fars and Khuzistan. In reply to your letter No. 158 of the 10th instant, I have the honour to inform you that, having made due inquiries into the matter, I have been unable to find any confirmation of the report current at Bahrein, that Seyed Ahmed, the brother of the Nakib at Basrah, had been ordered to Constanti nople in connection with Koweit affairs, or that the Nakib himself had been directed to proceed to that district to find out the true relations between Sheikh Mubarek and our Government. Seyed Ahmed is at present at Bas rah, and, so far as I know, has no intention of proceeding to Constantinople; all business relating to those Koweit affairs in which he is interested being transacted by him, by correspondence, with the well-known Sheikh Abdul Khuda of Yediz. Seyed Thalib, a younger brother of Seyed Ahmed, under took, it is true, a journey to Constantinople last autumn, but, as reported at the time by Mr. Consul Wratislaw, this was an exceptional step taken by the Nakib in consequence of the efforts (ultimately successful) which the latter was making in conjunction with Sheikh Mubarek to procure the dismissal of Hamdi Pasha, then Governor-General of Basrah. As regards the report respecting the Nakib himself, Seyed Eedjeb, the latter, who is connected by marriage with certain families at Koweit, pays, I am informed, frequent visits to that district, the last one in fact having been made only a few weeks ago. Whether Sheikh Mubarek in the course of these visits has taken the Nakib into his confidence with regard to his relations with the British Government I am unable to say, but it would not be surprising if the fact were so in view of the intimate relations which exist between the two# Coming finally to the report that Hamdi Pasha, the ex-Wali of Basrah, is urging the Turkish Government to shew its authority at Koweit, I have no means whatever of ascertaining what amount of truth, if any, it may contain. In the story itself there is nothing inherently improbable as some such step has always been advocated by Hamdi Pasha, who has, moreover, no reason to bear any good will to Sheikh Mubarek, to whom, as stated above, his dismissal S E—65-74— Sept.from his post as Governor-General of Basrah was partly due. For the present, however, I do not think that there is any probability of anything more being heard o£ such a proposal even if it has been made. Mohsin Pas a, the present Vali, appears above all things to be desirous of keeping on good terms with the Nakib and Mubarek to whom he owes his present position, and it is in the last degree unlikely, therefore, that he would risk incurring heir enmitv by giving countenance to a project which would so seriously atleet tne position of the Sheikh. At the same time if the Central Government should consider that the time had come for putting an end to the independence of Sheikh Mubarek, it is doubtful whether His Excellency would be able to dis regard any direct orders to that etfect which he might receive irom Constanti- nople. Extract from a confidential letter from Mr. Gashin, to the Political Resident m the Persian Gulf, dated the 4th June 1900. There is a report here (in Bahrein) that Seyed Ahmad, the younger brother of the Nakib of Basrah, has been ordered to Constantinople m connection with Koweit affairs, and Seyed Rajah, the Nakib, has been directed to proceed to Koweit to find out the true relations between Shaikh Mubarak and our Government; and that Hamdi Pasha, the ex-Wali of Basrah, is urging the Turkish Government to shew their authority at Koweit. Of course 1 do not know how far all this is true. It is generally suspected Here that there is a clear understanding between Sheikh Mubarek and ourseives.rlst K7\ Confidential.

I have ascertained that Saood,son of Suleiman %aleh al Shibli,has been living at Koweit for a considerable time, and has been,and still is,purchasing camels for export to Egypt.

Mubarak's position appears to me to be getting more difficult, and it remains to be seen how long be will be able to withstand the various combin ations against him and also defy the persistent invitations to him on the part of the Turks that he should visit Basrah.

In forwarding, for your perusal, the enclosed copy of a report which I have received from our news-agent at Koweit, I shall be glad if you will be good enough to let me know whether you have received any information which would confirm this report. It would be interesting to know if Saiyid Ahmed's visit to Koweit was for the reason mentioned in the report. Report from the News-agent at Koweit, dated the 17th August 1900. On 5th June 1900, arrivals from the Hedjaz reported that Yusuf-bin- Ibrahim and the sons of Muhammad-bin-Sabah and Jerrah were with Abdul Aziz-bin-Bashid, and were seeking his assistance against Sheikh Mubarak. The Emir accepted their request and at once wrote a letter to the Sublime Porte, and sent a present of 10 horses via Jeddah, requesting the Sublime Porte either to recover the rights of Muhammad Sabah's sons from Sheikh Mubarak, or to allow him to recover them himself. On receipt of this news. Sheikh Mubarak wired to the Sublime Porte to the effect that the rebel Yusuf-bin- Ibrahim had taken refuge with Emir Ibn Eashid and the latter was assisting him. In consequence of this, the roads were not safe and the Bedouins had taken to plundering (caravans) and disturbances had taken place between Arabs. His stay with Ibn Bashid was not advisable. Sheikh Mubarak's tele gram reached the Sublime Porte before arrival of Ibn Bashid's present and letter. The Sublime Porte wired to Saiyid Ahmed Nakib (of Basrah) to go to Koweit and visit Sheikh Mubarak and write a letter to Emir Abdul Aziz in their name, asking him to send aWay the rebel Yusaf and his companions on receipt of the letter. Saiyid Ahmed's arrival in Koweit is for the above purpose, and he has written a letter to Abdul Aziz as ordered.No. 135, dated Basrah, the 12th September 1900 (Confidential). From — H. S. Shipley , Esq., Her Britannic Majesty^s Consul at Basrah, To—The Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In reply to your despatch No. 920, of the 3rd instant, I have the honour to state that, while the information which I have been able to obtain respecting the nature of the action taken by the Emir of Nejd at Constantinople in favour of the claims of the sons of Muhammad-bin-Sabah and Jerrah against their uncle, Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit, agrees substantially with that furnished to you by your news-agent in the latter place, copy of whose letter you were good enough to send me for perusal, I have heard nothing here which would lead me to believe that the chief object of Saiyid Ahmed's recent mission to Sheikh Mubarak was other than that of conveying an invitation on the part of the Governor-General to the latter to visit Basrah as reported in my despatch to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, No. 26 of the 18th ultimo. Moreover, it has since come to my knowledge that on receipt at Constantinople of the letter from the Emir of Nejd, referred to by your correspondent, a direct telegraphic message was addressed by the Sultan to Mohsin Pasha, enquiring why Sheikh Mubarak had not put in an appearance at Basrah to answer in person the complaints brought against him by Yusuf-el-Ibrahim. This fact together with the rumours which of late have been singularly persistent as to the dismissal of the Vali owing to the displeasure with which, it is alleged, his failure to bring Mubarak to Basrah is viewed in high quarters at Constantinople, not only confirm the version I have given above of Saiyid Ahmed's recent mission, but would also seem to show that an attempt has been made to make use of the action of the Emir of Nejd as a means of calling into question the position of Mohsin Pasha himself as well as that of the Sheikh. It is at any rate significant that a very large sum of money (my information puts it at £5,000), to which I am told the Nakib's family and Mubarak have contributed should precisely at this juncture have been sent by His Excellency to Constantinople, while as regards the feheikh's visit to Basrah the difficulty seems to have been got over by the despatch of a letter to the Sultan, in which Mubarak, after the usual profuse assurances of loyalty and devotion to His Majesty's person, has asserted his entire willingness to pay the visit as promised, but that he is unable to do so for the moment, alleging as an excuse that the unsettled state of the country between Sham war and Koweit rendered his presence at the latter place urgently necessary, in order to prevent the outbreak of serious hostilities. He was, however, ready to defend the action brought against him by Yusuf-el-Ibrahim, in token of which his brother Hamoud would be sent to Basrah to make the necessary arrangements. In giving these further explanations of Saiyid Ahmed's recent visit to Koweit, I have no wish to call into question the general accuracy of your correspondent in that place, or to assert that a letter demanding the expulsion of Yusuf-el-lbrahim may not in concert with Saiyid Ahmed have been drawn up and sent by Mubarak to Ibn Rashid. In one not unimportant particular, indeed, the account given to you by your news-agent is confirmed by the report which the dragoman of this Consulate, Mr. Matthos, has furnished to me of a conversation which he had recently with the Emir's business agent in this town. The latter, it appears, after speaking very freely of the determi nation of his patron to see Mubarak's nephews righted, asked Mr. Matthos confidentially what the attitude of the British Government would be, should the Emir eventually find it necessary to resort to force to attain his object. To this my dragoman, as was only to be expected, returned an evasive answer, and I should have treated the matter as a mere expression of opinion on the part of an irresponsible subordinate had it not been for the corroboration which, as stated above, it appears to afford to that part of your news-agent's letter, in which he refers to the very significanf request of Ibn Bashid to the Sublime Porte to allow him, failing action on the part of the latter, to recover the rights of Mubarak's nephews himself.Speaking generally of the dispute as to the ownership of the Fao date property the chief obstacle to an equitable settlement has hitherto been Sheikh Mubarak himself who as far as appearances go seems unwilling, it must be said, to make that sacrifice of revenue necessary to bring the affair to a satis factory termination. I am, nevertheless, loth to believe that this can be the Sheikh's only reason; for valuable as the above properties are, representing as they do some £15,000 a year, the loss entailed by the cession of even a considerable portion of this sum would be more than compensated by the increased security of title. The fact that the property itself is situated in Ottoman territory will no doubt always confer upon the Turkish Government a certain hold upon its possessor, but it would appear to me to be well worth the Sheikh's while to consider whether, even though the mere fact of justice being done by him to his nephews might very possibly not diminish the number of his enemies, it would not be to his advantage to deprive them of a ready means of intrigue at Constantinople, of which as the recent action of his powerful opponent the Emir of Nejd has shown, they will not be slow to avail themselves.

I have just received a telegram from Shipley that French ship intends to go Koweit, leaving Basrah 12th of October, She has French Vice-Consul, from JBaghdad I presume, on hoard and will probably arrive at Koweit Monday morning. Shipley says that he has not time to refer to Constantinople, but he advises Lawrence ' should be sent to Koweit, if possible. I do not see any particular object in sending the ' Lawrence ', as it is difficult to think that the frenchman has any object except to show flag. Mubarak is not likely^to break agreement with us. I do not, therefore, propose to send ' Lawrence ' unless you think that advisable. Sheikh is, I know, averse to our Government ships visiting Koweit, as it gives him trouble with Turks.3// No. 14, dated Bushire, the 28tli -January 1901 (Confidential). From— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A.

I have the honour to forward, for your information, copies of two com munications I have received from our Koweit News Agent regarding the movements of Sheikh Mubarek. He reports that he has conveyed your message to Sheikh Mubarek and the Sheikh has told him to inform you that so long as Yousif-bin-Ibrahim remains with Bin Hashid in Nejd he will not keep quiet and will instigate Bin Kashid against him, he therefore does not consider it prudent to stay in Koweit and should go to the protection of his tribes. He further reports that Sheikh Mubarek on the 22nd December left Koweit with his followers for HatTer where he ihtended to collect all his tribes and ascertain the intentions ancTlvhereabouts of Bin Rashid, who is reported not to have yet returned to his own territory, that so long as Bin Rashid is at large the Sheikh fears for the safety of his tribes, and that he is accompanied by his brother Hamood, his nephew Khalifah and his cousin Jaber-bin-Pathal. Abdulrahman-bin-Paisal appears to be at Haffar and feheikh Saadoon of the Montifik will go to join Sheikh Mubarek. Local reports corroborate the Koweit News Agent's statements regarding the Sheikh of Koweit's operations, but nothing is known here about Sheikh Saadoon's movements. Translation of a report from the Residency News Agent at Koweit, dated the 29th Shaban 1318 (22nd December 19U0). After compliments. —Please convey my compliments to the Resident and inform him that I have duly conveyed his message to Sheikh Mubarek who gave the following reply :—' That w liat the Resident says is indeed right, but what he sees on the spot the Resident does not see that as long as Tusuf- bin Ibrahim is staying with Ibn Rashid and instigates him against him (Sheikh Mubarek) and his tribes, how can he be sure of their protection and live at rest in his country ? That in case of his remaining in his own territory who would protect his tribes against Ibn Rashid? That no one else carries a heavy load except the person to whom it belongs, that what a man present on the spot sees one who is away does not see, and that it is compulsory and incumbent on him to look to the safety of his tribes. Sheikh Mubarek requested that his reply may be communicated to the Resident, and I accordingly write this for his information. Translation of a report from the Residency News Agent at Koweit, dated the ^9th Shaban 1318 (22ud i^eeember 1900). After compliments. —I beg to inform you that Sheikh Mubarek marched out of Koweit with his troops and followers on the 25th Shaban 1316 (18th S E—57-68—Mar.i 3 12. - December 1900) and proceeded to Hafer where be intends to make a bait till bis tribes have joined him and the wuereabouts of Abdul Aziz ibn Hashid are known to him. The object of Sheikh Mubarek in undertaking these operations is to pro tect his tribes against any designs on the part of Ibn Rashid, who is still on the move and has not returned to his territory, and as long as the latter is moving about unhampered, Sheikli Mubarek will not feel secure and fears that he may overpower his tribes. Accordingly he left Koweit on the 25th Shaaban Q8th December) and took up his quarters at Hafer w r hich is situated at equal distance of six days' march to Nejd on one side^aTTd Ibn Rash id's territory on the other. Among Sheikh Mubarek's followers are his brother Hamood bin Sabah, his nephew Sheikh Khalifa, his cousin Sheikh Jaber bin Fazel and Abdur Rahman bin Feysal; and Sheikh Saadoon Muntefeji will start to join Sheikh JVJubarek at Hafer. The result of these expeditions will be duly reported to you. - Translation of a report, dated 8th January 1901, from the Residency News-Agent at Koweit. I stated in my report of 22nd December that Sheikh Mubarek had gone out to stay with his tribes (for their protection). On the 30th December he wrote to his son Jaber:—'As regards our tribes who live in Dahana and Snmman, Ibn Rashid had attacked them suddenly one morning before my arrival, and a fight had taken place between them, but by the grace of God they (the tribes) held their own. I have now reached Dahana and Samman and all our tribes are with me. I now ask for God's help.' Sheikh Mubarek has also written to Mohsin Pasha Wali (of Bussorah as follows) :— ' As regard Ibn Rashid, you told me to return to my country and not to be afraid of him for the sake of my tribes, because, according to the orders of the Sublime Porte, he was returning to his territory. It will now appear to you whether I am acting in the wrong way or he who is attacking my tribes unawares. But by the grace of God he has not succeeded. Let this action of his be known to you. How can my heart rest at peace when this scoundrel is at liberty (to do what he likes), and that rogue Yusuf bin Ibrahim the rebel.' Sheik Jaber has sent this letter to Mohsin Pasha. Koweit and its environs are safe, but Sheikh Jaber has engaged watchmen to guard the place. Sheikh Sadun of Muntafek and Abdul Rahman bin Paisal are with Sheik Mubarak.

On the 26th ultimo I learned from Seyid Thalib Pasha, the son of the Nakib of Busrah, that Muharek was advancing with a large force to meet Abdul Aziz -ibn-Reschid, and that a decisive encounter might be expected within a few days. I now hear that Mubarek has returned to within ex hours' distance of Koweit, having been deserted by the Matair tribe which has joined Ibn Rescind. It is further reported that Ibn Reschid intends to march on Koweit as soon as water is obtainable on the road, and that he will be joined by Jasim-el- Thani of Katr, an old enemy of Mubarek. Reliable information of what is passing in Nejid is, however, very difficult to obtain. No. 30, dated Bushire, the 9th February 1901 (Confidential). From— L ieutenant -Colonel C. A.

In continuation of previous correspondence, regarding recent events con- rected with the contest between Sheikh Mubarek of Koweit and the Amir of Neid, I have the honour to report that, at my request, H. M. S. Sphinx proceeded to Koweit for the purpose of ascertaining if there was any^truth m the intelligence which had reached me from His Britannic Majesty s Consul at Bussorah on the 28th ultimo, to the effect that a decisive battle was immi nent between Sheikh Mubarek and the Amir. 2, H M. S. Sphinx arrived at Koweit on the 6th instant, and returned to Bushire this day. I submit herewith the report addressed to me by her Commander. It is evident that no decisive engagement has yet taken place, but it is very difficult to know what is really happening. The number of men with Sheikh Mubarek is probably much exaggerated. 3. Captain Phillips informs me that he had an interview with Sheikh Jabber, the Chief's eldest son, vho appeared confident of his father's success, and did not appear in the least anxious about the safety of Koweit.

I have the honour to give you the following news, which I received from the Secret Agent at Koweit, Haji Ali bin Ghulam Reza. / /,'.u i Wi. 4 2. It appears that on the 12th* instant (Arabic), Sheikh Muharek arrived • 2nd February 1901. flie Kejd country, and about half a . ' day's journey from them. H e then pitched his tents opposite to those of Nejd, but all the headmen of the Nejd submitted to Sheikh JVlubarek and promised to be his allies, also Abdul Kahmanbin Faisel, with his relations, and he is now with Sheikh Mubarek. 3. The following tribes and approximate numbers of men are with Sheikh Mubarek :— Matier Owazen , Kashaidah Ajmau Adwaiesh , Beni Hajar Beni Khaled Sheikh Sadouu Sheikh Mubarek Making a total force of about 4,000 »» 10,000 }} 7,000 9,000 » 5,000 &gt;&gt; 3,000 6,000 a 10,000 54,0^0 » 10,000 a 64,000 mf-n. 4. Tip to the present time, Sheikh Mubarek has been unable to find Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Eashid, he being the man he wishes to punish. 5. The Sheikh's son Jaber receiTed infoimation on the 15th* instant (Arabic) • 5th Pebnmry 1901. fr0m SOme friends of llis ^ BusSOrah, that Abdul Aziz was at a place called Eamadi, near Mashad Ali, and that he was collecting provisions for his followers. Sheikh Jaler re] oited tliis to his father at once. 6. It is uncertain when Sheikh Mubarek will return to Koweit, probably not until be has settled w ith Abdul Aziz. Sheikh Jabar is very diligent in protecting the surrounding country during his father's absence, and he has under him about 3,000 men with rifles. 7. Abdul Aziz has about 30.0C0 men with him, but it is not considered likely that he will await Sheikh Mubarek's arrival. 8. On the ISthf instant (Arabic) a messenger was sent by Abdul Aziz to t 8th February 1901. t ^ e Sheikh Faisin-bin-Thani J , the Sheikh t sic j„im.bii,.Tham. of Katr, asking^ for assistance to fight against Mubarek. This messenger was captured by some of Sheik Mubarek's men, who brought him before the Sheikh, and he was subsequently imprisoned. 9.

The correspondence discusses the Ottoman state's efforts to re-establish its authority in Kuwait and to convince Shaikh Mubārak to move away from the British. This correspondence includes details of the annual subsidy allocated to Mubārak by the Ottomans and reports that he was appointed to the Ottoman rank of Mir Miran (Pasha).The file contains reports and correspondence regarding the rivalry and conflict between Shaikh Mubārak (and his tribal allies including the Al Saud) and the ruler of the Emirate of Jabal Shammar and head of the Rashidi tribal dynasty, Abdul Aziz Ibn Mitab [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin Mit‘ab]. This includes detailed reports of the Battle of Sarif that took place between the two sides on 17 March 1901.The file also contains an account of the re-capture of Riyadh by Abdul Aziz ibn Abdulrahman ibn Faisal Al Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd (Ibn Saud)] in 1901.The file contains a number of reports (in their original Arabic with English translations attached) concerning political affairs in Kuwait (and the conflict between Mubarak and the Amir of Nejd) that were written by Ali bin Ghulam Reza, a news agent in Kuwait employed by the British. Many of these reports are addressed (in Arabic) to Hajji Abbas bin Muhmmad bin Fadhil, a munshi employed by the British in Bahrain and it appears that he translated the reports into English.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001be#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
