On the termination of Messrs. Callenders f work in Bahrain the Government appointed Mr. W.B.Steele as State Engineer, on a four years agreement. He had previously belonged to Messrs. Callenders and had acted as their Executive Engineer in Bahrain for some months during their work on the Bahrain contract. CL/SLct 0^5 &gt; The figures in the statements which accompany this report show particulars of revenue and capital and recurrent expenditure from which the financial posi tion of the undertaking can be ascertained. The loss during the whole year includes deprecia tion on all plant and machinery (generation and dis- and tribution) which is a very heavy item,/which has been assessed at rates varying from 4 to 15$, and amounts to Rs 32,000/- which is Rs 5,000/- more than 1349. But out of this amount Rs 22,400/- is depreciation only and it has increased considerably during 1350 owing to the additional depreciation on the Muharrap extension material which has been calculated for the whole year. The balance of the loss about Rs 9,600/- includes certain items which are non-recurrent such as passages to State Engineer on first appointment, furniture, rent of a house for Power House staff leased for four yearsElectricity. and a bill from Messrs. Callenders for running exp enses for the last month of 1349. Deducting these extraordinary amounts it is found that the cash loss • 135 /° on the running during/was about Rs 400/- per month, if the Muharraq scheme had not been entered the loss would be about 630/- per month apart from deprecia tion. Consum p tion . It will be noticed that the unit con sumption in the case of public lighting is much less than during 1349. This is accounted for by the fact that the Municipalities reduced the wattage of their street lighting to 25 per lamp instead of an average of 60, for, from their point of view, economical reasons* The units lost on transmission amount to Rs 23$. This is a higher percentage than usual and is due to the five substations being lightly loaded as wall be seen by the number of units generated during the year, with conse quent high transformer losses. This loss will decrease as the load increases. Fuel oil » Fuel oil cost per unit averages .33 annas per unit generated and lubricating oil .09 annas. The first figure compares very favourably with other diesel stations in India which have a 60$ or 70$ load factor whereas Bahrain at present is in the neighbourhood of 26$ only allow/ing for the station being closed between November and April from 9-30 a.m. till 3.30 p.m. Prospects for 1351 . If wiring continues at the pre sent rate it is hoped that enough load will be obtained during the summer of 1351 to enable the plant to run 24 hours during the whole year.Electricity. Assuming that the wiring of houses proceeds at the present rate (approximately 50 points per month or say 600 in a year) a further connected lighting load of approximately 24 kilo watts would be obtained, but if there was a revival in trade generally the points con nected should easily be doubled. A connected load of 24 k.w. would produce an additional Rs 10,000/- per annum revenue. &gt; —Simi WMF DEPARTMENT. Receipts during 1350 Expenditure - Rs 15,712/- - 14,340/- The condition of this Department continues to be unsatisfactory and it v/ill remain so as long as it is aea run privately by the three Sunni Kadis. There is a strong feeling among the general public and also the lesser mullahs that they and the public should have some voice in the administration of the Sunni Wakfs, but unless H. E. Shaikh Hamad takes up the matter nothing can be done. On various occasions complaints have been made to the Government that Wakf property is not being properly administered, these complaints are referred to the department concerned.fflla lAKF DEPARTMENT. Revenue 1349 - Rs 17,925/- »' 1350 - 18,330/- Balance end of 1350 11,186/- Expenditure during 1350. Repairs to buildings - Rs Upkeep gardens Religious obligations Departmental expenses Purchase of new gardens - 912/- 1,256/- 12,138/- 2,044/- 1,385/- Rs 17,735/- This department has now completed its third year. It has been affected like all other departments by the prevailing financial depression, particularly because its revenue is derived entirely from rents of date gardens and a few fish traps which are leased by the country Bahama who are by far the poorest community in Bahrain. The large balance of Rs 10,315/ owing to the department does not include the amounts which were•remitted from the rents in cases where the Majlis was satisfied that the debtors were genuinely unable to pay. Some good work has been carried out during the year in improving gardens, planting young date trees and preparing ground which has fallen into disuse. In Sitra and Jezirah especially the wakf property has greatly improved and several hundred young trees have been planted. Unfortunately in some cases the vil lagers do not appreciate this work and would preferShia Wakf dept. -2- f: .j. prefer derelict mosques to be rebuilt instead of the wakf property being improved, although in most villages the number of mosques far exceeds the requirements of the population. Until the Wakf department was started no money was ever spent on the gardens so their rental value gradually diminished. During the year several pieces of ground adjacent to wakf gardens have been bought in order to consolidated the property. The department has suffered somewhat through the incessant intrigues and quarrels of the various religious leaders among the Shias; although indi vidually they are all opposed to each other they all resent the existence of a department which prevents the wakf funds being maladministrated and in many cases misappropriated by themselves. The two Shia Kadis, who are Government officials, are the only ones who do not endeavour to injure the or ganisation. The ex-Kadi Shaikh Ehalaf is notoriously mischievous in this respect and uses his great influ ence in persuading his followers to agitate for the wakfs to be given back into his hands. fortunately the members of the Majlis are men of some standing and qb.le until now they have been/to counteract his opposition. i At the end of the year elections took place for a new majlis but owing to Muharram the elections will not be completed until during the first month of the new year. The elections were held at the chief village of every district where about half a dozen representatives were summoned from each village in the neighbourhood. The voting was by ballot, each personShia Wakf Dept, -3- person ?/riting on a slip of paper the name of the man he wished to elect, the individual obtaining most votes was appointed as a member of the mejlis. Although this was an entirely novel procedure among the Bahama they took to it with excessive keenness. In some places the old member was re-elected and in other places a new representative was appointed. The previous members were chosen by the Government, as at that time the majlis was a new institution and it was politic that they should be appointed, not elected. The members of the majlis were chosen as being the leading men of the district and acquainted with date cultivation. One of their duties is to assist in collecting the rents from the wakf tenants and also to supervise the gardens and to report when repairs and work are necessary to the mosques or to the property itself. The department has now begun to register its pro perty in the Land Department, obtaining Government title deeds for the wakf gardens, but it will be some years before they are all registered as there are many thousands of separate ^pieces’* sometimes consist ing of two or three date trees in the middle of a garden. The department has been involved in a consideraole amount of litigation with various landowners, usually members of the Ruling Family who claim wakf property as being part of their own gardens. It is a regret table fact that when these cases are referred to the Sunni Shera court, for decisions, they are not dealt with impartially. The members of the Ruling family and the Sunni Kadis, are inclined to resent the existenceShia Wakf dept. -4- existence of the department, the Khalifah dislike it because they are afraid that it will claim owner ship to wakf property which has at previous times been illegally confiscated by them, and the Kadis resent it because they are afraid that public opinion will force upon them a similar department which would mean that they would no longer have entirely unres trained control over Wakf revenue. One of the advan tages of registration of wakf property will be that once the title deeds are issued there will be an end to the incessant litigation between land owners and wakf department.TRADE AND CUSTOMS. In comparison with the Budget estimates the collections were.- Budget head. Estimated collection Actual Gain Loss Customs and Import yard Extra Khanchieh .. 600,000/- 100 ,000/- 700,000/- 619,690/- 80,310/- Vehicle Licenses 2,500/- 4,897/- 2,397/- Pearling Licenses ♦ 35,000/- 51,050/- 16,650/- Craft registrations 3,000/- 3,297/- 297/- Miscellaneous.

When, in Dhijl Haj 1349, the rate of Khanchia upon bagbag cargo was increased to three annasper bag of three Bahrain maunds, it was estimated that such increase would result in one lakh of collection. The practice deve loped of transhipping bag cargo at sea thus evading these charges; and in view of the situation it was decided to refund to the re-exporter the difference between the pre-existing rate and the new rate. This has been car ried into effect with the result that the net result is a gain to the State of Rs 57,944/- instead of the esti mated lakh. At the moment it is doubtful whether the political arrangement was intended to include oversides delivery of cargo within the Port Limits, and a legal decision on that point is being sought. If the yew is taken that any craft may avail itself of the amenities of the port without paying any dues at all, then such oversides delive ries will occur to a greater extent that at present, and the result will be the loss to Bahrain of its two per cent re-export duty, and also the concurrent Import Yard charges. It will be noticed that the collections from pearling licenses exceed the estimation by Rs 16,650/- This result is not due to under-estimation; but it will be remembered that the collections for the year 1349 A.H. were less than the estimate by Rs 13,968/-. This was because many licen ses were renewed later than was expected, and owing to the movement of the Muhammadan calendar, the actual receipts fell into the year under report instead of 1349. The receipts from craft registrations show a slight gain over the estimate; but this does not so much imply that more craft are registered than formerly, only that a number of registered owners delayed their renewals, and consequently had to pay ten rupees instead of two rupees~ 3 - rupees for each renewal. The Tobacco tax shows a rather unexpected gain due to the increasing quantity of this import. This commodity could, I think, well bear a heavier rate of tax. I give here a comparison of the actual receipts for the two years 1349 and 1350, from Customs and Import yard only. 1349 1350 Steamers' cargo .. Native crait • •• Parcels duty . Passengers baggage Export Duty .. transhipment duty Miscellaneous fees Import yard charges 3,32,524/- 1,08,908/- 11,124/- 18,545/- 27*583/- 8 660/- 1,27,467/- 2,73,578/- 93,691/- 9,234/- 15,182/- 2,352/- 38,052/- 9,404/- 1,78,197/- Totals 6,36,642/- 6,19,690/- Deficiency in year 1350 — Rs 16,952/- It will be noticed that a deficiency octmrs in all the classes of collections except Export Duty and Tran shipment Duty, but it is pleasing to note that the collea tions upon native craft cargoes are but little less than last year. It will be remembered that just over a year ago certain adjustments in the conditions of R.E.Cargo were made, which, it was hoped, would give greater elas ticity in the trade with the mainland. The increase in the receipts suggests that this may be the case. In general the reasons for the decrease in Customs receipts are substantially the same as xor last year, although the quantity of si gar has increased, and , notably, cotton piece goods. Here, one notes with regret, India and Efagland have been practically driven out of the local market by cheaper inferior and snowiershowier Japanese goods, especially in the re-export to the mainland ports. The following comparison illustrates the major imports. 1349 1350 ommodity quantity Average value Quantity Av. value. ice 381,893 cwts Rs . 33,32,190/- 363,208 cwts Rs . 20,76,850/- ottoa P/goods — 10,90,590/- — 21,25,970/- oaf sugar oft 24,531 bgs 87,000 cwts 3,01,030/- 6,35,800/- 34,670 ,bgs 95,140/- 3,68,650/- 6,46,030/- ea 8,662 c/s 5,26,190/- 11,484/c/s 4,62,000/- of fee 8,219 bgs 6,46,730/- 6,420/fegs 4,19,650/- lour 47,847 cwts 2,72,170/- 45,790 cwts 1,93,000/- ilk P/goods . 1,24,960/- — 1,81,500/- heat 22,168 cwts 1,15,050/- 18,990 cwts 92,910/- It is interesting to note that this spring, the Persian craft which regularly visit this port with sheepfe goats etc. did not bring any grain in bulk, as has been their custom, owing to the failure of the rainfall in Persia; but these craft purchased and exported from Bahrain to Persia grain in bulk which had been brought here from Iraq. Also, during the year 1350, this port was visited by 448 native craft, apart from foreign motor launches and steamers, as follows. Iraq registrations 168 craft. Arabian 142 Persian 59 Indian 58 African 21 448 These craft use the port, partly for import into Bahrain, partly for re-export of cargo, and to a consi derable extent for direct transhipment of cargo at sea,-5- sea, within the port limits. This was notably the case of the ^6 Kuwait craft, which in general take cargoes from Iraq to Karachi, and return with a manifest for Kuwait; but visit Bahrain enroute mainly for this direct tranship ment of rice. Their rates of freight are said to be considerably lower than the B.I.S.N. Coy’s rates, and , although they do not ply during the monsoon season, yet their activity is encouraged by local Nejdy traders, and this traffic is likely to be a competing factor with the B.I.S.K.Co, In the year 1349 7 5,01,805 packages of cargo were brought here by 96 steamers. In the year 1350,475,544 packages were brought here by 97 steamers. in-the-yeaa? I give below a comparison of this traffic • 1349 1350. Steamers Packages Steamers Pkgs.

There are vacancies for one clerk and one apprentice. The hand worked crane upon the Customs pier has not been used so much as was expected; but its usexul - ness has been well proven when it is applied to the removal of heavy packages of machinery, motor cars etc. An arrange ment has been made for the adjustment with the Landing Coy. of certain items of their Landing charges, which will makemake the rates levied upon the relative commodities more equable to the importers. The usefulness of the Customs Light at Manamah, erect ed last year, has thoroughly justified its existence, which is acknowledged by many navigators using the port. In continuance of this purpose, the small oil-lights upon the Maharaq Customs Flagstaff have been replaced by a 100 v/att electric light which is visible well beyon§ the outer buoy and adds to the efficiency of the Port. This lighting service is given free of charge. The port is served by a weekly mail service up and down, by the B.I.S.N. Coy f s steamers; and in addition is regularly visited by vessels of the Strick-Ellerman Line, the Hansa Line, both with cargo direct from Europe, and the British Tanker Coy. ltd. with oil supplies from Abadan. It is also noteworthy to observe that the port has been visited three times by vessels of Norwegian nationality under charter by the National Steamship Coy. an Indian organisation, which has run these ships in competition with the B.I.S.N.$oy f s service. It is quite likely that such visits will be repeated, as occasion offers. Local Crafts . There are registered in Bahrain at present 1308 craft, including 67 motor launches; also, 33 craft including one motor-launch were sold to other Persian Gulf ports. The use of motor dhows for Tawwasha work at the pearl banks is now a regular practice, and there are two such craft regularly plying between this port and Kuwait with cargo and passengers. Other motor craft, as occasion offers, proceed to and from Dubai and sundry Persian Ports.-7- Of the above 1308 craft, 481 are registered for pear ling; but of this number it is unfortunate to report that 248 have this year been declared for ! Khammos T diving, this being due to the prevailing lack of ready money. I think it well to draw attention again to the practice of transhipment of cargo at sea, within the Port limits, from one craft to another. The total value of such transhipments during the past year was Rs 8,10,327/** on which duty at 5^ would have been Rs 40,516/- or at 2/c Rs 16,206/- It is gratifying to note that, as regards the quantity of cargo passing through this port, Bahrain is maintaining it-s position as the leading port in the Persian Gulf.GENERAL. Gold Sales . The high price paid for golden coins and gold ornaments induced numbers of people in Bahrain to realise their gold ornaments and also stores of English sovereigns which many people had kept buried. A large quantity of gold ornaments were also imported into Bahrain from the mainland and towards the end of the year there was a very brisk trade in gold ornaments which were @^4/shipped down to India. Bahrain Petroleum Go . The company started actual digging operations in Septr. 1931, and by the end of the year the well on which they are working had reached a depth of about 1800 feet. Shortly before the end of the year a certain amount of oil was found but it was discovered that this was of no real value as the gas was insufficient to bring it up to the sur face. The company are now drilling deeper. Manufacture of tiles . Khalil Kanoo and a Syrian relation of one of the Education staff entered into partnership to manufacture coloured tiles. The workmen were Syrians from Beyrout. About 70,000 tiles were manufactured but owing to the tightness of money only a very small percentage were sold. The partnership dissolved and the two parties are compet ing against each other in selling tiles which has resulted their being sold at a very low price. The Eastern Bank . Since the Eastern Bank came to Bahrain some ten years ago it has occupied a house rented from Abdul Aziz Kozaibi &amp; Co. During 1350 the Bank purchased a site, in the sea, adjacent to the Western Sea Road. This site was previously owned by Mohamed Sharif the bankrupt Persian merchant andGeneral. - 2 - and was sold as part of his assets. The ground has been reclaimed and a very handsome new bank has been built which is to be completed early in 1351. The Contractors are the same firm who built the Port Trust building and the Eastern Bank in Basrah. The building of the new bank has encouraged several local persons to build shops on the opposite side of the Sea Road which strengthens the tendency for the bazaar to expand towards the north west of the town. The Pilgrimage . An exceptionally small number of people from Bahrain attended the 1350 pilgrimage but they included Shaikh Mohamed bin Isa and two sons of H. E. Shaikh Eamad, Shaikhs Mubarak and Abdulla who travelled to Jeddah by sea and returned across Arabia to Bahrain by the land route. Naval Survey . H. M. S. n 0rmonde Tf , R.N.Survey boat, spent over two months in Bahrain doing a survey of the harbour snd surroundings. She sailed shortly before the end of the year. Very small interest v/as taken in the matter by the local population. Shaikh Khalaf . At the end of 134-9, Shaikh Khalaf A1 As fur the ex-Shia Kadi of Bahrain, who had retired to Iraq., was inadvertently issued with a permit by the Iraq authorities and allowed to return to Bahrain. Having arrived he was given permission to remain for : three months in order to settle his affairs in Bahrain, on condition that he remained in Manama. During the Summer of 1350 this order was unofficially cancelled, Shaikh Khalaf was allowed to visit any place in Bahrain and all question of his returning to Iraq was dropped. Shaikh Khalaf had been twice dismissed from his position of Kadi owing to his nefarious practices, during the timeGeneral. i time of Shaikh Isa, and he left Bahrain the last time in order to avoid further criminal proceedings. He has always had a great deal of influence among the Bahama in certain districts and since his return from Iraq his authority seems to have increased. His prestige is far greater among the Bahama than that of either of the authorised Kadis and he uses his influence to undermine their authority and also to damage the Shia Wakf Department. Although he is an old man he is extremely active and he travels round the Bahama villages nreaching in the mosques on Friday and usurping the privileges of the official Kadis who naturally resent and fear his presence in Bahrain. Dawasirs and mainland Arabs . There is no sign of the Dawasir returning to Bahrain and at present this event is most unlikely as the chief men of the tribe are heavily in debt to various Bahrain merchants qnd if they brought their boats and divers back to Bahrain they would almost certainly be forced to hand them over to the Bahrain merchants in settlement of their diving claims. There have been no further developments with regard to the Qatar Arabs who proposed migrating to Bahrain and very little had been heard of the Shia Bahama resident on the Persian coast who came to Bahrain in large numbers to obtain nationality documents during the previous year. A certain number of Shias from Katif, of Bahrain stock, have come to Bahrain but the local Government does not allow able bodied men to lea' that country.General. -4- Distin g uisheA visitors . The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Rersian Gulf visited Bahrain several times during the year and on 4th Jan. 1931 he attended a Durbar which was held at the Palace by H. E. Shaikh Hamad on the occasion of the presentation of the Kaiser- i-Hind medal to Dr. R.D.Holmes. In December H.M.S.’'Emerald' visited Bahrain and remained for several days and the usual official visits were exchanged. On the last day of her stay a most tragic accident ocurred; the ship’s aeroplane while giving a display to a number of local irabs, including boys from the Government schools, crashed in the sea and the pilot Lieut. Heinemann, was killed. He was buried in the Christian cemetery in Bahrain on the following day. Sir Philip Sassoon, Under Secretary of State for Air, and the British Minister in Persia paid short unofficial visits to Bahrain. Shaikh Ahmad bin Jabr, the Ruler of Kuwait paid three visits to Bahrain,on the last occasion he accompanied the Political Resident and attended the Durbar. Innumerable other Arab chiefs, mostly from Oman, came to Bahrain during the year including the following; Shaikh Abdulla bin Jasim, Ruler of l^atar, Shaikhs Said and Juma sons of Maktoom of Dubai. Prince Ahmed, grandson of the late Sultan Abdul Aziz of Turkey, accompanied by Jamaal Pasha, who was at one time a well known Turkish General and took part in the Senussi campaign in 1915, were also entertained by H. E. Shaikh Hamad while making a tour of the Persian Gulf.i C’s. P. P.—L (m) 11 ox—500-11-31. No. of 193 From Political Agency, Bahrein, Dated the 17 til August 193^ •- THE POLITICAL AGENT, BAHREIN.

Another cloud on the horison is the possibility of loss of revenue from the re export trade to the Mainland,should Government force the State to adhere to the arrangements entered into IB years ago. If this is done the British India Steam navigationCompany and other Companies will be forced by Nejdi merchants to give free overside delivery and Bahrain will be headed directly for bankruptcy. 4. 1 must confess I do not always understand the Adviser's system of accounting,or statements such as that on Page 58 that 'had the i uharrap scheme not been entered tie loss per mensem would have been greater'. Actually the extension of the electric light to i uharraq^ has been a most unfortunate business,for it was undertaken without securing aiy undertaking from merchants resident there that they would connect themselves to the supply and few have availed themselves of it. Since the capital expenditure was over Rs.50,000 the State loses at least Rs.2,000 a year in loss of interest,without any tangible advantage, the current sold in Muharra^ has barely covered the cost of generating and transmitting it the re, owing to the very heavy transformer losses due to the distance involved. The Adviser would do well to consult the Political Agent more fully before undertaking works of importance ? since he has little or no experience of administration outside Bahrain. 5. The absence of any form of audit in the State is a grave defect and the Adviser’s attention has been repeatedly drawn to it. How that commercial undertakings such as the Electric Light Supply are under State control,the need for an efficient audit is greater than. ever. I have the honour to be Sir, lour Most Obedient Servant,CONPIPEFTIAL . No:C/155. Office of the Political Agent,Bahrain. Sind Club,Karachi, 10th September 1932. - From:- The Political Agent, Bahrain at Karachi. To: The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf., Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter No:609-S dated the 26th August 1932 regarding the Annual Report of the Bahrain State. 2. It would appear that by lack of specific commendation in my forwarding letter I have conveyed an unfavourable impression of Mr.Belgrave^ work during the past year. This was far from my intention and I would like to efface it, should such an impression have been created. 3. The year may be aptly described as a financial rear guard action,in which the State suffered loss but retired in good order. Though less spectacular,a rear guard action calls for as much,if not greater,skill and pertinacity than an advance,and in this rear guard action Mr.Belgrave xfe has shown considerable ability and courage. He has to oear the brunt of any unpleasantness caused in making economies,and only those who have served in a semi civilized State such as Bahrain can realize the many and diverse forms this unpleasantness can take and what pressure can be brought to bear by interested persons. Had Mr.Belgrave*s efforts been more ably seconded by Captain Parke,who officiated for him during his leave,the deficit would have been smaller. 4. as regards the Muharraq extension. While officiating as Political Resident Colonel Barrett informed me that a detailed critique of the State report was not required and the forwarding letter should not,therefore,be regarded asa complete resume* This was a capital expenditure and consequently had little hearing on the balancing of the budget. When the electric light was introduced in Manam a it was found that many of its loudest supporters failed to take advantage of it,and this should have been a warning with regard to the Muharraq extension. The argument that the Muharraq public had contributed to the main scheme has little weight,for the same argument applies to Hidd, Sanabis and every other township that could be served, since otate bai.ances are made from the Customs revenue to which all the inhabitants of Bahrain contribute. Actual! the Muharraq Baladiya were unable to find their share of the capital cost and the State was obliged to lend it to them. 5. Audit is an essentiit&amp; feature of all Government accounts and also of all except the smaller business undertakings. In Bahrain each department does its own auditing and there the matter ends. It must be obvious that departments are unlikely to discover ail their own errors,even if we suppose that all State servants are models of honesty. Mr.Hedgcock^ first action in Muscat was to introduce an efficient auditor,and he told me that he considered his services invaluable. I have the honour to be Sir Your Most Obedient Servant Political Agent, Bahrain at Karachi.CONFIDENTIAL. No. 6?5~3 of 1932.

It must be admitted that the 1349 season was a very bad one, owing to locusts and disease. Very few of the dates were sold, almost all of them being consumed by H. S. Shaikh Hamad f s household, a fact which he rarely appears to appreciate. In addition to the dates, households of H. E. Shaikh Hamad were provided with local vegetables, vegetable marrows, tomatoes, ladies fingers, egg plants etc. during most of the year. The following trees and cuttings were planted in Sanayan during the year. 175 orange trees from Basrah 90 peacnes from Hassa 8 citrons 7 lemons TT 879 date trees some from Sanayan and some from Hassa. The orange trees are growing extremely well, with the exception of four they are all strong and healthy and, though it is unusual about a dozen trees produced blossom and would actually bear fruit if they were allowed to. A few apple cuttings from Hassa are growing well, also grapes, pomegranates and apricots. Cotton g rowin g. The cultivation of cotton in Bahrain is probably not a new thing. There is men tion of cotton being sent from Bahrain to the Caliphs in Baghdad in historical times, but as the term Bahrain in those days included both the islands and ■'lump SIKULng - JB3 BAgriculture. -6- and the mainland it is not possible to assert that it was grown in what is now known as Bahrain. In most of the gardens there are a few bushes of cotton but it has not been cultivated in recent times. The first sowing of cotton was made at Aali, where Rustom 68 was sown, and 95^ of the seeds germinated within fifteen days. Unfortunately this progress was not maintained, the young plants died and after two months only a negligible number of plants remained alive. The reason for this failure was probably the sulphur in the water which gradually saturated the soil and killed the plants. After this experiment Abdul Aziz Eozaibi, who has always taken a great interest in agriculture offered to plant cotton in a piece of ground on the outskirts of Manamah and this planting was on the whole a very successful undertaking. The area planted was about three acres of new ground. On 15th April work was begun on preparing the ground, digging it over and manuring it, ridges were made and it was irrigated prior to sowing which began on 1st May. The ground was divided as follows. If acres - Rustom 82, 37f lbs. 1 tt _ « 90, 30 lbs. 3 /4th tT - ' 68 22f lbs. Rustoms 82 and 90 was sown on ridges and 68 on plain plots. The seed germinated very well, within about 15 days. The recent manuring had a bad effect on the plants after germination but this was counter acted by more frequent irrigation. About 90/ of theAgriculture. 7- the germinated plants succeeded and it is thought that 95$ of the seeds had germinated. Unfortunately owing to the sowing being unusually late only one flush was obtained and this resulted in the following amount. Rustom 82 - 940 lbs. 90 - 700 ' 68 - 600 n The results of this experiment were reported minutely to Mr. Eastwood of the British Cotton Growing Assocn. Baghdad, who has reported on it, and the samples which were sent, very favourably, but unfortunately owing to the state of the cotton market even if a far greater amount had been grown its export from Bahrain would not, at present, be a financial proposition but it is a matter of considerable importance to know now that the soil water and climate of Bahrain is suitable for the growing of cotton. Imrort of trees etc . All trees and plants imported into Bahrain were inspected by Mr. Said Abdul Noor before being removed from the Customs and a small proportion were condemned as suffering from disease, dust disease, scales, gamosis etc. which aifect citrus trees especially. During sear 1349 between ten and fix teen thousand young date trees were imported from Hassa and Katif but during 1350 only about 1500 were imported owing to the prohibitive export tax which has recently been imposed on date trees by the Government of H.M. King Ibn Saoud.Agriculture. -8- In spite of the limitations set on Mr. Said Abdul Moor’s work owing to lack of funds I consider that what he has achieved is of considerable value and has proved that there are agricultural poten tialities in Bahrain which are well worth developing if money was available.THE BAHRAIN ELECTRIC SUPPLY. The Bahrain Electric Supply has been seriously affected by the acute economic depression in Bahrain v/hich has deterred many people from the initial outlay of installing electric light in their houses and shops. This has been particularly apparent in Muharraq where the capital expended on the extension has pro duced less revenue than might reasonably have been expected because so few of the leading merchants have taken it up. Muhara q extension . The decision to extend the elect ric power to Muharraq was made at the beginning of 1350. The work was carried out by Messrs. Callenders Cable and Construction Co. whose tender was accepted by the Bahrain Government. The amount of the tender was Rs 52,144/-. The work was completed on 1st Jamadi al Awal 1350, (13th Septr. 1931) and by the end of the year 24 con sumers had been connected. The extension is connected to Manama by approximately 1^ miles of 3300 volt over head transmission line which is carried across the shallow sea on poles built into islands along the site of the Manamah - Muharraq road. A submarine cable approximately 700 yards long, lying on the bed of the sea, conveys the current across the deep channel which runs between the two islands, and is used as a passage by boats travelling North and South. To prevent beats crossing underneath the line in the Muharraq harbour, a wooden boom has been placed between the islands on which the poles are built. The high tension line ter minates at Muharraq in a step-down 3300/440 volt sub-Electricity. 2 sub-station from which the town distribution is taken. Distribution in the town of Muharraq. is by low tension over head lines, where suitable, and by under ground cables in some parts of the bazaars. Lines have been run along the principal thoroughfares and districts of potential consumers^certain roads and bazaars being lighted by the Municipality. From the connecting date until the end of 1350 24 consumers have been connected or approximately 280 points. A Municipal wiring scheme was arranged by the Muni cipal council by which persons wiring their houses should pay for the wiring over a period of two years. The Municipality allocated Rs 4,000/- for this purpose but in spite of this there has been small result owing to shortness of money. The public as a whole appreciate and like the electric light and are only deterred from installing it for financial reasons. They find that it is more economical and very much more satisfactory than oil lamps which were previously used. Manama. In Manama 52 additional consumers have been connected during the year bringing the total num ber of consumers in Manama up to 274 altogether. An innovation in Manama, and also in Muharraq. is the per mission to keep the bazaars open until four hours after sunset instead of being closed to the public at sunset, by order of the Government. This restriction was very necessary when there were no lights in the bazaars and when public security was not what it is now. Owing to the new arrangement about 20 shops have been wiredElectricity - 3 - wired and some which were already wired now use lights after dark. This new concession will be of most benefit in the winter because in the summer it is the custom of the people to walk outside the town in the evenings and enjoy the air and most of the bazaar coffee shops move out of the bazaar to positions on the edge of the town. Ice machine . During 1350 one of the two ice plants bought by the Municipality from H. E. Shaikh Hamad was dismantled and re-crected in the Power House where it is now driven by an 15 H.P. electric motor instead of an oil engine. Power is supplied to the Municipality at the special rate of one anna per unit. It was run very successfully during the summer of 1350,and vide Municipal report. The original rate charged remains at 8 annas per unit for light and 4 annas per unit for power. Wiring. Until 28th October all wiring was done by Messrs. Callenders Cable and Construction Go. but on completion of the Muharraq scheme^when the company handed over^ the Government of Bahrain took up the wiring work. After very lengthy negociations which finally resulted in a considerable reduction in the prices the Government purchased from Messrs. Callenders a supply of wiring material for Rs 8,0Q0/~ which it was calculated would last for about six months. Over 2/3rds of this material has already been used. When Messrs. Callenders completed their work they had a large stock of surplus material which they wished the Bahrain Government to buy from them. The price amount ed to about Rs 19,000/-&gt; After lengthy correspondence which resulted in numerous reductions in the price ofElectricity. 4- of various items. The Government decided not to pur chase this stock, owing to uncertainty in prices and unwillingness to incur additional responsibility^as it was inconvenient and expensive for Messrs. Callen ders to remove the material or to store it , an arrange ment was eventually made by which the Government took it over as consignment stock but accepting no respon sibility for it. It was insured by Messrs. Callenders. The Government has already drawn on this stock to over Es 1000/-. Since taking over the wiring work the Government has wired 76 houses, in about six months and the wiring personnel has been continuously employed. The nett profit after paying wages, material etc. etc. is Rs 1282/-. The profit has been kept very low in order to encourage people to instal electricity which will eventually increase revenue. Messrs. Callenders’ standard price for wiring was Rs 22/8 per point. The average price charged by the Government is Rs 18/— but the charge various according to the amount of material used. At present the department has orders in hand suf ficient to employ the wiring staff for the next two months. The wiring Y/hich has been done includes offices, houses, shops, mosques and matems. The Kaleeco system is used for wiring, it is lead covered, safe and durable, and the cheaper V.i*r. cleat v/iring is also available but although there is a big difference in the price, the public unanimously insist on the Kaleeco method./ NOT FOR DIRECT PHOTOCOPYING COPIES MAY BE ORDERED FROMft\ ( cD ! No. of 1351 Office of i!he Adviser to the Ck)veriinient, Bahrain, Dated, Sarar, 1351 From The Financial Adviser to the Government, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. To H. B. IPs Political Agent, Bahrain, Sir, I have the honour to forward for your informa tion the annual report on the Bahrain State for 1350 together with the Budget for 1351 and notes on Reve nue and Expenditure during 1350. This is the v.-_ seventh Budget which I have had the honour to sub mit. Never in the last six years has there been so little to report. Owing to the urgent need for retrenchment the Government has carried out no new works either in the nature of public buildings or social services. In every direction the activity of the Government has been restricted owing to shortage of revenue. Owing to my absence on leave in England for six months during the Summer of 1350 some portions of the report are not as detailed as I should have liked them to be. The following is a summary of the financial results of the year 1350.At the beginning of the year the State held a balance of Rs 1,13,856/- apart from the Reserve fund of three lacs which is still, fortunately, intact* At the end of the year only Rs 24,540/- of this amount remained. In the Budget for 1350 it was estimated that the REVENUE would be Rs 8,33,516/-. The actual RETEMIE was only Rs 7,96,60l/—, a DEFICIT of Rs 35,915/- on the amount budgeted. The EXPESDITURE for 1350 was estimated in the Budget at Rs 8,32,516/-. The actual EXPENDITURE was Rs 8,33,52?/-, only Rs l,0ll/- more than the amount which was estimated. The total DEPICIT therefore on the year is.- This amount was appropriated from the balance which was carried over from 1349. Besides this amount capital expenditure was incur red in connection with the Muharraq electric extension, and loan advanced to Bahrain Electric Supply amounting to Rs 52,390/- which was also paid from the Rs 1,13,856/- thus reducing the balance to Rs 24,540/-. Appropriation to cover revenue , deficit in 1350 Rs 36,926/- Payment in? e’’ ' * tension Defit on the Revenue sie n Expenditure Rs 36,926/- Less 52,390/- 24,540/- Balance at end of 1350 Rs 113,856/- At the end of 1349, the State had financial liabilities amounting to over half a lac on account of the Maharaq3 -3- Maharaqt Sleotric Extension; the whole of this amount was paid during 1350 and at the beginning of 1351 the State had no financial liabilities whatever. In the Budget for 1351 the expenditure has been reduced to about Rs 40,000/- less than that of 1350, partly by means of a 10$ cut on salaries of all Govern ment servants receiving pay of over Rs 36/- per month and partly through the abolition of the post of the Commandant of Police and various other economies. Although a reduction of 10$ was effected in the Civil List at the beginning of 1350 this item still absorbs more than 50$ of the estimated revenue. The financial prospects for the new year are not encouraging. The pearl trade on which the whole of Bahrain depends, is in a desperate condition, last year there was very little market for pearls and once again the Bahrain merchants have accumulated another season f s catch most of which they were unable to sell. By means of drastic economies and some new taxation the new Budget has been balanced, but it allows for no margin whatever and if the bulk of imported cargo dimi nishes, as is possible, the measures which have been adopted to balance the Budget on the Revenue side will fail to produce the required effect. In one direction only there is a possibility of incre ased revenue, but this possibility is very problematical. If the Bahrain Petroleum Co. should succeed in finding a commercially negotiable quantity of oil it might be rea sonably hoped that the Royalty payable by the Company to the State would be sufficient to relieve it from its present financial depression. ^ have the honour to be, Your obedient servant,Notes on Budget for 1351. This is a starvation budget. The total amount budgeted for is the lowest amount since there have been budgets for the Bahrain State. It is nearly half a lac less than last year’s budget and even so it is impossible to guaran tee with any degree of certainty that the revenue which is estimated on the receipt side will be forthcoming. If the revenue falls short or the expenditure exceeds the budget figure the only resource which the government will be able to utilise, apart from the Reserve fund, is the small sum of Rs 24,540/- which was the balance from the year 1350. The estimate for the revenue is based on the assumption that trade will not become any worse than it has been during the last year. Revenue . The first five headings, amounting to 7 lacs consist of revenue which is collected by the Customs Department of which the chief item is customs receipts. This total has been estimated at about half a lac less than last yearfe estimate but about Rs 15,000/- more than new last year’s actual receipts on account of certain/taxa tion which comes into force at the beginning of the new year consisting of an additional ^ on tobacco and all its products as well as on certain luxury articles and the inclusion of liquor as a taxable import which is now counted as a luxury import instead of, as before, being imported free of duty. It is hoped that permission will be obtained during the year to increase the tax on luxuries so that it be- r ..5. comes a 15^ tax. These imports, especially tobacco, can bear the additional duty.* * * * * ( 5 ) f t 'i - 2 - Passport fees . The estimated amount is almost identical to the actual collection of 1350. Judicial receipts . The estimated revenue is Rs 3000/- less than the actual amount collected during 1350. Land Registration &amp; Leases . These two headings have been estimated at Rs 2000/- less than last year. The revenue from registration of titles &amp; sales has steadily increased each year so it is to be hoped that the actual revenue will exceed this amount. Rents on Govt, lands . Consists of Rs 10,000/- oil conces sion lease and £120/- from the R.A.F. for lease of the Aero drome together with land rents fompersons occupying Govt; A land, the last item is likely to decrease as the tenants are persons of the poorest class and have much difficulty in paying anything. Interest on reserve . This amount is due during the new year being interest paid by the Eastern Bank on the Reserve Fund which they hold on deposit account. When this money was invested the interest was unusually high. Loans Recoverable . The Government now holds a mortgage on some property of Mohomed bin Subah Al-bin-Ali who owes Rs 9000/- the balance of a loan made to him three years ago. It is doubtful whether the whole of this amount will be recovered this year.Notes on udget. 1351. Expenditure. 0 *) Allowances to the Ruling family . Rs 4,3E,000/~ . This amount is larger than the sum allocated for last year because after the 1350 budget was completed and approved certain modifications were made during my absence on leave which affected the 10% reduction in the Civil List and increased the amount. The Civil List does not include payments to the Ruling Family on account of special services such as imirs, Magistrates etc, these are shown under the appropriate headings. The Civil List for year 1351 is more than 50% of the total estimated revenue. The following figures show the proportion of the Civil List as compared to revenue during recent years, and also show the serious falling off in revenue. Year. Revenue. Civil List. 1347 12,47,000/- 5,04,000/- 40i$ 1348 11,34,000/- 5,08,000/- 45$ 1349 8,17,000/- 4,88,000/- 59f$ 1350 7,96,000/- 4,34,700/- 54§$ State Protection. Rs 1.21.900/-. , A reduction of Rs 10,000/- only on last year’s estimates has been achieved by various economies including the abolition of the post of Commandant of Police and the coming substitution of local police for Indians. The saving is small as the economies will not become effective until after the middle of the year and in the meantime allowance has to be made for additional local police who are being trained preparatory- 2 - preparatory to taking over the duties from the Indian Force, and also for passages and leave pay for the Indians. Govt. departments . In these departments a saving of Rs 14,000/- has been achieved by means of reduction of staff and a 10^ cut on all salaries and also by the fact that it happens that during 1350 none of the senior officials are due for leave. Education . A saving of Rs 10,000/- is to be effected by a cut in salaries, various economies and the decision to close one of the two boys 1 schools in Manama and combine the two in one building, the Jaffaria school, which will enable the girls f school to be moved into what is now the Sunni school building. This arrange ment is to’come into force at the beginning of the school term. It is like^fco cause some disturbance. Medical . A rent of Rs 4,800/- per annum is paid to H. E. Shaikh Hamad for the site of the Quarantine camp which is leased from him. Municipalities . A grant of Rs IGGO/- per month is made to each of the Municipal councils. The last four items have been reduced to the very lowest possible amount. The Rs 2000/- is intended to cover the government’s contribution towards loss during the year in the electric scheme, assuming that the revenue does not cover the running cost. Under Agriculture a sufficient amount has been pro vided to pay the salary of the Agriculturist for three months and also for the upkeep of the Palace garden. There is a small surplus under this heading. The Agriculturist has been given provisional notice andand failing a decided improvement in the financial position he will not return to Bahrain after taking his leave in the summer. Public works etc . This includes repairs to the pier, which are necessary, and upkeep of Government buildings, roads and bridges. As no money is available it has been impossible to allow for any unforseen expenditure and only the essentially necessary expenditure has been budgeted for.THE PEiffiL INDUSTRY. The state of this industry, the mainstay of Bahrain, has gone from bad to worse, the condition of the pearl market is deplorable and there is hardly a single bign According toTLa Perle Tt which is the official perio dical of the pearl and precious stone industry in Paris, the catch during the last season was rt 0ne quarter or one fifth of 1930 which was already small' The article which I quote also states that only one third of the boats that went out in 1930 were fishing in 1931 and the quality and size of the pearls was inferior to the previous season. of the value of the season f s pearls as they are not sub ject to customs valuation. ibout half the naukhudas employ the official diving clerks to make their accounts and from these accounts I can form a somewhat rough estimate of the annual production, assuming that the rest of the boats whose accounts are made independently, and which I have had no opportunity of examining, obtained # a proportionate amount of pearls. It must be remembered that these values are the amounts paid by the land naukhudas or Tajars, to the sea naukhudas and by the time the pearls reach the final purchaser in Bahrain they may have changed hands many times and ?/ill certainly have increased very much in price. One known example of this was a pearl produced some years ago which was sold by the finder for Its 75,000/- and eventually changed hands in Bahrein for two lacs. merchant or naukhuda who is not in financial dij ies* obtain an accurate estimatePearl industry. -2- 1347/48 1348/49 49/50 538 509 504 1348/49 Rs 21,25,000/- or, £ 1,57,407• 1349/50 - Rs 18,32,000/- or, £ 1,35,703, According to these figures the difference between the 1348/49 and 1349/50 seasons was comparatively small but the production during these last two seasons res pectively was less than half the season of 1347/48, In the total weight of the pearls there was very little difference between the last season and the one before, but during the last season fewer large pearls were found. The five or six largest pearls found during the last season weighed between 17 to 20 chows each. Selaf and Tesquam advances . The Tesquam after the last season was settled as usual by a public meeting of pearl merchants and naukhudas at Rs 30/— for a diver and Rs 25/- for a puller. This abnormally low amount raised no protest as the financial condition of the pearl indus try is now thoroughly well known. At the end of the year a similar meeting was held to decide upon the Selaf which was fixed at the same amount as the Tesquam with the additional payment of Rs 15/- to divers and pullers alike at the Tr Kharjieh !t which is the interval between during the last quarter of the season when the boats come ashore for five days. It is unlikely that there will be any commotion in connection with the Selaf. Only a few years ago the advances at Selaf were Rs 180/— Total number ofbpats registered as diving, (from Bahrain) Total value of pearls found, i.e., original amount paid to the finders, Bahrain i — do —Pearl industry. and Rs 150/- and before the amounts were controlled by Government divers were in some cases advanced five or six hundred rupees at Selaf or Tesquam. Bankrupt Naukhudas . Istofa . An unusually large number of Naukhudas have become bankrupt this year and their boats and divers have been taken over by their Tajars. These bankruptcy proceedings are in reality cases between Naukhuda and Tajar and are dealt with according to diving laws, not according to Shera or commercial law. When a Naukhuda has become deeply in debt to his Tajar the Tajar very frequently refuses to lend him any more money to equip his boat and give advances to the divers, the Tajar has then the right to close his account with the Naukhuda taking over his boats at a valuation which is assessed by a committee, and completing the amount of his claim by taking over divers according to the debts which they have against them in their books. Accord ing to custom the Tajar has no right to take over any of the Naukhuda f s property except boats and divers. But during the last two or three years, owing to the slump in the pearl trade, conditions which have existed from time immemorial have begun to change. Because divers are no longer regarded as slaves their value as a transferable commodity has decreased. Tajars find that to take over half a lac worth of divers is not as advantageous as it used to be. Under the present law if a diver dies his children can not be made responsible for his debt, as they used to be, and he cannot be used as a labourer in house cPearl industry. -4- or garden, during the off season, as was previously the custom. Partly owing to this and partly owing to the bad times a practice has crept in by which Tajars only advance money to their naukhudas if the naukhuda gives mortgages for the amount on his house or garden property in Bahrain. The naukhuda f s divers and boats used to be sufficient security for the tajar who financed him. Nov/ they are not. Khammamis and Selafieh . Every year the number of boats diving on Khammas system is increasing. This is owing to difficulty that naukhudas have in obtain ing capital for making advances. The increase of the Khammamis is advantageous to the divers themselves who, as they receive no advance from a tajar, are not bound t? sell their pearls to any particular person, and hav^more freedom they can get a fairer sale for what they find. Divers ! fedebts . With the exception of about a dozen boats all the divers last season on the Selafieh system, increased their deots and receivedno proiits out of the season. The Khammamis, who do not take regular advances, made very small proiits. At the same time it appears that most of the pearls of tne 1350 season were sold and the large stocks which are still held by so many of the Bahrain merchants are those obtained two or three years ago which they are unwilling to part with at much less than they originally paid for them. Foreign buyers . Yery few foreign buyers came to Bahrain during 1350, those who came included Mr. lack, a representative of Dr. Bienenfield and one Indian buyer who purchased comparatively a large amount.Mr. Rosenthal and Shaikh Mohomed Ali Zainal did not visit Bahrain although they came to Bombay. At the end of the season, as usual, most of the Bahrain merchants went down to Bombay, following the foreign buyers, but they were unable to sell. During the year two Bahrain merchants, Jasim Kanoo, and the son of Mohomed bin Hindi went with their goods to Paris but they also found no market, partly owing to the pearls not having been bored. Prospects for 1351 . The prospects for the new season are not encouraging. In spite of the low Selaf most of the Naukhudas declare that they have no money to equip their boats. The Khanchieh, a preliminary diving season lasting not more than a month, has produced very disappointing results both in quality and quantity. It is generally considered as a reliable forecast of the main season. It is possible though that the small catch may be partly accounted for by the weather being unfavour able during about half of the time, another explana tion is that the divers themselves are very weak as they have had to exist on such meagre rations during the year. If this is true, the prospect for the new season is depressing.Police &amp; Public security. Strength of Police at end of 1350.- Indian Police - ■ hrab police 44 78 122 men irmed Waturs under the imirs - 114 men No. of police prosecutions during the year 1350 - 591. Public security. The state of public security remains satisfactory and it has been possible to substitute armed naturs at Eafaa in place of the section of Indian Police who were previously posted there, this is partly owing to the fact that the young imir of Rafaa is one of the most capable and active members of the Puling Family. During the year one case of murder was dealt with by the Police. Owing to his generally unsatisfactory conduct especially during the recent strike the Amir of Muhar- raq has been dismissed and the Amir of Manama has been transferred to Muharraq, his work in Manama is being carried out by his second in command. The condition of things in the town of Hedd requires some attention and when funds permit and a suitable man is found it is proposed to appoint an Amir there. At present one section of Police is stationed at Hedd. Liquor. The use, sale or manufacture of liquor in Bahrain is and always has been, strictly forbidden except to those persons who are granted special permits by H. B. MBs Political Agent. Recently there has beenPolice. -2- been a very serious increase in the number of Arabs who have taken to drinking liquor which is secretly manufactured. The worst offenders are certain mem bers of the Khalifah family. Owing to their highly placed position, and because they drink in their own houses it is difficult for the Police to take action against them. Persons who are caught drinking or distilling arrak are severely dealt with but undoubt edly a number of these people avoid detection. There is a feeling among a number of the younger and would-be progressive Arabs, who have travelled abroad, that the restrictions on drink should be withdrawn but on this subject Shaikh Hamad has very strong views. Indian Police. The 44 Indian police complete their agreements in about six months from the end of the year, and it is not proposed to renew their contracts. They are being substituted by locally enlisted police who are very much less expensive and altogether more suitable for police work. The Arab police are a mixed force and include Persians, mainland Arabs, Yemenis and negroes. There are at present three sections of recruits at different stages of training and their progress is very satisfactory, although on ceremonial occasions they will never be able to compare with the Punjabis who have had many years service in the Indian Army. Commandant of Police. Por reasons of economy it was decided not to renew tthe agreement of Captain L.S.Parke, Commandant of Police and Assistant Adviser, on the completion ofPolice. _‘ ; 5 _ of his contract which terminates in September 1932. Captain Parke proceeded on leave on 13th April having served as Commandant for six years. In the meantime the duties of the Commandant of Police will be carried out by the Adviser. Foreign -prostitutes and beggars . A large number of foreign prostitutes and beggars were repatriated to the ports from which they came during the year.JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. No. of new cases heard in Bahrain No. of new cases heard in Small Court during 1350 Court during 1350 668 255 Total 1023. During 1350 the Bahrain Court heard over 200 more new cases than during the previous year. The increase in litigation is a sign of the times and the hearing of innumerable cases only confirms the fact that on the whole the financial condition of the general public is extremely bad. Out of this total 218 cases were land disputes or matters concerning registration of titles forwarded to the court by the Land Department. At present the following Bahrain courts exist. The Bahrain Court - The Adviser and Shaikh Sulman The Sunni Shera Bourt - The three Sunni Qadis. Two Shia Shera Courts - One Qadi at Manama and of whom 11 sit on alternative weeks during one day in the week. All cases are filed in the Bahrain Court and then if not dealt with there they are passed on to the court competent to deal with them. At the end of the year the Bahrain Court had about 300 new suits which had not been dealt with and both the Shm courts had accumulated several hundred cases Y/hich they had not had time to settle. The Bahrain Court sits three times a week from son of Shaikh Hamad. The Bahrain Small Court - Two Shaikhs of the Majlis Tajara one at Sinabis. A court of 22 leading merchants 8 a.m. till 2 p.m. but in spite of this it is impossible to get the work done. During the year the number ofJudicial dept. fi ef old cases which were dealt with was equal to the total amount of new cases. Sanction was obtained from Shaikh Hamad at the end of the year for a regular arrangement by which* appeals whould be submitted to him. Until now there has been no systematic method of presenting appeals which is an unsatisfactory condition and has resulted in personal complaints to the Ruler by persons against whom judgments have been passed and in many instances reversals of the court T s findings by order of H.E. Shaikh Hamad. This has done considerable harm to the prestige of the Bahrain Court and has made the carrying out of its duties at times extremely difficult. There is urgent need for the compilation of a simple code in which all government proclamations should be included under different headings such as diving laws, municipal orders etc. etc. but this I have been unable to complete ov/ing to lack of time. Another matter which requires careful consideration is the specific definition of each court. It should be impossible for cases to be handed on from court to court on the application of one of the parties. It often happens now that the Bahrain court settles a case, the defendent applies to H.E.Shaikh Hamad for its transfer to the Majlis Tajara, this is done, but the party is dissatisfied with the verdict and then applies for a transfer to one of the Shera courts, and then it sometimes happens that the case is finally returned to the Bahrain Court. This is an undignified unlawful and unsuitable procedure.The complete lack of supervision either by the Govern ment or even the Shera over estates of widows, minors and orphans has during recent years been the subject of much criticism in Bahrain. It is a notorious fact that this attitude of indifference on the part of the Government has led to innumerable instances of mis appropriation by executors of wills and by persons ap pointed by wills or by the Kadis to administer estates of deceased persons. About six years ago Major Daly, then Political Officer, attempted to introduce certain reforms in this direction. He succeeded to some extent but when he left Bahrain opposition was organised, at that time mainly by the religious leaders, and the measures were withdrawn. Particular instances. During the last year or two a number of cases have come before the Bahrain Court revealing a most unsatis factory condition of affairs. Innumerable women and children have been robbed and cheated by persons who were supposed to be guarding their interests and adminis tering their estates. In many cases the general pub lic were aware of the facts but nobody considered it his duty to inform the court, and the people who were being robbed were incapable of complaining. It is beyond the scope of this note to give particulars of all these cases but two or three instances are enough to show what has been happening. 1. Ahmed bin Rashid al Naimi, the eldest brother of a young family whose father died was appointed by thethe Sunni Kadis as guardian of his young brothers and sisters and administrator of his deceased father r s estate which was worth about 4-J- lacs. If ter two years one of the brothers came of age and filed a suit demand- ing to see the accounts of the administration. Out of the original estate there only remained about Rs 28,000/-, the rest had 'gone into the sea', it had been lost in diving speculation. 2. Ali bin Seggar, a leading Muharra^ pearl merchant was appointed by will as administrator of his brother r s estate of 12 lacs which consisted mostly of cash which was realised from pearls at the time of his death. Kor about eight years he kept the heirs quiet by annual payments, they being mostly women and children. Dur ing the slump on the pearl market he fell into financial difficulties, and became partly paralysed; the heirs made a case asking to see the accounts and it was tound that practically nothing remained of his brother^ estate except two houses, all of it had disappeared in diving. The Court has taken possession of the title deeds of Ali bin Seggar f s own property which in normal times should be almost sufficient to satisfy the claims of the heirs. 3. In another case two cousins, the Siadis, took possession of their uncles } estate and disregarding the other heirs, who were minors, enjoyed it for many years. Finally they quarelled over the spoils and the matter came before the Court. The original estate was valued at about 10 lacs. It was found that about three lacs of rupees were buried in an empty house in Muharraq. This money was taken over by the Government and put in the Bank. The shares of one of the heirs, a young man,- 3 ' man, and also his sister, were proved and the amount due to them was deposited in their name. The balance of the money and a large amount of property is now the subject matter of a lengthy and very complicated case which has been going on in the Bahrain Court for over two years. There are endless other cases of the same sort in which women and children and in one case a blind man have been swindled out of their rights by the adminis trators of the estateswhich they should inherit. Recent lean years have aggravated the conditions as in most cases the money was lost in diving, although it is strictly forbidden by Mohamedan law for the administrators of estates to speculate with the money which they are entrusted with in dangerous trade. They are permited to invest in property or to use the money in trade as long as it is not of a dangerous nature and on condition that the administrator possess an equivalent capital himself with which he can refund the estate if any dis aster occurs, but in Bahrain the law of the Shera in this respect is disregarded. Government issues proclamation. These cases, and many others, were reported by the Bahrain Court to Shaikh Hamad in detail. Various dis cussions and meetings took place, the Kadis were inter viewed and a proclamation was composed somewhat on the lines of one previously issued by the Agency six months before which had been accepted by the public, without objection. It required that all wills shouH be regis tered by the Government before being executed and in the case of persons dying intestate the executor should not act before informing the -Government. It specially 4&gt;j-4- specially mentioned that all matters pertaining to the Shera would be sent to the Kadis for disposal. Shaikh Hamad expressed himself unusually strongly in favour of the measure, Shaikhs Abdulla and Sulman, who had repeatedly urged the necessity for legislation of this nature, gave it as their considered opinion that the proclamation would not cause any excitement 03 /oppo- sition. The Sunni Kadis agreed that it was absolutely necessary, but wished the whole matter to be in their own hands. The Shia Kadis expressed unqualified appro val. On December 26th 1931, the proclamation was issued and was accepted by the public without comment. One or two reports were made of people who had died leaving pro perty, but evidently the order was not universally obeyed. On 1st February one of the Shia Kadis, Shaikh Ali bin Hassan, Y/ho had himself forwarded a public petition from the villages around him asking Government to inter vene in the administration of estates, sent a message to say that he was having a great deal of trouble owing to the proclamation. I visited him and found a crowd of about sixty people surrounding his house in a state of great excitement. The matter was explained to them and they went off to their homes apparently satisfied. This demonstration was organised by a neighbouring mulla who for some years has aspired to usurp the position of the official Kadi. In the meantime the Municipalities, Police and hmirs were ordered to report any deaths. It is possible that they behaved somewhat tactlessly in enquiring at houses where deaths had recently ocurred. Public opposition. During the next few days certain individuals inin Muharraq and Hedd held private meetings on the sub ject, and began to organise petitions and general opposition, A small section of the Manama Shias, one particular faction^combined with the Arabs and entered into a solemn agreement that they would work together with the Arabs against the Government in this or any future question which appeared.to require combined op position, It is many years since an alliance of this nature was made by the Bahama with the Arabs. A number of local notables as well as the members of the Municipal councils were sent for by me and the mat ter was explained to them again. They all understood and in most cases the younger and more progressive men expressed their approval, but the old conservative type of men did not. All of them said that the general pub lic were apposed to the measure as they had heard various incorrect statements about it. It was afterwards ascer- Cu tained that deliberate propaganda organised partly by the Sunni Kadis and by a certain faction in Muharraq and Eedd had been spread among the illiterate and ignorant people who form the greater proportion of the population of those two towns. They were told that the Government meant to take one quarter of the property of everyone who died; that all women who died were to be medically examined; that the families of people who died would be instantly turned out of their houses, and many other alarming stories. All this time Shaikh Hamad was out at Sakhir, but Shaikh Abdulla was in Muharraq. This was the time of the Residents visit to Hassa and there is no doubt that his presence here had the effect of postponing the disturbances which ocurred later on. wm- 6 - On 6th Feb. about thirty people mostly second Bate merchants from Muharraq and Hedd, went out to Sakhir and had an audience with Shaikh Hamad. They demanded that the proclamation should be cancelled. One of them in particular spoke very violently on the subject. (Since then a case has been brought against him for misappropriating the property of some minors-) Somewhat to their surprise Shaikh Hamad replied to them very firmly telling them that the present condition of things was disgraceful and Sssir could not be allowed to continue. They left without obtaining any concession. Unfortunately this firm attitude was not maintained; it was suggested this same night that the proclamation should be taken down from the notice boards, secretly. However this was not done. The Eid of Eitr was on 8th Feb. Contrary to his usual custom Shaikh Hamad did not visit luharraq on the second day of the Eid. In Manama conditions were normal but in Muharraq the Eid was not celebrated in the ordinary way. The slaves who dance outside the houses of the Shaikhs, a great feature of this Eid, did not appear, they had been given orders not to come. Crowds collected on the pier waiting to make a demonstration, speeches were made by people in the Bazaars. Bazaars Close. On the day after the Eid all the shops and offices in the Manama and Muharraq bazaars were closed. This demons tration originated in Muharraq where some of the leading merchants set the example, others did the same and the small shopkeepers closed their stores as they were afraid that the bazaar might be looted. In Manama rumours werewere circulated that a mob of divers were coming over from Huharraq. to raid the bazaar and certain of the Manama Shias closed their shops and persuaded their neighbours to do the same, the leading Arab and foreign merchants, seeing that most of the bazaar was closed, shut up their places of business and went home. On the next day none of the shops opened, including the meat fish and vegetable markets. In the morning Shaikh Hamad sent for Shaikh Abdulla, Shaikh Rashid, myself and about half a dozen of the leading/4rabs including Kanoo, Zayani and Yousuf lakhroo. At the same time, by chance, a number of the Khalifah Shaikh- lings, nephews and sons of Shaikh Hamad, went out to Sakhir to call on him. Deputation at Sakhir. The Arabs arrived and discussed the matter for some time with Shaikh Hamad in a reasonable manner, some advocated a compromise by which the G-overnment could retire a little Y/ithout giving in too much, others led by Yousuf Fakhroo demanded that the proclamation should be cancelled. Yusuf Kanoo spoke very strongly urging that the matter should be pushed through, Shaikh Sulman adopted the same line and Shaikh Abdulla maintained a neutral attitude. Everyone, including Shaikh Hamad, deplored the deliberate lies which had been told to the ignorant people and which were the main cause of the agitation. Suddenly, to everyone’s surprise a crowd of about thirty Manama $hias arrived in cars and came into the Majlis in a state of great excitement. They were mostly- 8 - mostly small shopkeepers and butchers, few of them were known to Shaikh Hamad personally. They were led by one Abdu All Alewat a second rate merchant who had previously caused a great deal of trouble in connection with the schools, and two brothers, Aulad al Tajar notorious mis chief makers. They surrounded Shaikh Hamad and began to shout at him and one of them produced a document which he claimed to be a petition from the whole Shia popula tion of Bahrain. Abdu Ali made a long and very violent speech in which he attacked the Government, the Shia Kadis, the schools, wakf department and other government insti tutions. In a very insolent manner^ loudly.applauded by his supporters, he demanded the immediate cancella tion of the proclamation and a guarantee from the Govern ment that never in the future would such legislation be proposed. The Arabs who had been sent for by Shaikh Hamad endeavoured to calm the Bahama, except Yousuf Fakroo who expressed similar views, but politely. The young Khalifah Shaikhs, who were sitting along the sides of the majlis, and Shaikh Hamad f s followers who were also present, were obviously furious at the behavour of the Bahama but as Shaikh Hamad made no attempt to call them to order it was impossible for anyone else to do so. Shaikh Hamad adopted a conciliatory and almost apolo getic attitude. He made a speech, which was repeatedly interrupted, explaining the necessity for the proclama tion. This had no effect. The talk went on for about an hour and then people divided themselves up into groups, some going outside and shouting together. One or two of the Arabs obviously encouraged the Bahama although through out the meeting their attitude was respectful. Suddenly for no particular reason, the position seemed to change and-9- , 1 * and in spite of my suggestion to Shaikh Hamad that he should not give a definite reply, he announced that the proclamation would be cancelled at once. The Shias however were not content with this, they demanded that the order cancelling the proclamation should be signed by not only Shaikh Hamad but myself and also the Poli tical Agent. Shaikh Hamad did not agree to this. The meeting then broke up and the Shias returned to one of the mate^ms in Manama where a great crowd was awaiting them. Proclamation cancelled. Before noon on the same day the proclamation was removed. But the bazaars did not reopen. They re mained closed the whole day, this time as a protest ag ainst the Agency because it had not also cancelled its proclamation on the subject. On the next morning a large crowd collected at the Government office, led by Yusuf Fakroo and Abdu Ali Alewat. Many of the men carried knives and revolvers apparently with the idea of rescuing their leaders if they were arrested. I interviewed Yousuf Fakroo, who protested that he was not responsible for the crowd, and gave him two copies of the new proclamation. A large deputation then visited Shaikh Hamad at Sakhir, but he refused to see them, however he sealed the copies of the new Alaan* On the following day the Agency issued an amended notice and the bazaars opened again. This is the first time that a deliberately organised strike has taken place in Bahrain, but I fear tnat it will not be the last time as it was such a complete suc cess.Fortunately no rioting or fighting took place. The Police, although faced with a difficult situation, be haved with great discretion and loyalty, which is more than can be said for some others who should have supported the Shaikh* This disturbance, the most serious that has ocurred since the Nejdi Persian riots, was not a genuine expression of public opinion. It was an example of the force of private intrigue and if the originators of the agitation had been dealt with firmly at the beginning none of the trouble would have ocurred.LAID DEPARTMENT. 32 Revenue in 1350 Expenditure Rs 8,080/- 18,513/- Work done during the year. £• Exchanges 3. Gifts 30 13 4. Titles * - 286 Land Registration . There is an increase of 181 registrations over the previous year and an increase in the fees collected of almost three thousand rupees. There is a slow but steady demand for the registration of titles, although this is not compulsory. The public appreciate more and more the advantage of holding a Government title deed for their property. Owing to the trade depression the value of land continues to decrease and the low prices obtained by sales have affected the receipts which the department receives from the registration of the sales. The greatest decrease in land values has been in the case of date gardens; house property in Manamah has not been affected so seriously. Besides registrations the Department has carried out a great deal of ?/ork in connection with court cases dealing with land, boundaries, water rights and divisions of property among heirs. A large nroportion of the cases in the Bahrain Court are oi this description and the compilation of reports and plans for the information of the court take up a great deal of time and often necessitates ieveral visits by the surveyors to distant parts of the islands. Land Settlement. The large village of KurzakhanLand Dept. 2- Kurzakhan and its gardens also Malehieh and part of Sadad have been surveyed but during the summer no survey work was done as most of the surveyors were on leave. Fish Tra ns. There are along the coasts of the islands about a thousand or fifteen hundred fish traps some of which are rented for a few rupees per annum, others for over a thousand rupees per annum. During Shaikh Isa f s rejime members of the Khalifah family levied indiscriminate taxes on these traps which were adjacent to territory over which they held feudal rights. Independent taxation was abolished when Shaikh Hamad became Ruler and the Civil List was instituted. It has been found that since then a number of people, particularly the Bin Ali Arabs of Hedd built fish traps in the sea with no right. To preserve the rights of the Covern— ment along the foreshore and the sea a proclamation was issued ordering all owners of xish traps to register them in the Land Department and to pay a registration fee of Rs l/~ per annum. The registration is no proof of ownership but will enable the Government in the future to examine the whole question. So far about 750 applications for registration have been received. In many cases the owners hold no documents for the fish traps, they will be required to prove their ownership by right of long tenure; others are in possession of documents for one or two traps but have erected more than the number specified on their docu ments, in such cases the ownership of the additional traps is not admitted by Government.Land dept. -3- The documents for fish traps usually mention boun daries which often include vast areas of sea and shore. The Goverhment has decided to consider that these boundaries are merely for the purpose of protecting the traps from being harmed by other traps in the neighbourhood, and the areas within the boundaries are not the actual property of the owners of the traps. There has been some opposition to this interpretation of ownership, which is undoubtedly the correct one, mainly by the Bin Ali tribe of Hedd who also claim, quite unjustifiably, that they were once given a promise by Shaikh Isa that they should at all times be exempted from all and any form of taxation, therefore they resent having to pay Rs l/- per annum on each fish trap. Khalifieh Estates and feudal r ights. A pro clamation was issued during the summer by Shaikh Hamad forbidding members of the Ruling Family to sell or mortgage their ancestral property. It was a necessary step as some of the Khalifah had already disposed of all their property at very low prices and having no longer any rents expected to be sup- uorted by Shaikh Hamad or the State. hon ! ble the Discussion took place between the/Resident and Shaikh Hamad on the subject of the Ruling family^ rights over 'Sehat' i.e., whole villages and districts in Bahrain gifted to them by Shaikh Isa. An agreement was arrived at which should protect the interests of the Bahama occupying land within the ft Sehat** and it was decided that the ancient family custom of the Khalifah should be enforced by which Tf Hibat !t , gifts, from the Ruler should be validLand dept. 4- valid only during the iig life of the holder of the gift, eventually the property should revert to the Ruler. Mortgages on property . A proclamation was issued after discussions with representatives of the public stating that in future no mortgages of immovable property would be recognised in the courts unless the holder of the mortgage was in possession of a Govt, title deed for the mortgaged property. At the end of the year a meeting was held to dis cuss the legal procedure in the case of mortgages. According to Moslem law a mortgage holder who has not taken possession of the property has no preferred claim if the owner of the property dies or becomes bankrupt. The opinion of the meeting was that such matters were entirely commercial and should not be referred to the Shera but should be settled by the Civil Court. The practice of the Bahrain Court is to admit the holder of a mortgage who is in possession of title deeds as a preferred creditor in bankruptcy cases.PUBLIC WORKS. Expenditure Rs 15,522/ll/3. Rs 7,139/- was spent during the year on the Manama Maharaq sea road mainly in constructing a series of islands made of marabba stone, with the two top courses laid with cement, on which the Electric light poles carrying the cable to Maharaq were erected. The southern wall of the road was extended some distance and a little filling in was done. It is unfortunate that the Government at the moment has no available funds for the Sea Road as the price of stone is abnormally low and at the present rate the whole road could be filled in for an amount which is roughly estimated at two lacs whereas a few years ago it would have cost more than double this amount. No other work of any importance was carried out with the exception of repairs to Government buildings, bridges and roads. Owing to the work done by the Bahrain Petroleum Coy. with a road sclaper on the Manama Rafaa road the Government has been saved the expense oi its upkeep and the result is most satisfactory.EDUCATION. There is very little to report on this subject. The schools, with the exception of the Shia school in Manama are flourishing and well attended and the year has passed without any serious disturbances such as ocurred in 1349. Eight schools now exist out of which two are for girls and the others are for boys, the total average attendance is 560 boys and 170 girls, but the attendance varies according to the time of the year. The two school councils, Sunni and Shia, who were sup posed to assist the Government in matters concerning Education but who actually impeded it on every possible occasion, have practically ceased to exist. The period for which they were elected has terminated and it is not proposed to revive their activities. The administration of the schools is in the hands of Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa assisted by the Inspector of Education, the latter being responsible for the routine and interior management of the schools. The Manama Shia School is the only one which is not doing well, the attendance of Shias is very small although there are 20 or 30 Arab Sunnis going regularly to the school. The reason for this is the incessant quarrels between the various Shia factions in Manamah and also the feeling among the Shias that the school should not be subject to supervision by the Sunni Inspector of .education As the Government of Bahrain is Sunni this attitude is ridiculous but unfortunately it has had the effect of reducing the attendance to about forty or fifty boys in a school which will hold 150 scholars. Encouragement has been given to the schools owing to the fact that the Government when appointing young men in the position of clerks or to any vacancies that occurEducation. -2- occur in the Government service invariably selects candidates who have been locally educated and who have obtained leaving certificates from the schools. Enthusiasm for games, especially for football, con tinues to increase and matches are played between the various schools. This keenness for games among the young men in Bahrain has only developed during the last few years. It has now become a definite part of life in Bahrain in spite of the fact that many of the older generation regard it as dangerous and un necessary and altogether undesirable, because, as they say, they never used to play such games themselves.MAMMAE MDNICIPAIITY. Revenue during 1350 - Es 62,000/- Expenditure n - Rs 61,400/- The programme of work for the year 1350 was limited owing to the uncertainty of collecting the revenue. At the end of the year a sum of Rs 7000/- is still out standing being owed to the Municipality on account of house and shop taxes. Mew Sea Road . The largest new work done by the Muni cipality during the year was the construction of a new main road running from east to west between the Sea Road and what was originally the edge of the town before the ground inside the sea road was reclaimed. This road cuts through the property of a number of different people including Government land, Mespers frontage, and the Amara of Abdurrehman Zayani, and H.S Shaikh Hamad’s property. In places where buildings were removed compensation was paid by the Municipality. Part of the road was across ground that had been pre viously reclaimed and part of it was across unfillea in spaces. Up to now about Rs 9000/- has been spent on the work but there remains a considerable amount of filling in to be done. This new road will benefit the owners of long strips of property lying between the town and the sea road which are at present mostly inaccessible except by narrow lanes running from North to South. At the same time three of these lanes, which were unhealthy water channels and receptacles for rubbish, have been filled in. Ray.aar widenin g. Motor traffic is now possible through most of the main bazaar streets though six years ago it was only possible to drive a car throughManama Municipality. - 2 - through two of the bazaars. A house was purchased and demolished to widen a road and a new house was built to compensate an owner whose property had previously been demolished for road widening. Sea Wall . A wall three feet high almost 200 feet long was built on the shore at Houra in order to re claim a large piece of ground, the property of the Municipality, which was previously covered by the sea at high tides. Lunatic As s vlum . The building was surrounded by a wall six feet high made of stone and mud. This insti tution is now used by Muharraq. as well as Manamah and it has been found to be very useful and necessary. Pier . A pier, built out into the sea, on the wes tern sea road was made as a place for dumping stones, mud, juss etc. in order to prevent persons from stacking such material on the road itself. A fee is being char ged which will eventually defray the cost of the build ing. Cemeter y walls . The stone walls, with gates at intervals, surrounding the Shia and Sunni cemeteries on the south of the town have been completed and the appearance of that part of the town is greatly improved and the graveyards are now free of dogs which used for merly to inhabit them and dig up the graves. Weights and measures . Tested weights and measures manufactured in England and stamped with the Municipal stamp and amount of weights in Arabic have oeen sold to the local shopkeepers, the old innacurate Y/eights have been taken in.Manamah Municipality. -3- Has. Rpuman Road, Four houses on the South of the Agency garden were purchased and demolished in order to start a road, which is a continuation of the road passing the Agency entrance from East to West and which will finally link up with the Manamah - Maharaq. sea-road. Fruit Market , A new fruit market adjoining the fish market was built by the Municipality at Shaikh Hamad f s expense on his own property. The floor is made of cement with facilities for sluicing over and the roof and sides are of palm sticks with cement pillars. This is a very great improvement on the old fruit market which was dirty and dark and which could not easily be cleaned. Manamah now owns good meat, fish and fruit markets which are cleaned daily and supervised by the Municipality. A pipe line laid into the meat market from a neighbouring well provides a supply of water for cleaning the floors and the tiled counters of the stalls. Public li g hting . 46 new lights were installed in the streets and bazaars. Municinal garden . The wall of the garden was repaired and cages were made to contain various wild animals, gazelles, jackals, a vulture and an oryx which form the beginning of a zoological garden. Poor boxes . Boxes were placed in the streets and bazaars and outside some 01 the mosques, 101 contri butions to the poor. About Rs 30/- was collected in this way in one month.Manamah Municipality, •*! General. A pump was eiected at the end of 1349 on the marsh ground at Kazabia which is used for remov ing the water into a drain which carries it to the sea. In addition to the above the usual town cleaning, repairs to drains, supervision of drain pipes and oiling of water surfaces as prevention of mosquitoes was carried out during the year. During Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa f s absence on the Haj Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa has acted as President of the Council. Towards the middle of the year the Majlis made a ten per cent reduction in the salaries of all persons employed by the Municipality. At the end of the year it was decided that the bazaars should remain open until three o r clock Arabic to enable people to use their shops and offices if they wished to. Previously no persons were allowed to enter or to be in the bazaar after sunset. In spite of bad times some building is being done by private persons mostly on the western sicie of the town in the neighbourhood of the new Eastern Bank. This area is likely to develop as a commercial district while the eastern part of the sea seems likely to re main a residential quarter.. - - - . * . *MAHAMQ MDNICIPALITY. Revenue during 1350 Expenditure Rs 37,122/- Rs 28,916/- The most important work in Muharraq during the year has been the extension of the electric power to the town and the electrification of the town and bazaars, but this is reported on under 'Electric* Apart from the usual routine work of cleaning the town, repairing water channels from wells and super vising drain pipes etc. very little new work was done. The Muharraq pier was enlarged and repaired and more of the creek at the side of the pier was reclaimed. A temporary hospital was opened for four months during the summer for treating foreign divers who come to Bahrain in great numbers and are frequently when ill deposited on the shore by their naukhudas with no money or means of supporting themselves. The roofs of the bazaar were repaired and raised in many places. During the month of Ramadan, as in Manamah, the Municipality made arrangements with the butchers for the sale of meat at a reduced cost. Muharr aq Nurse . In April 1930, on the advice of the Government, the Muharraq Municipality appointed an Indian trained nurse and midwife to work in conjunc tion with the doctor attending to women and children in Muharraq. Service of this kind was very badly needed both in Muharraq and Manamah as tne staif of the American women f s hospital is not sufficient to cope with the maternity work in Bahrain and owing to their religious work they are not admitted inuo many of the Aran and Bahama houses.Maharaq Municipality. - 2 - 4 The Municipal nurse was viewed for some time with suspicion out by degrees the people of Muharraq have learnt to appreciate her as is shown by the following statistics. 1930 April - December. Seccessful maternity cases - 35 Clinic patients - 4529 1931 Jany. Deer. Maternity cases - 39 Clinic patients ~ 6647 1932. Jan - April Maternity cases - 7 Clinic patients — - 1256 Total 2 years and four months - 85 maternity cases, and 12432 clinic patients. There is need for at least one other midwife of this type in Bahrain who can to some extent counteract the damage which is being done by the local midwives whose methods are in eYery way as bad, and in some respects worse, than those practised in India which were recently the subject of a book which caused universal comment.Agriculture. For financial reasons it has been impossible to start any new agricultural projects or even to sink an artesian well in order to make an experimental garden so the work of Mr. Said Abdul Noor has been extremely limited, owing to no fault of his own, and he has had to devote his attention to the Palace and Municipal gardens and to Shaikh Hamad r s garden, Sanayan. It is very unfortunate that he has not been given more scope as from the work which he has done, it has been proved that a number of vegetables which have a market value, and various different trees and cotton, which is most important of all, can be successfully grown in Bahrain. There is no doubt if money was available for the original outlay that a large experimental garden grov/ing fruit and vegetables and run on modern methods would in course of time become a paying proposition, but the expense of fencing, water production, and preparing the ground make it impossible to start such a work at present. The Ali experiment . in attempt was made in 1349 to start an experimental garden at Aali, on the site of the old landing ground. The water which was pro duced however was so strongly impregnated with sulphur as to be useless for irrigating cultivation and during the summer of 1350, the garden was abandoned and the fencing which had been put up was removed to Shaikh Hamad r s house at Sakhir. Possibilities at Zella g. A large area of country along the coast in the neighbourhood of Zellag was found to be very suitable lor cultivation and it wasAgriculture. -2- was supposed that it was Government property. Owing to the distance from Manamah it was not con venient as a site for an experimental garden but nego- ciations were entered with Abdul Aziz Kozaibi &amp; Co., who wished to buy a large area of ground in order to grow corn etc. The Government was prepared to sell 100 acres at Rs 15/- per acre with an option of a fur ther 400 acres at Rs 30/- per acre and a further 500 acres at Rs 35/- per acre making 1000 acres in all, subject to a stipulation that a proportion of each lot purchased should be put under cultivation within a definite time limit. The Kozaibis would not agree to these terms and as Abdul Aziz Kozaibi left Bahrain before any arrangement was made the matter is still in abeyance. It was afterwards found that H. E. Shaikh Hamad claims the whole of this area as his private property in virtue of a 'Hiba” gift document from Shaikh Isa. Palace Garden . This garden has never been a suc cess partly because there is more salt in the soil than in many other places and partly because there is, and always has been brackish water very close under the surface of the ground. For some time work has been done by a gang of prisoners who are raising the surface of the south end, which is the worst portion, by bringing in sand from outside the garden. Cotton was planted in this garden, but it grow very badly. It was rooted up and lucerne was planted instead. Two sowings of lucerne were a failure owing to strong shamal winds destroying the young plants. Lucerne is very susceptible to wind and needs a goodAgriculture. -3- good shelter when young. After two failures a com paratively good crop was obtained in some parts of the garden. In November California barley was planted in the northern part of the garden and this produced a suc cessful crop which is being kept for seed. This brand of barley seems to thrive well and is evidently suited to Bahrain. Various vegetable seeds were also sown in this garden with mixed results. Some of them partly succeeded, some failed to germinate and others died after germination. The reasons for the failures are attributed to.- 1. Excessive saltness of the soil, 2. High winds at time of germination. 3. Water by irrigation. The following vegetables have grown very success fully:- Beans, lettuce, cauliflowers, turnips, potatoes, beetroot, spinach, radish and a crop of linseed grew well in one part of the garden but failed completely in another part.
