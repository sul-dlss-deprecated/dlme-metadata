No: T/10 of 1905. Dated lltli June 1905. Fr.om, Major P*Z.Gox, OffPolitical Resident in the Persian' Gulf# To, S.M.Fraser Esquire, C#I.E, Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, SIMLA# Sir, In accordance with the instructions conveyed in your Telegram No: 2135-E#B. dated 5th instant, I have con sulted Sheikh Mobarek and have the honour to report the result# 2. In the first place the Sheikh stated that the idea of his maintaining a post on Bubiyan Island commended itself to him very much, but that he could not venture to carry out the proposal, if he had to sustain the undivided onus or odium which such a move would involve# He contin ued that he had already suffered so much from the retaliative amenities of the Turks, alike in connection with (1) the imprisonment of his A^ent, (2) the arrest of his 1 friends (5) interference with his Fao property, and murder of his employes; that he naturally hesitated to ^ive them cause for any further reprisals# If on the other hand it was quite understood, as I assured him I believed to be the case, that the British Government were prepared to inform the Turkish Government that they recognised his claim over Bubiyan and were ad vising him to institute or supporting him in institutinga post or posts there; then he, Sheikh Mobarek, was only too 3 lad to carry out the project* 3* Asked what form of assistance he would require from Government, he replied .(a) That Government should maintain a Political A^ent at Koweit (i.e. as a practical permanency) to ^ive him support and advice# (b) That Government should occasionally send a man- of-war to Koweit and up the Khor Abdullah# (cj That Government should defray the cost of the guards' quarters - estimated at Es 500/-, and of their maintenance @ Es 100/- per mensem# 4# At this juncture I produced the Chart and discussed the position and strength of the post. As to strength, he expressed the opinion that 10 men were sufficient for one ^uard and at any rate not more than 20# As to position, he strongly advocated 3 block-houses^ not one only# .(At this point I solicit reference to the n Sphinx r '’s Survey of the Khor Abdullah)# Ke considered the most important position to be on the Eastern-most point of Ras-al-Geit apparently about 11- miles North-East of the present Turkish Storehouse# This is strategically the most important point on the Island. The Khor Sabiya is not navigable on an ebb tide, and therefore all craft en route to Zobeir must pass the Khor Abdullah and a post at Ras-al-Gheit will be palpable to all. The second post he agrees mi^ht be on the North-East ernmost point of Bubiyan,South of the Eastern extremity of Warba Island, which he also claims# The third position to which he ^ .also attaches special importance would be the Jaziret-es-Soof or M Wool Island' one of the islands in the creek almost due east of Umkasr Post, and probably the Island shown on the top marginmargin of the M Sphinx , ' s Survey. Sheikh Mobarek claims that to this Island especially his claims cannot be disputed, as it has been used from time immemorial and still is, as a depot for the wool export of the hinterland, and all the wool merchants from Koweit proceed there regularly at certain seasons# I informed him that I had only been instructed to % discuss Bubiyan with him, and in that connection, one post on the liorth-East of the Island to balance the Turkish posts at Umkasr and A1 Gheit. He be^ed me, however, to communicate his complete views to Government# 5# As a matter of fact, instead of threatening to support Sheikh Mobarek in placing a post at the North end of Bubi yan to balance the Turkish posts at Umkasr and A1 Gheit, would it not be possible and at the same time more effect ive, and perhaps more logical, to threaten them with a block -house opposite A1 Gheit and another opposite A1 Kasr, e in order tc balance them? I su^ested to Sheikh Mobarek that if the Turkish and Koweit posts were, with regard to one other, within ran^e of si^ht and shot, would not friction be likely to arise, b^Ut he replied that this would not be the case, for as it was,the guards of the two posts were generally on their beam ends and dependent on his people for the necessaries of life- and this would always be the case. 7 V ^|^ 6# In the concluding sentence of your telegram under reply, I gathered that I am asked my views especially as to (i) The support which would be necessary to give Mobarek . absolute (ii) The / reservation of the right to send an Agent to Koweit from time to time. With regard to (i) Sheikh Mobarek did not make the slightest hint in tjie direction of a subsidy, and I imag ine suggested our defraying the .... small estimated cost or erection and maintenance (i.e. Rs 500/- for building andand Rs 100/- per mensem for maintaining each, post)^ more because it would ^ive Government a direct connection with, the project, than that the refund of the money was any object to him. The Sheikh has^however hinted once or twice before, that a subsidy would be acceptable, and if the present pro posals take shape, perhaps the present would be considered a convenient occasion for starting it. With reference to (ii) ; Sheikh Mobarek without any prompting from me stated unhesitatingly as the first con dition on which the undertaking should be put in hand, the British Government should keep an A^ent at Koweit, Apart from this, vjhen reading the opening vrords of the Secretary of State’s tele^reun in the present connection, it at once struck me that it seemed a pity that the open ing of ne^oeiations with regard to Bubiyan should be ad mitted in any way (to the Turkish Government) to hin^e upon the fact of the absence of our A^ent, which I trust is only temporary. Possibly I do not interpret the sentence aright and His Majesty’s Government have no such intention, 7, In conclusion,I would observe that it is difficult for me to advise satisfactorily as to the best position for the post or posts without acquainting myself with the fea tures of the ground on the spot, and it is also important that the T eEiret-el-Soof,mentioned in paragraph 4 ; should be identified and reported on, I did not think it prudent out to proceed there with A reference to Government, but if there is not considered to be any objection thereto, it would be convenient if I could be informed accordingly by telegram.

No: 1. Foreign Office to India Office. Foreign Office 9th August 1905. !&gt; I- have laid before the Marquesss of Lansdowne Sir, your letter of the 20th ultimo, forwarding a report from Major Co x as to the conditions on which the Sheikh of Koweit would be ready to establish a military post on Bubyan Island in the event of the Turkish Government fail- the ing to comply with the request for withdrawal of the Turk ish Post. You draw attention to the fact that Maj'ife/ Cox has ex pressed to Sheikh Mobarek his belief that the British Government will inform the Porte that they have recognised the Sheikh’s claim to Bubyan, and had advised him to ins titute a post there. In regard to this point Lord Lansdowne desires me to observe that, in my letter of the 22nd May last, no such announcement was at present contemplated. It was, on the / / contrary, proposed that it should be left to Sir N. Oconor^ cisC? discretion to decide on what stage he should maxe such an CLncC intimation, as it is clear, from His Excellency’s despatch No: 248 of the 17th April, of which copy was enclosed in my letter, that he was not in favour of any such step for some Lime to come. It appears from Major Cox’s Report that the Sheikh would i i !would desire to establish, not one, but three posts, two upon Bubyan, and one upon an adjacent island, that he would o expect His Majesty’s Government t# pay for the initial cost of their establishment, and for their subsequent maintenance and that he would desire the permanent residence of a Poli tical Agent sA Koweit, with occasional visits of a British man-of-war, no doubt implying that His Majesty’s Government A- would be responsible for defending him from any reprisals to which he might be exposed from the Turkish Government. Major Cox further suggests that it might be opportune on this occasion to offer the Sheikh an annual subsidy. You state in your letter that Mr: Brodriok .assumes that the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury will be prepared to pay a moiety of the financial assistance which the Sheikh will require, and that he proposes to sanction the deputation of Major Cox to Khor Abdullah, with a, view to the selection of posts, should the occasion arise. I am to state, in reply, that it does not appear to Lord Lansdowne that immediate action in the matter is at all ne cessary. It would, in his opinion, be expedient that, before any decision is tahen, the question should be brought before the Committee of Imperial Defence in connection with that of the eventual terminus of the Baghdad Railway, which is already under the consideration of that Committee..

Extract from a letter dated the 6th October 1905 addressed by the India Office to the Foreign Office, Lon don, (Received on 23-10-05 with Political Secy’s letter No: 40 dated the 6-10-05). x x x I am to enclose a copy of a telegram which has been addressed to the ''xovernment of India x x x giving instructions, in ca.se the report proves true, that Ca.ptain Knox should, if possible, reach Koweit before the German Engineers arrive there. Captain Knox is expected to recich Bombay about the 12th instant. Mr: Brodrick observes that your letter under reply deals only with the question of the action to be taken in the event of the report as to the German Engineers proving true. He would suggest, for the consideration of the Mar quess of Lansdowne, that Captain Knox should in any case be instructed to proceed to Koweit on his arrival in the Persian Gulf. This course appears to be contemplated in Sir N. 0’Conor's despatch of the 18th September No: 637, on the subject of the evacuation of Bubiyan Island by the Turks. A further reason which appears to make Captain Knox's presence in Koweit desirable is the arrangement reported in Sir N. 0’Conor's telegram of the 1st instant for the establishment of a Turkish Postal Official at Koweit. If the return of Captain Knox to Koweit is approved, Mr: Brodrick will request the Government of India to call his attention to the views expressed in Sir E. Gorst's letter of the 9th August as to the Policy of His Majesty's Government in respect to Bubiyan Island, and to the ins tructions on the subject contained in the telegram to the Government of India of 17th August last. \Received on 15-11-05 with Pol: Secy's lender No: 42 daned 20nh October 1905.
