B provision is made for possible landings of French military aircraft at Sharjah, Salalah and Maeirah. as regards Salalah and }yiasirah these places are, of course, in Muscat territory and H.H.G* have no right to promise the French any facilities there without the agreement of the Sultan. It would seem necessary, that this should be pointed out to the French Government. 3. as regards Sharjah, this Sheikhdom cannot correctly be described as 'territory owned, controlled or administered by British Authorities' and it should therefore, strictly speaking be omitted from the list of bases in such territory unless the definition js changed. (This would apply even more to e.g. Cairo and Habbaniyah and the other places in non-British territory mentioned in the lists of bases in Annex. B) As regards the right of H.M.G. to grant the French Government facilities for military aircraft at Sharjah it is the case (vide Residency memorandum No. 568-3 of ?th May 1946,) that the Sheikh of Sharjah has recently granted to H«M.G. the right to accord on his behalf such rights to foreign aircraft Which may fly over or land in Sharjah, as H*M.G. may consider necessary. The assumption was that this would apply to civil aircraft but this was not specifically stated and it might be regarded as applicable to military aircraft. I am not aware that H.M*G. have ever in the jbst past by formal agreement granted rights for the use by foreign military aircraft in peace-time of aerodromes in the &lt;u*ab Sheikhdoms, although it appears from the Ministry of Civil Aviation*s letter of 12th July enclosed with express Letter No. Jlxt. 4829/46 of the 18th July that the French have, until recently, been operating a Military Transport Service landing at Sharjah, and the tt.s.A.A.F. used the landing grounds at Sharjah and Bahrain during the war. The question will clearly need careful consideration and due weight will have to be given to the overall advantage^ of securing from the French Government the rights for the use of French military airfields which will accrue from the conclusion of the agreement proposed. 4* I should be glad to have your views on the points raised. The issue of the above has been duly authorised. 'X Sd/- F.A.K. HARRISHN.

You will note that this draft has been transmitted to the French Air Ministry, without prejudice, for their acceptance in principle prior to formal negotiation between the two Governments. The term^British Territory - will be amended to read 'territory owned, controlled or administered' by British Authorities' in the agreement when finally drawn up* 3. The scheduled services by French Military aircraft are shown in Appendix. B. 4* In Article IV a reference is made to official passengers. Since it is presumed that these officials will be non-fare paying passengers, it is suggested that a stipulation to this effect should be included in this Article. 5* In regard to Article VI it would seem desirable, as far as India is conwerned, to stipulate that a*H*^.(I) should be the local authority responsible for receiving notification of an giving prior pennies ion for flights, and not the Air Minietiy. 6 . In Article Xlll it is provided that the agreement should ne effective for a term of ten years. It is thought that it may be impossible to commit a future Government of India for such a long period of time 5 and that, as has been proposed by the Government of India in negotiations for -American air transit rights, the term should be limited in &gt;' the first instance to one of sic months or such a period as is considered desirable* I am.

This draft, which is now in a form as amended by the legal adrisers to bp the Foreign Office, has been transmi mitted to the French Air Ministry, without prejudice, for thiir acceptance in principle and any amendments they may wish to be included, prior to formal negotiations and ratification as between the Governments of the two countries, it is eiiiphasisikd that the term ’•British Territory'• used therein is intended to cover ‘•territory owned* controlled or administered by British Authorities 4 * &lt;£he agreement will be amended in tnis sense* A similar amendment would appear necessary in regard to the term *Frefcch territory 4 . b* The Air Council desire me to state that an agreement such as is envisaged would be of great value to the Royal Air Force and in connection with plans for Imperial Defence. They would regard as of considerable advantage the long-term right to fly over Metropolitan France, particularly in so far as i t shortens by nearly one thousand miles the strategic route for air reinforcements to the rfast* 4# while this draft agreement is under consideration by the French Air Ministry, the Council feel that the Secretary of State for India will wish to have the opportunity to consider it in relation to the ri*#it of French aircraft to fly over and use darports in territory for which his Department is responsible, and they accordingly invite any comments which the Secretary of State may wish to offer. 5.

Sultan in reply enquired under which Article of Air Agreement military aircraft other than R.A.F. could fly over or land in Muscat territory. 3. To Sultan's query a suggested reply is that draft agreement gives no repeat no general right to French to fly over or land in Muscat territory but merely to land in an emergency and that H.M.G. would if Sultan saw no objection like to accord this facility under Article 4 of the Muscat Civil Air Agreement. Sultan apparently considers that no rights to military aircraft can be accorded under Civil Air Agreement and I do not think that we can make our reply stronge Please telegraph if I may reply as suggested. •LB' GALLOWAYI 5 !&gt;tV' CONFIDENTIAL D.O.
