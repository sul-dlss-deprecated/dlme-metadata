(84533/1915) Promemoria. The Italian Government interested itself in the past in a scheme for the establishment of a network of small radio-telegraph stations in Persia, submitted to the Persian Government by the Marconi Company. The Italian representative in Tehran found the Persian Government favourably disposed to it at first; and the Italian Ambassador at Petrograd was also instructed to ask for the support of the Russian Government. Difficulties arose owing to the fact that the Marconi Company was at that time associated with the German 'Telefunken” Company and the Persian Government did not decide to grant the concession for fear, as it appears, of offending the susceptibilities of Great Britain and Russia, whose Governments were understood to have signified in 1910 that they were opposed to citizens of other foreign Powers being granted concessions in Persia which might injure their political and strategic interests. The Italian Government now point out that^consequence of the v/ar, the Marconi has broken off (inter-rotto) from last year all relations with the 'Telefunken' Company. In view of this circumstance and above all of the present relations between Italy, Great Britain and Russia, the Italian Government trusts that any reason which the British and Russian Governments had for opposing the concession of this radiotelegraph work to Italian industry may now have disappeared. The Italian Ambassador in London has accordingly receivedreceived instructions to address himself to His Britannic Majesty's Government in order that they may he good enough to authorise the British Minister at Tehran to support the Marconi Company's proposals with the Persian Government. Identical instructions have been given by the Italian Government to the Italian Ambassador in Petrograd to obtain a similar authorisation as regards the Russian diplomatic representative in Persia.

The Indo-European Telegraph Department undertakes that the station shall he so constructed as to he capable of carrying on directive duplex and automatic wireless telegraphy and shall he of such power that it will guarantee a service during periods of atmospheric disturbance. 4. The Indo-European Telegraph Department undertakes that the station shall he v/orked by the employees of the Department only who shall as far as possible he Persian subj ects. 5. The Persian Government shall have the right in times of emergency to take over and themselves work the station as a temporary measure. They agree in such an event to pay the Department a proportional indemnity for the use of the apparatus and for the loss of receipts thereby incurred. 6. The Persian Government agree to divide the nett profits with the Indo-European Telegraph Department according to a proportion to be agreed upon but should the departmental share fall short of a sum calculated at the rate of 6 per cent per annum on the capital expended by them the Persian Government agrees to make good such shortage. 7. The Indo-European Telegraph Department undertakes to construct and work on the same conditions sucn otner stations as the Persian Government may require in their territory south of the line mentioned in the first clause. And it would seem necessary to add a clause giving the Department a monopoly of the establishment of wireless telegraph stations in the British and neutral zones of Persia. Assuming3 Assuming that the high power station to he established in Persia will equal in power the wireless telegraph staions at Cairo and Poona its cost, exclusive of royalty, will approximate to £125,000, the interest on which at 6 per cent per annum amounts to £7,500 per annum. As a wireless service to and across Persia can hardly he expected to do more that divert a portion of the existing traffic from the existing telegraph routes it is difficult to see where a benefit to Persia comes in and it does not seem likely that the Persian Government will, when they examine the figures, he much attracted by the project. Moreover, it seems probable that the Department may find themselves at variance with the Indo-European Telegraph Company who may consider that their rights are infringed by the establishment of a competitive route but such a difficulty could probably be overcome by inviting the cooperation in the project of the other parties to the Cis-Indian Joint Purse agreement. It is not clear whether the Government of India will want the British Government to participate in the project sho\ild they so desire / it would seem necessary to ask the Poreign Office to obtain the consent of the Treasury to such participation. 3 K/U- t-L- &lt;/- Loll ft*. &amp;J C;From Viceroy, 15th October 1914.

Wireless in Persia We adhere to objections to grant of concession to Marconi Company whether it is a separate Italian entity or as would appear closely related to Telefunken Company. Apart from political objections to admitting Italy to interests in 1 wsia a high power station there might conceivably interfere considerably with Poona and ( airo stations. We therefore think that concession should be applied for by Indo-European Telegraph Department.

In the papers regarding the application of the Marconi Company for a concession to establish wireless telegraph stations in Persia the exclusive right of the Indo-European Telegraph Department to transmit telegraph traffic between Europe and India across Persia and between Europe or India and Persia is considered doubtful* Whether this^the case or not it seems quite clear that the Indo-European Telegraph Company^ position is unassailable and so long as the Department and Company work in harmony, Article 4 of the Company 's concession of 1368 is sufficient to exclude an intruder from participating in the transmidsion of such traffic. Tie Article reads:- 'The Concessionaire's line shall be exclusively used for the transmission of messages between India and Europe* The Persian Telegraph Administration shall hand over to the concessionaires fox transmission to their respective destinations all the telegrams by them received for India or for Europe”* So long tnerefore as the Company exercise the right they enjoy under this Article it is unnecessary oo invoke the Anglo-Persian Conventions in support of a similar right on the part of the Department. That the Company could be induced to abrogate t.nis right seems unlikely^but should they do so it seems to me that the terms of the Conventions are sufficient to give, if not an exclusive right, still, a right to the transmission of so much of the traffic ' crossin S Persia and from and to Persia that there 1 &gt;714. I. 1274. O00.—9/1913. [1603/12.] would be2 would be very little left for a competing line to transmit. Article XI of the Convention of the 23rd November 1865 reads 'All Indian messages at whatever part of the line 'and whatever place received shall he given over to 'tne second wire and the accounts regularly kept'. At the date of this agreement the Indo-European Telegraph Company»s line had not come into existence, hence the Department by this instrument became the agent for the transmission of telegrams from and to India across Persia, After tne completion of the Company^ line a new convention dated 2nd December 1872 was agreed to. The second naif of Article IV of this Convention, which has been renewed from time to time reads lie firso wire,viz., the one set up originally in '1864,shall be used for local traffic, while the second 'and third wires shall be used for international 'traffic ' and the last sentence of Article IX of tine same convention defines international messages thus 'International messages are those which pass over the 'wires of more than one State'. Since Indian and international messages must by the terms of these two Conventions be given over to the second and third wires there is very little traffic left for a competing agency to dispose of;certainly none that would give any return on the capital invested in a competing line. Even if an'exclusive right' is disputed by Persia, since India is in possession of one terminus our position is fairly secure, for a competitor would be only able to transmit outward messages as far as Persia. The monopoly of homeward3 . Of homeward traffic and of outward traffic from Persia to India would remain as at present. A competitor could, in the absence of British Indian goodwill, only obtain a footing in India in Portuguese or French possessions, from and to which the traffic would not amount to much. Should the Italian Charg&lt;£ d'Affaires at Teheran again presssthe Persian Government for a concession to establish by the agency of the Marconi Company a wireless telegraph station at Teheran the Secretary of State might I submit, press the Foreign Office to instruct the Britisl Minister to draw the attention of the Persian Government to the obligation they are under to hand over to the Indo-European Telegraph Company and the Indo-European Telegraph Department'all the telegrams by them received for India or for Europe”.DRAFT TELEGRAM.

Articles IV, V and VI of the Convention of December 2nd 1372 to establish a third wire lay down rules for the appropriation of the three wires when the third wire is completed and Article VII of the Convention of August 16th 1901 for the construction of the Central Persia line reads:- 'The line will be of three wires. One wire 'will be used by the Persian Telegraph Administration for 'its local work, and the remaining two wires be for international traffic as provided in Articles IV, V and VI 'of the 1372 Convention'.Although the exclusive right of transmitting messages between India and Europe over the departmental lines is not so clearly expressed in these conventions as it is in the concession to the Indo- European Telegraph Company it has always been understood that such an exclusive right exists.

W illi reference to my telegram No. 513 of to-day’s date, 1 have the honour to transmit herewith paraphrase of a telegram I have received from Sir Percy Cox upon the subject ol the steps which he considers should be taken to protect Jlntish interests in connection with a proposal said to be under consideration of the Persian Govern ment for the granting of a wireless telegraphy concession for the whole of Persia to the Indo-European Telegraph Company, which is under Russian protection in Persia. 1 have adopted this course, because the above-mentioned telegram is of such a lengthy nature that it would entail considerable expense to repeat it by telegraph, and because I am of opinion that there is no reason to anticipate that the concession will be granted without the sanction oi a Medjliss, since to do so would be to renounce the argument put forward by the Persian Government that no railway concession can, under the conditions of the constitution, be granted in Persia without the approval of the National Assembly. I would beg to add that I concur in the suggestions made by Sir Percy Cox, but I fail to see why he is of opinion that it will be unnecessary to discuss the question with the Russian Government if the representations made to the Persian Government suffice. If, as is certain, the Russian Legation here is cognisant of the scheme, I am of opinion that it is most desirable that I should discuss the matter with my Russian colleague, since the interests of a British administration and a Russian-protected company°are concerned. It would also seem to me desirable, as suggested in my above-quoted telegram, that I should warn the Persian Government that the proposed scheme has been brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Government, and that no action on it should be taken without ascertaining your views. I have, &amp;c. W TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox to Sir W. Townley. Bushire, September 10, 1912. (Telegraphic.) P. WIRELESS telegraphy. Your telegram No. 203, dated 7th September. It appears to me very necessary that some communication on the lines suggested should be made to the Persian Government. The two following points seem to merit attention :— (a.) Please see “ Aitchison,” vol. xii, pp. 82-85. The preambles to the telegraph conventions there given make mention first of regulating and then of extending and securing “telegraph communication” in general terms. We may not be able internationally to claim that wireless telegraphy, as well as wire or cable, is included in this, but the argument seems good enough for use with the Persian Government, in support of the claim that any extension of telegraphy in Persia must follow the basis of the existing position and the understanding between the Indo-European Telegraph Company and the Indo-European Telegraph Department. (b.) I he Indo-European Telegraph Company enjoys Russian protection in Persia, and comes therefore under the scope of article 2 of the Anglo-Russian Convention with regard to the British zone and of article 3 as far as the neutral zone is concerned. The most profitable argument w r e can use appears to me to be that it is obviously impossible to allow wireless telegraphy to work in rivalry with two organisations which [2619 gg 1]o already hold concession in Persia ; it must work in connection with them and form part of the systems at present existing. In this way, it must be recognised that the Indo-European Telegraph Department hold in virtue of their concessions an ex officio privilege to work wireless telegraphy in their own sphere in such places where it can be profitably introduced. ^ The Indo-European Telegraph Company will, of course, enjoy a similar privilege in their own zone, which we may regard in future as embracing any centres m Russian sphere of influence where the department are not already established. JNo concession or monopoly can advisedly be granted by the Persian Government which is calculated to prejudice the respective interests of the two organisations’ interests which coincide with those of the Persian Government, which annually receive a large sum of money from the receipts of the internal traffic. . ^ W( T lld 1 f e f n unnecessary to discuss the subject with Russia at the present juncture should the above representations prove sufficient. . fl uest ^ 0 ^ as .l° h° w far the issue now raised may tend to affect our scheme for wireless telegraphy m the Gulf must also be considered—we might explain to the ersian Government that this scheme is concerned merely with external and not with internal traffic and also what line we are to take if the tactics suggested above do not suthce to suppress the present application for a concession. If it can be suppressed, our best course would, I submit, be to continue to maintain silence on the subject of our installations at Bushire, Jask, and Henjam, meanwhile setting up temporary telegraphic installation without delay at Henjam pending establishment of a permanent telegraph station there. Should however, it be found impossible to suppress application, I would urge that the I ersian Government be warned that His Majesty’s Government intend to regard the wireless telegraphy installation at Bushire, as well as at any other Gulf port as arming part of their comprehensive scheme, which embraces both shores of the Gulf that His .Majesty s Government hold in that region special position in regard to telegraphy and prescriptive rights of control, and that they could not in any circum stances allow any other system of wireless telegraphy than their own. Should we be prepared to make good latter claim, it would seem unnecessary in either case to speak of our installations at Jask and Henjam.

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 45 of the 4th instant. After consulting His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire, I am of opinion that it is unnecessary to address the Persian Government at this stage regarding the establishment of wireless telegraph stations in the Persian Gulf. The only places where it is proposed to establish stations in Persia are Bushire, Henjam, and Lingah, and 1 undeistand that the Government of India are disposed to dispense with a station at the last-named place for the present. At Henjam we have our own concession as at Jask, and we have had a permanent wireless installation at the latter place for a year or more. No mention of it has been made by me to the Persian Government, and the Persian officials make frequent use of it. It is true that the case is different at Bushire, where we have no concession and the telegraph buildings are only hired ; still, there has been in operation for the past six months a small wireless installation erected by the navy at the Indo-European Telegrapl Department station, and no exception or question has been raised by the local authorities who have made fiee use of it themselves. In these circumstances to make a communication to the Persian Government at this stage would seem to be needlessly inviting objections, and I think that we may well proceed with the permanent installation both at Henjam and at Bushire without mentioning the matter to the Persian Government. Should the Governor of the Gulf Ports raise questions in regard to the station at Bushire and refer the matter to the Persian Government, we might explain to them that we are improving the existing installation to give better facilities in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic.

London, Your Excellency 30th November, 188G. Ox the date of 21st August last, the undersigned Companies had the honour to forward to China a telegraphic message hy which they informed Your Excellency that a conference had been held at Copenhagen between the two Companies, with the object of amalgamating their interests,! and of deciding upon a joint action with regard to their position in China. This position is partly based on the concession graciously granted by Your Excellency in 1881' to the Great Northern Telegraph Company, and in which the Eastern Extension Australasia and China 1 elegraph Company, Limited, have also been directly interested from the moment vhen, in 800 , at Your Excellency’s special request, in order to overcome the difhcuity created by their claiming certain rights granted by the Chinese Government through the British Minister in 1870, they were allowed to share the privileges of the Great Northern Telegraph Company, by the establishment of a duplicate Shanghai-Hong Kong cable, touching at Foochow. The privileges granted in the concession have unfortunately, on several occasions, been violated in a way which very seriously affects the interests and revenues of the Companies, and further violations are said to be^ con templated. In the annexed Memorandum the Companies have historically retraced the principal events connected with their establishment m China, and with the above-mentioned violations of the Concession. They now respectfully request Your Excellency to consider their claims, and they feel confident that your broad and enlightened views, yom lug 1 sense of justice, and your well-known zeal for the real interests and progress of China, will enable you to uphold the privileges granted by lour Excellency’s own hand, or at least to find means which may conciliate the interests of China with the Government's engagements to the Companies. The present managers of the Companies in China, Messrs. Ilenningsen and Judd, have, at another conference lately held in London, been fully instructed about the Companies’ claims, and have been authorised to negotiate * The exclusive concession granted to the Great Northern Company in 1881 by the Viceroy was not ratified. The Eastern Extension Company claimed that landing-rights had been promised to them in 1870. Ultimately landing-rights were granted to the Eastern Extension Company in 1883 and 1884. and to the Great Northern Company 1.1 1883-see pages 4- 4o, 40-51 and 45-48 respectively of the first annexe to Memorandum of Uah Octooei, 18Jj. The Companies amalgamated their interests in 1886, and sent the above joint letter of pro es to the Chinese Government. The British Ambassador at Peking was instructed hy the foreign Office to dve such support as he could properly afford to the steps which were about to lie taken by the Companies, with the view of obtaining the approval by the Chinese Government o t ic concession granted to the Great Northern Company in 1881. . c ,i i * i | F or a CO pv of the Joint-Purse Agreement between the Companies of the 1st December 1886, see No. IW.b 2 19 with Your Excellency m order to come to a satisfactory arrangement if possible, without appealing to the European Powers who are called to protect the Companies’ and all other European interests in China. We respectfully beg Your Excellency to place full confidence, as the Compames do, m the above-named persons, who jointly may act on behalf of either or both Companies, and who are penetrated with the same feelings of respect and sympathy for China which have inspired the Companies and all their actions in the Empire of the Middle Kingdom. 1 . In the year 1870 the Empire of China was not possessed of a single telegraph line, and both the Government and the people were perfectly unacquainted with this powerful agent which already, in Europe and Ameiica, looked upon as indispensable in political relations, in the service of civil and military administration, and for the progress and development of science, of industry, of commerce and navigation. 2 . Shortly before that time two Companies had been formed in Europe, with the object of introducing telegraphy into China. One was an English Company, whose present name is the Eastern Extension Australasia and China Telegraph Company, Limited; the other a Danish Company, whose present name is the Great Northern Telegraph Company of Copenhagen. 3. The English Company intended to connect the Chinese seaports with each other by cable, and via India (Singapore) with the system of English submarine cables, then being established from Europe to India, The Danish (Company also intended to connect the same Chinese seaports with each other, and via Japan (Nagasaki) with Russia and the Russian land-line system, which at that moment was being extended from Europe, through Siberia, to the Pacific (Wladiwostock). 4. Consequently, the two Companies were pursuing the same object. They would, however, have attained it by different routes, and the prepara tions of the Danish Company being more advanced, it was agreed between them that the latter Company should carry out the whole programme, whilst the English Company should not extend their lines north of Hong Kong. On the otherTiand, the cable between Hong Kong and Shanghai, laid by the Great Northern Telegraph Company, was to be considered a joint cable, the net revenues of which were to be equally divided between the two Companies. 5. In conformity with this arrangement Hong Kong, in the years 1870- 1872, was connected with Singapore and India by the Eastern Extension Australasia and China Telegraph Company, whilst the Great Northern Telegraph Company laid down cables connecting the ports of Hong Kong, Amoy, and Shanghai with each other, with Japan and with the land-line system, terminating at Wladiwostock. By these means China obtained two routes, one in the south and one in the north, connecting her with Europe and with all parts of the world enjoying telegraphic communication. 0. But the Companies did not consider their task accomplished by the establishment of the above-named cables, which put only a few seaports in China within telegraphic range. They also wanted to extend the telegraph lines to all the principal towns of China, which would have been of great benefit to the Imperial Government and the hundreds of millions of inhabitants of that vast empire. This task principally fell to the lot of the Great Northern Telegraph Company, then already established in two Chinese cities. We have, Ac., I or the Great Northern Telegraph Company, C. E.

Memorandum relating to China Telegraphs.20 Annexe J. 7. During the ensuing years the Great Northern Telegraph Company, therefore, endeavoured to spread the knowledge and use of telegraphy in wider circles, by the establishment of a land-line between Shanghai and Woosung, by publishing books and codes for the use of the Chinese public, by instructing Chinese natives in the manipulation of telegraph instruments, and by advocating the building of telegraph land-lines before all the Chinese authorities with whom they came in contact. 8 . Many years passed, however, before the authorities could realise the importance of telegraphic intercourse. It is true that, principally due to the want of quick communications, felt during the Japanese expedition to Formosa, the Great Northern Telegraph Company, in 1874, obtained per mission to build a land-line between Foochow and Pagoda Anchorage, and between Foochow and Amoy—but only the first of these lines was really established ; the latter, and much more important one, was prevented by the hostility of the population, and perhaps also by the antagonism of some authorities. 9. It was not until 1880, ten years after the landing of the first telegraph cable in China, that the Chinese Government ultimately decided to construct telegraph lines in the interior of the Empire. Under the pressure of the political circumstances then prevailing, His Excellency the Viceroy Li-Hung- Chang invited the Great Northern Telegraph Company to assist China in establishing land-lines. 10. The Great Northern Telegraph Company at once answered this appeal, and were entrusted with the construction of the long land-line between Shanghai and Tientsin, which was completed six months after the work had been commenced. This line was soon followed by extensions in different directions, and so quickly has telegraphy progressed in China since then, that the Empire, at this moment, is in possession of a large telegraph system, the benefit of which cannot be overvalued by the Government and the nation. 11. The services thus rendered by the two telegraph Companies, partly by connecting China by cable with the telegraphic system of the world, and partly by assisting in the establishment and organisation of an internal network of telegraphs, were duly appreciated by the Chinese Government. As a recognition of the services rendered, and in order to secure for China the same loyal and disinterested assistance in future, the Viceroy Li-Hung- Chang, in his capacity of Imperial Commissioner of Telegraphs, under date of 8 th June 1881, granted to the Great Northern Telegraph Company the concession annexed to this memorandum, the principal object of which was to prevent any divergence of interests from ever arising between the Companies and the Chinese Government. 12. The most important privileges contained in the concession are— (a) That the Chinese Government grants to the company exclusive rights for the cables already landed in China, and undertakes the engagement not to allow, within a period of 20 years, any other cable to be landed in the whole Empire. (b) That the Chinese Government undertakes the engagement not to construct, or permit others to construct, telegraph lines by land in opposition to any of the Company’s cables in China. (c) That the Chinese Government grants a preference to the Company as contractors for the establishment of new telegraph lines. 13. In return for these privileges it was stipulated in favour of the Imperial Government that certain State messages should be transmitted over the cables free of charge. 14. The perfect legality of the concession has been confirmed by eminent legal authorities well versed in Chinese law and customs. The following conclusion of an elaborate memorandum on the subject by Dr. F. de Martens, Professor at the Imperial University of St. Petersburg and Member of the Institute of International Law, may be cited :— (a) The Chinese Government is entirely free to determine the conditions under which it will establish and work its telegraph lines and submarine cables. No international treaty has up to the present invalidated China’s sovereign right in that respect.B 3 a 39798. (b) The concession, dated the 8 th of June 188], given by Li-Hung-Chane the Viceroy of Tientsin and Chief Commissioner of the^Chinese Telegraph Administration, to the Great Northern Telegraph Com pany, is a legal and valid document, and is binding upon the Central Government at Pekin. (c) The laying of a submarine cable or the establishment of a land-line vtithin the boundaries of the Chinese Empire, in violation of the above-named concession, should be regarded bv the Chinese Government as inadmissible and illegal. (d) The Chinese Government will always be liable to compensate the Great Northern Telegraph Company for any violation of the concession by the Government itself or by any local Chinese authorities. . 15. In the beginning the stipulations of this concession were con scientiously kept on both sides. With the assistance of the Great Northern Telegraph Company seveial important land-lines were constructed, schools for educating telegraph clerks were organised, and able teachers furnished several engineers of the company s staff were even finally engaged for the permanent use of the Chinese Administration, and the Companies had only friendly and agreeable relations with the Chinese authorities. These latter and even the Central Government at Pekin, freely made use of the gratuitous transmission of messages on the Company’s cables, a privilege which, at that time, during the recurring political complications, afforded a great saving to the Chinese Government, at the same time affecting to a ^con siderable extent the revenues, not only of the Danish, but also of the English Company, the latter being financially interested in the Hong Kong- Shanghai cable. 16 ; The Companies in the meantime were not blind to the possibility that the development of telegraphy might make the Chinese Government wish to obtain a more extended and alternative service between the seaports of China than the one performed by the only existing cable between Shanghai and Hong Kong, and as the Government, according to the concession, would not be entitled to satisfy such a want by the establishment of a land-line, the Companies sought a solution of this question which might be satisfactory to all parties. 17. With this view the Great Northern Telegraph Company in 1882, when a duplication of the Shanghai and Hong Kong cable appeared desirable, proposed to the Chinese authorities to effect this duplication, through the joint establishment of a land-line system between Shanghai and Canton (Hong Kong), connecting all the intermediate seaports. Their sole condition for assisting materially and financially in the execution of this scheme, was that a single wire should be at their disposal between Shanghai, Amoy, and Hong Kong when the cables were interrupted, and that the Chinese land-lines should not be allowed to compete with the cables between the said three ports, as stipulated in Article II. of the concession. 18. This friendly and practical scheme, which would have been very favourable to the interests of China, was, in October 1882, laid before the Viceroy Li-Hung-Chang by a special agent of the Companies, but unfortunately it was not accepted, because His Excellency did not consider the time had arrived for its realisation. The Companies were invited to carry out the duplication by the establishment of a new cable, and at the wish of the Government, expressed through the Viceroy, this cable was to be laid by the Eastern Extension Australasia and China Telegraph Company, in order to fulfil certain promises, which in 1870 had been given to the British Legation at Pekin. Permission was also given to land the cable at Foochow (Sharp Peak). 19. At the earnest request of the Viceroy the Great Northern Telegraph Company gave their consent to this arrangement, and the Eastern Extension Australasia and China Telegraph Company thus became partners in the privileges granted by the concession of 1881, and since then (1883) the companies have acted jointly in China, and have lately amalgamated their interests to a still further extent.22 20. Very shortly after the establishment of the new cable the Chinese Government entirely changed their views with regard to the coast-line scheme. In the commencement of 1883 a Chinese joint-stock Company was formed under the auspices of the Imperial Government with the object of constructing land-lines in China, and this Company made it a special object to connect the various seaports with Shanghai and Hong Kong respectively. 21. Fully confiding in the maintenance of the concession and being assured that these new lines would never be allowed to compete with the cables between the towns within the concession, the Companies did not hesitate to assist the Chinese Administration to the best of their ability in carrying out their scheme, the Eastern Extension Australasia and China Telegraph Company procuring for them the permission to establish a Chinese station at Hong Kong, and the Great Northern Telegraph Company assisting them with materials and engineering work. 22 . The confidence and friendliness thus shown by the Companies were not reciprocated ; on the contrary, as soon as the land-line was completed in October 1884, the Chinese opened their stations at Shanghai and Hong Kong not only for messages exchanged with seaports not connected by cable, but also for messages exchanged between the ports for which a concession had been granted to the cable Companies. As the land-line rates were fixed at the same figures as the cable rates, there could be no doubt of the open Annexe 2 . violation of Article II. of the concession. The Companies, therefore, pro tested against this breach of faith, and further sent a special agent to Tientsin in order to lay before the Viceroy the Companies’ justified complaint. 23. This step, however, did not result in the Companies obtaining justice, and the Chinese Administration even reduced the rates of the land-lines below those of the cables. The Companies coidd not silently submit to this flagrant breach of the concession, and on the 20th November 1884, they Annexe 3. sent to the Viceroy Li-Hung-Chang the annexed formal letter of protest, in which they reserved all their rights according to the concession, informing His Excellency that they were obliged, as a provisional measure, to suspend the free transmission over their cables hitherto granted to Chinese Government messages. 24. Already at that juncture the Companies might have taken more energetic steps as advised by the legal authorities above stated, but inspired by frif3ndly feelings, and being convinced that ultimately justice would be done by the Chinese Government, they decided to wait until the Government was more free from the political complications then prevailing, so as to give time to the Companies’ affairs. 25. Now as peace has been restored, and the mind of the Government is relieved from that source of anxiety, the Companies think that the time has come for the Government to consider their case in such a spirit as would ensure to the Companies the justice they are entitled to. It is impossible for them any longer to neglect the interests of their shareholders, especially as it is rumoured that new violations of the 1881 concession are being contemplated by the connection of the Chinese land-line system with the systems of neighbouring states ; if this were realised, messages otherwise traversing the Companies’ cables landed in China would then be carried over competing land-lines. 26. Besides the above-named very serious breach of the concession, other violations of the privileges therein contained have also taken place. The stipulations in Article III. of the concession have not been respected on the part of the Chinese, as many contracts for furnishing telegraph materials have been given to other parties, without having been submitted to the Great Northern Telegraph Company for tender, and contracts for which the Com panies were willing to tender lower than their competitors have even been given to other parties. Such has lately been the case with a contract for establishing a telegraph cable between Formosa and the mainland. 27. The wrongs which in this way have been inflicted upon the Com panies, are the more inexplicable, as all the contracts given to them have been executed to the full satisfaction of the Chinese authorities, in proof ofB 4 23 which it may be mentioned that the present Chinese Telegraph Administration ! oor ‘J 1011 ? 111 ' to 111 t 1 ; 611 interest, by a formal declaration of 3 rd January 158 J, to give the Companies the same preference as granted by Article III ol the concession, for materials required by them, whether on their own account or for other parties. The Companies have always furnished the verv best materials at the cheapest prices obtainable. In order to be able to execute any engineering work which might be required, they have kept a numerous staff of able engineers in China with the sole object of affording' assistance in the construction of land lines. In regard to payments they have, as a rule, given easier terms than could be obtained elsewhere and have even advanced to the Chinese Telegraph Administration large amounts of money, which have not yet been repaid. In short, nobody could have acted in a more zealous, friendly, and liberal manner. Annexe 4. 28. In consequence of all the above statements, the Companies respectfully beg to present the following complaints :— J I* ^ iat tl ie Companies who confided in the privileges of the concession have been induced to lay a duplicate cable between Shanghai and Hong Hong at a cost of 250,000Z. II. That the Chinese Government, regardless of Article II. of the con- cession, shortly afterwards consented to the establishment of a land line between Shanghai and Hong Kong in competition with the cables, thereby curtailing the traffic on the same and rendering superfluous the last laid cable. HT That Aiticle HI. of the concession has repeatedly been violated by the Companies having been deprived of contracts, which legally ought to have been offered and given to them. J 29. Referring to these complaints, the Companies consider themselves entitled to full compensation for the losses sustained by them through such violations of the concession, and further, to the strict fulfilment in future of all the stipulations therein. 30. Impressed, as they are, with friendly feelings for China the Com panies wish for nothing better than to be on good and friendly terms with the Imperial Government and to arrange their relations in a manner satisfactory to both parties. The Companies are therefore willing to negotiate about such modifications in the concession, and in their claims as the Government might deem desirable, and they have instructed their agents in China to treat on these questions with the representatives who may be appointed by His Excellency the Viceroy Li-Hung-Chang.

Copy of Translation of Concession Granted by the Chinese Government to the Great Northern Telegraph Company. 1 he respectf ul Petition of the Great N orthern Telegraph Company of Temnarh to His Excellency the Imperial Commissioner of the Northern Ports. May it please Your Excellency :— The Chinese Government being now about to establish telegraph lines we with regard to the intercourse with our Company’s lines, which ought to be clearly defined, humbly propose six articles, and solicit the Chinese Government’s gracious approval of these. Whilst the Company obtains the benefit of protection, China loses nothing of her rights and advantages. The Company now most respectfully petitions, as follows :— 1 . That the Chinese Government guarantees to the Great Northern Telegraph Company exclusive monopoly for the Company’s sub marine cables already landed on Chinese territory. Should the Great Northern Telegraph Company desire to land other cables in China, the consent of the Chinese Government must be first asked and obtained.24 Within a period of twenty years from date the Chinese Government will not allow any other company or any other person to land telegraph cables in the entire empire, including all foreign settlements and Formosa. 2. That within the same period of twenty years the Chinese Govern ment will not construct or permit others to construct submarine cables or telegraph lines by land in opposition to any of the Company’s cables in China. Where there is no competition, the Chinese Government will build lines at their pleasure. 3. That should the Chinese Government in future decide upon establishing new telegraph lines, preference will be given to the Great Northern Telegraph Company to do the work for the Government, providing their terms are lower than competitors’. 4. That the Chinese Foreign Office and the two Superintendents of Trade for the Northern and Southern Ports shall be entitled for a period of twenty years to exchange telegrams with the Chinese Ministers, Ambassadors, and Consuls General residing abroad, free of charges on the Great Northern Telegraph Company’s cables in China, Japan, and Europe. Whenever such telegrams pass over other lines not belonging to the Company, the Chinese Government pays all charges payable to these lines, and also whatever besides the Company has to pay to other administra tions. All such official telegrams must be authenticated by the seal of the official sending the same, otherwise they will be charged for in full. 5. That the Company’s cables being connected with foreign countries by two routes, namely, a southern via Houg Kong, and a northern via, Japan and Russia, the Chinese Government guarantees that, wdien land-lines have been established in China, all telegrams to foreign countries handed in by the public and emanating from these lines, shall, if not otherwise directed by the sender, be transmitted by the northern route, it being the quickest. 6 . That should hereafter any dispute arise, the Chinese version shall be considered as the authentic one. Should this our respectful and reverential petition be favoured by Your Excellency’s consent, the Company will hereafter not fail to exert all their strength and earnestly to work so as to merit the favour bestowed upon them by the Chinese Government.

In this connection it should be observed that, in a private Bill introduced into the French Chamber of Deputies in November 1900, with a view to the establishment of an extensive system of cables under French control, the opinion was expressed that the Tientsin Treaty of 1858 gave the French Government the right to land cables at any point in China where a foreign company had already landed a cable. It is not known whether this view has ever been put forward officially by the French Government, or, if it were put forward, what would be its prospects of success. The following is an extract from Article XL. of the Franco-Chinese Treaty of 27th June, 1858 : — “ II est d’ailleurs entendu quo toute obligation non consignee expressement dans la presente convention ne saura etre imposee aux consuls on aux Agents consulaires, non plus qu’ii leurs nationaux, tandis que, comme il a etc stipule, les Fran^ais jouiront de tous les droits, privileges, immunites et garanties quelconques qui auraient etc ou qui seraient accordees par le Gouvernement Chinois h d’autres Puissances.”37 whilst other traffic must not be exchanged by consent of China and of the Great Norther Copenhagen. this line except with the n T elegraph Company of VII.

IL—Convention for the Construction by China of Telegraph Lines for Corea. —17th July 1885.' :;: ' I. The Chief Superintendent of Chinese Telegraphs has received instruc tions from the Viceroy Li, Superintendent of Trade for the Northern Ports, to the effect that IBs Excellency had applied for and obtained the Emperor’s authority to consult with the King of Corea for the construction of an over land telegraph line from Chemulpo to Wiju, by way of Seoul, a distance of 1,130 li, to provide funds for this purpose, and to carry out the work with all possible speed, the expenses to be paid back by the Corean Government within a certain term of years, and the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Adminis tration to raise the funds, appoint directors, and conduct all operations on behalf of the Corean Government. II. Whereas the King of Corea has applied to China for funds for the intro duction of telegraphs into his Kingdom, the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration shall advance the sum of 100,000 Kuan-ping taels, which the Corean Government shall pay back after five years in twenty annual instal ments of 5,000 taels. The Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration shall also furnish a staff of experienced managers, apprentices, and mechanics, in order to provide for all contingencies and establish free communication between the two countries. ^ In consideration of the valuable assistance which the Chinese Telegraph Administration have rendered to the Corean Government by advancing funds for the introduction of telegraph lines into Corea, the Corean Government agree that, on the completion of the telegraph lines and cables, for a period of 25 years from the opening of communication, no other Government and no # The Corean and Chinese systems of land lines were connected in 1886, but the connection was destroyed during the Chino-Japanese \\ ar. E 2Company of another nation shall be allowed to construct telegraph lines for them on Corean territory, to the infringement of the prerogatives of China, and to the detriment of the interests of the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration. To avoid complications, if the Corean Government desire hereafter to extend any of their lines, the work must be undertaken by the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration. IV. In the construction of the line the cost of all Chinese and foreign materials and machinery, as well as the salaries, wages, and travelling expenses of all Chinese managers, and foreign artificers, clerks, apprentices^ and mechanics shall be paid for out of the fund advanced under this Convention, and an account kept of all such payments, but in order to economise the fund, all the native wood and native workmen that are required shall be supplied from the neighbourhood free of expense by the Corean Government on requisition by the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration. All necessary materials shall be imported into Corea free of duty. V. The work of the telegraph offices shall be carried on only by experienced clerks and workmen, and the Corean Government hereby agree to entrust the superintendence thereof to the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Adminis tration until the loan has been paid back in full, but natives of Corea shall be at the same time selected to serve an apprenticeship with a view to their gradually becoming efficient in telegraphic work. As the number of mercantile messages passing over this line will be inconsiderable, the Administration shall have their office and general expenses refunded on furnishing a monthly account thereof to the Corean Government. All official telegrams from Chinese authorities to the Corean Government sent to a telegraph office with the official seal affixed shall be forwarded free of charge. All other telegrams shall be reckoned “ mercantile ” messages. VI. As soon as the conditions have been signed under which the loan of 100,000 taels is made, the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration shall deposit the money for the Corean Government in the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank at Tientsin, and shall draw it as required for each portion of the line. When the work is finished the Telegraph Administration shall furnish an account of such expenditure to the Superintendent of Trade for the Northern Ports and to the Corean Government, and any balance that may remain shall be left in the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank as a fund for repairs, and shall not be used for any other purpose, the Administration keeping an account of the money until it is finished. When the balance is exhausted the expense of repairs shall be borne by the Corean Government. VII. As soon as the construction of the telegraph line is begun the Corean Government shall instruct the local authorities along the route to take charge of the materials and to stiictly prohibit all classes from inj urmg or obstructing the works. Any offences of this nature shall be reported by the managers of the telegraphs to the Corean Government, and severely punished, to secure the protection of the line in future. VIII.

Whereas the Corean Government propose to extend their telegraph line to Fusan, and have no telegraphic experts of their own, and whereas the 3rd Article of the original Convention of 1885t provided that for a period of 25 years from the date thereof any additional lines that the Corean Goven- ment desired to construct should, to avoid complications, be undertaken by the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration, the Superintendent of Trade for the Northern Ports has, upon application from the King of Corea, authorised the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration to construct this line to Fusan, also on behalf of the Corean Government. In order to meet the difficulty of the Corean Government in providing funds, it is proposed that the surplus of the sum of 100,000 taels advanced by the Imperial Chinese Telegraph xkdministration, which remained after the construction of the Seoul-Wiju line, and which was originally deposited in the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank as a fund for repairs, shall be applied to the construction of the line to Fusan. On the completion of the work the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration shall draw up an account of the money thus expended, and forward it to the Superintendent of Trade for the Northern Ports and to the Corean Government. The Corean Government shall repay the money, as originally agreed, within a certain number of All the Chinese and foreign materials required for the construction of this line, as well as the salaries, wages, and travelling expenses of all Chinese officials, clerks, and mechanics, shall be duly accounted for and paid out of the afore-mentioned fund ; but all Corean materials and Corean workmen shall, in accordance with the original agreement, be provided immediately * For copy of Convention between China and Corea, see No. II. f No - U* A 39798.

All the materials imported into Corea for this purpose shall be duty free, and all the personal effects of the officials and workmen of the Telegraph Administration shall likewise be exempted from the payment of duty. IV. Three additional offices shall be erected between Seoul and Fusan, and the officials, clerks, and apprentices shall all hold their appointments from the Chinese Administration. The Corean Government, for their part, shall appoint in each office an official to superintend the Corean apprentices and the local patrols, and shall provide two apprentices, who shall relieve each other in study. When these apprentices have attained proficiency in their work, they shall be examined by the Chief Superintendent of the Imperial Chinese Telegraphs, and a report shall be forwarded to the Superintendent of Corean Telegraphs, who will then confer appointments upon them as he may deem fit. Until such time as the loan has been repaid in full, all the affairs of the telegraph offices shall be directed by the Chinese officials, subject to the supreme control of the head office at Seoul.

V. — Convention by which China sanctions the Construction by Corea of an Overland Telegraph Line between Seoul and Fusan. —17th April In accordance with the original Convention the line to Fusan ought to be constructed by the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration. Now, however, inasmuch as certain Corean subjects have undertaken to assist their Government to find materials and construct the line themselves, and inasmuch as these individuals are a corporation of Corean officials and merchants, and the arrangement is therefore not tantamount to a concession to another Government or foreign company for the construction of the line on behalf of Corea, thereby encroaching on existing rights, the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration, recognizing that no infringement of the original regulations is involved, hereby sanction the construction of the line by the Corean Government themselves. The Imperial Chinese Telegraph Adminis tration, however, will permit no other Government to encroach upon their prerogatives by constructing telegraphs on behalf of Corea.71 n. Four offices shall be established between Seoul and Fusan under the charge of officers appointed by the Corean Government. One foreign artificer may be temporarily employed to set up the line, but on the pom- pletion thereof, the services of a foreign employee of the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration shall be applied for to take care of the line. The clerks and apprentices in every office shall be either Coreans or Chinese, and no subjects of another nationality may be employed in such capacity. III. Should the Corean Government desire to construct any branch line within the period of 25 years from the date hereof, the construction of such line shall, in accordance with the original Convention, be undertaken by the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration. The Corean Government may construct lines themselves only with the express permission of the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration, and no other government shall be allowed to avail themselves of the privilege of such an undertaking or to share the profits thereof. IV. The telegraph line to Fusan, although constructed by Corea, shall, in accordance with the original regulations, remain under the control of the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration, but the cost of transmission of messages and of salaries and wages, at the four telegraph offices shall be defrayed by the Corean Government. An account thereof shall be forwarded from time to time to the Chinese Administration for preservation in their records. V. On the establishment of the Corean Telegraph Offices on the Fusan line, the regulations for such offices and the tariff for telegrams shall be decided on in consultation with the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Adminis tration, without detriment to the prerogatives and profits of the Chinese telegraphs. VI. After the construction of the Fusan line, should the terms of the original Convention be contravened, or the prerogatives and profits of the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration be infringed upon, the Corean Telegraph Administration shall, on being notified thereof by the Impel lal Chinese Telegraph Administration, immediately issue injunctions and enforce penalties against such offenders. VII. Chinese official messages shall be transmitted free of charge. 25th day of 3rd month of 13th year of Kwang-su. VI. Convention with China regarding the Telegraph Line to Gensan (Wonsan). —24th March 1891. I. According to the original Convention of the year 1885,respecting the introduction of telegraphs into Corea, under which it was arranged that China should establish the lines and cables, the telegraph line to Gensan should be administered by the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration Now however, that the Corean Government request permission to establish it themselves, extra consideration must be shown to their wishes and the matter dealt with in an accommodating spirit. It behoves Corea also to72 conform to all provisions in the Agreement that secure advantages to the Chinese Administration, and to avoid encroaching on their profits and privileges. II. The Third Article of the original Agreement provides that for a period of 25 years from the date thereof no other government or foreign company shall he permitted to construct telegraph lines on Corean territory, and the First Article of the Fusan Agreement* states that no such permission shall ever he given to another country. The present line to Gensan must of course he governed hy these conditions, and must not be connected with any foreign cable or telegraph line, nor may its messages be transmitted to any neighbouring cable or line belonging to another country. m. As soon as the line shall have been completed at Ch’un-ch’uan, Gensan, and Hamheung, the regulations and tariff shall be decided on in consultation with the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration, as laid down in Article V. of the Fusan Agreement, without detriment to the interests of that Administration. IV. The Fusan Agreement contained a provision that, although the Fusan telegraph line was constructed by Corea, it should be under the control of the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration. This provision shall also apply to the Gensan line, and the control shall not be one in name only, but a reality. A memorandum of the expenses of maintaining offices, the messages passing over the line, and salary payments, shall be drawn up monthly and forwarded to the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration. Should the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration discover anything at variance with the reports from the Corean offices, the Administration shall be at liberty to enforce a maximum penalty. V. Under the original Agreement the Corean Government provided labour and materials for the construction of the telegraph lines, and the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration incurred no expense in connection with them. Now that Corea is making a line to Gensan, the increased extent of her telegraphs must not be made a pretext to evade pre-existing responsibilities. Deficiencies in the telegraph posts on the Chemulpo-Wiju line shall be made good from time to time in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, and strict orders shall be issued to local officials to supply the number required within a month from the date of requisition in each instance. The local officials shall also be enjoined to supply labourers and post horses whenever required at the shortest notice. VI. Chinese official messages shall pass free over the Gensan as over the Fusan line. VII. The construction of this line to Gensan is permitted to the Corean Government as a special mark of consideration. Any new line which may be constructed hereafter, or any branch line which may be added to existing ones, shall always be dealt with according to the Third Article of the Fusan Agreement. On all remaining points which have not been covered by this Agreement, action shall be taken in accordance with both the Seoul-Wiju and the Fusan Agreements. VIII. The Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration receive from the Corean Government an annual subsidy of 5,000 Hsiang-p’ing taels payable in ten * No. IV,73 instalments during the first ten months of every year, towards the main tenance of the offices at Seoul, Chemulpo, P’mg-yang, and VVyu. Hereafter this subsidy shall he paid in full and without delay at the beginning of each month. Any violation by the Corean Government of the provisions of this Supplementary Agreement or of the original Agreement, within 25 years from the date hereof, shall be met with a penalty the severity of which shall be at the discretion of the Imperial Chinese Telegraph Administration. VII.— Connection between Land Lines in China and Corea. Draft Convention between two Governments.' 1 ' Article I.

Article IV. The cable or cables will have to be laid and working under good con ditions of transmission within the term of one year, to be computed from the date of the Concession. Should they fail to be laid, or result useless for giving the service in the term aforesaid, the Concession shall be held as lapsed and without any value or effect. In the event of such conductors becoming useless in the term of duration of the contract, the undertaking binds itself to replace them so that the communication may be ready in a like term of one year. Article V. The service and preservation of the line in the Spanish possessions shall be made by the Administration of Telegraphs of the Government, which shall name the employees necessary for such purpose; and the cost thereof shall be for account of the Company, which shall pay for it by making delivery thereof in the respective Treasury Office. The salaries shall be fixed according to the tenor of those which are assigned in estimate to functionaries of the said department and by agreement with the Company. Article VI.

These latter shall be handed over to the Company when proper, previously deducting the expenses of the official administration and those of preservation and repair that may have been incurred. In any case this Concession shall be understood as lapsed should the total interruption of the service on the part or the Company exceed 14 months.

Given in the Palace on the 5th December 1866. It is rubricated of the Royal hand. The Minister of “ Ultramar ” (Colonies), Alejandro Castro. II.— Modification of No. 1, 1867. Having regard to the reasons stated by the Minister of “ Ultramar ” ^^Seen^the 1st Article of the Decree of the 5th December 1866 whereby the permission provisionally granted by Royal Order of the previous 19th of June to Mr. William Smith, representative of the International Oceanic Telegraph Company, for fixing in a spot in the island of Cuba the end of the submarine telegraph cable which has to start from the coast of Ilonda, in the United States, was converted into a definitive one. Seen the 2nd Condition of the General (Conditions) approved by the Decree of the 26th of February last, for the establishment and working of submarine telegraphic cables between the islands of Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Canaries, and between the first of them and Mexico, Panama, and the coasts of the South American Continent. Seen what is prayed under date of the 2nd March 1867 by the represen tative of the aforesaid Company. Considering that there is no reason for establishing differences of time between permissions emanating from one and the same Government when once the general submarine telegraph line is planned which is to put into communication the new and old continent, uniting our colonial possessions9 » 79 in the western regions with the cables which start from Europe, whether starting from the peninsula or leaving England to touch in the United States and arrive by Florida at the island of Cuba, the whole being subject to a common term of 40 years as a definitive concession for mooring such apparatus in our coasts and jurisdictional seas. ^ Considering that in this view is to be understood and fulfilled the 1st Article of the aforesaid Decree of the 5th December 1866, in order that at no time is the period of duration of the Concessions which are made and refer to the cables of Cuba to Puerto Rico and the Canaries and to Mexico, Panama, and the coasts of South America, to be greater than that of the permission granted to the International Oceanic Telegraph Company, I resolve to decree as follows :— Article I. The permission to moor on the coasts of the island of Cuba, the submarine telegraph cables to which reference is made in the 1st Article of the Decree of the 5th December 1866, shall be deemed as a definitive Concession made for the term of 40 years in favour of the International Oceanic Telegraph Company in the same terms as the 2nd Condition of the General Conditions of the 26th February last lays down for those who may have to be concession aires at the meeting authorised by the Decree of the same date. Article II. For the purposes of the fulfilment thereof the Concession of the Decree of the 5th December 1866 shall be understood to be modified in the sense of the foregoing article. Given at the Palace on the 13th of May 1867. It is rubricated with the Royal hand. The Colonial Minister, Alejandro Castro. HI.— Cables between Ceba and Porto Rico and between Cuba, on the one hand, and Mexico and Central and South America, on the other hand (Cables between Cuba and Jamaica and between Porto Rico and Jamaica laid in 1870, 1874, and 1878), 1868. (Concession held by West India and Panama Telegraph Company, granted by Spanish Government in 1868.) Schedule of Conditions for the establishment and working of submarine telegraph cables between the Islands of Cura and Porto Rico, and between the first of the said Islands and Mexico, Panama, and the Coast of South America. Article I. The Company, or individual, who may undertake this service will be bound to lay down and work, at his own expense, submarine telegraph cables between the Islands of Cuba and Porto Rico, and between the first of them and Mexico, Panama, and the coasts of the South American continent. Article II. The undertaking will make use of the telegraphic line for the objects of its service during 40 years, within which period no concession can be granted for the establishment of other lines between the points mentioned in Article I. When the said term shall have elapsed, the Government shall be at liberty to confer permissions for laying down such new lines as may be solicited, the Company continuing to exercise the right of working their own line. Article III. As well individuals soliciting the same on their own account as any whatsoever of the different firms recognised by law may, under the opportune designation, become Contractors for this service.80 Article IV. In case of one or more individuals becoming concessionaires, or making a transfer of their rights and obligations to any whatsoever of the firms or companies authorised by law, whether or not they be founders of the same ; if the personality subrogated be a Company of limited liability (anonima), or commanditary in shares, the domicile of such Company shall be established in the Island of Cuba, and its directors or administrators shall be appointed by the Government out of lists of three names proposed by the Company so bound. The Government, when it shall consider convenient, may refuse to accept any of those proposed, and demand fresh ternaries of names. * Article V. In case of the Contractor establishing his residence outside the said island, he shall have at Havannah a person competently authorised, who may represent him in all matters to be treated of in respect to the present service. Article VI. The Contractor shall not be able either to transfer or alienate this service without the previous authorization and approbation of the Government. Article VII. The traject or line of transit of the cables which must accomplish the object of placing the said islands in perfect telegraphic communication, between themselves and with the points indicated, is left to the choice of the Company, which shall construct for that purpose such land lines as may be necessary to effect the union of the cables. Should such lines erected at the cost of the Government be already in existence, the Company may add thereto the necessary wires for their own service, after obtaining the proper official authorisation. Such portion of the line as it may be necessary to construct in Spanish territory in order to connect the submarine cables with the land stations or with other telegraphic lines, cannot be employed in the transmission of telegrams unless for the private service of the Company between two points of the said territory, whenever previously acquired privileges shall be opposed thereto. Article VIII. The cables uniting Cuba and Porto liico must be laid down and working under perfect conditions of transmission in the term of two years, to be counted from the date of concession. The said term shall be three years for those to be laid down between Cuba and the American Continent. Should they not be so laid down, or if on account of causes for which the Company is responsible they should be found ineffective for the performance of the service in the periods referred to, then the said concession shall become null, and the deposit referred to in Article III. of the Royal Decree of this date shall be forfeited by the Contractors. Should it be proved that the said causes originated through breakages in the cables or inevitable accidents occurring during the immersion, the terms fixed in the preceding paragraph shall be prolonged for the space of one year. In the event of the conductors being rendered useless from causes independent of the Company during the term of duration of the contract, the said Company binds itself to replace them in such a manner that the communication shall be renewed within a term not to exceed one year. This term having elapsed, the concession shall be held to have become void. Article IX. The service and preservation of the line within the Spanish dominions shall be performed by the Government Administration of Telegraphs, which shall appoint the requisite employees for that purpose in conjunction with the81 9 Company, and the cost thereof shall he debited to the same, which shall reimburse said expenses by monthly payments into the respective Treasury. The salaries shall be fixed according to the scale of those assigned in the estimate for officials employed in this branch of service at the places where the same is performed, likewise in harmony with the Company. Article X. The Company shall provide the necessary apparatus for the cables, and shall have power to change or modify the same as it may think proper. Article XL The transmission of official correspondence throughout all the branches of the service, that is to say, Government despatches, despatches addressed to the Government by the Captains-General, Superior Civil Governor of the Antilles, and Her Majesty’s representatives residing in countries touched by the line, together with those despatches which pass between the said Governor and Captains-General, and between these and the said repre sentatives of Her Majesty, shall be obligatory, gratuitous, and preferential upon the Company; no inspection of any kind shall be exercised of its contents, and a private key or cypher may be employed for the same. The private correspondence of Spain and her possessions shall enjoy the same advantage as to priority and cost as may be possessed by those^ nations most favoured in this respect should differences in any case be established. Article XII. The superior authorities in Spanish possessions will have the right to inspect every description of correspondence, and shall be able to refuse the forwarding of despatches, whether presented for transmission or received by the line, whenever the contents thereof shall be contrary to morality or prejudicial to the security of the State or to public order. As a consequence of this measure, cyphers or secret keys are excluded from all correspondence of a private nature. Article XIII. Such questions as may arise between the Administration and the Company shall be decided without the intervention of the Governments of other countries, and by those forms of procedure which the existing regulations may establish for the due interpretation and effect of public service contracts in Spain.

Ministerial Department of the Colonies. I have brought to the attention of His Highness the Regent of the Kingdom the paper with which you presented to this department the memorial signed on the one part by Don Jose de Caceres, as agent of William F. Smith, concessionaire of the telegraphic cable from Santiago de Cuba to the Havana, and on the other part bv the India-Rubber, Gutta- Percha, and Telegraph Works Company, and the Cuba Submarine Telegraph Company, in which approbation is sought for the transfer made by the said Smith to the last-mentioned Company of: the Concession granted in his favour by Decree of December 31st, 1869, for the establishment of a telegraphic submarine cable from Santiago de Cuba to the Havana, landing at Cienfuegos, Cochinos Bay, or Batabano, one of the three points at his choice. As well also the petition to amplify said concession permitting the Company to land its cable at various points on the coast. In view of these papers, His Highness has been pleased to resolve : — 1. That seeing that by the documents which accompany this instance the transfer appears to have been effected in good and due form, and also it appears that the Cuba Submarine Telegraph Company is legally constituted and has at its disposal the funds necessary to carry out the enterprise, the * * These conditions are exactly the same as those attached to the Concession (held by the West India and Panama Telegraph Company) granted in the previous year. See No. III. F 284 said transfer is approved, and the Cuba Submarine Telegraph Company is recognised as the concessionaire of the cable in question. 2 That taking into account the convenience and necessity of arranging in common accord with the Company, as well the tariffs as whatever relates to the establishment, service, and working of the cable, and m the use ot the faculties reserved to the Spanish Government by the list of conditions of May 28th, 1868, the Company will proceed to appoint within the term of one month a representative in Madrid, and in that of two months another in Havana, with powers sufficient for all the objects before mentioned. 3. That with respect to landing at more than one of the three points designated in the decree of concession, said petition is denied, considering thaUhe sole object of the cable in question is to put in connection that of the West India and Panama Telegraph Company and that of the International Ocean Telegraph Company, and in no wise to perform a local service which ouo-ht to be performed always by the telegraphic lines oJ the Government. &amp; By order of His Highness, I communicate it to you for your information, and that of the Company referred to.

The obligations which the Indo-European Telegraph Company is subject to, in accordance with the concession granted by the Royal Prussian Government on the 2Cth August 1867, remain in force, with the exception of the stipulations contained in Articles 8 and 9 of the said concession. 2. The Indo-European Telegraph Company, from their share of the joint revenue accruing to them, according to the above-mentioned Joint Purse Agreement, for the transmission of telegrams from Europe to India and trans-Indian countries, and vice versa, over the lines of the Eastern and Indo-European Telegraph Companies, from the date of the entering into force of the Joint Purse Agreement, pay 5*34 %&gt; but not less than Fc«.110,000 per year, to the Imperial German Telegraph Administration. This percentage represents the share of the receipts that have been received by Germany during the year 1876, from the total receipts of the Indo- European Telegraph line. This revenue of the Indo-European Telegraph line is thus calculated, that from the total revenue falling according to the international tariffs upon the section London-Bushire, there have been deducted the royalty to Persia ; further, the share of the Indian Admiuis- tration of a moiety of the Persian surplus ; and, lastly, the yearly payment to the English General Post Office (of the receipts so remaining 5'34 % fell to Germany, 6 - 27 % to Russia, and 88*39 % to the Indo-European Company). In calculating the German proportion in future, the same principles shall be observed. The settlement of the accounts takes place quarterly. 3. On demand of the German Telegraph Administration the calculation and payment of the German tariff proportion must, from any moment, be proceeded with in accordance with Articles 8 and 9 of the concession of the 26th of August 1867, relinquishing the mode of calculation. 4. So long as the mode of calculation indicated in paragraph 2 is applied, the Indo-European Telegraph Company permits the Imperial German Telegraph Administration, or the persons instructed by them for that purpose, to inspect the books of the Company. 5. The Indo-European Telegraph Company pledges itself to endeavour by all means at its command to bring about, in the forms and periods given in Article 17 of the Draft submitted, all modifications of the Agreement between the Indo-European and the Eastern Telegraph Companies which may be desired by the Imperial German Telegraph Administration. I respectfully request the Direction to kindly acknowledge the receipt of this communication. Stephan. Indo-European Telegraph Company (Limited). Memorandum in reference to the arrangement come to by the Indo-European Telegraph Company with the Imperial German Government in the year 1877, concerning the method of payment and the amount due by the Company under its Concessions, and the basis arrived at for such payment. I. The Company’s concession of 1867 remains in force with the exception of stipulations contained in Articles 8 and 9. II. The Indo-European Telegraph Company pays to the Imperial German Government 5'34 7o their share from the Joint Burse, an arrangement entered into with the Eastern Telegraph Company, and subsequently joined by the Indo-European Telegraph Department, in respect of messages from Europe to India and Trans-Indian countries, and vice versa, such payment, however, not to amount to less than Fes. 110,000 per annum. III. As a basis for this payment, the traffic passed over the Indo-European line during the year 1876 was taken, as shown in the return attached hereto. IV. The settlement of accounts takes place quarterly.V. If the Imperial German Telegraph Administration demands it, the German tariff proportions under Articles 8 and 9 of the concession must at any time be resumed. , , „ . . r • i YI As long as the present method of payment is in mrce, the Imperial German Administration may appoint any of its officials to inspect the Company’s books at any time for the purpose of verifying accounts. VII ‘The Indo-European Telegraph Company, having regard to Article 1/ of the Joint Purse Agreement of the year 1877, undertakes to endeavour to brino- about any modifications of the Joint Purse Agreement between the Indo-European 'Telegraph Company and the Eastern Telegraph Company which may be desired by the Imperial Administration. The negotiations leading up to the above settlement were concluded in September 1877. II. —Germany, Azores, North America, 1900. [Memorandum fuvuished by British ( ousul-(jenevcil at llambu) g.] The “ German Atlantic Telegraph Company ” (Deutsch-Atlantische Telegraphen Gesellschaft) which has its chief seat in Cologne, and was founded with a capital of 1,000,000L on 27th February 1899, took over the concession (with all the liabilities and privileges connected therewith) granted on 28th May 1899 by the German Government to Messrs. Felten and Guillaume of Muhlheim am Ruhr for landing and working for a term of 40 years a Telegraph Cable between Germany via the Azores to North America The new “ German Atlantic Telegraph” Cable, which was finished on 1st October 1900, starts from Emden and Borkum, and from thence via the Azores to the United States of America. Its length is 4, JOG knots, the cost of the cable including laying (4,280 marks or 2101. per knot) and maintenance for 30 years, is 935,0001. sterling. By this cable 25 words of 5 letters each can be sent per minute. Estimating the average number of working hours per day at 18 hours, 27,000 words may be sent daily, or about eight million words per year. ^ The conditions under which the German Government granted to the “ German Atlantic Telegraph Company ” the concession for landing and working this cable to America are stated to have been as follows, viz (1) The telegraph service connected with this cable at Emden and Boikum (the starting points of the cable on the German coast) to be placed in the* hands of the German Imperial Post and Telegraph Authorities, whilst the service outside of Germany, viz : on the Azores and in America, is left to the Company. (2) The “German Atlantic Telegraph” Cable to be used, in the first instance, for telegrams from Germany and adjoining countries to America, exclusive of Peru and Brazil, and countries to the South of those States. . (3) For the use of this cable the German Empire to pay the Company a fixed compensation of 70,000Z. sterling (1,400,000 marks) per annum for a term of 40 years dating fiom the opening of the working of the telegraph. ^ ^ (4) The Empire to receive (up to a maximum sum of 85,000L or 1,700,000 marks per annum) the revenue from telegram charges out of the cable-rates which are paid for telegrams between Germany and adjoining countries and North America and adjoining countries. When the revenue from the above-mentioned source exceeds 85,000L, the German Empire to receive a proportion of the charges amounting to 25 centimes French money (2} 2 d.) per word. Besides this, the German Empire to receive from the telegrams referring to Germany which pass over the section between Emden- Borkum and the Azores, the terminal and transit charges, the amount of which is to be agreed upon with the Company. At the demand of the Empire, these rates to be fixed anew after five (5) Whenever an interruption takes place in the working of the cable in consequence of the condition of the cable, the Company has the1C5 right of receiving the compensation (mentioned under No. 3) as long as the Company, at its own expense, provides for the transmission of the telegiams m such a manner as, according to the opinion of the German Post Office, suffices for the requirements of public traffic. If the Company makes no use of this right, or if # the substituted mode of transmission does not, accord imr to the opinion of the German Post Office, meet the requirements of the public traffic, the Empire shall pay the Company only (in lieu of the above named compensation) the proportionate share of the charges out of the transmission of the telegrams due to the Post Office, after deduction of the charge of five Pfennigs (fd) per word sent by German Land Telegraphs which belong to the Empire, or, after the deduction of the respective cable rates if the transmission of the telegrams takes place per German Cable to Ireland (6) The Company binds itself to take over by about the year 1904 the Cable Lines of the “ German Sea Telegraph Company ” (Deutsche See Telegraphen Gesellschaft), the term of concession to which has been extended to the year 1940. The telegraph cable of this Company (founded in 1896 with a capital of 178,000L) runs from Emden-Borkum to Vigo (Spain). (The “ German Atlantic Telegraph Company” has already taken over the working of the latter company, so that both German companies are now in the same hands.) Until 1899 the “ Europe and Azores Telegraph Company ” possessed the exclusive privilege of landing telegraph cables over the Azores, but in August 1899 this Company conceded the privilege of landing a cable on the Island of Fayal to the “ German Atlantic Telegraph Company ”, for the sum of 2,500Z. sterling ; the German ( ompany at the same time gave an undertaking to the Portuguese Government, that, as soon as the receipts from the new cable would yield a dividend of 8 %, the Company would at their expense lay a telegraph cable from Fayal to the Isle of Santa Maria and also to the Isle of Flores. The Portuguese Government levies a transit charge on the transmission of telegrams via the Azores amounting to 5 centimes (Id.) per word for messages between the chief stations and certain other rates for other messages. The right of landing the cable in the United States of America was, after negotiations between the German Government and the United States Government, conceded to the Company by the President of the United States under date of 27th May 1899 under the “usual” conditions'* and with the “usual” reservation that the concession is subject to any eventual resolutions of the United States Congress or of the President. (What these “ usual ” conditions are is not known to me.) William Ward, His Majesty’s Consul-General. British Consulate General, Hamburg, 21st March 1901. III.— Cables connecting Borneo, Celebes, Palau Islands, Yap, Guam, and Shanghai. f [Convention of 24t/i July 1901, between German and Netherland Governments.] Article 1. The Royal Netherland Government undertakes to lay and exploit a cable from Balikpapan to Menado on the North coast of the island of Celebes in connection with the telegraph line now in course of construction from Landangan in the Island of Java to Bandjermasin and Balikpapan in the Island of Borneo. # For a copy of the concession of 1899, authorising the Company to land a cable at New York, see pages 52-53 of Memorandum of 13th October 1899. f The cables between Borneo, Celebes, Yap, Guam, and Shanghai were laid 1903 to 1905. As regards Palau Islands, see No. VII.166 Article^ 2. r The Imperial German Government and the Royal Netherland Government undertake to act in concert that, with the object of effecting a junction wit the projected American Pacific cable, cable communications may be laid down and P exploited between Menado and the Palau Islands, the island of 1 ap, the island of Guam or some adjacent point m the American 1 acific cable, as we as between the Palau Islands and Shanghai, by a German-Netherland company, the control of which shall be subject to the joint supervision of the two ^Governments. The German Government however may make over the lavinc down and the exploiting of the connection between the island of Yap and the landing place of the American Pacific cable to the undertaker of t le latter cable, in case it should consider this more advantageous. Article 3. The two Governments shall, each within its own territory, grant to the German-Netherland Company for the period of forty years the landing-rights for the requisite cables and the authority to exploit these cables. . . , , The Sovereign rights of each of the two states are in no wise diminished by the granting of the landing-rights. In accordance herewith each of the Governments reserves the right, within its own territory, at any time to cause the service of the Company’s apparatus to be undertaken by its own sen ants, if it should consider that to be necessaiy. _ i f +1^ two The Company’s tariffs shall be subject to the approval of the two Governments. Article 4. The two Governments conjointly undertake to grant to the German- Netherland Company, for the cable communications named in Article -, a subsidy of not more than 1,400,000 (one million four hundred thousand) marks per annum, for a period not exceeding twenty years. Of this subsidy a sum of 375 000 (three hundred and seventy five thousand) marks shall be paid by the’Royal Netherland Government, and a sum of 1,0-5,000 (one mil ion and twenty five thousand) marks by the Imperial German Government. Should the communication beween the island of 5 ap and the landing p ace of the American Pacific cable be made over to the undertaker of the latter cable then the maximum amount of the subsidy shall be changed in t proportion of the length of this line to the length of the rest of the system mentioned in Article 2, the share of the subsidy to be paid by the German Government being reduced by tbe same amount. i u i o The subsidy to be paid to the German-Netherland Company shall be reduced every year by an amount equivalent to 90 % o± tl ie receipts from the cable rates of the entire subsidised system. . . , . In case of interruption of subsidised cable communications no reduction shall be made in the subsidy so long as the Company offers facilities to send the telegrams by another route, which both Governments judge to be Satl If these facilities are not offered, then the subsidy, so far as regards the interrupted portion, shall be reduced or entirely withheld, according to further regulations to be agreed upon by the two Governments. °Fach of the two Governments shall benefit m proportion to its share in the ioint subsidy by the reduction effected by receipts from cable rates in the subsidy, and also by any diminution or non-payment on account of interruption. Article 5. If the Company at any future time shall wish to establish telegraphic communications, extending' in a westward direction, from Netherlands India, landing-rights shall be granted with this object by the Netheilan Government, at points, suitable for that purpose, to be determined later In this case power shall be granted to the Company to connect its system with the western cables by one or more cables destined for through communi cation. If required, and so far as it may be necessary for the purpose of direct* connection between these through cables, one or more wires onGovernment overland lines shall also be let to the Company at a rent to be agreed upon and placed at its disposal to be worked with its own apparatus and by its own staff. Article G. If conditions be granted to other cable undertakings in Netherlands India by which the^ Company shall be directly or indirectly hampered in its competition with these, then these conditions shall be equally enioved bv the Company. J i J Article 7. &amp;hould difference of opinion arise between the two Governments as to the interpretation of the execution of this agreement, which differences cannot be removed , by negotiations, then they shall apply to the Permanent Court of Arbitration mentioned in Chapter II. of the Convention of the 29th of July, 1899, for the peaceful settlement of international disputes. In token whereof the undersigned thereto authorised have subscribed their names and attached their seals to this agreement.

IV.— Modification and Extension of German Atlantic Company’s Con cession from German Government under which Company undertake to lay a second Cable from Germany via the Azores to New York (Cables laid in 1903 and 1904). [Memorandum (dated July 1902) f urnished by British Consul-General at Hamburg.] 1 he most important amongst the matters which were submitted to the general meeting of the German Atlantic Telegraph Company held at Cologne on 30th June 1902, was the proposal to jaise a loan of 20 million marks (or 1,000,000L sterling) for the purpose of’enabling the Company to construct a second telegraph cable from Emden-Borkum via the Azores to New York. The principal ^ points of the agreement entered into between the Company and the German postal authorities are as follows :—The duration of the concession granted originally (on construction of the first cable Emden- New York) is extended to December 31st, 1944. The German Empire agrees to pay to the Company, provided the section of the cable between Borkum and the Azores of the second telegraph cable is in working order by the commencement of the year 1904, a fixed contribution of marks 750,000 (or 37,500C sterling); and from and after the year 1905 until the end of 1944, providing the second section and consequently the entire length of the cable shall have been put into working order by the beginning of the year 1905, a fixed contribution of marks 1,710,000 (or 85,500/-. sterling)). For periods during which the working of the cable may be rendered impracticable by the condition of the same, the payments on the part of the German Empire will he continued; but the Company is bound to provide means for transmitting the telegrams by another route approved of by the German postal authorities, and, in case the Company finds it impossible to do this, it must reimburse the Empire for the increased costs arising from such circuitous transmission up to an amount not exceeding marks 1,710,000 (or 85,500/. sterling) annually. V.— New Concession to Indo-European Telegraph Company for Land Wires through Germany, 1904.

The Imperial Post Office shall also undertake to see to the wires being maintained in good condition, and, in the event of interruption, substitute other wires if»at all possible. In the event of the traffic increasing to such an extent as to render the existing three wires inadequate to cope with it, though the best means of working be employed, the Imperial Post Office shall, at the request of the Company, increase the number of wires, but only on condition that the minimum receipts fixed in clause 4 are in that event increased in proportion to the number of wires. The Company shall not be entitled to land cables of its own on the German coast or construct cable stations of its own in Germany. (2) The Company shall transmit its telegrams between Great Britain and countries beyond Great Britain on the one side, and India, Persia and the countries beyond India on the other, over the wires placed at its disposal within Germany.

The Imperial Telegraph Administration, after consulting the Company, shall determine at what office the handing over of these telegrams is to take place. At the same office the Company shall also hand over to the Imperial Telegraph Administration the telegrams arriving from the opposite direction intended for Germany and the countries beyond Germany. The I mperial Telegraph Administration shall have a completely free hand in the transmission of the Persian, Indian, and Trans- Indian telegrams handed in in Germany or conveyed to it from the hinterlands, unless the sender shall have expressly directed the telegram to be transmitted over the line of the Company. The Company shall not in Germany have any direct relations with the Public. (3) The working of the line in Germany shall be carried out exclusively by officials of the Imperial Telegraph Administration.

I he Governments of Japan and Corea being desirous of cementing their relations as neighbouring countries and of promoting trade and commerce have agreed to construct a submarine line of telegraph. The articles of their agreement are as follows :— A7'ticle 1. The Governments of the two countries authorise the Danish Great Northern Telegraph Company to lay a submarine cable from the north west coast of Kiushiu in Japan to the shore of Fusan in Corea via Tsushima. The Japanese Government will construct a land line of telegraphs from the place where the cable is landed at Fusan to the Japanese Settlement at that place; they will also build a telegraph office and take charge of the transmission of telegraphic messages. The Corean Government will charge no import duties on any material needed for the construction of this line and will remit all land taxes on the land required for this purpose ; it beino- understood that this exemption from duties is not to constitute a precedent for other cases. With regard to the land on which the telegraph buildings are erected no land tax will be charged for the full period of 25 years, dating from the completion of the work; at the expiration of this period,’should there be no profit on the working of this line, it is agreed that a fresh understanding on the question of exemption shall be effected. Article 2. The Corean Government agrees for the full period of 25 years, to date from the day on which this submarine cable and this land line of telegraphs are completed and telegraphic communication is first established, not to construct any line of telegraphs which shall enter into competition with this submarine cable and this land line of telegraphs, and it undertakes further not to sanction during the same period the construction of any submarine cable (between the two countries) by any other government or company. The Corean Government may, however, establish telegraph lines wherever convenient to them in places where such lines will not enter into competition (with these two Japanese lines). Article 3. When Government lines of telegraph are constructed by the Corean Postal Authorities the latter shall arrange for the transmission of all foreign telegrams through the Japanese Telegraph Office at Fusan. The details of such arrangement shall be settled when the time for so doing arrives between the Corean Postal Authorities and the Japanese Telegraph Office.208 Article 4. In order to protect these telegraph lines and preserve them from damage the Cerean Government shall establish Penal Regulations for general application, and punish offences committed against these regulations. Should a case of this kind he brought to its notice by the Japanese Government the offence shall be investigated and compensation shall be caused to be made in accordance with the law. Article 5. The Japanese Telegraph Office at Fusan will deal directly with the imblic in respect of the receiving and delivery of telegrams. Should it be necessary for Corean Government officials to inspect the original records of telegraphic messages for the purpose of obtaining evidence in judicial cases, these must be furnished to them. Corean Government telegrams shall take precedence both in their despatch and in their delivery over private messages. With regard to the rates to be charged on such Government telegrams, in so far as the telegraph line constructed by Japan in the locality of Fusan is concerned, half rates only will be charged, irrespective of the distance traversed. The Plenipotentiaries of the two countries by virtue of the powers entrusted to them have agreed on the above articles and in witness thereof have affixed to this Convention their signatures and seals.

The Concessionaires hereby undertake to construct the line in a durable manner, and to keep it in good working order during the whole term of the Concession. The conducting wires shall be manufactured of the best quality iron, and shall be at least six millimetres in diameter. The posts shall be of iron. The Concessionaires shall be bound to submit to the Persian Government for their approval the plan for erecting the line from Djoulfa to Teheran. The line shall, at first, consist of two wires, but should it become necessary, the Concessionaires shall have the right of increasing the number of wires. The Concessionaires furthermore undertake to provide their stations with instru ments of the best quality. Previous to the line being worked notice shall be given to the Persian Government. Wheresoever it be practicable to do so, the Concessionaires shall establish their stations in the buildings employed by the Persian Telegraph, and the Concessionaires shall defray the outlay attending the same. Should the buildings where the stations are situate not offer convenient accommodation, the Concessionaires shall, at their own cost, find other places. 4. The Concessionaires’ line shall be exclusively employed for the trans mission of messages between India and Europe. The Persian Telegraph Administration shall hand over to the Concessionaires for transmission to their respective destinations all the telegrams by them received for India or for Europe. Any telegrams coming from India or from Europe for Persia, shall be handed over by the Concessionaires to the competent Persian Telegraph stations for transmission by the same to the parties to whom they are addressed. The Concessionaires are hereby prohibited from holding P 4232 any direct communication with the public for the purpose of receiving or forwarding messages. 5. The line of telegraph situate upon Persian territory shall be considered a Government institution ; and as regards its maintenance and protection it shall enjoy all the rights which are granted to the telegraph lines belonging to the Persian Government. 6. The Persian Government hereby exempts the Concessionaires from payment of import duties and customs charges upon the materials destined for erecting the Persian portion of the line. The Persian Government shall be previously informed of the quantity of materials which are to be imported. The Concessionaires are hereby likewise exempted from payment of all taxes and rates. The customs officers of the Persian custom-house shall have the right of searching the loads belonging to the Concessionaires. 7. The Concessionaires shall have the right of carrying their line in the direction, sanctioned by the Persian Government through the towns and villages along the public highways without being required to pay any indemnity for the ground taken up by the line. In the places where the line shall run across any private property or properties belonging to the munici palities, the Concessionaires are hereby vested with the right of compulsory expropriation, in accordance with the regulations in force and to the extent which the Government may consider indispensable. 8. The following regulations are determined upon as concerns the lixing of the tariff for the Indo-European correspondence :— (a) In distinction from the tariffs in general use and by way of exception, half messages or telegrams of ten words may be sent at half the charges fixed for ordinary telegrams of 20 words. (b) For every additional 25 words over and above 20 words one fourth of the rate shall be charged more than the rate charged for telegrams of 20 words. (c) The maximum rate charged for the ordinary telegram of 20 words from London to the western part of India shall not exceed four pounds sterling from the moment that the charge in the English tariff for telegrams transmitted by the submarine lines along the Persian Gulf and the Indian seas shall have been reduced to one half its present rate ; until such reductions shall have taken place, the price for a telegram of 20 words shall not be higher than that charged for the transmission of a similar telegram between Europe and India by way of the Turkish line. (d) The tariff for the correspondence between India and the intermediate stations shall be fixed by the Concessionaires at their discretion, on condition that the charge for transmitting any messages to the Indies from any intermediate station shall in no case exceed the rate charged for the whole line. 9.

The Concessionaires shall not therefore receive anything for the transmission of the Indo-European telegrams between Djoidfa and Teheran up to the term above-mentioned, but on condition that the present rate, as fixed by the Russo-Persiah Convention of the 13th of August 1864, is in no way raised during the present Concession. x\fter the terms of the Anglo-Persian Concession hereinbefore mentioned shall have expired, the Teheran-Shiraz-Bendar-Bouschir line shall be handed over to the Concessionaires unless the Persian Government shall before that time have entered into a new convention with the English Government with respect to said line. In the first case, the conditions in the present Concession shall apply equally to the Teheran-Bendar-Bouschir line, with the only difference that a conducting wire shall be placed at the disposal of the Government every day for the space of ten hours for Persian corres pondence. The Persian Government will employ their own clerks in such * * Head “ Djoulfa.” f Busbire,233 service, and settle the details thereof with the Concessionaires.

The charge for half telegrams shall also be reduced to one-half. For telegrams containing more than 20 words, there shall be paid one-half franc for each 5 additional words over and above 20. If, on the other hand, the Persian Government should enter into another arrangement with England in respect of the said line, then the Concessionaires shall become entitled to one-third (i) of the charge which may be fixed upon for telegrams between Djoulfa and Bendar-Bouschir, but which shall, however, never exceed ten francs and a half.

Should the tariffs on the other lines be modified the Con cessionaires hereby undertake to pay to the Persian Government integrally 2 francs for each telegram, and the Persian Government reserves to itself the right of either claiming 2 francs for each telegram of 20 words, or then a fixed annual sum of 12,000 “ tomans.” The Concessionaires in this respect shall be bound to abide by the choice of the Persian Government. 10. The Persian Government reserves to itself the right of taking such measures as seem fit in order to secure the exact observance of the present Concession, but in such a manner, however, as not to trammel or delay the transmission of messages. The Government shall likewise have the right of causing the daj^-books and accounts or reports of the Concessionaires to be produced by an officer specially delegated for the purpose, and whose appointment shall be previously notified. 11. The Persian Government shall have the right on payment of the rate established by the. Persian tariff of causing to be transmitted by the Con cessionaires’ lines its telegrams. The Concessionaires hereby undertake to put up on their own posts between Djoulfa and Teheran the new wire for the Government and to keep it in repair during the whole term of the present Concession. The cost of repairing, if not exceeding the sum of 300 “tomans” annually, shall be defrayed by the Concessionaires. Anything exceeding that sum, after having been verified by an officer of the Persian Government in concert with a person duly appointed by the Concessionaires, shall be paid by the Persian Government. The cost of purchase, fixing and setting up of the iron posts shall be defrayed by the Concessionaires. Should the Government wire be interrupted for a period exceeding three days, the Concessionaires shall be bound to place at the disposal of the Government one of their own wires, until the line shall have been put in working order, without claiming any indemnity on that account. 12. The accounts between the Concessionaires and the Government shall be settled quarterly. In the event of any payments due to the Government not being effected within three months after each settlement of accounts, the Government shall have the right of sequestering the property of the Conces sionaires until final payment thereof. The Concessionaires shall be bound to have, at their own expense, a special agent at Teheran with the object of facilitating their relations with the Persian Government. 13. The duration of the Concession is hereby fixed at 25 years to reckon from the day on which the telegraphic communication shall commence on the line. On the expiration of said term the privilege shall cease, and the Concessionaires will be required to come to an arrangement with the Government should they wish to continue their enjoyment of the Indo- European telegraph. In the event of an agreement not having been come to on the subject, all the line which may have been erected by virtue of the present Concession shall be handed over in good condition to the Persian Government without any indemnity. 14. Should the Concessionaires have put up any new conductors during the terms of the Concession in order to increase the transmitting capacitv of the line, and no arrangement shall have been come to on the expiration of the Concession for lengthening its term, the Government hereby engages to pay the Concessionaires an indemnity for such new conductors subject to234 valuation thereof. Such valuation to be made by a commission on behalf of the Government, together with a duly appointed attorney on behalf of the Concessionaires. It is clearly understood that the Concessionaires shall not have it in their power to put up any additional wires without having previously obtained the consent of the Government of Persia. 15. The Concessionaires shall be entitled, at any time, to transfer the rights by them acquired in virtue of the present Concession, together with the obligations which they hereby undertake, to a company, of which the statutes shall be sanctioned by the Government.

It is hereby determined that the number of foreign officers employed along the whole' extent of the Persian line shall not exceed 50. 16. With the object of simplifying the settlement of the accounts between the Persian Government and the Concessionaires, the relative values of coins shall be regulated by the following unalterable rates ; to wit,— One pound sterling = 25 “ francs ” = 22 “ krans.” One shilling = 1 franc 20 centimes — 1 kran and 2 chahis. One penny = 10 centimes and 2 chahis. One “ rouble ” = 4 francs = 3 krans and 10 chahis.

II. —Modification of No. L, 24th May I860. The conclusions accepted by the Congress of Vienna having changed the basis of the Concession of the 11th January 1868,‘ ::: ' granted to Messrs. Siemens and Halske and Siemens Brothers, in forcing the actual Concessionaires to fix a tariff which is under the minimum of 100 francs, stipulated in Article VIII. of the said Concession, the Persian Government and the Concessionaires have agreed to the following articles :— I. The Persian Government concedes to the actual Concessionaires for the period since the 1st January 1870 up to the expiration of the Treaty of the 23rd October 1865, all the rights that that Treaty gives them on the receipts accruing from international messages transmitted over the Teheran- Bushire line. After the expiration of that Treaty the Teheran-Bushire line will be made over to the Concessionaires, unless the Persian Government has made, meanwhile, a new convention on the same financial basis with the English Government concerning this line. In case the Treaty should be renewed, the Persian Government concedes to the Concessionaires for the period up to the 1st January 1895, the date of the expiration of the Concession of the 11th January 1868, all the rights which would have accrued to the Persian Government and that the renewal of the Anglo-Persian Convention would have still given them on the two-thirds of the receipts accruing from international messages transmitted * * No. I.over the line between Djoulfa and Bushire, the third part already belonging to the grantees as it is stipulated in Article IX. of the Concession of the 11th January 1868. The Concessionaires will themselves collect the above-mentioned receipts, and to that effect will arrange with the English Government. In return, the Concessionaires will pay to the Persian Government during 25 years from the 1st February 1870 to the 1st January 1895, at their option, either a duty of 2 francs for each transit message which passes over the Djoulfa-Bushire line, excepting service messages, or an annual rent of 12,000 tomans. They shall pay this duty or the fixed rent in the two cases, whether the Teheran-Bushire line be made over to them, or whether it remains under the existing administrative conditions, the Concessionaires then enjoying the revenue only which may accrue to the Persian Government and to themselves. Moreover, the grantees are prepared, at the request of the Persian Government, to pay all the debts which that Government has contracted up to the present with the English Government for the purchase of telegraph materials, as well as the debts which the administration of the Persian Telegraphs has incurred with the same Government for the construction of the line. The amount of these debts should be determined before the 1st January 1871 by the Persian and English Governments. Beginning from this date the Concessionaires will be authorised to reimburse themselves by deducting each year the 24th part of the sum agreed upon by the aforesaid Governments from the rent or the duties payable to the Persian Government. In case the settlement of the account between the said Governments has not taken effect at the date mentioned, then another term shall be fixed for this settlement—a term which is not to exceed one year. The Concessionaires shall then have the right to reimburse themselves by retaining each year a sum equal to the 23rd part of the sum determined upon. If, again, the accounts shall not have been settled at this last term, then the Concessionnaires will be freed from this obligation. II* 1. In addition, the Persian Government grants to the actual possessors of the Concession of the 11th January 1868 a concession exclusively for the construction and working of a telegraph line of one wire between Shiraz and Bunder Abbas. The Concessionaires are obliged to advise the Persian Government as to the direction of the line before proceeding to construct it. 2. The Concessionaires bind themselves to complete the construction of this line as soon as possible. 3. The Concessionaires bind themselves to construct the line and to maintain it in good state of preservation during the whole period of their administration. The telegraphic wire shall be made of iron of the best quality and shall be 6 millimetres at least in diameter. The supports shall be of iron, the apparatus shall be of the best quality. Whenever possible the stations shall be located at Shiraz in the offices of the Persian Telegraph; in other places in such sites as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Concessionaires shall deem suitable, and which shall be gratuitously granted to the latter from land belonging to the Persian Government. 4. Like the lines already existing, the new line is equally destined for the despatch of international messages, which shall pass over the line of the Concessionaires between London and Peheran. 5. The line will be considered as if it was an institution of the Govern ment and will participate, under the relations of its organisation and of its security, in all the rights granted to the lines of the Persian Government. * * Sections 1 to 10 of this Article were annulled by No. 111.236 6. The Concessionaires are exempted by the Persian G overment from the payment of customs duty on the importation of materials for the establish ment and maintenance of this line and of its offices, and they are freed from all local duties. The customs authorities shall, however, have the right of inspecting frontier. the consignments belonging to the Concessionaires on the 7. The Concessionaires shall have the right of constructing their line in the direction sanctioned by the Government across towns and villages along roads, without being bound to pay any indemnity for the land occupied by the line. In those places where the lines shall traverse private or common property, the Concessionaires shall enjoy the right of forced appropriation conformably to the laws in force and to the extent that the Government shall judge indispensable. 8. The duration of the Concession is fixed at 25 years, to reckon from the day when the working of the Shiraz-Bunder Abbas line shall have commenced. After the expiration of this period the privilege shall cease ; and the Con cessionaires should come to an understanding with the Persian Government on the subject of the continuation of their possession of this line. In the case of no arrangement having been concluded on this subject, all the line constructed by virtue of this Concession, as well as the buildings of the stations, shall be given up to the Persian Government without any indemnity. I i* 9. The duration of the Shiraz-Bunder Abbas Concession expiring after the 1st January 1895, the precision and rapidity of the international traffic, which depends on the uniformity of administration, might be threatened if the Government should take back, at this date, the Djoulfa-Teheran and Teheran- Bushire lines while the Shiraz-Bunder Abbas still remained for some time in the hands of the Concessionaires. The Persian Government wishing to avoid this inconvenience and being- unwilling to take back the Shiraz-Bunder Abbas line before the expiration of this Concession, so as not to be obliged to compensate the Concessionaires for the expenses of construction for which they would no longer have any income, it consents to this that the Concession for the Djoulfa-Teheran line and the arrangement on the subject of the Teheran-Bunder-Bushire line be prolonged to the date of the expiration of the Shiraz-Bunder Abbas line. 10. In return, the Concessionaires shall pay to the Persian Government, for the working of this Concession from the date of the opening of the line for international traffic, during the first half of the 25 years 1,000 tomans annually, and during the second half 2,000 tomans annually. If the Djoulfa-Teheran Concession and the arrangement on the subject of the Teheran-Bushire line are prolonged beyond the 1st January 1895, they shall pay, from that date to the expiration of the Shiraz-Bunder Abbas Concession, an annual fine of 15,000 tomans, instead of the 12,000 tomans fixed by Article I. of the present arrangement. 11. If, during the duration of the Concession, the Concessionaires put up extra wires to increase the means of communication, the Persian Government binds itself to pay the Concessionaires, when the line is given up, an indem nity for these extra wires based on an estimate made by a Commissioner of the Government and an Attorney of the Concessionaires. 12. It shall be lawful at all times for the Concessionaires to transfer the rights granted to them by the present Concession, with the obligations assumed by them, to another Company whose statutes shall have been sanctioned by the Government. It is agreed that the number of foreign employes along the whole Shiraz-Bunder Abbas line shall not exceed 50 in number.His Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs of His Majesty the Shah of Persia and Mons.

To prolong for 25 years or to the 15th of December 1929 the permission and exclusive privilege granted on the 15th of December 1879 to Frank Murphy and Company, of Philadelphia, and which was trans ferred to the Central and South American Telegraph Company (via Gal veston), for the establishing and working lines of communication between Peru, starting from Callao, Chorrillos, or that vicinity, and the countries situated to the north of the republic. 2. The Company obliges itself to maintain the telegraphic station during its contract. 3. Within the concession to which the first clause refers, is included the exclusive privilege which is given to the Company to establish and work any other system of telegraphing, whether electric, magnetic, or otherwise, between Peru and the countries situated to the north (5 it; but in case the * See print of Concessions dated November 1900, page 88. Q 2244 wireless system is in general use by commerce throughout the world, and has substituted in a permanent and normal manner, the cable between Europe and Lima, via Buenos Aires and Chile, and the Government receives pro posals for its establishment between Lima and I^anama, the Government has the right to exact that the Company in the term of six months decide whether they will establish or not for their own account the said wireless system. If the Company take advantage of their preference rights, the Govern ment within its jurisdiction, will grant it the privileges and facilities necessary for the establishing of the wireless system. If at the expiration of the six months the Company had not agreed to establish the wireless system between Lima and Panama, the Government within an equitable term, that is to say, without any unnecessary delay, at the end of the six months, can contract the said system between lima and Panama with other persons or companies, and when the wireless system is installed and in permanent use, the privilege granted to the Company, as far as regards wireless telegraphy between Lima and Panama, will remain null and void between these points. In case the Government concludes a contract with another or others, that are not of the Company, for the establishing of wireless telegraphy between Lima and Panama, the Company immediately after, or at any subsequent time, can at its election retire its cables from the Peruvian ports and rescind this contract in all its parts. 4. During the privilege, excepting the provisions in the previous clause, all the messages received in telegraph offices of the State for the United States or Europe, and places connected by lines of the Company shall be delivered to it for their transmission unless the sender gives contrary instructions. 5. Although the Company can establish telegraphic communication with intermediate points between Chorrillos and Payta, the Government can also allow the establishment of other lines to those ports. The Company cannot in this section recover lower rates than those charged by the State lines excepting only in the case of the Government allowing another Company to do so. 6 . The Government cedes gratuitously to the Company for the laying of its cables the use of the Peruvian territorial waters, and the vacant land that it requires for its stations; and it will be considered as a work of public benefit for the expropriation of private lands, at the cost of the Company, and in accordance with the law regarding this matter. 7. During the term of the privilege, all the materials, tools, machinery, apparatus, and instruments and other necessary articles for the location, working, or the repairing of the cables or the wireless stations (in case it is established as an experiment or permanently), shall be imported in the necessary quantities free of all import and custom duties. 8 . The Company may reduce, but in no case increase the actual tariff for public messages, which is as follows (the Peruvian pound being of the same weight and fineness as the pound sterling) : — Ecuador : Guayaquil, Santa Elena, per word, Peruvian pounds - - - - Colombia : Buenaventura, per word, Peru vian pounds - - - - Panama : Panama, per word, Peruvian pounds - Nicaragua : San Juan del Sur, per word, Peruvian pounds - - - - Guatemala : San Jose, per word, Peruvian pounds - Salvador : La Libertad, per word, Peruvian pounds - - - - Mexico : Mexico, Veracruz (terminus of the company’s line), per word, Peruvian pounds - 75 gold (Is. 6 d.). 100 gold (2s.'). 125 gold (2s. (jd.). 125 gold (2s. 6d.). 125 gold (2s. (jd.). 125 gold (2s. (jd.). 150 gold (3s.).The Company is authorised to increase at its judgment the price for the messages which are not from its own lines, but originating from other companies or other lines ol communication for Central or South America or vice versa, when it has well-founded motives of believing that on the part of the transmitting Company there is an intention to defraud the Central and South American Telegraph Company or its associates of its legal rates. It is also agreed that the maximum rate which the Company may charge for its proportional part of the tariff for messages destined or proceeding from places outside of its lines, to the north of Lima, shall not exceed 200,000th gold (4s.) per word. 0 . The cable is declared neutral within the Peruvian territory, but in case of internal disturbance or of foreign war, the Government is allowed to establish intervention in the Company’s offices and to prohibit the forwarding or delivery of the messages which it considers to compromise public order or the safety of the State. 10. The Company is at liberty to choose its own employes and telegraph clerks, who will be subject to the same duties that are imposed by the laws on other inhabitants of the Republic. 11. For the effects of this contract, the Company is bound by the laws and authorities of Peru, and renounces all diplomatic intervention. 12. The official messages of the Government or its agents shall be trans mitted in preference by the lines of the Company, and the maximum tariff recoverable for them from the Government between Lima and places to the south of Galveston, Texas, shall not exceed the actual tariff charged the Government, that is to say, half the amount of the rate recovered from the public at present. In case the rates for the public are reduced, the Government will benefit by the reduction, paying half of the reduced tariff, whatever it may be. As regards Government Official Messages from the United States or Europe, the Government will pay the Company for the proportional charges, corresponding to the lines between Galveston and Lima (Mexican Telegraph Company and Central and South American Telegraph Company), the fourth part of the proportion fixed for the public, it being clearly understood that there will be no reduction on the rates of the lines which do not belong to these Companies. The messages sent on the Company’s business to or by its agents over the Peruvian lines, shall pay 25 per cent, of the tariff in force. 13. Private messages over Peruvian lines addressed to the Company shall pay the rates of the tariff in force in the offices of the State, but in case of the tariff being reduced the reduced rates shall be charged. 14. If the lines between the United States and Europe reduce their tariffs, the messages addressed to Peru or vice versa shall enjoy the benefit of the reduction. 15. This contract puts a definitive end to all claims or questions that may exist between the Government and the company. 16. This contract will terminate at once if there is an interruption in the service of the Company during nine consecutive months, or if in its working during three consecutive years it suffers minor interruptions which amount to nine months. 17. Any other infractions of the stipulations in this contract will cause its rescission after a judicial sentence. 18. When the contract has run out, or is declared terminated or rescinded, or its privileges forfeited, the Company will remain in undisturbed possession of its lines, stations, and offices. 19. The reductions in the tariffs and the modifications mentioned in this contract shall come into force on the signing thereof. A. B. Leguia, Herbert Kingsford.PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. [Information supplementary to that contained at page 114 of the First Annexe to the printed Memorandum of the 12&gt;th October 1899.] I.—Philippines to Hong Kong, 1880. [This Concession is referred to at page 114 of the First Annexe to the printed Memorandum of the \2&gt;th October 1899.] By a Royal Decree, dated 14th December 1878, the Spanish Government offered to public competition a contract for tile establishment and working of a submarine telegraph cable between the coast of China (Hong Kong) and the Island of Luzon in the Philippines. This contract was awarded to Mr. W. W. Morice, representing the Eastern Extension Telegraph and the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Companies. The conditions under which the cable was to be laid and worked are given in the following schedule ; and, in addition, Mr. Morice bound the Companies to concede to the Spanish Government gratuitous and preferential transmission to their telegrams during the 40 years of the duration of the exclusive privilege. See letter dated 21st February 1879 annexed to Schedule. Schedule of Conditions for the laying and working of a submarine telegraph cable between the Western Coast of the Island of Luzon and Hong Kong. Article 1. The Contractor undertakes to lay and work for his account a submarine telegraph cable between the western coast of Luzon (Cape Bojeador or Cape Bolinao) and Hong Kong, which shall connect Manila with Hong Kong and with the general telegraph system. The distance between Cape Bojeador and Hong Kong, taken at sea level, is about 430 miles, and from Cape Bolinao to Hong Kong 475 miles. Article 2. The cable shall be made fast at the point of the above-mentioned coast which the Contractor may consider most suitable for the line and for the safety of the cables. The Contractor shall submit for the approval of Government, the profiles, plans, and surveys of the intended route, from the starting point to the landing place, within a year from the date of the final concession. Article 3. The cable shall consist of one conductor, formed of a strand of seven copper wires, weighing at least 107 lbs. English per nautical mile, and its electrical resistance after the cable is laid (and allowing for the correction of the temperature to reduce it to 24 degrees Centigrade) shall not exceed 13 ohms per nautical mile. This conductor shall be covered with a coating of Chatterton’s composition, followed by three coatings of gutta percha alternated with coatings of the above-named composition; its insulating resistance after the cables are laid, and allowing for the correction of the temperature to reduce it to 24 degrees Centigrade, shall not be less than 200 megohms per nautical mile. The core shall be covered with servings of hemp (steeped in a preservative composition) necessary to receive the sheathings corresponding to the different types of cable to be employed. The sheathing of the deep sea cable shall consist of ten or twelve iron wires, six millimetres in diameter, laid spirally, and protected by two servings of hemp and coated with Clarke’s composition. The sheathing of the shore end cable may be either double or single at the option of the Contractor. In the event of its being double, it shall consist of 14 iron wires, eight millimetres in diameter, laid spirally over the sheathing of the deep sea cable. In the event of its being single, it shall consist of247 10 iron wires, 10 millimetres in diameter laid spirally. In both cases me sheathings shall be protected by two servings of hemp coated with Ulaike s composition, as in the case of the deep sea cable. Article 4. In the neighbourhood of the coasts the cable shall be laid in the line oi the currents by using two miles of shore end cable, and then two miles oi intermediate before joining on to the “ deep sea ” type. Article 5. • ^ 0n ^ rac ^ 01 ^ can adopt such system of apparatus as he may deem suitable for working the cable, modifying or changing it as he thinks best, but he shall always keep at the principal station the following testing instruments : one Lhomson’s reflecting galvanometer with all its adjuncts, one Wheatstones bridge with resistance coils up to 10,000 ohms, one con denser of a third of a farad, one Thomson’s receiving syphon of the newest type, with the local battery, and the tools necessary for splicing cables. Article 6 . The receiving and transmitting station for the working of the cable shall be situated in that office of the State which the Government shall deem most suitable for the purpose, the Contractor paying a fair proportion of rent corresponding to the increase of the premises required for the establishment oi: the new station, and the branch telegraph line which is to connect the end of the cable with the nearest station of the State shall be constructed at his expense. Article 7. The materials required for the construction on Spanish territory of the aerial line, which is to connect the cable with the station above-mentioned, as well as the apparatus and other instruments, shall be considered as items of a public work, and as such shall enjoy the immunities conceded by the existing laws. Article 8 . The telegraphists and other persons employed in the working of the cable shall be chosen by the Contractor, but subject in the exercise of their duties to the provisions contained in the telegraph regulations of the islands. In addition to this, the Government reserves to itself the right of organising, in connection with the cable, such a system of supervision as may be most in accordance with the present administrative regulations. Consequently tele grams received and presented for transmission, shall be handed over to the officials of the State, who will act as intermediaries between the public and the Contractor’s agents. Article 9. The Government may establish, wdierever it deems it expedient, the aerial and submarine telegraph lines in the Philippine Islands which are necessary for the Government and public service of the said provinces. Article 10. Telegrams passing through the cable shall be delivered at the station mentioned in the 6 th Article hereof, for the necessary purposes, so long as the requirements of the service do not call for a change oi the delivery station. Article 11. The Government will pay to the Concessionary of the LuzomHong-Kong cable a monthly subsidy of $4,000 for a period of 10 years, reckoned from the date of transmission over the submarine cable of the first despatch, so long as the cables are in good working order, for which effect the Concessionary will be required to produce a certificate from the Inspector to be named by Q 4248 Government. The above-mentioned subsidy shall be paid monthly by the Manila Treasury, one-third by the Treasury, and the remaining two-thirds by the local funds, as provided in similar cases. If, during the working of the cable, it should cease to transmit messages, the Government will not pay the subsidy so long as the interruption lasts ; but if it be repaired within the space of one year, the period of interruption shall not be taken into account ^ in the calculation of the subsidy in question. Article 12. The Concessionary shall enjoy an exclusive privilege for 40 years, during which period it shall not be lawful for the Government to grant the right of laying any other cable between the points mentioned in this concession. The Government reserves to itself the right of suspending the transmission of messages over the cable, if they should appear dangerous to the security of the State, in conformity with the stipulation of the last International Telegraph Convention, the regulations of which shall apply to this telegraph route so long as they do not clash with the clauses of this concession. Article 13. The cable must be laid and working in good electrical condition within the term of two years, reckoned from the date of the definitive concession. If it should not be so laid, or, if through causes under the control of the Contractor, it should prove useless for the service within the term above- mentioned, the concession shall be null and void, and the deposit shall be forfeited. On proof being given that the suspension of working has been brought about by the breaking of the cable, or by unforeseen accidents in the laying, the above-mentioned term shall be extended by one year. In the event of the conductors becoming useless, even from causes beyond the control of the Contractor, during the period of the concession, he shall be bound to replace them so that communication may be restored within a period not exceeding one year. In default of this being done within that time, the concession shall be considered null and void. Article 14.

Madrid, 14th December 1878. Approved by His Majesty. Klduayen.250 Mr. Warden Morice’s Letter. H. E. tlie Minister the Colonies, Madrid. Sir, Madrid, 21 st February 1879. On the 14th instant I had the honour to present to your Excellency a proposal of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company, and of the Company which owns and works the great submarine telegraph lines of the Indies, China and Australia, relative to the laying and working of a telegraphic cable between Hong Kong and the Island of Luzon. I was anxious to include in my proposal a very important concession in favoui of the State, viz., that of the absolute freedom from charge of all official messages during the 40 years of the concession, and I had already written to London in that sense, but, owing to the difficulty of getting together the Boards of the two companies, and submitting my indication for their approval, it was only this morning that 1 received a telegram sanctioning my suggestion. ^ . Although the last article of the Royal Decree of the 14th December stipulates that the Council of Ministers will select the proposal which they consider most advantageous to the State, having regard chiefly to the question ol the subvention, your Excellency will readily perceive that the concession which I have now the honour tor offer, surpasses by a great deal an insio-ni- hcant diminution of the monthly sum payable to the Concessionary, or a slight reduction of the number of years mentioned in the 11 th Article of the schedule of conditions. . M y present offer being therefore highly advantageous to the State, and it being in evidence that I have already undertaken, in the name of the companies which I represent, to establish the telegraphic communication m 18 months, and considering, moreover, the high position of the companies, and the undoubted guarantee which they offer in connection with the laying and working of the projected cable, I trust that your Excellency, consulting the best interests of the valuable Colony of the Philippines, will sanction the amendments of my tender in the sense indicated; the 16th Article of the schedule of conditions being altered therefore to the following form Article 16. The official correspondence of the Government will be transmitted free of charge through the cable, and with right of priority, during the 40 years of the concession. W. Warden Morjce.

F. litgen, President of the Danish-Norwegian-English felegraph Company, and to the merchant G. G. Ericsen, Director of the Private bank at Copenhagen and Member of the Board of the aforesaid Company, a concession for the establishment and working of a submarine cable connecting the telegraphs of Russia and Denmark on the following conditions: &amp; Article 1. A submarine cable shall be laid down starting from the Russian coast n ear Hibau, on the Baltic Sea, from a point to be chosen by mutual agree* ment between the Russian Government and the concessionaires and touching the Island of Bornholm to extend to the Island of Mena, or Zeeland to a point to be selected by the Danish Government. * Article 2. I he submaiine cable may be laid down in single line between Libau and Bornholm, but between Bornholm and the terminal point on the coast it shall be laid down at least in two lines, one of which shall be destined exclusively for telegraphic messages with Russia, and the other for the internal tele graph communications of Denmark. In case of injury to the former, the second line shall be used for Russian telegraphic messages. The transmission of telegrams shall be effected along the whole line of the cable, direct between its terminal points without tl,5 intermediary station at Bornholm. So soon as the telegraphic messages shall increase to such an extent that one line shall appear to be insufficient the concessionaires shall be obliged to lay down a supplementary cable consisting of one or several lines according to the requirements and demands of the Russian Government Article 3. The concessionaires shall be obliged to connect at their own expense the submarine cables with the overhead land lines of the Empire, and to control the working order of these cables, as also of the connections. To them shall be assigned also the right of appointment of their own staff of officials at the station constructed at the point where the cable shall be laid on the Russian coast. The appointment to their posts of persons employed by the concessionaires shall be permitted not otherwise than with the approval of the Telegraph Department. The Russian Government reserves to itself the control of telegrams as also the right of supervision over the employes of the concessionaires in respect of the proper execution of their duties, and in a like manner of demanding the dismissal of any of them whom it may consider necessary to dismiss. In the event of the concessionaires desiring to transfer to the Government the exercise of the duties of the station, the remuneration for such duties shall be fixed by mutual consent between the concessionaires and the Government. R 4264 Article 4. All telegraph regulations relating to telegraphic messages exchanged between Russia and Denmark, as also to those transmitted beyond the coniines of both countries, shall be applicable to telegraphic messages conveyed along the cable. Service telegrams of the Telegraph Department shall be transmitted free of charge along the whole line of cable. Article 5. The concessionaires undertake to enter into agreement with the Danish- Norwegian-English Telegraph Company for the purpose of securing the direct transmission of Russo-English telegraphic messages, and subjecting the same to all the rules of the telegraph service established by international conven tion and the present concession. Article 6. The period for completing the work of laying down the cable shall not exceed one year, reckoning from the day of issue of the latter concession by either of the Governments concerned in this undertaking. Should the termination of this period occur between the 1st October and the 1st May the term shall be extended to the following September. Should any obstacles to the completion of the work arise from such causes as cannot be attributed to the remissness of the concessionaires, there shall be extended to them a further period of one year, and should this extended period expire between the 1st October and the 1st May, such period may be prolonged until the following May or June. Article 7. Should the cable not be laid down during the year 1868, the conces sionaires shall bind themselves to pay as security the sum of 10,000 roubles silver to the Telegraph Department. This security shall be forfeited to the Government so soon as the said lines shall not be completed within the period specified in the foregoing article. Article 8. The rate for the transmission of each telegram of 20 words between Russia and Denmark shall be 8|- francs, of which 5 francs shall represent the rate of transmission of such telegram through European Russia (exclusive of the Caucasus) and 3J francs the rate for transmission of the telegram by cable and within the confines of Denmark. The rate for transmission of telegrams between European Russia and London shall be 12 francs; between European Russia and other stations in Great Britain, 13 francs. In both cases the rate for transmission of telegrams through European Russia shall be 5 francs. The rates of 5 and 3J,- francs for transmission of telegrams through European Russia, as also for their transmission through Denmark and by cable, shall be the same also for transit telegrams. Should, owing to a reduction in the rates of other overhead land telegraphs, it be deemed necessary to adopt a general scale of charges for transmission of telegrams by cable, lower than the foregoing, the rate for their transmission through European Russia shall be reduced for telegraphic communication with Denmark to one-half and for telegraphic communication with England to one-third of the general reduction. No reduction in the Russian rates shall be made if the Anglo-Danish cable shall not belong to a private company. Article 9. The Russian Government shall grant the concessionaires a subsidy of 1 franc for every telegram transmitted by the Russo-Danish cable. From this shall be excepted Government and service telegrams, as also telegrams transmitted to all the stations in Great Britain, excepting London. The latter exception shall be rescinded so soon as there shall exist no difference for the transmission of telegrams within the confines of England.Hie afoiesaid suhsidy shall, however, not exceed 40,000 francs per annum. Should the number of telegrams exceed 80,000 per annum the subsidy shall be reduced by 50 centimes per telegram. So soon as the number of telegrams attain 100,000 per anmim the subsidy shall cease, but should in the future, owing to unforeseen circumstances, the number of telegrams be under 100,000 per annum, the subsidy shall again be renewed in accordance with the foregoing conditions. Article 10. In compensation for outlay incurred in the establishment of the cable this concession shall be granted for 30 years, dhe Russian Government binds itself during the course of this period to extend to no one else the right of laying down a direct submarine telegraph communication between the two countries.

Article 11. The concession shall cease and the concessionaires shall have the right to demand no compensation so soon as they shall fail to observe the foregoing conditions. In a like manner it shall cease in the event of the line remaining inactive during the course of a whole year, owing to causes resulting from the fault of the concessionaires. This shall include cases of failure to repair damage to the cable as also in the event of the Danish Government 'with drawing the concession owing to the concessionaires having failed to observe its conditions. Article 12. The Russian Government reserves to itself the right of granting a new concession to any person it chooses, and on any conditions it may lay down, when the present concession shall cease on the expiration of 30 years, as specified in Article 10. The holders of the present concession shall, however, enjoy the right of preference in the event of their desiring to accept the new conditions to be determined by the Russian Government. Article 13. The concessionaires shall have the right to transfer this concession with all the privileges and obligations conferred on them under the same to other private persons or companies, but not otherwise than with the consent of the Russian Government.

VII.— Odessa to Constantinople, 1874.* Concession for the Establishment and Exploitation of a Submarine Telegraphic Line between Odessa and Constantinople. C. F. Titgen, Royal Danish Councillor of State, undertakes to form a company on shares, or a partnership, either full or in allotments, for the establishment and exploitation of a submarine telegraph line between Odessa and Constantinople on the following terms :— I. For the establishment of a submarine telegraphic connection between Odessa and Constantinople a cable is to be laid across the Black Sea from the Russian coast near Odessa to the Turkish coast near Constantinople. The points where the cable is to land on the coast shall be fixed on the Russian side by mutual agreement between the Russian Telegraphic Depart ment and the Company, and on the Ottoman side by agreement with the Turkish Telegraphic Administration. The latter landing place can be chosen only on the European shore of the Black Sea in the Bosphorus mouth. II. The submarine cable may be constructed at first with one conductor only. If, owing to the increase of correspondence, a single conductor should prove insufficient for transmission of despatches, then the Company shall be bound to construct such number of conductors as the Telegraphic Adminis trations of Russia and Turkey will consider necessary. # For copy of convention in respect of this cable concluded between the Russian and Turkish Governments in 1871, see under Turkey No. II. S 2 •276 The cable shall be manufactured according to the system acknowledged by practice as the best. III. The Company shall be bound to construct at their own cost the junction of the cable with the Government land line (wire) and with the telegraphic station nearest the landing place of the cable, which will be selected by the Russian Government for such junction; also at their own cost to take constant care of the cable and the junction land line (wire) and especially of the junction between this line and the cable, and to keep the whole in due order. IV. The Company shall place their officers for the telegraphic service at the Russian and Turkish Government stations in direct communication with the cable, not, however, without having previously obtained the permission of the respective Telegraphic Administrations. The transmission of despatches by the submarine line between Odessa and Constantinople shall be performed by officers engaged by the Company. Both in Russia and in Turkey the receiving from and delivery to the public of all the despatches sent or coining by the cable shall be entrusted to the Government officers only. Both Governments reserve to themselves a right of control over all the despatches transmitted by the officers of the Company. The Russian Government has the right to establish an inspection over the said officers on the Russian territory, and to require the dismissal of such of them whose dismissal should be considered necessary. Should the Company wish to transfer to the Russian Telegraphic Administration the performance of the cable service at the Russian station connected with the cable, it will depend on the said Administration to undertake such service on such conditions and for such remuneration as will be settled by mutual agreement between the Administration and the Company. V. The submarine cable shall be laid and opened for use within one year from the day of granting of this concession. If in consequence of unforeseen circumstances considered as valid by the Russian Government the execution and completion of the work within the time appointed should prove impossible, then a delay of one year more may be granted on mutual agreement between the Russsian and the Ottoman Governments. VI. As a security for the good execution of the laying of the cable and the opening of it for traffic within the time fixed, the Company shall, on receipt of the concession, deposit with the Russian Government a guarantee of fifty thousand (50/m) francs. This sum shall become the property of the Russian Government if the submarine cable is not laid and opened for traffic within the time fixed by section V. VII. The Company shall be allowed to import, free of duty, the materials required for the construction of the submarine cable of the junction and junction line with the shore station, but the amount of such materials imported must be restricted to the real requirements duly attested, and shall each time be subject to the confirmation of the Minister of Finance. VIII. In case of the cable being damaged the Company shall take the necessary steps for its being immediately repaired, and, if necessary, shall replace the damaged cable by a new one.277 IX. TIig tax to bo paid for tho despatches transmitted hy the submarine telegraph shall be composed of the terminal and transit taxes as fixed hy the International Convention, and the tax fixed for the use of the cable The tax for transmission of despatches by the cable shall not exceed six francs. Thus, the maximum tax for the correspondence interchanged between European Russia and European Turkey is fixed at 14 francs. In order to facilitate telegraphic correspondence between Odessa and Constantinople this tax is reduced to 12 francs, of which 3 francs 75 centimes are attributed to Russia, 2 francs 25 centimes to Turkey, and the residuary 6 francs to the Company. Should a general reduction of tariffs occur during the concession period, then the tax for the cable shall also be reduced proportionately. X. The manner and order of keeping money accounts with the Company for the despatches transmitted shall be determined by a special agreement between the Company and the Telegraphic Department. The balances, con verted into francs, shall be paid over at St. Petersburg at the St. Petersburg mean rate of exchange for the two weeks immediately preceding the day when the accounts are closed. XL All the stipulations contained in the telegraphic conventions now existing, or which may hereafter be concluded, shall be applied to the correspondence transmitted by the Company’s line. XII. The service despatches of the Russian Telegraphic Department, as also the despatches of the Company relative only to matters of telegraphic service between Odessa and Constantinople, and to Company's wants, shall be transmitted by the Company’s and the Russian lines free of payment. XIII. The present concession is granted for 30 years. During this period of time the Russian Government will not grant to any other party the permission of establishing a direct submarine telegraphic line between European Russia and European Turkey. XIV. The Company shall forfeit the concession before the expiration of the said period without any right to claim a remuneration in the following cases, namely:—(1) If the Company do not fulfil the terms of the concession ; (2) If the cable remains inactive during a whole year, and the reasons of such inactivity are not acknowledged as valid by the Russian Government; and (3) If the Turkish Government should withdraw the concession in consequence of non-fulfilment of its terms by the Company. XV. After expiration of the said 30 years the exclusive right of working a telegraphic cable between Odessa and Constantinople, now granted to the Company, shall cease ; the Company, however, shall preserve the right to hold and work their submarine telegraph, provided only all the terms imposed by this concession have been and will continue to be fulfilled, and the Russian and Turkish Governments do not by mutual agreement consider it proper and opportune to grant a new concession. In the case of a new convention being then concluded between the two Governments, the present Company shall be entitled to preference as to the accepting of the new terms. XVI. With regard to jurisdiction and responsibility in matters of business with the Government, and in all private matters in Russia, the Company and the Company’s officers shall be subject to all the laws of the Russian Empire, and the Company is bound to have an agency at St. Petersburg representing the Company’s firm during the whole period of the concession. A 39798. S 3278 XVII. All disputes and differences which may arise in the Russian territory with or between the officers of the Company are to be decided by the laws of the Russian Kmpire.

Decision of the Committee of Ministers Imperially confirmed and submitted to the Ruling Senate by the Minister of the Interior, on the 4th December 1875, respecting the Modification of Article 12 of the Concession for connecting the Telegraph Cables from Japan and China with the Russian Telegraphs. The Minister of the Interior submitted to the Ruling Senate his report of the 27th November 1872, Sub-No. 191, accompanied by the modified text of Article 12 of the concession for connecting the telegraph cables from Japan and China with the Russian telegraphs. In view of the new bases established by the International Telegraph Conference recently held in St. Petersburg for the calculation of rates lor non-European telegrams, the Great Northern Telegraph Company, holder of the concession, finds it necessary to establish, similarly as is done on other non-European lines, rates founded on the actual number of words contained in a telegram, or otherwise, a word rate which consequently would involve a modification of the telegram unit and the maximum rate specified in Article 12 of the concession. The Emperor, on the decision of the Committee of Ministers, was, on the 28th day of November 1875, pleased to Imperially confirm the modification in question. Article 12 of the Concession for connecting the 1 elegrapii C ables from Japan with the Russian Telegraphs. Original Text.

IX.— Modification of Rates provided for under No. VII., 1876. No. 309.—27th February, 1876. Decision of the Committee of Ministers Imperially confirmed and submitted to the Ruling Senate by the Minister of the Interior on the 6th March 1876, respecting the Amplification of Article 9 of the Concession for the Establishment and Working of a Submarine Telegraph Line betwopn Odessa and Constantinople. ' e en The Report of the Minister of the Interior of the 8th February 1873 Sub-No. 16, was submitted to the Ruling Senate, accompanied by a copy of the Concession granted by Imperial Order on the 26th day of January of the same year, to the Royal Danish Councillor of State Titgen for the establish ment and working of a submarine telegraph line between Odessa and Constantinople. After experimental exploitation of this line, it was considered advan tageous, by agreement between the Directions of the Russian and Turkish Telegraphs, and the Black Sea Telegraph Company, the present holders of the Concession, to reduce the rate specified in Article 9 in favour of the Company, with the object of equalising the rate for the transmission of Russo- Turkish telegraphic messages by the submarine line through the Black Sea with the rate leviable for the transmission of the same telegraphic messao-es through Roumania. The Emperor, on the decision of the Committee of Ministers, was on the 27th day of February of the current year, pleased Imperially to confirm the amplification of Article 9 of the Concession, made in accordance with the said Agreement. On the original is inscribed : “ The Emperor was pleased to peruse this “ and Imperially confirm it at St, Petersburg on the 27th day of February “ 1876.” Kahanoff, Secretary of State, Secretary to the Committee of Ministers.280 Article 9 of the Concession granted by Imperial Order on the 26th day of January 1873, for the Establishment and Working of a Submarine Telegraph Line between Odessa and Constantinople.

No. 969.—16th July 1876. Imperially confirmed Decision of the Committee of Ministers submitted to the Ruling Senate by the Minister of the Interior on the 29th July, respecting the Establishment and Maintenance by the Great Northern Telegraph Company of a Submarine Telegraph Line between the Finnish Coast and the Island of Aland. The Abo Company for insurance against accidents at sep, and the ship owners of the island of Aland made application, through the Governor General281 of the Grand Duchy of Finland, for the inclusion of the said island of Aland within the telegraph system of the Empire, in order to extend to the local inhahitants the possibility of permanent means of communication of which they hitherto w^ere deprived owing to the cessation, during the spring and autumn, of the Postal Service. ^ On the examination of this request, there arose at the close of last year the question of the necessity of establishing between the shores of Russia and Sweden a line supplementary to the Russo-Swedish telegraph cable existing between Nystadt and Grislehamn. In view of the fact that the Great Northern Telegraph Company enjoys, in virtue of the Concession granted by Imperial Order on the 21st August 1869 (Article 12), the exclusive right of establishment of submarine telegraph cables between the shores of Russia and Sweden, the Russian Telegraph Department entered into negotiations with the said Company with the object that the latter should lay down a cable from the Finnish coast to the island of Aland with the option of extending this cable to Stockholm. r l he conditions under which the Northern Company should establish and maintain the Aland cable were submitted by the Minister of the Interior to the Committee of Ministers for consideration and on the recommendation of the said Committee they were Imperially confirmed on the 16th day of July of the current year. On the original is inscribed, “ The Emperor was pleased to peruse these “ conditions and Imperially ratify them at Peterhoff, this 16th day of July “ 1869.” Kahanoff, Secretary of State, Secretary to the Committee of Ministers. Conditions for the Establishment and Maintenance by the Great Northern Telegraph Company of a Submarine Telegraph Line between the Finnish Coast and the Island of Aland. 1. The Company shall undertake to lay down at its own expense a telegraph cable between the southern coast of Finland (Sundholm, near Nystadt) and a point on the North-Eastern coast of the island of Aland to be selected by mutual agreement with the Telegraph Department. The cable shall be manufactured of one conducting wire and in the manner most approved by experience. 2. The cable shall be laid down and completed for use during the year 1876. In the event of unforeseen circumstances occuring, preventing the completion of the work within the specified term and acknowledged by the Telegraph Department to be well founded, such term may be extended to the 31st August 1877. 3. The Company shall undertake to maintain the cable at its own expense in complete order; and shall likewise at its own expense erect and maintain the cable stations on the coast at both ends of the line, to place and keep in working order the gear and apparatus essential for the maintenance of telegraphic service at the station at Nystadt. 4. The Government shall establish and maintain at its own expense a telegraph station on the island of Aland, as also the connecting lines between the points of the cable on the coasts and the Russian stations on both shores. The Government shall furnish the station at Aland with the necessary apparatus and gear, and maintain them at its own expense. 5. The maintenance of service at the station in Nystadt shall be at the expense of the Company, and carried on by persons employed by it on conditions established for service on the Russo-Swedish cable. If the station of the Russo-Swedish cable shall be eventually transferred from Nystadt to another town, the Company shall continue to maintain the service of the Aland cable only in the event of this service having been also transferred to the same town. 6 . The service on the Aland station shall be carried on at the expense of the Russian Government and by persons employed by the same. The282 Company shall, however, appoint to this station an electrieian specially for supervision over the state of the cable. 7. In remuneration for the establishment of a submarine telegraph line, for its maintenance and for its use, the Russian Government shall pay the Company 3,000 francs per month from the day of immersion of the cable to the expiration of the term of the present Agreement. This remuneration shall be payable to the Company quarterly with other payments to the Company. The remuneration shall be reduced by 1,000 francs per month in the event of the Company, on immersion of the cable between the island of Aland and the Swedish coast, being able to transmit telegrams between Russia and Sweden by the Nystadt-Aland line. 8 . On payment to the Company of the above stated remuneration to the extent of 3,000 francs per month, 100 francs shall be retained from the Company for every day the cable between Nystadt and Aland may be damaged. When the remuneration shall be payable at the rate of 2000 francs per month, 665 francs shall be retainable for every day both the cables from the island of Aland to the coasts of Russia and Sweden shall be simultaneously in a state of disrepair. Should the cable remain inactive during the course of one year for reasons considered insufficient by the Russian Government, or should the Company cease to fulfil the obligations accepted by it in virtue of these conditions the Russian Government shall reserve to itself the right of considering the present agreement to have lost force, and to take other steps for the establishment of telegraph communication between Aland and the coast of Finland. 9. On the expiration of the term of the present Agreement the payment of remuneration to the Company shall cease, and the Government shall acquire the right of free transmission along the Nystadt-Aland cable of all telegrams sent from the island of Aland or addressed to the same. 10. The Company undertakes to apply to the Swedish Government for permission to immerse a submarine telegraph line between the western coast of the island of Aland and Sweden (Grislehamn) and for the establishment by the said Government of an overhead land connecting line between Grislehamn and Stockholm. The point at which this cable shall be laid on the Aland coast shall be selected by mutual agreement between the Telegraph Department and the Company. The connecting line between the cable and station on the island of Aland, maintaining the cable service between Aland and Nystadt shall be established and maintained by the Russian Government ; at the same time this station shall be adapted for the transmission of telegrams exchanged between Finland and Sweden. The Russian Government shall support at its own expense the cable service on the island of Aland, while the Company shall at its own expense immerse and maintain the cable and the station house on the coast. 11. The establishment of a telegraph line between the island of Aland and Sweden is considered in every respect to be an ordinary duplication of the submarine telegraph line between Nystadt and Grislehamn at present in existence. For the telegraph line between Aland and Sweden are reserved the same exclusive privileges, compensation, and subsidies as are extended to the Company under the concession granted by Imperial Order on the 21st August 1869 and the supplementary articles to the same Imperially confirmed on the 9th February 1873. 12. The Company shall be exempt from payment of Customs duty on the importation of materials necessary for the establishment of telegraph communication forming the subject of this Agreement. 13. The present Agreement respecting the payment to the Great Northern Company of remuneration for the establishment and maintenance of a cable between the western coast of Finland and island of Aland shall remain in „ .. , 21st August __ force until the September 1899 'f 283 In all cases when doubt shall arise as to the exact purport of this ient ^ 1G Corr, P an y shall abide by the final decision of the Committee ox Ministers.

XI.— Further Modification of Rates provided for under No. VII., 1881. No. 258. Respecting the Modification of Article 9 of the Concession granted for the Establishment and \\ orking of a Submarine Telegraph Line between Odessa and Constantinople. Bulletin of Laws, No. 2, for 1873, promulgates the terms of the Con cession granted by Imperial Order on the 26th day of January 1873 to the Danish subject 1 itgen, Councillor of State, for the establishment and working of a submarine telegraph line between Odessa and Constantinople. This Concession was transferred to the Black Sea Telegraph Company established by the Concessionaire. Article 9 of the Concession determines the rates leviable. This article, by decision of the Committee of Ministers Imperially confirmed on the 2/th day of February Ift/O, was modified owing to the agreement concluded at the International Telegraph Conference, held at St. Petersburg, between the delegates of the Russian and Turkish Governments and the representatives of the Black Sea Company, respecting the reduction of the cable rates of the Company from 6 francs to 1 franc for telegraphic correspondence exchanged between Russia and Turkey, Greece and Italy. This modification was published in the Bulletin of Laws, No. 26, of the year 1876. It has now been found necessary to,further modify Article 9 of the Concession owing to a new agreement having been effected between the same parties respecting rates established by the introduction at the London Telegraph Conference of a word rate for International messages in lieu of the former twenty word system. In order that Article 9 of the Concession should not suffer any further alteration on the introduction of changes in the telegraph rates, and to avoid rates based on figures which would deprive such article of fixity, the draft of this article containing general provisions for the fixture of rates for the Black Sea route, as also for the determination of the Government subsidy payable to the Company on the reduction of the cable rates, was submitted by the late Minister of Posts and Telegraphs to the Committee of Ministers for consideration. The Emperor, on the decision of the Committee of Ministers, was pleased on the 27th day of March 1881 to confirm the proposed modification of Article 9 of the Concession. On the original is inscribed “ The Emperor was pleased to peruse this “ and Imperially confirm it at St. Petersburg, this 27th day of March 1881.” Mausuroff, Secretary of State, Secretary to the Committee of Ministers. Article 9 of the Concession Imperially confirmed on the 26th day of Januarv 1873 for the Establishment and V orking of a Submarine Telegraph Line between Odessa Original Text.

The rate payable for the transmission of telegrams by cable shall not exceed 6 francs. In this manner the maximum rates for telegraphic correspondence exchanged between European Russia and European Turkey shall be fixed at 14 francs. For facilitating telegraphic com munication between Odessa and Con stantinople the rate shall be reduced to 12 francs, of which 3 francs 75 centimes shall be payable to Russia, 2 francs 25 centimes to Turkey, and 6 francs to the Company. In the event of the Company establishing a rate of 1 franc for the transmission by cable of a single tele gram of 20 words, and the Turkish Government ceding to the Company 1 franc out of its terminal rate for a single telegram transmitted by the Black Sea cable, the Russian Government shall, on its part, cede to the Company, out of the terminal rate payable to the former, the sum of 2 francs for each such single telegram. On service telegrams and on telegrams, the free transmission of which has been established by Inter national Convention, no deductions from the terminal rates payable to the Russian Government shall be made. If, during the term of the Con cession, a general reduction of the tariff should follow, the cable rates shall be lowered proportionately with such reduction. Modified Text. For the purpose of facilitating’com- munications between Russia and Turkey, and of transmitting the tele graphic messages of other nations by the Black Sea cable, the transit rate of the Company may be reduced by special agreement between the latter and the Governments of Russia and Turkey. In the event of a reduction of the transit cable rates, the Company shall receive an allowance from the Russian Rates, which shall not exceed double the reduction of the cable rates. On service telegrams, and on telegrams, the free transmission of which has been established by Inter national Convention, no deductions from the terminal rates payable to the Russian Government shall be made. If, during the term of the Con cession, a general reduction of the tariff should follow, the cable rates shall be lowered proportionately with such reduction.

Respecting the Modification of Articles 10 and 12 of the Concession granted by Imperial Order on the 6th day of September 1868, for the Establishment and Working of a Submarine Telegraph Line connecting the Telegraphs of Russia and Denmark. The report of Adjutant-General Timasheff, late Minister of the Interior, of the 10th September 1868, Sub-No. 233, was submitted to the Ruling Senate, accompanied by a copy of the concession for the establishment and working of a submarine telegraph line connecting the telegraphs of Russia and Denmark granted by Imperial Order on the 6th September of the same year for a period of 30 years to the State Councillor Titgen and the merchant Ericsen. The immersion of a cable by the Company between the Russian and Danish coasts, rendering possible the exchange by this cable of telegraphic messages between Russia and Denmark and the West of Europe, and the same Company having laid down a cable from the Asiatic frontier of Russia to Japan and China, has finally secured to Russia the independent transit route for the transmission of telegraphic messages exchanged between France, England and America, and the Far East. In view of the increase of Russian telegraphic messages transmitted by the Russo-Danish cable, the necessity of laying down supplementary cables for opening up new routes which would secure to Russia the possibility of exchanging her messages with foreign nations independently from any neigh bouring country became a matter of constant consideration for the Northern Company. Such supplementary cables have now been laid down between Denmark and England and France in two lines. In order to establish permanently the independent transmission of Russian telegraphic messages with Japan and China, and to secure the transit route for telegraphic messages exchanged between the Far East and Western Europe and America, in the event of damage to the cable connecting Russia with Japan and China, it was found necessary to lay down a second cable, to which the Northern Company, possessing the cables from Vladivostok to Japan and China, assented, and at the same time requested an extension of the term of the concession granted it for the establishment and working of287 a submarine cable between Russia and Japan and China as well as of that ^t Ren O r'TQ n t t 9 0ned co ™T ion of the 6th September 1868 to the 31st Oecember 1912, in consideration of the double object which would dte EtierotonTheT ^ lmi ^‘ ion ° f % Periods of both concessions. 13th IvTTCst i sst ni’ 11 i T e Com ™ ttee of Ministers, was, on the nay ot August 1882, pleased Imperially to confirm the nroiected modification of the corresponding articles of the said concession J On the original is inscribed, “The Emperor was pleased to peruse this and Imperially confirm it at Peterhoff, on the 13th day of August 1882.” SCIIOLTZ, Assistant Secretary to the — Committee of Ministers.

In order to establish permanently the independent transmission of Russian telegraphic messages with Japan and China and to secure the transit route for telegraphic messages exchanged between the Far East and Western Europe and America in case of damage to the cable, consisting of a single line, connecting Russia with Japan and China, it was found necessary to lay down a second cable, to which the Northern Company assented and at the same time requested that in compensation for the considerable outlays necessary for laying down a second cable, the term of the concession granted to the latter be extended to the 31st December 1912. The Emperor, in virtue of the decision of the Committee of Ministers, was, on the 13th day of August 1882, pleased Imperially to confirm the projected modifications of the corresponding articles of the said concession.

Tire Indo-European Telegraph Company, acting on the bases of the Concession granted it by Supreme Order on the Kith of November 1873, for the organisation and working within the boundaries of Russia of a direct telegraphic communication between Europe and India binds itself, by virtue of the present Concession, which replaces that of the IGth of November 1873, to maintain and exploit the said line on the following conditions :— Article 1. 1. The Company undertakes to continually keep in perfect order the telegraph line constructed by it from the Alexandrowskaia station of the Warsaw-Vienna Railway to Odessa, with three conducting wires; from Odessa to Kertch, with two conducting wires ; from Kertch to Kouta'is, with three conducting wires ; and from Kouta'is to Djoulfa, on the Persian frontier, with two conducting wires. 2. The Company is granted the right of establishing on the route reserved for its working (Clause 1) by agreement with the General Administration of Posts and Telegraphs, additional wires for the purpose of increasing the means of communication. 3. The telegraph wire shall be of the best iron of six millimetres in diameter, with the exception of the third conducting wire of the Kertch- Koutais Line, for which a five millimetre wire shall be allowed. Only such insulators as shall have been proved by experiments to have the greatest strength and insulating power may be used. The posts shall be either of iron or of strong Avood, and shall be firm enough to bear the weight of a considerable number of conducting Avires. In the Steppes, Avhere there may be reason to fear an accumulation of frost and ice on the wire, the number of posts shall be proportionately increased. 4. The line reserved to be exploited by the Company shall be supplied with apparatus on the best system and of the best quality, and it shall, as far as possible, be supplied with all the latest improvements, according to the requirements of modern telegraphy. 5. Any improvements or alterations in the existing construction of the line and stations can only be effected after the obtaining of the previous permission of the General Administration of Posts and Telegraphs. 6. The Company shall maintain on the line reserved for its exploitation (Clause 1) not less than five stations for the transmission of messages from the Government lines on to the line reserved to be exploited by the Company and vice versa. The said stations must be established, as far as possible, in the buildings of the Government telegraphs, and the expenses arising therefrom shall be borne by the Company. Should there not be found any convenient place in the said buildings, the Company shall be bound to find the necessary places elseAAdiere at its oAvn expense : but, in that event, it shall be also bound to maintain a telegraphic or pneumatic connection between its station and that of the Government. 7. The Government is entitled to entrust to its oavu officials the supervision of the maintenance of the line. * * It lias not been found possible to obtain a copy of this Concession, ivhich apparently replaced that of 1867. The earlier Concession is in the same terms, mutatis mutandis, as the German Concession of the same date— see pages 42-4d of the Second Annexe, dated November 1900, to the printed Memorandum of 13th October 1899. In the case of Russia, however, the Company themselves provided the telegraph line, and the Russian share of the traffic receipts wag twice as great as in the case of Germany.293 Article 2. 1. The line reserved to be exploited by the Company (Article 1, Clause 1) is intended solely for the transmission through Russia of telegrams in transit from India or to India. Should telegrams in transit addressed to India enter Russia by other lines, the Administration of Posts and Telegraphs will be bound to pass on such telegrams to the line reserved for exploitation by the Company. 2. The Company is entitled to transmit over the line reserved to be exploited by it also telegraphic messages in transit through Russia from the countries situate beyond India. The Administration of Posts and Telegraphs shall not be bound to transfer to the line reserved for exploitation by the Company, for further transmission, telegrams coming over the Russian Government lines and addressed to countries situate beyond India, except the sender of the telegram has himself desired the telegram to be sent via India, or unless the Administration of Posts and Telegraphs shall itself consider it necessary to choose this route for the transmission. 3. The Company binds itself to transmit over the line reserved for its exploitation Russian messages from Russia to India and countries situate beyond India ; but the Administration of Posts and Telegraphs reserves to itself the right to pass the said messages, as it may deem fit, on to other telegraphic lines, whether now existing or that may be constructed in the future. 4. The Company is also granted the right of transmitting over the line reserved for its exploitation Perso-European and Turco-European telegrams sent in transit through Russia ; but the Administration of Posts and Telegraphs is not bound to pass such telegrams reaching the Russian lines from abroad on to the line reserved for exploitation by the Company. 5. All telegrams which should pass in Russia over the line reserved for exploitation by the Company shall be transmitted for the purpose of being sent to its stations through such Government telegraph offices as shall be connected with the stations of the Company (Article 1, Clause 0). All telegrams coming from India and from countries situate beyond India and addressed to Russia shall be transmitted from the stations of the Company to the proper Government telegraph office for the purpose of being forwarded to the addressees. The Company and all its servants in Russia are forbidden to have any direct connection with the public for receiving or delivering telegrams from or to such pidDbc. 6. Besides the above-named messages there may be transmitted over the line reserved for exploitation by the Company all Russian messages, whether local or in transit, as far as this may be allowable without injury to the Indo-European service.

Article 3. 1. The telegraph line reserved for exploitation by the Company (Article 1, Clause 1) is considered as a Government institution, and, as far as concerns its maintenance and protection, it enjoys all the rights of such an institution. Consequently, the Company, without the payment of any indemnity, enjoys all the lands'occupied by the line reserved for its exploitation in the towns and villages along the railway lines, highways, and ordinary roads. As regards the property of private persons and communities, the Company enjoys the right of expropriation in such proportion as the Government may consider necessary. -it • r i t 2.

Article 4. For international telegraphic messages transmitted along the line reserved for exploitation by the Company (Article 1, Clause 1) there shall be in force29i the tariffs decided upon by the International Telegraphic Convention and Regulations.

The third, being adapted to very deep localities, shall also be constructed in the manner described above ; only the external coating shall be covered over with six iron wires which shall have a coating of tarred Manila hemp. This last sample, of the third description, shall be conformable with the wires employed for the American submarine cables which have been proved to be the best and the most substantial for deep water. The sample of the first category shall be laid down according to the requirements of the localities in places of an average depth of 6 U metres from the sea-shore, and the sample of the second category in continuation of the first sample shall be laid down in places of an average depth of 150^metres according to the requirements of the localities, and certain sections shall absolutely be composed of these two samples. The third sample shall be laid down in places exceeding a depth of 150 metres. Article 4. Each maritime mile of the said cable shall have an electric power (called electric resistance) of 2,000 million degrees according to the Siemens’ system and a propagation (called electric conductivity) of a celerity of 12 degrees likewise according to Siemens’ system.

Article IS. Misunderstandings which may arise between the Imperial Telegraph Administration and the Company in consequence of the execution of the articles stipulated in the present Convention, shall be decided at Constan tinople without appeal by the Council of State. Memorandum. In 1876 the Eastern Telegraph Company asked from the Imperial Government the Concession of the Ottoman Aerial Line between Con stantinople and Fao. This request was taken into consideration by the Ottoman Telegraph Administration, then directed by His Excellency Yaver Pacha. After negotiations between the Imperial Government and M. Jules Despecher, the attorney of the Company, a project of concession was drawn up, and afterwards approved by the two parties interested on the 5th/17th April 1876. This project was afterwards submitted to the Council of State which also approved it with the exception of some small modifications which it thought necessary to insert therein. At this period, that is to say, towards the commencement of the year 1877, the war becoming imminent, the Company did not consider the moment opportune for immediately completing the concession, and the settlement of this affair was deferred until a more favourable time. Towards the month of October of the same year the directors of the Eastern Telegraph Company, being at Constantinople on a voyage of pleasure, expressed the desire to conclude the Convention definitely, and to commence the w'ork immediately. The Telegraph Administration however, while not entirely rejecting the proposition of the directors of the Company, did not see fit at once to accept it. One of the reasons of this postponement was the presence in Constanti nople of Major Champain, who had succeeded in concluding arrangements with the Imperial Telegraph Administration, relative to the same Indian line, an arrangement which, nevertheless, remained eventually without effect. The directors of the Eastern Company having had an audience with His Highness Edhem Pacha, then Grand Vizier, the latter expressed to them a desire to see the state lines in the province of Yemen connected with the Red Sea cables either by laying a cable from Djedda to Suez, or by submerging one between Mokka and Aden. The directors assured His Highness that the execution of this arrangement could be performed in the period of three weeks, provided, however, that the establishment of this cable was made part of the concession for the Indian line. Although the agent of the Company at Constantinople proposed to re-open negotiations on the subject of the above, up to the present nothing has been done. Now that on the one hand the Eastern Telegraph Company and the administration of the Indo-European Telegraph have combined, so far as concerns the Indo-European traffic, and on the other hand the Imperial Government expresses anew the desire to connect its Yemen lines with the cables of the Company, the latter is disposed to re-open negotiations for the Indian line according to the basis of the concession previously concluded, on condition of reconciling the conditions of the primitive concession with the325 conditions which may be concluded for the establishment of the cable to connect the lines of the Government with the submarine communications of the Company m the Red Sea. INote transmitted to the Grand Vizier by the Direction-General of telegraphs, under No. 37, and of date the 3rd/15th June 1878. 1 have the honour to submit to your Highness the letter herewith enclosed which has been addressed to me by the attorneys of the Eastern Telegraph Company, Limited, of London, and by which they have notified to me that your Highness, having already authorised the laying of a cable by the above- mentioned Company between Constan tinople and Salonica, the ship containing the cable will arrive on Tuesday next at Constantinople, in order to proceed with the work of laying. I beg to solicit the authority of your Highness, consequently to take the necessary steps to fulfil that which concerns the Direction-General of -telegraphs. Grand Vizier’s Reply to the Director-General under date 10th/12th June 1878. I have taken cognisance of the communication of your Excellency, as well as the contents of the accompanying letter. There cannot be any objection to the action taken by the above-named Company. We _ consequently grant our consent to its laying the cables in question. We invite you, moreover, by the present notice, for this purpose also to fulfil that which is incumbent upon the Direction General of Telegraphs. Safvet. Constantinople, 15 June 1878.

Cj entlemen, I HAVE received the letter which you have done me the honour to address to me, under date 15th instant, by which you inform me that a definite agreement having been established between the Imperial Govern ment and yourselves, after modification of certain clauses and conditions of the Convention concluded with my Administration the 22nd March/3rd April 1878, His Highness the Grand Vizier had authorised you, by the intervention of M. Marinitsch, 2nd Dragoman of the English Embassy, to commence immediately the laying of the cables, which are the subject of the said Convention. I hasten to communicate your letter to His Highness the Grand Vizier with the object of obtaining official confirmation of it. a 39798. X 3326 I have the honour to communicate to you a copy of the ^Vizerial letter which I have received, in virtue of which the Imperial Govermnent authorises you to commence the laying of the cables of which it treats, pending the ratification of the said Convention. # I have also given the necessary instructions to Emile Lacoine Effendi, chief of the technical bureau of my Administration, that he is to put himself at your disposition. Instructions shall also be sent to the local authorities to facilitate the landing of the cables. Accept, Ac., The Director-General, M. Izzet. Messrs. W. P. Binney and George Serpos, Representatives of the Eastern Telegraph Company, Limited (of London), Constantinople. Arrangement concluded between His Excellency Izzet Effendi, Director- General of the Posts and Telegraphs of the Ottoman Empire, and Messrs. W. P. Binney, Divisional-Manager, and G. Serpos, Agent, Representatives and Attorneys of the Eastern Telegraph Company, Limited, of London :— Article 1. It is agreed and concluded that the sum of 8,0001. sterling, already paid to the Eastern Telegraph Company, conformably to the additional article of the contract of the 8th/20th February 1878, shall only be returned to the telegraph department in case the traffic exchanged by the Constantinople- Salonica Cable shall produce a net profit of 10 per cent, per annum upon the capital of 100 , 000 L sterling required for the establishment of the said cable. In case this profit shall be attained and the return of the sum of 8 , 000 Z. sterling shall be acquired on this count to the Telegraph Department, its reimbursement to the Department shall be effected by amiual instalments of 1 , 000 b each. Article 2. It is equally agreed and concluded that the Imperial Telegraph Adminis tration shall direct by the cables which the Eastern Telegraph Company has been authorised to lay in virtue of the Vizerial letter dated 10th/22nd June 1878, and which is the object of the Convention in course of ratification :— (а) Messages arising from and destined for Turkey-in-Asia as well as messages arising from and destined for India and countries beyond India. In addition to the above correspondences it is agreed and concluded that the Imperial Telegraph Administration will direct as far as possible by these same cables; ( б ) Messages both international arising from and destined for Turkey-in- Europe, and internal messages following the direction of the said cables. Done in duplicate for one and the same effect by His Excellency Izzet Effendi, Director-General of the Posts and Telegraphs of the Ottoman Empire, and Messrs. W. P. Binney, divisional manager, and G.

Cable between Crete and Syra to provide Alternative Route (via Greece) between Turkey and Crete. Project of Convention concluded between His Excellency Izzet Effendi, Director-General of the Posts and Telegraphs of the Ottoman Empire, and Messrs. W. P. Binney, Divisional-Manager, and George Serpos, agent,327 representatives and attorneys of the li/astern Telegraph Company, Limited, of London. It has been agreed and concluded as follows :— Article I. • object of establishing a new route of telegraphic communication with the Vila}et of the island of Crete, the Imperial Ottoman Government authorises the Eastern Telegraph Company to lay a cable between Syra and Candia (Island of Crete). Ihe Eastern telegraph Company engages to obtain from the Greek Government the right to land this cable at Syra. The cable from Syra to Candia (Island of Crete), shall be submitted to the same conditions and clauses as the other cables of the Company, landing on the island of Crete, which are the object of the Concession dated 14 Redjev 1287. The terminal tax of two francs fixed in the tables of the Telegraph Convention of St. Petersburg for the island of Crete, and constituting the proportion of the Imperial Government, shall be applied equally to the international telegrams destined for the island of Crete, which shall follow the route of the Syra- Candia cable. For the telegrams originating in Turkey destined for the island of Crete, which may be directed by the Syra-Candia cable, and in addition to the tax belonging to the Company, fixed for the section of the above-mentioned cable, the Imperial Telegraph Administration will collect on these telegrams and for its proportion of the taxes, in francs equivalent to the taxes which it actually collects for the telegrams from Turkey, destined for the island of Crete, which follow the route of Marmarice and Rhodes. Article 2 . Considering that the interior correspondence of the Island of Crete has acquired for some time a very important extension ; considering also that the transmission of this correspondence by the cables actually established in Crete affects detrimentally both the correspondence of the Island of Crete destined for the other offices of the Empire, and works to the detriment of the international correspondence transmitted by the same cables, and which correspondence suffers considerable delay ; with the object to obviate this inconvenience, and in the interest of these two last-mentioned correspon dences, the Imperial Government grants, in addition, to the Company, the right to establish an aerial line between Sitia-Candia, Candia-Rethymo, Rethymo-Canea (Island of Crete). This line once established shall be ceded to the Imperial Ottoman Govern-* ment, who shall work and maintain it, at its own expense and for its own account. In addition to the establishment of this line, the Company shall have the right to suppress its stations at Canea, Rethymo, and Sitia, to withdraw the staff and connect its cables direct, having only a central station at Candia for working the lines, Candia-Alexandria, Candia-Zante-Otranto, Candia-Syra, Candia-Rhodes (by the land line from Sitia). The Imperial Telegraph Administration will accord to the Company all the facilities in its power for the establishment of this aerial line. Nevertheless, after an interruption, and in the case of absolute necessity, the Turkish employes of the stations, Candia, Rethymo, and Canea, shall have the right to have recourse again to the use of the cables as formerly. (Received in London, July 3rd 1878.) Firman of the Salonica Concession. 2nd August 1884. The Sublime Porte, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Office of Translations. The Draft Convention, made between the Administration General of Posts and Telegraphs and Messrs Binney and George Serpos Effendi, agent, the X 4328 delegates and representatives of the Eastern Telegraph Company of London for the purpose of obtaining from my Imperial Government, on behalf of the said Company, the privilege of fifty years’ duration for the establishment and woikmg of submanne telegraph cables between the places and points here under named, has been referred to the Committee of Public Works and to the legislative section of the Council of State. After due examination the necessary reports on the premises have been approved and decreed by my Council of Ministers. Whereupon the matter has been submitted to my Imperial sanction, and I have caused my Imperial Irade to be issued ordering the execution of the provisions contained in the said Convention as follows that is to say :— The cables in question shall be laid— 1 st. Between Constantinople and the Island of Tenedos. 2nd. Between the Island of Tenedos and Salonica. . Nevertheless, the Company are empowered to land the first section of said cables, Constantinople-1 enedos, at one or more points of the Straits of the Dardanelles ; and, further, the said Company must land the Tenedos- Salonica cable at the Island of Lemnos at their own expense. The employe having charge of the correspondence at the station to be opened in the last mentioned island will be appointed by my Imperial Government, and the only charge affecting the Company in respect of non official messages received or forwarded by that Office will be a tax of forty paras per word. All official telegrams belonging to my Imperial Government and trans mitted to Europe over the cables of the Constantinople-Tenedos-Salonica line shall only pay one-half the tariff rate charged over the said cables. The Company further undertake to transmit gratuitously official telegrams from the interior to the extent of 30,000 words per month. The account of official telegrams from the interior to be sent over the said submarine cables will be settled every three months, and if at the end of the year the total number of words of such telegrams shall exceed 30,000 per month or 360,000 per annum, the Company will receive one-half the fixed rate for such excess. All telegrams, either from the Administration of Telegraphs or from the Company, on matters connected with the telegraph service shall be transmitted free of charge. The said cables shall be made on the same system as those already laid by the Company between the Islands of the Ottoman Archipelago and the same will be classified as follows, i.e. :— 1 st. Shore cable. 2nd. Medium depth sea cable. 3rd. Deep sea cable. The cable shall have a minimum insulating resistance of 1,000 megohms per marine mile, a maximum conductibility of 12 ohms, and an electrostatic capacity of 0*3 microfarads per mile. These measurements will be taken and verified immediately after the cables are laid. My Imperial Government undertakes to extend at its own cost the aerial line existing between the Dardanelles and Koum-Kali as far as the Company’s station at Bechika. The tariff rate for telegraph messages over the cable to be laid between my Capital and the Capital of Salonica via the island of Tenedos, is fixed at six francs, which will be divided in equal shares between my Imperial Government and the Company. With respect to the tariff rates for telegrams coming from the interior or from Europe, the amount thereof, as well as the mode of division, will be eventually settled by common agreement between the two contracting parties. The Company undertake to lay the said cables and open them for correspondence, except in the case of force majeure, within a maximum term of three months reckoned from the date of the ratification of the said Convention.

My Imperial Government reserves to itself the right of granting to another company thn privilege of laying submarine cables for connecting together either two points on the littoral of the Empire, or any point in the waters of the Empire with another point of the coasts of a foreign State, so long as such points be not those mentioned in the said Convention, nor in that entered into on the 28th of October 1870. Nevertheless, before making such con cession, my Imperial Government will send written information to the330 *, Eastern Telegraph Company, stating the nature of the proposals of the other company, and the conditions upon which such company will consent to lay the new cables in question. Two months’ time will he granted for the Eastern Telegraph Company to accept or refuse the proposals made, and in the event of the said Company accepting such proposals, preference will be given to them upon equal conditions over the other company. The Company undertake to apply to the telegraphic correspondence transmitted by their cables the clauses of the Telegraph Treaty of Paris revised at St. Petersburg, as well as those of the Regulations thereunto annexed, and all other international telegraph treaties which may be made hereafter. The auditing and exchange of accounts will also be made in conformity with the provisions contained in the treaty above mentioned. The Company shall be subject to the enactments of all the laws and regulations which may be in force at present or at any future time in mv States. J In case that, owing to reasons beyond control independent of the will of the Company, it should be impossible to lay the cables between the landing point of the Dardanelles and Tenedos, the Administration-General of Tele graphs, with the object of establishing communication between my Capital and Salonica, undertakes to set apait and assign provisionally to the Company an aerial line between the Dardanelles station and the Company’s office at Bechika. Any differences which should arise between the Administration-General of Telegraphs and the Company anent the observance of the clauses and conditions contained in the said Convention, shall be definitely settled by my Council of State, who will be the official arbitrator. My Imperial Government accepts and approves of the submarine line already laid between Bechika and Tenedos, Tenedos and Chios, and the Island of Crete and Chios. And whereas in consequence of the premises the establishment of a submarine cable between the Dardanelles and the post of Karaaghadj previously decided upon in virtue of the convention entered into between the Administration-General of Telegraphs and the Eastern Telegraph Company under date ot the 8 th of February 1878, for the sum of 22,0001. sterling, has now become useless, and whereas the existing cable between Kartal and Kemer, which has been laid to serve as starting point for the said line, must now be given up to the Company, in conformity with the terms of the first article of the said Convention, the sum of 8,000£. sterling,, which has been paid to the said Company on account thereof, in conformity with the last-mentioned Convention will have to be returned by the Eastern Telegraph Company in the manner to be agreed upon between the Administration-General of Telegraphs and the said Company. In case the said Company shall act in any way contrary to the tenour of the above-mentioned Convention, the privilege granted shall be cancelled. At the expiration of the concession, the Company’s cable, in proper working order, as well as the offices which shall have been opened by the said Company, together with the material and apparatus thereunto belonging, shall be made over and assigned to my Imperial Government without any charge therefor. In witness of the premises, my Imperial Divan has issued this my firman ; thereby the above-mentioned privilege is granted to the said Company for the term of 50 years upon the conditions herein settled, and to be effectual upon condition that all the stipulations of the said Convention shall be strictly observed.

VI.— Convention for establishing the El Arich Line. Article 1. The concessionaire undertakes to obtain from the Imperial German Administration of Posts and Telegraphs that telegrams destined for Egypt, which the said Administration, in the absence of indication by the sender of the route to be followed freely dispose of, shall be forwarded via Kustendji- Constantinople-El Arich, on condition and so far as the transmission is effected by this route as rapidly and correctly as by the other routes, and at the lowest rates collected by any other route whatever. If the lowest rate collected by another route should be reduced, the Imperial Government will agree to a corresponding reduction in the rate collected via El Arich, provided that the interested telegraph Administrations contribute proportionately. To ensure the desired rapidity and correctness in transmission it is understood :— (a) That transit telegrams transmitted via El Arich shall not be delayed in their re-transmission at Constantinople, owing to the exercise of the right of control, and that their transmission from the instruments of the Kustendji-Constantinople line to those of the Constantinople-El Arich line, and vice versa, shall be made in the Pera Central Office, with all possible celerity. (b) That in case of bad working of the Constantinople-El Arich line, telegrams received from Kustendji shall be transmitted in the Pera Central Office, and by this office either over other land lines of the Imperial Government, or over the cables of the Eastern Telegraph Company without being delayed. Article 2. The Imperial Government will take the necessary steps so that the service by the El Arich line shall meet all requirements of main line communication, viz. :— ( 1 ) A bronze wire of 3 m/m diameter shall be erected between Con stantinople and El Arich. Traffic received via the Constantinople-Kustendji cable and destined for Egypt and beyond, and vice versa, shall be exclusively transmitted by this wire (except in case of bad working provided for in Article 1, b), and shall have priority over other traffic. (2) In the Pera Central Office the terminal point of the Kustendji- Constantinople line shall be brought so close to the terminal point of the337 new conductor oi the Constantinople—El Arich line that telegrams passing from one line to the other can be exchanged immediately, and from hand to hand. (3) By arrangement between the Imperial Government and the Adminis tration of the Constantinople-Kustendji cable, instruments shall be chosen for working the new wire, which will enable traffic to be exchanged, if necessary, direct between Bucharest and the other offices situated beyond Constantinople. (4) The Imperial Government shall take the necessary steps with the Khedivial Government with a view to securing that the new conductor of the El Arich line shall be continued on the Egyptian side by a direct wire suitable for main line communication, and also set apart preferentially for international traffic. The concessionaire shall advance to the Administration of Posts and Telegraphs the cost of manufacturing the new conductor, and its erection along the course of the line, including insulators, &amp;c., up to fr. 400,000 (16,000?.) on the following conditions :— ( 1 ) The technical qualities of the wire, insulators, &amp;c. shall be those shown by the general specification of the Imperial Administration of Posts and Telegraphs. (2) The wire, insulators, &amp;c., shall be delivered by a first class firm to be mentioned by the concessionaire. If an arrangement should not be come to between the Imperial Administration of Posts and Telegraphs and this firm as to the price of the materials to be delivered, the price shall be fixed according to the average of the prices paid by the said Administration for materials of the same quality delivered to it during the years 1900, 1901, (4) The disbursement of the advance shall be made when the Imperial Ottoman Administration of Posts and Telegraphs has arrived at the amount of the cost as the work progresses. The price of the material may be paid by the concessionaire direct at the factory, on account of the advance, as soon as delivery shall have been accepted by the Imperial Ottoman Administration. (5) The delivery of the wire, insulators, &amp;c., shall be effected, at the latest, three months after the establishment of the Constantinople-Kustendji cable, under a penalty of a suitable stipulated fine. ( 6 ) The advance shall bear interest at the rate of 4 per cent, per annum, and shall be reimbursed within a period of 25 years by an annuity covering the sinking fund and interest. The annuity shall be payable half-yearly at a date to be fixed by arrangement. Payments in arrear shall bear interest at 4 per cent. The Imperial Ottoman Government reserve the right to increase the rate of the sinking fund, and 'to make reimbursements in advance. (7) The Imperial Ottoman Administration of Posts and Telegraphs shall maintain the Constantinople-El Arich line and the new conductor erected on it in good working order, and will repair it in case of interruption as quickly as possible. ( 8 ) The interest and sinking fund for the advance shall be the first charge on the gross revenue of the new conductor, which, for this purpose and to this extent, shall be specially and in the first place set apart for the service of the half-yearly payments. If they are not sufficient- the concessionaire shall have the right to bring into the cable account the sums due to him under the head of interest and sinking fund for the advance. State telegrams of the Imperial Ottoman Government shall receive a reduction of 50 per cent, in the rate over the Kustendji cable.

( 1 ) The Turkish terminal rate for traffic exchanged between Turkey in Europe, on the one hand, and Roumania and Austria-Hungary, on the other, via the Kustendji cable, shall be ecpial to that collected upon this traffic by the respective normal land routes. (2) The Turkish transit tax for traffic exchanged :— (a) Between Germany and Egypt, via El Arich, shall be 95 centimes per word. (b) If, in the event of interruption of the Constantinople-El Arich line, telegrams destined for Egypt should be transmitted via the Eastern Telegraph Company’s cable ; the Imperial Govern ment will cause this route not to be more costly to the public than the El Arich route. (3) The Imperial Ottoman Administration of Posts and Telegraphs will grant to the concessionaire for traffic exchanged :— (а) Between Turkey in Europe and Roumania, a rebate of centimes per word. ( б ) Between Turkey and Germany, a rebate of 10 centimes per word. (c) Between Turkey on the one hand, and Belgium, Denmark, Luxemburg, Norway, Holland and Sweden, on the other, a rebate of 10 centimes per word ; these rebates (a, b, &amp; c) being taken from the Turkish terminal tax. Article G. The Kustendji cable route shall be considered by the Imperial Ottoman Administration of Posts and Telegraphs, except its own lines, as the principal route for traffic with Roumania and Germany. On the other hand, the Imperial Administration will send telegrams for Egypt, of which it may have the disposal, by the new conductor of the Constantinople-El Arich line. Article 7. This convention shall come into force the date on which the concession for the Kustendji cable shall be definitely acquired by the concessionaire, with the exception of Article 5 (3) (c), which shall only come into force three months after the delivery of the new wire at Constantinople. VII.— Draft Convention between Turkish Government and Concessionaire for Kustendji-Constantinople Cable, under which latter guarantees to pay to Eastern Telegraph Company any damages to which Turkish Government may be liable in consequence of alleged breach of Company’s concession.* Between His Excellency of the one part, and Mr. ' of the other part. It has been declared and agreed as follows :— Article 1. The concessionaire having proposed to the Imperial Government to establish a submarine telegraph cable between Constantinople and Kustendji, subject to the attached conditions, the Imperial Government will make known this proposal immediately, and in writing, in accordance with Article XIII. of the Convention of the II Redjeb 1301 (25 April 1300-1884),f to the Eastern Telegraph Company, granting them a period of two months in which to decide upon the acceptance or refusal of this proposal. * It is understood that the Convention actually concluded is in practically identical terms with the draft. | The Convention of April 1884 is included in the Firman of the Salonica Concession dated 2nd August 1884 (pp. 324-327 of this print). The articles in that document are, however, not numbered.339 Tfie Imperial Government shall inform the concessionaire the clay upon which his proposal has been communicated to the Eastern Telegraph Company. Article 2. As soon as the Eastern Telegraph Company shall have refused the proposal, or allowed the conventional period to pass without deciding upon its acceptance or refusal, or shall after acceptance have failed, within the period fixed by Article XVIJL, to comply with the conditions of the proposal, the right to establish the cable, subject to the annexed conditions, shall thereby be acquired by the concessionaire. Nevertheless, the details fixed by the said Article NVIII. shall only be operative against the concessionaire from the date on which the Imperial Government shall have notified to him the definite acquisition of the concession. Article 3. If the Eastern Telegraph Company, whilst not exercising its preferential right, should, on the ground of Article XIII. of the Convention of the 11 Redjeb (25 April 1300-1884), institute legal proceedings against the Imperial Government, on account of the laying of the cable, the concessionaire shall take upon himself to reject this claim, and, if necessary, to pay the damages to which the Imperial Government may be condemned. The concessionaire shall, in due course, be advised by the Imperial Government of the Eastern Telegraph Company’s claim, and shall have the benefit, in the legal proceedings instituted by the said Company, of all the prerogatives which the law of Ottoman procedure grants to an opposing third party.

Subsequently, in 1886, when for certain reasons the French company desired to break away from the joint-purse arrangements, as modified by the agreement of the 12th May 1882 (No. II.), in order to ally themselves with the newly-formed Commercial Cable Company, they made an arrangement with the then Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, under which lie declared that the joint-purse agreements violated the condition of the concession granted by the French Govern ment in 1879, prohibiting the concessionaire from a fusion of interests with any other company without the consent of the Government. Instead of the company endeavouring to obtain the necessary consent of the Government, they intimated to the Anglo-American Company on the 31st December 1886, that the joint-purse arrangements were at an end from that date, and their action was afterwards concurred in by the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. The Anu-lo-Americau Company forthwith brought an action in the French courts against the French company for breach of contract, and claimed the repayment of the amount by which the French company had benefited while the agreements were in operation. The French company defended their action as one of force majeure. After certain more or less opposing decisions had been arrived at by succeeding courts, the court of Rouen decided in May 1899, in favour of the Anglo-American Company, and ordered the French Company to repay a sum of nearly 6,500,000 francs less the pecuniary value of any advantages derived by the Anglo company 5 in the period during which the agreements were observed. It is understood that no payment has yet been made to the Anglo Company.346 II.—JoiNT-P urse Agreement between Anglo-American Telegraph, Direct United States Cable, French Telegraph Cable (then Paris and New York Telegraph), and Western Union Telegraph (then American Cable) Com panies, dated 12th May 1882.' ::: ' Agreement made the 12 th day of May 1882, between the Anglo-American Telegraph Company, Limited, hereinafter called the Anglo Company ; the Direct United States Cable Company, Limited, hereinafter called the Direct Company; La Compagnie Francaise du Telegraphe de Paris a New A ork, hereinafter called the French Company (the said three cable companies being hereinafter collectively spoken of as the European Cable Companies), parties of the first part, and the American Telegraph and ( Able Company, hereinafter called the American Cable Company, party of the second part.

The Secretary of State may, when he considers such an emergency as aforesaid to have arisen, instead of taking possession of the offices, cable, and plant of the Company, or any of them, direct and authorise such persons as he may think fit to assume the control of the transmission of messages by the Company’s cable, either wholly or partly, and in such manner as he may direct; and such persons may enter upon the Company’s premises accordingly, or the Secretary of State may direct the Company to submit to him or any person authorised by him all telegrams tendered for transmission or arriving by the Company’s cable, or any class or classes of such telegrams, and - to stop or delay the transmission of any telegrams or deliver the same to him or his agent, and generally to obey all such directions with reference to the transmission of telegrams as the Secretary of State may prescribe and the Company shall obey and conform to all such directions. • In any such case as aforesaid, if the Company show that during the exercise of any of the powers aforesaid their receipts from the cable, with respect to which the said powers have been exercised, have been less than their receipts from the same source during a corresponding period on the average of the last three years, the United States Government shall pay to the Company as compensation for any loss of profit sustained by the Company by reason of the exercise by the Secretary of State of any of the powers hereby reserved, such sum as may be settled between the Secretary of State and the Company by agreement, or, in case of difference, may be determined by arbitration, provided always that no such compensation as aforesaid shall be paid if and so far as the powers hereby reserved to the Secretary of State are exercised for the purpose of preventing direct communication with any of the United States Government’s enemies, and save with the consent of the Secretary of State no such compensation shall be paid if and so far as the powers aforesaid are exercised for the purpose of preventing indirect or supposed communication with any of the United States Govern ment’s enemies, or of protecting the interests of the United States Govern ment under the apprehension of impending war. In estimating such compensation as in the last sub-clause provided, the arbitrator shall take into account all the circumstances of the case, in cluding not only any such loss as aforesaid, but also any additional profit accruing to the Company (whether from the use of the cable so taken possession of or controlled, or from any other cables used by them) from the emergency which gave rise to the exercise of the powers aforesaid. And as regards the cable with respect to which the said powers have been exercised, the receipts of the Company during a period corresponding to that of the exercise of the said powers on the average of the last three years, shall be deemed to be the receipts which the Company would have taken during the period of the exercise of the said powers had the powers not been exercised. And said Company hereby covenants and agrees that it will vacate the said office at any time upon notice from the Treasury Department, and that in the meantime, and until said notice, said Commercial Pacific Cable Company will keep the same in good order and repair, without expense or cost to the Secretary of the Treasury. And said Company hereby covenants to and with the United States of America that the United States of America may enforce the above obligations, and each and all of them, by summary action of the Army or Navy, or by a bill of injunction to be filed in any court of competent jurisdiction, or by a suit for damages, or by any of said remedies, as the United States of America may deem best.

The main correspondents are ministers and senior officials at the Foreign Office and the India Office in London, the Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Telegraph Department headquarters in London, the Viceroy and Governor-General of India at Calcutta, the British Minister to Persia at Tehran (also spelt Teheran) and the British Ambassador to Russia at Petrograd [Saint Petersburg]. The correspondents discuss the harm that would be caused to the British monopoly on telegraphic installations and communications between India, Southern Persia (referred to as the British zone) and the Persian Gulf, in the event that the Marconi Company was successful in obtaining a concession (licence) from the Persian Government, with the concurrence of the Russian Government.
