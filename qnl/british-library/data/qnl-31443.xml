Reference your letter No* P.2.5251/38, dated uie 8th August 1936, forwarding a copy of a letter, dated the 25th July 1936 from Petroleum Concessions Limited in regard to Kalea. 2 . The information from Bahrain quoted in Petroleum Concessions Limited’s letter is substantially correct. ire re is little doubt that Shaikh Khalid does dream of the day v/hen the whole of the QaWasimi territories will be re-united under one Shaikh, that Shaikh being himself. The inhabitants of the Wadi al Halu and the Wadi al Qaur have taken oath of allegiance to him and he has promised to protect them and to assist them in any way possible, but has informed them tnat for the present they must remain under their respective Shaikhs (i.e. Sharjah and Ras al Khaimah), until the end oi the diving season. Similarly Fujairah has t aaen oath oi al-egimoe to him, though Shaikh Khalid has told Shaikh Saif bin Hamadthat ho should continuo to exercise his authority 5: uutil 'better arrangements can he made*'• In regard to Diha (Hasn) the present Shaikh is completely incapable, and the local expectation is that Shaikh Khalid will appoint a Uali to act under his own direct orders. 3. Hitherto Shaikh Khalid has acted with considerable circumspection and, whether from conviction or from shortage of funds, he has made no effort to extend his influence by forceful methods. At present he is universally popular and there is every possibility of his influence extending much more widely during the coming cold weather, 4. With regard to the specific questions raised by petroleum Concessions Limited, I have the following comments to make^ (l) I see no objection to their approaching the Regent at Kalb a in the same manner as the other Trucial Coast Rulers, but pending further developments they should deal with him solely as the guardian of the minor Shaikh of Kalba, (2) No general sanction should be given in the terms stated by the Company, presumably their immediate object is to obtain access to Jebel Paiyah through the good offices of Shaikh Khalid, and conceivably this will be the ultimate solution. Nevertheless this particular question, (and all similar questions) must be considered fully on its merits, I shall be addressing you separately regarding Jobel Paiyah, (3) It is essential to draw a clear distinction between Shaikh Khalid as Regent of Kalba and Shaikh Khalid as the potential Ruler of a combined Qawasami Sheikhdom, At the moment Petroleum Concessions Limited can only deal with him in his former capacity and a Kalba concession would therefore cover/\ lo 3. cover only recognised Karo a territory and not the whole of t he S huraa 1 i y ah. 5. Petroleum Concessions Limited would do well to confirm their friendly relations with Shaikh Khalid. (3d) H. leightman, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. At tested. (Sd) J.

Dear Mr. Peel, inhen this Company first went concession hunting on the Trucial Coast, it was decided provisionally not to approach the Shaikh of Kalba — who was at that time on the point of being recognised by H.M.G. as a separate unit — on the grounds that his territory was so situated as to have no oil interest. It does not seem certain, however, that this was a wise decision since Shaikh Khalid, the Regent of Kalba, seems to be a man of some personality who, besides controlling a considerable area of mountain territory seems to possess influence on the Western side of the mountains also. In this connection the following passage occurs in a report dated May 10th 1938 from Bahrain:- 'The R.A. informs me that Khalid, the regent of Kalba, has managed to get Fujairah and Dibah under his control. That is to say, they have sworn allegiance to him. This means that practically the whole of the Shamailyah is now dependent on Kelba. At the same tint .vadi A1 Qor and wadi Helu, sometimes known as Wadi Ham, have both recently pair tax to Khalid, instead of to Shaikh Sultan bin Salem as heretofore. wadi Helu runs southwards from Khatt and joins Wadi A1 Qor in the vicinity west of the town of Kelba. Khalid has owned Dhaid for some time. It is believed that TH,! I „L J U 1. I ... L , „ Khalid* s intentions are to re—unite the Qawasim territories in one she Mid ora under his own control, lx Khali( is allowed to continue he might eventually2 / 3 succeed as he is universally liked. I called on Khalid several times during lest Ramadan at Ajman, and afterwards cured him of malaria with Atebrin. He seemed a nice type of man and has sent me many messages since then. At the moment it looks as if Has A1 Khaimah territory is now practically halved. Khalid is also friendly with the Bani Ghittab. At the moment H.M.G. are taking no action as regards Khalid’s activities, although they are fully aware of the progress he is making. Tf I write now to ask: 1. whether you feel any objection to our approaching the Regent of Kalba in the same manner ( as other Trucial rulers if the local situation seems to call for this: Whether you have any objection to our approaching 2 through him, tribes or places which one of the other Qasawim rulers has claimed or may claim, if he offers us more effective assistance than they: Whether, in your opinion, a concession from the 3 Regent of Kalba can be taken as covering the whole of the Shumaliyah which of course includes Fujairah, Dibah and other villages. As you will perhaps wish to consult yo r representatives in the Gulf, I am sending a copy of this letter to our Bahrain Office. Yours sincerely (3d) Stephen H.

Present: Mr. J.C. Walton Sir T. Fowle Mr. A. C.B. Symon Mr. Longrigg ) j Representing P.C.L. Mr. Williamson ) 1. Mr. Weightman’s letter l.o.C.600 of the 3rd oepte her, was used as the basis of the discussion. A copy of the letter was shown to Mr. Long^igg and he was allowed to take notes therefrom. He was informed that we concurred generally with the views expressed by Mr. Weightman. 2. Mr. Longrigg confirmed that there would be two exploration parties, one leaving Muscat lor Baraimi about 3rd November and the other leaving dharjah for the same destination about 7th-10th November. It was anticipated that the Sharjah party (travelling in motor cars; would reach Baraimi a few days ahead of the Muscat party. The party will probably travel from Sharjah via Dhaid, and thence southerly in a more or less straight line to Baraimi, passing east of Jebel Faijah and west of Jebel Shamami. The exact route to be followed will depend to some extent on the physical difficulties to be overcome. 3. T t was agreed that Major Watts should accompany the Muscat party as far as Baraimi, and that Captain Galloway should accompany the Sharjah party and remain with it until the work was completed. It was recognised that this may be a matter of months. The Company’s representatives expressed their/ Li'i*their agreement in these arrangements and undertook to provide the necessary transport . Xt was impressed upon the Company’s representatives that the exploration parties must be guided by the advice of the political Officer concerned as to whether any particular area which they wished to visit could be regarded as safe. Sir Trenchard Fowle said that subject to this overriding consideration and to the general guidance of the olittcal Officers, —Hte- it seemed unnecessary to place any restrictions on the movements of the parties. Sir Trenchard Fowle will, on his return from leave, take such steps as are necessary to obtain the Government of India’s agreement to make Captain Calloway available, and will issue the necessary instructions to ''ajor 'atts. Sir Trenchard thought it would be preferable if Major Watts returned to Muscat by i understood the 18th October ' 1 ' in order to be present when Mr.Longrigg Major Watts’ ►e plans in- arrives. a visit to v on 16th •er to try an 4. Mr. Lon^rigg said that he would prefer not to ask •taut case. • Fowle any favours from the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi before the ;ht that this ^have to be Sheikh had been again approached in regard to the oned. concession aspect. In any case, the Company’s experts were of the opinion that on this occasion it might be unnecessary to visit any territory controlled by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and they were hopeful that a landing site could be found in an area slightly to the east of Jebel Hafit, which is outside Abu Dhabi’s control. The Company preferred to make local contact with the Abu Dhabi people, if such contact was found to be necessary. Sir Trenchard Fowle said that, so far as he was concerned,ne wsb prepared to agree to this 5. As regards the Jebel Faljah area, it was agreed that if the negotiations between the Beni Xitab and Bheikh ^nalid (acting on behalf of the Sheikh of Sharjah; failed, it should be left to Sheikh Khalid acting directly on behalf of the Company , to try and obtain access to tae Jebel Fsijah and adjacent territory. If this is done, it will be necessary to decide what steps should be taken with the Sheikh of Sharjah. Two courses appeared to be open, viz.- (a; To tell the Sheikh at once that the Company had Invoked Article 10 of the political agreement, and were making other arrangements (with the consent of the Political Resident) to visit the precluded areas, or (b) to say nothing to the Sheikh unless he himself objected at a later stage. Course (a y seemed preferable though Mr. Longrigg said that the Company would prefer the second course if possible, and dir Trenchard Fowle undertook to discuss the matter with Mr. v eightman on his return to the Gulf.

After Compliments, I beg to state that on 15th inst* (8.11.38 Wali Muzafar and the Geologists left with the intention of passing Wadi al Hawasinah. Two days before their departure a letter was addressed by the Hawasinah, people * of Ghaizah, to Wall Muzafar, in which he was asked to * yioufyl ^ postpone his journey via the Wadi, pending intimation to A them. The letter in^ question was handed to Hultan bin Half before it reached the Wali. The former kept it with him and did not inform the Wali of its purport. When the Wali W and his followers approached Ghaizan, bhuwain bin 'Amir went ahead on behalf of Hultan (bin Haif) and of his own accord to speak to the people of Gh&amp;izain. When he reached near the town it happened what had happened between Shuwain and the people of Ghalzain which led to firing a gun, wounding Shuwain in his leg and killing the she-camel of Mohamed bin Saif, Sultan's brother. vJhen the Wali came to know about this event, he returned from that route, went to Wadi Beni Umar and passed the night of 16th (9.11. 38) at Da$al. After sunset we heard the news and proceeded to find out the fact so that the Wali may not change his mind (about his journey). We found Sultan bin Saif ana Shuwain in ^asaf and the '•ali at/ ba^al. We asked the Wali to postpone his journey to enable us to find out what they had to say. When we went to them we found them obedient submissive to the Government. But their censure was against Sultan because they had certain pretexts against him as he did intimate to the4»t^ such matters etc. We rebuked mm them for their treatment towards the Govrnt. delegation/2 delegation* They replied that they had formerly informed the Wali abei* and complained to him against Sultan's Highness the ^Itan but were not given a chance to do so* That what they have done nowtf wa^not their desire to prevent the delegation of ^is Highness the ^ultan but that was due to Sultan bin Saifs fault who did not consider them as his partners in important matters and that they had no opposition to what was asked for from them i.e* the passing &lt;of the wadi) etc. We then left them with a a view to come to the Wali and his party and tell them to pass through the wadi. We at once went to uaqal to ask the Wali to return to that way, but that he had already left via Wadi Bani Umar. We liked to inform him of facts so that he should not change his mind in this case. I have returned today to hhaburah and propose to convene a meeting and go through the case of shwain's party and the people of Uhaizain. what was committed by the people of Shaizain was merely due to their hostility towards dultan bin daif.

We understand the nature of the Agreements as set out therein, and we are prepared to agree to them except Article 4 of the Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company. Y^liat we understand from the above Article is that the local employees,and these include subjects of our Government and persons under its control and administratiov shall have no right to approach the Sultanate Authorities with their complaints and grievances except through the Chief Local Representative of the Company,who shall be a British subject. This is an objectionable point to us.Our subjects and those under our Government’s control and administration should have the right of a direct approach to the Sultanate Authorities with their complaints and grievances so that their cases or interests may not be jeopardized by the circuitous way of representation.We suggest that the first sentence of paragraph.4 of the Agreement between His Majesty^s Government and the Company be deleted and the following sentence be xxiaxtix substituted:- tT The Company except ^unimportant or routine matters shall deal with the Sultanate Authorities through a Chief Local Representative in Muscat,who shall be a British subject The remainder of paragraph 4 is not objectionable to us and may stand.

' The Company are pushing ahead with a 16th August, a 17th August. their exploration plans on the assumption (which is confirmed in Watts’ telegram No. 106 of the 1st August) that the Sultan will be able to arrange for a party to visit the Baraimi area from the Muscat side and as you will see from Longrigg’s letter of the 17th August, the present idea is that a second party should proceed in cars from Sharjah to Baraimi to meet their colleagues at the latter place during the last week in November. Thereafter it is proposed that the combined party should move northward towards the coast seeing, in Longrigg’s own words, as much of the interesting territory as possible (this, of course, is meant to include such areas as Jebel Paiyah) under whatever friendly auspices (i.e. the/ ugh Weightman, Lsq. , I.C.S. , C/o Postmaster, Karachi.the Trucial S rate, all the petty de fact In other word good offices prepared to u without the c Company are e may well he t however, chvi party a free not the least and v/e should Company's pro thereon as so doubt let us f or a Politic e xploration p A poi Company are e2. the Trucial Sheikhs themselves to whom nominally, at any rate, all the territory in question belongs, or the local ^ petty de facto Rulers) may he available from day to day. In other v/ords, having once reached Baraimi through the ; good offices of the Sultan of Muscat, the party are prepared to undertake the journey to the coast with or without the co-operation of the Trucial Sheikhs and if the Company are ever to see the Trucial hinterland this may well be the best way of attempting the job. There are, however, obvious difficulties in the way of giving the party a free hand to wander at will in this uncivilised area, not the least of which is the question of their safety, and v/e should accordingly be grateful if you would examine the Company’s proposals and let us have your considered views thereon as soon as possible. In your reply 3 ^ou will no doubt let us know how far you consider it is desirable, tor a Political Officer to be associated with the e xploration party.

PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (OMAN AND DHOFAR) LIMITED. City-Gate House, Finsbury Square, PC.27/101. London, E.C.2. 17th August, 1938. My dear Symon, I write, at your suggesion, to confirm two points which emerged from our telephone conversation this morning. The first point is that we are handicapped by the absence of replies to the question which I asked Mr. Watts in my letter of July 8th (copy to you under my PC.27/91 of that date). I was, this morning, on the point of cabling Watts kindly to expedite his replies, but you pointed out that this would be improper. Can you do anything for us in the matter? I had hoped that Watts would be able to reply, either directly or through official channels, very shortly after his return to Muscat. The second point raised by you concerns the movements of our land survey party on its trip northwards from Baraimi. It is at present proposed that a party, distinct from the Muscat-Khaburah-Baraimi party, will proceed in cars from Sharjah to Baraimi to meet their colleagues at the latter place during the last week in November. The object of this is to have motor transport available for the exploration of the country between Baraimi and the coast, with a consequent great saving place of time. The meeting/of the two parties at Baraimi will no doubt be the residence of the Sultan’s representative there. It is, from the exploration point of view, a matter of evident indifference to us under whose auspices the/ •B. Symon, Esq., ndia Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.2 the parties travel between Baraimi and the coast, and we have visualised them as using whatever friendly contacts they might make en route. If you would like the party proceeding from Sharjah to Baraimi to be accompanied by a representative of the Shaikh of Sharjah, or even of Ajman, or by a representative of thePolitical, we should, of course, conform. Our one desire is to see as much of the interesting territory as possible under whatever friendly auspices may be available from day to day - a method which is usual and often inevitable in Arabian travel.

Muscat, and Imperial Airways, Sharjah, from day to day. The civil flying regulations of Muscat territory will be observed, except in so far as departures from the letter of the law may be sanctioned in advance. As regards our exploration programme for those territories in general, you have had copies of my letter No. PC.27/82 dated June 3rd to H.H. the Sultan (copy forwarded to Mr. Symon under our PC.27/83 of the same date), and of my PC. 27/90 of July 8th addressed to Mr. V/atts (copy of which was forwarded to Mr. Gibson under our PC. 27/91? also of July 8th). These letters give you as much detail of our plans as has been formulated up to the present. As regards dates, I expect to arrive in Muscat about October 18th for a stay of three or four weeks. The geologists will arrive a fortnight later and commence their land survey immediately. Air survey will be based on Sharjah and is planned to commence on December 1st, by which time we hope that the land party will have made the journey Muscat-Khaburah-Dhank- Hafit-Ba raimi-Faiyah-Shar jah.to) CONFIDENTIAL, No. 541-5.

This assumes that negotiations with Beni Kitab are succe ssful• 2. In itself this plan seems unobjectionable save for one complication. Buitan of luscat has apparently made contact with al Bu Bhamis of naraimi oasis and hafit. Consequently any exploration of their areas is more or less under Muscat auspices and he might object to a Political Officer accompanying the Charjah party from narairai onv/ards. 1 think however we can justify Bowes accompanying party as far as southern end of Bafit on excuse that he must be responsible for discussions with tribes ii.e.Dhuwahir) owing allegiance to Abu chabi.

Mr. Thompson, one of the geologists returned to Muscat via Sohar on December 4th. Mr. Hotchkiss the second geologist arrived on 5th having proceeded from Sohar to examine the landing ground at Shinas some thirty miles to the north. It is con sidered that should further developments require aerial surveys of this portion of the Sultanate to be carried out a landing ground near the sea would be more convenient then that near t£-*- Baraimi as it was original intention to make. 2. Mr. Thompson informed me unofficially and in con fidence that the results of his exploration of the country towards the west of the limits of the Sultanate in the districts of Yanqul, Hafit and Baraimi were distinctly disappointing but that the regions towards the coast were at ±k least worthy of further examination. In view of the hasty nature of the journey, it was, he said, diff icult„form any definite opinion as to the prospects of there being oil in those parts. 3 . Mr. Thompson informed me that on December 2nd at a (Signature) place | ll &gt; 11111 S. 44. MFP—1534 S&amp;P—(M-2835)—24-5-38— 10 , 000 .

Ho one v,as hit during the firing which lasted only a few minutes. 4. i discussed this ixicident with the Sultan at an interview I nud with him yesterday. He declared that the real facts were as ascertained from the Shaikh who was present and has come into Muscat, tnat the geologists were not fired on at ail. A few shots were fired into the air by a party of lawless Beduins as a signal to halt so that the (piestion of passing through their district could be discussed. I said that it appeared that no control was exercised over tnese people by the local Shaikh and tne huitun said at Hail village there was no Shaikh or Headman. I asked the Sultan whafc he proposed to do in the natter and he re*xied he proposed to do nothing. I said that it was very unsatisfactory for action of this nature not to be followed up at least by a demand for explanation if not punishment from the men guilty of holding up a party who were in the country with his permission and under his protection. The huitan replied that such incidents would have to be expected to happen occasionally in the wilder parts of his State and that ne oouid do nothing in the ratter. This state ment is probably perfectly true and only seems to prove how weax in actual fact, the control and authority of the Muscat Government is anywhere outside the to w ns of Muscat and -fi/iatrah. b I am making further investigations into the matter. .v -tejor, I.A., Consul, muscatCONFIDENTIAL. fljl- N T o. 5fa8-3.

On 9th December the motor dho* hired by the Company for conveying stores and personnel to ana from uxeir proposed aeroplane bases in the soutn of the Sultanate, arrived with stores from Sharjah. On 15th December Mr.Longrigg, General Manager, arrived in Muscat from Sharjah. He saw tiie geologists Messrs Thompson and Hotchxiss and after discussing various matters witu tnem left for Sharjah by air the same day, his length of stay in Muscat being some tii.ree hours. On 18th December the geological party left for Has al Hadd by motor- &lt;&amp;ow to meet the Company's aeroplane which, it is understood, arrived there the same day. On S3rd December the motor dhow returned to Muscat for stores and again the same day for Has al Hadd. On 25th December the geological party returned by motor dhow to ^acat, the aeroplane having proceeded to Sharjah, it seems, a day or Uo previously. It appears that for four da^s a series of survey fiignts was carriec {Signature) out {Designation)out into tile interior from trie base camp at Has al Kadci. It has not yet been ascertained why reconnaissances further to the south i.e. from iflasirah, Khor Gharim,Shuwai- miyah and Murbat as originally planned were not carried out. An unconfirmed report received states that tne Sheiich of kasirah refused to allow the Company’s aeroplane to use the landing ground on that island and tore up the Sultan* s letter of introduction which had been sent him. iersonally I do not believe this report to be true. According to the Company’s local agents however the real reason for the postponement of the flignts to the south ern portion of the Sultanate was that it was found that the motor dhow hired as a tender vessel was unsuitable for the purpose. It is believed that a Tanker will be hired for the work in place of the dhow. On December 26th the Company’s aeroplane arrived in Muscat from Sharjah. On December 27th the Company’s Arabic Interpreter Khan Sahib Hasan bin Saleh Jaafar came to the Agency and a sited the assistance of the Treasury Officer in obtaining permission from the Sultan’s Hepresen- tative for the aeroplane to fly over the Batinah which, he stated, had been refused. The Treasury Officer accordingly went and interviewed Saiyid Shahab on the matter, who in formed him that he had refused permission not for a flight over 1he Batinah, as stated, but over the Oman. This per mission he declared he could not give, firstly because the Sultan had given him no instructions on the subject and secondly because it would be a dangerous undertaking the responsibility for the possible consequences of which he, Saiyid Shahab, was not prepared to assume. Meanwhile it seems without waiting to hear the decision of the Sultan’s Representative the aeroplane, in which Mr. Thompson, senior geologist and a photographer named Mr. Eden were tne passengers, too* off from the landing ground and carried out a flight of some two hours duration3- \ ' ; - into tiie interior. This no doubt too* them well over the Oman.

Ihis report has been compiled from information obtained with some difficulty by the Treasury Officer(during my absence from Muscat from 9th December to 1 st January) , partly from the members of the geological ^arty and partly irom other sources.

Mr. Thompson, senior geologist, of the Muscat section of Petroleum Concessions exploratory parties, returned to Muscat by the Do An Slow liail steamer on 6 th Inawrirag January and came to see me the same day. He informed me unofficially and confidentially that as a result of his observations during the series of flights carried out by the Company* s aeroplane from Ras-al-Hadd, both along the coast and into tbe interior, he was personally convinced that the possibi lity of finding oil in the districts seen could be entirely ruled out, The same position would apply, he added, to the whole of the terri tory extending from the coast line to the western limits of the Sultanate between the limits of Ras-al-Hadd and the commencement of the province of Dhofar, all of which was of a similar geological nature. Mr. Thompson gave me to understand that he had reported his opinion to the Head Office of his Company who were certain to agree w ith his views and that it could be assumed that no further aerial surveys would be carried out over the area in question. 3* Should Mr. Thompson* s assumption be corsect and the Company in fact {Signature) it If-in2 in fact abandon all idea of aerial surveys of the area above mentioned a source of trouble and apprehension will be remov ed vide correspondence ending with your telegram to India Office No.37d of 2dth November 1938* 4. Mr.Thompson confirmed the report of the unsuitabi lity of the motor dhow used as a tender on tne visit to Kas ai- Hadd ( vide paragraph 3 of my express letter quoted above) and stated that the Company were endeavouring to arrange for a Tanicer for the purpose. 5. The plan now proposed, according to Mr.Thompson was for a thorough aerial survey to be carried out of Dhofar rrovince using Murbat as a base. The scheme apparently is to convey stores, supplies and personnel to Murbat from Muscat in a West Bound Tanicer which will not remain at that port but proceed to whatever its destination may be. On the comple tion of the survey evacuation of the temporary base to Muscat will be carried out by a Tanicer bound for Abadan. The Com- panffos aeroplane will of course fly to Murbat. Actual details of the exploratory work to be carried out are to be discussed by the geologists with the Sultan on the latter’s return to Muscat on 13th of this month • 6 . I can see no objection to that item in the pro posed scheme of exploration of Dhofar whereby no steamer or ship will be used to remain the whole time at Murbat. The Company's party will be in wireless communication with the Royal Air Force Station at Muscat, Dhofar province is peace ful and the inhabitants law-abiding and docile and in the event of a forced landing of the aeroplane in the interior the Sultan has more than once stated to me that he could in that district arrange for a rescue party to be despatched from3 from Kurtoat or Salalah. 7. Mr. Thompson confirmed that on December 27th he had carried out a flight over the Oman, &amp;o a distance, according to him, of nearly 200 miles inland. I pointed out to Mr. Thompson that as he had, quite correctly, sent his Interpreter beforehand to the Sultans representative to ask permission for this flight he should undoubtedly have waited for a reply before actually making it. Such acts, I added, were not con ducive to promote cordial relations between the Company and the Sultans Government. Mr. Thompson’s reply to nqy remarKB were was somewhat evasive. S. On 8 th January, the Company , s aeroplane in which Mr. Hotchiciss geologists and Mr. Eden photographer were passengers arrived in Muscat from Sharjah and returned the following day. The object of their visit it is understood was to obtain a fresh supply of photographic material u'rom the stock kept at Muscat for use in the Trucial Coast district. 9. I understand that Mr. Baker, the Head Geologist in the Xondon Office, of Petroleum Concessions Ximited, is shortly due out in the Gulf on a tour of inspection of the work done by the Company* s geologists. He is due to leave England on 31st January and arrive Sharjah via Bahrain about 8 th February. Major,I.A., Political Agent &lt;fc H.M* s Consul, n Muscat. ' o -Confidential.

Just before the Sultan left for Dhofar he informed me that he had been much upset at some information he had r received from his Representative M Wali Mudhdhafar' with the Muscat geological party during their recent visit to the Baraimi districts, concerning the alleged behaviour of Howes. 2. According to the Sultan when the Oil Company^ bharjan party after first reaching Baraimi, had proceeded on to Hafit to make contact with the Muscat party there, Howes had stated to Wali Mudhdhafar in the presence of several of the leading men ol the district that he had come down to those parts with the permission of and bringing letters of introduction from the Trucial Shaikhs; consequently Howes is said to have declared, he, Wali Mudhdhafar and all the inhabitants of those parts should co-operate with and give every assistance to his party. 3. Howes’ remarks,the Sultan declared, were equivalent to an assumption that the Baraimi and Hafit districts were not in Muscat territory but under the control of the Trucial Shai-ishs • I said I very much doubted whether the real facts were as has been reported but the Sultan who was considerably exci te d Hon’ble Lieut.Colonel Sir Trenchard tfowle, &amp;• C.I•£•, 6 .B.£., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.t(L - 2 - excited declared he had reliable evidence on the subject to corroborate what he affirms, Howes is su^osed to have sa id.

I thought it advisable to inform you of the Sultan’s attitude, however as I feel certain he will raise it when you visit Muscat next month and you will have time^ if you see fit^to get Howes* version of the incident which I have no doubt is very different from what the Sultan stated it to be.i^o-i-itical Agency dc H.B.M’s Consulate, Muscat, the 17th January 1939.

When I saw the Sultan on 14th January, the day after complaint his return to Muscat, the first subject he mentioned was' his/ against Howes concerning whom,he had, he said, received further reports of action considerably more objectionable and irregular than what he had first mentioned to me just prior to his departure for Dhofar. 3 . According to the Sultan Howes while at Baraimi had stated to ignore his Representative, Wali Mudnaiiar and had summoned several of the Muscat Sheiichs direct for the purpose of issuing directions to them. He had also given a present of Rs 800/- to Saqir bin Sultan, Sheikh of Baraimi witnout reference to or obtaining the approval oi Wall Mudhafiar. Such action the Sultan declared seriously undermined his authority in those districts which were not at any time easy to control and he very strongly objected to it. He said he would write an official letter to me on the subject in a few days as he wished to take it up with you when you visited Muscat 4 .

V Subject:- Muscat Oil. Reference correspondence ending with my Express Letter No. C/6 dated 10th January 1939. 2. Mr. Thompson had an interview with the Sultan on January 16th at which I was present and the chief points discussed are given in the following paragraphs. 3. Mr. Thompson confirmed what he had previously stated to me, vide paragraph 2 of my Express Letter quoted above, that for the remainder of the present stage of the Company’s activities during this cold weather at least, no further aerial surveys would be carried out from the coast into the inferior between the limits of Raee-al-Hadd and the eastern limits of Dhofar. 4 Mr. Thompson then said that he wished to carry out both an aerial and land survey of Dhofar and asked if the Sultan could wake the necessary arrangements. Hig Highness replied that as regards the land survey he would instruct the Willi of Dhofar at Sftlalah to give all assistance required to the geological party. He aeked where the land paryt would desire to go. Mr. Thompson replied that one or two journeys to a distance inland of approxi mately 15 miles due north of Salalah should be sufficient for (Signature) S, 44. MFP-1534 S&amp;P-(M-2835)— 24-5-38— 10,000. (Designation)their needs. Mr. Thompson said that he would lifce to make an aerial survey on a flight inland of acme 150 miles from tho coast. The Sultan pointed, out that this would take the aeroplane well out over the sands of the Great Desert which wag for practical purposes uninhabited and waterless. In the event of a forced landing in that region, therefore, Hie Highness continued, the chances of the oecupante of the machine ever emerging alive were exceedingly remote. Rescue parties would and could be sent out in the event of the aeroplane not returning to its base by a stipulated time but with nothing to guide them it would be n case of finding a needle in a haystack and, should it be found, it would probably by that time be too late. A forced landing the Sultan concluded would in all probaoility mean absolute disaster. He was not preparod^he said, to E&lt;*nd a Representative in the aeroplane as he would be of no use to the part}' if they were forced down. Mr. Thompson said he fully understood the situation and the risks attendant on such a flight and was propitred as Head of the 1'uscat section of Petroleum Concossions Ltd^ exploration party to ae apt the consequences. Th«aachine used by the Company was a 4 engined one and he had absolute confidence in its reliability. 5. Mr. Thompson stated that hit Company had now arranged for a Tanker belonging to the British Tanker Company to transport stores and supplies from Muscat to Dhofar on a westward passage from the Gulf and similarly for the return to Muscat for their base camp to be conveyed by a Gulf bound Tanker when the work in that province hod been completed.How that the Sultan had informed him that his party could proceed for the survey of Dhofar Mr. Thonpeon stated tha^fhe would telegraph for a Tanker to eall tn at Muscat ae early as possible. 6 . The Sultan pointed out to Hr. Thompson that hie action in carrying out a flight over the Oman (vide paragraph 3 of My Express Letter quoted above) was not m order since he had clearly explained in ny presence to Mr. Longrigg in October last year that that part of his torritoriea w&amp;e for various reasons unsuitable for aerial surveys* Mr* Thompson replied that he had been informed by Hr. Longrigg personally on hie arrival in Muscat on November 1 st last year that all arrangements had been made by him with the Sultan for jj the Company’s aeroplane to fly anywhere it might be de- ♦ desired over the Sultanate* His Highness in reply stated that so far from being the case he had agreed only for the aeroplanes to fly from *Sharjah down along the coast to Rass-al-Hadd and thence carry out aerial surveys into the interior and along the coast as flar ae thejiimite of Dhofar. The Sultan appealed to me to corroborate him which T did, hie statements being of course perfectly correct. Mr. Longrigg had expressly stated that his Sompany’s aeroplane would not land at Muscat whereas it had done so on December 15th and several other occasions without previous intimation and permission L being obtained from his Representative while the Sultan was away at Dhofar. Failure to keep him i*nd hie Government fully informed of the Company’s change of plans caused considerable inconvenience, the Sultan went on tb say, and was against the promise given by Hr Longrigg and he desired that the Company’s Representatives should be careful to observe the arrangements made in this connection in the future.4 Ur. Thompson expraeeed regret if he had in any way annoyed the 3ultan through his failure to observe undertakings given by hie Company and promised to keep the Huscat Government fully informed in wirting in the future concerning all hie plane. 7. Mr. Thompson stated that a part of the special aamera used for taking photographs in the aerial survey required replacing. He therefore proposed to fly to Sharjah on 17th January to obtain the spare part from the Company *8 store and return to Muscat in the course of a few days. Meanwhile he would ^to Abadan for the first available Tanker to be sent to Muscat to convey stores etc. to Dhofar to commence the survey work there. He hoped fca a Ta nker would be made available* within the next 10-14 days* 8 . So far as the Company’s present plans for ground work to be carried out in Dhofar are f '• concerned I do not anticipate trouble of any sort. The province is under effective control and the inhabitants friendly and social. The proposed flight over a portion of the Great -^ands ie another matter. However the Company’* aeroplane, ie as Mr. Thompson mentioned, a reliable 4 engined one and the chances of a forced landing extremely remote. The prooable consequences of such an occurrence have been forcibly put to Mr* Thompson )y the 3ultan and as the foruur/ie prepared to take the risk presumably with the knowledge and approval of his Company it seems that no further action on our part is called 1 Major, I.A. i Political Agent &amp; H.H.M’s Consul, »03 TIMIJ (mm OHA mm TH 3 M%U 3 V 3 Q SiU 3 J 0 f 32UOH 3TA0-YT;t) •i'i' - i i. 1 -' 77 \ i : 7T lo X *X'pT * ‘ 1 •; ao 1 '■ rt *~n • m* PETROL To Hiv High Sayid 3 a’id Sultan of « recent ooi work in U that area anticipate essential a oross-seo likely that be found ne shall be ab quite possi a point ten after we ar altitudes by north- orally, i oonsidere would be a flight we should T) requested t) least twentj let Jfour Hij Ti homage of 115PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (OMAN AND DHOFAR) l IMiTFn / ^3 Muscat, 19th January, 1939 To HIT flighnass Sayid Sa^d bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman. In compliance with the request made by Tour Hi^mess during our recent conversation, I am submitting the following plan of our proposed work in Dhofar, It is, of course, to be understood that without having seen that area one oan not lay down a plan complete in every detail. However, I anticipate no reason why we shall depart from the program outlined in any essential way. * ^ The work will consist of two parts. First, there will be made a cross-section on the ground along a line due north from Salalah. It is not likely that this work will extend more than twenty miles inland. If it should be found necessary to proceed somewhat farther than this, I presume that we shall be able to obtain permission from the local authorities. It is also quite possible that we may wish to make more than one oross-seetion, say at a point ten miles or twenty miles eavt of Salalah. This can be decided only after we arrive in the field. The seoond division of the work will be from the air. Flying at altitudes of ten thousand feet, I should like to cover the entire Dhofar area by north-south lines of flight at ten mile intervals. As already mentioned orally, these flights are not intended to extend into any area which may be considered by Your Highness as undesirable to visit at the present time. It would be most advantageous to our work if one exception could be made — namely a flight one hundred and fifty miles north of Salalah. As I have pointed out, we should be willing to accept full responsibility for Ihis flight. The actual date of departure from Muscat is still uncertain. I have requested that the tanker which is to take our porty to Salalah notify me at l«ast twenty-four hours bsfore its arrival in Muscat. In which case, I can let JJour Highness know in ample time for the neoessary arrangements. Trusting that Tour Highness will approve of this plan, I offer the homage of sy respects. Lester S.

From my Political Muscat. my Subject Muscat Oil ^4 IS I forward, herewith, an account of the activities of Petroleum Concessions Limited in Muscat territory subsequent to / the date of my last Rxprees Letter on the subject - No. 6/12 dated the 17th January. 2. On January 27th the **British ^lJ^peror ,, , a tanker of the British Tanker Company, arrived in Muscat and embarked Mr. Hotchkiss, geologist, and K.S. Hassan, Interpreter, with stores and camp equipment, and left the same day for Dhofar. On 29th January the Company’s aeroplane with Messrs. Thompson and Rden as passengers, arrived in Muscat from Sharjah and left the next day for Dhofar. On February 6 th the aeroplane returned to Muscat from Dhofar with Messrs. Thompson and Bden on board and left for Sharjah on 7th. On 9th the Tanker ”British F-raperor* arrived at Muscat with Mr. Hotchkiss and K.S. Hasean and left the same day after landing her passengers. 3. Mr. Thompson informed me unofficially that the reason for the unexpected quick return of their expedition was due to the (Signature) / fact that S. 44. MFP—l 634 S&amp; P—(M-2835 )_24.5-38— 10,000. (Designation)fact that after flights lasting only two days had been carried / out over Dhofar from their base at Hurbat he had seen sufficient to convince him that the possibilities of finding oil in that region were so remote as to make it unnecessary in his opinion to continue the aerial reconnaissance or even start upon any ground reconnaissancee He had decided therefore to bring back the expedition to Kuscat# He adde&lt; that he was proceeding to Sharjah to meet Mr* Baker and would probably return with him to show him personally some parts of Muscat tsrritory from the air as the decision regarding the Company's future plans in the State was largely in Mr* Baker's hands in virtue of his position as Head Geologist. 4 . On February 10th the aeroplane arrived at Muscat from Sharjah with Messrs. Baker. Thompson and Kden on board. On February 11th the aircraft with the above named passengers proceeded to Has al Kadd where several flights into the interior of the country were carried out. A return being ^ made to Muscat the same day and on 11th the aeroplane# left for Bahrain with the same passengers. Mr. HotohMee departed on 15th by up mall steamer for Bahrain and K.3. Hassan by the down mail on 18th for Aden via ombay, and with the latter's departure the last of the Company s employees left Muscat and their activities for the cold weather of 1938-39 came to an end. Mr. Baker paid a call on me before he left Muscat. In contrast to Mr. Thompson he was a good deal more guarded and reserved in his statements. He declared that it was quite impossible to say at the present stage with any degree of confidence what prospects existed of finding oil in the Sultanate but that in his opinion further explorations by / land and• 3 - land and air should be carried out next winter both in Dhofor, the near neighbourhood of Muscat, and in the district between a line conneotir*; Yanqul - Baraiai and the sea. Since Mr. Baker is the Head Geologist of Petroleum Concessions Limited if such is the recommendation he gives on his return to London no doubt his suggestions will be followed and next October will see a resumption of activity by the Company in Muscat territory.

If all other things were equal, we should like to do the following 1. A detailed geological examination on the ground along the western side of the Oman range extending from the Persian Gulf on the north to the vicinity of Ibri and from the mountains v/estward to the sand-covered area. This embraces detailed mapping of the Paiyah, Dodha, Aqdar, Hafit and Ibri structures located within the above area occupied by the Deni Kaab, Beni kitab, Pa'im and A1 bu Shamis tribes. 2. A geophysical survey within the area bounded on the west by the Qatar-Abu Dhabi frontier, on the north by the ^Persian Gulf, on the south by the Abu Dhabi-Saudi Arabia frontier and on the east by the foothills along the western Oman mountain front. 3. A reconnaissance geological examination on the ground of the area bounded approximately Toy the lattitude of Dhank-Muscat on the north, parallel 22 degrees north lattitude on the south, the sand-covered area on the west and the Oman mountain front on the east. 4. Additional geological and possibly geophysical surveys along the Gulf of Oman coast, northwest of Muscat. 5. An examination on the ground of the stratigraphy exposed in the large cirque in the Jebel Sham between Ibri and/2 . and Muscat. 6. Possibly flights oven (3) above. 7. Possibly also further flights along the south coast p for which landing grounds at Shuwamiyah and Masirah would be required; and particularly^ the latter. We shall not be surprised if you tell us that some parts of the areas above specified must still remain out of bounds? but hope very much that this will not a ply to the interesting structures mentioned in item (l). It is to be remembered that our not very successful efforts to penetrate that area in ITovember; 1330 were made before we had obtained a concession from the Shaikh of *0ou Dhabi; whose good offices we shall hope to enjoy tnis year, instead of his opposition.

Party would probably number five persons. It is stated that Company would have difficulty in finding suitable British experts if objection is raised to the employment of French nationals* and would also be embarrassed in defending such an objection to the Tench interests in the Company.

However, even though the Company have been aware of the difficulties of hinterland exploration, we naturally want to help them to the beet of our ability in this direction* In this connection Sir vindlater expressed some doubts as to the advisability of our talcing up what may be called a de .lure position, at any rate at the present juncture and to the use of this expression which might be interpreted by quarters outside the Gulf • Geneva, for example - as committing to international obligation in the interior, e,g« in the direction of the suppression of slavery, air Findlater was of the opinion that it might perhaps be better to work rather on the following lines. Supposing Shaikh a is a '•concession’* Shaikh and shaikh X k petty shaikh in his territory, or at all events under his influence, whose area the Company wish to explore, re would then. Sir Findlater suggested, inform the Company, without raising the question of shaikh A’s de jure rights, that our information indicated that Shaikh A was the most likely person to help them in regard to Shaikh X.. 7. After reflection, I think that it should be quite possible to work on these lines. The Company would make personal contacts with Shaikh X through Shaikh a, and prestwn- ably offer Shaikh X a cash sum down in return for permission to explore his territory. Since it would, of course, be to the immediate advantage of Shaikh X to take the cash present, and to the ultimate advantage of Shaikh a that a likely oil area in his territory (i,e. territory claimed by him or under his influence) should be explored by the Company, I dare say / that2 - /4j that after innumerable cups of coffee had been drunk and many hours had been spent in talk an arrangement eould be come to between the Company and Shaikh X. Should Shaikh X raise the question of how his oil rights stood in case oil were found in his area* it would be explained to him that the first thing to do was to find out whether oil is likely to be found there at all. Naturally 1 would not permit the Company*s party to visit Shaikh X's area unless the latter gave suitable guarantees for their safety, and unless 1 was personally satisfied that the visit could be made in safety* The Company*s party would also be accompanied by one of my Political Officers or by myself. 8. The result of the visit of the exploration party to Shaikh x # s area would be to show either that his area had possibilities of oil, or not. If the former, then further steps would have to be considered in due course, if the latter, then. Shaikh X and his possible oil rights in relation to Shaikh a would concern us and the Company no longer. The same prooedtare could be carried out step by step with the other 'concession* and petty Shaikhs concerned.Confidential. The Residency, Busnire, tne ^tn January, 1939 3, ih In continuation of ray 'SxpreaB Letter So.719-3 of the 15th December 1938 on the subject of Petroleum ConceaeionQ Limited* a exploration in tne hinterland, 1 enclose herewith a copy of Vei^htman*ts letter iio.c/793-25/4 of the 23ra December giving cover to a report by Howes, wno accompanied the party as Political Officer. 2. Howes has produced an excellent and interesting report which adds considerably to our knowledge of Baraimi, and which uhould prove most valuable when Petroleum Concessions Limited make a fresh attempt to explore the interior. In the event of a major war too if enemy agents penetrate to the Truciai Coast hinterland, and endeavour to stir up the trices against us on the Truciai Coast (with the object for instance of cutting our Air Boute), and against the tfultan of Muscat (as they did in the ireat ar), any information which we can obtain of the interior is obviously useful. 3. To clear the ground of suae extraneous raatter - extran eous that is to say to the subject immediately under considera tion - the exploration of Petroleum Concessions Limited. In Paragraph III (d) of his report Howes makes a brief mention of elavery in the Bar aim i Oasis. That slaves were s &gt;ld in laralmi does not come as a surprise, we have had information of this before, but the numbers quoted by Howes As 'prabably* one thousand per annum appear to me vary large. I have written to reightman asking for certain further details, and wiJH then T.Peel 3Bquire, M.C., The India Office, London-2 than report separately* 4* Howes 1 information (vide paragraph II of his report) as to the influence of Xbn Baud in Bar&amp;h&amp;i being non-existent is interesting* In this connection see correspondence on the subject of xaudi-Arabian - Trucial Coast Boundaries, in particul ar paragraph 2 (v) of statement (ii) enclosed with Loch* a letter Ho.dated the 12th December 1934. 5* Howes* paragraph III (b) mentions that there are a large number of rifles and ammunition in the Oasis* further enquiries are bet ng made in this direction. 6 . To turn to the actual Petroleum Concessions Limited's exploration, as far as its immediate object of exploration went it has been a failure. The Mu scat party sponsored by the i Sultan covered a considerable distance before it reacned B&amp;r&amp;iml, via the Batinsh coast - Ibri - Yanqul and Jebel Hafit, but as it travelled fairly fast was able to do little real exploration en route. After having met the Trucial Coast party it returned from Baraimi to Muscat via Hohar to carry out its aerial exploration of the Has al Hadd - Murbat area (see correspondence ending with my telegram No.379 of the 29th November 193a). The Trucial Coaet party sponsored by the ahaixh of Abu Dh&amp;tii went straight up from that place to Baraimi. Thence they proceeded by motor for about hours south under the auspices of the *'aii of cohar (Muscat) when they met the Muscat party. After a day's work or so on Jebel Hafit they returned to B&amp;raimi with the Muscat party and after abortive negotiations to proceed south wards lasting for some two weeks returned to \bu Dhabi. Their total / ftotal stay in Baraimi area tfae about three wee^e. 7 . Yeightman and Howea between them give detailed reaaone for the failure of the exploration* Broadly speaking I think these fere as foil owe. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi lays claim to a part of Bara half and wields considerable influence there. The Sultan of Muscat ie in a similar position. But neither of these potentates can wield either full suzerainty 9 or full influence, over the whole of the Oasis. There was therefore a clash of inter eats between these two potentates, each sponsoring one of the parties, on the other hand if it had not been for the Bultan being first in the field with hie promise to get hia party into Baraimi, I doubt whether the Shaikh of \bu Dhabi would ever have assisted the party to go through hia territory. The latter’s attitude on this point until he heard that the Sultan was sponsoring a party was that of obstinate refusal. On hearing this news, however, his natural reaction must have been that if he left the field clear to the Sultan’s party his own claim to Baraimi might, in our view, go by default - at any rate to some extent. I have no doubt whatever therefore that the Mhaixh of Abu Dhabi gave confidential instructions to hie representative, who accompanied the Trucial Coast party, that he was to take them to Baraimi, but after that to allow them to move about as little as possible. 8 . Besides the Bultan of Muscat and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi there are various Shaikhs of local tribes (see Appendix III of Howes’ report). Home of these acknowledge the influence of the 3ultan, and some that of the 3haikh of Abu ;&gt;habi, while others /others appear to be independent of ooth* Gome of these local elements are almost incredibly primitive (vide paragraph III (e) of Hopes' report), and all are imbued vith the innate sue* piclon and fear which all ttibal elements have of European visits, which they look upon in the light of visitations leading to the loss of their independence, which in point of fact has quite often followed* Such fears and suspicions are generally tost in evidence in the early contacts with European visitors, whether official or unofficial, and in the present instance though Petroleum Concessions limited's geologists had paid a short visit to *3&amp;raimi in May 1937 they did not succeed in reaching some of the areas visited by the present parties* Howes is therefore substantially correct in saying (vide para graph III (e) of his report) that no European has been to Baraimi since Cox's visit in 190b, and of course no party at all on the scale of the present parties has ever visited Baraimi* The attitude of the local tribes towards these parties is best summed up in the words of some elders quoted by Howes in an earlier report: • We don't want your oil, we don't want your money, we don't like your cars. We're quite content with oar camels, our dates, and our old way of life** It is possibly inevitable that the old way of life in the hinterland may have to pass, as it has in all Arab lands, but in the meantime the attitude of the local tribes is quite a reasonable one which claims a good deal of one's sympathy* If I had, in order to account for the failure of the exploration, to pick on one main cause underlying the welter of intrigue, and play of personalities of -ihaiKhs and others, described by Weightman and Howes, I should choose the psychological factor of this local fear and suspicion. Thjo reasons for the failure- 6 - of tne exploration in the Beni r itab country are given in paragraph 4 of ^eightma^a letter. 9. Amongst the more specific causes mentlevied by /eightman for the non-success of the exploration ia the failure of the Bompany to distribute adequate monetary presents (see paragraph 3 (ii) of his letter). On this point Weightman writes: 'They (the local tribes) therefore made excuses for not conducting the second party through their territories, and the only inducement which might have been effective, namely immediate payments on a large scale, was not forthcoming. I confess that I had originally thought that once the company’s geologists were in touch with the Tfc^im and the Al 3u Bhamie dhaixns they would be able to travel without undue difficulty in their territories, but I had anticipated that adequate induce ment would be offered to them.* It is true that the sum of Ba.50,000/- asxed by the Beni Ka’ab for permission to explore ( paragraph IV of Howes' report) was exhorbitant, but the sum that tne party had to pay for one day's work at Jebel Hax'it Hs.7o/- (see the same paragraph of Howes’ report) though large was not out of a-U proportion to the end in view. Longrigg zias always laid stress on tne fact that the Company’s parties, if once we got them into the hinterlana, would buy their way from place to place from the local 3 hai*hfl, and he gave ua to understand that the actual period which the party would want to otay in any one place for purpose of a preliminary exploration would not be more than say four or five days. For this period the total, even at He.70/- per diem, in any one area would not work out at more thtm say Ha. 400 - which in/- 6 - in comparison with the is sues at staece, and the large sums which the company are prepared to pay for their concessions, is not axcesaive* If the party had been prepared to pay out In cash up to say Ha. 4000/- - not a large a da - to the minor local ShaiKha it seems to me that they might have been able to do somewhat more exploration. 10. With regard to the presence of a Political Officer with the Trucial Coast party, Weightman in another letter jives the foil caring opinion based on reporto from Howes i *''ha Trucial Coast party might quite well have found themselves unable to move even from Abu Dhabi to Baraimi but for his own presence with thara as representative of (Bahrain) the Political Agent/whom the linaiich had promised to conduct any where he chose to go in Abu Dhabi territory, similarly the party's stay in Baraiai would probably imve been very much shorter.’* I quite concur, further, X have no doubt that the presence of a Political officer with the party was a distinct asset in ensuring that though it met with obstruction at aqy rate no act of open hostility was displayed against it. A moat important consideration. 11. even though Petroleum Canceusions Limited*» venture to Bar aim! has been a failure from tne point of view of actual exploration I am certainly not of opinion that it has been wasted. Briefly, as in previous cases of opening up of the trueial Coast, the ice has been oroken. There is indeed nothing new or particularly surprising in the opposition at present displayed towards oil exploration. All pnases of the opening up of zne Crucial Coast which have taxen pluog during the last tor. /-7- ten years or so hare nst, in tiwir initial stages, with the 3 arje difficulties. Nowadays for example we t&amp;xe the Air Route alont,' the Trucial Coast for granted, but I can remember only 30ma 5 yoitrs ago that when this scheme was first mooted the opposition to it amongst tae coastal Shaikhs was even stronger than that now shown against oil exploration in the interior, and the welter of local intrigue that went on was even greater. A definite anti-air combine was formed by the Shaixhs by which each bound himself not to grant any facilities in his area, the underlying cause of this opposition being preoiaely the same as that against oil exploration - a fear by the Shaikhs and their people of encorachments on their territories and their liberties, it took my predecessor - Biacoe - many months of hard and patient negotiations to break down this opposition, and persuade the Shaikh of Sharjah to leave the casbine and give ths facilities required. The Shaikh finally did this only with cne utmost reluctance, and with considerable apprehension that in doing so he was risking his ahaikhship and his life - either at the hands of his own people or of the neighbouring Shaikhe. A« time passed, however, and the Trucial Coast saw that we made no attempt on the basis of our air facilities to impose a close adminiatration or olosor control on Sharjah, local public opinion completely veered round, and before very long the Shaikh of c«bai, eeeing the considerable financial advantages which Sherjah was obtaining in return for facilities which he had given, w.e actually asking us if we could not move our air Port frmn Sharjah to Debai i I have no doubt that in the end w. shall get our -oil fnoilit ies-, i. e . full exploration in the interior,1a tn. same way that w e got our air facilities. The / fact /- 8 - ffct thct t ¥0 perties of D etroleum Concessions Limited hfve sctueliy oenetrfted to Berrimi, hsve moved 8bout to the limited extent possible, hrve mfde contacts vith the loc?l Fheikhs rnd hsve been able to vithdrev vithout eny hostile demonstrrtion being msde egeinst them, is much to the good. Te h?ve plso acquired vclupble information as to local oersonalities, conditions and the particular difficulties to be overcome. £11 this should assist us materially vhen the second attempt of Petroleum Concessions Limited for eroloring the hinterland is made. 12. Another advantage vhich ve have gained by the present exoedition seems to me that it provides a reoly to the /'merican oil interests in case they should orocose exploring the interior. If v.e had sent no oarty into the interior they might have argued that ve vere adopting a dog in the manger attitude, i.e. that v.hile making no effort to exolore the interior ourselves v.e prevented them from doing so. The **act that oarties of D etroleum Concessions Limited have actually visited the hinterland provides a good ansver to any such argument. 13. In regard to vhen the second attemot at D etroleum Concessions Limited exploration should be made, Veightman in his oaragraph o says that Longrigg T s oresent feeling is that all hones this year of ground exploration must be abandon ed. I am inclined to agree, and to be of the on‘nion t^at ve had better let the hinterland settle dovn a^ter the recent^ Petroleum Concessions Limited»s visit and postpone any further exploration until the autumn of this year. This applies on^y / toto ground exploration. There is no retaon jrhy the Caaipiiny, when they have finished their Has a l Hadd - MurOat aerial survey, should not malce a similar survey of, at any rate part, of the hinterland. Whether they can do this, and to what extent, will have to be considered later. 14. X am sending a copy of this letter with enclosure* to Metcalf* and without to ?eightmau. Yours s incerely sd.

I presume that the survey will be by the new grovitymeter method (1 am not quite sure how it works 9 but this method enables large tracts of desert area to be covered in a comparatively short space of time for the purpose of selecting specific a&lt; eaa where closer work can be done t e.g. by seismograph)* Subject to the remarks made above, there will, I suggest, be no need for us to intervene in the dis cussions with the shaikh of /bu lhabi which the Company's own representative can conduct on the basis of the concession* 4* fo turn now to item 1* Last winter we could do nothing with the Beni Kitab, end the Company effected their contacts with the Beni Ka'ab, the Jfcia'im and the Al Bu Shamis through the Stfltsn of Muscat*s .ali at 3ohar. It is needless to re capitulate the reasons for the failure of last year* s attempt, which are summarised in your demi-official letter fto* 30-3 dated the 9th January 1939 to Peel and its enclosures* This ya^r I strongly advise that the approach to the ^‘im and Al Bu Shaitiis should be via the ihaikh of Abu Dhabi and his rep resentative in the Baraimi Oasis* Direct contacts might be established in one of the ihalkh of Abu Dhabi's villages in the Baraimi Oasis between the Company*a representative (pre sumably Lermitte) and the tribal dhsikhs concerned - in parti cular with Mohammad bin Kahmah of the Jebel Kafit Al Bu nhamis There must of course be some money showing and promises of more on completion of the survey* 5* It is however not impossible that such s procedure might cost the Company a certain amount of good will with the Sultan of Muscat, and I can only suggest that this difficulty bs obviated by giving iiuacat so ;»uch to do in conducting /-corAucVlng other parties further to the aouth-epgt (cf* items 3 t 4 and 5 in iongrig^ 1 * letter) that the Sttltsn of Muscat may di«reg#rd tl»e Company 1 a method of appi'o&amp;ch to the Ka'lm, A1 nu Jhamla and the i^eni Ka'ab* But for this to be efCectlve t it seoine to ®e ea^ontial that thare iauat ce a *00 man's land* between the fields of activity of the predominantly Trucial Coast party anl the predominantly kSuscat party* this vacuum mi^ht be taken on a line running roughly south from the western end of the *adi Jlzzi (leaving Hail and all towna in the v^adi on the fcuacot aida) to Fida (leaving Fide, Dot ^ulI )hank to tne Irucial Coaat); then bearing sou til-south-west to Include Jeoel K ha tail! which is rcu^jhly eoutii of Jhank 9 and the AflaJ deni Kitab in Uie Trucial Coast area.

Please refer to your K3Q)rebs Letter Ho. 448-3 dated 4th May 1939 addressed to the Secretary of :tute for India I received your letter quoted above after sending 2 my telegram No. 94 dated the 17th May 1939. As I was expecting a communication from you oa the subject of India Office letter No. P.Z. 2347 dated the 16th April and India Office telegram No, 838 dated the 10th May 1939, I deferred making any comments on the proposed plans of Petroleum Concessions Limited. 3. The decision regarding the method of approach to the areas that the Company wish to explore has now been taken so that any comments from me can have no bearing on the case, but I venture to suggest that the Sultan will resent negotiations being opened through the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi for exploration in areas which he undoubtedly considers form part of his territories. last winter he arranged for a party of geologists to travel from Fuscat 4e via Ibri, Yankul, and Jabal Halit to Braimi. Unfortunately 'the hasty nature of the journey* precluded the party from making a proper examination of the route they followed. I cannot find a record of why the journey was 'hasty' but possibly the geologists who were of the party have made some report which I have not had. This year a similar / par tv could The Hon’ble Lieut-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowls,K.C.I.E.,C.S.B., Political Resident in tho Persian Gulf Bushire.2 - P&amp;rty could bo t&amp;kon *t a aore loiauroly rate over the eame route and probably complete the Jfcbal Hafit exploration. I do not euggest that they should go on to Baralml but return to the Batinah coast at Sohar ehile a Trucial Coast party acting under the auspices of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and Sheikh Kh&amp;iid bin Ahmad should deal with Baraimi, Jebel Rodhah, and Jebel Baiyah and so on to the north. A* I have now read the extract from the note you made on the 25th of October 1937. I presume that if the geologists are able to enter the areas of Jab&amp;l Hafit and Dh&amp;nk or any other part of the territory of the Sultan of Muscat and Qnan through the medium of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi then the fact of their having so entered will not imply that we are committed in any way to acknowledge such rights as Abu Dhabi Hi might claim to those areas or the independance of the tribal sheikhs living in those areas, and I suppose that the Sultan would not be held in any way responsible for the safety of the party or any misadventure that might happen to them.

In view (a) of Sultans claims in this area (b) of fact Company entered it last year under his auspices and (c) of probability that news of negotiations will very soon reach him Company urge it would be desirable for Political Agent to inform him at an early date of pre parations that are being made by Company through Trucial Shaikhs on advice of Government and to give him an expla nation on the lines indicated in paragraph 4(2) of your letter.

Hickihbotham, O.B.E., Political Agent &amp; H.B.M's Consul, Muscat. The Hon*hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire • Sir, I have the honour to refer to my letter No. C/99 dated the 22nd May 1939 and my telegram No. 110 of the 8th June 1939, and to enclose a copy of an extract from a note prepared by myself after interviewing His Highness the Sultan on the 8th June 1939. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Captain, I .A., Political Agent &amp; H.B.M's Consul, Muscat.4 ) Copy of an extract from a note prepared by Captain T. Hiekinbotham, O.B.E., Political Agents H.B.MU Consul, Muscat on an interview with His Highness the Sultan of Muscat on the 8th June 1939. '2* His Highness the Sultan said he was having a really busy time as he had Sagr bin Sultan, the Haim, the Sheikh of the A1 Bu Shamis and Ahmad As Saif, the Jabel Hafit Haim, in his house* They had arrived yesterday to see him* I explained that I had asked for this interview in order to discuss Petroleum Concessions Limited's plans for the winter. I said, as he knew, I had come specially back from Gwadur to see him but on my arrival yesterday I discovered that Petroleum Concessions' representative was proposing to go to Sohar in the hope of meeting him there and as I had no idea that he was proposing to leave Muscat I had now come to ask him if he did intend to go to Sohar or not for if he was not going there it was quite useless Petroleum Concessions' representative going there to meet him. The Sultan said that he had no intention of going to Sohar* Sometime ago the Haim and the A1 Bu Shamis Sheikhs had said they would like to come to Muscat to see him and he had put them off and said N I will see you when I come to Sober' * They had again asked through his Yali at Sohar when he was going to Sohar and he had replied 'after I return from Dhofar'. Further letters had elicited the answer 'after I return from Gwadur'. His Highness said that it had certainly not been his intention to go to Sohar at this, the hottest, time of the year* He did not believe in interviewing people till he was ready to use them as if you gave them time to think they always made difficulties which were hard to overcome* M few days ago his Wali at Sohar had written that the A1 3a Shamis had arrived and was / proposingproposing 'to come in and 866 him in Muscat*. He had ao one;, written and told the Wali to disuade the Sheikh from coming to Muscat and to put him off by saying that he would let him know when he was coming to Sohar* (I think nis Highness was trfrU-njHng of his pocket) • The Wali replied that the A± Bu Shamis insisted on coming to Muscat and that the two Naim Sheikhs also ha d appeared. Ha* the Sultan* immediaT/;i,y sent, a car for them. They have had lengthy discussions and, His Highness said, had expressed their loyalty to him am their willingness to follow his directions. I said I thought that if Petroleum Concessions Limited mmxm wished to discuss their programme then now was the time and Muscat the place. His Highness agreed hut remarked that the Sheikhs were returning tomorrow. I said that this was unfortunate. His Highness aaid that their presence was not essential to any discussion vvitn Petroleum Concessions Limited all that was necessary was f or him to give them such directions as might be necessary after talking matteis over with Petroleum Concessions Limited J s representative. His Highness added that he had arranged, at their request, a year's truce between the A1 Bu Shamis Sheikh and Sagr bin Sultan of the Naim. I informed the Sultan that I would inform the Resident of the situation and suggest that Petroleum Concessions Limited send their representative here as soon as possible.* 4</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000c9_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/426</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000c9</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/426</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File XIV A/1 IV Oil Concession in Muscat'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1938/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-10-20T11:14:17</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (227 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in rough chronological order from the front to the rear of the volume.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the first folio with 1 and terminates at the last folio with 218; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
