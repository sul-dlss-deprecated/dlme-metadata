ToCopy of a demi-official letter No. F.322-0/34, dated the 7th December 1934, from H.ffirevelyan, j&amp;sq., Under Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, to the Political Officers. Arrangements in connection with the celebration of His majesty's Silver Jubilee, 1935. 1 am desired to address you regarding the method of celebrating the Silver Jubilee of His i^ajesty the King-Smperor in Indian States. 2. The official celebrations in England will last from May 6th to Hay 18th, special Thanksgiving Services being held on accession day, Monday May 6th, or the following Sunday. 3. The Government of India have decided that in spite of obvious climatic drawbacks the celebrations in India should take place simultaneously with those in Great Britain and other parts of the Empire. The only alter native would be to postpone the celebrations in India for about 6 months which is obviously out of the question. They have therefore decided that May 6th should be a Pub lic Holiday throughout India and that a second holiday should be granted by the local authorities on any day within the period of celebrations which may seem suit able to them. His Majesty the King-ifimperior has express -ed a wish that the celebrations should be on a local basis, so that people should, wherever practicable, have an opportunity to celebrate the occasion near their homes: that the celebrations should be as simple as possible and that undue expenditure should be avoided. The celebrations in British India, which it is hoped will be in the main outline uniform in all the provinces, will be held at provincial capitals, at the headquarters of all districts and at such other centres in each district as ma y a iP ear suitable. A Thanksgiving Service will be heldin all Christian Churches on the same day as the Thanks giving Service held in Londtm, i.e. on Monday, May6th, and it has heen suggested to local Governments that followers of other religions if approached in the matter will no doubt hold services in their own places of wor ship on the same day. It has heen agreed that apart from the Thanksgiving Service the celebrations may suit able be on the same lines as at the time of the Diamond Jubilee of C^ueen Victoria, when they took the forms of distribution of alms to the poor, the entertainment of school children, illumination of public and private buildings, fire-works, bon-fires, etc. The local Govern ments have been asked to arrange for the appointment of local committees to carry out the necessary arrangements and to collect such funds as may be required for the purpose. 4. As regards the celebration of the occasion in Indian States, the Government of India do not desire to take the initiative but would like to know as early as possible the arrangements which Kulera are making for the celebration cf the Jubilee. It is suggested that Bulers may like to hold Darbars where climatic conditions do not make it out of the question. The Government of India would of course be glad that Political Officers should accept invitations from the Bulers of States to attend such Darbars where it is practicable for them to do so. I air to request you, if you see no objection, kindly to inform the ^^ the Indian State!s) wftth which you are in political relations, of the nature of the celebrations which it is proposed should take place in British India and of His majesty's wishes that they should he simple and should not entail undue expenditure.

Se ere taryPUBLIC APPEAL BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE VICEROY &gt;S As all India is aware, the 25th Anniversary of His Majesty the King Emperor r s accession to the Throne, which falls on Monday the 6th May, 1935, is to he celebrated by special rejoicings throughout the Empire, His Majesty has been graciously pleased to approve of the proposal that, in commemoration of so auspicious an occasion, a fund should be raised in India for charitable purposes and that it should be devoted to the Indian Red Cross Society, the St. John Ambulance (Indian Council), the Countess of Buffering Fund and the Indian Soldiers * 1 Benevolent Fund. It will be noticed that the four institutions specially selected are of an All-India character and are well known to all classes in the country as a constant source of relief to cases of suffering and want, and that any monies which may be received, excepting sums actually expended on organisation, will, in accordance with Their Majesties’ express desire, be expended on relieving distress and suffering in this country. I feel that I am on safe grounds in entrusting the general execution and organisation of such an appeal to India to Her Excellency Lady Willingdon, who has intimated her willingness to undertake this important responsibility as President of the Fund and who will presently issue her own general appeal to the Princes and People of India, asking them to assist her in every possible way to make this undertaking a success worthy of the occasion. Her Excellency will be assisted by a small body of advisers and I have appointed Mr. C.P. Colvin, O.B.S., as Honorary Secretary and Mr. G.Kaula, C.I.E., as Honorary Treasurer, of the Central Fund. I have already consulted the heads of all provincial Governments and local Administrations with regard to their co operation in the areas under their control and they have signified their general concurrence to the proposals I have made to them and will no doubt now proceed to appoint their own Committees to further the general scheme, the intention being that each Province or Administration shall conduct its own campaign for the collectionV ( 2 ) of funds. Their Majesties have signified their approval of all collections being merged in one grand total and the total amount collected by each Province or Administration should be remitted to the Centpal Fund. After Their Majesties have been informed of the result, arrangements will be made to return to the Provinces and various Administrations substantial proportions of the sums they have raised, for expenditure v/ithin their boundaries on the objects already named. It has already been announced by a Communique to the Press that the 6th of May, 1935, will be a public holiday throughout British India and I now appeal to the Princes, the wealthy landowners and merchants, as well as to the people of India at large, for a signal proof of their devotion to the Crown and of their generosity towards those in need of help. I ask the poor men to give his anna and the rish man to assist according to his means towards Their Majesties* Silver Jubilee • Fund in India and I am convinced that the result will be one which will be worthy of this momentous event and of this great and l r yal country of India. WILLINGDON.APPEAL BY HSR EXCELLENCY THE COUNTESS OF VILLIKGDG. to the PRINCES KFD PEOPLE OP INDIA» You will have seen His Excellency the Viceroy’s announcement of the 11th insuant that the 6th of May,193^ will be a public holiday in India in honour of the 25th Anniversary of His Majesty’s accession to the Throne and that, in commemoration of that event, a fund is to be raised in India which, at Their Majesties’ desire, is to': devoted to certain selected medical and relief associatia of an All-India character, namely, the Indian Red Cross Society, the St. John Ambulance (Indian Council), the Countess of Dufferin’s Fund and the Indian Soldiers' Benevolent Fund. I have readily accepted the responsibility of organizing the general arrangements in connection with thi p und and, if my efforts are to be successful, I feel that 1 must beg for the warm support of all classes in the country, with a special appeal to the women of India to assist me in the task I have uncertaken, and I do this with the greater readiness for the reason that the monies collected will be devoted to the relief of the poor and M I mmmmm mmm nmmiwiiMuiMiiiMM m wuMMUMm needy and the women and children in hospitals and dispensaries throughout the country. irr ■ The splendid work done by the institutions to which Their Majesties desire that the collections should be devoted is well known throughout India and has proved /*+ of^greatest material benefit to all classes in the country hut it is essential that very much larger sums should be raised for these institutions than has hitherto been possible if wa are to keep pace with their steadily increasing development and expenditure.

Further communications in regard to the Fund will be supplied regularly to the Press by the Honorary Secretary as occasion arises, and communications regarding the various subsidiary funds will no doubt be published by the Committees formed under provincial Governments and local Administrations, etc. I appeal earnestly to all classes to assist actively, both by subscribing to the Fund and by helping- in the collection^ of subscriptions and donations, as also by sparing some of tn.-r time for organising entertainments in various centres, and I feel confident that our united efforts will afford an outstanding proof of the generosity of the Princes and People of India and of their loyalty to their beloved King Hmperor and His Consort. MARIS Y/ILLIHGDOH, President of Their Majesties’ Silver Jubilee Fund, India.IMORANDUM REGARDING THEIR IviAJSSTIES* SILVER JUBILEE FU1-TD. A pubiic appeal from His Excellency the Viceroy, the Patron of this Bund, issued in the Press on the 11th,. December and a second, from Her Excellency the Countess of Hillingdon, the Preside't of the 0 n the 13th, December. It was made clear in these appeal s that each Province cr Administration will conduct its own car.! aign for the collection of money, that the amounts collected by . Provinces ai : .d Administrations, excepting sums actually $ expended on organisation, will be remitted, in due course, to the Central i’und and that a substantial proportior will eventually be returned to the Provinces and Administrations, ||||M 111 ■IWMI—MMinaiimi I ior expenditure^ locally, on the four medical and el. \;f institutions to \l . -n the Bund is to be devoted. It lias been decided that the collection of fund,. d;om the Military Services in British India sha.-i be uuuer the control and organisation of the Military Author!tie • His Excell exicy the Commander-in- Chi ef will issue special instructions regarding this matter to the District Commands* 2. Money retained by the Central Fund will be expo ’ed only on the f' r institutions mentioned in His Excell o' appeal and will be distributed among them in such o :o'portions as may be decided upon by His Excellency in consultation, wioh the President of the Fund and her Advisory Committee. It will b e left to the Provinces and Administrations to decide how sums returned to them by the Central Fu... d d rail be expended, w: thin their own borders, on the four institutions to i . the Fund is to be devoted. Similarly, Indian States will be asked to devoir 'i - ' collections to such objects as come within the scope o: the appeal. If it should prove that certain Indian States receive littic or no benefit from any cf the four prescribed institutions, there may bo grounds for2 exceptional treatment, admitting of the money allooatei for expenditure within such States being given to institutions for medical or nursing relief already existing within the State. 3. Ag the Weather on the 6th of May, the day which is being declared a public holiday throughout India, will be decidedly sultry in may parts of the country, it is suggested that collection lists of Provinces and Administrations be opened on or about the 1st February 1935, and that , : ,+ nrt be made with functions and 1. entertainments in aid of the Fund before the weather lots too hot. It is probable that, in certain respects, the programmes which were prepared for 'Our Pay' in 1917 will be followed. On that occasion, when a general collection was made for the Red Cross under La3y Chelmsford’s guidance, the splendid sum of Rs. 122 lalchs was coll ected* It is hoped that on this auspicious occasion of His Majesty’s Silver Jubilee a comparable sum may be forthcoming to devote to the relief of distress a suf fering in India* 4. Local Committees and Advisory Bodies formed within the Provinces and Administrations will of course adopt their own methods of raising money for this Fund besides public subscription lists, but the following ideas are suggested for '“^ir consideration:- [(a) A Flag or Pays. (Steps are now being taken to procure a suitable Flag which can be given as a receipt for any donation from an anna upwards and be worn as a button-hole. Some 15 or 20 million will probably be required for all India). For 'Our Pay' in 1917, over Rs. 40 lakhs were collected by the sale of flags, a result due in large measure to the personal efforts of district officials, of Indian ladies and gentlemen and the &gt; *» -3-ready response from the public at large* (b) Benefit meetings by Turf Clubs and R ace Clubs* (c) Benefit entertainments by Picture Houses and The at i’/-; ^ - (d) Benefit Sports days and entertainments by Universities, Colleges aid Schools* f(e) Mel as or Fancy Fairs* (f) Lucky Bags. In 1917 these Bags were organised for the 'Our Bay 11 Fund in about 30 centres in India and produced about seven lakhs of rupees* It is hoped that similar Bags may be again arranged by local Committees, A copy of a U^te 'How to run Lucky Bag' is attached. Further copies can be procured if required from the Honorary Secretary *f the Central Fund, Delhi; (g) Zanana and Purdah meetings organised by Indian ladies for the purpose of raising funds# f (h) Concerts, theatrical entertainments, subscription da neesi (i) A Sabbao. iy may perhaps be set aside by Churches for special collections for the Fund* (The Metropolitan of India, the Roman Catholic Bishops in India and the Principal dignitaries in India of ~ther Christian Churches are being addressed by the Honorary Secretary on behalf of Her Excellency and asked to gi :r e their support to this suggestion)* 4. Th^ Imperial Bank of India have been asked to act as bankers to Eheir Majesties 1 Silver Jubilee Fund, India, aid to agree to the remittances to and from the Pund T s account v/ith the Imperial Bank being made at par in the fallowing cases (a) Moneys offered at the Imperial Bank T s branches and offices throughout India (including Burma)-- * -4-for remittance to the Central Fund r s account in the New Delhi branch of the Imperial Bank, and. (b; Remittances from the Central F un dL f s account with the New . ~ ki branch of the Imperial Bank to any of the branches and offices of the Imperial Ban': in Inaia (including Burma) for payment to the authorities of the local branches of the Silver Jubilee Fund* 5. It isjiot proposed to advertise to the public at large that collections_and donations can be sent to the Honorary Treasurer of the Fund at_Delhi as it has been decided that collections should b e decentralised and be made by each Province or Administration. It is however possible that collections or donations from certain quarters may be sent to the Honorary Treasurer and, if so, he will of course receive and account for them. The norary Secretary of the Central F un d will periodically publish lists of any collections and donations received by the Honorary Usurer, and the Provinces and Administrations will no doubt themselves publish li&amp;U of coll ectio is and donations received by them;A LUCKY BAG with hints how to run it. The main ob i ect of a L «cky Bag is to collect money, but if a Lucky Bug is^ nm on generous principles it can also be made a popular affair, and ghc a good deal of excitement and pleasure to an investing public. Among the most successful Bags in India was that organised by Lady Minto for the Calcutta Hospitals in 1907, which resulted in Rs. 48,000/-; Lady Wdlingdon’s Bag in November 1916, Rs. 52,000/-; Lady Monro’s Bag in Simla in June 1917 which brought in Rs. 53,400/-and Mrs. Stuart Fraser’s Bag at Hyderabad (Deccan) in August 1917, Rs. 45,000/-; all the three latter being in aid of the Red Cross. Then in 1917 about 40 Lucky Bags were held in India in connection with “Our Day”. These Bags resulted in about seven lakhs being realised for the Red Cross. The most successful of these Bags were those held at Cawnpore, Rs. 1,22,000/-; Jullundur, Rs. 80,000/-; Madras, Rs. 60,000/- and Rawalpindi’ Rs. 56,000/-. ’ •Past experience has shown that the following procedure has proved the most successful plan in conducting a Lucky Bag. First issue a number of appeals to all classes to give presents and donations to the Bag. Ihese appeals should be continued from time to time; the local or provincial Press should be asked to assist with free advertisements and notices and continual paragraphs, indicating the progress of the Bag; leceipt of valuable prizes etc., should be supplied to the Press. As articles are received they should be at once acknowledged, entered in a numbered catalogue and placed in large cases, each article being carefully mai'ked with its own number. Considerable space is required if a large Lucky Bag is contemplated. Ordinarily, three to five months is required to ensure a successful Bag; and the all-time services of four or five persons during this period is advised. 1 )uiing the last fortnight at least ten assistants are recommended and on the days when prizes are drawn about forty to fifty assistants are required. The tickets enabling persons to draw for prizes can be sold for a couple of months or so before the Bag opens, and also on the day or days during which it runs. These tickets can be printed in values of one, five, ten or twenty chances, and different colours are strongly recommended for the various values. As a rule, the number of tickets sold is in the ratio of 6 or 7 to 1 prize, but if there are a number of substantial cash and other prizes, the ratio might easily be fixed at 10 to 1 for a Royal Bag. It llas been found expedient to keep the “cash and sale of tickets department ” as separate as possible from that which deals with the receipt of presents, their numbering and packing and the cataloguing of prizes. On the day preceding the drawing, all the prizes should be arranged on trestle tables in a long row of tents, so that the public can see them2 easily, but a barrier should be erected preventing the public from being able to touch the prizes. (About 100 yards length of tents and tables were necessary for Lady Monro’s Ihig in Simla in 1917 which contained about 5,000 prizes). The drawing of prizes can be conducted at barrels on platforms, raised 18 inches from the ground. For a Lucky Bag with 5,000 prizes at least 8 or 10 barrels, distant 40 or 50 yards from each other, are recommended. Each barrel should contain about 5,000 ordinary gun wads or discs. The prize numbers should be printed on these gun wads or discs, viz: 1 to 5,000. The other wads would be blank. Each barrel should be in charge of two or three men and as ticket holders draw out numbered wads, they should proceed to the Prize Tent, hand in their winning wads to the attendants in charge and receive their prizes. All cash prizes should be paid at a separate tent by a special staff. ( It is recommended that a local Bank should be asked to assist in the matter.) Tickets disposed of on the ground should be sold at some distance f 10111 the other tents, for it should be remembered that it is highly important to prevent overcrowding. A certain amount of crush at the barrels is unavoidable when the Bag is in full swing. At Lady Monro’s Bag in Simla, 20 ladies handed out piizes, 24 men assisted on the barrels, 6 men worked in the cash tent and 4 men in the Ticket Sale tent. If the management of a Lucky B;ig are prepared to take the res ponsibility of drawing for those who purchase tickets from distant places and to arrange for the storage of their prizes, these facts should be clearly made known at the outset. Otherwise all tickets should be sold with The management cannot undertake to draw for ticket holders. They must make the necessary arrangements through agents or friends ” printed on the tickets. 1 his has been a most important point in connection with more than one big Bag. A copy of a notice regarding a Lucky Bag sent to various persons and to Commercial Houses and Trading Establishments in Calcutta in 1906, is annexed as a sample.Specimen of a Lucky Bag ticket for Lady Monro s Lucky Bag at Annandale, 1917. These copies are actual size and (A) shows front side, (B) reverse. This ticket was actually red in colour; the one-rupee ticket was green &gt; the five-rupees ticket (giving five chances) was blue; and the twenty-rupees ticket was white. (A) (B) o Purchasers of these tickets must please make their own arrangements through friends, if necessary, both for drawing for prizes and removing them when won from Annandale on June 9th. The management cannot undertake either of these duties. + MONSTER + LUCKY BAG IN AID OF THE RED CROSS Annandale, June 9th, 1917 TEN CHANCES 10 Rupees P. T. O.@ The Minto Fancy Fete TO BE HELD ON THE CALCUTTA MAID AN, JANUARY 28 th to FEBRUARY Gth, 1007 IN AID OF THE CALCUTTA HOSPITALS, The CALCUTTA NURSING ASSOCIATION, and The INDIAN NURSING ASSOCIATION. It is proposed that one of the prominent entertainments at the Fancy Fete shall be a MONSTER LUCKY BAG, and that its organisation shall be conducted on the same principles as that held at Belvedere in ( alcutta in aid of the Provincial Famine Fund in February 1897. In view of the great claim the Calcutta Hospitals and Nursing Association have upon the public, it is hoped that wide and cordial support may be looked for from all classes of the community, and that the “Lucky Bag”, to fill which your co-operation is now invited will prove an unprecedented success. May I therefore beg that you will very generously send us SOME THING as a prize ? The nature of your contribution, be it an egg or an elephant, a chest of tea or a case of champagne, a packet of pins or a hundred rupees, is quite immaterial. Already numerous valuable gifts have been promised, and whether donations are sent in money or kind, all will be placed in the “Lucky Bag”, if sent for that purpose. However small, any contribution will be MOST welcome, for it is hoped that the management will be able to announce on the day of drawing that the number of presents is sufficient to allow of “all prizes and no blanks”. It is particularly requested that, as the time is short and the preparations for the Fete involve considerable labour, prizes may be sent in with as little delay as possible. These should be addressed to:— * * Tickets, Price Re. 1 - each, for the Bag will be obtainable from the Honorary Secretaries in January, and priority in drawing will, as far as possible, be given to tickets taken before the opening of the Fete, All gifts for the “Lucky Bag” will be duly acknowledged, and a catalogue with rules and regulations, together with all donors’ names, and a full list of prizes will be published in due course. 5th December, 1906.Nose regarding; tae publication in the Press of donations and collections for Their Mei os ties' Sia.ver Jubilee Fund received by she Honorary Treasurer of the G_entral Fund ; , Mew Delhio The question as to the most sihtable method of publish ing those donations for Their Majesties 1 Silver Jubilee Funde which may be received by the Honorary Treasurer of the Central Fund, New Delhi, has been receiving cons .deration and it has been decided that lists of sjztounts received by the Honorary Treasurer,, with the names of the donors, will be published by him in the Press from time to tine when the amounts re ceived aggregate a fairly substantial sum, and that in the meantime the Press will not ^ e advised s eparat ely ,ol individual donations unless they are cf considerable magnitude, in which case a brief unofficial Press Notice v-il issue in order to signalise such specially generous centr.'.Tuticncu In the event bf donations being received by the Honorary Treasurer of the Central Fund which would properly form part of the collect ions to be made by Provinces or administrations, intimation will be sent by the Honorary Treasurer to the Provinces or Administrations concerned so that such sums may readily be included in their totals.

Old Secretariat Buildings, Delhi, the 12th January 1935. «/ith reference to the opening sentence of the ’'Note regard- ing the publication in the Press of donations and collections for Their Majesties’ Silver Jubilee Fund received by the Honorary measurer 01 the Central Fund, New Delhi”, forwarded with my letter dated the 4th January, I write to make it clear that the lists of amounts received by the Honorary Treasurer of the Central Fund, New Delhi, with the names of the donors, which will be pub lished by him in the Press, will only contain the names or designa tions of doners cr collectors who send money either to him direct or to his account with the Imperial Bank of India, New Delhi. ; ben a Province, for instance, sends to the Honorary Treasurer a remittance, consisting; of donations or collections which have been received by the Provincial Committee of the Fund, the Honorary Treasurer, Tew Delhi, will publish the fact that such a remittance has been received from the Province concerned, but will not publish the individual names of donors cr collectors. It is presumed that Local Committees in Provinces, Adminis trations cr States will publish in the Press the names of indi vidual doners or collectors from 'whom they receive money, and I am to say that the President of the Fund would be very much ob liged if two copies ef all such published lists might be sent to the Honorary Treasurer, Their Majesties 1 Silver Jubilee Fund, 11, Barakhamba Hoad, New Delhi, and a copy also to me.(1 No* 311-20/10# Political Agency f Bahrain| tha 25th February 1935 To The Honourary Secretary f Their Majesty's Silver Jubilee Fund, India Old Secretariat Buildings, Delhi, Dear Sir P I beg to refer to your letter No.PG/2 dated the 4th February 1935 about raising a Fund for charitable purposes in connection with the 25th Anniversary of His Majesty's Accession to the Throne, and to say that I am in communication with the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the 2# i have no doubt that the British Subjects resident in Bahrain will wish to associate themselves with your object* subject Yours faithfully Lieut*Colonel Political Agent, Bahrain.No•312-20/10 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 25th February 1935 From Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain, To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire• Sir i have the honour to refer to your printed letter No•206 nated the 29th January 1935 and to our conversation on the 23rd February 1935 regarding Hta Majesty's Silver Jubilee. 2.

(ill)(iii) It has a ; been recognised, in para* 2 of the Memorandum sent with letter dated the 15th December 1934, that 'if it should prove that certain Indian Statee receive 1 tie or no benefit from an/ of the four prescribed institutions, - there ma/ be grounds for exceptional treatment, admitting of the mone/ allocated for expenditure within such States being given to insti* tions for medical or nursing relief alread/ existing with' the State* * It has now been de^ ^ed that the precise objects of medical and health relief wo which the proportion of the ?und return- - able to a State or Actoiinistered Area should be devoted will be decided y the Ruler concerned nr, in the case of an Ad ministered rea, b/ the Committee-to be appointed for raising contributions, and that the President of the ?Und should be advised through the Honorar/ Secretary thereof, for the in formation of Their Majesties, of such decisions before the ?und in closed* (ir) It will be seen that it is no longer necessary for the objects of relief to be 'already existing within the State* and this decision has been come to in view of the fact that in some cases it may be desirable to found new institutions for medi cal and health relief such as Maternity Homes or Child Wel fare Clinics and lao in view of the fact that a State may consider it in the interests of its people to give assist ance to an institution outside the particular State* An example of such an institution is the King Edward Hospital and Medical School, Indore, which offers medical and nuroi ng training to candidates from all States in Central India (a* - well as in Rajputana and elsewhere)* It is understood that the great value of this institution, whose present financial position is critical, and its splended record in the past are fully appreciated by all the States and that many Rulers in Central India and Rajputana and even elsewhere would very probably wish to devote thereto some portion of that amount from the Silver Jubilee Fund which can be expended at their discretion* (v) While it ie left to the Rulers of States and to the Silver Jubilee Fund Committee in Administered Areas to name the objects to which the returnable portion of the Fund shall be devoted,', it is however hoped that the Rulers and Committees will, before arriving at their decisions, take into consider ation the advisability of alio ting a portion of the return able amounts towards opening or developing Red Cross and St.John Ambulance branches within the territories in question. ’Thile it is realised that the four institutions which have been selected to receive assistance from the Silver Jubilee Fund may not at present be of great practical and direct in terest to all the Princes and People in the States, it is felt that, if States would agree to agree and develop Red Cross and St.John Ambulance branches within their borders, this would, while leaving the expenditure of the incone of each State Branch Comnittee of these institutions entirely in their own hands, ensure a degree of technical supervision and advice, especially as regards health and welfare work for women.and children, which may at times have been lacking in Indian States. The Indian Red Cross Society kct, 1920, provides for the in come of each Branch being expended by the Branch Cocsnittee and at their discretion upon all or any of the objects de tailed in the first schedule of the Act. These objects cover a wide field and would admit of a State Branch Committee of the Red Cross giving financial assistance to local health and welfare institutions, either exicting or to be formed within a State* Similarlyr Similarly■ M »»«»«• iTai,;;5s 8 ';' “• ooi *‘ 1 “ n ' c ' oi ' fied in their General RegulatiDn^. 3.

Sale of medals in commemoration of the Silver Jubilee of Their Majesties. Sir, I am directed to refer to the Home Department Express letter No*F.72/7/34-Public, dated the 12th November 1934 (copy enclosed) on the above subject, and to say that the replies received thereto from the various local Governments and Administrations show that it is generally anticipated that the demand for the small size medals will be considerable but that there is no^likely to be a great demand for the large size medals. It has accordingly been arranged to have the ready large size medals consignod/made to the Calcutta Mint from the .Royal Mint and to mint the small size medals in India at the Calcutta mint. The Government of India have also decided that no change should be made in the designs already approved. 2* As regards the method of distribution of both medals for sale in India, it has been decided that all orders, both from individual purchasers and from the trade, should be addressed direct to the Calcutta Mint who will supply the medals direct to the purchasers by value payable post. The retail price at which ttie Calcutta Mint will sell the medals to individual purchasers will be Bs 14/- for the large size medal and te l/l2/- for the small size medal, inclusive of packing but exclusive of postage. Medals ordered by individual purchasers will be despatched so as to reach them in the first week of May. Trade —Trade discount will 'be allowed on whole-sale orders, details of viiich may he ascertained from the Master of the Mint, Calcutta, and Consignments to the trade will he despatched so as to rftach them in time for sale during the first week of May. 3&lt;&gt; I am to request that (with the permission of the Governor in Council) every effort may he made to advertise and push the sale of these medals hy issue of Press Communiques and any other means which appear suitable* A description of both Administrations in the first paragraph of the Home Department Bxpress letter alreadyleferred to, and I am to request that the widest publicity should he given to it together with the method of distribution outlined in paragraph 2 above. It should he emphasised that, in order to enable the Calcutta Mint to comply with the demand, it is essential that orders for the medals should he placed as early as possible. medals has already been furnished to local Governments and I have etc., Sfl/- K.G.Hallett, Secretary to the Govt, of India.Oopy of a confidential Express letter No,E.72/7/34-Public, dated l£tb November 1934, from the Government of India, Home Department, to all local Governments and Administrations. The High Commissioner has informed the Government of India that arrangements have been made for the issue next year by the Hoyal Mint, London, of a medal in commemoration of the 25th Anniversary of Their Majesties 1 reign. The medal will show on the obverse the Crowned Effigies of their Majesties, with the inscription 'immmmjmmm MGMX-MCMXXXV in HomarA Letters. As it has been found impossible to find any one emblem which could be considered representative of the Empire as a whole, it has been decided that the reverse shall show a view of Windsor Castle as the principal residence of the Hoyal House of Windsor. There will be no inscription upon this reverse. The medal will be issued .in two sizes. The large medal will have a diameter of St* and will be struck in standard silver. It will be available to the public in a leather case, at the price of 1 guinea per medal. The smaller medal will have a diameter of li* and will be struck in fine silver. It will be available to the public in a cardboard case at the price of 2s 6d. per medal. 2. This medal in commemoration of the Silver Jubilee will be entirely distinct from the medal which will be officially distributed at the time of the Silver Jubilee to members of the civil and Military services and to non-officials in recognition of public services, as was done at the time of the Delhi Durbar. This medal will be different in design from the commemoration medal which will be for sale. 3. It has been suggested tnat there will be a large demand for this medal, and the Government of India would be glad of the views of the local Government on this point and what demand they anticipate for (a) the larger or (b) the smaller medal. 4. It has been suggested further that if the demand is large, arrangements should be made to have copies of the dies supplied to the Government of India Mint, so that the medal can be struckstruck in India* If this were done, it would no doubt make sales of the medal easier than if medals c*i.:9 out from England and were sold through the ordinary trade chanrals* It is possible, however, that if the saleable medal becomes too common it mayhave the effect of cheapening the value of the official medal which as stated above will be awarded in recognition of public services* 5* A further question arises, if it is decided to mint the medals in India, whether India should use the designs already approved without alteration* It might oe possible to substitute an alternative design such as the Star of India on the reverses, but on the whole it appears preferable that the same medal should be sold in all parts of the British Empire.

Bahrain. / X Persian gulf 2Ist April 1935. Dear Cole, With reference to your letter D.0. 667-26/10 of 20th April. The arrangements suggested will suit Shaikh Hsmed but I think there should be an alteration in the times. It would be quite impossible to hold a Durbar in fifteen minutes. On these occasions there are always speeches and I think at the very least three quarters of an hour should be allowed for the Durbar. There is no mention of where the Shaikh is to take the salute, the Durbar will be held in the big hall of the school on the south of the tora, this building will accomodate several hundred people, and the nearest suitable site to this for a march past would be the Police Parade ground where such parades have taken place in the past. It would of course be possible to hold the durbar at the Palace in the Meglis which would hold about 60 people in which case it would be quite a small show but I think for this occasion the school would be more suitable. On these occasions the show starts by coffee and tea and as you can imagine this alone takes a long time to serve to a great crowd of people. Yours sincerelyD.O. Ho. -20/10. The 22nd April 1935.

You will see the watch is of rather an unusual pattern in so far as the dial consists of two separate sets of hands which enables one to keep the simultaneous times of two different countries. To set the hands, the bezel should be opened, when it will be seen that there are two small levers, one on either side of the dial. Bach of these should be pulled out in turn to operate the respective chapters and the small pin near the button should fet the same time be depressed and the hands then set. On the completion of this, the lever should be returned to its normal position. Please address all Communications to the Firm.Wife': BY APPOINTMENT TO H.M.THE KING TO H.R.H.

V-' Dear Sir, As you are aware, it has been decided that the collection of donations for the Silver Jubilee Fund should cease officially on the 31st May 1935. I am desired to request that every endeavour should be made to ensure very early transmission ultimately to the Honorary Treasurer of the Central Fund at New Delhi. No remittance should be made to the Honorary Secretary at Simla. 2. It is further the desire of the authorities of the Central Fund to receive, as soon after the 31st May 1935 as possible, duly audited accounts ot* the collections made by Provinces, Administrations and States and to close their own Central accounts and to get them audited and published as early as possible. I am to seek the co-operation of all local authorities in this matter. 3. With this object I have to request that, when your accounts of the collections made on behalf of the Fund are closed, the Honorary Treasurer of the Central Silver Jubilee Fund at New Delhi may kindly be furnished with two copies of a statement of account in the annexed form, supported by the necessary detailed statements and by a certificate of correctness recorded on the account itself by the auditor who may have been appointed by your committee to check your accounts. One copy should be supplied to the Honorary Secretary’s office at Simla. A statement should be appended to the account detailing any donations; which were promised or may be otherwise expected but were not received on the official date for closing the Fund, and conveying any remarks in regard to donations that your Committee may wish to make. Such donations may be received after the 31st May and, when received, will be creditable to the Fund. It is, however, very desiiable to expedite the collection of such sums as far as possible. In a separate statement should be detailed any special undertakings which may have been given by the authorities of the Central F'und as to the propor tion to be returned of any particular item or items in the collection. Relevant correspondence with the Central Fund should be quoted against each item. 4. I am further to request that an unaudited account, in the same form, showing, even though approximately and not quite completely, the state of your account as on Friday evening the 14th June 1935, should be sent to the Honorary Treasurer, New Delhi, on the 15th June 1935, with a copy to the Honorary Secretary, Simla. 5. When the audited accounts of all local authorities have been received and those of the Central Fund have been closed and audited, arrangements will be made as soon as possible to allocate and distribute at least 70 per cent, of the net proceeds of the Fund among the Provinces, Administrations and States. I am accordingly to ask that the probable date by which your audited statement of account, complete in all respects, is likely to be sent to the Honorary Treasurer may kindly be intimated very early to the Honorary Treasurer, New Delhi. realisation of all moneys by all those initially concerned and to expedite their6. Regarding States which are under the Administration of Local Governments, it is desired that copies of this letter be sent to them by the Local Government concerned and that they be asked kindly to comply with the requests contained in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 ante, addressing the Honorary' Treasurer, New Delhi, direct, forwarding a copy in each case to the under signed.

King G eorge V The f At Home* on 6 th April . Betails Authority jn \ \ By order of the Honourable the Political Resident all Political Agents were directed to invite all British (including British Indian subjects), and Americans and Europeans. A list of those actually invited is appended, and is the maximum number with which the Agency could compete. It is to be noted that it includes the clerical staff and families of the Agency, Mespers and the Bank. The arrangements for the 'At Home* were (a) Three large tables one each at the far end of the verandah and one at the Flagstaff corner. These were covered with large table cloths. Under each table was placed a bath containing blocks of ice bought from the Electric Company and Bapco. In each bath were placed beer - sodas - lemonades etcetera. On the tables glasses,Whisky, Sherry, Gin, v ermouth etcetera. Behind each table were two servants who served the drinks. Chairs and tables on which were light refreshments and cigarettes were placed the length of the verandahs inside and outside. (b) At 6.30 p.m. the officiating Political Agent invited every one to congregate in the Drawing room which had been cleared and offered the Toast of 'His Majesty The King Emperor 1 '. * This was followed by everyone present joining i/i 'God save the King'. People then mixed amongst themselves and there was dancing. Other than on the Dancing floor there was a noticeable failure of the two communities to mix.

I accepted. At about 11 p.m. Mr. Hollo asked me to propose *The King* at midnight. I said that I had come as a private guest to their Club which was more American than British and that I felt the proposed toast would come better from ■»* the President. It was arranged that Mr. Davies, the Resident Manager, should offer the toast. Captain Fisher, Senior Officer, Persian Gulf, suggested that I should reply by giving the toast of the President of the United States. I felt it was unsuitable for me to do so but told Captain Fisher that I had no objection to his doing so if he wanted to. Every thing was so informal that I did not think it would have mattered if any one had leapt to his feet and proposed this toast. After *The King* every one joined in singing ’God save the King* which every one knew. After the second toast some female voices started making a noise, which I was told was ’Star spangled Banner* which no one knew. was about a week before The first intimation I received of this When I receivedThe Bapco Club cordially invites you to a Jubilee JJance to be held in the New Camp Mess Hall on Sunday,May 5th, at 9:00 P.M* Dress Optional.s fst' i @r List of persons invite d on Sil ver_Jubi lee prepared from letters of acknowledgme nts. which are av ailable_in_the off ice.

He agrees about the Darbar and thinks that it would be a excellent thing to combine the rejoicings and the investiture. About feeding the poor, camels maice a filling meal and I think that we should give some 50 to 100 bags of rice. If there is to be free food people will come from all over the island.

You would perhaps like to eha amplify your note dated the 11th May 1935 (page 134) on Jubilee dance in the light of the last two lines of P^A’s immediately preceding note.The following ideas were put forward by t. Officiating Political on 16th ray 1936:- (i) It is impossible to save money for the festivities out of this year’s funds, as any surplus will have to be surrendered before the Coronation. (ii) It is the Shaikh’s job to feed the poor. Two feedings are required (a) of cooked rice for the able bodied poor, (b) oi card i -~o, to which destitute women or the infirm can send a &gt; 5 oy. The Municipality may be asked to arrange feeding centres and persons in charge. (iii) Fireworks are very expensive, but Government of India might contribute a sum for fireworks, any surplus from which might be devoted to other purposes. Illumination of the Agency or the ’’Promenade 1 ’ might be possible. (iv) If the TTavy will assist with searchlights and in a stayed battle, a tattoo might be held. Other items might include The Bahrain Police (band and any other display), the Shaikh s camels (?? musical fide), the Scouts, the Navy (?P.T. display). (v) A procession of cars I la Fre^h Ml - Careme festivities, representing the various aspects of Bahrain life. (vi) Athletic sports might be organized * by the schools, including some events for men.

Invitations were sent to Shaikh Hamad bin `Isa Al Khalifa, the British and American communities, merchants and notables of Bahrain. The Political Agent in Bahrain sent letters to the rulers of the Trucial Coast to inform them about the celebration taking place and to suggest that the same celebration should take place in their areas. Letters of congratulation were sent by a few Gulf rulers including Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim Al Thani, Shaikh Hamad bin `Isa Al Khalifa and Shaikh Sultan Bin Saqr al-Qasimi to congratulate The King on the occasion.The correspondence is mainly between Their Majesties’ Silver Jubilee Fund, the Political Agencies and Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, Shaikh Hamad bin `Isa Al Khalifa, and the Under Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Fundraising</topic></subject><subject><topic>Royal jubilees</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00019a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
