On further consideration it seemed preferable to raise the point taken by him with the Government of India in general terms, rather than on the specific instance of the reduction of the Sultan of Muscat's allowance, which presented rather special features. The general point is one which was emphasised by Sir Denys Bray himself as Foreign Secretary (more particularly in regard to Bahrein), and which will no doubt be fully present to the Government of India, But it is perhaps desirable to emphasise the case for keeping the activities of our agents so far as possible in the background, at any rate in present conditions, so far as the nature of the problems presented to them renders this practicable. I suggest a draft. It is perhaps unnecessary to enter into any great detail. U * ^P.Z. 1726/31. &gt;raft Paper. Department. A -Adae&amp;on,' K C.-I.E., I.C.S., oreign Secretary to the Government of India, NEW DELHI. In connection with recent policy in regard to Muscat - for instance, the action taken to secure Thomas’s replacement - the suggestion has neen made here that it is desirable that we should not relax our efforts to transfer more UaiU 20361 and more responsibility to the the native authorities themselves at Muscat and in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. 2. We do not lose sight of the fact that these States present rather special difficulties in this respect, more particularly in preseni circumstances. At Muscat we have ai| c absentee Sultan, and such stability as the State possesses is very largely due to our immediate financial assistance and the t military backing which might be looked for from us were internal affairs to take a serious turn. In Bahrein equally the Government of India, in the light of the recommendations put forward by Barrett and by the present Political Resident, have reached the conclusion] which has been accepted by His Ihjesty’s Government, that, more especially in view of the possibility/\ •raft a X f „ development of the possibility of a de.ei .

In these circumstances, the opportunities for further development of local responsibility are not very large, but we feel confident that the Government of India will continue to bear in mind the desirability of screening our own effective control o these little States|so far as is possible consistently with securing the essentials of our policyjjand^wherevejr practicable keeping-H.M.G. and the Liil U J&lt;L} r j' ^ G. of I v m the background a&amp;d making the/ f pVW , flA a^JL i 55•raft Paper. i &amp;V.X If- ^ vi 55 Department the authorities of the States therselves the ostensible sources of action.Then explorers rarely make good administrators. (It f s unfortunate we should so osterikitiously run Muscat: the Sultan wanted to keep Thomas: we refused.

Seen Political Committee. 5th March 1931. Mr. Walton . J.C.W. 6.3.31. Under Secretary of State, To see Sir Denys Bray’s note of 4th March below, regarding Mr. Thomas. We were not consulted, nor presumably were the Colonial Office, before the despatch of the King’s message of congratulations. The initiative may possibly have come from Sir A. Wilson, but His Majesty met Mr. Thomas in connection with the Sultan of Muscat’s visit and may well spontaneously have thought his achievement of sufficient distinction to merit some recognition. The position in Muscat is a little difficult. The Sultan is an independent ruler in name. In fact he survives only because we help him financially, and because our military backing is available for him in the last resort. But for this the State must have gone /gone under in 1915 if not long before. It is inevitable in these circumstances, that we should exercise a very definite influence in the State, and this is more particularly the case as the Sultan is an absentee ruler who can only with great difficulty be persuaded to visit his Dominions at all. Our task should be greatly eased if the Heir Apparent, on succession, proves to have the makings of a competent Sultan, when it will be possible for us to retire to a greater degree into the background. We have a certain responsibility to the Sultan and to the State for the behaviour of Mr. Thomas, who was appointed on our recommendation, and it would hardly have been possible for us, once we realised that he was not pulling his weight, to leave the Sultan and the Council in ignorance of the fact or encourage his re-employment. I do not think the Resident proposes to cut into leave which he has actually earned or, indeed, that he contemplates more than an appeal to Mr. Thomas to sacrifice some of the furlough to which he is entitled under his contract? He recognises, in fact, that the fact that Mr. Thomas is not a Government official makes it impossible to do more. (Signed) J.G. LAITHWAITE. 6.3.31. Seen Political Committee. 11th March 1931. I didn*t mean to be seriously critical or controversial and I agree, of course, with Mr. Laithwaite’s note. But the position in Muscat and other Arab States /States needs watching. If we are to turn them into Indian States (and more alsol) let us do it with our eyes open, weighing the consequences and remembering that the conduct of India’s foreign affairs will inevitably be affected by the Reforms and that political India will not be the more disposed to finance or take up existing foreign burdens if they look anti-Moslem or anti-Arab or Imperialistic. There seem to be large issues in the background, and meanwhile caution suggests that we should not relax our efforts to foist more and more responsibility back on to the Council at Muscat and the Sheik at Bahrein, etc. - at least in appearance. (Initialled) D.B. 11.3.31. Mr* Walton . J.C.W. 12.3.31. Mr. tfakely, L.D.W. 13.3.31. To see. We can emphasise the desirability of leaving the appearance of control with the State in approving (if F.O. concur) the latest proposals about the Sultan of Muscat’s allowancej and bear the point in mind in case there is opportunity to make it in connection with Bahrein.
