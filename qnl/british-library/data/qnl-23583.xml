H. B. M*s Political Agent, Bahrain. * Memorandum: - No Reference your memorandum No.2226 dated 30th 1945. The Bahrain Government would not object to Messrs. Holloway Brothers, who built the Shaikh Hamad Bridge, obtaining maps of Bahrain from the military authorities with a view of building a repair dock. This firm made a survey of the sea between Manama and Muharraq before building the bridge and are presumably already in possession of a good deal of information about that area. Last winter an officer of the I.W.T. visited me and asked if His Highness f s boat house, on the edge of the Muharraq side of the causeway, could be hired as a workshop for repairing I.W.T. craft. He was told that this would not be possible. About the same time enquiries were made from the State Engineer about the possibility of electric power for use in a repair workshop which it was proposed should be set up in a hired building somewhere on the south shore of Muharraq town. The Manager of Gray, Mackenzie now informs me that it is his firm who are interested in the matter but before taking any action they wished to obtain advice from an expert in Baghdad who be longs to the firm of Holloway Bros. This engineer is coming to Bahrain shortly and has apparently asked the Embassy in Baghdad to enable him to obtain maps. The shore and much of the sea between the causeway and the Quarantine is privately owned so any scheme for building a slip way and a workshop would depend upon the willingness of the owners of the property to sell or let their ground. I gather that nothing in the nature of a dock is contemplated but what is required is a slipway and workshop. Adviser to the Government.Telegram G.T.C. From Political Agent, Bahrain.
