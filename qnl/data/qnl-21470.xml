It also requests information on the monthly output of the Bushire mines. Two enclosures:1. A copy of a letter from Edward Hutchins Bellasis, Secretary to the Military Board to Francis Warden, Chief Secretary to the Government, Bombay, dated 20 July 1815. The letter is forwarding a report from James Inverarity concerning the quality of sulphur obtained from Bushire (see enclosure 2 below). It notes that the board cannot provide a recommendation until it receives a further report from Mr Bruce concerning the output of the mines at Bushire, and therefore recommends that sulphur is obtained via the other presidencies in the meantime.2. A copy of a letter from James Inverarity, Agent for Gunpowder, Bombay to Captain Edward Hutchins Bellasis, Secretary to the Military Board, dated 19 July 1815. The letter reports that the last batch of sulphur received from Bushire was of lower quality and more expensive than previous consignments dispatched from that port.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024052054.0x000047#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
