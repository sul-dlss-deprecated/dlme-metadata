The report furnished by the Officiating Political Ag-ent at Muscat on the political affairs of that State forms Part II ot this Administra tion Report. The year was marked by many tribal affrays in different parts of 'Oman; but, although rumours were frequent of intended rebellions against Seyyid Toorkee, Muscat itself remained unmolested, and the apprehensions which existed have been for the time at least dispelled. The Civil Surgeon, Dr. Jayakar, has furnished tables showing results of meteorological observations taken at Muscat during the last five years. These will be found in Appendix A to Part II. 2. Piuate Coast. No changes have occurred in the governments of the trucial ports, and the various chiefs have continued to respect their engagements to Government. Peace was maintained by land as well as on the sea, and the present native agent, Haji Abul Kasim, performed his duties much to my satisfaction. In the previous year's report, reference was made to the dispute between the Chief of Shargah and his feudatories at Fajeyrah. This quarrel was eventually terminated in October, to the satisfaction of all concerned. Shaikh Hamed-bin-Abdullah, of Fajeyrah, made his sub mission to Shaikh Salim, Chief of Shargah, - and agreed to pay the customary tribute on account of date plantations. In return all past offences were forgiven, and Shaikh Hamed allowed to retain the Gov ernorship of Fajeyrah. In December Shaikh Hamed-bin-Abdullah, Chief of Umm-el- Kawain, appointed the Chief of 'Ejman to proceed as his agent to Ras- el-Khaimah for the purpose of divorcing his wife, who is sister of the Ras- el-Khaimah Chief. It appears that when the marriage was contracted, it was stipulated that the lady should continue to reside at Ras-el- Khaimah, and that her husband should spend a portion of the year with her at that place. Quarrels arose out of this arrangement, as might have been anticipated, and these disputes have not terminated with the divorce. As fresh wranglings occurred about the disposal of certain ornaments, &amp;c., this has led to a feud between Umm-el-Kawain and Ras-el-Khaimah, the first result of which was an affray at Ramss, a dependency of Ras-el-Khaimah. The assailants were the crews of seven boats belonging to Umm-el-Kawain. and these severely beat the crew of a Ras-el-Khaimah fishing boat. On inquiry it appeared that the Umm- el-Kawain boats had gone with an intention of seeking a quarrel, and that the Chief of Umm-el-Kawain was aware of this. I therefore4 administration report op the pepsian gulp political thought it necessary to inflict a fine and administer a caution. Hosti lities by land were inevitable between Umm-el-Kawain and Ras-el- Khaimah, and have already commenced. Shargah sides with and aids Ras-el-Khaimah. Peaceful relations have been established between the Chief of Abu- Zhabee and Shaikh Jasim-bin-Mohammed-bin-Thanee of El-Bida^a. 3. Bahrain. The islands of Bahrain have again enjoyed tranquillity. In August Shaikh Ahmed-bin-Ali, brother of the Chief of Bahrain, espoused a daughter of their enemy Nasir-bin-Mubarik, but it appears that no political significance attaches to this event. In December Shaikh Ahmed-bin-Ali proceeded with a numerous following to El-Katr, where he had a meeting with Shaikh Jasim-bin- Mohammed-bin-Thanee, and amicable relations were established between the Shaikh of El-Bida'a and the Chiefs of Bahrain. 4. Nejd, El-Hasa, El-Katr, Nejd and El-Hasa have remained undisturbed. The Ameer Abdullah- bin-Feysal resides at Riadh, and his nephews, who continue to be on good terms with him, live in Khorj. The Governor of El-Hasa, Saeed Pasha, desired to induce the Shaikhs of the Ajman tribe to return to the province, but was unsuccessful. Ihe now celebrated Beni Hajir robber-leader, Zaeed-bin-jVIohammed- bin-Zaeed, is still at large, and has not been wholly inactive, though happily his depredations by sea have not been so serious as might have been expected, lu May he made an unsuccessful attempt to seize some boats belonging to the 'Ameyr tribe. In October Zaeed-bin-Mohammed committed some petty piracies near El-Kateef, and one Rashid-el- Romeyhee, a Bahrain subject, was seized and plundered on the sea. Later, the Beni Hajir robbers attacked a vessel of the 'Ameyr and killed two men. Some vessels were sent with armed men ostensibly in puisuit, but from their procedure in beating tomtoms, and making as much noise as possible, this appeared to be a mere demonstration. Although the Beni Hajir leaders have frequented the immediate neigh bourhood of El-Kateef, no real steps have been taken to secure 3 or punish them, • El-Kati. In April a body of the 'Ajman Bedouins, under Fellah- bm-Raukan, raided El-Katr and carried off about 450 camels. Shaikh Jasim appealed both to the Governor of El-Hasa and to the Chief of the Ajman, but failed to get redress. t ••r In /une Rashid-bin-Jabir and Nasir-bin-Jabir Shaikhs, of the Naeem tribe of El-Katr, settled at Eoweyrat, and agreed to protect the Al-Boo Kuwarah against Jasim. In October Jasim-bin-Mohammed-bin-Thanee Shaikh, of El-Bida'a, commenced annoying the Indian traders residing there in various ways, and Her Majesty's ship Woodlarh was despatched to the spot. It was seen that Jasim s object was to get rid of all the Indian traders : their dealings in pearls interfering with his own profits in the same trade. A temporary anangement was come to, pending reference to Governmentresidency and muscat political agency for 1881-82. 5 as to the mode of procedure in dealing- on such occasions with the Chief of El-Bida'a. Shaikh Jasim, in December, professed to be in much dread of an attack by the Beni Yas, of Abu Zhabee, but eventually he came to a friendly understanding with Shaikh Zaeed-bin-Khaleefah. 5. Southern Persia and Persian Biluchistan. Arahhtan. —The important event of the year was the death of Haji Jabir Khan Nusrut-ul-Mulk, Governor of Mohammerah, which occurred in October. Mohammerah was founded by Shaikh Mardao, of the Muheysin branch of the Ka^ab Arabs, the father of Haji Jabir Khan, at a time when the district belonged to Turkey. The late chief was a man of remark able ability, and played his difficult part up to the last with much tact and success. Haji Jabir has left two sous, Mohammed and Mizal. The latter (the younger) is considered the abler, and is at present administering the government of the district; whilst his elder brother has proceeded to Ispahan, either to be kept out of the way or in furtherance of some intrigue. No disturbances ensued on the death of Haji Jabir. The province of Arabistan has remained under His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Suitan, who first appointed Ameerzadah Abdullah Mirzah (jovernor in place of Jaffer Koolee Khan, and subsequently the Ihtisham-es-Saltan- ah, whose name is Khan Lar Khan Mirza, received this appointment. During the autumn. Shaikh Rahmah was appointed Governor of Felahiah; Meer Abdullah, of Deh Moolah; and Moolah Mutallib, of Hawezza. French commercial agents appeared at Mohammerah, and displayed activity in establishing a footing. A consignment of breech-loading rifles and ammunition imported by the French was temporarily taken possession of by the local authorities, but the arms were subsequently returned and sold at very low prices. The River Karoon and the &lt;c bund ' of Ahwaz have been examined recently by English, French, and Persian officers, but as yet navigation of that river is unopened. Pars [Shiraz and interior districts) ,• —The government of Fars has remained in the hands of His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan. In June the newly-appointed Governor of Shiraz, the u Sahib-i- Diwan/' arrived there, accompanied by the young Jelal-ed-Dowlah, son of the Zil-es-Sultan. The Kowwam-ul-Mulk retained the government of the districts he had last year, with Gaobandee added; and his brother Nasseer-ul-Mulk obtained the Behbehan and Mamasannee districts in addition to Bunder Abbass and Lingah. Mirzah Hoosain Khan, son of the Sahib-i-Diwan, obtained the districts of Neyriz, Istabanat, and Bowanat. Haji Mirza Aga Khan, wakeel, and his brother, Fazl Ali Khan, got Kazeroon, Khisht, and Komarej; and Mirza Ahmed Khan Mu'eed-ul-Mulk, son-in-law and nephew of the Sahib-i-Diwan, Jehroom, Keer, Karzeen, and Gillahdar. Hie foreign Office Agent of Shiraz, Mirza Sadik Khan, was replaced by Mohammed Takee Khan. Hie Kel Khanee, Sultan Mohammed Khan, and Haji Nasroolah Khan Sirteep, Eel Begee, were appointed to the superintendence of the Kash- Kai Eels. In the summer, one Seyyid Ali Akbar commenced persecuting6 administration report of the peesian gulf political the Jews of Sbiraz, beating them, cutting off their hair, &amp;c.; and a general massacre was even threatened. The Zil-es-Sultan, however, put a stop to these proceedings for the time. Bushire. —Haji Mohammed Baker Khan having vacated the govern ment of Bushire, was succeeded by the Motemid-es-Sultan, Mirza Mohammed Khan Mustowfi Nizam. In the interim, between the de parture of the late and the arrival of the new Governor, Mirza Ali Akbar Khan, Foreign Office Agent, took charge of Busbire, and proved so mis chievously obstructive that, at the instance of Her Majesty's Minister, he was recalled. His successor is Haji Mirza Abdullah Khan, the Foreign Office Agent for Bunder Abbass. In the last report mention was made of a special agent deputed from Teheran to arrange about British claims against a fraudulent defaulter. This agent, Mirza Moosa Khan, continued to protract his stay to a period of 16 months, during which he lived on the debtor, and it appeared that he was chiefly concerned in the interests of the latter. Another case of swindling English merchants, in which the culprit is an Armenian, occupied considerable attention. In both these cases the culprits have been suflered to escape from custody. In August information was received of the sale of some Indian lads in Shiraz by Persian horse-dealers, and the matter was represented to Her Majesty's Minister, by whose action one of the lads has been recovered and some of the culprits punished. Mohammed Khan, Chief of Dashtee, died in June at Bushire, where he was in close imprisonment for alleged arrears of revenue. A nephew, named Jamal Khan, son of Hyder Khan, succeeds to the charge of Dashtee. Lingak. —Shaikh Yoosuf has continued to hold the post of Deputy Governor of Lingah. Towards the end of the official year (March), it was reported that Lingah was separated from the Government of Pars and made over to the Ameen-es-Sultan at Teheran. It appears that the customs of Lingah, as well as Bunder Abbass and Bushire, have been farmed by the Ameen-es-Sultan, but it is denied by the highest author ity that the Governments of Lingah and Bunder Abbass have been withdrawn from the Zil-es-Sultan. However, the Nusseer-ul-Mulk has lost these places, and it has not transpired with whom the real authority rests. Bunder Abbass. —The arrangements for the administration of Bunder Abbass have been of late unsatisfactory. The Chief of Kishm, Shaikh Suggur, died, and has been succeeded by his nephew. Shaikh Hasan-bin-Mohammed. Persian Biluchistan. —A summary of leading events in this district has been furnished by the Deputy Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, in political charge of Mekran Coast. The Chief of Dashtyaree has since been reinstated, and Sirdar Ibra him Khan, Governor of Bampoor, has been deposed by the Persian Gov ernment at the instance of Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran. A Persian Commission has been despatched to Charbar to inquire into the various complaints. Summary: Stolen camels. —No new cases of camel theft occurred during the year under review on the Gwadur Jask division of the land line; and no cases reported in last resume have as yet been settled, not-residency and muscat political agency fou 1881-82. withstanding iiirreJ the numerous reminders sent to the chiefs and their re iterated promises of co-operation. Rinds. —The Rinds have given no cause for complaint. Damage to line. —The following damages are reported between March 1881 and April 1882 :— In Mir Hoti's territory, damage to the value of Rs. 37. In Mir KheiVs territory, damage to the value of Rs. 6. Subsidies. —Rs. 20 was deducted from Mir Hoti's subsidy for half- year ending December 31st, 1881, on account of damage done to line. Charhar : Change of Government. —On the 28th December 1881, Abdul lah Khan appointed Wali of Charbar, vice Deen Mohammed, removed. Complaint against Wali Abdullah Khan. —On the 23rd March the British traders in a body submitted a verbal complaint to the Clerk in charge Charbar, to the effect that Wali Abdullah was becoming very offensive in his manners towards traders, as also towards the inhabitants. His demands upon customs and other dues are becoming exorbitant. The traders express themselves willing to pay dues at the rate of custom rules enforced by Deen Mohammed and others; but Wali Ab dullah expresses his intention of enforcing his own measures. He is, moreover, abusive and disagreeable; robberies in and about Charbar are very frequent, and there appears to be no security for property, as Wali does not exert himself in tracing stolen property or punishing offenders. Gungadass Fakir, robbery and murder of. —W r ith reference to this case, reported in my No. 13, dated 6th January 1882, a letter was received from Sirdar Hussain Khan, dated 12th March ] 882, in which he says that the fakirs went to Deezuck, where they purchased a camel; that they were accompanied by Deezuck men; that they never reached his district, their property being looted in Deezuck. Complaints against Sirdar Mir Hussain Khan. —The complaints against Sirdar Mir Hussain Khan by the merchants of Charbar and Dashtyaree, accusing him of plundering their property, I have received a reply from him dated 12th March 1882, in which he attempts (but I think unsuc cessfully) to clear himself; his letter contains little except reiterated assertions of his own honesty, and vaguely imputes untrustworthiness to those who brought the charges against him. lakir Nanuk Govind Shah : Theft of his property. —This case still remains unsettled, awaiting further information from Mir Hussain Khan. Sepoys' quarters at J ash. —These buildings were taken over by the Public Works Department during the year under review. Band AH case. —On the 8th August 1881, as Band Ali refused to support prisoner any longer, latter was released by the VYali of Gwadur, by order of Seyyid Toorkee, Sultan of Muscat. Naval. Her Majesty's ship Beacon left the station in May, and Her Majesty's ship Banger took her place, but was removed in October and Beady rejoin ed.'

ROSS, Lieut.-Colonel, Resident, Persian Uulf.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1881-82. PAET II. ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1881-82. Political. —During the official year 1881-82, there have been many rumours and alarms of hostile tribal coalitions tor the purpose of invad ing Muscat and overthrowing Seyyed Toorkee, who at the latter part ot the year became seriously alive to the danger, and repaired and fortified his defences in order to be prepared to meet an attack. Fortunately, owing to dissensions among the leaders of the tribes, the coalition fell to pieces. There have been more than the usual amount of intertribal quarrels, which have kept the country in a disturbed state. 2. In April there was a struggle in Jaalan between the two power ful tribes, Beni-boo-Ali and Beni-boo-Hassan, in which the former were defeated, owing to their being greatly outnumbered and taken by sur prise. They lost 20 men, and the Beni-boo-Hassan 17. When the news of the encounter reached Muscat, His Highness Seyyid Toorkee despatch ed Seyy id-bin-Hamad-bin-Hamad on a mission to Jaalan to mediate between them j he succeeded in effecting a two months truce. Ihis truce, although considered unfavourable to the Beni-boo-Ali, was only accepted by them out of deference to His Highness the Sultan. 3. In May the Belooch garrison of El-Eineen, finding that they could not hold the fort against the attacks of the Beni Ghatir, who had besieged it, offered to give it up to the Beni All of Yinkal, belonging to the Hinawi faction, and the offer was gladly accepted. The Beni Ghafir upon this formed an alliance with various Ghafiree tribes, in order to oppose the Beni All and prevent the retention of the fort by the Hinawis. Several desultory engagements ensued, resulting in consider able loss of life on both sides. The struggle for possession of the fort at last terminated about the end of June, by the garrison making a vigorous and successful sortie against the besiegers, who, being beaten and dis persed, finally abandoned the siege and returned to their homes. Fifty- two men were killed in this action. 4. About this time (June) the Ibryieen and Beni Ryam disputed for the possession of the Fort El-Awabi ; the dispute arose from the fact that Shaikh Salim-bin-Budr when a refugee, with the Beni Ryam, pro mised to hand over this fort to them, should he ever have an opportu nity of doing so ; this pledge he subsequently repudiated. The matter was finally settled by the fort being handed over to His Highness Seyyid Toorkee, who assumed nominal possession of it, though it is still garrison ed by the Ibryieen. There was a dispute in the Balineh between the Howasineh and the Beni Katab, which resulted in the former beiu&lt; ousted. 5. In June the garrison of the fort of El-Awabi, consisting of about 60 men, made a sortie into the Wadi Rostak, where they attacked the Beni Ghafir and killed five of them at a place called Sohtany. A conflict was also reported to have occurred between the Beni Omar and the El-Howasineh at Islat, in Batineh.14 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL 6. The two months^ truce between the Beni-boo-Ali and the Beni- boo-Hassan havin' 1 expired^ the former, having given the stipulated five days' notice, attacked the latter at Jowabi-el-Khoweyseh. The loss of life in this action was heavy, the Beni-boo-Ali losing 60 men, and the Beni-boo-Hassan 75. The Beni-boo-Hassan were completely routed and dispersed, and took refuge in the tower called Buiz-el-Khoweyseh. The numbers engaged on both sides were not exactly known, but it appears that the Beni boo-Ali were aided by the Jenebeh, Beni Easid, and Hishim tribes, whilst the Beni-boo-Hassan fought alone. 7. At the commencement of July, an increased tax, or octroi of 5 per cent., was established by His Highness Seyyid Toorkee on all produce arriving from the interior. The former tax on the various articles of pro duce varied from about 11 to per cent., and was included in the general lease granted to the farmer of customs. The increased tax was purchased for the year for $15,000. His Highness Seyyid Toorkee was strongly dis suaded by Seyyid Hilal-bin-Ahmed and other influential persons in Mus cat fiom establishing this tax, and was advised to reduce his expenditure rather than exasperate the tribes by an increased tax on their goods. His Highness, who was in great want of money, did not take this advice, but carried out his plans. 8. In July Shaikh Suleiman-bin-Saeed was murdered at Seheleh by the Beni Saeed, and a few days after a servant of His Highness was killed by a party of the Beni Naeen; the object of both these murders was political, as both the tribes were on bad terms with His Highness and were threatening to attack Sohar • but on the arrival of Hisllighness's yacht I)ar-el-Salam at that port with stores and ammunitions 0 for the garrison, they abandoned their design. 9. The marriage of Seyyid Feysel, the second son of the Sultan, with his cousin Ale_\eh, the daughter of the late Seyyid Thoweynee, was celebrated on the 6th August, and on the 15th idem His Highness enter tained all Europeans at dinner in honour of the event. On the 22nd of August, His Highness Seyyid Toorkee proceeded in Her Majesty's ship Woodlark to Gwadar for change of air. 10. From July to September disquieting rumours prevailed regard ing a coalition of the tribes under Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali against Muscat, but owing to disagreements amongst the leaders it all felfthrough. His Highness Seyyid Toorkee returned from Gwadar on 19th September. 11 'u 0 x? 2 t t , h ? e i ob .f news arrived that the fort of Nakal had been taken by the Theel-Zanbeh. His Highness Seyyid Toorkee left for Bur- ka immediately, with the intention of collecting a force to re-capture it ■ but on his arrival there he found that, through the mediation of Mahom- ed-bm-Zenanee Shaikh, of the Beni Hadram tribe, the enemy had with- drawn on receiving $500. His Highness paid this sum, and after mak ing some presents to the headmen of Nakal returned to Muscat on 1st November. From 2nd to 7th November His Highness the Sultan was ill, and was constantly attended by the Civil Surgeon, Dr. Jayakar. 12. On the evening of 25th November a Banian was assassinated in the streets of M uttra, and the murderer escaped. Suspicion fell on the \\ ahabee garnson, but the Sultaa has entirely failed to trace the murderer.flICil J ^ U 'Pilate^L v )We yseli. \ ' ^ ap^ 11 ^idj aii M octroi of 5 01 allproitej nicies of pro. tlieKeieral waspurcM sstrongljiij.

In January news arrived from the interior that a formidable co alition had been formed between Abdul Aziz, Saleh-bin-Ali, Ibrahim-bin- Khais, and Hamood-el-Wahibeh, for the purpose of invading Muscat and Muttra. The plan of operations proposed was, that whilst Abdul Aziz and Saleh-bin-Ali marched on Muscat or Muttra, Ibrahim-bin- Khais should raid the Balineh, and Hamood-el-Wahibeh should attack Soor. On hearing this report, His Highness Seyyid Toorkee repaired the defences of Muttra and superintended the work in person. At the same time Abdul Aziz sent a letter to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, informing him of his intention of marching on Muscat, and ex pressing his hope that if the British Government would not assist him, they would at least remain neutral. He gave as his reasons for attack ing Muscat, the general disorder prevailing in the country, owing to the weakness of Seyyid Toorkee's rule. To the above letter the Political Resident replied, that as friendly relations had exsisted so long between Seyyid Toorkee and the Government, it would be against the wishes of Government for Seyyid Toorkee to be molested. It is probably owing to this reply that the coalition collapsed. 14. On the morning of 12th March, news arrived that Ibrahim-bin- Khais had taken Mesnah by surprise the night before, after killing three of the garrison. British subjects were not molested in any way, and Ibrahim-bin-Kbais wrote to the Political Agent at Muscat, inform ing him of the capture of Mesnah and of his intention to protect Brit ish subjects and their property. On 24th March, His Highness Seyyid Toorkee officially informed the Political Agent of his intention to pro ceed in person with an armed force to Burka, for the purpose of re-taking Mesnah; and he requested that Her Majesty's ship Ready should be sent there, to warn all British subjects to leave the place with their property. This was done, and Her Majesty's ship Beady returned on 27th March. 15. This ends the report for the official year 1881-82; but in conclu sion it may be added that His Highness was completely successful in re-taking Mesnah, and has thus restored his prestige in 'Oman. Owing to His Highness' success and the moral support offered by the presence at Mesnah and other ports of Her Majesty's ships, there is every reason to believe that the present year will be one of unusual tranquillity. Official changes. —On 15th August Major Grant arrived here, and took over charge the same day from Lieutenant-Colonel S. B. Miles, who proceeded to Zanzibar. Slave Trade. —During the year under review three slave dhows were brought in by Her Majesty's ship Dryad, who had captured them off the southern coast of Arabia. Two were released, and one, with seven slaves on board, was condemned. The nett proceeds of the sale, which amounted to Rs. 1,608-1-6, was paid into the Treasury at Muscat. The slaves were sent to Bombay, and the full proceedings were transmitted to the Admiralty Court, London.

REPORT ON TRADE OF PERSIAN GULP FOR 1881. The import and export trade of South Persia was remarkably- dull during the first months of 1881, the impoverishment of the popu lation from the partial failure of the 1879-80 harvest continuing to be felt. The subsequent harvest was, however, comparatively plentiful, and the effect was an increase in exports and imports. Piece-goods and copper from Great Britain and India, and sugar from France and Batavia, found good markets on the coast and in the interior. Several prominent Persian merchants failed during the year, partly from the results of previous year's over-trading, and partly from the depreciation of opium in China. The Persian opium especially is said to be in bad repute, owing to extensive adulteration of the drug. Shipping and carrying facilities have greatly increased, and freights have accordingly fallen. There are now three distinct lines of steamers between Europe and the Persian Gulf, and two lines between India and the Gulf. A company is further about to run small steamers to all the ports of the Persian and Arabian coasts of the Gulf, E. C.

The accompanying returns show the statistics of trade of Muscat during the past year as far as they can be gathered. They compare favourably with those of the preceding year, and whilst there is a re markable falling off in the imports from India, this decrease is more than counterbalanced by the increase of imports from the Persian Gulf, Basrah, and Mekran Coast. In this great increase Basrah takes the largest share, as, owing to the abundant harvest in Mesopotamia, the cereals from that port have flowed into Muscat in unusually large quan tities. In cotton cloth the importation has remarkably improved, having more than doubled; but the improvement is owing to consignments from America, which are increasing yearly. There has been a very considerable falling off in the export of dates, which is the chief article of exportation, owing to the scanty harvest gathered last year. The annual lease of the Muscat Custom-house has been sold to Sett Katao Bhimjee for $ 1,25,000. CHARLES GRANT, Major, 11. B. M.'s 'Political Agent and Consul, Muscat.
