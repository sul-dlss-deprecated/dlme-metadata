Miles during his visit there in 1875. No. 152 of 1876. 47 Having arrive*d at Sonar on the 1 6th November 1875 and visited the Governor Seyyid Bedr bin Seif A1 Bu Saidi, I requested him to be good enough to arrange Tor my visit to El Bereymi and Sheikh Hasnid bin Hamad, with whom I was personally acquainted and who is a man of considerable influence in El Dhahireh having been at one time Governor of El Bereymi was selected to ac company me. I could however only promise myself a hasty visit as my arrangement with Captain Clayton H.M.S.’'Ri fleman” who had kindly given me a passage was to meet again at Sohar on the 22nd. The Sheikh’s preparations as regards camels etc. w ere no t completed until the next mor..ing at i 0 a.m. when w© started with nine matchlocks of the Naim and Mokabil tribes and reached^about thirty miles by night fall encamping for tne night at Saheelah a village in the Eady Jezze belonging to the El Kunud. The road after leaving the belt of palm groves and cultivation outside Sonar ran N/v. for an hour to *Auhy a little patch of date groves and gardens irrigated by a felej and then turned vest over a stony gradually rising plain covered with thin acacia jungle and underwood towards the hills. The E'ady Jezze wnich we come to soon after is here nei ther broad nor deep being but a few inches lower than the plain and barely distinguishable from it showing that no great torrent ever ruches down it but that after rainfall which in Oman is rarely heavy the water that is ii not absorbed by cultivation is sucked in by the porous soilsoil on the ^ay. Another hour brings us to the site of an ancient ruined town attested by heaps of fragments of black rock lying in squares and ovals which mark the foundations of houses and by parts of ruined walls and towers on adjoining hillocks covering altogether a con siderable extent of ground, ^rum the appearance of the foundations the houses must have been on a small scale and of rude construction. No vestige of any edifice of architectural pretensions remains. At the present aay the location is uninhabited and a place of more dreary and complete desolation I nave rarely seen. My compan ions could not tell me the name of the site; their only traditional knowledge was that it oelonged to the Per sians in the time of Ignorance and tnat it was destroyed by God on account of the refusal of the inhabitants to embrace the blessed truths of Islam. A little further is a dried up felej or Kanat leading from the hills called Felej el Sook and also ascribed to tne Persians. At 2:30 p.m. we came in sight of Sehlat a village x^ixVuresquely situate on the top of a hill and Jiaving at a distance a somewhat imposing appearance though a closer view dispelled the illusion. It belongs to the Bani Gheith a petty Hinawi tribe subordinate however to the Naim. Here w e rested for a sho short time while the camels were fed. The next village we come to an hour later is Mileyyeneh and our road henceforth lies in the bed of the ^ady Jezze as far as Hail, for we have now reached the foot of the hill range and commence a more steep and winding ascent. Just below Mileyyeneh where the 'ady narrows considerably is an arched aqueduct of solid masonry that supplies a village called FI Ghorak belonging to the Bani Gheith. I could learn nothing precise about this aqueduct which is evi dently of very ancient construction from the Sheikh, the tradition as usual being limited to the fact of its havingbeen constructed by the Kcifirs before Islam. Here w e ^ere overtaken by a heavy thunder storm ^hich soon drenched us through and made the rocky too slippery for the camels to venture out of a walk; the si^Ht, however, was very ^rand from the picturesque scenery around us - the dark blue hills of the background streak ed by deepest black ravines and ^or^es and with ridfcje upon ridt,e of lower hills in front bein^ lighted up here and there by the rays of the sun now near setting glancing through a rent in the dark heavy masses of clouds above us and showing strange contrast of li&amp;ht and shade. It was some time after dark when we reached the groves of the little village of Saheelah and here the Arabs having lost the path, nearly brought us to grief among the water channels and low walls of the plantations we were fain to wait for a villager to light us with a torch to our camping ground. This pl&amp;ce belongs to the El Kunud and has two small towers for defence. The next day starting soon after sunrise we pushed on more rapidly and reached El Bereymi at 7:30 p.ra. Traveling at first in a South 'Westerly direction we pass after an hour an affluent on right bank called TVady el Soofan up which is a village of the same name and then the Eady Jezze here forming a loop we cross the Akabat Kumashi to join it again. A few miles further S.S.E r . brings us to Buruj el Shikeyree just beyond which lies the village of Kan memorable for a conflict between the Tahabees and the Hadrami troops of Seyyid Said bin Sultan some sixty years ago in which the latter were signally defeated with great loss and which paved the way for the onward progress of these fanatics to Shinas where they again destroyed His Highness* forces, a cem etery of the slain in the bed of the ' ady near Kan attests the severity of the contest there. The tower of Shikeyree—is on a peak some ^00 feet high on the right bank and is joined to another tower below by a stone wall. It was built for the especial purpose of barring the pro gress of the v/ahabees. After another hour and a half v.e pass Y/ady V/asit up which lies a to’'n of that name* Sheikh Rashid was very anxious I should visit this place as the Sheikh Suliman bin Said El Shamisi was a great friend of his and a man of some importance. It lay .how ever too much out of the road and time was of conse quence. The next place we reached was El Koweyrej a village of the same clan as ’Yasit. the Showamis, a sub division of the Naim, and having the protection of a fortlet and two towers. The cultivation here was exten sive and very refreshing to the eye in contrast to the drear and arid rocks around. The fields were neatly ar ranged in terraces on the right bank, advantage being taken ingeniously of every available spot of ground capable of production. They were well kept and evidently received nuch attention, irrigation being carried on by means of channels leading from the copious stream above. Contiguous to this is Hail, another large village, the two formimg the most considerable settle ment I met with between Bereymi and Sohar. Hail has several towers and on the opposite bank is El Rale’ a pinnacle rock about 200 feet high on which is perched a tower surrounded by a low wall now criiiubling away. The work is ascribed to the Persians and the position is well chosen for the purpose for which it is said to have been constructed, namely to serve as an outpost to protect the maritime plain from the inroads of the Bedouins. This outpost not improbably marks the limit of the grasp of the Persians in the age immediately preceding the intro duction of Islam when they are related to have held the sea coast of Oman, the Arabs maintaining themselves in the highlands and interior. The petty clans of the Naim, the Rasheedatthe Raeheedat and the Hadeedat occupy Hail and are at enmity with their neighbors the Showamis of Koweyrej and V/asit. As may readily be imagined quarrels amon&amp; such very close neighbors are very bitter and they are said to ripen every four or five years into a free fitjht which is not terminated without bloodshed. In such cases the people of Hail have the advantage of bein^ able to cut off the water supply of those below by damming up the ‘stream which is a very effective punishment and is gen erally instrumental in bringing hostilities to a speedy termination. At Hail the ^ady Jezze is joined by its con fluent Wady el'Abeyleh up which the road now leads. The course of v.'ady Jezze above the junction is short and lies W.S.W. towards Kalil and Seneyneh. A few miles up it is a steep pass marking as my Sheikh informed me the boun dary of 121 Dhahireh. ^e rested a little while at Hail and then continued our route soon reaching more open and level ground with woody ravines and scattered herbage. Xhe highest point of this pass is called El Nejd where the aneroids showed an elevation of 1860 feet, the peaks of the range on each side rising above us 1000 feet or more. On descending the other side after an hour the VTady Ain which runs like all other water courses on the southern side of the range in a south westerly direction until its waters are absorbed by the thirsty desert. Ve now continue T7.N.W. over an unbroken plain sparsely studded with acacias direct on to Bereymi. On our right lies K1 Mahdhah the habitation of the Beni Kaab tribe while to the S.^. the lofty isolated range of Jebel Hafeet looming some twenty miles away alone breaks the level exi'anse before us, and we stand on the border of that inhospitable sea of sand and waste that stretches without break or interruption for nearly 300 miles across the peninsula and forms the greatest Sand Desert of Asia. TheI ———mill, ■-■■I IThe Bedouins of our party having remained behind at a watering place we had passed we found we had been jog ging on some miles without them and the Sheikh professed some apprehension lest ^e should encounter any of the Awamir Bedouins who he said were constantly prowling about. It is customary in Oman when moving from one part to another to take a man or two as khafeer protector from each of the more important tribes through whose country one has to pass. This applies not only to stran gers but also to any Arab passing through the territory of another tribe with whom his own is not in H Suff H or league, when it is of course unnecessary. Sheikh Rashid had not been able to procure an Amiri at Sohar before starting and hence his anxiety. ’7e had another thunder storm this evening but not much rain. On arrival at Bereymi I went to the house of Salim bin I&lt;£ohamed whose father the chief Sheikh of the Naim tribe resides at Dhank. Our arrival was the signal for a general assembly of visitors whom I soon tired of and I therefore beat a retreat to another house outside which was cleared for my reception. ISarly the next morning I set out to visit the fort which at present is in the hands of Sheikh Hamad. I saw his house on the way and as he was laid up with a dislocated shoulder from a fall off a camel he sent to invite me in to take coffee. The house consists of two lofty rooms separated by an arch and with no furniture but a carpet or two and an array of coffee pots. Two or three damsels bundled out as I entered but the fowls and goats that seemed to make up the complement of the in mates, being less bashful, remained. The walls of the courtyard are loopholed for musketry and a rusty iron gun lies half buried in the ground inside. It took some little time to get coffee ready for the assembly that had crowded into the house and filled both sides of the roomroom tout ”'hen it over I took lefive 3.nd contiiiii^ci ay way to the fort. On reaching the gate I received a salute of three guns which put the ordnance hors de com- toat toy dismounting them from their rickety carriages and thus prevented any further expenditure of powder. I was then taken over the fort and the ptojects of interest generally were pointed out to me with great readiness and evident pleasure toy the Sheikh’s nephew and his peo ple. I was gratified toy their civility and spent some time in looking over the place, the strength and impor tance of which in their eyes are toy no means undervalued. The plain in which J31 Bereymi stands toeing so level the view from the upper towers is extensive and interesting embracing as it does the whole of K1 Jow and enabling one to get a tolerably clear notion at a glance of the topography of the settlement. To the S.?/. at a little distance off lies Sedeyrees house erected many years ago toy that Wahatoee Chief for his own resi dence. It was solidly built of stone tout was destroyed toy Seyyid Azzan in 1870 who disapproved of seeing so strong a fortified house so near the fort and who requi red the stones of which it was built to pepair and strengthen the latter. After leaving the fort I spent some time in walking through the section of the settlement more par ticularly known as K1 Bereymi. The dates had nearly all been gathered and the fields w ere toeing just freshly sown for the spring harvest, except a fe w late fields of Jowaree, and the fruit season was over so I did not see the place to full advantage, tout the fields were neat and regular and the orchards well cared for. Indeed great attention is paid to horticulture throughout Oman and at all the centres of population the 'Bostans' are the great objects of interest. The houses in these settlements are seldom grouped together tout are scattered amog the date groves; they are principally of mat and date leaf constructionconstraction and form perhaps the least obtrusive part of the landscape. A good proportion of the fe w mud houses was dilapidated and untenanted and gave a' general air of unsubstantiality to the place. The verdant appearance of this oasis, however, in which the tall and handsome foliage of the date is the predominant feature is most attractive and refreshing to the eye of the traveller and soon makes him oblivious of the drear and arid waste he has traversed to reach it, while the luxuriant vege tation, the sight and suund uf running ,,r ater, the almost entire absence of unproductive trees and plants convey an impression of prosperity which is by no means borne out in reality. During the day several of the Sheikhs came to visit me at Suara and as they were communicative I was glad of tiie conversation. Among those who came was Sheikh Ali bin Seif of the Beni Xaab who lives at 131 Mahdhah; he ,rr as loquacious and lively and was very solic itous I should visit his tribe and settlement but it was unfortunately not convenient to do so and I was compelled to accept his invitation for another time. He told me he had been to D1 Riad having been taken captive by the ^Vahabees in his youth and carried thither in irons. He believed they were days on the road from SI Bereymi to SI Hasa as they travelled slowly and there was plenty of water on tho way. Hot having had time to visit any of the Beni Yas settlements in the morning a messenger arrived from them inviting me to do so but I was obliged to de cline as it was already time for me to be taking my de parture. At the suggestion of Sheikh Rashid I requested Sheikh Salim to furnish us with an escort to the limits of SI Jow, but as he proposed to accompany me himself the first stage I accepted his company with pleasure. It was not without strong remonstrances and pressing invitations to stay a day or two longer that we were permitted to makemake a start b±t ^e succeeded in doing so about 3 p.m. and in the presence of an admiring crowd of boys and Bed ouins we left El Bereymi at a brisk trot by the same road that we had come;- the Bedoos shouting and singing and racing their camels at full speed in high spirits and evi dent delight at being on the road again and already obli vious of the fact that half an hour before they had been sulky and disgusted at being told to collect the camels for the journey. After some miles a peak to our left named Katar was pointed out to me as having on the top the remains of a Persian settlement with trees, dwell ings etc. and said to have been occupied by them after their repulse at El Bereymi. v.e passed Khatmet el Shik- la a small village at 12 miles and soon after observing a low reddish coloured hill some distance off very con spicuous among the other dark rocks. I told a roan to bring me a specimen. Nearly the whole p^ty started off and returned with sufficient stones to fill a portman teau. It was a red compact numraulitic limestone and was the only block of the kind I noticed on the journey. It was just dark when w e reached El Kuroos a deep cleft in the rocky bed of the ''ady Air which holds a perennial supply of rain water. The Arabs were anxious to push on to Hail another 15 miles or so in the dark but I objected T/ood and water were sufficiently abundant and we soon had a good fire under way and supper cooking. I noticed the Arabs tonight obtained fire from a spark by rolling the tinder into a ball with dry grass and swinging it round until it burst into flame. The dew tonight was very heavy and my blanket was drenched by morning. 20th. Before starting I took leave of Sheikh Salim bin Mohamed whose protection was no longer required giving him a suitable present, and I may mention as an instance of the entire w ant of shamefacedness in the Arab in begging that he came up to me quietly after he had received his douceur from my factotum to whisper a requestrequest for two dollars more. I insinuated he had already received what I thought was prox&gt;er for him on which he said, ,M 7ell # £ive me one, only one more dollar and I will be satisfied.” This nan’s father is chief of one of the largest tribes in Oman and he himself a nan of much in fluence and consideration, * v e reached the Nejd two hours after leaving El Kuroos. The ground here which for some extent is comparatively level is well wooded with acacias, rhamnus etc. and green with low brushwood and grass. It is visited in season by the Nairn and Kaab Arabs for pas turing their camels and goats. The mountain range we are crossing is, except in the valleys and water courses where the detritus from the hills forms a little soil, remarkably arid and sterile and is everywhere from Jebel A’khdhar to Runs el debel entirely unclothed with verdure presenting one of the bleakest ra;.gcs it is possible imagine. The large valleys contain a good deal of herba ceous but very little ligneous vegetation. Among the trees and plants in the ,; ady Jezze and in the plain be yond the range were noticed the rhamnus, Sereupine, Samar, or acacia vera, acacia arabia, two oleanders, calotropic 0., castor oil and colocynth gourd, two or three euphorbias, the wild lavender, a rush much used for making mats called rasad, the maranneh the narcotic plant noticed by Palgrave, the rose scented shirkeh and much coarse grass in tufts. At Hail which was reached in three hours from Kuroos and which is perhaps 35 or 40 miles from Bereymi we halted for a short time for breakfast and to feed the camels which were beginning to show symptoms of fatigue, for since the commencement of the jpurney ^e had been keeping up a jogtrot of from 5 to 7 miles an hour when ever the road rendered it at all practicable. Our drom edaries ,w ere all pretty good and were as sleek and well shaped in appearance as they were swift and easy in going.&amp;oing. Oman camels are acknowledged the best in the ’'arid The Sherif of Mecca rides none other and last year he received a present of’six from Seyyid Toorkee which were sent by sea to Jedda. They fetch from 100 to 150 dollars if very superior but the ordinary ones run.from 50 dol- % lars upwards. Depth of chest is condidered one of their chief points. The Bedouins of Oman sometimes take their camels from El Bereymi across Arabia to Nejd and El Hejaz for sale. In Oman Arabs ride behind the hump the saddle beint very small with a felt and sheepskin over it. The camel’s nose is not pierced but a headstall with a chain noseband and a thick camel hair rope forms the bridle. In Yemen they sit in front of the hump resting the feet on the neck of the animal, the saddle having a high pom mel to give Bupxort. On leaving Hail ^e entered the polit ical boundary of Sohar and preceded do w n the T -Vady Jezze by the side of running water flowing at intervals as far as Mileyyeneh. Owing to the alternate porosity and rock iness of the bed of the stream, it rushes along at one f place for some distance, then suddenly disappeats to re appear again as suddenly further on. Kan and Shikeyree, Saheelah and Miieyyeneh are successively passed and left behind until at nightfall w© reached our resting place not far from Sehlat where the road branched off to Jebel Oharabeh a spot I was anxious to visit. During our march today we had oeen joined by two Sheikhs of the Haim tribe who were taking two horses for sale at Sohar. One of these, a chestnut mare was a very casty, well formed and pretty animal and from the price put on her the Sheikhs seemed to have a very exalted idea of her value. V/e passed on the road several small parties of donkeys and camels laden with dried and salt fish going up to El Bereymi where the consumption of this article is very considerable The road w e have been traveling lies almost entirelyentirely alon^ the smooth and sandy bed of the ladies or torrents and presents no difficulties of ’-n^ Kind to communication, ffor the first 30 miles or so from Sohar the road winds up ?/ady *Tezze and for 10 miles more its confluent Wady Abeyleh. We then cross the rid^e of the chain here very low not exceeding 1.900 feet while the peaks on each side reach about 3000. On descending the other side we find ourselves on the plain of El Jow which borders on the great desert. Though heavy in places the road is quite practicable for guns and I remember no place that would cause artillery more than an hour’s attention. The mountain range that has been crossed is part of the chain leading from Ras Mosandum to Jebel Akhd har and divides the provinces of R1 Dhahireh and El Bat- ineh. The hilly district between these t'^o provinces is styled El Hajar by the Arabs but there is no general name for the range that connects Jebel Akhdhar with Ruus el Jebal. The water sheds towards Ruus el Jebal lie east and T 'est while lower down towards Jebel Akhdhar they lie N.E. and S.W. Running water was met with by me only in Vady Jesze from Hail to Sehlat and then never more than a few inches deep but there is no scarcity of water any where. The inhabited spots are irrigated both by canals drawn from the stream and by wells. The geological for mation appears to be tertiary. The rocks were sedimentary the principal being a very dark limestone and an argil laceous slate, the latter lying in great angles. The bed of v/ady Jezze is cut through a breccia containing frag ments of granite, green limestone, quartz and a beauti fully variegated sandstone and the breccia or conglomer ate is penetrated in some places by masses of shale or slate. The range is very peaked and sharp ridged and here and there the strata were in waves appearing as if the rock at some time been subjected to pressure. Through out the whole route the aspect of the country is extreme ly barrenly barren and sterile as rci^ht be expected is unable to sustain much animal life. The only ~ild animals I noticed ^ere a few ravine deer and foxes and birds were every where extremely rare. On starting the next morning we proceeded down the bank of -ady el Aweyneh of the 31 Mokabil who occupy chiefly the upper part where it is well wooded and where running water is abundant. In an hour and a half ''e reached Jebel Gharabeh where as I had already learnt Inom Sheikh Rashid, who had been regaling me throughout the journey with the traditionary lore of Oman, were situ ated the ruins of the citadel of Oman, the pristine name of Sohar, at one time the capital of the whole country. I determined here to take the opportunity to explore thes* interesting and ancient ruins which are probably not par- ailed in Oman and accordingly made a short halt for the purpose. The hill is not high, perhaps £00 or 300 feet, but it is very steep and inaccessible and there being no semblance of a road I was glad to accept the assistance of the Bedouins who are agile as cats and clamber about the mos’t difficult places with ease. Around the siimmit which is irregular are traceable the ruins of these fort ifications extending for perhaps half a mile. The ^all still stands in places from £ to 6 feet high and it is possible to trace the outline of part of the buildings at the highest point though the greater part are an un- distinguishable heap of ruins. Along the line of forti fications at intervals were small circular towers several of which are still conspicuous. Yhe thickness of the walls ^as uniformly about three feet and they are con structed entirely of rough fragments of the rocks of which the upper part of the hill is composed,--viz- a white vulitic limestone, cemented with clay and I could detect only three places in ’~hich mortar had been used at all. These ”'ere* an arch in the wall; the curbstones inin the path that led down the hill and the ^ater cisterns- One of these cisters of which there are t^o is quite at the summit and is in shape an oblong square constructed of round x jeD ^i es cemented and plastered with mortar. The other is oval shajjed and of similar construetion. It is lower down the hill. Both these tanks are small and snal- low and in such good condition that if cleaned out they mi^ht still be serviceable. There are no signs of wells having been sunk that I could see; indeed the quality of the rock precludes the idea of such an experiment. Some what below the highest point is an arch in the wall built of selected stones cemented together and was not improbably that of the gateway as it is just over the road. There is one other arch in a tower lowere down but it is made ''ith long slabs placed together uncemented. Only a few yards of the road-way are traceable near the top the rest is entirely obliterated but it probably wound round the greater part of the hill. It xvas very narrow and faced at the edge with curbstones. It was at the extreme summit where the outline is best preserved that the residence of the chief or governor probably stood but to judge from the heap of stones in situ the building was apparently of no great extent. Perhaps a small stone house for the chief and rude shelter for the garrison were all that ’'as needed. From its position and strength, however, the importance of the ci.stle is suf ficiently apparent and it was doubtless considered quite impregnable in those days of slings and bowg w hile of course it commanded the whole plain of Sohar from hence to the sea. According to the tradition of the Arabs as related to me by Sheikh Rashid and confirmed by Seyyid Toorkee and others the castle at Jebel Gharabeh as well as the city of Oman were founded by Jelinda bin Karkar under whom the city covered a great part of the maritime plainplain lyin&amp; between Jebel Gharabeh and the sea, but there is no doubt that the ruins of El Gharabeh and the city are ranch anterior to the time of the Jelandaites. Another legend related to me w as of the daughter of Julanda whose hand became diseased and withered while the physicians were unable to apply any remedy. She remained tnus for a long time and at last decided to try the ben efit of the sea air and bathing after experiencing which i for a short time she entirely recovered. The above tra dition, it may be remarked, deriving the Julandaites from the Amalekite Beni Kerker is opposed to the more gener ally received account according to w/iicn they descend from the El Azd of Oman. The Amaleka properly derive from the Ishmaelite or Nejdean stock as does also Sohar the brother of Tasen and Jadis and the Eponymus of the an cient town. The Julandaites were a powerful dynasty in Oman and for some.time previous to the second advent of the Persians before Islam held dominion over Bahrein and the whole of the Persian Gulf. According to Ross* Annals of Oman the Persians at the time of the introduction of Islam had possession of the sea coast of Oman while the Arabs had the interior, Mohammed sent messengers to the two sons of Julanda who then ruled in Oman and these messengers alighted at Damsetjerd near Sohar a fortified place built b v the Persians. Julanda f s sons, Abd and Jeifar and the Arabs agreed to accept Islam but the Per sians refusing were attacked in Damsetjerd by Jeifar and compelled to uuit Oman. This Bamsetjerd I am inclined to identify with the ruins at Felej El Sook described above and this is indicated I think both by their posi tion and the Arab tradition attaching to the spot. The extreme antiquity of Sohar as one of the principal em poriums of Oman is shown by its identification with the ancient city of Oman the capital of the country, which depends not alone on Arab tradition and authority but is acceptedaccepted by European writers who see in Sohar the Omana or Orana of Pliny and Ptolemy. the exact period however at which the to''n changed its name is a question more difficult of solution and re£ardin(j which history and tradition afford no clue. The ancient history of Sohar is very obscure and though frequent references to it may be found in all ages, no good description or account of it exists that I am a'^are of. A short notice, however by Ibn Mojowir is ^orth quoting. He saysiSohar had 1£,000 houses and e^ery nakhadoa dwelt in a separate house and the people used to dra*” their drinking water from the aqueduct. Someone told me there were 192 steelyards for the weighing of merchandise between vendors and purchasers. The town was built of bricks, mortar and teak wood and it became ruined and the Jinn haunted the castles around. Abu Behr El Basri informed me that the country belonged- first to the kings of Kerman of the Seljuk dynasty; then it was ruled by the El Ghazz and afterwards it became deserted and ’'as destroyed by the Arabs” Some cultivated spots are still to be seen near Jebel Gharabeh but the only outward sign of its former greadness remaining is the aqueduct Pelej el Moteridh. This work which is of good stonemanonry along the surface of the ground with a gentle declivity, leads from the Wady Jezze in the vicinity of Hooreh Bargheh, or Sohar Peak as we call it, to the shore a distance in a straight line of 14 or 15 miles and is still distinct ly traceable for the greater part of the way disappearing at the outskirts of the present town. I noticed by the side of it more than one small cistern of exactly the same pattern and construction as those on Jebel Gharabeh. The modern town of Sohar has for some years been in a gradually declining state. It has been described in the bright page of Palgrave but has still further decayed sincesince his visit. In Sohar proper '*hich lies bet-een Has Sellan and the village of Soweyhereh, the population is now only about 4000, including 400 Persians, a dozen been , Jews who have gradually decreasing in numbers year year and half a dozen banians. The bulk of the inhabitant* here as also along the coast from Sohar to IJJajis are of Persian and Belooch descent. The citadel in which the Governor Seyyid Bedr resides is a lofty, square, plain building with a strong entrance and well defended by a moat. Next to Sohar peak it is the most conspicuous ob ject seen from seacards. Prom the roof an excellent view of the surrounding country is obtained and a lovely land scape it is: the seashore being fringed with a belt of stately palms, gardens, and cultivation about three miles broad, while behind the plain rises gradually un til broken up by the spurs of the lofty, dark serrated range in the background. In the second story of this hous* is the tomb of Seyyid Thoweynee bin Saeed but the room in which it stands has been bricked up since my last visit. It is remarkable that of the number believed to have been associated directly or indirectly with Seyyid Salim in his parricidal act, some nine persons, only two are alive, the rest having all ’~ith one exception met violent deaths. The town wall is very dilapidated especially the front towards the sea and is now fast crumbling down. There are no towers or bastions to it but the moat is still kept clear on the land side. The circuit of the wall wall is about a mile but a very small extent of this area inside is covered with houses the rest of the ground being bare or occupied with date or other fruit trees. The market contains about forty shops and is good and well filled, the fish market particularly. The fisheries on the Batineh coast are abundat to a miracle. The cus toms duties on all goods are five percent and the farm thisthis year has been sold to a Persian for 175 dollars per month, but this is no ^au^e for the amount of foreign goods consumed as much is obtained from Muscat where it has alrea.dy paid duty and is coasequently free from assessment here. Trade is said to be decreasing annually and to be transferring itself to Sharjah which is almost as easy of access to the principal customers of Sohar the Arabs of El Dhahireh and El Jow, and where goods are cheaper, bein^ imported thither direct from Bombay and thus saving Muscat dues and reshipment. Sohar has no har bour nor even the slightest shelter for native craft and is dependant entirely on its position in being able to tap the trade of upi er Dhahireh and El Jo t *' for existence and should this source of prosperity be in part dra^n off by rival ports it must sink in time to the level of other towns in the Batinah. El .Tow in which El Bereymi lies is the smallest of the six provinces in Oman and situate between El Dhahireh and the Shemal. It is bounded on the south by .Tebel Hafeet, on the east by Khatmet el Shikla and El Kahdhah, on the north by the •'! Sheraal and to the ^est by the Desert. El .Tow is inhabited by several tribes both fthafiree and Hina^i, the former having been in the ascendant since the accession of Seyyid Toorkee. Tne most powerful and the predominant Ghafiree tribe at pres ent is the Naim which is divided into two distinct and about equal sections, each having numerous subdivisions and numbers on the whole some ii0 # 000 souls. They occupy El Bereymi proper and Suareh and their possession of the fort enables them to overawe the whole of the settle ment. Since the time of Seyyid Azzan they have been prac tically uninterfered with by the Muscat Government, but of course own allegiance to the present Sultan. The Naim are at feud with tne Beni Yas who occupy p»art of Bereymi and their hostility is interrupted only by occasional truces, collisions frequently occurring between them. OfOf the two sections of the Naim one inhabits more par ticularly El Jow and Bereymi, the other El Phakireh. They are of the more orthodox or Sunni persuasion unlike the generality of Omanis who are Ibadheea. The chief Sheikh of the tribe Mohamed bin Ali bin Hamaod who lives at Dhank, his representative at Bereymi bein^ his son Salim. The principal Hinawi tribe at El Bereymi is the Beni Yas who formerly gained so much notoriety by their piratical exploits. The chief of this tribe is Sheikh Zaid bin Khaleefah, a man of strong character and perhaps the sole individual in these parts possessing any real personal power and authority. He resides at Abutnabee and there are four smaller Sheikhs subordinate to him residing at El Bereymi. This tribe takes the lead on the Hina’'! side in all dissensions between the Hinawis and Giiafirees residing at El Bereymi and during Seyyid Az- * zan’s reign held the predominant position here. The Beni Yas occupy the villages of Eemi, Katara, Heyli, and the !7ady Mesaom:i at El Bereymi and are said to have former ly outnumbered the Naim but this state of affairs has become reversed of late. The Gnafiree tribe next in importance to the Naim is the Beni Kaab which numbers some 1 5,000 souls and occupies the district of El Mahdhah which includes the mountain range and vallies between Tady Jezze and Y/ady Hatta. There are about twenty villages in tnis dis trict, of which the princix)al is El Mahdhah where the Sheikh, Ali bin Seif resides. They are all irrigated by conduits drawn from the hills and as the soil is the same, Mahdhah produces the same kinds and qualities of grain and fruits as El Bereymi. There is no direct pass through the range from El Mahdhah to Sohar between Hatta and El Jezze. Other Ghafiree tribes are the Beni Katab and El Daramikeh and Hinawi tribes are the Bhowahir which occupies Ain, El Daoodi, El Kharais, El Mareyjib, Saeneh, . nSaeheh, and Moteridh and ranis, next in power to the deni Yas and the Awamir. This last is a very lartse nomadic tribe widely scattered over Oman but occupying chiefly the desert outskirts from Kooria Mooria Bay to the Sabkha and roam ing about with their flocks and herds in a state of semi- savagedom.. The Awamir are genuine Bedouins and no wild er or more x;redatory race exists, I believe, in Arabia. One of their clans, the Affar are popularly supposed to feed upon the bodiec of animals that have died naturally but this is denied by the tribe who however admit that they are not unfrequently reduced to devouring their skin clothing. A large portion of this tribe has settled down particularly in the province of Oman ’'here they occupy a district of twelve villages and follow agricultural pursuits. The wandering A^amir do not even respect the members of other clans of their tribe unless they are acquainted with them but plunder indiscriminately all they meet. In August 1874 a party of this tribe arrived at Muscat from the neighborhood of ^'ady Rekot in Kooria Mooria Bay to assist His Highness Seyyid Toorkee in an expedition he was engaged on and returned afterwards a.8 they had come - by land. They professed no difficulty in making their way over the Great Gesert. El Bereymi is the appellation usually apj)lied to a collection of seven villages or settlements of which the one specially bearing that name is the largest and most important. The others are, Suareh to the north; Gerai Xatara and Heyli to the N.T7.; and Ain and Motaridh to the S.E. and the population of the whole may be es timated at 12 to 15,000. From the outside the appearance of these small settlements is very pretty and refreshing the date palms and orchards forming a green setting to the low palm leaf huts which are scattered throughout and which just peep through the foliage. They have a strikingi striking similarity to the 'Abadees or settlements m Mekran. fiHK general condition of the people is lor and there is a noticeable equality of property throughout but this is o'^ing probably wore to the wan t of good O ov eminent and the chronic state of warfare and insecurity they live in than to the natural disadvantages of the land. Agriculture is in rather a mediocre state as re gards cereals and vegetables, the principal object of culture being of course the dutts. Th„} not dependant on the annual rainfall which is small but are able to irrigate with certainty b: mean# of their valuable aque ducts or felejs drawn from the hill range as well as from wells, T ~ater being abundant and at no great depth. 3ach settlement has at least one of these canals, that at El Bereymi proper being brought from a perennial spring in the hills about twenty miles a w ay. The water in this canal was quite warm to the touch, but I forget what they told me about the source. The grains gro’m are wheat, jo^aree, maize, barley and bajree, being sometimes suc- or ceeded by a crop of beans, pulse, but the latter are never sown intermingled with cereals. The stubble is al ways plowed in and never burn&amp; and the only manure used is cattle dung. The vegetables grown are sweet potatoes, rad ishes, cucumbers, egg plants, onions, and pumpkins. To bacco, cotton, red and white lucerne, are also grown, the last for the use of cattle. Eight or nine crops of this are obtained in the year, showing the quality of the soil which is fertile but thin. But more care and atten tion are bestowed on the fruits than on anything else and they consequently arrive at considerable excellence. All the beet kinds of dates are cultivated;Fard, Maeey- bili, Xhalas, etc. though they are not considered equal to the same varieties in Bedeea and Semail. The other fruits are peachs, mangoes, custard apples, limes, sweet limes, oranges, mulberries, pomegranates, melons, guavos. figsfigs and grapes. There are only a very few horses at El Bereymi belonging to the Sheikhs - cattle too are scares, camels are abundant and cheap and asses are used exten sively for burden and riding. The food of the people is chiefly dates and coarse bread or rice varied by salt fish, camels and goats flesh. Milk is abundant and a hard sort of cream cheese is made, the juice of an euphorbia being sometimes used instead of rennet for coagulating the milk, bn the sea coast the intestines of fish are often used for this purpose. There being no banians or other regular traders there is no general bazaar at Bereyrai but every afternoon a general market is held where the Bedouins assemble with their produce and animals for sale or barter with those who can supply their wants. Money is little used on such occasions when cloth, articles of food, camels, donkeys, goats, and all the miscellaneous articles of an Arab are exchanged. The most trifling things change hands, and the scene is as may be imagined, a lively and picturesque one. The ladies here, I observed, did not wear the tinselled mask seen in Muscat but covered their heads with a black cloth veil which is still more unbecoming. I must not omit, that li&amp;e their European sisters, they 'ore high heeled shoes. Their occupations, besides household aff airs, are spinning, mat weaving, felt making and tending goats and kine. El Bereymi formerly possessed two forts, only one of which is now standing, the other has been demolish ed and lies a heap of ruins. Both are said to have been built by the Showamis, a strong clan of the Naim occupyin chiefly the Tady Jezze, but the fort still standing was improved and strengthened by the 'Vahabees during their occupation* It consists of four towers joined by curtains and surrounded by a deeiJ ditch. It ie of square form, builtbuilt entirely of mud or unburnt bricks and carries ei^ht ^uns of sizes. The breadth of the ditch is about 25 feet and both scarp and counterscarp are quite steep and faced with brick w ork. The rampart is eight feet high and two thick and there is an open space of 20 paces between it and the towers. These towers rise per haps forty feet, the curtains somewhat less than half way up and each side of the square formed by them is about 150 feet. The gate is the weakest part of the structure, there being only a single small wooden door standing halfway across the ditch which is here bridged '’ith the trunks of two date trees. Inside the fort is a residence for the Sheikh with accomodation for the men and some godowns. ,T .*ater is abundantly provided by two wells which would yield sufficient for a large garrison. I tasted the water of one and it was perfectly sweet and good. Near the outer gate is a brass 24 pr. mounted as a field piece having the name of Seyyid bin Sultan A.H. !£58 in Arabic and the English date 1842. It is one of a batch of 20 that Seyyid Said procured from America at that time for his corvette 'Sultan'. This gun was brought from Sohar by Seyyid Azzan in 1870 in his expedition against Bereyrai and was used against the fort it now defends. Tith unusual energy and forethought for an Arab, Seyyid Azzan brought spare carriage wheels, harness and tents, a all of which are carefully stored up in a godown. The harness did not look as if it had ever been used, and they told me the gun had been dragged thither entirely by manual labor. The fort is fairly w e H situated and stands out on the i'3. a in, but on the north west side the houses and cultivation encroach somewhat close upon it and on the other side lie the ruins of iedeyrees Port at no great distance which would afford capital shelter for an enemy. Both as regards strength and position it is thethe most important fort in this part of Oman and is gen erally regarded as the key of the country towards the west. Its reduction, th refore would be considered ne cessary by any force approaching from that side. I en deavored to gather information respecting the route between Oman and Nedj but the accounts were somewhat dis crepant. According to some, the first district oeyond El Jow is B£anoona in which is SI Aukeh, a hamlet of the Beni Kattab with a small date grove, the Sheikh of which is Saeed ibn Aweydim. Next to Beinoona lies Lei Hafreli inhabited chiefly by the Memaseer and whre there is a watered grassy vale called Bafis, visited in season for pasture by the Memaseer, Awamir, Beni Yas, Beni Kattab, El Miezaniyeh and El Ghafaleh, nomads. Further on between El Dhafreh, Katar and El Hasa is the district of El Jaa- frr. Through these disctricts lies the route from ; 4 j 1 Ber- eymi to El Hasa, from whence the road continues to El Riad. There is no track that can be followed as the sand is blown about by the ^ind, but there appears to be t^o general routes, one of which is used more in winter, the other in summer. The first is traighter and shorter, the other is nearer the sea, is more winding, and afeter leav ing the Sabkeh turns north for three days. The journey is not considered dangerous or difficult as ” , ater is found in many places though usually very brackish and the^ seldom have to carry a supply for more than two days. Caravans very rarely make the journey, and travel only at night, taking about thirty days from El Hasa to El Bereymi. Troops as a rule travel by day only, their pace being a gentle arable, and they cover the distance in f.O to ^5 days. A Koseid takes ten days. The Menasaeer and Beni Yas chiefly hold possession of the eastern part of the route. The A1 Morra of the western. No hills are met with on the w ay and the only ^adies are El Sabkheh and El Sohba. I give in a tabular form the halting stations of the two routes, but as already observed, water is procurableX&gt;rocurable in many other places. The Sabich or Sabkheh Mattih as it is sometimes termed is a marshy tract or ^ady about 40 miles in breadth commencing from the vi cinity of ^ady Jebrin and entering the Persiam Gulf between Lon^ 51.50 and 52.£0, lAt 24. In some parts it is a treacherous morass only to be crossed at the beaten tracks and it is said that if the camel misses the path he becomes en^ptlfed in the mud.The Sabkeh according to the concurrent testimony cf all the Sheikhs and best in formed persons I have spoken to on the subject botn in K1 Jow and Muscat including Kis Highness Seyyid Toorkee is the boundary line between Nedj and Oman and has been so considered from time immemorial. The watershed of HI Aar id and Yeraamah appear to the S.E. the T *ady Han if eh and all otner v/adies converging towards El Raudha where they unite in the '^ady El Sohba which falls into the Per- sian Gulf just above the Sabkeh Mattih probably at Khor el Dhoan. The Bedouins in the Great Desert rear great numbers of camels the sale of which constitutes their chief support. The Aal Morra and Awamir are said to tra verse it extensively as it is not entirely destitute of water which can be obtained of bracxish quality in places by digging, Palms and other large trees are not met with but dwarf acacias and herbaceous vegetation suitable for camel fodder are sufficiently abundant. Besides two species of gazelle and the oryx numerous ostriches in habit the more northern and western portions and are hunted for the sake of their feathers which eventually find their * r ay to Mecca, there being no sale for them in Oman. There is said to be a route running direct S.E. from Nedj to Mahra that takes 25 days, ^ater is procured every three or four days and is carried on in skins, the Bedouins finding their way without any difficulty; a light camel load of dates and flour enabling them to traverse a long distance. In 1870 Saood bin Feysal came straightetrai( 5 ht across the Great Desert from Nejran to Abuthe- bee in 56 days travelling leisurely but for the last 15 days he and hie followers ^ere greatly i&gt;ressed for food, their store having become exhausted. His purpose ’^as to meet Seyyid Aszan which he did at Burka and then accompan ied him in his expedition against K1 Bereymi. South of Yemamah and three days from £1 Hasa lies the fertile and well watered valley of Jabrin whose groves of date palms are said to extend for several miles. It is situate entirely in the desert and does not form part of Hejd. It was formerly a large and flourish ing settlement but it subsequently became so malarious and unhealthy that the inhabitants were driven away and it is now almost entirely destitute of permanent resi dents. The Arabs claim an antiquity of 800 years for it but it lias long since fallen thoUiJi I believe the fort and some of the walls of the houses are still standing. It is also said that after heavy floods gold coins are sometimes picked up by the Bedouins. The dates belong to the Aal Morra and Dowasir tribes who visit Jabrin in the Gheith or summer to collect the harvest which is carried to Hejd and El Hasa for sale. It is also extensively resorted to by the nomads in the vicinity with their flocks and herds for the sake of the luxuriant pasturage. In Bereymi I found a small colony of the Zatt or Zattoot, as the Arabs call them, settled. In his Alte Geographie Arabians para. 17?., Dr. A. Springer has iden tified the Zatt with the Jats of India, and though, as he shows, they have been in Arabia upwards of 1000 years the- are at once distinguishable from the Arabs as a distinct race. They are spread over Central and Eastern Arabia from Muscat to Mesopotamia and everywhere maintain them selves as a separate community, never intermingling by intermarriage with the Arabs. They go about unarmed and are held in great respect by the Arabs who value them for the useful services they render and never think of molestingmolesting them. All kinds of ' r ork are done by the .Tats who are farriers, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, carpenters, and pedlars. They also manufacture &amp;uns and matchlocks indeed all the trades and manufactures seem to be in their hands and they are to the natives of the interior what the Banians and other Indians are at the seaport towns. They retain their own language among themselves or as the Arabs say, they speak 'ratteeni' and they often know several languages. The ''omen are caid to oe very handsome and de.nce publicly for money but are reputed to be very chaste and moral. In Nejd I hear they are a necessary ingredient for Arab marriages as they set off the assembly by their beauty and the wedding party is not considered complete without them. They respect and benave well to each other and when one arrives from another province, a Eejd Zatt coming to Dl Hasa, for instance, he is welcomed and entertained with honour, given a wife and assisted in settling down. The levirate law obtains among them, but should there be no brother the nearest male relative can take the widow to wife. The Zatt even in distant parts such as in Nejd, Basra, Oman, etc. maintain cinstant intercommunication with each other but I am not aware if this extends to the tribes in India. The Arabs profess ignorance as to the origin of the Zatt but state that the Zatt themselves declare they originally came from India.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00007c_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/349</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00007c</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/349</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 11/6 Colonel Miles' Notes on Buraimi'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1875/1876</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-09-06T22:05:47</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (28 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 30; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
