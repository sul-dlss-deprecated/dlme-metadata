The papers contain incidents relating to the payment of customs duties, the customary drawing of water from populations surrounding the estuary, and the boring of water wells within Kuwait as an alternative. The majority of the correspondence is between the Political Agency in Kuwait, the Political Residency at Bushire, and a variety of experts and Kuwait Oil Company employees with expertise to bear on the matter of obtaining fresh water supplies for Kuwait.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Water transport</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Basra</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Geology</topic></subject><subject><topic>Water supply</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00008b#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00008b#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00008b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
