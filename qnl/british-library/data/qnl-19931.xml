Sir, I have the honour to state, for the info nation of His Majesty's (arovernment in Newfoundland, that the serious position of the finances of Bahrein, an Arabian State in the .ersian Gulf, has recently come under th^consid ©ration of the GcyeriMent of Xnaia and His Majesty 1 3 GrOTemment in the United Kingdom* 2, The Political Resident in the Persian Qulf reported early in the year to the Gar eminent of Indie feat in order to meet the deficit the Bahrein Government had proposed an Increase in certain oust cans dutie to Article 17 of the Bahrein Convention of the 31st May 1861, (see page 685 of Volume XIII of Hertslet's Treaties) provides that the goods of Briti^i subjects shall be subject only to an ad valorem duty of 5fo t but, owing to the urgent necessity of preserving the State's solvency, the Grovernment of India recommended that this departure from the provisions of the Convention should be agreed to as a tenporary measure* on the understanaing that the increase would apply to foreign as well as to British goods; and this recommendation was accepted. 3* Later reports from the Government of India, however, indicated that this temporary/1 teiiporary increase had not x^roved sufficient to alleviate the financial situation, and that it remained acute. 3?he rolitieal Resident in the Persian Gulf, after ull examination of postiible alternatives, urged that tlie situatioi could only be satisfactorily dealt with if the limitation imposed by Act XV were temporarily withdrawn# She Uoverniaent of India endorsed this recomendation as a purely temporary measure subject to the safeguards (1) that the goods of all British subjects shall be subject to no other or higher duties than those imposed on other goods of the saiiB kind (2) that the olitical Kesident shall be given four months notice of any increase in the duties, above the rates at present permitted, in order that he imy have the Oi. ortunity of maldng any observations that he may consider desirable. 4, Mo foimal modification of the Convention has been made, but the Political Kesiaent has addressed a letter to the Bahrein Government to the effect that approval is given, as a tern porary measure, to the withdrawal of the limitation imposed by Article IV of the 1861 Convention, subject to the safeguards mentioned abcve. It may be added that it has been known for some months that the Bahrein GovernuBut were anxious to increase the tari ff/1 tariff on luxary articles to 10^ and on tobacco and liquor to 15^ ad valorem, and in the special oircumstances consent has been given to the waiver in the case of these increases of the four months 1 period of notice stimulated in the Political Hesident 1 s letter.

Sir, I have the nonour to enclose a copy of letter No:958/S.F dated the 12th January 1933 from tne Financial Adviser to the Government of Bahrain,covering the usual monthly statement of linances for the month of Sha T ban 13bl. I regret tnat the Statement shows no improvement,but the death of the late Ruler of Bahrain should result in a saving of the whole or part of his allowance. 3. The month of fiamadhan has precluded any discussion of the matter but it will be taken up as soon as a favour able opportunity offers itself. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant. Lieut Colonel. Political Agent,BahrainIk I 0 Copy of letter No:958 /S.F dated the l^th January 1933 from the Financial Adviser to the Bahrain Government to the Political Agent,Bahrain. I have the nonour to enclose herewith statements of Revenue and expenditure for the 8 months ol the year,up to the end of Shaban 1351. The month of Shaban,being the month preceeding Ramadhan. is usually one of the best months in the year. The Customs collections show an increase of Rs.11,000/- over the previous month. Owing to the payment of Rs.10,000/- Royalty on the oil concession 'Rents of Government lands' has increased,but all other sources of revenue have decreased. The Revenue shows a total increase of Rs#17,000/- over the previous month. The deficit on the budgetted revenue for 8 months is now Rs.49,000/-. Expenditure for Shaban exceeded that of Rajab by about Rs.7,000/- taking into account outstanding bills. The financial position of the State shows an improvement of about Rs.10,000/-,as compared to the position at the ena of the previous month. Without wisshing to appear unduly pessimistic I must point out that the financial position continues to be extremely serious,the apparent improvement is disappointing in a month which should have been unusually productive and the extra Rs.10,000/- only represents the amount paid by the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited for the oil concessioo The financial position was to be reviewed after two months,the two months have now expired and the improvement is negligible.(6). ?: | '• S A»« . Dtt '' Confidential D.0.No:C/53. [ OfiNFtfiflm/L AEoim ^0 Political Agency, Bahrain,the 6th February 1933 I enclose a copy of a demi-official letter,No:957 dated the 11th. January 1933,from Belgrave regarding the Finances of Bahrain. 2* Belgrave has had certain conversations with His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin Isa A1 Khalifah,but the month of Ramadhan has precluded any serious discussion of the situation. 3. The death of the late Ruler has eased the situation and should considerably reduce the deficit,even if the whole of the allowance is not allowed to lapse. 4. There seems little reason to doubt that an oil field will be developed,and we may,therefore,reasonably hope for an income to the State from royalties in the not too distant future. financial If Bahrain gets royalties,the pe-rmanent- position will be assured. If Bahrain does not get royalties,something much more drastic than it is possible to suggest at present may have to be done. There are slight signs,moreover,of an improvement in trade. 5. I think,however,that at present we should assume that Bahrain may expect an imcome from oil and also from an improve- ment in trade,and that we should avoid,so far as possible,argument about the small economies: that small deficits for the next two or three years should be met from the reserve: and that,in the mean time, we should concentrate on the all important question of trying to get the Ruler and the 11 Khalifah to accept a reasonable x sliding scale for the Civil List.v\ 2. 6. Perhaps you may wish to discuss the matter on your forthcoming visit to Bahrain. The Hon'ble Lieut .Colonel T.C.W.Powle.C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. /* Copy of a demi-official letter 1^:957 dated the 11th January 1933 from Mr.C.D.Belgrave,Financial Adviser to the Bahrain Government,to Lieut Colonel Gordon Loch,Political Agent,Bahrain. When the question of the State's finances was last discussed,I think it was agreed that the position should be reviewed alter two months time. Two months have passed and in my opinion the position shows no improvement except that during the second month the death occurred of Shaikh Isa,who received Rs.5,000/- per month from the Civil List,and two or three thousand rupees on various Eids etc.. If Shaikh Isa's pay was not continued the State would save slightly over Rs.60,000/- per annum; at present according to the figures for eight months the State will be faced with a deficit of about Rs.75,000/- on the amount budgetted as Revenue. When Shaikh Isa died innumerable relations and retainers assumed that his allowance would be divided among them and clamoured for the money from Shaikh Hamad. The real financial position is only realised by Shaikh Hamad and his brothers and Shaikh Salman; the rest of the Khalifah deliberately blind themselves to financial facts. Shaikh Hamad has agreed not to make any alterations in the Civil List without consulting the Political Agent. Although his acceptance of this suggestion is,in writing somewhat vague, he himself quite realises that he agreed to it. After discussing the matter with me,we came to the con clusion that it would not be in contravention of the arrange ment with the Political Agent to expend the amount of Shaikh Isa ? s allowance for the ten days of the month before he died. This amounted to slightly over Rs.1,500/-. The money was handed to Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa who distributed it according to his discretion among some of the various relations ana others who are supposed to have been in receipt of allowances2. i/b from the late Shaikh Isa. Shaikh Isa f s widow received Rs.700/- although 1 understand that she considered herself entitled to the whole amount previously paid to Shaikh Isa. According to the custom of the Khalifah family,which was grudgingly admitted by various interested relations,the property of the Ruler is not subject to Shara Law,but is inherited entirely by his successor. Shaikh Isa^ property passed to Shaikh Hamad. When however the matter was examined,it was discovered that almost all Shaikh Isa T s property,consisting of valuable date gardens and some houses,had been gifted away during his lifetime,a great proportion of it quite recently, and most of the gifts were made to his widow and to a favorite relation of hers who himself owned a very great deal of property. The remainder of Shaikh Isa f s vast estate which passes to Shaikh Hamad is not worth more than Rs.15,000/- per annum,further it was found that all rents and leases had been collected in advance,so until the present leases expire the estate will produce next to nothing. ?ftien,however,Shaikh Isa ? s widow dies, all the property which she holds in gift from Shaikh Isa will revert to the Ruler,Shaikh Hamad,this also is according to the Khalifah family custom, it is very likely that she will endeavour to dispose of it in her life-time,but this is for bidden according to a proclamation issued some years ago forbidding sale of Khalifah property to persons outside the family. Before paying the Rs.1,500/- due to Shaikh Isa,Shaikh iiamad sent Shaikh Abdullah to me to discuss money affairs and the Civil List, ?^e assumed that Shaikh Isa T s allowance was extinct and examined methods for obtaining funds for some of the relations,said to have been dependent on Shaikh Isa,without increasing the Civil List. By making certain Esxt cuts we obtained Rs.543/- per month without making any deductions from the sons or grandsons of Shaikh Isa. Some of the people who3. suffered deductions neither lived in Bahrain nor are they members of the Khalifah,two others it was found had died,but their salaries continued to be drawn -r Unfortunately their payments were very small. I was informed that Shaikh Hamad approved of the suggested Ettsx cuts but thought they might be postponed until next year when conditions might improve so liiuch that they would not be necessary. In the meantime having obtained the Rs.1,500/- the matter has been allowed by him to drop. I make the following suggestions 1. From the beginning of next year the Civil List should depend on the revenue for tne previous year,and should not be a fixed amount independent of revenue. A maximum amount should be settled. Or,as has been suggested,|here should be a fixed amount with something in the nature of a bonus depending on the increase of revenue. 2. For the last three months of this year the following changes should be made:- Deductions amounting to Rs.543/- per month according to the cuts suggested by Shaikh Abdullah. A cut of 5/b on the remaining salaries with the exception of Shaikh Hamad himself which will amount to Rs.920/-,this total can be made up to Hs.1,500/- per month. The sum of Rs.1,500/- per month,out of the salary previously paid to Shaikh Isa will be paid to Shaikh Hamad who can distribute it as he wishes among the dependents of Shaikh Isa. In this way the amount which was previously paid to Shaikh Isa will be saved. Shaikh Hamad f s own allowance is not unreasonably large in view of the heavy calls which are made upon it and when a reduction was made before he suffered more in proportion to others as certain odd allowances which he used to take were4. cancelled. A reduction at present would,in my opinion,not be a very great iiardship to the other relations* Most of them lire yery extravagantly and the local cost of living has gone down in the last few years to about half what it used to be when the Oivil List was originally settled. All the figures and statistics regarding the Civil List are contained in my letter No:736/SP dated 17th November 1933 and the conditions under which I wrote that letter have not, in my opinion,materially changed.pi ilw tr CtA - / I/O NO : £#0, Office of the Political Hesiaent in the Persian Gulf, Gamp Bahrain,the llth February 1933 To, ^Mp The Political Agent, ^ Bahrain.

The revenue,when compared to the previous month,shows a tailing oif of Rs.15,000/-. During the previous month, however,Rs.10,000/- was received as rent for the Bahrain Oil Concession. Customs receipts in Ramadhan decreased from Rs.62,825/- to Rs.55,254/-. ihe expenditure during the two months appears to be the same,but there are outstanding bills from Ramadhan amounting to about Rs.3,300/-,which raises the actual monthly expenditure of Ramadhan to about Rs.68,200/-. The difference between the actual revenue and the actual expenditure incurred during Ramadhan is about Rs.5,000/-.

Political Agent,Bahrain,Copy Qf^letter rro:1142-S.F dated the 6th March 1933 from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government to the Political Agent,Bahrain. I have the honour to forward statement of revenue and expenditure for Shawwal,the tenth month of the year. There has been another serious drop in the revenue which has decreased from Rs.59^800/- to Rs.43,800/-. After making the payments on the Civil List,which absorbed approximately of the total revenue of the month,only Rs.8,800/- remained for the payment of all other expenses,Police,Education,salaries etc.,etc.,and as funds were unavailable,bills amounting to about Rs.l6,00Q/- were held over for payment during this month,Bhil Qaadh. The expenditure for ten months at the end of Shawwal, has exceeded the revenue for those ten months b^y Rs.55,000/-. This deficit on a Budget of which the total is only Rs.6,58,000/- is a very serious one and I consider that there is no probability of its being reduced in any appreciable degree during the last two months of this year. It is now the eleventh month of the year and next month I prepare the budget for the following year,1352. Assuming that trade conditions are no worse than they have been this year and that the R.E trade is not affected by any politicals other causes,it will be necessary to estimate for a revenue of at the very least Rs.50,000/- less than this year with a corresponding reduction in the expenditure of the State. In the budget of last year,expenditure on headings such as protect ion,public health,education,municipalities etc.,etc., was reduced to the very lowest possible amount,and no further reduction can be made in these essential services without seriously impairing their activities. There remains the question of affecting economies,during the coming year,and balancing the next budget,by reductions in the Civil List. Excluding the amount received by the Ruler himself,a reduction of one-fifth of the remainder of the Civil List would result in a saving of about Rs.5 0,000/- which would balance the-budget provided that trade conditions do not further deteriorate,/: 7^ tp, C's.

Sir, I have the honour to forward a copy of the Budget for the State of Bahrain for 1352. It has been approved and signed by H. 1. Shaikh Hamad. This is the eighth Budget which I have had the honour of presenting. The annual report on Bahrain for 1351 will be dospatehed later, it usually accoiapanies the Budget, but as you required the Budget as early as possible, I am sending it now. The financial position of the State causes me very grave concern; both the new Budget and the figures for the last year reveal a very disastrous condition of affairs and I should be obliged if you would communicate the contents of this letter to the Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.rf ComDariaon 1350 ^ 1351 ♦ The actual revenue during 1351 was Rs 1,20,074/- less than during 1350. This very serious falling off is almost entirely in CustomB receipts# The bulk of imports has decreased greatly and the value of goods imported has also decreased. The people of Bahrain can no longer afford to buy anything except the cheapest coiamodities. Expenditure during 1351 exceeded the revenue by Bs 93,672/-. illthough the expenditure during 1351 was actually less than the amount allocated in the Budget, the revenue fell short of the estimated amount by Es 1,05,302/' Briefly, at the end of 1351, the State was faced with an actual deficit of Es 69,132/-, having also spent the sum of Bs 24,540/- which was carried forward from the previous year. The Reserve Fund at the beginning of 1351 was three lacs; at the end of 1351 it is only Rs 2,50,000/—. This year, for the first time since a budget has been made in Bahrain, I have nad to show a deficit on the revenue side of the budget in order to balance expenditure. It would have been possible, and this suggestion was urged by the Shaikhs during discussions on the subject, to estimate the revenue at an amount much greater than could honestly be expected, in order to balance the budget. In my oninion it would be false finance and would serve no useful purpose. The deficit will be met from what remains of the Reserve.o 7 -3t Reyenue &gt; In last year's Budget, I estimted the rmmm at Is ?,89,600/-. % estimate was incorrect, the actual revonue eolleotel was Is 6,04,^98/- (excluding Es 12,44?/- which was trmsferrod from the Police account to the Coaaolidated Fund) CXiBtopis receipts last year wer© entimated at Rs 7,00,000/-, actually they only produced Bs 6,00,684/-. Owing to the deplorable condition of the pearl industry, the continued decrease in amount and value of imports and the probability, which is now almost a certainty, of Bahrain losing its fUIUtrade, I consider that the most that can be expected from the customs this year is Rs 5,50,000/- which is 1% lacs less than the 'estimated customs revenue for last year, but only Es 50,684/- less than the actual cuBtoms receipts received during that year. The total amount expected from all other sources of revenue is estimated at slightly less than last year*8 total. This amount has been arrived at after careful consideration of the actual receipts for 1351. Bents of Government lands has been somew at increased. Trda item includes the rent from the oil compeny (Es 10,000/- per annum) and also rent of aerodrome. I have assumed that the long deferred payment by the Imperial Airways for the use of the aerodrome will materialise dnring the year. Interest on reserve has disiinished^ the rste of interest is now meh lower than before and the capital has dwindled. A new, but very small, source of revenue is the tax on artesian wells used solely for cultivation.-4- The anount owing by Mohomed bin Subah, chief of the Bin-Aeli, which was lent to him several years ago by the Government, is shown as a possible receipt, but I am extremely doubtful as to whether this loan will be repaid* Mohomed bin Subah has now induced the Ruler of Kuwait to intercede with H. E. Shaikh Hamad in connection with this debt. Should the Bahrain Petroleum Company enter into the mining lease in December 1933 an additional Rs 20,000/- will accrue to the State but as they have now applied for an extension of the Prospecting License I cannot assume that they will pay the extra amount. Expenditure . The expenditure in the new Budget has been reduced to Is 72,100/- 1© bs than the estimated expenditure for the prerious year. Owing to the death of the late Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali, a saving of Es 42,000/- was effected. The monthly emolument which he was induced to accept in the year 1347 was Rs 5,000/- per month. After his death H. E« Shaikh Hamad was persuaded to agree to a monthly payment of Is 1,500/- instead of Is 5,000/~ to be shared by Shaikh Sir Isa f s widow and various other relations. When the time arrived for making the new budget, H. 1. Shaikh Hamad after discussing the matter, instructed me to explain the financial position to Siitdkh ionomed, Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Salman. After several long meetings during which the whole financial position was thoroughly reviewed, the Shaikhs were made to realise that some reduction should be made in the Civil List. Shaikh Abdullah had previously agreed, during informal-5- informal oonversations with me on the subject, that this step was inevitable and essential# Shaikh Salman appreciated the necessity after examining the figures, but Shaikh Mohomea was consistently opposed to any reduction whatever and was only induced to agree to it by his tTfo relations after lengthy arguments. Sheikhs ^bdullah and Salman were at first inclined to make a reduction of 5^ or even 6% but the proportion was eventually reduced to Zjtft which was the most that Shaikh Mohomed would consent to* I suggested that the Ruler's own emolument should not be reduced in view of the necessary expenses per taining to his position; my suggestion was vehemently opposed by the three Shaikhs who declared that their financial obligations,as the three leading Shaikhs of the family, were equal to those of the Buler. This opinion is one which cannot be maintained and it is not accepted by H. S. Shaikh Hamad. H. 1. Shaikh Hamad, with great reluctance, accepted the suggestions, but at the end of the year, when the budget had actually been drafted, he wrote to me and pointed out that both the IIon f ble the Political Resident, and the Political iigent had assured him that his allowances should not be further diminished. In view of his letter when the budget was ready for his signature, I altered the figures and cancelled the reduction effected by the reduction on the amount received by H. E. Shaikh Hamad himself. Eventually the total saving by this 20 out resulted in h 6,000/-, but it must be admitted that the appreciation by the Shaikhs of the principle isis of more lasting value than this negligible sum that has been saved* Economies have been mEde wherever possible in other directions. Sducetion has been reduced by Z%% t savings have been made in some of the departmental expenditure, and these reductions have been accomplished without materially affecting the essential activities of the State but the total amount allocated on the expen iture side, apart from the Civil List, is the very lowest sum with which the State can continue its present functions. It would endanger the state of ublic Security to reduce the newly organised dice 'orce, or the naturs; the sum allocated for medical services is very small in proportion to the needs of the public, in fact if money was available this is a department which more than any other deserves extension; the municipalities too, without their monthly grant of Rs 1,000/- each, which is exactly half the subsidy they used to receive some years ago, would not have suffi cient funds to carry on the very useful work which they do today and which is perhaps one of the most conspicuous advertisements of the improved conditions existing now in Bahrain. In spite of the amount which was saved owing to the death of late Shaikh Sir Isa and the 2#^ reduction on the Civil List, the total sum required to meet the Civil List is Es 3,80,000/- which is 59.8^ of tneestimated revenue and considerably over half the total annual expenditure.-7- I have referred to this matter very frequently during ■ the year when forwarding monthly accounts and it may appear that I am stressing the matter unreasonably, but as it is one of my duties to compose the budget and to be responsible for the finances of this State I should be failing in ray duty if I did not take this opportunity of stating that it is my considered opinion that the finances of Bahrain will never be on a satisfactory footing unless the Civil List is made to correspond, to a certain extent, to the actual revenue, increasing and decreasing according to the income of the State. The proportion was laid down when the State was comparatively wealthy, unfortunately since then the revenue has diminished by half, but a reference to the comparison of revenue and civil list, #iieh I enclose shows that the fluctuations of the revenue have not proportionally affected the Civil List# * I also wish to point out that^is impossible for me myself to persuade the Ruler and his relations to accept a further reduction. In a letter I wrote to the olitioel Agent soae years ago, I explained that owing to my position and work here it was extremely difficult for me to coerce H. 1. Shaikh Hamad into agreeing to a course which he strongly disliked. To endeavour to do so would jeopardise my relations with him. If this State finds itself in serious financial difficulties it will depend upon the Government of India for monetary assistance. Excluding the possibility of increased revenue from oil it appears to me inevitable that within a year or two the State will be approaching a condition of bankruptcy. If the Government of IndiaIndia comes to the conclusion tnat the Uivil List re^uireti readjusting it will be necessary for it to express this opinion very definitely to the Ruler himself # I have advised, and urged and argued on the subject and the only result which has been obtained is a saving of h 6,000/- out of a total of h 86,000/-. I have the honour to be, Sir, Tour most obedient servant, financial Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Eac.CONFIDENTIAL.

The property is adjacent to the government offices.The Pearl Industry. The main features of the 1350/51 season may be susmied up and explained as follows:- 1* The Catch . The catch was small and no large pearls were found by Bahrain divers. One extremely large pearl, of poor quality, was found by a mainland boat and bought by Messrs. Gozaibi Bros. No single pearl caught by a Bahrain boat is said to have realised, at rock bottom priceyaore than is 15,000/-. 2. Boats divin g;. Fewer boats went out and of those that sailed the proportion of Khaaaaa&amp;is greatly increased. The two chief systems of diving ere Selafieh and Khammas. In the former case the Kakhuda is financed by a Taajar, and his divers receive the amount of advances laid down by the State, in return for the financial backing the imkhuda selxs his j^orj-s to liis xuajar. xiie accounts are made up at the end of the season. In the case of Khammamis, the men join a boat and dive for one 'Tershah^ (trip) and accounts are made after each trip. Divers are advanced a few rupees and the cost of equipping a boat for a trip is much less than in the case of Selafieh boats. No debts are carried on from season to season. The Khamamis divers are less subject to their nakhudas* discipline as they are not with him permanently, they go to sea for shorter periods and on the whole their system is less substantial and less organised than the Selafieh system and their catches are usually less important. 3. Pearl prices . Almost all the pearls of the new season were sold and the price of medium and good pearls,I 1 Pearl industry. 8 pearls, 'sherin' was about 80$ higher than the market prioe during the previous season. Unfortunately however most of the big merchants still have on their hands very large stocks of pearls which they purchased three or four years ago, at high prices, which they cannot afford to sell at a loss. If they sold these pearls now, at the market prioe, perhaps for half whet they paid for them, many of them would become liable to make payments which they still owe and which fell due when the pearls are sold. 4. Divers debts . The divera during the last season fared even worse then they did during the previous season. Although the amount of the advances were reduced by the government to the very minimum and owing to the low price of rice etc. the cost of victualling boats was less than last year, out of 354 boats the divers of only 6 boats Selafieh made any profit. The earnings of the rest were not sufficient to cover the amounts ?/hich they had advanced and their share in the cost of rations etc. So at the end of the season the divers had increased their debts to their nakhudas and received nothing except the advances which had been debited against them. Comp arisons between seasons * I have stated before (annual report 1350, page 12) that it is difficult to arrive at an accurate estimate of the season^ takings. The figures which I refer to for the purpose of estimates are those of the authorised diving clerks. These men make up the accounts between divers and their nakhudas, so the prices which they c^uote are the original ^rock bottom t? prices paid for pearls. These clerks have no means of ^ ^-3~ 9 Pearl industry. of knowing about later transactions between nakhudas and taejars or between local iserjhants and foreign buyers and in each transaction the value of the goods increases* The following is e comparison of the last four seasons founded on the sources which I have mentioned above and I have added to it a statement of importations of pearls into United States over four years shc$ ing the three best months of the year which may be of interest# Total no. of Total vtlue Bahrain boats of pearls ♦ registered for in rupees diving. 1347/1348 538 1348/49 509 21,25,000/- 1349/50 504 18,32,000/- 1350/51 456 18,14,000/- ♦ This sum is arrived at by taking an average on the total number of boats diving from the actual sums accounted for by the diving clerks from the boats whose accounts they made up. Only about 3/4th of the boats have their accounts made up by the authorised clerks. Erom this it appears that the average production of a boat decreased by about Zl% from last year^ production.

From this it will be seen that in 1929 the import of pearls during the three months was worth almost -SS' million dollars but the import during the same three months of 1932 was only 162 thousand dollars. Selaf and Te s uam advances . The amount of the Selaf for the last season was decided as usual by a meeting of merchants end nakhudas at Bs 30/- for a diver and fis 25/- for a puller. On Thursday 26th Hay which was the official day for the opening of the season, a serious riot took place in which two divers were killed and several were woundea by shots fired by the nature. At the time of the oourrence I suggested that I should furnish a full report on the matter but I was told that it was not wanted so I did not send one. Should a report on the diving industry be required I have the material available and should be pleased to write fully, or briefly, on the subject shewing the changes and improve ments which have been effected since the introduction of the Diving Beforms. The subject is one which interests me particularly and I should be glad to furnish any information about it. The Tesqam was fixed for the same amount as the Selaf at a similar meeting and it was decided that the next Selaf should also be decided upon and the amount should be announced in the same r-laan that proclaimed theTesqam. This suggestion was adopted and it was proclaimed that the Selaf was to be the same sum as last year. The divers who were the ringleaders of the riot and who were among the foremost of the men who broke into the Police station prison were sentenced to various terms of hard labour, but on the occasion of H. S. Shaikh Hamad'Pearl industry. Hamad's acceBsion celebrations they end various other prisoners were pardoned and liberated. Bahrain diving laws vis-n-vif s other fin If Considerable feeling exists at present on the pert of the Bahrain diving coiamunity over the unequal conditions applied to Bahrain nakhudaa and foreign nakhudas. According to the Bahrain diving laws if a nokhuda employs a diver who actually belongs to sme other nakhuda, even for a few days during the season, the new nakhuda automatically becomes responsible to the original nakhuda for the whole debt of the diver who he has employed, unless the diver has a 'barwa' from his original nakhuda releasing him for the season. It is customary to issue these 'barwas' . In some cases the nakhuda writes on the 'barwa' that the diver is free to dive for the season, in other cases he is released on roba ! ' or'tilth' , by which method the nakhuda employing the diver is bound to deduct l/ith or l/3rd of the diver's earnings and pay it to the original nakhuda. ihis system is well established in Bahrain and works very effectively. '■hen a Bahrain diver however runs away from his nakhuda and dives with a nakhuda in Oman, or Kuwait or elsewhere, without a 'barwa' the Bahrain nakhuda finds that he has no redress. If he follows his diver to Onan and sues he nakhuda who has employed him, the most that he can hope for is that the diver will be made to return to him. In Oman and Kuwait end other Gulf States the Rulers and Courts now declare that as times are so bad they cannot possibly make their nakhudas responsible for the whole debt of a diver who they may have illegallyPearl industry. illegally employed to dive. But when a foreign nakhuda aues a Bahrain nakhuda in the Bahrain courts for employing one of his divers without a n barwa w the Bahrain nakhuda in accordance with the Bahrain diving laws, is forced to pay the whole amount of the diver 's debt to his original nakhuda. Hie .Bahrain naKhudas have no objection to the • I rule being enforced among themselves, in fact^is very necessary in order to prevent nokhudasstealing each other's divers, but they consider that there should be a different rule in the case of foreign nakhudas suing in Bahrain. if, ior example, by Kuwait law a local nakhuda who steals a Bahrain diver is not made responsible for the diver's debt,equally so when Kuwait nakhudas sue Bahrai n nakhudas for taking their divers without 'barwas' the Bahrain nakhudas should not be made res ponsible for the divers' debt but diould be compelled to return the divers. The Bahrain nakhudas want reciprocal measures to be adopted in this matter.Police and Public Security. Police . At the end of 1350, the strength of the Police was 44 Indian Police and 78 Arab Police, during 1351 the coBtplete transition of the Police from ex- Indian Army Pubjabis to a force of locally enlisted men was completed. The Indians rendered very good service to the State and their services were mich appreciated esDecially during emergencies; they were taken on at a time when conditions, particularly public security, were very different to what they are today. When they were enlisted it was imperative that Bahrain should be provided with a force of trained men in as short a time as possible. In those days, seven years ago^ the raising of a local Polio® Force was not considered practicable. Though the Indians supplied a very urgent need as an armed force they were not altogether a success as Police. Yery few learned to speak jarabic, they were not popular among the local people, the climate did not suit them and they were very expensive. In addition to this frequent incidents ocurred which necessitated the dismissal of several batches of men which revealed an unsatisfactory state in the interior discipline of the Force. The new Police focce consists of about 40 men who were serving at the end of 1350 and about 90 men who were enlisted since then. With the exception of one Indian Havildar, who belonged to the original Levy Corps, all the men were enlisted in Bahrain, but they are a force of mixed nationalities including, besides Bahrain Arabs and Shia Bahama, manumitted slaves, local Persians, andPolioe &amp; Public Security, and a sprinkling of Kurds, Iraqis, Swaiiili end Sudanese. iV/o ysars 8go it w&amp;s slsiost impossible to obtsain local men as recruits for the Polioe, now when it is announced that men are being enlisted, fifty or sixty applicants attend the Fort every morning# Several causes have contributed to this changed feeling towards serving in the Police; owing to the general depression many men are out of work, diving is no longer a lucrative profession and local Arabs who did not like to serve with Indians are willing to serve with their own countrymen. Once the ice was broken by a few men enlisting, the new recruits advertised the Police and encouraged friends and relations to join. A large proportion of the new inen are divers but as far as nossible only men with small debts are enlisted; they contribute h 5/- per month from their pay which is h 25/- p.m. to their nakhudas towards paying off their debts and becoming free men. Owing to the number of applicants it has been possible to raise the standard of height and physique and most of the new recruits are physically superior to the old men. In my opinion the best type of men are those of mixed &lt;arab and .african extraction, they have more intelligence than the pure iifrican and are tougher than the local Arab or Bahrani. It was found when the force was reorganised that it suffered severely from a lack of capable N.C.Os and almost all those who did exist were Persians* when the Indian Superintendent of Police completed hisPolice k ublic security his agreement and returned to India his duties were transferred to Ilaji Salman bin Jasim, a Shia Bahrani who has served in the Police since its formation but who previously dealt almost entirely with criminal work. During the celebrations of IL 3. Shaikh Hamad's corona tion he was presented with a third star and his rank is now the equiTalent of a Eusbashi in the Egyptian array or police. Various promotions were also made from the local men. Arrangements were made with the 10th Battalion, Baluchi regiment to lend the State one Havildar, two Maiks and four men as instructors and the training of the recruits has been mainly carried out by them. Their services have been very valuable and owing to their knowledge of the latest methods they are more capable and useful than any of the old II.Q.Os. ^t the same time two N#G#0s and two men of the Bahrain Police have been sent to the 10th Battalion, Baluch Regiment, Karachi, to undertake a nine months' course of training as instructors so that when these four men return they will be able to take the place of the Indians who have been lent to the Bahrain Police. Owing to the need of nen for carrying out duties it is not possible to give the recruits more than six months training except in the case of individual cases who fail in the tests. Their training includes physical drill, bayonet fighting, musketry, arms drill, squad drill and instruction in general police duties. The programme is an abbreviated form of the Indian iirmy recruit training course with certain modifications. It is proposed to train the men in lathi drill if anan instructors^can be obtained froia the Indian Police denartmunt, Yarious innovations have been introduced in the routine including football, route marches and physi cal drill and fouryoung men are being trained as buglers and drummers so that when the olice go on a route march they march to music. The agreement of Captain !• S» Parke, who is now Inspector of Police, Mauritius^ and who held the post of Assistant Adviser and Comandant of Police, termi nated on B5th September 1933♦ From the date of his departure on leave in April last I have undertaken the duties which he formerly carried out. Grime ♦ Considering the general state of want which has been caused by the depression in the diving industry it is sur prising that there has been so little crime during the year. Only two oases of murder oourred and one case of an armed raid on a Bahrani village which resulted in grievous hurt to the owner of the house which was attacked. A local Arab in Manamah was murdered during a quarrel by a Nejdi. The murderer was tried and executed. A young woman who gave birth to an illegitimate child was murdered by her four uncles in Muharraq. The murder took place in the house of the victim f s relations which was closely surrounded by other houses. It appears that she was actually killed in the compound, by stabbing, but although the neighbours heard and were aware of whatPolice and public security. what was happening no attempt was made to interfere. The four unoles buried the girl T s body in the floor of the house and escaped* It is thought that they are in hiding in Kattar, Towards tne end of the year a night attack was made on the house of a Bahrani in Jed All, belov/ Rafaa. After investigations the olice arrested one Isa bin Isa alMullah of Rafaa* The victim hovered for some time between life and death but finally recovered; the accused was tried and found guilty and sentenced to two years hard labour and deportation. The convicted man is a nephew of the notorious Mohomed al Mullah who was sentenced some years ago to penal servitude in India together with several other members of a gang of gunmen who took part in a series of murderous attacks on Bahrani villages, which ware instigated by some of the Xhalifah Shaikhs and who were finally captured after an unsuccessful attempt to assasinate EU E# haikh Hamad The attack on Jed Ali was made by several persons but unfortunately no information was obtained as to the identity of the other men. In this case none of the Ruling faidj-y were implicated* Liquor . In my last annual report I mentioned that there was an increase in the illicit inanufacture and sale of liquor* it few years ago drunkenness was almost unknown in Bahrain but during the last year or two the habit of drinking liquor has increased very rapidly. The habit has been introduced by Jews, Iraqis and by Bahrain subjects who have travelled in ,f wet n countries. H. S* Shaikh Hamad regards the use of alcohol by his subjects with extreme abhorrence and he is greatly concerned because several of the younger members of hisPolice and public security# his own family have aocmired the habit of intemperance. .From the beginning of the yoar I have been dealing with this matter myaelf and by means of rewards I he-ve obtained information which has led up to the conviction Oj about j ortytwo persons for being concerned in the manufacture or sale of arrak which is a potent liquor distilled from dates. Elaborate organisations existed for selling and distilling i-iquor. Usually it was in the hands of a group of men but sometimes it wea done by one or two individuals. They usually owned or rented several houses and constantly moved from one house to the other in order to evade suspicion. The distilling apparatus was kept in one house, usually next door to an empty or tumble down building and other houses and shops were used as distributing centres. Much ingenuity was dis played in disguising this traffic, underground rooms, false walls and wells were employed as hiding places for bottles and apparatus, in one case liquor was sold from a baker's shop and stores of full bottles were kept at the bottom of flour bins and in a disguised oven. The greatest help in ^ee-tisg detecting arrak, and a feature which cannot be disguised, is its strong sour smell and this frequently disclosed its wLereabouts during searches. After making one or two successful night raids the price of arrak rose from Rs per bottle to Es ?/- or sA, and I obtained information that the makers had shifted their activities from the town into the country and were sending in supplies on donkeys to the people who sold it. More inforiae tion was obtained which resulted in raids on three large stills in gardens sorae miles outside Manamah, andPolice and public security^ and in two oi these caaes the principals were arrested although some of the gang were able to escape, Although the courts haTe dealt severely with oases under tne liquor Iew the trade is such s. luorative one that it still flourishes, especially in Muharraq, In that town it is difficult to deal with, because it is under the Batronage of highly placed people. The whole question of liquor is liable to become more complicated with the inevitable advent of more foreigners, apart from Europeans and Americans* Originally permits were issued only to iaiericans and Europeans, now permits are issued to Jews, Goonese and Indians, The local Jewish comrminity asked that they should be given permits, but permission was refused. On this account they resent the fact that certain foreign Jews, Iraqis, are allowed permits. Apart from the foreigners there is a feeling among some of the young jiraba that liquor should no longer be forbidden but as K. B« Shaikh Haraad f s views on this subject are so well known it is improbable that anyone will give voice to this opinion. H. E# Shaikh Hamad's opinion is that Bahrain is a Moslem State ruled by a Moslem Ruler and therefore it should be Mry 1 * but he does not object to Europeans and iaericans being given permits to purchase liquor for their own use.jQdioial - Total number ofoases . 1350 1351 Bahrain Court — 668 528 Small court — 355 605 1023 1133 There has been an increase of about one hundred in the number of cases heard in the Bahrain courts during the year and aik decrease of Bs 2,700/- in the total amount of court fees collected from both courts and also fiom the proportion from fees recovered by the Joint Court which paid to the government. Although the Bahrain oourt sits three days during the week, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.su It is impossible to keep up with the work and there are about 100 pending oases not including some 150 oases which are pending in the Shara courts and the Majlis Tajara. According to the established procedure all cases ere filed in the Bahrain court which distributes them when necessary to the Shara, ^ajlis Tajara and Small courts. The Shara and Majlis Tajara return the cases to the Bahrain court with their findings which are promulgated by the Bahrain court. The small court, whose maximum is Rs 200/- promulgates its own orders independently. A great proportion of the time of the Bahrain court is taken up with land cases, boundary disputes and dis agreements over water rights and claims by the Wakf departments. Although these cases produce little revenue their settlement is of lasting value, .another matter which also takes time is the proving of ownership in cases of sales and land registrations. As an additional measure of proof after proclamation has been(Judicial) been issued celling for claims the court requires the applicants to produce witnesses to establish their rights either by virtue of long residence or inheritance. This extra proof is of value and imBortance and in many oases it has saved minors and women from being cheated by their relations or guardians. iiPDeals * A proclamation was issued at the begin ning of the year laying down a system of appeals. Appeals from the small court are referred to the Bahrain court and appeals from Bahrain court are referred to H. E# Shaikh Hamad himself. Appropriate fees are levied in appeal cases. During the year only twelve appeals were made from judgments in the Bahrain court and in almost all cases the judgment of the court was upheld. Legislation on mortgages and title deeds . An important proclamation was issued during the year by which it was laid down that in the case of mortgages persons who hold government title deeds have a prior right over persons only holding sennads. This order encourages the registration of titles and also prevents further litigation on the question of boundaries, water rights and titles to property which is held as mortgage by claimants in courts. Considerable confusion existed previously as the Shara law and the local custom differed specifically on the matter of priority of claims. By Shara law the mort age was invalid in certain cases unless it had been actually taken into possession. The law made by the government follows more closely the local custom. Siadi case . This case is now entering on its fourth year in the Bahrain court but out of the mass of differentVI - 3 - 22 (Judicial) ' different issues which are involved the greater pro portion have been decided and it is hoped that the case will be finally closed within a few months. The amount involved is over ten lacs and the court has had to deal with some fifty or sixty different issues each one involving lengthy litigation and reaching back over ten or twelve years. Court akils . Several cases ocurred during the year in which it was proved that wakils acting in the courts had misappropriated funds which had been paid to them on behalf of their principals by the court. In the Bahrain court two such persons were sentence to hard labour. The matter is now under considera tion and rules are being framed regarding wakils practising in the courts which will be submitted to 11 H. E. Shaikh Hamad for approval. It is proposed to demand a deposit which could consist of a mortgage on property if cash was not forthcoming, in the case of professional wakils , but persons who appear on behalf of their wives, children or near relations will he exempted from the payment of a deposit. The fees chargeable by a wakil acting for women or minors will be laid down by the court but in other cases the parties will be at liberty to come to any arrangement which they may like to. Shaikh Jasin^s affairs . Last year, on the suggestion of H. B. 1*3 Political Agent the Bahrain court took ver the control of the affairs and property of Shaikh Jasim al- Mehza, the aged ex- ,adi of Bahrain. Owing to his com plete blindness and the unsatisfactory behaviour of some of his relations there was danger of his extensive pro perty being misappropriated. The ^adi agreed that the-4- (Judicial) the government should administer his property end collect the rents hich was done successfully for about a year. Finally however he complained and requested the government to hand back the adminis tration into his hands which was done. Litigation iminediately recommenced and is likely to continue as long as the Shaikh deals with his own affairs. He was however persuaded to register all his property which will ensure its not passing out of hands. A similar case, that of Shaikh Abdulrehman bin Abdulwahab alKhalifah was dealt with by the court which made an arrangement by which one of the Shaikh^ sons should administer thein? father f s property and sub mit the accounts to the court. In this case the father was a very large landowner but in his dotage.Land Registrations. Registrations during 1351 — 457. Sales registered 233 cancellations 13 Gifts 21 Titles 189. .^.-.'-^457 ) ReTenue from above h 5,052/-. The revenue collected from registrations is about Rs 3,000/- less than the previous year f s revenue. This is partly owing to the continued decrease in the value of property and also because for reasons of economy it has been necessary to re uce the staff of this depart ment. There are now only two surveyors and it is impossible to carry out as much work as was done before when four surveyors ¥/ere employed. Apart from the registration of sales and titles, the department submitted renorts with plans on 346 land disputes to the Bahrain and Agency Courts; this work is unproductive of revenue but it entails considerable time and trouble, however it would be very flifficult for the courts to deal with many of the complicated boundary and water right cases without the plans and reports which are provided by this department. Land Settlement . Very little Burvoy work has been done during the year; the district of Shahrakhan was mapped and the district of Sadad, which was started in 1351, was completed. Fish Traps . 598 fish traps were registered during the year, including renewals. Printed forms are now issued for these registrations somewhat similar to those issued as diving licenses. The public as a whole-2 Land registrations. whole mmreciate the registration of fish trails, tiiey have gradually come to regard the possoBsion of a 'paper from the government' as an inviolable proof of ownership although actually in the case of fish traps the annual registration, without registration of title, is not a definite proof of ownership* Government forms * During the year, 13,284 govern ment forms, which are sold for 2 annas each, were issued. No sanads or wakalas etc. are accepted by the courts unless written on government forms. These forms correspond somewhat to stamp duties but until now the amount on the receipt or the sanad does not affect the price of the form. It has been suggested that, as in Muscat, the forms should bear revenue stamps corresponding to the amount of money which is involved. Kh&amp;Hfieh Estates . In my last annual report (page 34) I mentioned a meeting which took place between the Hon'ble the Political Resident, the late Sir Hugh Biscoe, the Political iigent, Bahrain, and H. B. Shaikh Eamad, and Shaikhs ^bdulla and Salman at which it was agreed that according to the family custom of the Ruliiu family, rdfts of land by the Ruler were only -valid during the lifetime of the holder of the gift. On ia* deathjthe property should revert to the Ruler. The matter was thoroughly discussed and unanimously agreed upon by the Shaikhs. This important decision was mentioned in a letter written after the meeting by the Political Agent to H. E. Shaikh Hemad and the matter was referred to again in a public speech made by the Iion'ble the Political26 -3- Land registrations. Politioal Resident during the celebrations on the oocasion of H. !♦ Shaikh Hamad's succession. A few months before the end of the year a test case ocurred. k wife of Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa, who did not belong to the Khalifah family, died without leaving any children. She held two or three gardens which were 'hiba' from Shaikh Isa. These gardens according to the custom reverted to the Ruler. Unfortunately Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa seized this oppor tunity to oppose the previous decision by every pos sible means and he endeavoured to induce some of his relations to support him. .Ithough his brothers and his nephew Shaikh Salman had solemnly agreed that such pronerty should be held for life, Shaikh Mohamad denied that the custom had ever existed. Then innumer able examples were quoted of Shaikh Isa having taken back property which he had gifted after the death of the recipient Shaikh Mohomed tried to prove that each of these cases were governed by particular reasons not by family customs. H. 1. Shaikh Hamad was much displeased by Shaikh Mohomed ? s attitude and by his violent language. Eventually Shaikh Mohomed suggested that if an exception was made in the case of his own property he would withdraw all op-oosition and give the matter his support, provided that he was given a binding written promise that the gifts of land held by him and his sons should be theirs in perpetuity, never to revert to the Ruler. It was finally decided that the matter should be postponed for a month or two; at the time of writing this report no further action has6 i lOl has been taken. If the Rulex- of Bahrain enforces this custom it will assist him to establish his authority over bis family. This authority in days gone by was very great but now it is merely nominal. The custom would ensure that the Ruling Family retained their estates without which they would expect even greater financial support from the State than they now obtain. It midht be suggested, in fact it actually was suggested by Shaikh Mohomed, that the Ruler on the death of some member of the family might take over all his property and leave the family unprovided for. When discussing this point with other members of the IDialifah family they all assured me that public opinion and family opinion would be sufficiently strong to prevent the Kuier fvom adopting such a course even if he was inclined to do so. i —4- Land registrations. f% Educatioiu |0 The progress of education during the year has been satisfactory and no disturbances like those which took place in the past have ocurred# There are now five boys schools and two girls T schools and the total average attendance is 644 boys and girls although 828 are enrolled. Out of the 27 teachers 15 are local and 12 are foreign, the foreign ones being mostly Syrians. There is undoubtedly some feeling among the people against the foreign school teachers but the standard of education is still so low that it is impossible to obtain satisfactory local teachers for the higher pasts in the schools and it is impossible to obtain any local women who are capable of teaching and managing the girls schools. .aUkJ.^umai.j.uja of o ai* aliu uuuiii sckuoxs . jjarly in the year, at the beginning of the present school year, the Government carried out its intention of amalgamating the two boys schools in Manamah. The Manamah girls* school was previously housed in a building which was rented by the Government, the girls* school was moved into what used to be the Sunni boys school. It is a large airy house and suitable for a school, it was purchased as a school by the Government about ten years ago. Screens were put up in front of the windows in order to ensure privacy. The Sunni boys school moved into the big Shia school on the south of the town which was built by the government about three years ago. The school is a very fine braid ing and can hold about 300 boys but at the end of the previous year only about 40 boys were attending and of these ^uite a number were Sunni. The action of the-2- «i5(| Mucation. ol th© t -jOVGrimisnt in coisbiiiiiig tlis two schools v/ss mucix resented by the Shias whose attitude was that of the dog in the manger, for about a year the attendance had been very small and the school was 3/4 empty but at the same time the Shias resented the school being used by Sunnis as well as themselves. It is true that the Shia community had contributed a small proportion of the cost of the building but as the school was open equally to Shias and Sunnis there was no logical argu ment against the Government's action which effected a large saving in expense. Unfortunately only about 40 Shias are attending the school and the remaining 100 boys are all Sunnis. A small private school has been opened by a son of one of the leading Shias which is attended by some of the boys who were previously educated at the Government school. Topical play . At the end of the last term, a play was performed in Arabic before a large audience 'by boys from the two schools. The play was written by the President of the Islamieh college in Beyrout but it was slightly adapted and made very topical. The play dealt with a dishonest 1 fall f who had charge of the property of some minors and the villain of the piece, I believe unintentionally, resembled unmistakably in manner and appearance a certain leading Muharraq. merchant who recently appealed in Court on a charge of misaprropriating the money of certain minors with which he was entrusted. The play was very well and intelligently acted and was altogether a success.tp Mantmah Ifunicipality. . w 0 1350 Revenue Rs 62^00/- 1351 ' 55,000/- ' Expenditure 60,900/- In spite of a falling off in revenue the Manamah Mmioipality has carried out some noticeable improvements in the town during the year# Inner Sea Road * The new sea road running east and west along what used to be the foreshore of the town, inside and parallel to the sea road, is now almost completed at a total cost up to date of approximately Bs 15,000/-. This cost does not include the value of ground given in compensation to owners of property from ?7hom land was taken in order to make the road. The new road will be very useful in the future and has effectively opened up the long strips of private property which extend from the edge of the town down to the original sea road# The road is 30 feet wide and 8verages about five feet in height from the surface of the shore# About 4000 cubit feet of stone were used for building the road across areas which had not been reclaimed from the sea# Bazaar widening . A road running up to the bazaar between the Customs House and the olice Station has been widened and extended and will eventually cut right through the town to the open ground opposite the Fort# This new road is wide and well adanted for motor traffic and several handsome new shops have been built upon it# This road has become one of the beet localities in the bazaar. number of shoDs and offices were pertly demolished in oHer to make the road but whenever possible they were rebuilt by the Municipality, in cases where this could not-2- 1 Menamah Municipality. not be done the ovmevs were eompensated. A wide road running east and west from the Goverrment school to the, sea was made on the south of the town. About 25 barasti huts were moved in order to make the road* Gountry Roads * ixn arrangement was made by which the Municipality became responsible for road work and repairs outside the Municipal area on the main Rafaa road as far as the end of the date gardens end also the Budeya road up to JedHafs. This preTiously was done by the government but as the municipality have a permanent staff of road men it is more econoiaieal for them to do such work. A road was made through date gardens running north and south which links up the Rafae road and the Budeya road. Previously the country bet¥?een these two roads was inaccessible to motor traffic except on the road from Suk al Siaiais to Senabis. The cost of this road was small as it was only necessary to make a fe?/ bridges and to level the surface in places. Widening of Rafaa roa d. On the Rafaa road through the date gardens, there ocurre - during the year an accident in which a taxi collided with a car in which H. E* Shaikh Hamad was driving and overturned it into the ditch. Fortunately nobody was injured but the incident enabled the government to carry out the project of widening the whole road through the gardens which had been under consideration for some years. An average of 15 feet in the width has been added to the whole roed from Suk al Khamis to Raddam al Kawari and mainly owing to the public spirited example set by Shaikh bdullah ll~3~ (Manamah Hiaicipality) ^bdullah bin Isa and some others none of the onvners of the gardens from whom ground was taken demanded any compensation for date trees or land. About 400 date trees were cut dowi but except in the case of two wakf gardens no payments were made^ the fences however were rebuilt at the expense of the munici pality. This road is the most used and most import ant road in Bahrain and owing to its narrowness and its many blind corners it had become very dangerous. It was unsuited to much motor traffic and a particular source of danger were the heavy lorries and tractors used by the Bahrain Petroleum Company which travelled up and down the road several times daily. The new part of the road is now being levelled and the ditches are being filled in. Road work by the Sahrain Petroleuia Go , During the year the Bahrain , etroleum Go. have done a great deal of useful work on the roads which they use and owinc to this the government has been saved considerable expense in the upkeep of roads. it grader has been used very effectively on the Manamah - Rafaa • Sakhir road and a small portion of it has been raised to prevent the usual flooding during the rains. The Company constructed a new road, ¥/ith an oiled surface, from below the Rafaa hill to their camp and on to Al-^oar. iUL-iiJir can now be reached from Llanamah within ^in hour, before the new road was made it took consider ably longer. Petrol 3tore . A petrol store was built at Suwefieh, on the shore about one mile west of Manaaan. The store - is 100 ft x 80 feet, built of stone, cement, iron girders AC H(Manamah Ilunieipality) girders and corrugated iron roof. Bent is paid to the Municipality by importers who store petrol there* According to municipal law shopkeepers are forbidden to store more than a liaite. number of tins inside the town area owing to danger from fire, iirtesian wells . Seven artesian wells within the town were fitted we with valves and upright Dipes according to the government's order. The tanks which formerly held surplus water, and which bred mosquitoes have been demolished and the water is available from taps set along horizontal pipes. Ke-percusaions from dispute . hen news reached Bahrain that the Persian government had cancelled the A»P#0.G agreement meetings were held among the local Persian community and a rumour was spread that Bahrain's supply of petrol and paraffin would be cut off. In half a day the price of paraffin rose to more than double the market price. In order to combat the profiteering the government arranged for the municipality to purchase a large amount of paraffin and sell it at the ordinary price. This was done and price immediately descended to normal. It was after wards stated that the government itself had bought up the paraffin and having made a corner it was selling it at a hi# price. IfuniciDal Ice machine . Ice was manufactured during the summer from electric power and was sold at 4|r pies per pound instead of Ufa 7% ies which was last year f s price. This is considered a public utility service and the municipality contents itself with a small profit after covering all expenses.(Manaiaah !&amp;inicipality} The lengthy disagreement involving H. H. Shaikh Hamad, the Bahrain government and the munioipality with Mr. Yusuf Khunji, the Menohester raerchant was finally settled• Liability for municiDal taxes &gt; A resolution which the government has beei urging on the munici pality for several years was passed by the Majlis to the effect that landlords, not tenants, are liable for the payment of munioipal taxes on their property. It is an achievement to have secured the acceptance of this principle in Manamah, it was suggested in Muharraq, but opposed by almost all the meiabers. .jiti-'&amp;.lfrial measures . A pump worked by an oil engine was kept working for several months pumping the water out from the swamp south of the town into a channel which carried it down to the sea. Two women were appointed to report to the munici pality eases of persons allowing mosquitoes to breed O l C in wells inside their houses. was sprayed onto stagnant water on the south of the town. The council passed orders that all unreclaimed ground adjacent to the sea road should be filled in. Unfortunately these orders were not carried out and it was eventually decided that owing to the general shortage of money the owners could not be expected to undertake the filling in. IfuniciDal warden . The municipal garden, which is much frequented by the public, especially during the summer evenings, has been repaired and put in order* fhe water channels have been cleaned out and cemented so that they are no longer a breeding place for mos~(Manamah ^fmaicipality) W* mosquitoes. The western portion of the garden has been laid out with Deths and trees and bushes have been planted in it# a small zoological garden has been formed which includes ibex, wolves, monkeys, an eagle and a bear, the latter was presented hy Captain Prior after he left Bahrain* It was again proposed that women should be allowed to use the garden on one day during the week but this sug gestion was violently opposed by the majority of the members and by the president himself who, having recently visited London, referred to restrictions which apply in Hyde Park* The council prides itself on its progressive point of view but in this matter it is extremely conser vative. Two small gardens were made in the maidan opposite the Mission church and when these grow up they will form a pleasant oasis in that part of the town* MiBcellaneous . The Municipal offices were repaired and improved, the floors were tiled with locally made tiles end the roof was renovated. Three streets in the bazaar were re-roofed. It was suggested that corrugated iron should be used as being more lasting than matting but owing to the initial expense the project was abandoned. 38,000 pies were imported from India for circulation in the bazaar. The rate taxi fares was revised and tariff cards were issued to all taxi drivers. The slaughter house was repaired. 48 persons were prosecuted for failing to keep their house drains in order.(Manamah Municipality) 50,000 cubit feet of swamp on the south of the town was filled in with town rubbish and earth# ii dozen poor boxes were s^et up in various parts of the bazaar. Contributions are disappointing and consist mainly of counterfeit coins* Rs 2,000/- was spent on the upkeep of the lunatic assylum# 1 tex was imposed on donkeys entering the town. Sheep were imported during Ramadaan and the meat was sold at cost price. During the absence of Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa, on a European tour the duty of resident was undertaken by Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa alKhalifah.^ry I !&amp;iharraq Municipality. \\ 1 Revenue 1350 Es 37,122/- 1351 Bs 33,919/- Expenditure ' 28,916/- * 27,758/- Outstanding against the Baladiya, Rs 3,141./- Loan from Manamah Bal diya — also lis 23,313/- loan from the Bahrain Govt, for installation of electric supply in Muharraq# The expenditure for 1351 includes payment of an instalment, h 7,77l/- due to the Government from the account loaned for electric extension. Very little new work of importance, apart from the usual activities of the municipality such as street lighting, cleaning, repairs to roads etc. has been carried out during the year. Several streets in the bazaar were re-roofel, the pier was resurfaced and some roads were widened and awkward corners were removed. The style of building in Muharraq town is not conducive to ffr road widening as most of the houses are two^three storied and the greater proportion of them are built of stone. The town is congested, surrounded on three sides by the sea, and as there has never been any room for expansion the tendency in the past has been to reduce the width of the streets in order to make more room for houses. There are no maidans or open snaces in Euharraq town and it is partly for this reason that the heat in the summer becomes so excessive that many of the Maharraq people migrate to Manamah during the hot weather. A great improvement has been effected by the filling in of one end of the creek at the Muharraq-2- 11 ? (Muharrak Munieipalitj) !luharrak landing place and the widening of the pier near the customs house, 'art of the reclaimed ground hos been leased out by the municipality on very advan tageous terms* Other work carried out during the year includes the following:- Repairing the sea wall between Muharrak and Busaiteen. Constructing two compounds for donkeys. Before these were made donkeys were left standing or tethered at any place in the bazaar. The drains from several wells running to the sea were repaired. Although most of the artesian wells in Muharraq were made by individuals for the benefit of the public the cost of looking after them is undertaken by the Baladiya. The Government doctor treated 11,953 oases at the Maharaq dispensary. The Municipal nurse had 4,578 clinic patients during the year and attended 19 confinement cases, of which 15 were successful cases*Artesian wells. Twelve new artesian wells were sunk in Bahrd n during the year. The question of the governments control over arte sian wells and the prevention of waste of water and the elimination of stagnant water in which mosquitoes breed has been under consideration for some time. In Septr. 19S2 # Major Holmes of the Bahrain etroleum Co., expressed his views on the subject in a letter to H. S. Shaikh Hamad. Ab the expert ?/ho first boreu wells in Bahrain he pointed out the danger of re^itcin^ the crater nr^ly end the pressure by promiscuous drilling and unrestrained flow of water. The matter was discussed and finally the Bahrain Govt, issued a proclamation laying down the conditions under which wells could be sunk which are as follows. No more wells are allowed in Manamah, Muharraq, Hidd, or Galali as these towns are well supplied with water. All wells must be provided with valves and overflow pipes so that the overflow can be regulated and when not in use the ¥/ater can be turned, off. Minimum length of pipe to be used in the well is 90 feet.

It is hoped that these regulations will have the effect of preventing waste of water and in reducing the amount of mosquitoes.Agriculture. Unfortunately no real progress has been made in this direction during 1351, The serrices of Mr. Said Abdul Hour who was obtained in 1930 from the Department of agriculture, Iraq., were dispensed with during the year. Owing to leek of money it was impossible to utilise the services of this official to the best advantage* No funds were available for purchasing trees or for carry ing out experimental work and the cotton crop which was planted last year was not grown again, it was proved however that cotton can be grown in Bahrain successfully. The services of an agricultural expert would undoubtedly be o# great benefit to Bahrain but at present they cannot be afforded. Orange oultivation , a few of the orange trees planted in E« S. Shaikh Hamad's garden, Sanayan, on the Mani road, were allowe to bear fruit and the oranges ripened successfully and were of exceptional size and of good quality. The trees are growing well and in the spring of 1S51 about one-third of the trees blossomed and many of them are now bearir^g young orange®. It can be definitely assumed that oranges can be grown successfully in Bahrain and if private individuals would experiment in this direction they would find a ready market in the local bazaar and possibly in neighbouring Gulf ports. Private enterprise . Cultivation is gradually increasing all over the island but the nature of the cultivation remains conservatively the same and consists entirely of dates, lucerne and a few species of localAgri culture. local TOgetablss. Only a fa^ people such as Khan Saheb Yusnf Xanoo and Xhan Bahadur ibdul kzi% Gozaibi import new Tarieties of trees or experiment with seeds. The family of Arsjyad recently purchased a large area of ground behind the Fort and this has been planted out with date trees. It is irrigated by an artesian well* Date crot) . The date crop of 1351 was considerably better than the crop of 1350. Bahrain was not visited by locusts and the trees did not suffer from any date desease. Storm damage . An unusually severe storm ocurred towards the end of the year which did a great deal of damage in the gardens. Several thousand date palms were torn up by the roots or snapped in two. It is impossible to arrive at an estimate of the damage but in one garden alone containing about 600 trees 78 were destroyed. The average value' of the crop from one tree can be taken as Es 3/- and if the value of a full grown tree is calculated at 10 years produce the loss in this garden alone amounted to over its BOOO/-. Unfortunately the tallest and the finest trees were the ones most affected as owing to their height they were more exposed to the wind. The indications of the new date crop are satisfactory and the abnormal amount of rain does not appear to have caused any harm to the young dates.Sunni Wakf Department. Expenditure on this department . during 1351 Bs 2,400/^« This department, though its staff are paid by the government, is not under the direct supervision of the government and nothing is known of its activities. The ©balance sheet of the department is as follows.- Balance from 1350 — 1,37l/- Outstanding debts at end of , year 135® 10,567/-. Revenue 1351 Il^nnn from shops k amaras 11, gardens 10,941 . garu —1— 22,918/- Expenditure 1351 Imams, Mueddins, ^ n „ &amp; teachers etc. 18,olb Repairs to shops garden ___658 a0iU7/ _ Balance in hand end of 1351 2,754/- Outstanding debts rT 11,385/- The annual report of the depaBtment sho?/s that 666 date trees were planted and about 6 shops were built or rebuilt and 15 shops were repaired.Shi a Wakfe. ^ ' Revenue 1350 - 18,330/- 1351 - Es 20,220/- Expenditure * 17,73b/- n 20,993/- Outstanding debts due to department end of 1351, approximately Rs lO^OQU/- The olections for the new majlis which began at the end of 1350 were completed early in 1351 and the new Majlis held its first meeting after Muharanu as usual the department was emberassed by the incessant quarrels among the various antagonistic factions of the Shias. Towards the end of the year a Katifi mullah of Bahrani origin organised r public attack on the w akf d^art^ent end produced a number of public petitions, of doubtful authen ticity, asking that the majlis should be dismissed and that the government itself should deal m th all Shia wakfs. The agitation was undoubtedly encouraged by one of the Bhia Kadis, Shaikh .di bin Hassan, partly under the misguided impression that such a request would be pleasing to the government. Many of the genuine signatories to the peti tions were persons who ?/ere in debt to the department and who probablv believed that by upsetting the raajlis they would escape their liabilities. a proclamation was issued by the government stating that no change in the administration would be considered until all the outstanding rents had been recovered* It was hoped that as all the members were elected by the public themselves such inci dents as this would not have oouri -ed but the Baikirua, as they admit themselves, have such a love^intrigue that it is unlikely that they will ever refrain from conspiring against a majlis which consists entirely of their own people.~2- Shia fakfs. During the year fifteen wakfs were discovered which had not been rogiatered in the department and these ore now being administered by the majlis. .about 30 mosques were repaired and work was done in 68 gardens and ov er 1700 young date trees were purchased and planted in wakf property# Several small gardens were purchased in order to consolidate wakf property and t ?/o pieces of ground were sold at a very advantageous prices and the proceeds were used to buy a more productive garden then the ones sold. xue work of registering the titles of alx wakf property in very slow and whenever an oppor tunity occurs the Sunni neighbours to the Shiae Wakfs endeavour to prove a counterclaim. 1&gt;4During the last month of the year all the government accounts for the preceding eleven months were audited, by a chartered accountant from the firm of Ihinney Murray k Uo. f Y;ho have an agency in Baghdad. This is the first time that any accounts of the Bahrain Govern- ment have been audited. If funds were available I should recommend that an audit should take place annually. It was impossible owing to the cost to afford the time to carry out a complete audit on commercial lines but sufficient detail was checked to satisfy the auditor that the accounts were properly kept and the systems were satisfactory. it number of suggestions were made which have been adopted since the beginning of the new year. The auditor reported very ^atisfaotorily on the accounts of all departments with the exception of the Slectric Supply department. The gist of the report on the various departments was as follows;- Bahrain Govt . Consolidated fund and Deposit account. Books well and accurately kept, no alterations recommended. Suggested that printed ff payslips !T should be introduced to be signed by the adviser authorising payments in place of a signature on office notes. State Police . The separate account kept by the Police has been closed and the Police account is now merged into the Consolidated Fund. i*n imprest account has been opened with the Police and all payments outside this account are made from the Consolidated Fund direct. tuere is at present no Police Officer the new arrange ment is particularly convenient.A new system was laid down for keeping the Police clothing account. PassDoi-t department . The system of accounts was slightly altered. Govt, provident fund . Books well kept and no alteration recomended, entries checked. Customs departinent . A few minor suggestions were made. ^The whole system of the accounts, v«hich combine simplicity with sufficient detail to enable the Director of Customs to exercise constant supervision over all departments, appears to us to be admirably suited to its purpose and we do not think any departure from the present procedure is desirable.** The report on this department is particularly satis factory 88 it has frequently that the customs accounts were unnecessarily complicated and that some of them were not actually required. Bohrain Electric Supply . Payments were checked with out difficulty but there was considerable difficulty in reconciling the receipts in the cash book and subsidiary books and the Bank pass book. A deficiency of appro ximately Rs 400/- was found between the Sundry debtors account and the detailed list of debtors. It was not suggested that any misappropriation of cash had ocurred but from the state of the books it would be impossible to discover any such misanpropriotion. The reason is ascribed partly to the fact that some of the accounts were kept in the State ngineer's office and some of them in Adviser's office. On the advice of the auditor the whole syate® ana aecou-uts have oeen reaiTau^ed ^nd various changes have been made in the method of collecting-s- ^udit* collecting etc which are described in the report on the .lectri Supply department. Manamah k Huharrau ^uniciDslities . Books were well kept but unnecessarily complicated. A simpler system was suggested. A number of observations were made on the various accounts in the ledger such as the necessity to provide for depreciation in the Ice machine account. In Muharraq Baladiya it was remarked that a number of debit balanceswere due from members of the Majlis, (including the President) which were not authorised in the minutes of the majlis. The control and check over receipts from House and a^^taxe© is inadequate. A new and more efficient system was su^ested. Tuis is a xruxtter of iiaportanofe as the greatest part of the Municipalities 1 revenue is from these taxes. Shia TJakf deuartment . There are over 1,800 different accounts in this department and it was impossible to check all of them in the time available. The cash book, receipts etc. were checked and various suggestions made to simplify the method of keeping the accounts.Imperial Airways. |&gt; On 6th October 1932, the first machine of the Imperial idrways landed in Bahrain on the R. a. P# landing ground behind the Palace. The machine sunk into the ground and was only able to rise, next day with great difficulty. From then onwards the Imperial airways used the fcharraq plain as an aerodrome and agreed that they would pay whatever fees or rental were decided upon when a definite agreement was made between the Company and the government, the payment was to ooMidfeiice iroiu tue ciat^ on wliicn tne aerouxome was first used. Innumerable officials of the Imperial Airways and the R.ii.f officers visited Bahrain, discussed the proposed agreement end examined sites for aerodromes. Several draft agreements were produced and have been the subject of correspondence but so far no agreement has been made and no decision has been arrived at as to where the permanent aerodrome is to be situated. The Government of Bahrain while appreciating the benefits of the Air service is not prepared to allow the company free facilities for landing and it consi ders that the company should pay to the government a reasonable amount, either annually or for each lending, similar to the fees charged in other countries. Rr the last eight months the government has provided a Police guard on the aerodrome on each occasion that a machine has landed in Bahrain. fhe lenrrtfely delay on ^hr -art o* 1 the cors^ariy in coming to any arrangement is thought by the government to be somev f hat unreasonable.Press propoganda. I'here appears to be a al ight decrease in the press propoganda referring to Bahrain in the .sab and Persian newspapers owing perhajis to the regulation which forbids newspaper co respondents to enter the country unless they have previously obtained permission to do so, A long series of ably composed articles were published in the ^Iran' tracing the history of Bahrain and its connection with Persia from the earliest days until the present tirae» Tje articles showed signs o^ considerable research both in T&gt; ernian and /rab histories and in European writings and by judiciously emphasising certain points and almost ignoring other points the writer succeeded in making the ersian claim to Bahrain appear very substantial. To anyone however mho was acquainted with the ources from v/hicn the writer obtained his information and also many sources which he deliberately ignored it would be apparent that the perspective of his historical summary was incorrect and leant unduly in the Persian direction. To quote an example; the writer refused to admit that Bahrain belonged to the Portuguese. lie states that Honau? was originally a tributary of Persia and was occupied by the . ortuguese. TJe Portuguese sent a force from Hormuz and took Bahrain but they took it not top tiitiiiisui-Ves but ior aiOxmuz anu. beoau&amp;»&amp; uoiwxz was originally a tributary of Persia therefore Bahrain was taken by the Portugese for Persia. The articles caused a great deal of interest in Bahrain especially among the Persian community.Counterfeit coins, A serious state of affairs has ocurred during the last year owing to the alarming increase in counter- jfaLtLCcA lytAri* Li/A feit^rupees which have found their way into Bahrain, ikrae or four y^ars ti^o xt was oomparati vexy uiiusual to discover bad coins in the market but today it has been estimated that as many as of the rupees in currency are bad ones. For over a year every coin which is re ceived either by merchants or in offices is tested by ringing on stone or metal before it is accepted. The matter is further complicated by the fact that the Bank, quite rightly, refuses to accept suspicious coins not only coins which do not ring true but also coins which are obviously counterfeited# The local mople only know and admit one method of testing coins and that is by ringing them and only a few foreign merchants and Indians can distinguish counterfeit coins by their appearance. The matter has been fruitlessly discussed at great length by the two Municipal councils whose vie?/ is that the Bank and all Government offices should be made to accept every coin except those whose ring is obviously false. This roint of vie^ is one ^hich cannot be accepted by the Government. a suggestion was made that the Government should levy ± * * a special tax on all specie and coins imported and with the fund obtained by this tax it should buy in all counterfeit coins. This would encourage the traffic of counterfeit coins at the expense of the Bahrain tax payer. Another suggestion was that Indian currency notes should be introduced but as the lowest denomination ofCounterfeit coins. of paper money in India is five rupees this proposal would not solve the problem. It was also suggested that the Bahrain Ikivernment should establish its own currency of one rupee paper notes. In order to establish a currency a reserve fund would be necessaiy and this at present cm scarcely be said to exirt.«2 Death of Shaikh Sir Isa bin iJ.i, aocesaion of li. S. Shaikh Homed bin Isa lis Excellency Sheikh Sir Isa bin idi alKhalifah, i.. G. I. ij,, C. S« l» f died suddenly on 9th December 193E. He was of great age and had been in failing health ior laauy years. He died in the early morning while H. Li. Shaikh Ham&amp;d was out hunting in the south of the island. It is a significant fact and caused considerable comment that the widow of the late Ruler gave orders that the funeral should take place at once, without waiting for 11. iii. Shaikh liamad to arrive. H. K. Shaikh Hamad reached the cemetery a few minutes before the ceremony was completed. Shaikh .Mullah bin Isa was on a visit to the mainland and Shaikh Sulman, who was at his country house, arrived at Muharraq after the funeral. Owing to the unsuitable haste with which the arrangements were made no Police or officials attended end many of f he chief ^halifah Shaikhs rere unable to arrive in time. ii. E. Shaikh liamad f s accession was celebrated about two months later. The principal event was a Durbar, the biggest which has ever been held in Bahrain, which took place in the great hall of the Government school, 9th February 1933 (14th Shawaal, 1351) at which the Hon T ble the Political Resident delivered to His Excel lency a 'Ehsrita' from His Excellency the Viceroy con gratulating him on his succession. The Kharita was received with a salute of &amp;&amp; guns and at the close of the proceedings a salute of 100 guns was fired. His Britannic Majesty's Political iigent, representatives of the Navy and Air Force, the European and American com-Aecession of Shaikh Ham d. comnunity and about 500 the leading Arrbs, ^adis, merchants and notables attended the Durbar. At the close of the proceedings all Shaikh Hamad*8 subjects, including the chief men of the various ^.rab tribes, did obeisance to him as Ruler by kissing his forehead according to the iLtab custom. For three days there were unprecedented and uniyersal rejoicings; thousands of poor people were fed outside the Palace, tribal dances were performed, and the tov/ns ?/ere decorated and illuminated* H» E« Shaikh iiamad succeeded to the estates of his father which consisted mainly of date gardens but as the late Shaikh had gifted away most of his valuable property towards the end of his lifetime the value of H. E. Shaikh Kamad T s inheritance was comparatively small. j± vast aeoumuiation uf official letters ana corres pondence which was found in H. Ji. Shaikh Isa f s boxes were brought to the Government office to be sorted and examined but as it includes about 40Q0 documents it has not yet been possible to deal with them. All Shaikh lsa f s personal belongings, which are reputed of great value, were taken over by his widow who is the daughter of Shaikh ohommed bin Khalifah who died in exile in the Hejaz. Towards the end of the year H. LU Shaikh Hamad 1 s salute was increased from 7 to 11 guns.e&gt;4 |lM Economic depression continues to affect the revenue of this department. Owing to the conti nued depression the number of wiring orders which were received were less than was expected when last year ? s annual report was written. The revenue from sale of energy would have been greater, if many of the public, for reasons of economy, had not substituted their 40 or 60 watt lamps for 5 watt lamps made in Prermany and Japan. However in spite of these circumstances there is an increase of Es 5,000/- in the revenue from sale of energy during 1351 and the profits from wiring, in spite of a reduction in the cost per Doint, are only about Rs 600/~ less than during the previous year. Running costs in 1350 amounted to Rs 37,300/- approximately and in 1351 to Es 38,000/- approximately not including depreciation which amounted to Rs 22,473/- in 1350 and Rs 20,796/-, in 1351, During 1351 the actual loss, apart from deDre- ciation, was h 5,800/- approximately, but this amount includes, in the exDenditure, Rs 2,704/- being the payment for insurance of the machinery, and also about Rs 1,200/- paid to the Customs department in dues on material imported. It was found at the end of the year that outstand ing debts owing to the department amounted to Rs 7,246/-. The department found it increasingly difficult to col lect the amounts from nearly 400 different houses and khops in Manamah and Muharraq. In many cases the-2~ 1^ (Bahrain electric supply) the meter readers and collectors had to call four or five times at the same house before being allowed to see the meter and before obtaining money. It was decided that from the beginning of the new year the system of collection would be altered and con sumers would be called upon to pay their bills at the Government office instead of paying them to house to house collectors. Persons owing debts were threatened with being cut off and prosecuted and by using somewhat drastic measures most of the out standing amounts was recovered. It is hoped that the new system will be more effective than the old one. The report of Mr. B. Steele, State Engineer, is as follows:- The Bahrain Electric Supply department has again been seriously affected by the general economic depression, but the returns for 1351 show a marked increase in revenue, and the financial position is more favourable than it was at the end of 1350. The following extra load has been connected during 1351. 457 points making a total of E2 Kilowatts, of which 267 are light points and 190 fan points and heaters etc. lour refrigerators and and three^water pumps have also been connected making a total of 23 Kilowatts. Revenue from connectel load during 1351 was h 27,462/- as compared with Rs 22 ,185/- in 1350. During the year 116 houses were wired, 96 in Manamah and 20 in Muharraq. Wiring contracts.— Tiring has proceeded steadily during 1351, end the price per point has been further reduced, ana is now as low as economically possible. It has been kept low in order to encourage the public to take electricity. In some cases houses have been wired as low as Rs 14/- per point using Callenaers 'Kaleeco' wire and fittings, the cost per point depending on the distance apart. In connection with the sale of electrical appli ances and wiring (and consequent consumption of(Bahrain Elee. Supply) -3' of electricity), a showroom has been opened on the see road, in a central position opposite the Eastern Bank| and in a thoroughfare which promises to be the leading street in the town of lanaiaah, New offices have also been opened on the same site, the premises which are the property of H.E.Shaikh Hamad, haying been rented by the department. Ice Plant,— The Municipal ice Dlant was run very successfully during the summer of 1351, and at the end of the run the plant was given a complete overhaul. The chief components of the ammonie compressor were renewed, such as the piston, cylinder, bearings, valves, etc., tnis being necessary on account of the age of the plant, which was practically worn out. Owing to the plant having only one compressor, it ha»« to run continuously for approximately four and half months during the season. The question of purchasing a second compressor should be seriously considered for the season of 1353. Consumption.— The revenue from the sale of electri city would have been much more, but for the fact that a large number of consumers changed their lamps from those supplied, originally, 40 or 60 watts to 5 watts. These are German and Japanese lamps obtainable in the local bazaar, and give just enough light to see by, provided thai one has good eyesight. They seem now- ever to suit very many of the local consumers, parti cularly those of the poorer class. It has been pointed out that if this practice increases it would call for an increase in the price of the unit to counteract the loss in revenue. Transmission losses.— Units lost in transmission during the year amounted to 18,5% as compared to 23#4/^ during 1350. This is due to the increased load and to 'the fact that transformers were switched out whenever possible during the winter. Fuel &amp; Lubricating oils.— Fuel oil costs per unit are slightly lower, .25 annas per unit as compared with .SS in 1350. due to the purchasing price of the oil being slightly lower, and the load slightly more. Lubricating oil cost per unit .1 annas as compared to ,09 annas 'is a little higher, due to having to run the plant on certain days every week duringthe winter months for the benefit of the Imperial Airways. This necessitates considerable extra starting and stopping. Xs- Normally the plant is closed down daily between the hours of 9-30 a.m. and 3-30 n.m. from November to April each year, but Imperial Airways Ltd. having installed a wireless station in Manamah in connection with the landing of x their machines, applied # for current on the day (or days) on which a machine arrived.-4- (Bahrain Elec, Supply) Althougi under no obligation to supply this, the govern ment, m order to help the Imperial airways as much as possible, agreed to run when required, which very f often meant two or three days a week, due to the idr mails being late on account of bad weather. Public telephones.— The government of Bahrain, in conjunction with the Manama^ Municipality, decided to instal a telephone system in the tovm of-Manamah, using a central ^change. This scheme has been carried out by the electrical department and at the end of 1351 twenty lines had been connected and two were in course of erection. The scheme has proved a great convenience and as time goes on, the local exchange will probebly be linked with the Bahrain Petroleum Coy f s camp, which is at the nearest point some fourteen miles distant. The Gamp already has six internal telephones and will in time have many more. It is also hoped that enough subscribers will.be^ forthcoming in the town of Muharrak to warrant running a trunk line across the sea» Until now only two a^plications have been received from Muharrak. Two rates are available to subscribers, one a flat rate of 150/- per annum and the other Rs 45/- per annum plus one anna a call of six minutes duration. The former is the most popular. Prospects for lS52.-~ iilthough it is difficult to make a forecast at present, it can reasonably be assumed that wiring, (with consequent additional load; will ■nroceed, if not faster, at the present rate, during 1352. It is also hoped that the sale of appliances will increase. Should the economic situation become easier, then many more consumers will come forward. There are enough potential consumers in Manamch ^nd Muharrak to make the undertaking a good paying propo sition, but the universal cry is that they at present have no money. General.— The department carried 9ut all the govt, car repairs as heretofore, and in addition to the wiring' contracts in Manamah end Muharrak, carried out the wiring of the new offices, etc. of the Banrain Petroleum Go. at the Jebel Dukhan and their telephone system. A durbar was held in Manamah during the month of Shawaal 1351. in honour of H.S.Shaikh Hamad and for three days the town was illuminated some 700 extra lights being erected on public and private buildings.Customs, The following report has been provided by ;*r. C. C» L. DeGrenier, the Director of Customs. ReBort on the Customs and revenue collections for the year 1351 ...H^eth l^ay 1332 to 25th April 1933) In comparison with the Budget estimates the coir lections were.- Budget head Estimated collections Actual collection Remarks. Customs k Import Yard 6,57,000/- 5,41,952/- Vehicle Licenses 2,500/- 4,614/- Pearling Licenses 35,000/- 40,260/- Craft registrations 2,500/- 3,569/- Miscellaneous (Tobacco Tax) 3,000/- 4,491/- Es 7,00,000/- 5,94,886/- Total deficiency Rs 1,05,114/- In regard to the above, the deficiency in the actual Customs receipts can be attributed partly to the world trade depression (which has now reached an acute stage), and partly to the local effects of several nearling seasons when the local Taelirs have been unable to dispose of their stocks, or to collect the proceeds of their disposals. This may be partly their own fault, as the Taajirs, who had been enjoying consid rable prosperity were warned that in future prices would fall; but the warning does not seem to have been heede : , and consequently certain^local Taajirs felt compelled to go as far as Paris to sell their pearls, where they met with varying success. Thus there is a very definite lack of ready money available for general trading* But the most importent factor in the decline of Customs receipts has been the decline in the whole sale prices of the staple commodities imported here. The following comparison should be of interest.2- |U^ 63 Comparative statement of values of chief oommodities. Commodity.

Thus in 1350. nine- tv~fxve steamers (of which eightytwo were British) dis charged here 4,52,250/packages; while in 1351, one hun dred and four steamers (of which ninetytwo were British) discharged here 3,38,881 packages, a decrease by one quarter of the previous year's quantity. Thus, the fall in the customs receipts is due to a decline in imnorts both in quantity and value. One interesting point to note is the degree to which, in the past year, Japanese goods of ail kinds have entered the local markets. iipart from one or two local Jewish traders who imDort in small but steady-4- another interesting point is the increase in tne quantity of artificial silk piece goods here# These come almost entirely from Japan; and are reasonably good m quality, very cheap m price and attractive in appearance. These goods have found a ready market here and are particularly favoured for re-export to tUe Mainland of jirabia. although for religious reasons the wearing of pure silk Roods is not annroved there* It nas naturally followed that the trade in Manchester cooton piece goods has relatively suffered; and this is an interesting fact to record in view of my report on the local niecegoods market of three years ago. ihe quantities of cereals and coffee are reasonably constant and mean that local merchants are buying against sales instead of, as heretofore, accumulating large stocks in a speculative manner against the possible needs of the pearling season. For two years there ^ a ? 110 ST)eG i a l B.I.S.N.Coy rice steamer here from Calcutta, and the merchants* requirements are now brought forward by transhipment via Bombay. If we compare actual receipts (as distinguished irom Budget Estimates) for the past two years, we shall fmd:- Comparison of receipts. Year 1350 1351. Steamers cargoes .. .. Rs 2,73.578/- 2,94,400/- Native craft .. 93,69l/- 81,870/- Parcels duty 9,234/- 16,519/- Passengers baggage .. 15,182/- 19,470/- Export duty . .. .. 2,352/- 1,913/- duty on R.E. cargo 38,052/- Miscellaneous fees .. 9,404/- 7,662/- Re-export duty .... - 2,345/- Import Yard charges 1,78,197/- l,53,38l/- The above comparison of facts is interesting in view of the fact that on the 1st Maharam 1351 (corres- ponding with the 6th May 19S2) the current flat rate of ImDort Duty of five per cent ad valorem was changed to seven-and-a-half per cent ad valorem UDon a small list of articles which might Derhaps be termed •Luxury' imports. This list was compiled with the adviser's approval after very careful consideration, working unon the prin ciple of doing nothing to increase the coat to the Public of food commoaities. Later in the yeer, namely 4th Ramadhan 1351 (corresponding with Slst December 1932) the rate of seven-and-a-half per cent upon these conmo- dities was further increased to ten per cent, except upon alcoholic liquors and tobacco and its manufactured products, which were increased to fifteen per cent ad- valorem. In regard to these increased, which were made with considerable reluctance, it is good to note that they were accepted by the mercantile community without anv comment except perhaps a little surDrise that they had not been imposed earlier; and, indeed, at the present time the importers are expecting that: the rate of ten per cent ad valorem will be applied to imports of all kinds, as the necessity for raisingraising revenue is yiite understood* It is however interesting to remark that the only comment on this change of duty came from a British firm whose imports are quite unimportant in value to the State ? and. even so, such imports are for certain 'permitted 1 persons in a commodity which is admitted only bv a special # concession by H, J,, the Ruler. The comment resolved itself into the suggestion that imports whose invoices were dated prior to tne date of the change in duty should be admitted at the urior existing rates, accompanied with the curiously ingenuous state ment that such was the custom according to 'interna tional law T I These changes inthe rates of import duty explain why the total collections, above, of duty from steamers* cargoes is larger in 1351 than in 1350; and same may be analysed thus:- Collections § 5/L -- Rs 2.50.346/- 7i$ 23 833/- 10f — 16,118/- 15f — 4 103/- Rs 2,94,400/- If. however, the collections for the year 1351 had been all at the rlat rate of five per cent ad valorem, this item of Rs 2,94,400/*- would have been 2,75.662/-, e difference of h 18,738/- and it is this figure which enables one to form a just comparison between the two years. It will be remembered that the rate of lifo was m force for nine months, and the rates of ten oer cent and fifteen per cent were in force for three months only; and they have nroduced an increase in the receipts of Rs 18,738/- only, a fact which seems to justify the ex pectation that the ten per cent rate might with fair ness be applied to all imports except tobacco etc., and alcoholic liguors, which I suggest could easily bear a duty of 2b| ad valorem. The changes in the rates of duty, however, have had a more marked effect in the case of collections unon postal parcels; the sum of Ks 16,519/- is made up thus:- Gollections § 5%, - xu&gt; 2.066/- ^ 7i^ - 8 500/- « lOf - 5,903a- * 15/1 - 50 A 16,519/- If the flat rate of five per cent had been main tained, this figure would have amounted to Rs 10.702/- only; out so Barked a difference is to be expected, since articles of the luxury ijve are more likely to come hereas parcels than as general cargo. Although the quantity of aarcels have considerably decreased in the past year. The same remark may justly apnly to passengers' baggage but it is not quite so pleasing to see a decrease in the collections for Export Duty which is collected upon dates and pearl shells. The inference is that less dates were exported, which was to be expected, as\%&gt; [ as people in general, especially the poor, are consum ing^ more dates and fish and much less imported meat than formerly. The decrease in the Import Yard collections is consistent with the decrease in the quantity of cargo imported. It will be remembered that in the year 1350 a sys tem of ^refunds' was initiated, under which the local importer ^vas permitted to exercise an option in regard to his import, as to whether or not he might re-export it to the mainland ports of Arabia, on similar lines with the R.E. system, which is regulated by High Autho rity. Having duly proved the re-export of the import, the' importer v/as granted a refund of the difference between the amount of duty ure-Daid and two per cent ad- valorem. I am glad to report that the working of this 1 optional ? system (as it became known) was very much appreciated oy the merchants and it v/as extensively used especially by the Hindu community who otherwise were greatly hampered in their mink nd trade. Unfortunately for the Customs, however, the work of checking the returns and making the refunds developed so considerably as to become a very definite and equally unremunera- tive section of the office work;, and to keen the refunds untodate has proved a difficult task especially v/hen one remumbers that the Customs staff is now reduced to a minimum. In view of this position, I have changer the working of the system so that the importer may exer cise his option asbcfore. but pay only two per cent ab initio} and it is hope! that this adjustment will very considerably reduce the amount of office work involved in making refunds. Consequently there appears above s new heading named ^Re-Export' Duty which records the results of this recent adjustment. It might not be out of place here to mention ^hat all these refunds were made by cheque, so that (1; records of the tran sactions mii:ht be more efficiently kept than by cash payments, and (2) to encourage the local mercnants to use the services of the Eastern Bank, Ltd*,. The usefulness of this optional system to the mercantile comma ity is demonstrated by^the fact that the old H.b. system has now completely fallen into dis use; and there is no doubt at all in my mind that .he merchants trading with the mainland are quite satis fied with the existing system in Bahrain ^nd are content to carry on with it, in preferenceresiding upon the mainland. The geographical position of the State of Bahrain lends itself to the develoioment of a transit Grade, which is effected by the oncarryin^ of steamers' cargoes to the mainland oy native craft; and in my opinion it is most desirable to encourage this trade as much as pos sible, especially as this oncarrymg creates so much work for local native craft and motor launches* its advantage to the merchant is the facility for despatch ing small quantities of goods t9 the mainland as occa sion offers, ratiter than the shipment there direct from India of large quantities, which coulu only be done by firms having large capital and extensive storage capacity on the mainland. For this reason I believe wbelieve that any effort at bringing cargo direct from India to a mainland port will not prove successful in the long run: and I would here remakk that the recent decision of the ^nglo Persian Oil Co. at ixbatian to send their small steamer^ t Khuzistan , to the mainland ports to sell oil etc., is an error; since the Company will not sell any more oil than it does at present'by transhipment in Bahrain, but, on the other nand will expose its steamer to extra working expense, and take away some employment from some mainland and local native craft. In my report for 1350, I alluded to the difficult P9sition existing here arising from the question of the dire9t transhipment of cargo in this port. The position remained of minor importance for several years until several factors; mainly the growing self-consciousness of the Hejdy merchants, the high freight rates charged by the B.I.S.N.Co. Ltd. ? (which company has practically the monopoly of the India-Persian Gulf' cargo traffic) and the falling prices of Indian commodities notably cereals, made the Nejdy merchants closely consider the amount of the expenses they ?/ere paying, in view of the feneral business depression, on the cereals taken hence othe mainland ports. These expenses included the shipping expenses from India and the Bahrain expenses on re-export. In Bahrain the rate of Khanchia per bag had been fixed at three annas; but after carefully considering the positi9n the Bahrain government decided to reduce this rate in regard to re-exported bag cargo to ks 6/~ per hundred bags. An attempt to force down the B#I. rates had Dre- viously been made by a local Hindu merchant, who had brought here a ship-load of rice and sugar from Cal cutta in a Norwegian craft; but this action did not lead to a general permanent re 'uction of freight rates by the Company. Probably with this fact in mind, a Karachi shitmer of rice (whose shipments are sold on the mainland on a commission basis only) demanded special rates from the B.I.S.N.Co. Ltd., under the threat that he would des patch all future shipments by native craft direct to the mainland, or possibly charter a special steamer for his o?m purchases. After considerable discussion and correspondence it was decided to affirm the ri ht of the Bahrain government to collect two per cent ad valorem upon all cargo transhipped within the port limits; and the B.I.S.N.Co. made a gesture by reducing its freight rate temporarily in order to compete with a second special shipment of cargo from Calcutta to Bahrain arrange?by ahovo Hindu merchant. This ship ment came forward on s.s.'Fagervick' a Norwegian vessel which arrived here on 1st Raba al Thany 1351 (3rd Aug. 1932) with 24,176 packages of rice tea and coffee. In the meanwhile the Karachi shipper, Hajy Hassan bin Murzook, had promised H. B. M f s Political .igent that he would make no direct shipments thence to the mainland of ArabiGuan consideration of a reduction in the freight rate, and also if the Bahrain governmentgovernment would permit his local agent to tranship nis cargo within the port of Bahrain^re-payment of the two per cent duty, 'mil without payment of tne Import Yard charges leviable if the cargo were landed ashore. Since this arrangement did not affect the right of the Bahrain government to collect the duty upon all main land cargo brought to this oort, and was consistent with other ro lections of duty upon cergo transhipped here by native craft, there /as naturally no objection to the proposal; and no doubt the B.I.S.N.&amp;oy. were satisfied to secure their freightage on such cargo. However, while this 'understand/las being arranged,, the s.?. n Ahme-i' a ship of the^Noma^i line, was chaf-^^f 4 ^^ tered by certain interested persons, and laden r ith 15,339 rickages for Bahrain, of which 6,938 packages were manifested for the mainland port of Oqair via &gt; Bahrain, and these packages were shipped partly by Hajy Hassan bin Marzuk, and partly bv the Bombay rela tives of this man's local NeMy Agent. The steamer arrived here on 27th Jamad al Thania 1351 (27th October 1932) under the command of a Captain R« Parcou, who declared that he had been t specially chosen to command this ship on account of lis long experience in seaman ship and mercantile negotiations; and he intended to land the Bahrain cargo here, and te proceed to Oqair with the quantity intended ror that port, and also to huoy the channel in the neighbourhood of Has Tanurafor the benefit of future steamers going in that direction. It haDPened that there was no Agent for this steamer in Bahrain, and the government did not sanction the appointment of certain persons who were invited to work as Agents by the ship's owners. Moreover such an action appeared to be a distinct infringement bv this ship of the Bahrain government's right io its 2^ Transhipment duty: therefore Captain Parcou was informed that unless this duty were Daid here, his Bahrain cargo would not be permitted to be landed. Some lengthy discussion followed during which the Commander of s.s. tf Ahmedi' endeavoured to insist on what he urged were his rights to land cargo here and to proceed on with ^teiao-cargo; and he wanted it to be inferred that he was especially chosen by some government authority for this voyage particularly to mark the channel to Has Tanura, and the name of Captain Philby the Port Officer of Bombay was frecently mentioned* However the Bahrain government maintained its attitude so the ship proceeded to Res Tanura where it landed its mainland cargo and its Bahrain cargo, and after returning to Bahrain to land coolis, clerks etc. Droceeded onwards to Busreh where it was said to have another charter-^arty awaiting it. The Commander had previously pointed out what heavy demurrage would be payable on account of the ship's delay in arriving at Busrah. end hinted that he believed his owners would hold tne Bahrain government responsible for the cost of such delay. These owners have, in fact, made such a claim: but I understand they are not pressing it wisely enough. The effect of this incident is quite satisfactory, for the authority of the Bahrain government in its ownm 70 own territority has been vindicated, and the evasive tactteof the Nejdy marchants have been properly checked; considerable assistance to the B.I.3.N.Go. has been rendered; and although this Company has at last reduced its freight rates to a figure reasonably consistent with the value of the imports having regard to the current depression, it is yet to be seen if this Com pany will reciprocate the assistance given them by the Bahrain government especially in the matter of bringing their steamers to a more convenient anchorage• The transhipments at sea within the port limits of cargo intended for the mainland proceed steadily and the merchants concerned pay their dues without any demur, and the local employment of native craft is ensured, I therefore consider myself justified in reporting thot the mainland trade will proceed steadily as long as there is any such trade to be done, the great est factor in its favour being the regular weekly calling here of the upmail steamers, thus enabling the merchants concerned to replenish their stocks regularly at a saving of considerable sums in interest payable on over due accounts in India if such consignments were to come forward irregularly by sailing craft; another factor is the local reeling of security in dealing with Ihe Bahrain customs. Thus, during the past year the 2% duty so collected has amounted to Its 13,652/*-, The saving point is; how long will such transit trade continue? This is doubtful, for one of the main reasons for the transhipment trade in rice, and especially in piecegoods, was that the rates of Import Duty levied on the mainland were very much less than the rates of Import Duty levied at Jeddah, the greatest port in the Kingdom of oaudia. It appears to be cheaper to bring goods from India to Arabia via Bahrain than to import them via Jeddah; and this fact has created a falling-off in the imports into Jeddah with a corres ponding outcry from the interested merchants there. I understand now that H. M. King ixbdulaziz ibn Saud has ordered the rates of Inmort Duty on the eastern ports of his realm to be similar to those in force at Jeddah on the west, with the exception of Japanese goods, which are said to be subject to a dis tinctive nigh rate of Imnort Duty. This action epy^ears to be due to the activity of Shaikh Muhammad Tawil, who in the Shareefian regime, used to be the Collector of Customs in Jeddah, and who maintains an agent in Bahrain to deal with his business here, this latter carrying on en Import-transit business in his own name. It now remains to be seen how these new rates of Import Duty will affect the transit trade via Bahrain to the mainland. itedjagthe difficulty of the mewv above descxih^ tr o ri a hipm c&gt; r' f: ^ TMl11 '' 1 'lengthyc^^gf^ligence and negotiations whidesirable to acknowledge I In 1,111 um 1 i M'l i i I Mini irnni in, n ill i'iih ( given to government by H.

It is said that trTe reason for this was the lack of rain in ^rsia dnd possibly the customs restrictions there upon exports; but the export thence of sheep and goats to this State still continues, though not in so large a quantity as formerly. The collactions upon live-stock for the year 1350 .were h 2,463/- but m 1251 these amounte to E 1,952/- only. In the year 1350, 1571 native craft visited this port of which 633 came from Persia; while in 1351, 1573 native craft came hare of which only 445 were from Persia. The export trade in tea and sugar has correspondingly languished; and in this trade a steady gart was taken by the big sailing motor craft of the ohaikh of Tibben, which plied regularly between that port and Bahrain. Unfortunately for the Shaikh, during last fta^e? winter his craft was burnt at sea and became a totsl loss, and it has not yet been replaced. itsmther check to this export trade was re^miiy given by tliS&gt;?»|)du^^on the high seas of^a-^ttrfain motor craft, whicuw^t^su^Qc^jyj^^^ patrols of smuggling goods andj^iJsS*^^ Persia;' and I have hearatl^i T -%te^captured crewwSr^kauged in d e t ail ious sea ports between Bushir^Tmd In place of the Persian wheat, there has come forward a steadily increasing Quantity of wheat from Iraq, which is cheaper than Indian rough wheat, and consequently the import of this latter coamodixy has also ceased.

At the en of the year 1351, there were register in Bahrain 1,217 sailing craft and 63 motor launches. This figure includes 458 sailing craft registered for oeariing most of which are expected to go out this season, though there have been a number of sales of craft to foreign ports since the last Uuffal. The boat-building industry is languishing lor want of orders for new craft* and thin is to be expected after several poor nearling seasons. In 1342 there were 617 craft registered for pearling. for last year's uearling season 275 local craft were registered as working oh the ^Khammos' system; and the majority of these did not pay their license dues before the Rakbah, but were permitted by the Deputy Ruler to give 'sanad' for payment of the dues after several iourneys out to the banks; two journeys were in fact stipulated, but the licensees interxxreted this to mean that they might pay as11- I 4 as and when they chose. This loose arrongeinent w8s very unsatisfactory ? and created considerable imnecessary difficulty in the collection of the dues. &gt;0 9 as each saned fell due for piyraent I proceeded to xiapound the craft concerns until payment; and t am glad to report that I collectedall the pearling license fees due to the State without having recourse to the courts at all. Tne permission to ive sanad, however, has created an unfortunate precedent ? which I fear will be resorted to again this year with its consequent trouble in collecting the dues which ought to have been prepaid before the rekba. Harbour lights . The institution of the large light on the customs pier at Manamah has worthily served its purpose, and it is admitted to be of assistance to craft entering or leaving the port at or after snnset. lith this experience in mind, the oil lamp et the mast head at the Maharaq customhouse was replaced with an hundred-watt white electric light* and this light has proved to be of even greater benefit both to steamers and native craft than was at first hoped, for its range of vision is not interrupted by the date palms at rjelalee, so that it can oe distinguished at some dis tance beyong the cuter (white) buoy. I am informed that the light is especially useful to the pearling fleets; so for that reason it is proposed to li^ht: it throughout the season instead of (as at rresent) half the month, and when steamers are expected or m port. The ■'anamah light ranks in the Admiralty sailing directions as an Occasional 1 light, i.e. ? one to be lighted upon request; and since Baurain is not in the direct line of (Julf traffic, it is well that it should remain so; but I undersLand from navigating officers, and particularly from H.M.S. n Ormonde ?t that the existence of the two lights is a very 'definite help to ships enter ing the Dort after sunset in making a suitable anchorage. The only other urgent improvement in the li ghting of the uorl neeied at present is the altering of the Test Spit Buoy into a lighted buoy, and preferably a flash light. i suggestion has been made that a light should be put upon the ortuguese Fort; but I do not approve of this at present, as there are so many practical diffi culties in the way of its efficient maintenance that it really would not be prudent to undertake the res ponsibility for such a light. It has sometimes been urged that the pld beacon built uuon the Has Zarwan by Mirza Ismail (the first B.I.J.K.Goy ? s agent in x ^ahrainj and thus pspularlv known as tne f Gray ''aul f beacon, should be lit, the reason being that this beacon, and the Vest Spit h# huoy and the Manamah Pier light are in transit, and consequently this fact would enable a steamer at night quite readily to find a safe anchorage. But there is no need to urge this point since not^five per cent of the steamers using this port enter it at night, and the suggestion is of very minor importance compared with the need for a lighted West Spit Buoy.It is however a fact that an unofficial li ht has been put upon this beacon by The local B.I.S.iu Coy T s agents on stormy nights, to assist their lighters ^ in making the Customs Pier, but the beacon was rebuilt by the Bahrain Government, and somewhat improves; tksrt; reowbly itjHss broken up by apteseft-^ting upon outsj^j^er^rs] and I hear that the PersTa^^t^ciTg^TI^ authority pro -ose to 0rectth§iia-*r^^ I have not ^ as ^ this has been sanctioneBTby^iie General . It has to be remembered that while the total of the receipts for the past year has decreased, the quantity of work to be lone has increased, esDe- cialiy clerical work in connection with refunis and statistics which have now reached a point of reasonb- able efficiency; there is actually as much clerical work in collecting a small amount of money as a large one. It may perhaps be said that since the collec tions have decreased, the staff should also decrease; but I suggest that uhis is a wrong point of view to take, and^it is better to keep together a trained staff, although its cost may increase a little each year owing to the annual increments in pay. It will be remembered that last year, all^pay was out by ten per cent, but I will not suggest this as a matter of merit, since it will be seen from above how the cost of the prime commodities has fallen so sharply, that actually the present rates of pay have a much larger purchasing power locally than three years ago. Thus, although the Customs receipts have fallen sharply, yet the cost of living has fallen quite as sharply; and if expenses are made to fall consistently, I suggest that the outlook for the future should not be too pessimistic.74 General, Shaikh Khalaf , During last summer Shaikh Khalaf left Bahrain on a lengthy visit to Kathemain where some of his family are living. Before he left he was sued in the Bahrain Court by a local pearl merchant who proved a claim against him for Rs 14,000/-. The Court insisted upon Shaikh Khalaf handing over title deeds for certain of his property in Manamah sufficient to settle the claim, before leaving the country. If is not known when or whether he proposes to return. Iracu ARitator .

E. Shaikh Hamad and then became the guest of Khan Saheb Yusuf Kanoo. He was invited to address the Manamah club which is ostensibly now political. He made a long speech in which he referred to the English as wolves and the people of Bahrain as their prey. After Shaikh Isa's death a large meeting was held under the auspices of the club in Khan Saheb Yusuf Kanoo ! s building on the sea road. Various people spoke including school masters and several young men recite! Doems commemorating the late Ruler. Syed Saleh bin Syed Mehdi also spoke. His speech was violently anti-English and his sentiments were not even disguised by metaphor. He stated among other things, that Jesus Christ had been crucified by thep- 1 r -2- V 3 (General) ■ ^ the Jews, but Shaikh Isa ha ^been morally crucified by the English. His speech was applauded by some of the audience including several of ii. e. Shaikh Hamad's nephews. On the following morning he was taken out to the mail boat which happened to be in the harbour and provided with a free ticket to another port. When he was in Bahrain, he openly abused not only the Government but both the Sunni and the Shia qadis.

It will he seen that in general the financial position is even worse than it was a year ago, inroads have again heen made on th« small reserve, and the State is faced with the possibility of the loss of the dues on the r ransit / frad. with Sa'udl Arabia. 'h. pearl market hae, it is true, shown/1^1 *8- ahem a slight sign of rsoovsry, but not sufficient for It to afford any relief to the distress among the pearling fraternity In Bahrain* There is little money in the Island and even men, till recently accounted rich, find it difficult to do more than exist. 4. The Government of Bahrain have faced the situation with commendable resolution and have reduced the expenditure on the Mministration to the barest necessities. * It is impossible further to reduce the expenditure without curtailing essential services. A reduction has, moreover, been effected in the Civil List, though it still absorbs an unduly high proportion of the revenues of the State. It will, however, be appreciated that for an Arab State to bring about an effective reduction in the allow* ances of the various branches of its Ruling family is a remarkable achievement. 5* Borne alleviation of the position has been given by the death of Hie Excellency the late Sir 'Isa bin All A1 Khalifah and of other members of the A1 Khalifah family. The old and acknowledged custom of the M Khalifah that, when a member of the family dies, his allowance reverts to the ^uler, has been upheld. In spite of opposition, and a fair proportion of the allowances of those recently deceased has been allowed to lapse to the State. In another connection His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin •Isa A1 Khalifah has proposed to Institute a l^amily MaJlis(Councll} , to advise him in such matters, and the idea has much to ccramend it. 6. The tariff on certain articles of import has been raised, but it is too early to judge to *hat extent this will benefit the revenue.7* H«centXy the Government of Bahrain employed an Alitor from a British firm of Audi tore operating in f Iraq and Abadan. The results of the audit were eminently satisfactory for the aeceunts of the various departments of the State were found to 'be in order. m he Auditor was, however, able to indicate a number of directions in ^hich the method of keeping the accounts could he materially simplified. I venture to think that the Govern-. ment of Bahrain is much to he congratulated g both on taking an aetion so unprecedented on the Arab Littoral and on the excellent results* 8# 1 fear that the financial position, in Bahrain as elsenhere, presents a gloomy picture, but it is hoped that the discovery of oil will place the finances of the State on a more satisfactory footing. Opportunities have been taken of putting into the mind of His Excellency Bhaikh Hamad the idea that it was desirable that the revenue obtained from oil should be divided in some fixed proportion between himself and the Adminis- t rat Ion* His ISxoellency evidently brooded over this matter, for he has now himself suggested that a division should be made in the proportion of one-third to himself and two-thirds to the Administration* The matter has not yet been placed on a firm basis, as negotiations regarding the exploitation of the oil are still in progress, but the fact that His Tfcccellency has himself made this suggestion, and has proposed so reasonable a proportion, may be regarded as of happy augury. 9, In conclusion, t venture to make the warmest commenda tion of the work performed by the financial Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Mr. C. D. Belgrave. I have personal knowledge of the extraordinary difficulties with which Mr. Belgrave has been faced and of the tact and ability which he has displayed/*4~ displayed in dealing with the®; for it is not an easy matter for a eerrant of the State to defend the revenue against the demands of a Huler and Ruling Family, whose ideas in money matters are those of the open-handed Bedouin Chief. These diffieulties hare been rendered the more serious by the faot that the financial position of Bahrain is based, almost wholly, on a luxury trade, so that the financial depression has had a deep effect on all classes. Bahrain, X trust that I may be authorised to convey to him, through His Excellency Bhaikh Hamad, an expression of the hi^i approval of the Government of India of the manner in which he has carried out his duties as financial Adviser to the Bahrain Government in circumstances of great difficulty, Buch a message would, t think, be appreciated by His Excellency Shaikh Hamad and would encourage Mr. BeIgrave in his arduous and responsible work.

After Compliments,, ) received and noted the contents of your letter No.736 dated 10th July equivalent t© 17th Rabi 1 al Auwal, in which you reminded me of the previous discussion which I had with you and Mr.Belgrave three months ago about the finances of Bahrain. 2. Hb doubt there had been a deficit of Rs t 7C &gt; 000A between the revenue and the expenditure of the Bahrain Government,but as you are aware that when the cut in the pay of the Ruling Family was made many of them complained to me of the difficulties they were put to, but I convinced them and promised that when the state of the revenue improves and a better time comes, the Bahrain Government will consider what might relieve their hardship. I should like to remind you that as was mentioned in our previous discussion and in accordance with the letter received from the Hon t ble the Political Resident that my income will not be affected by any reduction, but it appeared to me that the allowance which is given in the month of Ramadhan to the Ruling Family was debited to my private account by the Bahrain Government# Besides this I pay from my private account to many of the Al Khalifah widows and to those whose very small allowance from the Government is not enough to meet with their needs, and also to those who do not get any allowance. I have also to bear the expenditure of the visit ing chiefs and others who become my guests, which,however, requires a large sum of money. 0' Colonel, as regards the talk I had with you about the hope of getting good rvenue from oil which might improve and a general benefit might be derived of it, and as mention -ed by you, it is not wise to count on any income until the result become known. In our conversation I suggested to you-2- 1^5 to keep the matter pending till your return,before taking action further to reduee the expenditure, whicli reduction s was actually made in the pay of the Ruling Family and other until the position regarding payments for oil become knwon You referred to my conversation with you in which you agree -ed and approved that the payments should be divided into one third for me and two thirds for the Bahrain Government so that the (Government may have enough money to be well administered. 3. The third point was that we had discussion about two matters# The first matter was to give effect to the ancient custom that lands gifted to members of the A1 Khalifah Family should revert to the Ruler on the death of the person. I, as a matter of mercy and in order to satisfy the A1 Khalifah Family, suggested that a Family Council may be formed at present of ray brothers Shaikh Muhammad and Shaikh Abdullah and my son Shaikh Salman, who will consider how much should be given to the family of the deceased, should he have any desrving family, so that the family of such person might not feel want and that they should write down what in their opinion was just and fair and then I will consider it and see if the distribut ion which they suggested is suikble affix my seal to it, so that all might know fchat had been done. This is the best procedure by which they cannbe contented, and as was mentioned by you, an arrangement would exist by which dependants of deceased,if in need, should get a share according xo their necessity. If God is willing, after this is arranged and approved by you, a day will be fixed for my brothers Shaikh Muhammad and Shaikh Abdullah and my son Shaikh Salman to sit and deal with their matters. Then remains the second matter mentioned by you about the sale of land belonging to the A1 Khalifah Family by a member of the A1 Khalifah. As was mentioned by me to Your Honour au^. is well known, that the ancient custom is thatM • land belonging to the A1 Khalifah can be sold to a member of the A1 Khalifah. Family. The reason for establis- ing custom was to prevent the A1 Khalifah gradually dispos ing of their property to rich men and prevent them from losing their properties so that they would become landless# This undoubtedly will not be allowed and they j after some tia time,will realise the good results of this action. I, howeve wish to add one thing more to this, namely that whenever one is hardly in need and has an open land of which he does not get any benefit and wants to sell it so that he may be able to get some other thing with its price of which he expects to get more benefit, toe may write a letter to the Government who will appoint some people to consider the question. After they submit their report the Government should either purchase the land from him, or offer the sale of the same to the Ruling Family or allow him to sell it himself. That if they want to sell a landed property of which they get a very small income and replace it with some other property out of which they expect Jo get a better income, they should apply to the Government to inspect the same and then if the Government consider, after giving due consideration to these two points which are in their interest that it would be suitable to do so allow them to do it, excepting the two cases for which I have already given permission namely the sale done by my brother Shaikh 'Abdullah to K.B.'Abdul 'Aziz al Qusaibi and that of the sale done oy Shaikh Khalifah bin Salman to Yusuf Fakhru,in which cases the sale may be allowed to take place, because they have already had my permission, if y 0U approvve of proposals, the Government ray issue an 'AlanCnotice) so that they-«ay-H«% Ruling Family may not be cheated in their property and that the sale should be among the Ruling Family. 4. I also wqnt to remind Jfour Honour of what I had mentioned to you verbally, that I thought fit that we the descendants of Shaikh 'Isa namely my-self, my sons, my-4- brothers Shaikh Muhammad and Shaikh Abdullah and their respective sons and also our nephew Shaikh Khalifah bin Salman and his sons should have the permanent right over all gifts and present in our possession and thereafter to our sons and grandsons and that I can sanction this and affix my seal to it f which I hope you will approve. 5. Let me thank you heartily for the kind remarks and keen interest you have shown in the Bahrain affairs and that or -ohe Ruling Family. Usual Ending.itl D.O.Bo. c Secretariat, Bahrain, Aug, 10, 1933. Dear Gastrell, I (&gt;$~ There are several points in His Excellency K 4 Shaikh Hamad 1 s letter dated 5th Rabi al Thany 1352, regarding finances and Khalifah estates which I think require some further explanation. The letter was composed and written by Shaikh Mohomed bin Isa. Para 2, line 7. This inrolies that the Civil list will be increased when revenue improves (from oil) by payment from government funds. It has now been definitely agreed that l/3rd of all royalties will be naid to H. E. Shaikh Hamad himself. Perhaps it might be as well if in reply to this letter some slight suggestion was inserted imDlying that it will be in Shaikh Hamad's power to increase the allowances of any of his relations out of the royalty from oil which we hope that he will receive. para 2, line 11. No reduction was made in the monthly amount paid to Shaikh Hamad when the 2^ cut was made although when by H. E. Shaikh Hamad's orders the matter was discussed by me with Shaikhs Mohomed Abdullah and Sulman they all insisted that Shaikh Hamad's emoluments should be cut in a similar way to theirs. The Ramadan allowance (Rs 2,000/-) was not allowed for in the budget for 1351 as no funds were available.-2- Although H. E. haikh Hamsd was aware that no provision for it had been made he gave me orders to pay it and to debit it against his own account. Some of the amount is paid to his own sons. Line 19, In the early days At Shaikh Hamad's reign several increases were mode in his monthly emolument. On one occasion, during Major Daly T s time, it was increased in order to cover the cost of public entertaining and I believe particulars of this exist in the Agency files. Page 3, line 7. The expression 'open land TT i'HC . sale, - -- is very vague. In the recent/mentioned in this letter, by Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa, the description 'open land ff was used as applying to a very valuable piece of ground, watered from Adari, on which lucerne was cultivated which was bought by Gozaibi for Rs 10,000/-. I think 'open land' should be more clearly defined; it could be stipulated that r open land' means land which has no water rights and which does not produce any rent. Artesian wells enable owners of such land to cultivate. Page 4, Shaikh Mohomed has strongly opposed this matter since it has been under discussion but lately he agreed to support Shaikh Hamad on the condition that he and his sons would not be affected in any way. If this concession is granted it must be granted also to Shaikh Abdullah and to Shaikh Khalifah bin Sulman and their heirs, in fact to the immediate male heirs of Shaikh Isa, I suggest that it would be as well to approve of Shaite Hamad granting this concession only in the-3- the case of gardens or ground which are actually being cultiYated by them at the time of the death of the holders of the gifted property. This would do much towards settling the vague claims which Shaikh 'ohomed and certain others of the KhaliTah make over huge tracts of country, including whole villages and foreshore, which they claim to own by right of TT hiba '' papers over ^sehat'. I have frequently referred to this matter in letters to the Agency. In past times Shaikh Isa used to write on scrap of paper that he gifted the district of so and so to one of his sons or grandsons. In those days open ground was valueless as it could not be irrigated. The gift conveyed rights of independent taxation and various other feudal usages all of which are now extinct. Some of the Khalifah who retain these documents now argue that the gifts of whole districts in Bahrain convey the actual ownership of all the ground, except that which is privately owned, within the ' T sehat n . In some places the local Bahama have cultivated patches of ground within these areas and in some cases the Shaikh who holds the hiba demands that they should be ejected and their gardens taken over by him. The Bahrain court is now dealing with several cases of this description. Captain E. Gastrell, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain,n v £9/176 Telegram H.

I am directed to refe^ to correspondence ending with your express letter Uo. 1296-S, dated the 7th October 1933 on the subject of the financial position of the Bahrain State. 2. The Government of India have read these documents with much concern. An examination of the Report shows that the present condition of the State finances can only be described as most serious and the Government of India note with great misgiving Mr. Belgrave f s opinion that the State is at present heading for bankruptcy and may in a few years have to turn to the Government of India for financial assistance. They realise that the discovery of oil in Bahrain may eventually effect a very considerable improve ment in the revenues of the State but they consider that the fact that an increasing income may be derived from this source in the future does not in itself justify the continuance of the present state of affairs. They observe that in the year 1345 the total revenue of the State was Es. 11,9l,8l0/-,of which a sum of Ks. 4,50,094/-, equivalent to 45 per cent, was absorbed by the Civil List, and that in the following year the percentage of Civil List to total revenue dropped to 37.? per cent. In 1351 revenue had fallen to Es. 6,84,298/- but the Civil List still amounted toto as much as Bs# 4,13,344/-, slightly more tIrian 60 per cent of the total revenue. The estimate of revenue for the year 1352 shows a further decline to Rs. 6,35,171/-. The Civil List has, it is true, 'been reduced to Hs. 3,30,000/- or 59.8 per cent of the total revenue, but the Goverrment of India observe from Mr. Belgrave♦s Report that, if the savings accruing frcm the death of the late Sheikh Sir Isa bin Ali are taken into account, little, if any, actual reduction has been made. 3. The Government of India cannot view such a state of affairs with equanimity. They realise that Mr. Belgrave f s position as a paid servant of the State precludes him from exercising any real pressure on the Sheikh in the matter of his Civil List. They consider it essential that unless figures for the first part of the present financial year, when available show a probability that the budget will balance the extremely serious nature of the financial position of his State should be explained to the Sheikh in unequivocal terns and a substantial reduction effected in his Civil List and will be glad to be informed with as little delay as possible how in your opinion this could most effectively be done. 4. In conclusion I am to ask that an expression of the Government of India's appreciation of the manner in whic h ■ he has handled the State finances in circumstances of great difficulty may be conveyed to Mr. Belgrave, Financial Adviser to the Bahrain State.

From The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain, To IL B, M's Political i Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to enclose a statement of revenue and expenditure for the six months ending with Jamadi-al-Thany which shows the financial position of the State at the end of the first six months of the current year. 2. This year, as mentioned in my letter ^ rv No. 17/SF of 29th April 1933, I was compelled to show a deficit on the revenue side of the Budget • of Hs 90,329/-, so far, however, during this first half year, the expenditure has not exceeded the revenue. At the end of the half year the State hos 8 balance of hs 4,868/- end it has not yet been necessary to withdraw any money from the 'eserve Es 250,000/- for current expenditure. 3. In spite of this the position is not as satisfactory as it appears; it would be incorrect-2~ incorrect to gauge the revenue for the second half of the year according to the receipts of the first six months. This yeer the revenue of the first six months has a somev.;hat fictitious vclue. It includes, under * Customs T proceeds, the sum of Rs 1^4,000/- Y/hich was obtained from pearling licenses. Every pearling license has now been paid and during the next six months no further revenue will be forthcoming from this source. Unfortunately the pearl season has been worse even than the preceding years, the bazaar is heavily overstocked with rice which was imported by merchants who expected to sell it, as usual, at Ghuffaal. This year at Ghufaal, the end of the diving season, nobody has any ready money ^ith which to buy rice and the merchants cannot afford to sell at lonf term credits. Until this very large stock is exhausted no more will be imported and customs on imported rice, which is the staple food of Bahrain, is the main source of customs revenue. 4. During the first half year, Customs receipts including pearling licenses, have averaged Ks 56,000/- Der month. It is improbable that during the next six months customs proceeds will average more than h 35,000/- per month. Other sources of revenue, as shown on my returns, show a nett deficit of approxi mately Rs 16,000/- on the first half year, but the actual expenditure is lis 1,600/- less than the estimated amount. The revenue fro^a sources other than Customs will improve during the second half of the year as certain payments, such as the oil concession rent, are•3- ere not due until during the second six months and this year it can be reasonably assumed that the State will receive an addition its 20,000/- from the rent for the rainirg lease and also rent for the aero drome for which no payment has yet been received. It is probable that by the end of the year the total receipts other than customs may aggregate the omonnt which they were expected to produce. This being the c^se the total deficit at the end of the year will amount to perhaps slightly less than the Rs 90,000/- which I estimated. I do not wish to be unduly pessimistic but these are the conclusions which I have arrived at after carefully studying the available statistics and considering the probable developments during the remainder of this year. 5. The main source of the Stated revenue is the customs receipts. Excluding boat and pearling licenses, which are included in the monthly returns under ff Gustoms proceeds', the total receipts from the customs during the first half year amount to only Es ^0,600 more than the corresponding six months of last year in sDite of the very considerable increase in the rate of customs duty which is now 10^ on certain imDOrts which were previously charged only aA. valorem. According to Customs statistics for the first half year I find that if the old rate of duty had been maintained the receipts from Customs duty would have amounted to Rs 4,500/- less than during the corresponding period of last year. This falling off is due to the fol lowing reasons. In order to show them I have made my calculations on the supposition that the old rates are still in existence.6. (a) Stoomers cspgo showe 8 dscreese 01 Rs 7,000/- due to direct transhipment of rice to mainland frora steamers within port limits and sleek ness of trade in tea and loaf sugar. (b) Native croft duty shows increase of its 4,500,/- owing to increased import of flour from Iraq and tobacco from Batha. (c) Passengers baggage shows decrease of Rs 1,900/- the import by passengers from Persia of caroets and galims has decreased. (d) Export duty shows decrease of its 800/- due to direct export of dry dates from mainland to India by s.s. 'Fagervick^ 7. One steamer, s.s.'Fagervick' went direct * rem India to the mainland and this one boat caused the Bahrain Customs to lose about its 5,000/- of customs duty which it would otherwise have collected if the freight of the steamer had passed through Bahrain in the usual way. This is some indication of the probable effect of a monthly direct service between India and the mainland. 8. :.3 after the first six months the State has a credit balance and the expenditure has not exceeded the income I think it ii not a suitable time to suggest any change in the Civil List. I fully anticipate that after the next three months and at the end of the year the State will be faced with a heavy deficit, though perhaps slightly less than the leficit which I estimated in the Budget. If this is the case I consider that the Civil List should then be re adjusted proportionately to the decrease in the revenuerevenue as has frequently been suggested before. I have the honour to be, Sir, Adviser to the Govornmunt of Bahrain, :::nolos.&gt; 1 ^ D.0.Ko:730/S.P. Baiiraiii, Novr 114,1933. Dear Colonel Loch, I enclose some figures which may interest you and the Hon'ble the Political Resident in connection our recent conversation about finances. They show tnat the expenditure has been reduced every year. This month,the seventh of the year,the revenue continues to be satisfactory and I think we shall not have a deficit on the month. The feeling ot the Shaikhs is that as long as we have no actual deficit there is no necessity for further cuts,but Shaikh Abdulla agreed that we could not continue to show an annual deficit. They are always optimistic and hope that we shall receive money from the Oil Company which will ensure balancing the budget. Yours sincerely, Sd/-CDalrymple Belgrave. Lieut-Colonel G.Loch, H.B.M's Political Agent, Bahrain.I Gonfidential . of 1933 T4b The Besldency, Bushire, 19tli December, 1933. c With regard to Bahrain Unancea. You vill remember that i&amp;iffn I dlBCUBfied this matter with vou and Bel^rave, ve thought that the 'be^t line to follow nas that vhich I had taken up with the ^uXtan of Muecat when I ^aa ^oli'-lcal Agent there and the Btate could not raake endfl Hieet. ^M b line was to decide how imich had to he Baved in the Budget for the eneuing year, and then give the %iler varioua Bugreeted eoonomiea, the total of which cane to more than the saving required. 'he littler could then, after diBCUBBion with his Hotahles. the financial Adviser and the Political Agent, choose which particular economies to adopt. S, If you see no objection, could you and Belgrave take a suitable opportunity of tackling the Bhaikh on the above lines so as to have some sort of general plan ready when I next visit Bahrain. nie Rhaildi th « A1 ^lalifah family will of course count considerablv on the Oil. ''he reply to that might be that when the Budget is being drawn up, the exact amount which the Btate will get from the Oil will be still untertaln, and that therefore economies for the next year will have to be made without too much regard to what Oil will bring in. ^e He.90.000/- deficit, mentioned in Belgrave's letter of the S9th October, will have to be met from the ne^t Budget, 3.

The Government of India agree that you were right in not selecting this opportunity for tackling the Shaikh. The position is however impossible, when the Civil List absorbs 60% of a falling revenue and the 'budget is not even 'balanced. The Government of India would hardly agree to give a loan in order to stave off 'bankruptcy caused 'by such proceedings; and if the Shaikh is forced to apply for a loan one of the conditions upon which they will certainly insist will 'be a very large reduction in the Civil List. He would therefore 'be well advised to set his own house in order and to avoid having to apply for a loan, the grant of which will have such serious consequences for himself and his family.

Dated, Shawaal 21, 1352 February 6,1934 I'Toia The Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. To H. B. I7[ f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to forward particulars of the revenue and expenditure of the Bahrain State for the first nine months of the current irabic year which ended on January 16,1934. I regret the delay in forwarding these returns which is mainly nwin^ ^ tue recent holidays. The financial position is briefly as follows.- 9 months 1352. Revenue - Rs 5,35,228/- Expendi ture 5,38,458/- Deficit Rs 3,230/- 2. In addition to the deficit shown above, bills amounting to approximately Rs 3000/- were outstanding at the end of the month thus bringing the total deficit upto approximately Rs 6000/-, in spite of payments by the Bahrainrv^f j -2- Bahrain Petroleusi Goiapany amounting to h 21,541/- (of which Rs 10,000/- was expected.) lJ. the Bahrain j. 5 etroleuB3 Company f s payments had not materialised tha State would have had a deficit of ks 27,500/- approximately at the end of the first nine months. A sum of Rs 8,000/- which was borrowed last year from the deposit account, has not yet been repaid. 3. The following is a summary of the budget position at the end of the nine months.- Revenue . Estimated revenue - Its 4,76,378/- Actual revenue - &amp; 5,35,228/- Sxcess over the * budgeted amount - Rs 58,850/- bhis includes lis 21,500/- oil receipts of which only Rs 10,000/- was expected. Expenditure. Estimated expenditure Rs 5,44,125/- iictual expenditure - Rs 5,38,458/- * Difference - g , oo 7/- * Rs 3000/- outstanding reduces the difference to Rs 2,667/-. In the budget a deficit of Rs 90,000/- was expected. 4. The following is a comparison of the revenue and expenditure during the first nine months of 1351 and 1352. 1351 1352 difference. Revenue lis 5,36,393 Bs 5,35,228/- Ks 1.165/- Expendi- Rs 5,85,182 Rs 5,38,458/- Rs 46,724/-.Taking into consideration the unexpected receipt of Rs 11,500/- from the Bahrain Petroleum Company it is evident that revenue from the usual sources has decreased approxi mately by lis 12,000/- in nine months when compared to the previous year. Expenditure has been reduced by apprcasi- aately Es 43,000/— allowing for the unpaid bills outstanding at the end of the nineth month of 1352. 5. To cover the expenditure for the remaining three months of 1352 at least lis 1,80,000/- will be required. I consider that it is unlikely that the revenue for this last quarter will exceed Ks 1,30,000/-. Therefore I have been compelled to withdraw the sum of fis 50,000/- from the Reserve in order to cover the expenditure for the remaining part of this year. I regret very much that circumstances have tins course and I hope that it will not be necessary to withdraw any further amounts for current expen diture from the Reserve which has now been reduced to two lacs only.

It is really designed, firstly,to help Belgrave stave off new expenditure,in particular the talcing up tne completion of the causeway,which is filling everyone^ mind (even the Ladies ! quarters) at the moment; and, secondly,as an initial move towards bringing home to the Siiaikh and his Family the necessity for 'balancing the budget now under preparation. I have written it in general terms ( because I re^ard j (and mostly with a view to stopping new expenditurej^it as essential to make no real move till the acquisition of land has been completed. Practically the only direction in which retrench ment is possible is the Civil List,and it would be most unwise to touch,or even to let the Family think that we had our eyes on it, till we nave got our land; for there are a number of ways in which a disgruntled Al Khalifah could put a spoke in our wheel. I hope that you will agree witti this view. 3. I should also prefer,if possible,to iiave tjie Civil Aerodrome Agreement completed before upsetting tJie Al KhalifaJi.

I ^ ^ 'I Political Agency, 1 7?^ Bahrain, tJae 21st April 1934. From:- Lieut-Golonel Gordon Loch,I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain. To:- The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to enclose a copy of a Memorandum No:3/2A dated the 1st Muharram 1353 (the 15th April 1934) from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government regarding the wish of His Excellency Shaiim Hamad bin T Isa Al Khalifah to grant to his son, Du f ai3, an allowance of Es.307/- a month. I have replied that I have written to you on tJae subject. 2. Shaikh Du ? aij was married on the 13th April, so that the grant of an allowance to him is appropriate, and the amount tiierefore, proposed is suitable. The boy id a favourite son and it would,/ be very difficult, especially in view of tiie expected royalties from oil, to reluse tiie Shaikii f s request or to reduce the amount. 3. I would, therefore, propose to acceue to tJae Shaikh T s proposal, but to use tiie opportunity of tMs request to strength en our hands in two ways. 4. Firstly, I would accede to the request subject to tiie cost of tne allowance being met from the one-third of the royalties on oil whicJi are to be paid to the Shaikh tor the firmly Civil List. This will, I hope, help to establish the /principle ■ M-)2 principle that the one-third payable to the Shaikh must bear any Civil List payments which he may wish to make to his relatives. 5. Secondly, I would remind him that, though it is hoped that considerable sums will accrue to him from oil, yet the oil may cease to flow, or there may come a time when it does not pay to continue to place it on the market; and say that it would, therefore, be wise, whenever a new allowance is granted, to ensure that, when allowances cease through the death (which God forbid) of any member of the Family, the Committee who examine the question should endeavour to apply the amount which has reverted to the Ruler, as far as possible to meeting the cost of the new allowance. 6. I will, moreover, take what opportunities I can of emphasising verbally that the day is past when a Civil List can support an indefinite and growing number of a ruling Family. 7. A reply would be of greater weight, and more likely to be accepted without criticism, if it is given at once, and, if you approve of the above proposal, it would be convenient if you would telegraph the one word 'MAREIAGE'; otherwise I will wait fc I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant. Lieut-Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain.VH 1 Copy of Memorandum No:3/2A dated the 1st Muharram 1353 from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government to the Political Agent, Bahrain. I am informed that His Excellency Shaikh Hamad wishes his son Daij, who recently married, to receive an allowance of Rs.307/- a month. Until now he has not been in receipt of any emolument as it is the custom that the young Shaikhs do not receive this until they marry. His Excellency agreed that any addition to the Civil List should be referred to you for discussion with the hon'ble the Political Resident, before being granted. I should be obliged if you would inform me, or inform His Excellency what you advise in this matter. The allowance would increase the Civil List by Hs.3,684/- per annum.^(|V No:425-8/9. Confidential Political Agency, Bahrain, the 22nd April 1934. From:- IP: Lieut-Colonel G-ordon Loch,I.A., Political Agent, Banrain. 775 To:- The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter No:20/S.P dated the 4th Muharram 1353 (the 18th April 1934) from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government forwarding the Budget Estimates of the Bahrain Government for the year 1353 and the Administration Eeport for the year 1352. 2. The expenditure of the various Departments of the Administration has been reduced to the lowest possible level consistent with their continuing their activities. 3. No credit has been shown for the royalties on oil (which should become payable at some time between the 1st January and the 31st March 1935) or for the sums which have been received from the sale of Bahrain Government land to the British Government. These sums represent a large amount of money, but it was considered wise to omit them from the budget estimates lest they should give rise to attempts to incur new and unnecessary expenditure in the absence of the Adviser. /The'&gt;4'3 2. The effect of the receipt of these sums will be:- (a) to wipe out the deficit for which provision has been made, and (b) to provide a very large surplus. 4. The Adviser informs me that His Excellency Shaikh Hamad has agreed to replace from the proceeds of the sale of Bahrain Oovernment lands the sum of Rs.50,000/- borrowed in 1352 from the Reserve Fund. 5. It will be important when the royalties begin to come in, to build up the reserve gradually to a substantial figure. 6. I have not pressed for any reduction in the Oivil List for various reasons. In the first place, proceedings have been going on for some time for the acquisition of considerable areas of land for the use of His Majesty's Government. To have alienated the Ruling Family, at this juncture, from the Ruler to his lowliest kinsman, would have been fatal to our end, which has actually been achieved with little or no friction. The same applies to a lesser degree to the Civil Air Agree ment. Moreover, the ill-feeling which such an action would have engendered, might well have adversely affected our negotiations with the Shaikh of Qatar, as it would have been a vivid example of the internal interference which he fears. In the second place, a considerable sum is being paid for Bahrain Grovernment land, a fixed annual payment has been arranged for the Civil Aerodrome, and very much larger sums are likely to become payable in the present year from /oil3. oil royalties. In these circumstances, there is not one of the Family who would not have resented our interference beyond measure and with, to them, perfect reason; and the effect of their resentment would weaken our position along the Arab Littoral as well as in Bahrain itself. Finally, as revenue increases from the oil royalties and from the recovery (even though slow) of trade, the present high percentage of the Civil List to the revenue will be reduced. The Shaikh has himself suggested a distribution in the proportion of one-third to the Civil List and two- thirds to the Bahrain Government in the case of the oil royalties, and I hope that a convention will gradually grow up of a one-third - two-thirds division in the budget as a whole. It is well also to remember that the cost of the entertaining demanded by custom and of poor relief falls largely on the Ruler and his Family, and that the existence of a budget at all is a remarkable achievement in a Principality of the Arab Littoral. In all the circumstances I venture to think that it would be most inexpedient, and in view of the increase in resources unnecessary, to bring upon ourselves the odium, both in Bahrain and outside the Island, which would be entailed by touching the private purses of the Ruling Family. 7. I do not propose to offer comment on the Report, which is interesting and useful, but would say that if and when regular funds become available from oil royalties, three /mattersX 4. matters should, I venture to think, receive urgent attention (i) the appointment of an Assistant to the Adviser to the Bahrain G-overnment, (ii) the institution of a carefully conducted campaign against malaria, and (iii) the renewal of the Bahrain Government's steps to assist and improve agriculture and fruit growing. I have the honour to he Sir, Your most obedient servant. Lieut-Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain.No. t)-«&gt; /s .F.of 1353 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain* Dated, Maharan. 4, 1353 April, 19, 1934. From The Financial Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. To His Britannic Majesty's Political .-.gent, i Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to submit for your infor mation the State Budget for 1353 and the annual report and particulars of Revenue and Expenditure for 1352. This is the ninth budget which I have had the honour to prepare. The annual report is very brief. Many matters which should have been mentioned have been omitted. Owing to the fact that I am pro ceeding on leave in three days most of the report was prepared before the end of the year. I have had a great deal of additional work to complete during the last two months besides my ordinary duties, I have carried out the work which used to be done by the Asaistant Adviser end Commandant of —-2- of Police and during most of the summer, while the Director of Customs was on leave, I have dealt with the customs work. It has been impossible for me to afford the necessary Urn to compile a full report# The 135 3 Budget . Owing to unexDscted revenue from the Bahrain Petroleum Cosroany and from the lease of the Muharraq aerodrome it has been pos sible to balance the budget by including the balance from 1352. I • Custoaa Heoei-pta . I have estimated the revenue from this deDartment at the same figure which I estimated in last year f s budget though the actual receipts during 1352 asaounted to airpro- ximately Es 6,09,000/-. It inay be reasonably assumed that the revenue during the ooming year will exceed the sum which I have anticipated. 0il &gt; This sua includes eight instal ments of Is 5,769 - of which h 30,000/- is repay able from future royalties, according to the arrangement agreed upon between the Bahrain government and the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Although it is practically certain that the oil company will comraence shipping oil during the coming summer and that royalties will become pay able to the government during 1353, yet I have not assumed, in making this budget, that any revenue from royalties will be received. VII. Lease of Pterodromes . Thin includes the rent of ^anaueh aerodrome and the rent of the 'tuharraq aerodrome for 1934-35 which I assume will be paid in advance in October 1934.3 - items VxII to XII sre ©stiiaated according to the receipts from these sources during 1351, it is probable that thaj will produce the aaounta which I have estimated. Xlll, Interest on Reserve . This is cal culated on the assuEmtion that the Reserve Fund will remain at the present figure which is fis 2,00,000/-, If, as is probable, the Reserve Fund is increased fros certain sources there will be a corresponding increase in the interest which It yields. XV. Loan recoverable . This represents the instalment of a loan made to the lluharraq Municipality to pay for their share of the capital in the lectric Scheme. Balance froia 135S . The particulars of this balance can be seen in the statement of revenue etc. The balance includes £1000. Daid at the of the year by the British Government for lease of the ^uharreq aerodrome from October 1932 till October 19S4. Expenditure . The expenditure differs very slightly to the amount shown in the previous year. The allotisent for the Sectreteriat is somewhat higher than in 1352 as it includes leave passages for the adviser which are payable once in every four years. The total expenditure represents only the ajaount necessary for main taining the present adainistration and allows for no expansion in any direction. It will be noticed that the Civil List absorbs considerably more than half the total expenditure.-4- ihs Bhill'sin StotG is noli oucuisborsd by tiny debts, the Electric Dopartment however during the last two years has failed to pay its way and has borrowed frois the Deposit account the sura of &amp; 15,000/-approximately which if not paid off from future profits will become a liability for the gOTernment. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obeiient servant, iidviser to the GoYeriuaent. \* Revenue. The actual revonue reoeived during 1352 amounted to approximately &amp; 42,000/- more than the revenue during 1351. Customs receipts showed an increase of approxi mately Si 8,000/-. fhis is explained in the Customs report, the increase is mainly due to the increased customs tariff which in the previous year had only existed for some months. Passports receipts show a falling off of about is 1,000/-. Rents from government land and oil concession are greatly increased owing to payments by the Bahrain Petroleum Company and also the payment of the rent of 'uharraq aerodrome. Interest on Reserve Fund has decreased owing to uiie withdrawal of Rs 50,000/- from the Reserve which previously yielded interest. The remaining revenue aources have yielded aoproximately the seme amount as they did in 1351. Expenditure . The total expenditure iuring 1352 was approxi mately la 47,000/- less than the expenditure in 1351. The chief saving was in the Civil List in which there is a difference of is 24 ,600/- owing to the death of His Ixcellency Shaikh Sir laa bin All and a reduction in the Ciiil list of 11,500/- owing to the 2*# out and the death of certain persons who were included in it. Of the remaining items some show an increase but is a saving on their total. The extra cost of State protection is owing to the fact that during the year Notes on Revenue and expenditure 135210 1 year the Police force has been brought up to strength and it was necessa y to purchase some new uniforms and equipment to replace worn out material. Tha actual ex pen iture exceeded the actual revenue by approximately h 4 f 000/- although in the Budget for 1352 I expected a deficit of # 000/~. i i.k,Comparison of 1352 Budget and actual Revenue and Sxpeadlture. Rewnuo. -hen making the Budget for 1352, I estimated a deficit of lis 90,000/-, fortunately owing mainly to unforseen circumstances, my emecta- tion was incorrect• Owin to the unsatisfactory trade prospects and depression in the pearl industry 1 estiaated revenue from Customs, pearling licenses etc. at i$ 5,50 ,00 /- whereas the actual ©mount collected was Ik 6,08,977/-, approximately Rs 58,000/- more than I expected. In several of the other items I overestimated the revenue. The ebt of ^ohomed bin Subah was not repaid and eventually the govermnent took over his property in discharge of the balance. He owed Is 9,000,/-, the property is worth less than Is 1,000/- but this individual is virtually bankrupt. The order sanctioning a tax on artesian wells wes unfortunately repealed by His Excellency Shaikh Hamad owing to protests of two or three leading merchants who owned several wells. The unexpected revenue from oil increased the ^ heading of 'Rents of Government Land' from h 15,000/- to h 55,000/-. Sxnenjiture . On the expenditure side there is an increase of h 5,000/- approximately over the amount which I estimated. This is due to the costs of the auditor which were paid at the begin ning of 125E end %hioh had not been allowed for in the 1252 budget. Without considering the facts which I have explained in these notes it might very reasonably be considered that the discrepancies between mymy 1352 budget and the actual results are unreasonably great. fhea I made the Budget I considere that it would be dangerous to assume that more than the amount ?Mch I estimated would be obtained from the customs sources and I was not aware that an arrangement would be made between the government and the Behrain Petroleum Company by which the government would receive about Bs 40,000/- more than the annual rent* £1The Pearl trade and the Diving industry. The 1352 season. The slump in the pearl trade and the conse quent depression in the diving industry still con tinues but it appears that the 1352 season showed a slight improvement over the previous season. I form this opinion after examining the accounts of the authorised diving clerks who make up the accounts between the divers and their nakhudas. These clerks have dealt with the accounts of 345 boats out of a total of 436 and I have taken the results of their accounts as a basis on which to calculate the average of the whole catch. These figures represent the rockbottom prices paid to the nakhudas, they differ very greatly to the prices obtained on shore when the pearls have passed through the hands of several merchants and they differ even more to the prices paid for the same pearls by foreign buyers in Bahrain and Bombay and ultimately in Europe. 2. The results of my calculation are as follows. Year. total No. of Total value of boats. pearls in Hs. 1347/1348 538 1348/49 509 8s 21,25,000/- 1349/50 504 16,32,000/- 1350/51 456 12,14,000/- 1352 436 13,40,000/- For the purpose of comparison I have included the the figures of previous years. Although 20 less boats went out to the banks the value of the catch was It lacs more than the previous year.The Cetoh. 3. The total weight of pearls during 1352 appears to have been about the same as during 1351, though in 1S5S there was a marked decrease in the number of high grsie pearls but an increase in the number of medium end low grade pearls. Very few important pearls ware found. Two were sold for about Ik 20,000/- each, but only one of them belonged to a Bahrain boat. The divers in this boat received about ^ 600/- each. ijiother pearl tos sold for Rs 10,000/- of which tHe divers received a 230/- each. Both were small boats. In past times the price of Rs 20,000/- for one pearl was so frequently paid that it would not have been mentioned in a report as an exceptional price. 4. The price of pearls in Bahrain during the first half of the season was 10^ higher than the corresponding period the year before, but after the middle of the season the price fell somewhat. 5. All the Bahrain merchants have sold their new pearls, at a small profit, but many of them are still encumbered by large stocks from previous years and the value of undrilled pearls decreases every year. A few merchants have been able to dispose of soae old pearls when selling the new ones, but they sold them for about a quarter the price which they originally psid for them. Some of the biggest merchants still hold old stock which they cannot afford toto sell at auch loss as if they sold they would become liable for payment of the final instalment of the original cost price- The purchase of pearls on long tine instalments is one of the causes of the present depression but it is inevit able as few people are in possession of ready money. 6. The record peajl which was purchased in Bahrain for £15,000• some five years ago has finally become the property of Princess Milvani nfee Button, 'the Jool^orth heiresa' 1 , who bought it last year in Paris to form the centre of a necklace on the occaaion of her wedding. It was sold in Paris for considerably less than the price paid for it in Bahrain, The Diving Systems. 7. During 1352 there was a further increase of 59 in the number of boats diving on the rChammas system and a corresponding decrease in the Selifieh system. This change is significant. It is an unmistakable sign that merchants have no longer the capital to finance the boats. Briefly the difference between the two systems is as follows.- Selafieh / \ System. The nakhuda borrows money from a merchant with which he pays the annuel advances and finances the boat. The nakhuda receives l/5th of the profits and the remainder is divided among the divers and pullers. The merchant charges interest on his loan to the nakhuda and the nakhuda charges interest on the advances to the divers. (ii) Khammas System . The nakhuda provides the capital himself and takes the share of five-4 five divers. Aocoimts are settled after each trip to the baaks and nu debts against divers are carried over to the next season. Each diver is aavanced a few rupees before each trip. I'he increase in the Khammas system has the advantage of tending gradually to do away with the loan system but it is universally recognised that Khaamas divers are not as efficient as Selafieh divers, they do not remain so long at sea, they dive less frequently during the day and are not so amenable to discipline as they ore not bound to continue diving with the same nakhuda. Regarding the two systems from a broad and humanitarian point of view it is evident that the Khaaaas system is the best, but commercially it is the least profitable. Diving debts. 8. The advances for 1352 were settled as usual at a meeting of the leaders of the diving industry and the announceinent that the advances would be the sa^e as during the previous year raised no protest. Several Deonle at the meeting suggested a further reduction. 9. Very few divers earned more than the total amount of the advances but in many boats the Selafieh divers accepted advances of less than the authorised amounts knowing that if they did not agree the nakhudas would not take them out. The government order forbids the nakhudas to advance^ more than the specified amount, it does not forbid advances of less thanthan this sum, provided that the divers and nakhuda cose to a mutual arrangement. The result Oi, ■ he season is thst most of the divers who received the full advance have increased their debts but most of the Khammas divers earned a small amount. Mortgages• 10. There is a striking feature, very evident in the courts, wMoh reveals the changed conditions in the iving industry. In the old days, some five years ago, the nakhudas never had any difficulty in obtaining money from the aarchants to finance the boats for the reason. During the last two years the merchants have been insisting on receiving mort gages of land and property troia the nakhudas in return for their loans. This is entirely contrary to the spirit of the diving system and is resented by the nakhudas. The merohants on their part cosmlain that owing to the uncertainty of making any profits it is necessary to protect their loans by mortgages. In the past if the nakhuda was unable to satisfy the merchant the latter could only take over the nakhuda*3 boats and divers. Reasons for depression, 11. The depression in the local pearl trade is attributed to the following causes. (i) The European sarkets are dull. (ii) The pearl banks are giving out. The whole diving community agree that the actual quantity of shells on the pearl banks is decreas ing each year. The opinion ia shared by the foreign buyers and refers not only to the Bahrein2 Sabrain oystsr bods but to the pearl banke tlirough- out the Gulf. ..t the end of last season several of the leading men discussed with me the possibility of closing some or all of the banks for a season as is lone in other places in order to give the oysters a chance to breed. Such a step would only be effec tive if the restriction was enforced on ell the pearl ing conmunitiea of the Gulf. Such action would be advantageous in some ways, it would probably result in the merchants selling off all their old stock and in an increase in oysters. The argument against sucii ® stsp would bs thet thousBuds of dlvors would bs out 01 employment for a y@8r« If work oould be found for then during the diving season it would be possible for them to axist, I estimate roughly that about 4 lacs would have to be spent on labour in order to provide work for the Bahrain divers if they did not go to the leerl bonks for one season. (iii) 'he increased manufacture of cultured peerla. Unfortunately for Bahrain the Japanese are manu- iacturing cultured pearls which tire more and more difficult to detect. They tim at doing away with the dark artificial centre of the pearl which now provides the means of detecting its falseness. The government has been asked to instal one of the electric machines for testing pearls. ^ machine oould be purchased but it requires an expert to work it. (iv) The increased number of Khasaas divers. (v) The decrease in the total number of divers.2 (vi) Changed weather eonditions. 'Hiring the list five years wind oonditions have altered. The 'Bara' forty days wind, used to blow before the iiving began, gradually it has started later and it now blows during the iving season with the result that for many days the sea is too rough for diving. The main season cannot be altered as it is settled to coincide with the time that the sea becomes warm end therefore it starts ten days later every year. These are the reasons to which the depres sion is attributed to locally. Cultured pearl case. IE. Khali1 bakr, a ^attar pearl merchant trading in JaJarain, was found guilty of contra vening the cultured pearl regulations. The oase caused widespread interest not only in Bahrain but in all the diving communities throughout the Qulf. The last case of a similar kind was in 1348 when Abdullah AlZaid was sentenced by the Bahrain Court on a similar charge.Police and Public Security. The State Police. 1. The strength of the Police at the end of 1352 was 153 including one Arab officer and eighteen N.C.Os. At present three Indian . jmy N.C.Os end one Indian Police N.C.O are attached to the Police as instructors. All the men in the force were en listed in Bahrain but not all of them are of local origin, soma Persians have been enlisted as well as Swahilis, Sudanese and manumitted slaves. I find that the last category respond well to training and make good policemen. I consider it wise not to enlist only local born men. During the last two years the feeling in Bahrain towards the Police has altered very greatly. There is keen competition to enlist as a police recruit end the local popula tion, which used to regard the nolice with complete lack of interest has now developed a patriotic regard for them. 2, The four men who were sent to India for training with the 10th Baluch Regiment returned after completing a nine months course. The experi ment has been very successful. The men were ;irst put to the ordinary recruits' course, then they were given special training as instructors and iinally they were put in charge of recruits. ihey can nov, train the police recruits by up-to-date methods end they have the great advantage over the Indian instruc tors of being able to speak the language of the men they are teaching. Two of the four men were N.C.Os, the other two young policemen were prgsnoted to Lance Naiks on their return.3. At present about forty men, including two recruit sections, are available for daily- parades. The remainder are occupied by duties including jail guards, point duty in the bazear, steamer parties, aerodrome guards, detachments at liedd, : y uharraq and Sakhir and guards at the Political Agency, Police Station etc., a few men are usually on leave or sick. 4. The health of the present force is better than that of the Indians, Malaria is the most prevalent illness. It increases dur ing certain seasons in spite of constant inspec tions of the Fort and married lines to detect breeding places of mosquitoes. It seems that most of the men acquired the disease before they joined the police. So far there has been a sur prisingly suall amount of venereal disease although the population as a whole are riddled with it. More than fifty per cent of the men who offer themselves as recruits fail to pass the medical examination on account of defective eyesight. The miniffiim height of a police recruit has now been settled at 5ft. Sinches although some of the men who were previously enlisted are consi derably under this height. 5. In addition to their routine duties the police have provided numerous guards of honour during the year for His .ixcellency Shaikh Hamad and various distinguished visitors includ ing the Commander in Chief, £ast India Squadron, and the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq. During the visit of the Mediterranean Destroyer FlotillaFlotilla the Police took part with the Havy in s ceremonial parade and march past in honour of His Excellency Sheikh Hamad, afterwards they entertained 250 sailors at an Arab dinner in the Fort. During his visit the Commander in Chief permitted the marine band of HJI.S.^Hawkifcs' to play on the police parade ground an act which was much appreciated by the police and the local population who attended in great numbers. A proposed national anthem for Bahrain, composed by the bandmaster, was played. Arrangements are going to be made for the tune to be recorded on gramophone records in order that it can be played by the police band. During the anniver sary celebrations of His Excellency Shaikh Hamad's accession the police carried out a ceremonial parade in front of the palace! but unfortunately it was not as well done as during the rehearsals as the noise of the druas and the singing of the Arab dancers made it impossible for the words of command to be hesrd. On one of the days of the anniversary holidays sports were held by the police consisting of races, tugs of war, jumping etc., though most of the sen had never seen or taken part in such an occasion they all displayed the greatest keenness in contesting the various events both individually end in sections. 6. Towards the end of the year the police have been receiving a course of lathi instruction from a H.C.O of the Karachi Police. In ebout two months four sections will be trained and a number of N.C.Os. It is not possible to instructinstruct more than two sections atonoe. The H.C.Os will afterwards be able to teaoh the rest of the police, ^ 7. The Bahrain Fort, which is probably over two centuries old, has become in a very bad state of repair, A large section of the outside wall suddenly collapsed and several places inside are in a precarious condition. Drastic and expensive repairs are required which cannot be carried out at present owing to lack of funds. It has been necessary also to repair the married lines which should be en larged when money is available. The police are encouraged to marry and their sons, of suitable age, attend the government school which is close to the Fort. 8. The artesian well inside the Fort was deepened as the supply of water has always been insufficient. The additional water is now utilised to cultivate ground on the east of the Fort where it will be possible to grow vegetables for the police and the prison. 9. The Government is acquiring a building at Hadd, through a mortgage held by the govern ment, which is to be made into a permanent police station. reviously the police were housed in two open ahops in the main street which were very unsuitable for the purpose. They require a build ing, which could, in case of emergency, be defended as the people of liedd are notoriously turbulent and not always well disposed towards 4 the government.On one occasion, in the past, they made a demons tration against the police* Naturs. 10. The work of the naturs (town watchmen) under the iiiairs has been very satisfactory. They have brought to light a number of cases of theft and smuggling and now that the police are ^rabs, not Indians, there has been more co-operation between the two services. By degrees I hope that the naturs will become a body from whom recruits for the xiolice can be chosen. hen vacancies occur among the naturs they are now filled by men who would be suitable as police recruits when any are required. They obtain experience in police work but do no drill. The Amirs have requested that the naturs should be ordered to wear a distinctive dress, but of local type. The matter is under consideration. Crime. 11. There hove^unusually few serious crimes during the year and no cases of murder. Most of the matters reported by the police have been petty thefts, pickpocketing and brawling. 12* For some years complaints have been made by the villages around Manamah of thefts by a band of unknown men who in some cases used donkeys to carry away the spoil. Cows and sheep have been disappearing in large numbers. Early in the year a house at oinabis was broken into and robbed, among other things a bag of rice was stolen. The owner of the house, an old iirab woman, discovered that the rice was-6- was leeking from the sack and followed the tracks alone to a house among the gardens near Jedhafa. Then she reported the matter to the police who surrounded the house and raided it# The upper rooms of the house were occupied by a mad man who discouraged visitors by throwing stones at them, the ownstairs rooms were the head quarters and store rooms of a band of robbers who had been working evidently for several years. Two lorry loads of stolen property were removed from the house including clocks, carpets, silks, clothes, workmen's tools etc. etc. In one room there was an armoury of Arab guns, revolvers and ammunition and a collection of keys and instru ments for opening locks• One of the gang was arrested in the house and three other members were arrested in the neighbourhood but several more men escaped to the mainland. It appeared that the valuable stolen property was sent to ^attar for sale and the less important spoil was sold in Bahrain. quantities of bones of sheep goats and cattle were discovered in a pit in the compound. Since this case there have been no complaints of organised robberies in the villages. 13. Three cases, each of them similar, of an unusual method of thieving occurred during the year. according to local custom when people are married the bride f s family borrow jewelry and ornaments to be worn by the bride during the first week of her married life. In one case a woman in Muharraq borrowed ornament^ valued-1- valued at Its 5,000/- fro^ a wealthy neighbour. The ornaments disappeared. The bridegroom alleged that they had been stolen. It was found, after iuvestigetion, that he himself had stolen them and hidden them in a drain in a house in Muharraq, The locality of the stolen property was suggested by a profas- aional diviner who appeared himself to be entirely innocent. In two other cases similar robberies were reported and it was found that the family had stolen the goods. 14. j case ocurred in Hedd in which a young rab returned from the diving banks, celled his sister into a roosi and strangled her, leaving h©r, as he thought, dead. The girl recovered and escaped. /hen the brother was arrested he stated to the police, and afterwards to the Court, that he had meant to kill the girl and thought that he had done so as an acquaintance told him that she had brought disgrace on his family during his absence. He was sentenced to five years hard labour. 15. Numerous convictions were obtained in cases of contravention of laws forbidding liquor and opium. The manufacture of arak continues and its prevention becomes more and more difficult as many of the younger members of the Ruling Family ere addicted to it. The illicit importation of opium appears also to be increasing but so far the opium habit has notnot apread to the Arabs and it is used alraost entirely by Persians,Education. !• rhtre is little to report on this subject. Owing to financial necessity the exnancliture on education was reduced in the last Budget from Es 40,000/- to 0,000/- but in spite of this drastic reduction it has been possible to keep all the schools open and the number of students on the rolls has increased during the year from 828 to 966. iii© STersge attendance during the year was 750. Classes in some of the schools have been combined with a consequent reduction in the number of teachers. :as top form of the f\iharra^ boys school takes lessons in ■anamah and in order to save the expense of pur chasing furniture one of the classes in Muharra^ occupies the school mosque as a fons room. The work of education has continued as before though perhaps sonie of the teachers are less efficient than tnose who were employed during the nrevious jear. 2. The distribution of the schools is as follows:- Boys. luharraq - 30?, students. Manaioah - 248 Hedd - 116 Rafaa - 68 ,f ^lawiya - 50 ?f Girls. Maaamah - 108 ff Maharaq - 74 n 966. enrolled. 3. Six boys from the government schools were appointed during the year as apprentice clerks in govermnent offices. In these cases the salary commences at h 50/- per month. There is very great competition among the boys leaving the schools for any vacant posts in the govBrimmt offices. Several locally educated boys have held such posts for sane years and their work has been very satisfactory.&gt;11 3 The jahrain government makes it a practice whenever possible to employ young men who have been educated in the government schools and this does much to enoourace education. 4. The total number of teachers is SO of which 11 only are foreigners. It is still impos sible to obtain suitable locally trained men for the higher posts in the schools or as teschers in the girls* schools. The general management of the schools is left to the Inspector of education, ? r, Adham, who also teBches English to the top classes of the 'aharraq and Maaaaah boys schools, 5. Jit the @nd of the term the school boys as usual produced a play. The one chosen was oliere*© L'avare, preceded by an historical drama, a well known incident in Arab history. Both plays were very well acted and well produced. L^avare was adapted to suit local conditions and made very topical. Various local matters were introduced. 6. Teachers at the boys* schools have been ordered to teach the boys the authorised system of keeping diving accounts. Besides being an exercise in arithmetic this instruction should contribute towards improving the conditions of the diving industry. I a® at present considering issuing to the schools a very short history of Bahrain which could be compiled froin the material which I hove already collected. The general public in Bahrain are entirely ignorant of the past history of their country. 7. If funds were available the scope of the schools could be extended and various local industries might be taught such as carpentry, metal and leather work etc. At present all the carpenters, as well as )&lt;7* -3- as all the mosons in Bahrain ere Persians. The teaching of handiorafts would be even nore vsluGble than the eiucation which is being given at present, ^ntil financial conditions iiaprove no such develop ments could be attempted. 8. The private school be long in?/ to Haj Ibrahim al .^rraiysdh continues to flourish and is attended by about 100 boys. The Persian school has recently extended its building and the American ission school haa a fair attendance. 9. There is a real desire ctnong the parents in Bahrain for their sons to obtain an education and they are not satisfied that the boys should only leern Arabic and thoy constantly ask that more attention should be paid to .English. It is the policy of the schools not to teach English except in the top classes. 10* It has been suggested that the growth of education in Bahrain will eventually form a semi educated class as it has in other similar countries which will disdain manual labour and failing to obtain employment will cause trouble, ocial conditions in Bahrain however are somewhat different to those of other countries. The chief industry of Bahrain is the diving industry and for this work a certain degree of education, esnecially a knowledge of figures, is an advantage. Education in the schools, except in Manomah and Ifuharreq, is of the simplest description and almost all the boys attending Manamah and 'uharraq schools are sons of merchants and small shopkeepers or pearl brokers and nakhudas. Most of them will in the usual way enter the business of their fathers where education-4- education will be an advantage to them. Increased literacy among the divers will defend thera iroiE being cheated in their accounts.Manamah 'Municipality. Revenue 1351 - Es 55,000/- Sxpenditure 1351 - 60,900/- * ♦ HeTenue 1352 - Rs 55,600/- Expeaditure 135E - k 49,400/- 1. The President of the Maataah IMnioipal Council, Shaikh Mohomed bin Shaikh Isa alKhalifah, was absent in Cairo for about four months at the end of the year, Khan Bahadur Abdurrehman Ziani acted as temporary President. liarrett Street* This street, which runs from the Customs Dier up through the bazaar has been greatly improved and has become the chief thoroughfare in the bazaar. The south end has been widened and several shops have been built by the municipality and given as compensation to people whose buildings were demolished in road widening schemes. Khan Bahadur Abdul ^ziz Gozaibi has built a large handsome office on the eastern side of the road, Ahmed bin Yusuf Fakhroo is build ing offices and a motor show room opposite the customs import yard and several other spacious shops and offices have recently been opened in this road. The municipality have decided to roof part of the street with corrugated iron supported on wooden beams and if this experiment is a success it will be adopted, eventually, in other parts of the bazaar. At present the roofs of the streets are made of matting, which is untidy, liable to catch fire, and in need of constant repairing. a small portion of pavement has been built, an improvement which is very useful in a roadroad where there is so much motor traffic. ' 3* Road widening. a narrow laae in the centre of the bazaar wes widened by the total removal of two shops and by reducing the depth of 11 shops, these shops although smaller than before, are now let for higher rents. About sixty feet of Government Road (the sea- road) has been widened on the south by nine feet. It was agreed when the road was built that the owners of land inside the road should allow the municipality to fill in 9 feet along their frontage. Similar work has been done on the Beladiya road, from the Government Road to the Municipal building which has been widened on * one side. This road was treated with concrete and bitumen about four years ago. The work was done by a foreman from the Basrah uaicipality and it has lasted extremely well; when oil can be obtained locally at a cheap price more roads can be improved in this way. I portion of Government Road opposite the Fort has been resurfaced. A road has been partly filled in wast of the Suk al-^rbae across a piece of unreclaimed water inside the Government Roed* Fences were built on the Sehlah road in com pensation for owners fences which were removed when the road was widened last year and a long ditch was filled in. The Bahrain Petroleum Go. have now undertaken the upkeep of this road and have greatly improved the surface. The Ktunicipality were permitted by the government to cut a road through the government land opposite^r_ IS opposite the ^dviserate, a continuation of the road North and South through the town, and also to continue the inner sea road to a junction with Government Road. The government garages were removed and the remaining two plots of land were walled in. ^ Taxi stand « Owing to new buildings on the property of Khan Saheb Yusuf Kanoo it was neces sary to abandon the taxi stand, a tumble down structure of wood and matting on the Korth-last of the Police Station. a new one was built in the centre of the open space opposite the Custom House. The roof is of corrugated iron on wooden pillars and the building is 100 feet long and 15 feet wide. The position of the taxi stand is convenient as it is at the entrance of the Pier, in the centre of the Sea Boad and near the telephone exchange♦ 5. Municipel garden . The waterchannels in the garden have been cleaned out and repaired and in some cases built with cement. The western half of the garden is being planted with trees and shrubs which are irrigated from a new tank connected by a pipe to the artesian well at Masjid Al-Khawaja. The drain from the gardendown to the sea has been re-roofed and doors have been built atiatervals to enable repairs to be carried out inside the drain without the necessity of opening up th^ whole roof. The railings and doors round the garden were painted. The municipal garden is used more every year by the people of the town who frequent it in crowdscrowds espeoially in the summer evenings. The trees are now about seven years old and afford ample shade in the hot weather. The value of property adjoining the garden has increased. 6# Tomb of ihaikh ^tmed al ?ateh . This toab, on the southern edge of the town, is where the iirst Khalifah Shaikh, who conqunred Bahrain is buried. ith the approval of His Sxcellenoy Shaikh Hamad a wall was built round it by the municipality. Filling in swamps . fork was carried on in filling the pits on the southern edge of the town which collect stagnant water during part of the year. About 1000 cubit feet of filling was done dn what will eventually become very valuable land. The joint owners of the evil smelling piece of water between the house of Khan Bahadur itbdul ziz Gozaibi and the premises of the •'osopotamia Persia Corporation, on the south of Government Road were eventually compelled to coimence re claiming it. A considerable part of it has now been filled in. The owners are Khan Bahadur iibdurrehman Ziani and one Yusuf Fakhroo of Muhsrraq. B. Municipal nurse . A municipal nurse was employed during the year and a clinic for women and children was opened near the .jnerioan Mission hospital. The nurse is a qualified midwife and was at one time employed by the ^jaeriean Mission in Bahrain. Free advice and treatment is given at the clinic but a charge is made for maternity cases and attendance at the houses of the patients. During the year 4,500 women and children-6- children were treated end 16 confinements were dealt with. The nurse works in conjunction with the gency urgeon Dr. Holmes. There is great need for more work of this kind asong the women in Bahrain and a government insti tution can do more good than the .jaerioan Mission hospital to which many of the ^rabs are deterred from going owing to its being a religious insti tution. 9. Inspector of ^old . Owing to various frauds having been discovered in the sale of gold orna ments the municipality appointed an Inspector to certify that ornaments container the proportion of gold which they were alleged to contain. n certificate is supplied by the insDector giving particulars of weight etc. 10. Mew vegetable market . His Excellency heikh Hamad built a new fruit and vegetable market on part of his property south of the fish market. Formerly the vegetable market was in the centre of the bazaar in a very congested area which had become an unsuitable location for the sale of fruit and vegetables. The new building which is 250 ft. long end 80 ft. wide, is a covered market roofed with matting which is su rorted with nillarB. It is near the sea and can be kept in a cleaner condition than the old market. ;vs is the case with fish and ineat^ the sale of i^ruit and vegetables is forbidden except in the market which exists solely for this purpose. 11. uniciDal legislation : Unfortunately the coulcil reconsidered the order which was passed during the previous year regarding liability ofJ. £ ». of landlords for the payment of nnmioipal taxes. The old praotice has now been restored and tenants are responsible for payment of municipal taxes with the result that in many cases they evade payment by vacating the buildin a which they hire and leaving Bahrain without giving notice. The members of the council are mostly landlords and are therefore in favour of any measures which^most convenient to themselves. a reduction of 25^ was made in all house taxes. A tax was imposed on hawkers who are now not allowed to work unless they obtain a license to do so from the municipality. 12. Miscellaneous . Six public latrines were rebuilt. A piece of ground on the edge of the cemetery was gifted to I^aj ! ? ohomed Tyeb for the purpose of building a new mosque. The gift was approved by the government. Four bridges on the Tehlah road were rebuilt. Several shops were built by the municipality on their property. All the public artesian wells were fitted with valves and pipes according to the system laid down by the government. The water which accumulated in the swamp on the south of the town was pumped into the channel which carries it to the sea on the eastern shore of Gozabia and the stagnant pools were treated with kerosene in order to prevent mosquitoes from breeding. Repairs were carried on on a number of the roofs in the bazaar.Muharreq Municipality. Revenue - Rs 35,000/- Expenditure - Rs 37,700/-. The work of the Muharraq Municipality has been much curtailed owing to decrease in their revenue and has been confined mainly to small improvements in the roads, and to town cleaning. viuherraQ sea road . The most important work carried out by the Baladiya was the cons truction of a sea road from the pier up to within about 60 feet of the deep water channel. It is now possible for boats to reach the end of this road at all stages of the tide and pas sengers no longer have to suffer the great inconvenience of walking some three hundred and fifty yards along a narrow slippery cause way of loose stones. The road on pier is 1023 feet in length, 23feet wide and has a stone platform at the end about 50 feet square where motor cars can turn. It is built of stone with walls of murabba and a filling of fishti stone surfaced with beaten mud. Four flights of steps exist, one at the end of the pier, two on the north wall and one on the soyth wall. The height of the pier, from the sea bed, varies from io feet to 15 feet. The cost of this building was Es 10,000/- and this sum was subscribed by certain persons of the Siadi family in Muharraq who are trustees of ^Tilth' money and property left by deceased persons and dedicated to good works etc. It is regarded as an achievement that the BahrainBahrain gOTermaent should havo persuaded the trustees of these funds to ^ive money for this purDOse. Ibrbour iiaprovenents . The stone from the original causeway has been utilised by the aunioipality who constructed a mole in the sea on the north of the now pier making a shelter for the harbour from the north wind. In addition to this a large portion of what used to be an insanitary little creek running up towards the town has been reolaimei end is now very valuable property, this reclamation and the construction of the new pier has completely change! the frontage of 'fuharraq and besides improving its appear ance it has 'lade it cleaner and free from smells. artesian wells. am in ''anamah the muni- oipality has irproved the condition of public wells by putting in pipes and valves which prevent waste and overflow of water. In spite of this the town suffers greatly from mosquitoes which breed in the water Jars which are kept in the compounds of every house. The increase in Malaria in Bahrain is undoubtedly due to the increase in water from the artesian wells. A few years ago all water had to be purchased so only an absolutely necessary quantity was kept in the houses. Now water can be obtained freely from the public taps and people who used to keep one water jar in their houses now keep three or four large filled jars which are never entirely empty and which form an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes. Both the municipal-3- ^ / 4 imnicipal counoils have made attempts to deel with the situation but so far with small success. Road widening * Several roads, formerly inaccessible to motor traffic, have been improved by widening. The roads of Muharraq town are still very much narrower than those of Menamah but by degrees improvements are being nade. Municipal taxes . The house and shop tax was reduced by l/3 owing to the present poverty of the people. a municipal tax was levied on palm branches and wood which is stacked for sale on a piece of ground near the sea road which was reclaimed by the hinicipality from the sea. Miscellaneous . ¥ictims of fires in a number of cases were given financial assistance from municipal funds. ^ number of roofs in the bazaars were repaired. Several barasti shops v/ere built on the municipal near •orotmrty recently reclaimed the lier. The contract for town cleaning was considerably reduced with no apDarent ill effects. The muni cipality contributed towards repairing the cemetery mosque. This should have been done from the ^Tilth' but none of the trustees of -Tilth' were willing to contribute. Electric light was instal led in the municiisl offices. A contribution of l/4th of the cost of the new manamah taxi stand was paid to the manamah munici pality. The two municipalities receive half of the revenue collected from motor taxes, the remain ing half is paid to the government.During the year, 1597 oases, including new and old oases, have been dealt with by the various Bahrain Bourts which is an increase of approxiaately 400 oases when ooaroared to the previous year. In spite of this increase the court foes have amounted to a few rupees less than the revenus during 1351. Many of these eases were filed during the previous year, and most of the claims were for smaller amounts than the cases during 1351 or oonsisted of disputes regarding land or water rights which from the stand point of revenue are unsatisfactory matters. 2. One of the most importint cases which came into the court was the settlement of the estate of the late Shaikh Abdurrehman bin Abdulwahab who left property valued at about two lacs. When the estate was divided a number of disputes were settled by the court and a will which was produced by a grandson was judged to be invalid end forged. Shaikh Abdurrehman was considered to be one of the most wealthy members of the Ruling Family. His heirs consist of eight sons and a number of daughters. 3. About 250 cases are nenciing settlement in in the Bahrain court, and almost 120 oases ere pending in the Junni Share Court. This court is notorious for causing delay over the cases which it deals with, a fact which is much resented by the parties who appear before the ^adis. 4. Only seven cases of appeal were filed and in the majority of these the finding of the Bahrain Court was upheld by His jccellency Shaikh Hamad. 5. No new regulations were issued during-2- 41. during the year on judicial matters but two meet ings were held and attended by the full Majlis Tajara and a number of leading men of the pearl industry to disouss various points in the diving rules which owing to the changed times require consideration. A feeling exists, esDecially among the leading shaikhs of the Ruling family, that the Bahrain government should take steps to prevent the houses and property of Bahrain subjects being alienated by acciuisition through foreclosure of mortgages by foreign subjects, usually Persians. During recent years a great deal of house property in Manamah and Muharraq and Hedd has changed hands in this way. 6# The Siadi case^ has not yet been completed. A few points still remain to be settled and certain matters concerning the case which were referred to the Majlis Tajara have not yet been dealt with. 7. During the year the Bahrain Court has been moved from the small room in the government office and is established in a large well ventilated court room in the building behind the government office which was acquired last year. The new court is more convenient and more suitable and in cold weather the public can be accomodated inside the court room at one end of the building. 8. Shaikh Sulman bin Hamad did' not attend the court for several months towards the end of the year and no temporary magistrate was appointed to act for him.' 4') Shia Wekf department. The usual work of this departaent has been carried out during the year without any opposition from the public. It can be assumed that the Shie Sakf department is a recognised institution. When it was first formed there was much opposition to it from the Shia population but its value is now recognised and the work which it carries out is self evident. The financial position of the department is as follows:~ Bolance from 1351 8s 10 t 400/- Income from raatems 12,800/r- ' mosuues 5,200/- Kheirat ' Sales 1,300/- ^ —i 31,900/- Expenditure on.- ^ v aterns , oaa7 Mosuues .. .. 1,300/- Good works .. 1,900/- Repairs to wakfs, ^ ^ , mosques &amp; gardens 8,400/- .Purchase of date trees 1,200/- ^ lend 1,200/- Drilling a well .. 500 a- Departmental expenses 2 ,000/- ^ Balance outstanding, old , debts due to the dept. 15,^0/- nLeases for 1353-4 l^nny Property not yet leased I a R a T Remissions of leases oUUU/- HeT&gt;airr&gt; improvemonts. 125 small ^rdens were repaired. This work usually consists of weeding and digging up the ground and changing the position oi the lesser water channels which should be done every three or four years to prevent the land adjacent to the channels becoming stagnant. Hew date trees are planted at the same time. 3840 young date trees were planted out, some were purchased and soiae were obtained fro® the gardensgardens already under oultivetion* Structural repairs were cerrie i out in 120 mosques in 11 villages, the repairs in most oases consisted of re-roofing and repair ing walls doors and windows. Purchases &gt; Eleven small gardens end plots of cultivation were purchased by the department. In some cases shares in property are wakf and the remaining shores are privately owned. In such cases it is the practice of the department to buy out the private owners if such action appears to be wise. Sales . With the permission of the Shia v aady four sales were made by the department, two pieces of open ground were sold and two gardens. The prices obtained were very high, as the purchasers required them to consolidate their other holdings. The purchase price was spent on buying new gardens in place of the ones which were sold. General. During the year it was found that one of the members of the council was using his position on the council to acquire money in^unsuitable way ; he resigned and an election was held in the usual way for the purpose of appointing a new member. There was some slight agitation during the election organised by the retiring member.Sunni fakf Department, There is little to report of this department. The dapartnient has had much difficulty in collecting its rents owing to the present conditions and in many cases the department has obtained en order from the Court to dis pose of the belongings of its tenants who fail to pay their leases. Re-pairs to buildiiy&lt;a . The school of Shaikh slimed al Mehza in the centre of the bazaar was eventually repaired after strong representations being made to the department by the government• The school enjoys a con siderable income from house property in the bazaar but for many years it has been derelict and the rents have been appropriated by certain members of the family of the original benefactor. The minaret, stairs and windows of Bin- Jamaan mosque were repaired. Several barasti houses were erected on wakf property for leaaring and a new office was built in the bazaar in a building which is property of the department# The mosque opposite the Political i^gency was repaired and replastered. Gardens. ..bout six hundred young date, trees were planted in wakf gardens and fourteen gardens were repaired. iLend Settlement Department. Sales registered 320 Gifts * 12 Registration of titles 105 Transfers 3 Total revenue from above Hs 4,010/-. The revenue from this department has decreased considerably, in 1351 over Es 5,000/- was collected in registration fees and the amount budgeted for in 1352 has not been realised. The reason for this is the decline in land values and value of house property also a falling off in the number of registrations of titles. Out of 320 sales 227 were for properties whose value ?/8s less than h 500/- on which a minimum fee of k 5/- only was paid. It ia possible how ever that the prices in these sales were deli berately understated in order to avoid payment of higher registration fees by the applicants for registrations. In addition the apartment has issued 20 title deeds to the lakf }epartiaent on which no fees are collected, 51 properties were sold through the Land Departeient by order of courts, and 11 plans and reports were submitted to the courts regarding property involved in legal disputes. Only two surveyors have been employed during the year so it has been impossible to continue the survey work of the districts of Bahrain which have not yet been surveyed. The previous survey work and the detailed maps and registers of water rights etc. is of great permanent value and these records are constantly referred to by the court. It is-2- is unfortunate that owin/? to neceBsity for economy this valuable and important work cannot be completed. Several villages including the adjacent date groves and the islenda of Sitrah and Jezirah have not yet been surveyed. Government forns . The sua of Es 2,223/- wss realised from the sale of government forms which are compulsory in the case of sanads, wak&amp;las and diving baruas. Though these dcouments do not in themselves constitute any proof of the matter contained in them, and they are not registered in the government office, yet they are popular with the general public. Ground rents . The government leases plots of ground which are occupied by barasti houses. In many oases a merely nominal rent is imposed on these sites in order to establish the govern- nent's ownership of the land, in other cases the full value is charged. The total revenue from this source was h 1,52?/-, An additional fts 227/- was obtained by sales of small pieces of ground usually to the owners of adjacent land who wished to round off their property. in ah trans . Over 300 fish traps licenses were renewed during the year. The Land Department dealt with the question of the Sitrah group of fish traps which were rendered useless owing to the activities of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. These fish traps are the source of the supply of prawns which areare dried and sold in the Bahrain markets. The matter was a complicated one but a settlement was eventually arrived at by which the Bahrain Petro leum ooroany took over the lessee of all the fish traps until the end of the season when the question will have to be discussed again. The value of the fish trat&gt;3 which were affected is in the neigh bourhood of lis 20,000/-. Public works . No vork except essential repairs has been carried out during the year. ipart from the usual unkeep of buildings the following work was done. The south wall of the customs import shed was rebuilt. A large portion of it collapsed and it wts necessary to re-build it. The parapet of the wall along the sea side of the western sea road was repaired. It had been seriously damaged by boats being anchored to it. The 'colice now have orders to prevent owners of boe ts from tying up alongside the wall. The married quarters at the fort were re -roofed. A portion of the government office, which^as previously a veranda, was enclosed and made into an office. Ovdn: to the :;reat number of files and records more room had to be obtained for the clerks to work in. H.^.F. Pier . The Land Department arranged for the building of a pier 1600 feet long opposite the Royal /dr Force rest house. The work viias done by contract and a supervisor from the Land Department was lent to the to supervise the building. The contract was made before the diving season but comencement of work ^as delayed until after the diving so the contractor made a considerable profit.Bahrain Electric Supply, The information in this report is supplied by Mr. /• B. Steele, the State ngineer# !• Load , The department has been advereely affected during the year by the state of trade; the returns for 135S however show an increase of load over 1351. 2, The following extra load hes been con nected during the year, 415 points making a total of 17 Kilowatts, of which 312 are light points and 103 fan and power points. Five refrigerators and three domestic water pumps have also been connected during the year, making a total of 18 rilowatts. During the yeer 98 houses were vdred, 83 in Manamah and 15 in uharraq. Revenue from connected load in 1352 was u 30,986/B as compared vdth Is 27,462/14 in 1351. 3» irin contracts . 'iring for light and power has been carriei out by the department, usually by contract, as during the previous year, the price -w point being generally the same. It is not possible to reduce the price of wiring without incurring loss, it is being kept at the present low level in order to encourage the use of electricity. In almost every case lead covered laleeco wire and fittings are used as there is a local prejudice against using vulcanised India- rubber cable on porcelain cleats though the nrice of this system is about half the price of the ^aleeco system. The cheaper method is used exten sively in all other countries and although not so permanent it is quite safe. This year a few small-2- '5 amull shops have been wired on the cheeper system so possibly locol feeling is changing. ^ Sakhir svatA^. complete lighting system and two olar lighting sets wers installed by the department at His Excellency Shaikh Hamad's country palace at Sakhir. This installation was paid ior by the Bahrain Petroleum Company who presented it to ilia Excellency. 5. Telephone system. The use of telephones in Menaaah has become increasingly popular and ten more subscribers have been added during the four more applications have now been received making a total of SO which is the full capacity Ox the exchange. The estion of obtaining another 25 line exchange is under consideration but it is unlikely that this will be purchased until after six months and then only if sufficient applications are received to justify its installation. The Bahrain Petroleum Company have a telephone system at their camp connecting the -.veils and this will shortly have S6 lines. The company wishes to run a lino into Manamah to connect up to the government exchange; an arrangement is being con sidered which should be advantageous to both parties. It would be very useful if a line could be carried over to ruharraq but the cost of this would be expensive owing to a need for a submarine cable across the Jeep water channel,at present, for fin ancial reasonsjit cannot be installed. ■amicip al Ice plant . The municipal ice plant, which is inside the power house, was run successfully by the staff of the power house during 1352.-3- A profit was imde and a longer run than usuel was sustained, fro® 15th Muherram until 11th Rajab. o^ing to the age of the plant, which is 15 years old, it was necessary to purchase a number of spare porta etc. The municipal council do not '■ ' recit te the necessity for this and ere inclined to consider such expenditure as unnecessary. ^ Consunntion of units . in 1351 the units were not in -oroportion to the number of extra points connected owing to the increasing use o. low •vatua r *e Japanese lamps by the rab consumers, .i t is difficult in such txmes as these to deter the public from using cheap lamps but their use results in a reduction in the revenue from consumption. The Japeneae lamas are merked as low as 5 watts. Usually under tests these lamps take a good deal more but in any case they consume much less than the lowest wattage lamps used for ordinary lighting, which are 25 watts; these cheat) Japanese lamps give vary little light but their cheapness appears to outweigh their effectiveness in the eyes of the public 8. Japanese -.irln • material . Owing to its dangerous nature the import of Japanese wiring material has been forbidden. It was reported on very adversely by the State Engineer as being liable to cause fire by fusing. 9- Befriaerators . The 3ahrain Electric Supply department has now obtained the sole agency for International General electric Company's refri gerators. The majority of the machines installed in Bahrain are of this make and standardisation is advisable from the point of view of maintenance and-4- e&gt;4 and spares. The ollar exchange is favourable and the machines, which are vary good in operetion are considerably cheaper then those of European manufacture. 1 well known English make was tried, alectrolux, but the price was very high and the firm does not manufacture modtils larger than two cubic feet larhich is too small to be popular in Bahrain. In selling the machines the price is kept as low as is possible as the main object of the department is to increase consumption of power. At present 19 refrigerators have been installed and orders have been placed for four more. 10. Prospeots for 1353 . It can be reason ably assumed that wiring will proceed during the next year at the present rate. The irelesa station of the International Comunications, Ltd., is installing a Kilowatt motor generator and by 1st June 1934, it will be ready to change over to the Bahrein system. The station is taking orer the work of the temporary station erected by the Royal Air Force for their use and the use of Imperial Airways. Some additional revenue will accrue froin this source. The load curve of the department has risen steadily each month since the date of starting in May 1930, though the rise has been saall it has been in the ri^ht direction. The sale of electrical appliances has been fair but the department has suffered from the com- ■petition by Japan whose electrical articles are sold at a very low price and though of inferior quality the public purchase them as they cannot afford to buy better appliances.% W - Agriculture. 1* Rioe crop . IChan Behadur Abdul ivziz Gozaibi, one of the most enterprising land ovmers who is more interested in agriculture than any other private individual, experimented success- fujly during the summer by planting rice in sane rich well watered ground near Jau Zaidan which he recently acquired from Shaikh ^bdullah bin Isa. About 60 pounds of Hassa seed was sown and it provided a crop of about 1B50 pounds. A profit of about 20^ was made. I understand that the A experiment is to^repeated next year. 0raa-:e cultivation . ore than four dozen oranges were grown in Shaikh Hamad's garden at Sinian. They were of very :ood quality and size and many of them weighing as much as between 10 - 14 ounces. A few trees died during the year as they received too much water. The irri gation presents difficulties as the trees are planted among the rows of date palms which ere watered in the usual way on certain days of the week. S* Date crop . The ate crop and the market for dates were slightly better than last year and there were neither storms, disease or locusts to damage the crop. although the area planted with date trees is steadily increasing and more iates are being grown yet the Bahrain dates are insufficient to mset the local demand and dates are imported from liassah and Iraq. Owners of date gardens, especially certain members of the Ruling Family, complain inces- /-2~ incessantly that their tenants fail to pay their rents# In many oases this is true but the gardens ere almost always leased for more than they are worth as the tenants assume that a certain proportion of the rent will be cancelled according to an old and very misleading custom* Becently the landlords have given up granting any remission with the result that most of the tenants are prosecuted in the court by the land lords at the end of the lease for recovery of rent. In most cases they are unable to pay so their houses and belongings are sold by anction by order of the Court. 4. No attempt has been made by the Govern ment during the last two years to develop the agricultural potentialities of the country, cwing to lack of funds, but I am confident that there are great possibilities of improvement and e .nan- si on in this direction. Thousands of acres of land are suitable for cultivation in areas where it is known that artesian water can be obtained. Few people grow anything except dates, lucerne ani the few local fruits and iregetables which have always been cultivated hare. It is now known that cotton, oranges and rice can be gjown success fully in Bahrain. ill of these crops have valu able possibilities. 'any Kuropean vegetables ■•row well in Bahrain end there is an ever increas- inp, demand for thero as well as for different varieties of fruit, not only among the foreign population but among Arabs who have acquired a taste for them when travellini? in Iraq and in India. Encouragement is needed from the government^0 government which should lead the way by making an experimental garden for ruit and vegetables which could be sold in the vegetable market♦ The government should sell seeds to owners of gardens and possibly organise competitions in garden produce. This requires time and money neither of which are available at present. m ■Generel. 1. Bahrain subjects resident abroad . During the year a number of complaints were made to the Bahrain government by the Shia Bahrainis living in Qjftsbah on the Persian ooaet alleging that the Persian authorities disregarded the nationality certificates which they had obtained in Bahrain and forced them to adopt Persian nationality and to do military service. Towards the end of the year the oppression by the local authorities increased and one Bahrain subject was killed. A petition was received by His excellency Shaikh Hamad from the leaders of the Bahraini com- minity at v asbah« Owing to the drastic taxation which has lately been imposed on the people of Katif by the Saoudia government a number of Behrainis long resident in Xatif evade 1 the government authorities and fie to Bahrain. The policy of the Saoudia government has been to allow the men of Katif to come and go between Bahrain and Katif but to pre vent the women from leaving the place. During the last quarter of the year about two hundred people from Katif, roen and women, escaped from Katif and returned to their villages in Bahrain. The women disguised themselves as men and in this way they were able to evade the authorities. The Bahrain community in asbah and in Katif consist of Shia Bahrainis who left this country i. 11 some twenty years ago, or more, owing to tne . oppression by the Ruling Family and the Sunuis• ■ Since then conditions have changed in Bahrain^ v \ ( religious toleration is accorded to all sects and5°^ -E- and the Shias in Bahrain have now nothing to fear from the Ruler. Those Bahrainis in Katif who do not own property now wish to return to Bahrain but the Bahrainis in Qasbah wish to remain in Persia in possession of their property but retaining Bahrain nationality. This, according to Persian law, appears to be impossible. 'kiharram celebrations . It is an interesting sign of the times that during the last four or ..'ive years eaoh year the Muharram celebrations in Bahrain have increased. !-any more people take part in the processions and each season new innovations appear. Shias from Katif and numbers of Persians visit Bahrain for the ten days of Muharram as these religious celebrations are not encouraged in their own countries. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad and most of the Sunni Arabs show a remarkable degree of toleration to these demonstrations which are essentially anti-Sunni. iiis Excel lency Shaikh Hamad invariably lends camels and horses to take part in the procession. 3. The pil^rima^e . There has been an increase in the number of Shias who have done the pilgrimage to the sacred cities of Iraq but very few people from Bahrain went to leoca this year. The only person of any importance who did the pilgrimage was Shaikha i ^yesha bint Mohomed, the widow of the late Ruler Shaikh Isa. The chief reason for the falling off in pilgrims from Bahrain is the increased expense and theand the taxation which is imposed on pilgrims by the Saoudia govcrnaent. The Shia Bahreinis visit Mecca less than they used to since about four years ago a tomb in Mecca which was much yenerated by the Shies was destroyed by the authorities in P ecca. 4. The Khalifah ^smily . The deaths occurred during the year of two prominent shaikhs of the Ruling family, Shaikh Abdurrahman bin .Mulwahab and Shaikh Ibrahim bin Mohomed. The foriser was a contemporary of Shaikh Isa and used to be known as his Wazir. For a^me years he had been in his second childhood. ^fter his death there was a law suit in the Bahrain Court in which his eight sons contested the validity of an alleged will which was produced by one of his grandsons. The will was proved to be a forgery. The property involved was valued at about two lacs of rupees. Shaikh Ibrahim bin 'ohomed was a brother of Shaikh Rashid and one of the sons of Shaikh Mohomed bin Khalifah who died in exile. He was better educated than any of the Khalifah Shaikhs and took great interest in happenings outside Bahrain and in European uolitics. He kept in touch with outside events by taking in a number of periodicals from all parts 01 the world. lie took no part in local affairs, beyond criticising the government. He died of diabetes which is a complaint that a great many of his family suffer 'rom. On 4th June a son was born to ShaikhShaikh Sulman bin Shaikh Hamad who was named Isa after the late Ruler. The birth of an heir to Sheikh Sulman was regarded locally as a matter of importance. Another of His Excellency Shaikh Haioad'a sons had a son on the same day. 5. Kuwait visit . In June the Hhaikh of Kuwait paid a visit to Bahrain. He was given an official reception mth a guard of honour and salutes. He travelled on his new yacht• In December His Excellency Shaikh Hamad paid a short visit to Kuwait taking with hiro a number of his relations and many of the leading Arabs, a party of eighty people. He travelled to Kuwait and back to Bahrain on H.M.S. 'Shoreham'. His Excellency Shaikh hmad al Jabr re cently purchased some land in Bahrain, near the wireless station, and it is understood that he proposes to build a house on the site. 6. anniversary celebrations * It has been decided that the anniversary of the acces sion of H. £. Shaikh Hamad shall be kept as an annual public holiday. For three days the toms of Manaaah and Muharraq were decorated and illuminated at night. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad received visitors at the Palace where /irab dances took place and on one night he himself drove round the Manamah bazaar, visiting some of the chief merchants in their shops and offices. The people of ManamahMl -5- Manamah showed great enterprise and ingenuity in decorating buildings and streets and in arrang ing electric lights on various buildings. His excellency 1 s motion in visiting the boz^or wqs much eDpreciated and he received a great ovation fro© the crowds which had assembled there from all parts of the islands. Although there was no compulsion it was noticeable that every house, even the smallest huts, displayed some sort of flag or decoration. Postage stamns. The question of a surcharge on the stamps used from Bahrain, which was originally suggested by me some five years ago, was finally decided and frota 9th August 1933 stamps were issued bearing the surcharge 'Bahrain'. The surcharge at present is not on air mail stamps. It is hoped, locally, that in the future it will be possible for the Bahrain stamps to bear a dis tinctive design such as the head of the Ruler of Bahrain. Bahrain surcharged stamps are not recognised in Persia. Becipients of letters bearing these stamps are made to pay an amount corresponding to the postage. This action of the Persian Government causes considerable inconvenience in Bahrain. Regular postal communication now exists between Bahrain and Saoudia .jrabia but very little use is made of this method of communication as it is only once weekly. ersons sending letters to and from Bahrain usually send them by messenger or by the hands of a nakhuda as travellers between the two countries come and go almost every day.8* The jdaerican y ission* The medical staff of the ..merioan I'isaion has been increased by the addition of Dr. Thorns who is a specialist in eye diseases. A European nursing home is being built partly in the garden of the men's hospital and partly on a small piece of ground, adjacent to the Shia cemetery, which was given to the Mission for the building. The Mission continues to maintain a school for boys and another for girls; the students at both these schools ere mostly foreigners and a great pro portion of them are jews. An additional oiece of ground which was given by the Bahrain government as an extension of the Christian cemetery has been walled round and new gates and repairs have been made to the old cemetery. The funds for this work were collected locally by the American Mission. 9. Press propoRanda . There has been a decrease in the amount of press propoganda about Bahrain in the jrab and Persian news papers which is probably due to the strictness in giving visas to journalists who used frequently to visit Bahrain. The most inaccurate and mis chievous article which appeared during the year was in the ^Sphere 11 of SOth September. It is regrettable that an English newspaper of good reputation should have published an untrue and damaging description of Bahrain. 10. Counterfeit coins . At the end of 1351 a serious position was caused owing to the nusiber of counterfeit and suspect rupees which were circulated in the bazaar. ill coins were tested~7~ tested by the Bank and by governnent offices and shops and more than 5% of the coins in currency were considered to be doubtful. The Bank finally accepted coins without ring ing them. Other offices did the same and the merchants followed suit. For the time being the matter has subsided but I am of the opinion that a great many false rupees are still in circulation in Bahrain, 11 • Pier . A narrow pier, 1,600 ft. long, was built by the Royal Air Force from their Rest House into the sea. The Bahrain government assisted the B.ii.F. by making arrangements for the work to be done by contract. Notices were issued celling for teniers and finally the contract was given to Haj /bdul SeM Bushiri, a Persian merchant, who constructed the pier for u* 19,000/-. although it is thought that the contractor made a handsome profit other tenders far exceeded the amount for which Haj Abdul l^ebi contracted. The system of work by contract and tender is not popular in Bahrain and is never practised locally. There is no regular method of measuring stone as it is always valued by boat load, and boats vary considerably. 12# Inrnerial Airways . The question of the lease of the Muharraq aerodrone was settled at the end of the year. The aerodrome has been used continuously through out the year and abnormal high tides and rain have not affected it. The Bahrain government provide a police guard on all occasions when the aerodrome is used by the Imperial airways or by the E.A.?. machinesCustoms The following report has been provided by Mr. G. deGrenier, the Director of Customs.

Total increase Hs 26,046/- decrease 773/- Net increase Ht 25,273/- It will be remembei'ed that in Hamadhan 1351. the ninth month, the rates of import duty upon t? luxury articles 11 was changed from 1to 10^ s.v. and also the rale upon alcoholic liquor and tobacco was changed from 10' to 15' a.v. This change operating for three months in 1^51 could not make a marked difference in the collections; but in IS-'2 the effect is noticeable and would account, to soise extent, for the increase in Customs receipts. IW'.2- l&gt; 1 The decrease of m 36?/- in vehicle licenses is explained by en adjustment in the method of oollectin; these dues, by which a vehicle registered in the letter'half of the year would pay one half of the annual tax. instead of. as pre- viously, the tax for the whole year* .he increase in the collGctioni from yearling licenses is accounted for by the collection in 1352 of a number of arrears in 1351• The decrease of k 406/- in craft registrations is accounted for by the prompt payments of the renewal fees in 135E by the owners of craft, who have thus saved themseiYes the penalties of late lees. Since there has been no change in the rates of collection of duty during the past year, a comparison of the classified receipts may be of interest:- Comparison of receipts. 1351 1352 Steamers cargoes h 294,400/- S66.710/- Nati?e craft 81,870/- 82,266/- Paroels duty 16,519/- 16.470/- Ixport duty 1,913/- 94l/- 2| duty on R.E. cargo 2,345/- 20,527/- Miaoellaaeous fees 7.662/- 7,211/- Import yard collection 153,S8l/~ 162,755/- Total Ei — 558~a90/-~ '556^880/-'' In reference to the above, for 1352, the item of R.E. collec tions should be read with steamers* oargoes collections, since the marked increase in collections froir Direct Pranshipment cargo is the result of the arrangement for ^overside delivery 1 of EtE. bag cargo in quantities of not less than one thousand bs^s. This arrangement is of considerable benefit to aie Kejdy meronants, but the customs department suffers in the loss of the relative Import Yard Charges. There is no doubt that this arrangement is also of assistance to the J .I. . .Company Ltd., in amntain- ing freights to Bahrain, although it is sore than probable that (if this arrangement did not exist) such cargo would be dis- cherged at Dubai and thence traasuorted to the raeinland by native craft as is now very largely the case with piece mods and tea. But unfortunately tuis arrangement does not assist the Hindu merchants in Bahrain their trading with the mainland, since, on account of local residential restrictions there, such merchants feel that they are not afforded opportunities to cornnete on e^ual terms tith the Hejdy merchants. It is Quite likely that this position may be brought to the atten tion of Higher Authority, but from the customs point of view the arrangement ensures a simple method of collecting R.E. duty, and, it may be added from a general point of view, fairly regular employment for tjdy native craft. Moveover, it should be noticed that s.s,-rhu2istan rt a British Tanker steamer operating from Abadan, :oes an extensive business in the sale, by overside delivery, of it.P.O.Coy's products for transfer to the mainland by native craft. although the collections of export duty (on dates and shells) in any year are small, the marked decrease in 1352 is to be-3- 70 to be noticed. The explanation is that on let ..pril 1933 taere occurred a Tioleat, almost cyclonic storm, which ruined iiii-ly one tnird of th© d&amp;te blossoms5 and t^o harvest in Bahrain and the mainland suffered accordin ly. In this storm the heaviest rainfall in Bahrain— 2.78 inches — was recorded. Other colleotions are consistedt. The decrease in the collections froia steamers T cargoes nay be explained by (a) the increase in the import of cheaply produced taDanese goods, and (b) a decrease in the value of general com modities.

Yet it is noticeable that the imports of cotton piaoegoods have decreased, while wfe woollen goods have markedly increase.. The reason is that the use of woollen underwear xs now coming into favour locally, but the re-e port trade in cotton piecegoods e.g. to Persian ■-orta, has fallen off here, while, I understand, such exports A from Dubai have increased. lOther factor is the very high import duty levie ! upon Japanese products in the mainland ports, which has restricted're-exports by Uejdy traders. of building materials „ ji ,\jx 'jj wv port of the s.s.^Yoshida aru' a Japanese steamer, v/hich brought thirteen thousand bags The marked increase in value of imports is accounted for by the arrival at this of cement for four local importers mality but was packed in unnies of _ is 91 interest to note^that recently^ This cement was or ^oou inferior quality; and it , , T i u a Japanese trade agent visited the Persian Gulf ;orts including Bahrain, and it is said that Japanese cargo steamer is likely to visit the4- ii? the Persian Gulf every month if there is sufficient inducement to justify tae expense. echo of this Tentnre hes been the rec at two importations of British Portland cement in competi tion with the Japanese product while Indian cement from Por- bunder als comes forward by native craft.

I attach herewith a detailed comparison of collections accord ing to the various rates of import duty, from which it will be seen that the iecrease in collections is upon steamers cargoes, It is satisfactory to observe that the colioctions from native craft and parcels maintain their level. There will also be noticed a marked increase in collections at 15$ a»v. which is levied upon alcoholic liquor and tobacco. The consumption of these commouties is not regarded with favour by the better- class Muslim religious sentiment; and although the sale of ecieekei alcoholic liquor is strictly supervised, the number of con sumers has increased in the past year m ing to industrial deve lopments locally. For this reason I have already suggested that the duty upon these commodities should be increased to twentyfive per cent a.v. Comnarison of rates of collections. Source. Year. 1351.

In addition to the occasional light on the anam r. ^ler and the harbour light at the Viharao customs, the Persian Gulf Lighting uthority has put a red flashing light upon the 'us Zarven Beacon which adds to the amenities of the port, although its usefulness to navigators is not very clear.
