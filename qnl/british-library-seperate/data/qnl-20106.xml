Kemball states his apprehension over a contested succession in Dubai, in the wake of the death of Sheikh Maktum bin Butti, and Sheikh Sai'd bin Tahnun of Abu Dhabi's designs on Dubai. Two enclosures are included with the letter:1) A translation of a letter (ff 201-02) from Hajee Yacoob, the British agent at Sharjah, to Kemball, dated 2 October 1852. Yacoob reports on a number of events: a Dubai vessel and its crew being attacked by armed men at Wukrah [Al-Wakrah]; and a raid by the Beni Kuttub tribe on the Beni Yas, in which 80 camels were taken and one man killed, resulting in increased tensions and negotiations for the return of the camels and payment of blood money, between Sheikh Sa'd in Tahnun of Abu Dhabi and Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr of Ra's al-Khaymah;2) A translation of a letter (ff 203-04) from Hajee Yacoob, the British agent at Sharjah, to Kemball, dated 27 October 1852, reporting on intrigues at Dubai during Sheikh Sai'd bin Butti's absence, involving the capture of the fort at Dubai by the late Sheikh Maktum bin Butti's sons Soheil and Husher, in collaboration with their maternal uncle Majid ben Dulmuuj.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051547.0x00004b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
