The Viceroy's House, Wev&lt; Lelhi. October 5th 1»3». My dear, I have been receiving, since the outbreak of war, a number of financial contributions and offers of money, both for war purposes gen erally and for specific objects, such as the relief of the wounded con nected with war, and I have no doubt that you have been receiving similar contributions and offers. My difficulty in using these offers to the fullest advantage is due to the fact that the demands likely to be made upon India in the course of the campaign are still uncertain. But I feel strongly that it would be a great pity to allow the first flush of enthusiasm to disappear, or seriously to diminish, merely because of our failure to try to turn it to advantage. I have, therefore, as you will have seen from the announ cement in the Press on Friday, September 2i?th, decided to open a War Purposes Fund of myWn, to be administered by me with the assistance of an Appeal Committee, and I am inclined to suggest that if in your Pro vince contributions or offers of contributions are reaching you on any scale, and unless you prefer to advise enquirere to contribute to my Fund, you might think it wise, to establish a similar fund of your own into which contributions could be paid, pending the announcement of a more general appeal. In the same connection, there has been correspon dence with your Secretary as regards an appeal on behalf of the Bed Cros* but though I myself think we ought tot to postpone the issue of that ppeal very much longer, the time, I am advised, is hardly ripe for it. In any case as soon as I can assemble the seven or eight members of My Appeal Committee in Delhi, a further full statement will be issued about my War Purposes Fund, and the objects for which and the manner in which it will be applied. The Committee will also have to consider how my Fund is to be related to other funds which are likely to be raised for special purposes connected with the war, and as soon as these matter have been decided and publicly explained, the way will be clear towards directing public generality into the most useful channels. Yours sincerely, Sd/- iiXfci.ITiiaO*.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA External Affaire Department EXPRESS LETTER From To V i n Foreign, New Delhi* 1.

Bavidge Under Secretary to the Government ofoA Hie Excellency the Viceroy’s War Purposes Fund. — ( 3 ) his excellency the '/iceroy opened his o’ar Purposes Fund nearly two raonthe ago with the intention of providing an objective for the spontaneous and loyal offers of service and assistance made so generously throughout India on the outbreak ol the war, and of enabling those who wished to contribute im mediately to the war effort of India to do so, even before it was clearly apparent in what direction that effort could most usefully be applied. donations offered and paid into this Fund have already exceeded He.60 lakhs. Some of these donations have been made for specilic purposes, such as for the purchase of aircraft, for war hospitals and ambulances, for comforts for the troops serving in India and abroad, for the relief of those who are wounded, blinded and disabled in war and for the dependents of those who are Killed. All such donations will be applied according to the wishes of the donors. All other donations for which no special object is named will be applied by His Excellency the Viceroy at his discretion in lurtherance of India’s war effort and for benef- icient purposes connected with the war. ^ir ^rnest Euraon, K.C.1.S.,C.S.I•, and Mr.A.C.Badenoch, S.S.I.,C.I.E., have been appointed by His Excellency to be Joint Honarary Treasurers of the Fund, and further contributions should be addressed to the Honarary Treasurer to His Excellency the Viceroy’s War Purposes Fund, Office of the Auditor General of India, Imperial becretariat, New Delhi. His excellency the Viceroy proposes immediately the transfer from his War Purposes Fund, as a first allotment in each case, the following sums; He.50,000 to the Central Joint .&lt;ar Committee 01 the British Red Cross bociety; Rupees one lakh to the central Joint War Committee of the Indian Red Cross society /Society and St* John Ambulance Association, and Hupees one lakh to the St.Dunetan’s Hostel for blinded soldiers, sailers and airmen* separate appeals for funds will be made in India on behalf of the two latter institutions, and His Excellency hopes that the direct contributions made in response to these appeals will be fully as generous as they deserve. bir Glutha Mackenzie, who was himself blinded in the war of 1914-18, has been appointed by St* Dunsta^s to prosecute the appeal in India on behalf of that body, and an undertaking has been given that nt* Dunstan’s will do their best to extend to all Indian soldiers who may be blinaed in the present war the special care which it has been the business of St* Dunetan’s to devise in order to mitigate the tragic consequences of blindness and to give the blind a better prospect of a happy and useful life* dated 13/11/39. \ \ \CONFIDENTIAL.

When I discovered that these prisoners were being held here aooard fai* H.M.S.

The Senior Naval Officer agreed and I accordingly informed His Highness a in secret interview yesterday. I impressed upon His Highness L* r the need for keeping this to himself. 3. I should have liked to borrow these prisoners to march them through the town for moral effect, but recognise that this is not a practical proposition. Curiously enough no word seems to have reached the bazaar yet that they are aboard H.M.S. 'Falmouth' in spite of the fact that they must be seen daily-if only by tne coolies working in the Base. Political Agent, Bahrain.ConfidtrUal D. 0 .No .C/865-28/1, Dated the 8th July 1940. I make the suggestion that comes below with some diffidence as it is a matter outside my province, but it derives largely from two casual remarks which I have heard recently from experts on desert transport. One was a to the effect that the British Army* s desert equipment was tyre is the most inefficient of its type in the world. 2. At the moment the Indian Army is undergoing a vast expansion, and this expansion will presumably include trans port of all kinds which may be required for desert warfare, whether the desert be stony or sandy. Would it not be a Bound idea to pick the brains of this American Oil Company in Arabia, which ie so Justifiably proud of its dessrt equip ment ? 1 am not an admirer of all things American, (in particular the administrative work of these oil companies seems to me quite pitiful), but one cannot ignore the fact that they spend enormous sums of money on experiment in order to provide themselves with the very best equipment they can obtain when they go into new country. The California Arabia people have done a great deal of experimental work in Arabia on trucks and tyrss alike and as a result they nov/ have arrangements with some of the big American producers to supply { them with transport and tyres of all sizes to their own specifications. In particular I would mention the Inter comment by a very reserved American geologist who has recent ly spent a good deal of time in the western desert in Egypt 'rather obsolete'. The other was that the Dunlop desert The Hon 1 ble Lieutenant Colonel C.G.Prior, C.I.B., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, national /■ BushIre.- 2 - International and Autocar heavy lorries, and the Atlas desert tyres for them, which I have myself seejv operating in an astounding manner over the most appalling country* 3* I know for a fact that the Company would be more than ready to pass on any information that might be useful and it occurs to me that it might be worth while for the Array in India to send two or three of their transport ex perts up here to see for themselves the Oil Company* s road equipment and to consult the exhaustive reports that have been made on it from time to time. It would cost nothing much either in time or money and it might be extremely valuable* Yours sincerely,si' f O Telegram 'S” From Government of India, Simla.

Most Secret. Foreign Office, November 26, 1940. Sir, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to transmit to you herewith a copy of a secret memorandum regarding the activities of “ Cargo Superintendents (London), Ltd.” I am to request that you will furnish a report on any of the activities of this organisation which may come to your notice. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, ALEXANDER CADOGAN. His Majesty's Superintending Consular Officers at Ports, and also at Budapest, Belgrade, Cairo. 11*215 21876—8Enclosure. Caugo Superintendents (London), Ltd. Some investigations have been made into the activities of Cargo Superintendents (London), Ltd., 48 Fenchurch Street, a subsidiary of a Swiss Company, the Socidtd G(*n4rale de Surveillance S.A., Geneva. The latter controls a network of companies all over the world under various names. The organisation as a whole is an offspring of the firm of Goldstuck Hainze and Co., which, from a head office in Paris and branches in all European ports, carried on a very large business before the Great War. Early in 1915 this firm was closed down in this country. Although ostensibly the firm consigned shipments of copper, cotton and other commodities to Denmark and Holland, investiga tion suggested that these commodities might be very likely really to be destined for Germany. This, and the suspicion that the firm was engaged in espionage, resulted in notices being posted at the gates of quays of French and British ports to the effect that employees of Goldstuck Hainze were forbidden access to the docks. Among the employees forbidden to enter the docks were five of the present shareholders of Cargo Superintendents. Cargo Superintendents’ business is the dockside superin tendence of weighing, loading and discharge of cargoes of all kinds of bulk produce, from grain and seeds to timber, hides and oils. This firm has been appointed official wheat testers to the Cereals Imports Committee, and has repre sentatives at almost every port in this country; they are therefore in a position to supply information to the enemy regarding movements of ships,’ of which, it appears, they have advance knowledge. Furthermore, owing to their intimate knowledge of the docks, they are a potential danger from the point of view of sabotage in general, and of. the contamination of grain in particular. They are also in an almost unique position to signal to and advise the enemy in the event of an invasion. A photostat (Annex A) is attached showing the ramifica tions of the Societe Generale de Surveillance S.A., Geneva, all over the world. The head of the parent company in Geneva is Jacques Salmanowitz. His relatives hold positions of authority in many of the subsidiary companies all over the world. ■Jules Salmanowitz, his brother, is head of the Superinten dence Company Inc., New York, while there is ar D. L. Salmanowitz in Cargo Superintendence, Ltd., at the Port of London. The combine appears to be mainly controlled by Jews. 1 he personnel of the subsidiary companies abroad can be seen at enclosure (Annex B). In February 1940 an informant gave some detailed information about the Soci6t4 G6n6rale de Surveillance S.A., (reneva, and ( argo Superintendents in particular, denouncing the latter for tax evasion and the whole concern as an espionage organisation, although supplying little evidence of a concrete nature. I he informant specified the types of information which are regularly passed to the enemy as: — ( ft ) Sailing and probably route, certainly destination, of all types of vessels. (/&gt;) \\ hereabouts of storage of reserves of such articles as grain, oil, &amp;c. (r) Whereabouts of timber stocks and other inflammables at the ports. (d) Obstruction at ports. (r) Details of quantities of stocks and imports of staples for the munition industry. (/) General reports of commercial activities and morale. Information was received (the 1st September, 1940) from an official source to the effect that '* suspicion was attached to Cargo Superintendents as being part of an organisation having its centre at Geneva, which is thought to be established for the purpose of circumnavigating the Allied blockade.” The same source suggested that Controls Beteiligungsgesellschaft A.G. of Berlin was head of the organisation. On the 7th September, 1940, an independent report stated that there appeared to be an organised distribution of information throughout Europe through the Soci^t^ Generate de Surveillance S.A., Geneva. Further, that the business of this firm had been mainly connected with the grain trade, but that their correspondence referred to all types of produce shipments, and that their agents kept up a stream of correspondence reporting each cargo, not only to their head office, but to their other branches. As this firm has German connections, copies of such statements referring to cargoes would give valuable information to the enemy. Attached is a list of a few of the correspondents who receive such statements or who appear to have some connection with the firm (Annex C). It will be seen from this brief summary of tbe activities of Cargo Superintendents (London), Ltd., and the parent company, the Societe Generale de Surveillance S.A., r4 Geneva, that suspicion must he attached to their activities, this suspicion being due to information from several independent sources. At the same time no positive evidence has been obtained upon which official action could be taken. We should be grateful for any comments you may care to make, and for any relevant information. Perhaps you will bear this world-wide organisation in mind. ANNEX A. General Superintendence Company, Ltd. (Societe generate de Surveillance S. A.) 1 Place des Alpes, Geneva, Switzerland.

C/946, dated the i4th December 1942, in which 1 gave you the Order of Battle of the Imperial Forces now in Bahrain ' 1 recently visited both the British troops and the Levies, ana you may be interested to hear some account of them. 2. First of all 1 saw the heavy anti-aircraft batteries which are in fixed positions covering the Refinery and was much impressed both ?/ith the weapons and their lay out, and some extraordinarily intricate predicting machinery which they have instalied. 1 was shown a predictor which cost £ 60,000 and observed how its calculations were conveyed inetantaneou lI^, to all the ; ;un positions. It works by short wave on the echo sounding principle and functions even in dense cloud and must be rated an astonishing invention# 1 also visited the lign er anti-aircraft guns which are of the normal Refers type that X have seen in the Kiddle East, une section of the heavy battery not only covers the Refinery but also the t;itra r- age , ^_when the guns promised by His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester arrive the position will of course be still further improved. 3# 1 then went on and saw the Company of Sikhs. These are a fine type of men in excellent condition with a good young Commanding officer. Curiously enough they are a Company of the fine battalion that 1 mentioned having seen at fcosul. 'iou are probably aware that they held some manoeuvres recently with their Bren gun carriers which were attended by the Shaikn and which were much appreciated. The men are giving full vent to / their O.K#Caroe Esquire, CSI.,CIF.,ICS., Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, hew Delhi.their pastoral iiktincta and have etarted up a vegetable garden in the middle of the desert with the overflow from their bath water* 4, J then visited the section of the combined general hospital which I found in barastis* these have the advantage of being oool in summer and warm in winter t though a little draughty* and the men in them seemed quite happy, they are not altogether watertight, and if it leaks the patients string out their «rcwnd sheets to make small tents over their beds. Rain is, however, so rare in Bahrain that this is a justifiable risk. 1 did not see aiiy signs of comforts or amenities, and was told that no literature had been received either by the Sikhs or this hospital, though some was believed to be on the way. Actually, the men are not at all off in Bahrain, as they can buy the sort of things that appeal to Indians, at a price* 5. I then went to the Refinery to see the P.A*D. or Passive Air Defence work and was shown round by one of the engineers in charge* The most important tanks, i*e* those containing white oils, have already been sheathed and work is proceeding upon the others* At first bricks from Iraq together with Iraqi masons were used, but now local «farush* or coral rock is used, and Bahrainis have been trained to replace the Iraqis* low walls have been built up between the tanks and also around essential pieces of machinery in the Refinery. The cost lias been astronomi cal* 6. Hext day I went over to Huharraq to ins.ect the aerodrome where great extensions have taken place and where the runways have been extended to as much as 2000 yards* There has been some trouble with soft patches where none were suspected, and a plane Wakefield was in crashed in one of them, fortunately vnthout seriously injuring the passengers* 1 also saw the bombs and other stores which have been scattered so as to minimise risk / in3» in Ouse of air attack* 7* i then visited the Levies which consist of think) two Companies of local men who are more or lest up to strength aiid who have made rapid progress* 1 was told that they had filled out wonderfully with their rations and they certainly seem keen enough* * —'A_ The^ are entirely armed with old Italian rifles which 1 understand ' H ’j •* 11X6 ^hite serviceatle, but they have hitherto only fired five rounds on the ran^e as ammunition is limited* They also have a number of Italian machine guns which are both effective and in good condition* It is very thoughtful of our enemies to have provided us in this manner* The men are all in barastis» but as this is their normal type of housing they should feel at home* 8* I ended by visiting the R,A*F.oamp which is held in readi~ ness for any additional reinforcement squadrons* This is rather a ghost city at present, but is fully wired and equipped and even has some stone-built crew rooms with air-conditioning, a luxury which has not yet reached our offices* 1 was interested to see a home-made type of hangar made out of chandala and matting which looks for all the world like the arch at Ctesipon* It seemed a most ramshackle affair, but has stood up to some very strong winds and is considered successful* There were two planes ^ sheltering underneath it including a Wellington which recently had a crash landing owing to the undercarriage refusing to come down, due to a piece of the cowling jamming the machinery* a plane that Rogers was in recently caused some anxiety in refusing for a time to lower its unuercart* 9* The present arrangements for the defence of Bahrain, which are not *uite complete, fully satisfy local feelings and have caused much gratification both to the Oil Company and the Shaikhs* By the time the threat has entirely’ disappeared our position here ought to be almost impregnable f * 'lours sincerely, sd • C^CrtPrior* P.T.O.W'* Political Agent.

J.A* Betts Snr©t Confidential EXPRESS LETTER From Political Agent, Bahrain. T© Political Resident, Bushire. No. C/630 Dated the 9th May 1943. Abdulla bin Darwish, Agent of the A.I.C.C. at Dohah (Oauar) has reported to me the following facta. (i) A Persian jailing boat (Nakhuda Mashhadi Abdulla Irani) recently arrived at Dohah and discharged there about 650 tins of Aviation Spirit. The t&gt;ins hove the British ✓ Government mark on them ( f ) and also have the number 100 (this presumably means that the Aviation Spirit is 100 octane). The nakhuda declined to give a consistent story in regard to 'uhe source of th* petrol. He has said both that he purchased it, though he did not disclose the name of the seller, and that he found the tins in the sea. The sailing beat came from a port near Daiyir. The nakhuda left the petrol with Abdulla bin Darwish who paid him fc 900 to ©over his expenses, etc. The nakhuda subsequently return ed in his boat to the Persian side of ^he Gulf • Abdulla bin Darwiah reports that another boat is expected shortly at ' Dehah with a further consignment «f 600 tins ©f Aviation petrol. (ii) A Persian called Zayir Asad recently arrived from Daiyir bringing with him spare parts of British military cars (possibly Jeeps). These motor parts have been sold to a merchant in Qatar who proposes to ©end them to JXibal for sale. 2. In regard to the Aviation Spirit, I have asked Abdulla bin Darwish to' let me know as soon as possible the code number stamped on the tin© (this code number gives an indication, I believe, of the area to which the petrol was supplied). I have also asked the Air Liaison Officer, who is /- mss;ia going to Basrah tomorrow, to make enquiries from the R.A.F. I have also seen Barker, the Travelling A.I.O.C. Oil Inspector, who happens to be in Bahrain at the moment and he will institute enquiries from the n.I.O.C. as soon as he knows the code number on the tins. I have asked Abdulla bin Darwish to keep the petrol temporarily at Dohah and to detain the nakhuda who brought it if and when he returns. If a further consignment of Aviation Spirit arrives the man who brings it will also be detained. 3. In regard to the motor car parts, I am arranging fer them to be taken over on arrival at Dubai and Tandy will be able to prepare a detailed list. 4. I will keep you informed of developments and you will no doubt inform the Naval, Military or H.A.F. authorities, if any, who you think would be interested.

Kive rials a tin were paid to get them collected. 2. These* 400 tins v/era later loaded on a second I.d.T. barge, but this barge also became a total loss in the next storm; and the petrol was again lost. The A.P.O.C. agent at Dayyir reports however, that he has collected 300 tins, 40 of which he bought at rials 40 and 250 at rials 32 per tin. 3. I could go into this case further when i am able to tour ')ayyir-Asalu area, and suggest I may pay for and bring back any tins of petrol which are in good condition and seem reasonably full. 4. It seems likely, therefore, that the petrol landed in ^atar may have been part of the same consignment, which was said in Lavar to have been jettisoned by a Kuwaiti boat owing to bad v/eather. Sd.

Politics ^gent, Bahrain.No. 635-S British Residency &amp; Consulate General, Biishire, the 7th Ju3y, 1943. To The Political Agent, BAHRAIN. MEMORANDUM Reference your memorandum No. C/782 dated June 7th; aviation petrol landed at Qatar. 2 . I have just returned from a launch tour which included Dayyir; and saw there a collection of tins of aviation spirit made by the local agent of the A.P.O.C., bearing identical (to all intents and purposes) markings with those given in your memorandum under reference. I consider there is little doubt that the cargo landed in Qatar came across from this side of the Gulf; and in fact was informed of the name of the man who took the petrol across, one Bahmiyar of Bard eh TChan, a noted local smuggler. 3. Contrary to your opinion, I formed the impression that the petrol which I saw might still be of use to the R.A.F., and intend to siiggest that they come and get it, as it has been collected and stored. The tins are rusty; but do not seem to have leaked seriously as yet. This, however, is merely for your information. jl j .

In my capacity as Agent of A.I.O.C. and the R.A.-t* 1 . at Qatar I have to report that a sailing boat arrived at Qatar with about 550 tins of aviation, marked with the British Government, mark ( ^ ) and numbered 100, The name of the Nakhuda is Mashhadi Abdulla Irani. I enquired from him from where he brought it. He has not given me a true reply. Sometimes he says that he bought it and some times he says that he picked the tins from over the high sea. The boat came from a place (I do not remember its name, because I left Qatar hurriedly to Bahrain and I had not chance to bring the written notes about it with me), near Daiyir in Iran. As he was a foreigner, being Iranian subject, I could not do anything with him, but I made a suggestion to him to leave the petrol with me, until he could make arrangement for its shift from Qatar. He accepted my suggestion and I paid him about Rs.900/ to cover his requirements and his expenses.- He has left Qatar to his town near Dayir. Some other man named Zayir Asad came from the same twwn as a passenger in an Irani boat, and he brought with him spare car parts of 'Jornsi?' cars, which it is stated that such cars are only used by the Government for war purposes. He sold them to one in Qatar who is trying to ship to Dubai for sale. I do not know the buyer but I am arranging to leave for Dubai in the same boat in which these parts are shipped, and where I will be in * position to make enquiries. The Political Agent might write to P.O.T.C. at Sharjah to assist me to complete the enquiries about them. It was reported that the British Government have stationed a barge with aviation petrol near Dayir for the R.A.F. Also it is said that another boat will come to Qatar with a consignment 600 tins. As these things belonging to the British Government - aviation petrol and car parts - I ask to let me what can I do with them - whether the P.A. wants me to make complete' investigations about the source of their coming to Qatar - to confiscate the coming petrol, or to arrange and do as I did before. Or would he like me to detain the man in Qatar and inform —I [! mrm Vl*&gt;) JU-jU'] amu 4-H^W-J' A.I.U.e., on arrival at Dubai and ask him to pass the information on to us. (2) He reports that the tins are rusty. Caps, which are painted red, are the only parts which are not rusty. Abdullah bin Darwish said that^as &amp;&amp; Agent of the he had already had correspondence on this subject with the A.I.o.C. at Abadan. The latter had written to him some time ago telling him that the old stock of aviation spirit which he had in the R.A.F. godown at Dohah should be disposed of in Qatar. The ^haijch’s engineer warned him not to do this, as it would ruin the cars • he replied to the A.I.O.C. accordingly, but the A.I.O.C. replied that they had consulted experts, who assured them that It could be (j-u 8 ed in cars. ^ ^ Abdullah bin Darwish suggested that the F.O.T.C. should be asked to keep the information about the spare parts strictly to himself until his (Abdullah Darwish's) arrival, as otherwise the nakhuda may- have previous warning and conceal the goods. The question would not of course arise if Abdulla bin Derwish goes in the same launch, but having been held up here for a few clays, he may have to go by a subsequent launch. Even if he arrives there after th^ spare parts, he is sure that they 4©- not disappear before his arrival. He will be staying at Dubai for about 40 days, and any instructions we have to give himcan be sent through the p.u.T.C. Abdullah bin Darwish was keen that the Shaikh of Qatar should not know that he had reported this matter to us. 0^ fafly. tty Ttc - Ivf 'p fu-kino '' (l h n ' fa A(0CP-jl. ypoo d. I think we snouid write to Bapco asking them to inform Master of ship that this man is under no cir cumstances to be allowed ashore. Members of the crews of tankers never do come ashore -- except the Captain and occasionally the Chief Engineer, and Bapco can ensure that he is kept on his ship. The Aase Maersk is due at Banrain on the 19th of this month. Hammond, the Bapco shipping man stays on tankers until they finally depart and almost certainly knows Maier and could keep an eye on him. If we write to Bapco a copy should go to Gray Mackenzie for information. Sd/- R. I.
