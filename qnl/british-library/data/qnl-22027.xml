HOME PO LITICS , The King 1 a Health . His Majesty 7/as again indisposed towards the end of January and was unable to attend to the affairs of State. It is generally believed in BAGHDAD that the young King is unduly worried about his health and attaches exaggerated importance to minor ailments, and the somewhat frequent occasions upon which he feels himself unequal to deal with the business of his gov ernment is a cause of much dissatisfaction. Political Situation . In continuation of paragraphs 346 and 347 of the Summary of Intelligence for December 1934, although received with apparent cordiality at the opening of Parliament on 28th December, it was obvious that the Speech from the Throne had not struck a happy note and that it was likely to come in for a good deal of ad verse criticism when the two houses adjourned to select their officials for the forthcoming session. In point of fact, the criticism of the King’s speech, especially in the Upper Chamber, was a good deal more hostile than had been anticipated and it was with some difficulty that Ali Jawdat, the Premier, managed to persuade the Senate from passing a vote of 'no confidence' in his Cabinet. The first meeting of the Chamber of Deputies was held on 3rd January under the presidency of Rashid Beg al Khoja. Information had already leaked out that the reactions of the Senate to the King’s speech had not been entirely favourable, and when Yassin Pasha al Hashimi arose and made a lengthy address in which he criticised the haste with which Cabinets are formed in ’IRAQ; declared there was no good cause for the dis solution of the former parliament; stated that the com position of the new house was no better than its pre decessor and concluded by deploring the fact that the Cabinet had not published its programme or plans for the future, his speech was received with considerable applause. Ali Jawdat had, however, been successful in persuading the Senate to adopt a more moderate attitude, and their reply to the Speech from the Throne, w r hich was also read at this first meeting, was accepted by the Chamber of Deputies after slight modification. In its amended form it was a somewhat colourless production and merely reiterated, in rather more formal language, the statement made by Yassin Pasha in his opening ad dress to the Chamber; it concluded with the usual, and not very optimistic, prayers for the future happiness of the King and the nation. The departure of Ali Jawdat for GENEVA on 3rd January (paragraph 12 refers) rendered further discus sions on the policy, or lack of policy, of the present government somewhat futile, and, on the subsequent occasions on which the Chamber of Deputies mot duringPage 2 the month of January, business of a routine nature only was transacted. It was generally understood, however, that the Premier would make some profound statement on his return, hut up to the end of January he had con tented himself with notifying representatives of the various political periodicals published in BAGHDAD that the government was satisfied with itself and satisfied that it had the confidence of the King and the nation. At the meeting of the Chamber of Deputies on 28th Jan uary he repeated this statement and added that the gov ernment intended to proceed forthwith in the carrying out of their programme, but without divulging to his somewhat expectant listeners any detailed particulars as to what this programme included. The Shi’a Situ a tion . In continuation of paragraph 345 of 1954, the discontent of the Shi’a community, especially in the HILDA, DIWANIYAH and MUNTAPIQ Liwas, over the too obvious control exercised by the government during the elections became more pronounced after the fact became generally known that the Senate was’ opposed to the gov ernment and had accorded only a very luke-warm recep tion to the Speech from the Throne. police reports throughout January indicated that there had been a quite unusual amount of political activity on the part of well known tribal leaders; that secret meetings had been held at NAJAF to find out to what extent the Shi’a Divines were prepared to support any anti-government movement; and that the interest now taken by the Middle EUPHRATES shaikhs in the political situation had re sulted in the temporary abandonment of a number of tribal feuds and an unusual degree of tribal solidarity in opposition to the government. Towards the end of the month there were a number of rumours in BAGHDAD, which were also repeated in the police reports, to the effect that tribal ’’hawassing' (community shouting) had taken place in several of the more remote districts and that the gov ernment officials in the DIWANIYAH Liwa had actually been forced to vacate the serai. Although untrue, the publication of these rumours in an official report indicates that the authorities were apprehensive of trouble in the agricultural districts. Abdul Wahid al Ha«ji Sikkar and Sammawi al Ghallub, both prominent shaikhs of the Fatlah groups in the MISIIKHAB and HINDI YAH districts respectively, are the prime leaders in the present political activity in the EUPHRATES area. Their visits to BAGHDAD are frequent and they are in touch with leading members of the opposition in the capital; this, coupled with the fact that they have been granted several sympathetic interviews by His Majesty ex-King Ali, has considerably increased their prestige and, as a direct result, they are now accorded a large measure of support by numerous other shaikhs whose tribes are not normally on terms of friendship with the Fatlah. The refusal of the UlomaPago 3. to sanction anything in tho way of a civil disobedience campaign and the advice of Muhammod Hussain Qashif al Ghata, who has consistently advocated the adoption of a moderate attitude, have so far acted as a check to rising enthusiasm, and by the end of January the Shi’a leaders were beginning to wonder whether they would gain much in the long run by allowing themselves to be exploited, as they had been during the ’’General Strike” of 1931, by the anti-government politicians in BAGHDAD. It is always difficult to discover who is the prime mover in those periodic manifestations of Shi f a discontent, but in this case suspicion falls equally on Rashid Ali Gailani and Hikmat Beg Sulaiman, both of whom are in close touch with Saiyid Muhsin Abu Tabbikh, a wealthy land-owner of the DI WAIT I YAH Liwa, whose position in the Senate gives him considerable authority with the tribal shaikhs; Yassin Pasha al Hashimi is also probably indirectly interested in the present Shi*a agitation. At the end of the month, however, it looked as though the Shi’as would persist in their refusal to lend themselves to political ex ploitation and might endeavour to re-form one of the extinct tribal parties, such as the ’’Hizb al Surra” or ”Hizb al Ashiyra” (both representing the interests of the agricultural and tribal communities although, at ^ the time of their inception, allied to the Nation alist Party or ”Hizb al Ikha”) under the directorship of a leader appointed by themselves. It is possible that tho leadership of a new party formed on these lines might be taken over by Ja’afar Abu Yimman. This man, who comes from a rich and influential family of Baghdadi merchants, was for many years the idol of tho ultra-nationalist group; he organised the”Hisb al Watani” (Nationalist Party) in 1922, but was so active in his anti-mandate crusade that he finally clashed with the interests of the late King Paisal and was arrested and deported to HENJAM. He returned to ’IRAQ in 1923, but for a matter of five years remained a voluntary exile from political matters. He was elected a Member of Parliament for the KUT Liwa in 1928, but consistently refused to accept a minister ial portfolio; he was reported to be one of the prime movers in the 1931 ’’General Strike”, and was known to have republican tendencies and to be definitely op posed to the present form of government. In November 1933 he published an official announcement in the press in which he stated that the administration had become so corrupt that he was no longer able to participate in the political life of the country, and, as earlier in the year he had refused to accept a portfolio in Yassin Pasha’s Cabinet, this gesture was at tho time considered final. The return of Ja’afar Abu Timman has natur ally been v/armly wlecomed by the Shi’as as not only does he belong to this sect but has, amongst the tribal community, a reputation for honesty of purpose and out spoken opinions. His return to political life has been signalled by the publication of a newspaper, ofPage 4. which he is the proprietor, entitled ”Al hahda” (The Principle) the first issue of which appeared in BAGHDAD on 26th January; although still in its infancy the first few issues of this paper indicate that da’afar Abu Timman has emerged from his retirement with in creased zeal and his criticisms of the government, its policy and the integrity of its various officials and representatives is singularly devoid of oriental am biguity. His future activities and the activities of the various ultra-nationalist and tribal groups which will tend to coalesce around him will be watched with interest, and possibly with apprehension, by the present government. Kurdish Unrest . Simultaneous with the revival of Shi’a act ivity in the EUPHRATES district came an additional em barrassment to the ’Iraq, Government in the form of rumours of discontent in KURDISTAN. It was a serious blow to the Kurds when the British mandate was termin ated and they found themselves committed to the rule of an Arab Government with all hope of autonomy appar ently gone; they were to some extent appeased by the promise that their area should be administered by Kurd ish officials and that the official language should be Kurdish, but the government has not found it possible to fulfil its promise in all respects; a number of the officials in KURDISTAN understand no Kurdish, and Arabic is the language used in all official correspondence. The discontent was manifested by anonymous letters sent to a number of leading Kurds who have served in govern ment appointments and by protests by Kurdish students against their school teachers, who have been expressing approval of the Pan-Arab movement, which Is naturally distasteful to the Kurds; somewhat averse to being members of the ’IRAQ nation, they would even more strongly resent being included in any union of Arab states. There is no doubt that it is no coincidence that those manifestations of Kurdish discontent have synchronised with the trohbles amongst the Shi’as; both have almost certainly been fomented by the polit ical opponents of the present government, but KURDISTAN is an area in which it would be an easy matter to stir up serious disorder at any time. For some months the administration in the BARZAN area has been brought to a standstill by the activities of Khalil Khoshawi and his followers, with whom the police have proved incapable of dealing. In the SULAIMANI area several gangs of bandits have boon disporting themselves from timu to time and almost invariably have had the better of it in their brushes with the police. Between the two lies the unadministered PIZHDSR area, and it now looks most unlikely that the government’s desire to extend its administration to that district will be fulfilled in the near future. Throughout KURDISTAN the admin istration hangs by the most slender threads and depends almost entirely on the goodwill of the leading Aghas. Thus symptoms of discontent in the northern districts cannot be disregarded by the government in the same way© Page 5. that the alleged grievances of the Shi'as in the south have hitherto been ignored, and steps will have to he taken to conciliate the Kurds if KURD 13T All is to con tinue to he administered by an Arah Government. POLITICAL - F OREIGN. Visit of the P remier t o GENEVA . Ali Jawdat Beg, the Premier of ‘IRAQ, who left hy air for GENEVA on the morning of 3rd January as head of the ’Iraqi delegation at the League of Nations during the preliminary discussions on the validity of the ’Iraq-Persian frontier, returned to BAGHDAD on the 25th. In an interview with a repre sentative of ”Al Bilad”, a pro-government newspaper published in BAGHDAD, Ali Jawdat stated that he left GENEVA after the ’Iraq-pefcsian frontier dispute had heen^adjourned as a result of the suggestion made hy Hr. Eden that the matter should he referred to the Court of International Justice. He also stated that he considered the progress made towards the settlement of this dispute was satisfactory and that the interest and sympathy evinced hy members of the League con vinced him that they were fully satisfied with the justice of the ’Iraqi point of view. Nuri pasha as Sa’id, Minister for Foreign Affairs, who left BAGHDAD on 26th December, 1934, and travelled via ANKARA to GENEVA, did not return with the Premier, hut proceeded to ROME in response to an invitation from Baron Aloisi, the Rapporteur of the Council, in order that he might he in a position to furnish further detailed information regarding the existing state of affairs of the ’Iraq-Persian frontier. INDUSTRIES &amp; RESOURCES. Opening of the ’IRAQ-MEDITERRANEAN Pipe-lin e. In continuation of paragraphs 359 and 360 of 1934, the ’Iraq Mediterranean pipe-line, constructed hy the ‘Iraq Petroleum Company for the conveyance of crude oil from the company’s wells in ’IRAQ to the storage depots at HAIFA and TRIPOLI was formally opened at KIRKUK on 14th January hy His Majesty King Chazi. The ceremony, full details of which have already ap peared in both the local and English press, was a brilliant social success and the arrangements made for the reception and entertainment of visitors were amazingly efficient.Page 6. Sir John Cadman, the Chairman of the ’Iraq Petroleum Company, in an extremely tactful and happily worded speech thanked the King for the honour he had conferred upon the company by attending the opening of the ceremony and congratulated 'IRAQ not only on pos sessing so valuable an oil field, but also on the dis cretion they had displayed in entrusting its develop ment to an international company of such integrity and experience as the ’Iraq petroleum Company. Sir John concluded his speech with an expression of hope that the subsequent development of the oil resources of ’would prove a source of lasting financial prosperity both for the company and to the people of ’IPAQ. Kis Majesty King Ghazi made a brief but cord ial reply to Sir John Cadman 1 s lengthy speech and stated that one of the most satisfactory factors of the development of ’IRAQ’S oil resources had been the very close co-operation between the company and the govern ment of ’IRAQ. In conclusion. His Majesty, in ac cepting the commemorative gold and silver casket pre sented to him by the company, expressed the hope that the construction of the pipe-line might bring poace and prosperity to all concerned; that it v/ould unite the people in a spirit of brotherhood and sincerity and be a real agent in the creation of peace amongst the nations of the world. An excellent luncheon had en sured an enthusiastic reception for His Majesty’s apt and optimistic speech and the guests shortly afterwards dispersed in aircraft, trains and motor cars, all either oil or petrol driven, feeling that in this some what insecure world you can at least be sure of '”B. P. ”. Local press reactions to the opening of the pipe-line mirrored a somewhat different point of view; most of the local papers regretted that ’IRAQ had found it necessary to delegate the exploitation of her miner al wealth to a foreign company and expressed a hope that a careful eye would bo kept on percentage royalties now that oil was actually in transit to HAIFA. The ”Ikha al Watani”, a nationalist organ normally reflect ing the opinions of Yassin Pasha al Hashimi, developed the same theme on even stronger lines and made reference in a series of quite brilliant articles to the ’’Empire of John Cadman”. In these articles, the poverty and insecurity of life in ’IRAQ was vividly contrasted with the opulence, peace and prosperity which prevailed in the various zones taken over by the I.P.C.; even the somewhat desolate pumping stations in the desert being visualised by the writer as veritable fairylands of corrugated iron and barbed wire. The government, who had had their eye on the n Ikha al Watani” for some time, took exception to these articles as being an unpleasing criticism of government policy and the ”ikha al Watani'’ has been banished from the BAGHDAD bookstalls for a period of ten days.Pagy 7. AO PORCEH , Royal f Iraqi Air Fo rce . Seven Hawker Pegasus aircraft arrived at HINAIDI during the month, having teen despatched from ENGLAND to this country by sea. They are now being erected and it is expected that all will be ready for flying during February. This brings the total number of Hawker Pegasus aircraft of the Royal 'Iraqi Air Force up to twelve and brings the Hawker squadron up to establishment. INTERNAL SECURITY. BAR2AN. In continuation of paragraph 363 of the Sum mary of Intelligence for December»1934, Khalil Khoshawi continues his activities in the north and his following is now authoritatively stated to be about 100. Minor raids have been carried out against villages by small groups of followers und^r his subordinate leaders, but at the end of December the village of KHALAN (l.D/NW. 18.c.) was attacked and four inhabitants killed and some of the houses burnt. Following on this a group of 40 Khoshawi rebels entered the village of ISHKAFT (l.D/NW. 18.c.) and aft^r looting the village, assem bled together some P. W. D. labourers who wore encamped there, killing four of them and wounding one. Two of these rebels were captured later by a police patrol in the vicinity of PIRAN (l.D/NW. 11.a.) and escorted in to ROWANDUZ. Another police patrol was fired upon on the KAI'II LINJ road and one policeman was wounded. Khalil Khoshawi is still reported to be making BEROKH village in TURKEY his headquarters whilst his followers are located in the Turkish Girdi villages of SERUKANI (1.C/SW. 34.c.) and NIHAWA (1.D/NW. 4.d.). The Director General of Police and the Com mandant of Police, MOSUL Liwa, visited ERBIL at the beginning of the month, to discuss future action to be taken regarding the apprehension of Khoshawi. It was realised that the present police force establishment in the area was insufficient to deal with the situation and it has been decided to enlist 200 mounted irregular tribesmen to work in conjunction with the regular police, and to raise those irregulars as far as possi ble from the Shirwan tribe. It is understood that em ployment of a small military force is also under dis cussion, but it is unlikely that any measures of a serious nature will be taken against Khoshawi until the spring, when conditions for operations will be more suitable.Page 8. SULAIPANI Liwa . 21. The SUI.AI2UNI Liwa has hoon fairly peaceful during the past month. paiyid Ata and his followers, who on 21st ;ecember looted a car ivan and captured 18 loaded donkeys near SPIDARA (2.K/L3. 22.b.) were, during the past month, reported to have taken refuge on the mountain above LALADAR (2,1/NW. 21.a.), close to the frontier, and, when the weather permitted, to be raiding into PERSIA. Serhang Hussain Khan, the commander in MERIVAN, has alleged that the PENJWIN authorities are in partnership with Saiyid Ata and that consequently anyone who wishes may carry out raids into ’IRAQ. In view of the nature of the country and the recent inclement weather, it is most unlikely that the PENJWIN authorities know that Saiyid Ata is at LALADAR. 22. Hama Ali Rustam was reported to be on his way north to join Shaikh Muhammed Pichkola via QIZLAR (2.E/NW. 16.d.) and SURDASH (2.E/NW. 8.c.) and the police moved out on the night 19th/20th January, but failed to inter cept him and he was reported to have passed through QAMISH (2.E/OT. 11. c.) about 8 miles further east. There is little doubt that the bandits have very good information about police movements. 23. Khoika Majid is said to have moved north to the BARZAN area to join Khalil Khoshawi, but this rumour has not boon confirmed. 24. As reported in paragraph 115 of the Summary of Intelligence for May 1934, six of the Barzinja Shaikhs left ’IRAQ last April and crossed into PERSIA, where they were well received by the authorities and have settled in MERIVAN. On 16th January an armed party of 22 men came from MERIVAN to BARZINJA and took away the goods of Shaikh Risa and at the same time stole 26 head of cattle.) TUR-1. TUR-2. SECTION II ^ TU RKEY, II'ITERNAL SECURITY, Easter n ANATO LIA. It is reported that as a result of the recent disarmament operations the band cf brigands who were at large in the SLOOPI area have either been captured, have surrendered, or have fled to the neighbouring countries of f IRAQ and SYRIA. Two of the leaders with a few followers who crossed into 'IRAQ were disarmed by tribesmen and relieved of their property; one has since returned to TURKEY and surrendered to the author ities, and the other has fled into SYRIA. Since the disarmament of the tribes on the Turho-Syrian frontier, the Turkish authorities have been demanding payment of arrears of taxation which in many cases have not been paid for the past ten years. The revenue authorities are now collecting these taxes though in some cases they are permitting the tribesmen to pay the sums due by instalments. The Turkish authorities are reported to have successfully disarmed the Kurdish tribesmen in the more accessible districts of the VAN area, but in contrast to this, those tribes in the vicinity of the Turko- 'Iraqi frontier who were disarmed in 1933 are reported to be re-arming secretly by purchasing arms from tribes in 'IRAQ and SYRIA.SECTION III PERSIA. PER-l. PER-2. PER-3. PER-4. MILITARY I^ORCES. Milit ary Trai nirp;. Five Military Schools of the secondary stand ard have recently 'been opened in TABPwIZ, MESHED, ISPAHAN, SHIRAZ and KERMANSHAH. Instructions from the Ministry of Education have been issued to all schools in PERSIA that the senior boys are to be trained in drill in order to participate in the parade to be held on the anniver sary of the Coup d*Etat. The students of TEHRAN are compulsorily paraded once a week for drill by Persian officers and it is thought that a form of Officers Training Corps will eventually be evolved. AIR FORCES. Eight Hawker Furies and ten De Havilland Tiger Moths have recently arrived at AHWAZ and are being erected to be flown to TEHRAN. Four of the .Hawkers were completed by the middle of the month and Persian pilots arrived to ferry them to TEHRAN. It is reported that after leaving AHWAZ they were held up en route owing to the condition of the landing ground at TEHRAN and that one machine was crashed, the pilot being killed. An instructor of the Belgian Mission recently visited AHWAZ with instructions to select a new Military aerodrome in the immediate vicinity of the railway and it is understood that a suitable area was found near the KARUN Railv/ay Bridge. In the meantime, the railway authorities are laying down a track to the existing aerodrome which will also serve the military barracks. INTERNAL SECURITY. KHORASJAN . There has recently been much unrest in the vicinity of the Persian-Baluchistan frontier, where Baluchi sardars on the Persian side of the border are committing acts of banditry and resisting the Persian efforts at maintaining security. The TEHRAN author ities attribute this unrest to British intrigues and reproach the British for not discouraging the sardars activities. Road guards have been reinforced and troops have been concentrated at KWASH. The military authorities in ZAHIRAN have been commandeering Indian lorry drivers to supply the troops in KWASH with rations and stores. Owing to the inadequate escortsprovided for these convoys, they are constantly 'being attacked and it is reported that already, two Indian drivers have been killed and four wounded, the latter being left for four days before any effort was made to collect them. Some of these lorries which have been requisitioned are based on INDIA and operate in Persian territory only as far as 2AIIIDAN, and are nor mally forbidden to work in the interior.PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY &amp; COIH' TUNIC AT IONS SAU-3. SAU-4. Survey of Pilgrim Route. In continuation of paragraphs 3AU-38 and SAU-39 of 1934, the ’Iraqi and Sa’udi commissions en gaged on the survey of the projected route between ’IRAQ and RHJD arrived in BAGHllAD on 31st December, 1934. The commission reports that the total length of the route between NAJAF and MEDINA is about 650 miles and that, once the necessary improvements have been completed in the sand belt area, it will be possible to cover the distance in three or four days by car. The final deliberations of the joint com mittee have not yet been disclosed to the press, but it has been generally agreed that pilgrims will travel from ’IRAQ to MEDINA in transport operated by ’Iraqi concerns, and that between MEDINA and MECCA respon sibility for the conveyance of pilgrims will be under taken by the Sa’udi government or private companies operating under their control. The members of the Sa’udi commission left BAGHDAD on 13th January on their return journey to NEJD, and it is understood that, during the prelimin ary work on ill-defined and difficult sections of the track, cars will be based in the ARDH-AL-MADHUA, the extensive and treacherous sand belt which lies to the north-east of HAIL on the DARB 30BAIDA, in order to render assistence to any privately owned vehicles which may attempt the route before it is formally declared open for the use of civil transport. Both governments have agreed to make every endeavour to render the route fit for the passage of motor vehicles in time for the forthcoming Haj.SECTION VII OTHER ARAB STATES. OaS”1• OIL. NASA . It is reported that the representatives of the Standard Oil Company of California who visited JEDDA last October tried to get their concession to prospect for oil in HASA extended to cover the KUWAIT Neutral Zone, but that Ibn Sa f ud decided that , as the Shaikh of KUWAIT was in negotiation with the Kuwait Oil Company, he would not be allowed by the British to agree to an American company being given a concession for the Neutral Zone, and it was, therefore, useless to continue the negotiations. The geologists, who, in paragraph OAS-32 of the December Summary, were reported to be in the Wadi AL BATIN, were last heard of near ANSAB on the f Iraq frontier. (Signod) J.L. VAGHHLL.

FOI ITICS, of E.x-Fln^ All. 20* His Majesty ex-King Ali, eldest of the four sons of King Hussain of the HEJAZ and brother of the late King Faisal, died in BAGHDAD on the evening of 13th February. Although His Majesty had been in an enfeebled state of health for a considerable period his death came as a shock to the community and, espec ially in the provincial districts, there was a feeling of genuine grief. The funeral, which took place on 14th February, was attended by King Ghazi, H. II. the Amir Abdullah of T PANS JORDAN, the Amir Abdul’ilah, the late King’s son, and other members of the royal family; the government, services, and members of the diplomatic corps were also fully represented. 26. Ex-King Ali was only 56 years of age, he ruled in the KEJAZ for a very short period after the abdication of his father, King Hussain, in October 1924, but was himself forced to abdicate by the Wahabis and took refuge in the court of his brother, the late King Faisal, in BAGHDAD, in which city, save for periods of relaxation and recuperation in EUROPE, he lived until the time of his death. 27. A gentle and somewhat negative personality, more interested in chess problems than in politics, King Ali nevertheless hold considerable prestige and influence amongst the tribes. King Ali habitually wore Arab dress and lived an austere and pious life, and it was for this reason that many of the more res ponsible members of the tribal community preferred to seek his advice in private rather than refer their difficulties direct to an unsympathetic administration. His death which deprives the young king of an adviser whose knowledge of tribal affairs and etiquette was in valuable and whose advice, when sought, was given with out ulterior motive, also removes from the palace cir cles a valuable intermediary between leading tribal representatives and the king. Polit ical Sit uat ion - R esign ation of Ali Jaw dat *s Cabinet. 28. In continuation of paragraph 4 of the Summary of Intelligence for January, it soon became clear that the Prime Minister’s confidence that his Cabinet would be able to carry on in spite of the opposition which had been expressed in both Houses of parliament before his departure for GENEVA was unjustified. Although the Chamber of Deputies had been packed with Ali Jawdat’s supporters as a result of the recent election, his con duct of the election had created for him a body of political opponents, who were determined that some re arrangement of the machinery of government should be made, and owing to their efforts, opposition to the government was expressed from a number of different quarters. There was a good deal of agitation from the Shi’a community in the Kiddle EUPHRATES area, mainly aroused by Abdul Vahid al Hajji Sikkar, a shaikh o f C.xOPage S. Fatlah who has much influence amongst the tribesmen and who was a ready tool since he had been deputy . for DIY'ANIYAII and had lost his seat in the recent elections. There were also petitions from KURDISTAN that the gov ernment had failed to carry out undertakings to the Kurds. The lawyers of BAGHDAD were almost unanimous in their opposition to the government and much indigna tion was aroused by the government’s attempt to prohibit one of their meetings. A number of members of the Sen ate adopted an attitude of non-co-operation; bills sent up from the Chamber of Deputies were held up owing to the absence of a sufficient number of senators to enable them to become lav/. Moreover, rifts had been appearing for some time in the Cabinet itself, as they invariably seem to do in ’Iraqi Cabinets after they have been in office for a few months. Arshad al Umari had earned much unpopularity by the wholesale dismissals and re organisation which had taken place in his Ministry of Economics and Communications since he assumed office and he was also accused of somewhat unseemly behaviour in his private life. Even Ali Jawdat was at last convinced that something must be done to remove the hostility to his government, which showed no signs of abating, but he seems to have thought that matters might be smoothed over by the removal from office of Arshad and perhaps one or two other ministers with little political influ ence and by granting of portfolios to some of those vh o were now opposing him, but were not really in sympathy with the Opposition. By common consent however, it was decided that nothing should be done until the return of Nuri Pasha as Sa’id, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who on leaving GENEVA had gone to ROME to present ’IRAQ’S case in the frontier dispute with PERSIA to Baron Aloisi, who had been appointed Rapporteur to the League of Nations. The telegram instructing Nuri to return forth with found him indisposed but after a few days delay he reached BAGHDAD by air on 12th February. Further delay in dealing with the political situation was caused by the death of exKing Ali, dealt with in paragraph 25, and by the fact that the River TIGRIS overflowed its banks as described in paragraph 50, and occupied the attention of the Council of Ministers for several days. On 23rd February however, Ali Jawdat tendered his resig nation to the king in the following terms - ’’Your Majesty - I have felt lately that ministerial solidarity does not exist to the extent it should in a cabinet which realises its responsibilities and seeks to fulfil the expectations of the country. ^his situation ir.akes it difficult to carryout the affairs of the State in a manner consistent with your wishes, notwithstanding the confidence reposed in the Cabinet by the majority of the Mejlis. I therefore feel it incumbent on me to tender my resignation to your Majesty, and beg that you v/ill accept it. - I still remain, Your Majesty’s obedient servant - Ali Jawdat Beg”. The resignation was accepted and for the next few days there was a succession of confident rumours about the composition of the new ministry. Each in turn proved incorrect and the King was advised that no mere reshuffling of the Cabinet would suffice to appease Ali Jawdat’s opponents, and on 26th February it was announced that Yassin Pasha al Hashimi had been invited to become Prime Minister. Apparently the idea was that YassinPage 5. would make the moot, suitable head of a coalition govern ment but that it was undesirable to include in the new Cabinet those who had been mainly responsible for stir ring up opposition to the last. Although net himself directly implicated there is no doubt that Yassin’s ad herents had been responsible for the opposition to Ali Jawdat and his position as head of a government when the Chamber of Deputies consisted almost entirely of persons who owud their position to Ali Jawdat -would have been very difficult. Yassin therefore felt obliged to decline the invitation to become Prime Minister un less an immediate dissolution of parliament was sanctioned. It was clearly inadvisable that all business cf state should be held up whilst the country was put to the ex pense of another farcical election, and in consequence it was announced at the end of the month that Jamil Beg al Madfa’i, the Minister of Defence in the late govern ment, had been invited to form a ministry. 31. Thus history repeats itself, for when in February]-ast year the Cabinet resigned on account of internal dissension, the same minister was invited to form a Cabinet, which was commonly regarded as only a stop-gap to pass the budget and to carry on the affairs of state until the end of the parliamentary session. It is generally considered that, however the new cabinet is constituted, it cannot be expected to last long and that there will probably be another election during the present year, bat it is difficult to see how any material improvement can be effected. 32. f IRAQ is not a country in which events move fast or far; hustled out of her normal stride by her rapid entry into the League of Nations she has nev-^r had time to adapt herself to the constitutional government bequeathed her as a relic of British occupation. The self-styled intelligentzia are at last beginning to real ise that something is seriously wrong with the political machine and to perceive the fact that the trouble is deep-seated and requires more drastic treatment than periodical changes in the name $ of the engine driver; this point of view, which is generally held amongst the educated classes, is well expressed in the following extract quoted direct from an i sue of ”A1 Mabda”, a new nationalist press organ, published a few days after the resignation of Ali Jawdat’s Cabinet. ”If ’ IPA-Q* s status was to be carefully examined it would be found that during the past fourteen years since the establishment of local government 19 cabinets have been formed, 57 ministers have come into office from 11 different political parties, and parliament was dissolved four successive times, but the people have never discovered any difference between the three eras of occupation, mandate, and so-called complete independence, except degeneration all along the line, especially from the moral point of view. During these fourteen years one hears nothing more than the slogan ’’Danger surrounds the country”, palaces are built, private riches are hoarded, state money is squandered, days and nights are spent in amusements and debauchery and immorality, but still the herald shouts that 'Danger surrounds the country””.Page 4. The Shi’ a Si tuat ion. In continuation of paragraphs 5 to 10 of the January Summary; although the political situation in the Southern Provinces has shown no signs of improve ment during the past month it has not further deterior ated. Police reports from provincial districts state that 'hawassing” has again taken place at PUMAJTHA and at various small villages in the MISHKAB area, where Ahdul Wahid is the predominant influence, tut there has as yet teen no act of open hostility towards the gov ernment. As has so often toon the case in the past, the tribal community as a whole has shown itself in capable of any sustained interest in political matters while the government appear to have made some attempt to exploit this characteristic by sending down a lands settlement officer to DIWANIYAH and by deflecting tribal interest to outstanding land cases which had hitherto formed an almost hereditary topic of conversation. The appeals of the tribal leaders to the Ulema for prac tical advice and guidance in a difficult political sit uation elicited a not particularly helpful 'Petwa”, or manifesto, from Muhammed Hussain Khashif al Ghata to the effect that inter-tribal fighting was sin against the Prophet and would result in eternal damnation. In the interim period, whilst politicians in BAGHDAD dilly-dallied with proposals regarding the formation of a new cabinet, the tribal cohesion which had been quite an unusual and marked feature of the situation during January began to disintegrate. Thus the anti-government activities of Saiyid Muhsin Abu Tabbikh, a member of the Senate and prominent landowner in the MISHKAB area, were offset by his brother, da’afar Abu Tabbikh, who started a pro-government movement and subsidised parties to 'hawass' in favour of the king and the existing cabinet; in the same district Saiyid Nur, who though of non-tribal origin is a man of wealth and the owner of considerable pump irrigated property, exerted his influence with the Ghazalat and Humaidat tribal leaders, whose property adjoins his own, and persuaded them to make declarations of loyalty to the government. The fact that the majority of the tribal population are either out in the desert with their flocks or busily engaged in agricultural pursuits has consider ably lessened the danger of a sudden flare-up in the Middle and Lower EUPHRATES districts. In the Fatlah group the death of Abadi al Hussain, a rich tribal land- owner and a deputy for DIWANIYAH in 1933, has diverted a good deal of interest from BAGHDAD politics to matters of a more parochial nature; Abadi Hussain was charact erised by his philoprogenitive qualities and the division of his property at MUHANHAWTYAH in the SHAMIYAH district will probably occupy the attention of the local Fatlah shaikhs for some time to come. Ja’afar Abu Tinman, whose return to political life was mentioned in paragraph 10 of last month’s summary, has apparently been somewhat shaken by the vitriolic productions of his own editorial staff. His paper !, A1 Mabda” was warned by the press bureau fc**© L Pago 5« publishing false information on 12th February and publication was suspended by its proprietor for a few days; its tone was more conventional on its re-appear ance and leaders v/ore written on the usual anti-3ritish and vaguely communistic lines. Since his re-entry into the political arena da’afar Mu fimman has ten'ed to associate himself with the party of which Yassin pasha is the accredited leader; contrary to expectations he has not elected to appear in the provincial districts as the inspired leader of the Shi 1 a coiiLiunity. H1LITAPY FORCES . Irregular P olice . 37. The Government policy of enrolling tribesmen as irregular police to strengthen the police engaged on frontier security was criticised in paragraph 179 of the Summary of Intelligence for June 1934, on the ground that it gives the tribesmen and their leaders, who are by nature lawless and little supervised, the power of acting on their own initiative with the authority of the government behind them. As the various tribes, and even families in a single tribe, are often at feud the disadvantages of the policy can be appreciated. Although the government maintains that the scheme is a satisfactory one, as the tribesmen are always employed in conjunction with regular police and not independently, the criticism was speedily justified by the fact that irregular police enrolled in the KANI RASH area (1. C/SVh 36.c.) and employed a few miles away in the MERGASOR area (1. D/NW. 16.b.) had to bo returned to their own area owing to the unrest they were causing among the tribal elements (paragraph 366 of the Summary of Intelligence for December 1934). 38. Thirty tribesmen from the HERKI BENAJI villages of ARGOSH and BANAN (1. C/SW. 27. a. and 26. d. ) have been employed as irregular police to visit the villages in their own tribal area from time to time to ensure that the inhabitants are not giving refuge to Khalil Khoshawi’s rebels. 39. The government also proposed to enrol Muhammad Agha of MERGASOR (1. D/OT. 16.b. ) and his followers to protect the BIAU area (between MERGASOR and the ZAB river) from the depredations of Khalil Khoshawl. The proposal had, however, to bo dropped owing to the objection to Muhammed Agha on the part of tribal leaders employed as irregular police who had be^n removed from that area as described in paragraph 37 above. 40. In addition to the objection to employing tribesmen as irregular police on the grounds that power is handed back to the Aghas in this way, there is the danger that an engagement with bandits which involves the death of a tribesman may result in a blood feud.Pago 6. INTE R NAL SECURITY . 3UI.AINANI Liv/a . 41. The shooting of one Ahmed Beg-i-Osman Pasha on the Persian border near MORDIN (2, I/SW. 31. d.) by an irregular policeman of MORDIN on 29th January, vail probably give rise to a flood feud among the Jaf tribe/ raiding across the Persian frontier. 42. Ahmed,Beg, who belonged to the Begzadeh family of HALABJA (2,E/8E. 24.d,), which formerly held the supreme leadership of the Jaf tribes, was Qaim- maqqam of the HALABJA Qadha in 1923 4 Proving useless in this post, he was made a Deputy in the Mejlis in BAGHDAD in 1925, but resigned in 1926 and returned to live in HALABJA. He became a member of the Khoyboun Society (Kurdish Nationalist), and was suspected of being responsible for subsequent disturbances in the HALABJA Qadha. He was a heavy gambler, and lost most of his inheritance in this way. In September 1934 he was sentenced to three years imprisonment for forgery but ran away to PERSIA* and has carried out banditry on the f IRAQ border (paragraph 370 of the Summary of Intelligence for December 1934). 43. On the evening of 28th January he secretly visited his house in HALABJA and was going away under cover of darkness on the morning of the 29th when he was shot. He died next day and was buried near HALABJA. Before dying he sent a note to the Jaf Begzadehs asking them to avenge his death against the inhabitants of MORDIN. 44. • Between 6th and 8th February a force of Imami tribesmen (a section of the Jaf) crossed the Persian frontier into ’IRAQ and fought with the police in an endeavour, it is said, to avenge the death of Ahmed Beg, One of the Imami was slightly wounded and submitted to the police, A report of doubtful authenticity states that the Imami were accompanied by Persian troops. 45. The government’s prestige in future dealings with bandits will obviously be prejudiced if the tribesman who killed Ahmed Beg is himself killed. MOSUL Llwa . 46. After the disturbances of August 1933 tempor ary police posts, with a total garrison of 250 irregular police, were established in certain Assyrian villages of the DOHUK and SHAIKHAN Qadhas for the protection of the Assyrians who wore being resettled there. In Jan uary 1934 the government started to re-arm the Assyrians, though (as previously described in paragraphs 41 and 42 of the Summary of Intelligence for February 1934) only on a most inadequate scale, and to discharge the irreg ular police. A limited number of the latter were absorbed into the regular police and up to the present temporary police posts have been maintained in a nuLLer of villages.Pag&lt;j 7. It is now reported, however, that all the temporary posts (except one in each Qadha) have just been withdrawn, and their police garrisons (totalling 20 persons in all) have been sent to HAUSTAN village (!• D/NV. 2.c.) to help against the Khoshawi rebels in the BAROSH area. Under normal conditions, this final removal of the temporary police posts by the government would be a logical sequence of the reduction of their garrisons and of the comparative absence of trouble in this area tor nearly a year. Conditions are, however, not normal. The nervousness of the Assyrians settled in this area has not decreased in the slightest; the policy of the Mar Shimum party has been to ke^p them in a state of un rest and the thefts and raids suffered without redress Toy the comparatively well-arm^d Assyrians in the AMADIA Qadha, and the lav/lessness (of which Kurds as well as Assyrians have been the victims) in the ZIBAR Qadha,.have been exaggerated for this purpose. The Assyrians have very few arms and are living amidst well armed Kurds who would not be sorry to see them scared out of their vill- agcs, and the withdrawal of the police posts may prove an incentive to petty theft and lawlessness with that object in view. The government are intending to take punitive measures in the Spring against the Khoshawi rebels in the BAROSH area, and the withdrawal of these temporary police posts is undoubtedly due to the difficulties caused by Khalil Khoshawi and the need for more police to deal with him. The number of police (twenty) made available by the withdrawal of these posts is, however, so negligible compared to the risk involved in their withdrawal, that it appears that the-officials either do not appreciate the insecurity still felt by the Assy rians or consider that the restoration of ord&lt;-r in the ZIBAR Qadha will have a sufficient reaction on the other areas. PHYSICAL GSOGRAPHY &amp; COMMUNICATIONS. TIGRIS Fl oods. Owing^to heavy rain in the hills, combined with early melting of the snow due to high air temper ature for the time of the year, on 15th February the TIGRIS was found to be rising on a serious scale at FAISH KHABUR and, by the morning of 17th February the river at MOSUL had reached the highest flood level on record since 1914. Large tracts of cultivated land between FAISH KHABUR and MOSUL were inundated and all along the TIGRIS large quantities of livestock and grain were lost, some villages damaged and a few persons drowned. All traffic on the roads south and south-east of MOSUL was suspended for three days. The Khazir and the Greater and Lesser ZAB rivers also overflowed. The greater ZAB reached the highest flood level on record and put the ferries at GU1VAIR (137. P/SE. 31. a. ) and AL MAKHLAT (137. P/Sffi. 35.c.) temporarily out of action. The engineer inPago 3. charge of 'bridge construction in the ESXI KELLJSK arua (137.’ P/3K. 14. d.) lost all his plant and the con struction work on the bridges on the proposed new MOSUL - ARBIL - KIRKUK road will now be seriously retarded. By 19th February the flood water had reached BAGHDAD and five small breaches had occurred in the river bcank at CHAT,DARI (about 8 miles north of BAGHDAD). These, however, were not very serious, and on SOth Feb ruary the water receded before much damage was doir*. During the 24 hours when the flood was reaching its height, the strengthening of the river banks in the vicinity of BAGHDAD was undertaken with great haste, large gangs of labourers, soldiers, and volunteers being pressed into service. It was perhaps unfortunate that the disin tegration of a portion of the bund north of BAGHDAD should have resulted in the inundation of. the lands of Hikmat Sulaiman and Rashid Ali; both immediately as cribed the catastrophe not to the Will of Allah or the Hand of Providence but to the Machiavelian cunning of Arshad al Umari who, in his late capacity of Minister of Economics and Communications, had failed to guard the outposts of the city against the flood waters of the TIGRIS. Vehicular traffic over the Maude Bridge was suspended for two days, thus drawing public attention to the fact that yet another item of the Capital Works Plan had failed to materialise, while the approaches to the old Kotah Bridge were entirely submerged and the bridge rendered inoperative. By 22nd February the river had subsided to almost normal winter level, and local interest reverted to politics. Opening of NAJAF -M EDIUA Pilgrim Ro ute. In continuation of paragraph 372 of the Sum mary of Intelligence for December 1934. The first con tract for the conveyance of pilgrims on the new direct motor route between NAJAF and MEDINA has been granted to Abbud ash Shallash, who has undertaken to transport passengers at the following rates - first class ID. 15/- 8nd class ID. 12/-, 3rd class ID. 10/-. The ’IRAQ Gov ernment has undertaken the organisation of patrols and escort of convoys as far as the *IRAQ-NEJD frontier, and, pending the construction of a permanent control at JUMAIMA, has erected a temporary post at AL AIDA. It is anticipated that the first party of pilgrims will leave NAJAF during the first week in March; it will include a number of teachers, students and boy scouts and Ibrahim Beg al Mu’ammar, the Sa’udi Minister in BAGHDAD, has issued an official announcement that the Sa’udi Government is anxious to extend a cordial welcome to the youth of ’IRAQ and is prepared to waive customs, pass port and other formalities in order that their journey may be accomplished with the minimum of dis comfort and delay. The first convoy will probably con sist of some 200 persons, but at least 3,000 additional names have already been registered as passengers for future convoys.S5CTI0N II PERSIA. MIL ITAR Y FORGES.

In spite of this debacle, a number of aircraft i n x th0 review at TEHRAN, but their display is reported not to have been very impressive. This t0 be expected, since the previous day General Nakhichvan, commanding the Air Force, said that no pro gramme had been arranged, but he thought that they might do some aerobatics in formation; as it had never been practised he was a little doubtful whether it v/ould be a success. Thr^o formations, each of throe aircraft, flew about overhead rather aimlessly and a little later another form-yu:'-n of five monoplanes, presumably the A.b. ob t a mu a met year from RU3CIA, appeared.p] PI PI PI =© ! PER-10. About the middle of February reports appeared in the BAGHDAD press that there had recently been four crashes in the Persian ;iir Force, and, although an official denial was issued by the Persian Legation, news from TEHRAN confirms the report, but does not give the type of aircraft involved. In v no .crash of a two seator both occupants are said to have been killod; upon another occasion there was a collision in the air and though both pilots got down safely, both aircraft crashed; the fourth crash occurred the day before the Review, when General Nakhichevan turned his aircraft on its nose when attempting to land on the parade ground. PER-11. The estimated strength of aircraft in the Persian Air Force, as on 1st March, is as follows:- A. At TEHRAN. B. H. Tiger Moths. Gypsy III. 120 h.p. 17 D. H. Tiger Moths.

Of the Hawker Audax mentioned under 'B” and ”0', 26 are fitted with British Pegasus 570/625 h.p., and 12 with Pratt and Whitney Hornet 575 h.p. PER-12. In paragraph PER-117 of the Summary of Intelligence for September 1934, it was stated that the A.P.0.0. had managed to produce a fuel suitable for the Audax aircraft, but it is now stated that although the Bristol engines, both Mercury and Pegasus, use A.P. 0. C. fuel A.130, which has a specific gravity of 735 with octane number 74. 5, each gallon having 3 0.0. of tetra-ethyl lead added, imported fuel is us^d for the Pratt and Whitney engines and has an octane number of 86. PER-13. The situation of the Persian Air Force has now become quite ludicrous; the number of aircraft is considerably in excess of the number of mechanics and the latter are still without any tools. Colonel Bever, head of the Belgian mission, is believed to be in dis favour with the Persian authorities and does not appear to be likely to improve the situation.POPULATION &amp; TRIBES PER-14. The Assyrians domiciled in PPP-SIA are stated to bo following the Assyrian question in * IRAQ with great interest. It is alleged that, m tho event of the materialisation of the BRITISH GUIANA Scheme and the subsequent settlement proving a success, a great number of Assyrians from all parts of PERSIA, either with private means or helped by their relatives in EUROPE and the U. S. A. , would emigrate to BRITISH GUIANA* ^ Many of the Assyrians in URUKIA? however, being without private means, v/ould be unable to go. PER-15. _ It is difficult to estimate the number of Assyrians in PERSIA,, but a well informed source puts their numbers at about 12,000 persons.SECRET . ROYAL AIR PORCH. MONTHLY INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY.

Humphrys, G.C.V.O., K.C.M.O. , K. B. E. , C. I.S, , v/ho was first appointed ca High Com missioner for 'IRAQ cn 7th October, 1920, after the death of the late Sir Gilbert Clayton, K. C.M. G. , K.B, E. , C. B. , left BAGHDAD by Service aircraft on the morning of 16th March on the termination of his appointment as British Ambassador. It was on the advice of Sir Francis Humphrys that His Majesty’s Brittanic Government recommended ’IRAQ for membership of the League of Nations. With the admission of ’IRAQ to League membership in October 1932 the Treaty of Alliance with 'IRAQ? which Sir Francis had signed in 1930, came into force; the Mandate therefore ended and Sir Francis Humphrys was appointed His Brittanic Majesty’s first Ambassador at the Court of the late King Faisal. A large gathering of 'Iraqi and British mem bers of the community assembled at the Baghdad Air Port to bid Sir Francis and his family farewell, and the afternoon issues of the local press eulogised the departing Ambassador, making special mention of the part he had played in freeing ’IRAQ from the shackles of the Mandate. Arrival of Sir Archibald J.K. Clark-Kerr. Sir Archibald J.K. Clark-Kerr, K.C.M.G. , the new British Ambassador in ’IRAQ, arrived in BAGHDAD by the overland route on 18th March; he was welcomed 'by Sir Tahsin Beg Qadri, representing His Majesty King Ghazi, and members of the Embassy and Consular staffs. Sir Archibald Clark-Kerr presented his credentials to H.M. King Ghazi on 23rd March and also paid formal visits to the Prime Minister (Yassin Pasha al Hashimi), the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Minister of Interior. Death of the Queen-Mother . It was officially announced on 27th March that Queen Huzaimah, the mother of H.M. King Ghazi and wife of the late King Faisal, had died suddenly of heart failure at her residence in BAGHDAD. The funeral which, in accordance with Eastern standards was of an unostentatious nature, took place on the same afternoon; cinemas and local places of entertainment v/ere clsscd for three days as a sign of respect and a number of social functions have also been cancelled. A great deal of public sympathy has been expressed for H.M. King Ghazi who has, since the death of the late King Faisal in September 1933, experienced the loss of both his uncle and mother.Page 2 The Cabinet . In continuation of paragraph 30 of the February Summary of Intelligence, Jamil Peg al Kaufa'i, Minister of Defence in the late government, ultimately succeeded in forming a new Cabinet, and the ceremony of installation took place on 4th March, The com position of the new Cobinet was as follows:- Prime Minister - Jamil Beg al Haifa’i. Minister for - Puri Pasha as Sa’id. Foreign Affairs Minister of Justice. Minister of Interior. Minister of Economics and Communications. Minister of Finance. Minister of Defence. Minister of Education. It will be noted that the Premier retained three members of the late Cabinet; Nuri Pasha as Sa’id, the Minister for Foreign Affairs; Yusuf Ghanima, the somewhat colourless Minister of Finance, and Abdul Hussain Chalabi, the Shi’a Minister of Education whose apparently enigmatic indifference to the demands of his co-religionists appeared to be his sole qualification for cabinet work. All the now ministers had previously held cabinet appointments at some time or other, but their qualifications for office in the present difficult situation were unlikely to commend themselves to the public, and the Premier’s choice of ministers failed to evoke the usual meed of praise accorded to new Cabinets by the ever optimistic government press. The new Minister of Interior was, at the time of his appointment, Chief Administrative Inspector, and is a man with long administrative experience, but is generally considered now to be past his best. The new Minister of Economics and Communications is a Kurd who had recently been active in putting forward Kurdish grievances, and it was pro bably felt that his inclusion in the Cabinet would help to remove some of the causes of Kurdish discontent. Tawfiq as Suwaidi, although perhaps not one of the more active loaders of the Opposition, had bi on definitely identified with the group of politicians who had brought about the downfall of Ali Jawdat’s ministry, and it would appear that his inclusion in the new Cabinet was designed to placate this group. The appointment of Tawfiq Beg as Suwaidi. Abdul Aziz Beg al Qassab. Amin Zaki Beg. Yusuf Beg Ghanima. Rashid Beg al Khoja. Adbul Hussain Chalabi.Page 3. the Minister of Justice seems to have been solely due to the desire to create some official appointment for Ali Jawdat, who was elected to fill Rashid Beg al I ho ja f placets President of the Chamber of Deputies by an over whelming majority, despite the somewhat pointed opposi tion from Raphael Butti, a Deputy for BA3RAH and editor of ”Al Bilad” newspaper. On 6th March a Royal Iradah confirming the appointments of the new Ministers was read in the House and the Premier made his opening speech, in which he expounded the policy of the new Cabinetj this contained as little constructive thought as that of any of the Cabinets which has assumed office since the death of King Faisal 18 months ago, and it remained to be seen whether the Opposition would be content with the removal of Ali Jawdat and Arshad al Umari, who had made himself exceedingly unpopular as Minister of Economics and Com munications, and would permit this new and unconvincing Cabinet to remain in office until the end of the present parliamentary session. The issue did not remain long in doubt, for, as described in paragraph 73 et seq below, reports were received on 9th March that a revolt had broken out in the Middle EUPHRATES area led by Abdul Y/ahid al Hajji Sikkar, who had throughout been in v^ry close touch with the Baghdadi politicians who had brought about Ali Jaw- dat’s downfall, and there was little doubt that these politicians had not been placated by the re-shuffle of Cabinet appointments and had instigated the revolt. The Minister of Interior was despatched to DIWANTYAH, where he summoned the tribal leaders to come and submit their grievances, but this summons mot with little response; only a few shaikhs known to be at enmity with Abdul Wahid came in and none of the tribal leaders who were known to have been hostile to the late government put in an appearance. Consequently, the Minister was obliged to return to BAGHDAD and report that his mission had been a failure. In the meantime, Parliament had been prorogued for a month and steps had been taken to concentrate forces at HILDA and DIWANIYAH and from the former a column was sent to A3U SUKHAIR, about 10 miles South of KUFAIi, on the edge of the FATLAH-MISHKAB country in which the revolt had started. Owing to the nature of the country, particularly at this time of the year when the EUPHRATES is in flood and movement away from the roads is practically impossible, it would obviously be very difficult for the army to penetrate beyond this point. There was, therefore, some talk of using the Royal * Iraqi Ain Force for bombing operations. From the time when the first report of trouble was received, ’Iraqi aircraft had made daily demonstrations over the disturbed area and there was a proposal that an ulti matum should be dropped on 13th March that Abdul Wahid’s house should be bombed the following day unless hg came in and submitted his grievances. The Cabinet was, however, by no means unanimous a' to the advisability of this course of action before some serious act ofPage 4. violence had been coiamitted, and there was also some doubt as to tho reliability of the army in these cir cumstances, for there v/ere rumours that a number of the troops sent to DIWANIYAH and HILLA had deserted and that those at ABU SUKHAIR had been fraternising with the tribesmen. The government therefore decided to post pone offensive action until after the feast of the ”Id al Adha”, which this your lasted from 15th to 19th March. There seemed to be no probability that the government would be able to settle the trouble, and on 15th March the Prime Minister resigned and Yassin Pasha al Hashimi was invited to form a new Cabinet. The new Cabinet was composed as follows:- Prime Minister Yassin Pasha al Hashimi. Minister of - Rashid Ali Beg Gailani. Interior. Minister of - da*afar Pasha al Askeri. Defence. Minister for - Nuri Pasha al Sa'id. Poroign Affairs. Minister of - Amin Zaki Beg. Economics and Communications. Minister of - Muhammed Zaki Bog. Justice. Minister of - Riza al Shabibi. Education. Minister of - Rauf Beg al Bahraini. Finance. This might bo described as a coalition government. Of Ali Jawdat f s ministers there only remainod Nuri Pasha as Sa’id, hut da'afar Pasha al Askeri, his brother—in—law, has always been closeiy allied with him politically. Amin Zaki, theother survivor from Jamil Madfa'i’s short-lived Cabinet, although he probably owed his portfolio to his pre sentation of Kurdish grievances, has never been a political adheront of the new Premier. Yassin Pasha al Hashimi, although possibly not directly implicated in the intrigues which led up to the revolt in tno Middle EUPHRATES area, was certainly not hostile to the movement, and his chief lieutenant, Rashid Axi .«.- Gailani, whom ho made his Minister of the interior^ was believed to have been its chief instigator, new Minister #f Justice, a Sunni lawyer, probably owes his appointment to the desire to appease ...v Baghdadi lawyers who had proved so difficult towards the end of Ali Jawdat’s ministry, and the now : uuotv of Education and Finance are Shi’as, who, though t u vPago 5. took no priminent part in stirring up the opposition to Ali Jaw&amp;at, are members of Yassin’s ”Ikha party” and have always been closely idontifiud with him in politics. Thus the new Cabinet must be considered a triumph for the forces of disorder, since the majority of its members were in sympathy with the opposition to Ali Jawdat, and the tactics which had turned him out of office and led up to the revolt. This Cabinet does, however, contain certain disruptive olemnnts which will probably prevent its working harmoniously for very long. For some days it remained in doubt as to whether, having achieved their end, the political oppon ents of the two previous Cabinets would be able to put an end to the revolt or whether they had made use of a very dangerous weapon in stirring up Shi’a agitation, and had let loose forces which they would be unable to control; but, as described in the following section, by the end of the month the situation seemed to have been restored, although the history of the past two months must cause grave concern for the future government of ’IRAQ. The new Cabinet not only has to satisfy a number of demands from the Shi’as, but also, towards the end of the month, a number of grievances were submitted by Kurdish representatives, and there is, throughout the country, a feeling that the present administration is most unsatisfactory, and that the temporising methods adopted by successive governments in the past will no longer suffice. Shi*a Situation . In continuation of paragraph 36 of the February Summary of Intelligence, during the month of February reports had been received from several areas of unrest amongst the Shi’a tribesmen and of demonstrations against the government. It was also reported that this hostil ity to the government had received the approval of the religious leaders, provided that no actsjbf violence were committed. Before, however, Jamil Madra’i’shew Cabinet had had an opportunity to take any steps to remove this antagonism on the part of the Shi’a community, news was received in BAGHDAD that a campaign of civil disturbance had started. The first intimation was received in BAGHDAD on 9th March and the situation described by the Prime Minister that evening was that Abdul Wahid al Hajji Sikkar had entered the town of FAISALIYAH, about 15 miles south of KUFAH, with a body of armed men and had evicted the government officials and police from the serai, also that ho had left parties of armed men to control two of the main bridges leading into the FAISAL IYAH district. He suggested that the pro-government Deputies should return at once to their tribal districts and exert their influence to prevent other tribal sect ions from joining Abdul Wahid’s party and causing sub sequent disorder on a large scale. At the same time rumours were current in BAGHDAD that certain sectionsPage 6 of the Beni Huchaim tribal confederation had entered &amp;AMAWA, and that, under the leadership of the Al Hamad and Ash Shabbanah shaikhs, various elements of the Aqra confederation had entered DAGHAHAH town, seized the government offices and were also in occupation of the irrigation control head at SADR-AD-DAGHARAH, some 16 miles north-west of DAGHARAH, These rumours, although not without a found ation in fact, had been exaggerated; Abdul Wahid had entered FAISALIYAH on the 9th, but he made no attempt to take over the government offices, although the Mudir and the Commandant of Police considered it expedient to confine themselves to the serai in order to avoid a possible fracas with armed and excited Fatlah repres entatives; tribesmen, believed to be from the Albu Sultan, were in occupation of the irrigation building at SADR-AD-DAGHARAB, but the tribesmen who demonstrated at DAGHARAH had made no attempt to evict government officials and had returned to their homes without in cident by the morning of 10th March. Later reports from SAMAWA did not confirm the news that tribesmen from the Beni Huchaim had entered the town, although fires (a signal for a tribal gathering) had been observed be tween RUMAITHA and SAMARA. On 11th March, following an emergency meeting of the Cabinet, it was decided to send troops of the ’Iraq Army to the affected area nnd a government order was issued for a concentration of troops consisting of two columns of one battalion each with field artillery to be formed respectively at HILL/, and DIWANIYAH by 12th March; orders were also issued to the ’Iraqi Air Force to carry out demonstration flights over the tribal area concerned; the 10th battalion was moved from BASRAH to SAMAY/A and reached the latter town on the evening of 12th March. By 14th March the following troop movements had been completed:- 9th battalion had reached HILLA. 6th battalion had reached DIWANIYAH. 10th battalion had reached SAMAWA. In addition a mixed column escorted by one platoon of the Motor Machine Gun Company had reached ABU SUKHAIR. No attempt had been*made by any of the tribes to inter fere with railway traffic, but all bridges between SAMAWA and HILLA were guarded either by detachments of troops or police. A strict supervision was exercised over the local press and very little news was allowed to filter through; this was rather unfortunate, as it gave rise to the most exaggerated rumours in BAGHDAD. On 14th March, however, all papers published an official mani festo in which the action taken by Abdul Wahid and his followers was briefly recorded and stating that the Minister of Interior had visited the district and order ed the leading shaikhs concerned to surrender to the government. The manifesto ended with a statement to the effect that the government still hoped that the matter could be amicably settled without bloodshed.OEESaBS Pago 7. 73. The two most noteworthy features of the revolt had been the fact that the Shi f a community wore by no moans unanimous in their approval of the misdemeanours. Certain of the tribas were definitely hostile to Abdul V/ahid and were clamouring that he and his followers must be punished for their off ences. Thus the leaders of the Afaj Confederation, whose position downstream of the Aqra group rendered tl.eir lands liable to water shortage or flood at the hands of anyone in control of the SADR-AD-DAGHARAH regulator head, and who had more over already experienced economic pressure of this des cription, though remaining loyal to the government de manded punitive action against the associated Aqra and Patlah groups as a sign of government strength. The second feature of importance, was that the movement had been characterised by a most unusual degree of restraint. Shots had been fired, but rifles had merely been dis charged into the air, and not a single casualty was re ported. in these circumstances, although it was obvi ously desirable that the government should take some strong action immediately if it were to avoid alien ating the sympathy of the tribesmen who had remained loyal, there was a natural reluctance to employ armed force against fellow countrymen who had done nothing more serious than cutting a few telephone wires and^in- torrupting the traffic at one or two bridges. This dilemma proved too much for the Cabinet and as described in paragraph 68 above, Jamil Madfa’i resigned and was replaced by Yassin. 79, The new Cabinet’s first move was to issue a communique appealing to those whoso minds had been dis turbed by recent evunts to disperse peacefully to their homes within throe days, and copies were scattered by aircraft over the disturbed areas. Emissaries of the government persuaded Abdul Wahid to repair the bridges which he had interrupted and the DAGHARAH regulator was evacuated. The more troublesome situation was in the SHAMIYAH area, where the tribal loaders who had remained loyal to the previous government were most reluctant to disperse their followers and were protesting that Abdul Wahid must be punished. On 20th March, Nuri Pasha as Sa T id accompanied by Rashid Ali al Gailani left BAGHDAD for DIWAN!YAH and mot large gatherings of the tribesmen there and at SHAMIYAH and AFAJ. The interviews were not altogether satisfactory and the two ministers re turned with divergent views as to the proper course of action for the government to take. Nuri was convinced that trouble at some future date must be expected from the tribes who are hostile to Abdul Wahid unless ho is punished, while Rashid Ali appeared to think that as the civil disobedience campaign had been called off on the Cabinet’s instructions, no further action was necessary, and this view seems to have had the support of the Prime Minister. 80. At a conference at NAJAF between 21st and 23rd March, a number of Shi’a demands were drawn up under the auspices of the Ulema, and a copy is attached as Appendix ’’A 1 ’* It is understood that almost all the Shi’a leaders, including those hostile to Abdul Wahid, have agreed tl:&gt; t the leading Alim, Shaikh MuhammedJ mi-r~ Page 8. Hussain Kashif al Ghata, shall be authorised to repre sent the Shi’a community and to present their demands to the King and Cabinet, but there is some doubt as to the attitude of Abdul Wahid himself and his chief lieutenant, Sha'alan al Attiyuh, the leader of the dis order in the DAGHARAII district. It is possible that these self-constitutoi upholders of Shi*a rights will not be agreeable to their position being usurped at this stage by the religious leaders* At the end of the month the situation was undetermined; while the civil disobedience campaign had definitely terminated, there was a general feeling that the trouble had blown over too easily, that while a number of the demands could and possibly would be agreed to by the government, the Shi’as had been shown how easily pressure could be brought to bear on the government in this country, and that something should be done to prevent a recurrence of this unsatisfactory situation. Kurdish Nationalism , The 'Pashlawi Society” in KIRKUK (mentioned in paragraph 44 of the Summary of Intelligence for February 1934), which changed its name later, with official permission, to ”Jama’yat Khairiyat Islami, and in July 1934 was suppressed by Hussain Awni Effendi, acting Mutassarrif of KIRKUK, is now reported to have been revived under its old name. The membership no longer contains Government officials but consists, apparently, mainly of pension ers and ex-officials of doubtful character, who are unemployed and mostly in difficult financial straights. They are said to meet regularly to discuss Kurdish propaganda and to try to induce Kurdish chiefs visiting KIRKUK to moot them. In February some of them sent a telegram to the Ministry of Education stating that they had heard of bad treatment and hostility to Kurdish students in BAGHDAD and requesting the Ministry to give their personal attention to the matter. It is reported that two Kirkuklis, Saiyid Bekr and Rashid Effendi, recently applied for permission to start a newspaper published both in Kurdish and Turkish* They have been granted permission to publish it in Turkish, but not in Kurdish. POLITICAL - FOREIGN . Turko-*Iraq Frontier . The situation on the border of the ZiJGIO Qadha is quiet. The Turko-’Iraqi Frontier Commission, which is hold every three months to settle disputes and meets alternately at ZAKHO (137 K/S&amp;.S/a) and JAZIRAT (J. 38.M.vas held at ZAKHO at the beginning of March.Page 9.

An unfortunate incident, resulting in the death of some 12 persons and the wounding of many others, took place at KADHIMAIN on the morning of 23rd March. The quarrel, which led to casualties out of all propor tion to its importance, arose in the first place between the Qaimmaqam of KADHIMAIN and some of the inhabitants over the question of the interment of a corpse in ground adjacent to the site of an old cemetery, which had buon taken over from the Waqf by the government and on which the shell of a projected post office was already in course of construction. The Shi’a burial party held that the new ceme-- tery selected by the government was unsuitable for huridl and that the ground was water-logged; argument led to an exchange of blows and destruction of property; the aggressors were warned that punitive measuresvould be adopted if the: refused to listen to reason and policePage 10. re-inforcements were telephoned for from BAGHDAD. It would appear that in the interim period the local police had 'been compelled to fire over the heads of the crowd; the armed cars from BAGHDAD with personnel to reinforce these police arrived at an unfortunate moment when the excitement was at its height and v/hen it appeared that the situation was completely out of hand. According to various statements published by eye-witnesses they open^fire point-blank on the crowd v/ithout giving them any opportunity to disperse, but the matter is still under inquiry and no official statement has as yet been published. Repercussions to this incident in BAGHDAD and the provinces were less marked than usual; in the former city a partially successful attempt was made to close the bazaars as a sign of protest, but in both KARBALA and NAJAF the matter appears to have been regarded as a brawl of no particular religious significance. The fact that the religious commun ities at both NAJAF and KARBALA are not on the best of terms with their confreres at KADHIMAIN may account for this broad-minded and intelligent acceptance of an unfortunate incident. A number of persons have been arrested in connection with this affair and are being detained in custody pending the results of the government inquiry. In the meantime the incident is still the main topic of conversation in the KADHIMAIN bazaars and coffee- shops and some apprehension is felt by the government that an opportunity may be sought to create further disturbances during the Muharram period which starts on 4th April. In view of this, extra police are being drafted to centres of possible trouble to cope with any emergency which may arise. SUIAIMANI Liwa. With the improvement in weather conditions there has been a revival of the activities of bandits under the various minor leaders. At the end of Feb ruary Saiyid Ata (paragraph 21 of the January Summary of Intelligence) was reported to bo active in the PENJWIN area, carrying out raids across the frontier, and he was engaged by a detachment of ’Iraqi police in the mountains near WAINB (2 I/m 13.a). The fight is supposed to have lasted all day, but no casualties have been reported; no more has however been heard of Saiyid Ata during the past month. Two Iranian bandits came to the village of BAWA KUCHUK (2 E/SE 30.b) on 18th February. In re sisting the police later, one was killed and the other was arrested and taken to HALABJA. There the arrested bandit told the police that he and his companion had teen sent by the Iranian Rais Tib of NAUSUD (2 l/SW 21.c) to kill the Qaimmaqam and the Assistant Command ant of Police of HALABJA. Though an improbable story, the HALABJA officials are reported to be now afraid toPage 11 go their club (which is on tho edge of the town beside the landing ground) in the evenings in case they are killed. The HALABJA police have since arrested 35 men from B/J/A KUCIMK and two neighbouring villages on a charge of harbouring the two bandits. Koikha Majid-i-Nabi Awa, who was believed by the police to have been staying since last December in the SHUAN country (2 A/NE. 14 to 17), moved early in March to the BAZIAN area (2 A/NE 30.b). This area was watched by the police and on 23rd March a patrol of 10 men and a head constable from SULAIMANI located him and a party of follov/ers, estimated by the police as 45 in number, at CHOLMAK FATTAH (2 E/m 25. d). The patrol, assisted by two armed police cars from KIRKUK and one company of the 2nd Frontier Battalion, ’Iraq Army, sent in lorries from SULAIMANI, engaged the bandits. The fight continued until dark, when the bandits escaped in the direction of SURDASH (2 E/m 8.c). The following day the troops were reported to be in pursuit. The casualties in the fight appear to have been one soldier killed and four wounded, four policemen wounded, and one bandit killed and three wounded. The government’s chief difficulty last year in dealing with bandits was the assistance afforded to them by the local villagers and the refuge available for them in the unadministered PIZHD3R area with the connivance of Abbas-i-Mahmud Agha; but for some time Babekr Agha and his brother Hajji Abbas-i-Selim Agha have been trying to dissuade Abbas-i-Mahmud Agha from sheltering bandits on the grounds that this course of action gives the government a good excuse for the ex tension of its administration into the PIZHD3R country, Babekr Agha seems to have been successful in that in September, Abbas-i-Mahmud Agha informed Shaikh Saiyid Muhammed pichkola that although his family would be given shelter, neither he nor his followers would be allowed into PIZHDER territory while their banditry continued. In November, when bad weather brought his activities to an end, pichkola went to GALWISHKA (l H/SAV 35. a) and in December moved to QINDQL (l H/SW. 35. c). Of the minor leaders, Hama Ali Rustam spent the winter in the MERGA District, but Khoika Majid was not allowed to enter PIZHD3R territory. Early in March, Abbas-i-Mahmud Agha is re ported to have received a letter from Babekr Agha to the effect that Hama Ali Rustam should not be allowed to carry out banditry in the SULAIMANI area, and on 7th March the leading pizhder Aghas mot at QALA DIZA (l H/SW 20. c) and swore on the ’’Quran” to vrark in con junction with one another. News v/as received from local villagers that, presumably for this reason, Hama Ali Rustam, with 25 followers, had moved to the hills behind JASANA (2 E/kW 7.b), but he has not yet been located by the police. It would appear that with the assistance of the Pizhder Anhas, the government could now make some real headway with the suppression of banditry in thePago 12 SULAIMANI district if it could devise some satisfactory solution to the difficulty about pichkola. This man is related to Shaikh Mahmud and is himself a prominent shaikh and is held in some veneration owing to his con nection with the principal m sqae in SULAIMANI. Con sequently, the government can expect little assistance in their attempts to deal with him. pichkola is now believed to be hostile to Shaikh Mahmud and is anxious to be reconciled to the govecnment, and it might be ad visable for his past misdeeds to be pardoned in the hope that the activities of minor bandit loaders would, as a result, be restrained. A pardon for Pichkola might also have a good effect on Abbas-i-Mahmud Agha, who is known to have been intriguing with the Jaf Segzadas, at whose in stigation he and his party have been holding meetings and agitating against the government’s administrative officials in opposition to the policy of the Selim faction of the Aghas, who are administering their territory in friendly relations with government official ZAKHO Qadh a. There has buon a vast improvement in law and order in the ZAKHO Qadha. No murders have occurred since the 22nd August, 1934, and brigandage has almost ceased. The feeling of security among the Christians in the Qadha has in consequence been greatly strength ened. The causes which have brought about this im proved situation are twofold. Firstly, the Turkish disarmament drive of 1934, in conjunction with the punitive measures taken against the brigand bands in TURKEY, has put a stop to tribal raiding into ’IRAQ for the time being. Secondly the Qaimmaqam of ZAKHO (Makki Beg) has been investigating past crimes commit ted in the Qadha and arresting and fining the culprits# He has enlisted the support of Saleh Agha of DARHAUZAN (137 K/SE 28. a), Mulla Jamal of SHARANISH ISLAM (137 K/SE 23. a) and Haj^i Badria of SPI1TDAB0K (137 K/SE 30. e) who keeps him informed regarding all Kurdish activities in the Qadha. His present policy appears to be to create dissension between the Kurdish Aghas and thus to weaken their power. As a result of a quarx 4 ©! which broke out re cently between the SINDI villagers of DERKAR (137 K/SE 22.d), the village has been disarmed by order of the Qaimmaqain, This action had caused a certain amount of talk among the Kurdish tribal chiefs of the Qadha, as they fear it may be a preliminary to gradual dis armament. BARZAN.Area ( 'Liwana' Confederation) . After an encounter between the police and Khalil Khoshawi’s followers in the GELI SULI Gorge (1 D/NW 8.a) on 17th January, there was a cessation of activities on the part of the rebels in the BARZAN area until the be .Inning of March, presumably due toPago 13. 100 . 101 . 102 . 103. 104. 105. winter* conditions. During this period the police searched the houses of certain followers of Shailh Ahmed in the vicinity of BARZAN village (1 D/NW l.d) and con fiscated twenty-three rifles which they found. Mean while, the government were busy making plans and pre parations for rounding up the outlaws as soon as move ment should again become possible on an organised scale, which is usually tov/ards the end of March. The army authorities in BAGHDAD arranged for personnel of the 1st Frontier Battalion at BILLEH (1 D/NW 7.d) to be ready to take over the police duties at BARZAN and RAIZAN (l D/OT 8.d), and of the 3rd Frontier Battalion at DIANA (1 D/NE 19.d) to do the same at KHAIRUZOK (1 D/NW 4.d) and MERGAS0R (1 D/NW 16.b), in order to free their police garrisons, as soon as operations against Khalil Khoshawi might be about to commence. At the end of February the MOSUL authorities, who had frequently requested the Turkish Mudir of GERANA (1 C/SW 33.b) and the Qaimmaqam of DIZA GAWAR (l. C.B. 2) to expel Khoshawi from the Turkish GIRDI area, were in formed by the Turkish authorities at VAN that one in fantry and one gendarmerie battalion had been despatched to the BEROKH area (1 C/SW 33.d) to expel Khoshawi from Turkish territory. As a preliminary step to their proposed oper ations, the 'Iraqi civil authorities temporarily trans ferred the MERGAS0R Nahiyah of the ROWANDUZ Qadha from the ARBIL to the MOSUL Liwa with effect from 1st March, and Abdulla Awni Beg (Commandant of Police, MOSUL) re sumed command of the Police Striking Force in the BARZAN area from Ali Said Beg (Commandant of Police, ARBIL). Realising that punitive measures were thus in full preparation against them, a group of Khoshawi's followers attacked SHIRWAN-A-MAZIN Police Post (l D/NW 3.a), but without success, and also without casualties to either side. The authorities immediately sent re inforcements of sixty police from MOSUL Town to SHIRWAN- A-MAZIN and twenty-five police from the ZAKHO and AMADIA Qadhas to the ZIBAR Qadha, On Sth March, a column of Turkish troops, reported to amount to 300 men, arrived at SHAPATAN (1 C/SW 29.d). They were not accompanied by pack trans port owing to the severe winter conditions in the GIRDI area. On 13th March the column arrived at 3ISKA (l C/SW 34.b), local tribesmen being made to transport the stores and ammunition. The troops are reported to have then taken up their position at the following GIRDI villages:- BEROKH (1 C/SW 33.d), SERUKANI (1 C/SW 34.c), NIHAWA, MUSEKA, and ISIA (1 P/NW 4.t). On the approach of the Turkish forces, Khalil Khoshawi and his followers, leaving their families be hind, crossed over into 'IRAQ, entered the MERGASOR area, via the KEKLA Ferry (1 D/NW 4.d), and split up into small bar.d^, 0 - March 9th one of these bands raided PIRAN ' ..ago (l D/NW 11. a) and killed onem 106* 107. 108. 109.

About loth i.arch three Khailuni tribesmen were held up be tween GERY/A BIR (1 D/NW 24. c) and HilVDI/JT (1 D/NW 24. d) by a gang of twenty armed Khoshawl followers and re lieved of their arms, money and seven mules. No date had been fixed for starting the OI&gt;era ' tion ? a gainst Khoshawi, pending the arrival of Spring conditions in the area, but in view of this early activity on the part of his followers the army arrangements for releasing police garrisons were now + 0n llth March 106 men the 3rd Frontier Battalion left DIANA under Rais Amin Rowanduzi and atMERG' ?^ Mij&lt;RGAS0R on 13th March.

Headquarters of the Police Striking Force en issued instructions that all inhabitants of vil- lages in the MERGASOR Nahiyah must move with their ^ ^ ocks t0 MEROASOR or KEilIRUZOK, or to any of the following villages:- BIRISIA.

Those instructions appear to have met with general oomplianoe in both areas. a further announcement, however, was made by Striking Force Headquarters that any village found giving ro- be 8 burnt SUPPli ° 8 t0 Khosha wi and his followers would It is reported that a police post of thirty men has now been established at SHAN-A-DAR (l D/NT.V 15.b) and small posts are said to have been established in villages in the neighbourhood.

The Striking Force qTTTl5fn SOd in b ^f n u n ? t ^ e villa g GS in the MAZUR I and SHIRWAN area, which in the past have given refuge and suppiies to the Khoshawi gang, and the rebels are said to bo finding great difficulty in obtaining supplies, mainly due to the fact that the majority of the inhab itants have evacuated their villages and come in to the specially police guarded villages. As .a result, the majority of the rebels are reported to have left the SHIRWAN and MERGASOR areas and are new believed to bo located north of KANI RASH. To prevent the possibility of their endeavouring to obtain food sup plies by force from the Baradost tribe, all inhabitants m the 8HANASHA (1 C/SW 35.c) - KANI RASH (l 0/SW 36.c) area have been instructed to move with their families and flocks either to SHANASHA or KANI RASH. As an iUiffPago 15. 110 . 111 . 112 . 113 . additional precaution, a post (garrisoned by Dosko and 100 irregular police) has been established at SKAkASHA in order to prevent the rebels from escaping into Turkish territory. The total number of police engaged in the operations is not known, but it is estimated that, ex cluding the posts taken c' er by the army, there are now in the area approximately 8 permanent and 7 temporary police posts, with approximately 115 regular police and 100 tribesmen (enrolled as irregular police) employed to garrison them, and that the Police Striking Force consists of about 200 regular police and ICO tribesmen as irregular police. The number of Khalil Khoshawi’s followers is not known either, but io variously reported as anything from 100 to 300. It is believed, however, that they number between 80 and 100&gt; excluding the Turk ish GIRDI followers of Muhammed Amin, who have probably remained in their own area. It is rumoured that the Turkish authorities have removed the families of the Khoshawi rebels from the BER0KH area to DIZA' ga ; .va'r (l.O.B. 2), and have arrested all Mukhtars of Turkish GIRDI villages who have in the past given refuge to Khoshawi and his gang. AHADIA and ZIBAR Qadhas . Further east, the activities of Khalil Khoshawi have so embarrassed the authorities that sporadic looting of Assyrian villages in BARWAR-I-ZHER and ZIBAR has gone unpunished. It is believed that Korshid Agha and the ZIBARI followers of Paris Agha were responsible for these offences and the Assyrians are convinced that for the present the government is unable to afford them protection. A report which has not yet been confirmed states that in consequence Shamasha Saifo of GIRBISH (137 P/NS 18.b), Shamasha Talu of DUWARIA (137 P/NE 11. d) and Rais Neesan of KURTKA (137 p/NE 16.a.4.9. unmarked) have visited Paris Agha and requested him to take the Assyrians in the ZIBAR area under his protection in return for their payment to him of ’’agha dues”, and it is understood that Paris Agha has agreed to do so. If true, it is presumed that these dues are additional to the rent^Istihlakf' (produce) tax, and Koda (animal) tax already being paid to government. PHYSICAL GEOGRPHHY &amp; C01vIMUNICAT T 0ITS. TIGRIS Floods . In addition to the damage mentioned in para graphs 50 to 54 of last month’s Intelligence Summary, it is now reported that ' ,r AJ.iA Bridge (1 D/NW 3.d) which has only just been rebuilt, was washed away on 17th February.Page 16. Pama;;e to BAGHDA D Br id ges . A sand storm, accompanied ty winds of except ional velocity, caused much inconvenience throughout central f IRAQ on 30th March and occasioned considerable damage to the two floating bridges which span the TIGRIS in the Capital. The old Kotah Bridge, which dates back to the days of the Turkish Occupation, ex perienced the major damage as some of the pontoons sank and dragged the framework of the bridge to the bottom of the river; it is considered improbable that this bridge will be repaired. The Maude Bridge also sustained minor damage and has been closed to traffic for a period of four or five days ponding eq^ential repairs. The pontoon bridge at KADHIMAIN, which was sheltered by a bend in the river from the main violence of the storm, at present carries all traffic between the right and left banks. NAJAF - MEDINA Pilgrim Route . In continuation of paragraph 55 of the Feb ruary Summary of Intelligence, the first large convoy on the new pilgrim route passed through AL AIDA for MEDINA and MECCA on 25th February. The convoy con sisted of tv/enty-nino cars carrying 15C passengers. A further small convoy of seven cars passed through a week later. The first convoy, which consisted of the ’Iraqi students and boy scouts, was reported to have arrived safely at MECCA on 6th Maroh.APPENDIX 'V.'. * ).» Fi IR/ vQ» b, of .v- • IURCK, 19.35 .

Since its establishment until now the ’IRAQ Government has been following an undesirable policy which is uncompatitle with the interests of the people. It has adopted the policy of sectarian dissension as the foundation of governing. The majority of the people is represented by one or two Ministers who keep pace with the authorities in their policy. Qn similar lines it has proceeded in the appointment of officials and deputies while the Constitutional Law does not distinguish between the people as is stated in Section 6 of the Constitutional Law for founding satisfaction to the people and preventing dissensions.

The present system of elections is misused so |:hat the Parliament is not duly representative of the people. As a guarantee against the interference of the Government in the elections we consider that the Electoral Law should be amended in such a way as to safeguard full liberty by making provisions for preventing the Government from direct or indirect inter ference. The elections should be in our degree and each Liwa should be considered to bo an independent electoral area. Section 5. While Section 77 of the Constitutional Law provides for the appointment of Shara Qadhis of the sect of the majority of the inhabitants, the Shara authority is granted to the sect of the minority of the population. Wo therefore demand that the said section of the Constitutional Law should be applied and that the Shi’a doctrine should bo studied in the Law College.Section 11 .

KURDISTlkN, At the ‘beginning of October, 1934, .the author ities of BUT All ( 2 3/NE 5.t) v;ere demanding greatly in creased taxes from the local tribes, and all the Mangur, Mamish, and Piran Aghas went to SAUJ BULAGH (1 H, C. 1.) to complain to the government. Nothing further was heard of the matter during the winter, but it is now reported that alleged arrears of taxes are being busily collected, and are ruining many, including some of the Baneh Begzadas, who are said to have deserted their homes on this account. The MERIVAN (2 I.A.2.) authorities on the Other hand are reported to have adopted a conciliatory policy towards their people, and to have told them that the pahlevi dress is no longer compulsory. The headmen and mullahs of the villages are said to have been called to MERIVAN and told to go back and assure the people of the friendly attitude of the government towards them, and to say that anyone requiring it will receive finan cial aid to help them with their cultivation. An explanation of this difference in policy may possibly be found across the 'IRAQ border. Opposite the BANEH district is the tribal area of the Pizhder Aghas, at present unadministered by the ’Iraq Government, and that portion of the SHAH BAZHER Qadha which is semi independent under its own Aghas, all of whom have so far shewn their independence of IRAN in the SARDASHT (1 H/SW 30.b) area and so are unlikely to be impressed by any blandishments of Iranian officials. The policy of breaking the power of tribal leaders by heavy, not to say confiscatory, taxation in the BANEH district can therefore be openly pursued. Opposite the MERIVAN district lies the BARZINJA (2 E/NE 33.c) area. As ex plained in paragraph 115 of the Summary of Intelligence for May, 1934, the Iranian policy appears to be to treat the BARZINJA Shaikhs who crossed over into IRAN in April, 1934, with marked generosity, and to induce other influential ’Iraqi landowners to cross over and settle in IRAN, in the hope that their contented presence will provide the Irani government with an argument for frontier readjustment at the expense of ’IRAQ.SECTION V a.'UDIA, SAU-5.

HOME POLITICS. Dissolu tion of Parliament . A Royal Iradali was issued on 9th April dis solving Parliament and proclaiming a general election. The full text of f.e Inadah which was published in the local press was to t.-c- effect that tiiere was lack of harmony between Parliament and the Cabinet and that His Majesty considered that the discordant element could only be removed by means of a general election and the creation of a new Majlis. The Royal decision to dissolve Parliament, though undoubtedly a wise one in that it gave the har- ried^government^a chance to straighten up affairs in the interim period before the elections, had a mixed reception, especially amongst members of the late Majlis whose prospects of re-election are by no means certain. At the moment both press and public are somewhat apath etic and, as even the political grouping of the leaders in BAGHDAD is as yet undetermined, none of the leader writers of the local press has ventured a forecast as to the result of the elections or its probable effect on Yassin Pasha’s government. P olitical Situation . During the past month the government was chiefly occupied in negotiations with tribal leaders who arrived in BAGHDAD from various parts of the count ry in considerable numbers. The largest contingent was from the Middle EUPHRATES area headed by Abdul Wanid al Hajji Sikkar who had led the campaign of civil disobedience. a number of Kurdish chiefs added to the picturesqueness of the BAGHDAD streets and for some days congested the entrances to the various ministries. The biggest contingent came from Southern KURDISTAN and represented a number of tribes, the only one of any importance being the Jaf. There is little doubt that the political opponents of Ali Jawdat and Jamil Madfa’i had planned an extension of the civil disobedience campaign from the Middle EUPHRATES to the area round KIRKUK, KIFRI and KHANIQIN and that it was called off when Yassin Pasha al Hashimi was invited to form a Cabinet. These tribal leaders, therefore, probably came to BAGHDAD at the invitation of Yassin to give the impression that there was serious discontent throughout f IRAQ which the new government would have the task of removing. Later, representatives of some of the more important tribes, such as the Surchi, Khoshnau and Dizdai, also arrived in BAGHDAD. Abdul Wahid and his followers alone appeared to have any business of importance to negotiate with the government as described in paragraph 122; the re mainder appeared to have regarded their visit as a very pleasant outing which was interspersed with a number of garden parties and receptions attended by persons of such diverse interests as Shaikh Mahmud and Shaikh Ali Sulaiman of thu, Dulaim, and the general tenor of the speeches was the unity of ’IRAQ and the loyalty of all parts to King and country.Page 2. 120 . 121 . 122 . After about ten days stay the tribal leaders left again for their homes giving the impression that a jolly time had been enjoyed by all. The Shi' a Situat ion . In continuation of paragraph 80 of the March Summary. Although the end of March saw the termination of the Shi’a campaign of civil disobedience and also heralded a return to conditions of ostensible law and order in most districts, these two factors could in no way be regarded as an indication that the government was in a position to resume control or that anything more fundamental or lasting than a slight decrease in tension between government and the tribes had been mutu ally agreed upon by both parties. In the MISHKAB area Abdul Wahid had agreed to replace the bridges that he had removed near the town of PAISALIYAH and had also sanctioned tribal labour to repair the damaged bund on the EUPHRATES which had already caused considerable damage through flooding; he had gained a good deal of ground and had considerably extended his prestige with his own particular tribal followers not only in the MISHKAB but also in the associated Fatlah group at HINDIYAH and with members of the Al Aqra confederation in the DAGHARAH district, and was now prepared to come to terms with the government as now constituted. This brought about a somewhat curious situation in that the shaikhs who had previously been loyal to the government, such as certain sections of the Aqra, Humaidat, Awabid and the majority of the Afaj confederation, now demanded the punishment of Abdul Wahid and his associates; and, during the early part of April, demonstrations at first demanding government action and subsequently becoming anti-government in tone tended to centre around the RUMAITHA and ’IBRA districts. On 1st April Abdul Wahid al Hajji Sikkar, accompanied by his chief supporter, Sha’alan al Atiya, arrived in BAGHDAD for the‘purpose of interviewing Yassin Pasha al Hashimi, the new Prime Minister, and discussing the Shi’a situation with him before appending his signature to the petition which had been drawn up by Muhammed Hussain Kashif al Ghata in NAJAF. The arrival of Ahdul Wahid in BAGHDAD WEST created something of an impression as he was accompanied by some 300 araaad followers of the FATLAH in over 60 motor cars and gave the general impression of a conqueror entering a van quished city rather than a tribal chief coming to the Capital to present a petition. The government viewed the arrival of this somewhat formidable gathering of shaikhs with some disfavour and it was left to the local press to sound a tactful and harmonious note by referring to this tribal invasion as 'a desire on the part of the Middle EUPHRATES leaders to proclaim their unswerving loyalty to King Ghazi and the Hashimite Dynasty ,, . On 2nd April Abdul Wahid, accompanied by the more influen tial members of his deputation, interviewed Rashid Ali Beg al Gailani, the new Minister of Interior, and later on in the same day the same deputation presented it self before the Council of Ministers and the King at his residence at the Qasr-al-Zahour; the latter was a purely formal meeting and members of the deputation» Page 3, were admitted to His Majesty singly. None of these meetings achieved any useful purpose, hut in his first meeting with Rashid Ali? Abdul Wahid gave a fairly obvi ous clue to his future line of conduct when he stated tnat, though fully in sympathy with the religious lead ers, he considered that Shi'a demands must be treated on a non-sectarian basis, and that he must first con sult the tribal leaders from the north who had come in to moot him. 123. 124. 125 . After the meetings referred to above Sha'alan al Atiya, who since his visit to MECCA in 1928 appears to have become something of an idealist, began to evince definite distrust of Yassin Pasha and his policy; he considered that the Shi'as were again in danger of ex ploitation at the hands of the BAGHDAD politicians and pressed Abdul Wahid to append his signature to the petition drawn up by Kashif al Ghata without further delay. Abdul Wahid, however, who has not been so much in the lime-light since the 1920 rebellion when he drove a silver-mounted carriage and pair about the HILDA Liwa^to the edification of the local populace, was unwilling to vacate the unique position which had been created for him in BAGHDAD as leader of the Shi'a party and loyal supporter of the new government; as long as he could continue to oscillate pleasantly be tween deputations and tea parties he was content to see a considerable modification of the original Shi’a demands. Following on a meeting of the tribal shaikhs at KADHIMAIN on 7th April it was decided to ask Ja'afar Abu Tinunan to proceed to NAJAP in order to interview Kashif al Ghata and to ascertain from him whether he was willing to incorporate certain amendments to his n Pact of the People 5 ’, the twelve outstanding points of Which were published in detail as Appendix 'A' of the March Summary of Intelligence. In the event of Kashif al Ghata being prepared to agree to the modification of his original petition, it was generally understood that Ja'afar Abu Timman had been authorised to sign the pet ition on behalf of the whole Patlah and associated tri bal groups including Abdul Wahid himself. da*afar Abu Timman duly proceeded to NAJAF on the morning of the 8th but was unable to persuade Kashif al Ghata to ac cept any modification of his original demands and, as a result, he returned to BAGHDAD on 9th April and told Abdul Wahid that his mission had been unsuccessful and that there was now a definite division between the re ligious element and the tribal leaders in as much as their respective aims and ideals were concerned. This was no news to Abdul Wahid for, in the interim period which had elapsed between the drawing up of the first petition and the visit of Ha’afar Abu Tim man to NAJAP, his ov/n views on Shi’a rights and Shi’a representation In the government of 'IRAQ had undergone considerable modification; in their revised form they tended to eliminate clauses which conferred material benefits solely on members of the Shi'a faith and to be come general rather than sectarian. The most important items embodied in the suggested list of amendments to the original petition included: -mt 116 . 127 . Page 4. (i) The abolition of the Senate and reduction in the number of members appointed as deputies, (ii) Amendment (unspecified) of the 1930 treaty, (iii) Amendment of the Tribal Civil and Criminal Disputes Regulations, (iv) General reduction of officials' salaries, (v) Abolition of land and water tax, and (vi) Free elections. The chief leaders of the group sponsoring these amend ments and gathered under the banner of Abdul Wahid and the Fatlah group were:- Saiyid Muhsin Abu Tabbikh, Muhammed al 'Abtan, Sa’adun al Hasan and Saiyid Alwan al Yasiri, while the group that had gradually diverged from the Abdul Wahid faction and were pressing for the immediate signature of the original petition drawn up by Kashif al Ghata included Sha'alan al Atiya, Saiyid Ja'afar Abu Tabbikh (Muhsin's brother), Sulman al Barrak and Mizher al Hajoi Saqab. The dissolution of Parliament and the decision to hold yet another general election, as detailed in paragraph 116, appeared to create a definite lull in the political activities of the Shi'a leaders; numerous meetings continued to be held but these were largely of a social nature and it was generally accepted that no further progress would be possible until the actual date of the election had been settled. In the meatime re ports from the Holy Cities indicated that there had been a reconciliation between Muhammed Hussain Kashif al Ghata, Abdul Kerim al Jazairli, the Shi'a Alims of NAJAF, and other leaders of religious thought with the object of saving some of the Shi*a chestnuts before the polit ical fire became too hot to make such extraction possi ble; between them an endeavour was made to persuade Abdul Wahid to append his signature to the original document drawn up by Kashif al Ghata, but up to the end of the month A^dul Wahid had managed to evade any defin ite declaration of policy and, judging from his activ ities in BAGHDAD, appears to have come to the conclusion that if he plays his cards properly there will be a Senatorship or possibly even a ministerial portfolio awaiting him after the general election in June. King's Visit to the North . H.M. King Ghazi, accompanied by his cousin Prince Abdul I'lah and a number of his ministerial staff, left BAGHDAD on 18th April on a short visit to the north as the guest of Shaikh Ajil al Yawwar, the paramount shaikh of the Northern Shammar. The tour was devoid of any obvious political motive and may have arisen out of a desire, expressed by His Majesty during the period when Ajil was a visitor in BAGHDAD, to visit the ruins at HATHA; at the same time it was sound policy for H.M. to establish himself as a definite per sonality with the more influential northern shaikhs. His Majesty and party returned to BAGHDAD on 22nd April; a visit to the southern pro' .roes is proposed in the near future.Page 5 Assyri a n Aff airs. 123# For some time previously it had hecome known that an unfavourable report on BRITISH GUIANA as a place of settlement for the Assyrian nation was to be expected. On 21st March the local press published a Reuter message from QNNBVA to the effect that although the area inspected ty the commission headed by Brigadier Browne was in many resects suitable, the difficulties to be overcome were so great that the League of Nations had abandoned the project. At the same time it was announced that another scheme was under consideration. 129. There had been constant propaganda amongst the Assyrians in ’IRAQ for some months past that the French authorities were willing to allow them to join their compatriots in SYRIA, but that the British had refused to allow it. It is understood that as soon as the League of Nations committee had taken the decision to abandon the BRITISH GUIANA proposal, the French au thorities were approached and conversations took place in PARIS, where M. de Martel had been summoned from SYRIA. On 25th April, the local press announced that at a meeting of the Council of the League of Nations on 17th April, it had been stated that the French gov ernment had favourably received the suggestion that more Assyrians should be allowed to join those who have already been settled in SYRIA. For the present the intention is to expand the area on the KHABUR River, where 2,000 Assyrians are already settled, to accom modate 4,500 more. Eventually it is hoped that it may be possible to settle a total of 16,500, but the French government has stipulated that neither the French nor the local budgets shall be required to bear the expense and the League was required to give an undertaking that the necessary funds will be made available. 130. A representative of the League left GENEVA on 26th April for BEYROUTH, whence, after discussing matters with M. de Martel, he is expected to proceed to ’IRAQ to make preliminary investigations. It is not expected that, even if no serious obstacles are discovered, any more Aysyrians will be able to leave ’IRAQ until next July at the earliest, and it will be many months before all who wish to emigrate will be able to do so. 131. in the meantime, 1,850 Dinars had been allotted in the new budget for the maintenance of the women and children in the refugee camp at MOSUL. British Advisory Officials . 132, A number of contracts of British officials employed by the ’IRAQ Government in an advisory capacity expired during April and were not renewed. Amongst these is that of Sir Kinahan Cornwallis who has, for a number of years, acted as Adviser to the Minister of Interior, and who has been intimately associated with the national development of 'IRAQ since the coronation of the late King Faisal in 1921. The fact that the ’IRAQ Government did not elect to extend Sir Kinahan's contract not only occasioned surprise in official cir cles, but also aroused a good deal of indignation andPage 6. 133. 134. 135. protest amongst the more stable members of the shaikhly community, especially those in the^IAPA Liwa, who had grov/n to rely on the presence of this British Adviser at the Ministry of Interior as a check on hastily conceived measures put through by new ministers which might be detrimental to the interests cf the tribes. There is little doubt that there is in actuality a personal motive behind the government’s decision not to renew their con tract with Sir r.anahan Cornwallis, and it is probable that Yassin Pasha al hahiimi, the Prime Minister, is not only jealous of the esteem in which he is held by the shaikhly community, but also of his influence with the Palace. INTERNAL SECURITY. Muharram Celebrations , Muharram celebrations, a period of mourning of ten days observed by the Shi’as in commemoration of the death of Hussain Ibn Ali, took place over the period 4th to 14th April. Although the celebrations were held this year during a time when political feeling was still running high in most districts, only one incident of an untoward nature has been reported from Liwas in which the Shi’a element predominates. This specific incident occurred at SHATTRAH where the Qaimmaqam endeavoured to place a ban on the normal evening processions; the population of the town refused to obey this order and the procession, when formed, came into contact with the police; shots were exchanged on both sides and two policemen and three townsmen are stated to have been wounded. In BAGHDAD and KADHIMAIN a very rigorous con trol was exercised throughout the period of Muharram; the financial guarantees of good behaviour required from the leading citizens in each urban district were raised to a prohibitive figure and, as a result, none of the usual Muharram processions took place and the celebrat ions were confined to isolated gatherings of the Shi 1 a community in each district. Another marked feature of the celebrations in BAGHDAD was the complete absence of the masochistic element; the breast beaters and flagel lants were eliminated and the grief of the celebrants appeared to be held in check and did not reach any sense' tional climax on the 10th day. The Sunni press, natur ally rather prone to regard any Shi’a festival as a pagan rite, has written several articles on the subject v;elcoming this emasculated version of Muharram as a step in the right direction. No attempt, however, was made to interfere with, or amend, the traditional ceremonies at either NAJAF or KERBALA. Minor Disturbances in the Middle EUPHRATES Area . The instability of the political situation in BAGHDAD and the consequent relaxation of government con' trol in the provinces was speedily mirrored by aPage 7. 136. 137. 138. 139 . progressive deterioration in law and order in the major ity of tribal districts. Old tribal quarrels took on a new lease of life, while land disputes, originating in the time of the Turkish Occupation, were revived, not with a view to settlement by arbitration, but by force of arms. The first incident of this latter nature was reported from the KUT Liwa at the beginning of April when police had to be sent out from Liwa Headquarters to prevent an outbreak of fighting between the Zubaid and Beni Rabi’a. The root of the trouble in this case centred in the ownership of certain lands farmed by the Zubaid tribesmen, the ownership of which is contested by the Beni Rabi'a on the grounds that they have a prior claim. But for the intervention of the govern ment both sections were prepared to resort to arms and settle the matter in time-honoured tribal manner. In the desert area to the south-west of NAJAF a party of armed tribesmen from the Khazail attacked a bedouin party, moving into KARBALA for the purchase of supplies, and robbed them of 17 camels. Although the looted camels were subsequently recovered by the police, the fact that a comparatively law abiding tribe such as the Khazail had elected to indulge in highway robbery was in itself significant. According to local inform ation this armed party did not disperse after they had handed over the camels to the police, but moved into SHINAFIYAH, a large village on the EUPHRATES with a fluctuating population drawn from the semi-nomadic tribes, where they again came into contact with the police. Owing to the large number of armed tribesmen in the town the Commandant of Police decided to take no chances, and backed up his order for the tribesmen either to hand in their arms or leave the town by the presence of armed cars. The tribesmen refused to comply with the order and exchanged shots with the police, but despite the use of machine guns by the latter casualties were re ported to have been limited to the death of one tribal representative. On the withdrawal of the armed cars to SAMAWA additional police were left behind to reinforce the SHINAFIYAH normal establishment. The successful termination of this incident was duly reported in the local press, but from subsequent reports received from sources of good reliability, it would appear that unduly optimistic inferences were drawn from this single instance of the government re establishing control in the disturbed tribal areas. Armed car patrols were instituted in the DAGHARAH and AFAJ districts and on the main BAGHDAD - BASRAH road between IMAM HAMZA, RUMAITHA and SAMAWA, but little attempt was made to re-establish control away from the main lines of communication, and in the majority of districts it would appear that police activities did not extend very far beyond the walls of the serai. Although the situation as far as the Middle EUPHRATES district was concerned showed definite signs of improvement, the Shi*a disturbances in the previous month had had one very definite and reactionary effect, and the question of the maintenance of law and order was now largely dependent on the good will of the shaikhs to whom the government had been more or less140. 141. 142. 145. Page 8. forced to delegate authority. A typical instance of this occurred in the HILLA Liwa where Umran al Hajji Badoun, one of the leading shaikhs of the Beni Kassan, objected to the presence of additional police posted to watch the river bund in his district and ordered their withdrawal. In the MUTTAPIQ, always a little slow to react to disturbances orig-unstirg in districts in closer touch with the BAGHDAD politicians, there was a similar gener al decrease in law and order. At both SUQ-ASH-SHUYUKH and SHATTRAH armed tribesmen entered and demonstrated in the bazaars in defiance of government orders. Most of the original trouble was caused by tribal rowdies from the Beni Malik in the SUQ district and by Abudah tribes men and secondary school students in the SHATTRAH area; in the early part of the month the demonstrators limited their activities to ’’hawassing' and a little desultory stone throwing at the police, but opposition to the government increased towards the middle of the month and at both QAL'AT SIKKAR and SHATTRAH, on the HAI River, government officials and police were compelled to with draw from certain tribal areas which they had entered in the normal performance of their duties. On 6th April a party of armed men of the Shurafat, Abudah and Asacharah tribes surrounded LU(}AIT station, stole a certain amount of merchandise and sub sequently endeavoured to tamper with the railway line between LUQAIT and JALIBAH. In this case, however, there was no question that theft was the main object of these tribal visitations and that the subsequent damage to the railway line was incidental; the gang dispersed hurriedly prior to the arrival of the police. On 16th April a somewhat more serious situation arose in the SUQ-ASH-SHUYUKH district where the Qaim- maqam and a small police escort proceeding towards CHABAISH by motor-launch were fired on by tribesmen from the Al Hassan. Although no casualties were reported on either side, the deterioration in government control in the MUNTAFIQ Liwa was considered sufficient to just ify the despatch of a flight of three aircraft of the R.I.A. F. to NASIRIYAH to drop warning messages on the tribes to the effect that punitive action would be taken in the event of further and continued disobedience of government orders. On 24th April there was a recrudescence of trouble in the DAGHARAH and RUMAITHA Qadhas; in the former Hajji Sallal, a shaikh of the Ghanim tribe in the f Aqra Confederation, refused to come in to Liwa Head quarters at DIWANIYAH when ordered to do so. His action was supported by other sectional leaders of the ’Aqra, all of whom had been loyal to the late government in tlx early days of Abdul Wahid’s anti-government activities in March, and tribal gatherings took place in defiance of government orders. At the end of the month the situation had shown no signs of improvement, and addition al police anA fti»ooj»o were again moved hurriedly into the DIWANIYAH Liwa.r 14:4 « 145, 146. 14?. 148, Page 9. MOSUL Liwa . The police have had some successes recently against contraband activities in the MOSUL Liwa. On 5th March they captured three bags of tobacco and a mule from smugglers at GELI HUDEIDAH Village (137 P/OT. 23.a) in the SHAIKHAN Qadha. During the first week in April smugglers from SHAIKH IBRAHIMvillage (137 L/SE. 14.d) were intercepted at GELI MESKI (137 L/NE. 12.c) in the DOHUK Qadha. Two of the smugglers, together with eight bags of tobacco and two mules, were captured and one mule was killed. On the night of 13th April smugglers were encountered in MOSUL town and after a struggle six bags of tobacco were seized. Also on 22nd March the AL QOSH police of the DOHUK Qadha raided a cave near BOZAN village (137 P/M, 20.li) and seized six villagers whom they found distilling araq. BARZAN Area . The police operations against Khalil Khoshawi and his followers are steadily progressing. The number of special villages to which the inhabitants of the area must move, as explained in paragraph 107 of last month* s Summary, has been increased to seventeen and the evacu ation of the remaining villages in the whole area is now being carried out. On 17th April the remainder of the 3rd Frontier Battalion (making a total of about 400 men) moved up from DIANA (where they were relieved by the 7th Infantry Bat talion) and are now occupying three police posts, and the 1st Frontier Battalion at BILLEH has taken over four police posts. (See paragraphs 100 and 106 of last month*s Summary). The police garrisons thus set free have joined the Police Striking Force. As both troops and police are now taking part in the operations, Zaim Ahmed Rashti, of the Eastern Military District, KIRKUK, has been placed in supreme command, with his headquarters at SHIRWAN-A-MAZIN (l D/NW, 3.a), and Abdulla Awni Beg (the Commandant of Police, MOSUL), who is Officer Commanding Police Striking Force, iS acting as his adviser. The rebels appear to have split toto three main groups, whose location, strength and fortunes are reported to be as follows. One group consisting of about 50 armed men under the leadership of Melko of ZAZHOK (1 D/NW. 10.c) a prominent Shirwan tribesman who joined Khalil Khoshawi in October 1934, went to the BIAU area (west of MERGASOR and east of the Greater ZAB River). As a result, however, of the police activity in burning and evacuating villages in this district (as described in paragraph 107), this group soon found great difficulty in obtaining supplies. Melko, with 25 followers (14 of whom were armed) therefore visited RAIZAN and requested Ulia Beg to arrange for their dakhalah with government. The 0.G. Police Striking Force agreed to accept their dakhalah provided that they handed over their rifles. Melko at first demurred, but later handed over the arms. It is understood that Ulia Beg is acting as guarantee for the good behaviour of Melko.Page 10. 149. 150. 151. 152. 153. 154. Another group, consisting of about 50 armed men under Ahmed Nadir, a prominent Shirwan tribesman of RAIZAN, who joined Khalil Khoshawi in June 1934, is in the MERGASOR area. They are believed to have been ob taining supplies through the help of Ahmed Agha of MERGASOR, who is a relation of Ahmed Nadir and has been living recently at SORAN (1 D/NW. 16.c). Ahmed Agha has now been ordered to move to GATOATU (1 D/NW. 10.c), one of the special police guarded villages (paragraph 107), and it is hoped that this group will also soon find it difficult to obtain supplies. However, an unconfirmed report from a source hostile to Paris Agha of ZIBAR states that Ahmed Nadir with 26 rebel followers has taken refuge with Paris Agha and has been settled in the Zibari tribal area without the knowledge of the authorities. The third group, consisting of 80 to 100 armed men under Khalil Khoshawi, hie brother Selim Khos hawi and Abdulla Girkhamo, a Shirwani, is located in the MASURI BALA area. On 29th March a detachment of ap proximately 50 men of the Police Striking Force encount ered a portion of this group in the vicinity of BIDYAR village (1 D/NW. 2.d). The casualties are reported to have been one policeman killed and six rebels killed and two rebels wounded, one of whom was captured. On 9th April a detachment of 30 men of the Police Striking Force was attacked, according to an official report, by a party of 70 rebels of the Khoshawi group, under Selim al Khoshawi, near BINDARO (l C/SW. 32. a). The police casualties were one regular and one irregular killed and one regular and one irregular wounded. One rebel was killed and some are said to have been wounded. Recently an encounter took place between a detachment of 20 men of the Police Striking Force and 50 Khoshawi rebels at DERI CHAL in the KANI RASH area (1 C/SW. 36.c). One regular policeman was killed and one wounded and two Baradosti irregulars were killed and one wounded. The rebel casualties are unknown. During the month altogether 14 more Khoshawi rebels and 2 Turkish Girdi tribesmen have individually surrendered to the authorities and one Khoshawi rebel is said to have surrendered to the Turkish troops on 24th April. A force of approximately 200 Oramar, Raikan and Herki (Aqra Division) tribesmen was recently en rolled as irregular police. The Raikan and Herki tribesmen were despatched to the GELI BALINDA area (137 0/SE. 35.c) with instructions to comb the area thoroughly, as it is believed that parties of Khoshawi rebels are in hiding in this area. The Oramar section under Siddiq Agha proceeded to BILLEH. Their arrival, however, displeased Faris Agha, who immediately with drew with his Zibari tribesmen from BILLEH and returned to HUKE (137 P/NE. 12.a). It is probable that Faris Agha resents the presence of the Oramar tribesmen at BILLEH because he has been continually endeavouring to increase his own influence in this area. The Herki (Aqra Division) section, under Saiyid Khan are reportedPage 11, 155 . 156. 157. 158. 159. 160 . to have later reconsidered their promise to assist the government forces and to have returned to their winter grazing grounds. families of the rebels, who were originally ^ 7 An t !t™^ e /' been the Turkish authorities to DIZAR GAiVAK (paragraph 111 of last month's Summary), are now reported to have toon moved by the rebels themselves vS te ff ltory at BERMISHKA (1 C/SE. 27. a. 28). ?t? a r;^ Tr ^ nos ^ wi s ov/n family were arrested at BIBANA i r Iraqi authorities and removed to AQKA m Larch 1934 (as reported in paragraph 91 of the Summary for April 1934). It is reported that Shaikh Ahmed of BARZAN. who was moved from MOSUL to NASIRIYAH on 12th November, v? ^ is bein S in touch with and encour aging Khalil Khoshawl and his bandits, is now to be permitted to move with his family to BAGHDAD. trv, u • T 5 e , ,Ira G i Government has informed Khalil Khoshawl and nis rebel following that they are prepared b0th to himself and to his followers. Khalil Khoshawi has furthermore been informed that his life will be spared. H is reply is not yet known. It l } remembered that Khalil Khoshawi was specifically excluded from the terms of surrender offered to the BARZAN leaders in 1932 and 1933, as he had murdered an Assyrian policeman who was a prisoner in his hands. SULAIMANI Liwa . Shaikh Muhammed pichkola with his gang, believec ab0 ^ 50 men , left the ALAN district of the SHAR ° n 23rd March &gt; Passed through QULQULA (2 E/m wvnlr °?Q 2 wL an oo 0n the night of 27th Marcb stayed at 7 2 E/NIV. 29.b - wrongly shown on the map as KANI % er L he Was Joined Hama Ali Rustam and also by Koikha Majid, who had escaped after his fight with the police at CHOLMAK FATTAH on 23rd March (as described in paragraph 92 of last month’s Summary), On 28th March they moved to SITAK (2 E/NE. 25.a) where Pichkola is re ported to have been at once visited by Shaikh Jalal. From SITAK Pichkola sent a message to villages ™ r l h ARBST (2 E/SE. l.d) demanding sum! varying f?om 10 to 15 Iraqi Dinars to be paid to him by each village as land tax. These villages lie in the area that was ' controiled and taxed by Pichkola on Shaikh Mahmud’s be half in October 1930 and which kept Hama Ali Rustam supplied during his activities in the Autumn of 1934. I'll® bandits were next reported to be moving i? area east of the AZMER (2 E/NW. 30. d) and the ^yiiyAN (2 E/NW. 24, a) Passes, usually in the neighbour hood of QAIWAN and SITAK, and on ^rd April they looted a caravan of twelve mules near BINAWELA (2 E/NE. 20.c). The police on sevoral occasions went out to catch them but were unable to find them.r 161, 162, 163, 164. Page 12. Reports have more recently been received that Shaikh Muhammed Pichkola has gone to QIZIL BUG (1 H/SW. 35,a), Hama Ali Rustam to QINDOL (l H/S¥. 35.c) and Koikha Majid to HANJIRA (l H/3W. 31. d) and then to KHOSHAW (l H/SW. 31. c), all being villages in the area controlled by the pizhdor Aghas and under the actual influence of Abbas-i-Mahmud Agha. If these reports are correct it would appear that the agreement come to ? (reported in paragraph 94 of the March Summary of Intelligence), by the leading pizhder Aghas to work in con-junction with one another and to give no assistance to the bandits has been broken. Unless the goverruient can find some means of enlisting the help of both of the leading Pizhder Aghas it seems improbable that the problem of banditry in the SULAIMANI Liwa will be solved in the near future. ARBIL Liwa . In view of the reported presence of the bandits in the Pizhder area, 45 policemen have been sent from KOI SANJAQ and RANIA to the neighbourhood of MIRZA RUSTUM (1 D/SE. 36.a) to catch any bandits who may cross the Lesser ZAB there. It is reported that on 10th April Abbas-i- Mahmud Agha sent his men to the BITWAIN Plain (1 D/SE. 24,c), where they stole 28 head of cattle. This is in consonance with Abbas-i-Mahmud's plan to embroil the Pizhders with the authorities and counteract Babekr Agha's policy of co-operation. POPULATION &amp; TRIBES. Entry of Syrian Sections of the Anaiza into ’IRAQ , A report of good reliability states that on 12th April approximately 1,000 tents of the Syrian Anaiza, mostly drawn from the Sba*a and Pada f an sections, crossed the 'Iraq-Syrian frontier into the MOSUL Liwa under the leadership of Shaikh Mujhim Ibn Muhaid. Shaikh Mujhim visited H,M. King Ghazi, whilst the latter was in camp at HATHA? and obtained permission from him to camp temporarily with the 'Iraqi Shammar, this request being supported by Shaikh Ajil al Yawwar, the paramount shaikh of the latter tribal confederation. It is understood that the grazing in the area north west of RUTBAH is not very good this year, but the fact that many of the Syrian bedouin shaikhs have quarrelled with the French authorities over the question of the Koda Tax may also account for the presence of so large a number of Syrian bedouins in 'Iraqi territory.SECTION II TURKEY* INTERNAL SECURITY* GIRDI Tribal Area (1 C/SW*) . The Turkish troops reported in paragraphs 101 and 104 of last month’s Summary have now 'been confirmed as amounting to approximately 300 men. It is 'believed that they belong to the 6th frontier Battalion at LIZA GAV/AR. On 12th March a Turkish soldier was killed between BEKHAN (l C/3^. 29.d.5.3.) and CHAMAN (l C/SW. 30 .C. 80 ) and the authorities are said to have burnt both these villages as reprisals. (Note: The names of the villages BALUTIA and CKAKAN have become trans posed on the map 1 C/3W; BALUTIA should be at 1 C/SW. 30.d., where CHAMAN is shown). A military post has been established at KALAIT (1 C/SW. 28. d).SECTION III IRAN, IRAN-4 IRAN-5 IRAN-6 IltyN-? IRAN-8, POLIT ICAL 1NTEMAL. F ronti er Policy. In March the Iranian authorities at 3ANEII (2 E/NE. 5.1)) were engaged in issuing between 300 and 400 rifles to the BANISH Begzadas and their followers. As no reason was given for this i ■rrae, some of the Begzadas have refused to accept tne rifles, thinking there is some trick behind it, either to make them fight or to obtain more money from them. POLITICAL - FOREIGN . Mirza Nasrullah Khan, an official of the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has been appointed Counsellor to the Iranian Legation in BAGHDAD in suc cession to the late Counsellor, Mansoor Khan, who died last month as a result of injuries received in a motor car accident in BAGHDAD. Mirza Nasrullah Khan is not a stranger to BAGHDAD as he held the same post some years ago. MILITAR Y FORCES. The Army . The organisation of the Army is at present given as the equivalent of two Divisions in KHORASAN, Eastern and Western AZERBAIJAN respectively, six Independent Brigades at SENNAH, KHURRAMA3AD, AHWAZ, SHIRAZ, KERMAN, KWASH and five Independent Composite Regiments at GURGAN, GUMBAD-I-KABUE, ISFAHAN, KEHMAN- SHAH and GILAN. The General Staff has planned a reorganisation scheme entailing extensive regrouping of the Independent formations in the centre, south and east of IRAN, but owing to difficulties with the tribes in KURDISTAN and BALUCHISTAN, they have not as yet been able to put this scheme into effect. The total strength of the Army according to the last authentic report was approximately 74,000, but this figure has been increased since then and the army may now be estimated as 80,000. Of this figure approximately 26,000 are located in the vicinity of IRAN* s Western frontier. It is believed that the Shah is aiming at a total peace strength of 100,000, and, at the present rate of increase, this figure would appear attainable in three or four years time. Conscription is working smoothly and extensively, though the govern ment has not felt itself sufficiently strong to attempt to impose it on many of the t •. ,es as yet.IKAN-9 The standard of training is difficult to assess, but it is probably better in the TEHRAN Garrison than in outlying districts, where it suffers much inter ruption from road protection duties and minor operations against bandits. In the TEHRAN Garrison, training off the barrack square is confined to weapon training and movements of units up to one battalion. 'Yeapon train ing is rarely carried out and it is estimated that not more than 10 rounds of ammunition per rifle are expended each year. Two brigades took part in the last manoeuvres in the TEHRAN area, but as no foreign observers v/ere allowed to be present it is impossible to form an estimate of their efficiency. IRAN-10. The allotment for the Ministry of War, which includes the Navy and Air Force votes, represents nearly 38.5$ of the total budget of the country, and during the year an additional 52,000,000 was voted for the purchase of war material. IRAN-11# The greatest secrecy is maintained about any new equipment, but it is believed that apart from the' purchase of new aircraft (paragraph PER-11 of the Summary of Intelligence for February refers), the bulk of expenditure has been devoted to Artillery, machine guns, CZEOHO—SLOVAKIAN rifles, with which the army is now being re-equipped, and armoured cars. A consider able quantity of machinery has been purchased for the ammunition factories at PARCHIN and TEHRAN, but no details of their capacity are available. IRAN-12. ^ The ancillary services have not kept pace with the expansion of the army and the number of mil itary mechanical transport vehicles is quite inadequate for important operations. With the great distances to be covered in the event of operations by the Iran Army outside the country’s frontiers, supply and transport would provide a very difficult problem. There are a considerable number of commercial lorries in the country, but .£o^commandeer them in order to improvise an effici ent service would be a very formidable task for staff officers quite inexperienced in the organisation and handling of a force of any size. In spite of the obvious disadvantages of increasing the size of the army and providing it with modern equipment at a cost out of all proportion to the country’s financial resources while the rank and file lack such essentials as boots and water bottles, the Shah’s policy seems to be successful. His aisi appar ently is not only to give the taxpayer some tangible return for his money, but to overawe the malcontents amongst his subjects and to instil a proper respect for IRAN amongst her neighbours. There is no doubt that the ’Iraqi has an exaggerated respect for the Iranian armed forces and that in war the latter would be far less formidable than is popularly believed.AIR FORGES. IRAN-14. ^ The difficulties experienced 'by the Iranian air force in moving aircraft from AHWAZ during the winter months were described in paragraph PER-8 of the February Summary of Intelligence and were emphasized by an incident which occurred at the end of March. Five Belgian instructors, while flying new aircraft from AHWAZ to r J..!HRAl encountered a severe stormy four gI* them decided to land and two of the aircraft were damaged; the fifth appears to have lost himself and eventually landed through shortage of petrol in a desert on the borders of KII0RA3AN, where he had a two days walk before being able to find a village.0A3-9. OAS-10, OAS-11. OAS-12. OAS-13. SECTION VII OTHER ARAB STATES. BAHREIN . The announcement at the beginning of April that the facilities enjoyed by the Royal Navy on QISHN and HENJAM Islands will in future be transferred to BAHREIN provides yet another reason for the importance which is row attached to this group of islands off the HASA Coast. The discovery of oil in 1931 resulted in a renewal of IRAN’S claim to possession of BAHREIN and a protest to the League of Nations against GREAT BRITAIN’s influence over its independent Arab ruler. As previ ously explained in this Intelligence Summary, this oil field, which is being exploited by an American Company, is a very valuable possession, since oil is within easy reach of tankers lying in a deep water anchorage and costs of production are so low. Difficulty has been experienced in finding markets owing to the agreement come to a few years ago between the big oil companies about the division of the world’s markets, but JAPAN seems to have come forward as a regular customer for BAHREIN oil. In 1932, the transfer of the British Air Route to the East from the Iranian to the Arab shore of the PERSIAN GULP was facilitated by the excellent land ing ground which existed on MUHARRAQ Island. This transfer was necessitated by difficulties with the Iranian authorities, due to intense nationalism inspired by the Shah and also to a genuine disappointment that none of the larger towns in IRAN were sefved by the route. In spite of the extra mileage and the long sea crossing involved by the use of the Arab coast route, it is most unlikely that the British line will revert to the IRAN Coast route and BAHREIN will probably be required as a refuelling station for civil aircraft for many years to come. For some years BAHREIN has been invaluable to the Royal Air Force as a refuelling station and tempor ary base for both land aircraft and flying boats oper ating in the PERSIAN GULF. Since the duties of the Royal Air Force in the Gulf are complementary to those of the Royal Navy and the two Services work in the closest co-operation, the move which has been arranged by the Admiralty has a great deal to recommend it. ABU MUSA . INDUSTRIES AND RESOURCES . In commenting in paragraph OAS-28 of the Summary of Intelligence for November 1934 it was stated that the concession/l5y the Shaikh of SHARJAH to the Golden Valley Ochre and Oxide Co’ ;any Limited to ex ploit the mineral deposits on ABU MUSA Island would probably result in a revival of IRAN's claim to ABU MUSA and TAMB Islands.@ r 0A3-14. On 7th March an Iranian launch visited ABU MUSA and its occupants informed Mr, Barnet, the repre sentative of the Company who was working on the island, that they were merchants on their way from DIBAI to LINGEH and asked whether they could he of any assistance. Mr. Barnet gave them a letter for despatch by air mail to his firm through Khan Sahib Hussain bin Hassan of SHARJAH. The letter was never received by Khan Sahib Hussain bin Hassan. OAS-15. On 14th March the captain of a local dhow, which had been hired by Mr. Barnet, proceeded to BANDAR ABBAS and there recognised the self-styled merchants as the Director of Customs and another inspector. OAS-16. TAME ISLAND. This island, which lies about midway between QI3HM Island and SHARJAH and belongs to the Juwassim Shaikhs of the Arab coast, has in the past been claimed by IRAN. In December 1934 a dhow from RAS AL KHAIMAH acting on the Shaikh’s orders, removed the flagstaff which flies his flag on the island. It was believed that this action had been taken by the shaikh at the instigation of IRAN, and in consequence a sloop has been retained in the vicinity of the island to prevent its occupation by IRAN. OAS-17. Subsequently, the Shaikh of RAS AL KHAIMAH was informed that if his flagstaff was not replaced within 10 days the Shaikh of SHARJAH&gt; who is the senior member of the Juwassim tribe, would be allowed to erect a flagstaff and fly his own flag on the island. The Shaikh of RAS AL KHAIMAH has, in consequence, informed the Resident, PERSIAN GULP, that he is replacing his own flagstaff.r SYR-l. SECTION IX - SYRIA . INTERNAL SECURITY, Murder of Farhan al Mashur . It is reported in the local press that Shaikh Farhan al Mashur of the Syrian Ruwalla was murdered ty the servants of Fawwaz ash Sha’alan, son of the paramount shaikh of the Ruwalla, at TADMUR early in March* Farhan al Mashur, who was a raider of some repute and figured prominently in the rebellion against Ibn Sa’ud during the period 1929 - 1930, had a somewhat romantic and chequered career. Brought up as a member of the shaikhly family of Nuri ash Sha'alan, Farhan went off as a young man to Ibn Sa’ud who received him cordially and offered him an estate near HAIL; Farhan was, however, unable to settle down to a life of ease and security and in 1928 caused a considerable amount of trouble by raiding caravans along the ’Iraq-Nejd frontier. His activities in this direction finally caused Ibn Sa’ud to withdraw his patronage and Farhan was classed as an ’’outlaw shaikh”. Early in 1929 he joined the late Faisal ad Darwish, the leader of the rebel party against Ibn Sa’ud, but managed to keep out of direct con tact with Ibn Sa’ud’s irregulars and, when the rebel stock slumped in November 1930, sought refuge in ’IRAQ where he surrendered to the government and was detained at BUSAIYAH Police Pest pending negotiations with Ibn Sa’ud. After his surrender to the ’IRAQ Government, Farhan almost ceased to exist as a personality and became a pawn in the complicated game in progress between the Nejdi and ’Iraq Governments relative to financial recompense for earlier raids. Ibn Sa’ud held that Farhan had allied himself with the rebels and should be expelled from ’IRAQ as a gesture of good faith; King Faisal held that such gestures were contrary to Arabian and kingly custom and Farhan, therefore, remained in the vicinity of the Palace. As the iDresence of Farhan in ’IRAQ tended to complicate negotiations between H«M. B. G. and Ibn Sa’ud pressure was brought to bear on the Palace and Farhan left for JEDDA via SYRIA, under an escort furnished by King Faisal; Farhan gave his escort the slip in DAMASCUS and took refuge with his old friends the Ruwalla. It would appear from intermittent reports received since 1931, during which period Farhan is stated to have been offered a commission in the Syrian Levies, that Fawwaz ash Shn’alan, also a gay young blade of the desert and acting as paramount shaikh of the Ruwalla, finally became jealous of Farhan’s friendship with his father and arranged for his ultimate elimination in the usual oriental fashion.

SECTION I HOME POLITIC Pi ;th of Grown Prince . The 'birth of the Crown Prince of ‘IRAQ was an- ;~c ■’.need in an official statement published on 2nd May, end all government offices were closed for three days and all public buildings decorated as a sign of general rejoicing on the i^art 0 f the populace. Apart from the fact that the advent of an heir has allowed direct succession of the Hashimite dynasty to the throne of ’IRAQ, there is no doubt that this happy event has also enhanced the popularity of King Ghazi among his subjects. The Arab, especially in the tribal areas, still cherishes old-fashioned ideas on the subject of the 'full quiver' and the knowledge that the King now has at least one arrow in reserve has quickened interest in the royal family and put an end to malicious rumours regarding regal impotence. 167. The young prince is to be called Faisal in memory of his grandfather, the late King of ’ IPAQ. il * Aeroplane Day in BAGHDAD . 168. The ceremony of naming the three Hawker air craft presented to the Royal ’Iraqi Air Force by the loyal inhabitants of the MOSUL, BASRAH and HILLA Liwas was performed at the BAGHDAD air port on the evening of 3rd May by Lis Majesty King Gh-uA. The occasion was also taken as an opportunity to show the general public the high standard of flying attained by pilots of the Royal ’Iraqi Air Force and to demonstrate the modern type of aircraft now in use, 169. The meeting was well attended and though the individual aerobatics, v/hich formed the final feature of the programme, were not up to European standard, the formation flying and other service manoeuvres were very creditable. A total of some 24 aircraft participated in the display, including the twelve new Pegasus-powered Hawkers. 170. In the evening a subscription dance was held at the air port and, as the evening advanced, the evolu tions of the dancers were quite in keeping with the aerobatics which they had witnessed earlier in the day. The profits from the dance are to be devoted to the ’Iraq Aeroplane Society to which King Ghazi had made an initial donation of I.D. 100 a few days previously. It seems quite possible that if there is no abatement in its efforts the society may be able to purchase an air craft in about ten years' time. 171. A further example of how air minded ’IRAQ is becoming was afforded by a statement in the local press that one per cent of the pay of his men is to be deduct ed by the Director-General of Police each month until I.D. 5,000 has been collected to purchase an aeroplane for the Royal 'Iraqi Air Force. It is believed that the proposal has not b^cn greet.! by the rank and file with any great enthusiasm.Page 2. 172. 173. 174. Gove rnment A ?_t 1 on in DIWANIY A TT and MUI TTAl' IQ Li was . Although the situation was still delicate it appeared at the beginning of Hay that Yassin Pasha al Kashimi and his coup. The Cubm. the inability o paign of civil G. Gailani, the new •. cabinet had brought off a successful t, vr.lch had come into power through us p.edecessor to deal with the cam- obeclence, instigated by Rashid Ali ^ni.ster of the Interior, undoubtedly with Yassin’s approval, had to face the difficulty pro vided by the demands drawn up by the religious leaders on behalf of the Shi’a community. The presentation of these demands, some of which were rather awkward, might have seriously embarrassed the new cabinet if the de mands had the authority of the whole Shi’a community, but Abdul Wahid al Haiji Siklcar, leader of the disobed ience campaign, had throughout been in close touch with the new ministers and the latter had little difficulty in persuading him not to authorise the religious leaders to present demands on his behalf. Thus a Gilbertian situation was created in that the leader of the campaign for the redress of Shi’a grievances was the chief ob stacle in preventing those grievances being submitted. Although Abdul Wahid’s attitude d.-d alienate a number of his adherents, his refusal to authorise the presentation of the demands by the religious leaders robbed them of a great deal of their weight. Another difficulty was provided by a number of tribal leaders who had been loyal to the previous gov ernment and in consequence were hostile to the new one; they were hostile to Abdul Wahid and advocated punish ment for his misdeeds and were insistent that the de mands of the religious leaders should be put forward and must be complied with by the government. A number of these leaders, however, came to BAGHDAD at the end of April, and, after a sonie.,hat unsatisfactory meeting at tended by Ali Jawdat and Jamil Haifa’i, the two previous Prime Ministers, were interviewed by Yassin and Rashid Ali, who assured them that the cabinet intended to re dress the Shi’a grievances as soon as possible. Much to the annoyance of the ministers, the tribal leaders let it be understood quite clearly that they had little faith in these promises, but would allow a period to elapse in which the Shi’a demands might be presented and that their future attitude would depend upon the government’s action. There is no doubt that this decision had an important effect in preventing the spread to other dis tricts of the disorder which broke out at RUMAITHA, as described in paragraph 183 et seq. Reports were re ceived on the evening of 7th May that rioting had broken out at RUMAITHA and that the railway line had been inter rupted. The Minister of the Interior was despatched to DIWANIYAII the x'ollowing day to represent the government on the spot and was later joined there by the Minister of Defence, and it was at once evident that tho govern ment intended to take drastic action to suppress the revolt.f Page 3. 176. 177. 178. 179 . Steps were taken to concentrate a very strong force at DIY/ANIYAH, and General Bekr Sidqi, who had ac- riired a reputation in the Assyrian troubles of 1933, v.ac placed in coinnand. Martial law was proclaimed in RUMAITHA 'Td the surrounding district, axil, as commander- in-chief, ^o.kr Sidqi was given supreme command over all administrative affairs in the district concerned. A military tribunal was set up comprising a president, two members who were J ; d e military officers and two judges, and it was s-r uj.x t t th.e death penalty would be in flicted on any peri n found to have borne arms against the government or its forces and that those found guilty of cutting communications would be liable to the same penalty. The danger which the government had to face was not so much from the original outbreak at RUMAITIIA as that it would spread to others of the tribes, such as the Aqra Confederation round DAGHAPAH, the Fatlah south of KUFAH and the Albu Sultan between HILLA and DIV/aITIYAH, and reports were received thau the leaders in these dis tricts, who were known to be hostile to the present gov ernment, had announced their intention of joining the revolt as soon as the government forces opened fire on the rebels. In spite of this, bombing operations were started by the Royal f Iraqi Air Force on 11th May after 84 hours preliminary warning, and it is probable that a general conflagration was averted partly by the premises to the tribal leaders referred vs in paragraph 173 above, but chiefly through the government’s prompt action in concentrating a very strong force to quell the disorder and by its issue of a warning that ruthless punishment would be meted out to anyone who became implicated. it is believed that Bekr Sidqi extended this warning to tho religious leaders of NAJAF and it may have accounted for the fact that they failed to seize the opportunity which had at last arisen for the Chi’a community to try to throw over the domination of a Sunni government. A severe dust storm followed by exceedingly heavy rain on 12th May interrupted the bombing operations and delayed the advance of the troops, but the column was^ able to advance from DIWANIYAH on 14th May and oc cupied RUMAITHA on 17th, having encountered very little opposition. A complication which for a time looked as though it might have serious consequences was the out break of disorder amongst the MUNTAFIQ tribes as des cribed in paragraph 190. The chief danger in this area was the decision come to by the powerful tribal leaders in the SHATTRAH district to prevent the arrival of rein forcements which had been sent from BAGHDAD to NASIRIYA via KUT. The Minister of Defence flew to NASIRIYA on 16th May accompanied by one of the British advisers to the ’Iraq government, and there was able to negotiate with the tribal leaders so that the reinforcements were able to reach NASIRIYA that evening without opposition. By 21st May the railway lines had been re stored from BAGHDAD to 3AMAWA and the train services be tween BASRAH and BAGHDAD were in operation a couple of days later.130. 181. 182. 133. 184 . Page 4. The Prime Minister, upon two occasions after the trouble had spread to the MUIWAPIQ, made requests that British aircraft might help him to suppress the trouble, and was most displeased when the requests had to be refused and it was explained to him that interven tion by tne Hoyal Ain Force could not be permitted with out the sanction of the British government. As it out, the government of turned capab:'• of quelling the revolt a doubtealy increased the prestige throughout the country. Tribal expressed the opinion that their __ wuu be more than a match for the government’s forces and this bubble has been pricked by the successful opera tions in the RUMAITIIA district and should provide a -^ood omen for the future maintenance of law and order. ’IBAB proved itself quite aided, and this has un- of the ’Iraq army leaders have frequently armed tribesmen would The surprising fe-oure of this revolt is the ease with which it was quelled, the lack of any roal co hesion amongst the Shi’a community and the absence of direction by the religious leaders in a time of stress. It would be unwise to prophecy that the government will experience no more trouble from the Shi’a community, for it still has to overcome the problem of the elections, which are due to take place in the near future. Difficulty about the elections is also likely to be experienced in KUHDISTAM, where, since the in- tiiguos between certain members of the present govern ment and Kurdish tribal chieftains, described in para graph 118 of the April Summary, there has been a marked .iftc^ease in political activity. a deputation of Kurd- ioil chiefs arrive a. in BA31 IT) AD on 18th May to interview the Prime Minister regarding the arrangements in KUPJD- I ST AIT for the forthcoming elections, and, although the result of this interview is not known, it is believed that the system by which a number of Kurdish districts have in the past been represented by Baghdadi effendis will no longer be tolerated. Shi ’a Disturbances In the Middle EUPHRATES Area . In continuation of paragraph 143 of the April Summary of Intelligence. Although the somewhat danger ous situation created by the refusal of Kajoi Sallal,’ tne leading shaikh of the Ghanim tribe, to obey govern ment orders and report to Liwa Headquarters at DIWA1TIYAH passed^ off without incident and Sallal ultimately signi fied his readiness to comply with government demands, both DAGHARAH and RUMAITKA remained in a very disturbed condition. The tribal community in these areas contin ued to 'harass” at the slightest provocation, and re ports stated that, despite the presence of additional police, armed men patrolled the bazaars in defiance of government orders. Since Abdul Wahid al Hajji Sikkar had elected to divorce himself from the pro-Shi’a element and had shown himself as one of Yassin Pasha’s symeophants and an aspirant for future political honours, the storm cen tre had slowly shifted from the Fatlah and associated tribal groups in the MISHIfAB; had wavered for a periodf Page 5. around the DAG-IIARAH and APAJ areas, where Sha’alan al Atigah was hesitating over the c '/mtion of v/hich party to join and where there were plenty of minor land cases to hoep the pot boiling; and then moved south to the foid-riddled area round RUIUITIIA. 135. Here political issues were speedily lost sight ^1' and the movement became open to exploitation by indiv iduals with axes to grind or internecine quarrels to settle. A private land squabble between Khawwam al Abdul Abbas of the Bani Zuraij and other sectional lead ers had already occasioned considerable tribal excitement in the RUMAITHA Qadha, but it was left to the government to supply the final spark which kindled the tribal com munity into open revolt. IQS- It had been reported at the end of April that lluhammed Hussain Kashif al G-hata had sent messengers to the various tribal leaders exhorting them to beware of the political traps laid for them in BAGHDAD and to re member that they were members of the Shi’a community and fighting a battle - albeit a bloodless one - for the Shi’a cause. Amongst the various people rounded up by Kashif al Ghata to preach this doctrine of Shi’a solid arity was a Persian Alim (a naturalised f lr;vi) named Shaikh Ahmed al Shaikh Kahli al Asaudulah; this man was a resident in RULIAITHA town and, as his influence amongst the tribes was considerable and his advice not in accord ance v/ith the interests of the government or the preser vation of law and order, the Ministry of Interior issued orders for his arrest on 7th May. This somewhat ill- advised action on the part of the government gave the tribes the opportunity they had be m waiting for and, though Shaikh Ahmed was duly ur-ested and sent to BAGHDAD by train, Shaikh Khawwam, who was in the bad books of the government anyway, elected on religious grounds to cham pion the cause of the arrested Alim. In this he was backed up by certain sections of the Bani Huchaim confed eration and, aided by them, opened the first phase of a serious anti-government movement by cutting the railway line between RUMAITHA and ABU TABBIKH stations. This act of sabotage was quickly followed by -uhe looting of RUMAITHA station, the destruction of the railway bridge over a subsidiary branch of the HILDA Channel, and a series of not very successful attacks on the fortified police post at HACHAMAH and the Serai at RUMAITHA. 187. News of the disturbances was received in BAGH DAD in the form of an alarmist telegram from the station master at RUMAITHA on the evening of 7th May; on the following evening a press communique was published by the Ministry of Interior giving a brief description of events that had already taken place and stating that Rashid Ali, the Minister of Interior, had proceeded to DIWANIYAH to study the situation at first hand and to arrange punitive measures. In the meantime the move ments of troops and aircraft into the DIWANIYAH Liwa, as detailed in paragraph 197 et seq, had been ordered and arrangements were also in hand for the subsequent des patch of a mobile column into the RUMAITHA Qadha.Page 6. 188. 189. 190. 191. 192. Phe cutting ol‘ telephone and telegraphic com munication hy the rebels mule it impossible to^obtain any detailed inPormation op -.hat was taking place in the mam area of unrest, and even in DIWANIYAH the authorities were compelled to rely largely on local gossip or reports from people who had passed through the disturbed area as rapidly as possible. by the evening of the 8th, however, hl T 4 ?m TI 4 e ih ll i ely established that the railway station at ha ^ been looted and burnt, that the bazaar had oUlfe- „. a l--ce ate, that the ro .d south of PUi.lAIlIIA had co e l 1 h 00 sh a ^- that the i® 11 - in the Serai were sur- rounded and holding out with difficulty. ,, ^ Although a large measure of success attended the rebels m their initial move against the government, iieie was a very definite reluctance on the part of the tribes in areas removed from the RUMAITHA district to associate themselves with the movement. it is possible tnat uhe shooting down of a R.A.F. aircraft, as described in paragraph 208 may have had something to do with this decision^on the part of the more influential shaikhs to remain aioof from the disturbances, especially as it is known that mawwam appealed fer assistance to the Albu Suitan and pointed out that the railroad was particularly vulnerable in the HiLLA Liwa, where it runs through Albu Sultan territory. ^ Beuwcen the 8th and 11th May active opposition to the government was confined to the RU]-IAITHA area but mtiwtawt® lmo , st inevitable that it would spread to MUNTAFIQ, where, m the SUQ ASH SHUYUIHI area adjacent to tne marshes, government control has always been weak and • x' 1 ?^ 1 ''? overiimen ^ ^ov^ent irrespective of partv or politics is sure of a sympathetic reception. on 12th May news was received^in BAGHDAD that certain sections of the Beni Malik tribes, including the Hassan and Hacham, had taken advantage of the general atmosphere of Un ^ 6 f^ t0 ?. aclc tiie SO^^^riment serai at SUQ ASH SHUYUKH and the police posts at AI'LA.IICAH and KHAMI3IYAH. The fact that in both SUQ ASH SHUYUKH and KHAMISIYAH there are a certain number of ex-Nejdi subjects of the Sunni persuasion may have afforded a motive on religious grounds for the ^ original, outbreak, but it is more proba- '^ ;le P riIIlar y objective was loot, especially in tne form of rifles and ammunition easily obtainable from so well known a mart as KHAMISIYAH. Such news as could be obtained on 13th and 14th May was anything but reassuring, for though the police m SUQ ASM SHUYUKH, who had withdrawn from the Serai to a school, were still holding out, all outlying police posts had been captured by the tribesmen and the ex-Nejdi subjects were receiving rough treatment at the hands of the victorious Shi*as. The Hussainat on the right bank of the EUPHRATES had joined the rebels and the railway officials from UR to GHUBAISKIYA were in a state bordering on panic and arrangements were made to evacuate them. On 15th Mar the Mutasarrif reported that NASIRIYA, headquarters of the MUUTAFIQ Liwa, which had so^far been immune from attack, was surrounded by hostile tribesmen, and he asked for permission to enter intoPage 7. negotiations with the shaikhs of the Akudah and Khafajah trikes to secure the release of the government officials and police from 3UQ ASH SHUYUI\H. Wiese shaikhs, whose trikes occupy lands on the GhAHPAP in the neighkourhood of SIIAT'flhfl, had no direct influence over the rekels, kut their prestige was such that if it became known that they ” T ere the hr influent ■ on lam o; government . . v ju X ±*.+1 W x X i- 1 7 '^ S sure to have a steadying influence on the less im- pwrcant tribal leaders round NAGIPIYA and elsewhere in the :.IUI7JAPIQ. 195 * government agreed to the Mutasarrif r s re quest, kut a critical situation was disclosed when hiayyoun al Ukaid and Saqkan al Ali, rep esenting the Akudah_ and hi h.jah tribal g-oups respectively, announced tneir intention of offering resistance to any armed forces which might be despatched to the NA3IHIYA dis trict down the GrtAP^A.?, and it was learned that the Snaikhs of T he v ; Hu^sainat and AzairiJ rourvi NAS- j-Rt YA had deoidcii bo i r. low tixeir exaui^le, ‘This wa.s serious^news, for t:*o^ps were already on their way and ary re si s t c ice o f f er :3 d * h y Khayy oun, who had al way s pre viously keen loyal to .the government, even during the 11oO rebellion, would probably have induced a number of • leaders who were still wavering to throw in their lot against the government, not only in the HUNTAPIQ kut throughout Southern ’IHIQ. To deal with this situation, the Minister of Defence, accompanied by a British adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, paid a visit by air to NASIRIYA on the morning of 16th May to interview the SHATTRAH shaikhs, and the conference was joined later by the leaders of the trikes round NASIRIYA# da’afar Pasha appealed to the shaikhs on sentimental and nationalist grounds and succeeded in persuading them not to attempt to prevent the arrival of the troops, kut t- use their influence to restore law and order as non ac possible. The tribal ' leaders gave an undertaking to this effect, but made certain stipulations; the government must at once open negotiations with Muh amine d Hussain Kashif al Ghat a, no troops other than those already on their way must be sent to NASIRIYA, and no punitive operations were to be under taken against the SUQ ASH SIIUYUKH tribes. These terms were agreed to, and in consequence the lading troops reached NASIRIYA that afternoon and the safety of the town was assured. The tribesmen round NASIRIYA, however, were badly out of hand and their shaikhs have little real in fluence, so that for a day or two acts hostile to the government continued to be committed. The cutting of bunds damaged the road and railway betv/een NASIRIYA and UR Junction, where the railway station was looted and burnt; the floods also extended over the low lyina* area between UR and TELL AL LAHM railway station. But'grad- ually the influence of the shaikhs made itself felt and with the organisation of a force of mounted tribesmen by Yusuf al Mansur as Sa f doun who patrolled the railway from UR Junction to the southeast, it became possible to resume through traffic on the railway between BASRAH and BAGHDAD on 23rd I'ey.Page 8, 196. 197. 198. 199. The government officials and police, who had teen captured by the rebels in the SUQ ASH SHUYUKII area, e‘e surrendered, but the situation there continued to thoroughly unsatisfactory and there was no indication tuat law and order was being restored. There is no recognise^ cuaiuh with any control over the smaller and lawless tribal sections who inhabit the north western snores of the IIAMKAR LAKh who were consistently hostile to any form of government control during the period of the ^mandate, and the trouble spread eastwards to CHAB- ui-i-b.i, where the aj.nuStrative offices were evacuated by t S e 4 . 1 governinent oi&gt;fioia: fs. Owing to the flooded nature ^country, operations on the ground were exceedingly diiiicult and in consequence armed motor boats were sent from BASRilH to CHABAISH to restore the situation there, and up to the end of the month bombing operations were being continued in the neighbourhood of SUQ ASH SHUYUKH. jlraq Army -- Movements and Operations . ™ ^ The situation which arose at RUMAITHA involved considerable troop movements throughout ’IPAQ vrhich vrere W1 ^ h commendab le promptness. The battalion at BASRAH was despatched forthwith to SAM«1WA to guard the important railway bridges north of the tov/r and a com- pany was moved down from BAGHDAD to take its place. By 13th hay a force composed as follows had been concen trated at DI7AHIYAH: - Two batteries artillery. Six battalions of infantry (less 1 company). An armoured car section, some motor machine guns and an ambulance section. Further troop movements were necessitated when the trouble spread to the MUHTAFIQ, since although the police in that area had been strongly reinforced^soire weeks earlier owing to the state of unrest in the dis trict, the only troops available were two platoons of the motor machine gun company at NASIRIYA. The 4th battalion, which had been moved from SULAIMANI to BAGHDAD, was despatched to NASIRIYA via KUT in motor C les . 0n and was followed by the 8th battalion, which had been moved down from MOSUL, and it was aceom- panied by a section of 2*75 guns. In spite of consider able difficulty dee to bad roads, caused by an exceedingly heavy fall of rain, one battalion reached NASIRIYA on the afternoon of 16th May and the second on 17th; the situ ation was restored and the rapid move must be considered a very creditable achievement. The rain also affected the forward movement of troops from DIWANIYAH,-but by 14th May a force under A1 Zaim Hamid Shalji, known as Shalji Column, had been concentrated at IMAM HAMZA, composed as under:- One cavalry regiment. One mountain battery. Pour battalions infantry.■■HMi 200 . 201 . 202 . 203. 204 , Page 9. This force advanced along the left bank of the HILLA branch of the EUPHRATES through the country of the Beni Zuraij, whose leader, IQiawwam, had started the rebellion. A second column under moved to III il ILTIZA to form a re and comprised; - Iqid Jamil Pahmi was also crve to Shalji Cokomn 1 section field artillery. 1 battalion infantry. Motor Machine Gun Company (less 2 platoons). 200 police. As far as can be gathered from the meagre reports which were available, this so-called reserve column advanced along the right bank of the river more or less in line with Shalji Column on the opposite bank, and, if either column had met with a reverse, some time would have had to elapse before it could be reinforced. Moreover, it will he noted that, although one battalion had been left at HILLA, very few troops were available to protect the lino of communications in spite of the fact that it ap peared highly probable that tribesmen would interfere with the railway line between LIVANIYAH and HILLA, and there was great possibility of a move by the tribesmen round AFAJ against LIY/ANIY..JI, which was being used as an advanced base by the Royal ’Iraqi Air Force. However, the operations proved highly success ful; the advance was very deliberate and only slight opposition was encountered. On 15th May the cavalry regiment had a brush with some mounted tribesmen, which it dispersed, and captured some rising ground near the river bank, from which the column came under fire. On the following day a defensive post which had been im provised by the tribesmen was demolished by artillery fire and a party of tribesmen wl &gt; had remained in con cealment with a vie?/ to attacking the transport after the column had passed came under heavy fire of machine guns which had been posted for the purpose and suffered severe casualties. By the evening of 16th May the troops had ad vanced to within striking distance of RUMAITHA, but the town was not attacked since Khawwam, leader of the rebels, had been captured, and shaikhs of the Dhuwalim and other tribes had notified their intention of making submission. A truce v/as arranged until noon of the following day, when RUMAITHA was occupied without op position and the work of repairing the railway and tele phone communications was put in hand forthwith. The railway was in operation from BAGHDAD to UR Junction by 23rd May and Shalji Column was then moved down there to deal with the rebels in the SUQ ASH SHUYUKH area, but considerable difficulty was experienced owing to the flooded state of the country and the rebels v/ere still in occupation of the town up till the end of the month. Good use was made of the Royal ’Iraqi Air Force during these operations. Warning leaflets were dropped in the RIDLAITHA area on the evening of the 9th May and bombing was started on the 11th andcontinued on the morning of the 12th, v/hen it was interrupted byr 205. 206. 207. 208 , Page 10. the severe lust storm which later changed to heavy rain a nd put out of action the rm’-TIYAH landing ground, from which the aircraft were operating. When the trouble developed in the MU1ITAFIQ, aircraft were used to'deliver fSS P Q^ T S£ a^ur.ition to the police in NA3IHIYA and SUQ Aoji S..JYUiJI, and uO tomb tnc latter, where the police and a portion of the inhabitants, who are Sunnis, were teing attacked by Shi'a tribesmen. Bomb raids were also continued in the RUMAI'i’IIA district until the army's oper ations there ceased and aircraft were used by ministers to visit both DIUTANIYAK and NASI HI YA during the disturbances. . , difficult to estimate the actual results o amed during the bomb raids, since no written reports were rendered, and the verbal reports of the pilots were obviously unduly optimistic. One feature of the early raids was the large proportion of bombs which failed to release, but this was not surprising when, it was discov ered that some of the aircraft had been bombed up with the bomb release controls shill tied round a member of he wing m the same state that the aircraft had left the makers. I everv nla-h + hhv ' 7hole ^ p°Y al 'Iraqi Air Force had every right to be p .eased with itself; a erreat de^n nf* -offe n of W tb d °-‘?’+ 0ften U h er difficult conditions''and f the -w h llot .f v ' J b ln the alr for eighi hours during full-/ -beeb tb h h aircraft in such a situation was hbh the Ira( li government, for not only nf &gt; t u. tj tmo mnister request assistance from aircraft b y 1 Air Force upon two occasions, but he made enquiries as to now long it would take him to get more aircraft from ENGLAND if an order were placed by signal.

Loss of Hoyal Air Force Aircraft . - i - n oi the report that the railway line had been tampered with near RUMAITHA and the difficulty of obtaining authentic news, a flight of No. 55 (b) Squadron was sent to reconnoitre on 8th May. One of the aircraft, which had remained behind to take photo graphs in the RUMAITKA area, failed to return and was later reported to have been brought down by rifle fire and its two occupants killed.Page 11. SO 9. 210 . 211 . 212 . Some difficulty was experienced in recovering the bodies, but they were eventually sent in to DIWA1TIY/H by Shaikh Khawwam, who expressed sincere regret and em phasized that the shots had been fired without authority and by tribesmen who were under the erroneous impression that trey were about to be attached. No eye witness has been found who can give an accurate story of the accident and the postmortem examination was difficult, but it seems probable that the pilot was killed by rifle fire and his passenger was killed in the crash. The aircraft was subsequently set on fire by the tribesmen. Assyrian Situat ion. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Nuri Pasha as Sa*id, and the Minister of Justice, Muhammed Zaki Beg, who left BAGHDAD on 4th May to attend the League of Nations discussions on the IRAN-'IRAQ frontier question, stopped at BEYROUTH for three days to discuss with the French High Commissioner for SYRIA, M. de Martel, the question of settling the Assyrians in SYRIA. The members of the League of Nations for the Settlement of the Assy rians also attended the three meetings which were held. Syrian newspapers report that Nuri Pasha con firmed that the 'Iraqi Government is prepared to meet the cost of transporting the Assyrians from 'IRAQ to SYRIA* but asked that the following points should be observed in the settlement:- (a) That the Assyrians be settled at a distance of at least 50 km. from the 'Iraqi frontier, (b) That these refugees must be completely disarmed, and (c) That Assyrian refugees in SYRIA should not be subject to the International Rules for minorities, nor should they constitute an obstacle preventing or impeding the political liberation of SYRIA. The following points were also discussed;- (a) The immigrants to be given the freedom to sell all their movable properties in ’IRAQ within a fixed area and time, (b) Their immovable properties to be either estimated in bulk and their price paid to the French authorities to use for the purchase of properties for them in SYRIA, or to be sold by the immigrants themselves within a given time, and (c) The drawing up of plans for the transportation of the immigrants from 'IRAQ and the fixing of dates for it. It is understood that the French had put for ward two alternative schemes. The first was to extend the existing Assyrian settlements on the KHABUR River which would only accommodate a limited number, but would be comparatively inexpensive and could be put intoM mmmm 213. 214. 215. 216. 217. Page 12. cperatieii almost immediately. The second and far more ambitious scheme was to reclaim a considerable area of undeveloped land in the Oroi.jTES Valley of western SYRIA {opposite L.AViXIA), which would be sufficiently large to accommodate the whole of the Assyrian nation, but this would be a far more expensive undertalcing, and would tahe a great deal longer. £t is learned from Syrian newspapers that the Syrian deputies for the EUPHRATES and JAZIRA districts have made protests to the Secretary of the League of Nations, through the High Commissioner for SYRIA, against the reported decision to have part of the Assyrians set tled in their districts. The Turkish authorities are ha y e informed the League of Nations of their wish that the place of the Assyrian settlement should be at least loO miles from the Turkish frentier. u r •*-, Th ^ league of Nations Commission, consisting of M. Lopez Olivan (Spanish), M. Manuel Arocha (Vene- zuelan), M. Henri Quend (Swiss), M. Guillaume Penen and Major Thomson, arrived in BAGHDAD on iitn May. On 16th May, accompanied by Yusuf Beg al . n; Vrepresenting the f Iraqi Ministry for Foreign ^£i T a i rS ^ they left BAGHDAD and on 17th May arrived at MOSUL, where they were joined by Major Wilson, the local member of the Commission. • • +. 18th May, the League of Nations Commission certa in Assyrian villages in the SHAIKHAN Qadha, and interrogated the Assyrian inhabitants as to the number of families and souls in each village; whether they were in possession of sheep and goats; whether they were cultivating; and their attitude towards emigration to SYRIA. The Mar Shimun elements voted en masse for SYRIA and the majority of the rank and file of the Khosh- aba faction (whose leaders were in MOSUL Town - see para graph 216 below) stated that they would vote for Syrian emigration in the event of the ’’Assyrian nation” ex pressing the desire if emigrating to SYRIA. On 19th May the Commission interviewed the leaders of the Mar Shimun and the Khoshaba factions at the Railway Rest House, MOSUL. The leaders of the Mar Shimun faction definitely informed the Commission that they themselves and all Marshimunites wished to emigrate to SYRIA. The leaders of the Khoshaba faction informed the Commission that before they came to a final decision as to whether their faction would emigrate to SYRIA or remain in ’IRAQ they would require further information regarding the economic conditions, suitability of climate, and security in the proposed area of settlement in SYRIA? and that they would also have to consult the rank and file of their faction. After the interview they drew up a petition embodying these points which they handed to M. Olivan on 20th May. On 2Cth May the League of Nations Commission visited certain Assyrian villages in the DOHUK Qadha, where they asked the same questions and received the same answers as in the SHAIKHAN Qadha (see paragraph 215 above).J r Page 13. 0^0 On 21st May the Commission left MOSUL on their return journey to BAGHDAD. It is believed that from its visit to the north the Commission gained the im pression that once an emigration scheme had been started a most all the Assyrians would decide to leave ’IRAQ and that the 0ROUTES Valley scheme was therefore by far the better. Unfortunately, although the Commission ch ained from the Iraqi Government a promise to contri bute quite a handsome sum towards the cost of the emi gration, and the French also promised a contribution if the ORONTES scheme were adopted, these two sums would ? fi rV on V the total cost of the sch eme and the Commission had no definite information to what extent or irom what sources other funds would be forth coming. The Commission therefore did not feel justified in coming to any decision or to put in hand any arrange ments for emigration to start in the near future, and has returned to EUROPE to try to overcome the very con- siderable financial difficulties. tt is understood tnat, when some decision has been arrived at, M. Henri t^ n l ( r iS3) ^ ! f^ or Thomson, and Major Wilson are to be the members of the Commission who will carry out in ’IR^Q the preliminaries for the settlement. M POLITICAL - FOREIGN. 219. /. IRAQ^IRAN Frontier . „ The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Nuri Pashq. as Sa id, accompanied by the Minister of Justice, Muhamined 2aki Beg, left BAGHDAD for DAMASCUS on 4th May, in two Royal Iraqi Air Force aircraft, on their way to GEHEVA to take part in the League of Nations discussion on the frontier question between ’IRAQ and IRAN, and arrived at GENEVA on 18th May. 220 * Direct negotiations took place between the representatives of both countries and further discussion of the question has now been adjourned to the September meeting of the League of Nations Council. INTERNAL SECURITY. 221 . Kurdish Nationalism . There has been considerable coming and going in the KIRKUK, SULAIMANI and ARBIL Liwas recently on the part of two minor tribal leaders of the KIFRI area They have been visiting most of the tribal chiefs (ex cluding the Pizhder) in these Liwas in an attempt to ob tain their signatures to a document embodying the following points:- (i) A promise to remain in the ’Iraqi unity,Page 14, r 222 . 223* 224. mm (ii; Loyalty to the ’Iraqi Crown of the Hashimite Dynasty, and Deience of the rights of every Kurd, individ ually or in general, and an endeavour to ob tain Kurdish officials for Government posts in the Kurdish areas. 4.4 , • I ^ is not l3elievecl that many of the more influ- ent ^ 1 ^ C ^ efs have been P er&gt; suaded to sign the document ?L t + Qt v the m0V f r ? nt is of a ry real significance among the tribes. it is probable that the whole affair has been instigated by the government itself with a view to Keeping under its own direction and control, especially w&gt;y+ R ?K+? Period of unrest in the Middle EUPHRATES area, what little Kurdish national feeling may still exist. It is noteworthy that the movement has not extended to the MOSUL Liwa, where (except for the operations in the BAR2AN area of the ZIBAR Qadha) the government adminis- ration is well established, there is a large non-Kurdish population, and Kurdish nationalism is dormant in the absence of any influential tribal chief. It is reported that about a dozen of the minor triba! leaders in the KIRKUK Liwa who took the clause about Kurdish officials too seriously have been called to BAGHDAD to cool their ardour. They are reported to have visited Shaikh Mahmud while in BAGHDAD, but the latter s deportation to NASIRIYA in 1931 and his subse quent stay under government supervision in BAGHDAD is thought to have made him pro-government and to have cured him of any desire w to go on his travels again”. Kurdish nationalism is no longer a serious threat to the government from the tribes or even pract ical politics for the chiefs. Kurdish nationalism was really a racial movement against the Pan-Turanians, pan- Arabs and Pan-Iranians. However, the Residence Law in iURKSY and the action of the Iranian government against the Kurds in IRAN have broken the power of the tribal chiefs in those areas and destroyed any hope the Kurds m IRAQ may have had of organised help from their fel low Kurds across the borders. The tribal organisation of the Kurds is paoriarchal land inter—tribal cohesion is poor on account of blood feuds, land disputes and rival ry of the chiefs. Further, the establishment of gov ernment administration and the policy of settling the semi—nomadic tribes on the land is rapidly destroying the patriarchal organisation and breaking down cohesion in the tribe itself, which in most areas now only lingers on in custom and tradition. The Kurds, who are super stitious and liable to be fanatical in their religion, are more easily roused by a leader whom they consider to be of particular religious sanctity. Under such a leader several tribes even are willing to combine (e.g. the ”Diwana” Confederation of the Mazuri-Bala, Shirwan, and Barzan tribes under Shaikh Ahmed of BARZAN). But since the power of the two really influential leaders (Shaikh Ahmed of BARZAN and Shaikh Mahmud) has been broken, there are no longer any leaders of sufficient importance to act as centres of t jcus for Kurdish nation alism in 'IRAQ. As.it is es'clnated that the number of Kurds in Northern ’IRAQ is about 500,000, and that they are intermingled with another 500,000 consisting ofr 225. 226. 227. Page 15. Jewc, Chaldeans, Yezidies and Assyrians, it can he seen that ^ their numbers do not preponderate and that the pop ulation of the area is far from homogeneous. Kurdish nationalism may therefore he considered to he as much a lost cause as was that of the Jacohites after the T ianov- erian succession in ENGLAND, though it may he 'an uncon scionable time a-dying'. The remaining sparks of the movement may he said to he kept alive hy ex-officials of the Turkish and post-Turkish administration, hy the Youth Movement' among students, and hy young and minor chiefs who acpire to the influence that their more im portant elders once held. These last are of no signi ficance as they have no serious claim to recognition hv the tribes. ^ MO SUL L i w a. It is reported that about 1st May Shaikh Fakhir of ZILKA FAKHIR (P/NE. 28. d) was killed at GIR BEDIT village (P/IIE. 53. c). It is suspected that this murder was committed by Qadir Agha of ZANGANAH (P/SE. 3.a) of the Ashair Saha’a tribe. Shaikh Fakhir was a minor the Aqra Surchi and an uncle of Shaikh Ahmed of BARZAIT.

F. perrorrel in an aircraft mishap. About six cases of robbery directed against Assyrian villages and Ashuti encampments have occurred recently, mainly in the SHAIKHAN Qadha. BARZAN Area. Khalil Khoshawi recently got into touch with a tribesman resident at SHIRWAN-A-MAZIN (l D/N¥. 3.a) and requested him to inform Striking Force Headquarters that on no account would he permit Ulia Beg (see para graph 148 of Summary of Intelligence for April)to act as intermediary between himself and the government. Khoshawi asked that a conference be held between himself and Striking Force Headquarters in order to discuss the terms of dakhalah to be offered to him. The authorities replied that he will be pardoned for his rebellion against government but 'without prejudice to any action that the Ministry of Justice may wish to take against him with regard to civil crimes committed by him. As Khoshawi w r as originally excluded from the general am nesty to the Barzan rebels owing to his murdering an Assyrian policeman in his charge and as he and his fol lowers have been responsible since for the murder of about seven village Mukhtars, it is unlikely that he will accept these terms. A further small number of Khoshawi rebels have recently surrendered to the authorities. They have been released on guarantee of good behaviour, but their rifles have been retained by the authorities. 228 .r 229 . 230* 231* 252. 233 . Page 16. In continuation of paragraph 156 of last month’s Summary Shaikh Ahmed of BARZAN, his hrother Mulla Mustafa, his mother and 19 of his followers arrived in BAGHDAD from NASIRIYA on 22nd April and are now living in the Karradat-al-oLarqiyah under police surveillance. SULAIHANI Liwa . Saiyid Ata, was reported (see paragraph 90 of Summary of Intelligence for March 1935) to he active at the end of February in the PENJWIN area raiding across the IRAN border, and to have been engaged by the ^Iraqi police in the mountains near WAINA (2 I/NW. 13*a), re mained quiet until 30th April, when he came into con tact with a party of Iranian Amniyeh and troops near BASHMAGH (2 l/OT* 25*c), and fled across the ’Iraqi bor der near MASUI (2 l/NW. 25.a). The Iranian Amniyeh followed him into ’IRAQ, but were opposed by the villagers of MASUI, who said they thought the Iranians had come to steal their flocks. The fact that Shaikh Sa’aid of MASUI is a friend of Saiyid Ata may have helped this misunder standing. Saiyid Ata returned to IRAN and is reported to be continuing his activities against government caravans and transport. Shaikh Salih, a watchmaker of KIRKUK, who is a Kurdish nationalist and a member of the Pashlawi society ( see paragraphs 81 and 82 of the Summary for March), v/ent to BAGHDAD on 10th April. He returned to KIRKUK on 14th April and went immediately to the PIZHDER area where he met Koikha Majid and other outlaws. On 24th April he proceeded to BAGHDAD and a week later returned to KIRKUK. He is understood to have been requested by the outlaws to act as an intermediary on their behalf to ob tain them a pardon from the government. It is probable that his actions are also instigated by the Kurdish Nationalist Party. It is not known what terms, if any, he has succeeded in obtaining for the outlaws. No activities have been reported this month tn the part of Shaikh Muhammed Pichkola, who was last re ported to be sheltering in one of Abbas-i-Mahmud Agha's Pizhder villages (see paragraph 161 of last month’s Summary), but followers of Hama Ali Rustam are reported to have visited the village of DAR BARU (2E/NW. 21.d) on 4th May and stolen one rifle, 10 Dinars and two horses. Two other banditries have also been attributed to Hama Ali Rustam and his followers, but they are thought to be the work of local thieves or sections of the Ismail Uzairi, who are now migrating through the area, as Hama Ali Rustam, who is sheltering in the Pizhder area, is unlikely to continue illegal activities while negotiating his surrender to the authorities. Hama Riza Beg, a Merivan Begzada and a leader of Iranian irregulars in the pay of the Iranian govern ment was captured with another man on the night of 17th May in BENAWA SUTA village (2 I/KW. 25.e). The vil lagers took them and their rifles to PENJWIN and accused them of reconnoitring the village with a view to bring ing Iranian Amniyeh and troops to attack it. The pri soners were brought to SULAIMANI under escort on 22nd May.Page 17. 234 . 235 * 236. 237. 238. 239. On 7th and 16th May raids were made in the SEROCHIK Nahiya (2 E/lIE. 27-2 E/SE. 3) ty some of the BARZINJA Cr.nikhs. On the first occasion nine animals were stolen hut on the second occasion they were fired at and driven av/ay without anything being stolen. The trouble this month in the Middle EUPHRATES area has aroused no feeling among the SULAIMANI Kurds, except an interest in the progress of events. As they do not see he .v tne matter will benefit them in any way, they look on it as an internal quarrel among Arabs. They have no sympathy for the rebels as these are Shi’as. The Pizhder.

Although no reply has yet been made, it is not likely that the government will cancel purchases registered under legal tapu rights in accordance with the policy of the previous government. The Pizhder have also made enquiries about land they wished to buy in DESHT-I-BETWAIN (l D/SW. 23.24) in the RANIA Qs-dha, where the people are few and poor and consequently willing to sell, but this was not sanctioned by the government owing to the influence in that area of certain sections of the Piran, who are hostile to the Pizhder. The acquisition of more land is an economic necessity for the pizhder, since at the peace which was made in 1927 between them and the government of IRAN after they had looted SARDASHT (l H/SW. 30.b) the pre vious year they were compelled to give up a considerable proportion of their lands and all but 24 of their villages in IRAN, although the authorities undertook not to inter fere v/lth their highland grazing. Up to the present there has been no definite attempt to prevent the pizhder crossing the frontier to and from their summer grazing grounds with their arms and possessions as they please; they also visit SARDASHT without interference and do not wear the Pahlevi hat, which was made obligatory for Iranian tribesmen.Page 18. 240. 241. 242. 243. 244 . Recently a very friendly at lieved to have offered lages which vere ta 1 en offered suholdies to cultivate the land, economic difficulties, Pizhder stated that they would come and lieved the offer to Iranian authorities against 'IRAQ. to return from them those Aghai the Iranian authorities have adopted itule towards the Pizhder and are te- to them free the vil- in 1927 and to have who will return and Although this would relieve their the offer was refused, and the iuen they wanted the villages Tbach take them hy force, for they be- te merely due to an attempt by the to get the Pizhder on their side Moreover, the Pizhder a re naturally hostile to he policy of IRAN, which is to break the power of the tribal chiefs and to extend the government's adminis tration. &gt; Some progress has been made with the Mungur, Mamish, Piran, Avroman and Jaf Begzadas, but the pizhder have, to the present, escaped with the payment of a haliya tax, 100 to 150 rials in respect of each village according to size. vx±j.age I-blQ the Q/Jiul DIZA and MIRGAH districts, which comprise the bulk of the PIZHDER area, are openly acknowledged to be unadministered and to be under the f ole c ? nt f° 1 the Pizhder Aghas. The I.LA7AT Nahiya is nominally administered by the government of 'IRAQ, ^ 0 Ji acGd a Mudir in the village of MjIWjxT, and estab lished a police post (containing eight mounted and six foot police; beside the village, but the Mudir existed o 0f Ha ? ;ji Abbas-I-Selim Agha of GAPILON (2 E/N',7. l,.a), who is the most influential Agha in the Nahiya. At the moment the post of Mudir is vacant. The administration of the northern portion of the SHAR BAZHER Qadha (the ALAN District), though nom inally under the Qaimmaqam of CKOARTA (2 E/NE. 19.b), is similar to that in the 1LAWAT Nahiya. Sooner or later the government of 'IRAQ will have to face the problem of extending its administration to the PIZHDER area and the weakness of this people lies in the fact that their winter grazing grounds lie in IR/ k Q, v/hile in the summer many of them migrate to IRAN, thus an opportunity is afforded the respective govern ments to gain some sort of control at the time of migration. The present policy of IRAN seems to be to cause trouble for 'IRAQ all along the common frontier, and un til the two governments can agree to co-operate with one another, the Pizhder are likely to retain their independence.S ECTION III IRAN, IRAN' IRAN- IRAN- IRilN- AIR FORCES. lartAer to paragraph PER-11 in the February Summary of Intelligence, very good progress has been made Y/ith the erection of aircraft at AH1VAZ.

The transfer of the Headquarters of the Royal Navy in the PERSIAN GULP from the IRAN Coast to BAHREIN took place at the beginning of April. The intention to move was kept a secret from the Iranian authorities up to the last moment, and no difficulties were experienced other than that of a Very strong shemal which hampered the loading of stores at HENJAM. There was an attempt by Iranian officials to impede the evacuation of non-* Iranian^inhabitants from British BASIDU, but this was discontinued when the move was explained. The ensign was iowered with honours at RASIDU on the evening of the 11th April and was hoisted with full honours at JUPAIR m BAHREIN on the afternoon of 13th April. The move^from the Iranian coast to BAHREIN had much to recommend it, but it did entail the surrender of a^strong strategic position at the entrance to the PERSIAN GULP. This drawback has been obviated since His Highness the Sultan of MUSCAT has given permission for ships of the Royal Navy to use the anchorage at KHOR KUWAI, near Cape MUSANDAM, and for buildings to be erect ed on RAS SALIB. ABU DHABI. The Shaikh of ABU DHABI has, for a long time, adopted a very obstructive attitude towards the estab lishment of the air route along the Arab shore of the Gulf and made difficulties about granting a site for a landing ground and a petrol store. After long drawn out negotiations the Shaikh at last agreed to grant these facilities in consideration of quite a handsome payment, out when, last month, a party of the Royal Air Porce were conveyed by one of H.M. Sloops to mark out the landing ground and to erect the petrol store, he refused to allow work to be started on the latter on the grounds that he had understood that a tank and not a building was required. This was such an obvious quibble that sanction was obtained to bring pressure to bear by the threat that the Royal Navy would prevent the ABU DHABI pearling fleet putting to sea, and the Shaikh at once withdrew his objection.

For^the rest or the month the ar.itd forces were kept 'busily en,ja, ( ;ed in collecting the fires which were im posed by the military tr.‘t anal and in punishing some of the tribesmen who had oj .o._ed the advance from NASIRIYA* hut, althougli tne uistrict remained in a very unsettled condition, no scrims trouble was experienced. Elections . In spite of the fact that two districts in Southern ’IRAQ were still subject to military law, the Prime Minister decided to press forward with the elections as soon as possible; having successfully quelled the revolt, he no doubt felt that his prestige in the country was sufficiently high to allow him to ignore the claims of his political opponents to repre sentation in the new Chamber. Most of these erstwhile opponents seem to have resigned themselves to a spell of political obscurity and several of them., including the two previous prime ministers, have decided that it will be healthier for them to spend the summer abroad. It is believed that Ali Jawdat’s choice has fallen on BRIGHTON, but Jamil Beg al Madfa’i proposes to go no further than the LEBANON, and still has hopes that a place will be found for him in the Cabinet. On llth June orders were issued by the Minis ter of the Interior for preliminary arrangements to be made for holding the elections. Prior to an election in ’IRAQ it is always found advisable to make a number of changes amongst the administrative officials in order to ensure that the electoral committees carry out their duties efficiently, and that the persons chosen in BAGHDAD are duly elected in the provinces. The re shuffle which has taken place on the present occasion is unprecedented, and changes in appointments have been announced in the press with such frequency that it has been quite impossible to keep pace with them. The re sult of these elections will be awaited with some curi osity, for it will be remembered that the conduct of the elections last December was severely criticised from a number of different sources, and that demands were made for 'free” elections, which are generally considered to be an -impossibility in the present state of illiteracy of the country. Birthday of the Prophet . The government issued orders tl .t 13th June should be a public holiday throughout t: a &gt; t.utry in order to celebrate the birth of Muhammed, although the Shi’a community celebrates the anniversary 15 days earlier. Traditionally the Moslem world has taken very little notice of this anniversary, but with governmssm 249, 250# 251. 252 .

Shi'a Disturb anoeg. ,, reported in the May Summary of Intelligence, the revolt had, by the end of May, been brought to a successful conclusion, except for a small area round SUQ ASH SHUYUKH, where the flooded nature of the country proved a severe handicap to the troops, and, even with the assistance of the improvised flotilla referred to in paragraph 207, little progress could be made. It was obvious, however, that any idea of a widespread ris ing had been dissipated and that there was little to be gained by the insurgents in that area prolonging the struggle. Most of the tribal leaders therefore fell to the blandishments of the Minister of the Interior, aided no doubt by a certain amount of judicious bribery, and hastened to NASIRIYA to make submission to the gov ernment, and the armed forces were allowed to enter SUQ ASH SHTJYTJKH without further opposition on 2nd June. During the rest of the month the military tri bunal was kept busy trying by court martial a number of persons who had been implicated in the trouble, ^nd these ranged in importance from Abdul Ghani Hammadi, a former Deputy, who was sentenced to seven years rigorous impri~ sonment and a fine of 1,000 Dinars, to a number of stud ents who were ordered to be flogged. Several life sen tences were inflicted, but only two persons were condemned to death; these were ex-soldiers who were found guilty of having operated machine guns against the police and they were publicly hanged on 6th June. It may here be mentioned that Shaikh Khawwam al Hajji Farhud, leader of the RUMAITHA revolt, who was condemned to death by tro military tribunal, has had his sentence commuted to life imprisonment. Fines, both in rifles and cash, were imposed on the tribes round NASIRIYA and SUQ ASH SHUYUKH, and in certain cases sectional leaders were held as hostages253. 254. Page 3. lending the collection of these fines. In the SUQ ASH bHUYUIIH area, the strongest opposition to the troops had been put up by the Hacham, under Farhud al Pandi ^rd Raisan and Mushir Qasid al ITahi, and so on 7th June a column proceeded to the QASID Al r.PU village, where they set fire to the huts and cut he .. 3 0 p-aln trees. This treatment seemed scarcely in accord wxth the pro mises of the Minister of the Interior, and ?andi al Farhud made preparations to resist any attempt by the troops to enter his area. On 8th June, the tribesmen repulsed a force which was attempting to reach Fandi al Farhud's village, and inilicted eleven casualties. In consequence, the village was bombed for three days and the attempt was renewed on 16th June, when the troops again met with some resistance. In the meantime, a proclamation had been issued that if these three leaders made themselves scarce, no attempt would be made to ap prehend them, and they are now believed to be in the neighbourhood of QURNA; with their disappearance the tribesmen’s resistance abated, but it was found advisa ble to draft strong reinforcements of police from BASRAH to the SUQ ASH SHUYUKH area. One result of the government’s preoccupation elsewhere was the decision of tribesmen on the GHARRAF to seize the opportunity to pay off old scores in some of their long standing land disputes. On 9th June it was reported that the Albu Alyan section of the Abudah had seized the crops of the Al Hatim, a section of the Beni Dilab, and had turned out t: e agents of the Al Manna, who are non-tribal absentee landlords. This action was probably due to a long standing dispute be tween Khayoun al Ubaid, paramount chief of the Abudah, and Saiyid Abdul Mahdi, a wealthy landowner who lives at KARRADI on the GHARRAF. The issue was complicated by fighting which broke out between sections of the Beni Said tribe farther down the GIIARRAF. Twenty men were killed and three wounded and as the efforts of the authorities to arrange a truce were unavailing, a warning was dropped from the air that the leaders must come in to Qadha headquarters at 3HATRA; as this was not obeyed, the area was bombed on 15th June and in consequence the sectional leaders surrendered to the government author ities. A report which has not been confirmed from official sources states that Abdul Wahid al Hajji Sikkar also took advantage of the lack of government control and of his recent efforts on behalf of the new government to establish his nephew, Muhammed Ibn Mubdir al Far’oun, on land belonging to sons of Shaikh Habib, of NAJAF in the ABU SUKHAIR Qadha. The police sent by the Qaimmaqam to oust Muhammed found a large and hostile crowd of Fatlah tribesmen and were unable to take any action, but subse quently, after a conversation with the Minister of the Interior, Abdul Wahid was prevailed upon to go himself and remove his nephew.r A» s.yrian Situation. 255 256. 257. 258. 259.

Thus it appeared eminentiy desirable that some indication should be given that the League of Nations did not intend to allow this scheme to suffer the same fate as the two previous ones of emigration to BRAZIL and to BRITISH GUIANA, and that, as an earnest of good faith, .a. limited number of Assy rians should be transferred to SYRIA immediately. These views were communicated to Senor Olivar. •he senior member of the League of Nations Commission. A T ho was at BEYROUTH awaiting the- arrival of the High Conmissione.iy M. de Martel stated'that there would be no diiiiculty in expanding the Assyrian settlement on the KHABUR. river immediately to take about 1,300 more persons, but .that £60,000 must first be paid. When the proposal was put before the Prime Minister of 1 IRAQ he expressed the willingness of his government to make an immediate payment of the £60,000 required, the only stipulation being that it shall be considered an advance payment and shall be covered by the .same terms as those under ,/hich £120,000 had been promised, which are be lieved to be that the payment, shall not exceed £10 per head. * Immediate steps were taken ta arrange the transfer, and Mar Yusuf, the Nestorian Metropolitan and uncle of the Mar Shimun, was invited to MOSUL to assist m drawing up a list of those to go at once. The list included the 340 women and children still in the refugee camp at MOSUL, 930 destitute from the town and 70 persons from DOHUK. The authorities wished to include all the more prominent agitators of the Mar Shimun party, but it was decided that Qasha Hanna and Samasha Elias had better be allowed to remain to officiate in the Assyrian churchi at MOSUL. ^ A11 arrangements were completed by 17th June 700 +o e e?7 ne Snn W ? re Pald 3Ums V r y ±ri S from I.

The first convoy with persons from the refugee camp left MOSUL on 26th June and the remainder of the camp left on 29th. There is some doubt as to when further con- liHHBHSai 260. 261. 262. 263. 264 * Page 5. voys can be accepted, but it is hoped that all the 1,340 persons will be able to leave during the next two or three weeks. In the meantime, no further steps are being taken to register the names of those vko wish to leave ’IRAQ and those who wish to stay, as it is feared that it might have an unsettling effect and persuade the form er either that they were likely to go immediately or that there was some plot to keep them in 'IRAQ. In point of fact there are, as described in paragraph 218 of the May Summary of Intelligence, very considerable financial difficulties to be overcome before arrange ments can be made for any more of the Assyrians to leave. The French authorities would prefer that a start shorld be made with the mo;o at the beginning of September and that it should be suspended on 15th Oct ober with the approach of winter, but it appears to be extremely improbable that financial arrangements will permit that programme to be adhered to. The leaders of the different Assyrian factions appear to appreciate the reasons for delay in emigration and it is thought that they will be able to prevent any serious unrest among their followers provided that the delay does not drag on indefinitely and that some relief, either in cash or work, is given to them in the meantime. It is difficult to appreciate the real state of destitution in the north in view of the fact that the inmates of the refugee camp were able to draw I.F. 600 from a local bank before leaving, and, since the commit tee had tried to ensure that only the most needy were in cluded in this batch of emigrants, the members were some what naturally incensed when they received an application from one emigrant to be allowed to take his billiard table with him. Nevertheless., there is undoubtedly a certain amount of destitution and the government authorities are doing their bestfo# find work for the unemployed. On 1st June the Mutasarrif of MOSUL wrote to both the P.W. D. and the Municipal authorities requesting them to employ as many Assyrians as possible. As a result the P.W. D. have recently taken on 25 Assyrians in MOSUL Town and are employing about 100 Assyrians of the Alamun section on read construction in the BIBAIII area (137.0/SW.30.c). There has recently been a considerable amount of friction amongst the Persian Assyrians in BAG-HLAI). Mar Yukhanan, who is Bishop of the Orthodox Assyrian Church, interviewed Senor Ollvan during his visit to BAGHDAD and stated that he represented 600 families of Assyriars from IRAN who did not wish to be included in the scheme of emigration to SYRIA. presumably the Bishop's fear was that in SYRIA his flock would become identified with followers of the Mar Shimun and he would lose their ecclesiastical obedience. This action in censed a number of the Assyrians in BAGHDAD? who feared that the league of Nations Commission would take away with them an erroneous impression, for a considerable number of them who came from URMIA with the ex-Ottoman subjects in 1918 to the rest camp at BAQUBA have becomer 265. 266* 267. 268. 269 . Page 6. staunch adherents of the Mar Shiimin, and are just as anxious as any of the other Assyrians to emigrate to SYRIA. Consequently, a deputation waited on Senor Olivan to represent their views and unofficial lists were drawn up of ex-Iranian Assyrians who wish to emigrate. It is understood that Senor Olivan stated that no decision had been reached by the League of Nations as uo the future of the Iranian subjects. Although immed iately aft^r the war there was no difficulty about these people returning to their former homes in URMIA, and some in fact did return, a great number of them re mained in ’IRAQ and have become imbued with the refugee spirit, and consider that they are entitled to equal treatment with those whose former homes were in the HAKKIARI mountains of TURKEY. Ye add to the difficulty, Assyrians from IRAN have steadily been drifting into ’IRAQ for the past few years owing to the very bad conditions in their own country, and would be most loath to return there. This friction amongst the two parties of Iranian Assyrians led to several disturbances which are being investigated by the police, and it is understood that the Iraq government intends to deport a number of persons who have come from IRAN fairly recently, and, not having taken out naturalisation papers, have no claim to remain -n ’IRAQ* Rumours of this intention are causing a considerable amount of concern throughout the whole of the Assyrian community. POLITICAL - LOREI-QN. The disturbances on the EUPHRATES described in paragraphs 183 to 196 of the May Summary of Intelli gence had important reactions in the Southern Desert, due partly to the fact that a number of police were withdrawn from the desert posts as reinforcements for the disturbed areas, and partly to the belief, which gained eager credence, that the authority of the ’Iraq government had departed and that the old and well loved sport of tribal raiding might be resumed with impunity. In consequence, numerous small parties of camel thieves from the Shammar and Dhafir tribes encamped in ’IRAQ started looting from the tribes located in KUWAIT between SAPWAN and the northern shores of the Bay. The Kuwait tribes were most anxious to take the law into their own hands and retaliate, but were restrained by the Shaikh, who took hostages from several of them. On 27th May, however, the raiders started interfering with travellers on the BASRAH - KUWAIT road and fired on the mail van. In consequence, the Shaikh sent out a force of armed cars which managed to round up some of the thieves, but the whole of the Southern Desert is reported to be in a very disturbed condition and camels are being grazed under strong armed guards instead of the usual unarmed camelherda.r 270. 271, 272. 273. 274 . Page 7. On the southern portion of the common frontier between IRAN and 1 IRAQ the disturbances in the EUPHRATES area have been responsible for some increase in the strength of the Iranian frontier posts from opposite AKARA as far south as MUHAMMERJJI. Reports have also been received, but have not been confirmed, that there has been an increase in the strength of the garrison towns in KHUZISTAN. Even if true, this probably only means that with unrest in 'IRAQ the Iranian authorities expect that there will be an increase in smuggling from 'IRAQ and that possibly tney may le embarrassed by an influx of rebel refugees from across the border. In view of the dispute over the question of the frontier, IRAN is probably not sorry to see 'IRAQ encountering a certain amount of difficulty with her subjects, but, as a result of the meeting of the Council of the League of Nations last month, IRAN's hope for getting a readjustment of the frontier in her favour appears to be less sanguine, and the Shah may now be reconciled to maintaining the status quo for the present. 'Iraq-Syrian Frontier . The French Special Service Officer of the DIJLAH Qadha at AIN DIY/AR? accompanied by other Syrian officials, held a meeting at TALL AFAR on 25th May with the 'Iraqi Frontier Commission (consisting of the Qaim- maqams of TALL AFAR and ZAKHO and their Assistant Com mandants of Police) to look into outstanding tribal disputes on the 'Iraqi-Syrian frontier. Oil. INDUSTRIES &amp; RESOURCES. There is a confident report that a decision has been taken to link up MOSUL with the present terminus of the railway at TEL KOTCHEK in SYRIA. Although de tails are not yet available, it is understood that the party with chief interest in this project is the British Oil Development Company, which in 1932 obtained a con cession from the government to exploit all oil found in 'IRAQ west of the river TIGRIS and north of latitude 33. During the past few years drilling operations have been carried out at a number of points south and west of MOSUL, and oil has been found in considerable quantity, but the quality is such that lack of viscosity prevents it from being pumped through a pipe line. The company has now temporarily abandoned hope of finding oil in more suitable quality for export and has decided its produce must reach the sea by rail. The oilfield is considerably nearer to BAIJI, the terminus of the standard gauge line from BAGHDAD# and from several points of view it would appear to have275. 276. Page 8. been a far more suitable arrangement to male use of that means of access to the sea, although some inconvenience might have been caused by the change of gauge at BAGHDAD. The choice of the northern route and of TRIPOLI as the port is probably to some extent due to the change of ownership in the Company which took place last year. Originally, over 50$ of the shares were in private Brit ish ownership, tut last year, when the company experi enced difficulty in meeting its obligations to the gov ernment of ’IRAQ, the Italian government stepped into the breach and found the money, and has, in consequence, obtained a controlling interest in the company. it is difficult to see how oil exported by rail will be able to compete commercially with oil which reaches the sea by a comparatively cheap pipe line, unless the govern ment ot ’IRAQ is prepared to reduce the royalties pay able by the company. Purity Campaign . The advent to power of the new cabinet has marked a revival of the purity campaign instituted by Rashid Ali Gailani when he was Prime Minister two years ago, and was responsible for closing down all cabarets in BAGHDAD. Shortly aftur his return to office as Minister of the Interior a circular was sent to all government departments in the Capital and to Mutasarrifs in the provinces dealing with the need for improvement in public morals. Amongst other reforms there is to be a decrease in the number of wine shops and those any where near a mosque have already been closed; indecent dancing is prohibited in hotels and gambling in public places is forbidden; all places of entertainment with refreshments and music must be closed by 11 p.m. The contrast between BAGHDAD at night and other eastern cities such as DAMASCUS or TEHRAN is now even more marked than ever; long before midnight the streets are completely deserted except for the edifying sight of a couple of policemen here and there holding hands at a street corner. MILITARY FORCES. Conscriptio n. The most important event which took place during the past month was the issue of a Royal Irada on 12th June, by which the National Defence Act, passed by Parliament last year, became law. It is understooa that during the interval committees have been at work in the Ministry of Defence drawing up a detailed pro gramme of how it is to be put i... ^orce. Although de tails have not been disclosed, it is believed that the first batch of recruits will be called up in about six months time, before which it is anticipated that the census will have been completed.r 277. 278. 279. 280. 281 . Page 9. It is probable that for the first few years ample^recruits will be obtainable from the towns and that it will be unnecessary to try to extend conscrip tion to the tribesmen, amongst whom it is sure to be unpopular, it is also believed that for some years a number of units will be retained on a voluntary basis. The local papers state that i ore than 4,000 students have offod to join the army since the prom ulgation of the national Defence Law. As students are specifically exempted under the act this magnificent gesture will no doubt be fully appreciated. AIR FORGE S. Further to paragraph 171 of the May Summary of Intelligence, which stated that the Director-General of Police had^ decided to make deductions from the pay of the force in order to purchase an aeroplane for the Royal^ Iraqi Air Force, the local press reports that a similar step is being taken by f Iraqi civil servants who are said to have agreed to contribute a percentage of their^salaries. Since most ’Iraqi officials are badly paid, invariably adopt a mode of life superior to their financial resources, and are consequently seldom out of debt, these contributions must entail a real sacrifice, a suggestion which has been made that all officials shall contribute one month's salary each year to this cause undoubtedly owes its inspira tion to TURJOSY, where the Prime Minister recently voiced the intention of his government to acquire an air fleet of at least 500 aircraft, but, realising that this will be impossible through ordinary means of taxation, it is hoped that sentiment will enable the money to be provided by voluntary contributions. OPERATIONS. As mentioned in paragraph 207 of the May Sum mary of Intelligence, in view of the difficulty of troop movements owing to the flooded nature of the country round SUQ ASH SHUYUKH, quite a considerable flotilla of river craft was fitted out by the Port of BASRAH Author ity for use against the tribesmen. Two privately owned stern wheelers and a paddle steamer were requisitioned and were armed under the supervision of the Port authority; one of the vessels carried two 2.75 guns and the others each had one gun. protective plating was provided for the more vulnerable parts of the ships and sand-bag machine gun posts were erected in the bows. Four pontoons, each capable of accommodating 200 men, were converted into floating forts by the provision of plating and sand-bags, and were surmounted by a circular armoured tower withr 282. 283. 284, 285. 286 . Page 10. positions for two maohine guns. The pontoons were towed by motor boats and the flotilla included two motor launches from which the cabii^'l'ittings were stripped, and were replaced by protective plating and machine guns. The Port authority launch, ^Tilda”, was the flagship and was equipped with wireless and a searchlight. Fuel for the expedition was carried in two oil barges and one month’s food supplies for the crews and fighting personnel were taken. 200 police anr’ GO sol diers were embarked at BASRAH and the other troops were taken on board at QURNA. The aim of the expedition was to restore the situation at CHUBAISH and presumably to prevent the trouble spreading along the shores of the HAMMAR LAICS to QURNA and thence through the marshes towards AMARA. In this it was successful, but two additional pontoons, fitted out as described above, which were sent in sections by rail to NASIRIYA for use against SUQ ASH SHUYUKH, were able to make little progress until the tribesmen capitulated as described in paragraph 250. After the entry into SUQ ASH SHUYUKH on 2nd June, the troops were employed for the next three weeks in collecting fines, during the course of which a certain number of casualties were inflicted by the tribesmen. By the end of the month the army had been replaced by police except for one battalion, with a sections of guns, which remained at NASIRIYA. The Hawker aircraft which had been operating from the landing ground at UR returned to BAGHDAD on 8th June, but in view of the opposition to the army put up by followers of Farhud al Fandi, as described in paragraph 252 one flight returned to UR a few days later and remained there until 25th •h'.ce, when it was trans ferred to DIWANIYAH. Since read and railway connection with NASIRIYA had been destroyed, the troops there were kept supplied by Dragon aircraft. Throughout these operations, during which the Royal ’Iraqi Air Force has flown nearly 1,000 hours, it has put up a very credit able show, and though it is difficult to estimate the casualties which have been inflicted by bombing, the rapid submission of the tribesmen in many instances is attributed in army and government circles to its effect. INTERNAL SECURITY. Labour Unions. ,rl ' r 1 ~ ir 1 The local press reports that it is highly pro bable that the Labour Unions (last referred to in para graph 116 of the Summary for May 1934) will shortly resume their functions, and that the question is receiv ing full consideration from the government. These unions were closed down on account of their activities during the Electric Light Strike in 1933 but, as stated in paragraph 744 of the Summary for Decemberl933, YassinPage 11. 287. 288. 289* 290. Pasha al Hashimi, now Prime Minister hut then a leader of the Opposition, has taken a rreat deal of interest in the movement and no doubt hopes that he will be able to rely upon support from the unions, whereas previous premiers have found them a constant source of embarrass ment. Yeo ldies . At the end of May, Ahmed al Matte, the chief of the Samuka Section of the SIN JAR Yezidies, died aixd the Qaimmaqam of SINJAR has temporarily appointed Ahmed 1 s son, Khalaf, as chief of this section. The sectional leaders, however, are hostile to Khalaf’s appointment as Rais owing to his youth. Some of them are in favour of the appointment of Masikh ibn Ahmed al Yalloo as chief. The matter is still under consideration by the Qadha authoritie s. It is reported that at the end of May Shaikh Haidar of BAHZANI (137. P/SW. 5. c), an influential religious leader of the 3HAIKHAN Yezidies, was killed at the house of Haji Marabi at JARAHIYAH village (137. p/NW. 21.d) whilst on tour with the Sanjaq (peacock). Tribal gossip attributes the crime to Qawal Sinu, a priest of the Shaikh Adi SI vine end a friend of Saed Beg, the Mir, who lives at BAIDHRA (137. ?/NW. 22.a). It is said that the Qawals are positive that Sinu committed the crime but are remaining silent for fear of reprisals from the Mir. Shaikh Haidar was anti-Mir and represented the Khudaida party in the SHAIKHAN Qadha. After the recon ciliation of the Khudaida-Saed Beg groups in 1933, Shaikh Haidar took the leading part in the tour of the peacock in the SHAIKHAN Qadha. It is alleged that about three years ago Saed Beg despatched an emissary to kill shaikh Haidar, but that the man killed the Shaikh's brother, Barakat, in error. MOSUL Liwa . On 28th May Muhammed Agha ibn Haji Agha, the chief of the Sherifan nomad section of the Artushi was murdered in his village GAHMAWAH SADUN (137. L/NE. 5.c) by a servant, who fled from the village taking with him the rifle, revolver and horse of the victim. The Sherifani suspect that the murder was instigated by Said Agha of GERMAWE (137. P/NW* 7.a), the chief of the Do ski, who had a blood feud with Muhammed Agha as the latter's father was implicated in the murder of Said Agha's father and uncles some years ago. Haji Agha, son of the late Muhammed Agha, has asked the authorities to arrest the criminal. Meanwhile the Sherifan and other sections of the Artushi are reported to be await ing a suitable opportunity to attack the Doski, who are stated to have concentrated around GERMAWE. Muhammed Agha was a most influential man among the Artushi nomads and kept the Sherifan under good con trol. During the 1933 Assyrian disturbances he took no part in the looting of the villages and in many cases took charge of Assyrian property, most of which he re turned to the owners at the end of the disturbances.Page 12. 291 t 292. 293. 2M. Early in JUne Haji Tatar Khan ihn Ilaji Rashid .&gt;eg of PARSHESH (137. O/SW. 22,a), the chief of the Parv/ari Bala tribe died and has hoen succeeded 'by his brother, Ahmed Beg, the Mudir of KAL ;TI f 1 D/lPV. 20. a). Their father Haji Rashid Beg was one of the ablest Kurdish leaders in Central KURDISTAN. He took a prom inent part in the AMADIA rising and was eventually forced to take refuge in TURKEY. In the sprina of 1920 he surrendered unconditionally and after a few months m MOSUL was re-instated as chief of the Barwari Bala. He never, however, regained complete control over his tribe. Ho cioa^in 1729, and his son, Tatar Khan, who had not the ability of his father, gradually lost hold over the tribe. As a result, since the father’s death, the internal cohesion of the tribe has been poor. A report states that at the beginning of June he Mudir of^DOHUK, Lazer Effendi (an Assyrian), accom- S.H. 0. of Police, proceeded to ZATTiA (137. P/W. 9.a) to investigate a dispute be- ween the villagers and their Mukhtar, Saiyid Muho of the Mazuri Zher, as the latter's brother and the vil lagers had requested the DOHUK authorities to appoint a new Mukhtar. Muho refused to vacate his post or to moot^the Mudir and when the investigation committee was leaving threatened to shoot the Mudir. Later Muho came into DOHUK and was arrested. He was subsequently ro- is being charged with threatening a government official. The other officials and the DOIIUK notables arc said to have asked the Mudir to withdraw the charge but he is believed to have refused to do so. Saiyid^ Muho has always been a source of trouble in the ZAWITA area and during the 1933 disturbances played a prominent part in the looting of the Assyrian villages in the DOHUK Qadha. b BARZAN Area . Towards the end of May Khalil Khoshawi went into hiding in one of the Turkish Girdi villages and is believed to be still there. During May and June he and his followers have remained quiet. This is probably due to the pressure maintained by the government forces, whose dispositions have now made it almost impossible for the rebels to move from one place to another. It is, however, reported that the rebels have burnt all the grazing in the area north of SHIRWAN-A-MAZIN. Owing to the number of rebels who have accepted the government’s offer of ’’Dakhalah” (paragraph 157 of the Summary for April) it is believed that the total number of rebels s'till out with Khalil Khoshawi acounts to about 40 men only. ARBIL Liwa . Owing to highway robbery and lawlessness the RANIA Qadha is in a disturbed state and the author ities seem to exert little influence there. A long standing enmity between Ka Nebi Agha, head of the Mand- amera Section of the A' ! 'o, who lb\.s at DUGOMAN (l D/SE. 18.b), and Sowar Agha of the piran, who lives at SERKUMA (l D/SE. 28. a), came to a head in May and as a result these two tribal chiefs have been busy looting andPage 13 295. 296. 297. 298. thieving from each other. Mamand Agha, the paramount chief of the Ako, appears to exercise little control over Ka Nehi Agha and the Mandamera Section. At the end of May the Mandamera and Naodasht Sections of the Aho tri&gt;e collected a lashkar, with a few men from other sections, to operate against Sowar Agha. They demanded 500 sheep and goats and 120 horses, mules, etc, , from the Piran trfbe, which they alleged the Piran had stolen from them. Ka Nebi Agha and Sowar Agha were then called into Oadha headquarters at RUT IA to arrange'a settlement. The outcome of this is not yet known, but it is reported that in the meantime the road to the summer highlands of the Piran Khels has been blocked by the Mandamera in the vicinity of the DERBEND-I-tRANIA (l D/SE. 24. d). SULAIMANI Liwa . Saiyid Ata (see paragraph 230 of last month’s Summary) is still active in the RA1TEH-SHILL AIR area (2.1. A. l) and has had several encounters with the ’Iraqi police and Iranian Amniyeh. In continuation of paragraph 231 of last month’s Summary, it is reported that a messenger arrived in KIRKUK on 14th May from Koikha Majid and the other outlaws to enquire as to the result of the petitions they had submitted for amnesty for their crimes and for the acceptance of their ’’Dakhalah”. Shaikh Salih is said to have replied that at present the government was engaged with the disturbances in the south but would probably accept their ’’Dakhalah”. It is believed that Koikha Majid and Hama Ali Rustam will be pardoned, but not Shaikh Muhammed Pichkola. While refraining from banditry in 'IRAQ, Hama Ali Rustam with a band of 25 men is reported to have entered IRAN on 15th May, looted houses in GARAMAWA (l H/SW. 35. c), a village belonging to Haji Ab$as-i- Selim Agha of the pizhder, and KANI IBRAHIM (2 E/NE. 3.c) and re-entered ’IRAQ near BARE-I-PICKUK (2 E/NE. 9. a). POPULATION &amp; TRIBES. Shammar. A quarrel broke out during May between the A f Laiyan sectidn of the Syrian Shammar and a section of the Shammar Abdah of 'IRAQ in which six of the former were killed. Each of the sections in conflict quickly grew in strength, the A^kiyan section camped north of the SINJAR increased from twenty to two hundred tents, while the Shammar Abdah encamped near TALL AFAR in creased to th^ee hundred tents. Shaikh Ajil al Yawwar, who is recognised as the paramount shaikh by the 'Iraq government, wished to reconcile the two parties by the payment of blood money, but the Abdah adopted a very truculent attitude and threatened again to attack thePage 14. 299. 300. 301. 302. 303. A’laiyan, who received a number of assurances of the support of Daham al Hadi, who is recognised as paramount shaikh by the Syrian government. Representatives of both sections in conflict were called to MOSUL, where it was arranged that the Abdah should pay as blood money 50 camels, 3 mares and 2 rifles, but when Shaikh Ajil, who attended the meeting went to collect the fine, the Abdah refused to pay. The Abdah have now movod to the neighbourhood of SHERGAT, while the A’laiyan, on Rrham’s instructions, have re turned to SYRIA, and are encamped with him, but it is their intention to attack the Abdah at the first favourable opportmity. A quarrel is also reported to have broken out between Shaikh Ajil and Shaikh Mahruth ibn Hadhal, owing to sections of the Sba’a and Fidaan of the Anaiza having come to terms with Ajil and crossed from SYRIA into the JEZIREH in ’IRAQ. Mahruth claims to be para mount shaikh of the AIT/ilZA, although his influence is really limited to those sections who spend the summer in ’IRAQ; exact details of the quarrel are not known, but Mahruth’s gmivance probably is that the Sba’a and the Fidaan dealt direct with Ajil and that he was ignored. Herki, Surchi and Khallani Nomads . In the middle of May the Herki (ARBIL and AQRA Divisions), Surchi (ARBIL Division) and Khailani nomads started moving up to their summer grazing grounds in the DALALIPER DAGH area (l C/SE. 28.b), and by the end of the month they had passed through the ROWANDUZ Gorge and were encamped in the SIDEKA area (l D/NE. 14. d). It is reported that the Iranian authorities have sent a message to the chief of these nomads that they will be permitted to enter Iranian territory on payment of Koda tax on a higher scale than 1934. It is thought that, if they enter IRAN, the Iranian authorities will sooner or later attempt to disarm them as an unsuccessful attempt to disarm certain elements was made in 1934. Ashuti (Assyrian) Nomads) . In the middle of May the Ashuti (Assyrian) nomads started on their summer migration and by the end of the month both sections (DOHUK and SHAIKHAN Divisions) were encamped from the SIPNA area up to SER AMADIA. At the end of June and the beginning of July they move via the BARWARI BALA area to their summer grazing grounds at AINATA (on the frontier, north of AMADIA). Jaf Migration . The Jaf, whose winter grazing grounds are in the area east and north-east of KIFRI, in the summer in the Iranian highlands betv/een MERIVAN ard the ’Iraq border, and who traverse in the spring and autumn the SHABR-I-ZOR plain in the KHURMAL (2 l/SW. 13.a) Nahiyah,Page 15. 304. 305. Tere last year prevented from entering their summer grazing grounds in IRAN (as described in paragraph 229 of the Summary for August 1934). The total m.nber of Jaf who usually migrate is believed to be about 3,000 folilies. This year owing to the spring drought this migration started in May, when they mov&lt;a.l into the SHAHR-I-ZOR plain. By the first week in Tune they had entered the PENJWIN ITahiyah. The Ismail ’Uzairi and Ghawwara tribes (former sections of the Jaf), who winter in the SURDASH (2 E/NW• 8. c) and SARCHINAR (2 E/NW. 35. a) areas and in the summer proceed through SHAHR BAZER along the SIV/EL river to the 3^‘JTEH (2 E/NE. 5,b) area in IRAJN, commenced to move at the same time and are now grazing in the SHAIIR BAZER district. These tribes are now waiting for permission to enter their grazing grounds in IRAN. On 7th June the Persian Frontier Commissioner, Yawar Nazir Khan Azadi of BANEH, wrote to the Mudir of PENJWIN suggesting that a conference be held in the vicinity of NANUR (2 l/NW. 7. c) to discuss the entry of the tribesmen into IRAN, the Iranian representatives to be the Iranian Frontier Commissioner, the Chief Revenue Officers of TEHRAN, BANEH and SAKIZ, and one Customs Official of BENEH and the ’Iraqi representatives to be the ’Iraqi Frontier Commissioner with two chiefs from each section of the Jaf and one chief from each section of the Izmail ’Uzairi and the Ghawwara. On 8th June the Qaimmaqam of HALABJA* the Mudir and the Inspector of Police of PENJWIN and some J-1* chiefs went to WAINA where they received a message from the Iranian author ities that the Iranian Frontier Commissioner had gone to SARDACITT and they must await his return. They were also instructed that when they came to NANUR they must do so without arms as they would be guarded by Iranian forces. The ’Iraqi delegation thereupon returned to PENJWIN«• On 11th June they were informed that the Iranian F r ontier Commissioner was ready to see them. The Qaimmaqam of HALABJA replied that they could not come back to WAINA, but that the Iranian Frontier Com missioner might come to PENJWIN but unarmed as he would be guarded by ’Iraqi police. A reply has not yet been received and the tribesmen are still waiting to cross the frontier into IRAN. As it is feared that if some decision is not arrived at soon the Jaf may attempt to force their way into IRAN, a Company of the 2nd Frontier Battalion ’Iraq Army, has been sent to PENJWIN to act as a deterrent against any hasty action on the part of the Jaf. Al Ubald . Owing to the lack of grazing in the HAWIJAH Plain (138. M/SE. 18.b), almost the whole of the Al ’Ubaid tribe have been allowed to move into the SHIRWANA (2 F/NW. 28. d), QARA HASSAN (2 E/SW. 25) and CHEMCHEMAL (2 A/NE. 25. o) Nahiyah, but the Mudirs of these dis tricts have been warned to ensure that no trouble occurs between these bedouin Arabs and the settled Kurdish inhabitants.&amp; 506. Page 16. This ti'j.'be had migrated as early as the middle of April to the neighbourhood of KIFRI (2 B/NE. 24.d) owing to lack of grazing in the south and intended moving into the SHIBWANA and SANGAO (2E/S\7. 15. c) Nahiyah. As this is the winter grazing ground of the Jaf, the latter were preparing to oppose them, with arms if necessary. The authorities, however, pre vented the tribe from moving there until the Jaf had themselves left for their own summer grazing grounds (see paragraph 303 above).TUR“6 # TUR-7, TUR-8.

Visit of S haikh to LQNDQN i. The Shaikh of KUWAIT arrived in BAGHDAD 'toy Imperial Airways on 26th June and proceeded on the 28th, hy the Taurus Express and ISTANBUL route, to LONDON. During his stay in BAGHDAD he was the guest of the ’Iraq Government. His visit afforded an opportunity for dis cussion with him of smuggling from KUWAIT into 'IRAQ, which is causing the government some anxiety. in particular, the government is concerned about the rapid increase in rifles held by the EUPHRATES tribesmen, and maintains that most of the weapons are smuggled into IRAQ from KUWAIT. The Shaikh avers that he has taken the greatest pains to ensure that rifles shall not be smuggled into 'IRAQ via KUWAIT, and is of the opinion that they are finding their way in from SA'UDIA ARABIA; since it is reported that Ibn Sa'ud has experienced great difficulty in collecting from his tribesmen the rifles which were issued for the war with the YEMEN, there is probably some truth in the Shaikh’s assertion. As regards other coimnodities, the low rate of customs duties in KUWAIT compared with 'IRAQ provides a great temptation to smugglers. The Shaikh maintains that most of these smugglers are ’Iraqi subjects and that the remedy lies in the hands of the ’Iraq govern ment, which should take adequate steps to apprehend them. During the past 12 months a few caravans have been inter cepted by^ the desert police, but the majority have got through without any difficulty. It may be remarked that an exactly contrary situation exists on the Iranian frontier; the Iranian government's monopolies on tea and sugar, coupled with the restriction on imports, provide a strong inducement to smugglers from 'IRAQ, who carry on a thriving trade at a number of points alone: the frontier.SECTION VII OTHER ARAB STATES .QATAR. Further to paragraph OAS-27 of the May Sum mary of Intelligence, with the conclusion of an agree ment hetwuen the A.P.O.C. and the Shaikh to allow the company to exploit oil discovered in the QATAR penin sula, steps are being taken to see what measures are required to guarantee his protection from attack by land. As a preliminary step, a reconnaissance party on one of II.M. Sloops will visit DOHA early next month to inspect a site for a landing ground near that place. ABU DHABI. Further to paragraph OAS-21 of the May Sum mary of Intelligence, as a result of pressure which was brought to bear, no further difficulties have been raised by the Shaikh and the landing ground and petrol store have been constructed at ABU DHABI. Furthermore, the Shaikh ftas apologised for his incivility to tho Officer Commanding H.M.S. 'Fowey' in refusing to call upon him during a recent visit.SECTION IX SYRIA, P OLITICA L - I NIERILJ: . With oach disappearance of M. de Martel from SYRIA there have 'been high hopes ty the Nationalists that he will have some pronouncement of a change of policy to make on his return, hut on each occasion their hopes have proved groundless. Por some months past a state of apathy has pervaded the political outlook, and there were symptoms that a numkor of the more respon sible politicians were getting tired of the situation which has been created by the extreme Nationalists, and were quite prepared to effect some compromise rith the French authorities if suitable advances were forthcoming. The general atmosphere of discontent in SYRIA has, however, been reflected by a series of strikes on the part of different sections of the community, from the chauffeurs of the LEBANON and the merchants of BEYROUTH to the ladies of the brothel area. All passed off without any really serious incidents, but the local press in BAGHDAD reported that on 13th June, the anniv ersary of the birth of the Prophet, there had been serious^outbreaks in several places. Details are not yet available, but while in some places religious anta gonism seems to have supplied the motive, in others hostility towards the government was demonstrated, and the premier and President of the Syrian parliament ( suspended for the past 18 months) were prevented from taking their privileged seats in the mosque. INTERNAL SECURITY. The murder of Farhan al Mashur at the instig ation of the Amir Fawwaz ash Sha’alan, reported in para graph SYR-1 of the April Summary of Intelligence, has led to trouble between the Ruwalla and the Sba^, with whom Farhan’s brother had taken refuge. The Sba'a naturally refused to surrender their protege and a fight took place between sections of the two tribes. The Sba’a had previously evinced uneasiness at the presence of the Ruwalla some distance from their usual line of movement and • o consequently the French camel corps and armed cars steered the Ruwalla back to their normal grazing ground. The settlement of the Kurdish tribes in the TEL KOTGHEK area has progressed and the French author ities are digging wells for them. Some of the tribal leaders have, however, requested the postponmont of their removal until aftur the harvest. The Miran Kurds who live on the ’Iraq side of the Syrian frontier allege that the greater part of the Kurds in Syrian territory adjoining the Turkish frontier desire to cross over into TURKEY on account of the strictness of the French control and the heavy Koda and other taxes enforced.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000d5_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/294</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000d5</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/294</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 8/5 Monthly Intelligence Summaries, Iraq'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1935/1935</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-08-05T21:09:23</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (130 folios)</extent><extent>The volume is arranged chronologically.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the inside front cover and terminates at the back cover; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume contains monthly Royal Air Force (RAF) intelligence summaries from Air Headquarters, British Forces in Iraq, Hinaidi, Iraq, for the period between January and June 1935.Each report is divided into sections that relate to a particular country of the region, as follows: Iraq, Turkey, Persia (later, Iran), Kuwait, Saudi Arabia (referred to as Sa'udia), Syria, or Other Arab States (Bahrain, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi).
