Dear Weightrnan, While I was at Bahrain I 'bought a number of books dealing -onr Gulf subjects, and your Agency is probably the best equipped in this respect in the Gulf, Few officers, however, get a chance to read these books and the full benefit is not obtained from them, since many are unaware of their existence* On the other hand if a list of these books were completed some would find works of whose existence they were A unaware and buy them for their post* 2* I suggest that each Agency and Consulate (including Bushire) compiles a list of books of general interest belonging to Government in their charge and sends it to the Secretary who will then send each post a combined list of all the books that are available* Then if A is anxious to read a book in the province of B, he can write to him and ask for it. As Government pays for the postage it will cost nothing, and if each post keeps a stock of the corrugated paper booksellers use, the books will not be damaged* 3* I do not suggest that any particularly rare or valuable books, e.g. a Curzon’s Persia, should be sent backwards and forwards in this way, and it would only be appropriate if a post that lost a book refunded its published price to the lawful owner. Do you see any difficulty in carrying out this proposal ? H.Weightman Esquire, I.C.3., Political Agent, Bahrain*0.0. tio. -XO^ Dated the Both January 1940 Will you please refer to your demi-official letter No. 96 dated the 17th January 1940 in regard to Agency libraries ? 2. I see no difficulty in carrying out your proposal though I am afraid that the Bahrain library must have lost a great many boohs since you were here judging by the state of the shelves.

Dear Sirs, Please send me a copy of the book ?, A Winter in Arabia' 1 by Freya Stark, published by John Murray, 50, Albemarle Street, London, W.l. The cost etc. will be paid on receipt of your bill. for Political Agent, Bahrain« T HIS book tells first of the winter spent in the heart of the Hadhramaut excavating at Hureidha, what may have been one of the ancient cities of South Arabia.. It was the first expedition of its kind in that part of Arab and while the traces of an earlier civilisation were being uncovered Miss Stark was able to record the day to day life of an Arab town rarely visited by Europeans. Accepted as doctor, philosopher and friend she records the family life and adventures of the town. Through the humour and peculiar beauty of her prose she makes vivid the figures of the Mansab, the Sayyids, Mansur the postman and all those others amongst whom she lived. She records the news as it is brought in by beduin, of inter-trib*^ animosities, the Humimi raid, the rumours of war and the remarkable and con tinual efforts of the Aden Government and Harold Ingrams to bring peace to a country that in the past has suffered from continuous tribal strife. Her return journey was made alone to the west via the fortress at Hajlain and the country of the A 1 Dhiyaib, unknown parts which must have been trodden by the Incense traders of old. There was adventure in her return to the sea, when she joined with the Sultan’s caravan of 27 camels. This book has a particular and an additional importance since Miss Stark deals with the problems of contact between East and West which are at the present time of special urgency.

I never signed for them when I took over from Hugh nor did I hand them over to you on leaving. As regards (l) and (2) I searched lor these myself on several occasions but had to give up, I meant to write them off as irrecoverable. It is just possiole that Talia (B.Thomas’s assistant) may know something about Khali, he used to read all his books. As regards (3) (A.T. Wilson’s diary) this is a recent acquisition and I can’t think who would have read it other than our own people. Possibly Felly or Jackson might have it, the latter is rather forgetful about books. There was a register for people who took out books but sometimes they forgot to use it. I am afraid I can't give any more help than this, the first two are old absentees but the last one was purchased by me in Karachi and put into our library in October last year/’ ”1 am passing on your D.O. to Felly, who is acting for me at Muscat, in case he knows anything about the missing books and am asking him to enquire from Jackson also.”British Residency &amp; Consulate General D.G.No.1305-77/24* Bushire, the 9th November 1942.
