It is noted that the Foreign Office's refusal to pay a share of the costs of the aforementioned missions is the motivation for producing it; the India Office had expected the costs of these missions to be shared between the Imperial (i.e. London) and Indian governments.The author of the memorandum, and manuscript notes (in pencil), is Owen Tudor Burne, Secretary, Political Department.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Frederic John Goldsmid</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>border disputes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0000cf#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
