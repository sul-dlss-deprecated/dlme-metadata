Ivly dear Fowle, I venture to bother you on one or two points which have arisen on the 'special authorisations' recently issued in favour of Iniperial Airways, etc. by the sheikh of Bahrein, copies of whicn you sent us under cover of your printed despatch No. 1173-s oi 10th December. 2 . m the first place the word 'British' appears to have been omitted before the word 'nationality' in paragraph 1 in all three cases. This is no aoubt merely a clerical error. 3. secondly, paragraph Z does not lay down a time limit for the validity of 'special authorisations'. It was originally intended that there should be such a time limit (as is, I think, clear from the form of the draft 'special authorisation' prepared here after consultation- a - should he. After informal consultation with the Air Ministry we now suggest that the period in question should he one year. Ihis will of course mean that companies operating air services will have to apply annually through the usual channels for a renewal of their '‘special autnorisations”. Paragrapn 2 should therefore read 'This authorisation is limited to the period from /Insert date of issue of authorisation/ to' /“ J7 inclusive and is granted...' 4. while the points referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 above are of relatively minor importance, we think, in the light of discussion with the Air Ministry, that it would he desirable to obtain amended 'authorisations' from the sheikh of Bahrein and to ensure that any 'authorisations' issued by the sheikh of Koweit and the sultan of Muscat are in similar form. If you see no objection we should be grateful if the necessary steps might be taken. Meanwhile, the Ain Ministry will postpone any communication to Imperial Airways. 5. The Air Ministry have also raised a point in regard to paragraph 2(iii) of the 'authorisation', which/3 - 3 - which lays down that the 'authorisation' 1 or &amp; certified true copy of it shall he carried hy the aircraft. I am not sure that it has ever been made clear that it was desired that the original 'authorisations' issued under this paragraph in Bahrein (ana similarly in the case of Muscat and Koweit), should oe sent to the India Office for transmission via the Air Ministry to imperial Airways and in the present instance copies only have been received. The Air Ministry feel difficulty in certifying 'true copies' in the absence of the originals and we should therefore be grateful, if no objection is seen, if we might have originals of the authorisations now under discussion (with the amendments referred to in paragraph 3 above); and if in future originals might be sent home of any 'authorisations' issued in respect of the Gulf States. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe, and to Loch at Bahrein. Yours sincerely, J,G# LAITHWAITL.Translation of letter No*349 aateu tne lltn SNawal 1353 eimivalent to the 17th January 1935, from Shaikh Sultan oin Sa^r Ruler of Sharjah,to the Political Agent,Banrain.

My dear Fow^e, y** Would you please refer to U^orrespondence ei.dmy wi th your Printed Letter Ho.107^3 of 24, dated the 21st November 1934, sending us copies of correspondence which you had with His Majesty's Charge d-Affaires,Bagdad, regarding the landing of a French aeroplane in Bahrain without per mission. It appe rs that in this case no penalty was actually imposed upon the French aviator for his breach of the Air Navigation Regulations for the territory of Bahrain (copy received here from the India Office under cover of their No.r. I-412V1934 of 3rd August 1934). From a study of the Regulations referred to above together with those for Kuwait, and also of those more recently promulgated for tne territory of Puscat(vide enclosure to your despatch No. 1042S/34, dated the 9th November 1934, addressed to His Majesty 's Secretary of State forIndia) it seems clear that no penalties have in fact been prescribed for breach of these regulations. In all three cases Regulation No.l4(iii&gt; merely states that 'if any person contravenes or fails to comply with these Regulations or any provision thereof he shall be dealt with according to the law'. L duticulty is one of general application to Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat, while similar difficulties may also arise in the -' ex Sharjah which is a regular aerodrome, ana possibly over the other Arab States on the Truciai Coast ana in Qatar, in tne event of landings in those places. Persons contravening * ;.e regulations now in force in Kuwait, Bahrain ana Muscat v ill presumably / Ho&gt;n 1 ble Lt.-Colonel T*C.Fowled *B . rsn-p political. .Resident in the Persian ^ulx *• - : t * - 2 - k ; 3. presumably always be Europeans or other foreigners who are not subjects of the Shaikhs, and it would therefore appear possible for us to issue a King’s Regulation unuer the Order- in.Council in force in each Sheikhdom, prescribing ,enalt.es for breach of the air regulations by foreigners. I am to ask I for your views as to whether such a Regulation should now be I issued ana if so what penalties coula s-ULa.-j be ^...o.ced ' thereby. In this connection I forward for your information a I copy of the Indian aircraft Act which provides penalties for g 1 Tubreach of aircraft regulations in India. It will be seen j,, that the offence out of v^.ich the present discussion arose is similar to that penalised by section 13 of the Act. 2. With regard to Sharjah, Vi&amp;tar and the Truciax Cuafat generally there is of course no Order-in-Council in force giving extra-territorial rights to British and foreign subjects. The position is explained in your demi-official letter to Laithwaite No.1869-3, dated the 4th December lyc3. in these Sheikhdoms theoretically no doubt British and foreign subjects are unaer the Shaikh’s jurisdiction, but in actual practice we would not permit a British or foreign subjec to be dealt with by the Rulers. In this area presumably the best we could do would be to treat each case as it arises on -is merits after coming to an agreement with the Shaikh concerned for the discouragement of flights by foreign Cliicia - * ' I ' n case of Sharjah of course we already have an agreement which is confined to flights by British aircraft only, and therefore by implication discourages flights by other aircia.t. I am sending a copy of this letter to Liithwaite. Yours sincerely, sd. H.A*F.Metcalfe. cMnaS. 44. GOVERNMENT OF IN idemtial.

It seems to Sir Philip Cunlifie-Lister, however, that if the concession proposed by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is made in the form suggested oy him, it will be extremely difficult to avoid continuing it on tne same basis in connection with the Empire Air Mail SCxxeme. This would, of course, involve much larger payments than those now in question. Yith five services a weex instead of two, and having regard to the heavier type of aircraft to be used, the liability would be trebled, and would thus in each case amount to £750 per annum in addition to the annual rental of £500 pahd to each of the three nulers. 4. It is not considered that this Department should case, especially having regard to the pressure whicn is being applied to the Governments of Iraq, Palestine and be committed to payment of more than £250 a year in each India Office, S.W.l.2 . Air Mail Scheme. 5. It is suggested therefore that, in all three cases, petrol and oil should he exempted from Customs and other duties a payment being made not exceeding £250 per annum to each Ruler, in part compensation, although it should be clearly provided that this payment will be the maximum whatever the actual consumption of petrol and oil may be. It seems essential to make it clear that the agreement will cover the extended frequency of services visualised in 1937 onwards. 6. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister presumes that if this suggestion commends itself to Lord Zetland there would be no diffl culty in securing an amendment of the current Civil Air Agreements or, alternatively, in negotiating fresh agreements, say, for a period of five years from 1st January 1936. 7. It seems preferable that a similar arrangement for the payment of this 'compensation” should, if possible, be made in all three cases. The present procedure in Muscat, under which the Sultan is called upon to make a substantial disbursement annually, tends to focus his discontent. 8. The object which the Political Agent has in view would in this manner be equally well achieved as each Ruler would b enefit to the extent of ^250 per annum. On the other hand, excessive liability for Air Funds in connection with the Empire Air Mail Scheme would be avoided. 9. In regard to refundment of duties under the current Muscat Agreement, I am to forward herewith a copy of a letter dated 21st August from Imperial Airways Limited. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister will be glad to be furnished with any observations that Lord Zetland may wish to offer with reference to the second paragraph. 10.

THR fittiPKBPTTAHY 19^5 My deal- Powle, Vkoula you pleas# refer to the correspondence ending with your printed letter No.l072-S ol 34. dateo the Plst November 1934, sending us copies of correspondence which you had with Kin Hajfefty’e Oterje’ n*Affaires, Bagdad, regarding the landing of a French aeroplane in Bahrain without permiston. It appears that in thin caee no penalty was actually imposed upon the French aviator for his breach of *he Air Savijation Regulations tor the territory of Bahrain (copy received here from the India Office under cover of their No.?.2.4121/1934 of 3rd August 1934). Nrom a etudy of the Regulations referred to above together with those for Kuwait, and also of those more recently promuj-gateo fcr the territory of Muscat (vine enclosure to your Despatch Ho. 1042-S/34, dated the 9th November 1934, addressed to His jfaiesty's Secretary of State for Inoia) it seems clear that no penalties have in fact been prescribed for breach of. these regulations. In all three cases Reguli tion No.i4(iii) merely states that 'if any person contravenes or faile to comply with these Regulations or any provision thereof he shall be dealt w*h according to the Taw*. The difficulty is one of general application to Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat, while similar difficulties may also arise in the case of Sharjah which is a regular aerodrome, and possibly over the other Arab States on the Trucial Coast and in Qatar, in the event of landings in those places. Persons contravening the regulat ion, nG w in force in Kuwait. Bahrain ana JS.scat will presumably always be Knropeans or other foreigners who are not subjects of the Shaikhs, and it would therefore appear possible for us to issue a King* s Regulation under the Order-in-Council in i orce ir. each Shaikhdom. prescribing penalties for breach of the air regulations by foreigners. I am to a S k for your views as to whether such a Regulation should now be issued And if so wnat penaltiescould suitably be enforced thereby. In thin connection I forward for your Information a copy of the Inulan Aircraft Act which provides penalties for breach of aircraft regulations in India. It will be seen that the offence out of which the present discuss ion arose is similar to that penalised by section 15 ci the Act. 2. With regard to Sharjah, Qatar and tho Truoial Coast, generally there is of course no Order-in-Council in force giving extra territorial rights to British and foreicnsnojects. The position is explained in your demi-oificial letter to Laitdwaite H0.1&amp;69-S, datea the 4th December 1933. In these Sheikhdoms theoretically no doubt British and foreign aubje cts are under the Shaikh*s jurisdiction, but in actual practice we would not permit a Britfe h of foreign subject to he dealt wit h by the Rulers In this area presumably the beat we could do would be to treat each case as it arises on its.merits after coming to an agreemert with the Shaikh concerned for the cis ouragement of flights by foreign aircraft. In the case of Sharjah of course we already have an agreement which is confined to flights by British air craft only, and therefore by implication discourages flights by other aircraft. 3.

You 'wiy care to have these interim oboeTrrattone* which Y/e had he;.e in the spring oj 1934 and at which you (and also Prior) were present.

So far a.-, the actual Montaigu case is concerned I am rather inclined to think that it my be simplest to let it drop (since, as you will remember, it was on the one hand r i* nnt to ;rivfc teontaiftu a reasonably, irienoly bleaches of the Air Navigation Regulations in Bahrain, Kuwait a* The regulations in qestion are based on the dtonsaions ut much farther forward).2 5 ./ able by a fine not exceeding £.200 or by i/npriponnaent not exceeding «ix months# or oy both a line no traprisonnient.

Frima facie , therefore, though we nave there would seem to be no obstacle, assuming that not considered tho matter closely, ^the local ruler had i irst agreed to the imposition of penalties on nuch lines as we mi{ rxt deciae to recommend, to the raakeing of Kiog , s Fegulsttone unaer Article 70(b) of the Bahrain Order and Article 83(b) of the Kuwait Order 'for securing the observance... of any native or local law, or custom, whether relating to trade, commerce. revenue, or any other matter', ie.As this case# such penal provisions for a breach of the Air Navigation Regulations as might be made by the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain. The Orders in Council in question further provide that such King’s Regulations may provide lor forfeiture of goods (e.g- in case the offending aircraft) end bhat broaches of the King*s Regulationr may he punished by imprieonra^nt not exceeairg three months or by a fine not exceeding Rs.lbOO. or by both# imprisonment and a fine. Subject to closer examination it looks on the whole as tho-gh t would be possible fa us to advise the Rulers to make provision for a fine of up to IbOO (alternative punishment of imprisonment or forfeiture of A the aircraft teing kept in reserve for use in particularly i lagrant cases).b. MuBcat i^• of course, in a rtifj erent position, since the extent of e6h$ Juriediction over foreigners ana their property appears to be governed by Article 6 (3), (4) m ci (*,) of the Muecat Order in Council, and our jurisdiction over foreigners ir for ^xxxx practical purposes confinert tecaeee where the Covernant whose *ub#cts they are hae H agreefc with Hie Majesty^# lor or ronseTited to the exercise of prwer or authority by His Majesty*. Tt locks at first eight as though we hacs no jurie* diction at all over property belonging to foreigners? in Muscat* Subject to these reservations the arrangements for making King^ ReguAtions under the Musc-t Order in Council are similar to thore in the case of Bara 4 n anS l* wouau appear In turte ciioumstancee as though any penalties 3a id down for the contravention by persons other than British subjecta or individuals covered by the Order in Council of the Muscat Air Navigation Regulations would have to be imposed by the Muscat authorities themselves, but difficulties in securing that they should on our advice make provision for appropriate penalties on the same basis as referred +o above in the case of Kuwait and Bahrain would not presumably be serious* b. The Truoial Coast ana Qatar are, oi course, as Metcalfe points out, more difficult becawne oi the absence of an Orcier in council giving ex-territorial rights to British sort foreign «ubj -ects. But ( nave poeeiblywin Qatar) the point is perhaps oi less immediate active importance, since, at thi; stage at any rate, there are perhaps likely to be fewer a tempts by or inducements to private civil aircraft to endeavoxui to land there than in the case oi Bahrain Kuwait o. r possibly Muscat* 7.

I now enclose copies of letters from the Foreign Office and the Air Ministry, From Foreign Office dated 7th J from which you will see that tk September 1935* ) ) they are in general agreement From Air Ministry dated 11th ) September 1935, ) with the proposals mentioned m —' ' my letters of the 2nd August* The next step is, therefore, to prepare a draft of the Regulations 1 0 be issued by the Sultan of Muscat, and draft Kings Regulations in respect of Bahrain, Kuwait and Muscat, on the lines already agreed demi-officially with the resident and the Government of India. «e should be glad if you co^ld now take the necessary action in this sense and submit the drafts officially to the Government of India and the Secretary of State for approval* These Regulations should specify the penalties, in accordance with the various Orders in Council, to which an offender against the regulations may be liable, vizi 'forfeiture of any goods, receptacles or things in relation to which any breach is committed of such regulations ' (in this caee the offending aircraft); imprisonment for a period not exceeding 3 months; or a fine not / Hon^le •—Col*P.G»Loch,C• I • K•, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Bushire*not exceeding 1,500 rupees; or both imprisonment and a fine. 2 . Tith regard to the suggestion that refuelling facilities mi^ht be refused as an additional penalty (vide paragraph 6 of 3ferd , i letter of 7th September), Fowle, with whom the question has been discussed, has suggested that a provision of this sort would be superfluous if regulations are issued on the lines suggested above. He suggests that in practice a guard would probably be placed over the offending aircraft in the event of a breach of the regulations, and thet the machine (if not confiscated) would only be released after the appropriate penalty had been extracted from . the offender. 5, As regards the regulations to be issued by the Sultan of Muscat, we agree with paragraph 2 of Ward’s letter, 4. I am sending a copy of this letter to Acheeon. Yours sincerely, sd. -tL.J»Claus on.4. / P.Z. 6368/36. Copy. (5 4759/17/91) PORSIGN OP?ICE, 7th September 1935* Dear Clauaon, In Rendcl 1 a abeence on leave X am replying to your letter Ko.P.Z.4701/35 of the 2nd August about the penalties to be imposed on aviators breaking the Air Navigation regulations for the Arab States in the Persian Gulf. 2 . rfe agree generally with the proposals you have worked out in conjunction with Fowls. As regards Muscat # we think that it is clear that the only way to proceed is to induce the Sultan to make a regulation with the appropriate penalties, which he wil have to enforce himself on those foreigners who come within his jurisdiction. From a practical point of view, it is, of cotrse, essential that the Political Resident should approve the substance of the regulation and the penalties contained in them, but this point will be safeguarded if the regulation }s drafted by the Resident and if he can subsequently ensure that the Sultan would consult the Political Agent beiore taking any action against a foreign aviator. 3. In order to deal with persons under our own jurisdiction we agree that a King’s Regulation will have to be made under Article 78 of the Muscat Order-in-Council, a translation of the Sultan of Muscat’s Air Navigation Regulations being annexed to it, and the King’s Regulation stating that they are binding on the persons specified in Article 8 (l), (2) and (3) of the Order-in-Council. The Regulation should then prescribe the penalties for breach of the conditions governing air navigation, and Beckett points out that it is important to note tnat the possible penalties are limited by the terms of Article 79 of the &lt;-rder-dn-Council, which hould be borne in mind in preparing the draft.- 2 - 4* We agree that it is not necessary at the present moment to do anything as regards the Trucial sheikhdoms. The only one of these where it seems likely that we may taave to make air navigation regulations in the fairly near future and therefore to prescribe penalties of this sort is probably Qatar; we should presumably be able to do this in the same wa^ through a King's Kegulation # In accordance with the provision for issuing King's Regulations which will doubtless be embodied in the prospective Qatar Order-4n-Council 0 n the lines of Articles 83-85 of the Kuwait Order-in-Council. 5. We agree with your proposals in regard to Bahrain and Kuwait, but Beckett points out that the King's Regulations must of course be drafted so as to conform with the provisions of the Order-in-Council under which they are made, namely Articles 70 and 71 a! in the case of Bahrain, and 83 and 84 in the case of Kuwait. 6. Vv’e notice that your proposals allow for the penalties being those authorised by the respective Ordere-in-Council (with the exception of penalties for foreigners in Muscat where the Sultan will issue a special regulation)» but we are not clear as to how you intend to bring in the possible refusal of re-fuelling facilities* It will presumably be easy for the Sultan of Muscat to include this among the penalties imposed by his own regulation, but the Orders-in-Council do not appear to cover a penalty of this sort, (although the mention in them of 'forfeiture' would presutaably cover the actual seizure of an aeroplane). It would seem however that the refusal of refuelling facilities must be dealt with by some order binding on the authorities of the aerodrome where the refuelling would take place i.e. not as part of the penalties but in the other part of the regulations. 7. /7 * tfe agree that the next stage should be for the Resident to be invited to prepare drafts of the necessary regulations v and we presume that you will let us see them as soon as they are available* (sd•) J.G.WARDP.i.8368/55. 413 095,/1'5/C.

When R.A.i. planes alight there a guard remains there day and night. This has been done voluntarily by the Bahrain government which has defrayed the cost of transport to and from the aerodrome. Imperial Airways machines now land here four times a week and I understand that soon the number of services will be increased. The police are fully occupied with their other duties and as it is no longer possible to use the Muharraq municipal transport tne State has to hire cars for sending them to the aerodrome. I enquire whether the Imperial Airways could not provide their own aerodrome guardor whether, if this is impossible, they could not be asked to pay for the provision of the police guard. I do not think it is customary in other countries for the govern ment to provide a police guard on aerodromes used for Civil Aviation.

Sir, I am directed Ly the Secretary of State for India to refer to Air Ministry letter of 31st August. No. S. 329562/D.D.C.A. regarding the Bahrein, Koweit an* Muscat Civil Air Agreements. 2. The Marquess of Zetland notes that Lord Swinton concurs in his view regarding the desirability ox revising the financial provisions of these Agreements, but as regards the form which this revision should take he would invite attention to the political resident s Express Letter of 27th Mcvember, 1935, No. 894-S./1935, a copy of which was forwarded to the Air Ministry under India Office printed letter of 9th December, No. P.Z.8744/35. 3. Lora Zetland agrees generally with the views expressed by Colonel Fowle; in particular he feels that the compensatory payment should bear a close relation to the amount of duty which the Rulers actually surrender, and should not be limited to an arbitrary figure such as £250 which can hardly fail to be regarded by the Rulers as quite inadequate when the Empire Air Mail service is instituted. He is therefore inclined to favour Colonel Fowle’s first suggestion, i.e. that the sum paid annually to the Rulers should be equal to a 5 per cent, customs duty paid on the actual amount of fuel imported in that year. 4. If, however, this proposal is unacceptable to the Air Council on account of the unfortunate repercussions which it might have on negotiations in respect of Secretary, Air Ministry, S.W.l.2 . /oy other territories in the Middle East, His Lordship would readily consider some arrangement wherebya lump sum would be paid annually to the Rulers, which would have no overt connection with the exemption from duty, though in fact based roughly on the amount of fuel consumed. Existing figures for the importation of fuel for the use of Imperial Airways are no doubt available to the Air Council and would serve as a basis for calculating this sum, which would increase in proportion to the amount of fuel actually imported. For instance, a sum representing roughly the value of the ^resent exemption would be appropriate until the commencement of the Empire Air Mail, and a proportionately increased sum thereafter. 5. As Colonel Fowle foresees no difficulty in bringing the existing procedure in Muscat into uniformity with the procedure proposed for Bahrein and Koweit, it has been assumed in this letter that his proposals would a.-ply to all three States. 6. His Lordship d^es not propose at this stage to suggest the actual alterations to Clauses 15 and 16 of the Koweit and Bahrein and Clauses 15 and 17 of the Muscat Heads of Agreement, which it would be necessary to make in order to give effect to his proposals. But there would be no difficulty in doing this once agreement has been reached on the form and amount of the payment which is to be made. 7. I am therefore to enquire whether the Air Council are prepared to reconsider the matter with a view to achieving an early settlement on the general lines suggested above, the details of which can be arranged by3 inter-departmental discussion. 8.

To:- The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Arrangements for policing the Landing Ground at Government have approached me regarding arrangements for policing the Landing Ground at Muharraq. 2, Hitherto it has been the custom for the Bahrain Government to supply a police guard, usually consisting of one non-commissioned officer and five or six other ranks of the Police Force, for duty at the Muharraq Landing ground on every occasion on which it is used by aeroplanes. Yhen aeroplanes of the Royal Air Force stay there, the guard remains on duty day and night. The Bahrain Government have done this voluntarily and have defrayed the cost of transport to and from the Landing Ground. 3. The Bahrain Government point out that aeroplanes of Imperial Airways now land at Muharraq four tames a week and that there are also frequent visits by aeroplanes ol the Royal Air Force, so that the provision of guards at the Landing Ground, which is some distance from the ordinary Muharraq Sir I have the honour to inform you that the Bahrain /policepolice posts, involves withdrav.'ing police from their normal duties and training. It is, moreover, no longer possible to use Muharraq Municipal transport and the State has, therefore, to hire private cars at some expense to send the police to the handing Ground. 4. The Bahrain Government ask that the cost of the police guard shall in future be borne by the users of the Landing Ground. 5 . I regard this request as reasonable in jjrinciple, as the duties of keeping clear the ground, of protection to aircraft and of maintaining order, should occasion arise, should, for political and other reasons, be performed by the Bahrain Governments Police, and in view of the isolated position of the Landing Ground and of the conditions which obtain in Bahrain, it is hardly appropriate to throw the burden of the increasing cost on the Bahrain Government. 6 . The cost of a guard of a non-commissioned officer and five other ranks is estimated to be:- Pay, rations and clothing of one non-commissioned officer. Rs.43/-p.m. Pay, rations and clothing of five other ranks at Rs 58/- per man. Io0/-p.m., or a total of Rs.P55/- &amp; month. 7. As, hov;ever, the guard is not recuired except when aircraft are-using the Landing Ground, the Bahrain Government offer to provide a guard of one non-commissioned officer and five other ranks, including transport, for Rs 10/- a day for each day or part of a day on which theyare en^loyed. For this purpose they would increase the strength of the Police Porce and themselves utilize the men on other duties v;hen not required at the landing Ground. 7 . I recommend that the principle of paying for the guard should be accepted. The form in which the payment should be made, that is, whether in a lump sum of Rs ?3o/- a month or at Rs 10/- a da^ for the days on which the guard is employed, seem to be one for the choice of the users of the Landing Ground.

Sir, I have the honour to forward to you copies of correspondence between the Director of Customs and Port Officer, Bahrain, and the Manager, Meso potamia Persia Corporation, Limited, Bahrain, regarding a claim made by the Corporation as Agents of Imperial Airways Limited, for a refund of customs duty upon petrol and oil which was supplied by the local agent of the Anglo Persian Oil Company, Limited, to the aeroplanes at the Maharaq aerodrome. 2. The agents of Imperial Airways Limited ask for a refund of duty on oil ana petrol from the date of the arrival of the first Imperial Airways aeroplane in Bahrain, i.e., 6th October 1932, presumably by virtue of clause 15 of the Civil Air Agreement. 3. The oil and petrol was not imported by Messrs. Mesopotamia Persia Corporation on behalf of —of the Imperial Airways Company but was obtained by Imperial Airways from the local agent of the Anglo Persian Oil Company, who supplied them out of his stock after having paid the usual customs duties on his imports. No oil or petrol has as yet been imported by Imperial Airways Company or by Mesopotamia Persia Cor poration as their agents. 4. The Civil Air Agreement was made and its clauses came into effect from 6th June 1934 although the Imperial Airways Company paid this government for the use of the aerodrome from the date on which it was first used by them; con sequently a claim for a refund of the customs duties on oil and petrol should not have been made for the period before the Civil Aviation Agreement came into force. 5. I should be obliged if you would give me your views on this subject. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Adviser to the Government.4-~- lif Copy of letter No. CTAlPC/lA-l/329 dated 8th February 1936, from the Director of Customs and Port Officer, Bahrain to the Adviser to the Government or Bahrain.

In this connection I would remark:- Imperial Airways Ltd., do not import into Bahrain petrol and oil, but are supplied by the local agents of the Anglo Persian Oil Company Limited with their needs out of the quantities imported by such agents. It is the rule that only the importer may obtain goods free of duty, if so entitled, but not the individual to whom he sells such imports. The Civil Air Agreement was dated the 6th June 1934, and the privileges which Imperial Airways Ltd., receive under that Agreement are not retrospective. I should be glad to be favoured with your opinion on these points, please.True Copy. The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited, No. L/155. Bahrain, 6th February 1936.

Enquiries into matter of refunding customs duty on petrol and oil to Imperial Airways (see your Express better of ’ November S7th, 895-S) has disclosed to Bahrain Government insig^nfleant sum which now^ remains to them in return for Civil Air Agreement. Even this sum is more than swallowed up by the cost of police arrangements a£ landing ground (see my letter of February Pnd, C/59-13/7). 9 P. I have asked Adviser informally to postpone mentioning matter to Shaikh for a few days and would urge that I be authorized at once to inform Shaikh that proposals for increasing the payments for extra services are under consideration (see your Express Letter 994-S November P7th) and that whatever increase is made will be paid from the date of institution of duplicate services. 3. This course seems to me imperative in view of our probable desire to renew Civil Air Agreement in 1938 &amp;P and of necessity for removing any cause of grievance before French and butch aeroplanes start to use this route. T should emphasise that Ehaikh and Family were loathe to agree to foregoing actual customs duty and they will certainly regard financial effect agreement disclosed as justifying their apprehensions.

Bush ire, Bahrain Civil M r Agreettent, Sir, I have the honour to refer to my telegram dated the irth November 1956 regarding the amount payable to the Bahrain Government under the terms of the Civil Air Agreement. 2* A copy is enclosed of a letter No s 1248/21 dated trie 11th February 1956 from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, with enclosures. The Bahrain Government consider that any refund of customs duty on petrol and oil should take ~aco ^rom the date of the signing of the Civil Air Agreement, that is to say, from the 6th June 1954• 5 . I am inclined to su port their viev, for though it would be logical to argue that, if the sum of £ 500 a year v*as paid with retrospective effect from the date of the first land ing of Imperial Airways’ aeroplanes at Bahrain, so should the refund of customs duty be given from tnat date, yst when the payments were made with retrospective effect, they were made with the object (a) of encouraging the Shaikh and his B £m ily to accept a principle (exemotion from customs duty) to which they objected, and (b) of redressing the sense of grievance which was felt at our long usage of the Banding around without proper /arrange merit s •arrangements. Nothing was said at the time about reducing these earlier sums by a refund of customs duty. A demand now for such &amp; refund would certainly cause much surprise to the Shaikh and his Family. In the circumstances I would reconuDerK' t .at the refund of customs duty should be asked for only from the date of the signature of the Civil. .Air Agreement. 4. I learn informally from the Bahrain Government that the customs duty on the petrol and oil is to the nearest pound: Petrol. Oil. lots. 1955. S 115 5 ISO 1934. £ 117 7 1S4 1335. £ £19 11 230 Though the amount of the customs duty to be refunded for the single service is approximately as estimated, in the second paragraph of my letter No:C/180-7/£ dated the 5th ^erch 1954, the services have been increased without any proportionate increase in the lump sum payment, and I would add that in the sixth paragraph of that letter I recommended that a separate arrangement should be made for the policing of the handing Ground, the cost of which now falls on the State. I thin^;, therefore, that the early adoption of a system of payment, such as is recommended in your Fx »ress Letter No:8 dated the F7th November 1355 and also consideration of the incidence of cost of the policing (see my letter NotC/59-15/7 dated the Nnd February 13o6) is imperatively necessary* 5. I would venture finally to ask that these questions oay be viewed rather from the political than from ft commercial standpoint. For purposes of our own we pressed our friends. Shaikh Sir Hamad bin * Isa A1 Khalifah and his Family, to acceptan arrangement oyer customs duty for which there was in their eyes no reason (clearly, it is impossible to explain that we are concealing our dealings with them in order to avoid having them quoted as a precedent for paying customs duty to others) and of which they were frankly nervous. They now find that the* expected lump sum is diminished by the doubled service and that further services are to be instituted, and that, in addition, they have had to beer the cost of policing the Ending Ground. Such circumstances, unie^ we ourselves amend them, cannot fail to harm us in the eyes of those who are our friends and on whose goodwill we base our policy on the Arab hittoral. 1 beg earnestly that v/e should avoid this harm by offering the Shaikh at once and of our own accord fresh terms to me#t the chan.ed circumstances.

We have no objection to the sheikh of Bahi'ein being informed that the question of making an increased payment as compensation for customs exemption granted in respect of fuel imported for the use of imporiai Airwaye is being dealt with as a matter of urgency. We do not consider, however, that any reference should be made to increasing payments with effect from the date of duplication of the services unless the political Beeident deems it essential to do so, as this would imply that we accept the principle of proportionality which we desire to avoid. If colonel Fowls still deems it necessary to give such an indication, despite this difficulty, we will raise no objection. it should, we suggest, be made clear that the determination of the amount of the increase is dependent on discussion with the Treasury but that the most sympathetic consideration will be given to the representations made by the Folitioal Hesident subject to the over-riding necessity for avoiding prejudice to other negotiations in connection with the Empire Air iiail Scheme. the 18th instant, No. P.2M 1192/36, on the subject of the S. ,v.l.

Would you please refer to your letter No.c/81-13/7 dated the 17th February 1936 on the subject of the Bahrain Civil Air Agreement. I do not think that we can support the Bahrain Governments claim that refund of customs duty on petrol and oil should take place from the date of the signing of the Civil Air Agreement, that is to say, from the 6th June 1934* 2. I think that you have perhaps taken into account two other, entirely separate issues: (i) the increase of the subsidy contemplated by His Majesty’s Government; (ii) the policing of the landing ground. (i) is under consideration of His Majesty’s Government, vide N; correspondence ending with my telegram No. 185 of 26th February, and (ii) is dealt with in my demi-official letter N0.132-S of the 17th February. 3. Article 16 of the Bahrain Civil Air Agreement expressly states that the annual S500 covers the exemption of oil and petrol from customs duty. As Belgrave admits, the £500 ’was paid retrospectively to 6th October 1932; sc there seems to be a clear case for Imperial Airways claiming a refund of duty to that date. 4. With regard to the point raised by Belgrave that Imperial Airways do not import into Bahrain petrol and oil, but are supplied by the local agents of the Anglo-lranian Oil Company with their needs out of the quantities imported by such agents. I do not think that this can be advanced Lionel Gordon Loch,CIE., as / Political Agent, Bahrain.- 2 - as a valid objection, unless the Bahrain Government can show that they have suffered loss in same way by the Imperial Airways getting their petrol and oil through the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company instead of direct. 5. Please discuss the above points with Belgrave and I will have a talk with you both on my approaching visit to Bahrain. O^CTUA/i Wvv^/uA I „ V. •4 - CONFIDENTIAL. No. C/26 of 1936.

MIHISTiOT OF HiiaLTH, A’HIT-Jtyj-L, S. ;,.i* E9th January, 1936. Dear Burkett, We recently ruoeivecL Irom the Ollice International d^Hj^iene publique a notification of an outbreak oi ama±lpox at Sharjah in the Persitm Gulf. X had oooasion last weels while in lariB to see Dr. Alt, the Director of the Office International d'Hygiene publique, i and discussed the atter with hiin. The oi'i^in of the inlor .iation received at the Paris Office was a letter dated the 6th January, signed by Or. Barrett Heggs on_behalf of the Director-General of Health, Iraq. A copy of thie letter is annexed. From it f / ,, ^ you will see that some 750 cases of smallpox are alleged to have occurred in six small towns in the area during the past few || weeks. The information was first obtained from tne principal Medical officer, Iraq coimmna, B*A*F., Baghdad, who telephoned to Dr. Heggs on the 30th trep^emher reporting the outbreak of the disease. Dr. He^gs communicated at once with the Imperial Airways Company at Baghdad, and by arrangement with them the Principal Medical Officer, B.A.F., kindly sent a Medical Officer by airplane from Baghdad to Sharjah. Certain pioventive measures -were subsequently taken with the result that the civil Health Administration, Baghdad, were able to wire to Karachi, Palestine and Alexandria to the effect that vaccination had been -carried out and tnat it was considered that the only meaair#* neceesary were surveillance of air passengers and crewr who had stopped at Sharjah. In another letter from Dr. Hegge to Dr. Abt, alto dated the 6th January, a copy of which is annexed, you will note the remark that an epidemiological information service within the Gulf ie badly needed and that this can only be arranged int ornut ionally•The outbreak of smallpox at Sharjah raises a number of questions in regard to the application of the International Sanitary Convention and of quarantine of air traffic generally in the Persian Culf. 1 fear I was unable to give dr. Abt any information on the matter, since 1 know nothing of the circumstances! what Covernm. nt or Governments ore responsible for sanitary administration along the southern shore of the reraian Gulf; are theru any local administrative authorities, and what are the actual measures for medical supervision and quarantine of airoaft, their crews and passengers, in the aerodromes in the region? Dr. Abt has prepared a note on the territorial status of areas in the Persian Gulf in which there are aerodromes of the Imperial Airways Company, but he is not sure whether the information he gives is accurate. The subject will in ail probability be referred to at the next session of the Paris Office in May, particularly in regard to the authorities responsible for sanitary control in the aerodromes, the danger of infection of the aerodromes from without, especially by local inhabitants, and finally the possibility of establieh-ng a service of epidemiological information for the area. Although 1 do not know the circumstances, some doubt is raised in my mind as to whether the J-raq health Services and the H.A.P. in Iraq have any mandate to occupy themselves with health conditions in the- Persian Gurf. But perhaps this is a local arrangement concluded between Iraq and Imperial Airways. Yuurs sincerely. (Sd.)W.T. MOBGAffCOPY. iBW of Interior \ic Health Directorate i^dac ’Irak’, i BY AIK MA IL. Bo.

I wish to draw your attention to the fact that epidemiological information from the Gulf is bad. On a previous occasion also in 1932 the only information of a severe outbreak oj- smallpox near Bahrein was a corai rani cat ion from the Koyal Air Force of Irac* who had seen a large encampment while flying down the Gulf and had landed to discover a large collection of cases entirely unattended to and unknown. S tallpox is endemic in these areas but more important here is the question of cholera which may enter the Gulf from India and be equally unknown for a long time. An Epidemiological information service within the Gulf is 'badly needed# This can only be arranged internationally. In 1932 we approached all known medical officers anvl missionary before throughout the Gulf to endeavour to establish a mutual arrangement but nothing came of it. In view of the Air Service in addition to the Sea traffic the matter is worthy of serious consideration. I wish to express ray indebtedness to the kindness of the IhA.F. vha have assisted us in these matters in the past so readily. r| ( U8l/X936* 'i « I39J Tsq £81 89H tu j 13449/36 /a. D.C. A.

Sir, I am directed by Mr. secretary 4den to state, for the information of the i^arqueas of wetland, that certain correspondence regarding an outbreak of smallpox at Sharjah, in the Persian Gulf, which has been communicated semi-officially to this department by Ur. M.l'. Morgan ox the Ministry of Health, raises the question of the sanitary administration at aerodromes on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf. It is understood that Ur. Morgan has communicated unoxficialxy to Major-General dir John lAegaw copy of the correspondence in question. a. The international Sanitary convention for Aerial navigation, signed at the Hague, Ikth April, 1933, come into force on the 1st August, 1935 (Treaty Series Ho.19 (1935) Cmd.4938). According to the terms of the excluding declaration made at the time of signature by the United Kingdom pleni potentiary under paragraph 1 of Article 65, the convention is not applicable to British colonies and protectorates unless notice nae been given by Hie Majesty's Government in the United L Kingdom that it is desired to apply the convention to any of these territories. Although, therefore, the convention is not applicable to the Arab States of the Persian Gulf which a re under British protection (and in Mr. Eden's view all these territories are from -he ixiternationa! point oi view under British protection, except Muscat), Mr. Eden is of opinion tnat it is open to Hie Majesty's Government to give the required notice in respect of these States, including Bahrain and Under- secretary of State, IHU1A OFFICE2. Koweit, but excluding Muscat. I,aiu to point out. However, that the convention prescribes certain measures which ore to be taJcen by the contracting parties, and to refer in this connexior to Articles 3 and 7. These measures should ordinarily be taken before the Convention is applied to the territories concerned. 3. Mr. Kden would be glad to receive the views of the Marquess of Zetland as to the advisability of such notice being- given on behalf of the Arab states of the Persian Gulf under Britisli protection. 4. If it ie thought inadvisable to do this either because His Majesty* e Government in the United Kingdom have not previously extended conventions to the Gulf states under the colonial articles of conventions and this may lead to suggestions for other extensions (such as the Sanitary Convention itself ) which may be undesirable, or because, owing to the fact that the native rulers enjoy internal independence and have in most cases only somewhat jr imitive machinery of government, His Majesty*s Government oould not be sure that conventional obligations undertaken would be fulfilled, it may nevertheless be desirable that it should be possible for the Ministry of Health to give to the international Public Health Office assurances to the following effect: (1) that in the aerodromes used by Imperial Airways on the Gulf all the usual health precautions will be taken; and (£) that the Political He eluent e arid Political Agents in the Gulf will use their best efforts to see that the ordinary sanitary precautions are taken in the territories of the Arab states there and th&amp;t information relating to these States, of the kind which is usually supplied to the international Office relating to territories where the sanitary conventions fM|j.3. apply, will as far as possible be comiaui ieated to the Of lice through the ministry of Health or if the Marquees of wetland prefers through the GOTernment of India.

In the first place it may be as well to indicate what is the present machinery for dealing with the sanitary administration of the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf. (On the Iranian coast this Residency has of co\irse no responsibility: the quarantine administration being en tirely in the hares of the Iranian medical authorities). At Pushire there is a Residency Surgeon of the I.M.S., wno is the Chief Quarantine Medical Officer for the Coast in question, end who has immediately under him at Pushire an Assistant Surgeon. At Kuwait, Pabr-. i' snd Muscat, besides the Political Agents, there are Assistant Surgeons of the who are Quarantine Medical Officers for the local Rulers, (from whom they receive an allowance for these duties), and who work under Residence Surgeon by whom their activities are co-ordina- From To Repeated No.-2- 2. The two weak links in the chain are the Trucial Coast, where we have a Residency Agent but no Medical Officer 111 and Gwadur, which though belonging to Muscat is situated on and the Baluchistan coast,/where though there is a Residency Agent there is also no Medical Officer, Moreover the Gwadur aerodrome is situated some twelve miles inland from the town. I have suggested that an Assistant Surgeon should be posted at Sharjah for work on the Trucial Coast, but there are financial difficulties in the way of this proposition and the question is under the consideration of the Government of India and His Majesty 1 s Government - vide correspondence ending with Government of India letter No.F.31 (5)-E/35 of the 5th Up, hi v- February 1936. 3. The Assistant Surgeons at Kuwait and Bahrain have in the past attended to the Sea Services and have now extended their duties to the Air Services under the Civil Air Agreemente between His Majesty^ Government and the two Rulers concerned.! The Assistant Surgeon at Muscat, ov/ing to the Gwadur aerodrome | being on the opposite coast, is unable to do any work in connection with the Air Services. 4. With regard to the smallpox epidemic out of which the present correspondence has arisen, the course of events was as follows. &lt;yp, ^ ‘On the 30th December 3 935 in a telegr am to me in connection witha proposed flight of aircraft along the Trucial Coast, the Air Officer Commanding, Bagdad, mentioned that the flight might have to avoid Sharjah owing to small hox. /Ju^n the same day I received a telegram from the Political Agent, Bahrain, that smallpox had broken out on the Trucial Coast /M 0 i p -3- Coast and telegraphed to the Political Agent, Bahrain, that the Residency Agent, Sharjah, with whom he is in wireless touch, should arrange with the Shaikh of Sharjah and Imperial Airways Station Superintendent to isolate the Imperial Airways Rest House from the town, , On the 31st December the Air Officer town. . . on .the ,31st v&gt; /M yw.kj % T ra pned to me t list he v/as sending a Medical Commanding telegrap] Officer by Imperial Airways* plane' of that date to vaccinate all personnel of the Rest House. This te'legram was repeated to the Political Agent, Bahrain, and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, so all who were locally concerned knew what was % happening. On the 4th January,having obtained from the L/ f ^Residency Agent through the Political Agent, Bahrain, the number of cases and deaths, I sent the foiiov/ing telegram addressed: Government of India, repeated Minister Tehran, Consul Basra for information of Port Health Officer, Vice Consul Khorramshahr for information of Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, Port Health Officers, Karachi, Bombay and Aden, Imperial Airv/ays Karachi and Cairo. For information. Trucial Coast including Sharjah and Dibai infected with smallpox 755 cases 89 deaths. In addition I gave the same Information to the local Iranian Medical Authorities here, and local Shipping Agents. Since the 4th January the Air Officer Commanding, Bagdad, and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf,(since their aero planes and ships have to visit the Crucial Coast frequently), the two local authorities most concerned, have been sent a weekly telegram giving cases and deaths. The epidemic is on the decrease, and when the Residency Surgeon considers that the Trucial Coast can be declared free of smallpox concerned will be duly informed. 5. It will be seen that the third addressee of my telegram quoted /-4- it7 quoted above was Cons\il Basra for information of the Port Health Officer, who presumably passed the information on to the Public^ Health Directorate of Iraq. Dr. Barrett Eeggs 1 statement therefore at the beginning of paragraph 2 of his letter of 6th January to the Ministry of Interior, Public Health Directorate at Bagdad, Iran, that Tt epideffliological information from the Gulf is bad', is entirely incorrect. On the 4th January when there were adequate details in my possession as to the extent of the outbreak (merely to telegraph that an outbreak had occurred without giving some indication o^ deaths and cases would be of little use. especially as smallpox is endemic along the Arab Coast) I 31 Vv. 'iffy telegraphed the ^information to all concerned. Dr. Barrett Reggs makes no mention of this latter telegram though presumably he was informed of it by the Port Health Officer, Basra. There is no need for an Epidemiological information service within the Gulf to be arranged internationally, as suggested by Dr. Barrett Heggs. The machinery detailed 4 r paragraph 1 above is ouite adequate, and in the present instance has worked well. The vaccination at Sharjah referred to in Dr.Barrett {eggs 1 letter bf 6th January 1936, No.H.366, to the Ministry The vacc: eggs 1 let^ijr oJ &gt;f Interior, Public Health Directorate, Bagdad, was carried &gt;ut partly by the Royal Air Force Medical Offiqer referred^ :o in the Air Ofticer^Com^^^ ' December, partly by the 'station Superintendent, Imperial Airways, and partly by a vaccinator and the Assistant Surgeon, Bahrain, sent by the Political Agent of that rlare 7. With regard to the possibility of cholera reaching [raq via the Persian Gulf referred to by Dr. Barrett -eggs-5- in his fir, i n of Bth Ja.nua.ry. In tliG opinion of the Residency Surgeon cholera is more likely to reach Iraq via the Persian than the Arab side of the Gulf, and on the latter side we should get warning from the Political Agents at Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait. B. With ve^rd^ to the last paragraph of Ministry of Healths letteij of P9th January 1926. The Iraq Health Services and the Royal Air Force in Iraq have of course no mandate to occupy themselves with health conditions on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf which can normally be looked after by the Residency Surgeon in his capacity of Chief Quarantine Medical Officer and the staff under him. At the same time in cases of emergency, especially in regard to Sharjah, where there is no Medical Officer, I am always willing to receive assistance from outside, and I am grate ful to the Royal Air Force for sending their doctor down so promptly. The Superintendent Imperial Airways also did useful work in assisting with the vaccination. 9. With regard to the points raised in paragraph 4 of &gt;fMM the Foreign Office letter of 28th February, No.W.945/87/94, to the India Office, on which my observations are asked. I entirely agree that it is undesirable to give any notice under the Sanitary Convention of April 12th I9b£ in- respect of the Arab side of the Persian Gulf. 10. With regard to the two assurances which might be given to the International Public Health Office, suggested in the same paragraph of the Foreign Office 1 erbte r in question. The Residency Surgeon sees no objection to giving them, and I concur. Lieut.-Cclone1.

The pilot has however to enter certain observations in his log and these observations must necessarily be based on information sent to him by the local Quarantine Medical Officer through the competent Aerodrome Officer, who, in the case of the Arab side of the Gulf, is the Imperial Airways Agent.

I now of 9 th jliilf enclose a copy of a letter from the Air Ministry upon which i nres we shall be glad to receive your views. y V&gt; '}0H' f igur es act ached to the Air Ministry letter show clearly the value of the exemptions from petrol and oil duties, and we now at last have all the cards on the te.ble. You will see that if the increased payments to the Rulers were strictly based on the estimated increase in consumption, they would probably be larger than those now proposed. On the other hand we feel that there is considerable force in the argument (which the Air Ministry very strongly urged in interdepartmental discussion) that were the Rulers to observe the now recognised international practice of granting tenant-colonel T.C. Fowle, C.B.E., Consul General, Bushire.drawback, their claims to compensation would disappear. We suggest, therefore, that the present proposals put forward by the Air Ministry, which constitute a substantial advance on their previous proposals, are worth sympathetic consideration and that it is probably not too much to expect the rulers to tie themselves down for 7 years in return for the financial advantages which they would derive, 3. The financial benefits which will accrue to the rulers under each of the two alternatives suggested by the Air Ministry seem to be nicely balanced. It seems unlikely th^t the endux^nce of aeroplanes will increase to such an extent within the next 7 years that it will be possible to dispense with the present stopping places, so it appears alternative (b j is almost as safe an arrangement as alternative (a). In either case it would be necessary to _ revise articles 16 and 17 of the Civil Air A^fclnt s well as article 15 in the case of Muscat, as it is clearly essential that the sultan of Muscat should agree to non payment of customs duty in the first instance. The choice oe-cween the two alternatives appears, therefore, primarily to depend upon which will be the easier to negotiate.(t&gt;) mibht from this point of view be preferable, as it is based on a simple and logical principle 5 moreover the figure of £150 per weekly flight compares favourably with the present actual value of the exemption at Bahrein (£230 for two flights; and appears to be almost exactly the present value at Muscat if calculated on a 5$ basis (£597 at 10y o ). 4. As you will see Treasury authority has to be obtained before the rulers can be approached, so we should be grateful for your comments as soon as possible. i^5. Could you please also look into the case of the claims for refund at Gwadur mentioned in India' Office letters of 22nd October, 1935, and 5th March, 1936. 6 . I am sending a copy of this letter and enclosure to Metcalfe, Loch, Watts and de Gaury.',29 5 6 (Part II) F.W. Sir AIR MINISTRY, LONDON, W. 0.2. 9th April, 1936, /oO I am directed by the Secretary of state foJ Air to rerer to your letter of the 23rd December last, P.Z.8744/35, regarding tne question of the revision of the Bahrein, A-oweit and Muscat Civil Air Agreements, to subsequent semi- official correspondence, and to the meeting between repre sentatives of the India Oflice and Air Ministry on the 13th. ultimo. / While, as staged in this Department’s letter of the 31st August last, S.32956/11 /d.D.C.A., Lord Swinton agrees that in view’ or ohe increased use of the landing grounds and the still rurther use which will be made under the Empire Air Mail Scheme, some increase in the annual payments to the rulers of Bahrein and Muscat is justified, he is very reluctant to agree that such increase should be directly related to the quantities of oil fuel imported into these states for the purpose of refuelling the machines. 7 I am to enclose a copy of a statement furnished by Imperial Airv/ays shewing the present annual imports of petrol and oil and the duty charged, together with estimates of the corresponding figures when the Empire Air Mail Scheme is in operation. The Company point out that the figures are given with some reserve as they understand that further debits are to be received for the 6 months ended 30th September, 1935, suppliers having charged incorrect amounts. Under-secretary of state for India, Political Department, India Office, S. W. 1.it is now a recognised international practice to grant exemption Irom Custoiiis or other duties in resj^ect of fuel and oil taken on board for the purpose of operating machines to places outside the territory in which the stock is maintained, and where duty has already been paid, a Customs drawoack is granted in respect of any quantities of oil and petrol supplied to aircraft for use in such c ir c urns t anc e s. ^ If, therefore, the rulers of these tv/o States conformed to international practice, the complaint as to the. apparent loss oi customs revenue owing to the operation of the exemption clause in the civil air agreements, would disappear. 1 Lord Swinton also desires to point out that, apart from the advantages which will accrue to the territories by the establishment of the civil air routes, the continued maintenance of such a route through these territories facilitates the passage of military aircraft in emergency, v/hich is an essential requirement if His Majesty 1 s Government are to be enabled to come to the assistance of these rulers in time of emergency. In these circumstances Lord Swinton would prefer to base the increased rentals at*Bahrein and Gwadar on the general increase in use by Imperial Airways of the facilities provided and would be prepared to seek Treasury authority for either of the following alternatives (a) New Agreements for 7 years at an increased rental of £1,000 a year with retrospective effect to the date when the service was duplicated, viz: 1st January, 1935, covering the privileges enumerated under l A 1 and 'B 17 of the political Resident's Express Letter3. lA-^0 /!&gt; p' 894/s of 27th November last. or (b) co revise tme existing agreements to provide for their continuance for a further period of 7 years with an increased payment of £150 a year in respect Oj- each nduicional service undertaken by Imperial Airways o/er anci above the first service covered by the payment of £500 a year under the original a &amp; reement. I am accordingly to suggest that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should be informed of the foregoing views and be asked to consider the possibility of negotiating agreements with the rulers of Bahrein and Muscat on one or other of the bases suggested in substitution for the existing agreements which are not due to expire until the 6th dune?,': 1938 5 and 25th October, 1938, respectively. Colonel Fowle will no doubt point out to the rulers concerned that under the first alternative they would receive a guaranteed annual amount, irrespective of the number of services in operation, whilst under the latter arrangement, there is a possibility of variation in the amounts payable, as in the event of an improvement in the endurance of machines employed on this route, landings at one of the intermediate stopping places might be rendered unnecessary. It is assumed that in view of the increased payments offered under either alternative, the Sultan of Muscat would agree to non-payment of Customs duty in the first instance, instead of the present unfortunate system of a quarterly refund. |0 Y/ith regard to Koweit, I am to explain that this landing ground is not scheduled as a regular stopping place under the Empire Air Mail Scheme and it will only be usea on special occasions or in emergency. Lord Swinton does not consider, therefore, that any reason exists for an increaseTo/ ® 4. in the annual payment of £500 to the ruler^ /’ A COpy 01 a letter dated 5th March, 1936, which has beenr eceived from Imperial Airways, Ltd. with regard to the difnculty which is being experienced by the Company in obtaining refund of duty on petrol and oil uplifted at Gwadar from 26th October, 1934, to 31st December, 1935, is also attached, and I am t o request that the Political Resident m the Persian Gulf may be asked to take such action as is possible with a view to obtaining the refund of duties in accordance with the Civil Air Agreement.

In case our original Letter has been mislaid, I attach a copy for your information. Paragraph 9 of your letter of the 8th July, 1935, reference S.32956/D.D.C.ii. states:- j.he Sultan has agreed that whilst aXX oil and petrol for the use of aircraft, other than Royal Air Force aircraft, will be subject to the importation duties in force, he will refund quarterly the duties collected on all oil and xuel that may have been actually issued for the exclusive use of your Company, such amounts being certified by the agents appointed as suppliers by His Majesty’s Government. In this connection I am to inform you that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, through their agents at Gwadar, have been appointed as suppliers by His Majesty’s Government for this purpose.” I am now informed by our Cairo Office that in accordance with the above, claims amounting in all to about £650 for refund of duty on petrol and oil uplifted at Gwadar from 26th October, 1934 to 31st December 1935 Rave been submitted quarterly to the Director of Customs, Gvadar. All such claims have been rejected, and it appears evident that both the Director of Customs, Gwadar, and the Director of Revenue, Muscat, are unaware of the terms of the agreement between the Sultan and His Majesty’s Government. I am to request you therefore to advise us as soon as possible what steps we should now take to recover the duties paid on the petrol and oil in question. reference KH^/TLJ, 7955, to which we have not yet received d 111 j U w « ^ For and on behalf of IMPERIAL ^IRV/AYS LTD.

If you concur, perhaps you might inform Dr. Morgan at the Ministry of Health, ■chat the answers to the questions which he raises in paragraph 4 of his letter of 29th January are as follows. The sanitary administration along the Southern shore of she Persian Gulf is supervised by officers appointed by the Government of India. The cliier quarantine medical officer is the Residency Surgeon at Bushire, who has under his control an Assistant Surgeon at Bushirc and Assistant Surgeons at Burkett, Esc., M.C., Air Ministry, W. C. 2.1 Koweit, Bahrein and Muscat. The necessary medical and quarantine supervision at the Bahrein and Koweit aerodromes is carried out by their respective Assistant Surgeons. At Sharjah it is carried out at present either by the Imperial Airways Station Superintendent or by the Assistant Surgeon at Bahrein. The aerodrome at Gwadur is at present under the control o± the Assistant Surgeon at Muscat. The aerodromes at Sharjah and Gwacur are situated some distance from the town and they can there fore be easily isolated so that there is little danger of infection from without. As regards the establishment of an Epidemilogical Service, it seems to us from evidence advanced by Colonel Fowle that the present arrangements are working satisfactorily and that there is no necessity for international action in this respect.

The Hague, April 12 , 1938 . 'With a view to the regulation of the sanitary control of aerial aavigation, the undersigned, plenipotentiaries of the High Contracting Parties, furnished with full powers found in good and due form have agreed on the following articles : Part I.— General Provisions. Article 1 . For the purposes of this Convention the High Contracting Parties dopt the following definitions:— L—The word aircraft includes any machine which can derive upport in the atmosphere from the reactions of the air, and is ^tended for aerial navigation. The present Convention applies only to aircraft— (P of which the place of departure and place of final landing arc situated in different territories; ( 2 ) which, although the place of departure and place of final landing are situated on the same territory, make an inter mediate landing on a different territory ; ( 3 ) which fly without landing over more than one territory; ■hether these territories are placed under the sovereignty, suzerainty, Mandate or authority of the same Power or of different Powers. IL—The words authorised aerodrome denote a customs or other prodrome, specially designated as such by the competent authority Jthe State in which it is situated, on which aircraft may make their m landing on entering a territory, or from which they may depart Heaving a territory. HI.—The words sanitary aerodrome denote an authorised aero- me organised and equipped in accordance with the terms of rticle 5 of the present Convention, and designated as such by anv mpetent authority of the country. IV.—The word crew includes any person having duties on board connexion with the flying or the safety of the flight of the aircraft : employed on board in any way in the service of the aircraft, the issengers or the cargo.26 V.

Subject to the conditions laid down in Article 8 of the present Convention, an aerodrome may constitute a local area. yj. The word observation means the isolation of persons in a suitable place. The word surveillance means that persons aie not isolated, that they may move about freely, but that they are notified to the sanitary authorities of the several places whither they are bound and are subjected to a medical examination with a view to establishing their state of health. YU. The word day means an interval of 24 hours. Article 2. Whatever relates in the present Convention to aerodromes is to be understood as applying mutatis mutandis to places for the landing on water of hydroplanes and similar craft. Section I .—Aerodromes in general and their Staff. Article 3. Each High Contracting Party undertakes to provide on his authorised aerodromes a sanitary organisation adapted to the current needs of prophylaxis, which as a minimum shall consist of definite arrangements to ensure the attendance of a medical practitioner, at such °times as may be necessary, for the medical examinations contemplated by the present Convention. Article 4. It rests with each High Contracting Party, taking into account the risks of infectious disease to which his territory may be exposed to decide whether or not to establish sanitary aerodromes and which authorised aerodromes shall be selected for this purpose. Article 5. The sanitary aerodrome shall at all times have at its disposal— (a) An organised medical service with one medical officer at least and one or more sanitary inspectors, it being understood that this staff will not necessarily be in permanent attendance at the aerodrome; (b) A place for medical inspection; (c) (d) (e) .

The aerodrome shall be provided with a sufficient supply of diolesome drinking water, and with a proper and safe system for the iisposal of excreta and refuse, and for the removal of waste water. The aerodrome shall, as far as possible, be protected from rats. Article 6. • The medical officer of the sanitary aerodrome shall be an official [, or approved by, the competent sanitary authority. Article 7. Each High Contracting Party shall communicate, either to the Office International d’Hygiene publique or to the Internationa) .ommission for Air Navigation (which will transmit to each other ie information thus received) a list of his sanitary aerodromes, in irder that it may be brought to the knowledge of the other High .'ontracting Parties. The communication shall include, in the case i each aerodrome, details as to its situation, its sanitary equipment ind its sanitary staff. The notification to the Office International d’Hygiene publique irovided for in the present Article, as well as in Articles 8, 87, 40, 58, ;9 and 60 of the present Convention may, in the case of those High Contracting Parties who have adhered to the Pan-American Sanitary ode, be made through the intermediary of the Pan-American 'anitary Bureau. Article 8. In order that a sanitary aerodrome may be designated as a local rea for the purpose of notification of infectious diseases and for other Qrposes as provided by the present Convention it must be so rganised that— (1) The entry and exit of any persons are under the supervision and control of the competent authority;(2) In the case of a disease specified in Article 18 of this Convention occurring in the surrounding territory, access to the aerodrome by any route other than the air is forbidden to persons suspected of being infected, and measures are applied to the satisfaction of the competent authority with a view to preventing persons who are resident in or passing through the aerodrome from being exposed to the risk of infection, either by contact with persons from outside or by any other means. In order that an authorised aerodrome which is not a sanitary aerodrome may similarly be designated a local area, it is necessary in addition that it. shall be so situated, topographically, as to be beyond all probable risk of infection from without. ' The High Contracting Parties shall notify to the Office Inter national d’Hygiene publique aerodromes which have been constituted local areas in accordance with the terms of the present Article and the Office International d’Hygiene publique will communicate the notification to the other High Contracting Parties and to the Inter national Commission for Air Navigation. Section II .—Aircraft Sanitary Documents. Article 9. The following entries shall be made in the journey log book, under the heading “ Observations ” :— (1) Any facts relevant to public health which have arisen on the aircraft in course of the voyage; (2) Any sanitary measures undergone by the aircraft before departure or at places of call, in application of the present Convention. (8) Information concerning the appearance in the country from which the aircraft is departing of any of the infectious diseases mentioned in Part III of the present Convention. This entry is made with a view T to facilitating the medical examination which passengers arriving at aerodromes in another territory may be required to undergo. For this purpose the Government of any non-infected country in which one of the said diseases makes its appearance shall, in addition to other means by which it is already required to inform other countries of the outbreak of such diseases and of their nature, transmit the necessary information to the competent authorities of each of its authorised aerodromes. The latter shall enter the information in the journey log of any aircraft leaving the aerodrome during a period of fifteen days from the date on which the information was first received. Aircraft shall not be required to carry Bills of Health. The entries made in the journey log book in accordance with the terms this ompete In a K2, 44 &gt; lircraft i jo be a ranspor!

If the commander of the aircraft wishes to disembark a sick person he shall, so far as he is able, notify the aerodrome of arrival in good time before landing. Article 16. If there is on board an aircraft a case of infectious disease duly verified by the medical officer attached to the aerodrome, not being a disease 'specified in Part III of the present^ Convention, the usual measures in force in the country in which the aerodrome is situated shall be applied. The sick person may be landed and, if the competent sanitary authority considers it desirable, isolated in a suitable place ; the other passengers and the crew shall have the right to continue the voyage after medical inspection, and, if necessary, the carrying out of the appropriate sanitary measures. Such of these sanitary measures as can be carried out at the aerodrome shall be so arranged in relation to the administrative and customs operations that the aircraft may be detained as short a time as possible.

Nevertheless, each High Contracting Party, if epidemiological conditions demand such action, has the right to require aircraft coming from particular local areas to land at prescribed sanitary or authorised aerodromes, account being taken of the geographical position of those aerodromes and of the routes If th followed by the aircraft, in such a manner as not to hamper aerialjhich m navigation. m ]\ The only measures which, if necessary, may be taken at ' authorised aerodromes which are not also sanitary aerodromes, are i the medical inspection of crew and passengers and the landing and isolation of the sick. Passengers and crew may not move beyond thei ^ limits prescribed by the aerodrome authority except with the permis- ' 1 sion of the visiting medical officer. This restriction may continue, to be imposed on the aircraft at each landing place until it arrives’ at a sanitary aerodrome, where it will be subject to the measures laid down in this Chapter.
