The Sultan’s letter No. 19^ dated June the 20th is in reply to letter 'B' of June 19th from Mr* Lermitte. I do not consider that the alterations referred to 3 in paragraph 2 above are of great importance. The original version of paragraph 3 (f) (letter 'A”) implied that the Sheikhs of the A1 Bu Shamis and the Naim would remain constantly with the party. The rendering in letter 'B w is more general. It was unlikely that these two Sheikhs in practice would be with the Geologists throughout their wander ings and possibly undesirable that they should enter each other’s territory and the territory of the neighbouring / SheikhsSheikhs. The Sultan has agreed to arrange for the necessary Sheikhs to accompany the party and in my opinion that is reasonable and sufficient. (•&gt; 4. His Highness is willing to allow Petroleum Concess ions Limited^ Geological party access to the areas enumerated in Mr. Lermitte^ letter 'B' of June 19th. I consider that His Highness is capable of ensuring that the Geologists have complete freedom of movement provided they conduct themselves in a discreet manner and take the advice of the Wali Madhaffer who will be constantly with the party. In my opinion it is both unnecessary and undesirable for the Company to re-open their negotiations with the A1 Bu Shamis and the Naim through the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. 5. The Sultan has stated that motor cars must not be used. The reason that he has given is that he cannot guarantee safety if the party are able to move rapidly over a wide area. The concern he feels is not from the tribesmen under the control of the local Sheikhs in whose territory the party may be operating but from stray bedouins who might fire a shot at a car possibly more in fright or fear than in anger. I understand that His Highness contemplates constructing motor transport in these regions. Next year cars will probably be possible. In view of His Highness’s objection and statement there can be no question of the Company making use of cars. 6 # His Highness has further objected to the Geological party entering through the territory of the Sheikh ot Abu Dhabi* He considers that the local inhabitants will assume that any party entering through Abu Dhabi must necessarily be entering under the auspices of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi# The local people in these remote places are very simple and I consider that His Highness is correct in his view. That the / party shouldi 3 ■» /r © party should be connected with Abu Dhabi is undesirable for two reasons • Firstly because some if not all of the minor Sheikhs living in Muscat territory will probably refuse access to the party on the grounds that it cannot be a Muscat party coining from that direction* No doubt in time entry will be arranged but aggravating delays will occur. Secondly, from His High ness’s own personal political point of view it is undesirable for there to be any doubt in the minds of his Sheikhs near and far regarding his overlordship of the A1 Bu Shamis, Naim and the adjacent areas. A party entering from the Batinah side undoubtedly shows that it goes writh his permission. A party entering from the Trucial Coast side may or may not have his permission. I repeat what I have already stated in my telegram under reference and that is that if the party wish to have the least possible trouble they should be guided by His Highness’s advice on this point. 7. At this point I should like to mention that in view of the possibility of a repetition of last year’s incidents, I consider that the Muscat party should have nothing to do with any party operating in any territory outside Muscat and vice versa. The Sultan wishes the party operating in Muscat territory to be clearly under his auspices and protection. He does not wish there to be any confusion on this point and for this reason he does not desire a political officer to accompany the party. There are reasons for and against the inclusion of a political officer and I have discussed the question with the Sultan at some length and will if you desire forward a separate report on this point. 8. I believe that Jebel Akhdar will be open to the Con^any’s survey parties next winter. His Highness’s political influence has spread very considerably during the last few / months- months. There are already indications that Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamyar, the paramont Sheikh of Jebel Akhdar, is not unmoved by the Sultan’s present policy and it is probable that in the near future His Highness will be able to come more closely into touch with this important Sheikh.

The Company regard this development as offering an opportunity of arranging matters with Sultan which should not be missed and as immediate orders to Lermitte were essential they have with my concurrence (as stated in my telegram) authorised him to visit Sohar. 2. Had time permitted I should have preferred to have consulted you before consenting to Company’s suggestion, which is a modification of programme recommended in your letter of 4th May in that access to Hafit and Dhank may now be arranged through Sultan.

Absence of motor transport. b. Probable opposition of Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. c. Known weakness of Sultan of Muscat*s control in interior. d. Difficulty of adequate maintenance of party on camels. The company therefore wish to leave the matter undecided for the present. My London office have informed me that if they decide to proceed with the geological party on the lines indicated ( camel transport ) then they will communicate with you and with H.H. the Sultan and detailed conversations will be initiated* I have informed H.h. that for the moment ray company have decided to leave the matter of a geological survey, owing to it not being possible to facilitate motor transport into the territory occupied by the Al bu Shamis and Ka'im, but that should the company decide at a later date to make other arrangements they will communicate with H.H. I shall therefore leave Muscat tomorrow 23rd June and proceed to Kalbah where I shall make enquiries from Shaiidi Khalid as to what progress he has made regarding arrangements with Mohamed bin Ali of the Banni Kitab.

H I'IV Dear Mr. Pee-1, I send you a copy of a letter v/e despatched to Mr. Lermitte immediately after my conference with you two days ago. A copy was, of course, sent to Bahrain and will, no doubt, be shown to ’veightman. I am sending you also a copy of a D.O. letter from Lermitte, dated from Dubai on the 16th. It contains various items of news. That contained in the first two paragraphs encourages one to think that the Shaikh of Kalbah has recommenced active -negotiationswith Mohammed Din Ali Mn Huwaiders tut the penultimate paragraph suggests that our fears of a protest from the Sultan of Muscat are likely to he realised. I do not so much fear that his influence will sway the attitude of the Shaikhs of the A1 tu Shamis and Na’im, if we treat the latter more generously than he is likely to: I am afraid of a deterioration in the Sultan's attitude to the Company on other fronts - though it would not he surprising if his annoyance was directed more against Political than against the Company.

IN My dear Lerrnitte, Your letters dated April 30th and the Minutes enclosed with them have been very carefully considered - also .he telegrams dated May 8th, May 9th, May 19th and May 23rd which followed them. A reply has been delayed penning consultation with the India Office who have 'been awaiting the recommendations of the P.H. These reconmendations on^y reached Whitehall yesterday and were the subject 01 a conxerence this morning, from which I have just come. The India Office authorities feel very much the sane hesitation as myself over treating the areas of rfefit sn southward of it as being outside tie interest of OieS^ t of luscat, when last year or party visited these ^e-sth ) his official representative and after they had been s./c^tore. out of his treasury. The further south one goes ir^mBar^ , the more one penetrates into country n ot to m!ke Multan claims and for this reason it is desira 1- 1 any^approach to the authorities of Dhank unless^until spokesmen of the can argue N; L m there approach you. For the rest,wt. (a) that last year's parties were not given a fair ^ chance to see the country, but wde moiety one hurried through it and forbidden re-entrance. (o) it is administratively much easier for us to deal 'with that country from the north, ana we ■ necessary contacts xor doing so. (c) (d) (e) we arc bound to use motor transport, and toxs^cennot ■^-.ooi'hiv be brought up irom the soutn, ■ exoeriment of bringing the party from the south andMhe motors from the north, was proven lc-st year to givu poor results.

The/ B.H. Lermitte, Bsq. , c/o The Manager, . - Petroleum Concessions, L ( ^ Bahrain.2 . The P.E. apparently wishes the parties to commence opera tions on October 1st. This, from the climatic point of view, seems very early and October 15th or 31st would appear preferable. Two parties are visualised at present. One, a geophysical party operating in the Dubai, Abu Dhabi coast and hinterland, and two, a' detailed maoping party covering Eaiyah - Hafit, and Dhank if possible. If'it is decided to do further work on the coast northwest of Muscat, that will involve an altogetner indepencient approach to the Sultan, although perhaps the same geologists might be used. The geophysical party would consist prooaoly of°five Europeans (possibly Frenchmen), the mapping party probably of two Americans. The first party should present no o^rticular problems as we are assuming all Abu Dhaoi to be open and well-disposed. The itinerary of the second party depends uoon the degree of security and the area.s thrown oen. Doth parties will be motorised. I The decision to post a European manager in Muscat will not be taken until it is more certain that work will be undertaken p in territory under the Sultan's effective control, ^e. g. m ikie * Batina. This would probably be towards the end oi the season. As regards negotiations with Mohammed bin All bin HuwaiderA you can do little but sit back raid hope thnt^ Khalid will I successful than last winter - and if he is, hope uo ±ol-ow up yj bringing in the Bani Ka’ab. As regards Shakhbut’s proposed part, it will be very interesting to see how far he is wiping to plc,y and whether the Na'im (presumably excluding Saqr, ^ ^f^voiir^biy have no further use) and Al bu Sharnis will re—.ct more favour... y than they did in December last. You will be able to promise presents of the order of Rs.3,000 (or equivalent in M.T. dollars) to P £0 P le ^ J ® r calibre of Rashid bin Hamad, Mohammed bin Rahman, Ahm_.d =.l , and Mohammed bin Sultan, and in the northern are^,i the Bani Chita.b and Bani Ka’ab, with presumably much sm^ler amounts for the smaller people. Where you make ngangements to obtain what we want by presents m cash, tudf of the a^ou t stipulated should be payable on the spot ^ the °ther half -t the end of the season, unless some other arran g cment i unavoidable. If they are not prepared to l«t us i oresents on this scale, but make absurd demands such -s did Ubaid bin Juma last year, it will siean th?.o we sh^ o in at all.

Dubaij 16th Hay, Dear Mr. Longrigg, I have had several talks with Khalid recently and he informs r me that he leaves for Dhaid in three or four days time when he hopes to meet Mohamed bin Ali. The Shaikh of Urnm al Quwain left yesterday for Falaj al Ali and also hopes to meet Mohamed. Both the Bani Kitab and the al bu Shamis have recently given. presents of camels to Ibn Saud. In each case they only received a few hundred rupees in exchange and the R*A. tells me that they are very disgruntled at this treatment and have stated that they will not pay their resioects again. Rashid bin Hamid of the Al bu Shamis and his brother Mohamed went personally to meet Ibn Saud at Qatif. Mohamed bin Ali of the Bani Kitab sent ’Amr bin Metaweh. This man is one of the two very u anti-nasrani ! ' men we met together in the fort of Sultan bin Salem at Ras al Khaimah. They crossed over to Bahrain with Ibn Baud’s party and remained throughout the visit. The R.A. has also told me that he met some of the officials of the Sultan of Muscat on the B.I. boat. The Sultan has grown a waist length beard and is now always surrounded by religious men. It appears that his intention is to try to regain control of the country which is now under the Imam of Rostoq. The R.A. was also told that the Sultan now openly declares that Baraimi Oasis is part of his domains ’’except the few spots owned by Abu Dhabi”. It remains to be seen what the Al bu Shamis and Ha’ im will have to say when they hear this. 3.H. LONGRIGG, ESQ. , London. Yours sincerely, (S gd.) B.H, LERMITTE.■ GOVERNMENT OP INDIA.

I write to let you know that the Political Agent, Muscat, has informed the Political Resident that the Sultan does not intend to visit Sohar, and that the iTaim and A1 ku Shamis Sheikhs have visited Muscat where the Sultan negotiated one year’s truce between them. They are said to have expressed their loyalty to the Sultan and to he returning to their homes. The Political Agent adds that the Sultan is prepared to discuss the exploration programme with your Company’s representative and expresses the view, in which Sir Trenchard Fowle concurs, that Mr. Lermitte should visit Muscat without delay.

It seems that the principal questions to which we have not yet got replies are: (1) Does the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi really intend to help us, or is he merely on the make for his own hand? (2) Will the anti-foreign sentiments of the Na T im and A1 bu Shamis Shaikhs be as marked this year as it was last? (3) Will the Sultan of Muscat be prepared to sit back and let us operate otherwise than under his own direct auspices? A further report from Lermitte after he has seen the Sultan may throw a new light. fours sincerely, (Sd.) Stephen H. Longrigg. J.P. Gibson, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.J.1./ r B PC.28/47. Pi.'r'iiOLjiUM Kiy&amp;LOxM&amp;HT (PEUCIAL COi-ST) LIMITED. 9th June, 1939. My dear Lermit'&amp;e, I enclose a note oil a telephone conversation of this afternoon with the India Office, which gives you their information, and ours, up to today. On the strength of this I have called you as follow's; - ’’Political recommend that you visit Sultan of Muscat at Muscat without delay to discuss exploration arrangements particularly in view of renewed relations between ITaeem and Shams and Sultan of Muscat”. If, as I suppose, you have had a trying journey to Sohar to no purpose, it is regrettable and evidently means that the Sultan changed his plans, or that you were misinformed about them. It also means probably, that arrangements with the ITa’im and Al bu Shamis will be more difficult to make from the Abu Dhabi angle after they have revived their allegiance to the Sultan. Goodness knows when you will receive this letter, certainly not until your return to Sharjah. It may be that if you arrive at Sohar and find nothing doing there you may proceed to Muscat by car, and I hope that this may be so. I am wiring Nasib to contact you if possible. It is most unfortunate for you that these moves and counter-moves have to take place so late in the season. Yours sincerely, (Sd. ) S.H. LOITGRIGG. ,H.

PC 28/51 PIP3BURY SyJAYE, E.C.2. 20th June 3 1959 My dear G-ihson, I write in continuation of ra^ letter PC. 20/48 of June 14th. It is now possible to suggest answers to the three questions contained in that letter from new evidence which despatches from Lermitte contain. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi 5 whose initial attitude seemed so satisfactory P has now changed and demands as a condition for any co-operation at all: (1) a present of Ps. 10,000 for himself (2) 20 guards of 'is. 4 per day with free food and camel hire. (3) entertainment upon a princely scale for any visitors and parties whatsoever which might visit mm during a Royal progress which he proposes to make to Baraimi and during his stay there, v/ith cash presents for every visitor. Lermitte reckons the cost of these items (which do not include a penny for the important Shaikhs of the areas really concerned) at Rs. 25,000. In spite of all arguments he refuses to abate these demands which, you will agree, ai e quite unacceptable. So much for the Abu Dhabi line of approach. The other possibility is the Muscat line. Lermitte is now at Muscat and has thrashed it all out v/ith the Sultan. The latter, of course, claims the territory of the ITa’im, Al bu Shamis, Bani Cha'ab, etc. to be part of his dominions \ the Shaikhs are his most loyal and devoted subjects and are in receipt of regular salaries from him: he has recently established peace between them. He is prepared to/I * t 6.j 2 . to have a party conducted into their country? hut absolutely declines to permit the use of cars. I understand from Lermitte's cable that the Political Agent is inclined to support the Sultan’s claims and to deprecate the use of motor transport in areas where His Highness disapproves of it. Inability to use cars would be a most serious objection to our use of the Muscat line of approach; and apart from that ? I cannot feel any confidence that a party o:-us introduced would fare any better than it did last year 3 in which they got nothing more than one ride straight through the country concerned on camel-bach. Moreover? iu is haid to believe that the goodwill now offered by Shaikh Shakhbut? on whatsoever terms? would not be turned into active opposition in the critical areas concerned? if we decide to leave him out of the picture and sail under the Sultan's colours instead. It must be remembered that in the Baraimi/Hafit area Shakhbut means a great deal more than the Sultan? who has never been seen there and is not directly represented. No doubt the Political President is fully informed of these circumstances? which cannot but appear to constitute a strong case against trying to enter that area at all until better times. Have you received any recommendations from him? whether positive or negative ? Yours sincerely? (Sd.) Stephen H. Longrigg J,P. Gibson Esq.. ? India Office? Whit c hal1? S.W.1./ M'V CONFIDENTIAL.

The subject has been discussed again with Longngg, who was informed of your views, though it was not felt possible to press the Company too far to carry out exploration in an area where they themselves felt the circumstances were unfavourable. After further consideration in the light of this discussion Longrigg has communicated the Company's views m / the letter of which a copy is enclosed herewith. / 3 . It is dear from this letter that the Company feel that exploration in the Ibri-Dhank-Jebel Hafit area in the near future is likely to be unsuccessful and possibly also nob without risk to their personnel, and in the circumstances I fear that their view must be accepted that plans for exploration in this area in the coming winter season should be abandoned. 4. As regards exploration in the territory und^r the control or influence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi Longrigg laid great stress on the difficulty caused by the Sheikh avarice and unreasonableness. He said, for example, that the Sheikh's charges for guards (Rs. 4 a day) were four times the rate usually paid. Please consider whether it would be possible/possible, following his suggestion, for the Political Agent to have a frank talk with the Sheikh and try to persuade him that it is in his own interests that he should give the Company every facility and assistance in working the Concession. The issue of the above has been duly authorised. (Sgd.) R-'&lt;V 2. go ,d offices of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, with the acquiescence of the Sultan of Muscat. from this strategy, however, we seem to be prevented by two considerations: firstly, the impudent and unreasonable demands made by Shaikh Shakhbut as a condition . for helping us at all (and even so we have no guarantee that his help would be effective, or his further demands kept within bounds): and secondly, the confident claims made by the Sultan of Muscat - claims which the Political Agent, Muscat seems inclined to support - that fully nine-tenths of the area in question owes allegiance to the Sultan and can only legitinately be approached under his auspices. It is thus clear that we must explore the Ibn/Dhank/Hafit area with the Sultan’s help and within limitations upon wmcn he insists, or not at all. Provided that we set out from the Batinah coast, keep within his dominions, are accompanied by the Shaikhs whose loyalty he claims, and confine ourselves to camel transport he states that he can give us the entree to tne aesired areas. There are, however, I feel, arguments against accepting this offer this year even while realising the Sultan’s good intentions. Firstly, the country and tribes are wild in the extreme, their actual loyalty to him is known to be highly precarious and shallow-rooted, and their anti-foreign and anti-Christian sentiments highly developed. These factors loaf vear were, during a hriex and the fact that our parties las. yea . 4- n +h«+ area, twice attacked dy rifle and unsatisfactory visit to that area, fire make it difficult to feel that the party would be safe. Their supplies, ex hypotuesi reaching them across the Oman mountains, would be slow and unreliable and tneir line o- retreat, if necessary, through dixficult ^unt.y.I * I ~ r I do not tolieve that Shaikh Shakhtut, who has formulated a programme full of -benefits to himself in introducing us to these districts, would care to see us gain access from the opposite direction. I cannot believe but that he would feel it a blow to his prestige as well as his pocket: it is to be remembered that the Shaikhs of the Na' im and A1 bu Shamis flatter him with expressions of devotion probably as often as they flatter the Sultan of Muscat. (Their flirtations with Ibn Saud are also coimnon knowledge) . I cannot feel convinced that our initiation of separate work in Snaikh ShaKhout s own country will, as Sir Trenchard Fowle suggests, prevent Shakhbu from any intrigue or interference against us in Hafit Thirdly, the Sultan is himself definite that the p=n np mJS ' not use motor transport, rtiich suggests two considerations: the one, that so severe a handicap must dimmish the of the party’s work and dispose one less to take behalf of it: the other, that the attitude of tribes which will perhaps permit the presence of Christian foreigners mounted on camels, but not if they ride in cars, does not m inspire much confidence in their good-will. The general consideration must be adaed that the pictu painted by the Sultan in remote and civilised Muscat, imned* after a visit of the principal Shaikhs concerned, may well prove to be somewhat optimistic as contrasted with conditions which the party actually encountered on the visit to this area last year. It was in 1933 well understood that the party fro. the north was to join forces with the party from the south and proceed to a full and leisurely examination of the country. This, however, proved, as you know, quite impossible, and the results of the whole campaign were disappointing. Our'7J 4. flr ^ Our representative visiting Muscat recently was assured that the Sultan’s influence and prestige were growing rapidly. If this is so, and if a motor road from the Batinah coast south-westwards could he engineered without much difficulty, prohahly an expedition next year would start with much greater chances of success. A contributory element to such success would he a more reasonable attitude by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, whose childishness is at present a serious nuisance. Would it be possible for the Political Agent, Bahrain to advise the Shaikh in the direction of carrying out the Concession in a real spirit of reasonableness and helpfulness - a test case of which would be his attitude over the question of guides and escorts. I must apologise for the length of this letter. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) Stephen H. Longrigg R.T. Peel, Esq. , M.C., India Office, Whitehall, S.Yi/.l.CONFIDENTIAL. No. C “ 246.

Privately he probably feels he was persuaded into accepting what h. is convinced are not favourable terns. His sentiment, in this case may be exp.ct.d to colour his attitude in any proposal for sal., exchange, leas, of island. I do not think he will a*r.e to permanent alienation of territory in view of effect, on public opinion. Leas, of whole or part would b e more acceptable am some email concession to Jannabah Tribe such as right to reside Southern end of islam for the purpose of fishing with evacuation by all tribesmen in emergency might possibly placate public opinion and Sultan would probably agr.e not to grant concessions of any part notieqs.d.

The Political Resident feels that the proposals suggested to him by your Company’s representative for the exten sion of the option periods with the Sultan of Muscat and the exploration agreement with the Shaikh of Ajman were not altogeth er satisfactory. He recommends instead that.agreements should be negotiated with the Sumtan extending the option periods on the Muscat- and- Oman and Dhofar concessions from 24th. June 1944 to 24th June 194S and with the Shaikh of .g'man for the extension of the whole agreement from 23rd.

The five years to commence from the time that men and materials become available. Should any di- pute regarding the interpretation of M availablity M arise His Majesty's Government would be sole judge. We agree with the Political Resident's views and should be glad to know whether his proposals will meet the requirements of your Company and in particular whether-you would have any objection to arbitration by His Majesty's Government in the event of a dispute about the availability pf men and material; materia...s.

LIHG HOUSE LONDON. E.C. 2 25th February 1944. Dear hr Peel, With reference to your _etter of 24th February, the proposals made by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for the extensions of the Ajman Agreement and the option periods in the Muscat/Oman and Dhofar Concessions are accept able to the Company. .Ve are also prepared to accept arbitration by His. Majesty’s Government in the event of a dispute arising as to^the_ date upon which men anc* material can be made available -or tne necessary exploration work. * I enclose two draft agreements which would, in our opinion, cover ti e Political Resident's proposals: the Dhofar Agreement would follow the sane ~ines as that .ici - ■ —• As regards the Ajman Licence, we have telegraphed to our Bahrain ianager instructing him t apply to the Ruler of Alman for the extension of our existing Agreement for a further year form 23rd. Parch, 1944 in order to safeguard our rights pending the conclusion of the proposed new Agreement. The terms of the existing Agreement do provide for such a year's extension if the Company has not completed its exploration work. This right, however, presupposes tnat tie exploration work has actually been commenced m the previous five years but we believe that the Ruler will grant the exten- sion as a matter of formality. From our point of view, we shall be m a better position in negotiating an extension to an Agreement still in force rather than a renewal of one which has exoirec and would give the Ruler the opportunity to ask for revised conditions of payment, etc. Yours sincerely, Sd.

SITUATION 1ST .ARIL 1944 (ci) • A NNIiiL The Company has notified the Ruler of Ajmah that it is their intention to exercise their rights under Clause 7 of the agreement for an extension of the exploration period for a further year up to and including I larch 22, 1945, corresponding to 16 Rabia A/yal 1364. This notification v;as sent through the mail facilities of the Political Agent, Bahrain, and Political Officer, Sharjah, at the end of February 1944. The Shaikh’s acknowledgment has not been received up to 1st. April 1944, but as the extension is provided for in the original agreement, no importance need be attached to the delay. The Ruler has not been informed that any new agreement is to be put forward. Under the terms of the original extension Rs. 3,000/- paid quarterly in advance, is continued up to the end of march 1945. 'There is provision in the agreement (para.3) for a permanent agreement after the option ( or exploration) period is ended. Nr. Skliros* message to the Company received through the Political Agent, Bahrain, under his c/545-dated the 27th Narch 1944 instructs Petroleum Concession, Bahrain, to approach the Ruler of Ajman with a revised agree ant consituting an extension of the original agreement. The revised draft agreement has been sent through the Political Resident but.has not been received by the Company to date (1.4.44). In a is message Iso the Company is instructed to follow the Political Resident’s advice as to the best method of approacn to the Ruler. Para•^ of'the letter from the Political agent containing tne message instructs that any amendments to the new drafts are to be referred to Mr. Skliros. The procedure with regard to such amendments before they s.re telegraphed to London, nowever, io not clear. It would seem that such amendments could with advant age be referred, to the Political Resid.ent for nis advice and/or his views before any telegrams are despatched to London. It is obvious that it would be of assistance and importance for Lr. Skliros to know the Political Resident’s views and time might be saved. In any case it is assuj ed that tne Political Lesicent will desire to be kept informed by the quickest method of any amendments sent to ir. Skliros. His wis es and advice on the handling of such amendments would be appreciated. (b); NU c r* • - m : DKCFiiR .iGREEIELTS In the existing agreements the 23rd.

Sultan of Muscat at an interview yesterday cveining considered it considerable annoyance that A. I.O.C. had taken up Oil Concessions because firstly he considered terms of agreement compare badly with those xn Iraq copy of which he has, secondly he is not convinced company xntedd to orosoect seriously. I said 1932 Iraq concession was made as far as I know with certain knowledge of presence of oil was not the case here but he still considers he has maae oad bargain and avowedly blames his own ignorance. Privately he probably feels he was persuaded into accepting what he is convinced are not favourable terms . ^ I believe royalty rate is same as in Bahrain. Only legitimate grievance appears therefore to be dilatoriness of Company in exploiting concession.- 2 - (These details may be slightly inaccurate because I have seen the Arabic version of the agreement only*) He naturally» regrets that he did not include similar penal clauses in his o»n concessions, and now feels he is unable to compel tne Company to develop them in any way at all* 4. *g*in # Kis Highness Knows that tne financial terms of the Iraq Concession are more generous* e.g* (a) Payments are made in pounds or shillings (gold)* (b) Hinisiura loyalty payshle is £ 200,000 compared with fe. 84,000/ (c) Kent for land is paid* Ho aimilwr how good th© Sultan woild probably still feel that ha Bight possibly have Improved on them* 5. I «a absolutely certain that the Company would have had no chance whatsoever in persuading Hia nighneas to agree to a further extension of the Option period, as he would have stood to lose financially by such an extension and would still have had no guar ants • taat too company would not taka up the Concession wbethsr oil was found or not. 6.

Dear Pool, Many thanks for your letter of August 3Ath. Tho enquiry by tho Potroleur-i Administrator for War relates solely to war requirenents. It night be thought that tho tine is now approaching 'when oil projects should be supported, or the reverse, on tho basis of whether or not they are in the general interest, without special reference to the war effort. Unf ortunately, however, • it is still inpossiblo to get priorities for equipnont, etc. in the U.S.^. without pleading sene war necessity. Moreover, P.A.W. themselves have only a wartime mandate, and cannot therefore request our views on post-war do velo'prAcnts. As regards tho supply of oil equipment, materials, etc. after the war, we have already done a good deal of research in. this Department, and have come to the conclusion that about 30^ of our oil equipment requirements over the next 5 years could bo manufactured in this country, provided wo a.ro given an adequate allocation of man power, raw materials and manufacturing capacity. Vo are in correspondence with the Trea-sury and the Ministry of Production on this subject, but the statistics are rather voluminous and this general indication nay bo enough for your purpose. As regards the balance of 20/o which we should need to obtain frora the United States, we do not expect any trouble in obtaining it, provided the Treasury are prepared to release the necessary dollars. It is, however, difficult at present to prophesy the course of events until the new International Oil C amis si on has begun to operate. I aim sending a copy of this letter to W'ikoly.

The Sultan was much amused at the term 'wild cat'. Finally I sold him tn? t, in my opinion, his criticism could not'really be sound •as it is not based on knowledge obtained from a geological survey or visual evidence of o-i. i think .it is fair to say that trie . ultan^ now feels less strongly against letroleun Concessions, out a i^mklin^ feciin c , . rob ably remains. % 4.

Dear Prior, f •' ‘ Y/ill you please refer to your endorsement No. 9^7• S. ox 31ot December, 1944 forwarding a copy of Galloway’s letter No.£.2050. 1L01 of the 11th December cn the subject of oil concessions in Luo cat )Vo have taken up here the suggestion that Petroleum Concessions Ltd. might under-take geological work in Muscat in the winter of 1945/46, and have discussed the matter with Hr. Yi/heatley of that Company. It appears that they had already been planning geophysical surveys for next winter and were about to submit proposals to the U.S.A. Petroleum Administrator for r/ar in order to obtain the necessary staff and equipment from the U.S.A., since these are apparently unobtainable in this country at the moment. They have already secured Treasury sanction to the dollar expenditure involved. Mr. Nheatley told us that P,C.L» have in mind another expedition to the Barainta oasis and the Jebel Faiyah - Jebel Hafit area, probably in two parts, (i) a small preliminary geological mapping party, and (2) a larger geophysical survey party to f 01107 / on, the latter to include a numboi of American geophysical experts since at present apparently there are no British ones. P.C.L’s plans are, hov/ever, not yet finally worked out and they have promised to let us have something more definite in writing about the middle of March.. In any case everything depends on the approval of the American P, A.»A I an, therefore, T/riting to you now merely to let you Know in a preliminary way 7 /hat is in the air. Y/heatley mentioned to us also the possibility that he might arrange for the Company s man Williamson to. pay you a visit at Bnshire before long in order to talk the natter over with you. It seems that there is a likelihood of Williamson being in charge of the geological napping party if the plans nature. How the Company are to tackle • the problem of getting into the Barainittt area era of being allowed to stay there for a sufficient length of time when they are there, is a question that will need a good deal ox uhoaght.

Nothing further has been heard of the company's intention to send a representative to Muscat this winter.

The best time for the company's representative to reach i -r Arm-n after His Highness has returned Muscat would be the first week of April, after his g in-tmceTf to visit Jaalan later in April from Dhofar. The Sultan proposes himself and if it is the company's intention to survey this area n 18 desirable that His Highness be informed in detail of their proposals to enable him to make preliminary arrangements with the Shaikhs concerned during his visit.
