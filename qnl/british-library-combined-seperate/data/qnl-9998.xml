Some of this correspondence is between the Political Agency in Kuwait and the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah and is in Arabic (with English translations).The file also contains a letter from Major Maurice Patrick O'Connor Tandy, the Political Agent in Kuwait to Lieutenant-Colonel William Rupert Hay, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, concerning the possibility of appointing a British financial adviser in Kuwait, which was partly intended to block Shaikh Fahad from obtaining control of the country's finances department.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000d4#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000d4#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000d4#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
