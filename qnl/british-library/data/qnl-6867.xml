IN an article in the ' Quarterly Review ' of January 1917 the two main trends of thought running through German war literature on the Near and Middle East are clearly set forth; ' the first is occupied with the subject of a Central European agglomerate stretching from the Baltic and the North Sea to Constantinople, and thence dominating Asia to the Suez Canal and the Persian Gulf; the second dwells on the use of this agglomerate as a wedge to split the British Empire.' In the numerous extracts quoted from recent German publications it is shown how commercial penetration in Turkey, where German trade increased tenfold between 1889 and 1912, is in future to be solicitously fostered as a means to political ascendancy ; how the road from Berlin to the Persian Gulf is considered the vital nerve in German economic life and German policy ; how the phrase ' Ostend-Bagdad ' implies the undermining of Britain's command of the seas by boldly evading it with a land route; how the way is to be opened to Egypt and Persia, and through the Persian Gulf— where England's supremacy and the Pax Britannica must be broken—to the Indian Ocean and the lands around it. An old saying points the unwisdom of spreading the net in sight of the bird; if these professions of policy should appear in the German interest premature, they have certainly served to emphasise the paramount British interest of opposing to the uttermost the ' Drang nach Osten' It is indeed well put that, should the Prussian system secure its hold across the great land mass of the globe, from Denmark to Arabia, there would soon be no vital issue, whether in Europe, Asia, or Africa, that would not be decided from Berlin. After all that has been said and written in Germany on war aims—Turkey to be the pivotal point of Prussian world-power and future dominion; Antwerp to be surrendered as the gateway of German expansion; a reconstituied Poland under German authority ; the Chancellor's own avowal, on the eve of war, of the intended annexation of the French colonies—clearly the possibility of satisfying the ambitions of Imperial Germany can no longer enter into our calculations. No reasonable give-and-take settlement can be lasting or expedient with a great Military Power if it be set upon using every point of vantage gained as a means of threatening or under mining its neighbours. We are not concerned in the present article with such larger aspects of foreign policy ; nor are we inclined to discuss here whether in the years belore the war it would have been wiser, or indeed possible, to abstain from further efforts to reach a general settlement with Germany by friendly negotiation. Our immediate object is a narrower one ; it is confined to tracing the development of railway interests in Turkey and, in the light of that development and of available information, seeking to restore the perspective and focus the situation in which the later negotiations concerning the2 The Bagdad Railway. Bagdad Railway and cognate questions took place, and ultimately resulted in a draft agreement. Historically the development of railway enterprise in the Ottoman Empire may be dealt with in three periods, the first terminating in 1888; the second in 1903 ; and the last in June 1914. The First Period. In European Turkey railway enterprise was at first promoted, though by no means on the most approved conditions, by the late Baron Hirsch, who obtained a concession from the Sultan in 1867, and constituted the Oriental Railw r ay Company. The principal sections of this Company's system were those establishing communication between Constantinople and the Bulgarian frontier and between Salonica and Mitrovitza. bor some years the Company was under French influence; but the participation of Austrian capital and the close relations of Baron Hirsch with the Vienna Cabinet subsequently gave the undertaking an increasingly Austrian character until, at a much later period, the Deutsche Bank, acting through a Swiss institution, acquired the greater portion ol Baron llirsch's holdings in the concern. In Asiatic lurkey such railway enterprises as existed were at the outset entirely in British hands, ike Smyrna-Aidin, the Smyrna-Cassaba, and the Mersini—Adana lines were all built by British capital and with British material, and remained at lirst under butish management, while the line from Haidar Pasha to Ismidt, alter an attempt at direct administration by the Ottoman Government had broken down, was leased or some years to a syndicate presided over by a British subject. The railways in Asia * 1111 )l 01 igjHally undertaken by Englishmen were built in the hope and belief that early and leimineiative traffic would be secured ; and though, as in the case of the Smyrna-Aidin onipain —t ie oldest line in lurkey and one which, ever since its inauguration by on ra or de Redcliffe in 185b, has remained under British management—bold p ans ^cre oimed foi the future, the general idea was rather to push forward gradually, an on \ e nec e^sit^ and profit ol extension became clearly apparent.

The Ottoman Government undertook to guarantee 0 per cent, on the capital necessary for tlie first section as far as the Jjiiphrates, and to grant other privileges; but these terms were not then sufficiently attractive to induce capitalists to invest in a distant undertaking, and the support oi; the British (lovernment was sought in the form of a counter-guarantee for a period of twenty-five years. This financial assistance the Government did not feel justified in giving. 'Che scheme received a further check from the opening of the Suez Canal in 18G9 ; but it was nevertheless kept alive by those interested, and in l'S71-72 a Select Committee ol the House of Commons was appointed ' to examine and report upon the whole subject of railway communication between the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, and the Persian Gulf. 1 he report was to the effect that no insuperable obstacle existed in the way of the construction of a railway from some suitable port on the Mediterranean to some other suitable poit near the head of the Persian Gulf, but that there seemed no probability of the line being constructed by private enterprise, without a British Government guarantee, for it was plain from the evidence given that the railway could not at lirst pa} its way as a com mercial undertaking. Neither the Imperial nor the Indian Government pioved a \ illing to &lt;&gt;ive a guarantee, and no action was taken upon the Committees repoit. Fheie is, nevertheless, foundation for the belief that Lord Beaconsfield cleaily lecogniscd the dominating importance of this ancient trade route 5 indeed the occupation of Cj pius was not wholly unassociated, in his constructive mind, with the pioject of a^iai \Aay from the Gulf of Aiexandretta to the port of Basra ; and, at the time of the Congress of Berlin, he actually instructed Major (afterwards Sir Jolm) Ardagh to trace on a map the alignment of this railway. Possibly if Lord Beaconsfield s •Administration luu remained in power some of the profits on the Suez ( anal shares might have )ecn applied as financial guarantees for this enterprise. Parenthetically it may here be remarked that although in I So/ the Ottoman Government had been willing to support a line from Suedia to Basra, it is doubtlul, owincr to strategical and political reasons, whether at later periods they would have welcomed any railway from the Mediterranean to Bagdad until direct communication between Constantinople and Aleppo had first been established. . In 1892, however, Mr. G. N. (now Lord) Curzon observed in a published work :— ' . .I do not see how such a line, running through such a region, could possibly be expected 10 pay; ami I should indeed be loth to incur the responsibility of advising any Wernment to sa* cite itilf with even a limited guarantee ... In the very (act that neither the attention which t then excited nor the voluminous literature to which it gave birth have saved it from an almost comptete extinction, might be discovered an inferential argument against this scheme. Its superhoial attractions judiciously dressed up iu the garb of patriotism, were such as to allure many minds, and coulee U having felt, without having ever succumbed to, the fascination. While the British project was thus being consigned by a prominent authority to ' an almost complete extinction,' other schemes, as will presently be observed, had already entered upon a gradual but lascinating development. . .

Berlin-The Bagdad R ailway. 5 practical result; that British railway enterprise in Turkey had hitherto been planlos in its lines of development ; and that future historians, no doubt, would wonder how so few important results were accomplished after the conclusion of the Crimean War, when British interest in the Kast was still fresh, and our influence paramount and shared only with France. There were no doubt a number of causes which contributed to the failure of British enterprise to embark upon any large scheme of railway development in Turkey in the period referred to; some of them remained operative at a much later period and afforded opportunities well adapted to German methods. Firstly, there was the increasingly parlous state of Turkey's finances. From 18G0 to 1874 she raised almost annually a fresh loan to meet the interest on preceding ones ; in .1875 she defaulted, and it was only in 1881 that she was induced to compound with her creditors. Numerous bondholders in the United Kingdom were hit, confidence w^s undermined, and, with a wide field of enterprise elsewhere, as in South America and Canada where in the eighties the wheat requirements of the world gave great impetus to railway construction, Britisli capital found ample and more inviting outlets. Secondly, political conditions, though favourable to British enterprise in Turkey during the sixties and early seventies, for various reasons arising from events in the Near East and in Egypt, underwent a growing change for the worse in later years. It was then that the British press was full of denunciations of Ottoman misrule; thus Turkish sympathies were increasingly alienated, while the tendency of the British investor to go elsewhere was also stimulated. Thirdly, the disinclination of the Sultan Abdul Hamid, notwithstanding his alleged propitious disposition, to grant railway concessions was a formidable obstacle during the first part of his reign. At any rate it was found expedient to overcome His Majesty's hesitation by a novel mode of procedure ; and, in pressing such projects upon his attention, it became habitual if not essential to accompany them with an offer of a sum of ready money to be advanced to the Imperial Treasury as an equivalent for real or ideal advantages to be secured by the desired concession. The principal cause of the success of M. Kaulla in securing his railway concessions in 1888 was thiis held to consist in the fact that, during an unusually acute and painful financial crisis, the German syndicate offered to Turkey on relatively favourable terras a well-secured loan of £T. 1,500,000. It was deemed very doubtful, by competent observers at the time, whether any purely English railway syndicate would have been prepared to entoi into loan transactions of the kind. &gt; n • i Fourthly, there was undoubtedly lack of foresight and above all niadequate organisation and co-ordination of British interests on this occasion. A British subject, Colonel Alt, one of the lessees of the existing Haidar -Pasha -Ismidt line, was indeed desirous of securing the concession for an extension to Angora ; but he had not impressed the Sublime Porte by the manner in which he had administered the israidt line, nor did he produce convincing evidence to the Turks of the financial resources which he represented ; he also failed to advance opportunely the operative inducement of a laro-e loan. On the other hand, M. Kaulla was associated with other British interests, and the prospects of this consortium appeared from the first more promising. It had moreover been agreed by M. Kaulla and his London friends that British and Ueiman6 The Bagdad Railway. participation in the concessions, if secured, should bo equal. At that period co-operation with Germany was not deemed undesirable on political grounds, though in this instance it was not, for reasons of local expediency, openly avowed at Constantinople before the concessions were obtained. Sir W . A\ hite laid stress throughout upon the importance of continued British participation : but apparently some hitch eventually arose between M. Kaulla and his British associates ; no adequate precautions had been adopted by the parties interested to secure or to render permanent the British participation, and the whole capital was ultimately subscribed in Germany. Lastly, there never was in the United Kingdom anything approaching the fusion of the banking and industrial interests which gradually came about in Germany, where any promising scheme abroad or at home could be examined by an institution combining the financial power, the machinery o'f investigation and research, and the industrial connections amply sufficient to carry out any contract, however large. This tendency of German banking began to manifest itself from 1871, though the concentrated banking organisation of to-day may perhaps be said to date from somewhat later, when the unit began gradually to disappear and there sprung up in its place a system of groups of banks strongly controlled by some five or six institutions, working on the whole in harmony with each other and always in unison with the policy of the German Government. Whatever may be the merits or demerits ol ! such an organisation on wider grounds, it undoubtedly afforded a most powerful means for the promotion and retention of German concessions in Turkey, where certain important German banks have made a feature not only of promoting, but of themselves participating and remaining permanent shareholders in, industrial concerns. It appeals to us indeed that, apart both from political considerations in Turkey am ot er Lie to i s already indicated, which had an important influence, the initial success of the Germans in 1888 and its subsequent development are to be ascribed veiy largely to their banking and industrial organisation, to the application of that organisation to the peculiar conditions of Turkish finance, to the German practice of subordmating individual to collective effort in every department, and to the consequent t-lrrf , ^ 1 t . ? ic i powerful Government support could be afforded to any given fiplrl TL ^ r! i 10 11S i V co ^ ls * on competing German enterprise* in the same German Pm-o ^ , 10 c ^ os Gst co-operation between the German banks and the Doiiticallv 'f +1^ f l 110t overlooked that such co-operation is of action P bS1e 1 le banks are prepared to surrender some of their freedom fhe Second Period., Bagd^Say CtL 18 n t0 . ^ crucial 01le ^ '^tory of the the whole undert'ikinc and r ' 'i'' j ieu t ' ial 'ermany secured the concessions lor Government!

Stress is laid upon this governing factor of possession, for due appreciation the linal^'period 1111 SSefl regarding the Bagdad Railway question in I'lic lintish attitude towards the development of this question was necessarily influenced by our general political relations with the Great Powers; and it is not ri- uV 0 , a . n accurate lf ' ea of the problems and difficulties which confronted British diplomacy m regard to German railway aspirations in Turkey all through the second period without taking into account the many points of friction winch then existed with other Powers in different parts of the world. The German f oncession of I SO ;, which was secured in spite of important existing British railway interests in Asia Minor, was obtained at a moment when German diplomatic support was literally indispensable to us for administrative progress in Egypt; the crowning concession of 1899 was granted when attention was riveted upon Nicholson's Nek and the siege ol Ladysmith, and the danger of European complications formed a constant jneorciipation. I he political constellation at the beginning of the period under review was indeed far different from that which existed in the years preceding the outbreak of the present war. In January 1889, not long before his retirement, Prince Bismarck said in the Heichstag:— ' I regard England as our old and traditional ally, with whom we have no conflicts of interest. A\ hen 1 say 'ally.' ] use the word in its diplomatic sense; we have no treaty with England; but I wish to preserve, even in colonial questions, the contact with England which we have had now for at least 150 years. And, if I were persuaded that we might lose it, I should be wary, and try to prevent that happening.'* In point of fact, between 1884 and 1887—the time of ' Flaggenhissen und Vertrag- schliessen ' in Africa, as Bismarck termed it—the British Government had already had a preliminary experience of German hostility disguised as injured innocence ; but relations were not then durably disturbed, and, when Heligoland was ceded by Lord Salisbury's Government in 1890, the German Government gave, it is believed, an assurance of general support of British policy. By the middle of the period under review, however, our relations with the German Government were assuredly no longer so close as Prince Bismarck professedly believed them to be in 1689, while relations with other Powers showed as yet no marked improvement. We were indeed passing through the era of ' splendid isolation,' and a competent authority thus summarised the situation in October 1896 :— With the exception of Italy—whose position has been seriously weakened by her losses in men, money and prestige in Abyssinia—we have no avowed friend in the councils of Europe.

As to railway connection with the 1 ersian Lrult, there was a division of expert opinion. It appears to have been generally held that soonei 01 later it would be established ; b-it one section of opinion, including Sir \\ . \\ hite, held, that our main interest lay in a railway built under British auspices, joining the port or Alexandretta with some port on the Persian Gulf and taking in the intervening points of most importance ; while another intluential section of opinion deprecated the construction of any such line, on the three-fold ground that it would teud to create rival interests in Mesopotamia; that there appeared to be no early likelihood of alien concessionnaires constructing the line—a view which was indeed clung to by many authorities till a very much later period ; and that British interests in those regions would in any case be adequately protected by a firm policy on the shores of the Persian Gulf. Early in 1889 M. Kaulla constituted the Anatolian Railway Company to carry out the concessions in Asia Minor which he had obtained in the preceding year, and the work of construction to Angora was completed in 1892. The thoroughness and rapidity of construction soon led, but not without the added inducement of another much- needed loan, to a further German success ; in February 1S93 M. Kaulla received concessions for a twofold extension, the first from the railhead at Augora to the town of Caesarea, the second from Eski-Shehr—a point about midway on the existing line connecting Ilaidar Pasha with Angora—to Konia, the ancient Iconium. The con- yThe Bagdad Railway. 9 cession for a line to Ctesarea carried with it au obligation on the part of the recipient to prolong the line eventually from that point to Bagdad, but some years later the proposed line to Ctesarea and the idea of an extension thence to Bagdad were abandoned. The projected extension to Konia threatened to cut off two existing lines, the Smyrna-Aidin Railway and the Smyrna-Cassaba Railway, from their back- country. Both of these undertakings had originally been British, but impartial though competent observers had not failed to foresee and to indicate the dangers which threatened their position and prospects as such, and to urge that all differences between them should be sunk and an amalgamation of the two lines effected. This advice, which was based upon a belief that united they would be better able to resist external pressure, did not commend itself to their respective administrators. Early in 1893 the Ottoman Government exercised their right of repurchasing the Smyrna-Cassaba Railway; and the concession was granted to a Franco-Belgian Syndicate in 1894, together with the right of making an extension up to the Anatolian Railway's line at Afium-Karahissar. Finally, in 1899, the Germans acquired a controlling interest in the Smyrna-Cassaba Company. The Smyrna-Aidin Railway, on the other hand, remained, as already indicated, British in administration down to the outbreak of the present war ; and it generally had the reputation of being as well-built and well- conducted a line as any outside the United Kingdom. Moreover—and this was a unique phenomenon in Turkish railway enterprise—it received little financial assistance from the Ottoman Government at any time, and none at all after the first iew years. By 1893 the line had already been extended to Dinair ; and hopes of ultimately reaching Konia, to say nothing of bolder plans in a more distant future, were entertained. When, in 1893, the project of an extension of the Anatolian Railway to Konia was in contemplation, the British Ambassador, having regard to the interests of the Smyrna-Aidin Railway—which after all was an existing enterprise whose larger prospects of development were threatened with ruin by the proposed German extension —very properlv urged that there should be sufficient delay, before the grant of a definite concession by the Ottoman Government, for the several interests involved to be duly examined and, if possible, reconciled. The conduct of the German Government hereupon was impressive. Count Leyden, the German Consul-General at Caiio, intimated to Lord Cromer that his Government had been prepared to agree to certain essential administrative changes in Egypt, but that he ^as now instructed to withhold their consent, and to add that this decision was due to the attitude of the British Government towards German railway schemes in Asia Minor and that, in these circumstances, the British authorities were no longer to count upon German aid towards carrying out their plans in Egypt. I he full significance of this thieat ina\ be gauged in the light of the following passage quoted from Lord Miliiei s ViOiiv, ' England in Egypt,' published in 189^ :— 'Almost all European nations have interests in the Nile Valley, and these interests are entrenched in a manner which has no parallel elsewhere. We have seen that many acts of govern- ment cannot be performed in Egypt without the concurrence of the European Powers. It is not too much to say that the work of England in that country, however excellent, could not go on it the Powers in general were opposed to it.jq The Bagdad Railway. The mise en dcmeure of the German Government at Cairo was the more abrupt in that it was taken without any prior attempt to ascertain Irom oilicial Jjritish sources in Constantinople or in London precisely what action the British Ambassadoi had takei. No doubt the British Government were keenly moved by the rerman ( cnunche, am, it was understood at the time, did not fail to impress their sense of resentment at Berlin • whereupon the German Government modified their Egyptian attitude. 1 nit t he German extension to Konia was granted ; and the eil'orts ol the britisli Ambassadoi on behalf of the Smyrna-Aidin Company, which possessed no definite contractual rights to extend to Konia, were, indeed, foredoomed to almost certain failure even without the German threat at Cairo. It is true that Smyrna, in view of its harbour facilities and geographical position, was, as against Constantinople, the natural outlet tor pro- luce from Konia ; but there were at the Sublime Porte important political and strategical considerations which militated against the extension of the Smyrna lines to Konia ami beyond The Sultan's object was not to favour railway communication between that region and Smyrna, but, on the contrary, to see the Asia Minor trunk-lines converging on Constantinople, and to have such lines built for strategical purposes and al^o oi attracting to the Bosphorus the agricultural and other produce ot that part of the Imperial dominions. The German concessions of lS9o were based upon the secuntx ot kilometric guarantees, computed at an annual value of . several hundred thousands ol pounds. As the Imperial budget already showed a deficit of over 500,000/. for the current year, misgivings were felt by expert authorities as to the ability ol the I urkish Treasury to support the weight of the obligations thus assumed. While the development of the resources of the Empire and the promotion of its prosperity by the establishment of railways on sound principles would admittedly have been to the advantage of the bond holders, the kilometric guarantees were so graded that they seemed to create a premium on bad working oC the lines, and afforded no apparent inducement for the development of traffic beyond a fixed limit. At that time German financial interests, other than those in railways, scarcely existed in Turkey; and the gr^at mass of Turkish bondholders were English and French. The British delegate on the Ottoman Public Debt Adminis tration did not fail to utter a note of warning as to the serious danger to the Turkish Treasury, and therefore to the security of the bondholders w r hom he represented, involved in these railway promoting operations, with the result that an inspired article appeared in the 'Cologne Gazette' attacking him on account of the hesitation he so justifiably entertained, and even threatening general measures of retaliation against British interests elsewhere. A series of bad harvests marked the years succeeding the granting of the German concessions in 1893, and combined with the general fall in the price of agricultural produce to increase the burden on the Turkish Treasury, which in 1S95 had to find a quarter of a million sterling to meet guarantees on behalf of the Anatolian Railway alone. The German banks still held a large number of unissued bonds, which had not yet found a market; and the miserable traffic earnings shown by the published accounts of the Anatolian Railway were such as to discourage investment in the concern.

Thus the mistaken impression was encouraged that a railway extension to Bagdad and beyond was not a serious financial proposition for a very long period oi time ; and, although the revenue of both the Konia and Angora lines showed remarkable expansion after 1896, while the burden on the Ottoman Government was correspondingly reduced, and the country was materially benefited by the increased prosperity of the provinces opened up, still it was generally argued that these lines tapped some oi' the richest parts of Asia Minor and that similar results could not be derived from a line crossing the arid wastes of the upper Euphrates and Tigris basin. Not a few w liteis according } found comfort in the persuasion that, without an increase in the Turkish customs duties, for which British assont would admittedly be necessary, it would not be practicable for the Turkish Treasury, in its chronic state of penury, to provide the substantial revenue which would be required as a guarantee for the Bagdad Railway to be built and to be worked ; and, even down to April 1903, some over-confident British publicists still exalted this view to an article of faith. ™ n i i • i All through the Armenian horrors of 1890 and lb9/ Germany had remained studiously indifferent to any international obligations to promote refonns m ^ sia ^ lu 1 °^j she had favoured Turkey in the settlement after the Greek war of &gt; b ^ e had laul down her flute in Crete.

It may be concluded that the German Government had a very clear indication ot the objections entertained by Russia to the northern variant before the Tuico-Geiman railway agreement of December 1899 was reached, l our months later the Russo- Turkish ' Black Sea Basin agreement' was concluded, definitely securing to Russian enterprise all railway construction in Northern Asia Minor. So much for the attitude of Russia. As to that of France, while some French financiers did not abstain from participation, the Government consistently refused, pending an agreement equitable to the interests of all the Powers, to allow a quotation on the Paris Bourse of any issue relating to the Bagdad Railway. The attitude of the British Government, in presence of the German concession of 1899, was to resist any encroachment by Turkey or any other foreign Power tending to disturb the political status quo on the shores of the Persian Gulf. In pursuance of this policy various measures were adopted, and attempts on the part ol Turkey to curtail the authority of the Sheikh of Koweit were frustrated not only by local action but by representations at Constantinople ; moreover the German Government were given very clearly to understand that, in so far as the increase of the 'Turkish customs and the eastern terminus of the line were concerned, the British Government must determine their future attitude towards the German enterprise in the light of any proposals which might be made as to British interests. We propose to pass over the actual texts of the Turco-German agreements of December 1899 and January 1902. The first of these conceded in principle what the Germans sought, but left all details to be settled at some future date ; and the concession of 1902 was eventually replaced by the definitive Bagdad Railway Convention of March 1903. After touching upon some of the leading provisions of this last instru ment, we shall bring our narrative of the second period to a close with a short reference to the negotiations, which culminated in failure in April 1903, regarding British participation in the projected railway enterprise. Under the definitive Bagdad Railway Convention (1903) the Ottoman Government granted a concession for 99 years to the Anatolian Railway Company for an extension from the Konia line to Bagdad and Basra, via Adana, Tell-Habesh, Mosul and Sadijeh. The concession included branch lines to Aleppo, to Urfa, to Khanikin on the Persian fiontiei, and to a point on the Persian Gulf to be settled subsequently ; preferential ri g ht8 were also given for branches towards Marash, Aiutab, Birijik, Mardin, Erbil, luz Kharmath, and Hit, and for any lines connecting the maiu-line with the Mediterranean at points situated between Mersina and Tripoli in Syria.

It will thus be seen that the Germans had the prospect of dominating railway enterprise in Asiatic Turkey, for their control would now altogether extend to nearly 3,000 miles of track, to say nothing of the influence, more or less veiled, which they might ultimately expect to exercise over the Iledjaz line. As the new concession embraced mining options, terminal harbour facilities, and privileges of inland naviga tion, the Germans were seemingly in a fair way to acquire complete control of the traffic by water as well as by land. Moreover, the Bagdad Railway was to traverse one region of enormous potential development, where the supremacy of British-Indian trade had long been undisputed ; it was to pass Kerbela and Nejef, Shiah shrines visited annually by thousands of British-Indian subjects; and it must, in the original form of the concession of 1903, have profoundly influenced the political situation on the shores of the Persian Gulf. In 1888, and again in 1893, there may have been a lack of imagination, grasp, and constructive policy on the part of the liritish Government. But in IU03, when the question of British participation in the Bagdad Railway was under consideration, the Prime Minister showed that he had the clearest perception of the German prospects of success:— ' I have no doubt whatever,' Mr. Balfour stated in the House of Commons on April 8, 1903, ' that, whatever course English financiers may take, and whatever course the English Government may pursue, sooner or later this great undertaking will be carried out. There is no difficulty in point ol money. Whether the English Government assist or do not assist, it is undoubtedly in the power of the British Government to hamper and impede and inconvenience any project of the kind; but that the project will ultimately be carried out, with or without our having a share in it, there is no question whatever. Therefore the point on which His Majesty's Government will ultimately have to decide, and which the House may safely and wisely take into consideration, is whether it is or is not desirable that, if this railway connecting the base of the Meditermnean with the Persian Gulf is to be constructed, British capital and British interests should be as largely represented in it as the capita and interest of any foreign Power. That is exactly the question which will have to be considered and determined.' * On the same occasion the Prime Minister, while recognising that the question was not without difficulty and observing that the Government intended to give the whole subject their most careful consideration, indicated three points which ought not to be lost sight of :— # Was it desirable or not that what would be the shortest route to India should be entirely in the hands of foreign, to the exclusion of British, capitalists ? . „ . n i* v i 11 i .

Was the British producer more likely to be able to take advantage of it, if English capital was largely interested, than if it was confined to foreign capital ? The Prime Minister had already stated on the preceding day that, while no final arrangements had been arrived at, the suggestions which, it was understood, were to be made, and would be carefully considered, were : — (1) that British capital and British control were to be on an absolute equality with the capital and control of any other Power; (2) that, in respect of the negotiations then going on with the 1 iirkish Government for a new commercial treaty (and which, quite apart from the Bagdad Railway, raised the question of increasing the Turkish customs). His Majesty's Government should not object to a reasonable increase in the customs duties, although a part of the increase might be used in guaianteeing a railway so important for the commercial interests of Turkey; (3) that, if the railway should prove to be a substantially better route for conveying the mails to India, it might be so used, on terms to be agreed upon subsequently; (4) that His Majesty's Government should assist, not by mone} or tlie promise of money, but by their good offices in providing a proper terminus at or near Koweit* oit A fortnight later the Prime Minister announced that: — ' the arrangements which have lately been under the consideration of His Majesty's Government were designed to place the [Bagdad] railway, including the existing Anatolian Railway, throughout its whole length from sea to sea, under international control, and to prevent the possibility of preferential treatment tor the goods or subjects of any one country. In these arrangements it was suggested, inter rt/m, that equal powers of control, construction, and management should be given to German. French, and English interests. After careful consideration of these proposals, His Majesty's Government have come to the conclusion that they do not give to this country sufficient security for the application of the principles above referred to ; and they have therefore intimated that they are unable ' lo «dve the suggested assurances with regard to the policy which they might hereafter adopt as to the conveyance of the Indian mails by the projected route, as to facilities at Koweit, or as to the appropriation of a part ot the lurkish customs revenue in aid of the contemplated guarantee.'t It is certam that the final German proposals in April 1903 did not rive to British capital and British control that'absolute equality ' with the Germans, over the line from o stantinople to the Persian Gulf, which was to be one indispensable condition of a compliant attitude on the part of His Majesty's Government.

To iud-e bv Mr Half™.-a statements m Parhament neither of these consoling theories appears to have Teen entertamed by he Bnt.sh Government. Koweit was of course known to possess certain advantages, but it was known to be equally lacking in others. The popular view that ' vvaa w ' a f «PPareutly due to the conclusions of a technical mission which the (xermans had sent, to the Persian Gulf to investigate a few years before; and public opinion, fortified with the persistent reiteration of these false and soothing premises ami suspicious ol the extreme anxiety of the Germans to secure British co-operatiou, nas unmistakably opposed m I'.HJ.i to the desired assurances of liritish compliance in respect of koweit and the customs increase, being given. Moreover the avowed io,-ti i v ot Hie German public and press, and the scarcely less hostile, though more guarded, language of German statesmen during the South African War had exercised a protound influence in England, and, together with the recent humiliations we had i xpoi lenced I )y co-operating with Germany in China and in Venezuela, combined to render uninviting further joint ventures with Berlin. W e have considered attentively the copious comments to which the negotiations ol 190.-! gave rise, with a view to ascertain whether any constructive policy was n&lt; 1 \(x .itc( 1 as a piactical alternative. Ihe most deficiite, in fact tlie only suggestion ot this kind which we have been able to trace is that which was adumbrated in the autumn of that year by a writer of recognised authority, Sir Valentine Chirol. He appeared indeed confident that tiie Germans, while their cue was to proceed with the iii^t p^it ol the railway without displaying any concern about the future, would sooner or later have to iace the difficulties to overcome which they had already wanted, and would still want, our help. ' When that day comes,' he proceeded, 'must our reply be an unconditional non possutnus ? By no means, if our interests are properly safeguarded—not merely our interests in the railway itself as a business undertaking, but our Imperial interests in the region which it specially affects.' His proposal, in substance, was that England should build, control, and manage the Khanikin branch and the sections of the railway in the Mesopotamia delta, where our interests centred, and that Germany and France should have the same rights on similar terms with regard to the line from Constantinople downwards, the whole line being worked on a joint traffic agreement.* V\ as this in fact a practical suggestion ? Even if every allowance were made for Britain's established position and secular interests in Mesopotamia, we do not think the Germans, short of being driven to the last extreme of financial impotence or political embarrassment, could have accepted this solution. They had built the Anatolian line as far as Konia single-handed; it was they who had secured the whole concession from Xonia to the Persian Gulf ; and now it was in effect suggested that they should master the formidable barrier of the Taurus and the Amanus, and then be invited to abandon to others the completion of the enterprise, including the development of Mesopotamia with all its mineral wealth and agricultural prospects. We do not believe that any terms Great Britain could have offered in 1903 would have induced Germany to accept such a settlement as this ; and, as the railway progressed, and moreover Germany's * Valentine Chirol: 'The Middle Eastern Question,' pp. 228 and 229.

On the 25th October, 1J01, the Koma J^ie^n section of the Bagdad Railway was inaugurated with much pomp and ceremony, ^s completed as far as Bulgurhi, but at that point work was discontinued and n 1908 the terminus was still Bulgurlu. The arrest of progress was the state of the money market in Berlin and the absence of funds in 1 uikey a\aila c as securitv for further construction loans. In 1907 the levers agieec to a p( i C( n surcharge on the Turkish customs duties for a period of seven years, but on terms which involved its application to the cause of Macedonian relonns and in t prevented any part of the proceeds from being used to finance the Bagdad Kailway or to release other funds for that purpose. The considerable delay m consUu^ion seemed almost to justify the anticipations of those who had contended that e project was incapable of fulfilment without British tinancial assistance. m June 1908 another stride was made, financial arrangements being concludecl »&gt; t le Bagdad Railway Company and the Turkish Government, in pursuance ot the provisions of the Convention of 1903, for the construction oi two more sections, 840 kilometres in all, whicn would bring the line to Aleppo and El tlelif.T he B agdad R ailway. 17 Iheii came tlie Coustitulioual revolution in July 1908, and the advent to power oi the ^ oung Turkish partj^ with its League of Union and Progress. The atmosphere of unfriendliness to Oreat Britain which had been excited by Abdul Ham id and his corrupt entourage during his personal reign disappeared ; the obvious sincerity of British congratulations and the position of Great Britain as a great exponent of con stitutional government led the new government of Turkey to look to Great Britain to guide her through the difficulties created by a complete reversal of the whole system of government; and simultaneously German influence, which had rested to a large extent upon the German Emperor's support of the Sultan, received a severe check, though the Bagdad Railway concession, which now came in for severe criticism, could not be disavowed as it was held by virtue of a signed convention, that of 1903. But gradually, despite the effective support of Great Britain to Turkey during the Bosnian and Bulgarian crisis, a reaction appears to have taken place in 1909 and 1910, and the German Government regained much of their influence in Constantinople. The change seems to have been due to a variety of causes. On the one hand the Young Turks realised that their obvious determination to maintain the predominance of the Moslem element throughout the Empire, the imposition of restrictions on political and personal liberty, the Adana massacres, and the prolonged retention of martial law in the capital had led to disappointment and criticism in England ; they were aggrieved by our attitude on the Cretan question ; our occupation of Egypt was in conflict with the growing Nationalist policy of the Turkish Government; our refusal to grant, uncon ditional^, the request for the increase of 4 per cent, in the Customs duties led to considerable disappointment. But perhaps the principal cause of the change of attitude was the development of a chauvinist and aggressive policy on the part of the Turkish Government which brought them into conflict with us as regards the maintenance of the status quo in the Persian Gulf, where, for example, a palace of our protege the Sheikh of Mohammerah was bombarded by them, and British commercial interests in Mesopotamia were actively obstructed. On the other hand the steady penetration of Turkish commerce by Germany ; the calculated abstention in German publications and speeches from any comment or criticism on the uncon stitutional methods employed by the Turkish Government; the idea, which undoubtedly obtained, that Germany was not 'suspect' as regards Turkish territory, and that their projects in Asia Minor were commercial and not territorial; and the sale of cruisers to Turkey at a time of crisis ;—all contributed powerfully, it would appear, to cause the Turks to lean towards Germany. In the result, the Bagdad Railway Co found that no difficulties were placed in the way of carrying out their valuable concessions ; work was resumed ; and, by the end of 1910, extensions were proceeding rapidly both from the railhead at Bulgurlu towards Adana, and from Adana itself, and the section to the foot of the Taurus on the Bulgurlu side was nearing completion.• In March 1911 the Germans concluded a further arrangement with the Turks, securing the appropriation of the available surplus of revenues, which had already been allocated for other sections of their railways, as security for the continuation of the line from El Helif to Bagdad in accordance with the Convention of 1903, and agreeing to surrender to a new Company the sections of the Bagdad Railway between Bagdad and the Gulf, but only on condition that the Bagdad Company should participate in theThe Bagdad Railway. new Company to an extent not less than any foreign (i.e., non-Turkish) element. 1 Ins reservation, if maintained, was an absolute bar to any scheme of British predominance on the Gulf sections. . . r . + i ^ Russia now somewhat precipitately squared accounts with (jermany regau nig 10 Bagdad Railway ; and this assuredly weakened the position of the trench and British Governments, who nevertheless clearly continued to maintain a policy ol co-operation in this question and to abstain from any arrangement with Germany until all three Powers could agree, as apparently was the case in June 1014. The Potsdam Agree ment of 1911, which was negotiated in the autumn oi 1910, bound Kussia mlci a la ' not to oppose the Bagdad Railway'—an ambiguous expression which, not being defined in terms, was afterwards construed by Petrograd, on the strength ol what had passed orally, merely as implying Russian assent to construction as lar as Bagdad^ and by Berlin as acquiescence in the whole Bagdad Railway Convention of March 11)03. In August 1911 Sir E. Grey announced in the House of Commons that negotiations had been^in progress for some time respecting the terms upon which His Majesty's Government would agree to an increase of the 1 urkish customs duties, and that, incidentally, these negotiations bore on the Bagdad Railway question. He added that the British Government had recently made proposals to the i urkish Government to secure economic equality on the railway, and a definite settlement as regards the region of the Persian Gulf.* We think that this may be taken as a convenient starting point from which to date the final negotiations with the Ottoman Government, although in March 1911 Sir E. Grey had already made an important speech drawing attention to certain out standing factors, and the following extracts are essential to a due appreciation of the position :— ' The time to oppose the Bagdad Railway, if it was to be opposed in British interests, was before the concession was granted The concession has not been extended, and it is within the rights of the German concessionnaires and of the Turkish Government to carry out the terms of that concession as they please in Turkish territory ' We are not quite so helpless in the matter as might be gathered These railways in Turkish territory are going to cost money. The Turkish Government some years ago received consent for a limited period for a 3 per cent, increase of the . customs duty. The Turkish Government have since applied for a 4 per cent, increase of the customs duty. That cannot be levied without our consent. I wish to see the new regime in Turkey strengthened. I wish to see them supplied with resources which will enable them to establish strong and just government in all parts of the Turkish Empire. I am aware money is needed for those purposes, and I would willingly ask British trade to make a sacrifice, so far as it is a sacrifice to British trade, for those purposes, but, if the money is to be used to promote railways which may be a source of doubtful advantage to British trade, and still more if the money is to be used to make railways which will take the place of means of communication which have been in the hands so tar of British concessionaries, then I say it will be impossible for us to agree to that 4 per cent, increase of the customs duty until we are satisfied that British trade interests will be satisfactorily guarded ' 1 have been careful to emphasise that the Bagdad Railway is a German concession in Turkish territory, but, if the Bagdad llailway is to proceed further than Turkish territory, then of course our diplomatic position in the matter becomes very different from what it is so long as it remains purely in Turkish territory. We are not anxious to disturb the status quo in the Persian Gulf. To a great Parliameutary Debates,' Vol. xxix, 939 aud 2081T he B agdad H ailwav extent that stains quo has been built np by us in previous generations. We have practically opened the Persian Gulf to trade and kept it open. That has been a matter of historical knowledge for years past. We are not anxious to have a forward policy in the Persian Gulf, to acquire^hew territory, or to disturb the status quo, but if the status quo is going to be disturbed by others, then we must undoubtedly use our resources to maintain the position we have in the Persian Gulf. Part of the status quo is that we have entered into treaty obligations with the Sheikh of Koweit, and in any negotiations which there may be or in any changes which may take place it is an obligation upon us to see our treaty obligations towards the Skeikii of Koweit in maintaining his position are fultilled. '* We understand that the British proposals of 1911 included some arrangement for securing a measure of British control over the sections of the Bagdad Railway between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf. There is evidence that, before this, the British Government had contemplated an alternative railway, under British control, along the Tigris Valley from Bagdad to the Gulf; but manifestly this proposal would have been unattractive to the Turks since it would have diverted traffic from the projected German railway, and, pro ianto, have increased the burdens on the Turkish Exchequer, which had of course to make good any deficit in the gross earnings of that railway. Be this as it may, all through the summer of 1912 two Turkish delegates (Djeyad Bey and Reshid Bey) were in London carrying on with the British authorities tentative discussions, which were wholly fruitless, both in regard to the railway question and to the definition of the status quo in the Persian Gulf. Turkish encroachments were meanwhile causing increasing concern; and Turkish ollicials at Basra for example started to remove buoys which had been placed many years before by the British authorities off the entrance to the Shatt-el-Arab, and thus to interfere with navigation. Serious complications had also arisen owing to the forward policy of the lurks at various points on the Persian frontier, and the rights of the British holders ol oil concessions in the region of Zohab appeared to be jeopardised. It was apparently in the late summer of 1912 that the British Government made fresh proposals, which formed the basis of the settlement reached before the outbreak of the present war. During the last three years a number of incoherent, and manifestly incorrect, statements have appeared in Germany regarding the Bagdad Railway negotiations with England; Reventlow, Rohrbach, and other writers have regaled the German public with partial references to the draft settlement and misleading inferences as to its outstanding features. Various circumstantial disclosures, which clearly emanate from enemy sources, have also been made in other countries. Thus among American papers we may instance the Philadelphia 'Public Ledger, of the 22nd Octobei, l.)lb, v&gt; lie i purported to reveal the substance of a number of articles of agreement seriatim; and several carefully inspired articles have likewise been issued from tune to tune in the Dutch, Scandinavian, and Swiss papers. In Constantinople, where the German Embassy leased a prominent shop-window at the beginning of the war for purposes of proselytising and propaganda, a whole series of misleading and delusive pictorial displays was exhibited. In England, moreover, not a few recent utterances in tiie press have tended, rather by lack of precision than by positive indication, to obscure the fundamental fact that the Germans had obtained the concession, in principle, tor the Bagdad Railway in 1899, and the definitive concession in 1903, and therelore to * 'Parliamentary Debates,'' Vol. xxix, 1282, 1283, 1284, 1285.20 T he B agdad R ailway. misconceive the whole character of the Anglo-German negotiations of 1913-14. Thus Sir Harry Johneton, in an article in the 'Daily Chronicle' of September 6, 1917, suggests that 'our Foreign Office was prepared to conclude agreements with Germany enormously widening the sphere of her colonial action in the Turkish dominions '— an assumption for which there is no evidence. We have been at some pains to collate the authoritative statements which were made both in Germany and in this country, as w r ell as in Paris and Petrograd, on the subject of these complicated negotiations before the outbreak of war. The comparison with more recent versions of what actually took place is instructive. We believe that we have succeeded in compiling,—from Parliamentary Debates in both Houses in 1911-1914, from the 'North German Gazette,' from various issues of the ' Times,' including those of the 14th and 17th May, 1913, from articles written in the summer of 1914 by Dr. Hans Plehn and other German writers whose compositions bear traces of the heavy hand of semi-official revision, and from a number of pre-war announcements in France, Russia and Constantinople—a pretty accurate summary of events during the period of negotiation. We are also able to reproduce a map showing approximately not only railway but also navigation concessions in Asiatic Turkey, as they appeared in July 1914. Parenthetically we have been much impressed by the virtual unanimity which apparently existed in this country during 1913 and the first half of 1914 in regard to the expediency of the Bagdad Railway settlement, the essential provisions of which were generally known ; indeed, some of those organs of opinion which had been most uncompromising in their condemnation of the negotiations of 190o now expressed a distinct measure of satisfaction. 0 W hen it became clear that the Germans were satisfied that the customs increase was not an indispensable condition of the ultimate completion of the line, and that they were therefore not prepared to go beyond the arrangement they had reached with lurkey m 1911 m regard to the sections from Bagdad to the Gulf, two courses were open to the British Government. They could either have adopted a non possumus, but in the end ineffectual, attitude of withholding indefinitely British assent to the customs aicrease; or they could have sought some other basis of negotiation. It was the second of these alternatives that they adopted.

Hakki Pasha arrived in London to negotiate on this basis early in 1913. Eapid progress was made in the ensuing months; and, when the negotiations had reached an advanced stage, Turkey intimated that she wished to obtain our assent to the creation of further sources of revenue, in the shape of consumption taxes and municipal octroi dues. The British Government agreed to extend the basis of negotiation as desired, provided that various outstanding questions, in which our interests were closely involved, were simultaneously settled. i hese included the ratification of the Aden boundary agreement of 1905; the regularise Hon of the legal position of British institutions (religious, educational, and medical) in Turkey; the acceptance of the general principle that all irrigation works in Mesopotamia, other than the very considerable sections for which British firms alone had already tendered, should be put up to open tender; the reduction of the Turkish light' dues levied upon shipping ; a settlement in regard to the oil concessions of the provinces of Mosul and Bagdad, in certain fields in the caza of Ajloun (south of Lake Tiberias) and in the Farsan Archipelago; the settlement, by arbitration, of a large number of British pecuniary claims ; the removal of the Turkish veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt; and, finally, the prolongation from 1950 till 1999 of the concession of the Smyrna-Aidin Railway, together with the grant of extensions of the line (amounting in all to 200 miles) and of rights of navigation on Lakes Eghirdir and Beyshehir. What were the reasons which led to the inclusion of the first four points we have enumerated as British conditions for assenting to the customs increase ? They are to be sought in the historical position of (treat Britain in the Persian Gull, which is thus eloquently described in a paper, too -little-known, by Mr. 1. J. Bennett, entitled ' The Past and Present Connection of England with the Persian Gulf'-' :— ' If England has become, in any sense, the arbiter and guardian of the Gulf, it has not been through a restless ambition urging her on to the control of the waste places of the earth, but in obedience to the calls that have been made upon her in the past to enforce peace between warring tribes, to give a free course to trade, to hold back the arm of the marauder and the oppressor, to stand between the slave-dealer and his victim . 1 i , ' In the case of England and the Persian Gulf the position is unique; for, although England has at no tune enjoyed or even asked for territorial acquisitions in those legu'iis, slit, has for geneiations borne burdens there which no other nation has ever undertaken anywhere, except in the capacity of Sovereign; she has had duty thrust upon her without dominion; she has kept the peace amongst people who are not her subjects; has patrolled, at intervals, waters o\ei which sht. has tnjo^ed no formal lordship; has kept, in strange ports, an open door through which the traders of every nation might have as free access to distant markets as her own.' Turkey, on the other hand, never exercised an effective influence on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and on the waters of that sea relied in the past * Journal of the Society of Arts, June 13, 1902.22 The TUgdad Railway. exclusively on British armed assistance. Thus, throughout the latter half of the eighteenth century the East India Company's ships assisted the Pasha of Bagdad in his operations against the Arabs above and below Basra; in ITrl British- built vessels were supplied for the Pasha, who, finding himself unable to man them, called upon the British Resident to employ them as he might think best for Turkish interests; in 1778 the British aided by naval action in regaining for Turkey the town of Basra from the Persians ; and in 1798, when the Sultan of Oman had prepared to prosecute by force a pecuniary claim against the Pasha of Bagdad, the Ottoman authorities besought the good offices of the British Resident, and in the end the matter was amicably adjusted at Bushire. It is the simple truth that the com mercial prosperity of Bagdad and Basra during the past three centuries, and their whole maritime trade, were built up and maintained through British enterprise and sacrifice. The attitude of successive British Governments for over forty years before the out break of the present war was based upon the contention that, prior to Midhat Pasha's expedition to Nejd in 1871, which resulted in the establishment of one or two isolated military posts in the coast regions of El Hasa and El Katr, there were on the Arabian coast no symbols of Turkish authority, no Turkish jurisdiction, effective or ineffective, south or east of Ojeir ; and the influence which existed between Ojeir and Koweit was ineffective and frequently interrupted. At Koweit, wrote Sir Lewis Pelly in 1863, ' the suzerainty of the Sublime Porte is merely nominal; the Arabs acknowledge the Turks as we do the 39 Articles, which all accept and none remember.' Yet Turkey laid claim to Muscat in 1870 and 1879, and to the whole of Arabia in iS74, 1883, and 1902— pretensions which the British Government always contested. Nevertheless, the region of El Katr henceforth became a favourite resort of the Arab pirates, and British naval forces were repeatedly thwarted in their efforts to capture them owing to the connivance of Turkish officials. At the end of 1910, moreover, Turkish encroach ments against the British de facto position at the head of the Gulf had become so serious that peremptory remonstrances had to be addressed to the Ottoman authorities, and it became essential to get our position recognised de jure. It was in such circumstances that the recognition of our position de jure was made a principal object of our negotiations with Hakki Pasha. The British definition of the status quo in the Persian Gulf was accepted in all essential details; and Turkey agreed in substance to all the other points laid down by the British Government in 1912 as enumerated above. She abandoned her pretensions to suzerainty over the peninsula of El Katr and adjacent regions. Great Britain recognised the nominal suzerainty of the Porte over Koweit, which, with the adjacent territory and islands claimed by the Sheikh, was to be an autonomous kaza of the Ottoman Empire; and Turkey undertook not to interfere with the internal affairs of the Sheikh and his subjects, and to recognise the validity of the conventions concluded by the Sheikh with the British Government, giving us, inter alia, control of his foreign relations, and preventing him from alienating any portion of his territory without our consent. A writer of recognised authority, in the 'National Review ' of August 1913, expressed the opinion that the compromise reached left us in a solid position at Koweit, and that there were other undertakings which gave us all we required. J t appears, however,—and this, having regard to the innate propensity of TurkishT he B agdad R ailway. 23 officials to intrigue, was indeed an unfortunate concession on our part—that we agreed to a urkish agent residing at Koweit. Although the agent was expressly debarred Irom any intervention other than the protection of the interests of Ottoman subjects from other parts ol the Empire, the arrangement was, we apprehend, but too likely to o-ive rise to locd friction. On the other hand, provision was made to secure both the 0 an 1 , 11 1 s ^ nen( '' ^ ie Sheikh of Mohammerah, in the undisturbed enjoyment of their valuable date properties on the Turkish bank of the Shatt-el-Arab. Generally speaking, the Koweit settlement appears to have been satisfactory. J he future of the Shatt-el-Arab presented a formidable problem. This was due to us nnpoitance as the approach to Basra; to its peculiar status, which is sui qcner'is amongst inter -state rivers inasmuch as the whole waterway is admittedly dc rure wnii m I urkish limits, while the Sheikh of Mohammerah has always exercised a dc /ar^o jurisdiction on its waters ; to the complicated tribal conditions on its banks • and to its complex and ever-changing physical conditions, both above and below its junction with the Persian River Karun. To deal with this complicated situation, and witli the anticipated development of traflic on the river with the advent of the 'r j • 1 ? a v ^ ay ' Turl ^y.agi-eed to the institution of a Riverain Commission with a urkisli iagade and British control. The Commission was to be empowered to lew dues on all vessels entering the river; but this, in view of the Capitulations, could only be done by agreement with the Powers concerned, and it was one of the points necessarily dealt with in direct negotiation between England and Germany. We cannot trace, even in bare outline, the satisfactory settlement of the Turco- Persian frontier (extending over 700 miles from Mount Ararat to the Gulf) which had ^ )ec ^ i n dispute since Sultan Murad concluded his first treaty with Shall Sefi in 1639—an instrument which certainly failed to justify its designation in the preamble as 'happy leaves, a nosegay plucked from the thornless garden of concord and tied by the hands of the plenipotentiaries of the two great States into articles of amity and friendship.' Nor can we deal at length with the question of navigation on the Tigris and Euphrates. Great Britain had possessed, ever since the reign ol Charles 1, special priveleges on these rivers ; but, from 1^45 the Ottoman authorities had persistently adopted an obstructive attitude in regard to our interests. By the settlement the whole control of navigation, including the requisite measures of river conservancy which were specially desirable in view of tha wasteful irrigation methods of the Arabs, was to be placed in British hands. The existing British navigation company was to be confirmed in the privileges which it had ^enjoyed, including the right to fly the British flag. A new Turkish company was to be formed,' under the chairmanship of Lord Inchcape, to take over the existing Turkish navigation company, with power to add indefinitely to its fleet of vessels. Fifty per cent, of the share capital in the new Turkish company, with a casting vote, was to be British, i he remainder of the capital was to be subscribed by the Turkish Government without power of alienation, except as regards twenty per cent., which was to be transferred to the Germans, in consideration of the immediate surrender by the latter of their navigation rights under the Bagdad Railway Convention of 1903 and of their agreement to British participation in the construction of the ports of Bagdad and Basra (as will presently appear).T he B agdad R ailway. 24 s. »«* &lt;«'»rrswe ^ SSSf-ffiWEV Tlie subs O. the ..■■■.■■«• '™« i ' was as folloA\s . -Roaflad R'lilwav svstem which, was Great Britain undertook not to oppose of tlie nav i g ation carefully defined.

Apart from the varied political objects which were locally secured—objects which had been a first aim of our policy in those regions for a long period of years—the settlement would have resulted in substantial advantages to British industry and trade. As regards railway development, our freedom of action in negotiation was indeed seriously handicapped by existing conventions and established rights, but, notwithstanding this, the mileage of the only existing British railway was to be increased by over 50 per cent, its concession was to be prolonged till 1999, and other points of importance were to be finally arranged ; an opening was also foreshadowed for British railway enterprise on a minor scale (as feeders for the river navigation) in the delta of the Euphrates and Tigris; here, in the great scheme of irrigation, a fair field was assured to British contractors, who moreover were secured in prior rights to carry out works involving in cost many millions of pounds; in the navigation of the rivers of Mesopotamia British enterprise would have taken a dominating part; in the construction of the ports of Bagdad and Basra British participation was provided for notwithstanding the practical German monopoly of 1903 ; in the development of the extensive oil fields of Bagdad and Mosul, and in the smaller fields of Ajloun and the Farsan islands, British interests would have had the principal share ; a large number of British pecuniary claims were to be submitted to arbitration ; and discrimination against British or Indian merchandise was to be permanently excluded on all railways in Asiatic Turkey. The subject of this article, covering as it does a period of over half a century, is so vast that we cannot here enter even into the essential details o! Ottoman liuaiice with which the progress of the Bagdad Railway is so closely related ; hut we have, in the course of our enquiry, made it a principal aim to examine all the relevant statistics, the annual reports on the administration ol the Ottoman Public Debt, and the financial rearrangements which resulted from the loss of territory and revenue sustained by Turkey in .1913 owing to the first Balkan War. We will confine ourselves to statin o- that in 1899 the kilometric guarantees had involved an annual charge oi £ T. 9007000, while in 1913 that charge had fallen to £ T. 238,000, in spite of an increase in the interval of 000 miles in the railways under kilometric guarantees. Our deduction, in which we have obtained expert concurrence, is that for several years before the outbreak o£ the present war it was always practically certain, so far as linance was concerned, that the railway would be completed as lar as Bagdad by the autumn o 1915 at the latest, even without Turkey's available revenues being augmented by raising the customs duties. The engineering obstacles between Konia and Aleppo won c in due course have been overcome ; the long stretch of desert between Aleppo and Mosul would have been crossed ; and all would then be ready for starting upon the remunerative branch to Khanikin and the sections between Bagdad and tlie Persian (mlt. itn- drawal of British opposition could at the most only have advanced the completion of the undertaking so far as Bagdad by a few months. , _ The conclusion is that in all the circumstances a negative attitude, at any rate alter 1910, in regard to negotiation with Turkey and Germany concerning the Bagdad Uailw ay and cognate questions would have been justified upon one hypothesis, and one only26 The Bagdad Railway. that the balance of probability was so great as to amount to certaiiily that (..01111:111} was determined to carry out her great attack on her European neighbours even before she could complete the Bagdad ^Railway. There is evidence now that she was all the time planning this; but what is now almost certain was then pioblc'iiiatical, and the immediate problem was to render the Bagdad Railway, not indeed ' l(M ' menace to British interests—for this immunity could not have been secured at that late stage by negotiators however capable—but as innocuous as possible belore the enleipi ise had been brought single-handed to a practical completion, when the German attitude would undoubtedly have hardened, and less favourable terms could have been obtained. Negotiation with Turkey and complete abstention from negotiation with (iermany would manifestly have been an unpractical course, since matters were involved in which it was essential to British interests that the British (lovernment should secure, valcant quanium, certain assurances of acquiescence and of renunciation directly irom the German Government and not through third parties. No doubt a powerful incentive to negotiate with Germany was. the ardent desire of the British Government either to reach a settlement of all outstanding dillicultios, provided it in no way conflicted with our policy of continued friendship to France and Russia, or, failing a complete settlement, to remove particular causes of trouble and, to that extent, to diminish the danger of a rupture. But this motive, however cogent, appears to us to have been merely contributory, and not the really operative and governing consideration, which, undoubtedly was the conviction that a settlement of the Bagdad Railway and cognate questions could no longer be delayed without irreparable prejudice to our position in the Persian Gulf and to our long-standing commercial interests in S.W. Persia and Mesopotamia. Our object was thus apparently a twofold one, to treat Germany fairly, but above all to safeguard British interests so far as circumstances still permitted. While it seems certain that to neglect or abstain longer from negotiations such as took place from 1911 to 1914 would have been to imperil still further the British position at a threatened and vulnerable point ; that the only alternative course— though surely one open to grave if not insuperable objections—to secure that position was to maintain that the construction of the Bagdad Railway would be a hostile act; and that, in the main, and having regard to the element of actual possession which the Germans were engaged upon turning rapidly to account, the negotiations were conducted with some technical skill,* not without continual reference to the expert knowledge of our officers in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf, and with a measure of apparent success in the British interest,—still we must be held to reserve ail expression of opinion upon the omission, while negotiations which we admit to hci\e been necessary were in progress, to provide adequately by land as well as by sea against the cataclysm which eventually supervened in Europe.

The question has since been mooted as to how far the German negotiators in London were in the counsels of their (govern ment and acted with 'permissible dishonesty,' according to the accepted German code. No final answer can be offered ; but no evidence has been produced that either Prince Lichnowsky or Herr von Kiihlmann, his Counsellor of Embassy who, it is understood, took the leading part in the details of negotiation, sympathised either with the Bernhardi or with the Biilow school, even on motives of expediency. We have been furnished by a trustworthy informant with the account ot a conversation with a very prominent German, which took place in this country in tie sm-in- of 1914, and was recorded at the time. The subject of discussion had drifted to the apparent improvement in Anglo-German relations in recent years ; to the disquieting press polemics between Berlin and St. Petersburg ; and to the tragic possibibty of all the elaborate negotiations—the Potsdam agreement the suggested Anglo-beiman settlement, and the impending adjustments between France \ nd 'V e « f ar ^ to the Turkish railway question— ending in smoke through the outbieak of a European war.
