Enclosed with Kemball's letter is a translation of a letter (ff 316-17) from Hiskael, dated 28 November 1852. Hiskael reports that he has been instructed by Major Atkins Hamerton, Her Majesty's Consul and the Honourable Company's Agent in the dominions of His Highness the Imam of Muscat, to always consult with the Imam's representatives through a third party when making enquiries. Having done so, he states that he has made no progress in his efforts to locate the lost indigo in Ukkar, which is in the Imam's dominions. In his own letter, Kemball expresses his frustration at the lack of progress made, which he sees as being a result of the restrictions placed upon Haskael by Hamerton, and openly expresses his doubts as to whether Haskael is capable of fulfulling the role to which he has been appointed.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051547.0x000078#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
