Cambon. (Secret.) Your Excellency, Foreign Office, May 15, 1916, I SHALL have the honour to reply fully in a further note to your Excellency's note of the 9th instant, relative to the creation of an Arab State, but I should meanwhile be grateful if your Excellency could assure me that in those regions which, under the conditions recorded in that communication, become entirely French, or in which French interests are recognised as predominant, any existing British concessions, rights of navigation or development, and the rights and privileges of any British religious, scholastic, or medical institutions will be maintained. His Majesty's Government are, of course, ready to give a reciprocal assurance in regard to the British area. I have, &amp;c. E. GREY. [462—6] .I 2, 2 [87247] Sir Edward Grey to M. Oambon (Secret.) Your Excellency, Foreign Office, May 16, 1916. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency's note of the 9th instant, Stating that the French Government accept the limits of a future Arab State, Or Confederation of States, and of those parts of Syria where French interests predominate, together with certain conditions attached thereto, such as they result from recent discussions in London and Petrograd on the subject. I have the honour to inform your Excellency in reply that the acceptance of the whole project, as it now stands, will involve the abdication of considerable British interests, but, since His Majesty's Government recognise the advantage to the general caiise of the Allies entailed in producing a more favourable internal political situation in Turkev, they are ready l o accept the arrangement now arrived at, provided that the co-operation of the Arabs is secured, Und that the Arabs fulfil the conditions and obtain the towns of Homs, Hama, Damascus, and Aleppo. It is accordingly understood between the French and British Governments 1. That France and Great Britain are prepared to recognise and uphold an independent Arab State Or a' Confederation of Arab States m the areas (a) and (h) marked on the annexed map, under the suzerainty of an Arab chiei That in area (a) France, and in area (h) Great Britain, shall have priority of right oi enterprise and local loans.

The negotiations with the Arabs as to the boundaries of the Arab State or Confederation of Arab States shall be continued through the same channel as heretofore on behalf of the two Powers. • a u 12. It is agreed that measures to control the importation of arms into the A.raD territories will be considered by the two Governments. I have further the honour to state that, in order to make the agreement complete. His Majesty's Government are proposing to the Russian Government to exchange notes analogous to those exchanged by the latter and your Excellency's Government on 26th April last. Copies of these notes will be communicated to your Excellency as soon as exchanged. I would also venture to remind your Excellency that the conclusion of the present agreement raises, for practical consideration, the question of the claims of Italy to a share in any partition or rearrangement of Turkey in Asia, as formulated in article 9 of the agreement of 26th April, 1915, between Italy and the Allies. His Majesty's Government further consider that the Japanese Government should be informed of the arrangements now concluded. I have, &amp;c. E. GREY.[93696] (Secret) ^ Edward Gre y to Count You r Exeelleney, ■u i t, received from the French. Ambassador in London copie?! of the notes exchanged between the Russian and French Governments on the 26th ultimo, bv which your Excellency s Government recognise, subject to certain conditions, the arrangement made between Great Britain and France, relative to the constitution of an Arab State ^ Arab States, and to the partition of the territories of Syria, Cilicia, and Mesopotamia, provided that the co-operation of the Arabs is secured. His Majesty s Government take act with satisfaction that your Excellency's Government concur in the limits set forth in that arrangement, and I have now the honour to inform your Excellency that His Majesty's Government, on their part, in order to make the arrangement complete, are also prepared to recognise the conditions formulated by the Russian Government and accepted by the French Government in the notes exchanged at Petrograd on the 20th ultimo. In so far, then, as these arrangements directly affect the relations of Russia and Great Britain, I have the honour to invite the acquiescence of your Excellency's Government in an agreement on the following terms :— 1. That Russia shall annex the regions of Erzeroum, Trebizond, Van, and Bitlis, up to a point subsequently to be determined on the littoral of the Black Sea to the west of Trebizond. 2. That the region of Kurdistan to the south of Van and of Bitlis between Mush, Sert. the course of the Tigris, Jezireh-ben-Omar, the crest-line of the mountains which dominate Amadia, and the region of Merga Var, shall be ceded to Russia ; and that starting from the region of Merga Var, the frontier of the Arab State shall follow the crest-line of the mountains which at present divide the Ottoman and Persian Dominions. These boundaries are indicated in a general manner and are subject to modifications of detail to be proposed later by the Delimitation Commission which shall meet on the spot. 3. That the Russian Government undertake that, in all parts of the Ottoman territories thus ceded to Russia, any concessions accorded to British subjects by the Ottoman Government shall be maintained. If the Russian Government express the desire that such concessions should later be modified in order to bring them into harmony with the laws of the Russian Empire, this modification shall only take place in agreement with the British Government. 4. That in all parts of the Ottoman territories thus ceded to Russia, existing British rights of navigation and development, and the rights and privileges of any British religious, scholastic, or medical institutions shall be maintained. His Majesty s Government, on their part, undertake that similar Russian rights and privileges shall be maintained in those regions which, under the conditions of this agreement, become entirely British, or in which British interests are recognised as predominant. 5. The two Governments admit in principle that every State which annexes any part of the Ottoman Empire is called upon to participate in the service of the Ottoman Debt. . I have, &amp;c. E. GREY.

In reply, I have the honour to state that I see no objection to the adoption of the word suggested by your Excellency, and I have accordingly caused the necessary alteration to be made in the original text of your note of the 9th May.
