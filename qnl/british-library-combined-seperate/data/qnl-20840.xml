The letter has two enclosures. The first is letter no.43 of 1855 (folios 32-36) from Anderson to George Edmonstone, Secretary to the Government of India, dated 5 March 1855, and contains instructions from the Governor in Council at Fort William. The guidelines make a clear distinction between the crew member of a vessel who takes leave on shore at a place in which he was previously enslaved, and is considered to be under the protection of the British flag, and the deserter who has effectively forgone his right to British protection. The enclosure also provides details of an example of the proportion of Indian naval crews who were formerly African slaves. The second enclosure is letter no.3968 (folios 36-37) from J Dalrymple, Officiating Secretary to the Government of India, to Anderson, dated 9 November 1855. Dalrymple states that the Honourable President in Councilâ€™s opinion on the matter corresponds to that of the Governor in Council.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024052050.0x000015#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
