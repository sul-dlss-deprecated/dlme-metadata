Sir, In reference to the visits of His Britannic Majesty's warships to Bahrain from time to time, I have the honour to inform you that it has always been a matter of local pleasure for games to be played between the Royal Navy and the local teams. The practice has generally been for an invitation to be sent to the warships through this office. It has occurred to me that quite possibly the teams aboard His Britannic Majesty's warships may wish to choose the kind of game which they would prefer to play on their visits here; and for this reason I would venture to suggest that on the day before a warship's arrival a message /. may —VI -2- may be sent to the Sports Officer care of the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, asking for a mtch to play football and/or cricket and/or hockey, when suitable arrangements will be made here. The local teams look forward with pleasure to meeting the teams of the Royal Navy; and this suggestion is put forward with a view to encouraging this good feeling of sportsmanship• Should however it be desired to play against a certain local team, of course that choice should lie with the Navy; otherwise the local football teams, viz., the Alkhalifah team of Maharaq, the National team of Manamah, the Union team of Manamah, the Arabian team of Manamah the Bahrain Sports Club of Manamah, would be put forward in rotation# If this suggestion is acceptable, perhaps it may kindly be intimated to the various Sports Officers upon His Britannic Majesty^ warships now in the Persian Gulf.

I saw a large collection of such letters in the post office myself this morning. This being the case, I think the best plan will be as follows: When you next come in here if you receive a batch of air mail letters for the Ship^ Company containing several surchargesi will you send some one down to me at once with the surcharged letters Intact and then he and I can examine each one in the presence of the postmaster in the post office and discover how many of them are definitely unjustifiable and in how many cases surcharges have been made under instructions from the post office of issue, I can then take up the matter with the Director of Post Offices, Karachi, who I understand is likely to be visiting Bahrain in the near future.
