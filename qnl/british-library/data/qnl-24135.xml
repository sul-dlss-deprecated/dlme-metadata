'pHIS is a facsimile, beautifully produced by Messrs. Percy Lund, Humphries’ Replika Process, of the original edition of Hughes’ Dictionary, which in any form has been long out of print and not only expensive but very difficult to secure. The Publishers anticipate therefore a welcome accept ance of this reprint, which has all the clarity of Roman and Arabic text, and illustrations found in the original edition. There is no volume so comprehensive or authorita tive dealing with the Religion and Customs of the Moham medan Peoples. Of this issue 1,000 copies only are being machined, and it is anticipated that it will rapidly §0 out of print. “ The long familiarity with the tenets and customs of Moslems has placed Mr. Hughes in the best position for deciding what is necessary and what is superfluous in a ‘ Dictionary of Islam.’ He has avoided all controversy; and his accounts of its doctrines, law, and social conditions is remarkably fair and dispassionate, as a rule, indeed, he has entirely suppressed his opinions, and prefers to give the views of the leading authorities on the various subjects treated in his Dictionary. His usual method is to begin anI WIVES WIVES 671 WIVES. Arabic zauj (e^j), pi. azwdj, also zaujah. pi. zaujdt. Although Muhammad himself claimed the special in dulgence of eleven lawful wives, he limited his followers to four, allowing at the same time as many female concubines or domestic slaves as the master’s right hand possessed. See Qur’an, Surah iv. 3 : “ Marry what seems good to you of women, by twos, or threes, or fours, or what your right hand possesses.” [marriage.] According to the Shi‘ahs, he also sanc tioned temporary marriages, an account of which will be found in the article on Min* ah. Regarding the treatment of wives, the fol lowing verse in the Qur’an (Surah iv. 38) allows the husband absolute power to cor rect them: “ Chide those whose refractori ness you have cause to fear. Remove them into sleeping chambers apart, and beat them. But if they are obedient to you, then seek not occasion against them.’* (For other injunctions in the Qur’an on the subject, see the article women.) The following is Muhammad’s teaching, as given in the Traditions (see Mishkdt, Arabic edition; Baku ’n-Ni/cdti) :— “ That is the most perfect Muslim whose disposition is the best, and the best of you is he who behaves best to his wives.” “ When a man has two wives and does not treat them equally, ho will come on the Day of Resurrection with half his body fallen off.” 2&gt; ' “ When a man calls his wife, she must come, although she be at an oven.” “ The Prophet used to divide his time equally amongst his wives, and he would say, ‘ 0 God, 1 divide impartially that which thou hast put in my power.’” “ Admonish your wives with kindness, be cause women were created from a crooked bone of the side; therefore, if you wish to straighten it, you will break it, and if you let it alone, it will always be crooked.” “ Not one of you must whip his wife like whipping a slave.” “ A Muslim must not hate his wife, for if he be displeased with one bad quality in her, then let him be pleased with another that is good.” “ A Muslim cannot obtain anything better than an amiable and beautiful wife, such a wife who, when ordered by her hus band to do a thing, will obey, and if her hus band looks at her will be happy; and if her husband swears by her, she will make him a swearer of truth; and if he be absent from her, she will honour him with her own person and property.” It is related that on one occasion the Pro phet said: “ Beat not your wives.” Then ‘Umar came to the Prophet and said, “ Our wives have got the upper hand of their hus bands from hearing this.” Then the Prophet permitted beating of wives. Then an im mense number of women collected round the Prophet’s family, and complained of their husbands beating them. And the Prophet said, “ Verily a great number of women are assembled in my home complaining of their husbands, and those men who beat their wives do not behave well. He is not of my way who teaches a woman to go astray and who entices a slave from his master.” The legal position of a wife under Sunni, and, with some slight differences, under Shi‘ah law also, may be generally stated as fol lows :— Her consent to a marriage is necessary. She cannot legally object to be one of four wives. Nor can she object to an unlimited number of hand-maids. She is entitled to a marriage settlement or dower, which must be paid to her in case of divorce or separation. She may, however, remit either whole or part of the dower. She may refuse to join her husband until the dower is paid. She may be at any time, with or without cause, divorced by her husband. She may seek or claim divorce {/chub) from her husband with her husband’s consent. She may be chastised by her husband. She cannot give evidence in a court of law against her husband. Ac cording to the Sunnis, her evidence in favour of her husband is not admissible, but the Shi'ahs maintain the opposite view. Her husband can demand her seclusion from pubhc. If she becomes a widow, she must observe hi dad, or mourning, for the space of four months and ten days. In the event of her husband’s death, she is entitled to a portion of her husband’s estate, in addition to her claim of dower, the claim of dower taking precedence of all other claims on the estate. There are special arrangements made by Muslim law for the partition of the husband’s time amongst his wives in ease he may have two or more wives. For it is related that Muhammad said, “ The man who has two or more wives, and who, in partition of his time, inclines particularly to one of them, shall in the Day of Judgment incline to one side by being paralytic.” And ‘Ayishah relates that the Prophet said, “ 0 God, I make an equal partition amongst my wiver as to what is in my power; do not, therefore, bring me to account for that which is not in my power, namely, the affections.” It is therefore ruled that the wife of a prior marriage and of a recent one, are all alike in the matter of the partition of time spent with them. The hus band can, however, arrange and determine the measure of the partition of his time as to whether it be one day or more at a time. But if a man marry two wives, the one a free woman and the other a bond-maid, he must divide his time into three portions, giving two portions to the free woman and one to the bond-maid. When the husband is on a journey, bis wives can make .no claim to ac company him on the journey, and it is entirely at his option to carry along with him whom soever he pleases, but it is preferable for him to cast lots and take with him on the journey her upon whom the lot may happen to fall. The time of the journey is not to be counted against a husband, and he is therefore not obliged to make up for the partition lost within that time. It is also allowed by the I V I V i . y r» If672 WIVES WIVES law, of one wife to give up her right as re gards partition of time to any other of her husband’s wives. But if a woman give up her right, she is not at liberty to resume it. Durru 'l-Mukhtdr, in loco.) The position of a wife as regards the law of divorce, is treated under the article DIVORCE. We are indebted to Moulvi Syed Ameer Ali, M.A., LL.B., a Muhammadan Barrister- at-Law, and Presidency Magistrate of Cal cutta, for the following able exposition of the position of wives under the Muslim law :— “ Prior to the Islamic legislation, and especially among the pagan Arabs, women had no locus standi in the eye of the law. The pre-Islamic Arab customs as well as the Rabbinical law, dealt most harshly with them. (3 Caussin de Perceval, Hist. des. Arabes, p. 337.) “ The Koran created a thorough revolu tion in the condition of women. For the first time in the history of Oriental legislation, the principle of equality between the sexes was recognised and practically carried into effect. ‘ The women,’ says the Koran, ‘ ought to be have towards their husbands in like manner as their husbands should behave towards them, according to what is just.’ (Koran, chap, ii., v. 228.) And Mohammed in his dis course on Jabl-i-Arafat, emphasised the pre cept by declaring in eloquent terms, ‘ Ye men, ye have rights over your wives, and your wives have rights over you.’ (Ibn Hisham.) In accordance with these precepts the Ma- hommedan law declares equality between the married parties to be the regulating principle of all domestic relationship. Fidelity to the marriage bed is inculcated on both sides; and unfaithfulness leads to the same conse quences, whether the delinquent be the hus band or the wife. Chastity is required equally from man and woman. “ The Jiusband is legally bound to maintain his wife and her domestic servants, whether she and her servants belong to the Moslem faith or not. This obligation of the husband comes into operation when the contract itself comes into operation, and the wife is subjected thereby to the marital control. It continues in force during the conjugal union, and in certain cases even after it is dissolved. “ The maintenance (nafkah) of a wife in cludes everything connected with her support and comfort, such as food, raiment, lodging, Ac., and must be provided in accordance with the social position occupied. (1 Fatdwa-i- Alamgiri, p. 737 ; 1 Fatdwa-i-Kdzi Khan ; Jdma-ush-Shqttdt ; Fusul-Imddiyah ; Mafdtih ; 1 Bed., Eng. Trans., p. 392.) “ The wife is not entitled merely to main tenance in the English sense of the word, but has a right to claim a habitation for her own exclusive use, to be provided consistently with the husband’s means. “ If the wife, however, is a minor, so that the marriage cannot be consummated, accord ing to the Hanafi and the Shiah doctrines, there is no legal obligation on the husband’s part to maintain her. (1 Fatdwa-i-A/amyiri, | p. 773; Kmiz-ud-Dakdik; 1 Bed., Eng. | Trans., p. 894; Jdma-ush-Shattdt.) “ With the Shafeis it makes no difference, in the obligation of the husband to maintain i his wife, whether the wife be a minor or not. | (Kitdb-ul-Anwar\ 1 Bed., Eng. Trans., p. 394.) “ Nor is a husband, under the Hanafi and I the Shiah law, entitled to the custody of the person of a minor wife whom he is not bound j to maintain. (In re Khatija Bibi, 5 Bengal ! Law Repoi ts, 0. C. J. 557.) “ If the husband be a minor and the wife i an adult, and the incapacity to complete or consummate the contract be solely on his | part, she is entitled to maintenance. (1 Hed., Eng.^ Trans., p. 395; Fusul-i-Imddiyah ; 1 A atawa-i-Kazi Khan, p. 480; ,Tdma-ush- Shattdt.) “It makes no difference in the husband’s liability to maintain the wife whether he be in health or suffering from illness, whether he be a prisoner of war or undergoing punish ment, ‘ justly or unjustly,’ for some crime, whether he be absent from home on pleasure or business, or gone on a pilgrimage. (1 Fatdwa-i-Alamgiri, p. 733.) In fact, as long as the status of marriage subsists, and as long as the wife is subject to the marital power, so long she is entitled to maintenance “from him. Nor does she lose her right by being afflicted with any disease. (1 Fatdwa- i-Alamgiri, p. 734; Jdma-ush-Shattdt.) “ When the husband has left the place of the conjugal domicil without making any ar rangement for his wife’s support, the Kazi is authorised by law to make an order that her maintenance shall be paid out of any fund or property which the husband may have left in deposit or in trust, or invested in any trade or business. (I Fatdwa-i-Ala^igiri, p. 750.) “ A wife may contract debts for her sup port during the husband’s absence, and if such debts are legitimate, contracted bond fide for her support, the creditors have a “ right of recovery ” against the husband. (Nail-ul-Alarum.) In the same way, if the husband be unable for the time being to maintain his wife, ‘ it would not form a cause for separation,’ says the Bedayah, ‘ but the magistrate may direct the woman to pledge her husband’s credit and procure necessaries for herself, the husband remaining liable for the debts.’ (I Bed., Eng. Trans., p. 297.) “ When the husband is absent and has left real property either in the possession of his wife or of some other person on her behalf, the wife is not entitled to sell it for her sup port, though she may raise a temporary loan on it, which the husband will be bound to dis charge, provided the mortgage was created bond fide for her or her children’s support, and did not go beyond the actual necessity-of the case. Under such circumstances the mortgagee is bound to satisfy himself that the money advanced is applied legitimately to the support of the family of the absent husband. (1 Faldwa-i-Alamgiri, p. 737 .) “ When the woman abandons the conjugal domicil without any valid reason, she is not--7^* article with the texts in the Koran relating to the subject, then to add the traditions bearing upon it, and to conclude with the comments of the Mohammedan scholiasts and the criticisms of Western scholars. Such a method, while involving an infinity of labour, produces the best results in point of accuracy and comprehensiveness. . . . The difficult task of compiling a Dictionary of so vast a subject as Islam, with its many sects, its saints, khalifs, ascetics, and dervishes, its festivals, rituals, and sacred places, the dress, manners, and customs of its professors, its commentators, technical terms, science, of tradition and interpretation, its super stitions, magic, and astrology, its theoretical doctrines, and actual practice has been accomplished with singular success, and the Dictionary will have its place among the standard works of reference in every library that professes to take account of the religion which governs the lives of millions. “ As a whole the Dictionary is both full and exact. The articles on ‘ Marriage/ ‘ Women/ ‘ Wives/ * Slavery/ ‘ Tradition/ ‘ Sufi/ ‘ Muhammad/ ‘ Da’ wah ’ or incanta tion, ‘ Burial ’ and ‘ God ’ are specially admirable, and ‘ Qur’an ’ is an elaborate treatise of fifty columns, containing an abstract of the contents of every chapter of the sacred book. Two articles deserve special notice. One is an elaborate account of Arabic ‘ writing/ by Dr. Steingass, which contains a vast quantity of useful matter, and is well illustrated by woodcuts of the chief varieties of Arabic script. The other is Mr. F. Pincott’s on ‘ Sikhism.’ ... There is something on nearly every page of the Dictionary that will interest and instruct the student of Eastern (and predominantly Indian) religion, manners, and customs.”— Athenaeum. t/'''N ORDER FORM LUZAC i CU., To Mr ^„ 46,aRSA ' r r ^33ELL STREET, • (OPPOSITE TH^ggHIXSH TiaSEDll) LONDON.W.C. 1 .

C. F. SCHOMBERG Demy %vo With Illustrations and a Map 4 15 s net this book is the first to give any really detailed account of the whole of that remote region, the Gilgit Agency, which lies in the extreme North-West of India between the valleys of the rivers Oxus and Indus. The author explored that region thoroughly, sometimes crossing from one valley to the next by unknown passes. He was received by the rulers of the small semi-indepen dent States whose history and folk-lore he describes. In that beautiful tract of lofty barren mountain and cliff, with fruitful valleys and cheerful villages, life has gone on unchanged for centuries. The people are still unspoilt and, although responsive to British influence, they have preserved most of their old habits and customs. The outside world is little known, and even less cared for. Few of the inhabitants have ever seen a wheeled vehicle or a metalled road, but they are quite conversant with aeroplanes, gramophones, and European medicines. This is essentially a land of contrast, where Nature is at her cruellest and life a long struggle to wring a living from the land. In some valleys the combat has been too severe, in others it has produced a race of men unequalled for endurance anywhere in the world.

Ill I grams: KNOWINGLY LONDON Jume 3, 1935 A 'tv f N Dear Sir, Since I last wrote to you the success of The March of M an has been so overwhelming that we are compelled to order at once a new printing. The first printing, the last sets of which are now being sold, was 5,000 copies; and this number we fully expected would be sufficient for the sale throughout the world during the remainder of the year. The extraordinary sale has entirely upset our calculations and made it necessary to undertake a new printing immediately. The result is that after the present stock of the first printing is gone we shall not be able to supply you with a copy of The March of Man until the next impression is ready. This amazing demand is not really surprising. For it is now clear that this unique work, presenting as it does the whole of World History at a glance, exactly meets the need of thousands who like to be informed but have not the time - nor perhaps the inclination - to spend hours in research or reading. No definite forecast cam be made of when the new impression will be ready - ^ since the linen-lined paper is specially manufactured for us and the maps alone take three months to print. I suggest therefore that if you want a copy of The March of Man you should let me know at once. Delivery of all copies ordered within the next two or three weeks can be made immediately, but it now seems certain that subscribers delaying their orders after that will have to wait some time. I am letting you know what the position is because I feel a special responsibility to give you, as one of our Britannica owners, every oppor tunity of securing this remarkable book. Yours faithfully. 1 M/4. Manager. rJUST PUBLISHED! T he latest enterprise undertaken by the publishers of the Encyclopaedia Britannica is The March of Man, a single-volume record of peoples and events from prehistoric times until the early days of 1935 . Nothing like this work has ever been done before; it is, to the best of the publishers’ belief, the only readily available and reasonably comprehensive conspectus of Universal History, which will give the ordinary man a bird’s-eye view of the whole story of mankind. As Mr. A. G. Gardiner, the well-known writer and editor, says: “To the student it must be priceless, and to the general reader like myself it is a lamp to the feet and a guide through the wilderness. Do not let it be said in future that there are no short cuts to knowledge.” ^HE MARCH OF MAN consists of three sections, each of which is essential to the proper understanding of man’s progress, a Chronological Time Chart, an Atlas of Ancient and Modern History, and a series of illustrations portraying persons, events, or places so far as possible in the manner in which they appeared to their contemporaries. The Time Chart, in seven folding sections, gives all the facts that are of outstanding importance in the history of every nation, race or period. These facts are so presented that anyone is able easily to trace both the lesser streams and the main currents of time from their sources, and to see for himself how, when, and—with the help of the Atlas —where the various Empires, Dominions, Principalities, and Powers have had their rise, their flowering-season, and their decay. Moreover the Chart is invaluable as an aide- memoire or finger post, alike to the advanced student and to the professor who guides his studies. Mr. J. L. Garvin, Editor of The Observer, says: “To one like myself who is not only an incurable historical student but an incessant worker from maps, the Historical Chart will be a daily aid.” The Atlas, in full colours, covers as completely as possible the dispersal of civilised man over the five Con tinents. It ranges from the period when he occupied— so far as is known—only a tiny portion of the globe to the post-war settlements and the distribution of nations at the close of 1934. The series of sixty-four photogravure plates, con taining over 120 illustrations, each with its descriptive note, covers the ground from almost prehistoric times to the present day. The knowledge of what people and places looked like, and the knowledge of how they themselves thought they looked, is of great service to the student of history, and of surpassing interest to the ordinary reader. Here is the opinion of Professor F. M. Stenton, Professor of Modern History at Reading University : “ Nothing of the kind has been carried through before. I wish it every success.” And Dr. Ernest Barker, Professor of Political Science at Cambridge University, writes : “ I congratulate you upon it—not least upon the Time Chart and the Illustrations.” rp he whole work has been designed, prepared and made in England, under the general editorship of Mr. A Lawrence H. Dawson, with the collaboration of Mr. George Philip, F.R.G.S., and Dr. Ramsay Muir in the preparation of the Atlas. Mr. Francis Meynell, of the Nonesuch Press, acted as designer and typographical adviser. ACCLAIMED BY THE CRITICS! “ No vital political, economic or social landmark seems to have been overlooked. The Charts are in deed fascinating, if only for the manner in which they reveal the changing focus of national and imperial development through the centuries ... Of not less value is the historical atlas ... an extraordinary and valuable achievement.” — THE MORNING POST “ A work which has obvious value for the teacher . . . this cultured, authoritative and sumptuous teachers’ aid . . . will make an equal appeal to the general public.” —THE TEACHERS WORLD “ A staggering amount of historical information is compacted in this handsome volume ... It is one of the difficulties in connection with the average man’s historical reading that he cannot, as a rule, co-relate the events with which his attention is occupied with what was happening elsewhere at the same time. Here, he has everything under his eye at once... Excellent historical maps.—T'/ZE' SCOTSMAN “ This fine work ...

E. Lawrence’s full narrative of his great campaign in Arabia, has never before been available for general publication. About one hundred copies were privately printed by Lawrence in 1926, for subscribers and personal friends only, at a nominal price of thirty guineas a copy. In a short time, copies of the book in the sale-rooms were fetching several hundreds of pounds each. In March, 1927, an abridged version of Seven Pillars of Wisdom was published for general circulation under the title of Revolt in the Desert, which remained on sale until withdrawn by the author six months later. It contained less than one half of the full text. Seven Pillars of Wisdom is now to appear in its entirety. The book contains approximately 280,000 words, and will occupy some 672 pages. There will be forty-eight full-page illustrations and a number of line drawings in the text, specially prepared for the original edition by famous artists. There will also be four maps. It should be made clear that Revolt in the Desert will not be re-issued in any form. Seven Pillars of Wisdom is the definitive work, and entirely supplants the abridged version withdrawn in 1927. The original publication of Seven Pillars of Wisdom was for an unusually limited public. But it was immediately recognised that a new classic of English literature had been brought into being; men of action and men of letters were agreed that Lawrence had matched his great adventure with his unique artistry. And the nine years that have elapsed since the book was printed have only confirmed that general judgment.• k * &gt; ' ■ /''TS . xo. M/m/p/M-#. . i •V'.y *• #« /Ui SUDAN GOVSPJIMSImT.

CARRUTHERS, at the age of twenty-six, had the audacity to ride through that same desert which later became the scene of T. E. Lawrence’s “most spectacular feat—his great ride through enemy country to raise the tribesmen.’’ They are the only Europeans to have seen the Fajr region and the desolation called HUL. In his ride to the great Nafud the author broke his journey at the ancient and fanatic oasis of Taima, a town not seen before or since by any other Englishman but Doughty, and famous for its great well-pit and its archaeo logical treasure, the TAIMA STONE. After escaping from Taima and starving with the Shararat Badawin, poorest of God’s creatures, he finally reached the mighty Nafud— 30,000 square miles of wind-blown sand. Racing home with empty water skins, after having secured his specimens of the Arabian “ unicorn,” Mr. Carruthers had his last and luckiest escape when he was attacked by a raiding party of overwhelming numbers. The book closes with a chapter on the Arabian Oryx and its distribution. Mr. Carruthers has spent years wandering about the remote parts of the world after rare birds and strange beasts. For twenty-five years he has been silent about this—his greatest adventure. He has kept his best wine till last. 33 plates. Demy 8ro. 8 6 net.

(SIGNED) (ADDRESS) May we make this a standing order each year ? Date 193 Published by J. WHITAKER &amp; SONS LTD., 12 Warwick Lane, E.C.4-'I a THE HISTORY OF “WHITAKER Early Training The Idea Joseph Whitaker, bom on May 4 th, 1820 , and died on May 15 th, 1895 , was associated with books from early youth. At the age of 21 he was sent by Parkers, the Oxford publishers, to open and manage a London House at 377 Strand. In 1850 he produced “ The Artist,” a fine art review and the fore-runner of the present generation of specialized periodicals. From 1856 to 1859 he was editor of “ The Gentleman’s Magazine.” These details may seem unimportant, but the post as editor of a periodical with a wide circulation necessitated almost universal knowledge, or means of access to an unlimited store of knowledge^ “ Sylvanus Urban ” being the Court of Appeal in those days for intellectual disputes. Three or four years in that position- enlarged his outlook, but during that period he was also faced with the needs of a growing family, to meet whose needs he hit upon the happy idea of establishing a newspaper devoted entirely to the interests of the book trade. “ The Bookseller ” was immediately successful and enabled him to face the future with confidence. Ten years later, however, the needs of his growing family * again outstripped his means and once more he puzzled his brain to meet them. It was due to the period as editor of “ The Gentleman’s Magazine ” that the idea was born, for while fitting himself for that post he had compiled a “ common place book,” made up partly of cuttings from Government Blue Books and other miscellaneous printed matter, and partly of written notes, memoranda and tables. To make the miscellaneous contents of this note book available for easy reference he had provided it with an index, and during the decade between resignation of the position of Sylvanus Urban and his attempt to solve his problem he had made many additions to the note book and numerous entries in its already elaborate index. The idea coursing through his brain was simple. “ That note book is extremely useful to me Why should I not publish it in the hope of its being useful to others ? ” Thus “ Whitaker ” saw Published in December, 1868 , for the year 1869 , being in effect the “common-place book” brought up to date, with the additions of specially compiled astronomical tables to justify the title of almanack—and was so successful that it nearly bankrupted him. The scope of the information in “ Whitaker ” is constantly increased each year, and it has become the most complete reference book for everyday use. The first issue, for 1869 , published on December 10 th, 1868 , contained 362 pages with an index of 2,000 references ; now, the 1936 Edition will contain over 1,000 pages and an index of over 20,000 references !

IN THESE DAYS OF UNIVERSAL INTEREST IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD, IT IS OF MORE VALUE THAN EVER You probably possess a copy either in your room at the office or in your home, but HOW OLD IS IT?

MACDONALD MISS FREYA STARK (author of Southern Gates of Arabia, etc.) writes : c Thank you for sending me so human and delightful a study of Iraq life as Euphrates Exile. c It is not only the work of a very able and acute observer, intimately acquainted with his subject, but it has an unusual vividness and charm of style, and is delightful in its under standing of all the various types of that very varied land. I shall certainly recommend all my friends to read it.’ AIR COMMODORE L. E. o. CHARLTON (sometime Chief Staff Officer, Iraq Command): ‘ Most remarkable ... It is absolutely redolent of the Iraqan atmosphere, and is full of wisdom ... so different from the commonplace, and so sincere that the heart is touched.’ THE COUP D ETAT IN IRAQ The recent coup d’etat has given Capt. Macdonald’s book considerable topical interest. His work brought him in close contact with politics in Iraq and he has some pertinent remarks to make about them.★ SPECIMEN PAGE ★ 246 EUPHRATES EXILE the simplicity of the boatman and his son, nor the 1 assured worldly position which is mine, and which so simplifies sympathy. Jamil represented in our little group the eternally ill-fitting middleman. Normally he is good-natured, shrewd, conceited and fairly prosperous, which prosperity has come his way as a result of petty speculation, money- lending, and the cautious exploitation of the less sophisticated. He has heard tales of Europe and knows Baghdad, and as a concession to Western ideas wears yellow shoes, cotton socks, and, clip^ i over his pantaloons, MacGregor tartan sock- suspenders. To-day he has been elegantly and charmingly dressed in a long-skirted fawn-coloured gown, and over his head he has worn a spotless white chafiyah. It has taken three days of con stant companionship to subdue, in his communi cations with Hussein and Humaiyid, a contemptuous curl of the mouth, a hectoring note in the voice, and a tacitly conveyed assumption that myself was leagued with him against the ignorant and property less. But to-day, when he spoke, his voice was soft, and I could almost feel the breath of his contempla tion at my back. With minds raised slightly above mere stoicism, our little party looked out on the world and a certain consciousness of each other sharpened our senses. Perhaps the four of us were ever so faintly seeing colours round us where weI I EUPHRATES EXILE the boatman and his son, nor the 1 &gt;osition which is mine, and which ipathy.

His job meant living in an ordinary house in a noisy street in a small Euphrates town; it meant touring among the Bedouin in the Desert, and among the settled Arab tribes in their riverside homes. It was a job which demanded endless patience, no little tact, and a digestion strong enough to cope with tribal food and dubious water. The author emerged with his patience, his digestion and his sense of humour unimpaired to set down these charming sketches of people and country. Their sympathy and insight make them first-rate reading. ^ With 8 beautiful illustrations. 7/6 net. ORDER FORM ★ To Messrs. GOULDEN &amp; CURRY, Date BOOKSELLER The Royal Library, Tunbridge Wells.

Bar at-law, Law Member of India—“I can hardly suggest any improvement as the publications (Basu’s Injunctions &amp; Basu’s Evidence Act) are so very satisfactory.” Hon’ble Sir. Justice Lort Williams K. C. of the Calcutta High Court.— “...they (Basu’s Injunctions &amp; Basu’s Evidence Act) are now so well-known that they speak for themselves”. Amrita Bazar Patrika, dated the 24th. June 1934 :—“The author has attempted, and we think wiih considerable success, to expound the principles which should guide parties to pray for and the Couris to grant injunctions. He has dealt with the subject masterly and elaborately and from a scholarly point of view. He has digested a mass of English and American authors and cases and has made elaborate quotations from judgments, both Indian and foreign, in support of the principles laid out by him.

Hon’ble Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru P. C.—“I found it extremely useful in the course of my legal work.” Hon’ble Sir Justice Lortwilliams K. C. of the Calcutta High Court. — 'As in the past will doubtless be of the greatest possible use to the legal world.” Law weekly, dated the 13th April 1934 'The learned author has traced the origin and development of every rule of law relating to the giving and reception of evidence with a view to enable the reader to get a clear and firm grasp of the principles underlying it The learned author criticises and brings into prominence several defects in regard to which he offers his own valuable suggestions. The book is repleate with a mine of useful information culled and collected from many valuable sources which are not easily available to the Bench and the Bar and Students of law The commentaries throughout are full and exhaustive ; the enunciation of the legal principles are clear and concise ; and whole treatment of the entire subject is quite luminous and leaves nothing to be desired.' Madras Weekly Notes, dated 23rd April 1934 “The present book has been thoroughly revised and many portions of it are re-written The author has tried to instil into and bring home to the reader’s mind the main principles, so that he may not get confused in the Reports. All the decisions in the official and non-official reports have been requisitioned to illustrate the principles. The decisions of the Courts wherever they appear contrary to the recognised principles have been freely criticised.” Annotated Law Reporter, dated 24th April 1934 'The commentary is lucid, exhustive and well arranged The book can easily serve as a reliable guide on all points it deals. The printing and get up is quite nice and the book inspite of all these features is most moderately priced.” All India Law Reporter of May 1934 “The legal public has already shown its appreciation of this work published four years ago. The author has substantially enlarged the matter contained previously and has thus added to its utility Copious references to both English and American Law and the foreign cases based on it has rendered this book invaluable especially to mofassil Pleade'rs to whom a library containing books on foreign law is not always available The binding and paper is good and durable.” 550 pa|0S Rojui X» Rd, M*' Patna Law Times, dated the 24th April 1934 “The treatment of the subject-matter is scientific and lucid A mere cursory glance through the bookEASTERN LAW HOUSE, r5 College Square, Calcutta. will convince the readers its utility. The get-up and binding leave nothing more to be desired. We have no hesitation in recommending the book as a valuable work on the subject.” Madras Law Journal, dated the 3rd May 1934 -.—“Even when referring to the decisions he does not rest content with stating the points decided by them, but he states the principles on which the decisions are based without which they would be merely empirical. Such a treatment of the enactment and decisions based upon it is bound to be of special value The index to the work is full and will be appreciated.” Allahabad Weekly Notes, dated the 30th April 1934 “The addition of more than one hundred pages of new matters, never incorporated in any other edition......have greatly enhanced the utility of the publication. The printing and the get-up are superb.’’ Calcutta Law Journal, dated the 16th Janury 1931.— ''The greatest merit of the book is its exhaustiveness, and its comprehensive character, lo whichever part we have turned, we have found it packed with legal informations...... Comfortable to find.” The inclusion of all latest Rules of the different High Courts and Chief Courts is a special feature of the book. Each and every section and Rules of the Code is fully annotated. Not a case-digest, but a fairly handy and up-to-date commentary. In this work more than 20,000 case-laws cited.
