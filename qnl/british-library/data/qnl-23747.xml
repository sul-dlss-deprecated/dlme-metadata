In order to ensure that acknowledgments of such messages may be made in such a way as not to appear merely the automatic expression of a local official, and that they may be so worded as to protect the i^ing-Emperor and other Personages from any suggestion of discourtesy, it has now been decided, with Hi s Majesty s approval, to adopt the .following revised procedure, which provides for different forms of acknowledgment/to the status of the senders* 3* Messages from Princes and Chiefs will, as heretofore, be forwarded by Political Officers to the Government of India, who will transmit them to Hi s Majesty’s Secretary of State. A Chief having a salute of less than 11 guns(i.e.a Chief not entitled to be styled 'Highness ,, )will then receive from the Government of India an intimation, through the Political authority concerned, that his message has been communicated to the proper quarter* l*o further acknowledgment will be sent to him* a Chief having a salute of 11 guns and otrer will receive&lt;a&gt; 2 4 * receive from the ibaauaDmdbadbabiittx same intimation; but 9 on receipt by the Government of India of the Secretary of State 1 a reply that the message has been laid before the Personage concerned, a further ac.jiowledgment, as from the Personage, will be made to the sender* 4# Ag a general rule, messages will be forwarded to the Secretary of State by despatch, but Political Officers should make their own recommendations in the case of any particular message ^hich they consider should be transmitted and acknowledgment by telegranh* 1 have the honour to be, sjr, Y our most obedient servant, D.M.Field, for deputy Secretary to the Govt, of I n dia* k r* 4 Lf © .Copy of letter ^o*2357»Gr #f dated the 12th September 1919 f from the Under Secretary to the Government Jndla In the Foreign and Political Department, to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf# J V the letter I am directed to iflvitea reference r from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political y' A—«—l/ department Ho # 1906-G, # dated the 10th September 1917, on the subject of the procedure for the acknowledgment of t messages of congratulation and condolence addressed by Ruling Princes and Chiefs to Royal Personages in England and forwarded through the Government of India. 2. Ae a doubt has arisen regarding the treatment of messages from Chiefs, Jagirdars, Thakurs, etc#, who hove no salutes at all, I am to sr^y thot the Government of ^ndia propose to treat messages from such senders in the same manner as if the message had emanated from a Chief having a salute of less than 11 guns# fhe Government of India, however, would be glad, in any doubtful case, to receive the opinion of the forwarding authority whther the message should be transmitted to Hie Majesty’s Secretary of State or whther, owing to the insignificance of the sender, it would suffice merely to acknowledge the message without forwading it to the India Office# It would be convenient if similar information were furnished when messages are transmitted from persons of status and social position residing in Indian States. v ' MAS. v '&gt; • |J&gt; No. -// - 0 f 1026.

Personal messages to His Majesty the King-Emperor * y V I am directed to refer to the ocrrebpcnaence euaing with the letter from the Government of/India in the Foreign and Political Department, Nc#J\371-G/29, dated the 24th December 1929, regarding the procedure for dealing with messages of a purely personal and private nature addressed to His Majesty the King Emperor. 2. I am to state that it has been pointed cut to the Government cf India that the interval which at present elapses between the receipt in India cf a loyal message for submission to His i!ajesty and its acknowledgment is somewhat excessive particularly in view cf the fact that such messages, when received direct at Buckingham Palace, are acknowledged on the same day. 7ith a view, therefore, to reduce delay, His Maj esty's Government have asked that the IcIj. owing procedure should be adopted iVhen messages (by telegraph or otherwise) are received from Ruling Princes having salutes of 11 guns $nd over, the names only of these princes should be telegraphed immediately on receipt cf their me. sages direct tc the India Office by the local authorities concerned (viz, the local Government, Agent tc the Governor General, or Vsident). In the case cf its Majesty's Birthday, as many names as possible should o n t ie raphed on the evening of the anniversary. The names of the senders would then be communicated by the India Office to Buckingham Palace for the necessary action in accordance wita paragraph 1(c)(1) of the Memorandum cf which a copy was forwarded with the letter referred tc in paragraph 1 above. The full text cf t ie messages should oe forwarded tc the Government of India for transmission tc England and thesame and the local authorities concerned should at the/time inform the senders that their messages are being transmitted to iris Maj esty. The procedure laid down in the preceding para raph will supersede, to the extent indicated therein, the rules at present in force for the transmission and acknowledgement of such messages ana I am to request that the revised pro cedure may kindly he adopted forthwith. I am to add that the messages referred to above would be dealt with even more expeditiously if the practice of seme Huling Princes who telegraph direct to Buckingham Palace were fcllowed also by others of 11 guns or over who at present send their messages through the local authorities. The latter procedure may, however, com;.end itself to some cf t le Princes and it is net suggested that pressure should he brought tc hear cn those who adhere tc it to telegraph direct to His Majesty. I am, however, tc request that xxxxxxxxxa (with the permission of the Governor-in-Ocuncil) it may he intimated tc the hiiing Prlnoes ocnoerned cn a convenient opportunity and in a suitable manner that there is nothing to prevent them from addressing messages cf this nature direct tc His Majesty. regards the disposal cf messages emanating from non-salute chiefs and those whose salutes are less than 11 guns, I am tc state that no modifications are necessary in the existing procedure.ric.
