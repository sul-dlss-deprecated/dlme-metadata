(76281) 20218/19 ♦ TREASURY CiilJv'iBEtiS, ISth May, 1919* My Lord;, I have laid before the Lords Coninissioners of HiB Majesty’s Treasury Sir W. Tyrrell’s letter of the 5tn instant (65980/M.E./44) enclosing copy of telegrams No. 669 and 670 of the 29th April from General Allenby on the subject of the Hedjaz subsidy. My Lords observe that the total estimate of King Hussein’s actual monthly expenditure is £99,900 and the estimated revenue £15,000 leaving a net deficit.of £84,900; but that these estimates include no provision for unforeseen and capital expenditure or for the King's civil list. Consequently the subsidy of £100,000 a month includes a £15,000 margin for these items. In view of the political situation Ivy Lords feel constrained to accept the view of Earl Curzon of Kedleston that the subsidy should remain at £100,000 a month for the three months ending July next, but They consider that this arrangement should provide the King with sufficient funds to meet all re sonable expenses on account of the forth coming pilgrimage and that he should be informed that His Majesty's Government expect uirn to make suitable military and sanitary arrangements for the benefit of the pilgrims out of these credits. In this connection I am to refer to your telegram 418 of 4th April, and to General Allenby’s reply 694 of 2nd instant. Their Lordships cannot however regard the position Ihe Under-Secretary of State, FOREIGN OFFICE. as/„as other than unsatisfactory from a financial point of view, They cannot contemplate the continuance indefinitely of the subsidy at the present high rate, and They are glad to observe •vthat Lord Cur 2 on is inviting the views of Sir Henry McMahon and Commander Hogarth, as suggested in the last paragraph of General Allenby’s telegram No. 669, and proposes that the whole question of subsidies to Arabian rulers should be dis cussed by the Inter-Departmental Conference on Middle Eastern Affairs at an early date. They will doubtless be invited to appoint a representative to attend the meeting. I am, etc., (Sgd.) T.L.

HedjaZr It is essential to act vigorously while effect of Palestine possible destruction of Turkish (? forces) in Hedjaz would resound throughout the East and would probably result in rapid extension of Arab hostility to Turks in Eastern Syria and across to Euphratesr In this connex ion King of Hedjaz has already informed me that he is in communication with Ibn Haddhal the head Sheikh of Amur at and expects excellent results as outcome of their cor- respondence* Operations of Faisal from Akaba are of great im portance in this connexion and it is vital that he should receive full support! Main essential is (? funds for liberal payment of tribesmenjwithout/this he can not expect to succeed in the face of strenuous efforts which we know from sure sources are being made by Turks to secure neutrality if not active co-operation of Arabs and thus restore situation^ My telegram Nor 1153 will have indicated the‘straits King Hussein is in for money and that we cannot expect himhlM to supply Fulsal with his full requirements* Moreover it is desirable for political reasons that King Hussein should not hear the whole brunt of operations in Maan Area and North nd thus secure a preponderating voice in regard to future settlement of Syrian problem, I therefore strongly urge Gomander~in-Chiei be empowered by War Office to exceed surn of £200,000 already granted for Arab operations in North and to increase it up to total of at least £500,000 should it be found necessary to do so, Ihen money is required it is required urgently and it is not possible to await specific approval without danger of losing opportunities* I cannot sufficiently emphasise importance which I attach to this question. Ill-advised economy at present juncture will result in robbing us of benefits of our Arab policy which now appear to be on the point of materialising, A review of total expenditure involved in connection with our whole Arab policy in comparison with political and military results obtained will amply justify a moderate outlay in order to achieve complete success, Commander-In-Chief concurs.ClitCULrtlEi)- TO THE KING AMD THE WAN CABINET Decipher, Sir 1{. Wingate (©airo) November 2nd.1917. ^y 9 No, 1153.“ Shereef of Mecca’s revolt has reached very critical stage and one in which Arab military operations have a very intimate connection with those of Allied forces in Palestine* Turkish forces held up by Arabs between Maan and Medina show a ration (sic) strength of over 20,000 men with approximately 90 machine guns and 100 guns / ten (exclusion of garrisons of Asir and Yemen), These forces are not entirely immobilized but are in a very precarious condition and it Would take but little to 'cause a complete disaster,' Crucial moment has arrived and we have sure information that enemy are fully aware of this and are straining every nerve to restore Arab situation by every possible means. This has further been confirmed by information contained in your telegram No, 10212 Through the medium A- of Bin Rashid and other agents they are spreading vigorous propaganda amongst Arabs And endeavouring to turn situation before it is too late. On the other hand more than a year of war is begin- ning. to tell on unstable nature of the Arab, peculation is beginning and old standing feuds are showing signs of reasserting themselves. Loose method of coordination which is all that Cheroof of Mecca can employ is showing signs of Wear under strain of war and there are various indication \H * ^ °l ^4 ^ 1 ^ ^2S2S£3B2K5«* indications that In certain^discontent is arising which creates suitable soil tor Turkish propa ganda* Shareef is fully alive to this and has more than once brought it to my notice and that of Colonel Wilson suggesting what is to him easiest and most attractive remedy viz: an increase in subsidy which will enable him to placate discontented elementSo Operation of toir Faisal in Maan area and his policy with Northern tribes has placed a heavy burden on exchequer of Shereef, in spite of extra assistance which we have given to Emir Faisal for this specific purpose, and there is no doubt that ho finds himself hard put to it to continue his payments to Hedjaz tribesmen* He not unnaturally takes up attitude that Emir Faisal*s operations are of such immediate benefit to Allied forces as to^-'warrant bulk of expenditure in connection with them falling upon His Majesty’s Government and that he therefore feels justified in once more urging an increase in his subsidy* While fully realizing that Shereef r s method of administering his finances is by no means beyond criticism^ and allowing that in normal circumstances further cash payments might bo open to legitimate objection^! am con vinced at present critical stage a certain increase is fully justified in order that we may not, for the sake of a relatively small sum of money, lose the full fruits of a oolicy which I venture to think has fully justified itself both from a military political and financial point of view. MoreoverI 'f, Moreover it is undesiralDle on political .-rounds that Shereef should he piaced in a position to arrue that cost of hmir Faisal’s operations and of any Arab movements which may eventuate in Syria has fallen mainly upon him* It will greatly strengthen his claims for a preponderating voice in any eventual settlement of that area and thus handicap us and still more our French Allies* Progress of revolt has shown very clearly that Shereef is not likely to put up any form of Government which would be acceptable in Syria, either s to Christians or Moslems, and it appeals improbable that such personal aspirations as he may have in that area can ever bo realized* Emir Faisal is regarded by many Syrians as possible head of a Syrian -Arab State^ but idea of a pure Sherifian Government is distasteful to all classes and whatever Arab Government is instituted in Syria can never be more than nominally under Meccan control or Suzerainty* In due course Shoreef will discover this for himself and he probably has a fairly shrewd idoa of it even now, but it would appear inadvisable to throw upon him bulk of expenditure incurred in liberating a country in which he has but little chance of realizing his aspirations to the full* In view of above arguments I put forward and strongly recommend following suggestion* That additional £25*000 a month which has already been promised to Shereef for 5 months after fall of Medina be given him now, and that it be continued lor a maximum1 ‘S': maxiraurn period of 5 raonths irrespective of date on wnich Medina may fall. Actual expense to His Majesty's Government will be the same and it will merely mean that e^.uici, a a 5 j occ a month is paid for 5 months from new instead of for 5 months iron day Medina falls. This would be made clear to Shereef in writing.[This Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government, and should be returned to ^he^oreign Office when done with unless required tor official use.] LULITAKY Decypher,.

Lat'oer 1 s operation has been very successful in pinning Turkish forces at Maan at a very convenient moment. . ? OuwdL Sir Further progress including several communications South of Maan is urgent^ Medina is in a very bad way and prompt and determined action might well secure its surrender. This can only be done with the aid of more trained troops to secure successes gained by Bedouins* Moreover approach of severe winter weather in Maan highlands will inevitably mean that many Nomad Bedouins will return to their tents. Legion is not yet fully trained but is quite a service able and well equipped unit. Moreover officers and men are impatient to join forces of Shereef of Mecca who is on his part becoming suspicious of further delay in sending them so that trouble is certain to arise if they are kept in Egypt much longer. I strongly urge therefore that Arab legion be used at once to consolidate and complete (?suecess) already achieved at Akaba and I trust political considerations will not be permitted to interfere with measure of urgent necessity.

Wingate to Mr. Balfour.—(Received May 77) 89 '' ) ' Cairo, April 26, 1917. ^ IN reference to my telegrams Nos. 404 and 459, recommending an increase in the subsidy granted to King Hussein, I have the honour to forward the translation of a memorandum on the subject I have since received from him. There are several statements made in this letter which require comment. 1 Xn the first paragraph the King evidently refers to Lord Kitchener’s message to him transmitted to Cairo in your telegram No. 303 of the 31st October, 1914; this was confirmed in a letter dated the 30th August, 1915, from Sir Henry McMahon which assured the Sherif of the approval of His Majesty’s Government “ of the Arab Caliphate when it should be proclaimed,” and that “ Bis Mwehy ^Government would welcome the resumption of the Caliphate by an Arab of true race. ’ , TT . 2 Sir Henry McMahon, in conveying to the Sherif the information that iiis Maiesty’s Government had sanctioned'thb monthly payment of 125,000/ did not specify how this should he expeiided by him, but mentioned the trust of His Majesty s Government that he would make satisfactory arrangements for the ensuing pilgrimage. In his reply (dated the 25th August, 1916) the Sherif wrote : — « Your Excellencv knows that the above-mentioned monthly pay of 12 5 0 007. is for the organisation of Government and its necessary admiuistrations and will be deducted from the amount which we left to the justice of Great Butam decide for our deficient Government, which is under Great Britain s guardianship and protectkmqduring her occupation of Basra and Irak. This quotation referred to a sentence in a previous lg ter ™7se7esoressed the 5th November 1915), in which he (as champion of the Arabs cause) ex pics _ his willingness 1 to cede temporarily in Irak “ the districts now occupied by Bntish troops,” but— “ without the rights of either party being prejudiced °I the Arab nation, to which these interests are egopmicallj vital) and a amst a suitable sum paid as compensation to the Arab (t.e., tho . is the period of occupation in order to meet the expenses winch a new kingdom bound to support.” This proposal of the Sherif has never, sO far as I can been definitely rejeJetaf d C reply appears to have been sent to the Shenf's letter of the 25th August, 1916 repeatedly stated that the Arab rising was arranged on the assumption ttdwhhin aBveekh its occurrence the fo^ tM “ d C:”wio,tio.. tl«t m Kin ? „» boon to ‘“t 5» .SKI to regarding to bon'' State, bis anatoy aa to“^recr ; . n l diminution French Political Mission under M.

He hoped, by driving the Turkish army o 1‘ ti of the other of Mecca and Medina, to start a movement which, with the co opeia2 Arabian chiefs, would secure the twerthrow e%#urkish domination throughout the Arabian peninsular He also desired to form an independent Arabian Government m the Hediaz to serve as a focus for Arabian nationalism, and which would be (ventually recognised by the Moslems as competent to safeguard their religious prejudices m respect of the custody of the Holy Places. -n? Before en o, a 0r in 0, in the enterprise he satisfied himself that these aims were nwu in conflict with the policy of the British Government, on whose assistance he would he dependent for the provision of the war material and money he required. Like other and even better informed individuals, at the beginning of the struggle lie under estimated the cost of success, and in particular the unexpected protraction of the military operations in the Hedjaz has rendered it impossible tor him to allot any considerable portion of his subsidy for the numerous services required for the establishment of his new Government. In addition to the upkeep or his troops m the Hediaz, he is now required to subsidise the northern Arabs, the majority of whose tribal leaders have provisionally afiven in their adherence, and wiio, when the time is ripe for such action, will harry ^the Turks flanks and communications in Palestine and Southern Syria. . . ^. I realise that His Majesty’s Government has already incurred a relatively heavy outlay in connection with the Hedjaz revolt, but I am confident tnat when an impartial review can be made it will Be found that the political anu military benefits accruing therefrom have been very cheaply acquired, and there are, in my opinion, strong and urgent reasons, both military and political, why we cannot now afford to refuse him the additional financial assistance he requires. In the first place the active intervention of the northern tribes cannot fail to cause very considerable embarrassment to the Turks in Syria, and is much to be desired from the* point of view of our own military operations. In the second place the adhesion of a number of Arab chieftains to the Sherif’s Government will tend to secure that semblance of national solidarity in the Arabian peninsula which alone can justify to the Moslem world the Sherif’s action in casting off allegiance to the Govern ment of the Caliph. Our responsibility in the eyes of our Moslem subjects and those of our Allies for the Sherif’s revolt makes it all the more incumbent upon us to do all in our power to secure its success within the limits imposed by oar obligations to France and considerations of general policy. I have, &amp;c. REGINALD WINGATE. Enclosure. Memorandum by King Hussein. (Translation.) WHEN Great Britain repeatedly and plainly declared, by writing, her desire to restore the Arab Caliphate, and when I found that the affairs of the Ottoman Government were being handled, by the Turanians, in such a manner as to deprive all the Moslems of the world of that happiness and welfare of which only a small part was being enjoyed by the Moslems of Turkey, I thought that to leave things as they were and abstain from negotiations, instead of remedying the situation in a manner that would be pleasing to God and to the Moslems, was a crime upon which I need not dwell. Accordingly I entered into negotiations with Great Britain and arrived at the desired result, which is known to all, in the form of an agreement, by the terms of which Great Britain promised to accord us her protection in our revolt, heedless of that the enemies of right might attribute to her an intention to do evil to the Moslems; because we knew, under the circumstances, that Great Britain’s success was our success, and her failure our failure. This should be the conviction of all those who wish the good of their nation, of their brethren in religion and even of the whole world, disregarding what false people attribute to them. It is sufficient, as a proof of this, to allude to the establishment of our Government and its future development, God willing, within the boundaries assigned to it, a fact that will close the mouth of those chattering fools. To this end a subsidy was assigned to us, the causes, object, and duration of which were well known, and we were promised the necessary protection inside our boundaries against any aggression, so that our Government might be enabled to arrange, in as short a time as possible, its internal affairs, and emerge into the worldin such a shape as would naturally^nd as a matter of course refute for ever all the false allegations made by those low people against our ally, the creator of our independence. This Government will also, when thus established, achieve tilings beyond the imagination of Great Britain, who has the upper hand, not simply in Those matters that concern her own interests, but also in everything that leads to the welfare ot the Moslems and their security from the foolish acts of irresponsible people, so that they may enjoy the blessings endowed upon them by God, but for which they are not grateful. This is the sole reason that made me accept to bear this burden of responsibility and follow this line of policy, which, I must frankly say, will save Great Britain millions of pounds expended on her cause before the Moslem world. If I find faithfulness (?) I will, with the help of God, arrive at my aim; but if I find anything that is contrary to this noble aim, I will have a thousand reasons for shame and humiliation, first of all, before Great Britain, my generous and noble benefactor, w T ho has been so kind and generous to me personally. This is my principle for which I live and which I follow until I die. The history of my life is dear and very, very sacred to me, and the only way to keep it unblemished is to follow my own conviction as regards the observation of the terms of our agreement. In view of this, and as the country’s independence has been officially acknowledged, there are among the notables and Ashraf of Islam men who can take over the task which we are doing now, and do it instead of us. As all the above introduction leads to the question of the increase of the subsidy, owing to the increase of our essential military expenditures, and refers also to the question of the boundaries, I might as well abstain from any further discussion in the question of the subsidy, because it lias been clearly expounded, first, by Sheikh Fuad El Khatib while in Cairo, and second, in two letters which we addressed to his Excellency the Agent at Jeddah. We have stated very clearly that the increase was intended for the establishment of the Government. However, it has been God’s will that up till now the Hedjaz railway has not been cut, although one of the fundamental conditions of our agreement was to have that railway cut in the first week of our rising. According to this item we did not attach any importance to the Medina garrison, and on the basis of it, we laid down oar plan of action, according to which our military operations were to terminate in a month’s or, at the utmost, in five weeks’ time. This is shown by the fact that during the first three weeks Mecca and Jeddah surrendered and El Taif was in such a condition as to promise no better fate. At that time we had not received any war material except 500 rifles. We hoped that Medina would also surrender in the same manner. Aside from the fact that the railway line remained in running order, we, on our part, could not obtain cartridges for the Gras rifles—the only weapon in our possession at the time—whicti we had ordered two months previously, with the result that the Medina garrison was reinforced by two divisions from Damascus, while our troops were not in such a condition as to withstand such a big force. In the meantime the Turks were able to advance half-way between Medina and Mecca, and we were then compelled to spend that subsidy, as well as another amount of which we had duly informed his Excellency the High Commissioner and which constituted the savings which we had been able to make—we spent all this on preparations in older to stop the enemy advance. Great Britain herself was so impressed by that situation teat she contemplated the despatch of otic division of her regular troops, which expedition would have incurred more expenses than the amount of increase asked for by us. But God has helped us at last to avert that danger. _ ^ . Leaving out of account the expenses incurred in mobilising and bringing together the Arabs, we point out the fact that the Turks are luring the Aran tribes to then- siae by money. They promise that if a tribe keeps quiet and neutral 51. will be paid monthly to each individual in it, and the same amount lor his camel, as we mentioned in our last two letters to the agent at Jeddab, sent to him by our Under-feecretary or 'oreign Affairs. , . ,, -rr -r .-i The impending and permanent danger resulting from leaving the Hedjaz railway 3 tact has necessitated the taking of energetic steps on our part to attack the Luvts nd drive them from their lines of communications, so that that danger might oe or ver averted. We thank God that the whole of the Syrian desert Arabs have come ver to our side-even a large part of the Shammar tribe, the people of our deadliest nemy, Ibn Rashid. All of these Arabs have come oyer to our northern army, as indicated in the telegrams received, through you, from the commandeis of 1 a The chiefs of the Billi tribe, who inhabit the coast line, came over to us lastuee .
