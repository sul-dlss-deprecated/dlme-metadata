Herewith a rough draft of a water supply scheme for Manamah Town, on the lines discussed. I hope to receive quotations from Home soon, (specification sent to England on 26th May,1940), but, owing to the disturbed conditions of the postal services, there may be some considerable delay. STaTE ENOINEEK'S dept. D.O. Bahrain. 4th July, 1940 Dear Yours sincerely, H.Weightman, B S qr.,I.C.S., H.B.M's Political Agent, Bahrain. ■ /VAXPROPOSED MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLY TOWN OF MAN AMAH Preliminary Scheme I suggest that the Municipal Garden in Manamah be us a site for the pumping station and overhead storage tank. The garden in question is centrally situated, and the land is free from any restrictions. The installa tion of the pump house and tank would in no way interfere with the amenities of this small but useful 'park'. The scheme proposed is as follows:- (1) PUMPS :- A pumping station to be installed near the present artesian well in the Municipal Garden consisting of two centrifugal pumps each capable of pumping 30,000 gallons per hour against a total head of 100 feet and to be electrically driven by direct coupled motors, with .the usual control gear, automatic ball floats, etc. (2) STORAGE :- Over the pump house, a storage tank of 120,000 gallons capacity to be erected, at a height (to tank bottom) ot 65 feet. Quotations are being obtained for (a) a pressed steel sectional tank, mounted on a steel framev/ork (b) a concrete tank mounted on reinforced concrete pillars. The tank would be covered in by means of light plates and the usual wood (ventilated) cover placed over the whole. (3) MAINS:- Mains to radiate from the tank controls as follows North, to Eastern luma Mosque. East, to sea near Dhawadi Mosque. South, to Shaikh Essa Road. i//est, to point near Husaini Mosque at cross road of Mani and Sh.Hamed Roads. These would be 'trunk' mains (say 6 ') quartering the town area, and acting as main supply pipes.At intervals of say 800 feet, sub-raains (say 3”) would be run as shown on the accompanying town plan, and these would feed the four sections of the town. Assuming 200 feet to be the maximum distance persons should walk to fetch water, it will be further necessary to run (say Ii M ) local feed pipes to points as shown on the plan. The v/ater pressure at these points would be approximately 20.22 lbs. per square inch. Reducing the area to be 'walked” by water carriers, means that more water supply points would be necessary, but of less output per point. I suggest that four taps, i.e. two for the male section and two for the female section, would be sufficient at % each v/atering point. Pipes already run from artesian wells for grouping purposes could be utilised, where they exist, for distribution, as also could the three washing places already constructed. A supply of water for the pumps would be obtained from the well in the iwunicipal Garden and two (or more) other wells in the vicinity, which would produce, collectively, 30,000- 40.000 gallons per hour. For purposes of calculation I have assumed the total population of i^anamah to be 30.000 (although from observation over a considerable period, I am of the opinion that it is less), and that 12 gallons per person per day would amply cover consumption for all purposes. The storage tank suggested could contain enough water for eight hours supply, with out pumping. (4) CONTROL :- I suggest that four master water meters be fitted on each 6 ' main which will indicate the consump tion in the areas supplied, and act as check meters later, when service meters exist in the town. Master / valves would also be placed on each main, and these could be automatic, to either cut off or reduce the flow at certain times of the day, or be hand-operated by— ?— © the pump house attendant. When the scheme is in operation, the existing artesian wells f (say 27/8,) after allowing for the main pump suctions^could be gradually closed in. A certain number could be used to supply water for the proposed public M dhobi ghats ,f which would, I presume, be situated as near the sea as practicable. If three such ,f ghats fT were made I suggest they be placed as unden- 1. Corner of Sea Road near Fakhroo’s Building. 2 . In compound of Baladiya Garden. o. On sea shore between Manamah Causev/ay and the mosque at Has Rumman, (sites marked 'G' on plan). In the case of the Baladiya washing place, this could drain into the main sewer which runs to the sea along Belgrave Road. (5) DRAINAGE :-To drain the waste water etc. from the watering points, a system of main and lateral drains would have to be layed as shown on the accompanying town plan. Two 12' mains coupled to 8 ' branches, which would drain the 800 feet sectors of distribution area. Short feeder drains would interconnect the actual watering points. The drains could be of earthen ware, or of local construction. The latter would be cheaper, and serv&amp; the purpose. The cost of local construction is at present approximately Rs. per 1000 feet. A drain is at the moment being layed from luma Mosque in Manamah (Western Section) to the washing place near Wawi f s house to take the waste water from the former. This drain will form part of the main scheme, at a future date. Levels of the town area are being taken, and when completed a drainage scheme will be prepared and estimated for. P.T.0.-— G&gt; This brief outline will serve to indicate the general purpose of the scheme, a more detailed description together with the quotations will be submitted when prices are obtainable. Four leading British Firms have been asked to quote from a specification on the above lines. 10th July, 1940 Dated: 5th J/Thani,1359. State _ .nwifNT OF BAHRA1 governmentExcerpt from the minutes of the Anti-Malarial Committee Meeting held on the 16th July 1940 in the Govt. Hospital, iahrain. The State Engineer^ Reoort :- A tentative scheme for providing Manama with a main water supply centralised at the Baladya garden, where a water tower would be erected was discussed and examined from maps. There appear to be no major difficulties. The area of supply would be Manama town proper. A drainage system for wastage water was included. This to be erected side by side with the water mains to drain into the sea. A sewage scheme was not discussed at this juncture. Drains would be made from local materials of concrete etc., only certain items such as the water tower and pumps would need to be imported. The cost was estimated at a maximum of four lakhs, allowing for war prices. The scheme was warmly apnroved of. The State Engineer stated that he was obtaining estimates for material from several Trading British Engineering firms. Excerpt from the minutes of the Anti-Malarial Committee The State Engineer f s Water Scheme Report: - This was explained in further detail. An estimate of 30 to 40,000 gallons per hour pumped from the 3 wells of supply was the out-put given as being more than sufficient for Manama town. Questions were raised as to water being laid on in houses. The reply was that the water supply was sufficient, and that each house shouldbear its own cost of piping. Mr. Steele further explained about the water tower which was only for reserve purposes, and if necessary- for example in hot weather--, water could be supplied direct from the wells without having to circulate through the tower. A lengthy argument, led by Mr. Abdulla A. Al-Zayid now took place, as to the advantages of using the Zfnj lake with its sweet water, as a source of supply as well as a permanent reservoir. Mr. Weightman finally summed up by saying that its dis advantages were:- bring the water in to Manama (ap rox. -g- lakh) (3) The diminu tion of water supply for the local date-gardend. He suggested that samples of water should be brought from Zinj and other wells in Manama to be tested by members personally at the next meeting. The relative merits of each kind of water could then quickly be ascertained. Meeting held on the 22nd July, 1940. ( 1 ) Its imourity (2) The extra cost involved toA meeting of the Anti- malarial General Committee took place on July 29th at midday at the Baladya. All members were present with the exception of Mr. C.D. Belgrave, and three others, who were unavoidably detained. AGENDA Continuation of the discussion of the State Engineer’s Water Scheme, where certain water tests will be carried out w . The water tasting test was immediately carried out. Eleven members tasted 7 different water specimens from the wells and springs of 1. Manama Municipality. 3* Juma Moaque. 5* Khalil Kanoo’s Garden. 2. Haji Khalil Kanoo (near 4. Abdul Aziz Qosaibi. residence). 6. Yousuf Fakhroo. 7 Zinj. Two useful facts emerged from this test The wells outside Manama are sweeter. (b/ About 40$ declared that the Manama water was also good. The ensuing discussion now took the standpoint that it wouldbe better to develop a scheme producing the best water, even though extra expenditure would be involved. Mr. Abdulla Ali Al-Zayidin circular letter made out a very good case for water from Adari. Mr. Steele mentioned again the facts that 400,000 Galls, of water per day were running to waste in Manama, which was more than Zini could ever produce. Mr. Ahmed Fakhroo suggested tapping the sweet water of Swaifiah near Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah’s residence. This seemed a possible solution to the problem. iina^iy it was decided that the next step would be to take an analysis of that water, both chemically aid bacteriologically, aid then to report at the next meeting. 6 J SECRETARY, ANTI-MALARIAL COMMITTEE.D.O. No./^7' fi , Dated the 14th Octooer 1D40 I am writing to you as Secretary of the Malaria Conmdttee in regard to the water supply question as I shall have left Dy the time you get back. 2m You will remember that at the last Co mi t tee meeting an undertaking was given that tests votuld be made with certain wells at cfvraficA in order to see whether the v ater was pure and flowed in adequate quantities# Detailed analyses have been made both of AvafW,water and of the water from the a wells in the Baladiya Garden and close round end they show / that although in both cases the water is very hard it is perfectly pure for drinking. On the other hand tests show that in order to obtain sufficient water for Manama from siwafiaA it will be necessary to drill no less than 18 wells (this being calculated from the amount of flow or certain selected wells in that area). This of course makes it quite impossible to consider further any idea of bringing in water from the west of the town. The cost is very heavy, there would be high recurring charges for taking electric power beyond ths town to run pumps,and a very large area would have to be reserved# This in turn would mean dispossessing who the owners of a number of gardens iferiafli would of course have 4 to be com &gt;ensateci and there would probably a considerable 'a effect on tho flow of wells in other neighbouring gardens the owners cf which also would object very strongly. In the centre of Manama there is an adequate flow sufficient to meet/- Dr. R# H. B. Snow, Secretary, Malaria Committee, Bahrain.2 meet the requirements of the whole town and in view of the difficulties of proceeding with the ^wafiaC scheme and also of the fact that a very large proportion of the members of the Committee were perfectly well satisfied with the taste of the Baladiya Garden v/ater at the meeting when we made tests, I recommend very strongly that you should now proceed with the scheme for linking up the requisite number of wells with that in the Baladiya uarden end making chat the centre of the town water supply. I hope it will be possible to get on with Uiis quickly since it might well be found wise and economical to make use of the services of tne bridge engineer who at the moment have nothing much to do. 3. I shall look forward to hearing in due course that Manama has its pipe^water supply. I am sure this will make ail the difference to the health^amenities of the town. 4.

It would appear that the original proposals envisaged a mainssupply for raw water only and no considera tion was given to the equally urgent necessity for a main or site supply of drinking water. This requirement could be provided from a separate main of lesser capacity then required for raw water. xUi alternative would be to provide the essential distillation plant and alow the public to purchase as they have hitherto done from a private contarctor. I would like to have your personal views on this important point, as I understand that one of the local merchants is prepared to set up a distillation plant as a private venture. The agant referred to is Haji Khalil Kanoo. G. J. Pelly, Esqr.,0.B.E.,I.C.S., H. B.M’s Political Agent, BAHRAIN.D.O. No.^&lt;fj*]-6/89. POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN. Dated the I7th June, 1945 ' i^. My dear Leigh Reference your Demi-official letter No. MWS/1/64, dated the 6th June, 1946, and our subsequent conversation. i 2. I agree with you that a mains supply of drinking water is es. 'isial. But I would prefer to see it run by the State. general, I am not in favour of public utilities bein^ run privately. ? \ 3. I know du are very pre-occupied now, but I think, the scheme fc . supply of raw-cum-drinking water should have very high priority. I see from Steele*s Demi-official letter dated the 4th July, 1940, to Weightman that four leading British firms had been asked to quote for material. I am sure those specifications are no longer valid and I think it is necessary to ask for quotations (for mate rial both for the raw water and drinking water) as soon as possible. Manufacturers in the United Kingdom will deal with orders in the order of priority and.while I am entirely ready to try to obtain as high a priority as possible for the materials for this scheme, it is obvious that the sooner they are ordered the sooner they will be supplied.
