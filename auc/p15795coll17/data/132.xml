Of Dutch-German parentage, he tells of his travels from Europe and the United States, where he spent his youth, to Beirut and then Cairo where he and his Lebanese wife settled in the early 1980s. He provides an account of his embrace of Sufi Islam, and his connections with locals and foreigners involved with that community in Egypt. Holdijk traces the development of the Writing Program at AUC, including its relationship with its parent department, English and Comparative Literature, and how its 2007 separation into its own department, Rhetoric and Composition, came about. He discusses the faculty in the Writing Program and the Rhetoric Department, its operations and methods on matters like grading, course offerings, his integration of computing in the program, and challenges like plagiarism and securing necessary resources from the administration. A portrait of AUC students over the years is given, from their academic and social background to motivations and worldviews.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>oral histories</dc:type><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017; American University in Cairo.
