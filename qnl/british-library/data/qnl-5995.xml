The Ministry for Foreign Affairs present their compliments to His Britannic Majesty's Embassy, Bagdad, and have the honour to state that the Iraqi authorities concerned have received from tea merchants in Basrah a complaint that tea is being smuggled from India and Ceylon, where two prices are fixed for teal one of 10 pence per pound for tea intended for export by special licence and one of 5 pence per pound for tea intended for local consumption. Tea is being exported to Iraq in receptacles other than those legally authorised for use in the packing of tea intenci ed for export, and is classified as goods other than tea And thus finds its way into Koweit or direct into Basrah to flood all markets in Iraq and compete with legitimately imported tea.

Bagdad. With reference to your letter No* 526/2/36 f dated the 3rd August 1936* I am directed to say that the Indian Tea Licensing Committee have also received representations from the International Tea Committee regarding the smuggling, of Indian tea into Basrah from Karachi and that the former are making the necessary enquiries in the matter* The result of these enquiries will be communicated to you as soon as possible*Copy of letter No. 314/5/27 dated the 20th April, 1937 from His Majesty’s Ambassador, Bagdad to H.E* the viceroy of India, Foreign Department, Simla. tm mm mm mm m With reference to the despatch No. F.583-N/36 of October 2nd, 1936, from the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, I have the honour to transmit a translation of a further note from the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs concerning the alleged smuggling of tea into this country. 2. It will be seen that the Iraqi Government now state that the tea in question is smuggled to Koweit, either direct from India or from Ceylon via India, and that from Koweit it is imported openly into Iraq after the payment of the usual Iraqi customs dues. I understand that the advantage of this method derives from the fact that, since the price of tea for export from India is higher than that for internal consumption, tea which is smuggled into Koweit can, even after payment of the Iraqi customs dues, be sold more cheaply in this country than tea exported from India in the legitimate manner. 3. It is evident that the Iraqi authorities suffer no direct loss on account of traffic of this sort, and I am informed that their intervention is prompted by merchants here who suffer unfair competition from the illicit imports via Koweit. It would also appear that the law-abiding exporter of tea from India is prejudiced by this illegal traffic. 4. It has been suggested to me that an end could be put to the traffic in question if the Iraqi Government were to require certificates of origin in respect of all tea imported into this country. I am not awaire whether such a solution would be welcome to the Govt, of India, and I have therefore made no mention of it to the Iraqi authorities. I should, however, be grateful to receive the observations of the Govt, of India on this point. 5. A copy of this despatch is being sent to H.E. the Governor of Ceylon.H O , - 18/55 / 8 /5823.

No cases of smuggling of tea from Ceylon have come to the notice of the said authorities. In this connexion it should be noted that goods imported from Ceylon are shipped to Iraq only via India. As to how smuggl ing is effected, it is found out that tea is smuggled from India to Koweit whence it enters Iraq in a lawful manner. The Ministry therefore request that the authorities concerned - in India may be informed accordingly with a view to the prevention of the smuggling of tea from India to Koweit. The Ministry avail themselves of this opportunity to express their highest consideration and esteem. .

On the other hand we cannot, of course, ignore the Tndian ^ovemr.ent*s aspect of the matter, since the exportation of tea from Tndia without payment of the special export tax is of course an act of smuggling, and so long as there are markets for this smuggled tea, there is a direct incentive for tea to he smuggled. The Government India will, therefore, doubtlessly expect the cooperation of the Shaikh in stopping this form of, 'trade”, via huwait into ’Iraq. 1p rom Greenway*s letter it appears that ,r arzook has shipped some of this tea to Aden. It is presumed that the reason he did so was that the ’Iraq tea market was glutted for the moment and that higher prices at that particular time prevailed in Aden. 5.

No licence is, however, required for exports of tea from a British Indian port to ports situated in the Indian States in India. The shipments of tea from ports in Indian States to foreign ports are also not subject to any control» It is therefore not surprising that a number of merchants ship tea from British India , to ports in the Indian States and re-export the tea from these ports to foreign ports. The restriction placed on the shipments,of tea to foreign ports from British India is in this manner evaded. 2. Complaints have been received in the past from trading interests in Basra that considerable quantities of Indian tea are re-export^ from dutch Mandvi and other »jr ports in Indian States. Information has also been received that 1089 cases of tea have been shipped from Cutch Mandvi to Koweit by the s.s. 'Cranfield M which left Karachi for Koweit on 5-1-1938. The question whether such evasions cannot be stopped is being investigated and I shall be most grateful if you will kindly let me know whether the •Crahfield*—T ~ •CraafiBld* cjonsignment was in fact lanled at your port.

Tea imported Into Iraq fron India in atea^ahipa coding froi Indian ports is not admitted unices the conaign&amp;ent Is properly declared In the chip’s manifest and, as the Iraqi Government understand that copies of these manifests are given to the Indian Cmstoae apartment, thia arrangement in itself onoures that all such tea has bean latrfully exported from India. It would not, therefore, in their opinion, serve any useful purpose to impose on tea exported in this manner the further require, ont of the production of certificates of lawful exportation, i*e« licences granted by the Indian v©a lif'enaing JOimaittee or certified copies thereof* 6. Tea unlawfully exported from India is shipped chiefly la native craft to *\oweit. It la then either taken in transit thxough Kowolt to Iren., or reshipped in native craft to Basra. In either event, it is frequently declared to the Iraqi Customs authorities and duty is paid. The Iraqi revenue department does not therefore suffer, but merchants /who (lei/Vae) His excellency The Oovernor-O ncral of India, Exteraal /iffair* Department, *uw n^jg./ bis who deal in tea lawfully exported froa Inaia do, because, for reasons which appear to be connected with an excioe or export duty leviable in India on exported tea and with the limitation of tea expoz'te by the International Tea xports dcheue, 'hade' tea, puichased in India and smuggled out of the country, can be obtained abroad at a much lower price than lawfully exported tea, and can therefor© be sold at lower prices in the Iraqi markets than the tea exported legiait&amp;toly# 4. The Iraqi Government add that there are other people who not only brln the tea to Koweit which hua not been lawfully exported from Inaia, but who aleo sBiuggle it into Iraq from owe it, thereby making a still higher profit* 6* The Iraqi C-oveminent fear that, If they refuse attalaaion to tea declared at the oweit-Iraq frontier (or brought to Baera in native craft) which i* not accompanied by the export licence of the Indian Tea Lieenaing Go im it tee, the chief result will be that those r\o now duel are to the Iraqi Gu&amp;toms their tea unlawfully brought from India will cease to do t&gt;o and will resort to smuggling It into Iraq instead* Whereat the situation, both from the point of view of the customs Department and of the law abiding tea merchants of Iraq, will become worse instead of better* They also think that the restrictions which the shaikh of Koweit has already agreed to Impose in Roweit (sec paragraph - .-V 1 v iHii*n I ■-&gt;»*■»» - J TL _ .,. ... -“V-T.-V t-r ******* Vv *W 'fc* 3 of the Political eai&amp;ent’e dea witch to the Government of ^ 4 - India, ho* 0/60 of January 22nd) will, in any event, not prove very effective, for they foresee that once they become known the people dealing in this unlawfully exported /teaii tea will a top declaring it and will begi i to import it into Koweit concealed in other goode* The Ira«i Jtovernaent do not fe;jl that the control of the Kovelti cut.teams authorltiea is strong enough to prerent this* 6. For then© reasons the Iraqi {Jorarmeat explain that they have eonie to the conclusion that the proposals contained in the despatch to which I have referred in paragraph 1 above would not serve the desired purpose, unleaa in addition, ua Inaiazi loveraaent official could he posted to Kowelt to examine all Imported goods with a view to searching for concealed tea* 7. I appreciate, however, that such a proposal is not practicable and the Ministry of Foreign *iffairet probably foreseeing that it could not b© accepted, have suggeeted that, failing the concurrence of the JOvemaeat of India in this plan, the beat remedy would proba &gt;ly be for the apv&gt;ropriat© authorities in India to strengthen such measures as are already in force to prevent thv ex ort of unlicensed tea to Iraq and to the Persian (fcslf ports* 9. X should be £lad if you would infom me whether you think it possible to give effect to this suggestion in any way. In general, it would appear that Indian exporters are as much interested at* the Iraqi tea merchants in putting a stop to the illegal export of tea from India* 10* I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* I have the honour to be, My Lord Marquess, Your Jnraahiy/’s most obedient Servant, (;ga*) J ^es l organ*c- O if From, Political Agency, Kuwait• The 15th June, 1938.

Sugar, piecegoods and spices are the principal articles frequently re-exported from Bombay by country craft to ports in the Persian Gulf. It *as considered that the high rates of Customs duty to i&amp;hich the articles v.ere liable in India offered considerable inducement for smuggling them back into the country. With a vie*, therefore, to preventing such nalpractices, a procedure v.as devised in consultation Tilth your predecessor in 1924, v.hereby, immediately after the shipment of such goods for Persian Gulf Ports, this Custom House sent an advice to the Political Officer at the port of destination requesting him to certify the arrival and landing of the goods at such port. It yjae also agreed at the time that the Political Officer concerned should satisfy himself, before counter-attesting a landing certificate, that the goods in questior had actually been landed at the port mentioned. I enclose copy of the relevant corres pond ence. 3 . Recently, there arose an occasion to enquire from the Political Officer at Muscat whether such shipments to Dhofar should be permitted at the discretion of the Custom House and, if so, whether the British Consular Authority would be able to obtain evidence of landing in each case. In reply he stated that the evidence of landing of the cargo would be entirely dependent on the statement of the local administration for which no responsibility could be accepted. A copy of the relevant correspondence is enclosed. 4. It will he agreed that the evidence so furnished will be of little value as establishing heyond reasonable doubt that the goods in question have actually been landed at destination in the Persian Gulf and have not been smuggled hack into India. The/The only other alternative for this Custom House would be to refuse permission for such shipments* But such drastic action wculc have the effect of depriving certain provices in 1he Gulf of some of the necessaries of life for the supply of which they are dependent on Bombay, and is bound to hamper trade and to be contrary to public interests and policy* 5. Pince the time the procedure was introduced, landing certificates have been regularly received by this Gust on House duly countersigned by the other Political Officers concerned. Hone of these Officers has made mention of any difficulty experienced in verifying the actual landing of the goods. 6* In view, however, of the reply of the Political Officer at Dhofar, the questions which arise for consideration are whether the position at the other ports is the same as at Bhofar, whether the certificates issued by the other Political I Officers are based on statements of the local authorities, if so, whether certificates issued on the basis of such statements | 't'e accepted as establishing beyond any doubt the arrival of the goods at the port of destination and whether the procedure agreed, upon in 1924 and now in vogue should not be re-examined f o see whether it really fulfils the object and offers the security for which it was devised* 1 should be much obliged if you could kindly have this matter thoroughly examined and considered in respect of the points mentioned above./■“\ Copy of letter No.3 Confl. of 1924, d^ted 1 he ?3rci February, 1924, fron A.IT.Green, Esquire, H.A., Collector of Custons, Bombay, to the Political Resident, Bushire. m &gt; n t hm » ■ »&lt; I have the honour to state that it has recently cone to ray notice that dutiable goods are transhipped at, or goods from bond or goods on vhich a drawback of duty has af riuBy ha-s been allowed are exported by county craft from this port nominally to some port in the Persian Gulf. The boat sails and either goes straight to Cutch or Kathiawar or calls at the port named and brings the cargo straight back to Cutch or Kathiawar (where it is believed improper rebates are obtainable). j?'ree transhipment or reshipment of bonded or cirav.back goods to Cutch is inadmissible and hence this^ethod is adopted to evade the prohibition. 2. The only safeguard against such evasions is to require the shippers to execute a bond under Section 138 of the Sea Customs Act in a sum equal to twice the amount of duty leviable on the goods for the landing of the goods at the port of desti nation or otherwise satisfactorily accounting for them. When the bond is furnished an intimation is sent to the Political Agent or other British representative at the port concerned and he is requested to inform us of the arrival of the vessel at his port and of the discharge of the cargo there, and on receipt of his reply to this effect the bond is cancelled. The Political Officers have apparently to depend on the reports or certificates of the local Customs authorities. 1 an however doubtful whether the landing certificates issued by the Gulf Customs authorities can safely be accepted as reliable. 1 should therefore be much obliged if you could see your way to issue instructions to all the officers concerned that they should satisfy themselves before sending an advice to this Custom House or countersigning a landing certificate brought to them for this purpose that the goods covered by it have actually been landed. 1 enclose for your information a list of the principal ports in the Persian Gulf and Arabia to which shipments are made by country croft.Copy of letter i^o*464 of 1924, dated the 14th March, 1924, from H.D.G.Lav:, Esquire, I.C.S., Secretary to the Hon’hle the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Collector ot Customs, R ombay * With reference to your letter !!o*3 Confl. dated the 23rd February, 1924, 1 am directed to inform you that instructions are being issued to all officers concerned that before sending advice to you or countersigning a Landing Certificate brought to them for this purpose they should satisfy themselves that the ge goods covered by it have actually been landed.

I have the honour to refer to your letter cii ed above and to enclose, for ready reference, copies of your previous letters on the same subject. 2. As you are av;are, the object underlying the system of sending intimations of transhipments at Bombay is to ensure that the goods permitted to be transhipped are not smuggled back into the country to the detriment of Revenue. Erom your letters in 1933, it was clear that -the ports of Sheher, Dhofar and Gissan were unrecognised ports, and therefore the Custom House had no alternative but to refuse permission to transhipment to these ports. Ibis refussl led to a representation in 1934, from His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to the Government of Bombay* The entire province of Dhofar, - so it was represented, forming part of His Highness’s dominion was entirely dependent on Bombay for certain of its supplies. It was therefore urged that the prohibition of transhipment deprived the inhabitants of certain necessaries and that it should therefore be with drawn .

With reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No. 1437/29B-I#L#A#» dated the 10th February 1938 f I am directed to forward, for information, a co y of the papers noted in the attached list, on the above subject. 2. A« regards Kov^eit and Iraq . I am to explain that while the Shaikh of Koueit agreed to the proposal that all importa tions of Indian tea into Koweit should be required to be accompanied by certificates of lawful exportation from India, ihe Government of Iraq were airainst the adoption of any such proposal in regard to importations of tea into Iraq. In the circumstances the Government of India considered it necessary that the shaikh of Koweit should also be released from his erragement. As, however, requested by the Indian Tea Licensing Committee in paragraph 5 of their letter of the 10th February 1930 the Government of India are arranging to obtain information from time to time to show particulars of importation/ of Indian tea into Kov^eit. The Government of Iraq, on the other ha &gt;d, have suggested that the appropriate authorities in India should strengthen such measures as are already in force to prevent the export of unlicensed tea to Iraq and to the Persian Gulf Ports. This question has already been a engaging the attenticn of the Licen sing committee and I am to enquire whether Vr* Holland has since submitted any re)ort on his investigations into the alleged illicit traffic in tea from India. 3, as regards Iran . I am to invite attention to paragraph 1 of the letter from the British Vice-Consul, 3ahidan, No. 1181-7/81, dated the 28th September 1937, to the British Consul General at Khorasan ( a copy of which was forwarded with tnis le.artment let or dated the 22nd Januazy 1938), wherein it has been reported that the Iranian Customs authorities at :tahidan do not allow the clearanou of any consignment unless it is covered by a certificate of origin. In view of the fact that Iranian GovemrcenVs request for a relaxation of the existing control of exports of tea on the Indo-Iranian land frontier has consistently been refused so far and that no similar control is in force on other land frontiers, the Government of India feel that they would not be justified in approac ing Iran for- 2 - ti iitening up her requirement of certificates of origin as suggested in paraf?;raph 6 of your letter of the 10th February 1938. 4. As regards Laa Bela * it will be seen from trie Memorandum, dated the 2lst February 1938 t from the Agent to the Go?en*or General in Baluchistan, that the authorities of that State deny that there is any export of unlicensed tea throu^i their ports but hare asked to be supplied with any detailed information available. The Government of India are instructing he Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan to «rite to the Customs authorities at Karachi, but meanwhile they wo Id be glad to have any particulars on this oint which may be in the possession of the Licensing committee.JgKfe 1 . • IsdiSn^iSSnSS: i^^rtranl ^ooretaiy £o tne loTammont ox India f Com eroe # »*u. • • • • • • xs allied »n a .rUft- abroad of lndiaB_-^a.

In my letter No#l2l/29-I # L.A# of the 6th 1 ay 1937 Government were informed of the action proposed by the License ing committee in regard to the apparently excessive importa tions of tea into the States fcft of X&amp;thiawar and Catch.

There are however certain areas in which the absorption of tea is so heavy as to preclude this explanation and l!r# Holland has now been instructed to concentrate his enquiries in these territories; and should this investigation lead to definite results the Government of India will be immediately informed# 6. As regards the alleged smuggling of tea into Kowoit, In q and Iran f with which the enclosures given with y^ur letter of tne 22nd January are afaetoi almost wholly concemedg the Indian ?oa licensing Committee observe with appreciation that attempt! are *eing made to induce the appropriate authorities to prevenl the import of Indian tea which is not ac^omparJLod by certifica tes of origin in the fom of export licesaB ig a^d .b^the^ ^• 2 - Ctoriitieo.

The amounts involved are ntt however large and since it is part of the industry's policy to maintain the unrestricted export of ea into Afghanistan, the Com ittee think that this incr ase in the frontier trade is on the tfiole unimportant. They would aug eat that requirement by the Iranian Custom authorities of a definite certificate of origin on all imports of tea, which would take the form of an ejq&gt;ort license .granted by the Licensing committee, mi^t effectually prevent smuggling in the future and they would suggest that m^rw representations to t is end might be made t by the Government of India. 7 ey would point out however that such rumours of smuggling as are net w th from Iran maybe due in great part to the policy of the that endeavours might be made to obtain particulars of Indian tea landed at Koweit and should it be possiole for Government the committee. 6th tfay the Committee informed the Government of India that they were of the opinion that the allegations of the export of Central Fonopoly Co. in blending Indian tea with inferior quality Iranian tea which, as remarked in their letter No. 207/29-1.L.A. of the 28th Fay 1957, would pro luce many of the effects which would result :NO. * &lt; CJU) ^ ► J s' \ V p 7 J POLITICAL AGSNCY, KTT’AIT. -Jated, 8th December 1938.

It is also reported that the manifest is actually made out for Busrah. Ihe consignments are said to have been des patched by 5 country craft belonging to (1) Ahmed Kharafi (2) Yacoob Felachavi (3) Ahmed bin Nassar, all residents of Kuweit. The name of the craft that left first is ♦Sirdar*. All the boats are said to have left one after the other after the 25th November, 1940. Possibly therefore some of them may arrive at Kuweit after the receipt of this letter by you. 2. I shall be grateful if you will very kindly institute secret inquiries throughjsome reliable per sen in this matter. It is not unlikely that the consign ments may be landed actually at some point away from the harbour. If the consignments are located, you may very kindly find out from the respective tindals the actual facts of the shipments, viz. whether they were ^ * - I in*)effected from Jamnagar or from Kundla. Also please forward to me the Kundla manifests which may he found with the tindals. 3.
