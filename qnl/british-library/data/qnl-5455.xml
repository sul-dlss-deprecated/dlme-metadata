Sir, With reference to your letter No.W.C.36637 of April 18th, regarding the replacement of the damaged War Grave tablets in the British Cemetery at Shiraz, I have now received from one of the best local stonemasons the following estimate for carving and supplying stones of the same surface area but twice as thick as the original entablatures Black Persepolis Limestone 35 rials per stone 1 rial per letter of inscription. Local Yellow Limestone 18 rials per stone 1 rial per letter of inscription Fixing chargee for 15 tablets Rials 80. 2. The Persepolis stone is a fine and durable dark grey limestone which takes a polish. If funds permit I would strongly recommend that the work be carried out in this stone. The local limestone is the same as the plinths on which the entablatures are fixed. 3. If it is desired to replace the partially destroyed memorial stones of graves Nos. 2 and 16 and the missing stone or stones of grave No.43, a further charge of 30 rials for each plinth must be added to the cost of the tablets. I would observe that the damage to the two memorial stones is a matter of appearance, the inscriptions themselves being intact. 4. The official rate of exchange is Rials 80 to £ 1 . 5.

Sir, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith an extract from the minutes of the Shiraz Cemetery Committee meeting of March 11th, 1939 at which it was resolved to move to the British Cemetery the few remaining gravestones of British subjects buried in the old Armenian Cemetery at Bagh-i-Takht. g. This cemetery which was apparently given to the Armenian community by Shah Abbas was used as a place of burial for Europeans uo to 1917 when owing to its being continually desecrated Colonel Gough, His Majesty’s Consul at that time, purchased the present British Cemetery. 5 . Twenty stones with inglish inscriptions have disappeared within the last five years and two within the last fortnight. The remaining three, with the following inscriotions, I have had removed to the British Cemetery, where it is hoped, after the recent measures taken for the Cemetery’s protection, they will be in greater safety:- ODLING.

The only foreign gravestone now remaining at Bagh-i- Takht is that of Freiherr von Minutoli but I do not imagine that its size will protect even this one much longer. 6 . My predecessor was evidently of the opinion that you should be consulted before any stones were removed and had there been no urgency in the matter I would certainly have done so.

Consul© -J Enclosure to Shiraz despatch No* 8 of 18th March, 193 9 Extract from the minutes of the Shiraz Cemetery Meeting of March 11 th 1959* 104* Mr. King stated that on February 2Lst he visited the old Armenian Cemetery at Bagh—i—Takht with a German Professor, Herr Dr. Hinz, who was interested in the grave of Freiherr von Minutoli, the first Prussian Minister to Persia. Dr. Hinz wished to embellish the tomb and to obtain the co-operation of the British colony in putting up the fourth wall. Mr. King found that of the 25 gravestones with English inscriptions which had been there when the cemetery was last inspected in 1935 by Mr. Gamble, only five remained, that the three walls although solidly built apd already large holes at the base on the north side and were under-mined by a water course on the west side, and thet the cemetery as a whole appeared to be used as a public latrine for the barracks. It further appeared from the Consular records that the three walls had been erected in 1928 out of funds provided by the foreign colonies and thot the Armenian community who had undertaken to put up the fourth wall had failed to do so in spite of reminders reiterated over a number of years. Moreover in 1934 the municipality had registered the cemetery as V/aqf property and the Armenians had allowed the period of 3 months in which opposition could be made to lapse without protest. On December 8 th 1934 His Majesty’s Consul wrote to the Governor General requesting that the cemetery should be respected but no reply had been received, although the head of the Armenian community had been assured by the Rais-i- Baladieh on March 30th 1935 that the sale of the property would be postponed and that no decision ,ould be taken without his being notified. In view of the foregoing Mr. King had informed Dr. Hinz that he saw no possibility of raising further funds for the preservation of a cemetery which at any moment might be swept away by the military authorities and had suggested that the remaining foreign gravestones, including that/I ft 4014 j th^t of freiheri* von Minutoli should he removed to the British Cemetery. Dr. Hinz however was bent 01 jmt his scheme of preserving v.Minutoli’s tomb in situ. Mr. King then read the following extract from the minutes of the l&lt; 3 th Meeting held on November 27th, 1936:- ' 88 . The question of removing the tombstones of British subjects from the disused cemetery at Baba Kuhi to the British Cemetery was discussed. It was decided that this cannot be done without the consent of such relatives of ersons buried there as can easily be traced (e.g. Miss Gerrard) and also only under instructions from His Majesty’s Minister. Mr. Watkinson pointed out that other interests concerned, Armenians and Catholics, might heve to be consulted, as the removal of stones by the British representatives might be detrimental to their interest.' Mr. King added if the remaining stones were to be preserved at all they must be removed immediately, that Miss Gerrard who had two sisters buried there had given her consent, that no other relatives could be easily traced and that the Armenian community had apparently already abandoned th ; ir own interests. There was no plan of the cemetery and no other means of discovering the site of any grave from which the stone had disappeared. It was resolved unanimously that Mr. King should have the remaining stones with English inscriptions removed at once and placed against the wall in the British Cemetery.In any further communication on this^ubject, please quotj«^^ imunication on tins subject, pleage quotj/^ No.^7^f/7^AA ^ and address —not to any person hy name, but to— “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office,!London, S.W.

In explanation he stated that it was not usual in Iran fox* cemeteries to be considered the property of a particular party, and in consequence it was not customary for then to be registered# He added that, for the reason that cemeteries enjoyed a oonmon respect as burial-grounds, there wai no risk of Incursion upon them. I an not satisfied with Monsieur Intisam’s explanation, .h? Britiah war cemeteries at dhiraz and Hamadan have been registered: in the case of the rCazvin cemetery, though evidence of registration cannot at present be tx*aced, a special author ization from the Council of Minister assigned the land in question for Ui?e as a British cemetery in perpetuity.

Sir, • I have had under consideration Mr. Butler’s despatch No. 105 (111/5/38) of the 14th March regarding the maintenance of the British cemeteries at Henjam and Basidu. 2. It has not been possible to trace in the archives of this department or of the India Office the existence of a title to the land on which either cemetery is situated. Since it appears that, for the purposes of registering the cemeteries in the name of the Imperial War Graves Commission, it will be necessary to establish such a title, I shall be glad if you will, as suggested in paragraph 4 of Mr. Butler’s despatch, now approach the Persian Government with a view to acquiring a title to the land, either by purchase or lease, in return for a nominal payment. 3. With regard to the question of expenditure on the cemeteries, I consider that the simplest procedure would be for the sum payable by His Majesty's Government to be charged to the account kept by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Bushire with the Foreign Office, as an advance on behalf of the Imperial War Graves Commission, and for the Government of India's share in the expenditure to be charged directly to them through the account of the Political Resident at Bushire.

With reference to Foreign Office letter E 706/706/34 of the 9th February, regarding the maintenance of the British cemeteries at Henjam and Basidu, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to transmit to you, to be laid before the Marquess of Zetland, the accompanying copy of a despatch on the subject from His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires at Tehran. 2, it will be seen that Mr. Butler considers that for the purpose of registering the cemeteries in the name of the Imperial War Oraves Commission, it will be necessary to establish some title to the land on which they are situated. Mr. Butler has been unable to trace the existence of any such title in the case of either cemetery, and a search in the archives at the Foreign Office has failed to throw any light on the matter. Lord Halifax therefore proposes, subject to Lord Zetland’s concurrence, and assuming that no information regarding the ownership of the land is available in the India office, to instruct Mr. Butler to approach the Persian Government with a view to acquire a title to the land, by purchase or lease, in return for a nominal payment. 3. V/ith regard to the question of expenditure on the cemeteries, raised in paragraph 2 of Mr. Butler’s despatch, Lord Halifax considers that the simplest procedure would be for the The Under-Secretary of State Indiathe sum payable by His Majesty’s Government to be charged to the account kept by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Bushire with the Foreign Office as an advance on behalf of the Imperial Var Graves Commission, and for the Government of India’s share in the expenditure to be charged directly to them through the account of the political Resident at Bushire. No further adjustments would then be required. Lord Halifax would be glad to receive Lord Zetland’s observations on this point. 4. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Admiralty and the Imperial war Graves Commission. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,»I (E 2047/706/34) I OS Ho.^5 (111/5/381 ■ o' *■ r~\ h8 'BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN. 14th March, 1938, ? o My Lord V/lth reference to Mr* Seymour’s despatch No. 9 of the 13th January, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a despatch from the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf regarding the British Cemeteries at Henjam and Basidu. 2. It will be observed that Sir Trenchard Powle agrees that the work of inspection and maintenance can be done by the Assistant Engineer attached to His Majesty’s Consulate-General, and that the expenditure can most conveniently be charged direct to your Department in the accounts of His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate at Bushire. Subject to your approval, I would propose that arrangements should be made accordingly, reports regarding inspection and maintenance being submitted in the first instance to His Majesty’s Legation. 3. It has not yet been possible to obtain from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs any answer to the enquiries which have been made regarding the possibility of registering the two cemeteries. On the last occasion when these enquiries were renewed, the Head of the Third Political Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked whether it was certain that the cemeteries were the property The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax K.G., G.C.S.I., etc•, etc•, etc.property of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. I have found this question more difficult to answer than might have been expected. In the case of the other cemeteries maintained by the Imperial war Graves Commission in Iran, a title to the land has been acquired either by purchase, (as for instance at Hamadan) or by lease, (as at Kazvin). I .can, however, find no record of I any similar acquisition of title in the case of Henjam and Basidu. Basidu was never regarded as a British possession. Presumably therefore the land occupied was never owned by His Majesty’s Government or the Government I of India, and this would appear equally true of the cemetery I as of the rest of the area. The position in the case of Henjam would seem to be much the same. 4. During the correspondence regarding the evacuation of Henjam and Basidu in 1935, His Majesty’s Government were at pains to obtain an assurance from the Iranian Government that the two would be respected. This assurance was duly given. Nothing was said in the correspondence regarding the title to the land forming the two cemeteries, nor does there appear to be anything in Monsieur Kazemi’s note of the 8th April, 1935, and his subsequent letter to Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Kugessen of the 25th April (translations of which were enclosed in the flatter's despatches Nos. 159 and 187 of the llth April and the 2nd May, 1935, respectively) which could be construed as a recognition that the cemeteries are owned by His Majesty’s Government or the Government of India. I do not feel able to give the Ministry of Foreign Affairs a categorical assurance that the cemeteries are British property, for I cannot say on what exactly is based the title of His Majesty’s Government, if it exists. It seems possible that it may now be necessary to acquire a title,by purchase or lease. I do not think that the Iranian Government would make any difficulty over this, in return for a nominal payment. 5. I should he grateful if I might he furnished in due course with an expression of your views on this question. Meanwhile I am causing Monsieur Zanjani to he informed that, as far as I am aware, no one has ever question the ownership hy His Majesty^ Government of these cemeteries, which His Majesty's Legation have been instructed to register, hut that I must defer a final reply to his enquiry pending reference to your Department. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department and to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have etc., (Signed) Nevile Butler.Ho. 7/31/15 ..tiated the 12th February, 1938. Mr * ' Sir, With reference to your despatch No.4 (111/1/36) of the 13th January, 1938, I have the honour to state that no registration office has been opened in Bushire and from local enquiries it would appear that there is still no registration office in Bandar Abbas. 2. Since the evacuation of Henjam in 1935 no funds have been allotted by the Government of India for the maintenance of these cemeteries and as far as I know no inspections have been carried out by His Majesty’s Ships other than H.M.S. 'Bideford’s'* visit in 1936. 3.

TREASURY CHAMBERS 36 August, 1937 Sir, I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of Kis Majesty’s Treasury Mr. Rendel’s letter of 8th April, 1937, (S 1479/1479/34) concerning the future maintenance of the British cemeteries at Henjam and Basidu. In reply I am to transmit herewith a copy of correspondence with the Imperial War Graves Commission regarding the assumption by the Commission of responsibility for the maintenance of these cemeteries. I am to request you to inform the Secretary of State that My Lords agree to the charge to the Vote of the Imperial War Graves Commission of (a) a moiety of any incidental expenses (estimated not to exceed 100 rupees) incurred in connection with the registration in the name of the Commission of both cemeteries; (b) a moiety of any future expenditure on the upkeep of both cemeteries after their registration in the name of the Commission. I am, etc., (3gd.) P. Phillips The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.r f / 21st April, 1957. o') l i eo9 7 V. ' L, r ^ 7 Dear Slllar, I enclose a copy of a letter dated 8th April from the Foreign Office about the future maintenance of the British cemeteries at Henjam and Basidu. You have, I believe, had a copy of the Foreign Office letter of 16th October, 1936 to the India Office, to which this is the sequel. The position of the Treasury is as follows, (l) we agree that the interest of H«¥*G. in the cemeteries is such that we are prepared in the future to share with India the cost of maintaining both cemeteries. (2) The next question is whether these cemeteries should be registered in the name of the Oommission and maintained by you on behalf of H.M.G. on repayment out of Subhead S of the Imperial War Graves Commission Vote. I see that when Speed wrote to you about this on 27th November, 1935, he was in some doubt whether you were justified in talcing over these cemeteries. We have now got some more details about the identity of the persons buried at Henjam and Basidu (i.e. the particulars in the enclosure to Foreign Office letter of 16th October last to the India Office). On the information which we now have, it seems to me that, while the personnel buried in these cemeteries was largely Service personnel, they mostly died from natural causes and not in war. In these circumstances I feel some doubt whether it is right for you to undertake this task under your Supplementary Charter. This, however, I regard as being more for you to decide than for us. As far as coat goes there is nothing in it, since half the cost of maintenance falls on H.M.G. either way/ F.C. Sillar, 3sq., Imperial War Graves Commissionway - on Subhead g of your Vote if you take ower the cemeteries; on Foreign Office Votes if you do not. Finally I am not clear what practical difference is made by registering the cemeteries in the name of the Commission. X see from paragraph 2 of Foreign Office letter of 15th October to the India Office that the actual maintenance will remain in the hands of His Majesty’s representative in Tehran. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) &amp;.G. Compton.VY*G, 597 IMPSRIAL WAR GRAVE3 C0MMIS3I0N, 32, Groavenor Gardena, London, 3*W.l. 10th May 1937. Dear Compton, Your letter of 21st April regarding the British cemeteries at Henjam and Baaidu. I think the two material points are (1) whether the Commission ought to concern themselves with these cemeteries; and (2) what are the implications of registration of the cemeteries in the Commission^ name. As to (l), the Commission^ Supplemental Charter of 17th January 1924 (granted pursuant to Order in Council of 19th December 1923) does enable the Commission, in their discretion, to exercise their powers as regards burial places and memorials, even though unrelated to any war, w at the request of any Government of any part of Our Empire responsible for or desirous of* maintaining such burial places and 'provided that the cost of or incidental to any exercise of the additional powers given by this Our Charter be provided by the Government making the aforesaid request* 1 . I enclose a print of this Charter so that you can refer to it. We do not see any difficulty in principle on account of the 'request' in the present instance being a joint request by two Governments (the United Kingdom and India), though for practical purposes we should prefer it if we could look to one source for recoupment of the whole cost instead of collecting half from one source and half from another. As far as our discretion is concerned, we would be willing to act under our Charter, in the sense desired, on the basis which has been made clear, namely, that having no S*G. Compton, Ssq«, Treasury Chambers, agent/ Whitehall, 3.W.I.agent of our own on the spot, we can necessarily only operate in the matter through the Legation and Consuls, and cannot, therefore, assume responsibility independently of that essential assistance. As to (2), I explained to Speed that the registration in the Iranian Land Registries of the war cemeteries had been advocated as the best means of securing permanency of tenure. Registration of land, we understand is now compulsory in Iran, and presumably the land at Henjam and : a8idu would, in the normal course, be regiaterable in someone’s name. We imagine (though this has not been stated) that the Commission’s name has been suggested, in preference to that of H• k• Government, so that the Iranian Authorities should be the leas inclined to see in this step any derogation from H.tf. Government’s decision to relinquish these Stations. So far as we can see, the effect of registration in the Commission’s name would be that the Commission would be legally regarded as the owners of the land - always assuming, that is to say, that the Commission’s legal capacity to be registered as owners of these non—war cemeteries is recognised, a matter which appears to have been rather taken for granted - and in the event of the cemeteries being neglected and becoming a nuisance to adjoining owners, would presumably be liable, as also for defending the title to the land if that were ever assailed. Here, again, the Commission would in practice have to shelter behind the Legation as regards any practical steps to be taken, and behind the tt Govemments requesting” as regards providing any attendant costs. If, however, the Legation see an advantage in registration in the Commission’s name, provided the foregoing aspects of the matter are understood, we are prepared to fall in with the proposal. Yours sincerely. (3gd.) F.C. Sillar,(S 6022/1479/04) S. 40384. 10th June t 19^f.

(3) I am to request therefore, subject to Mr. Secretary Ede^s concurrence, that His Majesty’s Minister at Teheran may be requested to take the necessary steps to secure the registration of the two Cemeteries in the name of the Imperial War Graves Commission in the appropriate Iranian Land Registry. (4) Further, it would be appreciated if His Majesty’s Representative could make arrangements for the further maintenance of the Cemeteries and to notify the Commission of the date from which the arrangements will operate.

(5)/ The Under-Secretary of State Foreign Office S.W.l.(5) It will be understood from previous correspondence that the Commission will meet the expenses of the registration of the Cemeteries, and of their maintenance, and it is therefore suggested that His Majesty’s Representative in Teheran might recover this expenditure through his accounts with the Foreign Office in the usual way. (6) I am to add that the cost of the registration of the two Cemeteries has been estimated at a sum not exceeding 100 Rupees and that, as the Secretary of State is aware, the annual cost of maintenance has been estimated at 300 Rupees.

Sir, I am directed by the Imperial War Graves Commission to refer to Foreign Office letter No. E 3701/23/34 of the 25th July last and to acquaint jay you for the information of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare that the question of the British cemeteries at Hen jam and Basidu has formed the subject of unofficial correspondence between the Commission and His Majesty's Treasury. 2. I am to say that the Commission are anxious to give any assistance in their power in this matter, but they desire to point out that they have no agents whom they could charge with the maintenance of the cemeteries concerned, and that consequently they would have to rely on His Majesty's Minister in Tehran and on British consular officers in Persia or for any information that might be desired/for any j action that might be necessary. 3. The information supplied about these cemeteries and the nature of the graves which they contain is at present too meagre to enable the commission to judge what financial liabilities or other responsibi lities might be thrown on them in they vent of their accepting the charge. Further, as any such charge would be borne on a special vote to be provided from United Kingdom Funds, Treasury sanction would have to be obtained for the expenditure involved . C• #•••••••••• 2 (% 4 . In the circumstances, the Commission suggest, for the consideration of the Secretary of State , that His Majesty's Minister in Tehran he requested to furnish fuller information with regard to these cemeteries at Henjam and Basidu and the graves contained in them. The information which is needed is the size of the cemeteries, the number of graves, and the type of monuments - if any - elected uoon them and any other relevant particulars, ihe Commission understand that such fuller information would he required hy His Majesty's Treasury in order to enable them to decide whether to admit any consequential expenditure as a charge on ouhlic fund s. 5. Should the Secretary of State approve the course suggested and should he subsequently obtain the consent of the Treasury in the matter, I am to say that the Commission would be prepared to assume responsibility for the registration and maintenance of the cemeteries concerned if this could be done through the good offices of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran.

Department. s &gt; TA ! 7620 vV: Political Department . I cannot trace any papers in our registry which deal with the graves in Hen jam and. Basidu, but it may be that you have had. correspondence about them. Apparently the Government of India are paying for the upkeep of these graves and it looks as if they were content to continue to do so, if they have never raised the question themselves. How that their interest in the islands is less, however, they will probably meet the suggestion that the Imperial War Graves Commission and His Majesty’s Representative at Teheran should look after the graves with a request to be allowed to fade out of the picture themselves; and they will be able to argue in support of such a suggestion that to do so will save the introduction of what looks like an astonishingly cumbrous machinery. The Imperial War Graves Commission are already responsible for other British cemeteries in Persia and uniformity seems to be the one possible advantage to be gained from the present proposal. The matter is so trivial, however, that, unless the Political Department have other papers on the subject, I suggest we merely invite the views of the Government of India without any comments of our own. ‘'xf'khpp- ((U 4424 5000 1.36 P 2 , K * CtAWUcZ^ //ifohjJ k ^ ‘ ' i I q !L L.

R m -v f-&gt; Foreign Office. S.W.l. 15th October, 1936* S o r &gt; Aj * h I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to request you to inform the Marquess of Zetland that he has recently been in communication with the Imperial War Graves Commission and with His Majesty f s Representative at Tehran with regard to the future maintenance of the British cemeteries at Henjam and Basidu. 2. Lord Zetland will be aware that when the naval stations at Henjam and Basidu were relinquished in April 1935 the Persian Government gave an assurance that the cemeteries would be respected and facilities accorded for their maintenance by such persons as His Majesty T s Minister at Tehran might designate; and the most satisfactory method of ensuring that this maintenance is properly carried out in years to come v/ill be, in Mr. Eden T s opinion, to register the cemeteries in the name of the Imperial War Graves Commission, and to ask the Commission to accept the ultimate responsibility for their supervision, even though in practice they may have to rely upon His Majesty’s Representative in Tehran, with the help of His Majesty’s Consular Officers and perhaps of the naval authorities in the Persian Gulf, to carry out the actual details of administration. On this point he has consulted His Majesty’s Representative, who agrees that the registration and maintenance of the cemeteries could be carried out in this manner on behalf of/ The Under-Secretary of State, India Officeof the Commission, as in the case of other cemeteries in Persia. He has also consulted the Commission, to v/hom lists of the burials at the two cemeteries and blue-prints showing their dimensions have been supplied, and he understands that in principle they are willing that the cemeteries should be registered in their name and maintained by them on the conditions already indicated. 3. The Commission are, however, precluded from using their own funds for purposes not connected with the graves of persons killed in the Great War and they can only undertake to administer these cemeteries on the understanding that if they are to be involved in any consequential expenditure, this expenditure will be covered by funds placed specially at their disposal for the purpose. Mr. Eden understands in this connexion that the approximate annual cost of upkeep of the two cemeteries is at present about 100 rupees for Henjam and 200 rupees for Basidu, and he supposes that these sums have hitherto been paid by the Government of India. If this is so, all that seems to be required is that the existing arrangements should continue in force and that copies of the accounts relating to the cemeteries should in future be supplied to the Imperial War Graves Commission. In that case the Comraission will not be involved in any additional expenditure by reason of the cemeteries at Henjam and Basidu. 4. I am to express the hope that Lord Zetland will approve of the registration of the cemeteries in the name of the Imperial War Graves Commission on this basis, and that the Government of India will be willing to accept any incidental expenses incurred in connexion with the formalities of registration.5. Mr* Eden assumes that if the two cemeteries are eventually registered in the name of the Commission the Commission will doubtless wish to receive at regular intervals reports upon their maintenance and condition and vvill indicate in what form these reports should be furnished. Arrangements can then be made for these reports to be obtained and transmitted by His Majesty’s Legation in Tehran. 6. I am to add that His Majesty’s Representative has ascertained that there are about sixteen graves in the cemetery at Henjarn and thirty-one at Basidu, including a cement concrete monument. A list of the persons whose names are recorded on the graves and on the monument (similar to the lists already supplied to the Imperial War Graves Commission) is ; enclosed herewith^ but this 3.ist is not complete, since many of the graves bear no name plates. It will be seen that out of the ten recorded names at Henjam five ( including those of three children) appear to be those of persons connected with the Indo-European Telegraph Department and five (including No. 8, v/hich is doubtful) those of seamen of the Royal Navy or engineers employed in Fleet Auxiliaries, while out of the fifteen recorded names at Basidu twelve appear to be those of persons connected with the Honourable East India Company or the Indo-European Telegraph Department, and three those of seamen of the Royal Navy. 7.

We should much prefer to tell them in round terms that if they alter the inscription we should consider that they have flagrantly broken th6ir undertaking to respect and maintain the cemetery, and that we should regard the defacement of monuments of this kind as an act of vandalism. ven if they do not admit that Basidu was ever British they cannot deny that we occupied it for over 100 years; and if they want to save 'face' a notice outside the cemetery 0 suggested by Knatchbull-IIugessen would, one would think, be much more effective.

(E 4071/300/34) •British Legation Tehran 13th June # 1935 My dear George, Can you help rae to find a solution to the following problem which hardly seems to require official treatment but which I should like to see disposed of quietly? Some days ago Motamedy came up here, from Soheily, to discuss one or two matters, The last of these matters concerned the British Cemetery at Basidu. This cemetery has a monument to a number of members of the land and sea forces who lost their lives in the service of their country up to 1913, Underneath this inscription are the words M British Basidu”, Evidently the Mudir or some other official has been nosing round since our departure and hit on this, Motamedy represented to me that the word ”British in that context was 'blessant” and might arouse ill-feeling on the part of visitors. The Iranian Government had promised to respect and maintain the cemeteries and would certainly do so: they did not wish to do anything without our consent, but would I agree to the erasure of the word 'British” from the monument.and remote spot to convince him of the unlikelihood of its being frequented by tourists* I then said that Persia was a very ancient country, there must be lots of monuments and inscriptions indicating ownership by other Powers in the past* Were they going to alter the inscriptions at Bissitoun and Persepolis? Finally I said he had raised a delicate matter, as it was a matter of sentiment and might arouse unfortunate feelings on either side. I said I thought it most undesirable to tamper with the monument and suggested they should close the Cemetery except to the custodian and put a notice outside to the effect that it was closed on the departure of the British or on the return of Basidu to Persia by the British in 19o5. This should be quite easy as, if I remember right, there is a solid wall all round it. But I can induce neither Motamedy nor Soheily to accept this solution* The wounding word would still remain; they have never admitted that B&amp;sidu was British, and therefore both the word 'British' and the suggestion of our 'returning' Basidu to them are out of place. Knowing that our legal claim to Basidu was considered by the Law Officers to be more than weak I find it difficult to counter Schelly*s arguments. Possibly you may know of some precedent or can suggest some other solution. They have anyhow been frank about,it. They could have scratched it off and said nothing to us but Soheily refused to allow this. Yours ever, (Signed) H.M, Knatchbul1-Hugessen.A, .

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Excellency’s note of the 2nd April, 1935, to the effect that His Britannic Majesty’s Government have decided to relinquish forthwith the naval institutions in Henjam and Basidu. I have the honour to bring it to your Excellency’s notice that the Imperial Government view with pleasure the decision of His Majesty’s Government to relinquish the naval institutions in Henjam and Basidu, some of which were created in past days without the consent or agreement of the Iranian Government and of which the existence was incompatible with the present situation of the Imperial country and the good relations existing between the two countries. With regard to the cemeteries in Henjam and Basidu wherein Britishers are interred, I beg to assure your Excellency that they will remain protected and guarded and that the Imperial Government will issue appropriate instructions ensuring their maintenance. Owing to the fact that in the proclamation annexed to your Excellency’s note under reply allusions were made to Bahrein and to the relations between His Majesty’s Government and the sheikhs of the Arab coastal territories, I deem it necessary, without wishing at this juncture to embark upon discussion on these two questions, to reserve the right of the Imperial Government in connexion with Bahrein both for the present and for the future, and in connexion with the other question to invite your Excellency’s attention to the views of the Imperial Government, of which you have been informed on several occasions. / j PERSIA. * A May 7, 1935.

His Excellency read the note through twice, his face giving no indication whatever as to what he thought. Having done so, he asked me to tell him what these bases consisted of, as I had visited them and he had not. I explained that at Hen jam there were buildings, canteen, gear, stores and fuel, and that nowadays there existed very little at Basidu beyond the flagstaff (which would be removed) and certain buildings. I added that at Basidu one of the buildings was used as a kind of court, as we had for more than a century possessed certain administrative rights over the inhabitants. 3. M. Kazemi then assumed a pleased expression and remarked that he regarded our decision as a step forward in improving Anglo-Iranian relations. He would probably have to send me a written answer in regard to the latter part of the communique, but he could not do so until the Cabinet had been consulted. 4. I was slightly relieved by his Excellency’s reception of the note, as I had feared that, following some tortuous mental process, he would have endeavoured to accuse His Majesty’s Government of having violated the status quo. He, however, made no mention whatever of the status quo, but went on to deal with the more general Gulf questions reported in my telegram No. 122. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, to the hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Naval Commander-in-chief, East Indies, and to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division. Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen to Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. M. le Ministre, Tehran, A pril 2, 1935. I HAVE the honour, under instructions from His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to inform your Excellency that His Majesty’s Government have decided, for reasons of administrative convenience, to transfer their naval stations in the Persian Gulf to the Arab coast and that, in consequence, they are taking immediate steps to relinquish their establishments at Hen jam and Basidu. A communique stating this fact and outlining the reasons for this decision is being issued on the Arab coast. For the simultaneous information of the Iranian Government, I have the honour to enclose herewith the text of this communique^ 1 ) 2. The stores in the depots and portable property generally will be removed as soon as possible, but His Majesty’s Government will hand over the buildings to the local Iranian authorities, who will be free to make whatever use of them they wish. 3. As your Excellency is aware, there exist both at Basidu and at Hen jam British cemeteries. His Majesty’s Government feel that they can rely upon the CONFIDENTIAL. PERSIA. April 23, 1935. Section 1.

K.1727/300/34 dated 16th Larch, on the subject of th» cemeteriee at Basidu, I write to say that, so far as we can ascertain, there are no war graves there. It may prove, therefore, that the Imperial \»ar Graves Commission have no authority to take it over, and in these circumstances it seems to us that probably the simplest plan would be for the naval authorities in the Gulf to pay periodical visits for the purpose of keeping the cemetery in good repair. The visits necessary for this purpose would be covered by an arrangement similar to that envisaged in the last two lines of the draft telegram enclosed with your letter under reference - i.e., without specific mention of the havy. We note that in your draft telegram you suggest that Knatchbull Hugeseen should virtually confine himself to expressing the expectation that the Persian Government will respect the cemetery, etc. We feel here that it would ....... H.L. Baggallay, 'sq.would be more consistent with the attitude we have always publicly maintained in the past, namely, that Basidu is British, to express aur requirements as a condition of the transfer, i.e., something to which we are entitled in return for the surrender of a substantial asset. This is the form taken by Article V of the draft treaty which Knatchbull Hugessen in his telegram ho.94 now suggests we should follow. W© understand that there is also a cemetery at Henjam, but there is no record in the Admiralty or at the Imperial War Graves commission (from whom we have made enquiries) of either naval or war graves there. It is probably R.I.N. We suggest that it should be treated on exactly the same basis as the cemetery at Basidu. I am sending a copy of this letter to Laithwaite. **• A.

Would you like us to do this or would you prefer to do it yourself in consultation with Seal. 3. If it should turn out that the naval authorities in the Gulf are the only practicable authority, it will, we think, be better not to stress this fact when making our arrangements with the Persians.

I may add that the names of officials who died after their retirement from service have not been shown in the list, e.g., the names of Messrs.

Similarly Dr. Odling’s name has been omitted as he died after he left the Department on 1st June 1900. Mr. R.H.New as well as the two infant sons of Mr.Howson reported by Khorasan, have also been omitted as both Mr. New and Mr. Howson were transferred to the Foreign and Political Department for serviceservice in Birjand and Sistan, respectively.

(C^ Description of Enclosure.With p#ferenow to your despatch Nos. 32 of January 21st # 1933 (K 623/523/234) and 240 of June 14th, 1933 (K 6831/523/234) respecting the graves of former members of the Indo-iSuropean Telegraph Department in Persia, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith:- (1) a list of burials in the Armenian Church of St* Bartholomew in Tehran, (2) a list of burials in the Akberabad (Protestant) Cemetery at Tehran, - (3) a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Consul- General for Khorasan covering the Meshed, Birjand and Zahedan areas, (4) a copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Consul- General for Khorasan covering the dlstan area, (5) a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman covering the Kerman area and the coast of the Persian Gulf eastwards from Basldu, (6) a copy of a despatch from the Acting Consul at Shiraz covering the Yezd, Isfahan and Shiraz areas, — ( 7 ) a copy of a despatch from the Honourable the political Resident at Bushire covering the Bushire area and the coast of the Persian Gulf eastwards from Bushire. His Majesty's Consuls at Ahwaz and Kermanshah report that no graves are known to exist in their districts. 2. The list of burials in the Armenian Church has /been The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office.been extracted from the full list sent to you in my despatch Wo. 182 of the 23rd March, 1933. For the list of burials in the Akbarabad cemetery I am indebted to Mr. R.L. Steiner, of the American Mission, who has kindly searched the cemetery records. So far as I am aware there are no other recorded graves In^Tehran consular district, unless a Ma^or Maxwell 'Irlandais 1 * who died on December 1st, 1894, and was buried the following day in the Roman Catholic Cemetery at Doolab, was a member of the Department. It will be remembered, however, that on page 153 of Volume I of **Eastern Persia, Isyo—ISTS* 1 Major Euan Smith tells the story of the Telegraphs Sergeant at Kum who could not purchase a plot of ground for the burial of his c/iilci owing to the fanaticism of the inhabitants. I fancy thab there may be numerous similarly unrecorded graves dating from the early days of the Department. Moreover, there appears to W be no record of the burial of Quarter Master sergeant Bonier, who died in Tehran in about 1873, as recorded on page 389 of the same volume. It is also believed that Sergeant S.H.P. Glover, who is not mentioned in any list, died in Persia, where many of his descendants are still living. 5 . The Political Resident and His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman have both furnished information regarding the graves at J&amp;sk, Henjam and other places on the coast of the Persian Gulf, but as the information is often complementary, both lists will repay study. 4 # as regards the despatch from the Acting Consul at Shiraz, I should explain that ay circular despatch Ho. 13 communicated to His Majesty’s Consular officers the information collected from former members of the Department and sent to me in your despatch Ho. 240 of June 14th (K 6831/523/234). The Sergeant McIntyre mentioned by Mr. Gamble was, as he surmises, buried in Tehran, and so- 3 - was Mr* BaaTord (sea AMbarebad list)* There is no traee of the burial of Sergeant O’Connor. 6. I presume that a full list of the members of the Department who died or lost their lives while serving in Persia* with dates and plaees, ean be compiled from the official records in India. Ihe archives of the l^epartment left with His Majesty’s Legation in March* 1931, relate to political subjects only* although Colonel Mallock's report and history of the Department from 1863 - 1888 gives lists of the staff in the latter year* and mentions in at least one place (page 43) (without giving names) the deaths of two officers killed in the course of their duty. If a complete list could be sent me it might suggest further lines of enquiry as to the position of the graves* but it will of course be practically impossible at this state to include members of the families of officers of the Department dying in Persia* or those officers who died in Persia after leaving the Department's service. In any case* if a list of graves is compiled from the information forwarded with this despatch and other sources* 1 should be glad if I might receive a copy. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (Mo. 40), to the Honourable the Politleal resident at Bushire (No. 33)* to His Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorasan (No. 17), to His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman (No. 2), and to His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz (No. 2).

Another grave has come to light in Tehran, that of a Mrs. Graves, v/ho is buried in the Armenian Church of St. George. The stone is in the middle of the floor of the Church and usually covered by a carpet; the inscription reads as follows Sacred to the memory of Victoria wife of Edward Graves with departed this life March 6th 1877 aged 31 years” and is repeated in Armenian. Mrs. Graves was the wife of one of the H.C.O 1 ©. of the Royal Engineers who came to Persia in the early days of the Department. Graves and two of his colleagues McIntyre and McGowan, married three sisters belonging to an Armenian family of Julfa, Isfahan.

Shiraz 27th April 1933 Dear Mr. Robertson, Many thanks for your letter of April 13* I at once set out to make enquiries and found that Dr. Stuart had passed your letter on to the Consulate. I visited the Consulate and found that the matter of I.E.T.D. graves was being taken in hand there, but that they had had a letter from the Legation, asking them to make their returns direct to the Legation at Teheran, fter an interval of six months during which reports of individual members of the I.E.T.D. would be collated. The Consulate here certainly is making efficient enquiries, and will be sending in a full return to Teheran in due course, including, I believe, information about a grave at Ahadel or Deh Bid. In our present British Cemetery, or 1 should call it ’’Christian Cemetery”, there is only one I.E.T.D. grave that of Captain Adolf Fredrick Wittkugel, South Persia Rifles, 15 February 1917, situated thus:- Cemetery ground plan n 1 — 1 ' i 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 i i m r— T i E his grave is in this corner.

The Cemetery is, as you will remember, approximately 30 yards x 22 in size divided down the middle by a path. Europeans have been buried for the most part on the right of the path as one enters, and Armenians on the left hand side. The I.E.T.D. graves are as follows.- Mrs. Robertson Alfred Thomas Roberton Mrs.Caroline Sarah Blackman Edith Blackman E.J. Blackman Humbertzun son of Simoniantz (These were both Son of Ter Jacob employees of I.E.T.D) There are in addition eleven other graves of Armenians, at least half of whom must have been in I.E.T.D. This will give you sufficient information. I think. The Cemeterv is being looked after as far as possible, and I believe^Mr. Eldridge is getting together a fund to enable it to be maintained in good condition permanently. tires easily.

But it has just occurred to me that when I was out on construction between Gwadur and Charbar in 1917» with Superintendent Cane, that officer pointed out to me a cairn of some sort which, if I remember aright, marked the burial place or the place where he died of a Mr. Graves - I think that was the correct name - who had been murdered by Baluch tribesmen some years before. If you have not already full information regarding this incident, I opine you could obtain details from one of the older hands; I had scarcely a year’s service when I was out on line with Mr. Cane, and my own recollection of what he told me is but hazy.

KERMAN BETTY MARGARET DORMER (Infant daughter of the undersigned) Born 8 th November,1921 died 6 th June,1922. Interred in a grave under the west wall of the English Cemetery at Kerman. Grave is distinguishable by its inscribed white marble cross on plinth - white marble surround and marble chips. In the same cemetery is, I believe, the grave of a child of the late E.M.CHASE. SEISTAN BERNARD GORDON HICKS. whose death from pneumonia occurred, I believe, in the Autumn of 1916 . Huried in the small English Cemetery in the grounds of the British Consulate,Seistan. DEHBEED. There are the graves of two children of H.A.S.NAVARRA, and at A3ADEH. the graves of two men believed to have been members of the Depot but whose names I have forgotten. I understand, however, that mention has been made of the graves of DEHBEED AND ABADEH by Mr.A.L.Robertson with whom I have been in communication. As regards other graves in Persia I regret that my knowledge about them is so scanty as to be worthless for the purpose required.

Dear Sir, I beg to thank you for your letter of the 9 th ultimo in reference to which I regret to say that I have no personal knov/ledge of isolated graves of members of the I.E.T.D. in Persia. The Imperial War Graves I understand dealt with the removal of the remains of the late Mr. Blackman from Saidabad to Kerman. I understand that Mrs. Blackman died and was buried in Yezd as also was Mrs. Robertson whose husband no doubt has given you full particulars. One or two children of Mr. Navarra died and were buried in Dehbid, but perhaps Mr. Navarra himself has given you information on this point. The Shiraz Cemetery in which Mr . Wittkugal is interred is definitely located and under the charge of H.M’e C onsul. I am afraid that I cannot give you any more useful information than the foregoing and I apologise for having delayed my reply to your letter but this was due to illness and consequently unavoidable.

January 301k» 1933* Sir, At long last your letter G.133.7.2. dated the 9 th instant has reached me here. The grave of MR. ALOF WITTKUGEL is in the cemetery at Shiraz. Mr. Wittkugel was shot while leading a charge of the South Persia Rifles in 1917 or 1918. I believe there are at least two other graves of members of the Department in the Old Cemetery at Shiraz, but I cannot now recall their names. They were before my time, but I suggest that Dr. Carr, formerly of the C.M.S. and at one time Departmental Medical Officer at Shiraz might know them. The grave of Mr.B.G.Hicks is in Sistan. Hicks died in 1914. I believe the grave is alongside that of Mr.Norman Smith of the Imperial Bank of Persia, who died a year or so previously. Outside the Telephone Hut at Knoar Takhteh is the grave of Sergt. COX. Cox was not a member of the Department, but came to Persia with the South Persia Rifles. When that Force was disbanded he opened a Garage ir. Shiraz. He was ^iot dead while taking a passenger from Bushire to that City in October, 1924 . The above particulars are given in case it is desired to record his grave also. I am, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, (3GD) W.E.HUXLEY.

As far as I know, the only graves that are unattended are those of Sergt. Hockey at Ahadeh and Mrs. Neame at Sivand. Regarding these I was careful to get an assurance from H.E. Kasim Sur Asraf II the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, that due care, attention and respect would be accorded. To the best of my knowledge and belief all isolated graves in the Pars Province were removed into Shiraz.

Sir, In replying to your G.133. 7. 2. of the 9th January 1933, which has just found me, I have the honour to inform you that I have been a witness to the following deaths and burials:- Mr. Jackson, General Service Clerk, died of Typhoid in the year 1901 or 1902, and was buried at Jask, Persian Gulf; Mr. C.J. Smith, Superintendent, died of Cholera in 1918, and was buried at Kerman; Mr. Blackman, Superintendent, died of Cerebitis at Saidabad in 1917, and was cremated there but his ashes were interred in the graveyard at Yezd. I had noticed some graves in the old cemetery at Shiraz. As far as I know, they contain the remains of*Mr. Neam, Mr. Roche, Sergeant O'Connor and, possibly, a Mr. Bamford. ^£w-o &amp;lLu There is a grave in the back compound of the Telegraph Office at Abadeh, Persia, containing the remains of a former member of the Telegraphs but I cannot recall the name. If you require this name and other particulars I could make enquiries from old Armenian members of the Staff at Isfahan. There is a grave at Nasretabad, Seistan, of Mr. D. Hicks, General Service Clerk. Particulars of this could be obtained from the Consul at Siestan as Mr.Hicks was attached to the Consulate at the time. There are also graves at Isfahan which I believe belong to former members of the Department, such as Holzel, Mackentire, Glover, etc. If particulars are required of these I could, most probably, obtain them from the Armenian Church records at Julfa, Isfahan.

In the back compound of the building which was occupied by the Department, there are either one or two (two I believe) headstones which were erected to the memory of members of the Department towards the end of the last century.

Walton, Sir laurice Simpson called here on Friday, and December, to discuss the question of the graves of members of the Indo-European Telegraph Department in Persia. It will be remembered that the Government of India have recently agreed to make a grant of £50 towards the upkeep of the Cemetery at Yezd, where some former members of the Department (as well as other Europeans) are buried. Sir i&gt;*aurice Simpson was chiefly anxious that some record should be preserved of existing graves and of their location. When this information had been collected further consideration could, he suggested, be given if necessary to the question whether in any specific case financial provision should be made for upkeep and whether such provision should be made by Goverrment or by a collection from members of the Department, etc. 2 . I said that I thought there -was not much prospect of any substantial financial assistance - if any - from Government, and enquired how he thought we could best deal with the collection of information. He/ ^1 — THe suggested that the High Commissioner might he asked to circularize retired members of the Department, inviting them to furnish any infonnation they coulo as to the whereabouts of graves. No serious difficulty arose in the case of big cemeteries such as Tehran, etc. but there were certain to be a number of scattered graves at various points in Persia for the upkeep of which in all probability no effective steps could be taken, but the existence of which it was desirable to record. 3 # we might perhaps accept Sir kaurice Simpson's suggestion, and, subject to the Under Secretary’s approval and to Sir Maurice Simpson’s concurrence in its terns, write to the High Commissioner suggesting the issue of a notice on the lines of the attached draft. We might alse ask the Government of India and the Foreign Office to ask ConsuJa r Officers in Persia to give such assistance as they can in the matter? 4 .

We appreciate very greatly all that you have done to secure an endowment for the upkeep of the Cemetery. Since the Indo-European Telegraph Department was wound up, we have found it difficult out of local resources to maintain it as we would wish, as there are now so few Europeans here to contribute, and an annual donation from everyone of us was more or less obligatory, and this became rather a burden. We have, however, carried out a number of repairs at different times, and also kept the water supply going all along though the question of cutting off the water supply did arise, when we found it difficult to get the necessary funds together. Now that a sufficient income for the upkeep of the Cemetery will be forthcoming, you may be sure that we shall maintain the place in excellent condition, and next Spring I shall have all necessary repairs carried out. With the renewed thanks of the English community in Yezd for your very kind interest and help. Yours sincerely, Sgd. (Rev.) R.N.

The present British Colony in Yezd consists only of a few Missionaries and one man in the Bank, so they find themselves unable to keep the Cemetery in repair and pay for the water necessary to keep the trees alive. The expenses are not great and I am trying to raise a capital sum of £150., which would be placed in Trust with the Church Missionary Society in London and the investment income remitted annually to Yezd. The Bank has subscribed £50. and several friends have sent me donations. As Mr. and Mrs. Blackman of the India Government Telegraphs Department are buried there, it occurs to me that the India Office might be glad of the opportunity of assisting to keep the place in order. I believe that only one Missionary is buried there as compared with 2 Indian Government and 2 Bank Members (ladies), so we are the chief occupants at present and I feel we should see the place is properly cared for. Unless help is forthcoming on the lines suggested from this side the place will go to rack and ruin, which I do not care to contemplate. My reason in approaching you is to ask if you would be good enought to pass my letter on to the proper channel, with your blessing added, if you feel able. With kind regards.

I am informed that in pre-war days the plot of land (about i acre in extent) was situated outside the town limits and the cemet&amp;ry was kept up by the British &amp; Russian Consulates. The town has since extended and the graveyard is now surrounded by buildings. After the cemetery had been used for some years one Mirza Khurshed Khan, claimed the lard. It was pointed out that the graveyard had existed for many years and he had never previously made any claim. He, however, endeavoured to insist on payment for the land. Shortly afterwards his ov:n son fell seriously ill and was attended by 1* Major MacGregor, Medical Officer, Sistan. 2. Dr. Mohamed Beg^Vice-Consul, Birjand. 3. Dr. Voldimiroff, Russian doctor at Birjand. These three medical officers sent a statement of their fees and suggested that after deducting the value of the land the iMfclance sn^uld be paid to them. The result of this was that the claim to the value of the land was dropped and the fees of the medical officers were never paid. The claimant has sixi-we died. The cemetery is surrounded by barbed wire. The gate has been removed and the graves are in a bad state of repair. The graves are those of 1. The Russian Military Attache’ at Sistan who/2. Two children of Mr. ftowson, then His Majesty’s Vice-Consul Birjand who died in 1911. One grave. 3. A Russian Cossack died 1915. 4. Mr. Rowland Hill, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Birjand died 1916. 5.

I have the honour to request instructions as to whether this Consulate should assume responsibility for the maintenance of the graveyard, which is the only Christian bur^ial ground available and if so from what source funds could be provided for. 1.

I am directed by the Marquess Curzon of Kedleston to transmit to you, to be laid before Viscount Peel, the accompanying copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran relative to the proposed creation of a Church of England chaplaincy in Tehran. 2. The need for such a- chaplain in Tehran has been represented to this department by successive British ministers in Persia of recent years. In 1914 the suggestion was made that His Majesty’s Government should contribute four hundred pounds per annum towards the salary necessary to maintain the incumbent, but reasons of economy rendered it impossible to agree to the proposal. The question V again came up in the year 1920 and the idea had again to be abandoned for the same reason. 3. Lord Peel will observe, however, that the proposal now put forv/ard by Sir P. Loraine involves only the grant of fifty pounds per a.nnum and as the needs of the British colony at Tehran, (numbering approximately one hundred a.nd ten persons) are nov; no less than they have been at any previous time, it would certainly be a very great benefit if a chaplain could be appointed; and a small contribution from His Majesty’s Government would show that they were mindful of the welfare of the colony, of whom the banking and mercantile...

The principal object of your visit was in connection with the establishment of a British Chaplaincy in Tehran. I know that for a long time it has been your keen desire that there should be a chaplain here and I feel sure that one result of your visit to us has been to convince you that there is a largo and Important body among the ;n lish ' people in Tehran who are in entire sympathy with your views and are anxious to have amongst them a Minister of their National lot blished Church. It Is hardly necessary for me to reiterate my cordial agreement with this view. Grateful as we are as a community to our American cousins for the kindness they have shown during a long period of years in proviuing servi.oes lor in the American Mission Church and for the friendly interest which the Ministers of their 3£K±±xi&amp;n Mission have taken in the spiritual welfare of the British community, we nevertheless feel thuo in the capital of a friendly state, where Mis Majesty’s Goverriment maintain a considerable diplomatic representation The ;ht reverend J. .Linton D.T), Bishop in Persia, Isfahan.11 - .

It will thus be seen that complete agreement existed on the principle of creating a Chaplaincy, and the only difficulty was that of providing ways and means such as would render it possible for the incumbent to imi i at a In his position -ith suitable dignity and becoming freedom from material anxiety, You are Mare that in the dpring’of 1922 a general meeting of the British community was held under my chairmanship at which it was decided (1) to form a Branch in Tehran of the j-ersia Diocesan association (2) to appoint a Committee, with certain terms of reference, to study and report on the question of appointing and suitably maintaining a Chaplain. The question was not free from difficulty principally because the community is a small one, mimering appreciably less th n 100 people, * and is mostly composed of persons of very moderateme^na. She problem was reduced by the Oommittoe so far as possible to reckouable terras, but no definite proposals could be formulated until wo ciuld have the benefit of your personal advice and experience, not trace the cause of the discussions which ensued 'after your arrival, as these will still be fresh in your memory*: it will suffice to say that thanks to certain grants on which you are able tofsount and to the prospect of liberal contributions irom various dministrations and companies held out by their representatives in Tehran, we have fair hopes of being able to assure the maintenance, housing: and bravelling expenses on a five years 1 experimental appointment of a British Chaplain. for this result, which 1 , I think, as satisfactory as our most confident hopes could n&amp;icipate, we are indebted to the impetus and encouragement given so devotedly by yourself and .rchdeacon Biddlecombe to our deliberations, to the generous help held out by the representatives of the British institutions already mentioned, and to the support ofjithe English residents in Tehran as a body. Our project seems thus to be on a fair way to realisation and I look forward to the day when you -ill be able to revisit us for the purpose of inducting the first British Chaplain in Tehran.o. i Ir. .ioraine's Dospstoh So. of the bfh pril 19^^.

SECRETARY TO THE COMMITTEE. Mr. W. J. Downer, Office of Works.REPORT. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORDS COMMISSIONERS OF HER MAJESTY’S TREASURY. My Lords, 1. We, the Committee appointed by yonr Lordships to inquire into the question of the public expenditure on British Cemeteries or individual graves or monuments in foreign countries or British Colonies, beg leave to present to your Lordships our Report. 2. Our instructions were conveyed in a circular letter, dated 24th August 1888, addressed to the various Departments represented on the Committee (see Appendix), and were to the following effect:— “ My Lords are anxious that the several Departments concerned, viz., the Foreign Office, Colonial Office, Admiralty, War Office, and Works, should in concert with this Department (i.e., the Treasury), arrive at a common policy in dealing with such charges (i.e., charges in connexion with the maintenance of Cemeteries abroad), and especially should, if possible, agree to place some definite term on the duration of certain of them, if not of all.” By a further letter, dated 21st December 1888 (see Appendix) your Lordships communicated to the Departments concerned the names of the gentlemen who had been nominated to serve on the Committee. 3. We have excluded from our consideration, as not coming within the scope of our inquiry, Cemeteries at British naval and military stations, such as Malta and Gibraltar. Such Cemeteries form a recognised part of the Establishment of the stations, and the expense incidental to their care and maintenance is regularly provided for in the Estimates of the Admiralty and the War Office. We think that in this category must of necessity continue to be classed for the present the Cemeteries at Cairo and Alexandria, the existence of which is due to the British occupation of Egypt, and which are used in connexion with our garrison in that country. So long as this occupation shaH continue the maintenance of the burial grounds in question will, we conceive, remain, as now, a charge upon Army Votes. We think, however, that on the with drawal from Egypt of Her Majesty’s Forces some arrangement should be made with the Egyptian Government under which that Government might undertake the care and maintenance of the Cemeteries. Failing such an arrangement, their care would of course devolve upon Her Majesty's Govern ment in the same way as that of other burial grounds, which owe their origin to the operations of war, and which are dealt with in paragraph 13 of our Report. The Cemetery at Suakin, which is used for civil as well as military interments, and in respect of which special arrangements have been made, stands on a different footing, and has been classed by us with the Cemeteries treated of in paragraph 9. 4. There remain for consideration Cemeteries other than those existing at British naval and military stations, viz., those in— I. British Colonies; and II. Foreign Countries. 5. No questions appear to have arisen in respect of (I.) Colonial Cemeteries, and we do not think it necessary therefore to make any recommendation concerning them. We think that they may be left, as now, to local care. The graves of the officers and men who fell in the Zulu War of 1879 have hitherto been maintained out of Imperial funds; as, however, the territory of Zululand has been constituted a British Colony, we are of opinion that their care should now be delegated to the Colonial Government. The charges A 24 in connexion with them have hitherto not exceeded 4L per annum, and have been in respect of wages paid to the native caretakers of the graves of those who fell in the engagements at Kambula, Inhlobana Mountain, and Isandhlwana. 6. The Cemeteries in (II.) &gt;Foreign Countries may be classified under three ^ heads, viz.:— (a.) Civil. (b.) Military. (c.) Naval. (a.) Civil Cemeteries. 7. Cemeteries under this head are by far the most numerous. In the majority of cases their existence results from the action of Biitish residents abroad, who, not being permitted to bury their dead in the Cemeteries belonging to the general community, or desiring to possess separate burial grounds for their own nationality or religion, have provided burial places of their own. Such action has occasionally been taken in conjunction with residents belonging to other nationalities. In other cases Cemeteries which are now used for civil interments date their origin from the time when our troops were employed in, or in occupation of, the country, as at Scutari and the Ionian Islands. 8. As a general rule the Cemeteries treated of under this head were established °and have been subsequently maintained without recourse to pecuniary aid from Her Majesty’s Government; but exceptions to this rule have frequently occurred, and such aid has been granted, either towards the cost of purchase, or of maintenance, or of both, the principle of such assistance having been recognised and defined by sections 10 and 11 of the Consular Act of 1825 (6 Geo. IV. c. 87). In practice, however, it may be remarked, the provisions of the enactment have not been treated as mandatory, grants and the refusal of grants having been determined with reference rather to the special circumstances of the case than to the Act. 9. Frem a general review it appears to us that the time has arrived when all Government grants in aid of Cemeteries exclusively used for civil inter ments should cease, with the exception of some two or three in regard to which obligations have been entered into in common with other Governments, and that sections 10 and 11 of the Consular Act of 1825, so far as they relate to the question under consideration, should be repealed. In the case of Cemeteries for which Her Majesty’s Government has accepted title-deeds or pecuniary i esponsibility, we are of opinion that arrangements should be made, w'hen the circumstances admit of it, for vesting the property in a Committee representing the British community of the place, and that such Committee should in future be entirely responsible for the care and main tenance of the Cemetery, and should have power to levy burial fees or to make such other charges as may be found expedient or practicable. 10. We append a list of grants now made annually, notice to terminate which, at the end either of this or of the next financial year might, we think, be given forthwith, viz.:— £&gt; St. Domingo - - - * 20 Tripoli - - - - - 5 Tunis - - - - - 5 11. As already stated, where obligations have been entered into in common with other Governments, it may not be possible to act upon the above recommendations (par. 9) ; but the cases of this kind are very few. So far as we have been able to ascertain, the following are the only Civil Cemeteries to which an international character attaches : Athens, Barcelona, Jeddah, and Tangier.V p. 8. p. 27 6 scale, that your Lordships’ sanction would be required. Any application for authority to spend more money should be accompanied by an explanatory statement showing the manner in which the ordinary yearly grant had been exhausted. It is suggested that it would probably be con venient to provide for this expenditure under such a head as the “ Works ” vote in the Navy Estimates, as it is thought that if a special sub-head were raised for the purpose, such a course might lead to the expenditure of the maximum amount every year. General. 18. In the Appendix to our Report we give a Return, compiled from the archives of the Foreign Office and the Office of Works, embodying all available information respecting British Cemeteries abroad. We believe this Return to be fairly exhaustive, and we think it may be useful for purposes of future reference to place it on record. Attached to it is a Summary classifying each Cemetery under one or other of the various heads which we have adopted in our Report. For the sake of convenience we have added to this Summary a column in which mention is made of any matter which seems to us to call for special remark or recommendation. 19. Papers relating to current questions, which have arisen in the case of Cemeteries at Monte Video, Athens, Scutari, the South African Republic, and other places, which your Lordships have caused to be referred to us in connexion with this inquiry, have been duly considered by us, and in returning such papers to your Lordships we have made thereon such observations and recommendations as seemed to us appropriate. We have the honour to be, My Lords, Your Lordships’ obedient Servants, C. W. FREMANTLE. CLEMENT LI. HILL. AUGUSTUS W. L. HEMMING. G. B. BLOUNT. G. E. GROVER. W. J. Downer, H. W. PRIMROSE.
