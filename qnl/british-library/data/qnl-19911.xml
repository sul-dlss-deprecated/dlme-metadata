To Phe Foreign Secretary to the &lt;&gt;overnxa«nt of India in the Poreiga and Political Departme/it. Judicial as 3i^tant for Bahrain eir 1 have the honour to address you in amplification of my telegram Ho. 733 dated 3Cth July 1923. In a let&amp;er to me dated July 25th, which ie rather too long to be quoted verbatim, Major Daly urged that «inoe t^e proposal to appoint a J'odicial Assistant w^s first mooted several changes have occurred which tend to modify the situation. The first essential of the Reforms is that the Bahrain state finances should be able to bear the expenditure f and at first no difficulty was anticipated in this respect. Recently however the financial position has not been so favourable. CurtomE receipts have dropped from i« 9c ,CCC/- to below &amp; 40,000/— in the la^t month, and it appear? that this is likely to continue till the end of the pearling season. On the other hand unavoidable and unforeseen expenditure, including large borrowings by Phaikh Isa and a number of old debts , hap had xaaL to be f «oed . &amp;ajor Daly expresses the hope that it will be possible to pay off these debts by next cold weather, and Keep the state solvent. But fear the meantime great cauticn and scrupul ous economy are in his opinion nec^essary . Fhaikh Hamad hat already undertaken to bear the cost of an official to put the Gustos® in order ; and this it is hoped will bear fruit in the shaie of better receipts . When the Customs have2 been oriaeJ , arid t'mfliia.aces have a credit balance it» will 'tiiea b® triBte to take th® next Btep in tn® outs irrogramae. and that he puggeets , should be a survey to enable a Department for t he registration of property to be set -up. a rel or a to which Shaikh Ea&amp;ad attaches greater importance than anything else , as without a record of land , boats and rights , no proposals for equalization of taxation can use fully be Initiated . When the registration of property bap been carried out t many probleas may be expected to arise &lt; which will require expert legal handling. And it is at this stage that Major Daly suggests/the services of a judicial expert nay be enlisted to advise Phaikh Hmad on how to tackle this problea, how to establish a better court to deal with cases among Bahrain rubjecte , and so on. Phis will b^, it is anticipated f in 6 or 8 months from now. By then, Shaikh Hamad will probably be only too willing to accept the deputation of a Judicial ofiic^r ol experience. At present he would , Vnjor Daly thinks , re gard any pucn proposal with disfavour quite apart from the question of its cost. For he has recently est^blisned a court of his own in which he taker some pride and interest - which is all to the good - and he would be certain to res- ent the introduction of an outsider as an interference with his prerogatives . Major Daly adds that so far as bis own f work ie concerned he does not require the assistance of a Judicial officer at present. 'Phe 'heavy rush ol work he had at the beginning in helping Shaikh Hamad to straight n out the financial tangle is over*, and Judicial work i~ always light in the pearling reason. fhese various arguments have uhdoubt^u weifjht : and , as I said in my telegram of the 3Cth July , 1 Am prepared to surrender my opinion and to withdraw my re commendation for the appointment of a British Judicial Assistant . Later on when the time is ripe , Major Daly will3 vdll no doubt asK tor tn« loan of a jodioial adviser for a snort period oa behalf of Shaikh E^mad . It will then fall to ay succeseor to lay th&lt;» facts before the Oovernaent of India. I have the hoao-ur to be, ?ir, lour jaost obedient servant, Sd/- S . G.

To The Political Agent, Bahrain . fir , I have the honour to aoKncwledge the receipt your memorandum Ho. 1C7-C dated 22nd August 1923 on the subject of allowances for the Al Khalifeh. I fully sym pathize with the difficulties with which you and Shaikh Eamaii are faced in xhese very necessary reductions of ex travagant expenditure but feel myself bound to enter a pro test against drawing on the surplus in hand from collections on outstanding dues to the CuBtoms , and should have pre ferred the reduction of allowances all round when it was found that the monthly revenues were running low. It may not be advisable to allow recurring charges on the Civil List to fluctuate from month to month but the experience of a full gear's income will shortly no doubt enable you to reduce such recurring charges to their proper proportion. Such payments , however , as are alluded to in tne closing paragraph of your letter , should at once be cut ott with the utmost rigour when the monthly revenues are unable to meet the charge. 1 think 1 may safely take upon myself the respon sibility of assuring both Shaikh Hamad and yourself that no intercessions by His Highness the Sultan of 'ejd in favour of H&amp;k.Shaikn 'Isa will have the smallest influence onon myselt , the Governruent oi Ixidia or Hi&amp; Majesty's Govern ment , and I pee no objection whatever to your letting tbls be generally known in any quarter in whicn you think it likely to fee useful.

If you could do anything to help us in the matter by instructions to the officers serving under you I shall be most grateful. Bahrain, as no doubt you know, and the Political Agent points out in his memorandum, is cursed with a number of idle young Fhaikhlings who have nothing whatever to do and whose useful employment is one of the most difficult problems that we have to deal with in those islands . If you could go a little further and convey a 'little word' to Lis Majesty King Faisal, that would be even more effective . 1 do not Puppoae that we are ever likely to send State Visitors from Bahrain to Iraq but if we do , you and his Majesty may rest assured that they will travel with proper credentials and letters of introduction.

I am afraid that I hav«i no recent detailed information as to the methods employed in the actual diving operations, if it is to those that the Hon'ble Member refers.

Sir I have the honour t® report that shaik Oasim Bin Mehza,Qadhi of Bahrain,asked me for an interview a few days back.

The Qadhi explained that it was the imiediate outcome of the action taken against Shaik JChalid &amp; his sons,which has bitterly chagrined shaik ifiasa,who is believe to have himself encouraged the oulprits,under the belief that nobody would dare to deal with them.He regards Hamad*s action as entirely due to my influence.I explained to the Qadhi that I feared that intrigues of this nature^ if persisted i^could only ham Shaik ^asa himself &amp; he agreed.He said ho would at once write a letter to Shaik ^Sasa advise him to cease agitation of this nature.I have heard nothing more of it.

Bahrain reforms. political Agent telegraphs that Shaikh Hamad tells him that strong opposition to reforms is being made w Sunni tribes at instigation of iihmed Cosari , Ahmed bin La he j and -^bdul Wahab zayani who agitate persistently and preach disobedience. They also practise it having refused to obey Shaikh's order to attend Majlis and committed other flagrant acts of disobedience. Shaikh Hamad prays that Government will assist him (1^ by removing these three agit ators (2) by forbidding tribal heads from leaving Bahrain out of contumacy and (3) by warning Ein Baud and Shaikhs of atar and Kuwait not to receive or to harbour such persons. Shaikh Hamad thinks such action would definitely suppress opposition to ref orms . political Agent reports three agitators ment ioned are notorious they have collected fis one lakh for pur poses of agitation and resistance to reforms, of which good grounds for -believing Ahmed contributed 10,000/- ■ He thinks and I agree, that these men should be severely dealt with. In regard to Shaikh's first request therefore, if ^haikh Hamad arrests these men would Government be pre pared to receive and detain them in India ? If so will Government please telegraph instructions urgently so that I can inform Shaikh Hamad who will certainly raise question dur ing my f orthcoming visit to Bahrain on 1st November . In respect of (2) I might perhaps warn tribal Heads that Govern ment will view with disfavour any attempt on their part to leave Bahrain out of contumacy and that if they do they must take consequences and expect retaliatory measures from the ruler77 19/163 &amp; 19/165 ■ ruler of Bahrain who will have Government support ?

We have no doubt that the P.A. Bahrain is mistaken in his policy and it is probable that he may report to the Govt, other than the fact,because he does not permit complaints to be made. He fights every one who opposes him and is practicing all sorts of oppression. The relation between Shaikh 'Issa and the English Govt, is 55 years old and he has been well respected by the Govt, whose function has been reaticted to advising. The Shaikh never disagree with the Govt, except in matters contrary to tradition and Shar'a. Major X&gt;aly however has been ever since his landing in Bahrain causing interruption of relation with Bahrain by creating obstacles in the way of the national authorities and abusing the noble 'Arab race. No wonder he should do so when the instigation in 'Iraq was the result of his bad policy which rising xosxaxoB eaattJtipaiHharitxxxKWfs* was not *x* suppressed but by the wise pilicy of COX. His first act was to discharge the Baladiyah Secretary in order to please certain selfish individuals alleging that he committed embezzlement while he refused the suggestion to bring him on trial.

Some time back one of the Pusht-i-kuh natives accused of robbing a ring was beaten to death in the reaidence of the P.A. j4nd when the Egyptian Director of Education protested against such savage procedure,the P.A. ordered his deportation* Three months ago a man-of-war by order of the P.A. arrested Sai.vid Ahmad ibn 'Abd ullah Al-doaari who was taken to prison for no reason whatever.He wasLeo fined xi8 .15.000/ without any trial.

The most excessive blow which e has directed against Bahrain was the note which he presented at he end of last Aaiaadhan( May .1923) asking the Shaikh to abdicate ind cede all his rights. Though the Shaikh holds the suppnort of all ihe tribes in Bahrain.yet Col.

In addition to this t.s.e P.A. has taken charge of the Justorn house and reduced the emoluments drawn by memebers of Al- .Khalifah thus violatirig the treaties and agreements which action las caused a general disappointoient among the '^rabs. On behalf of Banrain and for tne sake of humanity and good order I cry to the officials of Great Britain which are renowned of justice to deliver from unjustice those who have been inder their protection for 50 years and to save the British honour from the stain of Ikll treatment.

If t my friend, you are in good health it is your intention to pay me a formal visit as an expression of friendship,then I think you might have paid your visit to-day,in the ship,as has always been customary. If,however, your visit is with the object of making further complaints,! must inform Y ,E. that you have eieady had my reply to the petition sent by Y.K. a few of your subjects, &amp; I am not prepared to receive your Bxcellency in this connection, especially as you were most distinctly forbidden by Colonel to take part in Political affairs in Bahrain,which therefore no longer concern Y.E. If there are any matters for discussion,! shall be pleased to consider them together with your son Shaik Samad,in whose hands the conduat of affairs in these islands now is. I sh&amp;llhowever be very g]s d t o 3»ceive Y.E. to-morrow on a purely friendly visit on the understanding that no Political matters whatsoever will be discussed.My visit to Bahrain is to consult with the Political 'gent regarding reforms 'to be introduced &amp; has no connection with the petition which has already been fully answered.

Is it possible for anyone to speak of what has happened happening Ln Bahrain (as -Reforms.sic) , Is it T Reforms T to dismiss the Amir of the -Lown from his duties against the wishes of the people &amp; his own wisl without 'Shara' grounds therefor* &amp; is it reforms to deport people Imprison &amp; fine them by the thousands tens of thousands,without trial, i-s it 'Reforms 1 to change Manameh into a Foreign Town.Is it , reforms , for Major u&amp;lyto himself act like a tiadhi,as if bh were the 'Shara^ the tp-dhi or is it reforms like the matter of the killing of the Bastakj q the charge of stealing a ring.? Is it 'Reforms* to abuse noble people n court.? Is it reforms to close all the courts 5: open only one court in a place like Bahrain,&amp; to make all cases be opened by petitions, which take a long time so that if a case be criminal or urgent,such sases are only delat with twice in each week? Is it reforms to put the Avenues of the country into an iinglish Bank,without taking the ipinion of tl« people,whan the revenues come out of their pockets. In short these are examples of what aire called 'Reforms' v/hich you have taken up In this 2oth century &amp; which Major Daly has commenced. Is it right for a person to take another pe rsons house on the excuse that it urgently Qeeeded repair ( reform'* Indeed reforms are such things as advance the people,but Me jor ^aly has shut the road to advancement &lt;5: he it who 'tops those who strive for their country, .iiivan uuj Municipality whieh iej p' a public afAir,Major Daly handed over to foreigners who are hateful to the people. a s regards your sayingnhe Reforms will certainly be carried out 1 we do not accept this &amp; will not accept it do not think if you knew the truth you would insist on it.Wo will strive for our honour &amp; our country &amp; religion in every permissable way. should how ever the fire of compulsion descend upon us,will we le^ve our country?

Such reforms it is said Bahrain is in need ofI Yes ,there were certain faults in the Govern ment,but the public was trying to reform them the Governme t was prepared to accept reforms &amp; the proof of that is the countless petit- Ions sent to £&gt;haik ^asa one after the other,but the Consul himself jbci frustrated them &amp; everybody knows that for t h past two years people demand a parliament &amp; Shaik Ease agreed who opppsed it?

Sir, In reply to your telegram No. 134-1/s, dated 30th October 1923, I have the honour to make the following observations on the subject of the questions dealt withr in Colonel Knox's letter No*567 dated 9th. October. xx x in regard to.the second point, the camel difficulty I have the honour to forward for the information of the Government of India a copy of a letter from the Political No.140/1/15,dated 17-10-23 5 Agent, Bahrain, on this subject. It with enclosure 5 will be seen from the proposed regula tion which formed the enclosure to Major Daly's letter that Shaikh Hamed has framed rules which show decided progress for the better. A tax of Rs.10/- will be imposed on each each camel and Rs.5/- onjailch camel. Ivory village will have a pound and stray camels may be confined in and not released except by payment of Rs.30/-. Shaikh isa will retain 15 camel free of tax,&gt; Shaikh Hamed 50 of which 10 will be free considered State and y_from tax, which no one else will be allowedmore than 5 camels of which two will be permitted to be milch camels. This makes a great advance as Shaikh Hamed himself is a Prom Toiofr great lover of animals and has always kept large nimbore o? camels, horses and dogs. During my recent visit to Bahrain I spoke to the Political Agent and Shaikh. Hamed on the subject and learnt that the latter will not make any further reductions at present. Perhaps later on when the shaikhs and shaiklinga are tired of keeping camels on the mainland 'eating their heads off' from which they derive hardly any bene fit, they will be ready to abolish all except about a dozen for state purposes. Nowadays the Shaikhs can (and do) go oixt oc their shooting parties by car and donkey. I trust that the result 01 the new rules will be greatly to reduce the diffi culties and disputes caused by stray camels, in the circum stances I propose to write to the Political Agent and say that the new camel regulations mark a great advance^and express my approval of them. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant. Sd/- A.P.Trevor T ^ , Lieut-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Ho . fa Copy of the foregoing letter is forwarded to the Political Agent, Bahrain, with reference to his letter No. 140/l/l5, dated 17-10-23, and with the request that he will express my approval to Shaikh Hamed both of the terms of the new camel regulations and of the enterprise in introducing them.

Shaikh Abdullah income is supposed to be between ten and twenty thousand rupees a month and his son's between M 1$00/- and 2000/- it w^s eviaeut t.^at a small fine between father and son would be aXx a farce, so 1 said that the fine must be paid into the Bahrain Govern ment Treasury. lifter a lot of talk and haggling on the art oi Shaikh kodulla a suitable fine % ixen and accept ed by Shaikh ^bdulla. If his son cannot ^.ay the line abdulla will ^ay one 1 troat this will be a lesson to them both. 1 expressed to ShaiKh abdulla the hope that his son Shaikh Mohammed would learn wisdom from this and re train trom intrigue, as it he did not, he would get into serious trouble and pssibly have to be deported. ^fter this it w&gt;3 arranged that Shaikh Hamad snould produce the next momilng &lt;7th) the signatories to the petition handed in to tae *i,*wreaoe' on ist November 19^3, among whom were ^hmed bin Lai^sJ and Abdul wanab Sayani , so that my re^ly should be ©oifi»uaicated to them verbally ^0 memorandum of it which contained assurances of tne support ot (lovernment to Shaikh Eamaa should be given to the latter . 1 at first thought ol requesting Shaikh Eamad5 EAiaad to arr#3t tola, L^n&lt;9j aad Abdul Waa^b Sayaai t but rdtr»la«d x.oa l»h® aivio® of th« Folttioal Ag«nt»-, who as 14 that Haauad would probably ral«tt ^ac might 9vea wink at th#ir ab. ooad- ing If they saeit a rat. it waa torturi^tt tiiat 1 did aot do ao as in the evening Shaikh Eamad s\sgg«3t^i that these two individuals would be aulficiently frightened by lay re^ly to the other petitioners anc sight be given another ohanoe etc. However I refused to this course and Shaikh Eaaad was soon convinced that to do so would lead to end leas tr oubie. Cn the sicramg of the 7th all the signatories to tne petition were brought to tne agency by ShaiKhs Hamad and Abdul la except Ahmed bin h®he j who had excused himself on account of sore eyes . as these alleged sore eyes had nbt p*eventeu nlu. irom rushing about collecting a ignatures to the petition etc. it w»s evident tnat this w 0 s a pretext so 1 requested Shaikh Hamad to send men aau arrest him and b»ing him to the agency. Jhis wae done, and all tne sig natories to the petition having been collected in the oil ice with Shaikhs Eamad and kodulla, 1 went down accompanied by the political ^gent to see tnem.

W# had heard irom the dnaikhi anil other sources that about two thirds ol the tribe hod left Budalya and about one third ikl*i remained with Shaikh Is a bin ^hmed Dowari . -Phe object ol tb» manoeuvre was fairly obvious via. to keep a loot in both camps , aad to prevent confiscation as much as possible by pretending that most cl the property in Budaiya belonged to the section who remained . fhio arrangement did not commend itself at all6 AJLX VO St9 ( SAU At &amp;iots QtOlki it, WeU&gt; tcai iSlmikh EAstac. aliouia ooaaaiialoai,® witii tne joweuiir aoa oa.y that ao Gcioa«I Kaox,baa t&amp;M txiem tiaat fch«y Bight go ii th«y wanted to, subject to v I had ao otojaot- ioii to this oour^a, but that i oouid act agr«© to a port ion of tha triba going and a portion Jtiying: aithar they should all ratijtm to Budaiya within ten daya or ali laava. 11 thay -aant howavar t ihaiJih Hamad would, witn tha a^yrova of Qovarnmant, punish theai by ocnfi^dating their proparty, releasing tr«ir divers fron. their oontraot-* , and if neoeaa~ ary , prevent them from diving. as Shailch Hamad seemad very nervous about acting himself 1 gave him a letter promising him support in talcing the action mentioneu against tha jowmir . 1 will new refer to the iueation of the actual reforaa *nioh 1 have sisc^aed -tfith the political .igant and to some extent with Shaikhs Hamad and ^bdulla. 1 think tha foll owing reforms are necessary and should oe introduced with as little delay as ^os^ible.

The essential qualifications are integrity, energy and a knuwleuge ot accounts.

In the oirodmstanees f as we are introducing reforms at Bahr-in we auet, in ay opinion, do something for the pearling inn us try on which the welfare of the Islands depend* . X would not suggest the sligntest cnange in the gener al rules and usages oi the pearling system whion nave been in tore# from tiae laaeaorial*, what is necessary is to en force these rules with a ore regard to the interests of the aivers and mulers , these oi the Jaanuda« being almost »x~ clusi-vely considered at present. The first essential is that the i-fifichudas should keep accurate and intelligible accounts , the second is that ®aoh diver should be given a copy12 copy qt his aooouiit each hgaboa oy hid jaithuia , aad the thira that, the 'Jaiilah' (pearling usage) Court should to® cuai.osed cl mea ox ^o^itioa aoc integrity caj.-atole of under- staading such accounts. fhere doe.-s not at first a^^ear to be any diff iculty about settling these joints , towtt tne itAiter is ccm^llo^ted toy the t?o% that a large pmiiaamsBi proportion of the JaKlaidas ot B^hr^ia - 4ulte two thirds *e sstimaie - are atosolutely illiterate and iuite inoapatole ol' keei-in® an intelligitoie Account, .and in addition men of integrity who are ac-i'-^inted with pearling usages to sit on the Sal if ah Court are very lew and laas between . 'i'ne % politicai Agent is ol opinion ti^at the best way fco get over these two difficulties is to create a siuall pearling Depart ment 01 t^e Bahrain Oovernaent which will supervise tne industry generally and toeootte particularly active lor about one month before the pearling se -aon ooawenoed - a ay froa 21st March to the end of april - and ag'in for about one month alter - a-y from the 2ii*t deptemtoer to tne end ol October. During these periods the Sallfah Court would sit pemanent lyand t.© ilakhunas would be susmonec in turn to ■ appear with their divers and haulers . During t.e per iod belore the season the ilakhudas would prove to tne sat— is!action of the Department the amount paid on account of advances and tood during tne off seas on to eaon diver, and such amounts would be entered toy a clerk, in the namntua's accounts with a copy in the diver's book-, the advance lor the season would be paid over to the diver in t e depart mental oil ice ann similarly ente&gt;ec by tne clerk in the Hakhuda'a and diver's book. In the event ol a dispute the Hakhuda ^nd div^r concerned would proceed before tne Salifan Court and have the amount adjustes . in tne perioa at the end of the season the ^-.aknudaa with their divers would be summoned in the same way. Tne tfakhuias would prove tw the satislaction ol the Department the net preoeeos of tne season lor the boat ana st te the divers 1 and nauxers'li haulers * shares, which shares would be pskid over to the divers and Haulers (less adv iiees t-reveious ^ald theE/ in tne uej.?rtaeotal cl'l'ioe, atid details at the trajasaction eatered in the ^aknuda's acoouat -iid the aaia laots in the diver's book. in the event of the diver's .hare being less than the j.revicua debt to the ilakhu4a the saount due to hia on his share should b® entered in his book =»nd the debit 'balance shewn. Haknudas and divers iiaviing disputes would proceed bei ore the Saliva Court and have thea adjml- icnted. For s-akihg this arrangement the Bahra in G-overn- cent might legitimately i*akhudas aad divers a small percentage (say 1^) on their se-tson's gains or on the amount i,aid to the divers , this of course a*art from the general tax. on each ^.e^rling boat which 1 consider should be levied and the amount 01 which its being considered . fhie arr angement would tut the whole bus hiness on a sound footing, but it entails a good de -1 ci hard work and is therefore not suited to Bahrain; tie daKhudas would bitterly resent it as introducing too much publicity into their all airs anil reducing their chances of peculation anc. swindling• Be— lore endorsing and finally submitting tnis scheme im propose to Siake enquiries into the number of boats , Hakhui- as and divers with a view to seeing whether the proposal is feasible; it is possible that the number of the ia^t aer^t- loned category ore so large that a small department couln the not deal with them i^time. 1 think however aaae^hl.ig on these lines will have to be introduced . ^ 6 / alucoess ion .

Reference item 5 in my letter No.622-S # dated lOth November 1923, about Bahrain reforms. The Persian Gulf Gazetteer mentions that the number of pearling boats was estimated at 917 boats employing 17,500 men. This estimate was made in i.905 or thereabouts and I expect these estimates are now largely exceeded. I should be glad if you will have careful enquiries made and give me an estimate of the number of boats and men employed in the pearl industry now. In any case do you think that a small Department of the Bahrain Government could compete with keeping the accounts of so many nakhudas and divers? I am rather doubtful whether it could do so efficiently in the short time at its disposa^ viz about a month to 6 weeks before and after the pearling season.

Attache, Foreign and Political Department, Government of India. - j ^-' A -Bahrain, 20th Safar 1348 (=2-10-23). \ To •' f His i^ccellency the iiinister for Foreign Affairs of India. A.C. At a time that the British Government is trying to unite the Arabs with each other and form Arabic Governnents and countries, yes, at a time that Britain intends to cause the former Araos glory to return to them, at, the same time.Major Daly, the Political Agent, Bahrain, rises and tries to destroy one of the old Arabic Governments that is Shaikh Isa ben Ali and other A1 Khalifah family who were the first Arabic Govern ments who made treaties and agreements with the British Government I have no doubt that the Political Agent i&amp; mistaken in his policy and it is likely that he may make representations to the Government which may not be according to fact, because he does not allow the people to complain and fight against every prudent man in every way and make every sort of injustice to t he c omo1a inant. Shaikh Isa ben Ali havinghad relations with the British Government since 55 years ago and was shown much respect by the Government and his word was heard. The relations of the Agents with him were built on respect and the expression of their opinions were in the way of consultation. He was not opposing them in anything unless he has seen that it was contrary to custom and law. As to Major Daly's relations since he came to Bahrain he adopted an obstinate and unsocial attitude and created difficulties for the local Government and disgraced the glorified Arabic element, 'i'here is no surprise in it because by his evil policy he kindled a riot in Iraq which was not extinguished except by the sagaciousness of the skilxUl Gox. Yes, since he took over charge of the Agency at Bahrain he has been ruining by this policy more than building and retrograding more than advancing. The first action of the Political Agent was the dismissal of the Municipality Secretary on the ground that he had robbed from the Municipality. When the Deputy ruler of Bahrain wrote a memorandum on bth Shawwal to hln asking execution of the nan aa an exanrole for otnershe was annoyed and attacked the writer of the memorandum, oince that time I understood that he was not adopting a regular policy out he was serving his personal objects. Then we saw that he was giving arcolications of thanks and confidence to some raooles who were threatening the ceorae to sign them. I v/as assured that he was not confident of his actions, otherwise good acts do not require any evidence. After a short while he killed one of the Bastakis by oeating him at the Consulate accusing him to a robbery of a ring and when the Egyptian school master argued on this savage action he took an Opportunity and repatriated him. oince three months ago a man-of-war by the'order of the j.-'olitical Agent was sent, Saiyed Ahmad ben Abdollah Doseri was arrested, taken to Jahrain and imprisoned there without knowing the reason. He was fined a sum or its.15,000/- without any .judgment and knowledge (of having committed any thing). He was asked to v /rite a letter and apologize ror some things about which he was possibly unaware but he refused and preferred to remain in the prison than admitting a thing from which he was acquitted, iire these actions corresnond with the justice of Britain and are such croceedings attract the minds of the Arabs? But the great calamity which has no similar is the presentation of a mper to Shaikh Isa ben Ali at the end of kamazan asking him to abdicate from the chiefship of Bahrain and subtract his other dues but all the tribes of Bahrain are supporting him in the matter of abdication and subtraction of any ZHxsi^of his rights. Notwithstanding this Colonel Knox and the Political iigent wrote that the chiefship should remain in the name of Shaikh Isa ben Ali but the Government affairs and official communications should be done by Shaikh Hamad. That was a curious treatment similar to which has not been heard in the past. The Political Agent took over the Customs and fixed small allowances for some of Al Khalifah family contrary to treaties and agreements which agitated all the Arabs. In the name of Bahrain, Philantropy, law,the famous justice 4 of English nation^ shout loudly to the ceotDle of Great Britain so that they may rescue those by whom I had been protected since halfhalf a century and preserve the English resnect which has been stained oy bad treatment. I beg the Government to make enquiries in all the matters of Bahrain and tjut an end to these disturoances otherwise the Arabs who cannot bear injustice and do not submit to disgrace are not responsible for any anarchy and ruin. iiln 3d.

I may mention here that political Agent has heard indirectly tteat from leading Shiah tribesmen of T^RUT and SINaBIS near Darin and at if that they wish to escape from tyranny of Bin Saud' s rule and come to Bahrain-, they are said to number two to three thousand people with about e / 100 boats and would do well for Budaiya .

You will remember that he undertook not to increase any allowances without consulting me &amp; that I pointed out to you the necessity for an undertaking of this nature to ensure the Treasury being in funds for the provision of the reforms decided upon or likely to be introduced in the future. 3haik Hamad also has his 0 ffical Residence xiept up for him out of the public Works fund &amp; his income is solely for his private needs &amp; for entertainment.His grown up sons have 89par*&amp; allowances.! regret however that he has not the remotest idea of economy &amp; appears to be incapable of refusing to give money to other members of the family when they beg of him,in spite of the fact that they have all separate allowances. He continues to keep a stud of fifty horses &amp; large herds of camels in addition to several motor cars of course a ridiculously large &amp; worthless retinue. I have constantly brought to his notice the necessity for economy.but although he professes to . . ovnATiditure to a minimum I regret I have be cutting down his expendi-cur® been able to detect little result. It is possible, though at this stage difficultto judge. 'that the Bahrain GQvsrnment resources could provide him with a slight incraasa.but in the first place I do not see the nacassity c secondly I sar it would not do the slightest good, 4 fael sure th^t in a t«w months he would! again be in difficulties &amp; aslc ^ or 8 further increase .His present idea is that he needs at least another five thousand a month &amp; really rants ten thousand more, which seems to be out of the question. I told him that he already ]aww of the views expressed by Colonel Knox,which I felt sure, in view of the necessity for reserving some of the public money for the administration,you would endorse,&amp; that I would not on my own authority agree to such an increase which would undoubtedly open the doo® to similar demands by every member of the family. I think what is reallly required is for it to brought forcibly home to him that he must economise caanot expect to constantly get more from the treasury. I would suggest therefore,if you see fit, that you should write him a letter saying that I have referred the natter to you &amp; that you do not see your way to agreeing to an increase of his allowance which seems to be more than adequate.If he gets such a letter from you he will be in a mood for retrenchment &amp; will doubtless listen to my advice as to several ways in which a saving could be affected. When he has felt the pinch a little has genuinely made an effort to cut down expenditure, it may be possible to give him s little more by way of extra allowances for upkeep of say two stafe motors or something of the sort, rather than acquiesetoigi in an increasedst allowance .but if we give him more now / 1 have not the slightest doubt that he will return to the charge again in a | few months time .A definite set back now would make him careful.-he position is that he gives out largesse to other members of the family who already have allowances^ by pleading for himself till indirectly increasiiCK such allowances all round in ^pite fact that, they were granted on a most generous sc^le. I t*ve a small sum in hand to meet occasional extra demands,set aside in a special emergency fund,but I am loth to allow him to start drawing on this while he has made no genuine effort to live . . *. if he finds he cannot get more Hthin his income.He is not in debt^ ix ne ix \ ^ ^ easilv cut down his expenditure by at V simply asking for it, could ea ilaast 3 s 4 000 a raonth ia«thod4s which I have already suggested t© him, aI1 c[ which ha will doubtless consider moro carefully if he 4s certain he can get no more money.

The position is that the has at the moment over three lakhs of Rupees in hand.Of this it is proposed to earmark one lakh for iapreveaents to bring the customs up to date,by building sheds to protect merchandise on the wharf,complete the customs ^etty .lay a narrow guage track for moving merchandise,&amp; to build a small house on a site already available .for the Customs Director. The actual c®st of all these is estimated by Mr Bower &amp; myself to be about Rs 89,00° but the 5haik agree® that we should allow I lakh to be an the safe side. We then have two lakhs in hand to meet any init4i3 expenditure for levies, such as provision of huts etc initial equipment &amp; possibly for the provision or part provision of a water supply ,which would be an immense boon to the people of Manameh. In addition some of the reforms proposed will not be carried out &amp; become a cost to the state for some months meanwhile the Hq serve will be still further mounting upp Apart from thla tha Baagat shows that whan 4 if, all the propoaea reforms are in full swing wa can count on a monthly excess of receipts over expenaitara of at least Rs 26,000 par mensem . I say 'at laasf because receipts have been purposely estimatea on most conservative basis,while exponaiture has been given a consider -able margin under each head. Iha Buagat has been preparea for one month instea of one yesar.whioh it is hopaa will bo oaually useful,but receipts are the average monthly receipts basod on a careful stuay of the figures of tha past three years.The somewh-t astonishing Improvement is of course aua to an immonse amount of sheer waste .largely within the customs itself,which it has been possible to curtail.Ho allowance has been made for the more-be of receipts which wouM result if the increase of customs proposea be sanctionea. but this increase wouia amount (estimate a by Mr Bower) to about Rs 16500 a month.

It is proposed to consult some of the leading people before definitely formulating a scheme. At the time the bare outline of^possible scheme was made it had not been considered advisable to consult leading peeoie as the agitati© against reforms ,led by Nakhudas,was at its height. Since the recent firm action however,a considerable change has taken place &amp; it is generally recognised that reforms are necessary &amp; bound to come &amp; already there is speculation &amp; talk of how they can best be done. AlX that is necessary is for Government to authorise Hamsd to say that they spprova of raforms which when agreea upon &amp; sanctioned will hare oar support.We will then consult local opinion put up for the consideration of SoTemment what we consider to be the bast scheme.She Oadhl.who has much ejiparience of the relations between divers &amp; Nakhudas, he s plmeadj informed us that he strongly supports a scheme on thalinos already outlined. IJakhudas are at present being sent to him in disputes about accounts 4 thay ere producing their accounts which they never would do before.He is disallowing tl the iniquitous interest charged 4 thay are accepting the situation which shows a great change in their attitude.A typical case is e recent one in which the Hakhuda claimed Rs lojo 4 eventually only proved before the Padhi Rs 300 4 accepted the deoisinn. I have recently for the first time got hold of an account book. I am having accounts translated as typical a^.mp es.In several cases divers »avo worked for years receiving only about Rs6 for each actual month of diving.all other advances being recorded as debts .Even if they had not been recorded as debts but h d bee! finally paid to them without recovery they would have received onl^L at Hs 5® fo* ePch ZGtualmonth of diving,less then s? cooly cfn 'earn theoretically in debt thay cannot escape the Nakhuda. The i^ oa g r0lin 3 here that a scheme might be devised whereby diver gets a fixed share of the actual oysters he recovers talcps his chance as to what he gets out of them.This is the system which used to be in force in Ceylon.The idea is that he would work w jjiingly for his own sake &amp; incidentally improve the Uakhudas share. It is pronosed to discuss the possibilities of this with Hakhudas. It weald remove all the difficulties connected with the Hakhudas selling the pearls without the knowledge of the divers thus swindling them, n i^aik ^amad is s actively engaged in the reforms as he can be &amp; is ts king more personal interest than I had anticipnted certainly as much as anybody who knows A1 IChalifeh family could ever expactp (£) i t ia believed that the proposed increae of Customs would have very little effect on the cost of living.It would certainly noo materially affoot tha poorer olaases.wh.ae staple diet ia dates which rre not importaSJ--haifc Hamad has already agreed to remit customs on slaughter cnimals.This will not affect Customs Wpts In cash as the duty has hitherto heen received in kind 4 has been handed over to the stalks for their cm use .This will be a^great benifit to the community .lt is propsed to introduce it *, ? s.t-off to the other increases.

Firstly^I had alredy prepared a Budget which I was about to send you with reference to my propose Is nd secondly the last para, of your IIo2 in which you ask if 1 think it would be a good thing to ask for a young ^fficor who has Just finished his training to assist^exactly fits in with a proposal which I was putting up this mail &amp; which is as follows - When you were here I explained to you the arrangement we have had for some time as regards the Court. Ha^ad &amp; I sit together. He takes cases between his own subjects I take cases between Britsh subjects dbr protected persons we take * Joint Court* cases i.e. where subjects of both sides are involved,together, ^he cases come on alternately. We have found the system of immense benifit to all. Firstly it eliminates a lot of correspomdance. Gas s between British subjects often dragged in others necessitated letters to the Shaik much delay,&amp; similarly he often had to write to the Agency.Howj such points can be settled at once .Again ( in criminal cases, 4n which the accused may consist partly of British protected persons psrtly of ohaiks bubjscts, instead of .aoh being taken separately &amp; treatiEai- dif arently / th«y are oonsiderea together so that all gat the same sentonoa if ^ny. Indeoiding vjhht instalments a debtor is to pay we are in a position to consider his position with regard to ell the suits filed against him wharas formerly he might be ordjrod xn one court to pay oortsin instalments 4 in another to pay other instalments,the two combined being beyond his known capacity to pay,which resulted sooner or later in his being run in for failing to obey the decree of one or other of the courts.lt would be wearisome to enumerate the advantages the system has,of which the above are examples. The proof 01 tha pudding is in uhe% |E&gt; { f eating- &amp; reaults ahow that a Portable ayat.m att oh aa thla v.as nrgsntly needed.

But the fact romaina that the work ia really now too heavy for both a±tks:r Hamad &amp; Ei5rs®lf who have aountlass other matters to engage oar attention,but Hamad is anxious that Court work,which is the greatest benifit the Heforms have so far produced for the people, should not fall in arrears.! large number of the cases are un- iwportant suits for recovery of debts etc but a fpir number arise out of recent cases of oppression within the last year or so,which we are gradually solving &amp; removing many grievances.The aggrieved parties now have a chance of getting their wrongs vf^dressed I must say that Hamad is turning out a vary creditably Judge.At the same time he makes no bones about telling me that my presence is of the greatest assistance to him &amp; enables him to ask my advice in the more intric^ie cases. We could transfer many more cases to the Shara &amp; the Majlis Al Urfi,but the latter are kept full up ^ they are raercArtmts &amp; cannot afford the time to sit more than once a week for a few hours &amp; we keep the Share hard at it. The urgent need is for another court on the same lines / which would reliwe both Hciad &amp; myself.We have discussed the matter fully^ &amp; are agreed • A that there is no member of the family who could be trusted at present or has sufficient knowledge,to sit in court without advice ^ our suggestion is that a young member o i. the family who has Just been appointed Amir of Manamtefe,^ who attends our courts for instruction, should form the second court with a 'Britjjfeh Officer. The latter would combine with this duty that of Commandant of the Levies &amp; would if necessary he can manage it,supervise t the Revenue department (Otherwise it is proposed the Director of Customs should do this) We propose that this court ,which should be designated in Arabic 'The Small Court' should haveI ^ piwtr to 1 ^' 00s \-ithin the povera of a s #c#nd class Magistrate, 4 that it should sit three or four days a week as be necessary. Ihire should be right of appeal on payment of appeal fees &gt; to the 'large C 0 cir t ! which will continue to consist of Hamad the Ppl. wor^i 11 ? on ^ li n9d hi tharto in force which would have the powers e^ready possessed by the - .A. of -fist Class Magistaste &amp; Sessions Judge. Hamad would be guided by those po ers himself in taking his own cases. It is further proposed that certain classes of cases, should for the time being be reserved for the 'large Court* namely Criminal Cases be twen Junnis &amp;3h^iahs Cases between Sunni flardan owners &amp; their shiah farmers,which owing to the religious feeling political aspect require careful handling. In estimating the pay of a British CommEndant of Levies in the Budget I have purposely allowed for th® dual capacity. I would urge that a ^oung .Political officer who has Just done training might be appointed to this post,which would be regarded ss*P©reign Service 1 He might be given his pay in the Political plus an allowance for c emsndant of Levies. He would undoubtedly be a good investment fot the Bahrain Gfovernmont &amp; would earn most of his pay In court fees, ^he present system as regards dfees.is that in cases between Bahrain subjects which Hamad takes^he fees go to the Bahrain Grovernment, in Joint cas^s they ^re divided, &amp; in cases between Britsh subjects taken by the PpA#. they are credited to Government. I would suggest that this system continue as regard the ! large Court' but I think it weald be right as regards the imall ^ourt^ for all fees to go to the Bahrain Government,since they would be paying the British o ffic0r. Or another,but more c^-omplicated way would be for Govt, to pay half the salary of the officer (except the Commandants allow N tnca which would be paid wholly by Bahrain) &amp; Bahrain the other kxi half,but this would be complicated further as regards pension contribution.I think that he should be wholly paid by the Bahrain Government &amp; that they should have the fees earned in his court, even if recoverd from Britsh protected persons^ then they would b9 in positien to ask his- help in other small matters as well. ^Uch an officer could he housed without trouble^he new quarters ^signed for the Customs Director, which is to be started almost|0 ^l£&gt; wi /pJi- J*' imra0 aiately are designQd to take two bachelors comfortably. The experience a young officer wguld gain Vii®uld ba very valuable to hi him, &amp; without in any way tjUfing the hands of Government, it is not Impossible that the local knowledge he would acquire might make it very convenient for him to eventually become PfAf &amp; continuity of Policy for e few years afterythe initijttion of the reforms is very desirable. } I need hardly say that I consider Shuiatiamwould be the ideal choice. 1 Whether he would like the job I do not know. He is married &amp; we should have to make some other srrengement for housing but that would not be impossible. There is an excellent house (Farua T s new building) which the Bahrain Govt, could probably rent HH cheaply'. Owing to my own peculiar position he ishuldham) is actuals ? a few places senior to me on the list,but he is much my junior in Army service &amp; is several years younger &amp; has actually served as my personal Assistant &amp; I do not think he would feel the position invidious !

This crossed one from me saying ttat 1 thought answer to your abovement- icned telegram might be in affirmative subject to limit of expense to Bahrain State and asking olitical Agent if he, agreed , and if so, what limit he would suggest. To this he replied in his 213-C dated 28th December as follows begins (Text of telegram) ends . as Abdul Wahab wealthy and in the habit og residing in India it seems unfair that Bahrain should be saddled with his expenses especially if the news of his living in luxury at the State expense moves others to emulate his example. Further if ^bdul Wahab gets this concession he would undoubtedly consider he had scored off Bahrain State (and he would have) . / 1 therefor deprecate offering to keep him at expense of Bahrain State unless there is no alternative . perhaps following course would be legal. Shaikh of Bahrain could ask officially that ^bdul Wahab should be considered a person to whom Bahrain Order in Council applies under s . 8 (2) or (3) I can then apply s. 21 (1, and order him to reside out of Bahrain for two years. Similarly , as he is presumably a British protected subject within the meaning of the Persian Coast and islands Order in Council19/165 • Council arjd t»h.e Muscci'b Order In.

Trevor .1^1 Cpafigleiitt* Britisk Consulate, Wtorramshakr, iNio»14-T 14tk April 1942. a fi Sir, X Witk reference to my telegram too 9 %0 dated the 13tk April 1942, I kave the koaour to say tkat for sosie weeks past talk among the Arab comiimity of tkis district kas centred muck upon their dissatisfaction with the Persian Officials and their disappointment that the British occu- -pation kad not lead to an end of tkis H tyranny H and an establishment of Arab rule under British protection. Tke main cause for discontent apart fro® the general lack of love of Arab for Persian is the endless petty annoy- -ances and harassments Arabs say they receive at tke hands of the Aaanieh* These annoyances are for the Main part suck as might normally be inflicted upon the public by an ill-disciplined police force anywhere, but they certainly do not appear to worry tke Persian public to the saiae ex- -temt# tke^ are ; aagnification of every petty occur- -ance, extortion of money, tea, Eaeals, entry of kouses, rougk treatment, false complaints et cetera. Tke present Chief of A^niek seens personally responsible for muck of this dissatisfaction and it is no secret that even tke Governor of Kkorramskakr finds ki® most trying. He is endeavouring to secure kis removal and kopes shortly to succeed. Tke Governor kiaself seems to be very muck more popular and kis genuine efforts to get at the truth of the Mattery brought to kis notice and administer kis dis- -trict quietly and happily is,1 think appreciated on all sides. About ten days ago tke Governor of Kkorraiaskakr com- -plained to me tkat Skaikk Ghassib, son of the late Skaikk Kkazal, kad gone from Basra to ^ao on about 1st i^pril 1942 and met certain agents of kis from the Persian side and instructed them to give as muck trouble as possible to the Persian officials, especially in ^asbat an Hassar (Gusbek) and Skadgan, Tkis I reported to His Majesty's Minister, tke Hon'ble tke Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and informed His Majesty's Consul-General in Basra and suggested that Skaikk Ckassib migkt be given another warning to desist from these activities and that ke might be kept under obser- -vation. Since then rumours of some form of concerted action by all Arabs in ^kuzistan and those in the vicinity along tke Iraq border kave been steadily gaining ground in tke bazaars of Abadan and Khorramshakr. Tke main theme being that upon a chosen day Skaikh Chassib would come and all Arabs would run in from their villages concentrating upon the nearest centre Akwaz, Khorramskakr or Abadan in order to loot and revenge themselves upon the Persian officials. It was said that the British authorities would not inter- -vene but would even support them. It is well nigk im- -possible to trace tke source of these rumours, but it seems ^ Reader W.Bttllard, K.C.M.G.,C.I.E., that/ His Majesty's Minister, Tehran * J</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000137_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/338</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000137</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/338</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 19/165 II (C 20) Bahrain Reforms'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1923/1923</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2013-11-26T11:06:31</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (233 folios)</extent><extent>Arranged in chronological order, from earliest at beginning of file to latest at end.</extent><extent>A bound correspondence file.
