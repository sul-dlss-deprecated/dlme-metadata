As I see it, so long as Pakistan and India remain in the Commonwealth there is no change so far as extra territorial rights are concerned and I do not think Sultan would question this nor need v.e object. If however Pakistan wishes commercial part of treaty to apply she will have to accede under .article 20. ^ven though India signed the treaty I think use of the words ,f two High Contracting Parties M in Article 11 makes it clear that it was not repeat not originally contemplated that Indian Govern ment should appoint a separate Consul. Certainly I am sure Sultan would never agree to such a Consul establishing a separate court. 3. I consider that if either India or Pakistan leave the Commonwealth all special privileges at present enjoyed by them under the treaty would lapse and have to be re-negotiated.

There is no objection from our point of vie* to the British Consular Courts continuing to exercise Jurisdiction over subjects of the Dominions of India end Pakistan so long as these oountries continue to rsnain in the British Commonwealth of Rations t and their nationals continue to remain British subjects or British protected persons. The Sultan is unlikely to object. 3. I can see no alternative because even should the sultan accept that India has the right to appoint a Consul in muscat. I agree that he would be reluctant to allow this official to exercise Jurisdiction over Indians in Muscat. 4. Should either India or Pakistan leave the Common wealth we should no longer be able to exercise Jurisdiction over their nationals, who would no longer remain subjects of His majesty; mid the sultan would for the same reason object to the exercise of such Jurisdiction by us. The best course would appear to be in the conclusion of an agreanent between Muscat on the one hand mid India and Pak* latan (after the latter's accession), separately on the other, that the ttreaty should beoome terminable on short notice on either side in respect of either Dominion which left the British Commonwealth. 5. on the hypothesis that India remains a party to the Treaty, and that Pakistan is a new member of the British Commonwealth of nations. Pakistan would presumably have to aoeede to the Treaty before it could enjoy any of the commer- oial rights under the Treaty, though such accession le not necessary for nationals of Pakistan, qua British subjects. / to continue under the Jurisdiction of the British Consular Courts. 6. 1 am sending a copy of this letter to Stewart. lours sincerely, Sd* A# C•GADLOWAi• £.P.

September, 1947* Sir, Re lations with the Sultanate of Muscat I arii directed to refer to your despatch No.F. 15-BPC/47 dated 30th April, 1947, on the subject of the future administration and control of His Majesty* s Government’s relations with the Arab States in the Persian Gulf, aid to state that His Highness the Sultan of Muscat has been informed of the position by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, His Highness has stated that he has a number of questions he would like to put forward in the near future aid is likely to request that the position with regard to the Muscat Treaty of 5th February, 1939 should be clarified as early as possible. As the Government of India will be aware 'India' was an original party to this Muscat Treaty. The Sultan will no doubt accept the position that the Dominion of India, as at present constituted, remains a party to the Treaty, although if the Dominion of India, appoints a representative at Muscat, His Highness would doubtless take the view that Articles 13 to 16 of the Treaty contemplate the existence of only one British Consular Court. These Articles provide for jurisdiction by British Consular authorities over British subjects and British protected persons only and, in the event of the Dominion of /India The Secretary to the Government of India in the ExtomaJ. Affairs and Commonwealth Relations Department, New Delhi.I &lt;r 2 . India at some future date deoiding to leave the British Commonwealth, Indians who thereby ceased to be British subjects or British protected persons would presumably no longer enjoy the privileges contained in these Articles* 3* . I am to enquire whether the Government of India have any further comments on this matter at this stage ior communication to the Sultan of Muscat in the discussions foreshadowed in paragraph 1 of this letter.

The Sultan said at ray maating this Morning ha would like to get my prellralrary ideas on the effects of the constitutional changes in Indie on our Treaty of Friendehip a rtf navigation before he gave m hie. I said that I had not got the views of His &gt;fejesty»8 Qovern*ent and that anything I paid mist be taken as purely ny own personal views and without the authority of the Resident or Ris Majesty’s Government, hut for what it was worth I thought that as long as India remined within the Empire and remained under the English Crown it must be held that they were covered by the present Trusty and all rights of jurisdiction vested in the Political Agent covering British subjects covered then as well as Pakistanis. That if India remained within the Commonwealth and yet severed the link with the Crown then I really could not form any opinion as to whether or not they could be regarded as natiorslr of His Majesty. I thought on the whole not. 2 . On the subject of accession I said that I thought under article 21, Pakistan had the right to accede at any time. 3 . The Sultan then In said he was ^lad to have igjr views. He realised they were in no way authorised, end gave him something on which to base his own ideas. He could not actually agree with my views in many respects but he had not quite mde up bis aind whether it would be better to enter into long discussions over technical details of nationality etc now or whether to let things drag on a littls longer as they are until the Treaty terminates in 1950 and then give notice that he wished to draw up an entirely new Treaty. I got the impression that that is the ■curse he will probably follow. ltd. 'A.C.S.' 14th March 1948.The Sultan said today that whiLe he is of the opinion that the 1939 Treaty was effective so far as*India was concerned he did not think th^t it governed his relations with Pakistan unless that Dominion/ formally acceded to it. I said that I thought that both India and Pakistan were successor States to the old Government of India and I thought that the Treaty was eoually applicable to both. I said, however,'that I would look into the matter. v Copy to P. a. Mu scat. ^ t j' (ltd.) V.R.H. '•—*«•' 3, U , Let . P .A.Muscat. SPolitical Agency, Muscat dated the 5th May, 1948. Will you please refer to a minute which you left of your discussion with the Sultan on the 3rd April, 1948, about the 1939 Treaty ? 2, His Highness seems, as far as I can judge, willing to agree let the present Treaty continue to apply to Indians, Pakistanis as well te the peoples of the Commonwealth countries which originally acceded, at any rate until 1951 when the Treaty expires. I have purely gathered this from conversation, I admit. 3. He has, however, told me unofficially, that he is getting together his ideas for the new treaty and that he wishes to reduce the present jurisdiction of the Consul in any future treaty. I gathered however, that he had not got very far with his work upon the subject. . I expressed no opinion, of course. 4, His Highness wishes in this respect seem to be fairly common talk, thanks, perhaps, to his Director of Customs, Rashid, who is inclined to be somewhat talkative, and it is rumoured that a number of the Indian and Pakistan merchants would lje prepared to leave Muscat, rather than come under the jurisdiction of the local court. 5.

SUBJECT MUSCAT - PAKISTAN RELATIONS ’LB’i During my recent visit to Muscat the Sultan said that while he was of opinion that the 1939 Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation might bind him so far as India is concern ed he did not think it governed his relations with Pakistan unless that Dominion formally acceded to it. I should be grateful if you could let me have a ruling on this point. The Sultan takes his st&amp;'dd on Article 20(1) of the Treaty in which it is stated that: M The High Contracting Parties agree that His Majesty may by notification given through his Consular Officer at Muscat accede to the present Treaty in respect of any Member of the British Commonwealth of Nations whose Government may desire that such accession should • be effected. Any such accession shall take effect as from the date of notification thereof.” The Treaty was signed by the late Sir Trenchard Fowle on behalf of (i) Great Britain and Northern Ireland and (ii) India and the Sultan is of opinion that as Pakistan is a new Dominion it must notify him through His Majesty's Government if it wishes to accede to the Treaty. % 3. Priraa facie it would appear that the Dominions of India and Pakistan are both successor States to the old British India and both equally entitled to the benefits of the 1939 Treaty. 4. The Sultan has previously expressed doubts whether even the new India is entitled to the benefits of the Treaty and I am not sure that he is yet fully satisfied on this point The Sultan has previously expressed doubts whether Sd/- W.R.

He stated that although he was av/are of the treaty position at Bahrain and the other Sheikhdoms,his own treaty with His Majesty’s Government A do not recognise the representation by His Majesty’s Consul at Muscat of the Shaikhs concerned. He also stated that when this matter was raised at the time of negotiations for his treaty, he had not h&amp;hn. to the Consul representing the interests of a l) y ' third party and matter had thereupon been byougbx.
