The letter also discusses the location of the Ameer of Herat's forces which had been en route to Merv, that they were now being instructed to locate the Prince and reporting that the Turcoman army would most likely depart by the same route, and noting the ravages they had already caused in Herat territory.The letter also discusses the likelihood of the Jumsheedee [Jamshadi] tribe being encouraged to provide aid and resistance to the departing Turcoman tribes.The letter then repeats paragraphs from letter No.4 regarding the Jumsheedee tribe and Mahomed Afzul Khan; and the relations between the Indian Government and Dost Mahomed Khan; before requesting permission to remain in Herat a while longer.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023882889.0x000006#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
