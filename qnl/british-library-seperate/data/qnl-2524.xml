The incident was reported by Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah to Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, Adviser to the Bahrain Government, who in turn reported the matter to the Political Agent, enclosing two of the discharged bullets (not included in the file) with his letter (folio 1B). A report of the incident is included in the file (folio 3), which is described as being an accident, not helped by the poor design of the gun’s safety catch.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000c2#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000c2#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
