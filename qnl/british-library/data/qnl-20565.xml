Sir, I am directed by Lord Passfield to transmit to you to be laid 'before Mr.Secretary Benn copies of two despatches with enclosures from the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, regarding an application made 'by the Eastern and General Syndicate, Limited, for permission to enter into negotiations with the Shaikh of .Bahrein for the grant of an oil concession to extend over that part of the .Bahrein Islands (including their territorial waters) v^ich is not covered 'by the .Bahrein oil Concession agreement of the &gt; 2nd December 1925. 2. In para.2 of his despatch of the 9th July, Colonel -Biscoe raises the question of the present status of the Eastern and General Syndicate in .Bahrein. Enquiries on this point have been addressed to Mr. Jensen of the Eastern and General Syndicate who has stated that the assignment of the concession Ox 1925 by that Syndicate to the. .Bahrein Petroleum Company has, in fact, been completed- Mr. Jan sen explained that, in asking that any additional concession should be granted to the Syndicate and not to the .Bahrein Petroleum Company, Major Holmes was acting with the full knowledge and consent of the Company, to which the additional concession, if granted, would be at once transferred. Mr. Jansen stated that this procedure was adopted to avoid direct negotiations between the negoti ations cetween the Shaikh of Bahrein and representatives of the American interests concerned, as to the undesirability of which there had been general agreement. Although this procedure appears to be somewhat involved, the ' I A*. 37 iW . ^ rffhothe Secretary of State sees no objection to it, provided that if any additional concession is granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate, an assignment of that concession to the ■Bahrein Petroleum.Company is entered into simultaneously with the signing of the concession. 3. it will 'be recalled that the original application for this additional concession was discussed at an inter-depart- mental conference on the 28th November 1929. As a result of the decisions then arrived at, and after further correspondence with the other interested Departments, the Eastern and General Syndicate were informed that the suggested extension of their concession to cover the whole of Bahrein was a separate question which could more properly he discussed after the questions relating to the existing concession (i,e«, the concession of 1925) had 'been disposed of; that no decision had yet 'been reached 'by His Majesty's Government in regard to their application for such an extension; that it was probable that further consultation with the local authorities would 'be necessary 'before a decision could be reached on the subject, and that while His Majesty 1 s Government could not indicate the line which their decision would be likely to take, it would be unwise to assume that it would necessarily be favourabl In this connection attention is invited to para. 2(5) of a letter to the Syndicate dated the 3rd of January 1930 , a copy of which was enclosed with Colonial Office letter 1^0.69035/29 of the 9th of that month* 4. While Lord Passfield is aware that as a general principle His Majesty's Government are opposed to the grant of concessions which would constitute a monopoly over the whole of one territory, he is, as at present advised, disposed to think that in the case of so small an area as Bahrein, there might be advantage in having only one concessionary Company at work, and that no obstacle need, therefore, be put by His Majesty's Government in the way of the Company in securing the additional concession which they desire, although the actual terms might ^e left for negotiation by the local authorities. He would, however.however, be glad to 'be furnished at an early date with an expression of Mr, Benn 1 s views in the matter, A similar letter is being addressed to the Petroleum Department and copies of this letter, with its enclosures, are 'being sent to the Foreign Office, Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry and -Board of Trade. 1 am, etc. 0#Gr •R.Willi ams.

I am directed by the Secretary for Mines to refer to your letter of August 9th, Ho.79035/30/Part II and to India Office letter Ho.6166/30 of September llthi' regarding an application by the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited, for permission to enter into negotiations with the shaikh of Bahrein for the grant of an oil concession to extend over that part of the Bahrein Islands (including their territorial waters) which is not covered by the Bahrein Oil Concession agreement of December 2nd, 19£6, and to offer the following observations for Lord Passfield^ information. (1) The Island of Bahrein has been included by the groups constituting the Iraq Petroleum Company in the area within which they have agreed that there shall be no competition for concessions amongst the various companies interested in the Iraq Petroleum Company. This arrangement appears to have precluded the Gulf Oil Company from operating in Bahrein as a result of which it has assigned the rights acquired from the Eastern and General Syndicate to the Standard Oil Company of California, and the latter Company has in turn organised a Canadian subsidiary (the Bahrein Oil Company) to hold ] and operate the concession. Phe Under secretary of State, COLOHIAL OFFICE, S • W • :L • FRO . SEca.i The Gulf Oil Corporation of/ b ul 1930 i Qi i . D(4)/ q (E) of which the Eastern Gulf Oil Company is a subsidiary is one of the independent United States Companies. The Standard Oil Company of California is a member of the well known group of Standard oil companies in the United States, and was incorporated, as a consolidation of previous Standard oil companies, in Delaware in 1926, The Company is engaged in all branches of the Oil Industry from prospecting to the distribution of refined products. It is engaged in actual drilling outside the United States in Colombia and Venezuela# (3) The Petroleum Department are not aware of any British Company who would be likely, under present conditions, to undertake oil exploration In the Bahrein area. At one time the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were interested, but it is understood that their Geologists have now condemned practically the whole of the main land of Arabia. They had an option covering the territory of Bahrein until March 31st # 1925, and at one time offered to put down a test Well on the Islandjof Bahrein, if requested to do so. They did not, however, seem very enthusiastic ever the project. It appears from previous correspondence that the Iraq. Petroleum Company has declined to consider the matter further. (3) The Eastern and General Syndicate do not seem to have put forward any specific reason for demanding an extension of their concession, and it is presumed that their object is mainly one of acquiring control over as large an area as possible before drilling is actually commenced. From the point of view of the Shaikh of Bahrein, the concession is quite a favourable one, as the Royalty offered is relatively high {about 5/3 per ton) and if operations were carried out on behalf of either the Gulf Oil Company or the Standard Oil Company of California they would no doubtjbe conducted in an efficient manner.(4) The Petroleum Department consider that the area which the Syndicate are already entitled to take up under lease (of about 156 a^uare miles) should be large enough to enable them to acquire control of a substantial oilfield in the erent of favourable indications being discovered as the result of drilling under prospecting licence* It should be remembered that the actual area covered by many proved oilfields is by no means large* It was stated by the Chairman of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1926 that the proved area of the main producing field at Masjid-i-Suleiman in Persia only amounted to about 30 square miles* It is understood that as a result of further trial borings this area may now be said to amount to about 40 square miles (the field is about 18 miles long x 4 miles wide at its widest part)* The new field in South Persia at Haft Kel, which is 35 miles S*E* of the main oilfield, covers a structure of about 9 miles long by 2 miles wide. In Russia the producing area in Baku is only about 12 square miles in extent. The latter is rather an unusual case as the Baku field represents an exceptional concentration of oil. Nevertheless, it is considered that these instances are sufficient to show that after carrying out a campaign of prospecting drilling over the whole Island, the Company should be able to protect Itself adequately by taking up an area of 156 square miles. This would still leave an area of 52 square miles on the main Island available for future concessions, whereas the Syndicate would have had the advantage of being first in \ the field and having first choice of areas. (5) There is always the danger that a Company forced x to demarcate the area of its concession before sufficient drilling has been done to enable the geological structure to be thoroughly understood, may be unfortunate in that a good/o good oil producing structure may subsequent ly 'be disoovered w close to the boundary of the oonoessio^ with the result that oompanles granted subsequent concessions might be in a position to drain oil to some extent from territory held by the original concessionaire. Companies must, however, be prepared to take some risk in these matters, and if a certain amount of territory is withheld it might be extremely useful to H.M*Government in the course of later negotiations as a bargaining counter. If the other concessions in which the Eastern and General Syndicate are interested on the Arabian coast are completed and transferred to the Bahrein Petroleum Company, the Standard Oil Company of California, through the Bahrein Petroleum Company, would control a very considerable area in Arabia on the shores of the Persian Gulf. In practice, however, the investigations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have indicated that the prospects of finding oil are not very favourable, and it therefore seems advisable to encourage the Bahrein Petroleum Company to undertake as much active prospecting as they are prepared to do. (6) Reviewing the question generally both from the point of view of Bahrein and of the British Empire, the Secretary for Mines is of opinion that no further concession should be granted at present. I|e agrees that from the technical point of view there are advantages in the operation of an oil field underjsingle ownership which means that an economical drilling programme can be adopted with the definite object of high oil recovery at low cost and at a rate adjusted to meet the market demand. It is considered however that it would be to the advantage both of the shaikh of Bahrein and of the British Empire to withhold further concessions at present as the concessionaires can be informed that their position will be reconsidered/reconsidered when they are in a position to show that they have carried out satisfactory development work on the property already conceded to them. Again, if a further concession is granted at this stage such a concession would finally exclude British Companies from participation, whereas if no concession is granted now it may be possible to secure some share to British Companies if oil isjdiscovered in conmercial quantities in the Bahrein Islands, Foreign Office, India Office, Admiralty, War Office, and Air Ministry.

Sir A i . 'jo v I have the hoacur to forward for your information ^ a copy of a letter without number dated the 22nd April 1932 from the Chief Local Representative of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited and my reply thereto. Upon my giving an interpretation of the clause^which I feel sure you will agree is the correct one,Major Holmes immediately forwarded his letter dated the 24th April requesting the Bahrain Government to change the reading of Oiiuse 9,Schedule 2. The matter was discussed with His Excellency Shaikh Hamad,and considerable difficulty was experienced in explaining the matter to him. 2. His Excellency was plainly bored by the details and observed that T By G-od,the important thing was that some benefit should be found T . He asked me what my advice v/as. I told him that if he adhered to the present wording the Company could defeat his hopes of increased revenue by closing down each well as it approached the 100 ton limit, and that there was nothing to stop them doing this. I also pointed out that until oil was found f in commercial quantities 1 ,the royalty would not rise above the Rs.10,000 rate now fixed and that it was not until 5 years had elapsed.that the G-overnment could force them to declare that oil had been so found or terminate the concession./y 3, His Excellency discussed the matter further with the Adviser and myself and finally gave the reply of which I enclose a copy. I had pointed out to him that the alter ation would require the concurrence of the Colonial Office and I had suggested that since they had drafted this clause it would 'be advantageous to take their advice upon the matter. His Excellency agreed with me 3 and,as will he seem from his letter,specially asks for guidance in so technical a matter. 4. My personal opinion is that which I gave the Shaikh. The meaning of the clause is evidently to force the Company to take out a mining license at the earliest possible opportunity. This they have no intention of doing and to prevent this they will close down each well as it approaches the 100 ton limit. The State has no recourse till 5 years have elapsed,and has no immediate financial gain,whereas by accepting the alteration they will gain something,thou^i they will have no means of checking their dues; nevertheless the Colonial Office must have inserted this clause with some special meaning and the problem,whiGh is strange to us,will no doubt be familiar to them. I regret I can offer no useful opinion on the arguments advanced by Major HoiLmes in his letters of the 22nd and 24th April for these are technical matters in which I have no experience. I have the honour to be Sir, Your Most Obedient Servant, Political Agent, Bahrain.22nd, April 1932. f o. His B. Ma^s Political Agent, bahrein. Dear Sir, tThe Baiirein Oil Concession (Dec.2-1925) I wish on 'behalf of The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited to request an interpretation of the purport of Clause IX, Schedule 2, of The Bahrein Oil Concession Agreement. Until the exact meaning of this Clause is clarified, the difficulty is present of deciding how the value of a well as an oil producer is to be guaged. It can not mean that if a well yielded 3-i tons of oil per day over a period of 30 days, in total over 100 tons, that The Company would be constrained to apply for a Mining Lease covering territory that would be useless for the purpose of oil production ? Such aj yield would not make a well commercially exploitable in fact it would prove it to be decideclly otherwise* My Company feel that this is not the intent or aim of Clause IX and is of the opinion that the meaning of the Clause would be much clarified and still retain the real intent of the Clause, if it were framed in different words to what it is at present. The Company considers that the aim of the Clause would be fully preserved find Uhe Company is persuaded that full justice would be done to the object ot the Clause,if the Clause were reframed in the following words:- -2- P.T.O.Bahrein. 22-4—1932. mm £ *** ' Clause IX , The right to win up to 100 (One hundred) tons of oil free of payment, and further quantities of oil on payment of the royalty per ton provided in the Mining Lease. The privileges in this Clause nay only be enjoyed by The Company during the perioct for which the Prospecting Licence or its extensions are granted or until The Company declare that oil has been discovered in commercially exploitable quanti ties, whichever is the shorter. 11 The above wording conveys clearly the interpre tation that The Company places upon the actual purpose of Clause IX. I may point out that the prospecting stage of the development of virgin oil territory is of the greatest import ance and anything that hinders The Company from acquiring the fullest information as regards the oil formation may be the cause of slowing up the advent of the actual production stage. It is important, so as not to retard the progress of The Company 1 s programme of prospecting and development work, that the interpretation of Clause IX, be made ?/ithout undue delay. May I therefore respectfully ask your early consideration of this request. I am. Sir. Your Obedient Servant.

Dear Sir, / v Please refer to jour letter of the 2&amp;id April 1932 regarding the interpretation of Clause 9,Schedule 2 of the Bahrain Oil Concession Agreerasit. 2, In my opinion the meaning of clause 9 is prefectly clear and the words obviously mean that when 100 tons of oil have been won from any particular well the Company are precluded from obtaining any further quantity without applying for a mining license. 3. The object of the clause is clearly to press the Company to take out a mining license at the earliest possible opportunity* If you wish the clause to be altered you will no doubt ask me formally to apply to the Bahrain Government to that effect.

The right to win up to 100 (One hundredd7 0 f free of payment, and further quantities of oil on payment of the royalty per ton provided in the Jiuirig Lease. The privileges in this Clause may only be enjoyed by The Company during tne period for whicii the Prospecting Licence or its exten sions are granted or until The Company declare that oil has been discovered in Commercially exploitable quantities, whichever is the shorter. 11 Wording of Clause 9, at present is as follows:- M Clause I a . The right to win up to 100 (One hundred) tons of oil free of payment and further quantities of oil on payment of tne royalty per ton provided in the Mining Lease, but on condi tion that the Company shall apply for a Mining Lease in respect of each area in which work is proceeding as soon as more than 100 tons of oil are won from one single bore hole within it. w 2 - P.T.O.■&lt;0 ' 2 Banreiru 24-4-1952. A 1h I have explained in ray letter of April 22nd # 1932 the difficulties that Clause 9, presents as it now reads in the Concession Agreement. The object in making the request that the wording be changed is not to delay the Company entering Schedul of the Goncessiopi Agreement. The Company venture to predict that to change Clause 9, as asked will hasten rather than delay the Mining Lease stage of the Con cession Agreement being reached. I remain, Sir. Your Obedient Servant^ Chief Representative: The Bahrein Petroleum Co.LtdCopy of a letter dated the 22nd Dhil Hajj 1350 from His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin Isa al Khalifa to the Political Agent,Bahrain, ith reference to your enquiry about our wish in regard to the matters mentioned by Major Holmes,representative of 32nd April 1932# We have received copies of these two letters and after considering the matter we infom you of our opinion. «ith regard to the extension of the prospecting license for two years after the completion of the present time,which is in about 7 months,we wish to see some result from the woi4c of the Oil Company because they have now held the concession for many years# e thing therefore that an extension of two years is very long but we are willing to grant an extension of one year. ith regard to altering Clause 9 of the prospecting license according to the letter of Taj or Holmes. As thia alteration is not injurious to us,we are willing to allow this alteration, accordingly the Company will be able to obtain any amount more than 100 tons of oil but they must pay the royalty on every ton after the first 100 tons. ith reference to these two matters which we mention atoBe as you are aware we have small knowledge of matters concerning oil so we request that you will ask the Jion ? ble the Political Resident in the fersian Gulf to obtain on our behalf the advice of the Colonial Office in London in tkese tv/o matters. e would be obliged if the matter might be settled as soon as possible because as you are aware we wish very much to see some financial result from the Oil Company.

I enclose for your information a copy of a letter I have received from the Bahrain Petroleum Oompany. I went out there yesterday and found that they had received permission to continue drilling and were now cleaning out the hole preparatory to starting. Apparently since the date of this letter signs are somewhat more hopeful and large bubbles of gas have been escaping through the water which trapped it and blowing the oil all over the rig. I saw the marks of it up to a height of about 8 feet. Skinner himself seemid more hopeful and said he thought the conditions would improve as they got further down. ion|ble Lt Gol.H.V.Biscoe. ,I.A., Political Resident in the rersian G-ulf, Bush ire.Copy of letter dated 5th May 1932 from the Fields Manager, Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited to J.M.Russell Esquire, Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited,Bahrain. For your information our well at Jebel DuMian has just completed a 48 hour test previous to which all water was bailed from the hole. During the 48 hours oil raised in the casing from a depth of 1080 feet to 745 feet which means that 8 tons of oil entered the hole in 2 full days or an average of 4 tons a day. There is not enough gas to flow the oil which means that production would only be obtained by pumping and the maximum amount obtainable per day would be about 4 tons. This is obviously practically nothing. So I am today recommending my Principals that we continue drilling to see if there are more productive horizons below. I would thank you to pass this information on to the interested officials of the Bahrain G-overnment.Mail ■ ^ Confidential. British Residency &lt;Sc Consul ate-General, Bushire, the 16th May 1932. / I have the honour to forward herewith two letters \lsH ■ with their enclosures received from the Political Agent, Bahrain, 2, It will be seen from the first letter that the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited have applied for a two years' extension of their prospecting license, and that Shaikh Hamad proposes to limit the extension to one year. Prom the second letter it will be seen that the Company seek a modifi- I V 5 d cation of Clause 9, Schedule Tl of their concession. J T 3, The object of this clause, as at present worded, was presumably to compel the Company to take out a mining license as soon as possible, and, while I am entirely un versed in such matters, it was presumably considered that the production of 100 tons of oil from one well would be adequate to enable them to farm an opinion regarding the value of the well. The view that seems to be held by the Company is that this test is not adequate, and that before they can form an opinion of the value of a bore it is necessary to extract more than 100 tons. It is true, as the Political Agent states, that the Company could defeat the Shaikh's hopes of increased revenue by closing down each well as it approached the 100-ton limit, but presumably to have to bore another well would be a costly and laborious proceeding, and they naturally .... Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, London.A 11* r ^ naturally would prefer to exploit the existing bore than to be compelled to make fresh ones. If then the production of 100 tons is not sufficient to enable them to judge of the value of a bore, the Company's request for a modification of the clause would seem to be reasonable. On a technical matter of this nature, howeverj I am not competent to express any opinion and would therefore request the instructions of His Majesty ! s Government as to the advice that I should give to the Shaikh. 4. Since writing the above I have received from the Political Agent, Bahrain, a copy of a letter from the Company informing him of the latest developments of the outflow of oil, which I forward herewith. It would seem that there is a possibility of oil shortly being found in exploitable quantities. ryf- and that a decision regarding the interpretation of Clause 9 rv may be needed in the near future. I shall be grateful, there fore, if I could receive the instructions of His Majesty^ Government at an early date. I am sending a copy of this Despatch with its enclosures to the Government of India.

Last year Major Holmes arrived on the 25th May and left on the 13th June. He remained absent in England until the 11th November of the same year and left again for Kuwait on the 24th April3,2 He remained away until the 11th June when he returned for one week and he has now left for Europe with the intention of returning sometime in November. The correspondence regarding the necessity for the existence of a local representative (who must be a British subject) was discussed at length,principally between the Residency and the Colonial Office and your file has probably fuller details than mine. I personally do not consider it possible for a man of Major Holmes T age to remain here uninterruptedly for 5 years and if he attempted to do so he would be committing suicide. He has now given me a letter instructing me to send all correspondence for him to Russell of Mespers,but he does not mention whether this is for correspondence in his capacity as representative of the Bahrain Petroleum Company or of the Eastern G-eneral Syndicate I find it a little difficult at times in distinguishing betv/een these two incarnations. At the moment we get on quite well without any local representative and since we are fortunate in the present Fields Manager, little occurs to disturb the peace. When, however,their operations extend and bring them into closer contact Y /ith the public the need will be felt and we shall requirerequire some one to act as liaison officer between the Company and the Agency. So far the Americans have shown no desire to enter into local politics hut one cannot say that this will always he the case. he Hon^hle Lt Gol.Sir Hugh Y.Biscoe,K.B.E. ,I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bush ire..

In paragraph 0 of the schedule to that Agreement the Bahrain Petroleum Company undertook at all times to maintain in Bahrain an official to be called the 'Chief Local RepresentatiTe ,&gt; of the Company who should be the sole representatlTe of the Company empowered to deal direct with the local authorities and population, and it was stipulated that for the first five years after the said Bahrain Petro leum Company Limited started to operate in Bahrain ••••••• •••••• their ^Chief Local HepresentatlTe * should be Major Frank Holmes* The date on which the assignment was executed by the Eastern and General Syndicate was the 1st August 1930, and from that date it was incumbent upon them to maintain a Chief Local Representative.

ThusThus in one year and 11 months Major Holmes has spent 6 months and 14 days in Bahrain, and he has now left for England again# and 9 I understand, does not propose returning for three or four months. Therefore in about Zi years he will roughly hare spent 6 months in Bahrain# It is clear that the Bahrain Petroleum Company are in no way fulfilling their undertaking* Ueither do I consider that so long as Holmes is their Chief Local Representative is it possible for them to do so, for he certainly cannot remain in Bahrain throu^xout the year for a period of five years* I think we might accord them a reason^ able latitude in this respect, and that if their Chief Local Representative got away from Bahrain for, say, a couple of months in the height of the summer, as the Political Agent does, nothing need be said, but Holmes has, as you know, other irons in the fire, and it is clear that he has no serious intention of spending even a reasonable amount of time at Bahrain* Holmes has now written a letter to Prior instructing him to send all correspondence for him to the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, but does not mention whether this is correspondence in his capacity as representative of the Bahrain Petroleum Company or of the Eastern and General Syndi* cate, and Prior states that he finds it a little difficult at times to distinguish between these two incarnations. Hitherto the matter has not been one of much importance* The Bahrain Petroleum Company has been engaged in preliminary operations and there has been little need for correspondence between them and the local authorities* How, however, they have struck oil and will presumably extend their operations and it may be anticipated that there will in the near future be many mattere to arrange between the Company and the Shaikh, and it eeeme eeeential that they ehould fulfil their undertaking ...q* -3- undertaking and maintain at all times a Chief Xtocal Hepresentative in Bahrain# I suggest therefore that,if you concur with this view ; the failure of the Company to fulfil their undertaking should be brought to their notice, and that it might be represented to them that it is most Improbable that a man of Major Holmes* age and physique can possibly remain in Bahrain continuously for fire years, apart from the fact that he has other interests elsendiere and that therefore it is desirable that some one else should be appointed, who can carry out the duties of the post. The present fields Manager, an American, by name Skinner, is an exceedingly pleasant man to deal with and if there is any difficulty about finding an Englishman to act as Chief Local Hepresentative, X personally see no objection to Skinner being appointed, but I do definite* ly think that the time has arrived at which we should insist upon the Company fulfilling their undertaking, though, as I have said above, if the Chief Local Kepresentative absents himself for, say, two months in the year in the height of the summer, I do not think any serious exception need be taken to it« I am sending a copy of this letter to India*^jv Of 193 Bushire t the ist July 1932, The Hesidency, B.U # ^o«447«@ of 1932. £ X enclose a copy of a deiai-officlal &gt;• 446-5'of letter that Z hare addressed to Parkinson of '7/32. the Colonial Office regarding the appointment of Chief Local Representative of the Bahrain Petroleum Company* t H«A • l* *lletoalfe t lsq« §0*1 • • $ u.v.o.

It may interest you to see how concessions are acquired in this part of the world. I had heard sometime ago that Major Holmes gave Shaikh Abdulla a private interest in the Oil Company on the understanding that he would.get him the oil concession. Belgrave has now seen the paper dated,! think,1923 in which Major Holmes undertakes to give him a share of a half of lyC in the company,provided he obtained the concession for them within the space of a year. This was again extended for another year and since the concession was granted within this period ? Shaikh AbduLla 'became entitled to his one half of ll share. He is now wondering how he is going to get it and whether he should ask to have the actual shares handed over to him. This may help to explain why the Eastern and G-eneral Syndicate were successful where the Anglo Persian Oil Company failed! he Hon 1 hie Lt Col.Sir Hugh Y.Biscoe. ,K,B.S., Political He si dent in the Persian Gulf, Bush ire.i48/3; .21 Part 2, i\i io\v &lt;- ni PETROLEUM DEPARTMENT, (MINES DEPARTMENT), DEAN STANLEY STREET 9 MILLBANK, WESTMINSThiR, LONDON, S.1M.

No.98035/32 of June 11th, on the subject of the Bahrein oil concession, I am directed by the Secretary for Mines to offer the following observations for the information of Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe Lister;- (1) It will be recalled that under the terms of the t $1 ^Agreement, a prospecting licence could be granted over ^areas to be selected by the Company with the approval of the Shaikh'• The Political Heaident, in his despatch of July 22nd, 1931, said that the Shikh had approved the grant of a licence and that he (the Political Resident) had authorised the execution of an Agreement granting the licence, a copy of which would be forwarded in due course. As no copy of this Agreement appears to hnve been received, the Petroleum Department are not aware of what area is covered by the prospecting licence and would be glad if the Political Resident could be requested to furnish a copy without delay# (2) The terms of the Eastern and General Syndicate's concession of December 2nd, 1925, are in several respects unsatisfactory, and Clause IX of the second Schedule is an example of one of the unsatisfactory features. It is difficult at this stage to suggest a wholesale revision of the Agreement, but it is considered that some improvement could be effected and possibly one or two points covered, either during the revision of this Clause, or when the lease is finally drawn up. er Secretary of State, Colonial Office, (3)/ Downing Street, s.w.i.(3) The views expressed in the despatch of May 16th, 1932, from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, appear to be subject to modification in the light of his telegram of June 4th, reporting that the Bahrein Petroleum Company had struck oil and that the well was making over 70 tons per day. If this rate of output is confirmed, the Company will prohahly shut in the well and proceed to drill further test wells in order to prove the extent of the oil structure, with a view to selecting an area for a mining lease. (4) To enable the Company to carry out further test drilling, some extension of the period of the Prospectinga License is desirable, and the Secretary for Mines agrees that an extension of one year might be given, which could be reviewed later when it is seen what progress the Company have been able to make. (5) It should be recognised that the more prospecting drilling that is carried out, within the period allowed, the better, but from the Shaikh's point of view, the most important consideration is how soon the Company can be induced to declare that 11 oil has been discovered in commercially exploitable quantities'• If the Company produce oil during the period of their Prospecting Licence, this will be to the advantage of the Shaikh in that it will enable him to counter any suggestion from the Company that oil has not been found in 'commercially exploitable quantities'• (6) It is not unusual in prospecting licences to provide that a limited quantity of oil may be produced free of royalty for testing and experimental purposes. The provision contained in the latter part of Clause IX is,however, not satisfactory. It might not be reasonable in all cases to expect a Company to apply for a mining lease ' as soon as more than 100 tons of oil are won from one single borehole'* for/(8)/ for it is possible that this oil might only 'be obtained by baling or pumping over a prolonged period. Under such conditions the well would be of little value except as an indication of the occurrence of oil. Clause IX, as at present warded, states that the Company shall apply for a mining lease in respect of each area in which work is proceeding as soon as more than 100 tons of oil are won from one single borehole within it. In the first place, it is not clear what is meant by the word ^area 11 in the above context, and secondly, this Clause, if applied literally, would have the effect of limiting the number of boreholes under prospecting licence to 3, since under the provisions of the Agreement the lease of 100,000 acres must be taken out in not more than 3 blocks. It would clearly not be to the advantage of the Shaikh to have the number of test boreholes thus limited. (7) The Secretary for Kines notes that the Agreement contains no provision, either in the prospecting licence or the mining lease, to compel the Company to furnish returns^ for the purpose of royalty assessment, of the amount of oil produced, and it is suggested that in agreeing to an amendment of Clause IX the Shaikh should require the inclusion of such a provision, and that facilities should be afforded either to the Shaikh or his representative to check the returns. A suggested form of amendment to cover this point is enclosed herewith. It is presumably the ^ - r- absence of such a provision which the Political Resident at Bahrein had in mind in his despatch of May 3rd, 1932, when he stated that 'The State..•. will have no means of checking their dues'*.(8) In view of the above considerations, the secretary for Mines consider© that the Coiapany's request for a modification of Clause IX on the lines suggested is one which it may be desirable to meet., and recommends that it should be agreed to with the addition as to provision of returns and the right to check such returns referred to in the preceding paragraph# (9) Copies of this letter are being sent to the Foreign Office# India Office, Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry.

It is moreover understood that he does not propose to return to Bahrein for three or four months. Thus, in a period of 2i years Major Holmes will have spent little more than six months in all in Bahrein, In these circumstances, it can hardly be contended that the provisions of Condition C are being fulfilled, is realised that temporary absence for the purpose of relaxation, home leave and health, must be allowed but it is clearly desirable that the Company's local representative should remain more or less permanently in Bahrein, This point was brought to the notice of the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited in paragraph 3 of this department•sDepartment's letter Ho. 79178/30 of the 15th of November,1930,with a request that the Syndicate would agree that Major Holmes should reside at Bahrein for a minimum period of nine months in each year % l^o reply has 'been received to that letter or to the subsequent letter on the same subject Ho»89035/31 of the 14th In view of the discovery of petroleum at Bahrein,the question of the continuous presence of the Company's Chief Local Representative in Bahrein assume added importance and 1 am to enquire whether the Bahrein Petroleum Company is now able to give an assurance that Major Holmes will reside there for a period minimum Jpf nine months in each calendar year. of July 1931. i am.

Mr. Ballantyne and Mr, Hamilton or toa Bahrein F'etroleuni Company called with reference to our two letters of the 6th August. ^ jilthregard to the letter^concsming tiie revision of Clause IX of the concession Agreacent, they wanted to know what had happened. I told them that the Resident had been inlomea that there was no objection to the erteneion of their concession for one year, and, when/they faia that they did not think one year woula be enough, I pointed out that they ware fully at liberty to apply for an additional extension, and suggested that they should do so stating the reasons fully, and that they should put up the application locally but send us a reasoned letter which we could consider here and senti out to the -iesident. I was careful to explain that I could not comnit anybody as to whether the further extension woula be granted, sand in particular could not commit the Sheikh of Bahrein. Mr. Hamilton said that they had no objection whatever to the principle of the measurement of the oil. in fact they fully agreed that some such procedure was necessary, but they did not particularly like the form of words adopted. He said that they were quite prepared to agree that the oil should be measured in a ccordanca with the general oilfielo practice, and that the Jieikh or his repreeentativs should have the right to check the measurements, but he foresaw that there might be asms technical difficulty In regard to the method to be adopted, in particular if somebody suggested the use of unreliable meters/0) ■v, iaaters or soma tiling of that kina, wMch migiit lead to consltiarable friction «blch h« was anxious to avoid! I suggseted that they tfiould put their views into writing and that we could then consider the «hole bualness alter referring it to the Petroleum Department, by whose advice we must of course be guided on euch a technical isatter. They aaw this point of view and agreed to do ao. Ihey asked whether they were to understand that the addition of these provisions was to be a sort of ould oro quo for the aaienaniant of Clause IX, adding that they didn't really object to Clause IX as it stood though It was admittedly unsatisfactory. After looking at the letroleum o 'Department letter of the 20th June, I said that our Intention was to supply an admitted want in the concession which didn't contain any provision for meusurecent at all, and that we thought this would be a suitable opportunity. They agreed that this was only reasonable. The upshot then is that they will write giving their views as regards the draft clause ana making such general coasmants as they think suitable. I gave them to understand that other Departments will have to be consulted and that some delay is inevitable, and that In the end the thing will have to go to the sheikh. With regard to the other letter, they explained that it had come upon them as rather a bolt from the blue, our two previous letters had been sent, not to the Bahrein Petroleum Company, but to the Saetern and General syndicate and the syndicate had not passed them on to the Company. I gathered that they were not wedded to Major Holmes but considered that he was persona grata with this Office, and therefore they had not raised any question about his various/various absences from Bahrein or hla appointing soinebody else to act for him, thinking that this had all been arranged between Major Holmes and the Colonial office (or 80 they said). If fcajor Hotoas la removed they asked who would be acceptable, to which I said that 1 could not answer that question, that I thought it would be for them to put up names and, in any case, the authorities in the Gulf would have to be consulted. I undertook to let Mr. Ballantyne have copies of the previous letter about fcajor Holmes and have done so accordingly. (3d.)

So far as this Department is concerned, the alteration suggested by the Company, which taJce^ the form of inserting the actual amount of royalty payable instead of a reference to Clause 8 of the Mining Lease, appears to be unobjectionable, but I am to request that the views of the Secretary for Mines may be obtained upon the subject. 3.

Copy /forwarded to the Political Agent, Bahrein under P.L .No. 814-3 of 2Bth October 1932.98035/22. Downing St., 50th August 1932. Dear Mr.Ballantyne, With reference to your letter N0.3.B.1932, of the 18th of August, we are consulting the other Departments of State with regard to the revision of Clause 9 of the second Schedule and the provisions required for measuring and checking the amount of oil. It seems to me that something will have to 'be added to the second Schedule anyhow. Under Clause 9 as it stands you are hound to apply for a mining lease in respect of each area (what the 'area 11 means is nowhere stated) as soon as 100 tons of oil has been got out of a single bore hole. If the area is over the whole territory of Bahrein then your operations would 'be seriously handicapped by strict insistence on the Clause as it stands. The provisions for measurement might very well, as you suggest, be put into the mining lease, but it would surely be best to amend Clause 9 so as to make it run something like 'the right to win up to 100 tons of oil free of payment, and further quantities of oil on payment of the royalty per ton provided for in Article 8 of the mining lease and calculated in the manner laid down in that Article'. You will be hearing from us officially on the subject, but I think it best to send you this semi official acknowledgment of your letter. Yours faithfully, (Sd.)J.E.W .Flood.

I have to acknowledge receipt oif Mr. J.E.W.Flood 1 s l^er &gt; 98035/32 addressed to me under date the 30th August 19 32. This Company is quite ready to accede to Mr .Hood's suggestion of a further modification of Claa3e_9_? f the Second Schedule. It thinks, however, that the Clause would be clearer, if it read thus:- 'The right to win up to 100 tons of ^ further quantities of oil on payment of a royalty of Ra 3 8.0 ner ton of net crude oil got and saved (i.e. after deducting water and foreign substances and il required for the customary operations of the company s installations in the Sheikhs Terntorxes) . There would follow as a sub -clause a copy of the new Measurement Clause for the Mining Lease. I assume you would desire to retain the paragraph reading:- htvi &amp; T &gt;riviieces in this Clause may only be enjoyed by the SSe or 1 its 'extensions 2e gr^efo/unt if the® Company so, this would come on as a second suh-clause. This paragraph does not seem to me to have now any particular meaning or significance, and I suggest it might be dropped. I should be glad to hear that the foregoing suggestions are acceptable to H.M.Government. I would not agree with Mr.Hood's interpretation of the existing Clause 9 of the Second Schedule if the point came up for discussion. I am &amp;c., (Sd.)

Sir /.i'7 I have the honour to er to the correspondence ending with jour telegram No:7i6 dated the Zndi November 1932 regarding the extension of the Bahrain Petroleum Company T s prospecting license and to say that there appears to be a misunderstanding regardiiig this matter. 2. The first mention of the specification of any a^eas occurs in Petroleum Department's letter No:21,Part 2 to the address of the Under Secretary of State,of v/hich a copy was ^*7 forwarded me with Bushire Residency endorsement No:502-S dated the 15th July 1932 &gt; and in endorsement No:550-S dated the 6th August 1932 I was instructed that the agreement extending the license should specify these areas. 3. My letter No:0/161 dated the 24:th September 1932 was perhaps incorrectly expressed. It should have said that ,T I will endeavour to have the areas specified' and not have stated definitely that they would be specified without con sulting the Bahrain Petroleum Company f s representative,Major Holmes,who,hov/ever,was in England at the time. 4. I enclose a copy of a letter f^om Major Holmes in which he explains the point of view of the Company,a view which in my opinion is the correct one. In the prospecting license there is no limitation of the area at the Company 1 s disposal, 0 which presumably extems to the area mentioned in Article 1, viz f, the whole of the territories under his (the Shaikh's)Ill &amp; -2- control' 1 . The earliest mention of a restricted area is in Article 5 which, refers to the mining lease alone. 5. Since there is no restriction upon the areas the Company are allowed to select for prospecting^they will naturally select the whole of the islands. Why any mention of areas should have been made at this point I confess I cannot under stand. It is / however,not the only enigma this concession contains. 6. If you agree with the view expressed,namely,that the words n over areas selected by the Gompany' must include the whole of the territory of Bahrain,and that a map is therefore superfluous,! would be glad to be informed of this at an early date as the Bahrain Petroleum Oompany are anxious to have the extension signed as early as possible. I have the honour to be Sir Your Most Obedient Servant PoJJbtical Agent Bahrain., 001 Gopy' of a letter dated the 1st November 1932 from Major F. HoLnes,Chief Local Representative of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited,Bahrain,to the Political Agent,Bahrain. The question of a Map - in connection with the Bahrain Oil Concession granted on December 2nd 1925 - does not arise until the termination of the prospecting license and/or its extension. The Company has then to delineate the area of 100,000 acres over which the Mining Lease will be granted. A map clearly marking the areas comprised within the 100,000 acres must be attached to the Company's application for the Mining Lease. The Prospecting License or any extensions thereof comprehend the whole area of the Bahrain Islands and,therefore, the only map the Company can produce of the prospecting areas is a map of the whole of the Islands of Bahrain.p. 2. ivxi PBTROLSIM DEPARTMENT, 21.

Sir, 4- |m^ I am directed by the Secretary for Mines to refer to Mr. Flood's letters, Ho, 98035/32, of 30th August, 27th September, and 6th October, enclosing copies of letters from the Bahrein Petroleum Company in regard to the terms of their concession in Bahrein, and to request you to convey to Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister the following observations thereon. The Secretary for Mines has no objection to the smendments proposed by the Company to the suggested provisions for measuring crude oil won, with the exception that in consequence of revisions suggested by the Company, he considers that the following words should be added at the end of the revised clause ~ n In any event the Shaikh shall have the right to publish particulars of the total output of crude oil and natural gas\ Consideration has been given to the further suggestions made in the letter from the Bahrein Petroleum k \ Company of 5th September, 1952, as to the amendment of 4 Glauae IX of the second Schedule to the Concession and subject to the following condition, I m to say that the Secretary for Mines is prepared to concur in the suggestions, including the deletion of the paragraph which reads 'The privileges etc.... shorter 8 . Under the present form of Clause IX the Shaikh had the right to require the Company to apply for a Mining Lease in respect one bore hole. While it is now agreed that this provision of an area as soon as 100 tons of oil had been won from nder Secretary of State, Colonial Office, Downing Street, is/ S.f.lis not entirely satisfactory and an amendment of the Article is desirable, the position under the revised Article will be that the Company might ha.ve an appreciable production of oil without having at once to take out a Mining Lease. On this production they will pay royalty, but it is conssidered that it should be made clear that the payments in respect of royalty will be in addition to the annual payment of Rs. 10,000 provided for in Article ?I of the main Agreement. The position would be met if at the beginning of the last sentence of that Article the following words were inserted:- ^Except for payment in respect of royalty which shall become payable under Article II of the Second Schedule to this Agreement in respect of oil won in excess of 100 tons.' A consequential amendment of the mining lease in regard to this point ought also to be carried out, because until the Company make their declaration that oil is being produced in comnercial quantities the dead rent payable under the mining lease, is the same as that payable under the prospecting licence, and unless the mining lease and prospecting licence are brought into line the position of the Shaikh mi^ht be worse in this respect under the mining lease, than under the prospecting licence. Once the Company have declered that oil has been found in commercial quantities they undertake, under Article II of the lease, that the amount received by the Shaikh in respect of royalty shall not be less than Hs*30,000 per annum. It will also be necessary to provide in the mining lease a clause for the mea.8urement of oil similar to that now suggested for the prospecting licence. Certain other alterations may be necessary when the mining/|1^ v.\(^ mirijig lease is actually granted, and I am to suggest that it would perhaps be sufficient if the Company were informed at this stage that His Majesty 1 s Goverrxrient concur in the proposed amendments (subject to the alterations suggested above), on the understanding that it would be necessary to make certain consequential aiflendments to the mining; lease when this is granted to the Goinpany. As regards ti» proposal that tha prospecting licence should be extended for a further year, i.cu co the 2nd December, 1934, it wixl be recalled that by tne letter ox the 20th June last from this Departeent, the Secretary for Mines agreed that an extension of one year might be given which could be reviewed later wiien it was seen what progress the Company had been able to make. This would give the Company until December 2nd, 1933, for their prospecting operations, and the Secretary for Mines is reluctant to agree to any further extension at present until it is seen what progress the Company has been able to make. ihe Company do not appear to have furnished any detailed report on their operations or indicated what future drilling prograrme they have in mind. The Secretary for Mines considers, therefore, that in view of the length of time which has already elapsed since the Agreement was entered into, it would be preferable to inform the Company that any question o-- the further extension of the period of their prospecting licence must be reviewed af ain later in, say, April, 1933, and that then detailed information of the progress they h-ve made, and of their immediate drilling programme should be supplied with any further application they may make.

It is thist the Bahrain Petroleum Company Ltd. applied for an extension (one year ) of the Prospecting License (being Schedule IT of the Concession Agreement). The Political Agent, Bahrain, informed me that a question had been raised - I think from India - that a map should be attached showing the area the Company desired to prospect under the extension* It is only under Schedule III that a map is necessary or callefl for, Schedule III being the Mining Lease section of the Agreement which is not reached until the area to be chosen - 100,000 acres - is delineated. The Company is still operating under Schedule IT, ( that is the Prospecting Licence). The Political Agent, Bahrain, was recently in communication with the Political Resident with a view to clearing up the map question - the only map we could give is one covering the whole of the Bahrain Islands. I would be much obliged if you would ask the Political Resident if the matter has been cleared up. The Prospecting Licence - under which the Company is at present working - expires on December 2nd 1932. The Company is most anxious about the position, and if the Political Resident could tell me how the question stands - if cleared up - I could go tomorrow to Bahrain and procure the Shaikh of Bahrain's signature to the extension. The extension has already been passed by the PoliticalPolitical Resident. I am sorry to trouble you at th.is busy moment.

This Company raises no objection to the Sheikh of Bahrein publishing such figures as he may be required by law to publish from time to time. It was to this end that I was instructed to add to the so-called Measurement Clause, the words:- H Such accounts shall be treated as confidential by the Sheikh, with the exception of such figures therein as he may be required by law to publish. 11 In view of the foregoing explanation, it is hoped that the asked for addition at the end of the provisions for the measuring and checking of oil, will be withdrawn. Concerning Clause 4 of your letter under reply, the Company agrees the proposed addition, reading 41 Except for payments in respect of royalty which shall become payable under Article IX of the Second Schedule to this Agreement in respect of oil won in excess of 100 tons n to Article VX of the main agreement. agAs to Clause 5 of the said letter, it is appreciated that the agreed proTisionf for measuring and ehecking of oil must 'be inserted also in the Third Schedule, i.e. in the form of Mining Lease to he granted when the time comes for that. This Company, however, Tiewe with alarm the suggestion contained in such letter that the exact terms of certain consequential amendments to the Mining Lease, which will prohahly 'be entailed by the adoption of the said provisions for measuring and ehecking of oil, be considered when the Mining Lease is oeing granted to the ¥ ■ / * Company# This Company feels that although such is not tne contention of His Majesty's Government, this wouM, in fact, leave the form of the Mining Lease open to diaounsion at the time the Company propoasd to take it up. This, whether it be in the favour of the Company or not, certainly involves present uncertainty as to the exact form of the Mining Lease. From a practicel working point of view, such uncertainty cannot he allowed to prevail* In the view of this Company, there are no oonsequential alterations snd you are asked to have the draft examined in order that there may toe no question outstanding on this point. This Company suggests that the modifying Agreement he now put into draft, settled hy Mr. J.H.

Sir, i ' I am directed by Secretary Sir Piiilip Cunliffe-Lister to refer to your letter (3/B/1932) of the 5th of September and previous correspondence regarding the application of the Bahrein Petroleum Company for the revision of Article IX of the Second Schedule to their Concession Agreement and the proposed addition of provisions for measuring and checking the amount of oil produced for the purpose of royalty assessment. 2. As regards the provisions for the measuring and checking of oil, His Majesty's Government are prepared to accept the revised draft provisions which accompanied your letter of the 18th August, subject to the addition at the end of the following words 'In any event the Sheikh shall have the right to publdsh particulars of the total annual output of crude oil and natural gas'. 3. Subject to the observations contained in paragraph 4 below. His Majesty's Government are also prepared to concur in the further amendments to Clause IX of the Second Schedule suggested in the Company^ letter of the 5th September, including the deletion of the paragraph beginning 'The provisions in this Clause etc •. . M 4. It is possible that under Article IX, revised as ballantyhb, esq.as at present contemplated, the Company might he in a position to produce an appreciable quantity of oil without taking out a Mining Lease. On this quantity of oil a royalty will he payable, hut it is considered that it should he made clear that the payments in respect of royalty will he in addition to the annual payment of Rs♦10,000 provided for in Article VI of the main Agreement. To this end it is suggested that the following sentence should he inserted at the beginning of the last sentence of that Article 'Except for payments in respect of royalty which shall become payable under Article IX of the Second Schedule to this Agreement in respect of oil won in excess of 100 tons...........' 5. The amendment to Article VI of the main Agreement, and the revision of Article IX of the Second Schedule in the manner now proposed, will probably entail certain consequential amendments to the Mining Lease, but it is considered that the exact terms of these can be more conveniently considered when the Mining Lease is being granted to the Company. In any case it will be necessary to provide in the Mining Lease a clause for the checking and measurement of oil similar to that now to be included in the Prospecting Licence. 6. On hearing that your Company is prepared to agree to the further amendments suggested in this letter, the necessary steps will be taken to inform the Sheikh of Bahrain of the views of His Majesty^ Government in the matter.

Major Prank Holmes, Manama, Ba-hrein, Dear Sir, I have received the following telegram from Mr, R.C. Stoner:- 'Advise best price for P.O.B. Bahrein fuel oil for steam outfit and point of delivery.' to which I answered:- 'Pacilities necessary and difficulties connected therewith make importation fuel oil out of question. Suggest using electricity until modification Clause IX allows use of Bahrein crude oil, or have L .IT. Hamilton arrange with Colonial Office use of Bahrein crude oil pending alteration of Clause IX.' There is one steam drilling outfit now en route, and possibly another will be shipped shortly, or is already en route. It will take about 20 barrels of oil per 24 hours to furnish fuel for each boiler settin and it is obviouslytoo expensive a proposition to take delivery of fuel oil 2-g or 3 miles off shore and then-haul it to our locations in trucks. We had intended using our own crude oil for fuel but this will be impossible pending proper altera tion of Clause IX, or unless Hamilton can make some arrangement with the Colonial Office, which will allow the use of crude oil from our wells pending the clarification of Clause IX. In the meantime, I propose to use electricity which will be much slower in moving from one location to another than would steam equipment. Also there will be no possibility of running two strings of tools, because—-sa because our company would not be willing to ship in another expensive Diesel electric outfit at this time, You can plainly see from the above that the delay in making certain desired alterations in the Contract will slow up our work considerably, I suggest that you point out this fact to the Shaikh and the Political people in the Persian Gulf.

WESTMINSTER, LOEDOU, S.W.I. 23rd DecemlDer, 1932, l Sir, p f'' I am directed 'by/the Secretary f^or Mines to / refer to your letters of 3rd, 12th and 20th December, Ho. 98035/Part II/32, with regard to the revision of the Bahrein Petroleum Company 1 s concession, and to offer the following ohservations for the information of Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, 2, With regard to the draft Indenture enclosed with Mr. Ballantyne's letter of 2nd December, the Secretary for Mines sees no reason why the Agreement to amend the Prospecting Licence should not now be completed, subject to the following modifications (a) The wording of Clause (2) requires amendment by addition of the words 'the Second Schedule to' after the word 'of' in line 2. The Article IX. referred to is in the Second Schedule (Prospecting Licence) and not in the main Agreement. (b)lt is suggested that the words 'and also in Schedule 3 thereof immediately after Article VIII.' in lines 3 - 5 of Clause (3) should be omitted for the reason indicated below. (c) The two new Articles might be numbered IXA. and IXB. With Ler Secretary of State, .onial Office, Downing Street, S.W.I.With these alterations the Agreement would then deal only with alterations to the Prospecting Licence, and could 'be accepted without further delay. 3, As regards the Mining Lease, while on the one hand the Petroleum Bepartitent would not wish to press the point that any alterations in the present form should 'be left to he settled when the Company make their application for such a Lease, they would suggest on the other hand that His Majesty 1 s Government should not accept the position that the form attached to the present Agreement is unalterable. If necessary, it can he pointed out to the Company that they have asked for favourable consideration to be given to them in connection with their numerous applications for extension of time and upon the matter of the alteration of the Prospecting Licence which is now under consideration, and the Secretary for Mines sees no reason why the Company should not be prepared to meet the views of the Colonial Office in its capacity of adviser to the Sheikh in regard to reasonable amendments in the form of Mining Lease appended to the original Agreement. As regards these amendments, it will be practicable for the Petroleum Department in the near future to indicate the alterations which it would consider desirable to have made. It is not thought that any of the alterations will be of a character which the Company is likely to find difficulty in accepting • 4, The following points already arise as a result of alterations which have been made or are the subject of the proposals now under discussion;- (a)(a) The clause as regards payment of royalty on amounts of crude oil won in excess of 100 tons which it is now proposed to insert in the Prospecting Licence should he carried through into Article III. of the Mining Lease, and these provisions made applicable until the Company has declared that oil has 'been found in commercially exploitable quantities and the minimum royalty of 30,000 rupees per annum becomes operative, ('b) The measuring clause will have to 'be inserted. The Company propose that this should he done in the proposed supplementary Agreement now under consideration, hut it is considered preferable to deal with this along with the other alterations which are considered necessary in the Mining Lease, (c) The Agreement of June, 1930, as regards the modified form of British Control clause provides that these conditions are to be inserted in the Mining Lease, (d) The Air Ministry in their letter of the U ^ 13th May, 1929, have already asked thet provision should be made in the Mining Lease as regards keeping clear a landing ground for aeroplanes on the Northern extremity of Bahrein Island. (e) There is also the question whether provision ought not to be made giving the Sheikh the right of pre-emption during emergencies, and requiring that a proportion of the oil should be refined in Bahrein or British territory, 5, The other points which the Petroleum Department would wish to raise are rather less important in character. TheThe discussion of these various points may, however, take a certain amount of time, and the Secretary for Mines considers that the Company would 'be well advised to accept an Agreement modifying the Prospecting Licence now in order that their operations may he allowed to continue, it 'being understood that the alterations to the Mining Lease will be taken up with the Company at an early date . 6, Copies of this letter are being sent to the foreign Office, India Office and the Admiralty, I am, etc., (3gd„) P.C.

Decemlser, 1932, cj p. ^ i Gentlemen, 1 I am directed by Secretary oir Philip Cunliffe-Lister to refer to your letter of the 2nd December in which you enclosed printed copies of a draft of the modifying agreement suggested in regard to your prospecting licence, and to state that it is generally acceptable to His Majesty , s Government, subject to the minor alterations set out below, 2, It is considered advisable that the new Supplementary Agreement should refer to the prospecting licence only, since it is probable that further alterations will be suggested in the mining lease, and it would therefore appear desirable that the reference to the third Schedule, which appears in paragraph 3, should be deleted. With regard to Article II, it should be noted that the Article IX to which reference is made is in the second Schedule to the Agreement and not in the main Agreement, and accordingly the words, 'the Second Schedule to' should be inserted after the word 'of' in line 2 of that Clause, 3. If the Company agree to the amendment of the draft Supplementary Agreement as indicated above, namely, by insertion of the words 'the Second Schedule to' after the word 'of' in line 2 of Clause 2, and the omission of the words 'and also in Schedule 3 thereof immediately BAHREIN PETROLEUM COHPAImY, LIMITED,immediately after Article YIII' in lines 3 to 5 of Clause 3, there is no reason why the Company should not proceed forthwith to conclude the Agreement with the Sheikh, and the Resident in the Persian Gulf will 'be informed accordingly. 4. i am also to suggest that it would 'be convenient to number the two new Articles IXA and IXB. 5. As regards the mining lease, if and when the time comes to complete it, it is probable that certain modifications may he considered adYisahle, hut it is not thought that any of the alterations which His Majesty's Government would wish to see embodied in the lease will he of a character which the Company is likely to find any difficulty in accepting, and for the present it seems clearly preferable to conclude the Supplementary Agreement with regard to the prospecting licence forthwith in order that the Company's operations may proceed without undue delay. The question of the alterations which will he suggested in the mining lease will he taken up with you at an early date.. 6. On receipt of information that the modifications in the Supplementary Agreement set out ahove are acceptable to the Company, the necessary communication will he addressed to the Resident in the Persian Gulf.

This is encouraging, but it is too early to form any definite conclusion. The Baume gravity test of the Persian Oil Fields gives,! believe,about 29°,but a test taken at so early a stage does not give an average figure. 3.

In reply to your letter No:984/20 of 1351 dated January 23rd,1933. Please be advised that a very short test was made on Well No:2. It flowed 452 barrels (42 U.S gallons each) in 7 hours. The oil was 34° Baume gravity with no water and no foreign matter. There are about 7 barrels of this gravity oil to the ton,so the well made about 64:-i tons in 7 hours,and was then shut in and the pressure is now 440 pounds to the square inch. I would like to point out that the well had been shut in for some hours before the test was made and thus might have built up an abnormal pressure which would make a short flowing test very inaccurate and possibly misleading. Although Well No:2 appears from this test to be better than No:1,this can only be determined definitely by a test over a longer period of time.
