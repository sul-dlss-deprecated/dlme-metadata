Prom Cox, Basra, To P.A. Muscat, No 3035. Dated 24/6/16 received 25/6/16. Authentic news has been received that H.H. the Grand Sharif of Meccasupported by all the Arab tribes of West &amp; Central Arabia has proclaimed Arab independence of Turkish &amp; Ottoman rule, under whose maladministration &amp; (?) judication country has so long suffered. Operations commenced about 9th June &amp; have resulted in signal success of Sharif^ forces. Mecca, Jedda &amp; Taif have been captured &amp; garrisons have surrendered with exception of two small forts at Taif which are said to be still holding out. Numbers of troops sur rendered at Meaca &amp; Taif not yet known, but at Jedda 45 Officers, 1400 soldiers, &amp; 16 guns were captured. Medina according to latest news is closely besieged &amp; all communications Hejas are in the hands of ShariC. Jedda being in secure possession of Sharif now makes it possible to reopen communication by sea, &amp; trade to the Hejaz ports can now be resumed. It is hoped therefore that many of the difficul ties which have attended annual pilgrimage to holy places during the past two years may now be removed. At the same time it must be remem bered that shortage of shipping apart from the question of supplies &amp; the necessarily unsettled conditions make it undesirable that for ,, o the present large numbers of persons should attempt to prceed on the pilgrimage. Cox Note. This message was received on the 25th, a Sunday, &amp; the Dragoman was awaay at his home at Matra. As P.A. was going to pay his first official visit to H.H. on the 26th, the communication (but without reference to the reopening of the pilgrimage) was made by P.A. verbally. Before the Dragoman had completed the translation, the portion of the announcement which P.A. had communicated to H.H. had appeared in Reuters. No further action was therefore taken.Telegram P.

Dated Your No 35C7 • So little interest is taken here in the duin^ of the Grand Sharif of Mecca, that, as the mail is zoinz to-morrow, it does not seem worth while sending a telegraphic report. H.H. when he first he..rd of the Arab revolt remarked to me casually in conversation that he had long been an advocate of the course now adopted, L did not understand why it had hung fire so long. H.H. has sincv. expressed satisfaction at the reports of the successes obtained by the Sharif. A large element among the Musulman British subjects in Maskat consists of Khojas. They either disbelieve the stories about the Sharif or are indifferent to them. The same may be said of the Ibadhis, the preponderant local sect. At least so I am informed, but my informant was not himself an Ibadhi, L I do not think that he knew very much about any peculiar views that they may have. In Sunni circles, the majority of those who believe the reports see in them cause for satisfaction, but there ^re still many who do not believe them, &amp; there is a smaller number, who apparently influenced by expressions of opinion from Western India, c , are inclined to resent recent developments as an extension in the world of Islam of a disastrous quar el of infidel origin,, of which the issue is more likely tc be bad than seed. /few.- &lt; CsZU Political Agent, Masqat.revolt remarked that he h-.id long beeii in favour of the '^our^e adopted &amp; did not understand *hy soniethinj; of the sort had not hu^- of the Shafif’s suecesses. o).

Secret, NOTES BEGABDING POLICT TO BE ADOPTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE REVOLT OF THE SHEHIF OF MECCA^. For various reasons the Government of India have refrained from issuing any general communique as yet as regards the revolt of the Grand Sherif which commenced at Jedda, Mecca and elsewhere on 9th June. Certain Muslim socities in India have however adopted a most uncompromising attitude towards the Sharif’s action, and the Government of India, realising that this attitude is likely to prove infectious unless early steps are taken to influence the best Muslim opinion in the right direction, have instructed Local Governments to depute certain Civil Officers to hold informal conversations with such Muhammadan individuals and Organisations as may appear most suitable for that purpose. The line to be adopted is as follows:- (a) The existing hostilities between Great Britain and Turkey are the work of Turkey’s present rulers at the instigation of Germany; they are not the work of Great Britain. (b) Indian Muslims should recognise that to be pro-Turk is to be anti—British, since the allies of our enemies must be our enemies, and the enemies of our enemies must be our friends. The Turks, by the misguided action of their present rulers, have brought themselves into the former category and we can not in any way distinguish between them and the Germans. (c) The Arabs on the other hand, have long been attempt ing to throw off the oppressive Turkish yoke which the Indian pilgrims have themselves experienced. The Arab movement is no - new thing. By opening hostilities now, the Arabs have ipso facto become enemies of our enemies, and His Majesty’s GovernmentGovernnent are pursuing the only possible course by sympathising with the movement. (d) His Majesty’s Government will however adhere above all things to their pledge,and the Holy Places will be more than ever immune from molestation by Christian Naval or Military forces when the removal of Turkish authority by the action of the Sheriff has made interference with the pilgri mage no longer likely. Indeed,special arrangements for this year’s Hajj are already in train and shipping difficulties alone restrict the numbers who can go. (e) In any terms of peace His Majesty’s Government will make it an essential condition that the Hedjaz shall remain under independent Muslim rule. From the first His Majesty's Government have stated that the Khalifate is a question which must bo decided by Muslims in India and elsewhere without the influence of non-Muslim Powers. 6« Any information that may come to light of the views and general attitude in connection with this matter of Shaikhs and communities with whom you are in touch should be reported without delay*r A ^ ; Telegram P Prom P.A., Maskat.

Ho. 38384/1925. I am directed by Itfr. Secretary Amery to acknow- -ledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th of August notifying your acceptance of the appointment of British Pepresentative for the purpose of negotiating with the Sultan of Nejd a settlement of outstanding frontier and other questions, and to communicate to you for your guidance the following information regarding the policy of His Majesty's Government in the matters which are likely to be raised in the course of yhur conversations with Ibn Saud. 2. As you are aware, an alhefiip't'made at the end of 1923 to settle^ by agreement the various matters in dispute between Ibn Saud and the rulers of the neighbouring Arab states, and for this purpose a Conference of represent- -atives of the States concerned assembled at Kuwait in December of that year under the Presidency of Lieutenant Colonel S. G. Knox, C.S.I., C.I.E.. Copies of the records of the proceedings of that Conference are enclosed herewith for your information together with a file contain- -ing copies of relevant correspondence with Lieutenant Colonel Knox. A certain measure of progress towards agreement was then made, but for various reasons which are apparent from the records, the Conference closed without achieving any definite result. Ihe main objects for which the Kuwait Conference was called were (1) The delimitation of the frontier between Nejd and Trans-Jordan: (2) The prevention of trans-frontier raiding between the tribes of Iraq and Hejd and the settlement of claims arising from past raids;(3) The settlement of frontier and other disputes between Nejd and the Hejaz. Since that Conference terminated many events have occurred which have considerably modified the situation in Arabia. A briedT record of xta these events will be found in the Appendix to the report of the Committee of Imperial Defence, of which a copy is enclosed herewith. Chief 'among these events was the outbreak of hostilities between the Sultan of Nejd and the King of the Hejaz. Hostilities are still proceeding, and although the final issue cannot be foreseen the present position is that the forces of Ibn Saud are in effective occupation of the greater part of the Hejaz, including the Holy City of Mecca, and are investing the town of Jeddah, upon which and the immediately surrounding country King Ali maintains a precarious hold. The lioithern districts of the Hejaz, bordering upon Trans-Jordan, are not at present in the effective occupation of either of the combatants. As you are aware, Kis Majesty’s Government have publicly announced their strict neutrality in this conflict. 3. Although the situation in Arabia has been very considerably modified during the last two years, the three principal questions with which the Kuwait Conference was concerned remains^ unsettled today, and it is with the primary object of disposing of the first two of these questions that the negotiations, in which you are to xj® represent His Majesty’s Government, have been initiated. As regards the first question, that of the delimitation of the frontier between Trans-Jordan and Hejd, I am to enclose, for your information, a copy of the instructions communicatee to Lieutenant Colonel Khox prior to the assembly of the Kuwait Conference. You will see that at that time His Majesty’s Government were prepared to accept as a minimum an eastern frontier which would roughly follow a line drawn frou the intersection of meridian 39° with parallel 32° to the intersection3 XOb) 5. internection of ineridian 37° with parallel 31 30 f . irom this point the line follows meridian 37° to parallel 31°, thence to the intersection of ne/ridian 38° with parallel 30°, and thence along ineridian 38° to parallel 29^ 35*, or a point due west of the Wefud salient. The frontier is indicated by a red line on the attached map. £ince this frontier was decided upon the military advisers of His Majesty's Government have represented the importance , for ajtJcxjRjosxx^ strategical reason of including in Trans Jordan the village of Kaf. His Majesty's Government are now satisfied of the desirability of this and you should use your utmost endeavours to secure the acceptance by Ibn Saud of a frontier substantially identical with that indicated abekve, but including haf within Trans-Jordan territory. 4. From the telegram from Lieutenant Colonel Knox, a copy of which is appended, it appears likely that Ibn Saud will advance a claim to a frontier considerably to the west of the above line and extending to the north of the Jebel Anaizeh. This frontier claim is indicated by a green line on the attached map. 3uch a frontier would involve the inter-position of Nejd territory between Iraq and Trans—Jordan and v/ould place Ibn 8aud astride the Imperial Air ftoute to the Fast. This cennot be permitted and in no circumstances should you assent to any extension of Nejd territory to the north which would have the effect of separating Iraq from Trans-Jordan. You will observe from the enclosed copy of the Iraq—Nejd frontier agreement, with attached map, that the western extremity of this fronti -er is the intersection of meridian 39°N with parallel 32°B. The Eastern frontier of Trans-Jordan should in the Opinion of His Majesty’s Government start from this point and be draw rather in a westerly or southerly direction than in a northerly.4 b. In the southern sector of the eastern frontier of Trans Jordan Ibn Baud’s claim appears equally objectionable since, in His Majesty’s Government’s opinion, any more westerly trace / than that proposed could not be adopted with- -out endangering the safety of the Trans-Jordan section of the Hejaz Railway. You should, therefore, regard the northern and southern extremities of the frontier line originally proposed by His Majesty’s Government as fixed, and it would be advisable to make this clear to Ibn Baud at the outset of your discussions. If however you are unab -le to induce Ibn baud to agree to the inclusion of haf with -in Trans-Jordan and if, in your opinion, further insistence on this point would be useless, you may in the last resort concede that village to hejd, in which case the frontier should approximately follow trie line indicated in red on the attached map. You will observe that Ibn Baud desires the inclusion in Nejd of a tract of territory to the South of Kaf comprising the four streams running eastward into the Wadi Sirhan, viz. the Wahls Bayet, Gharra, Hasa and Bedrid. His Majesty’s Government are not aware to what extent this area is essential as a grazing ground to the tribes depend- -ing on Trans-Jordan and Syria, or whether it contains a settled population. Enquiries are being made of the High Commissioner for Palestine and steps will be taken to fur- -nish you with precise information on these points. From the telegram from Bir P. Cox dated the 6th of December 1922, of which a copy is enclosed, it will be seen at that time Ibn Baud would have accepted a frontier roughly following the western edge of the Wadi Sirhan and leaving the greater part of this area within Trans-Jordan. You should point this out to Ibn Baud if he ad- -vances a claim to any territory in this region additional to that claimed in 1922 and should endeavour to resist such a claim on the ground that this territory was clearly not regardedregarded as essential to Kejd :Ln 1922 and Ills Majesty’s Government are aware of no valid reason why it should be so regarded now. If however Ibn Baud presses his claim to this tract of territory very strongly and it appears that unless he receives some measure of satisfaction the negotiations will break down. His majesty’s Government would, as at presenw advised, be prepared to agree to some arrangement whereby this territory wou-d be constituted a neutral enclave ( on the analogy of the section of neutral territory on the southern frontier between Nejd and Iraq ;, which the tribes of both parLies would be free to enter &amp;or grazing purposes. Kis Majesty’s Government are content to leave it to your discretion, in the light of the inform- -ation which you will receive from the high Commissioner for Palestine, to decide whether ouch an arrangement would be feasible and, if so, to work out details in agreement with Ibn Saud. 6. The question of the southern frontier of Trans- -Jordan is one of some delicacy owing to the unstable con- -Aitions obtaining in the Northern districts of the Hejaz, x! which, as pointed out above, do not at present appear to be within the effective occupation or control of either Ibn Baud or King Ali. Consequently, any attempt to negotiate a frontier with one party would be liable to give offence to the other. In all the circumstances, and in view of the fact that Ibn Saud has already been informed of the Southern limits of Trans-Jordan territory. His Majesty’s Government consider that it would be advisable in your conversations with him to treat this matter as a chose, jugee , merely informing him, if he should raise the point, that the southern frontier of Trans-Jordan starts from the inter- -section of meridian 36° and parallel 29° 35'. crosses the ^ejaz Railway south of Mudawwara and joins the Gulf of Akaba at a point south of that town.7. With regard to the second main question with which you will he concerned, that of the prevention of trans-frontier raiding betv/een Iraq an»!Tejd tribes, I am to invite your attention to the records of the later meetings of the Kuwait Conference, and to the accompanying copy of a Confidential despatch dated the 113th of harch 1920 from the High Commissioner for Iraq. From these you will observe that a substantial measure of agreement was reached at Kuwait as to the steps necessary to check such raiding, but that the Conference failed to reach agreement on the important question of the mutual restoration of loot and the payment of compensation in respect of damages arising out of past raids. As regards the arrangements necessary to prevent future raids, the position has been very comfortably easoo by the action of the Iraq Government in moving the principal offenders - the refugee Shammar - to districts remote from the Iraq-Hejd frontier, where they will not be subject to the same ter^ptation to raid across the border, and where their activities can be more easily and effectively oontroiled. Consequently, there appear to be good grounds for hoping that on this question it will be found possible to reach an agreement with Ibn Saud. Such agreement should, in His Majesty*a Government’s opin- -ion, xstspzx in general follow 'c.hc lines of the scheme under consideration by the Kuwait Conference, unless, of course, some alternative and more satisfactory method suggests it- -self in the course of your discussions. Any agreement that may be reached on this point might with advantage be extended mutatis mutandis to apply to Grans-Jordan. His Maj esty’s Government anticipate tliat ohe settlement of outstanding claims for compensation and the restoration of loot will present greater difficulties, but you should use your best endeavours to obtain a settlement substantially in accord with the suggestions advanced in fir H. Dobbs’ despatch7 Zfo despatch of the 30th of June, of which a copy is appended to this letter. To assist you in this part of your negotiat- -ions, the Iraq Government have decided to place at your disposal the services of Tawfiq Beg al Suwaidi, Assistant Government Counsellor in the 2£inistry of Justice. He will he in a position to furnish you with full details regarding claims and counter-claims advanced in respect of past raids, as also with the views of the Iraq Government regarding a final settlement of such claims. If you are successful in reaching agreement with Ihn Baud with regard to trans- -frontier raiding across the Trans-Jordan or Iraq frontier respectively or the question of the determination of a Trans-Jordan—Hejd frontier, the decisions reached should he embodied in separate formal agreements signed hy you and Ihn Baud. Any such agreements, in so far as they concern Iraq, will require to he approved by the Iraq Parliament and ratified hy King Feisal before they become operative. In so far as they concern Trans-Jordan they will enter into force as from the date of signature and will n&lt;fct require ratification. 8. Apart fror these major questions, there are two other matters which might with advantage be discussed with Ibn Baud, when a favourable opportunity offers, viz. the protection of Hejdi interests in Syria and the question of British representation in Fejd. As regards the former question I have to explain that in September 1922, Ibn Baud requested His Majesty’s Government to undertake temporarily the protection of Nejdi interests in Syria. His Majesty’s Government agreed to accept this charge and the French auGfckxndfci authorities, who were informed of Ibn Baud’s reques acquiesced in the arrangement. Shortly afterwards, how- -ever, Ibn Baud appointed a representative in Damascus, but when notifying His Majesty’s Consul at Damascus of this appointment, asked him to supervise the work of the Hejdi representative8 0 representative, and to give him all advice and assistance of which he might stand in need. Copies of It&gt;n Baud’s letters are enclosed herewith for yourinformation. The present Nejdi representative at jf^araascus, Suleyman Ibn Musheiqih, unlike his predecessors and possibly with the object of enhancing his own importance locally, has shown himself on more than one occasion impatient of the control of the British Consul, and the French authorities have similarly evinced an increasing reluctance to accept the intervention of the British Consul at Damascus in questions affecting Kejdi interests. Matters recently came to a head when, in April of Hi is year, the British Consul inter- -vened with the French authorities on behalf of Hejd and was informed that, as Ibn Baud was already officially represented in Syria the French authorities were uhable to recognise any right on the part of His Majesty’s Consular Officers to assume the i)rotection of Mejdi interests in that country. In order that His Majesty’s Government may have the necessary information to enable them to decide what attitude to adopt towards this action on the part of the French authorities, you should seek a suitable occasion to ascertain and report to His Majesty’s Government what is the precise function of the Hejdi representative at Damascue and what are Ibn Baud’s real wishes regarding the protection of his interests in Syria. 9. The second question - that of permanent or XKXmn semi-permanent British representation in Nejd - is one which has been engaging the attention of His Majesty’s Government for some time. r Tie present arrangement has not proved altogether satisfactory. Written communications between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Baud pass through the inter -mediary of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.xnot but there is at present no representative of His Majesty’s Government9 VV Government in peraonal touch with ibn Saud, and the absence of such a representative has given rise, in the past, to various misunderstandings anu disputes, very largely attri- -butakle to the fact that His Majesty's Government are frequently unaware of Ibn Baud’s real wished or intentions g- since he is notably averse from committing himself in writing h His Majesty’s Government feel that many of the disputes whid have arisen in the past might have been avoided by h prompt and frank discussion of the questions at issue had this been possible. Various solutions of the difficulty have been considered. It has been suggested that the tire has now come to station a permanent representative at Ibn Baud’s capital- This suggestion is open to objection on the grounds of the extreme discomfort inseparable from prolonged y residence at Riyadh and the dangerously isolated position which such an Officer would occupy. Again it has been suggested that a representative of Ibn Saud should be accepted in London or accredited to King laisal or the British High Commissioner at Baghdad; but as Ibn Saud is known to be unwilling to place reliance upon the judg- -ment or discretion of his subordinates-, such an arrangement would be unlikely to achieve the desired result. Another suggestion which has been advanced is that arrangements should be made for periodical visits to be paid by a British Officer to Ibn Baud. In the existing circumstances, this last suggestion appears tne most likely to commend itself to Kis -^jesty’s Government, but as circumstances may alter in the near future (c.g. Ibn Baud may, as a result of his conquests in the Hejaz move hie capital to some more readily accessible spot) His Majesty’s Government would prefer to reserve their decision until conditions in Arabia become more stable. You should, however, encourage Ibn Baud to discuss this question frankly with you, and, without definitely10 definitely committing His Majesty’s Government to any of the above alternatives, you should endeavour to ascertain his wishes in the matter. •ou should point out to Ibn f&gt;aud that his Hajosty’s Government are dfjsirous of making arrangements which would enable thorn to be Kept pArraarently in touch with him, if circumstances render such a course practicable, and both in discussing this matter with Ibn Saud and throughout your discussions with him you should make it clear that His ^ajesty’s Government are anxious to be on cordial terms with His Highness and to co-operate wh with hin wherever possible. 10 . It is not improbable that during your xhsxsmKK conversations Ibn Gaud will raise the Question of his position in the Hejaz and will enaeavour to obtain from you a staternent of Iiie I a i esty ’ s Government ! b pci icy and .in particular to learn what view His iajes zy 1 s Government take of the recent exp^aision of his territories and what are their wishes with regard to the future administration of the Hejaz. If Ibn Saud questions you on these ix&gt;ints you should confine your reply to a statement that His Majesty’s Government’s only desire is for the speedy temm- -in&amp;tion of t}ie present hostilities and the re-establishment of peaceful conditions in the Hejaz; their recent offer of mediation was made with this sol# object in view and they have learned with regret that Ibn Saud is at present un- -wiiling to accept it. ''heir offer has, nowever, not been withdrawn, and it is still open to Ibn Baud, should he so desire, to avail himself of their good offices. But while hostilities continue His Majesty’s Government have no alternative but to maintain an attitude of strict neutrality. fith regard to the ultimate regime to be set up in the Holy Cities and in Hejaz generally, you should point out that, beyond doing everything in their power to ensure that their Moslem subjects have free and safe access to11 to the holy places, His Majesty’s Government feel that they cannot properly intervene in a matter which so closely concerns Moslem opinion as a whole. iVhile confining yourself to a statement on the above lines you should in no way discourage Ibn Saud from discussing the matter freely with you. 11 . Ibn Saud may also represent that the terms of the Treaty concluded with him in 1916, a cox^y of which is enclos -ed, are no longer apx&gt;ropriate, in view of the recent ex- -tension of his territories, and may suggest that the Treaty should be replaced by one more in accordance with his in- -creased influence and importance. In this event you should ■gi-wwwyg inform him that, while hostilities are * actually in progress, His Majesty’s Government clearly cannot enter into negotiations for a new treaty, and that until peace is restored and stable conditions are establish© -ed His Majesty’s Government would prefer to leave matters as they are. 12. Should Ibn Saud raise other questions which are not covered by these instructions you should take note of what he has to say and report to His Majestyjjs Government; at the same time informing him that you are without instruct -ions on these points, but that you will communicate his views to His Majesty’s Government by whom they will be given every consideration. 13. I am to inform you that, in accordance with your suggestion, the Palestine Government have agreed to place at your disposal the services of Mr. G. Antonious, to act as your Secretary and have also agreed to attach a British Stenographer to your Mission. A further communication will be addressed to you with regard to the date of your departure, and the venue of the meeting. In the meantime, in I am to request that you will hold yourself in readiness to proceed to Jeddah at short notice. I am, etc. ga/. r.v.VERHBH. V KCOPY. Telegram H. From Acting British Consul, Jeddah.

I have also obtained Bin Baud * s assent to a clause whereby tribes called up for military service must take their families and flocks with them. With regard to extradition I resisted Bin Baud’s insistent demand and arranged that question of extradition of non-political offenders should form subject of friendly negotiations between Iraq and Nejd with a view to discussing an extradition treaty on lines usually adopted between neighbouring States. With regarding to restitution ofX loot I was pre- -eluded from arriving at an actual liquidation chiefly owing to fact that the Iraq delegate was not in possession of the necessary details.

In continuation of my telegram Ho. 639, dated the 4th of December 1925, I have the honour to report that Sir Gilbert Clayton arrived in Baghdad on the morning of jtiug November the 30th and handed me a copy of his complete report of the Bahra negotiations, together with a signed copy of the Bahra Agreement. I forwarded the latter to the Prime Minister with the request that steps may be taken to secure its ratification at an early date. I also forwarded to him copies of the papers numbered 2, 3 and 4 in Annexure 14 to Sir Gilbert Clayton’s Deport, namely Taufiq Beg Suwaidi’s report regarding the conversation between himself and the Najd delegate in connection with the liquidation of past raids, Sir Gilbert Clayton’s letter to Ibn Saud on the same subject, and Ibn Saud’s reply.Xfcjnrxx jtar The only .Arabic copies of these documents having been forwarded by Sir Gilbert Clayton to the Colonial Office I did not consider it advisable to have them re-translated into Arabic, but forwarded them in English. I should be grateful if I could be favoured, as early as possible, with copies of the Arabic versions that are in your possession. 2. Sir Gilbert Clayton had interviews with His Majesty King Faisal and with the Council of Ministers. Both His Majesty and the Cabinet expressed themselves as thoroughly satisfied with the terms of the Bahra Agreement, and exceedingly grateful for the able manner in which Sir Gilbert Clayton conducted the negotiations on their behalf. Parliament is due to reassemble on December the 20th, and no difficulty is anticipated in securing its approval to the ratification of the agreement by His Majesty.2 py 3. The Agreement is, from the ’Iraq point of view, thoroughly satisfactory, and the ’Iraq Government have every reason to he grateful to Sir Gilbert Clayton lor the skilful diplomacy which enabled him to secure a favourable settlement of all the important points which the Kuwait Conference failed to decide. It now depends upon the ’Iraq Government more, I think, than upon Ib/tn Saud, to see that the terms of the agreement are lyyally KaxxiBBbcMct observed. The establishment of cordial relations between the ruler of Najd and any son of the ex^King of the Hijaz can scarcely be looked for in the immediate future, but I see no reason to suppose that His Majesty King Faisal will not subordinate his natural feelings of filial resentment to the tfcue interests of the country over which he rules. The co-operation of the present Cabinet may be safely counted upon. 3. The first necessity for the implementing of the Bahra Agreement is the establishment of more expeditious means of communication with Ibn Baud than those that now exist. I have carefully examined the correspondence ending with the Duke of Devonshire’s telegram Ho. 210, dated the 30th of April 1923, on the subject of the substitution of the Honourable the Resident in the Persian Gulf for the High Commissioner in Baghdad as the medium of communication between His Majesty's Government and Ibn Saud, and I can find nothing therein to suggest that it was the intention of His Majesty’s Government that direct correspondence between the High Commissioner and Ibn Baud on purely ’Iraq affairs should cease. Whatever the intention of His Majesty’s Government may have been, the fact remains that, since the departure of Sir Percy Cox on leave in the Spring of 1923 direct correspondence between the High Commissioner in Baghdad and Ibn Baud has ceased. Ho good purpose appears to have served in the past by this discontinuance oj direct3 direct relations between ’Iraq and Najd, and in at least one instance, namely that of the camels looted from the Phafir in June last, which it now appears that Ibn Baud has been for some months ready and anxious to return, consider- -able delay and confusion has resulted. It is essentioj that direct relations should now be re-established, and I hox^e that I may receive your telegraphic authority to communicate to Ibn Baud through His Britannic Majesty’s representative at Jiddah the ratification of the Bahra Agreement, as soon as it has been effected, and in future to correspond direct with Ibn Baud, by the most expeditious means at my disposal, in all matters of detail affecting his relations with the ’Iraq Government and the steps to be taken to implement the agreements in force between the Governments of $ajd and Iraq. The correspondence will usually pass through His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Jiddah or the Political Agent at Bahrain or Kuwait, accord- -ing to the whereabouts of Ibn Baud, and copies of corres- -pondence will be sent to the Resident at Bushire and to the Colonial Office for information. As I have stated above, I cannot discover that it was e'ver the intention of His Majesty’s Government that direct correspondence bwtween ’Iraq and Rajd should cease, but it has ceased for so long that it appears necessary that Ibn Baud should be informed of your approval to its resumption. I request therefore that, should ycu approve my proposal, you will be good enough to intimate your approval to Ibn Baud as well as to myself as early as possible. 5. This step will not, however, in my opinion, be enough to secure a satisfactory solution of frontier tribal difficulties. In the case of both Persia and Syria it was found that, when dealing with minor frontier troubles, correspondence between the central Governments was too dilatory a method to secure satisfactory results, and a systemsystem of dieect correax^ondence between the frontier officials of 1 Iraq and those of Persia and Syria respect -ively has been introduced with very satisfactory results. Similar correspondence has ev^i, in very minor cases, proved effective in settling incidents on the Turkish frontier. I hope that it may eventually be possible to induce Ibn Saud to agree to the introduction of a similar system as between ’Iraq and Najd. Such a system would not be in conflict with Article 5 of the Bahra Agreement which refers not to correspondence between subordinate officials of the two Governments but to correspondence between the central Government on one side and subordinate officials oit chiefs on the other. Ibn Saud is esceedingly chary of deputing any powers to his subordinate commanders, and the question will have to be tackled with care, but Sir Gilbert Clayton, with whom I have had the advantage of discussing it, and who expressed his complete agreement with my views, cons id- -ers that there should be no great difficulty in eventually securing Ibn Saud’s agreement to an informal agreement of this nature. 5.

Secretary Amery to refer to your letter No. E.1513/180/21 of the 9th of March and to transmit to you, to be laid before Secretary Sir Austem Chamberlain, a copy of the record of the interrdepartmental conference held at this Office on the 12th of March to discuss matters arising out of Sir Gilbert Clayton’s report on his mission to the Sultan of Nejd.

I am also to suggest that, provided that Sir Austen Chamberlain sees no objection a message should now be sent to Ibn Sa’ud in the terms agreed upon by the conference on the subject (l) of the revision of the existing treaty (2) of direct correspondence between Ibn Sa’ud and the French authorities in Syria and (3) of the despatch of a Nejd delegation to India. 4.

E. Shuckburgh. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.Minutes of a Conference held at the Colonial Office on the 12th of March, 1926, to discuss matters arising out of Sir Gilherl Clayton’s report on his Mission to Ihn Saud.

T ) Foreign Office. ) India Office. i Uir ) Ministry. ) The following points were discussed :- 1• The control of futu r e re^ j Ations with Ibn Saud and Channel of Communication. Sir Shuckburgh po in ted out that hitherto the Foreign Office had dealt with the Hejaz and the Colonial Office with Nejd. He drew attention to the recommendation made by the Masterton-Smith Committee that the chahnel of communication between His Majesty’s Government and the Kejaz Government should be the Foreign Office but that, in all questions affecting purely Arab politics, the Colonial Office should be regarded as the responsible British authority. He said that he had referred the question of the control of future ygrar* relations with Ibn Saud to the Secretary of State and that Mr. Amery’s views were as follows — (a) Apart from questions ofl detail arising out of the Bahra Agreement with regard to which the High Commissioner for Iraq had already been authorised to deal direct with Ibn Saud through the British Agent atpeddah, all communications with Ibn Saud should pass through the Foreign Office and H.M. Consul at Jeddah. (b) the final responsibility for all questions affecting Arabian politics whether relating to the Hejaz of Nejd should rest with^the Colonial Office. (c) the responsibility for 3dt±x3piBSJfci»HS local and consular questions concerning the Hejaz, including the pilgrimage should rest with^the Foreign Office. Sir J. Shuckburgh addedthat, in his opinion, the Foreign Office should also be primarily responsible in all matters concerning Ibn Saud’s relations with Foreign Powers. He explained that these proposals would, in practice, very largely mean the continuance of the present arrangements, except that the channel of communication via Bushire would be eliminated; although this channel could always be revived, either in addition to or instead of the Jeddah channel, in the case of necessity. Mr. Spring Rice said that he agreed generally with the proposals but would have to fefer them to higher authority. Questions of Arabian policy would as hitherto be dealt^ with by consultation between the foreign Office and the Colonial Office, but the Foreign Office would | 2 Xe£r prefer not to lay down anything definite until the future relationsrelations with Ibn Saud had been defined by the conclusion of a revised treaty. Sir J. Sh uckburfch said that he was sure that there was no intention of altering the present arrangements under which action in|regard to Hajd or Hejaz affairs was concerted between the Foreign Office andjthe Colonial Office, but that the view of the Secretary of State for the Colonies was that the Colonial Office should in principle be regarded as the Department primarily responsible for dealing with questions of policy in Arabia and therefore the Department whose view should normally prevail As regards the question who would deal with Parliamentary Questions relating to Ibn Saud, the general view of the Conference was that, in deference to Ibn Baud's expressed wish that his relations^should be with the Foreign Office, such questions^hould normally be answered by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, but that the Colonial Office should furnish the material for the replies. (2) Revision of the 1 916 Treaty with Ibn S aud . Sir J. Shuckburgh said that it was clear that the existing Treaty between His Majesty's Government and Ibn Saud was no longer appropriate and would have to be xeyxi revised. It was agreed that a polite message should be xxj sent to Ibn Saud informing him that Sir G. Clayton had reported his desire for a revision of the Treaty: that His Majesty's Government realised that the circumstances had changed and that it was desirable to revise the treaty; and that a communication on the subject would be addressed to him very shortly. Mr Spring Rice suggested that the/ new treaty whould contain as little detail as possible, and urged that as the whole negotiation of the treaty must be largely a matter of tactics, it would be desirable before making any definite proposals' to have the views of Sir G. Clayton who was already on the way back to England from Aden. Subject to this reservation, he proposed the undermentioned subjects as suitable for inclusion in the Treaty, and these were agreed to provisionally and subject to certain reser vations shown in the notes. (a) declaration of perpetual peace and friendship (b) recognition by Ibn Saud of His Majesty&amp;s Government's special position in the neighbouring Mandated Territories. (c) agreement by Ibn Saud not to interfere with Arab rulers with whom H.M.G. were in treaty relations, e.g. Kuwait, Bahrain. ( Note . It was agreed that the actual ritx rulers to whom this should apply would have to be carefully considered.) (d) Settlement of the Trans-Jordan-Hejaz frontier. (e) Something on the lines of Article 5 of the 1916 Treaty providing for the protection, etc., of pilgrims. (Note . It was agreed that it would be necessary to consult the Government of India before any forms of words could be put to Ibn Saud.) (f) promise by Ibn Saud to co-operate in the sup pression of the Slave Trade and to recognise the practice of consular manumission at Jeddah. It was agreed that the question of retaining the substance of Article 2 of the present treaty (viz. pro tection against foreign agression) should be discussed withwith Sir G. Clayton on his arrival. Group Captain Burnett explained that the Air Ministry were definitely opposed to entering into any commitment to protect Ibn Saud. Mr. Wakely suggested that the treaty should be made with Ibn Saud personally and should not apply to his dynasty, and it was agreed that the question of making the treaty personal to Ibn Saud or for a limited number of years fa or for the duration of His Majesty’s Government’s mandatory responsibility in the Middle East would require further consideration. (3) Grant of a Subsidy . Mrx It was agreed that the payment of a subsidy to Ibn Saud was out of the question, and that this question should not be mentioned in any communication addressed to Ibn Saud. ( 4 ) Supply of Arms . Mr. Mallet pointed out that Ibn Saud’s request to Sir G. Clayton for arms was made before he had captured Medina and Jeddah, as a result of which considerable stores of arms and ammunition passed into his possession. It was agreed that, although it might be advisable in the future to allow him to purchase in Great Britain arms for Governmental purposes, it would be undesirable to volunteer to do atx do at present. It was accordingly agreed that his request under this head should be ignored. (5) Representation in Damascus . Mr. Spring Rice said the Foreign Office proposed that British control over the He jdi representative in Damascus should be allowed to go, by degrees, but that at the same time, the Consul should keep in personal touch with him. It was agreed that Ibn Saud should be informed that the attention of His Majesty’s Government had been called to the question &amp;nd that they had taken his correspondence with ESbc Sir G. Clayton into consideration and have no objection to his entering into direct correspondence with the French authorities in Syria through his representative at Damascus. 6. Arrangements for Pilgrimage . It was agreed that the Foreign Office should telegraph to the British Consul at Jeddah asking him how far he was in a position to meet Ibn Saud’s request for an early estimate of the total number of pilgrims likely to perform the pilgrimage this year and whether he wished H.M.G. to take steps to obtain further information to supplement that already in his possession. 7. He.jdi delegationfco India. It was decided that in writing to Ibn Saud it should be pointed out that this matter had now been satisfactorily disposed of in accordance with his wishes. 8* Senussi . It was agreed that no action should be taken on antno communication made to Ibn Saud with Reference to his intercession on behalf of the Senussi, pending the xXx return of Sir G. Clayton who had promised to make enquiries in Cairo. 9. Harbour at Ras Tannura . As Sir G. Clayton had proposed to take up the matter with the authorities in Bombay, it was agreed to await his return before considering what action was possible on this, and that in the meantime no communication on the subject should be made to Ibn Saud. 10. Belimitation of Trans-Jordan Frontier . It was agreed that the delimitation on the spot of the frontTer laiddown in the Hadda Agreement should be deferred until the new treaty with Ibn Saud had been concluded, when it aould be possible to arrange for the delimitation of the whole of the T'ywmr^Y-r frontier between Ibn Saud’s territories and British Mandated territory to be carried out as one operation. Mr Spring Rice pointed out, however, that the Foreign Office were anxious to have the frontier settled as there had been complaints of frontier infringements on the part of both the French authorities in Syria and of Ibn Saud.L Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated 7th April 1926.

[E 1399/367/91] No. 1. Vice-Consul Jordan to Sir Austen Chamberlain.—{Received March 1 &gt; (No. 11. Secret.) Sir, Jeddah, February 4, 1926. I HAVE the honour to forward herewith my report on the situation in the Hejaz during the period the lst-31st January, 1926. 2. Copies of this report are being sent to Egypt, Jerusalem (2), Bagdad, Aden. Delhi and Beirut (for Damascus). 3. In view of the cessation of hostilities in the Hejaz I would respectfully suggest that the necessity of sending copies of this report to Bushire, Maskat, Khartum, Singapore, Koweit and Bahrain would appear to no longer exist, and that henceforth the practice should cease unless there be some special reasons of which I am not cognisant. 4. I shall be glad to receive instructions on this point. I have, &amp;c. S. R. JORDAN Enclosure in No. 1. Report for the Period January 1 31. 1926 (Secret.) THE military situation during the period under report has been calm, with perhaps the exception of the action of certain of Ibn Baud’s forces in the direction of Jizan and Sabia, who are rumoured to have occupied the former town, whilst the forces of one, Ali, the cousin of the Idrissi, has taken a stand against his cousin Hassan in the latter. Hassan is supposed to have invoked the assistance of Ibn Saud and the occupation of Jizan was the immediate result. 2. The King’s (Ibn Baud’s) representative and Minister for Foreign Affairs in Jeddah, a certain Abdullah Bey Damluji of Mosul origin, informed me that the situation in Asir was by no means calm, but that Ibn Saud has sufficient forces to cope with any eventuality. That the Imam Yahya knew his own strength and the strength of Ibn Saud, and consequently there would not be war between them. 3. It really appears as if the Idrissi as a force has practically ceased to exist, and his territories are being divided between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya. 4. The Emir Mohammed, Ibn Sand’s third son, who went to Medina to receive the submission of that city, arrived in Jeddah with a part of his forces on the 20th January. During his stay in Jeddah he proceeded on board H.M.S. “ Cornflower,” Red Sea sloop, and was shown over the ship. 5. The arrangements for the future military control of the Hejaz has been finally settled as follows : Ibn Saud assumes control of the whole of the military forces and assures the safety of the roads. &amp;c. For this the Hejaz people are to subscribe £140,000 per annum, and the disbursal of the money is left to Ibn Saud. Other than the above, Ibn Saud receives an annual amount of £60,000 as King of the Hejaz and Commander-in-chief of the military forces. No armed forces, except police,'are to be recruited in the Hejaz, and the forces of occupation will be Ibn Baud’s own people from Nejd. 6. Two small robberies have occurred on the Jeddah-Mecca Road, and consequently a chain of gendarme posts have been established to further guarantee the safety of travellers. Ibn Saud has also announced his intention of transferring all war materials taken in Jeddah to Taif, including aeroplanes, as the climate of Jeddah is too severe. 7. It is as yet too early to remark upon the financial situation as the many measures, economic and otherwise, are still being discussed by the so-called Hejaz Assembly in Mecca. [1228 a—3]3 Dependencies. The ceremony, which took place in Mecca, came as a surprise to many of the Hejaz people themselves, and was, according to reports, forced upon Ibn Sand, not against his will, perhaps, by the Hejaz notables, as they realised that should he hand the government of the Hejaz over to the Hejazis themselves or to some Moslem delegation or council, nothing but internecine strife and contentions would be their lot for months and even years to come, as they would be open to the intrigues of the Ashraf and many other sections of the public. Therefore, in order to guarantee the safety of the Haramain and the roads leading thereto, in order that Moslems could perform their religious duties in security, and, further, in order to secure peace and prosperity to their country, they begged Ibn Saud to accept the kingship. This Ibn Saud did but declared that the Hejaz was for the Hejazis, and that, in accordance with their wishes, he would assume the title of King and assure the safety of the Holy Places and roads, but that the affairs of Nejd and the Hejaz would be kept strictly separate. 14. On the 22nd instant, Ibn Saud, just prior to observing a self-inflicted fast, on account of not having fasted the year previous owing to the war, invited the representatives of the various Powers, the European residents and the notables of Jeddah to a banquet. After the dinner Abdullah Bey read a speech of welcome, after which the Sultan addressed the assembled company in the following sense :— “It is a great pleasure to me to have the opportunity of informing my honoured guests, and particularly the foreign representatives, of my thoughts and desires for this holy territory, and which merits our best efforts to secure its peace and prosperity. I shall devote the whole of my energies to that end. I am aw 7 are of the great achievements of the western world and I do not despise them. I feel that the western world owes much to the Arabs, who have, in recent years, lost their position in the world because they strayed from the right paths set by their ancestors, but I am going to devote my energies to bring them back to tho.se paths of righteousness and truth which alone lead to great achievements. “We have our obligations to the honourable foreign Governments, by which we will stand, and they have their obligations towards us. Moslems are brothers throughout the world, and we stand as such, and we ask the foreign Governments to facilitate the passage of pilgrims to the Holy Places. And there are obligations greater even than this, and that is, that Arabs and Moslems should be treated with consideration and their interests protected as the foreigners are treated in this Holy Land. “ I know that the heart of an Arab and Moslem is good soil, and if it is watered with kindly consideration it will produce good crops, i.e., affection. Therefore, I beg that the honourable foreign Governments will not gainsay the legitimate rights of the Moslems in their respective countries. In conclusion, I pray God our actions may be greater than our words.” 15. His Majesty has, during the course of several conversations I have had with him, raised the question of slavery, and is, in fact, manifesting a desire to find some way of abolishing this barbarous practice in the territories under his control. What the eventual results will be is not yet manifest. 16. During the period under report, orders have been secured for British firms for the supply of a condenser, two motor-cars and 5,000 tons of coal. It is hoped to secure further orders for boats, electric lighting plants, and the supply of an amount of small coinage to replace the small coins of many denominations and nationalities at present in circulation. There is also in the course of formation a Moslem company to run a service of motor-cars between Jeddah and Mecca. This company, which will be composed purely of Moslems, are desirous of having the service running before the full pilgrimage in May-June next, but, owing to the slowness of the various administra tions and the consequent delay in getting the concession, it is doubtful whether it will be possible. 17. I understand that Mr. Philby, who is still in Jeddah, is endeavouring to secure the oil concessions at Dibba, and, if so, will be returning to England to attempt to raise the necessary capital for the exploration of these fields. 18. Tw t o Indian deputations have been present in Jeddah during the period, (1) the Khilafat delegation as partisans of Ibn Saud, and (2) the Khudam-ul-[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] EASTERN (Arabia) .

I HAVE the honour to forward herewith my report on the situation in the Hejaz during the period the 1st to the 28th February, 1926. 2. Copies of this report are being sent to Egypt, Jerusalem (2), Bagdad, Aden, Delhi and Beirut (for Damascus). I have, &amp;c. S. R. JORDAN. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Re'port for the Period February 1 28, 1926. DURING the period under report many changes have taken place in the various administrations as laid down in my report for the month ended the 31st January. The most momentous of these changes is perhaps the dismissal of Dr. Hadi Bey, for a short time Director-General of the Quarantine, and the curtailment of a considerable part of the power of Dr. Abdullah Bey Damluji, one time King's representative, or self-styled Viceroy and Minister for Foreign Affairs, but who is now but a repre sentative of the Foreign Ministry at Jeddah. Mouammer Bey, lately representative of the Sultan of Nejd in Egypt, has been appointed head of the Foreign Political Intelligence Department and chief adviser to the King. 2. Several interesting personalities have arrived in Jeddah during this month, chief of whom is perhaps Major Ibrahim Depui, who now styles himself as Shereef Ibrahim, claiming in justification of this pretension illegitimate descent from his grandfather's side many years ago in the Yemen. He arrived as the representative of the High Commissioner of Syria to negotiate a commercial treaty between the Nejd and Syria. His credentials were from the High Commissioner, M. de Jouvenel, and Ibn Saud politely regretted being unable to treat with an individual, but expressed his willingness to treat with either the French or Syrian Governments. After some delay, during which no doubt Depui referred the matter to Syria, it was decided that he was negotiating on behalf of the Governments of Syria, who would soon be estab lished on a basis similar to that of the Kingdom of Irak. Owing to these delays, small progress has been made with the negotiations, as I also understand that the Sultan and his advisers are of the opinion that this move on the part of the French represents a clumsy manoeuvre to gain Hejaz recognition of the mandate in Syria, which has, I believe, been withheld to date. Should the French secure this, it will enable them to put pressure on Ibn Saud in case it can later be established that Arabs from his territories are assisting the Druse revolt. 3. Noori Pasha Shalan, a well-known Arab of the Hauran and a prominent man during the big war, arrived about the same time as Depui, but whether this is mere coincidence or otherwise I have not been able to ascertain. 4. A certain Suleiman Pasha Shafki also arrived in Jeddah during the period under report. He was one time Turkish Governor of the Asir and after Minister for War in Constantinople under the old regime. He is an anti-Kemalist and, I understand, a refugee from Turkey. 5. Other than the above a certain Mr. Ellis, an American journalist, also turned up, and after a stay of a few days in Jeddah proceeded to Bahra, accompanied by Mr. Philby as interpreter, to meet Ibn Saud. Mr. Ellis, if I am not mistaken, is well known in Constantinople for his anti-British sentiments, and they appear not to have changed since those days, as during the trip down on the steamer he lost no opportunity of criticising His Britannic Majesty’s policy in the Levant and declaring that we should clear out of Irak and leave Jerusalem and Palestine to the Americans. 6. A delegation from the Asir (Idrissi) also came to Mecca to meet Ibn Saud hnd put their claims before him. This deputation was from one of the rival factors in [1228 y—1]/ sitting at a coffee shop near the Holy Mosque when a Wahabi, dressed as all Wahabis are, came along and plucked the cigarette from his mouth and started belaying him with a stick. The Egyptian resented this treatment, and a bout of fisticuffs ensued, m which the original aggressor received a black eye and other minor injuries., it was not till the parties had been separated and quietened that it was discovered that the aggressor was the grandson of Abdul Wahab, the founder of the faith. As he is a particularly holy man, the chauffeur was taken before the Grand Cadi, who ordered him to be flogged, with the result above stated. Further, four pi gnms, Afghans, went out to the “ Jebel-el-Nur, ” where Mohammed had once hidden from his aggressors, and as they prayed they were fired upon by some Akhwan, who sligh y wounded two of them. Several further incidents of a minor nature have occurred^ and unless some action is taken by the Sultan to stop these persecutions it wi difficult for him to reconcile the above incidents with his assurances of full religious freedom and safety to pilgrims. In this respect he recently sent to this agency a telegram addressed to the authorities at Singapore, stating that he guaranteed the safety and religious freedom of all who came on the pilgrimage This action was taken on receipt of a telegram from the Nemazee shipping people, who stated that pilgrims were hanging back on account of the dangers of the pilgrimage. ° In Jeddah, also, their strictness is becoming manifest. It may not be generally known that here is the Tomb of Eve, “ the mother of the world.' The grave is some 200 yards long and some 4 yards wide and has in the middle a small mosque, '' h e ye formerly, on payment of a few piastres baKsheish, the keeper of the edifice would lift a flagstone 'from the centre of the floor to allow sceptical Christians and pious Moslems an opportunity of admiring the lady’s navel. T his tomb, until orders were issued to the contrary, used to be the favourite resort of childless wives and languishing maidens, but now has been closed under royal irade and anybody frequenting the place is punished. , i 17. Owing to the more settled conditions in the Hejaz pilgrims have already be°'an to arrive, and some 2,000 have come from India, Java and Singapore. On the arrival of the steamship ‘‘Alavi ' with 360 pilgrims on board, the local authorities, despite the fact that the ship had passed through the quarantine at Kamaran and had no illness on board, placed the ship and pilgrims m quarantine for twenty-four hours. This action on their part was quite unnecessary and represented but a show of authority. In company with the Dutch consul a protest was made against this action, but no satisfaction was obtained till I telephoned to the Sultan direct, who thereupon ordered the ship to be released and later issued instructions that no ships passing any recognised quarantine station and proceeding direct therefrom to Jeddah would undergo quarantine locally unless illness had manifested itself on board after the ship’s departure from the quarantine station. Even then if the foreign representati\e of the nationality of the ship required, the ship would be sent back to the nearest quarantine station. He also requested to become a signatory of the International Sanitary Convention, and desires to send a delegate to the conference to be held in Paris about May next. Such actions on the part of Ibn Saud show his general disposition towards better relations with foreign Powers and a desire for more modern methods in the Hejaz, and would appear to deserve seconding as far as is practicable. . 18 The condenser question has finally been settled, and the firm ot Messrs Mirrlees, Watson and Co. have agreed to have it constructed and working by the 15th May, which will go far towards securing the comfort of the pilgrims on their return from Mecca about the end of June and whilst awaiting shipment to their homejP The He - aut horities have also placed a contract with the Royal Mint for the supply of 1 million each of 1 piastre, 4 piastre and J piastre pieces of cupro nickel to replace the various small coins at present in circulation in the Hejaz. This will tend to restrict the thieving methods of local money-changers who, on account of the multiplicity of currencies employed, have no trouble whatever m confounding and robbing pilgrims who wish to change their rupees or guilders 20. During the period under report three slaves have taken refuge at this agency and been sent to the Sudan. t uv j « tt ™ 2q Enclosure No. 2 to this report is an article published in the Umm al~ Kura” under the heading of security, and details the instructions given to the sheikhs of the tribes of the Hejaz. , n „ _ , 22 Zakaria Khan, the self-styled Afghan consul, left for Bombay en route to Afghanistan a few days ago.

A DELEGATION from El Saved Hassan-el-Idrissi under the presidency of Mohammed Bin Hadi-el-Naami reached Mecca to meet His Majesty the King. The delegation were guests of fhe King It reached us that the delegation have offered obedience and submission in the name of Syed Hassan to His Ma jesty the King and that they are prepared to receive any order he gives them. His Majesty answered them in the following summary :— 'We have no ambition in your country. 1 only want to make good and set the thing right. You will realise that tbie question of your country is rather important in my eye owing to the fact that it is near to our boundaries. 1 here is nothing between Imam Yahya and us except friendship. 1 think it better that we should endeavour to make reconciliation between you and to avoid bloodshed. As to the conditions which should be between us, we will offer them to you to convey to Saved Hassan in order that agreement will be made on them. “You must know that our only objects in any one of the Arab countries are (1) to be Moslem brothers and to follow the ‘ Koran ' and the traditions of the Prophet and the course of the good ancestors and the four Imams; (2) to co-operate for obeying God and to be pious, and leave the dispute which leads us to weakness; (3) to keep to our limits, dealings and the rights of our subjects. The one who is capable of doing so deserves to keep his territory, but as regards the weak, we will discuss his matter, bring about peace and prevent dispute.’' Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Extract from the Mecca Newspaper “ Umm-al-Kura,' No. 60, dated §th Shaban, 1344 {February 19. 1926). Security in the Hejaz. HIS Majesty the King has summoned all the chiefs of the Hejaz tribes (HarK Juheina, Billi and others). They all came at the end of the month of Rajab. His Majesty the King saw them in his house and advised them. He then divided the roads in the Hejaz to different parts, making limits for each part, and caused each one of the sheikhs to guarantee the security within his region and will be held responsible for his tribe, and will have to answer for any offence or contradictory action made by him or by one of his men. His Majesty the King gave them the following instructions 1. To follow and keep to the Islamic Shara'a law. 2. To pay the alms in time to the representative of His Majesty for everything for which alms are due, like camels, sheep, corn, palm-trees, &amp;c. 3. To make the “ Jihad ” (holy war for the sake of God) and to hasten to join other Moslems for same as soon as they receive the order from His Majesty the King. 4. To protect 'the travellers, whether they are pilgrims, camelmen or passers-by, &amp;c., and not to cause any travellers, pilgrims or others to pay them anything, other former rights being cancelled, and that they are to take only what His Majesty the King graciously gives them from “ Beit-al- Mal ” (treasury) of the Moslems as he gives others of his subjects, and that the enemy of the Moslems is their enemy and the friend of the Moslems their friend. They'swore by God to do accordingly.Ho.Z**-S # of 1926 COiiHi; /Y1AX*. 2.4^ British Residency and Consulate-General, Bus lit re, 17th June 1926.
