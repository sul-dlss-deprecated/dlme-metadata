My dear Loch, I hear up here that there has heen a fairly serious scrap tetvieen the Iraq Police and smugglers taking stuff m from Kuwait. If His Majesty's Government or the Bmbassy raise the question the line to take is as follovis: 3 M (a) That though a certain ar-iount of smuggling takes place across the Kuwait-Iraq herder (as it does across all frontiers) there is no douht that it has decreased greatly during the last year. That the smugglers having done nothing for some months have a try, are! if their try (as far as I can gather on the present occasion) is a failure then it has an excellent effect• ( T d ) That the Iraq GoTernment's present organization for ant i-smuggling is not only effective hut die an. (c) That while on the sea Kuwaitis take part in the smuggling, on land it is practically all done h Iraqi tribesmen, and if the Iraq Government have to shoot Iraqi trihesaen, then it is their affair and not that of His Majesty's Government or the Shaikh of Kuwait o (d) finally that any suggestion that we should 'pressure' to force the Shaikh to co-operate with the Iraq Govern ment should 'be resisted to the death I If necessary, if this question is exhtimed, you can say that 3rou know that I hold strong views on the matter and you suggest that I should 'be consulted.

After compliments, In several letters I informed you ahout the entry of Safwan Police cars into Kuwait territory and the aggression they inflicted upon my tribes, and I asked you to report the situation to those who are concerned with a view to preventing such aggressions. But it is with deep regret that th^ese oars are still penetrating into and disturbing the frontiers. In fact I am afraid of the consequence of this affair. Some of my tribesmen who are camped at the 'Hinnihiyeh', now report to me that they were proceeding from Kuwait to their camp with provisions for their families. On Monday last the 29th July 1936 they were 'between 'Baudhat Umm al~ *Aish' and ••Raudhat Ikhraim*. It was nearly afternoon when four armed Police cars came upon them. Without saying any word they (the Police force) seized the Kuwait tribesmen^ 13 camels and what was carried on them of rice,flour, sugar and a little of tea, coffee and coir ropes. The Police force then threatened 'beating the tribesmen,saying they were smugglers The latter said that smugglers would not openly take that road, nor they earrted a smuggling commodity. Finally thei camels were taken from them and they were dismissed on foot, I regret very much for such an action from the cars within Kuwait territory. I addressed t o you several letters in this connection, informing about the said cars and their aggressions, 'but I have not received a satis- factory result. My tribes camped at the northern frontiers are not in a settled state now. I beg therefore to request that you will at once report the case to those who are concerned, as an urgent matter.

After Compliments, I 'beg to inform you that the launch of the Fao Customs was seen by the cr rs of boats bound for Kuwait on Saturday evening (29,8.35.) She was sailing round the western cape of Bubiyan. She ordered on . of the boats at sail to cast anchor just where she also did at Bandur al Adaniya. This order was complied with. The launch remained at Adaniya till Sunday morning when the boat sailed for Kuwait. While reporting this to you I feel greatly disappointed at the Iraqi Government not having regard for us, nor reservation from these continuous encroachments on our bounderies both on land and sea - a question whose occurrence we had naver epected from our neighbour the Iraq 3-ovsrnment. There is no doubt that this is a question that no friend would permit and that would disturb the sincere friendship between tht two countries. I have communicated to you what had occured before both on land and sea, and have many requests for reporting the situation to the authorities concerned. But it id regretable that these ventures are still continued on th- frontiers. I would therefore repeat my request and beg H.M 'S G-ov rnment' s kind consideration of this questior. which it a@, Inst right and justice, and whose continuance would lead to nothin but the disturbance of minds.

I have taken it for granted that this second alleged raid is quite // iff distinct from the one reported in your telegram of August 27th 'but I shall 'be glad to receive confirmation of this and shall await your detailed comments 'before considering whether formal action is desirable at this time. Meanwhile, as I found the Prime Minister in rather buoyant mood on his return from the south, I * gave him the details of 'both alleged incidents and V\ v . ••• asked I ' i , ' ■ \ v, f ^'' r i . tenant-Colonel G.

I said I might have to return to the charge later when further details come to hand. The Prime Minister took notes of the dates and places and promised to do as I had asked. Since writing the above, I have received de /.it G-aury's telegram from Karachi of September 8th about the alleged entry of the Iraqi Customs launch into Koweiti waters. I will try and get at the truth of this through the Director-G-eneral of Customs, Bagdad, who is a friend of mine,and will defer anything in the way of formal representations to the Iraqi Government pending the receipt of the detailed examination of the evidence available. It must be the silly season.(31/43/36) British Embassy, 21st September, 1936 Bagdad.

Having repeatedly told me that their pre ventive officers have the strictest instructions for bidding entry into Koweiti territory or territorial waters (and I have confirmed this independently), they were as anxious as I was to get at the truth. They therefore sent post haste for the Customs logs. And this is the result. On August 27th, during daylight.

On August 50th he proceeded with the same launch to pick up 64 tins of sugar that had 'been dumped on the flats near the Fao salt works (i.e. in Iraq) and discovered 'by the police. This was the only movement of Customs launches until September 2nd 5 when No. 5 went on the usual patrols. This, you will see, is totally at variance with the information given 'by the Shaikh so far both as re gards dates and places. I would like to mention that the Customs people here (British and Iraqi) are quite positive that no Customs launch of three or four feet draught would ven ture under the command of an Arab far out across the Khor Abdullah even in daytime, and certainly nowhere near the West side of Bubiyan. This, not only on account of their instructions, but also because they are not sufficiently sea-minded. The same remarks apply a fortiori in regard to the hours of darkness or in anything like the uncertain weather that beats up in those parts suddenly. / On- o - On the face of it I cannot help thinking that the Shaikh of Koweit may have been led, not for the first time, unwittingly to give cover to smugglers who 'badly need it.

They replied that they were Kuwait tribesmen camped at Hinnibiyeh and that they were proceeding to Kuwait to buy their provisions of rice, dates and some other requirements* The police: 'You tell lie* You want to buy goods for smuggling The tribesmen: 'What is your proof against us for this charge? We are poor bedouins and do not jfcnow how to smuggle goods ,, * the police the latter laid them on the ground and started beating them without mercy, causing them to take much pain and telling them at the same time to say that they wanted to carry goods for smuggling* Thus the police tried to extract the poor tribesmen^ admission but failed at last After Compliments When the tribesmen addressed these last words tolast and realized the truth of their first statement. Thereafter, the police left the tribesmea and proceeded tramp -ing within the frontiers. The tribesmen arrived here today and came oanplaining to us of the baa conditions they are enduring from the cars of the said Post. In fact, I an greatly distressed on account of these actions which they carry out without any regard. There is no doubt that such actions would only result in the disturbance of good relations exists -ing between the two countries, which we do not like to ocour. We have often requested you to submit the case to the authorities concerned to stop these continued aggressions at the frontiers, and are anxiously awaiting the result♦ The bedouins were men of the 3ani Hussain section of the Dhafir who have since returned to the wells of JUIAIDA in the middle of the Iraq Neutral Zone, and theilr evidence is therefore not obtainable by Kuwaiti author ities* They were Khalid ibn Hufai and 8 companions*Translation of a letter No.R-S/ESQ, dated the 7th Rajah 1355 (23»9*36) from His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait to the Political Agent, Kuwait.

They were 3 persons driving 12 unloaded camels and were coming here . 11, to buy their provisions of rice, dates and some other requirements. When they reached at the eastern slope of the Liyah towards the end of Wednesday the 8th Jamad II 1355 (S6.8.36), 2 armed cars carrying some policemen came upon them. The Police asked them where were they proceeding and to what tribe did they belong? They replied that they were proceeding to Kuwait to buy their provisions of rice, dates and some other requirements. The Police; w You tell lies. You want to buy goods for smuggling**. The tribesmen: 'What is your proof against us for this charge? We are poor bedouins and do not know how to smuggle goods**. When the tribesmen addressed these last words to the police the latter laid them on the ground and started beating them without mercy, causing thaa to take much pain and tailing them at the same time to say that they wanted to carry goods for smuggling. Thus the police tried to extract the poor tribesmen's admission but failed at l^astlast and realized the trutli of their first statements Thereafter, the police left the tribesmen and proceeded tramping within the frontiers* The tribesmen arrived here today and came complaining to us of the bad conditions they are enduring frcm the cars of the said Post. In fact, I am greatly distressed on account of these actions which they carry out without any regard# There is no doubt that such actions would only result in the disturbance of good relations existing between the two countries, which we do not like to occur.

So far as I am concerned 1 would be quite prepared for the Committee to find that in a large number of cases their dates were too long ago for any enquiry to he practicable* Such cases would he noted as such by the Committee and this would form a definite decision* With regard to the other cases, a decision would be given by the Committee placing the responsibi.ity either on Iraq or Kowcit and laying/fV? laying down wlm^ compensation or damages should 'be paid by the offending party* In this way the elate would be wiped clean 'between the two States, and limi'dlio/bion 'both tiD the Sheikh and (vide paragraph G of my letter-' of i8tn January Ho.i♦2.678) would he ^c.Cccv/ccC cj cv ivu r&gt;v6^Jcvia^ ith^fiYU An equally important role of the Comciittee would he to deal with future caeeo proiaptly: vide paragraph cf of lay letter of 20th July, With regard to Mr. Bateman'e letter of 4th August (i • Zm 6297} in vti ieh he brings forward various ohjeotions to my proposal. Kr. Bateman's general attitude toward© these incidents can be deduced from the last sentence of the final paragraph of his JP (I letter'of £6th July to Colonel Loch (encloaure to P. 2.6.&lt;:91}, and does nc3t seem to me a very satisfactory one, Gf Mr. Batoman 1 s various objections, I think the only one that can hold water at all is that noted in paragraph 2 of his letter; i .e. that it would be unwise to do anything about any incident lest this should cause the Iraq Government to be unhelpful/unhelpful about settling the problem of the Sheikh's date gardens• While there is something in this argument, I am not of the oi-inion that it is 'by any means conclusive* With regard^t^ Mr. Bateman'e other arguments. He states (paragraph 4 (a)) that any attempt to re-open oaist incidents would be countered by the Iraq Government rtr ^ rcer enquiries into loss of life an tre; .aur/ in Iraq caused by nmugglinj from Koweit. This ''life and treasure 1, has been expended by the Iraq Government in shooting upJ Iraq i tribesmen engaged in smuggling, which is hardly the responsibility of the Koweit Government. Generally speaking Mr. Bateman appears to think that any attempt by to fuliil their responsibilities for protecting the Sheikh would once more put on the tapis the whole smuggling question. I do not concur in this. 'tie might discuss the question further, and then perhaps have an interdepartmental conference with the Foreign Office.COI^IDMTIAL No.0-304. \ * f p rom POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT. f IQ'tii October 1936# €»*&gt;w^^V8 ■■&lt;**.&lt;.

On a date which I now no longer know, I was sailing my craft, a be 11am, in the direction of Kuwait coming from Fiddaghiya, the Shaikh of Kuwait's estate on the Shatt al Arab. I had passed through and obtained permission from the Fao Customs the same evening. My load was palm branches and dates for the Shaikh of Kuwait. When I reached opposite and 300 yards off Bandar al- Adaniya, which is at the south-west corner of Bubiyan Island, I was, without hail or warning, come along side by a black launch# It was three o*clock Arabic of the night, a dark moonless night. The Mudir was the only man who spoke. I know him. He is from Fao and I think is the chief man there and is called Hajji Ahmad, iie asked me where I was going and ordered me to lie to at Adaniya. The launch remained at the same place at dawn I asked leave to sail on and it was given. The launch is somewhere about 20 foot long, a rather small one and painted black.

' 2• They all say that the eight men mentioned are Fidawis of the Shaikh of Kuwait. Fidawis are ordinarily paid only every three months and there is nothing unusual in that. The evidence of the men given in the Baghdad !ij despatch appears from my enquiries to be true. S. No.l and No.5 (Falih and Aid) have usually been detached under orders of Shaikh Abdulla al Jabir (ibn Abdulla thai they are his as Subah) a cousin of the Shaikhs^who is President of the Shara 1 Court and Chief Administrator of Kuwait town, and paid hy him out of the Town f s funds. They are therefore equivalent to Police Constables. 4. His Excellency has del Fidawis in his letter No.H/5/45, dated 22nd April 1956 (vide Kuwait despatch C-146 of the 1st May 1956) and might perhaps maintain that he had recently discharged them. There are of course no discharge documents issued to Fidawis n. on termination of their service, which usually only comes with death.

Generally speaking His Excellency takes care to be extremely well informed and it is locally said that not a mouse coughs in Kuwait but the Shaikhs know. 7. My views are that further explanations are required from the Shaikh, who could be shown the evidence of the men concerned. t(109/32/36) : HP' Britisn Enibassy, Bagdad. OctolDer, 1936. My dear Powle, I found an early opportunity to speak to Nuri about the six instances of the violation of the Koweiti frontier 'by Iraqi police, of which details were given in the correspondence enclosed in your imdated despatch No. C-291 to the Secretary of state for India. I recalled Nur^s agreement to a suggestion which I had made earlier in the year that enquiries into cases of this kind should be carried out by the British Inspecting Officer of Police at Basra and asked nim to arrange that Major Sargon (who has now returned from Leave) should be instructed to investigate the complaints now made by the Shaikh.

All the witnesses in the cases are rather unlikely to be available in Kuwait territory if the matter is left much later into the annual migration season. In any case they are unlikely to be collectable at very short notice, scattered as they will be in the desert. 5. Their evidence was taken in my presence and therefore I do not think that sending into Basra those available for re-examination by Sargon, which incidentally would cost money^o the Kuwait State, or their re-examina ti on here by Sargon would be very useful.

From Political Agent, Kuwait, To Political Resident, Bushire. Repeated H.M's Ambassador, Baghdad, No. 324. Dated (Drafted and en cyphered on 9 th November and signalled on) 10th November 1936• xn Your telegram No.301 arrived after my conversation with Minister last night, 1. First and in general His Hbccellenqy went over all the old groind, the loss to Iraq revenues, the costly preventive service etc, ending up, but rather weakly I thought, on the rt By Jingo' note. To all this I made little or no comment. 2. He then while admitting a great decrease in smuggling mentioned the increase in gun running, t/ 3. I pointed out that having looked at my papers I had found this had been said at intervals in the last year or so, notably by Yassin Pasha, but no evidence had been produced to substantiate what would by now be a flood of arms. If there were you would take a most serious view of it. LX 4. His Excellency said he would teltegraph to Baghdad from Riyadh to ask if any evidence could be produced. v 5. The Minister at this point showed that he thought there was no control over arms in the Gulf and appeared &gt;/ surprised that steamers could not land arms without permissiot; 6. What he said now troubled him only was the Mutasarrif*s report that the Shaikh had recently gathered his people and told them that his restriction on arms export to Iraq last Spring was now cancelled and encouraged them to export again. -\ |7. His Excellency said he heard in Baghdad that there was likelihood of an agreement between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and perhaps a similar agreement might be made between Iraq and Kuwait, I replied non-committally♦ 8. He said that he hoped on his return to Kuwait to discuss whole matter again* / ' The above covers most points mentioned by Foreign Minister last night. [/ 9. This morning however he said that after a discussicn with the Shaikh he was convinced the Mutasarrif's report and other reports about arms smuggling were entirely erroneous and as soon as he reached Riyadh he would telegraph to Baghdad to say so and that the Huler had said he was quite willing to re-emphasize by public notice his forbiddance of arms export which was most satisfactory and would make the Cabinet happy. X 10. The Minister who left today is due In Kuwait about the 19th November but dare not owing to home politics, wait for the Hon'ble the Resident due on the 24th. j/ 11. I am left with the impression that all he requires is something accomplished here to go back with to Baghdad and if he has something to show then the recent wilder accusations which policy may have dictated but facts do not support may be abandoned and relations improved. ISo For this I suggest (a) Public notice by the Shaikh forbidding export of arms to which shaikh appears to have agreed already and i s nothing new but may sound well in Baghdad. This might be followed up either now or later by (b) adopting a hopeful attitude about foreign .minister's suggestion given in para About this ques ion I an writing to you by air mail®- 2 ^ through the ordinary channel and interviews, rather than awkward, and here almost proverbially unsuccessful conferences I think any arrangement of the kind should be made. 5. further if only as a matter of departmenta_ l tactics 1 feel that to make an Iraq-Kuwait agreement depend upon a successful issue to the oaudi Arab-Kuwait agreement may stimulate the foreign Office, encouraged by the Ambassador,Baghdad as they would be, to greater efforts on behalf of the latter agreement, 6. It is too I think only when the Saudi Arab side is regulated that the Shaikh would feel himself, having given his people an opening for legitimate trade in that direction, able to agree to a regulation of traffic with Iraq, and not vice versa or simultaneously, most smuggling being with Iraq now, but the greater natural trade, if no blockade, being with Nejd. 7. As it now seems to be known to the Iraq10/- Iraq foreign Minister than an n an agreement with Saudi Arabia is in the air ,'t ^ne air a gave him only the vaguest of answers but hp 0 ile ^ as evidently fairly sure of tile facts and rH may dlscoVer ®°r e in Riyadh) it would seem useless to deny and a Mtv t ^ a pity to avoid the opportunity of placing it before us as an objective - and an objective asked for by the Iraq Foreign Minister - should the Shaikh agree. 8, If you toot; up the idea you would I think perhaps be instructing me officially to approach the Shaikh to ask if he agrees in principle to the conception of a similar agreement to the Saudi one. to be dealt with after the signature of the ^audi Agreement. With regard to the baud! Arab-Kuwait trade agreement, I venture to suggest, particularly now that an Iraq agreement is mooted, that it would be a good thing if the Foreign Office could hasten with it to a conclusion.- 4 - 10. Some little persuesion and appeal might overcome the Ling*3 objections to para l of the dratt as it stood - particularly as the agreement is only to be xor a Quite limited period - on trial. 4*4*4*Unless I hear from you otherwise I shall of course continue t 9 act on the lines given in your telegram No /aOl of the 8th Novem ber to the Ambassador, when the Iraqi Foreign Minister returns.

Oi •IIS After Complirnents , On Saturday last 29th Sha'aban 1555 (14th November 1956) two cars frora the Police Station at Safwan came up to al Liyah, where they ruet some persons of Jahra, Kuwait subjects, who had been on their way to al Liyah depressions to cut bushes for firewood there. They (the Police cars) ordered them to make their camels kneel and according to their request they did so. There were five camels escorted by three persons and four camels escorted by two persons and after the inspection the Police left thenu 2. On the 12th of November Police cars took the camels of Sa'ad bin Salih and his brothers, Kuwait subjects, at Hissu adh-Dhabi. There were 18 camels, of which five camels were restored and the balance the Police took off wLth them. 5. I n reality the incursion of the cars inside our borders is against the rights of friendship and neighbour liness. We have many tiioss reported to Your Jixoellency aboul them, but regret to see their incur si ons are going on, the consequences of which we fear. We therefore repeat our request for submitting the case to the authorities concerned for their attention to this disturbing action. Usual en ding • ii i : ^ ^ •a.AAGOVERNMENT OP INDIA. Department.

As Iraqi Grovernment have expressed desire for a settlement of smuggling problem agreeable to both sides and as settlement on same lines as that proposed for Saudi frontier would in my opinion be advantageous to Shaikh (and might very probably solve automatically the difficulties i over frontier incidents) I can see no harm in approaching Shaikh as suggested in paragraph 1 of my telegram 3337. Unless you see strong objection therefore please take action accordingly# 2. I agree that it would be most undesirable to ?defer establishment of frontier committee and commencement of demarcation (if agreed upon) until we await detailed agreement on anti-smuggling proposals which w ill obviously take time. All His Majesty's Government have in mind is that various frontier questions should be pursued concurrently and as quietly as possible since present Iraqi Government seems to be well disposed. If they are all solved this will in fact constitute a comprehensive settlement. 3.

Mr» rtendui presided at a meeting at tlie foreign Office on ictober &gt;th which was attended by Lieutenant- Colonel i*owie (polltioal iiesitent in the Persian Julf), Mr. Walton and Mr. Clauson of the India Office: and by Mr. da ?gallay» Mr. ard and Mr. illiaiss of the foreign Office. Mr. Hanael explained that the meeting had to consider a proposal put forward by lieutenant -colonel Fowle that a frontier standing comraitteu might be set up to deal with both past nd future frontier incidents. Lieatenant-Colonei jfowle then oat lined his proposal for a comiaittee • Tne conirnitte should consist of two siefobers, the political ;v;?ent at icoweit attending on behalf of the Sheikh, and an Iraqi official, say the Mutessarlf of jasra t on behalf of iraq. In the case of disagreement the Judge at Ba^ra (at present Judge .uloyd), British aatijeot in Iraqi eiapioy, should aot as arbitrator. He would have preferred an arbitrator without connexions with either party, out no auoh person appeared to be available. Judge '',10yd waa eminently auitabia and, as his appointment would be a a:r»at oonoession to Iraq, it misrht reoonclle the Iraqis to the sohaaie. The Commit tee should inveatipate both past alio future 'inoldent.' and no suggested that past incidents 8 h,uld be dealt with as follows:- If suffloient evidence . . -n ^ ■^■r'rtirrt ndt to be avai labia regarding any incident should pr the/the Committee would make a deolaration to that effeot and the inoident should thereafter be oonsidnred cioaed; if on the other hand the commit tea found sufficient eridence on whieh to pronounce an opinion, they would record their decision and their decision would be considered as binding on both parties; if the committee oould not agree in any particular case. Judge .loyd should be called upon to arbitrate. as regards future incidents he (Lieutenant Colonel ffowle) suggested that the members of the co nrnittee should me t as so m as possible after the Incident had been reported in order to investigate it on the spot and that in the case of dj s ate Judpje Mo yd should again arbitrate. The trouble at present was that by the tiie the authorities on one side of the frontier had been apprised of an inoident through the inevitably circuitous diplomatic channel, the time for proper investigation had gone by, with the result that nothing followed but an exchange of recriminations and denials The frontier committee oould, ho?^ever, be on the spot within two or three days, and this should lead to a great practical improvement in the investigation of olai s. He finally suggested that the committee should be set up as a result of an exchange of letters between the Irani government and His Majesty's government on behalf of the Sheikh. Mr&gt; 'flard pointed out that, while such a plan might be moat useful for future incidents, it would, he thought, only lead to diffioultiea to raise the caestion of the past incidents. In the first plaoe it would now be quite impose ible/IV Impoaeible to obtain any reliable dvidenoe about isoident8 going! back ub jfay as 193S. Secondly, the raising by Koweit of the question of past Incidents, i # e. of Iraqi incursions into Koweit territory,, would almost certainly cause the Iraqis to raise for their part the questi&gt;n of compensation for Iraqi police officers shot by smug^lerB, Mr♦ Henael also thought it Important to draw a distinction between the procedure for dealing with past and with future incidents. The two cases seemed to him to require quite different treatment* Apart from the fact that the Iraqis would probably not agree that past incidents should be investigated, it would be wiser not to jeopardise a promising plan for dealing with future incidents by insisting upon the investigation of the past. He then went on to suggest that the demarcation of the frontier should precede the getting up of a committee, since that would both facilitate the work of the committee and would at the same time provide a good peg on Jaich to broach u suggestion for the establishment of the committee* He thought that the frontier, which is laid down in documents and maps, could be easily demarcated on land by the use of pillars or obelisks and on the water by the use of beacons and buoys, not necessarily on the frontier ita© If but so placed ae to give intersecting lines of direction, as at the mouths of tidal harbours etc* In almost ail the incidents of which one side or the other complained it was found that there was a complete difference of opinion as to the side of the frontier on which the occurrence had taken pXaoe. Unoertainty 8 to the line of the-frontier was/f was in fact at the root oi' many of the frontier troubiesi. and a proper aemaroatIon seemed a necessary preliminary to a general Improvement of Ira- i -Konreit relations. Lieutenant Colonel jfowl e agreed, pointing out that demarcation would probably have a good phByohologlcal effect upon the Iraqis, who mi^ht hesitate to cross a clearly markeo frontier. It might be poasible to ploagh a furrow which could be supplemented by pillars etc. Mrt liendel then suggested that in that case the iimbassy at Bagdad shoald be aeked for their observations on the suggestion, and that the iioyal Air ^orce authorities should be asked to co-operate in demarcating trie land frontier (since they had a trainee personnel ready in the country) and Colonel /tare to advise on the demarcating of the boundary on sea. It should also be suggested to the ^inbassy that a com ait tee shouxd be established to deal vvith future incidents n the lines suggested by Ueatenant Colonel Fowle. The Babaasy should further be informed that the India Office considered it desirable (from the point of view of our relations with Kowelt) to tr/ to obtain some solution oi the past incidents on the lines suggested by deutenant Colonel Fowle; but that in the Foreign Office view any investi .^ation of past incidents, if it should prove desirable to carry out such an investigation, should be oarri 06 oat by a body entirely separate from that to be set tip for dealing with future Incidents. The oommente of the ^basay on theae last two augge .tlona alao should be asked for# Mr. fard reminded the meeting that the imbaeay were now/now opposed to doing anything to re-open the ouastion of •ottggling from Koweit into Iraq pending a settlement oi' the question of the date gardens belonging to the Bheikh of Koweit in Iraq. The danger was that by racing up pust incidents we m cht mafee the Iraqis revert to their smuggling grievances, thus jeopardising the prospects of the new proposals for disposing of the date gardens problem. uieuteuant Colonel Fowle agreed and said that he would not wi n to pat any pressure on the Ira 1 Government to settle past incidents, if such pressure would endanger the prospects jf solvin • the date wardens question, since this was clearly the raust important issue. Mr. Aendel concludea by saying that tne foreign Office would draft a despatch to Bagdad n the lines agreed upon, for the concurrence of the India )ffice•53/8 3 Te le oTam From jrolitical ^igent, nuwai t To iolitical Resident, i3 us hi re Dated and received 11th December i&lt; Uo.359 i'our telegram - o• 847 of 7th December, Shaikh is not willing to agree to proposal now as once he consents to communication to Iraq Government he will be unable to withdraw.

Political Agent reports that Shaikh is willing to give his consent to communication to Iraq Government of A** proposals referred to in paragraph 1 of your telegram 3337 of 2l3t November immediately after the agreement with Saudi Arabia is working but not before. His reasons for this are that until flow of trade with Saudi Arabia is restored temptation to smuggle into Iraq will be strong and he cannot give the requisite pledge to Iraq that this will be checked. 2.

After his return to Bagdad, Dr. Naji told me that he was satisfied that the report of the Mutasarrif of Basra had been based on a misunderstanding and he has not since referred to the matter. If I were now to ask for a letter, i fear he would qualify his absolution oi the shaikh in regard to arms smuggling with strictures on the Shaikh's encouragement of smuggling of other kinds and, as you know, i do not want to have that question raised again formally until I am able to suggest remedial measures.
