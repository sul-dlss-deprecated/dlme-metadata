I am convinced that the whole thing was a tremendous success. The difference in Nuri between the time he passed through here on his way to ibn Saud f s camp and yesterday was most remarkable. Last Thursday he was glum and pre-occupied while yesterday he was cheerful and full of jokes. Little Hafiz was wreathed in smiles and greeted me as he got out of the plane with the words : rt We have settled every thing' 1 . 3. r did not myself know that Khalid was so hostile; Hafiz said that he had been pretty bad but that he hoped that he had put that right. 4. Hafiz was also interesting about Philby. Philby never loses any opportunity of trying to poison the £.ing T s and everybody’s minds against Britain, and apparently he warned the camp to be very careful of Domvile, whom he described as a British spy and a Shaitan. Hafiz got in a good one on Philby by remarking that there was not room for two shaitans in the King’s camp, and by replying with an expressive gesture to Philby’s enquiry as to the identity of the first one. Philby v/anted to return with Nuri in the R.A.P.’plane but the King would not let him do so; and Hafiz says that his reason was he thought Philby would be lessharmful to everyone if he v/as kept under his, the King’s, eye as much as possible . it / is The Hon’ble It.Col.C.G.Prior, CIE., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.s A . 2 - is amazing that j^hilby still drav/e a pension. 6 .

The note alleges that the Iraqi Government have been guilty of breaches of the three treaties hitherto signed: Mohamerah, Bahra and the Treaty of Friendship and Bon Voisinage of 1951 in that: ao They have allowed the Nejd Shammar to reside in Iraq instead of returning them to Nejd (Treaty of Mohamerah). bo They did not try to prevent the Nejd Shammar from migrating to Iraq (Treaty of Bahra). Co They have distributed presents contrary to the stipulations of the Bahra agreement® do They have failed to take security from the Shammar after raids and have executed none of the penalties laid down in the Bahra agreement. e./e* They have not tried to prevent Iraqi territory from being used as a base for raids in Saudi Arabia. 7. The Saudi Government suggests either of the three following alternatives as alone affording a solution: (1) The Tribal Nationalities Treaty should be ratified, as signed, without any modification. (2) The Mohamerah agreement should be enforced and the Nejd Shammar returned to Nejd. (3) If the Iraq Government do not wish to enforce the Treaty of Mohamerah, the Nejd Shammar should be removed to a place beyond the frontiers. 8 . If one or other of these alternatives cannot be accepted, the Saudi Government will be obliged to enlighten Iraqi opinion as to the true position by the publication of all relevant documents. 9 0 The Note ends by adducing reasons why the original provisions of the agreement regarding grazing cannot be regarded as conflicting with Iraqi legislation. 10^ I gathered from Yusuf Yasin’s conversation that the real trouble lay not so much in the form of the amendments as in the fact that Nuri Pasha was in Ibn Saud's eyes personally responsible for the non-ratification of the agree ment and Treaty. He feels that as Nuri Pasha cannot v/ish the personal letters exchanged between him and Ibn Saud to be published! he will exert the necessary pressure and ensure ratification. The non-ratification of a Treaty already signed (I think an unprecedented experience for Ibn Saud) he takes very ill. Another sore point is, as appears from paragraph 1 of the Saudi note, the amount of loot acquired by the Nejd Shamma r/Shammar and for which no compensation has been paid* 11 « I was glad to learn on the day following my conversation with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that Hafez Wahba migh be sent by Ibn Saud to Bagdad to try and settle this vexed question on the spot. These matters, as I told Sheikh Hafez- appear to be more suitable for settlement between the two Governments than for decision by His Majesty’s Governmento 12o I am forwarding copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Bagdad (No. 356/672/17) and Cairo (Noo358/672/17), to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine (No. 357/672/17) and to the Honourable t%e Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 359/672/17).

Stonehewer Bird.0 Translation of a Note sent by the Minister for Foreign Affairs Bagdad to the Saudi Minister in Bagdad* No.SH/1826V/11712/V, Bebreto Bagdad* 27th December, 1939* Dear Minister, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that the Iraqi Government laid the following agreements before the Parliament in its last meeting: 1) The Agreement concerning administration of the neutral zcne 0 2) The Agreement concerning the regularization of matters relating to grazing and watering places* 3) The Treaty concerning the nationality of tribes* The Government recommended the Parliament to ratify them in order that they may be able to fulfil the requirements of the said agreements* The Parliament ratified Agreement (1) concerning the administration of the neutral zone 0 I shall therefore be glad to learn whether it will be possible to have the instruments of ratification exchanged in Bagdad or in any other place which the Saudi Arabian Kingdom approves* As regards the two Agreements (2 and 3) referred to above, I much regret to say that the Parliament had made some observations on Article 4 of each one of them and that the contents of the said two Articles do not agree with Iraqi legislation. In the course of the debates which ensued J in the Chamber of Deputies speakers were unanimous in emphasising the bonds which unite the two sister countries and/3 2./ lA- (g) and requested that a decision in the question of the tw« Agreements he postponed until both Governments ore in a position to draw up a fresh draft of Article 4 of both of them in a form which is consistent with the Iraqi legislation in force* I believe. Your Excellency, that the Saudi Arabian authorities will welcome any suggestion which will remove the difficulties which face the Iraqi Government in a constitutional question such as this and which will lead to a settlement of these outstanding questions which, as Your Excellency will agree, may be easily overcome given the brotherly relations existing between the two countries and the good will which each party bears for the other* I should like the settlement to be in a form which will respect the point of view of the Saudi Arabian Kingdom on the one hand, and comply with the wishes of the Iraqi Parliament on the other* To that end I would make the following suggestions: 1) As regards the Agreement concerning grazing matters: (a) Deletion of the last five lines 0 f Article 4 which will then read as follows: Shouid one of the High Contracting Parties desire to collect Government taxes from its tribes residing in the territories of the other High Contracting Party the proper authorities specified in Article 8 of the Treaty of Friendship and Bon Voisinage shall communicate with each other with a view to notifvinsr the said tribes of that desire'* (b) It would also be suitable to delete the word 'animals' which appears in line 5 of Article 1 , because the Iraqi Government do not collect taxes on these animals*J m Id 23 I 1940 / (2) Ag regards the Treaty concerning tribal nationalities, Article 4 relating to individuals who have acquired the nationality of the Government in whose territories they reside should he drafted on the principle that any person whose residence in the frontier district may he inconsistent with the interest of either of the two Governments shall he removed from-those districts* It is believed that the following form secures the said point of view and Article 4 will thus read as follows: u The two Governments undertake not to allow any one of the persons whose nationality has been changed in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of this Treaty to reside in any district where it may he feared that his so doing will cause difficulties to the other Governmento' I wish to enclose two other drafts for Article 4 and I request that they may he considered in comparison with the first draft* In view of the sincere friendship which, as Your Excellency has been able to ascertain, Iraq feels for the Saudi Arabian Kingdom and its earnest desire to do everything to promote brotherly and friendly relations between the two Kingdoms, I have strong hopes that the Saudi Arabian authorities will appreciate the truth of the explanation I have given in my present letter, and that thus the way may be opened to securing agreement between the points of view of the two parties in this matoero I trust that Your Excellency will communicate the result to me as soon as possible* tArt icle 4 . Draft No. 2. Any individual of the tribes whose nationality has been changed in accordance with the provisions of Articles 1 and 2 of this Treaty and whose residence in the neighbourhood of the frontiers of the two Kingdoms may, it is feared, cause difficulties to the other Government or whose existence there may give rise to crimes and disturbances, shall be removed to a distance so far from the frontiers that he cannot cause difficulties to the other Government or carry out his illegal objects. A rticle 4 . Draft No, 3. Should it become evident that the residence in the neighbourhood of the frontiers of any one of the individulas whose nationality has been changed in accordance with the provisions of Articles 1 and 2 of this Treaty is a cause of difficulties tc the other Government or has a bad effect on peace and security in its frontier areas, he shall be obliged to reside in some place so far from the frontier that he cannot carry out any action of the sort mentioned.IT Translation of copy of a Note sent from the Saudi Legation in Bagdad to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq. In the name of God the Most Merciful the Compassionate. No. 73/148/57 Dated: 26.11.1358 (January 6 th., 1940). Dear Minister, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Your Excellency’s secret note No. SH/l 8267/11712/7 of 27th. December 1939 and on instructions from my Government I submit the following to Your Excellency. # Before replying to that note I am glad to refer to the allusion made in your letter regarding the high spirit shown in the speeches of the members of the Iraqi Parliament emphasising the good relations existing between Iraq, and the Saudi Arabian Kingdom and the statement you made to the effect that I may be sure of the sincere friendship which Iraq bears for the Saudi Arabian Kingdom and the true desire of Iraq for everything that may promote brotherly and friendly relations between the two Kingdoms. I wish Your Excellency and the Iraq. Government to be assured that the Saudi Arabian authorities firmly believe that all the people of Iraq^ wish them nothing but good and that they have the most benevolent feelings towards them that a nation can have towards a neighbouring nation, more especially because of the unity of the two brother nations in race, history and devotion to the high Arab cause. I believe that you all confidently believe that the Arab people in the i^audi Arabian ivingdom, and at their head His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, have the same feelings towards15 18 towards their brothers the Iraqi people. This must have been confirmed to Your Excellency during your recent visit to Riyadh when you were received by His Majesty the King and heard him express his feelings of love and affection for Iraq and its people with the greatest possible enthusiasm. While mentioning this to Your Excellency I would add that I firmly believe that there is no one among the people of Iraq who would willingly see the interests and peace of Saudi Arabia prejudiced at the hands of any Iraqi, whoever he might be, or who would aoprove of a party of Shammar tribesmen committing a crime in their original territory and then migrating to Iraq and establishing themselves in the frontier regions for the purpose of plundering and robbing and disturbing the peace of that Saudi Arabia for which Iraq feels so much love and benevolence These criminals of Shammar who have settled on the frontiers, without a single exception were not led by any national or political motive to leave their original home neither were they compelled to go out by oppression or the attacks of enemies. Here in their own country are their friends and kinsmen enjoying a full share of comfort, tranquility and gcoa care. Those people only migrated to Iraq when they realized that their original country could not possibly allow them to make raids against Iraq or to cause disturbance on the frontier. They went to Irao in order to be able to continue their crimes. They attained their desire and lived under the protection of the Iraq Government and continued their disturbances and w.-ong doing. The surest proof of that is The list of looted property which I sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It amounted to 798 camels, 20 (loads of goods?), one mare,13 a 13 rifles, 11 pounds and 570 riyals. This is what was stolen in the last two years only. I am sure that no Iraqi would approve of such a state being allowed to continue between Iraq and the Saudi Arabian Kingdom even if there were no treaties between the two parties to prevent such occurences, but how much less when the provisions of the treaties clearly prohibit such actions in every way. 2. Before I explain the views of my Government on Your Excellency’s statement that certain points of Iraqi legislation prevent the ratification of the treaty concerning tribal nationality and the agreement concerning organization of pasture and watering places in the form in which they were drafted and signed in Bagdad by the Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs and the representative of the Saudi Arabian Kingdom, I find myself compelled to insert here verbatim quotations from the previous treaties between the two Governments so that Your Excellency may give them the consideration which they deserve as written and effective obligations with whose provisions local legislation should not be allowed to conflict, (a) Paragraph (B) of Article 1 of the Muhammara Treaty concluded on 7th Ramadhan 1340 corresponding to March 5th. 1922, that is soon after the Iraq Government was formed and shortly before the present regulations and legislation of Iraq had been drawn up, states: 'In accordance with the exception taken by the Government 'of Nejd to the frontiers claimed by the representative of the 'Iraq Government it has been decided that in view of the 'tribal decision Al-Muntafik, Al-Zafir and Al-Emarat shall go 'back to Iraq and the Nejd Shammar to Nejd etc.' Now* Now are the Iraq Government prepared to execute this text fU*. and to send hack to Tejd Shammar to Nejd? If they are prepared to do so the question will he considered closed. (h) Article 4 of the Bahra Treaty concluded in Rabi-ath- Thani 1344 corresponding to November 1325 (sic) (1925?) states: ’'The Governmencs of Nejd and Iraq undertake to 'prevent any tribe or sub-tribe migrating from one country 'to the other by all means in their power other than 'eviction or the using of force unless such migration takes 'place with the knowledge and consent of their Government. 'The two Governments undertake to refrain from 'offering presents of any kind whatsoever to refugees from 'the territories of the other Government and to look with 'disfavour on any one of their subjects who may endeavour 'to attrack the tribes to the other Government or to 'encourage them to move from their own country to the 'other'. Here I would draw Your Excellency’s attention to the history of the residence of these criminals of ^hammar (in Iraq) and ask whether the Iraqi Government have executed this article in respect to them. If you refer to the notes of this Legation dated number (numbers and dates of notes sent by the Legation when presents were distributed amongst Nhammar and other previous notes regarding crimes reported in the time of Muhammad Id should be given; you will find that the Iraq Government closed their eyes to the activities of these criminals of Shammar who took refuge in Iraq, that they granted them allowances, gave them assistance and permitted them to live as trouble-makers in the land. (c)r (c) Article 9 of' the Bahra Treaty states: 'should a tribe move from the territories of one Government to the territories of the other Government and then make a raid after its migration against the 'territory in which it used to live, the Government in v/hose territories the tribe lives shall have the right 'to take from it a sufficient security, so that in case 'such an attack is repeated the said security shall be forfeit. This is in addition to the punishment provided 'for in Article I and in addition to what may be imposed 'by the court which is provided for in Article 2 of this 'Agreement'. Have the Iraq Government done anything of this sort with the Nejd ohammar who took refuge in Iraq? Ho. And I believe Your Excellency will agree with me in that (d) Article 5 of the Treaty of Friendship and Bon Voisinage concluded on 20th. Dhu’l ^ada 1349 corresponding to 7th April 1931 and signed by His Excellency the present Iraq Prime Minister Geyed Nuri as Said, states: 'Each of the two parties undertakes to maintain good relations with the other party and to endeavour by all 'means in its power to prevent its territories being used 'as a base for illegal activities or preparations therefore, including raiding, directed against the peace and security These criminals of Shammar, without any exception, nave adopted the Iraqi frontiers as a base for that such action on their part and the omission of the Iraqi Government to do anything about it is in agreement with this explicit Article? of the territories of the other party ,r . their criminal operations day and night. Do you think5. A 3. The Saudi Arabian Government have asked and are still asking for the execution of these treaty articles, and they, for their part, cannot accept as an excuse for non-execution the allegation that the said treaties are contrary to local legislation for local legislation cannot be allowed to conflict with written and ratified obligations, as after they have been ratified, such obligations are considered to be part of the State’s laws. 4 0 The Saudi Arabian Government have overlooked the Iraqi Government’s neglect to execute their obligations as mentioned above, being desirous to have those obligations executed in an amicable way. But seeing that the article concerning Shammar in the Treaty of Muhammara has now been left unexecuted for about eighteen years and seeing that the Iraqi Government offer various excuses for not executing it, my Government think it better for the easing of the situation, to settle the difficulty of Shammar by giving them the opportunity to remain in Iraq if they so desired on the condition that they are prevented from causing harm to their original home. This condition could only be achieved by removing them all without exception from the frontier and placing them beyond the Euphrates or in a place as far from the frontiers as the Euphrates is. For the sake of this the Saudi Arabian Government have shown themselves willing to renounce their claim to consider these people as their subjects, but if they are not removed from the frontiers in accordance with the provisions of the latest agreement concerning tribal nationalities, the ^audi Arabian Government cannot renounce their claim to them and demand the execution of the provisions of the agreements concerning them.5. It is for the Iraqi Government to say that such and such thing agrees with the local legislation and that such and such thing disagrees with it, hut the Saudi Arabian Government say that they have concluded ratified and effective treaties and a tribal nationality treaty with the Iraq Government and in consequence the position as they see it is as follows: (1) Either the tribal nationalities treaty should be ratified as it was signed without any modification and fully executed as it stands or (2) that a return should be made to the treaty of Muhammara and the Nejd Shammar should be returned to Nejd. ( 3 ) Or, if the Iraq Government do not wish to execute the treaty of Muhammara, the least the Saudi Arabian Government can possibly accept is that Nejd Shammar should be removed from the frontiers to a place beyond the Euphrates. If none of these suggestions is carried out, the Saudi Arabian Government must say with regret, that the Iraqi Government insist on breaking their promises and they believe that the Iraq people do not approve of such a breach of faith. The Saudi Arabian Government will be compelled to publish the documents they have on this subject in order to acquaint Arabic public opinion in general and the Iraq people in particular with the irregular attitude which the Iraq Government has adopted. 6. As to the modification Your Excellency suggested in Article 4 of the Agreement concerning the regulation of grazing matters I do not know what there is in this article, as signed, which conflicts with Iraqi legislation. It seems toto me that the Iraqi Government have deleted from the article the reference to: (a) The coming of an official from the one country to meet the corresponding official on the other side. This is provided for in the Agreement of Friendship and Bon Voisinage and cannot he contrary to local legislation, (h) Service of the Government’s summons on their subjects. This is provided for in Article 3 in the Treaty of Bahra, whereby either Government may summon their subjects residing in territories of the other state to serve in armed expeditions. This proves that the summons is permissible and as the summons cannot be served except through some person it was provided in the grazing agreement that the summons should be served by and in the presence of proper officials on the other side. (c) The endeavour of the one Government by all means in their power to induce nationals (of the other Government) to comply with the summons of their Government. Is it contrary to Iraqi law for the Iraqi Government to say to a party or a group of the subjects of the oaudi Arabian Kingdom residing in Iraqi territory: “Your “Government summons you: obey the summons' 1 ? And is it contrary to Iraqi law to induce them to return to their original home in special circumstances? This article is the essence of the agreement concerning pasture. The object of it is to create a spirit of co operation between the two countries and to cause it to be known to the subjects of both parties that the two governments are in agreement about everything that is in * the* f /a 1 828 1940 J the interests and to the advantage both of themselves and oheir subjects. is such co-operation contrary to Iraqi law? I request that after this has been perused it may be applied to the previous agreements with which local legislation cannot conflict and that (phrase omitted?) co-operation between the two countries is the object of the two parties. As to the ratification of the agreement concerning the administration of the neutral area, my Government are prepared to ratify it. With highest respects.

For the reasons given in my telegram Ncu 224 of Lthe 25rd June] 1959 to Bagdad, His majesty's Government would prefer that these disputes should be settled without their intervention, e.g. by a commission under the residency of some ' “neutral' Arab. 2. his majesty's Government are, however, concerned at the continuance of these disputes and while anxious not to become involved in anything so formal as a commission with a British President or an official decision about the meaning of instruments like the Protocol of Uqair they are also ar*ious not to place any obstacles in the way of a settlement. If therefore Ibn Baud is anxious for His majesty's Government to take a hand you may (subject to any observations by His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad) inform him that, provided he can obtain the consent of the Iraqi Government thereto. His Majesty's Government will try to find an officer of suitable seniority who has had experience of Arab countries, but no previous connexion with either Saudi Arabia or Iraq, to act as an unofficial mediator.5 . Arrangement I have in mind is that this officer should study comorehensively all the problems connected with the frontier non separating and irritating the two governments, should visit the frontier and both capitals in an order to he determined hy drawing lots and should thereafter attempt to reconcile the views of the two governments in friendly discussion. 4-. For your own information. I realise that the task of selected officer would not he easy and might prove unsuccessful.

Ion Baud insists on their removal to Northern Jazirah or their expulsion to Nejd. Prime Minister maintains that first course is impracticable on account of large number of tents involved and that second would be shameful violation of Arab tradition. He proposed meeting of Ibn Baud and Regent and asked me to support it. I said I could not do so unless preparatory work was first done which would give the meeting chance of success. Ibn Baud telegraphed that though he would welcome meeting as demonstration of friendship and goodwill, he would like position to be further clarified before it took place. Today Hafiz Wahba tells me that Prime Minister has asked him to telegraph memorandum to Ibn Baud stating that if the reason of King s demand for removal of Shammar, is their depredations in Saudi territory he will take steps to put an end to these outrages by tightening control in Southern desert area and that if Ton Baud will name Chieftains whose behaviour has been particularly obnoxious he will also endeavour to give him satisfaction on this point. Hafiz Wahba considers that these proposals are useless but I urged him to advise Ibn Baud to take Prime Minister at his word as a test of good faith. Saudi /2. Saudi Arabia could, I said, properly demand that depredations should cease but it was Iraq's responsibility to decide what measures should be taken to satisfy this demand. Hafiz Wahba said he would telegraph advice to Ibn Saud in this sense* I shall be grateful for any action His Majesty’s Minister can see way to take to induce Ibn Saud who is evidently exasperated and perhaps with justification, to modify his present rigid attitude and so make negotiation possible.

Acting idnister for Foreign Affairs read to me yesterday a message from Ibn Baud in which he stated that Hafiz Jahba had been unable to reach agreement with Iraqi Minister. In these circumstances and as rumours were circulating as to the causes of disagreement between the tv/o countries he wished to publish all documents and correspondence concerning Iraqi-Saudi relations and to issue a proclamation explaining to the Arabic world his reasons for publication. The proclamation which Abdullah Suleiman read to me and of which I am sending full translation by bag expresses the fervent wish of Saudi-Arabian Government and people for a settlement of all differences with their brother Arabs of Iraq whose prosperity and security they sincerely desire. That this feeling is reciprocated by the majority in Iraq was shown by the success of the mission which visited Riyadh last year under the presidency of the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Unfortunately the execution of the agreement then reached was unexpectedly put off with the result that the clear atmosphere of sincerity and friendship had become clouded. 'The present position is due to a small number of persons who3-7 who give [?no] thought to the general Arabic interest, as the continuance of this state of affairs is harmful not only to the two countries but to the Arabian world it is best to set forth the whole truth. 2. Acting minister for Foreign Affairs said that Ibn Saud before publishing the documents or issuing the proclamation wished to consult me and His Majesty’s Government. I thanked him and said that, whilst I would of course immediately seek your instruction, my own view since the King had been good enough to ask for it, was that he should not publish documents or issue the proclamation, I did not think publication would have the desired effect and would probably merely cause bad blood. (I did not add that it might . cause grave inconvenience to His Majesty’s Government by causing a political crisis as I gathered from Hr. de Gaury that personal correspondence between Ibn Saud and Nuri Pasha showed the latter in a very unfavourable light). Although I have not yet received newspaper observations, I felt it better at this stage to refer Ibn Saud’s proposal to submit the differences to a commission (please see my t elegram No . 19). I merely said that His Majesty’s Government were not averse to the idea but would prefer to warn Arab President. If I had not until now made a communication to Ibn Saud on this matter, it was because I had learnt of Hafiz Wahba’s visit, which if successful would have made the appointment of the connission unnecessary. In the present circumstances I hoped H-*s Majesty would explore this method of reaching a settlement. If it proved successful there need be no guestion of publishing ary document. Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs promised to make a communication on these lines to Ibn Saud, explaining that this was my personal view expressly subject to Your Lordship’s instructions. I trust that in mentioning your attitude towards proposal, without awaiting observations of His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad, I have not exceeded my instructions. It appeared to me highly important to take Ibn Saud’s mind off publication of documents which Sir B. Newton states in his telegram would make mischief.

My telegram No. 85» On the evening of March 15th the Prime Minister and Hafiz Wahba had a long conversation alone and [2 grps. unde.] a long way in reaching mutual personal understanding. Hafiz Wahba, according to a message from the Prime Minister through Mr. Edmonds explained he had been disturbed by rumours which had reached him in London, and had made the pilgrimage an excuse to return home and see for himself. He had found King Abdul Aziz torn between prompting of his own instinct to support the Allies, and pro-German influence of his entourage. His Majesty had been much comforted to find in Hafiz Vahba support for his own view. This conversation too made it clear that the Nejd Shammar trouble was being exaggerated by hostile elements around *King* in order to embitter relations in the hope of embarrassing...embarrassing His Majesty’s Oroverrunent s and among those unfavourable to allied [?objective] was the present Saudi airabian Minister here 0 That was why s until private interview could be arranged Hafiz iahba had had to appear to treat Nuri Pasha with suspicion. message concluded with expression of hope that I would nov/ support the idea of meeting between*I[ing* and the Regent from which desired improvement of atmosphere might be expected. V. r hen I saw Prime Minister in another connexion a little later s he repeated what Hr. Edmonds hud told me. Assuring him of any assistance I could properly give*to facilitate* liquidation of misunderstandings 5 I left him in order to keep an appointment with Hafiz Hahba and the aaudi Arabian Minister who had asked me to receive them. At this interview T . ahba said that as a result of his further reports King i-.bdul Aziz [?had] [?stated] [?that he] was nov/ prepared to consider replying to’teri Pasha 1 s*questions (in Connexion* v;ith the nature of the complaints and the identity of the leaders involved) regarding Shammar. I congratulated His Excellency on having got so far in bridging the gulf and asked him whether he thought the moment ripe for the meeting envisaged. He said that his own view was that it would be better as a first step for Nuri Pasha himself to visit the King and so clear the atmosphere. Meantime.....^ 3. Meantime I had some conversation with the Regent at the races and found that, whilst he would in the last resort meet Abdul Aziz, he did not relish the prospect. He showed his intense dislike of the Saudi Arabian Minister here who, he said* had done much harm to the Hashimi family. This talk made my mind up that but little good could come from any heads of states meeting- Yesterday evening the Oriental Secretary and I, at their suggestion, met the Prime Minister and Hafiz Wahba at the latter’s *[? hotel]* Nuri Pasha explained his preference for the Royal meeting but expressed his readiness to go and see the King himself if I advised that course. As Hafiz insisted that [? in view of the] sentiments of the King's entourage it would be a * gaffe * not to profit by the change in His Majesty's [? attitude]* brought about by his reports from here I told the Prime Minister that I thought he ought not to lose this chance to clear up misunderstandings provided that he was not away from Iraq too long at this critical time. Since the above was drafted I have again seen the Regent to whom the Prime Minister had reported.. His Highness was grateful that the idea of his meeting Ibn Saud had been abandoned for he had never felt somehow that good could have come from that.

Having myself had some conversation with a prominent member of the opposition this 'morning I felt obliged to agree with this view. His Highness will inform Nuri Pasha that he and I agree that in the circumstances it would be best if Hafiz Wahba, who has made a favourable impress ion on the Regent, could be persuaded to go and explain the situation to his King, conveying assurances of goodwill from the Regent and the Prime Minister.

The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs called today and informed me that Ibn Saud had instructed him to acknowledge the receipt of my message about the publication. The King still felt it would serve a useful purpose if he published at least some of the documents but would await His Majesty's Government's views. 2. I took the opportunity of asking the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs to give Ibn Saud a message on the lines suggested m Bagdad telegram No. 85. I said His Majesty's Government hoped that the King would see his way to following Hafiz Wahba's advice to accept Nuri Pasha's undertaking to take steps to stop the depredations. Everyone recognised Ibn Saud's right to demand a cession at these depredations and Iraq was responsible for stopping them. Nuri Pasha had found a solution which he felt would have the desired effect and Ibn Saud would I hoped trust him. I did not mention the Iraqi Prime Minister's view that it was impossible either to [’restrain] or [’overwhelm] Nejd Shamraar as Ibn Saud would [2 grps. undec.] have invoked Article 1 of the Treaty of Mohammerah which they cannot [’unless they] return [? grp. omtd,]45 *&gt;. i entirely agreed that a meeting between Tbn Saud and the Regent is undesirable until the ground has been properly cleared. The Acting Linister for Foreign Affairs appeared to have no knowledge of this proposal but told me that Ibn Saud had turned down a suggestion that Huri Pasha should visit him (please see paragraph 10 of m y despa tch No. 19) as he did not think it would be useful until meaIurei~of agreenieST had been reached. Ibn Saud has bitter memory of 1920 ratification of the agreement on apparently complete understanding reached after personal contact with the Iraqi statesman. 4. V/hile I have urged Ibn Saud to take Nuri Pasha’s word I [’share] Hafiz Wahba's doubt as to the success of the demarche. Depredations are perhaps the sorest point but as will be seen from ^ enclosures to my_des E atchNo^^_there are others arising out of the presence of Nejd Shammar. Could not the Iraqi Government be induced to remove at least a proportion of the tribe? My Iraqi colleague, as reported in my despatch No. 19, thought it possible, if sufficient inducements were held out, to move the whole tribe, and urged this as a solution. Nuri Pasha is after all now merely offering to [grp. undec.] which it is the strict duty of any Government to take.

Nuri Pasha says he has been able to overcome the Regent’s objections which, as His Highness told me, were based solely on delicate political situation here (see my telegram No. 91) by undertaking not to leave country till next week when the trial of the murderers of the late Minister of Finance will be over and first budget debate finished. Iraqi Government having no suitable aeroplanes or pilots he asks if Royal Air Force could convey him, Hafiz ,/ahba, a secretary and perhaps a member of the Government to and from Ibn Saud's camp near Rumaihiya, for, unless he flies, visit will not be feasible as he cannot spare the time to make the j ourney/#' 4-7 journey overland.

Amir Faisul has given me letter from Ibn Baud declaring that he can no longer ignore Iraqi policy and propaganda which have for object either to effect union with Syria or to place a Sharif on the Syrian throne. Le considers the second the most dangerous in view of hostility of*Sharifian* family to him and that if either is obtained *[?more]* will follow and next *goal n will be the Rejaz and perhaps even Persian [? Oulf] and Nejd. Hitherto silent out of friend ship for His Majesty's Government lie is now compelled to ask them either to declare their policy towards him in such a manner as to reassure him or else counter the efforts of Iraq wherever he finds them being used. Ms influence he asserts is quite as powerful as theirs. Faisul says the King is very angry with Nuri whom he accuses of having shown many important persons in Iraq garbled version of personal letter which the King sent him in April about Arab attitude to Great Britain and France, in order to convince them that the King is working with Great Britain against Arab cause (you have copy of the letter but I have no reference here). Faisul asserted that it would be easy for the King to raise revolt in Iraq immediately ...2 . immediately. Neither Faisul nor the Ling referred to recent extension of powers to _jnir Abdullah but this is doubtless one of the causes of their anxiety. I thought it well not to begin by saying that the Ling must not take any action which might cause trouble in Arab world since he would in any case await your reply before taking a decision. Obviously he would like an assurance that the throne of 0 .yria will not be given to a Sharif. I told Faisul that it seemed to me unlikely that the French would wish to encourage Iraqi influence in Syria but that they would not consult us if they wished to give the throne to a Sharif any more than we consulted them about King Faisal. The Amir agreed but said that the French would surely inform us beforehand and the Ling relied on us to warn him. Recent telegram from Bagdad shows that the King is right about Nuri’s wish to have a Sharifian King in Syria x x but whether the French have done more than sound him as they sounded the King I do not know. If his fear of addition of third Sharifian ruler to the existing two could be dissipated the risk of quarrel with Iraq would be oostooned if not entirely removed. Perhaps you have some indication from Paris about French intentions. Nuri had learned that the Amir Saud had left the capital with armed force for unknown destination.

Bullard, (Jedda) : To SAUDI ARABIA Foreign Office, 23rd June, 1939, 7 p.m. No. 99. 0:0:0; 0:0 Your telegram No. 75 [of June 12: Ibn Baud’s letter to Sir R. Bullard objecting strongly to Iraqi policy and propaganda, especially regarding Syria], I have no further information regarding intentions of French Government, Sir E. Phipps’ despatch No. 648 [of May 16] shows that French Minister for Foreign Affairs, when asked about the rumoured French intention to establish a monarchy in Syria, replied that all this was very vague at present, and would not admit that French Government had any particular candidate in view to occupy the throne. I doubt whether French Government have yet come to definite decision to have a monarchy at all, still less to adopt a Sharifian candidate. 2. Question is in any case primarily one for decision by the Mandatory Power and the people of Syria, If, hov/ever, the Iraqi Government were to make it known that they favoured some particular candidate, it would be difficult for His Majesty’s Government to take exception to their action on the ground that it amounted to improper interference with Syrian affairs, cand still less to improper interference with Saudi Arabian affairs, seeing that such action by itself would seem to constitute no threat to any part of Saudi Arabia. 3. I presume that Ibn Saud's real fear is the formation of a comparatively strong and influential bloc of the northern Arab States, which might rapidly overshadow Saudi Arabia in political importance, and dispose, once and for all, of Ibn Saud’s claim to be regarded as the political leader of the Arab world. It would from Ibn Gauds point of view be worse still vt Iraq, Transjordan and Syria were all ruled| ruled by members of the Sharifian family, who might possibly- even attempt to stir up revolt in the Hejaz or other parts of present Saudi territories. But remote apprehensions of this kind would not entitle Ibn Saud to regard Iraq's present policy as directly aimed against Saudi Arabia. There can presumably be no fear on his ja§.rt of Iraqi attempts openly to seize his territory. 4, His Majesty's Government have themselves recently taken strong exception to Iraqi propaganda, especially regarding Koweit; but it is oovious that no activities in which the Iraqi Government have been engaging could possibly be regarded as justifying any violent action by Ibn Saud, such as tribal raids into Iraq, and any such action might obviously lead to most serious consequences. 5. I think that, subject to your observations, your reply might be on the following lines. 6. I have learnt with regret that anything said or done by the Iraqi Government should have led Ibn Saud to think that the Iraqi Government are pursuing a policy contrary to his interests. 7. His Majesty's Government have themselves found it necessary recently to take exception to certain aspects of Iraqi propaganda, especially propaganda directed against Koweit. His Majesty's Govern ment have made their views regarding the objectionable nature of this propaganda clear to the Iraqi Government. There is no reason why Ibn Saud, if he shares the views of His Majesty's Government on this point, should not also point out to the Iraqi Government that such propaganda is open to strong objection, 8. At the same time, it does not appear likely to His Majesty's Government that Iraq has aggressive intentions towards Saudi Arabia or the Persian Gulf States. Even if such ambitions wore entertained in certain quarters in Iraq, it would still be doubtful whether they would consitute a real threat to Iraq’s neighbours. No one can foresee the distant future, out so long as Ibn Saud and his successors rule what is now Saudi Arabia, and so long as His Majesty’s Government6*. 3. Government maintain their position on the shores of the Persian Gulf, as ^.ley hav e every intention of doing, it is clearly beyond the power of Iraq to achieve any territorial expansion in that direction. 9. As regards Syria, I 'understand that the Iraqi Government hope that eventually there may be some form of closer union between some of the nrab States. But so far as Syria is concerned this must depend upon the end of the French Mandate. These Iraqi hopes there fore are not likely to be realised in the near future, and need surely not affect Iraq’s present relations with other States. 10. As for the question of the Syrian throne, His Majesty’s Government think that this is primarily a question to be decided by the people of Syria and the Mandatory Power. They do not believe that any decision has yet been reached, even whether there is to be a king at all 0 His Majesty's Government had not heard that the Iraqi Government wished to support some particular candidate for the Syrian throne, and they are not aware who this candidate may be, but if Ibn Saud holds different views on the suitability of certain possible candidates, it would seem desirable that a friendly discussion should take place between the Saudi Arabian and Iraqi Governments with a view to reconcile any difference of outlook. 11. In general, His Majesty's Government believe that there is no question affecting the interests of the two neighbouring Arab monarchies which cannot be solved by the normal methods of friendly and confidential consultation, I hope that Ibn Saud will find, in the course of such conversations, that the Iraqi Government have every desire to take full account of his position and to treat out standing problems in a spirit of goodwill. It would meanwhile be best to refrain from any action or public statement which might merely embitter Saudi-Iraqi relations. Hasty action of this kind by Ibn Saud would certainly not be the best means of inducing Iraq to modify» 4. modify her policy towards Syria in such a way as to take more favourable account of his interests. Perhaps, in order to initiate conversations, Ibn Saud might be prepared to repeat his invitation to General Nuri, or some other leading Iraqi statesman, to visit him in Saudi Arabia, or alternatively he might send one of his own sons to Bagdad. A full and frank exchange of views upon Saudi- Iraqi relations could not fail to be of mutual advantage. 12.

K CONFIDENTIAL. \ i938_J Section 2. [E 2059/1573/25] Copy No. Sir R. Bullard to Viscount Halifax.—(Received April 11.) (No. 55.) My Lord, Jedda, March 22. 1938. SEVERAL communications which I have had the honour to send you recently will have suggested that the Iraq Government are pursuing a very active policy in Saudi Arabia. this activity has coincided with the arrival of the new Iraqi Charge d’Affaires, Saiyid Thabit Abdul Nur (Iraq Personalities No. 83 of 18th January, 1937), a very busy-minded man of Christian origin. When I first received information from the Saudi authorities of the various proposals made to them by Saiyid Thabit I was inclined to suppose that he was acting to some extent on his own account, but in each case I have been shown documents proving that the proposals were official. The proposals are three in number :— (1) For the conclusion of a military agreement to implement article 7 of the i Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance (mv telegram No. 76, dated the 19th March). (2) For unification of the currencies of Iraq and Saudi Arabia (my telegram No. 75, dated the 19th March, and mv despatch No. 51, dated the 21st March). (3) For the conclusion of a triangular quota arrangement by which Saudi Arabia, in return for a commission, would refuse to take Japanese exports unless Japan agreed to take Iraq exports up to the same value (my telegram No. 75, dated the 19th March, and my despatch No. 44. dated the 11th March). 2- 1 here are indications that the Iraq Government have not informed His Majesty’s Government of their intention to put these proposals forward. Whether this secrecy is compatible with the provisions of article 1 of the Anglo-Iraq Ireaty of 1930 is not for me to say. My concern is with the interesting fact that Ibn Saud turns to a non-Moslem and “imperialistic” Government for disinterested advice about proposals from a Moslem Government which is, moreover, bound to him by a treaty of Arab brotherhood and alliance. He is clearly afraid lest he should be lured into some arrangement injurious to his interests, and he has now extended to the economic field the suspicions which he has always held about the political activities of the Iraq Government. Of those suspicions the Foreign Office have been kept informed. They rose to their highest point during the Hikmet Sulaiman regime, but they have not subsided completely since it came to an end. Ibn Saud does not regard Iraq as a purely Arab country. He is fond of saying that the Iraq Arabs are from Nejd, but he regards the country as largely non-Arab in policy as well as in population and as liable if not to be pro-Turk at least to act under Turkish influence or menace. 3. One thing which Ibn Saud resents in his relations with Iraq is the tendency which he detects in them to try to take the lead in the Arab world at his expense. He has spoken of this more than once, in connexion with the Palestine question and with the negotiations with the Imam about the Treaty of Brotherhood and Alliance. That the Iraq Government may sometimes be heedless of Saudi feelings is illustrated by a remark which Saiyid Thabit made to me recently, in connexion with the arrangements for a joint Saudi-Iraq survey of their common frontier. It appears that the Iraqi' representatives arrived at the spot where the survey was to begin, but the Saudis were not there, and the Saudi Government said that their party could not arrive for another fortnight or more. “ I do not understand ” said Saiyid Thabit, “ why the Iraq party could not act for both sides, but though I talked to Fuad for an hour [280 1—2]•V - • ^ he couldn’t see it.” The supposition that a Government under a Nejdi king, and administered largely by Syrians..^one^f them Fuad Bey), would fall in with such a suggestion showed some lack of imagination. 4. A similar lack of imagination on the part of the Egyptians in the Hejaz is suggested in my despatch No. 60, dated the 30th March, 1938, where I reported their wish to flaunt Egyptian flags with offensive freedom. Apparently common membership of the “Arab world” is not of itself sufficient to create sympathy and imagination and confidence between the various members. 5. Copies of this despatch are being sent to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Bagdad, Cairo and Jerusalem. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD.COPY (3 2091/1573/25) No.137. (299/9/38) AIR MAIL . (Copies by Bag). My Lord, With reference to Sir Reader Bullard’s despatches to Your Lordship Nos.44, 51 and 55 of March 11th, 21st and 22nd, concerning certain proposals made to the Saudi Arabian Government by the Iraqi Charge d’Affaires at Jedda, I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship herewith a copy of a record of a conversation which I had recently on this subject with the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs. 2. Your Lordship will notice that my impression at that time was that Thabit Abdul Nur had been acting without instructions, although I have since seen from Sir Reader Bullard’s despatch No,55 of March 42nd that he is satisfied that Thabit was acting officially. 3. Taufiq Suwaidi said nothing to me about the conclusion of a military agreement with Saudi Arabia, but he may very well have thought it discreet to keep silence on this point. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. I have etc., (Signed) MAURICE PETERSON. &lt;•1930 1 1938 BRITISH EMBASSY, BAGDAD. 6th April, 1938. The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K. G. , G. C.S.I. , G. C. I. E. , etc,, etc. , etc.n quota • • • &amp; I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning whether he could tell me anything about the Iraqi negotiations with. Saudi Arabia to which he had referred recently in the Chamber. He said that these negotiations had concerned mainly the abolition of visa formalities for the people of the two countries when moving from one country to the other. This was a Saudi idea and the Saudis stood to gain far more than the Iraqis as the number of Saudis who came into Iraq was much greater than the number of Iraqis who went into Saudi Arabia. There had also been some talks about preferential tariffs for Saudi home produce imported into Iraq and for Iraqi home produce imported into Saudi Arabia. He would look up details of this and give them to me at a later meeting. I then mentioned the new Iraqi Charge d’Affaires at Jedda and asked how he was getting on. Taufiq Suwaidi replied that Thabit Abdul Nur was being very active and went on to give me an outline of the negotiations mentioned in Jedda despatch No.44 of March 11th. Taufiq Suwaidi said that Thabit had made two proposals to the Saudi Government (i) That the Saudi Government should make Japan import from Saudi Arabia goods equal to a fixed proportion of the total quantity of Japanese goods sold in Saudi Arabia. He had mentioned 15^. If this were done, Saudi Arabia having nothing to export to Japan could then, for a consideration, transfer this P r/ « jL-J * ~\ fi 7* rv Enclosure in Bagdad despatch Ho.137 of‘,6th April,'l938 . 4 ' ^ v —J V Minute.quota to Iraq, who would thereby increase her exports to Japan to an amount equal to 15$ of the total Japanese exports to Saudi Arabia. (ii) That Iraq should run the Saudi Arabian currency and pay the Saudi Arabian Government a share of the profits. Taufiq Suwaidi said that Thabit Abdul Nur had whetted the Saudi appetites by talking of a clear profit for them of £100,000 a year out of such a scheme. The Ministry of Finance had, however, been alarmed by such suggestions and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had telegraphed to the Charge at Jedda telling him to go slowly and to make no promises before he had reported his proposals in detail to the Iraqi Government, who would then send him instructions how to proceed. My impression, though Taufiq Suwaidi was not explicit, was that both of these schemes had been devised by Thabit Abdul Nur and had not been put forward on instructions from Bagdad. (Intlld.) M.

In particular co-ordina tion of training, arms and medical services mentioned. Eventual inclusion of Yemen contemplated. Ibn Saud asks for advice of His majesty's Government in confidence. 2. Whether this would be advantageous or at least innocuous to Saudi Arabia I leave to military experts to judge. If it would, then for us to advise against it would be invidious, the more so as we have been unable to assist Ton Saucj. in various military matters. Moreover King may have to reject other proposals made by Iraq e.g. currency (my telegram No. 75 of March 19th) and it would be awkward for him to refuse to take some action under Article VII. Subject to views of His Majesty's Ambassador Bagdad, I suggest reply in this sense '''while this is primarily a matter for settlement between signatories of Treaty of 1956. His Majesty's Government see no harm in King agreeing to discuss any detailed proposals Iraqi Government may make for co-ordination of military systems as provided in Article VIP. 5. It seems probable that the parties would find at the outset that the Iraqi system of training would not suit this mainly tribal country. Me might perhaps give Ibn Sand our opinion to that effect.

With reference to my Saving telegram No.34 of the 23rd November, I have the honour to inform you that in the course of a farthertalk about his visit to Riyadh the Minister for Foreign Affairs told me that he had discussed with King nbdul Aziz the accession of the Yemen to the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance signed at Bagdad in April last. You will remember that article 6 provides that both signatories shall endeavour to secure the accession of the Yemen to this treaty. 2. King Abdul Aziz had said that he feared that, in view of the present suspicious attitude of the King of the Yemen towards himself, it would be of little use for him to ask His Majesty to join the alliance. He had, therefore, proposed that the Iraqi Government should send a delegation to Sanaa for this purpose. He had also suggested that the delegation should travel via Saudi Arabia and had promised that, in addition to making all arrangements for the journey, he would provide them with letters to King Yahya in which he would give his full support to their mission. 3* Dr. Naji-al-Asil told me that the Iraqi Government had been much taken by this proposal and had chosen Jamil Beg al Madfai to head the delegation. He hoped that they would set out on their journey quite soon, but recent news from the Yemen indicated the possibility of an outbreak of disorder, and if enquiry showed that the situation seemed likely to become serious their mission might have to be postposed.4* I arn sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda and to the Political Resident at Aden. • I have, etc. ARCHIBALD CLARK KERR.

None of these questions appears to involve any important British interest except possibly that of the delimitation of the frontier. I understand from Mr.Sdmonds that it is possible that the Iraqi and Baudi Governments will agree.,that if inaccuracies are discovered in the geographical coordinates given to any wells, hills or other places mentioned in the frontier described in the xlrst protocol of Uqair, the delimitation commission which the BhUui Government have suggested should be anoointed, shall be guided in their work by the actual places rather than by the coordinates assigned to them.

On the lar Office map of 1/1,000,000 dated 191&amp;-18, this, as you know, is shown on the intersection of latitude 32° north the two countries with/ The Right, Honourable7 . v-ith longtitude 390 y a8t&gt; whereas the latest surveys nlace It about 15 miles to the ;orth-east of this point. 5. If, therefore, the frontier between Iraq and Saudi Arabia riacti 1° at the ^abal Anaza and not at the intersection of tha interseotion of the lines of latitude and longtitude mentioned above, some adjustment of the frontier between Transjordan ana ^audi Arabia laid down in the Hadda agreement will presumably become necessary. This latter line is described as starting from the point of intersection of meridian 39° s and parallel ^2 [ w and, unless it is altered, a considerable gao will be left between the end of the Iraqi and the beginning of the Transjordan frontier lines. 4. Other mistakes,which, as you are aware, have latterly been detected in the 1/1,000,0 0 map, such as the position given to Judaidat al Arar and wukur, would, r. JSdmonds tells me, ;ive rlr e to little trouble, as the bedouin tribes of this part of the country have naturally observed as the frontier the nhces named in the Uqair agree: icnt and have no understanding of the inaccur acies of the map on which it was originally worked out. 5 * ?ba ^ udi proposal regarding tha Neutral 2one l e that it ehouiu ;,e abolished by eatabliehing a frontier line drawn straight fro, the junction of the wadi al .ujah with the Batin, to Bir Auaab. 'fhia proposal ia being examined by the Iraqi Oow.rnm.nt, but as at present the only important feature of this territory is thevotering Places used by the bedouin tribes of ajd and Iraq, it does not appear that Kla Majesty’s Government need be concerned as to the a* mer in which it is dealthwith by the two limitrophe governments. 5. A. rega da extradition. Mr. Edmond, tells me that he under stands that the oaudi Arab Government are asking for an agreement considerably wider it scope than that signed at neooa in April 1931 .7. I am sanding copies of this despatch to His a,jesty f s Minister* at Jsdda and to His Majesty's onsul—Q-ener'al at oeirut. I have, etc*, (Sgd) Archibald Clark Kerr* :My dear Archie, You may like to have a private word of explanation about our attitude towards the question of the frontier between Saudi Arabia nd Iraq, as developed in your official despatch No. 89 (17/25/36) 2 . I should ©xolain in the first olaee that we have long been familiar with the discrepancy between the true position of the summit of the Jeoel Anaiza as now surveyed or. the ground and the intersection of latitude 3i North with longitude 39 .Nast - given in the Protocol of IJqalr — a geographical description which is reproduced by itself In the Hadda Agreement. In our view there is no doubt whatever that the true summit of the Jabel Anaiza as now surveyed must oe regarded as the terminal point of the frontier, since the geographical coordinates are quoted in the Protocol of Uqair merely as a supplementary or explanatory, and not as a substantive, . definition. Indeed they are only mentioned as giving the approximate position. 3. The point is o: considerable importance to us in connexion with the sector of the Transjordan- baud! frontier laid down in the Hadua Agreement. The of the 17th February geographical description of it - i.e. the approximate negotiators/ His Excellency 3ir Archibald Clark Kerr, K.C.M. :.negotiators of that Agreement plotted the frontier on tii© 1913 edition of the one in a million War Office international map, and, as so plotted and shown on that map, trie frontier is a more or less reasonable one* It now turns out however that the ohysioal features are in lact wrongly shown on that map in relat on to tiie geographical coordinates, with the result that If the frontier were plotted on the ground or on a revised map purely in the light of the geographical coordinates quoted in the Hadda Agreement for purposes of definition, a new and most unsatisfactory frontier in relation to the physical features would result • ve are satisfied here that the Ha .da frontier should follow as closely as possible the line drawn on the 1913 map i,j rslatl o i to the physical feature s as shown on that map, and that the geographical coordinates quoted in the Hadda Agreement should therefor© be disregarded where they do not correspond to that line, our strongest legal argument in support of this view, however, is the fact that the !?orth-Eastern terminal of the TransJordan-3 udi frontier must correspond with the North-Western terminal of the Irani-Seudi frontier, and thereiore, in view of the phraseology of the Protocol oi Uqair, which defines the latter terminal, that it must lie at the true summit of the Jebel Anaiza and not at the purely geographical point mentioned in the Hadda Agreement. Once this point is established the rest of the frontier will follow. mII this of course is rather outside your ii.mediate sphere, but I thought it might be useful to you to know that the establishment of the ’orth- Western terminal of the Baudi-Iraqi frontier at the true/true summit of th« ffebel Anaiza and not at the geographical point mentioned as a sunnloraontary definition in the rotocol of Uqair will be very dexinitely to our advantage, and very helpful to us in our negotiations with the Saudi Government about the VransJordan frontier. 5. As regards the neutral zone, the matter seems to be entirely one for the Saudis and Irakis to battle, between themselves, but our experience here, generally speaking, has been that neutral zones are an unmitigated nuisance, and that if they could be got rid of the situation is likely to be corsiderably simplified. They have in particular given us a great deal of trouble in connexion with recent negotiations for oil concessions in Arabia. 6. As regards extradition I was under the impression that the settlement arrived at in Mecca in April, 1931, had been found to offer a very satisfactory solution of existing difficulties. I am not sure whether we are called upon to advise further in regard to it, but the Treaty Department generally have rather strong views On extradition questions, and ii you are in any doubt therefore you taay like to senu us a separate despatch on the point. Yours ever, (sgd) G.W. R r sD] L.\ 0 \ Copy* (K 1166 / 62 / 26 ) (^2/27/66) BRITISH Y f B 0 D. 20th Febr &amp;ry 9 1936. My dear George, ith reference to my despteh io.39 of February 17th about, the Iratji Goveriuflent’s negotiati ns with Baud! rabia, I enclose a copy of a note prepared by iSdraonds for hie minister on the Iraqi - Baud! rabia boundary and the neutral zone. In his covering letter Edmonds writes that he th nks that the audi proposals for the bisection of the neutral zone and the demarcation of the frontiers are not likely to be pressed, but that importance is attached by the Baud! delegation to the Dahainsh&amp;h dispute and to the amendment of the extr dition agreement. Both of these are hardy annuals carefully cultivated by Ibn Baud. They are, however, solely the concern of the Iraqi and Jfcudi Governments and I need not bother you with det;ils. I learn from Yas;in i asha that the revival of these stale aud antiquated differences has rather overcast the dawn of a new rabi&amp;n brotherhood which some opti lists saw on the horizon and, in consequence, the treaty of alliance is being extensively re-dr fted. I gather that Yassin h s done some plain speaking to Yusuf Yasin and h^s told him frankly that Saudi , rabia clearly cannot \ d. • Rendel Esq.,G. ,0.carmot help IraQ effectively in any circumstances until she becomes .ore civilised and that, on the other hand, he must not imagine that Iraq will allow herself to be drawn wilJyniliy into any complications in which iig j bdul z£i£ may become involved with states either members or non-members of the eague. Yusuf vasin apparently asked what Iraq would do if &gt;audi rabia were to go to war with Great Britain; Yassin Just told him not to be silly. Yours ever, ( igd, Gorell Barnes, (for the mbasrador)SAUDI IRAs, NSGOTI .TICKS : i ote No&gt;4 , The Boundary, !• Shaikh Yusuf i 1 Yasin has proposed: &amp; that the lieutral Zone shall be divided between the two States; b, that the boundary shall be demarcated. 2. The i*ele\ ant article in the Treaty of Muharranara reads as follows:- According to Article 1 (a) the Muntafiq, Dhafir and Amarat tribes belong to Iraq, similarly the Shammar Nejd belong co Kejd. The wel^s a^.d I'nds used fro a old tiraes by the Iraq tribes shell belong to Iraq and the wells and lands used from old time by the Shammer Nejd shall belong to i;ejd. In order to determine the location of these lands and wells and to fix a boundary line in accordance y/ith this principle, a committee shall be formed consisting of two persons and presided over by a British official selected by the High Uorarnissloner; the com -ittee will meet in Baghdad to fix the final boundaries, and both parties will accept these boundaries without any objection* 3. The Com .ittee' provided f or duly met at Uqair ax.d fixed the final boundaries* The description is embodied in Uqair protocol Ho.l. The characteristic feature of this description is that the boundary line is made to run in a series of straight lines between points named on the map, which are for the most part groups of wells* 4* With regard to proposal (a) my observations are as fol ows The neutral zone is a lozenge shaped area containing a large number of wells known as Tiw*al adh Dhafir, i.e. the deep wells of the Dhafir. In fact the Dhafir claim them all, even5 even 1 Uqubba, the well at the southern obtuse angle. The lozenge is not nerfect and a straight line joining the eastern and western acute angles would leave the greater ar a and the ✓ majority of the wells on the audi side, indeed most ,f the wells are situated in the southern obtuse angle. The proposal is definitely unfavourable to Iraq, would complicate the watering problems of the Dhafir and, in my Opinion, should be rejected. It would however be desirable to define by agreement the method of administration of the neutral zone. 5* The advisability or otherwise of demarcating the boundary was co, sidered in 19&amp;7; at that time the verdict was that a demarcation would be unfavourable to Iraq for the following reas ns: a) The traditional southern boundary of the imarat, viz the watershed dividing the Wadis draining northwards (known as the vidyan) from the uadis draining to the wadi tfirhan lay considerably to the south of the line defined in the Uqair Trotocol (e.g. the source of the adi rar is in fact 100 miles southwest of Judaidat al nrsr, , and the watershed w s at that time being observed as a status quo line; b) The frontier from asr Uthaimi i to the terminal point at Jabal naz was described in the Irotocol as a straight line; but the description included mention of certain other poi .ts whicli a peered in Jthe map then used (war Office . .1917-18; to be situated on the straight line but, in the light of more recent infor mation, were known to be really situated all to the north of the straight line between the terminal points. The boundary line would therefore follow not a single straight line but a series of straight lines running well to the north of it, i.e. eve more unfavourable to Iraq.5* It appear b to me that these object one have today lost their force since: a.j The Saudi agents are now aware of the places named in the r &gt;tocol and are working u &gt; to them; there is thus no status quo as distinct from the legal boundary; and b) Objection (b) was always theoretical rather than practical, since both the tribes aud the agents f the two Grovernments know the pieces named by uheir situation o the ground, and not in terms of geographical co-ordinates. 6* un e the two Giov'rnmente are an ious to remove all oat standing causes of friction, I incline to think that there would be certain adva/itages in demarcating the boundary. Theoretically Giaudiya i.ay staiid to gain for the reasons given in para, 4; in pr ctice Iraq would perhaps gain more, since Saudi zak&amp;t collectors would thereby be restMned from crossing into Iraqi territory as in the past, whereas there is no temptation for Iraqi Goveromei-t agezits to violate the boundary, 7, If it is agreed to demarcate the boundary, then it will be necessary to settle in adv&amp;i ce one question of principle arising out of the defective drafting of the Uqair irotocol, the settlement of which would be beyond the competence of a Demarcation Uomoiseion. 8. The question is exemplified by the dispute regarding Judaidat Al x rar. This is one of the points mentioned as lyin^ on the line between asr lthaimin and Jabol naz. The Saudi Governxa nt claims that Judaidat Al Arar, a point on the line, belongs equally to both states. The Iraqi Government claims th&amp;t the ownership of wells mentioned in the irotocol as points on the line must be determined in the light of rticie 1 \b) of t e fWWBtf of Auharamara (quoted in para. 2 above;. (ly personal view is that the audi contention is correct, but the weight of *&amp;ministrative and legal opinion in Iraq.Iraq Is ag in t my view). It will therefore be necessary to refer this question (which covers all wells aid tanks named in the description) to arbit ation un&amp;er the Protocol on rbH ration of 7th April, 1931. 9. The importance of the dispute referred to in the preced ng paragraph v ould be minirflized if an agreement could be concluded whereby the flocks of one party should be exempt from taxation by the o her Party provided their stay in the territory of tne other Party did not exceed two months, it would however first be necessary to settle the dispute regarding the allegiance of contested tribes (see note 0 . 2 )./ A NO DISTRIBUTION.

WITH reference to my telegram No. '86 of the 4th April, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of the Treaty of Alliance between Iraq and Saudi Arabia which was signed at Bagdad on the 2nd April, together with a translation of the notes concerning article 1 which were exchanged at the time of the 11th March regarding article 5 (2), have been adopted. The text of the protocol on arbitration mentioned in article 2 has not yet been agreed upon. 2. After the signature of the treaty, congratulatory telegrams were exchanged between King Ghazi and King Abdul Aziz and Nuri Pasha and the Emir Feisal. The text was published simultaneously in Bagdad and Mecca on the 6th April and, according to the newspapers, was well received in both places. 3. The treaty was at once submitted to the Iraqi Parliament, and is likely to be passed through all its stages during the next few days. Ratifications are to be exchanged as soon as possible, either in Mecca or Bagdad. After ratifica tion, the Iraqi Government will register the treaty with the League of Nations. 4. During the treaty negotiations discussions took place between Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and the Iraqi Government concerning— (1) The demarcation of the frontier between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. (2) The division of the neutral zone. (3) Extradition. (4) Residence. (5) The Dahamshah tribe. (6) The reciprocal exemption of the subjects of each country from visas when 5. According to information given to Mr. Bateman by Nuri Pasha on the 6th April, the idea of demarcating the frontier on the ground has been dropped. It has been suggested to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that, as the questions that have arisen concern a number of watering places through which the Uqair line passes, some attempt should be made to decide which tribes are entitled to use individual wells in any given area. The centres in question are generally situated at the points where salients occur on the frontier. They are by no means well defined, and comprise a number of wells covering an area of 4 or 5 square miles. Access to these wells is of great importance to the Bedouin tribes, and the Iraqi Govern ment have suggested that they should be partitioned on the basis of established tribal rights. They are willing that King Abdul Aziz should, in the first place, decide to what tribe or tribes individual wells belong. The Iraqi Government are fairly confident that most of the wells will be found to belong to Iraqi tribes. 6. As regards point (2), Nuri Pasha has indicated in a letter to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that it is impossible to divide up the neutral zone, as many of the wells south of a line drawn across the centre belong traditionally to Iraqi tribes (principally the Dhafir). He suggested that, in order to maintain order in the zone, a mixed Iraqi-Saudi Administration should be set up to keep the peace. 7. As regards extradition, the Saudi Government had asked that better arrangements should be made for the working of the Extradition Aoreement of April 1931. Since this agreement came into force, the Iraqi Government have not addressed a single demand for extradition to the Saudi Government. The Saudi Government have made six. Of the nine persons involved in the Saudi demands, five have not been traced, one has been handed over, the surrender of „ of signature. You will observe that the recommendations made in your telegram No. 43 of the 24th February regarding article 4 {c), and in your telegram No. 54 entering the country of the other. [681 p—1] Bone has been refused for lack of evidence and of two on the ground that the persons concerned were Iraqis. Any alteration of the agreement seemed, therefore, to be of very little practical urgency. Nuri Pasha has, however, suggested to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that, as most of the cases for which extradition was demanded were of a tribal character, they should be dealt with, in accordance with the Tribal Civil and Criminal Disputes Regulations, by the Tribal Depart ment of the Ministry of the Interior. 8. Points (4) and (6) have been left for further discussion in a year s time, and point (5) has been allowed to drop. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosures to His Majesty s Minister at Jedda and to His Majesty’s consul-general at Beirut. I have, &amp;c. (For the Ambassador), C. H. BATEMAN.

Iraqi Government intended to omit this clause as it appeared to them inappropriate in proposed Treaty with Saudi Arabia especially as the latter do not seem to have signed the Paris pact. At my suggestion the question is now being reconsidered but I understand that Iraqi Government's legal advisers incline to the opinion that this clause could only in effect favour Saudi Arabia and that articles 5, 9 and first 5 categories of 4c provide sufficient means to enable Iraq to observe her other international obligations. Please telegraph whether you think it necessary for me to press Iraqi Government to include clause in question.

S Your telegram No 0 48 [of February 17th: Proposed Saudi- Z Irani Treaty of Friendship]. Saudi Arabia acceded to Kellogg Pact on Febmary 24th, 1952; and reasons given by Iraqi Government why fourth category of acts not constituting aggression, as given in Article 4 of draft Turco-Perso-Iraqi Non-Aggression Pact, should not be reproduced in Article 4 of Saudi-Iraqi Treaty do not hold. In any case without this category the defini tion of aggression in Article 4 becomes imperfect, since it stamps as aggression action which should not bear this character and which Iraq herself might conceivably be oound to take under her Treaty of Alliance with His Majesty's Government -&gt; Above views v/ere communicated to Nuri Pasha in response to an enquiry by him on February 21st, and he promised to telegraph to Yasin recommending that insertion be made. It would be advantageous, though not essential since Iraq and Saudi nrabia are both parties to the Pact, to complete new second sentence of Article 9 to read ‘’to observe the principles underlying the Covenant of the Leagiv of Nations and the Treaty for the Renunciation of &lt;&lt;ar signed at Paris on August 27th, 1928''. It is the more desirable because of possibility of accession of the Yemen which is not a party to the Pact. Repeated to Jed.da No. 27. X/ ' O if W/ £1*1 f ' l* .1 1 97 1936 :0 j)I STRI BUT ION.

Provided you are satisfied on above points you need raise no farther objection to conclusion of treaty. His Majesty's Government could hardly assist in actual drafting of treaty article without incurring undue responsibili ty.

Sir, I have had under consideration Your Excellency’s despatch No# 12 (17/2/36) of 7th January In which you transmitted to me the text of a proposed treaty of friendship between Iraq and Saudi Arabia handed to you by the Iraqi Minister fo3» Foreign Affairs# In view of the expected early arriva'L of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin in Bagdad, I have already telegraphed to you a provisional summary of my views on the general aspect of this draft treaty, and in particular my objections to Articles 6 and 7# 2c Apart from these Articles, my main preoccupation is with the manner in which the treaty will operate insofar as it concerns mutual assistance against aggression, and with the way in which its operation is likely to react upon the Anglo-Iraqi treaty of Alliance of 1930# By putting forward criticism from these points of view, I do not of course wish to give ground for the impression that His Majesty’s Government are attempting to keep Iraq and Saudi Arabia apart# Such an impression would be entirely erroneous# Conversal;ions which Mr# Rendel had with Fuad Bey Hamza on 19th Sep-.ember, 1934, (Eastern (Arabia) print, section 1 of that date) and with Nurl Pasha on 1st July, 1935, (see Sir John Simon’s despatch No. 449 of 4th July, 1936) will show that His Majesty’s Government would view with /sympathy His Excellency Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, K.C.H.G., 'itc«, etc# , etc#, Bagdad.m / imrmm &amp; sympathy a rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, provided always that any understanding in consonant with the existing obligations of the parties, notably those of Iraq as a Member of the League of Nations and the Ally of this country. 3. With these preliiainary observations, I will review the proposed treaty Article by Article. I agree with Your Kxcellency’s comments. In particular it seems desirable to omit the word ’’foreign” before'aggression' as being offensive and provocative. Article 1 . While I do not propose that you should raise specific objections to the* terras of this Article, it appears to me that the purport of it is far from clear. The Iraqi Government, as one of the High Contracting Parties, undertake not to enter into any engagement with a third state (this would include the United Kingdom) which is prejudicial to the interests of Saudi Arabia. What does this undertaking mean in practice? Does it mean that Saudi Arabia will for the future be in a position to veto any commitment into which Iraq proposes to enter? Dr, on the other hand, does it mean that Iraq is the judge as to whether any commitment into which she proposes to enter is prejudicial to the interests of Saudi Arabia, and that thia is, so to speak, a declaration of policy which, while not without meaning, is ultimately subject to the subjective appreciation of the party against whom it is Invoked? Article S does not appear to call for any'objection, but the elimination of the Permanent Court of International /JusticeJustice would npporu* to involve ecnoldernble departures, in drnftinr the onnexure, fron the draft treaty for the peaceful eettlcnent of cUcputec inltinlled by the Pex*sian and Iraqi reproecntntiveo on the fnd October, 1935. Article 4 contain© n definite obliention on the part of Irao to cone to the aid of Saudi Arnbio by force of arns if Saudi Arabin is a victin of the az*ned nrrreaoion of another otate. Pron the practical point )f vietr thin oerne in any case a very serious corrsitncnt for Iria to undox'tn?:e since it io in fact extrenely doubtful whether she io in a ponition to render effective military aid. But fron the theoretical point of view also the commitment ippcaro to be one of doubtful wisdom. The commitment is dependent upon an armed a^rression against Saudi .\rabia. The question ariseo therefore whether it would be wise to insert in the :reaty a definition of armed agression. His Majesty’s Government for their part have always doubted the possibility of arriving at a satisfactory definition and the Iraqi ‘tovemmont nay indeed prefer to retain by some form of r/o*ds full liberty of appreciation as to v/hat constitutes aggress! m. But ao Article 9 subordinates the obligations under thio tr3aty to those of Iraq under the Covenant, a definition on the general lines of Article 4 of the Treaty of Ilon-Aggression Initialled in October loot at Geneva by Iraqi, Persian and Turcioh representatives might not be inappropriate. 3uch texis ao that Article might naturally be invoked in any case to interpret aggression should the need arise, and it is therefor 3 perhaps not of great importance whether such a definition is inserted or not in the proposed Xran-caudi treaty except that the insertion of the definition might have the advantage of making clear to the Baud! Government the way in// i/ \A2&gt; in which the whole of Iraq's action is inevitably bound up in* and United by, the Covenant of the League of Nations, Under Article 4 of the draft Iraoi-Saudi treaty, Iraq might be called upon by Saudi Arabia to take action (a) against a Hember of the League o:? (b) against a non-Member of the League in both cases to support a state which is a non-Member. Even if it is assumed that arned aggression would only be interpreted as covering an attack which, if made upon a Member of the League by another Member of the League, would call Article 16 into play, the treaty is being made with a non-Member and might involve action against a Member. In order to render it possible therefore f03^ Iraq to fulfil her obligations under the Covenant and under the Article in question, it would apparently be necessary for Saudi Arabia, if and v/hen attacked, to accept an invitation, under Article 17 of the Covenant* from the Counoil of the League to assume the obligations of Membership in the League for the purposes of the dispute with all that that implies, namely the appreciation of the position by the Council of the League and recommendations by the League. Unless Saudi Arabia adopted this course, it is doubtful whether Iran could fulfil her obligations, at any rate in certain cases, consistently with the Covenant. It is true that Iraq’s obligations under the Covenant are safeguarded by Article 9 of the proposed treaty, but I doubt whether Iraq should agree to Article ^ of that treaty as at present drafted, unless Saudi Arabia understands that Iran can probably not take action under it until Saudi Arabia has submitted the dispute to the League under Article 17 of the Covenant. I would also draw attention to another point arising out of the wording )f Article 4. The effect of the Article seems/\o to ^ 0 x% K-r..' 5 i* hao attached* and thnt therefore the ob^icatit^no under the article cone into play* cIk&gt;u 1&lt;5 tmr bren-t out in opite of the efforto ^hioh Irnc riW laudl Arabia h^ve nade under the preccdinc ’.rtiolo# If thic vico ia rijrht t and the \rtiol© doeo thue in fnct alrcad/ contain by triplication its own definition of a££re&amp;elon, it la otill none o:»on to oblection f ainco the failure of the joint efforts of the two portico envloagcd in Article 3 lo not nooeooorily i pro;&gt;er test of amed acnreooioiu In o.iy cose, it aoeno deoimblc that Airticle 4 should contain a clause similar to /jrticlo 0 of the Peroo-Ira^i-YurldLah Treaty of non-^iCTpesoion no initialled on the , 'nd October last, bringing the Treaty to on end if one of the contracting portico undertakes an aggression against a third state. I hove so far considered Article 4 fron the point of view of Iron 1 s obligations; it renoins to consider its possible effect upon the position of Hio 2!njcaty f o Oovemnent. 'ihoxild Iran becone involved in war as the ally of 3audi Arabia under the proposed treaty. His Majesty’s Government would preounably, for their part, be called upon to support Iraq under Article 4 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930, provided that the ]&gt;eaceful means of settlement prescribed by the coverumt of the League nnd any other relevant international obligatiom! had been exhausted. Asouning however that Iraq went to tlie assistance of 3audi Arabia without exhausting these peaceful means of settlement, the x&gt;osition of His Unjesty’s Governnont as a nember of the League, ns the ally of Iraq, and with armed fOi*ces actually stationed in Irao, would be one of obvious difficulty, especially if the state against/agninat which Amhin and trr^ opemtln^ aao a ::cnber of the T/enir^« i*hio conolderotion nnkeo it all the noi'c inpor*tant from the point of view of Tfia 'Tnjeoty’o Oovemnent to enoare that the obli^ntiono of Irnr towardB rsmidi /jwibia under the proposed treaty shall not cotjc into force unless Gaudi /jabia has firet accepted the obligatione of irembership of the League for the purpose of the particular dilute in cueotion under Article 17 of the Covenant and all the requlrenents for peaceful settlement under the covenant have been complied with. Articles 6 and 7 require no comment additional to that which I have already exprecaed in ny telecran ITo. 17 of the 2?nd January. Article 8 calls Cor no comment except to point out that while there is no obligation in the matter ? Hio ?ia^esty*8 Government at present act for the Irani Government, in virtue of the special relations existing between the two countries, in foreign countries v/he?e there is no Iraqi representative. 4« You may nahe suih use as you think fit of the material in the present lespntch in discussing the proposed treaty with the Iraqi Hilieter for Poreign Affairs.

Nuri Pasha added that he hoped that sufficient general agreement would be reached in time to enable nim finally to conclude the treaty during his visit on his way to Mecca via Riadh. lie told me that he understood the special interest of nis Majesty’s Government in these negotiations and promised to keep me fully informed of all developments. 4.

(Copies hy Bag) Sir, 7/ith reference to my despatch No. 4 of January 2nd on the subject of the proposed Treaty of Friendship between Iraq, and Saudi-Arabia, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith the text of a draft treaty handed to me yesterday by Nuri Pasha. 2. Nuri Pasha explained that this draft would form the basis of his negotiations with Shaikh Yusif Yasin, who, he expected, would arrive in Bagdad in about ten day’s time. He accordingly asked me to give him, as soon as possible, any comments which I might think it desirable to make on the provisions of the treaty. 3. The draft bears signs of having been hurriedly and somewhat thoughtlessly prepared, but it clearly marks an important development of ideas. It is no colourless treaty of perpetual friendship but a defensive alliance with important significance. Nuri Pasha told me, moreover, that he expected that its provisions would be readily approved by Ibn Baud. 4. I have not yet had time to study the draft carefully, but the following criticisms and comments have already occurred to me: The Preamble . (a) Some phrase such as ’’have agreed to conclude a Treaty of Alliance” is evidently necessary after the words ’’the affairs of neighbouring countries” and before the sentence ’’For/ The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., etc.. etc*. etc.'For this purpose have appointed (b) The phrase 'and whereas it is necessary in the interests of the two States that they should form a united front against foreign aggression' is unnecessarily bellicose and suggests a threat of external aggression which does not at present exist. Article 2. in this Article would be drawn up on the lines of the Treaty for the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes initialled by the Persian and Iraqi representatives on October 2nd. 1935, but no mention would be made of the Permanent Court of International Justice. Article 4 . (a) This leaves unanswered the very difficult question of what constitutes an act of aggression. (b) The proper fulfilment of the obligations of Iraq towards Great Britain in the event of circumstances arising which might give an opportunity to either King Abdul Aziz (or, if he signed later, the Imam of the Yemen) to claim that an act of aggression had been committed against him by His Majesty’s Government (l am thinking of the undefined frontier between Transjordan and the difficulties wnich arise from time to time between Aden and the Yemen) is apparently safeguarded by Article 9. But if such a claim were ever made and this article were invoked, the Iraqi Government might find themselves in an embarrassing position. 'shall be held' in the fifth line in order to make the intention of the article clearer. Article 6. Nuri Pasna explained that the Annexure (1) mentioned (c) The word 'also' appears to be necessary after the words This article seems to be open to strong objection, as it implies inter alia concerted efforts to support the Arab nationalistnationalist movements in Syria and Palestine. Indeed, Nuri Pasha made no secret of his idea that the treaty should be used to prepare the way for giving active help to the Arabs in syria in their efforts to obtain concessions from the French. I have no doubt tnat it would seriously embarrass Iraq’s relations witn the French in Syria if it were included in the treaty in this form. Article 7 . -his article suggests active and quite gratuitous interference in the affairs of the Arab sheikhdoms of trie Persian Gulf, and I assume that His Majesty’s Government would strongly object to the joint intervention of the Iraqi and Saudi-Arabian Governments in, for example, a dispute between the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast. of Article 6, would strengthen the distrust which the treaty, if concluded, would provoke in France. As you know, the French Government have long refused to allow the Iraqi me rejdi Consul to act on behalf of Iraq and to be the instrument for giving effect to the provisions of Article 6. 5. At my next meeting with Nuri Pasha I shall make orally to him the observations which I have set out above regarding however, to reserve comment on the bearing of Article 4 on the obligations of the Iraqi Government under the Anglo—Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930 until I receive instructions from you. Government to establish Consulates at Damascus and Alenpo. Nuri’s plan is clearly to get over the difficulty by arranging for Article 8. The last sentence of this article, read in the light the Preamble and Articles 2, 6, 7 and 8 of his draft. I intend, special comment. The remaining articles do not appear to call for* | ^ 6. In the meanwhile, I shall of course warn him that I expect to he able to make fuller and more detailed criticisms when the n 7. draft has been examined by experts in London. As very little time now remains before Shaikh Yusuf Yasin is expected to arrive in Bagdad, I should be glad if you would instruct me as early as possible, 'by telegraph, what further action you desire me to take concerning this draft. 8.

Your despatch No. 12 (of January 7th: proposed Saudi- Iraqi treaty). 1. I agree generally with your cements. 2. Although His Aajesty’ s Crovermient do not v/ish to appear to be trying to keep the two countries aparu (see lor instance Eastern (Arabia) print of September 19th, iP5a-, Section 1, v/nich records general 'policy of His rajesiy’s G-overmient tov/ards Saudi- Iraoi rappi-ochement then in contemplation), presenu oraiu ^reauy amounts to close alliance imposing specific ooligacions on Iraq which will need careful investigation from the point of view of Iraq’s existing engagements and is in certain specific respecos especially articles 6 and 7 - open to most serious objection. 5. Article 6 in particular involves incerierence in axfaiio of other countries, is inappropriate in treacy of uhis kind and is thoroughly objectionable in principle. It is likely to arouse stron^ reactions from french in regard co cyiia, ..mion ^lay involve His majesty’s Government under their alliance v.luh Iraq, marther it directly concerns His majesty’s Government in vie\. r of interpre tation which will inevitably be put on it by Arabs oi i ales tine and Transjordan. If necessary His majesty s Government may have to. invoke final clause of Article 1 of nnglo-iraqi treaty of 1950 to secure deletion of this article. 4. Article 7 is even more objectionable, since it can only refer to Arab Sheikhdoms of the rersian Gulf whose foreign rela tions are controlled by His majesty’s Government. Saudi Arabia has&lt;■ * s&amp; fa 2 . has already recognised special relations of His Majesty's Govemraent towards these Sheildidons in Article G of Treaty of Jedda* and Saudi relations with them arc at present forming suDjecc 01 negotiations between His Aajesty* s Government and Saudi Government. Article therefore involves interference with interests and rights oi His ...tajesty's Government and is in con tradiction to Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance since it amounts, to a-ttac^ on position of His majesty's Government in Persian Gulf* 5. Article 4 is likely in its present form to involve Iraq in greau diniculties at Geneva in view of fact that Saudi Arabia is not a member of the League. There are few if any cases of Treaties of Alliance, as distinct from treaties of friendship or non-aggression, between League and non-League states. Further comments on this important aspect of the question will be sent to you by despatch. If essential advance summary could be telegraph ed. b. meanwhile you should bring above considerations to notice of Iraqi Government in whatever way you consider most appropriate, and, while not suggesting that His majesty's Government are in any way opposed to strengthening of friendly relations between Irac and Saudi Arabia, establishment of which they have done so much in the past to encourage and facilitate, you should make it clear that they would take strongest exception to inclusion in the Treaty of any provisions on the lines of Articles 6 and 7, and consider that, the Iraqi Government would be well advised before agreeing to its remaining provisions to await the views which His majesty's Gov ernment will formulate as soon as possible as to its possible implication.

Sir -o Loraine’s telegram No. 125 of November 1st regarding the proposed pact of non-aggression between Persia, Turkey and Iraq, and Mrc mallett f s telegram No. 554, 2. Nuri Pasha told me yesterday that the Persian Charge d’Affaires in Bagdad had recently come to see him and had informed him that Kazemi would soon he going to Kabul to endeavour to secure the adhesion of Afghanistan to the pact of non-aggression. He had been instructed to enquire whether the Iraqi Government would agree formally to associate them selves with the represents tions which Kazemi would make to the Afghan Government in this sense. 5, huri Pasha said that he had firmly rejected the proposal 0 Persia, he explained to me, appeared for her own i^dcons most anxious co secure tne accession of Afghanistan to tne pact, but it made no difference to Iraq whether Afghanistan signed- tne part or not, Pne two countries were too far separated ior an act of aggression by one against the other to he in the least likely to occur. If Persia wanted to persuade Afghanistan to oe a signatory, she must find her own arguments; he saw no reason v/hy Iraq should make a special appeal for this purpose. 4. Nuri Pasha’s account of this talk has since been confirmed independently by the Persian Charg'd d f Affaires. 5, As regards the hopes of Turkish Minister for Foreign Ax 1 d^rs iaiat the pacu would soon be signed, Nuri Pasha said that2 . that the Iraqi Government, for their part, had no intention of signing until the frontier question was settled with 1'ersia. 6. I questioned him about the accession of baudi Arabia. He said that he did not think that King Abdul Aziz would regard the pact with much favour, as, for a variety of reasons, he was opposed to international commitments and saw no practical advantage in the pact. 7. Nuri Pasha mentioned in conclusion that he would probably perform the Haj, if possible by air, early in the Hew Year and hoped to use this opnoitunity to conclude a new treaty of friendship with Saudi ilrabia. He might also renew discussions regarding the pact of non-aggression.

Yasin Peaha said that there was such a wide difference between the draft whioh had been prepared by Ali Jaudat*s GoveTOaent and the counter dra t whioh had recently been received from Jedda that the Iraqi * overnment were not yet in a position to agree to this proposal and he had instructed hurl Pasha accordingly. 3. He further informed me that the appropriate departments were now carefully studying the latest Saudi draft and were preparing an analysis of the clauses which contained provisions not covered by the old treaties. He wished to discuss these with me when he had had an opnortunity to examine them himself. 4* I am sending a copy of this despatch to His &amp;a esty’s Char*® d’Affaires at -Tedda.

In the course of conversation with me this morning Hurl Pasha told me that the Saudi Government had for some time been pressing the Iraqi Government to conclude a new treaty to supplement, if not to replace, the treaties negotiated by Nuri Pasha in Mecca in 1931• 8* The 8audi Government had originally proposed a treaty of alliance. Nuri Pasha had replied that the Iraqi Govern ment were not prepared to go quite as far as thie, but that they vould conclude a treaty providing for consultation as to the common measures to be taken in the case of war or threat of war, provided it was clear that Iraq would not be ca led upon in any circumstances to take any measures against any Arab State or any action incompatible with the Anglo- Iraqi treaty of Alliance of 1 30. 3. The Saudis had eventually produced a draft treaty w lich Nuri had not liked, as it was extremely vague and at the same time appeared to go too far. I understood Nuri to say that he had then referred the matter to a committee of the Oaoinet in Bagdad and that three alternative draft treaties had been prepared for communication to the audi Government. Nuri Pasha had one of these treaties with him and seemed di posed to communicate the Arabic text of it to me (though he had not ; ot it with him), provided we could have it translated eon- fi entially. I told him that we should be very glad to see the text if he liked to communicate it to ua, and that we could make suitable arrangements about having it translated, but when Nuri asha heard thr.t we had no Arabic scholars in the Foreign Office itself, he took the line that it might be better for him, on his return to Iraq, to communicate the Arabic • • eArabic text to H. ’• Embassy in Bagdad, who would hare expert translators available* I did not press him on this point* 4* Nuri Pasha explained that what was now in contemplation was a treaty of* friendship — not of alliance — providing for &lt; on ultation in certain emergencie s and subject to the provisos he had mentioned, i*e* no obligation to take measures against any Arab State or to take aiiy action incompatible with the terras of the nglo-lraqi treaty. This short treaty, whic ; would really not amount to very Much, would be supple ented later by commercial, extr dition and possibly other arrange- ments* 5* I told Nuri Pasha that we should welcome any develop ment which ‘would further the cause of peace and stability amon-r the Arab States. Both Irag nd Saudi Arabia were good friends of ours and we should like to see the i good friends with each other. Of course it would be necessary, as Xhiri pasha himself had said, that any arrange ie^ts made between Iraq and Saudi Arabia should be such as not to conflict with the terms of the Anglo-Xraqi Treaty of Alliance. There need presumably be no difficulty about this point, the importance of which liuri himself had emphasised. lut it was equally essential that any arrangements contemplated should not con flict with Iraq’s obligations under the Covenant of the League of Nations and under the Kellogg Pact. I presumed that liuri Posha had considered this oint. 6. Nuri Pasha replied that he had not only considered this but that he proposed to urge the Saudi Government to ap ly for Membership of the neague of Nations for Saudi rabia. 7. I replied that His Majesty’s Government natui»ally welcomed anything which would strengthen the league or extend its ... . a .H / its membership. But had Hurl ,/asha considered the question whether Saudi Arabia would in fact be able to fulfil the necessary conditions of membership and a-sume the obliga tions of a Member of the League? * bat* for instance» wouid be &gt;the poaition in regard to slavery,which was a legal institution in Saudi Arabia? Kuri aaha said tliat this had not been an obstacle in the case of Abyssinia* and asked whether there need be any more difficulty in the present case than there had been on that occasion? He thought that the admission of Afghanistan to Membership of the League might also constitute a useful parallel. I said that both these ease3 were rather outside my sphere and that though I had read a good deal about them I did not feel competent to discuss them. I underu toovi* however* that Abyssinia* e me bershlp of the League had not been entirely free from complications. 8. I had not expected Hurl Pasha to raise this question of the possible admission of Saudi Arabia to the League of nations, and had not dterefore been able to refresh my memory on the subject. I did not wish to a &gt; ear too dis couraging, but in view of the various difficulties involved, it seemed preferable not to go too far in the other direction. I was therefore :urposely noncommittal. 9. I asked Hurl Pashs whether he had had any political discussions with Fuad Boy and he replied that he had only had one short conversation with himvhich had not been of great importance. It was possible however - though not yet certain - th t the Amir Baud and Fuad Bey would pass through Iraq on their return to Arabia after their European tour, in which case he vould continue the discussions then.

Just before he left England for Iraq* yesterday Nuri Pasha telephoned, T»vith reference to his conversa tion with me on this subject on July 1, to say that he had found that the , rabic text of the draft Saudi-Iraqi Treaty which he had mentioned and which he had been about to send, contained certain errors. He was therefore taking the text back with him to Bagdad, where it would be corrected, and he would arrange to send me a copy of it later (presumably through His Majesty’s Embassy, though he did not say this specifically).

Yaain Pasha ave me a day or two ago. Heexnlained that, although he had instructed Hurl Pasha not to continue, in London, the negotiations which had hem begun in Jedda, Hurl Pasha had been unable to avoid discussions with Sheikh Hafiz v ahba and Fuad Bey Hamza; and had accepted, for transmission to his government, a third draft of the proposed treaty. Yesin asha added that Jhe cabinet wo Id not examine this drait until after ffuri peaha’s return, ae it would be necessary for then to hiar his report on hie conversation in London with the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs. 3. ^he draft contains few novelties and is more remark able for the provision rasde in several of Its articles for mutual cooperation in the cause of the peace and progress in the Arab world, than for any noteworthy obligations assumed by either contractin p rty towards the othe^# 4. Article 2 ma ? ea the usual provision for the estab- lishment of diplomatic and consular' representation between the two countries according to accepted international pro cedure. Mo direct reference is made, either in this article or/ The Right Honourable Sir Samuel J.G. Hoar©, Bt etc., 1 . , , G.B.E. f etc. , etc.or elsewhere? in the treaty, to the special position enjoyed in Iraq by His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador under the Treaty of Alliance between Great Britain and Iraq of ^930, but article 9 would appear to afford a sufficient safe uard in this respect. 5. I assume that if Articles 2 and 9 are retained in their present tom in the final text, it will be unnecessary for the Iraqi ( overmaent, at the time of signature, to exchan e notes with the Government of Qaudi Arabia similar to those which were appended ~o the ^raq-Af Jianiatan Treaty of Friendship concluded in December, 19f2 (see Sir Francis Humphrys’a despatch T o.9 of January 5th, 1935 • 6. You will observe from the wording of Article 10 that the treaty ia not likely to come into force pending agree j ment in the texts of the numerous annexures to be at ached to it.

Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received April 29.) (No. 112.) • Sir, Jedda, April 11, 1935. WITH reference to my despatch No. 32 of the 4th February, I have the honour to state that the relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq still seem to be evolving in the direction of some form of closer understanding, although the evolution has not quite followed the lines foreshadowed some time ago, when Fuad Bey Hamza spoke of the possibility of a visit being paid by Nuri Pasha As Said to Ibn Sand. This is probably due, partly at least, to the two Cabinet crises which occurred in Bagdad last month, and to Nuri Pasha’s preoccupations at home. The Saudi Government have followed the political situation there with great interest, all the greater possibly because the slight cloud cast on their relations with the Yemen by the attempt on Ibn Sand’s life might enhance the value of a definite rapprochement with Iraq. 2. My Iraqi colleague has spoken to me more than once of prospective negotiations on such matters as passports, trans-frontier trade and the like. I gathered that these negotiations had been contemplated for some time, and that the Saudi Government had prepared a draft agreement. Shortly after the advent to power of Yassin Pasha A1 Hashimi in Iraq, Sayyid Kamil told me that one of the first acts of the new Government there was to instruct him to get on with the preliminaries. I now understand that the Saudi Government at last com municated their draft to him about a week ago. He left for Bagdad on the 7th April, perhaps to submit the draft to his Government, perhaps merely using that as a pretext for getting away from Jedda. He told me a day or two before his departure that he hoped to get a transfer and never to return here. 3. Fuad Bey Hamza also spoke to me the other day about the draft agree ment. He seems now to think that he will himself go to Bagdad sooner or later to negotiate, but he is awaiting the Iraqi reaction to the draft before making his plans. My Iraqi colleague also spoke of the probability of a visit by Fuad Bey to Bagdad. 4. Both sides seem to attach more importance to the proposed negotiations than might be inferred from what I have been told about the specific subjects to be discussed. It is possible that these are merely the screen for something of greater political importance. Fuad Bey gave a hint of this when telling me that there was some idea of consolidating the agreements governing the relations of the two countries in a comprehensive instrument. This plan, he said, had been favoured by the late Sir Gilbert Clayton, who might have furthered it but for his premature death. luad Bey added to the list of questions requiring attention one of which my Iraqi colleague had not spoken, namely, the renewal or revision of the existing Extradition Treaty of the 8th April, 1931. which came into force on the 10th May, 1932, and which was concluded in the first instance for three years only. 5. Meanv/hile, the relations between the two countries continue to be cordial. I have mentioned in another despatch Ibn Sand’s friendly reference to Iraq in an interview he gave to journalists after the attempt on his life. I have now before me the translation of a longer utterance, namely, the speech which His Majesty addressed just before the pilgrimage to the Iraqi “ boy ” scouts, who came here by the new overland route. Having applauded their movement, so beneficial to the progress of Arabs, he went on to stress the community of interest between this country and Iraq. He described the latter as a bulwark, which would prevent hostile penetration of Saudi Arabia. He vowed three things. He would uphold among Moslems the principle that the Holy Book should prevail over everything. He, his sons and his soldiers would fight for the Arabs and their victory. So long as he lived, he would maintain friendship with Iraq. 6. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. EASTERN (Arabia).

WITH reference to my telegram No. 187 of the 13th August, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed me that during his recent visit to London he was approached by the Saudi Arabian Minister, who, on instructions from Ibn Saud, proposed the conclusion of a Treaty of Alliance between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. He also made suggestions for the conclusion of a commercial agreement and of a convention according to Saudi subjects Iraqi consular protection. 2. Nuri Pasha states that the Saudi Minister in London, accompanied by the Saudi Secretary-General for Foreign Affairs, intends to visit Bagdad about the end of October on the way to Hail, when this matter will be further discussed. His Excellency desired that His Majesty’s Government should be informed of what was in contemplation, and assured me that not only would you in due course be consulted, but also he would make it clear to the Saudi representatives that Iraq would not be a party to any alliance contrary to the treaty with Great Britain, or detrimental to the interests of other Arab States. 3.

The occasion wus marked in the press by the publication of His kajesty 1 s photograph and of laudatory leading articles praising his achievements. The Nation alist newspapers, such as H A1 Istiqlai'’ and M Al tfq&gt;ab% rejoiced in him as the ruler of the one Arab country free from foreign domination, and heralded him as the keystone of the arch of the longed-for rab liberation and unity. The Oovonment organ, 'Al Tariq', struck a soberer and leas tendencious note and was satisfied merely to indulge in neighbourly rejoicings with the people of ^a'udi *rabia on this happy occasion and to exhort the &lt;&gt;ovam^ente of both countries to do their utmost to develop the common Interests of the two kindred nations.

King Faisal has now sent a personal letter by a special messenger to King Abdul Aziz asking him, in the name of the friendly relations established between them at the Lupin meeting in 1930, to consent to receive^he •Iraqi Mission at Mecca.B 12fc&gt; /L.

Reference your letter No.1082 dated 6tn February 1932, regarding the Treaty of Friendsnip ana Bon Voisina&amp;e and the extradition Treaty between ’Iraq ana Hijaz ana Najd. The ’Iraqi (iogerniaent have authorised Doctor Naji Beg Al Asil, their Ghar 0 e d*Affaires and Consul- General in Mecca, to exchange certificates of ratification of tnese two treaties upon arrival at the place of his appointment. (S to d) Hanna Khayatt for Minister for Foreign Affairs.151. About the middle of February news was received in Baghdad that a Najdi force o f 25 camelmen and 2 armed cars had been established at Jadaidat al Arar. Shortly after their arrival they moved across the frontier into ’Iraqi territory and demanded taxes from some of the followers of Shaikh Mahrut ibn Hadhdhal, Shaikh of the Amarat. Two armed cars of the Desert Police force were sent to investigate the matter on the spot whereupon the Najdis withdrew southwards across the border. Early in April, however, the Eajdi Commander of this force again came a few miles north of the frontier into ’Iraq and demanded tribute from some of the Amarat on the grounds that they were grazing in Najdi territory. 152. The ’Iraqi Commandant of the Southern Desert Police has been ordered to proceed with an adequate force to the Amarat camps in the area to the north of Jadaidat al Arar (the Y/adian area) and to protect ’Iraqi interest. 153. Article 1(b) of the Treaty of ITohammarah lays down the principle that in settling the frontier the lands and wells of the Shanmar of Fajd should be included in ITajd and those of the Muntafiq Dhafir and Amarat should be included in ’Iraq. Jadaidat al Arar as an Amarat well and it can therefore be argued that it belongs to ’Iraq. Article 1(d) of the Protocol of bqair by which the frontier was subsequently defined however specifically mentions Jadaidat al Arar as a point of the boundary. The position is complicated by the fact that the maps used by the negotiators of the bqair Protocol were inaccurate with the result that the frontier as defined therein actually places part of the Amarat grazing grounds in ITajd territory - a fact to which it would be unwise for the ’Iraqi Government to draw attention. For these reasons the ’Iraqi Government, in sending instructions to their Minister in the Nijaz, have though it best not to claim that Jadaidat al Arar is in ’Iraqi territory, but to press for the withdrawal of the ITaj'ITaj di force on the ground that its presence at a well in the vicinity of the frontier is a contravention of Article 3 of the Protocol of Uqair./(UKyCj Extract from/Intelligence Report No. 1 dated the 14.

Previous Papers :— We have now received the texts of the agreements, of which a brief summary was sent by telegram on April 9th (P.Z.2178). Nuri Pasha’s visit to the Hejaz seems to have been . an unqualified success and ’’augurs well for the Iraq^i Government’s ability to control their relations with neighbouring states”, l) The Bon Voisinage Treaty is an amplification of the draft initialled at the Lupin Conference (P.1932/30) and differs only in minor points. The treaty provides for the exchange of diplomatic and consular representatives. The inclusion in the Preamble of a reference to the cause of Arab unity may be taken merely as a gesture on the part of Nuri Pasha and perhaps connected with his despatch of a representative —representative to the Yemen. 2) The Arbitration Protocol provides for a board of not more than 6, nominated equally by each of the High Contracting Parties under the presidency of a person mutually agreed upon. 3) An Extradition Treaty has at last been concluded. Political offenders are not to be surrendered, but normal bedouin raiding offences and attempts against Their Majesties or their families are not to be classed as political. 4) The question of frontier posts seems to remain as settled at the Lupin Conference: probably resort to arbitration will be necessary (cf.P. 1452/30). 5) Ibn Mashur. Ibn Saud is content with the surrender of Ibn Mashur 1 s family and property and Feisal’s promise to surrender him if ever he is found in Iraq territory. 6) The balance of £23,000, owed to Iraq in respect of compensation for the Iraq tribes, Ibn Saud admits in full, but Nuri Pasha has allowed 2 months’ grace in view of the former’s shortage of ready cash. 7) Ho information about customs and passports questions is available till Nuri Pasha issues his report, but Sir F.Humphreys understands that they were discussed with satisfactory results.QV8nx&gt;,mAi* FILE COPV ^ V The Eeeidexie^f l?id t 8 th Makjr § i931 • tij lord, I hare the honour to trnnnmit oopiee in tranala- tion of tho docmmoate noted in the oaoloeed schedule comprising correapondence between King Ibn Sn’ud and myeelf, between the Minister for Foreign Affaire of the Ulj&amp;s - Hajd Gorernment and Kuri i asha and between King Xbn Sa’ud and Muri arid also the texts of the Bon Yoiein&amp;ge Treaty, Arbitration irotoool and ^tradition Treaty signed at Meeea on the ?th and 8th of April, 1931• 8.

Ee uleo informed me of hi* intention to send f ifcha al Haehimit the Chief of the aeaeml Staff, on a mission to the Imam of Yaman, and undertook on my sugges tion to aegualnt king Ibn Sa’ud with his intention first and to ensure that Bis ki&amp;jeety had no objection. Finally, in Tiew of Sir John huoicburgh f a demi- official letter Ho. 78139/30 dated the lath of Horember, 1930, I asked Huri lasha to ascertain whether King Ibn Sa'ud still harboured any resentment in regard to the appointment of i&gt;r. Abdullah Damluji as , Ira&lt;ii &gt; inister for Foreign Affiairs. 4. As regards the instruments signed by Huri Pasha at Keooa, Your Lordship will obserre that the texts of the Bon Vbiain&amp;ge freaty and Arbitration Protocol correspond closely to the texts initialled In Baghdad a year ago. Such araettdj&amp;ents as hare been made conform generally to adTice tendered by this High Commission. ^he exceptions are the incorporation in the 1 reamble of a somewhat obscure paragraph referring to ’the desire of Their Majesties to exert every possible effort to compose the affairs of the i rab nation and unite her word* 1 and the Insertion in Article 13 of the words 'or nationals of the two contracting parties’*. The former amendment, which eee&amp;s Innocuous, may be attributable to a desire on the part of Muri Pasha to justify the declaration made before 1 his departure of his intention to remote the cause of Arab unity. The a.uoad aiBcn.hi.uut, wnioii oxteudu to ' ’Iraq and Sajd aationale the r.«triotioae wbioh la tha original draft w.r* npplioabl. only to foreigner., app.ar.for oeiuplote freedom of moytm&amp;t of trltoon for grafting purpose.

The Extradition Treaty provide* in irtiole 3 that the surrender of political oflenders ahall not be permissible. At the &amp;mj&amp; time, as Tour lordship will observe from the notes exchange! between Nuri i as ha '.ad the Uinlstor for Foreign ffaira of the Hi4aft - Bajd Gov© rams at, the former has given an assurance that offences normally oommltted by bedouin tribesmen fall within the category of extraditable offences and cannot be described as political. X aeo no objection to the nature of the assurance given by Hurl iasha, and I consider that he le to be congratulated on having settled this vexed question which has disturbed relatione between 9 Iraq and £&amp;Jd for many years. §• As regards the Xbn liashhur affair, IJuri lasha inform© me that ling Xbn fa’ud Is now quite satisfied, and that with the surrender of his family and property the affair will be considered closed. This is confirmed by His Majesty 9 e letter to myself. 7. In regard to the balance of £23,000 outstanding in respect of the compensation to be paid by the Mijaa - Hajd Government for the 'Iraq tribes, Huri lasha informed me that ling Ibn 3a 9 ud did not attempt to deny the obligation to pay the mount In full. His Majesty explained, however, that owing to a temporary l»©fc of ready money it would be necessary for him to borrow the money if he was to pay it to Hurl iasha before the latter 9 © departure. thirl las ha replied that in the circumstances he would not press for immediate paymentoM that the balance due might he remitted to Baghdad In the o curse of the next two months. 8, I understand that the matter of customs and passport procedure was discussed with satisfactory results of which further information will # no doubt, be furnished in the official report. Kuri iaaha informed me also that / King I bn $a Y ud welcomed the proposed mission to the Yauaan and that, in regard to ^r. bdullmh Damlujl, His Majesty was quite roconelied to the appointment of his former minister to the ’Iraq foreign Office, and did not desire to raise any objection on that score. 9. So far as 1 am able to judge at present, Hurl lasha’s visit to the Hlj&amp;s seems to have been an unqualified success, and augurs well for the 'Iraqi Govern* ment’s ability to control their relations with neighbouring States. I lout no time on the return of Hurl *a®ha to Baghdad in conveying to him the message of congratulation from His Majesty’s Government contained in Your lordship’s telegram Ho. 148 dated the 19th of April, 1931, a message which, as I have already reported to Your lordship, he greatly appreciated. 10.

Thau they found It inevitable to include in the draft a provision for the exception of political offenders secondary ones! firstly ! Th&amp; Institutions of the Kingdom of ’Iraq arc those of a Constitutional State, under which the people of ’Iraq exercise complete control over all state affairs through Parliament which consists of two legislative chambers to whom are submitted all treaties and agreements, which they either ratify or reject. It is thus beyond the power of any ’Iraqi Government to take any action which they believe to be Inconsistent with the wishes of the majority in the aforesaid two chambers. 1 have the honour toacknowledge the receipt of Tour from extradition, for two essential reasons, besides other X cannot help seising this opportunity to thank Tour I beg leave to set forth as follows my reply in then considering the draft extradition agreementX do aox think X would bo wrong In bollrrlng that (my figretmnt which dooa not the exception of political off©adort from extradition aan hare any hope of being ratified by the f Iraqi iarliemnt* eoundlyi The prinoiple of excepting political offenders from extradition ie one recognloed by all civil lead stateo* The refusal of any state to (surrender any political offender claimed by hie state does not normally hare any adverse effect on the relatione of friendship existing between the two statee eonoemed* 2 think Tour Majeuty will agree with me that it would be harmful to the reputation of the two sister Kingdoms If they were to conclude an extradition agreement of a nature inconsistent with general principles recognised as between civilised states. I have entered into negotiations with Tour Majesty’s Private secretary and Under aeoretary of State for Foreign ffairs # Shaikh Yusuf Y&amp;eia, with the above two matters unavoidably, in view. cwing* however, to Tour Majesty*&amp; strong desire, stated to me by shaikh Yusuf, for the amendment of the text of .%rtiole 3 of the draft greement, and also to the general recommendation given to me by the Government of His Majesty my King that 1 should 'afford all the facilities' (or make all the eonoessicna} of which circumstances and public Interest permit with a view to settling the forming the object of my deputation, X have expressed my willingness to agree to the amendment of the article in question by the addition thereto of a clause providing that any armed 'rising' (V attempt) against the person of Tour majesty or the person of any member of Tour Majesty's family shall not beV* 1*0 b« r«g»rd«d a polltloal offaaoe* fMa ot ooura© require©» on th« priaoipl© ©f reciprocity, that any armed rising again©! the person of Hie Majesty my &amp;ing or the person of any member of hie family should not be regarded a polltloal offence* Ho auoh thing, howerer, was suggested by my government. I have agreed to eeoept the above amendment, on my own responsibility, in the belief that it will have the full approval of Your Majesty and that it will prove instrumental in reconciling the view points of the two governments* Your Majesty will no doubt reallee that by acting as X have done, I ml talcing a large step towards 'rapproachment' (? agreement), and that the amendment which 1 have expressed myself willing to accept differs considerably from the original proposal put forward by my government* 1, therefore, o&amp;auot help expressing my astonishment at the statement made in Your Majesty's letter that the attitude of my government has not changed* I have carefully examined the three (alternative) proposals contained in Your Majesty's letter, and I find that there is no difference between the first and the third in principle, although they do differ in form. It appears that the principal purpose of these proposals is to prevent raiding* In this connection, I am glad to {be able to) assure Your Majesty that my government is not less anxious than Your Majesty's Government for the prevention of raiding. In the eyes of my Government, raiding is an ordinary offence punishable under the ^law for the Prevention of Raiding and Plunder Ho*47 of 19S7*, of which I beg leave to enclose herewith a coxy for the information of Your Majesty. .It i» a wall known uniis;'tftable prlnolplo that an offender, whatswor his nationalitir t is punishable for his offence in the country in which it was coomitted when apprehended by that country* Proposal a of Your Majesty 1 * proposals Is taken from a certain article in the draft treaty intended for conclusion between ’Iraq and gypt* It is not hid that this (¥ latter) draft is based on principles which require that it should be left to the judicial authorities as a matter of right to decide whether an offender la to be extradited or not, according as the said authorities may be satisfied after examina tion of the offence, the evidence of witnesses and other matters, which are difficult to investigate in Your Majesty’s kingdom having regard to Its existing institu tions* Yhe article in question Is a component part of a whole comprevising several articles which cannot be taken in part, but only as a whole* iersonally, I believe that the acceptance of such principles will not ensure the expedition sought In the settlement of cases arising between our two kingdoms, nor will it ensure our aim not to allow increased cause for complaint and Mrmtrlag* Nevertheless, should Your Majesty ultimately prefer to depend on such principles, X would In that case be bounu to commit my Government in the matter on my return to Baghdad* Yhis, as is obvious, ill require the very bases of the question to be reconsidered. I, however, hope that my foregoing representations may afford means for the satisfaction of Your Majesty’s wishes in this behalf* 2* question of frontier »oot&amp;* This question, as is not hid, was settled between Your Majesty and His Majesty your brother king Faisal, and I have no Instructions concerning it.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 81 of the 9th instant, I have the honour to submit a fuller account of the proceedings during the visit of the Prime Minister for Iraq to this country. Although it may be some little time before I can send this despatch, I think it will conduce to clarity if I embody in it all that I know of what passed while Nuri Pasha was actually here and reserve for a further report anything that I may hear from the other side in due course. 2. Nuri Pasha arrived in Jedda by Khedivial steamer from Suez on the morning of Easter Sunday, the 5th April, accompanied by three other delegates, namely, Taha Pasha El Hasbimi, Muwaffaq Bey El Alousi and x\hmed Bey Manafisi. Considering it appropriate in the circumstances to show special courtesy, although the mission were the guests of the Hejazi Government, I sent Mr. Wikeley to present compliments to Nuri Pasha on board and myself met him on the quay. 3. From what the Pasha told Mr. Wikeley, it appeared that he expected to find Ibn Saud in Jedda. As a matter of fact, not only the King but our nominal Minister for Foreign Affairs sat tight in Mecca. Minor officials greeted Nuri Pasha on board, and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, with the Governor of Jedda and others, received him on the quay. A respectable guard was turned out and there were plenty of cars, but the reception otherwise was, perhaps, hardly adequate to the principal visitor’s rank, according to oriental ideas. 4 I had understood that Nuri Pasha would be accommodated at the villa outside Jedda usually assigned to official European visitors of high rank, and had supposed that the main negotiations would take place in Jedda. It was, in fact, the intention that the mission should be put up at Kandara, at any rate for the first night, and that Yusuf Yasin should give a dinner, to which I was to be bidden. This plan was upset, apparently by Nuri Pasha himself, and the mission went on to Mecca in the afternoon. I at first supposed that this might be due to an objection on the Pasha’s part to being put off with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, but I cannot affirm this now. The Pasha had expected to arrive on the 4th April and to leave on the 11th. The Khedivial time table did not allow of his getting here before the 5th and necessitated his leaving on the 8th or 9th. Expedition was therefore essential, and it was certainly a more practical plan, as Ibn Saud elected to remain in Mecca, to mobilise everybody concerned there as soon as possible. 5. The same need for haste probably accounted for the fact that the Pasha did not call on me after his arrival, although he sent a card. Nothing in our subsequent intercourse could justify me in supposing that he wished to ignore me or come the Premier over a British representative of inferior rank. When I met him he hailed me as an old friend, for he had come to see me in 1913 or 1914 when he was a young officer in Constantinople for some political purpose. I gathered afterwards that it had to do with the events which led to the arrest by the Turkish Government of the well-known El Masri and the intervention of the British Embassy to prevent his being put to death. 6. So the mission and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin hurried off to Mecca on the afternoon of the 5th April. I heard nothing further until the 7th, when the telephone wires buzzed with enquiries about steamers to take Taha Pasha and Muwaffaq Bey to Hodeidah and Nuri Pasha himself to Suez. I received the same day a reply to a suggestion I had broached just after the mission arrived that they should dine at the Legation any night that would fit in with the official programme. I had not pursued this further after the mission’s departure for Mecca, but I received a spontaneous intimation on the 7th that they and Yusuf Yasin would dine with us next evening, but that the Emir Feisal could not leave Mecca. There was still no news of the progress of the negotiations. [88 ff— 3 ]2 7. On the afternoon of the 9th Sheikh Yusuf Yasin telephoned to ask whether we should mind if he and Yuri Pasha were late for dinner. e a e( &gt; on Xuri Pasha’s behalf and his own, that things were going well and mat everything was nearly settled. I replied that, if they brought news of a complete agreement on all important matters, it would be a happy evening for me as we as for them. This little bit of encouragement was my only intervention m tne ( actual negotiations. Later, I heard that all the important questions had been settled, not without difficulty, and when the Pasha and the Sheikh arrived late at the Legation they were extremely pleased both with themselves ana with each other. The utmost'good feeling prevailed at our party, which was attended by Nuri Pasha, Ahmed Bey, Sheikh Yusuf, with other local notables, selected members of the British community and the representatives of countries boi dering on Iraq. .... • i -i , 8. I have related these individually trivial incidents m detail, as they show the setting of the first meeting of capital importance in which Iraq and Hejaz- Nejd have met, conscious of the presence of His Majesty’s Government in the background, but not looking to them for guidance. The event has proved me wrong in my forecast that they would be unable to agree without British mediation. It almost looks as though both sides wished to show how well Arabs could get on if left to themselves; but it is only fair to add that, when I warmly congratulated Nuri Pasha and Sheikh Yusuf Lasin on the outcome, they acknowledged handsomely how much they owed to Great Britain and her representatives. 9. As regards the actual negotiations, I can add little material to what 1 have telegraphed. Sheikh Yusuf said that he hoped to see me in two or three days after a necessary return to Mecca. Meanwhile I have only the information which Nuri Pasha gave me on the evening of the 8th April. He expressed spontaneously a wish to tell me something about what had passed. We talked privately for over an hour after dinner, but I confined myself to asking only such questions as arose out of his explanations and put only one important question of my own, namely, whether he had disposed of the Ibn Mashhur afiair. He replied to this question affirmatively but without going into detail. 10. Nuri Pasha did not dwell on the question of the desert posts, but it appeared from his rather vague statement that it had once more been agreed to have recourse to arbitration after a further attempt to settle the matter amicably. He had had difficulty in getting the “ Bon-Voisinage” Agreement actually signed. The Hejazis raised all sorts of points of detail, and it was evident from what the Pasha told me that they were still reluctant to commit themselves finally to “ Bon-Voisinage ” without being sure of an extradition treaty. On the 6th and 7th April he found Yusuf Yasin sticky, and the 8th April was a difficult day. Nuri Pasha went off to the King at least twice, and eventually the “ Bon-Voisinage ” Agreement was signed, while the question of extradition was still under discussion. I did not gather what form had been finally given to the clause on political offenders in the text of the Extradition Agreement. Nuri Pasha spoke more of the play which he had made with the Iraqi law on raiding and of the letter in agreed terms which it was finally settled that he should write on that subject. He gave me no details of the subsidiary questions which the King had wished to discuss, such as wells near the frontier, the collection of taxes in the neutral zone and Wakfs, but said that the King had accepted his view that these matters could be settled best in later correspondence. He left Mecca without having actually signed the Extradition Agreement, but the text signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 8th April was brought to Jedda at midnight and Nuri Pasha signed it here on the morning of the 9th April. It is interesting to note that the Prince-Minister apparently played no role except as a signatory of texts. 11. Nuri Pasha seemed to fie confident of putting both the agreements through the Iraq Parliament before the end of the present session. 12. I was struck by the Pasha’s eagerness to get the question of Sultan A1 Atrash and his followers settled on the basis of their being received in Iraq. That must be my justification for troubling you with a separate telegram on a subject with which I have not had occasion to deal previously, although I have followed the correspondence with care.13. Nuri Pasha said that he had been anxious to explain to the King his reasons for sending Taha Pasha El Hashimi and Muwaffaq Bey to Sana and to assure himself that it would not indispose Ibn Sand if they went on straight from here. To me he explained that Taha Pasha had been employed as Chief of Staff, 1 did not gather when or by what Government, in the Yemen and knew the Imam well. He was therefore peculairly qualified to explore a situation of which very little was known. He believed that His Majesty’s Government themselves had only scanty information. Taha Pasha and his colleagues were unable to catch a south-bound steamer leaving here, on the 8th April and stayed behind in Mecca when Nuri Pasha came here. 14. The Pasha mentioned one matter not recorded in my telegrams, namely, that he had reconciled Ibn Saud to Dr. Abdullah Damluji, and had received a friendly message from His Majesty to deliver to that gentleman. 15. Nuri Pasha left Jedda on the 9th August by the Khedivial steamer which had brought him and which delayed its return to Suez twenty-four hours to give him more time. He was seen off by much the same local notables as had received him, except that I think Sheikh Yusuf Yasin went on board. The Turkish and Persian representatives, Mr. Wikeley and I also went to the quay. 16. Altogether the mission has been a greater success than I had dared to anticipate. Both sides have shown qualities of statesmanship. They will doubtless quarrel a great deal in the future, but the present agreement with them marks a notable advance along the road which His Majesty’s Government wish to see the Arab States follow in their relations with each other. If Nuri Pasha has a fault it is, perhaps, that he exaggerates his personal success with people like the King and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin He is, I fancy, too much of a European in externals and too little of a practising Moslem to appeal to them really. On the other hand, he seems to have been both businesslike and con ciliatory, and his general qualities could not fail both to impress and to attract others, however different their outlook. He seems to have a gift for remembering people. Changes of hair and headdress make recognition difficult in the Near East of to-day, but it was delightful to see the Prime Minister of Iraq twice chuck the Hejazi Director-General of Military Organisation under the chin when the former discovered an old colleague in the latter; and the Pasha and the Turkish Charge d’Affaires were with difficulty parted at 1 a.m. after they had located a common past. 17.

The Sheikh ©. pressed a wish to see me and I called on him on April 14th. Although we discussed several matters, the main object on his side was evidently to tell me something about the negotiations with Nuri Pasha. 3. Sheikh Yusuf added practically nothing to my information, said that the modifications in the original draft of the Bon Voisinage Agreement and attached protocol were of quite minor importance. He dwelt on the difficulty which had attended the extradition negotiations, as Nuri Pasha had started from the Cornwallis draft of 1928. In the absence of texts, I was unable m to follow the Sheikas rather Involved explanation of how the mrtter had been finally settled.

The Sheikh said that it had been agreed that i^he treaty texts should be published only after they anything to me about the negotiations. It had been understood that there should be no disclosures but the King nevertheless wished me to know what had been achieved in view of our special interest in the matter. , It was easy for me to promise to use discretion, as Sheikh Yusuf*a statement went little beyond what hurl Pasha had himself told me. 5. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin was good enough to express appreciation of my efforts to pave the way for the agreement. The $£ing has expressed similar appreciation of the endeavours v . of Sir F.Humphrys in his reply to a personal letter from X the High Commissioner which I forwarded, at the re !.uest of Sir Francis, on April 6th.

There was in fact little to communicate between that date and Hurl Pasha’s arrival, except the telegrams exchanged with him, viz. those mentioned in my despatch No.Ill of March £6th and ray telegram No.67 of March i 7th.

At three oclock Arabic (9.p.m.) the same day, the delegation visited the Royal Palace at Al-Ma’abda where they were received by the King and presented the letters that they had brought from His Majesty King Faisal to Hie Majesty the King. The delegation received every sympathy and courtesy from His Majesty during their visit. The delegation was received several times by His Majesty who warmly welcomed them. The following day (Monday) negotiations were commenced with Yusuf Yasin on outstanding matters between the two countries. God crowned the efforts with success and the negotiations ended in agreement and the two treaties were signed by His Royal Highness the Amir Faisal, the Viceroy and Minister for Foreign Affairs. These matters were accomplished in the manner mentioned in the official communique published in the local news of this issue of the 'Umm-al-uira*.

Sir, With reference to your letter No. 89101/31 of March 23rd, transmitting a copy of telegram No.150 of March 20th from the High Commissioner for Iraq, I am directed hy Mr. Secretary Henderson to invite Lord Passfield’s attention to the statement hy the Prime Minister of Iraq that he intended, in the course of his visit to the Hejaz, to explore the possihility of removing or diminishing, in accordance with article 16 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1922, such customs and other harriers as now exist between the Iraqi and Hejazi Governments. 2. Lord Passfield will recollect that, at the time of the negotiation of the provisional agreement between Persia and Iraq, the question was raised hy the Board of Trade in their letter C.R.T. 2546/29 of the 2nd August, 1929, of the effect which the inclusion in that agreement of an unrestricted most- favoured-nation clause would have upon Iraq’s power to grant special customs privileges to neighbouring Arab states in accordance with article 16 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1922. It was accordingly pointed out to the High Commissioner for Iraq that the inclusion in the provisional agreement with Persia of a clause granting unrestricted most-favoured-nation treatment would entitle Persian goods to the benefit of any special customs privileges which might be accorded to neighbouring Arab States and that once accorded to Persian goods, The Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office.goods, those privileges would under article 11 of the Anglo- Iraqi Treaty of 1922, have to he extended during the currency of the agreement to goods of all States Members of the League of Nations. They would also, under the new Tripartite Convention of January 9th, 1930, have to he extended to the United States of America. It was further pointed out that article 1 of the draft customs agreement with Turkey would apparently have a similar effect. 3. Lord Passfield will doubtless consider the desirability of suggesting to the High Commissioner that the Iraqi Government should be reminded of the foregoing consideration^ 4.

The article in question begins with the following preamble:- ^Newspapers have published certain statements by His 'Excellency £uri Pasha a*~3ald the present Iraq Prime 'Minister, the purport of which is that, at an invitation 'from our Government, he will come to Jedda to negotiate 'with Hie Majesty the King concerning certain outstanding 'matters and the question of the Arab Alliance which they 'propose. We did not like to publish anything of the 'information we have concerning the question of the com- 'Ing of the aehe, but, in this connection, we find it 'better now to state that no previous discussion has 'taken place between our Government and the Iraq Govern ment regarding the question of the Arab Alliance. All ‘that we know of this question is what has been published 'by the newspapers in this respect. In order to point 'out the facts we will publish the text of the two tele- 'grans exchanged between their Majesties the two Kings, so 'that people may be aware of the fact as it is % 3. After reproducing the text of the telegrams exchanged between the two Kings, the TEnm-al- ure states that a letter was subsequently received from the Iraq Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the extradition question, which is regarded by the hejasi Government as the most important of the matters in dispute between the two countries. The article goes on to state that while the Heja&amp;i Government, delighted at the prospect of a settlement, were busy with preparations to receive the Iraqi Delegation, they suddenly heard through this Legation that Hurl Pasha had had to postpone/ His Majesty’s 'rlncipal Secretary of Btate for foreign Affairs.postpone his visit owing to the Mosul oil negotiations.

After careful consideration our government find that, far from serving to ensure frontier security and preserve peace and tranquillity, the bases contemplated in the above mentioned letter are calcula ted to encourage criminal activities, to create difficulties for the two governments, and to, from time to time, disturb the friendly relations between the two countries, 1 do not wish to go far for an example In proof of this, as we have before us a case the ramif lost ions of which are still under active dls^ssion between us, and la which figured Fais ,1 Al Dawish and Ibn'ijtf. the first a chief of the ’Utaibah J tribe and the second a chief of the Mutalr tribe.

I should nevertheless like to have your guidance as to whether in the case of acute difference I should attempt mediation either personally or on your behalf. If so I suggest following lines for consideration: 1. Desert posts have not been mentioned in recent correspondence. I presume that His Majesty's Government wish for their own reasons to maintain their previous attitude. If question arises and again proves insoluble arrangements made at Lupin conference might be renewed with provision that the 6 months will ran from now. 2. Bon voisinage.If Ibn Baud hesitates he should be held to the promise given not only to Iraq but to His Majesty's Government to sign agreement provided extradition negotiations are initiated but without reference to their course. I assume that signature of agreement as initialled, will be satisfactory 'unless parties mutually agree to amendments2 . amendments like those suggested by High Commission on 25th March 1930. 3. Extradition. I would propose to use good offices in favour of any compromise regarding political offenders resembling that contemplated in 1928. 4. Claims should no longer present difficulties unless Nuri objects to the King’s proposal to postpone actual payment until other outstanding questions have been settled. 5. Trade facilities, customs and pilgrim traffic. I might suggest postponement if discussion threatens to create obstacle to agreement on other points. 6. Ibn Mashhur.

If the offender is an alien the Minister of interior can, on the recommendation of the court, order his deportation under the Residence Law, It seems possible that this may to some extent assist Your Excellency in finding a formula which will be acceptable to the Hejaz-Najd Government in the matter of extradition.

My Government have carefully considered them and found that the basis therein mentioned cannot ensure security on the frontiers and maintain peace and calmness but have found that they would encourage crimes, bring trouble to both Governments and would provide a cause for the impairing of relation© between the two countries from time to time. I do not want to go too far for the proof as we h ve before us a case pax*ts of which are still in our hands under serious discussion. For instance Faisal ad—lavish end Ibn Bijad, one of them is a leader of Ktsiba tribes and the other is a leader of Mutair tribes, and Farhan ibn Mashhur joined them sometimes. These people committed open and obvious raids against the Iraq tribes and when my Government decided to punish them, they withstood the punitive forces and then some of them took refuge in Iraq and the others took refuge in other neighbouring countries. Is such action by those people to be considered, in the view of the Iraq Governmont, as a sort of politic; 1 crime whose authors it is not proper to hand over 7 I wish to know the view of the Iraq Government and the decisions of their courts in such case.

I therefore shall be glad if your Government will reconsider this question with a view to going back to the basis made by us; because in our view it is impossible for calmness to prevail on the frontier otherwise.

Yusuf Yasin came to see me on February 26th. He brought a Note written on behalf of Minister for Foreign Affairs ex pressing regret of Hejaz government at the delay in connexion with Iraq Prime Minister's visit and fear it might increase difficulties in the way of settlement of outstanding questions, t ] continued that Hejaz government were still prepared to negotiate in spite of delay so frequently noticed and promis ed further explanation in conversation. Yusuf Yasin said that the King had instructed him to speak to me very frankly. He then made a long statement on the following lines: (1) Hejaz government welcomed further and more concilia tory letter from Iraq about extradition and ascribed it to my efforts. (2) They however took strong exception to account of the situation given in Bagdad newspaper 'A1 Iraq' of February 6th I ’.u,xch he showed me. In addition to prominent headings and leading article on Arab alliance paper reproduced statement by the Prime Minister in Parliament to the effect that Ibn | &amp;aud had lnvit ed to Jedda in connexion with that alliance and had promised to pay £30,000 as compensation to Iraq. ^ Hejaz government did not object to latter statement but t fo:n:ier was a complete perversion of the true facts. Nuri i Pasha was not coding by invitation but at the suggestion of/2 . of his own government. There was no question of any Arab ( alliance. What could be the object of such an alliance and against whom was it to be directed? Yusuf Yasin Insisted that Arabic word hilf which was used implied alliance for common action against other parties. He said the statement repeating Nuri's utterance and copies of telegrams ex changed would be published in Mecca paper on February 27th. (3) Hejaz government could never trust Iraq which al ways gave false turn to things but they had confidence In His Majesty's Government and had wished to fall in with their views. (4) Hejaz government had been willing to postpone Ibn Mashhur question until 1\ ur i came and had kept silence regard ing it* Iraq, had recently published its own version and denied any undertaking to surrender Ibn Mashhur. if Nuri was not coming hejaz government would be compelled to make facts public. As regards the last point I demurred to statement that hejaz government had kept silence. I referred to Philby's letter in 'Near East' of December 25th. I said its author was so closely and notoriously associated with the King and government that he could only be considered to reflect their views. He could certainly not have obtained his information except ircm tnem and so far as His Majesty's Government were concerned he had made an accusation graver than that of the government themselves. He had said that His Majesty's Gov ernment had not merely failed in an obligation but had done so after admitting it. Yusuf Yasin made some attempt to deny that Philby's version was inspired. I suggested that the King might in that case send me disavowal for transmission to you. I en quired as to the nature of publication by Iraq government which/301 3 . whicn was complained of in this connexion. I gathered that reference was to the leading article in 'Near East' of Eeoruary 5th. I pointed out that this could not he regarded 3-s a statement by the Iraq government. 1 uhen dealt witl1 other points. As regards (l) I spoke on the same general lines as in earlier conversations. As regardo (2) I suggested that we should all stick to the purpose of real business in hand,to solid basis established by conversations of last July and should not let newspapers publications or bazaar gossip give wrong turn to straightfor ward negotiation. I deprecated Hejaz government rushing into print until more was known of Nuri Pasha's movements. As re- ® arcis 1 sa id there was too much mistrust on both sides between principals and that object of His Majesty's Govern ment was to establish greater confidence and promote under standing which would provide basis for it. I urged that reason given for postponement of Prime Minister's visit was perfectly reasonable.! pointed out that it had delayed other visits besides that to Jedda and begged Hejaz government not to imagine that delay was due to ulterior political motiveso I made it clear throughout that I was expressing pure- ly personal views.

I was greatly taken aback by contents of newspapers which Yusuf Yasin produced. I could only admit that they misrepresent facts of the situation. I felt it was necessary to make immediate efforts to sooth out raged foelings of Ibn Baud who is clearly much incensed by attempts to involve him in Arab alliance project. I tried to minimize its importance in present circumstances without expressing any view as to its merits. I suggested allowance should be made for difficulties of Nuri Fasha in country which unlike this had parliamentary institution and active press. Whilst I deprecated proposed publication in Mecca newspapers I aid not press the point on learning it had already gone forward. Yusuf Yasin said it would restore things to their true proportion and I said I did not think it would do any particular ham although I should have personally preferred it to be postponed. Later in the day I received your telegram No. 32. I will endeavour to Keep off the whole subject as far as possible during remainder of the King’s visit.

Minister for Foreign Affairs communicated to me on Januarv 29th letter from Iraa Minister for Foreign Affairs of tJ JL w December 13th regarding extradition and his own reply. Latter is not dated in my copy but was sent some days ago. It is polite but firm as to need for exclusion of tribesmen from political offender clauses. Minister having expressed wish to discuss matter I had long conversation with lussuf Yasin on February 2nd. In order to test present position I stated my understanding of oral agree ment reached with Fuad in July viz.: that Ibn Saud would complete Bon Voisinago agreement if Iraq representatives were sent here to sign it and were given powers to negotiate extradition treaty. Yussuf Yasin did not demur but insisted on importance of extradition treaty on lines desired by the King. I dwelt upon advantage of Bon Voisinage agreement in itself. I said the matter was now again undor active consideration and I hoped it might prove possible to send Iraq representatives hero. As regarded extradition I personally was impressed by necessity for adapting treaty to special condition of frontier. If callod upon, as I probably should bo, to help the parties directly concerned I should endeavour to promote discovery of formula suitable for that purpose and in my personal opinion proposalsproposals mooted at time of Clayton mission might help even u-ough txiey had lapsed owing to failure of the then negotiations. Formula v/ould however only he found as result of negotia tions now contemplated and it would be useless to attemot to establish it beforehand. I suggested that recent letter from Iran Minister for Foreign Affairs might be regarded merely as a staccment oi extreme views of the kind common when Powers not completely friendly were approaching discussion of a difficult matter. I was careful not to reveal too much and to confine myself as far as possiole to personal appreciation while endeavouring to create favouraole atmosphere. If I could say at next suit- aole moment (perhaps in form oi personal letter summarizing what I said) that you had approved my language it might have happy offect. I think that prospects of success would be greatly increased if Nuri Pasha made conciliatory gesture regard ing extradition on lines suggested in Bagdad telegram No. 3 without awaiting Kedjaz Covernment f s reply ho his previous letters. I am still convinced that ail our efforts will fail unloss he comes here prepared to moot Ton Saud to reasonable extent ovor question of tribal offenders. It would be almost worso if Bon Voisinage agreement were completed and extradition negotiations then broke down through lack of spirit of accommoda tion on Iraq side. Ibn Saud would think he had been trickod into tho former by His Majesty r s Crovernment as he yielded to the extent re did in July only under strong pressure. Much time is lost by postal communications be two on Bagdad and iviQcca. Gould not Bur i Pasha do induced to telegraph about his intended lisit intimating at the same tine his readiness to approach/ Mi approach question of political offenders in conciliatory spirit? If his visit takes placo the sooner it can he arranged (? gp. cm*) Ramazan tho better it will be.

The assurances given by Prime Minister as to two points mentioned in second paragraph of Jeddah telegram of 2nd Jenury are gladly noted by them. It is presumed with reference to penultimate paragraph of Jeddah telegram that the statement to the Baghdad press by the Prime Minister regarding an Arab Alliance is that reported in the 'As-Zaman' of Sunday, the 19th October, 1930, a copy of which was enclosed with your despatch No.1043 of 22nd October. Having regard to traditional hostility and suspicion between ruling families and more particularly to present bad stats of relations between Trans-Jordan find Hejns~Nejd/close alliance between Iraq Trans-Jordan and Hejas-Nejd is in the opinion of H.M.Government at present outside scope of practical politios. I should therefore be glad if you would endeavour discreetly to ascertain what is the exafct sco-e of his project and report to me. You should, if he does in fact intend to mention this matter during his visit to the Hejaz, warn him tnat while any move tending to improve relations between the three Arab States would be welcomed by H.M.

As regards condition (b) Prime Minister says he has no intention of taking up a 'non possumus” attitude but is quite ready to consider any proposal put forward by Hedjaz-Nejd Government as soon Bonvoisinage agreement is signed. I am requesting him to send a letter in this sense superseding letter No.4178 of December 11th and I will discuss with him question raised in penultimate paragraph of Jeddah telegram under reference as soon as I receive views of His Majesty’s Government thereon. If Priiae Minister’s proposed visit is approved in princroie King Faisal will doubtless communicate with Ibn Saud as suggested but 2 can scarcely ask him to do so until His Majesty’s Government have concurred in the proposal.

My concurrence in present proposal is subject to the following two conditions viz (a) that Nuri will bo able to ensure early ratification cf bon voisinage agreement when signed and (b) that he will be prepared at the outset to make some show of readiness to meet Kejaz Government on Question of tribal offenders when negotiating extradition treaty e.g. by offering to accept proposal in Nuad's letter to Iraq Minister for Foreign Affairs of July 25th as basis of discussion. As regards (a) ratification is more important than signature and Ibn Baud will not ratify until the Treaty has passed Iraq Parliament.

They do not consider it doubtful that the offences which certain tribesmen commit will be sometimes of a political nature or for the realization of a political object, and they do not find a strong reason to differentiate between the fiedu and urbans as regards the apnlication of the rule for the non-extradition of political offenders. Iraq Government, when asked to extradite any offender who run away to their country, whether it be an ordinary or political offender, refer his case to the Monsieur le ^inistre, I have the honour to refer to your letter Ho. 25A/31 dated 25th July,1930, rerardinp the The Iraq Government have acquainted themselves The Iraq Government apree with you to the seditions and troubles between the two countries; It is not hid from Your excellency that the courts-•V ■■■■■■■ &amp; ax, ^ courts for examination in accordance with the laws in force before the handing over of that person. For instance, if a UaJ di tribesman ooremltd in iiaj d an offence which necessitate# his extradition and take# shelter in Iraq, and then his government ask that he should be extradited for that offence, the Iraq Govern ment will not object to meet the demand for extradi tion if it was proved to the Iraqi court from the result of the enquiries that the of fence which that person had committed was not of a political nature and was not committed for the realization of a political object. But if it appears to the court that the oftence was of a political nature and that that offender had committed this offence for the realization of a political object there will remain no reason to di iferentiate between him and an urban who commits a similar offence. The same case aoplies to the Iraqi offender who runs away to Najd territory. I am awaiting your views on the above, which I hope will be communicated to me at an early date.
