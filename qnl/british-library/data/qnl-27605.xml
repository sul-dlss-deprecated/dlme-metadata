Secondly, it was found that, what ever that interpretation might be, a frontier drawn in strict conformity therewith would be likely to be unsatisfactory for various reasons. It was in consequence of these findings, and in order to promote a final settlement of the problem, that the British and French Governments, by two identical notes dated November nth and 10th, 1931, respectively, laid the question before the Council of the League of Nations. 2 Al a meeting held at Paris on November qCy the Council undertook the examination of this question. 3 The representative of Yugoslavia, Rapporteur for mandates questions, ex plained the origins of the question, and supported the suggestion of the Governments concerned that the Council should appoint a commission of enquiry. He pointed out that the commission’s task would be defined by the actual terms of the request made by the British and French Governments; it would consist in collecting on the spot full information and particulars as to the military, political, administrative, tribal, economic, geo graphical and other problems which the question involved, so as to permit of its thorough investigation. The Council adopted the following resolution: “The Council, “In pursuance of the joint request by the British and French Governments: “ (1) Decides to accept, in principle, the British and French Governments’ request that it should examine all aspects of the difficulties raised by the delimitation of the frontier between Syria and Iraq, should form its conclusions as to the intentions of Article 1 of the Franco-British Convention of December 23rd, 1920, and should then indicate a frontier between Syria and Iraq based on this Convention but modified as required by the aforementioned considerations; “ (2) Decides to set up a Commission consisting of three commissioners selected for their special competence, being nationals of countries not parties to the question, assisted by four assessors, to collect full information and particulars on the spot, and to make such suggestions as may assist the Council in framing its decision on this question, this decision will be final; “ (3) Requests the President in Office of the Council to appoint, with the assistance of the Rapporteur for mandates questions, the members of the above-mentioned Com mission; the two parties are requested to submit jointly proposals in this connec ion, “ (4) Decides that the sums required by the Commission for the accomplishment of its work shall be borne by the British and French Governments, the mandatory Powers for Iraq and Syria.” 1 See 2 'realy Series (League of Nations), 2 Document C.843.1931.VI. 3 See Minutes of the sixty-fifth session of Volume XXII, 1924, Nos. x, 2, 3 and 4, pages 355 to 361. the Council, No. 2963, pages 2372 to 2374.On the proposal of the President of the ^“J^^emberrof 5 th^commission of enquiry of one of the parties concerned, * e ^'^“representative of Spain, with the assistance of the was entrusted to his predecessor in office, the represen R apporreur “^'stions^ ^ Commission was constituted as follows: ““colonel James be Revniee (Swiss), Commission.

These assessors were: On the Franco-Syrian side: Squadron-Leader Bonnot; Nessib Bey Ayoubi, Mutessarif of Hasseche. On the Anglo-Iraqi side: Major C. J. Edmonds, Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior of Iraq; Colonel Sabih Bey Nejib, Director-General of the Iraqi Police. The Commission, to which the four assessors had now been added met the day after its arrival to come to an agreement on the general plan of its work. To facilitate a thorough study of the various areas in question, the Commission decided to divide the frontier line into six sectc ^ s - In each sector a centrally-situated and easily-accessible place was chosen as a base for the work of the Commission, which was to camp at these bases successively. The sectors and camps were as follows: Jebel Tenf to Albu Kemal, Camp on the Jebel Tenf; Euphrates Area, Camp at Albu Kemal; Salt Deposits Area, Camp at Bir Sehil; Southern Sinjar Area, Camp at Sukenia; Northern Sin jar Area, Camp at Senuni; Tigris Area, Camp at Khanik. As the season was already advanced, it was agreed that the work should start from the south — that is to say, at the Jabal Tenf — and that the Commission should move gradually northward so as to avoid the great heat, which is already formidable in May in the southern parts of the desert. During its brief stay at Beirut, the Commission was cordially welcomed by the French authorities. It desires to tender its thanks to the High Commissioner of the French Republic in Syria and the Lebanon, M. Henri Ponsot, and all his assistants, who gave the Commission every facility to accomplish its task. The Commission then proceeded by aeroplane to Baghdad in order to get into touch with the British and Iraqi authorities. At the last moment, Colonel de Reynier was obliged to postpone his departure for a few days— 13 - received tyth* representatt^ of° RM Ihe by ^ C r ommissi »“rs were ve.y cordially Commissioner in Iraq, and by certain members o' tbe r y S rancis Humphrys, H.B.M.

The King’s representative, the High Commissioner, and all the members of the Iraqi Government and the Diplomatic Corps associated themselves with this last tiibute. Detachments of British and Iraqi troops rendered the funeral honours. The coffins were then placed in a militaiy aeroplane, which conveyed them to Damascus, accompanied by another machine carrying the members of the Commission. The High Commissioner, M. Henri Ponsot, attended by the civil and military authorities, was at the Damascus aerodrome awaiting the arrival of the aeroplane, which was met by three French flights. As soon as the aeroplane landed, the last honours were paid by the troops of the garrison, and the body of the Chairman, Colonel de Reynier, was then conveyed to Beirut, and afterwards to Switzerland. We desire to pay a heartfelt tribute to the memory of Colonel James de Reynier. His energy, clearsightedness, and uprightness made him eminently suitable for the delicate task with which he had been entrusted; in a few days, he had gained the high esteem and complete confidence of those who had to work under him, and his death was a very real grief to them. At the request of the two mandatory Powers concerned, the Commission was authorised by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations to continue its work provisionally, pending the appointment and arrival of the new Chairman. It was then decided what method was to be followed in the enquiry. 1 he Commission was to proceed to the frontier zone and endeavour to collect on the spot all information that might be of use. It was to study the area, travelling all over it, visiting the villages and questioning the inhabitants. This work was to be greatly aided by the new 1:200,000 maps which had been piepaied jointly lay the topographical departments of the two Governments for the Commission s special use. Transport of various kinds had been placed at the Commission s disposal by the Governments concerned. Convoys of motor-cars, escorted by motor machine-gun detachments supplied y the two parties, had been organised. In addition, to facilitate long-distance reconnaissance the Officer Commanding the British Air Force detailed a large transport aeroplane capable o carrying all the members of the Commission and the assessors. Later, a field wireless station was erected in the camps, also by the Royal Air Force. Being thus enabled to move about with ease, the Commission succeeded m carrying out a very full enquiry in each sector of the frontier in a comparatively short space of t^e. Whereve^ additional information was felt to be necessary, the Commission applied to the as . two parties, who replied by written notes to the questions put to them. Further, availing themselves of the right granted to them to call lo( !al cases, the assessors summoned before the Commission numerous repre POPU To tl0 exdude all possibility of intimidation and to inspire the witnesses eonfidence, they were questioned in the sole presence of the mterpietei o ^ p ^ J ^ ma j n confidential, summoned. They were also given an assurance that their statements won Having made all necessary arrangements, the Commission occupied its first camp, close 40 Its^iS^'Sk&amp;stAtctor, which is complete de^t ^ ^“rSdtnVS of a topographical nature.

It was very cordially r “ el ™ d ^ ^ there, and took advantage of the opportunity to obtain information regardm., the commeici relations between this important centre and the frontier districts. From Senuni, where a landing-ground had been made, several air reconnaissances were carried out between May 6th and 12th, in particular as far as Albu Kemal, P 1185 /'® ^hi 'h deposits. Colonel Iselin thus being given an opportunity to examine the de ‘ ads ° f * ls ar f ® a - ™ t L the Commission had previously studied. Several flights over the Qara Chok Dagh as far as the Tigris afforded a general view of the Kabur basin and the area known as the Bee de Canard (Duck’s Bill) In the intervals, the Commissioners motored to the important villages oi Dara Mamissa, and Adika, on the northern flanks of the Jebel Sinjar. Several days were also spent in interviewing witnesses summoned by the assessors to inform the Commission as to the economic relations between the Jebel and the towns of Hasseche and Kameshha, on the Syrian border. When these witnesses were being heard in camp, the whole Commission was always present; but when it visited the villages on the northern slope of the Sinjar, M. Marrades, who was still not fit for motoring, was unable to accompany his colleagues. On May 12th, the Commission left Senuni by car on the way to its last camp at Khanik, on the Tigris, opposite Faish Kabur. On the way it stopped at the encampment of Sheik Ajil, the supreme chief of the Shammar tribe of Iraq, with whom the Commissioners discussed the general question of the tribes and their changes of pastureland. From Khanik, reconnaissances were made by motor and on horseback along the Tigris and the Qara Chok Dagh, and also in the Rumelan Keui area, and as far as the French post at Derik, in the “Bee de Canard”. Regarding its enquiry on the ground as completed, the Commission held a final meeting on May 16th, at which the Chairman thanked the four assessors for their valuable assistance. While Colonel Iselin, accompanied by the Secretary, went by air to Baghdad to pay a visit of courtesy to H.M. the King and the Members of the Iraqi Government, M. Petersen and M. Marrades returned direct to Beirut. The Commission reassembled at Beirut on May 19th, and spent nearly a week in classifying and working out the conclusions drawn from its work on the ground. The Chairman and the Secretary left Beirut for Geneva by sea on May 25th. M. Petersen left for Geneva the same day, via Ankara and Istanbul, where he obtained some additional technical information. The Chairman and M. Petersen met again at Geneva on June 2nd, and were rejoined on June 8th by M. Marrades, who had been detained at Beirut. 1 See Official journal of the League of Nations, March 1932, pages 503 to 506 and 798 to 801.CHAPTER III. FRANCO-BRmsH CONVENTION O, DECEMBER I.

The Cartographical Basis of the Convention. It is unfortunate that the text quoted above was not accompanied by any map. Obviouslv however, the negotiators, none of whom appears to have been acquainted with the countrv itself' must have discussed the matter over a map. But what map? They nowhere refer to one and in spite of considerable research, we have not been able to settle this point definitely though it is of high importance m endeavouring to grasp the negotiators’ intentions. We note, however, that the Governments of the two mandatory States agree to regard the British International 1:1,000,000 map published in 1916 and revised in 1918 ” 2 as the one which was used for the negotiations and for the conclusion of the 1920 Convention. The French Government, in its letter dated January 23rd, 1932, to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, after explaining its interpretation of Article 1 of the Convention, observes: The foregoing definition is based on the British 1:1,000,000 International Map, published in 1916 and revised in 1918, which the negotiators of the Franco-British Convention of December 23rd, 1920, had before them. ” 3 The British Government, in its letter of January 30th, 1932, to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, states: “ All external and internal evidence points to the 1:1,000,000 Asia map of 1916. It is understood that this is not questioned. ” 4 Although no positive proof has been advanced in favour of this argument, it is highly probable that the map referred to above was indeed the one used by the negotiators. It contains all the names given in the Convention, indicates the administrative boundaries specified therein, and also shows quite distinctly — though incompletely — ■ the basin of the Western Kabur, which the Convention expressly mentions. At a first glance, however, one peculiar point will be noted: the orthography of all the place-names quoted in the Convention differs from that employed in the map, whereas, throughout the rest of the text, greater accuracy is observed. True, the original text of the Convention was doubtless prepared by some French authority, since the points of the compass (East, South-East and South) are always quoted in their relation to Syna. It is therefore probable that, in this first draft, the English orthography employed in the map was more or less gallicised, whereas the map was no longer consulted when the branch text came to be translated into English. . „ , , However that may be, we cannot, in the absence of other evidence, do otherwise than concui with the opinion of the two parties and regard the 1:1,000,000 map as t a wnci mus ave been used for the negotiations and for the conclusion of the 1920 Conven ion. . , This map is obviously not an ideal cartographical basis tor the study of so importa ^ question. It was prepared mainly on the basis of the 1:850, 000 ma P . 1 f / various published by Dr. Richard Kiepert in 1893, and also on the basis o o cr cmrselv-nooulated sources. In point of fact, when the map was prepared, no general survey 7 P ? ific and desert region had been made. The only maps m existence we^ expeditions. It is therefore not surprising that a compilation o is , , rather as a sketch and even, in some places, inaccurate. At the present time, 1 won ^ 8 negotiators been than as a map. Naturally, it would have been far more able to base their work on some more accurate and adequate oc better, however, they were reduced to using the map in ques ion. * Asia 1: ,.000,000.

Tigris Sector. To the east, the Tigris from Jeziret-ibn-Omar to the boundaries of the former vilayets of Diarbekir and Mosul. ThP Tm-ro Irani frontier as a result of the decision of the Council of the League dated October 9th, 1925, and of the 5 Tigris and of the Kabur, this confluence is the point of departure of the Syro-Iraqi frontier^ . From this confluence the frontier is marked by the thalweg of the river as far as the point where the river 2 intersected by the boundary between the former vilayets of Diarbekir and Mosul, as shown on the 1 : 1,000,000 map. II. Tigris-Rumelan Keui Sector. To the south and south-east the aforesaid boundary of the former vilayets southwards as far as Rumelan Keui. From the point of intersection between the thalweg of the Tigris and the boundary of the vilayets, the frontier follows this boundary, as shown on the 1 : 1,000,000 map; 2 the boundary bends towards the south in its w , portion and passes slightly south of Rumelan Keui. The expression “as far as Rumelan Keui ” should therefore be taken to mean “as far as the point opposite Rumelan Keui ” — i.e., as far as the nearest point to Rumelan Keui on the boundary of the vilayets. The position of Rumelan Keui is determined by the geographical co-ordinate assigned to it on the said map. III. Rumelan Keui-Euphrates Sector. Thence a line leaving in the territory under French mandate the entire basin of the Western Kabur and passing in a straight line towards the Euphrates, which it crosses at Abu Kemal. Albu Kemal is not on the Euphrates, but 400 metres to the west of the right bank of the river. The frontier cannot cross the Euphrates at Albu Kemal itself; it crosses it at the nearest point on its course to Albu Kemal. The beginning and end of this line being thus determined, the line should, according to the Convention, (1) Leave the whole of the Kabur Basin to the French mandate; (2) Proceed in a straight line to the Euphrates, which it crosses opposite Albu Kemal. If reference is made to the 1 : 1,000,000 map, a straight line joining the two above-mentioned points seems to answer to these two conditions. IV. Euphrates-Imtan Sector. Thence a straight line to Imtan, to the south of Jabal Druse. This definition calls for no comment. The foregoing definition is based on the British 1 : 1,000,000 international map, published in 1916 and revised in 1918, 2 which the negotiators of the Franco-British Convention of December 23rd, 1920, had before them. The following maps should also be mentioned for reference: The map of 1 : 1,000,000 annexed to the Treaty of Sevres; the map annexed to the report of the Commission of Enquiry appointed by the League of Nations to consider the question of the frontier between Turkey and Iraq; the map of 1 : 1,000,000 annexed to thelBritish White Book containing the text of the Treaty concluded at Ankara on June 5th, 1926, between the United Kingdom, Iraq and Turkey (Treaty Series, No. 18 [1927]). 3 I enclose for your information a copy of the British 1 : 1,000,000 international map on which the Syro-Iraqi frontier between the Tigris and the Euphrates has been traced in conformity with the definition given above.

All external and internal evidence points to the i : 1,000,000 Asia map of 1916. It is understood that this is not questioned. 3. The Convention must therefore be read in the light of the i : 1,000,000 Asia map of 1916. This map is admit tedly little more than a sketch-map, and is far from accurate. The application to the ground of any line drawn on this map is likely to present many difficult problems which must come up for solution at a later stage. They have, how ever, no connection with the interpretation of the Convention, which must take the form of drawing on the map used the line which the framers of the Convention intended to describe. 4. The first sector as far as Rumelan Keui offers no difficulty of interpretation. The boundary would follow the Tigris from the mouth of the Kabur, where the frontier between Iraq and Turkey begins, to a point opposite Faish Kabur, and thence the administrative boundary marked on the map to Rumelan Keui. 5. The succeeding passage, from the words “thence a line ” to the words “ crosses at Abu Kemal ”, is obscure. It is not contended that the wording of the Convention absolutely rules out a straight line from Rumelan Keui to Abu Kemal. There is, however, no reason to doubt that, for the reasons developed in paragraph 6 below, the line which is described in the Convention, and which the framers intended to describe, is that shown in red on the accom panying copy from the map of 1916. 2 This line may be more fully described in words as follows: From Rumelan Keui a curved line running south of the Wady-er-Radd in the general direction west- south-west and then south-south-west so as to leave in Syria all the drainage-lines running to the Kabur, after passing between the Lake of Khatuniya, which it leaves to Iraq, and the heads of the two drainage lines, which it leaves in Syria, the line continues in the same direction to a point on parallel of latitude 36“ N. immediately to the east of the head of Shaib Abu Hamda, the most southerly of the drainage-lines to the Kabur shown on the map; from this point a straight line towards the Euphrates to the e m en 1 , whence it crosses the Euphrates at right angles to Albu Kemal. 6 . 7 - The following considerations are adduced in support of the line described above as opposed to the straight line. (a) It is highly improbable that the framers of the Convention would have drawn a line bisecting so prominent a feature as the Jabal Sinjar. / h\ if a straight line from Rumelan Keui to Albu Kemal had been intended, there would have been no need to mention the basin of the Kabur, since the map shows the whole of the basin well to the wes of such a straight line. _ tr\ Furthermore the use of the word “line ” in the phrase referring to the basin of the Kabur an 'straight line ' in the’phrase referring to the approach to the Enphrates snpports the v that ae framers were not describing a line straight throughout its length between Rumelan Kem and Albu Kemal, g the clumsy wording of the sentence, taken alone, does no exc u e su &lt; . {d) The line described in paragraph 5 corresponds closely with the actual situation o taming a of the conclusion of the Convention. The last sector, a straight line from Albu Kemal to Imtan, presents no difficulties of interpretation. (c) The French and British Interpretations compared.

Interpretation of the Convention by the Commission of Enquiry. The Commission wa ' ‘l 16 CO h nCil of the 1920 Convention; but it ' lls . a! ’ k . Convent ion and we are therefore obliged to begin We shad proceed, like the negotiators, by sectors, from north to south. (a) Tigris Sector. ■■ On the east, the Tigris from Jeziret-ibn-Omar to the boundaries of the former vilayets of Diarbekir and Mosul... ” between the two States. Tme the thalwee of a river is not immutable any more than are its banks, the beds of rivers being^almost constantly undergoing change by erosion. The stronger *0 ™^ the deeper the water and the less resistant the soil, the greater are these changes and the more rapi y do they occur The relatively regular course of the Tigris m this region, however, warrants the assumption that the variations in its thalweg are not very appreciable, and that, taken over a fairly long stretch of river, the gains balance the losses. We may therefore assume that the present thalweg of the Tigris is practically the same as that to which in 1920 the Convention was undoubtedly meant to refer, though if we are not mistaken no survey had been made at the time. Accordingly, this thalweg should form the frontier down to the spot at which the boundary between the former vilayets of Diarbekir and Mosul crosses the Tigris. The old Turkish maps, which were consulted, though they indicate the general boundaries of the vilayets as shown in the 1:1,000,000 map, are too inaccurate and defective to enable us to determine this spot. More recent maps, like that published in 1893 by Dr. Kiepert of Berlin, or the map of halting-places prepared in 1917 by the Kartogr. AUeilung der kgl. Preuss. Landes- aufnahme, do not indicate the boundaries of the Turkish vilayets. The official year-book of the Ottoman Empire for 1325 (1909) also fails to show these boun daries, but it does mention the various districts and sub-districts in each vilayet. By ascertaining on the map the situation of the chief villages of these administrative divisions, it is possible to deduce the rough outline of the boundaries of the two vilayets. Such enquiries do not in any way suggest that the boundaries differ from those shown in the 1:1,000,000 map. The information obtained from numerous inhabitants of the district was too vague to allow of any definite pronouncement. The only conclusion we were able to draw from their answers was that the village of Faish Kabur, on the left bank of the Tigris, has always formed part of the Qaza of Jeziret-ibn-Omar, and consequently of the vilayet of Diarbekir. The boundary thus appears to have crossed the Tigris below Faish Kabur; but how far below ? The 1920 negotiators certainly did not possess any other data on the subject; they could only rely on the map, which places the point of intersection immediately below Faish Kabur. We have no reason to suppose that they placed this boundary on the ground elsewhere than on the map. Moreover, both parties, in their official interpretation of the 1920 Convention, agree in adhering to the indications given in the map; and, as no more detailed information is available, we can only do likewise. (b) Sector from the Tigris to Rumelan Keui. “ . . . on the south-east and south, the aforesaid boundary of the former vilayets southwards as far as Rumelan Keui... ” From the Tigris, therefore, the frontier is to follow the boundary of the former vilayets of Diarbekir and Mosul as far as Rumelan Keui. Here the intention of the negotiators is clear: but what were their ideas as to how the boundary was placed on the ground, and what point did they mean by “ Rumelan Keui ” ?As regards this part of the bounth™ Ith-w^Tn °a ^ 1 :=^ t ° WdttSSIhe 4 Ti westwards.

The new British maps, how ever, give different information: one, on the scale of r: 126,720 (edition of February 1927), makes no mention of Humeian Keui, whereas the other, on a scale of 1:200,000 (edition of April 1032) shows a village marked as “Rumailan Koi”. r ^ ' In view of these differences in the maps and of the great importance of Humeian Keui for the objective interpretation of the 1920 Convention, we conducted very full enquiries on the spot, the results of which are as follows: There is now neither an inhabited village nor a ruined village in this region. The oldest nomads who frequent those parts do not remember ever having seen or heard tell of a village called Humeian Keui. On the other hand, we discovered, about four kilometres north-west of the Tell Humeian Kebir (i.e., at the exact spot at which, according to the French 1:200,000 map, 3 the ruins of “Roumelane Keui” are situated), indisputable traces of old permanent dwellings (worked stone, potsherds) and numerous recent traces of tent encampments. The tell in question, though not very high, covers a fairly large area, around which winds a wadi, flowing into the Wadi Humeian. It is, in fact, just such a site as would be chosen in this country for establishing permanent or temporary dwellings. It would therefore seem legitimate to suppose that this is the actual site of the former village of Humeian Keui. There is nothing extraordinary in the fact that the name should have outlived the village; moreover, in this part of the country the word “village” seems also to be used to denote places at which nomads are accustomed to pitch their tents at various seasons. We therefore believe that this is actually the Humeian Keui referred to in the Convention. It should further be noted that another Humeian Keui, situated, according to the British 1:126,720 map, about five kilometres west of Mustapha Uieh, cannot possibly have been the village intended in the Convention of 1920. This latter place, which is not shown m any o e other maps, would be more than ten kilometres north of the boundary of the vilayets, an canno therefore be considered. (c) SectoY fYOYH Rumelan Keui to the Euphyutes. “ . . . thence (from Rumelan Keui) a line leaving in the territory under the entire basin of the Western Kabur and passing in a straight line owar P which it crosses at Abu Kemal. ” It is to be regretted that a section of the frontier about 300 iUe^nd incomplete accorded only so imprecise a description in the Convention. Admi e Y’ ? expressing their 1:1,000,000 map 3 was not an instrument calculated to help t e nego reason for making thoughts; but it seems to us that that might have been regarded as a further reason tor ma » the meaning as clear as possible. The 1920 Convention refers on the one hand to the entire basm Ka , ^ point other to a straight line to the Euphrates at Albu Kema . oes , ’p ne towards Albu at which the frontier should leave the Kabur Basin to proceed m a straight line Kemal. 1 See Annex No. 1. 2 See Annex^No. 2.rronprpllv used to denote 3.11 those The expression “basin”, referring to a watercours^^ ^ wate y rcour3 e, the ground being parts of territory which dram then wa c cx i s t e nt Every cross-section of a river there- supposed to be impermeable and evaporatm downstream the cross-section, the wider the fore includes a basin of a certain size, the rower basm. „ x ron i(i not form even an approximate As the negotiators had only the i: i.ooo.ooo map, &gt; indeed, in this map that there idea of the extent of the Kahn.- Basm m this reborn 1 hey noted^m f &amp; aU flowing ; the were lines of drainage coming from the north and^t regarding the region lying Wadi-er-Radd, but they posses so _ P | 1 a p 0 ut fifty kilometres wide, is a complete between that wadi and the Jebel ^n]ar ^ bol i n dary of the Kabur Basin might just as well blank on the map.

The watershed between the Kabur and the Tigris - the boundary k, ““Xanv the 1920 Convention meant to indicate — is unfortunately very difficult to determine wrt y accuracy. The ground is extremely flat, and even the latest maps merely show the height few tells (the figures themselves often varying considerably as between the British and hrenc maps !), while no heights at all are given for the plain. In these circumstances, re cannot be determined with sufficiently approximate correctness on the maps at present at ou disposal. It will therefore be necessary to make accurate measurements on the ground o\er a considerable area. It may, however, be assumed, on the basis of the equidistances s own in the latest French maps, 1 2 that this watershed will not be found to depart very fai from the meridian of 42 0 E. or 46.666 grades. The boundary would thus correspond approximately witti this meridian as far as the crest of the Jebel Sinjar, along which it would then procee wes w ai s. We would further observe that, according to the new 1:200,000 maps 2 and our own observa tions, a wadi, which has no name on the map, and which acts as a collector for the various wa er- courses that come down from the highest massif of the Sinjar, continues as far as the Radd, into which it flows slightly west of the elbow which the Wadi Rumelan forms with the Radd. 1 is fact makes all discussion concerning wadies coming from the Sinjar further to the west unnecessary. Thev all form Dart of the Kabur Basin. One more error into which the negotiators were drawn by the 1:1,000,000 map needs cor rection. According to that map, the3 r were justified in believing that Rumelan Keui was outside, or at any rate on the very edge of, the Kabur Basin. In point of fact, this is not so. According to the latest maps and our own observations on the ground, that point is actually situated a few kilometres inside the basin. It would therefore be impossible to draw through Rumelan Keui a line that would leave the whole of the Kabur Basin under French mandate. Nevertheless, the intention of the negotiators to maintain the unity of that basin is so clear that we need not dwell upon it; and it is therefore indispensable, if the intentions of the Convention are to be complied with, that the frontier should diverge from the former boundary between the vilayets of Mosul and Diarbekir before it reaches Rumelan Keui — i.e., at the point where that boundary reaches the Kabur Basin — and that the frontier should then follow the contour of that basin southwards. The effect of our interpretation of the expression “the entire basin of the Kabur’’ is that the straight line mentioned in the Convention should start immediately south of the crest of the Sinjar-Jeribeh chain, at a point at which the Kabur Basin abuts on the neighbouring basin of the salt-deposit region. Unfortunately, this point cannot be determined by the aid of the existing maps; for the same difficulties are met with here as north of the Sinjar — there are no adequate topographical indications. It may, however, be assumed, pending further details, that this point is situated about ten kilometres west of the summit of the Jebel Jeribeh (Point 903 on the French map). A straight line proceeding thence to the Euphrates at Albu Kemal passes near the Tell Sfug. According to the Convention, this straight line ought to cross the Euphrates at Albu Kemal. This text cannot, however, be applied literally, because Albu Kemal is not situated on the Euphrates itself but lies at a distance of one kilometre from the right bank. In these circumstances, we believe that the intentions of the negotiators would best be respected by providing that the frontier should cross the Euphrates at the spot nearest to Albu Kemal. 1 See Annex No. 1, 2 See Annex No. t.(d) SeCt ° r 10 the South of the Euphrates.

Veral faCt ° rS that COntrib ' ted to P rolon S the uncertainty as to the definitive the first place, the final assignment of the vilayet of Mosul was still in suspense, and indeed was not settled until December 1925. Secondly, it was not until June 22nd, 1929, that the course of the frontier between Syria and Turkey was fixed by the Franco-Turkish Protocol. The effect o this latter ciicumstance was that the occupation by Syria of the territories eventually allotted to it m the Bee de Canard area near the Tigris was delayed until June 1930. In view of this uncertainty as to the exact delimitation of the territories of the two parties, they natui ally endeavoured to arrive at a modus vivendi on the basis of provisional agreements which would enable them to arrange for general administration, the collection of taxes, and the establishment of military or police posts in the zone on either side of the presumed frontier. It should be noted that these agreements were concluded only subject to an express reserva tion by both parties as to the maintenance of the rights they derived from the Convention. The agreements were in no way to prejudge the eventual decision as to the final delimitation of the frontier. These provisional arrangements brought about, however, a de facto situation which, though in many ways complicated and in some cases vague, was deserving of the Commission’s careful attention, inasmuch as it represented a solution that the two parties found provisionally acceptable, having regard to local needs. Sector from the Tigris to Rumelan Keui. With regard to this northernmost sector of the frontier, it should be observed that it no longer starts from Jeziret-ibn-Omar, as stated in the Convention of 1920. t he treaties finally settling the frontiers between Turkey and Syria and between Turkey and Iraq have shifted tire starting- point to the junction of those two frontiers — i.e., the confluence of the Tigris and the Eastern Kabur. We have explained in the previous chapter the differences of opinion that arose as to the exact site of Rumelan Keui. A hke uncertainty prevailed as f° a \fi belbic bi mtso e ormer vilayets of Diarbekir and Mosul, and consequently the contentions that arose in is sec or an made agreement difficult were only to be anticipated. While the assignment of the “ Bee de Canard zone was still in suspense and the area was administered by Turkey, the boundaries in this sector were fixed by a ^aci a g n f t p e the Iraqi and Turkish authorities as follows: From the Tigris, a line f ^™^ he D 'X a s fir as Sufan Dere westward for about one mile, and thence the ridge o t e Qa c the Wadi Rumelan. * 1 .

On October 1st, 1925, General Sarrail, replying to a memorandum from the British Consul at Beirut, defined the de facto situation as follows: 3 “As is shown by the correspondence on the subject of the zone bounded on the east by the 1920 frontier and on the west by the line defined m Sir Henry Dobbss lette r No. 164a of January 31st, 1923, the mandatory Power in Syria has always declared that it recognised the de facto situation existing in the Sin jar prior to the signature of the London Agreement of December 23rd, 1920. It accordingly accepts the Bntis administration of that area, on condition that no permanent military estabhshmen such as might modify its temporary character shall be set up there (letter No. 2189/KD of April 22nd, 1925). Orders were accordingly given a year ago to the Syrian administra tion to entrust to the Iraqi authorities in the Sinjar the search for any malefactors who might take refuge in that territory.” The exact limits of the Sinjar proper gave rise, however, to differences of opinion. A dispute on this subject had already arisen in 1922, when the village of Khatuniya was occupied by a British post. This occupation led to a protest from General Gouraud to Sir Percy Cox, and the post was withdrawn. Again, in the summer of 1925, Syrian patrols having pushed as far as the same village, a correspondence ensued between Sir Henry Dobbs and General Sarrail, as the outcome of which Khatuniya was evacuated. When the Commission passed that way, it was able to ascertain that Khatuniya and the neighbouring village of El Hoi were free from any military or police forces. The village of El Hoi is under the Syrian administration, but no definite settlement seems to have been arrived at in regard to Khatuniya. It may be assumed, however, that the de facto frontier passes near the two villages. To the north and south of the Sinjar are desert areas frequented by nomad tribes dependent some on Syria and some on Iraq. By an agreement between the two parties, these tribes were to be supervised and parties using the tracks which serve this region were to be protected on either side of the presumed frontier of 1920 by the respective military authorities, who would also be entitled, after giving notice of their intention, to cross the boundary in order to get into touch with the tribes owing them allegiance. A more recent temporary arrangement 3 (March 24th, 1930) between Major Wilson, Admin istrative Inspector at Mosul, and Colonel Callais, Assistant Delegate of the High Commissioner of the French Republic at Deir-ez-Zor, fixed the boundary of the areas in which the two Govern ments were to provide for the administration of the Shammar tribes under their respective authorities and to collect the wedi tax. 1 Statement of the de facto situation resulting from the frontier relations be tween Syria and Iraq — High Commission of the French Republic in Syria and the Lebanon, Beirut, March 19th, 1932, page 21. 3 Ibid., page 23. 3 'Descriptive Memorandum on the Frontier between Syria and Iraq.” Beirut, February 18th, 1932, page 67.- 23 - This line was fixed as follows (from ± Tash, Samukha Pass, Um el Dibban, Tell MaJkab El R H Te L^ melan ' Wad i Rumelan Tell Aji] and the Wadi Tijarie, Tell Chebed cent rp ^ ^ i ea&gt; Mfalla g a &gt; confluence of the Wad eastern edge of the cliff west of the Barguth salt denosit!

This sector, which is absolute desert, is frequented only by nomad tribes at the times of their changes of pasture. Large sections of Syrian tribes, including the Aniza Fid’an, the Sba, and the Ruwalla, regularly cross the frontier of the 1920 Convention on their way to the Gaara region, in Iraq, where the pastures and wells attract large concourses of nomads at certain periods. Since 1920, the areas under the administration of the two States in these regions have been bounded by the de jure frontier, which is therefore also the de facto frontier. 2. Proposals of the Parties. 2 In a memorandum to the Council of the League of Nations, dated February 27th, 1932, * the British Government made proposals for the revision of the frontier as defined in the Convention of 1920. The French Government, on the other hand, in its memorandum dated February 29th, 1932, 4 made no specific proposals regarding the frontier-line. Observations made on the ground during the enquiry, however, led the French and Syrian assessors to suggest a specific frontier-line. The British and Iraqi assessors also indicated on the ground, on account of local conditions, certain modifications of the line described in the above- mentioned memorandum from the British Government dated February 27th, 1932. As we shall go exhaustively into the whole question in the chapters that follow, we need not comment at this point on the lines thus indicated by the parties. We need only refer the reader to the map (Annex No. 2), on which the frontier-lines proposed by the two parties and that suggested by the Commission are marked. CHAPTER V. INFORMATION AND MATERIAL COLLECTED. 1. Geographical Considerations.

A number of lateral tracks coming from the north of the Qara Ch ® k \^ hlch skirt western and eastern ends, join this great artery running from Mosul to Nisibm and Aleppo Some of these tracks such as that from Jeziret-ibn-OmartoHasseche, are practicable for cars and loirles. As for the Tigris, it cannot be regarded as a means of communication m the sector with which we are concerned. Although it carries a very considerable volume of water at all seasons, its shi tmg channel makes it unnavigable for boats of deep draught. In its present state it can only be use y rafts carrying materials. The track along the right bank also does not seem to be much frequented. We may conclude that the traffic in this part of the Tigris valley is small. The next sector consists of the wide plain that lies between the last hills of the mountainous region to the north and the chain of the Jebel Sinjar and its continuations. This region is charac terised by a very great number of hillocks scattered about irregularly and rising abruptly out of the almost level plain to a height of twenty or thirty metres or even more. One is tempted at first sight to regard these as faults due to volcanic action, but recent excavations have revealed, inside t ese tells, traces of human occupation which suggest that these eminences, with their typical comca shape, are nothing but superimposed remains of ancient dwellings. This desert region is situated on both sides of the watershed between the Tigris and the Kabur — which cannot be seen on the ground and is not marked on the map. Two watercourses serve as collectors for the numerous drainage-lines which descend from the hills in the north and from the Jebel Sinjar in the south; these are the Wadi el Murr, which flows into the Tigris, and the Wadi er Radd, which flows into the Kabur. There is water in these wadis only intermittently, however, because the annual rainfall here is already much smaller than in the Qara Chok region, and is barely enough to provide a meagre pasturage on this plain in winter and spring. Consequently, there are no dwellings; only a few nomad tribes and their flocks and herds come there from the Sinjar in the spring. Lines of communication are almost totally lacking. Apart from the motor-track from Demir Kapu to Hasseche, there are only a few caravan- tracks crossing this deserted area. Except during the rainy season, however, this arid steppe can easily be used for motor traffic, provided always that one knows the difficult passages. The Jebel Sinjar, whose steep slopes rise up out of the middle of this plain, is undoubtedly the most characteristic geographical feature of the whole frontier zone. It is probably a unique phenomenon in the world for a mountain chain of this size to rise so abruptly to a height of over 1,000 metres out of a flat plain. It can easily be understood that scientific expeditions have for a long time been attracted to this impressive mountain. The Jebel Sinjar proper is about fifty kilometres long, and its greatest width is a little less than twenty kilometres. It is continued westward by the Jebel Jeribe and the Jebel Chembe, and eastward by the Jebel Gaulat. This chain, which, taken as a whole, runs almost exactly east and west, extends approximately from the banks of the Kabur to those of the Tigris. It is doubtless the result of the formation of an immense fold in the sedimentary strata of Upper Mesopotamia. Parallel to its southern base runs a line of small hills, the remains of a small secondary fold, which is divided into sections by a series of lateral clefts. These clefts drain the waters of the longitudinal valleys lying between the main chain and the secondary fold. On the northern slope, similar but much deeper depressions have been produced by erosion. It is doubtless the numerous springs in the valleys on either side of the main chain that have attracted men to this isolated range from the remotest times and caused them to settle there. Throughout the year, they have enough water for their families, their flocks and herds, their mills, and the irrigation of extensive lands which afford valuable resources. This relative abundance of water, due to the fact that the rainfall is much greater in the Sinjar than in the surrounding plain, extends its beneficent effects to some distance from the mountains, so that grain can be cultivated. Beyond these agricultural regions begin the pasture- lands, which gradually fade off into the desert. The villages are naturally close to the springs. Most of them are therefore situated in the valleys described above, or at the mouths of these gorges.— 25 — There are also some, however, in the ^ welk - m ‘ ddle ° f the Mtmal area, but only where there are At the southern foot of the highest massif nf u • • inhabitants and the largest place in the district. 16 Cham 13 Beled Sin 3 ar &gt; a town of 4,000 The region of the Lake of Khatounive a k-h-u ^ mention.

Its monotony would be complete were it not for the important valley of the Wadi Ajij, with its numerous ramifications, and further south the “ salt-deposit ” depressions. The Wadi Ajij, which serves as a collector for all the waters that come down from the southern slope of the Sinjar between Beled Sinjar and the Samukha Pass, has cut its bed 100 metres deep in the plain. Doubtless it formerly flowed into the Euphrates above Albu Kemal, but in these days it loses itself in the Roda depression, where the highly permeable subsoil does not favour the formation of any deposits and there is therefore no trace of salt. As for the other “ salt deposits ”, all of which are fed by very small basins, only one, that of Buara, is properly entitled to the name; its impermeable subsoil prevents the infiltration of the water, which, being exposed only to evaporation, leaves after every rainy period a deposit of pure salt several centimetres thick. The other depressions in this region, which have been wrongly called salt deposits, contain only a mixture of salt and sand, which is quite unfit for use. The only resources of this desert area are the meagre pasturages which in winter and spring cover the bottom and the slopes of the Wadi Ajij; these barely provide subsistence for a few flocks and herds. In this immense region, which even the roads avoid, one would seek in vain for a single dwelling. The only track that crosses it — but a very important one — is that from Mosul to Deir-ez-Zor, by which the produce of Northern Iraq is sent to the markets of Aleppo and Europe; the other paths are used only by the rare caravans that cross this deserted region. The Euphrates valley, narrow as it is, forms an absolutely distinct section of the frontier zone; the existence of a great river creates conditions of life entirely different from those in the neigh bouring desert areas. The Euphrates drains the greater part of the very mountainous regions of Armenia and Kurdistan, and also receives, chiefly through the Kabur, a large proportion of the waters of Upper Mesopotamia. Since it is thus fed in summer by the melting of the snows and in winter by the rains of a tropical climate, its volume is relatively constant, and this reduces the risk of floo . Between the plateau of Mesopotamia and the Syrian desert, the Euphrates has cut itself a valley averaging some ten kilometres in width, the sides of which rise sometimes in a § er U e s °P e and sometimes in steep cliffs, according to the degree of resistance of the soil to erosion. ® very sinuous course of this river, which averages several hundred metres m width, a-vours e or of islands, some of which are quite large.

The semi-settled population as a rule inhabits villages or permanent groups of tents, which they leave in autumn or winter to seek pasture for their flocks in the steppes. They do not return until the spring to engage in agricultural work. Such are the Hassenan, of Kurdish race, who occupy villages on the Tigris from the Syro- Turkish frontier to the neighbourhood of Khanik and further west. The Alian, who are also Kurds, and whose villages are situated between the Lailak Dagh and the Wadi Jerrahi, come down in winter with their flocks to the neighbourhood of Demir Kapu. The Tai, an important Arab tribe, comprising about 2,000 families, are established on the banks of the Jaghjagh, a tributary of the Kabur, where they cultivate large areas of land. They are divided into numerous groups, one of which — that of the Duwalla — has remained predo minantly nomad and, in autumn, traverses the region of the Wadi Rumelan, sometimes descending as far as the Sinjar, and even crossing it to reach the pastures of the Wadi Ajij. The Juhaich, who are Arabs, possess about 450 houses in the neighbourhood of Tell Afar. They seek their pastures at very great distances, from the Wadi Sufan to the north as far as the salt deposits. The Sherabiyin, Arabs, with their affiliated groups, have about 1,000 tents, and are regarded as being of inferior race by the other tribes, which they often accompany as shepherds, particularly between the Kabur and the Tigris. Then we have the Jebburs, who are also Arabs, numbering about 3 &gt; 000 tents, and whose villages are on the banks of the Kabur. They spend the winter in the steppes which extend to the north and south of the Jebel Sinjar, sometimes mixing with the Yezidis. , Further to the south, on the two banks of the Euphrates, we find the semi-settled tribe ot the Ogueidat, owing allegiance to Syria. Their villages extend from a point situated forty kilo metres north of Deir-ez-Zor to below Albu Kemal. logether they number a ou 10,000 arm ies. Those whose villages are situated on the eastern bank of the Euphrates go m winter with their flocks to the region of the salt deposits, while the sections to the west of the Euphrates go t pasture in the Syrian desert as far as the Gaara. This tribe has for many y ears . , state of hostility with its neighbours, the Iraqi Dulem who cultivate ^ of the nveHro^ the neighbourhood of the Leachman boundary stone (eight kilome res ® , Dulem touch as Falluja.

The Yezidis have a strong religious organisation, but their dispersion m . dls ^ ri ^ ts at a distance from one another makes the authority of the supreme chief more nominal than real The Yezidi hierarchy comprises several degrees. A preponderating and unique position 15 en j Y bv the “Mir ” “Emir or “Beg ”, who is the supreme pontiff of all believers and a political and religious chief’with almost unlimited powers. Although elected by all the faithful, he must always belong to the same family. His pecuniary resources are derived from voluntary gifts from the community, collected during the tours, made in all places inhabited by Yezidis, by the banjaks a Turkish word meaning standard, applied to a sort of candelabrum surmounted by a bronze peacock. The “Sanjaks ”, of which the “Mir ” is the guardian, are sent out once a year among the faithful, who prostrate themselves before them and bring them offerings. Next to the “Mir ”, with a more specially religious character, is the“ Sheik ”, a sort of patriarch and chief of a superior priestly caste constituted by the members of the only five families descended from the disciples of Sheik Adi. Then come the “ Pir ”, priests of a lower category than the Sheik but also belonging to families whose origin is considered divine. The “fakirs may be compared to Christian monks, although they may marry and own property. They may be recognised by their costume, made entirely of black wool with the exception of trousers of white linen and cloaks of any colour except blue. The “fakirs ” are under the authority of a chief who lives in the neighbourhood of Aleppo. Of lower rank are the “kawal”, a kind of chorister, the “chawich”, who attend the tomb of Sheik Adi, and the“ferach ”, who acts as sacristan at the tomb. Outside the Jebel Sinjar and the district of Sheikhan there are several groups of Yezidis, the chief of which are those at Aleppo and Amuda, in Syria, in the Jebel Tor, in Turkey, and at Tiflis, in the Caucasus. There can be no doubt, however, that the Yezidis of the Sinjar, protected by the inaccessible approaches of their mountain, form at the present day the most homogeneous ethnical and religious group of this interesting race.

Modern means oUommunica'- tion have rendeied more frequent the contact of these nomads with the cultivated centres where conditions of life seem to them less difficult. Moreover, the growing depreciation in the value of the animals they breed, particularly camels and horses, is leading them to seek a more stable income Nevertheless, this passage from the nomad to the sedentary state will take a long time owing to the very slow evolution of these races, with their atavisms dating back thousands of years Hence it is clear, even if the possibilities of the future are taken into account, that the economic value of this district is, and will always remain, very small. Its meagre resources can only suffice in the most precarious conditions for a sparse population. The present chapter only contains a few figures, statistics or details concerning the production and trade of the regions under consideration, for sources of reliable information are rare. The data we were able to obtain on the spot are not really reliable, even when they were supplied to us in good faith. The nomad and the other peoples of the desert, who are still in a primitive stage of civilisation, too often replace accuracy by exaggeration or mistrust, according to whether they wish to give themselves importance or to evade taxation. The extreme ignorance of these men, and the fact that they are scattered over the vast spaces of the desert, made it impossible for the Commission to check their statements to any serious extent. In these circumstances, the figures contained in the official statistics are all the more inter esting. We therefore think it useful to reproduce in the first place the data concerning the total trade between Syria and Iraq which were communicated to us at our request by the two parties. 1 Document C.400.M.i47.i9 2 5-VH, page 49 -— 3 i — (c) Principal Goods exported and re-exported from Syria to Iraq IN 1931 .

Y ' d 1 g B. Jebel Stnjar Sector. — This region, whose other characteristics have been examined elsewhere, is the most important economic centre of the territories we have studied. Until quite recently, its inhabitants seem to have lived completely isolated on their mountain u kind of island m the midst of the desert — and to have had no relations with the outside world. Towards the second half of the last century, however, the Yezidis, having been obliged by force to submit to the authority of the Sublime Porte, which they had hitherto disregarded, and taking advantage of the growing state of security, extended their cultivation to an increasing extent in the plain on either side of the mountain. At present, the zone of cultivation extends in places to a width of as much as sixteen kilometres. The greater part of the population of the Sinjar is engaged in agriculture, which covers a considerable area. The farmer, however, works under extremely primitive conditions, and does not yet know how to avail himself of the spring water at his disposal. He has succeeded, however, in obtaining crops of some variety, and it maybe anticipated that, in a comparatively short space of time, the Jebel will not only be able to provide for its own needs, but become a very important centre of production. The present production of the Kaza of the Sinjar in cereals, according to the data supplied to us, amounts to only 20,000 or 25,000 tons’ These cereals are chiefly barley and sorghum, wheat being cultivated only to a small extent. This figure seems, however, high in relation to the population (about one ton per head); but when it is compared to the area sown it does not appear excessive. It may therefore be concluded that, in normal years, the cereal crop not only amply satisfies the needs of the population, but provides a large surplus for sale outside the Sinjar. In years of food shortage, on the other hand, the Yezidis supplement their crops by buying from all quarters. The Yezidis produce in their valleys an abundance of figs, of which they consume great quan tities and export the surplus. On the mountain they also cultivate the vine and eat fresh or dried grapes. They extract therefrom a thick syrup which constitutes one of their articles of food. They also eat vegetables, lentils, chick-peas, and rice, of which they produce a small quantity in marshy places. They plant a little tobacco for their own use as well as cotton of inferior quality (a few dozen tons). ... • • 1 Among the Yezidis, as in all the surrounding country, sheep-raising is the principal means of livelihood. The flocks go to pasture on the mountain or at the foot of its slopes, and on y eave it in winter and spring. They then go as far as the Radd, to the north, near the Lake of K a ouniya and Tell Sfug, and sometimes as far as El Bidea to the south. Their live-stock consists, according to the data we have been able to obtain, o 1 om , to 300,000 sheep and goats, the latter representing, however, only a proportion of 10 per ce All their flocks do not seem to be their own property, and they apparen y ac shepherds for others in return for payment in kind.

Their cultivations are however capable of greater development. ’ iuwevei &gt; C. Salt deposit Sector. — Apart from its value on account of its pastures, this region is also of considerable importance as a great reservoir of salt. As we have already seen, it is only the Buara depression that offers the advantages of a good salt deposit. While certain other depressions, such as those of Seba and Snesseleh, although having a much thinner and less pure layer of salt! seem to have been or to be still exploited to a certain extent, their importance is negligible compared with that of the Buara deposit. We therefore feel justified in confining ourselves to the examination of the latter. The Buara salt deposit, like that of Seba indeed, was subject at a certain period of the Ottoman Empire to a State monopoly established for the benefit of the Ottoman Public Debt. The purpose of this enterprise was no doubt less to make profits than to prevent the free exploitation of these salt deposits by the nomads, and thus eliminate competition with another salt deposit situated in the neighbourhood of Aleppo, and belonging to the State, which was being run at a loss. Ruined buildings on the borders of the Buara still bear witness to this official exploitation, which, as might be expected, showed considerable losses. When the Turkish regime came to an end, both Iraq and Syria claimed the right to use the Buara deposit. Syria, which at present exercises no control, permits the population to supply itself freely. Iraq, on the other hand, which has instituted a salt monopoly, has for several years leased to private persons its share of this salt deposit, while exempting the nomads from the legal tax. In the last two years, however, no lessee seems to have come forward. The use of the salt deposit has consequently been entirely left to the nomads on the Iraqi side. The annual exploitation of this salt deposit begins at the end of spring i.e., when the waters which covered it have evaporated — and terminates with the first rains of winter. e methods used are very simple. They consist in breaking the layer of salt and drying the pieces in the sun for a few hours: they are then placed in sacks, which are loaded on camels The quantities thus extracted seem to amount on the Syrian side to about 400 tons a year, which is sufficient for the needs of the Jezira and even part of Anatolia — i.e., about 200,000 persons. The annual production on the Iraqi side was estimated during the years of lea f ed ° ld a ^ 200 to 500 tons, a quantity sufficient for the needs of about a third o e popu a of Mosul. , It may therefore be said without exaggeration that the Buara salt deposit plays a part of considerable importance in the economic life of the two coun ries.

Military Considerations. (a) General Observations. we tneieioit: letu jusliiicu. m ^0,00.1.11.5 —r . , the Jebel Sinjar and the Jebel Tenf, and concentrating our attention on the northern sector A general geographical description of this region has been given already. It will be recalled that the region in question is composed, from north to south, first of a relatively hilly sector, then of a plain about fifty kilometres in breadth, studied with tells, and then of the very long rocky chain of the Jebel Sinjar, rising to a height of 1,000 metres above this plain. The northern sector is dominated at approximately its central point by the Qara ( hok Dagh. This chain is the prolongation of that of the Jebel Bikhair, situated on the eastern bank of the Tigris. One is therefore tempted to attach to these two groups, separated by the broad valley of the Tigris, an equal military importance on either bank of the river, as an obstacle to an attack coming from the north or south. A closer examination reveals, however, material differences. To the east of the Tigris, the precipitous and rocky chain of the Jebel Bikhair forms a very serious and uninterrupted natural obstacle, which would permit of easy defence. This is not the case as regards the Qara Chok chain, to the west of the Tigris. Although several of its summits bear the name Dagh (mountain), it has a much less mountainous character than the Jebel Bikhair, to the east of the Tigris; only the massif of the Qara Chok Dagh, which falls perpendicularly on the south east side, is practically unassailable, while the rest of the range is only a series of hills and plateaux which can be crossed almost anywhere. The massif of the Qara Chok Dagh, which is only about five kilometres long, can therefore be turned on the west and east. It thus constitutes less an obstacle than a good observation-point. On the other hand, it must be recognised that the chain of the Qara Chok Dagh possesses the natural advantages of a defensive zone offered by any region where the relief of the watershed is sufficiently pronounced. It is probable that anyone having to defend this region towards the north or south, apart from any political consideration, w r ould preferably base his defence on the chain of the Qara Chok. In the plain situated between this northern sector and the Jebel Sinjar, there is no zone or line offering special interest from the military point of view. The chain of the Jebel Sinjar, on the other hand, with its extensions, forms an extremely powerful natural defence system. Its complete isolation and its numerous valleys and ravines make it possible to conceal any movement of troops from the view of the enemy. Its excellent observation-points and the lack of any cover in the neighbouring region would greatly facilitate its defence. And even if an assailant gained a footing there, he would find it difficult to make any progress, for the ground lends itself admirably to guerrilla warfare. (c) Strategical Considerations. The frontiers fixed by the Syro-Turkish agreements or laid down by the 1920 Convention are not natural frontiers, except along a small part of the course of the Tigris. They take no account of geographical and still less of military considerations.

F 5. Political and Administrative Considerations. The Ottoman Empire was divided, from the administrative point of view, into vilayets, sandjaks, etc. In the sparsely-populated and arid zone with which we are dealing, the desert constitutes a natural division, bor this reason, the central administration, which was generally ignorant of the details of local conditions, had drawn a few rough lines on the map to mark the administrative boundaries across the desert. The nomad, however, who was the only inhabitant of these vast regions, was ignorant of the existence both of the administration and of the boundaries fixed by it. For centuries, since before the Hegira, he had but one law, that of the desert, and he never acknowledged any other. He had his social organisation, his policy of mutual assistance and alliances, and his mode of living, which nothing could change. The imperial authority had implicitly recognised itself to be incapable of exercising more than nominal dominion over this immense area. The Kurds, Turcomans and Circassians on the one hand and the Arabs on the other were, in practice, masters of their own existence. They were free to take their herds where they could find pasture, to attack ill-defended caravans, or to plunder a weaker tribe that refused to pay tribute. When, last century, the Sultans wished to enforce the collection of taxes in the desert and in Northern Mesopotamia, they established a network of police posts capable at least of protecting the lines of communication between the important centres. This system having given poor results, it was endeavoured to make the chiefs of the tribes themselves responsible for the supervision. But experience showed that, as long as the nature of the inhabitants was not changed by a new mode of living, any attempt to establish security and order m the desert was foredoomed to failure. Hence the nomads were encouraged to settle in the region of the Hgns Mong the Kabur an^ on the banks of the Euphrates. A school was even founded at Const^tmople to endeavo though without much success — to exercise a softening influence on e children of the Bedouin chiefs. . . , Nevertheless, as a result of this policy of settlement, a certain numher of villages were founded But for lack of effective protection they were obliged to have ^ true masters of the desert. Victims in turn of the enemies 0 . j-j we encountered themselves, these villages were soon destroyed, and the numerous rums which we encount on our journey still bear witness to those melanc 0 y imes. entrusted to the It was not until the application of th ® h S5 [ S Xpursued by the Ottoman Empire European Powers by the League of Natiom t c sacrifices.

CHAPTER VI. — CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS. i. Concerning the Frontier Zone as a Whole. Sc^&amp;^ct the re8U Chrmtic ^randitior^^in thesUregions vary to an extent which, is unkno™ in temperate climates — the rainfall in certain parts of Mesopotamia was only one-sixth of normal last winter and may oblige the nomads, as was the case this year, to prolong, shorten or change comp eey their usual itinerary. In these circumstances, we have acquired the conviction that it is p ct y impossible to draw a frontier which does not cut the route of migration of at least some of these tribes. The de facto frontier possesses the same drawbacks, which are an inevitable consequence of nomadism. The present system of migrations, however, will have to be safeguarded, and as few obstacles as possible placed in its way. , , ,, Both parties, to justify their claims to a particular locality, have repeatedly pleaded the absolute necessity of being able to use certain wells. , _ ^ j + T There can be no doubt that full use of a pasture cannot be made without a good water-supply We would point out, however, that the drilling and maintenance of the wells are at present left to the nomads. Each tribe, possessing only very rudimentary equipment, at present does no more than what is strictly necessary, and that in the most primitive way, to provide for its water- supply for a short period ahead. . We consider that the question of wells calls for the closest attention on the pait of the author ities, for we are convinced that, at small expense, the present system of wells could be improved and supplemented, and that, by thus enhancing the value of certain pastures, the resources of several tribes could be increased. We therefore consider that the present distribution of wells and springs should not be allowed to influence the position of the frontier. This distribution, which is capable of considerable improvement in the future, can then be adapted to any frontier. We suggest that the question of changes of pasture should be settled by special agreements between the States themselves. In this connection, it may be worth while to recall the instance of an Intergovernmental Commission which worked for years in the north of Scandinavia. 1 The proceedings of that Commission might provide a useful example in seeking a satisfactory per manent regulation of changes of pasture involving the crossing of a frontier. Its experience might furnish useful suggestions in spite of the difference between the conditions of life of the Laps and their reindeer and the Arabs and their flocks. This Commission solved the problem of nomadism in the countries of the north by means of conventions originating in a text named “First Codicil of the Frontier Convention of October 6th to i8th, 1751 ”, which is still in force to-day, and appears to have been founded on an agreement dating from 1658. The “Codicil ” and the Conventions of 1905 and 1919, which are based thereon, determine the rights and obligations of the nomads in time of peace and war; they stipulate, inter alia, that, according to custom, the nomads may cross the frontiers and make free use of the land and water-supply for themselves and their herds. 2. Concerning the Different Sectors. (a) Tigris-Jebel Sinjar Sector. — The uniformity of this sector from the geographical point of view is evident. There is here no natural line which could usefully serve as frontier. The Qara Chok chain itself is not suitable for this purpose, even irrespective of its oblique position in relation to the frontier. 1 On this subject, the Commission received a communication kindly sent by His Excellency M. Marks von Wiirtemberg, former Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs, and M. Lennart Berglof, Secretary of the Norwegian-Swedish Frontier Commission. It desires to express to them its sincere thanks.— 39 — The “Bee de Canard ” is inhabited hv a ^ j and religions.

P Y W ° Uld be m ° re mclmed to evacuate It will readily be understood that these unpromising military prospects dominate all political and administrative considerations. How could a Government be expected to take a whole-hearted interest in a district at such a distance from the centre of the country when it was sure to have to abandon it at the first approach of an enemy ? How could it in such circumstances justify ex penditure on its economic development and administrative equipment ? We consider that this unfavourable situation inherent in the unfortunate configuration of the “Bee de Canard ” must discourage any Government from undertaking a programme of development. To sum up, the district of the “ Bee de Canard”, which, owing to the richness of its soil, is capable of genuine development, cannot command the interest which it deserves in the eyes of a Government as long as its configuration does not enable that Government to provide for its security in all circumstances. We have no hesitation in stating that, in our opinion, only two solutions are possible: either to abolish the “Bee de Canard ” by assigning it to Iraq, or to enlarge it to the extent necessary for its continued existence. To abolish the “Bee de Canard ”, however, would be to cut off Syria from the Tigris, which was certainly not the intention of the negotiators of 1920. On the contrary, they expressly designated the Tigris as the frontier over a long distance, thus making plain their desire to give Syria free access to that river. It is not for us to enquire into the reasons which led the negotiators to take this decision. But there is nothing to prevent their intentions from being respected, by the exclu sion of any idea of abolishing the “Bee de Canard ”. We are thus led to suggest a considerable enlargement of the “ Bee de Canard , in order to eliminate its character of an almost undesirable “appendix”. It could then become a distiict of a certain importance, capable of developing more easily, and more readily defensible. We believe that, if it saw the importance of this distant region increased, the Syrian Government would certainly be inclined to take more interest in it and to give it a stimulus in every way. Thus corrected, the“Bec de Canard ” could play an important part as an instrument of peace: it would bar the natural route of access from the north of Iraq and thus ma e a.ny mi 1 ary ment in that direction much, less likely. If such a movement were direc e so e y aga . ’ would be confined to the eastern bank of the Tigris, which is very unfevourabie for such a purpose, or it would cross the “ Bee de Canard ”, thus violating Syrian tern ory &amp; t p e Iraqi and the Syrians; an enterprise of that kind would become the more hazardous the moic resisting capacity of the “ Bee de Canard were increased. . .

Marrades did not agree with the majority s suggestion 8 and drew ufa minority proposal which he sets forth in a note reproduced at the end of the present chapter. / r \ SaU-dei&gt;osit Sector. — The characteristic of this district from the geographical point of view is the aspect of an elongated trough presented by the valley of the Wad. Apj and th salt deposits. The depressions are more difficult to cross than the plateaux on either side to east d west, especially in winter, when they are flooded; and they therefore to some extent form a natural This region is totally devoid of permanent dwellings, and is only temporarily and partially occupied by nomads. . It derives its economic value exclusively from the pastures and the salt deposits of tfuara, utilised chiefly by the nomad tribes. To sum up this district is one of minor importance from every point of view. In order to take into due account the present conditions of exploitation of this area, we propose that the frontier should divide both the valley of the Wadi Ajij and the Buara salt deposit. To the south of the latter the general line of the depressions seems to us to be the natural boundary between the two countries- (d) Euphrates Valley Sector. — Here no line offers obvious geographical advantages as a frontier; but we think it necessary to take into account, on the one hand, the ethnographical conditions and, on the other hand, necessities of an economic nature. As stated in the chapter on population, this is the region of contact between the important tribes of the Dulem and the Ogueidat. Their villages seem to be intermingled, and inhabited also by other sections affiliated to one or other of the principal tribes. In this particular case, therefore, they seem to be rather a zone of contact than a line of contact. Furthermore, we consider that, in practice, there can be no question of drawing the frontier through Albu Kemal or in its immediate neighbourhood, as the 1920 Convention does, and that for economic reasons the frontier should be at some distance. Moreover, a frontier situated in the immediate approaches to the town would present serious drawbacks for both parties from the administrative and particularly from the Customs point of view. Albu Kemal, which is the chief town of a “kaza ”, and which is more and more asserting itself as the centre of this region, must be given the possibility of extending, and must be surrounded by a wide zone of arable land belonging to it. Taking these considerations into account, we suggest that the frontier should be fixed on the borders of the villages of Heri and Qseba, and should pass through the Leachman boundary-stone. This line coincides with the present de facto frontier, which seems to have proved equitable and practical. (e) Euphrates-Jebel Tenf Sector. — This region, owing to its arid nature and the fact that it is not permanently inhabited, is certainly the least important part of the frontier zone from the point of view of the present enquiry. The question of changes of pasture is the only one which comes into consideration. As we have already explained, it can be settled in practice only by means of special agreements. In these circumstances, we consider that the simplest boundary — i.e., a straight line — would be the best. This indeed is the solution which had already been provided for in the 1920 Convention. We consider, however, that account should be taken of the new situation created by the agreement of October 31st, 1931, which replaced the straight line starting from Albu Kemal in the direction of Imtan by a line, also straight, starting from Albu Kemal and proceeding to a point situated 3.2 kilometres to the north of Tell Romah. We theiefore suggest that the frontier should proceed from the Leachman boundary-stone in a straight line to a point situated 30 kilometres from the minaret of Albu Kemal, on the lineAlbu Kemal point 3.2 kilometres north of Tell T?nmin r the line m the direction of the point 3 2 kilometre^i?^' the fr °ntier would follow of this line with the frontier between Transjordan and Iran as far as the intersection tage of avoiding two changes of direction in a region equa^ devdd^ 3. Note submitted by M. Maeeades, Member of the Commission of Enquiry STATING HIS PROPOSAL REGARDING THE FRONTIER IN THE JEBEL SlNJAR SECTOR. ’ The undersigned member of the Commission regrets that he is obliged to differ from his colleagues as regards the appreciation of, and the inferences to be drain from the ecTomk information obtained m connection with the Jebel Sin jar. economic • ; rhc T° ( , 1 onv f ntlon ’ J hlcl b a rule, is so uncategorical, is nevertheless categorical on one point — the allocation of the whole of the Kabur basin to Syria. To justify a departure from a provision so definitely claimed by one side and accepted by the other in the courie of the nego tiations, there should, in my opinion, be a reason so convincing that legal considerations must be waived in face of an incontestable reality. It did not appear to me, however, that so grave a con clusion could be drawn from the economic facts of the case. The question of the Jebel Sinjar appears to the dissenting member in the following light from the economic point of view: We do not know what were the commercial relations of the Jebel under the Ottoman adminis tration. The latter kept no trade statistics of the different provinces of the empire among themselves. 1 It seems impossible to find authentic data of any real value dating from the period previous to the British occupation. In his two works, 2 Baron Oppenheim gives us no more than indications; he says that the Yezidis maintained particularly friendly relations with the Christians of Mosul, Mardin, and other towns of the north, and mentions the case of a caravan of Yezidis coming from Mardin, where they had obtained supplies for the winter. As regards the present economic relations of the Sinjar, I consider that our knowledge of them is only fragmentary and incomplete. As a rule, the witnesses I had occasion to hear proved very little by trying to prove too much. Our only serious source of information was the official figures, which we reproduce elsewhere. These figures establish in an imperfect manner the fact, which seems likely enough, that the Sinjar’s commercial relations with Mosul are more important than those with Syria. We have no information as to the trade carried on by the Sinjar with Deir-ez-Zor, Kamechlia, Raz-el-Ain and the nomad tribes; we do not know — although there is reason to regard it as very considerable the volume of transactions which take place without going through the Customs. One fact, however, remains established after the study of these statistics, taken in conjunction with the economic considerations outlined in the report: the produce of the Jebel Sinjar forms a very important part of Mosul’s exports to Syria, and the goods imported by Mosul from Syria include some of the most important purchased by the Sinjar. A an nnt The Sinjar’s commercial movement towards the east is easily explained. The Yezidis do engage in trade It is on the spot that they buy from and sell to the commissioners or agents of outside traders and the traders established in their own country. ^Tcleariy de facto frontier, a Customs line, and a strict passport sys em enjoys all the facilities he can desire for visiting ^ Jf “^atdTy 1 h oldest^^which’dates^ack^nly^fi^or six^years^arep^^ledmostly^by^Christians^rDm^he other side of the Turko-Sy rian frontier, the very region ^ iCy by accidental cir- The Jebel Sinjar seems to me to be attached economy conditions cumstances that should not be given too muc S . . , j n ^ 1C development of a people, for drawing a permanent frontier which is o P^-J ^ part 0 f an expensive and unnecessary In my opinion, Mosul only plays, m relation o | ’ q s heep and goats exported from that intermediary.

In my opinion, the only possible solution is one which, while respecting as far as possible the intentions of the negotiators, would safeguard the unity of this ethnical and religious gioup The northern slope of the Sinjar, according to the interpretation placed upon the Convention by the Commission in Chapter III of the present report, belongs to the Kabur basm, and conse quently must be allotted to Syria. On the other hand, although the Convention does not expressly mention it, the southern slope, which does not form part of that basm, should be allotted to raq. The majority of the Yezidi population, whose unity we aim at maintaining, lives on this southern slope. In these circumstances, it seems to me that the party assuming the administration and watching over the development of the majority of this population should have a preferential right to the administration of the whole. . . , ^ , , u , A This would mean, on the part of Syria, the renunciation of a right which that country holds under the Convention, but such a renunciation of a right must, like all such, be interpreted m a wholly restrictive sense. In other words, it must not extend beyond what is indispensable for the maintenance of the unity of the Yezidi population, while at the same time taking due account of the requirements of a good frontier. In my opinion, the line that would best satisfy these conditions would be a line starting from Tell Sfug, proceeding in a straight line to Tell Yussuf Beg, thence entering the defile giving access to the pass named Bab-ech-Chilu on the map, thence through that pass to point 562, and thence in a straight line to Tell Rhuli, where it would rejoin the line proposed by the majority. This line would have the advantage of separating from the Yezidi group no more than the few houses of Jafar, a village which, according to the particulars given by the British and Iraqi assessors, has only seventy-five inhabitants. Arrangements would then have to be made for the transfer of these to the other side of the frontier, and agreements would have to be concluded between the parties establishing the system of pasturages, as the Commission has suggested elsewhere. {Signed) Pedro Marrades. CHAPTER VII. — DESCRIPTION OF THE SUGGESTED FRONTIER. (See Annexes Nos. 2, 3a and 36.) The Commission of Enquiry has been asked by the Council of the League of Nations to make suggestions such as may assist it in arriving at a decision. These suggestions in their main outlines are stated in Chapter VI. Nevertheless, the very careful examination of local conditions which we undertook has induced us to give definite form to our conclusions by indicating a specific line which, in our opinion, might form both an equitable and a practical frontier. This line, the course of which we describe below, is reproduced in detail in Annexes Nos. 2 (map 1: 500,000) and 3a and 36 (maps 1: 200,000). It is composed — except where the frontier follows the course of a river — of a series of straight lines connecting points which are clearly defined both on the map and on the ground. These points should constitute the fixed points of the frontier. The actual line between these fixed points should, however, be determined on the spot by a delimitation commission in accordance with local necessities. This latter remark applies more particularly to the long straight line from the Tigris to the north of the Sinjar. The absence, in this sector, of any indication of trigonometrical points on the maps — even the most recent ones — seems to show that some inaccuracies may exist in the latter. Accordingly we have thought it preferable not to define more closely our pro posals in this region. The line suggested is the following: 1. Tigris-Sinjar Sector. From the confluence of the Eastern Kabur and the Tigris, the thalweg of the Tigris to about one kilometre below Pesh Kabur; thence a straight line to Tell Dahraya (point 384) * thence a straight line as far as Tell Khoda-ed-Deir (point 391). 2. Sinjar Sector. (a) Majority Proposal ~~ From Tell Khoda-ed-Deir (point 391), a straight line to Tell Rhuli (trigonometrical point 402): thence to trig. pt. 645; thence to trig. pt. 573; thence to trig. pt. 395, and terminating at Tell Sfug (trig. pt. 332). r 0/0 s F oym25-32 LEAGUE OF NATIONS 0 REPORT OF THE COMMISSION SET UP BY THE COUNCIL TO EXAMINE THE FRONTIER BETWEEN IRAQ AND SYRIA.

The protocol of the agreement between the twi Governments which had been circulated three or four days ago 4,/Xpi.ainen in great detail the line of the new frontier* He was sure that this line was excellent, but as a matter of fact, no reason was adduced to demonstrate it. Ho doubt the Council, on the Mandates commission'*s advice, would have no difficulty in approving this agreement and declaring it to be genuinely in the interests of the two territories under mandate* But the Council ■ would be taking a great responsibility in deciding on this point ] without consulting the technical advisory organ which had been created on purpose to help the Council to take decisions on questions concerning mandates, fie- therefore asked whether this | procedure, which in his opinion should be the general rule, shout not also be applied in the present case. . I He was far from wishing to create difficulties for the two t mandatory powers or to delay the application of certain measures _ which were in the interest of the two populations, fie wished, however, as a Member of the council to give expression to h:.s doubts. Lord CECIL felt great sympathy towards the general point r f view expressed by the representative of Italy and wotua illingly have placed any available information et his — w hoi0 47 n n haa he ashed for it- He desired to remind the Italian representative of certain, facts* This was not the first occasion on which the matter had been before the Council* In December last the Council decided in principle that it was desirable to fix the frontier between the two territories. The Mandates Commission held the same view? and for about ten years had addressed urgent appeals to the British and French Governments to settle the matter in view of the obvious disadvantages of an undefined frontier. After lengthy negotiations, the matter was settled, and the British representative notified the Mandates Commission, which could have examined the whole question had it bo desired* From their knowledge of the locality? however and perhaps from their confidence in the Parties - they appeared to think it unnecessary to make a further examination* It might have been wiser had the British representative asked them to do so, but he could hardly be blamed for ^caving the Mandates commission to take the initiative, Lora 063 il did not. claim that this was a complete answer., but thought it mitigated the oircumctances.

The frontier between the two districts had been constantly discussed in the Mandates Commission for ten years; in October the British representative, who had with him ail the re...evativ u.e^us, informed the Mandates Commission that the frontier had been fixed.

The information communicated by the two mandatory Powers* 1 shows that certain difficulties were encountered in carrying out the provisions of Article I of the Convention signed by them on December 23rd, 1920, 2 as regards the Syria-Iraq. section of the frontier. ' In ■ ^Document 0. 843.1901.VI. “Article Is ’’The boundaries between the territories under the French mandate of Syria and the Lebanon, on the one hand, and the British mandates of Mesopotamia and Palestine, on the other, are determined as followss rt 0n the east, the Tigris from Jeziret-ibn-Omar to the boundaries of the formc^r vilayets of Diarbekir and Mosul.

Deraa and its environs will remain in the territory under the French mandate; the frontier will, in principle, leave the valley of the Yarmuk in the territory under the ire-neh mandate, but will be drawn as close as possible to the railway in such a manner as to allow the construction in the valley of the Yarmuk of a railway entirely situated in su!h B a i 1 kann e ? a al a is • alf ow^llI h 6f Cwo^Sg^iontrlcilng 1 Parties to construct and establish a harbour and raiiv-cv • ^ “ giving free access to the Lake of Tiberias. 'On the west M'In the first place, divergencies of opinion exist aa to the exact Interpretation of the frontier which Article I of the Convention was intended to define. Secondly, it was found that whatever Interpretation was placed upon Article I of the Convention, a frontier drawn in strict conformity therewith would be likely to he unsatisfactory in certain sectors for military, political, administrative, tribal, economic, geographical or other reasons. H l s he British and French Governments consider that it is not within the competence of a Delimitation Commission such as that referred to in Article 2 X of the Convention to modify the frontier defined in Article I to an extent sufficient in the Byrd a-* I ray, section of the frontier to remove the unsatisfactory features above mentioned. 'fhe Article 2i * } A commission shall be established within three months from the signature of the present Convention to trace on the spot the boundary-line laid down in Article I between the French and British mandatory territories. This commission shall be composed of four members. Two of these members shall be nominated by the British and French Governments respectively, the two others shall be nominated, with the consent of the mandatory Power, by th© local Governments concerned in the French and British mandatory territories respectively. ”Xn case any dispute should arise in connection with the work of the commission, the question shall be referred to the Council of the League of Nations, whose decision shall be final* ’’The final reports by the commission shall give the definite description of the boundary as it has been actually demarcated on the ground; the necessary maps shall be annexed thereto and signed by the commission.

Since by a coincidence the present President of the Council is the representative of one of the parties concerned, I think ay colleagues will agree with me that, in accordance with the Council’sCouncil's usual procedure, my predecessor, the Spanish representative, should he asked to undertake this particular duty# In taking this decision, the Council will simply he following the procedure observed in minorities questions, when, if the President in Office belongs to a country interested in a uiiestion und^r examination, he delegates his power to deal with it to his predecessor in office* The ; resident 1 s proposal was adopted.

IN the month of November 1931 Elis Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of the French Republic addressed to the Council of the League of Nations a joint request relating to the settlement of the question of the frontier between Iraq and Transjordan, on the one hand, and Syria and the Jebel Druse, on the other. i • 2. In that communication the two Governments explained the difficulties which had prevented them from carrying out the delimitation of the frontiei defined by the Franco-British Convention of the 23rd December, 1920, and requested the Council of the League to decide the question so far as the section of the frontier between Iraq and Syria was concerned. As regards the section between Transjordan, on the one hand, and Syria and the Jebel Diuse, on the other, the two Governments explained that they had succeeded in arriving at a solution of the problems which had confronted them, and had agreed, subject to the approval of the Council of the League of Nations, upon a line which could be delimited upon the ground by a commission such as is contemprate y article 2 of the aforementioned Franco-British Convention j ^ t u i 3. This revised frontier line between Transjordan and Syria and the J eb 6 Druse has been embodied in a protocol signed by His Britannic Majesty s Hig Commissioner for Iraq and the High Commissioner of the French Republic m Syria and the Lebanon on the 31st October last. There is attached to the protoco an annex laying down the main lines of an agreement to be concluded subsequen y for the regulation of frontier relations.

I .—Definition of the Frontier. Yarmuk Sector. (a) FROM the point where the railway crosses the Yarmuk above El Hamme as far as the point where the railway crosses the river above El M’Khebi, the frontier follows the thalweg of the Y armuk, it being understood that the section of the railway situated between these two bridges, and lying to the east of the Yarmuk, shall be accorded, in favour of Syria, the same exterritorial regime as was provided for, in the case of the section of the railway already delimited as far as the station of Semakh, by the Delimitation Agreement of the 3rd February, 1922 (which fixes the last point delimited). (b) From the above-mentioned point above El M’Khebi up to the point where the railway crosses the Wadi Meidan in the direction of Mezerib for the last time, the frontier runs on the Transjordan side of the railway at a distance fixed, where these rivers flow on the south side of the railway, by the thalweg of the Yarmuk and of its tributaries, the Wadi Zeizun and the Wadi Meidan, and where the railway runs on the Transjordan side to the south of these rivers, by the railway itself. In the latter case, the frontier shall be established to the south of the railway and parallel to it in such a way as to leave to Syria, besides the railway itself, its structures and grounds, its borrow-pits, its stations, its yards and outbuildings, and the area necessary both for the technical protection of the railway and its works and for its operation. This definition of the railway also applies to the section of the railway mentioned in paragraph {a) above. (c) Nothing in the preceding definition of the frontier shall have the effect of modifying the water regime relative to the Yarmuk and its tributaries, as provided for in article 8 of the Franco-British Convention of the 23rd December. 1920. 2. Deraa-Remthe Sector. Irom the point defined above, where the railway crosses the Wadi Meidan, as far as the point where the frontier meets the railway to the south of Nasib, the frontier is defined by the following marks and cairns :— From the bridge on the Wadi Meidan, the frontier rejoins the line which separates the lands of the Transjordan villages of Amrawa, Shejera, Turrah and Remthe, on the one hand, from the lands of the Syrian villages of Tel Shehab, Mezerib, and Deraa, on the other. This line passes through El Bueib on the road from Deraa to Remthe, and thence follows the western crest of the Jebel-ez-Zumla as far as the cairn situated at the southern extremity of the line separating the lands of Deraa from those of Remthe. Irom the latter cairn the frontier runs to the cairn situated approximately 1,500 metres to the south of the farm of Rahaya; thence it passes to the cairn of Kabr Hamdan, and continues towards the cairn situated at Kerkur Sud, and thence rejoins the railway at a, point situated between the Syrian village of (9 Not reproduced.a -y - to leave to each It is understood that when the frontier, in this second sector, follows a water course or wadi, the thalweg is meant, and when the frontier fo lows a crest the water parting is meant. me , .tpjfip i ' l ( !'p er understood that whatever the actual line of the frontier the inhabitants of Turrah shall continue to have access as heretofore to the wato points m the Wadi Meidan situated to the east of Jisr Meidan. 3. Sector to the east of Nasib and Jabir. From the point above mentioned, between Nasib and Jabir, to the point where it meets with the frontier between Transjordan and Iraq, in the neigh- bourhood of Jebel Tenf, the frontier is defined as follows : — M from the above-denned point on the railway, the frontier rejoins the point of intersection ol the meridian of Semma with the line defined hereafter. Between the meridian of Semma and the meridian of Tell Rumah it passes to the north of a line running through the following points : Semma, Umm-es-Surab, Shajara (a place approximately 2 kilom. south-west of the solitary tree on the track from Umm-el-Jemal to Tissiye, Subhiya, Sabha Umm-el-Kuttein, Deir-el-I\ahf (or Deir-el-Kaht) and Tell Rumah, these points being situated m Transjordan. The frontier shall be indicated by boundary marks placed 3,200 metres ' (say, 2 miles) to the north of and parallel to the lines which join the centres of the places or localities mentioned above. It is understood that if the village of Khirbet Awad or any part of that village is found to lie to the south of the frontier line as marked out above, the frontier shall be deflected around and to a point situated 60 metres to the south of the last group of houses at present existing, rejoining the main line to the east and to the west of the village by lines forming an angle of approximately 90 degrees at the point above mentioned (60 metres to the south of the village), in such a manner as to include in the territory of the Jebel Druse all the inhabited part of this village as well as the land situated within this salient from the main line. (b) From the point situated 3,200 metres north and on the meridian of the highest point of Tell Rumah to the frontier of Iraq in the neighbourhood of Jebel Tenf, the frontier shall run in a straight line in the direction of Abu Kemal on the Euphrates, the geographical position of this village being calculated, for the special purpose of establishing this line, by reckoning the central point of the locality. II .—Agreement on Frontier Relations and “ Bon-VoisinageF An agreement on frontier relations and £t bon-voisinage,” of which the essential points are indicated hereafter, and which shall enter into force at the same time as the present agreement, shall lay down the reciprocal guarantees of security in the interests of the two States and shall assure the safeguarding of the rights of the inhabitants of the frontier zone.

Campbell to Sir John Simon.—(Received November 12 .) (No. 1190.) ^ ncguLiciLiuiib vvt;re lo oe conducted m two stages, the first between the two High Commissioners alone, and the second between the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and His Majesty’s Embassy, the two High Commissioners being present. In point of fact, Sir Francis Humphrys was successful m reaching complete agreement with M. Ponsot and the intervention of the Ministry and the Embassy was only required on the last day of the proceedings, for the purpose of assisting in putting the documents into nnal shape and m drafting the notes to be exchanged between M. Briand and His Majesty’s Ambassador recording the agreement and making it binding on the two Governments. The originals of the two French notes and certified conies oi Lord T^riell s two notes, togetner with copies of the other documents referred to m Sir Francis Humphrys’s report, are enclosed herein. ^ 3. It is unnecessary for me to describe or explain these documents, or otoerwise to add to Sir Francis’s succinct and comprehensive account of the proceedings, beyond remarking that the negotiations^ were much more difficult than might have been anticipated. The reason for this was two-fold : In the first place, the Jebel Druze, being under a separate (military) Governor, largely independent of Beirut, M. Ponsot’s own position was a delicate one in agreeing to any line involving a withdrawal of French military posts from the positions at present occupied. On the other hand, it was precisely on this section of the frontier that Sir Francis Humphrys’s instructions compelled him to be less accommodating than elsewhere. In the second place, M. Briand’s personal position is at present so weak that he dare not agree to anything which might be represented, whether correctly or incorrectly, as a sacrifice of French interests, and thus expose himself to attack in Parliament. The Ministry was consequently reluctant to agree, of its own volition, to any line involving a retirement, though it would probably have contemplated with equanimity a less favourable one imposed as a result of a reference to the League of Nations. Indeed, the most difficult part of M. Ponsot’s task w r as probably that of persuading M. Berthelot and the General Staff, with wffiom he was in constant contact, of the justice and reasonableness of Sir Francis Humphrys’s contentions. I. The above factors combined to make M. Ponsot less easy to deal with than he might otherwise have been, and I know that I am voicing Lord Tyrrell’s opinion in saying that it was due to Sir Francis Humphrys’s tact and skill in negotiation that a satisfactory agreement was finally reached. I have, &amp;c. R H. CAMPBELL2 Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Second Report by Sir F. Humphrys on his Fegotiations in Paris regarding the Syrian Frontier. Sir F. Humphrys to Mr. J. H. Thomas.—(Communicated to Foreign Office, November 9.) Geneva, November 5, 1931. ’ IN continuation of my report dated the 23rd October, 1931, I have the honour to inform you that I returned to Paris on the 29th October in order to resume my negotiations with M. Ponsot regarding the Syrian frontier. On the morning of my departure from London I received my final instructions contained in Mr. Parkinson’s letter of the 29th October. Since it was necessary that I should leave Paris on the night of the 31st in order to arrive at Geneva in time for my examination before the Permanent Mandates Commission, which was due to commence on the morning of the 2nd November, there remained only two days in which to complete my negotiations in Paris. 2 . The whole of the first day was occupied in a recapitulation by M. Ponsot of his arguments in favour of obtaining a more favourable line for Syria in the valley of the Yarmuk and the Nasib-Imtan (or key-point) sector than I was pre- - pared to concede, and in my replies to the observations of his Government, which he had been instructed to convey to me in regard to these two sectors. Briefly, M. Ponsot’s standpoint was as follows :— (1) In the Yarmuk Valley the 1920 convention line should be followed, except where the railway lies to the north of the Yarmuk River, in which case the river should be the boundary, i.e., alternative B, described in paragraph 28 of my report dated the 23rd October. M. Ponsot was not even prepared to accept the thalweg of the main stream on the sections where the river was to be the boundary, but asked for the whole river to be included in Syria. ( 2 ) In the key-point sector he said that the French Government was unable to accept a rigid application of the 2 -mile line to the north of the line joining the key-points, but demanded that the Franco-British Com mission which would be entrusted with the delimitation of the boundary, should be given authority to vary this line in favour of Syria, so as to include within the Syrian boundary all cultivated lands appertaining to Syrian and Jebel Druze villages.’ 1 , i a ^ ards v ' 5 ^ reminded M. Ponsot that I had told him from the first tiiac the Zr-mile zone in iront of the key-point line was the minimum demand of ni} Government, and that, as this claim rested on a strategic principle, which t iroughout oui conversations I had warned him could not be surrendered, I was unable to give way on this point. I appealed to him to take a reasonable view. ; i an sta g e m our negotiations I had insisted that no account could be taken of the cultivated lands within the 2-mile zone, except by means of a “ Bon- V oismage agreement Such an agreement as I had in mind would dispose of a us administrative difficulties, and at the same time provide a minimum safe guard for the protection of the oil pipe-line and railway, which was considered to be a vital interest by my Government. M. Ponsot admitted that my arguments were strong and convincingly put, but he suggested that I should put them before f/fF on the fo pmng day. He had personally been unable to induce M Berthelot to accept the British standpoint in this sector. 3 re Sards the Yannuk Valley, M. Ponsot said that he had been taken to Mop Of fib v Ultai , y ailt horities in Paris for not insisting that the southern crest tW 1 Y i'J g ° rg&lt; ; fm ? be considered as the frontier. He hoped, there- T s'lid Hint * dccop his alternative B, beyond which he was unable to go. tW m m ^ 0 “ e - sldeda ' 1 * * * arrangement for my Government to accept and bomidnk kbiblTf 1 b’ ' hlcl V makes the thalweg of the main stream the river Vl’ a mrwiflo dY 6 ’ nto y allt y to the railway when running south of the M p’onsot said il..o i-i ''V™' V Government to be the best and simplest solution.

I still held to that declaration, but I felt sure moo a satisfy M.

Berthelot not to disappoint the first mission sent to Paris Jhi 6 neW .t * 8 * 1 Government in its endeavours to arrive at a fair and amicable ement with France on a long-standing difficulty. After Mr. Campbell and • amt-Cuentin had joined in the discussion, M. Berthelot invited us to explore uie possibilities of settlement in M. Saint-Quentin’s office. of th f ^^fyiog period of the morning was spent in redrafting the definition V ron t le r to include the amendments which had been accepted, and M. Ponsot greed to omit the phrase “ en ce qui concerne specialement le sud du Djebel ruse, which he had inserted in the revised Beirut formula (Annex B). He empted to alter the phrase c£ modifiee pour tenir compte ” in the penultimate P ragraph of the formula, but finally agreed to leave the wording as it stood. u • After lunch, while I discussed with M. Ponsot the general lines of an ccord frontalier ” and cc Bon-Voisinage,” Mr. Campbell and M. Saint-Quentin ^ r e engaged in the drafting of an exchange of notes between Lord Tyrrell and if w ri if nd would give formal sanction to the informal agreement, which as noped might be reached between M.

Ponsot under instructions no doubt from M. Berthelot, was still unable to accept my definition of the key-point sector In order to allay French suspicions about possible Transjordan activities in the 2-mile zone, the draft of a letter marked “ Confidential and not intended for publication was prepared, with the assistance of Mr. Campbell and M. Saint-Quentin, to be addressed by Lord Tyrrell ^ p Tllls ^ ett ® contains two points : (1) A self-denying ordinance on behalf of both Governments to abstain from favouring the establishment of new villages within the 2 -mile zone so long as both Governments are responsible for maintenance o± order on their respective sides of the frontier; and ( 2 ) a concession providing that all taxes payable on landed property belonging to Syrian and Jebel Druze villagers within the 2-mile zone shall continue to be paid, as heretofore, to the Synan Government. Although full credit was taken for these two concessions to French sentinient, I submit that-both are equally in the interests of Transjordan and His Majesty’s Government. It is obvious that the establishment of new villages in the 2-mile zone would be embarrassing to both sides. It would also be inconvenient for the Transjordan Government to collect the taxes due from Syrian and Jebel Druze nationals for the exiguous produce of the cultivated area in the 2 -mile zone. This view was accepted by Lord Tyrrell, who signed the letter (Enclosure 4) to M. Briand. 9. The French objections to the British draft for the key-point sector were now overcome, after I had made a small but reasonable concession in respect of Awad village. This provides that the frontier will deviate from the 2-mile line up to a point 60 metres to the south and encircling the last group of houses actually existing to the south, and will include the land embraced by an angle of about 90 degrees (45 degrees on either side) from this point (60 metres south of the village). This concession, which, I think, requires no justification, is rendered more reasonable by the fact that two roads approaching the village of Awad from the Jebel Druze villages to the north-west and north-east are shown on the French map as forming together an angle of about 90 degrees from a point drawn slightly to the south of the village. 10. We were now able to complete the revised definition of the frontier, which is described in the exchange of notes as Annex A. Paragraph 5 of this protocol refers to the maps which were utilised during the course of the negotiations. It is stated that the lines drawn on these maps are only approximate, but the indications inscribed in ink (by myself) on the maps of the Yarmuk Valley are to be regarded as authoritative. A copy of the latter map and the indications which I left with M. Ponsot is attached under separate cover.f) These indications merely show the easternmost and westernmost points of delimitation in the Yarmuk Valley, the course of the Wadi Zeizun, and the points of junction between the Wadi Zeizun and the Yarmuk River and the Wadi Meidan with the Wadi Zeizun. 11. The results of our negotiations were now typed out and signed at 8-30 p.m., little more than an hour before my train was due to leave for Geneva. There was no time to type and sign the English texts of Annexes A and B and of the general principles of the “Accord frontalier et Bon-Voisinage,” which will be deposited with the Quai d’Orsay later, and are to have equal validity with the French texts. The negotiations were carried through with the greatest friendliness and cordiality, and I hope it will be found that the point of view of both parties 0) Not reproduced.has been met without sacrificing any of the interests of Transiordan or His Majesty s Government.

As a result of their researches, Sir Francis Humphrys and M. Ponsot have in concert made certain recommendations which are known to your Excellency. 2 . I have tlm honour to inform your Excellency that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom accept the recommendations of the two High Commissioners and agree with the Government of the French Republic to adopt the following procedure with a view to the final settlement of this question :— The boundary between Transjordan and Syria and the Jebel Druze, as defined in the protocol which forms Annex A to this note, will be referred to’ the Council of the League of Nations for approval. When such approval has been given, the boundary will be demarcated on the spot, in accordance with the above-mentioned definition, by a commission such as is contemplated in article 2 of the Franco-British Convention of the 23rd December, 1920. The settlement of the boundary between Iraq and Syria Avill be entrusted to the Council of the League of Nations, in accordance with the terms of the draft reference which forms Annex B to this note. I have, &amp;c. TYRRELL. Annex A. Protocol relative to the Settlement of the Frontier between Syria and the Jebel Braze on the one side and Transjordan on the other side. I.—Definition of the Frontier. 1. Yarmuk Sector. {a) From the point where the railway crosses the Yarmuk above El Hamme as far as the point where the railway crosses the river above El M’Khebi, the frontier follows the thalweg of the Yarmuk, it being understood that the section of the railway situated between these two bridges, and lying to the east of the Yarmuk, shall be accorded, in favour of Syria, the same exterritorial regime as was provided for, in the case of the section of the railway already delimited as far as the station of Semakh, by the Delimitation Agreement of the 3rd February, 1922 (which fixes the last point delimited). (b) From the above-mentioned point above El M’Khebi up to the point where the railway crosses the Wadi Meidan in the direction of Mezerib for the last time, the frontier runs on the Transjordan side of the railway at a distance fixed, where these rivers flow on the south side of the railway, by the thalweg of the Yarmuk and of its tributaries, the Wadi Zeizun and the Wadi Meidan, and where the railway runs on the Transjordan side to the south of these rivers, by the railway itself) In the latter case the frontier shall be established to the south of the railway and parallel to it in such a way as to leave to Syria, besides the railway itself, itsstructures and grounds, its borrow-pits, its stations, its yards and outbuildings,, and the area necessary both for the technical protection of the railway and its works and for its operation. This definition of the railw also applies to the section of the railway mentioned in paragraph (a) above. , (c) Nothing in the preceding definition of the frontier shall Jrave the enect oi modifying the water regime relative to the Yarmuk and its tributaries, ay*- provided for in article 8 of the Franco-British Convention of the 23rd December,, 1920. 2. Deraa-Remthe Sector. From the point defined above, where the railway crosses the Wadi Meidan, as- far as the point where the frontier meets the railway to the south of Nasib, the frontier is defined by the following marks and cairns : — From the bridge on the Wadi Meidan, the frontier rejoins the line which separates the lands of the Transjordan villages of Amrawa, Shejera, Turrah and Demthe, on the one hand, from the lands of the Syrian villages of Te] Shehab, Mezerib, and Deraa on the other. This line passes through El Bueib on the road from Deraa to Bern the, and thence follows the western crest of the Jebel-ez-Zumla as far as the cairn situated at the southern extremity of the line separating the lands of Deraa from those of Remthe. From the latter cairn the frontier runs to the cairn situated approximately 1,500 metres to the south of the farm of Rahaya; thence, it passes to the cairn of Kabr Hamdan, and continues towards the cairn situated at Kerkur Sud, and thence rejoins the railway at a point situated between the Syrian village of Nasib and the Transjordan village of Jabir, in such a way as to leave to each of these villages the lands which belong to them. It is understood that when the frontier, in this second sector, follows a watercourse or Wadi, the thalweg is meant, and when the frontier follows a crest, the water parting is meant. It shall be further understood that whatever the actual line of the frontier, the inhabitants of Turrah shall continue to have access as heretofore to the water points in the Wadi Meidan situated to the east of Jisr Meidan. 3. Sector to the East of Nasib and Jabir. From the point above mentioned, between Nasib and Jabir, to the point where it meets with the frontier between Transjordan and Iraq, in the neighbourhood of Jebel Tenf, the frontier is defined as follows : — (a) From the above-defined point on the railway, the frontier rejoins the point of intersection of the meridian of Semma with the line defined hereafter. Between the meridian of Semma and the meridian of Tell Rumah it passes to the north of a line running through the following points :— Semma, Umm-es-Surab, Shajara (a place approximately 2 kilometres south-west of the solitary tree on the track from Umm-el-Jemal to Tissiye, Subhiya, Sabha, Umm-el-Kuttein, Deir-el-Kahf (or Deir-el-Kaht) and Tell Rumah, these points being situated in Transjordan. The frontier shall be indicated by boundary marks placed 3,200 metres (say, 2 miles) to the north of and parallel to the lines which join the centres of the places or localities mentioned above. It is understood that if the village of Khirbet A wad or any part of that village is found to lie to the south of the frontier line as marked'out above, the frontier shall be deflected around and to a point situated 60 metres to the south of the last group of houses at present existing, rejoining the main line to the east and to the west of the village by lines forming an angle of approximately 90 degrees at the point above mentioned (60 metres to the south of the village), in such a manner as to include in the territory of the Jebel Druze all the inhabited part of this village as well as the land situated within this salient from the main line. (b) From the point situated 3,200 metres north and on the meridian of the highest point of Tell Rumah to the frontier of Iraq in the neighbourhood of Jebel Tenf, the frontier shall run in a straight line in the direction of Abu Kemal onthe Euphrates, the geographical position of this villao'e special purpose of establishing this line by reckoning locality. b being calculated, for the the central point of the II.— Agreement on Frontier Relations and Eon-Voisinage. &gt; An agreement on frontier relations and “ bon-voisinage,” of which the essential points are indicated hereafter, and which shall enter into force at the same time as the present agreement, shall lay down the reciprocal guarantees of security in the interests of the two States and shall assure the saffguarding of the rights of the inhabitants of the frontier zone. b ^ f mg ot III. —Maps. The following maps, which have been utilised in the course of the nego tiations, are annexed to the present agreement for the purposes of explanation On the French side : — 1.

On the other hand, the indications shown in ink on the maps of the Yarmuk Valley are intended to support the agreed text, in particular in so far as concerns the course of the Wadi Zeizun and the Wadi Meidan. Paris, October 31, 1931. H. PONSOT. F. H. HUMPHRYS. Sub-Annex to Annex A. General Lines of the Agreement on Frontier Relations and “ Bon-YoisinageF A SEPARATE agreement will be concluded as soon as possible, to regulate relations on the frontier between Syria and the Jebel Druze on the one side, and Transjordan on the other side, in such a way as to allow non-nomadic, semi- nomadic and nomadic inhabitants having properties or rights of pasture, watering or cultivation across the frontier, to continue to enjoy their rights. Such inhabitants shall be able, within the limits of a frontier zone on either side of the frontier of a width to be defined hereafter, to convey from one side or the frontier to the other their beasts, the natural increase and produce of their flocks, agricultural implements intended for their work, their vehicles, their seeds, and the agricultural produce of their properties, without having to pay any dues m respect of customs, pasturage or watering, or any other tax leviable in respect of entry into the neighbouring territory. The agreement contemplated will furthermore contain provisions designed to ensure the maintenance of complete order and security in the regions bordering on the frontier. In particular the measures to be taken against persons coming from one territory and committing acts of aggression in the other will be laid down, and provision will be made for the exclusion from a zone on each side of the frontier, of a width to be fixed by agreement between the two Governments, of any individuals whose conduct might be considered as prejudicial to peace and order in the territories under the administration of the other party. H. PONSOT, F. H. HUMPHRYS. Paris.. October 31, 1931.Annex B. San Remo sought by mutual consent a practical solution of these piobiems. negotiations undertaken for this purpose by the two Govern ments resS in the signature of the Franco-Bntrsh Convent.on of the 23 rd ArS b l ofS convention fixed the boundaries between the territories for which tOe mandates are respectively exercised by His Majesty s Government m the United Kingdom and the Government of the French Republic According to the terms of article 2, a mixed commission was to be established to traee°on the spot the boundaries so fixed. The same article stipulated that any dispute that should arise in connexion with the work of this commission would be referred to the Council of the League of Nations whose decision would be final The two Governments subsequently decided that the commission shou d conform to the provisions of article 29 of the Treaty of Sevres regarding the lines to be A;fcomm 1 issifn 0 met d in June 1921 and proceeded to carry out the delimitation of the frontier from the Mediterranean as far as El Hamme Beyond this point it was confronted with the difficulty of establishing a line which should take account of local conditions. The commission being satisfied that it was impossible, in the existing circumstances, to overcome this dimcuity, suspended its operations, which have not since been resumed. The resumption of these operations presupposed the issue to the commission of directions agreed upon between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of the drench Republic, and an examination ot the conditions of the application of the Franco-British Convention of the 23rd December, 1920, could not usefully be undertaken between the two Govern ments before a definite allotment had been carried out of all the territories to which this convention applies. . . „ i This last condition having been fulfilled by decision of the Council ot tne League dated the 16th December, 1925, and by the signature of the Franco- Turkish Protocol of the 22nd June, 1929, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of the Republic proceeded to carry out a combined enquiry into the problem of the section of the frontier not yet delimited, which is defined by the Franco-British Convention of the 23rd December, 1920. The frontier not vet demarcated comprises two sections :—* (a) The frontier between Syria, the Jebel Druze and Transjordan. (b) The frontier between Syria and Iraq. As regards (a), the Syria-Jebel Druse-Transjordan section, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of the Republic have succeeded in arriving at a solution of the problems which confronted them, and have agreed, subject to the approval of the Council of the League of Nations, upon a line which can be delimited on the ground by a commission such as is contemplated by article 2 of the said convention. As regards (b), the Syria-Iraq section, the two Governments found themselves faced with difficulties analogous to those which had stopped the work of the commission in 1921. The difficulties were two-fold. In the first pHoe, divergencies of opinion existed as to the exact interpretation of the frontier whien article 1 of the convention was intended to define. Secondly, it was found that whatever interpretation was placed upon article 1 of the said convention, a frontier drawn in strict conformity therewith would be likely to be unsatisfactory in certain sectors for military, political, administrative, tribal, economic, geo graphical or other reasons. f His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government or the Republic consider that it is not within the competence of a Delimitation Commission, such as that referred to in article 2 of the convention, to modify theTelegram .from the High CQzrnniasIoner for Iraq -N to the Secretary of State far the Colonies., D&amp;tcu hat .a ji07©inher X93X^ BcoelvcC. 3 a 4:4 p c i&amp; £t6th Sfo^rcuibor c i 10*405* Addressed to the Secretary of state for the Colonies 0 Repeated to the Government of India Ho*24^ My telegam. 110*384, In view of pr oh ability that I 4 u.i^a 4 &gt; Commission to consider Iroq-Syrian Boandary qaestlon will he appointed at Paris Session of the Coonell now la progress early completion of sorrey becomes matter of great nrgenay 0 I should he glad to know as soon as possible hy what date Indian Surveyors can be mad© available„lb—- ■ ' ■ Us t/ - Communications on this subject should be addressed to— T The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l. and the following Number quoted : 891 42/31 I, am directed by Secretary Sir Philip CUiiliffe-Lieter to transmit to you, to be laid before ti^e .secretary of State for India, a copy of a telegram fi om tne Acting High Commissioner for Irac[ regarding the desire of the Iraq Government to obtain on loan from the Government of India a party of Moslem Surveyors in connection with the proposed survey of the Syrian frontier.

Ponsot at first stated that the principle on which negotiations must be based was thao it was impossible for the French to give up any occupied territory by private arrangement between the two Governments; it would be possible for the French to give up territory now occupied by them to the south of the Convention line only by direction of the League of Nations. M. Briand had given M. Berthelot instructions that he should not accept any solution which would be likely to give rise to trouble in Parliament. For this reason* Sir F. Humphrys had put forward the proposal that any agreement reached regarding the Transjordan frontier should be submitted to the League for approval next May after the next French elections had been held. After further conversations* in which a basis for negotiations was arrived at as between Sir F. Humphrys 1 principle of a ’'strategic'* line* and M. Ponsot T s principle of an “'administrative' line* M. Ponsot modified his original-2- point of view that the French could not agree to give up any occupied territory and interpreted that to mean that they could not surrender any ''occupied village'*, it being understood that this term should not include military posts or cultivated ground. On this basis the French claimed the village of Awad which lay just on the Trans-Jordan side of the line v/hich we were proposing. As a result of reference to London it had been agreed that this village should remain in French territory. ns regards the Imtan-TTasib sector in general 5 Sir F. Humphrys had maintained the position that the irans-oordan corridor was narrow at this point and that the concessions which he was offering in this sector could not be reasonably increased without impairing the protection required for the pipeline and railway routes. M. Ponsot had recognised the justification for the British standpoint in tnis sector^ and Sir Francis thought that a satisfactory settlement could be reached. In the Deraa sector a provisional agreement had been reached* based on the line described in his instruc tions. The French had insisted on introducing the question of the Yarmuk Valley. They claimed that* as our right under the Anglo-French Convention of 1920 to construct a railway through this valley had now lapsed* there were good grounds for altering the boundary in the valley* and they suggested that the boundary should run along the crest of the hills to the south of the valley* thus bringing the valley completely under French control. Sir p. Humphry's had pointed out that this would deny access to the river by Ihe inhabitants of Trans-Jordan and would place under the control of the French the lands in the valley south of the river which belong to the Trans-Jordan tribes. He had°)1 - 3 - made it clear that he could not accept this proposal. POnSOt liaa th6n su S£'ested that the boundary should be as close as possible to o +- lo tne soutn of the railway except where the railway crossed tn ^ OI o^sed to tne north of the river s when the river woulri ..ould foral the boundary. This could be called alternative (l). fair P. Humphrys had pointed out that this suggestion was rather one-sitipa v, one sided 5 as where the railway ran south of the river it would leave th^ ^ a 1Gdve tne Trans-Jordan lands between the railway and the river in Syrian territory. He haa finally suggested either that the line laid down in the Anglo-French Convention should be adhered to or that the middle line of the main stream of the river should be the boundary throughout the valley and that where the railway crossed to the south of the river s the French should be accorded extra-territorial rights over tne railway s with its embankments, buildings, etc., m the same way as had originally been provided in the 1920 Convention for toe British railway i n the Yarmuk valley. These he would call alternatives (2) and ( 3 ). M. I-onsot had shown himself ready to consider ^ 0f theBe three alternatives and had indicated that he did not think there would be any difficulty in reaching an agreement. Sir P. Humphrys wished to receive further instruc- tiono from His Majesty’s Government as to the attitude '' hlC “ he s b°uld adopt in regard to the Yarmuk Valley before he returned to Paris and resumed his negotiations with the h* He hoped that His Majesty's Government would give bun authority to negotiate a settlement of the frontier in area in Shy cf the three ways which he had mentioned.He would suggest 9 However $ that he should only he authorised to accept as a last resort alternative (l). In a report prepared last year s Mr. K.irkhride* the Assistant Resident in Trans-Jordan ? had reported that a solution on the lines of alternative (1) would not he open to real objection 5 out Sir F» Huniphrys recognised that it involved the surrender ot a further sinall aTiiount of territory. Sir P. Humphrys stated also that M. Ponsot had given him for consideration some draft Articles for a bon volsinage agreement in the Nasih-Imtan sector. One of these Articles contained rather drastic proposals for curtailing the movements of had characters. He would like to receive the instructions of His Majesty* s Government on this point also. He thought * however 5 that a fairly stringent agreement of this kind might he of consider able advantage from the point of view of protecting the pipeline and railway routes. It would he comparatively easy for either the railway or the pipeline to he damaged and any arrangements which would assist the local authorities in controlling the movements of had characters in this area would he welcome. Sir P. Humphrys finally handed to the Committee copies of a joint note which had been signed by M. Ponsot and himself before he left Paris. A perusal or this note^ he thought s would show that there were good grounds for thinking that a final agreement could he reached when he returned to Paris on his way to Geneva. A copy of the note is attached (Appendix ?, A n )* Subject to any observations which the Air Ministry and War Office might wish to make after studying their map of the Yarmuk Valley area 51 the Committee agreed as follows33 - 5 - (a) to ask the authority of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for the Colonies to allow Sir F* Hurnphrys discretion to accept any of the follov/ing alternatives in his future negotiations with the French regarding the boundary in the Yarmuk Valley.- (1) Sir F. Humphrys 7 suggestion that the boundary snould follow trie centre of the main stream of the river throughout the valley, but that v/here the railway is situated on the south bank of the river, the railv/ay line, buildings, etc,, should be granted extra territorial rights. (2) Adherence to the line laid down in the Anglo- French Convention of 1920. (3) M. Ponsot’s suggestion that the boundary should be drawn as close as possible to the south of the railway, but that where the railway crossed to the north of the river, the main stream of the river itself should form the boundary. The Committee consider that the original proposal made by M. Ponsot that the boundary should run along the southern crest of the valley cannot be entertained.

(Prev ious Paper: M.B. .^' 1 . __oy the Secretary • The frontier hetv/een Syria on the one hand and Irag and Transjordan on the other, has for various reasons neve been finally demarcated. It has been impossible to agree reasons never upon the precise definition of the frontier laid down in the Aiigio-French Convention of December 23rd, 1920, and it is clear that some readjustment will, in any case, be required if the frontier is to be workable. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have, for several years, sought to reach an agreement with the French Government on this question on commonsense lines. Agreement by direct negotiation having proved unattainable His Majesty’s Government proposed in July 19 30 that the ^iole matter should be referred to the Council of the League, who should be asked to appoint a Commission, not only to define the line described in the 1920 Convention, but also to propose such variations i n it as seemed desirable, the various parties undertaking in advance to accept the Commission’s award. The French Government refused to agree to this solution, as they were unwilling to give the League sufficient discretion to propose the necessary modifications in the Convention line. This deadlock persisted for several months, but the French attitude eventually underwent a change, and aN - 2 - meeting, between Sin F. Humphnys the High Goramiesioner for Iraq, and M. Ponsot the French High Commissioner for Syria, at Beirut in April, 1931 , Pesulted ln agj&gt;ee _ ment between them (subject to conflation by the two Governments) on a formula (known as the Beirut formula for a reference of the question of the entire frontier to the League of Nations on the lines which had been suggested by His Majesty's Government in July 1930 . This formula the French Government have now signilied their readiness to accept. The competent authorities of His Majesty's Government have considered the matter with every desire to accept the Beirut formula and they advise its acceptance as regards the Syria-Iraq sector of the frontier. They feel, and the Iraqi Government agree, that as regards that sector it offers the only chance of solution. They have, however, been compelled to recognise that the situation in regard to the Syria-Transjordan sector has been so con siderably modified since July, 1930, that it is no longer possible to leave the establishment of the frontier in this sector to the unfettered discretion of the League. Agree ments have now been reached between the Iraq Petroleum Company and the Governments of Iraq, Transjordan and Palestine for the construction of a pipe-line from the Company's oil fields in Iraq to the Mediterranean at or hear Haifa. Pre liminary surveys have shown that both the pipe-line and the proposed Bagdad-Haifa railway are likely owing to the 00n ffgpration of the ground, to have to follow in Transjordan an alignaent much nearer to the Syrian frontier than had first teenanticipated. There i s f urthpT , ' wrth6r &gt; reason to beliere that the trench Government may if th , ,, + v J ' lx tile matte r is referred to the League, put forward a request +l ''^ U stj ' LOr the award to Syria of a much larger nr + r.• - - on tn.s sector than has hitherto been contemplated hv His v fiieot , ,, “ majesty's Government, and the transfer of such an ar=a +„ ■ • oyria would now gravely impair the security of the ni ro i p _llne and railway, if indeed it aia not render their defence impossible. His Majesty Government are, however, still prepared t0 0;tfer the ?ren ° h G °™ent considerable concessions m this sector in order to secure the establishment of frontier more in accordance with tribal and administrative needs, and geographical and strategic con siderations than would be the case if the line laid down in the 1920 Convention were to he literally adopted; but tn , Si eat importance to Iraq, Palestine and Tran: Jordan, and also from the point of view of Imperial interest of maintaining the strategic security of the pipe-line anu railway, anu o± the so-called Transjordan corridor generally, it would be dangerous to place the matter un- reservedly in the hands of the League. It is therefore the 7iew of the competent Departments of His Majesty's Government that revision of the Transjordan sector of the frontier, which is much easier to deal with than that of tne Iraq sector, should now he settled hy direct negotia tions between His Majesty's Government and the Drench Gov ernment. if i s hoped that the French Government, if the matter is properly represented to them, will be willing to agree to such a solution. It has been agreed that the matter can most suitably 'be dealt with in the first instance by a continuation of- 4 ne&gt; the personal convex- sat ions begun at Beirut Between S-r „ TT \ , now Po rluiipirs, y s and M, Ponsot ? who is/on leave in Paris. It hco* u,x..r oe-^ pro visionally arranged that Sir P&lt; Humphrys shal^ proceed ro Paris to discuss the whole question with M* Ponsot on Octoher 5th, and to endeavour to reach a comprehensive agreement. Sir P. Kunphrys’ object //ould be to negotiate a revised version of the Beirut formula, wo apply only to the Syria-Iraq. sector, and ro o:-fer to the french Government certain concessions on the Transjordan sector, with a view to reaching a direct agreement regarding the frontier in that sector and facilitating a general settlement of the whole frontier question. Sir P. Humphrys would be assisted in the Transjordan negotiations by Lieutenant-Colonel Cox, the Resident in Transjordan. The concessions which it is proposed that Sir P. Humphrys should offer to the French Government in Trans jordan are marked on the attached map. They cover two areasm marked A. and B.; the first to constitute Sir F. Humphrys* opening offer, and the second to be kept in reserve for use if required. It should be explained that these concessions would result in the establishment of a better frontier from the ethnographical and administrative point of view, would bring within the French administration cultivated areas belonging to tribes (more especially the Druzes) already under French control, and would still, in the opinion of the Service Departments concerned, offer the necessary minimum of protection to the proposed pipe line and railway. The revised line would not involve theu£\ eo concession of sc great an area to Syria as the British negotiators were empowered to offer to the french in 1930 -ny modification in the frontier 'between the two mandated territories will of course eventually need the xormal approval of the League; but there is no reason to anticipate any difficulty in obtaining such approvalo It is p therefore s submitted that Sir f 0 Humphrys should be definitely authorised to offer to the French Government concessions not exceeding areas A c and B* as marked on the attached map c j-u is requested that the members of the ministerial Committee will express concurrence or otherwise in this course ox action as soon as possible 5 in order to allo' Tr Sir X' 0 numphrys to icroceed to x-'aris on October 5th c In the event of each Kinister concerned giving his approval 5 it is submitted that a meeting of the Ministerial Sub committee on the question will be unnecessary* The minutes of the 9th meeting of the Standing.

'' S “ s ' fcated tilat the first question to be decided was that of the date on which Sir ?. Humphrys ana Colonel Cox should proceed to Paris. H . Ponsot had stated that he was at Sir F. Humphrys’ disposal from September 26th onwards, and the Foreign Office were anxious that there should be no unnecessary delay. As a result, however, of consultation with Sir P. Humphrys, with the Colonial Office and with II.1I. Minister in Paris, it had become clear that it would be impossible for Sir Francis Humphry s to proceed to Paris before October 5th. It had cnerore been provisionally arranged that he should cross on that date and begin conversations with K. Ponsot on ■ tne morning of Tuesday, October 6th. It had not yet been decided however whether Colonel Cox should go to Paris on the same day as Sir F. Humphrys or follow him when the negotiations on the Transjordan sector began. It was of course essential that Colonel Cox should take part in the Transjordan negotiations, but it was, he thought, generally considered desirable that the initial informal conversation should be between 1 , 1 . Ponsot and oir Francis Hoxap.^y,., alone As the French were, as yet, unaware of propouhl to separate uiie two frontiers it was essential fa. the rrencu Siioula be brought to agree to this before vie Transjordan sector alone was discussed. lie therefore proposed that Colonel Cox should not crass with Sir Francis Humphrys, but should await a message ^ram une latter to the effect that agreement had been reached with the French on the general policy to deal with ■tne two frontiers separately.si ons we were prep ared to , gr eed to prepare m aps snow: » and (b) the line marked 1 a we i ? ere not prept bred to \ importance 5 frc:, che point of view of the nopotiorc or b 3 that we should not ash for any concessions. !he argument on wliicli he lioeed to r oi ^ +■ ^ .

We were quite prepared to cede these Druze cultivated lands to the French, provide^ we could maintain the strategic security of_the railway ana pipe line* There were thus two basic considerations to be reconciled - the French desire to acqiire the Druze cultivated lands in Transjordan, and our desire to i etain certain hey points in Transjordan — or rather an area within a radius of two miles from those key points - in order to preserve the strategic safety of the pipe line and railway. Mr. Rendel saw no objectnon to putting this position fmnkly before the French and to offering them all the cultivated Druze lands of Transjordan in so far as that offer should not conflict with our strategic requirements e CROUP CAPTAIN PEIRSF stated that the blue line demarcated by the Air Ministry represented the utmost limit of our concession. Should there be any Druze cultivated lands to the south thereof settlement might he difficult.co untry COLONEL COX pointed out that the to the west of the orange line shown in the nap, is not Druze country. This line had been fixed Ly the 1reach theuselves and therefore there was no necessity to make any concession to the French to the west of this line* MR. RxuDLLL pointed out that the territory r \ within which concessions could he made could he dividea roughly into three areas (a) the Druze country east of the orange line (which he understood was accepted Ly the French as the westernmost limit of Druze cultivation) and north of the Line Air Ministry line, (b) a triangle of non-Druze country immediately west of the orange line and north of the mir Ministry blue line, and (c) a small area which the Air Ministry would be prepared to concede south of Deraa x 3 It thus appeared that the progressive concessions to be made to the French ran east and west, and not north and south, i.e. that we could not, in process of negotiation, offer the French a line further and further south, but that we could offer them, progressively, additional areas mere and more to the west. If there fore there was to be any negotiation about areas, he suggested that we should begin by offering the French area (A) to the east of the orange line, but so plotted as to involve a bend in the Convention line, and not a sharp salient.

COLONEL COX stated the French maps were probably more accurate than curs, and as these key points were actually physical features they would easily be recognisable* MR. REKDALL suggested that the Air Ministry and ;/ ar Office/should prepare brief memoranda, or rather technical descriptions, of a revised frontier, describing the key points and indicating ’ in detail the various lines ’vhich might be adopted. t GROUP CAPTAIN PI1SSSE emphasized the necessity of keeping our frontier at a radius of at least 2 miles from these key-points. It was agreed that the Service departments should produce memoranda defining the areas of projected concessions to be supplied to Sir Francis Humphrys and Colonel Cox who would be em powered to initial either copy after agreement has been reached with the French. (Appendix I). MR. REN DSL stated that the next point for consideration was whether the approval of the Finisuerial Committee should he obtain ed for the proposed concessions of territory. He reminded the Sub-Committee that the concessions now proposed (indeed, a somewhat larger area including them), had been agreed to in 1929, and that the British delegation at the Paris Conversations of July 1930 (on which Mr, Kirkbride had been the Transjordan Representative) had had authority to offer these concessions - and more - to the French, Nevertheless we were now proposing definitely to abandon a con siderable area which was at present under British mandate. League approval would eventually be required, but there was not likely to oe any difficulty about this. Meanwhile, it was desirable that if any such cession of territory was to be proposed, the specific sanction of Ministers should be obtained. He therefore suggested that a short note on this particular point, indicating clearly the areas which it was proposed to offer to the French in Transjordan, the reasons for making this offer, and the fact that the offer had already been approved in principle on previous occasions, should be prepared and submitted to the members of the Ministerial Committee for thBir urgent approval* THE SECRETARY undertook to prepare this note.9 *- m * REj '' r)EL urgea the de sii&gt;ability of following the physical features as far as possible. bIR RRANGIS NUMPHRYS asked for instructions as to what line he should take in the event of the French stipulating that the Convention line should he defined in the 'ransjordan sec+or before they would agree to discuss concessions in that area. MR, HANDEL considered that, i n that event, Sir Francis Humphrys should adopt the line that we were perfectly prepared to have the Convention line defined by an impartial body as regards Transjordan, but in that event we might be unable to offer such large concessions. At the moment we were prepared to offer concessions considerably beyond the Convention line v He then drew attention to the proposed re-draft of the Beirut formula. Appendix V to M*E.

Should the French not agree to the immediate settlement of the Transjordan sector, it would be necessary to reword this paragraph to read - 'As regards (a) the Syria-Transjordan sector, the British and French Governments are engaged in direct negotiations and hope shortly to agree, subject to the apuroval of the Council, upon a line to be subsequently delimited on the ground hy a Commission such as is contemplated by Article 2 of the Convention 1 ' • The first amendment was accepted, the second amendment Neing reserved for use if required.M3.

Humphrys and Colonel Cox in Paris, notwithstanding the fact that authority to offer territory including these concessions to it he French had already been given prior to the Paris Conversations of July 1930, and that no new concessions are now proposed. It was agreed that a brief memorandum explaining the situation and showing the extent of the proposed concessions should be prepared for submission to the members of the Ministerial Sub-Committee as soon as possible. THE CHAIHMAH agreed that the only point needing fresh Ministerial authority was that of the proposed concessions in Transjordan, on which a note for Ministers would be prepared.

Ibis question is of very little direct concern to India, but it is a potential source of friction in the Middle East and it may be useful very briefly to explain the recommendations of the meeting which I attended on September 8th, the minutes of which are submitted herewith. For some years past His Majesty’s Government have been trying to get the French Government to agree to a commonsense frontier between Syria and our mandated territories, Transjordan and Iraq. The French disliked a departure from the line established by the 1920 convention (the interpretation of which is in dispute), and negotiations were at a standstill, when in 1930 His Majesty’s Government suggested referring the whole question to the Council of the League of Nations. The French at first declined to give sufficient discretion to the League to settle^he question finally, but in May 1931 Sir F. Humphrys met M. Ponsot, the French High Commissioner for Syria, at Beirut and agreed on a formula for the joint reference to the League, as proposed by His Majesty’s Government, and this has been accepted by the French Government, who asked for our concurrence. The situation had, however, since changed in respect of the Trans-Jordan sector of the frontier, where the existence of the oil pipeline and the Bsgdad-Haifa railway made it strategically vital to 4793a 5000 10/30 maintain the Transjordan corridor and where, therefore, it would be impossible to contemplate giving unfettered/• 1 4 1 i unfettered discretion to the League in the delimitation of the frontier. His Majesty’s Government are, nevertheless, prepared to offer considerable concessions on the Trans jordan frontier in order to secure a boundary more suitable for local needs. So far as the Syria-Iraq frontier was ■ 1' (ll . concerned, these considerations did not apply, and Sir F. Humphrys has ascertained that King Feisal and the Iraq Government would have no objection to the reference to the League contemplated by the Beirut formula; the formula could therefore be accepted without reservation for the Syria-lraq frontier. As regards the Syria-Transjordan frontier, it wais recommended that, while it might not be desirable to communicate to the French, in writing, the strategical difficulties in the way of accepting the Beirut formula, it would be best to endeavour to negotiate orally a readjustment of the frontier suited to local needs, the French being approached with complete frankness on the strategical considerations involved. * t Tne meeting therefore recommended that the i'rench uoverment should he invited to receive Sir F. Humphrys and a small delegation to discuss the matter in Paris, where ► Ponsot now is, with a view to (1) the modification of the Beirut formula to cover the Syria-Iraq sector only, end (2) the opening of direct negotiations for the rectification of the Syria-Transjordan frontier. His Majesty’s Representative at Paris has been instructed to approach the French Government on these lines i • ' ■ in the despatch of 11th September attached to the minutes.

Ambassador, Paris, on this question. REE,Dia briefly recapitulated the recent history of this question. p or the past three or four years His majesty's Government had been trying to secure a revision on commonsense lines of the frontier between the Tigris and tne larmuk Valley, by direct negotiation with the French« Those negotiations had broken down, firstly, because the French disliked the whole principle of the revision of a frontier laid down in a valid and binding international instrument, and secondly because, in the absence of any agreement as to the precise nature of tne line laid down in the 1920 Convention, it had proved impossible co compare the ve^lues of possible concessions on either side. The French had indicated that they would be prepared to consider any definite proposals which would enabj.-o them to see how much territory they were being asked to give up and how much territory they were being offered in return. Largely owing to the attitude of the Iraqi Government on the question of the interpretation of the Convention, it had been impossible to give the French any such information. In view of this double&lt;§&gt; l ‘ 1 '' -2- difficulty of aereoin^ ('i ) +1 ° elng ( ' L) on ths correct interpretation of the Convention, and (?) nr. ^ ’ on concessions to be made on either side, negotiations had broken down; and, in the course of the informal conversations held in Paris in 1 ~^’ “ ls majesty's Government had finally, as the D6st vyay out of thp di 'P-f-; +T 7 - -n. culty , proposed a reference of the U hole Hiatt QT to thp Hnnrn-i 4 -u t- of the ueague to be dealt with at its absolute discretion. The French Government had, however, subsequently refused to agree to the league being given sufficient discretion to enable it to provide ior any real revision of the frontier, and a deadlock had been reached. In May 1931, at Beirut, and the n;a.r i? . Eairphrys had met Monsieur Ponsot t«o High Commissioners had agreed on a formula providing for the reference of :he whole matter to the Council of the League on the lines advocated by His Majesty’s Government last year. This formula gave toe Council sufficient discretion, and would have been entirely accepts ole to His Majesty’s Government a year a h.o - It had now been accepted by the french Government. .decent developments had, nowever, now brought about a change In the situation as regards the Transjordan sector of the frontier, and it had been agreed at an interdepartmental meeting held at the foreign Office on July 13th, that it was no longer practicable to apply the Beirut formula to that sector, which could only be dealt with by direct negotiation. The other Departments concerned had concurred in this course of action, but the Colonial Office had raised certain difficulties and had proposed an(g) m alternative so been called to objections and mendations. MR. FLOOD .iiLmon. The meeting had therefore consider the Colonial Office i- possible to make agreed recom- said that vs hen the conclusions of the meeting on the 13th of July vsere examined in the Colonial Office, it was felt that there was con siderable risk in accepting them for the reasons detailed in the Colonial Office memorandum of August 22nd, a copy of which had been circulated to the Committee on September 4th (seeM.E.(o) 14). I-l the drench agreed to remit the Iraq_~Syria xrentier go the League of Rations as suggested, it would be difficult for us to refuse to remit the other question of the Syria-Trans-Jordan frontier, it had been generally recognised that the possibility of equality of concession would have to be borne in mind and, in the case of the Iraq-Syria frontier, all the concessions of any importance would be on the side.of Syria. It followed, therefore, that, in order to secure a sort of n give and take 11 , it had been considered necessary to include the Trans-Jordan sector where Trans-Jordan would have to make considerable concessions to Syria in the interests of commonsense and of securing a reasonable frontier. MR. RMiDEL demurred and recalled the fact that apart from the important concession which Iraq was prepared to make to Syria at Abu Kemal, concessions had also been proposed some years ago which would give Syria a better access to the T, duck T s beak” area, and possibly a considerable/area in the Jerba Shammar between the Jebel Sinjar and the Euphrates. M7&gt; a)OD said that it was by no means certain that the Iraqis were still willing to make obese concessions.143 - 4 - IS * RSlroEL l :&gt;olnt o &lt; i out that the whole question of tne extent cf the concessiono on either eide on the Iraqi soctor -/ms dependent on the interpretation of the 1S20 contention line, and that until that line had been defined it was difficult to say what would be a concession and what would not. MR. FLOOD agreed, but was doubtful whether the possible concessions referred to by Mr. Rendel would be so large as to counter-balance Iraq’s claim in the neighbourhood of the Jebel Sinjar. if the Iraq sector was referred to the League for decision, it would Oe most difficult to resist a French claim that the Trans-Jordan sector should also be referred, and, in that case, the risk would have to be faced that a League Commission might possibly make concessions on the Trans-Jordan sector of such an amount as to prejudice the safety of the proposed railway and pipeline. It would be obvious that, if the French made gojd a claim as far south as Azrak, the whole corridor would be destroyed and the railway and pipeline would have to cross the frontiers cf Syria while even a frontier as far south as Mafrak would be open to serious objection. For that reason, the Colonial Office had come to the oonclusion that, if possible, an attempt should be made to reach an agreement with the French in the Trans-Jordan sector which could then be put t** the League «f Rations as an agreed settlement between the two Powers, In dealing with the French, it would be necessary to put the cards on the table and explain to them„ s. ISO frankly our reasons for not-wishing to take any risk of a frontier which would jeopardise the Pipeline and the railway, and at the same tlClej t0 P ° int out t0 the French that we wdre quite willing to make reasonable concessions from the strict line of the 1920 Convention, so as 'to p'ivp t.hpro m n ^ XaG - a a re ascnable frontier in the Jeoel fruzo area. -The Gni nm-o-i • 1 Colonial Oifice thought that it was at any rate possible that an agreement on these lines might be reached with the French, =.nd, in az_y case, the proposal would avoid the risk of the League being given unfettered discretion and awarding to the French in Trans- Jordan more than we could possibly agree to. However slight the actual risk might be, it would oc remembered that the Service Departments were unanimously of opinion that we could not afford to run any risk whatever, and, in view «'f uhis, the suggested course of direct negotiation seemed tc be the only one possible. MIL HMDEL explained that it would not be possible for the French to take the question \ -p 4- he revision of the Trans-Jordan sector of the frontier to the League unilaterally. The whole frontier was laid down in a valid ana binding international agreement, and, while a dispute as to the interpretatinn of that agreement might be referred to an impartial body, the Foreign Office were advised that it would be impossible for one party to appeal to■ b- the League for its revision -t -1 i—etiu-LLo without the consent of ths other. He rather doubted whether it would be possible successfully to negotiate a rewised frontier with the French even on the Trans-Jordan sector m the absence of any prior decision as to the interpretation of the Convention, since it was the absence of any agreement on the inter pretation of the Convention which had hitherto been mainly responsible for rendering all negotiations aboitive. It was for this reason that it had oeen suggested at the meeting cf July 13th that the League should, be ashed to define the Convention 1-L.ne on ohis sector. fhe negotiation of a revision of the Trans-Jordan frontier was, however, simplified by the fact that the Convention line was all in our favour, ami that any revision proposed would be almost entirely in favour of Syria, so that we should be in a strong position vis-d-vis the French. Mh. HALL explained that it was not the intention in the Colonial Office memorandum to suggest that the French Government would have any legal right to compel us to take the question of the Trans-Jordan frontier to the League, but merely that the fact that we had previously agreed that the League should be given a free hand to settle the Syria-Iraq frontier would make it very difficult tc resist a demand by the French Government that the Syria-Trans-Jordan frontier should be settled by the same procedure, ML, fhHLDEL considered that there was no reason why the fact that we had agreed to referm T tlie Syria-Iraq frontier to the Council of the League should make it necessary equally to refer the Trans-Jordan sector to that body. The two irontiers were really on a separate footing. There was every reason to refer the Iraqi sector to tne League, since it had proved entirely impossible to settle the matter by direct negotiation, and the League was closely concerned with Iraq's frontiers m view ol Iraq's impending application for admission to League membership. As regards the Trans- Jordan sector there was no reason why, if the Convention line coulu be properly defined, a settlement should noo be reached by mutual agreement between His Majesty's Government and the French Government. The inter pretation of the Convention line even on the Trans- Jordan sector however was a matter of some difficulty. At present we were arguing that when the Convention spoke of 'a line' on the Iraq sector that line v r as not necessarily a straight one. We were taking the contrary point of view in regard to the Trans-Jordan se ct or and say in. me rely of !, a iin T\T.-n U a. sib and Imtan) mu st be ca reful ■ su it ea ch case , c to hav e the Conv( be dy. MIL HaLL, while agreeing unut it was desirable that the Beirut formula should apply to the Iraq sector only, suggested that an attempt should be made to settle the Trans-Jordan frontier in direct negotiation with the French without waiting until the League nad defined the 1920 Convention line. The French wern, he said, a practical race and would probably be prepared to dispense with a definition, if persuaded that it would be to their advantage to proceed T wiMiout onu.HUI-IPHRYS SIR RRARCIS with M. .ir'onset he had sLc.ted uiiat in his conversations ,u acC3d ' solely on behalf of Iraq.. He considered that this question should he settled before Iraq became entirely independent of British assistance, as the Iraqis felt that it would he very difficult for them unaided to come to any satisfactory agreement with the french. Bhe Iraqis, therefore, wished for an early settlement o el ore Iraq became a member of the League of hationso f S .s regards vransJordan. - He stated that King Feisal and his Governjient regarded the corridor through this country as a very important Iraqi interest. The possibility of the French frontier intercepting, or even approaching the pipeline could not he contemplated by them with equanimity, 'they looked to Bis Majesty f s Government to take steps to ensure the safety of the corridor and the maintenance of the frontier at a reasonable distance to the north of the pipeline. Should France give Syria conpiete independence on the scale Great Britain has recently granted to Iraq, he considered, that King Fei sal might be able to make a settlement with the Syrian Government 0 He thought, however, that we should assume that France intends t0 remain in Syria for the present. A further need for prompt settlement was the fact that the Iraq Petroleum Company expected to be t°ld at an early date what the final line of the frontier would be, as without this information they would be handicapped in regard to the construction of the pipeline. Ke had consulted King .Feisal, who was of opinion that direct negotiations with the French were unlikely to produce any settlement of the Iraq-Syrian frontier, moreover, ifthat, were attempted, an awkward situation might arise Doth for His Majesty’s Government and King Peisal, on whom the Iraqis would lay the blame for any failure to receive their full claims. The League of Nations was, therefore, the only body whose decision would generally D 6 0.CC6pt, edo Js.S fo.]? qq Ty&gt;q /- 1 -virQ o „ _ ^ dS was concernedc, King Feisal wished to adhere to the Beirut formula. In the case of Transjordan, while we were prepared to abide by the line laid down in the 1920 Convention, the french wished to alter this, and we are thus called upon to make some concession. It might, therefore, be reasonably assumed that this was perhaps not a suitable case for presentation to the League of Rations. Besides, the question of compensating Iraq at the expense of ^ransJordan might be held to be not in accordance either with the rules of equity or with the terms of our mandate. He suggested therefore that direct, negotiation on the t&gt;yria~TransJordan sector be followed 'by reference to the League of Nations as r egards the Gyria-Iraq sector e bhould the French insist on an interpretation of the 1920 Convention before proceeding to negotiate^ this would be a delay * but should not prove an insuperable difficulty^ though, in view of the necessity of an early solution, it was preferable to negotiate at once* He hoped that, from a strategic point of view, the services would not consider that they were running any great risk in regard to the Iraq frontier MR. FlfTDFL said that he thought that the-difference between the policy advocated at the meeting of July 13 and that advocated by the Colonial Office was not so great as nad at first appeared. It was clear that the Syria-Iraq -9-sector of the frontier could not, he dealt, with by direct negotiation. There was no ''yard-stick' by which to measure concessions,- it would be most invidious for His Majesty's Government to assume any responsibility for concessions which might have to be made by Iraq to Syria? while the League nad a direct interest and concern in the matter in view of Irag s impending application for membership.

MR. RIEDEL considered that if the French Government would agree to deal with the two questions separately, our position in the ne gotiations for the revision of the Transjordan sector would be very strong. as regards the application of the Beirut formula to the Iraqi sector, he thought the best plan would, be for the necessary revision ci the formula to be undertaken by tne original drafters of the formula, i.e. Sir F. Humphrya and M. Ponsot personally. .he deadlock which had been reached last winter had been surmounted mainly as a result of the cordial personal relations established between the two High Commissioners lest May. He thought full ad vantage should be taken of this fact 9 and of the simultaneous presence of both High Commissioners on leave in Europe^ to endeavour to deal with the present difficulty in the same manner. He em phasised the desirability of putting our cards on the table so far as possible ? and being absolutely frank 3 in any negotiations with tne French. His Majesty’s Embassy in Paris had recently laid special stress on this point. The French would be the first people 00 understand, our strategic difficulties. It was for consideration, nov/ever, whether it would not be best for these difficulties in the •first place to be put before M. Ponsot by Sir F. Kuinphrys in the coarse of oral conversation. He therefore suggested that we should Propose to the French that Sir F. Humpnrys should go go Paris Co discuss the whole question with M. Ponsot personally in the lirst instance. Sir F. Humphrys would then frankly explain our difficulties and put forward our alternative proposals.B i.i:.. 1 /, o ± iD ilUi.CPLitYH i r\ i: 1 nn + Salcl rumours were prevalent that, owing to the difficulty of finding the necessary money the construction of the pipe lines might be delayed, i,e consedoreG it most undesirable that the delay in establishing tne 8yria-i'ransJordan frontier might he asea as an excuse for holding up construction and con sequent completion of the pipeline through Transjordan. lii&lt;J ^ renG ^ 1 5 being tne most interested element in ui-.e Trap Petroleum Company ? had everything to gain by expediting the completion of the line to Tripoli, fie considered this argument might be used to induce the French to come to an early settlement as regards the B y r i a —1 r a n s j o r a a n f r o n tier.

He asked whether the Transjordan Government would agree to any settlement reached by His Majesty's Government with the French. MH. ESN2EL explained that this point had already been considered two years ago, and that it had then been agreed that Transjordan would be obliged to accept any settlement decided on by His Majesty's Government, although it might be necessary eventually to obtain formal League approval for that settlement. The question had been dealt with in a long despatch to Transjordan in 1929, to which the attention ol the Transjordan authorities had again been drawn, he thought towards the end of last year. As regards the exact extent of the proposed concessions to Syria in Transjordan, MR. RSNDEL reminded the meeting that the various concessions which we might offer to Syria in this area had also been considered in detail in 1929. He realised, however, the importance of this question to the Service Depart ments, particularly in view of the impending construction of trie pipe line, and he suggested that a separate meeting should 06 he ld at which the Service Departments immediately concerned -13-(i.e. the Air Ministry and War Of’^inp'i ... ^ ''p-x ui^ice; snoaia he represented viIlen the Itaps could be considered in detail, and a decision readied as to the broad lines of the various concessions which could he offered it q Qin fT0 ^ 0 4-_ d, u ’ WdS suggested tnat separate sets of maps might he prepared, the first showing the minimum concession wnich nis Majesty T s Goverranent could offer in the first instance, tue second showing a larger area should the crencn press xor more, and the third showing the greatest concession which His Majesty’s Government would he prepared to mane in any circumstances. Although it might not be possible to mark these different concessions in detail owing to the uncertainly of the maps, key positions could he indicated in each case, and the line between such positions could be left to oe decided subsequently by an expert commission. CONCLUSION. THE SU3-COMMITTEE recommends- (i) That the Beirut formula be accepted only as regards the Syria-Iraa sector of the frontier. (ii) That the French Government be asked to agree to direct negotiations for a revision of the Syria-Transjordan sector of the frontier. The Sub-Committee consider the best procedure to be followed would be :- (a) That no written reply be sent to the French Note of 27th August, 1931, but that His Majesty’s Ambassador at Paris be asked to inform the French Government orally that certain difficulties exist which His Majesty’s Government would like to discuss with them; for that purpose they propose, if the French Government agree, to send to Paris, as soon as possible, a small delegation including Sir Francis Humphrys and Lt.-Colonel Cox. ^ A copy of a despatch addressed oy the Foreign Office to His Majesty’s Minister in Paris in accordance with the conclusions of the meebing t s now a 11 a che d (Annex p) „f ■ \ d flegation should endeavour uX ^ t- r st piaoe to arrive at an the Beirut formula applies solely to the Syria ?

As the French Government are aware, His Majesty’s Government would have been prepared to accept the present Formula without reservation a year ago, but the French Government rendered the adoption of a solution on these lines impossible by their failure to confirm the provisional agreement reached as a result of the Paris conversations of July 1930, and by their refusal to agree to the Council of the League being given a dequate discretion in the matter. The situation in Campbell, B S q etc., Paris, U)(ii) respect cf the respect cf the Transjordan sector of th „ trorti K Gn “ 1 rentier has now ^ considerably changed. Since the r,,+ omce the autumn of 1950, the new Convention between the Iraq ■■etrol e !lm o otroieum Company and the Iraqi Government has been signed and ratifies „ , t-ie.dj ana agreements have been concluded between the company and the governments of Palestine and Transjordan for the construction of a pipe line from Bagdad to Haifa. A Preliminary survey has now also been carried out for the construction both of the pipe line and of the proposed Bagdad-Half a railway.; and this survey has shown that both the pipe line and the railway are lively to have to follow an alignment nearer to rhe Syrian frontier, as laid down by the 1920 Convention, than had at first been anticipated. it is essential that the strategic security of both these lines should be adequately provided for, and that the frontier between Syria and Transjordan should not be carried so far south as either to bring it within the immediate vicinity of the railway ancl pipe line, or to involve any threat to the safety of the so- ca*leu 1 ransjor’lan corridor. It has been ascertained that this view is fully shared by the Iraqi Government, who regard ho uafety of the corridor as a vital Iraqi interest. b. These developments give additional importance to the following circumstance to which my attention has now been drawn. Hhen the question of the delimitation of the frontier between oyna and Transjordan was first considered in 1921, the French Government put forward extensive claims in this area, and at one moment the British Representative on the Delimitation Commission even proposed to the French High Commissioner a concession to Syria extending as far south as Azrak. This! (iii) proposal v/as iirmealately ropudieteo ov Pio li? ; i ;ieBty 1 s Covernment, but tiiore is reason to believe that the French Government have not lost sight of it and. may well revive it o e -u o r e a 1 ^ a g n e Co mm issio n« Altliou: h e c 1 a ira to so lax* g e a cession of Transjordan territory to Syria would be difficult to establish, the clanger of its being revived and of a much Ic'iv-.er csxeu oemg awardeo. to ^yna than his Majesty 1 s Govern— meat have hitheroo conteinplated can no longer be ignored* 4. It must moreover 'be borne in mind in t ! is connexion that the adjustments of the frontier desired by the Iraqi Government in the neighbourhood of the Jehel Sinjar are of considerable extent. Should the Commission decide in favour of Iraq in tills area, the consequent modification of the frontier might prove to extend for as much as thirty miles beyond the convention line. It hes hitherto been assumed that a League Commission would not be likely to award to Syria on the Transjordan sector an extension of more than some ton miles south of the convention line. But there is in fact no guarantee that a Commission which was prepared to award a thirty mile modification on the Iraq sector might not b led to award one of equal depth on the Transjordan sector, not withstanding the narrowness o i the corridor, particularly if the French Government should decide to press their original claim to the Asrak region. Even a compromise by which the concession to Syria should extend no further south than Mafrak could only he regarded by His Majesty r s Government with grave anxiety. 5.

In regard to this sector there u.ore ms Majesty’s Government are prepared to accept the Beirut iormuia for a reference of the matter to the League without any r eservatioru His Majesty’s Government understand, indeed, that when the Beirut formula was drawn up by Sir Brands H^mphiys and iVionsieur Ponsot, and subsequently concurred in by(v) the Iraqi Uovern-.ient ^ only the Iraqi sector of the line was taken im,o consideration. Ris Majesty's Government realise that* by restricting the application of the Beirut formula to the Iraqi sector of the frontier, it may be more difficult to put forward any formal claim that Iraq should benefit by the concessions which Ills Majesty's Government are prepared to offer to Syria on the Transjordan sector of the frontier. They feel sure., however, that the French Government will not lose sight of the extent of these concessions when putting forward to the League their proposals in regard to the Iraqi sector. F. as regards tne Transjordan sector His Majesty’s Government desiie to propose that the matter be dealt with by direct negotiations between the French Government end themselves, independently, and if necessary in advance, of any settlement which may be reached in regard to the sector between Syria and Iraq 9 8 . As you are aware, the great advance towards a settlement marked by the provisional agreement reached at Beirut last May between Monsieur Ponsot and Sir Francis Humphrys vas due in large measure to the cordial personal relations then established between the two High Commissionersa The proposals set forth in the preceding paragraphs will, if agreed to by the French Government, involve the modification of the Beirut formula in order to restrict its application to the Iraqi sector of the frontier, and will necessitate a further understanding with the French Government regarding the negotiation of the suggested modifications in the Transjordan sector* I consider that the best way of securing the agreement of the French Government to( vi) tiiis will 'bs oy pc*. oOiial discu-jiiion bcoween ilio negotiators of cue original i omul a 5 i 9 e« Lonsieur Posot and .ir gg Kunrpiirys i.?ti person^ xii tnese cipcumstancGs it is 5 in ny on ini on j definitely preferable that the reasons which have led Lis Majesty s b-overnaient bo modify their attitude should he exnlained fully and frankly to the french Government in the same manner s that is 5 orally oy Sir P« liuiiiphrys to Monsieur lonsot and the French Government s rather than by means of further official correspondence* x consiaer therefore that any further detailed discussion of the question with the Quai d*Orsay should he postponed until such a meeting can take place* 9. The final settlement of the frontier between oyria and Iraq and between Syria and Transjordan is however becoming a matter of increasing urgency and importance* I understand moreover that Monsieur Ponsot is returning to Syria in the later- part of October* His Majesty’s Government are therefore anxious that a in eting between Sir fh Humphrys and Monsieur ronsot SiiUxl take pxuce in .* ai-is at t.*i.e ca-X’liesij possiole moment^ It will be necessary that any provisional agreement reached, between the High Commissioners shall be confirmed and completed in order that it may lead to a fin 1 settlement between the two governments* For this purpose further discussions of a more formal nature between IIis Majesty 1 s embassy and the French Government will be required^ and ^ desire to place the general conduct of these discussions in your hands* 10. You should therefore now inform t^e French Ministry for Foreign Affairs orally $ with further reference to their note of August 27th ? that his Majesty’s Government consider that the difficulties which have arisen in connexion with the Beirut(vii o) formula are most likely to ’oe satisfactorily overcome by personal discussion between the drafters of that formula, i. e . the Bigfa Commissioners for Syria and Iran, who are now both m Europe on leave. His Majesty's Government accordingly propose that informal conversations shall take place in Paris m the near future, in the first instance between Sir P.Humphry ana monsieur Ponsot, and as soon as possible thereafter between ills Majesty 1 s Embassy and the r -Vpi d T Or»c:m- q-?^ p u ' ^ L c - 1 a ? oir i'' c Humiphrys and Monsieur Ponsot both being present, and that, in the course of these discussions, the difficulties in the way of the un qualified acceptance of the Beirut formula by His Majesty's Government shall be fully explained, and an alternative solution of the question proposed^ .kle his Majesty's Government also propose that Lieutenant- '-'OlOiicl wHejisr oCoXj 9 D, f c C a the British He si dent in -reinsJordan 3 snail accompany Sir in Humphrys on his visit to Paris, and take part in such portions of the discussions as concern Transjordan, for your information I may add that it is hoped that Colonel Cox’s presence will enable any direct negotiations in regard to the Transjordan sector to he proceeded with immediately 5 as soon as the main question of the limitation of the Beirut formula to the Iraqi sector of the frontier shall have been disposed of. 12. Any agreement reached with the French Government on the lines xroposed by His Majesty’s Government should immediately be embodied in an exchange of notes between His Majesty’s Embassy and the Quai d’Orsay.

PROCEDURE O 'EE causmw had under consideration the following 70 aper (0) cl - Rote by the Oecretary regarding procedure t 0 he followed in bringing the Conclusions of the Committee to the not! of Ministers concernedo i.IRo suggested that the meeting should first dispose of the question of procedure (iv;,U»(o) 21). he stated that attention had been drawm to the fact that the conclusions of the 8th Meeting held on the 14th September, 1931, regarding the proposed action to be taiven against the Imam had not been brought to the notice of the Ministerial Committee. The reason for this was that the Ministers directly concerned, i.e., the Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs and the Colonies, had been consulted individually and had both approved the action to be taken; but, in order to avoid future possibilities of misunderstanding it seemed desiracle tha+ a regular procedure should be laid down. After consulta + ion with Sir M. Hankey, a note had therefore been prepared (K.E.(0) 21) outlining the procedure which might be followed in future with a view to preventing + he possibility of any important decision, or decisions Involving active operations, being acted upon without due authority* MR. R u.;D3L explained that it would obviously be impracticable for all the conclusions of the Sub-Committee De ref erendum to the Ministerial Committee* This would moreover defeat one of the main objects for which the Sub-Committee had been set up - i.e. to speed up interdenartmental consultation. Further, many of thematters dealt with are of a co^licsted nature and raise no issues of major policy. He considered therefore that the existing practice, i.e,, that each member should, if he saw fit, submit the recommendations through the depart mental channel to his Minister, was generally adequate. It nad hitnerto been the practice only to refer to tne Ministerial Committee when this method was inadequate, or when any disagreement was anticipated* But it was clearly desirable that the question whether reference to tlm ministerial Committee was necessary or not should not go by default, and that a decision should be taken at each meeting of the Official Sub-Committee on the question whetner the conclusions reached need or need not be referred to tne ministerial Committee. It had been suggested that tiie formal responsibility for deciding whether any specific question was of sufficient importance to justify reference to the Ministerial Committee should be laid on the chairman. n.R« rvILLIAlviS asked whether this procedure would enable immediate action to be taken by the departments concerned, if necessary, in cases where the Chairman has rule&lt; reference to the ministerial Committee to be unnecessary c MR. -bdjRDEL said that he understood this to be the intention. But if there was any doubt it would obviously be the duty of the Chairman to ask that the matter should oe referred to the Ministerial Committee for consideration. In any case, members would be responsible for referring any question 'which they thought fit to their own Ministers as in the iDast.1- 17 ' (nh ^ 1 2a SYRI A-IRAQ.

It had therefore been provisionally arranged that he should cross on that date and begin conversations with 1 , 1 . Ponsot on the morning of Tuesday, October 6th. it had not yet been decided however whether Colonel Cox should go to Paris on two same day as Sir F. Eumphrys or follow him when the negotiations on the Transjordan sector began. It was oi course essential that Colonel Cox should take part in the Transjordan negotiations, but it was, he thought, generally considered desirable that the initial informal conversation should be between K. Ponsot and Sir Francis i.urupuys alone. As the French were, as yet, unaware of our proposal to separate the two frontiers it was essential tnat the French should be brought to agree to this before tlle dransJordan sector alone was discussed. he therefore proposed that Colonel Cox should not cross with Sir Francis Humphrys, but should await a message from the latter to the effect that agreement had been reached with the French on the general policy to deal with teii, two frontiers separately.ol.-. i‘IuuiOI3 HUiViHuiYB considered i + ^ ° j -v -oj.uexca lu bhe greatest importance 5 fron the eoint of vi ---u. , . . t ' ^ogo biat or s ^ that we should not ask for anv conces-iono oo-nioo _ u ,io argument on which lie hoped to r elv r/,-- + ,, , ^ u - c -Q- 01 twmt we were ready to maie concessions on our part and ask for none in return in tne Transjordan sector.

League approval would eventually be required, but there was not likely to -c any diificulty about this. Meanwhile, ib was desirable that if any such cession of territory was to be proposed, the specific unction Ministers should be obtained. He therefore suggested that a short note on this particular point, indicating clearly the areas which it was proposed to offer to the French in Transjordan, uhe reasons for making this offer, and the fact that the offer had already been approved in principle on previous occasions, should be prepared and submitted to the members of the Ministerial Committee for tnnir urgent approval. TrlS SEGRATA RY undertook to prepare this note.features as far as possible* SIR FRANCIS HUMP HR YS asked for ins 4 ' ructions as to what line he should tane In 4 he event, of the French stipulating that the Convention line should be defined in the rn rans,Jordan sec+or before they would agree to discuss concessions in that area* MR, R' fTDEL considered that * in that event, Sir Francis Humphrys should adopt the line that we were perfectly prenared to have the Convention line defined by an impartial body as regards Transjordan, but in.that event we might be unable to offer such large concessions. At the moment we were prepared to offer concessions considerably beyond the Convention line. He then drew attention to the proposed re-draft of the Seirut formula, Appendix V to M.E.(0) SO, on page 17 of which the amendments made by the Colonial Office presupposed final agreement on the T-ransJordan sector. The Foreign Office had prepared an alternative re-draft which did not. He suggested a solution could be found were the Colonial Office formula adopted with the following amendments, io6o Line 3 from bottom of page ~ After the word 'agreed*’ Insert 'subject to the approval of the Council of the League'. Should the French not agree to the immediate settlement of the Transjordan sector, it would be necessary to reword this paragraph to read - 'As regards (a) the Syria-TransJordan sector, the British and French Governments are engaged in direct negotiations and hope shortly to agree, subject to the approval of the Council, upon a line to be subsequently delimited on the ground by a Commission such as is contemplated by Article 2 of the Convention' The first, amendment was accepted, the second amendment being reserved for use if required.Mo E T 'NnSL stated that the 5'oreign Office attached consider able importance to having any agreement, reached by the Delegation confirmed by their respective Governments immediately s it was important to avoid a repetition of what occurred in Paris in ^uly, 1930, when the French and British delegations arrived at an 9-S^formUa 5 wnich w T a.s soon 8.f b6 vwfjv ds conl'irnied 'by h^M- Government 5 but which the French Government after several weeing’ celayj altered in several essential ’Particulars» He proposed^, therefore, that any agreement, reached should he immediately incorporated in notes to be exchanged between the Hobassy and + he Quai d’Orsay before Sir Francis Humphrys and Colonel Cox left 'aris e MRo ,/ATEHFXEIlD asked when the Commission was likely to ge - to worko MR BENDEL said that s as r egards the Irag sector, the proposal was not to await the next session of the Council, but to get the question r eferred as a non-content ions one through the Chairman of the Council to the members of the Council, even if not in session. It was hoped that in this way a Commission might be appointed without delay* SIR FRAMCIS KUMPHRYS considered that should this Commission start work on the Syria-Iraq boundary in January next, its task should be completed before the hot weather, i.e» in April or May. The map that was now in preparation would facilitate settlement. COLONEL COX stated that an Anglo-French Commission composed of officers with local knowledge of the ground could start the delimitation of the Syria-^ransJordan frontier Immediately the French agreed to co-operate® MR. WATLRFIELD stated that he had raised these points as the treasury was unable to give any assurance that the necessary funds would be forthcoming during the next financial year* - 10 -\e&gt;$ THE S“uB-CCavHrrTTEE AGREED: - (l) To rocoL'ir.iCliG: - (a) That Sir Hrands Hampdys end GoJxnael.G-ox should proceed to Paris on Monday, October 5th. (b) That Sir Francis Humphrys should open conversations with Ponsot, if possible on the morning of Tuesday, October 5th 3 explaining frankly the reasons which make it impossible for His Majesty T s Government in the United Kingdom to accept the Beirut formula as applied to the frontier as a whole, and proposing that the Beirut formula should be restricted to the Iraq sector of the frontier only, the Transjordan sector of the frontier being dealt with by direct negotiation. (c) If Mu Pcnsot and the French Government agree to this, Sir Fo Humphrys should propose-', for the acceptance of the French Government, a modified form of the Beirut formula, applicable to the Iraq sector only, and should then immediately initiate negotiations, in co-operation with Colonel Cox, for the revision of the Transjordan sector* (d) That any agreement reached, both as regards the general question and as regards the main lines of the revision of the Transjordan sector of the frontier, should he incorporated in notes to be exchanged between K.Ik Embassy and the French Government before Sir F.

To cover the gap in the railway line which would then exist hy reason of the fact that aero.a is to remain in Syria, it will he necessary, to enable an alternative section to he built, that hesib should go to Transjordan for it is at this point that the Railway debouches from the hills, and that a suitable point on the line between leraa and lezerib should he chosen as the junction of the french and British sections to enable the diversion to be joined to the present main line. 11 . The principle declared in the Convention that the Yarmuk valley should belong to Syria is wrong, for the waters of this river which flow into the Transjordan and Palestine valley belong more naturally to these latter countries and it is suggested that the boundary between Syria and Transjordan should run up the centre of the Yarmuk, the ”'adi Seizun and the ' T 'a di lleddan as shewn on the map. Transjordan would thus have a rignt over 50% of these waters and it should be agreed that her rights should extend over a larger proportion, if not required by Syria, for irri gation or water power and that she should have facilities for constructing in Syrian territory storage reservoirs and other works required for these purposes. 12. If the frontier is thus drawn, the Railway line between Hamme and lie sib will still be partly in Syrian and partly in Transjordan territory. In order that it may be entirely under British control it will be necessary to agree that where it comes into Syrian territory we shall have extra territorial rights 13. The proposed frontier between Syria and Transjordan is thus drawn in red crosses as follows:- ’ T From the bridge 500 yards east of hi hamme station up the centre of the river Yarmuk to its junction with the To di Zeizun, thence up the centre oi '^he Tadi Zeizun to its junction with the ^adi lieddan, thence up the centre of the : adi ivieddan to tne tributary indicated. From this point to a point known as* El Bueib (now recognised as the frontier po:S't.) * From Bueib a line drawn to the oorth of ^ Me sib in such a manner as to include the lanek of Remthe and Me sib in Transjordan and so as to^ facilitate the building of a railway round the northern end of Jebel ez Zemle to connect the line at Mesib with the line near kezerib. From Nesib to the south-east by a line which will include the lands of Jabir in Transjordan to the point marked ’’I” on t he attached sketch nap.’* The skebeh map is of the sane scale as the 1/250000^losef^th'thifr^o't 0 f li3 ?? 18 She ' n but h ' s ^bb ent.iObea Mtn cnis repeat because the map itself is far from accurate east of the Railway line. ~ d From point ”1” the line recommended for the frontier runs uo toe south of all cultivated land (with the exception o» small patches of cultivation, north east of Semme) and leaves to the horth of it all inhabited villages with th exception of Umm el Kotein which latter is occupied bv a few people for a part of the year only. 1 eu bi a an ?i S Y'f b u Te rained villages which would give oh^lter to a small detachment.

Some oi the cisterns in the ruins could be put into repair at no very great expense. ^Tell Kais is of great importance to Transjordan as it commanas a very large area of country to the south of it. The.village of Umm el.Kutein a short distance to the north oi it should also he in Transjordan for water is obtainable there and shelter for the detachment providing outposts on Tell Kais could he found therein. In the ruins of Beir el Kaht water is obtainable most of the year in a water hole and cistern. Tell Romah is a very useful lookout hill. 15. The line proposed would enable the Transjordan northern Bedouin to roam over the country where they habitually graze for part of the year and would enable full use to be made of the military track which has been made by the QcC. Royal Air Force from Umm el Jemal to Deir el Kaht. This road can then he continued, as one passable to armoured cars, south to xizraq and will give us control over the basalt area lying to the north of the latter place. From the Deir (point XIII) north of Tell Romah the frontier should be drawn in a straight line to Abu Kemal. 16. In whatever manner the frontier line is drawn there should be an understanding that people shall have access to their usual watering places and grazing grounds. 1?-^ I have not consulted the Amir in regard to the frontier as I consider little good would be gained thereby until His Majesty T s Government has decided what line is to be insisted upon. The Amir will be exceedingly unwilling to give up any of his territory unless in exchange he can obtain the whole of the railway including Deraa. Since I conceive it to be out of the question that Deraa should be transferred to Transjordan I have not asked ror its inclusion.I consider the irontier proposed is one with v^hich the Amir should oe satisfied provided the arrange ments suggested in regard to the Railway are accepted and I an further of opinion that the concessions of territory proposed are all that Transjordan can reasonably be expected to grant. 18.^ If, however, it is regarded as absolutely indispensible to concede more territory than above proposed then the 'temporary frontier line for the Mafrak detachment' which is shewn in red dotted lines in the map should be regarded as the absolute maximum. To place the frontier further south than this would be to cause intense discontent among the Transjordan Bedouin of the north. I hav e, etc•, (Sgd•) C.H.P. ;cox.

Prior to his departure from Palestine, Sir John Chancellor caused the Amir to be consulted on the lines laid down in paragraph 9 of Mr. Amdry’ s despatch under reference. nit; highness agrees that, subject to such minor adjustments as the needs of village boundaries in the neighbourhood of Der’a, Rentheh and 2 m a sib might dictate, tne frontier may be defined as follows: 'The Convention line from al-Hammeh to the point on the map referred to where the Frontier de Fait turns therefrom to the South, thence along tiie Frontier de Fait to the point where it crosses the Railway, thence to tiie point wiiere the Convention line crosses tiie line proposed by Colonel Cox and thence the frontier proposed by Colonel Cox”. 3.

NOTE of a Meeting Meld at the Colonial Office on Wednesday* the 9th Septemher, 195l ; regarding the Syria-Trans-Jordan Frontier. At a meeting of the Middle Hast Affairs Standing Sub-Committee on Tuesday, the 8th September, it was decided to endeavour to open negotiations at once with the French for a settlement of the Trans- Jordan-Syria frontier by the despatch of a delegation to Paris during the next few weeks, and it v/as agreed at that meeting that ^representatives of the Departments concerned should consider at once what concessions could be offered to the French if and when the negotiations take place. The following were present at the meeting Mr. Williams ) ) Colonial Office. Mr, Blaxter, ) Air Vice-Marshall Burnett) ) Air Ministry. Ving Commander IX Harries ) Col .nel Cox ? Resident in Trans-Jordane Colonel Murray, Far Office. Air Vice-Marshall Burnett brought with him a map on which had been marked what the Air Ministry regarded as the limit of the concessions which should be made. The frontier proposed by the Air Ministry had been prepared with a vie?/ to the retention in Trans-Jordan of a line of villages and other high points from which there was good visibility, and the14 Air Ministry proposed that the actual frontier line should le twc miles north of these points, which would represent normal rifle range if the line had to le defended. The Air Ministry were not in favour of letting the frontier line run through the points themselves as* if that were done, it would give no room for employment of troops. If this frontier were adopted the Air Ministry were of opinion that the Iran Petroleum Company’s pipeline could le adequately protected. The proposed line left the whole of the armoured car track in Trans-Jordan. Mr. Blaxter stated that he had made enquiries from the Iraq Petroleum Company as to the prolalle route of the pipeline. It appeared that the only point at which the pipeline was likely to run near the frontier proposed ly the Air Ministry was in the neighlourhood of Umm Jemal. Colonel Cox stated that he thought that at certain places the Druze lands would run farther south than the line proposed ly the Air Ministry. He mentioned one particular point (Semina) where he thought that these lands ran right up to the village. If a frontier two miles northward were insisted on at that point 9 it would cut across these lands. The frontier proposed ly the Air Ministry runs two miles north of Umm Jemal, and, as the Iraq Petroleum Company propose to put their pipeline alout a mile south of Umm Jemal, it was recognised that thefrontier would cone very close to the pipeline at this point. Tne Iraq. Petroleum Company had said however, t.xau they could take their line a mile or two farther south if necessary at this point. This would ease the situation, hut Air Viee-Iiarshall Burnett suggested that it would he safer at this point if the frontier were to run in a straight line from two miles north-east oi Umn Surah to a point two miles north of Suhhiya leaving Shajara in Trans-Jordan, If this were done, it voulu put the pipeline at an adequate distance from the frontier. Air vice Marshal Burnett said that, subject to this possible alternative, he was of the opinion that uiie line which he had proposed should he insisted on as the maxinuu concession to the French. If any further concessions were granted, he did not feel the Aib Ministry could accept responsibility for the safety of the pipeline.16- A^FEEDU. V . L'raft for combined reference to the Council of the League of Nations. are mcler Lined. In the month of December, 1920, the British and. problems raised by the assignment to Great Britain of 1*3. Proposed amendment s t° the ^ the french Governments, desirous of finally settling the originar. Ponsot- lumphrys igreement the Manciates for Palestine and Mesopotamia, and by the assignment to trance of the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, Cunferred hy tne Supreme Council at San Remo, sought by mutual consent a practical solution of these problems. The negotiations undertaken for this purpose hy the two Governments resulted in the signature of the Franco-British Convention of 23rd December, 1920. The first Article of this Convention fixed the boundaries between the territories under the British Mandate and the territories under the French Mandate. According to the terms of the Article 2, a mixed commission was to be established to trace on the spot the boundaries so fixed. The same Article stipulated that any dispute that should arise in connection with the work cf this commission would be referred to the Council of the League of Nations, whose decision would be final. The two Governments subsequently decided that the commission should conform to the provisions oi Article 29 oi the Treaty of Sevres regarding the lines to be fixed on the ground. The commission met in June, 1921, and proceeded to carry out the delimitation oi the frontier i i ora , t ho. Mediterranean as far as Ml Hamme.-17- Beyond this point it was confronted with the difficulty of j^eflfshi np; a line which shoul d take i oing 3 especially in so far as the south of the Jebel Druze was concerned. The coinmission being satisfied that it was impossible, in the existing circumstances, to overcomo this difficulty sus pended its operations which have not since been resumed. The resumption of these operations presupposed the issue to the commission of directions agreed upon between the British and French Governments, and an examination of the conditions of the application of the 1ranco—British Convention could not usefully be undertaken between the two Governments, before a definite allotment had been carried out of all the territories to which this Convention applies. This last condition having been fulfilled by decision of the Council of the League dated the 16th December, 1925, and by the signature of the Franco-Turkish Agreement of the 22nd June, 1929, the British and French Governments proceeded to carry out a combined enquiry into the problem of the section of the frontier not yet delimited which is defined by the Convention of the 2ord December, 1920. This section is divided into two parts Isi the S.vria-Trans-Jordan frontier and (b). the Svria-Iraq frontier . As regards (a) the Syria-Trang-Jordan section the British and French Governments have succeeded in arriving at a s oluti on of the problems which confronted them and have agreed upon a line which can be delimited on the ground by a commission such as is contemplated by Article 2 of the Convention.■ • 18 - in the As reeca.r rls (h) -t-h^ „ -r e ction^ course of the enquiry the two Goremmerto - • ..

In the first place divergence of opinion existed as to the exact interpretation of the frontier which Article I of the Convention was intended to define. Secondly., it was found that whatever interpretation was placed upon Article a or tne Convention, a frontier drawn in strict conformity therewith would he likely to be unsatisfactory ln certain sectors for military, political, administrative, economic, geographical or other reasons. The French and British Governments consider that it is not within the competence of a Delimitation Commission such as that referred to in Article II of the Convention to modify the frontier aefined in Article I to an extent sufficient to remove the unsatisfactory features above mentioned. The British and French Governments being for these reasons unable to prepare suitable joint instructions for the commission as regards the Svria--Iraq section of the frontier , and desirous of promoting a speedy, final and equitable settlement of a question of primary importance to the population of the territories over which they exercise their respective Mandates have agreed to invite the Council of the League (1&gt; To examine all aspects of the difficulties referred to above and having formed its conclusions as to the intention of Article I of the Convention to indicate a frontier based thereon but modified as required by the- 19 - aforementioned, local considerations, the frontier so innicated to be accepted by all concerned as a definitive, solution of tl'io fncntisn 4 u 0 stion.

The intention would be to get the French to agree to modify the Bttrut formula so that it applied only to the Iraq- Syrie sector, the question of the Trans-Jordan-Syria sector being remitted to direct negotiations between Delegations of the two Governments, who would be furnished with the necessary technical material (maps, etc.) for effective discussion.-1 i.

REiiDEL brief 1^7 recapitulated the recent history of uhis question c For the past three or four years His Majesty T s Government had been trying to secure a revision on commonsense lines of the frontier between the Tigris and the Yarmuk Valley, by direct negotiation with the i'reach. Those negotiations had broken down, firstly, because the French disliked the whole principle of the revision of. a _l rentier laid down in a valid and binding international instrument, and secondly because, in the absence of any agreement as to the precise nature of the line laid down in the 1920 Convention, it had proved impossible to compare the values of possible concessions on either side- The French had indicated that they would he prepared to consider any definite proposals which would enable them to see how much territory they were being asked to give up end how much territory they were being offered in return- Largely owing to the attitude of the Iraqi Government on the question of the interpretation of the Convention, it had been impossible to give the French any such information. In view of this double■ ' l •* • * * • d 12!° difficulty Ox ugreeiDg u) on the con ect interpretation oi tne Oony ent:LOa J and (2) on the concessions to he made on eibhex oiae, negctiations had hroken doun; and, in the ccuise oi the informal conversations held in Paris in Julp 1030, Eis Majesty's Government had finally, as the best nay out of the difficulty, proposed a reference of tne uhole matter to the Council of the League to be dealt with dt its absolute discretion. The French Government had, however, subsequently refused to agree to the League being given sufficient discretion to enable it to provide for any real revision of the frontier, and a deadlock had been reached. In may 1931, Sir k. Humphrys had met lionsisur Ponsot a,t neirut, ana the tv»o nigh Commissioners had agreed on a formula providing for the reference of the whole matter to the Council of the League on the lines advocated by His Majesty 1 s Government last year. This formula, gave the Council sufficient discretion, and would have been entirely acceptable to His Majesty’s Government a year ago. It had now been accepted by the French Government. Becent developments had , novvever, no« broug h t about a change in the situation as regards the Transjordan sector of the frontier, and it had been agreed at an interdepartmental meeting held at the Foreign Office on July 13th, that it was no longer practicable to apply the Beirut formula to that sector, which could only be dealt with by direct negotiation. The other Departments concerned had concurred in this course of action, but the Colonial Office had raised certain difficulties and had proposed an B-alternative solution. The meeting had therefore oeen called to consider the Colonial Office objections and. if possible to make agreed recom mendations . HR. RLOOD said that vihen the conclusions of the meeting on the 13th of July were examined in the Colonial Office, it was felt that there was con siderable risk in accepting them for the reasons detailed in the Colonial Office memorandum of august 22nd, a copy of which had been circulated to the Committee on September 4th (see M,E.(C) 14)» If the French agreed to remit the Iraq-Syria frontier to the League of Nations as suggested, it would be difficult for us to refuse to remit the other question of the Syria-Trans-Jordan frontier. It had been generally recognised that the possibility of equality of concession would have to be borne in mind and, in the case of the Iraq-Syria frontier, all the concessions of any importance would be on the side of Syria. It followed, therefore, that, in order to secure a sort of ’’give and take’ 7 , It had been considered necessary to include the Trans-Jordan sector where Trans-Jordan would have to make consideraole concessions to Syria in the interests of commonsense and of securing a reasonable frontier. MIR. RET DEL demurred and recalled the fact that apart from the important concession which Iraq was prepared to make to Syria at Abu Renal, ccncessiono had also been proposed some years ago which would gxVo Syria a better access to the ”duck’s beak” area, and possibly a considerable/area in the Jerba SDammar between the Jebel Sinjar and the Euphrates. MLR. FLOOD said that it was by no me cons certain were still willing to make these that the Iraqis(0 -4- MR. RRNDEL pointed out that the whole question of the extent cf the concessions on either side on the Iraqi sector was dependent on the interpretation rf the 1920 convention line, and that until that line had been defined it was difficult to say what would be a concession and what would not. MR. FLOOD agreed, but was doubtful whether the possible concessions referred to by Mr. Rendel would be so large as to counter-balance Iraq’s claim in the neighbourhood of the Jebel Sinjar. If the Iraq sector was referred to the League for decision, it would be most difficult to resist a French claim that the Trans-Jordan sector should also be referred, and, in that case, the risk would have to be faced that a League Commission might possibly make concessions on the Trans-Jordan sector of such an amount as to prejudice the safety of the proposed railway and pipeline. It would be obvious that, if the French made good a claim as far soutn as Azrak, the whole corridor would be destroyed and the railway and pipeline would have to cross the frontiers cf Syria while even a frontier as far south as Mafrak would be open to serious objection. For that reason, the Colonial Office had come to the conclusion that, if possible, an attempt should be made to reach an agreement with the French in the Trans-Iordan sector which could then be put to the League °f Rations as an agreed settlement between the two Powers. In dealing with tho French, it would be necessary to put the cards on the table and explain to tnemfrankly our reasons for not^wishing to take any risk of a frontier which would jeopardise the pipeline and the railway, and at the same t±me, to point out to the French that we wdre quite willing to make reasonable concessions from the strict line of the 1920 Convention, so as to give them a reasonable frontier in the Jebel Druse area. The Colonial Office thought thao u u^s at any raoe possible tha.q an agreement on these lines might be reached with the French, and, in any case, the proposal would avoid the risk cl the League being given unfettered discretion and awarding to the French in Trans- Jordan more than we could possibly agree to. However slight the actual risk might be, it would be remembered that the Service Departments were unanimously of opinion that we could not afford to run any risk whatever, and, in view of this, the suggested course of direct negotiation seemed tc be the only one possible. MIL RENDEL explained that it would not be possible for the French to take the question of the revision of the Trans-Jordan sector of the frontier to the League unilaterally. The whole frontier was laid down in a valid and binding international agreement, and, while a dispute as to the interpretatir-n of that agreement might be referred to an impartial body, the Foreign Office were advised that it would be impossible for one party to appeal tothe League for its reyision without the consent of the other. He rather doubted whether it would be possible successfully to negotiate a revised frontier with the French even on the Trans-Jordan sector m the absence of any prior decision as to the interpretation of the Convention, since it was the absence of any agreement on the inter pretation of the Convention which had hitherto been mainly responsible ior rendering all negotiations abortive. It was for this reason that it had been suggested at the meeting cf July 13th that the League should be ashed to define the Convention line on this sector. The negotiation of a revision of the Trans-Jordan frontier was, however, simplified by the fact that the Convention line was all in our favour, and that any revision proposed would be almost entirely in favour of Syria, so that we should be in a strong position vis-h- vis the French. MIL HILL explained that it was not the intention in the Colonial Office memorandum to suggest that the French Government would have any legal right to compel us to take the question cf the Trans-Jordan frontier to the League, but merely that the fact that we had previously agreed that the League should be given a free hand to settle the Syria-Iraq frontier would make it very difficult to resist a demand by the French Government that the Syria-Trans-Jordan frontier should be settled by the same procedure. MR. RmHDEL considered that there was no reason why the fact that we had agreed to refer-7 tlie Syria-Iraq frontier to the Council of the League should make it necessary equally to refer the Trans-Jordan sector to that body. The two ^ frontiei o were nearly on a separate footing. There was every reason to refer the Iraqi sector to uliir u6ct 11 ^ } sine g ic iio,d. proved ent/irely iiii’DOssi'ble to settle the matter I)}/ direct negotiation,, and the League was closeiv concerned with irac_[ ? s frontiers in view oi Iraqis impending application for admission to League membership. As regards the Trans-Jordan sector there was no reason why, if tne Convention line coula be properly defined, a settlement should not be reached by mutual agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the French Government. The inter pretation of the Convention line even on the Trans- Jordan sector however was a matter of some difficulty. At present we were arguing that when the Convention spoke of 'a line* 7 on the Iraq sector that line was not necessarily a straight one, We were taking the contrary point of view in regard to the Trans-Jordan sector and saying that where the Convention spoke merely of 'a line** on that sector (e.g. between Nasib and Imtan) a straight line was meant.. we must be careful not to alter our arguments to suit each case, and. the simplest course would, be to have the Convention line defined by an impartial bo ay. ME. HALL, while agreeing chat it was desirable that the Beirut formula should apply to tne Iraq sector only, suggested that an attempt should be mau.e to settle the Trans-Jordan frontier in direct negotiation with the French without waiting until the League had defined the 1920 Convention line. tne x-iench ^eiu,, he said, a practical race and would probabj.y be pbe^crrod to dispense with a definition, if persuaded that it would be' to their advantage to proceed «iuhont ^nu.ol* x^RALCIS HUMPHRY3 stated that in his conversations with M.

' - 1 •• i J -:—T -.J NationSo As regards Transjordan^ - He stated that King Feisal and his Crovernoient regarded the corridor through this country as a very important Iraqi interest» The possibility of the French frontier intercepting? or even approaching the pipeline could not be contemplated by them with equanimity- They looked to His Majesty's Government to tane steps to ensure the safety of the corridor and the maintenance of the frontier at a reasonable distance to the north of the pipeline. Should France give Syria complete independence on the scale Great Britain has recently granted to Iraq? he considered that King Feisal might be able to make a settlement with the Syrian Government 0 He thought? however? that- we should assume that France intends to remain in Syria for the present. A further need for prompt settlement was the fact that the Iraq Petroleum Company expected to be t c ld at an early date what the final line of the frontier would be? as without this information they would be handicapped in regard to the construction of the pipeline. He had consulted King .Feisal? who was of opinion that direct negotiations with the French were unlikely to produce any settlement of the Iraq-SyrIan frontier. Moreover 9 if&lt;§&gt; ^ that vara attoipted, at, aituation .tight arias Doth for- Mis majesty’s (tovernment and l-'ing Felsal, on i.hoiii tho iracxs would lay the blame for any failure to receive their full claims. The League of Nations was, therefore, the only body whose decision would generally be accepted, ns far as Iraq was concerned. King Neisal wished to adhere to the Beirut formula*. In the case ol 1nansJordan 3 while we were prepared to abide by the line laid down in the 1920 Convention., the Ppencn wished to alter this* and we are thus called upon to make some concession. It might, therefore, be reaSQnaoljr assumed that this was perhaps not a suitable case for presentation to the League of nations. Besides, the question of compensating Iraq at the expense of uransjordan might oe held to be not in accordance either with the rules of equity or with the terms of our mandate r.e suggested therefore that direct negotiation on the oyria-TransJordan sector be followed by reference to the League of Nations as regards the Syria-Iraq sector. Should the French insist on an interpretation of the 1920 Convention before proceeding to negotiate, this would be a delay, but should not prove an insuperable difficulty, tnough. In view of the necessity of an early solution, it was preferable to negotiate at once. lie hoped that, from a strategic point of view, the services would not consider that they were running any great risk in regard o the Iraq frontier MR. RLNDFL said, that he thought that the-difference between the policy advocated at the meeting of July 13 and that advocated by the Colonial Office was not so great as had at first appeared. It was clear that the Syria-IraqLT.

'o/IR. Lh.LiiiL considered that it the French Government would agree to deal with the two Questions separately 9 our position in the ne gotiations for the revision of the Transjordan sector would be very strong. as regards the application of the Beirut formula to the Iraqi sector* he thought the best plan would be for the necessary revision of the formula to be undertaken by the original drafters of the formula* i.e. Sir F. Humphrys and M. Ponsot personally. The deadlock which had been reached last winter had been surmounted mainly as a result of the cordial personal relations established between the two High Commissioners last May. He chought full ad vantage should be taken of this fact* and of the simultaneous presence of both High Commissioners on leave in Europe* to endeavour to deal with the present difficulty in the same manner. He em phasised the desirability of putting our cards on the table so far as possible* and being absolutely frank* in any negotiations with the French. His Majesty’s Embassy in Paris had recently laid special stress on tnis point. The French would be the first people to understand our strategic difficulties. It was for consideration* however* whether it would not be best for these difficulties in the first place to be put before If., Ponsot by Sir F. Hunrphrys in the coarse of oral conversation. Ho therefore suggested that we should propose to the French that Sir F« Humphry's should go uo x ai xo ' co discuss the whole Question with H. Ponsot personally in the iirst instance. Sir F. Humphry's would then frankly explain our difficulties and out forward our alternative proposals.(S§) that c -r - : -L 9 owtn 3 r the ! -.ta ■ LOib J10ib said g to the difficulty construction of the unat rumours were prevalent of finding the necessary pipe lines might be delayed. iiC c^.tibidereo. iu most undesirable that the delay in os tablisuing tup Syria—Iransjordan frontier might be used as an excuse for holding up construction and con sequent completion of the pipeline through Transjordan.

SIR F. HITMPHRYS replied that as the Company had agreed to complete the Haifa line within six months of the completion of the Tripoli linen a delay on the Haifa line voaId probably entail corresponding delay in the construction of the Tripoli line 9 which the Company would certainly not desire. Ho also considered that the construction of the Tripoli line would not oe under taken until the alignment of the Haifa branch was settled.AXE VIC3-IuAKSH.iL EuEKLX’? .vish«d do point oat that the existing weps were inaccurate, and, until some accurate survey had been meue it would be difficult to come to any final settlement with safety, -tut. illMDiiL agreed tnae accurate maps were essential^ and saia ’ cnat a combined survey with the french had been agreed to.

He c.^.u.ed whether cue Transjordan Government would agree to any settlement reached by his Majesty 7 s Government with the French, mu 0 rtibh jJhxj explained that this point had already been conoiderea two years ago, and that it had then been agreed - rans j or dan would be obliged to accept any settlement ueeiaed on by His Majesty 7 s Government, although it might be necessary eventually to obtain formal League approval for that settlement. The question had been dealt with in a long despaten to Transjordan in 1929. to which the attention ox the Transjordan authorities had again been drawn, he thought towards the end of last year. As regards the exact extent of the proposed concessions to Syria in Transjordan, MR. RENUJL reminded the meeting that “he various concessions which we might offer to Syria in this area had also been considered in detail in 1929. He realised, nowever, the importance of this question to tne Service Depart ments, particularly in view of the impending construction of the pipe line, and he suggested that a separate meeting should oe held at which the Service Departments immediately concerned^ioC* txie --i-xx iiinibti'y uia v»ar Oiricej siiould be represented, ^ben tne maps could oe considered in net ail, and a decision i-eacned Jo ul&gt; t*A6 broad lines of ine various concessions ¥x.ii.Cii could be off ered* it was suggested that separate sets cl maps might be prepared, the first showing the minimum concession which His Majesty 7 s Government could offer in the first instance, the second showing a larger area should the french press for more, and the third showing the greatest concession which His hijesty’s Government would be prepared to make in any circumstances* Although it might not be possible to mark these different concessions in detail owing to the uncertainty of the maps, key positions could be indicated in each case, and the line between such positions could be left to be decided subsequently by an expert commission. CONCLUSION. THE SUB-COMMITTEE recommend; (i) That the Beirut formula be accepted only as regards the Syria-Iraq sector of the frontier. (ii) That the French Government oe asked to agree to direct negotiations for a revision of the Syria-Tr&amp;nsjordan sector of the frontier. The Sub-Committee consider the best procedure to be followed would be (a) That no writ'ten reply be sent to tne French Note of 2Tth August, 1931,^nub x that His Majesty’s Ambassador at Paris be asked to inform the french Government orally that certain difficulties exist which His Majesty's Government would like to discuss with them;_ for tnao purpose they propose, if the french Government agree, to send to Baris ^ as soon as possible, a small delegation including Sir Francis Humphrys and Lt.-Colonel Cox. copy r-M + of a despatch address office to His Majesty’s Minister i accordance with the conclusions of i s nor at to che d (Annex . ed by the Foreign Paris in n the ,ing(c ) That this delegation should endeavour in tne lirst place to arrive at an agreec^ amendment of the Beirut formula so that it applies solely to the Syria- ira( t sector, and, then to reach an' agreement with tne French upon the general line of a revised frontier for the rransjordan-Syria sector, which could later be delimited on the ground when the new map, which is contemplated, has been prepared.

It has been ascertained that v '^ e '' 1 a ^S.y shared by the Iraqi Government, who regard the safety o x the corridor as a vital Iraqi interest,, 3, These developments give additional importance to the Homing cir^umio cance to which my attention has now been drawn. ‘Wien me question of the delimitation of the frontier between 0/1,1 a and Transjordan was first considered in 19£i 5 the French Government put forward extensive claims in this area, and at one 11101116n T British Representative on the delimitation Ooimaission even proposed to the French High Commissioner a concession to Syria extending as far south as Azraiu This(iii) proposal was immediate 1 v — V repudiated oy bis Majes 4 - Tr T rs oy s Government. 0 U 0 there 1 s reason to believe that the French Government h ave not lo st sight of i t and may wsl 1 revive it 'before a League Commission, Altliough e claim to so large a cession of Transjordan territory to Syria would be difficult to establish, the danger of its being revived and of a much larger area being awarded to Syria than His Majesty’s Govern ment have hitherto contemplated can no longer be ignored» 4, It must moreover be borne in rind in t'is connexion that the adjustments of the frontier desired by the Iraqi Government in the neighbourhood of the Jobel Sinjar are of considerable extent. Should the Commission decide in favour of Iraq in this area, the consequent modification of the frontier might prove to extend for as much as thirty miles beyond the convention line. It has hitherto bean assumed that a League Commission would not be lively to award to Syria on the Transjordan sector an extension of more than some ten miles south of the convention line. But there is in fact no guarantee that a Commission which was prepared to award a thirty mile modification on the Iraq sector might not D led to award one of equal depth on the Transjordan sector, not withstanding the narrowness o the corridor, particularly if the Trench Government should decide to press their original claim to the Azrafe region, hven a compromise by which the concession to Syria should extend no furtnei soulh than Ma.frah could only be regarded by His Majesty’s Government with grave anxiety. 5. In these circumstances, and in view oi tne extreme importance of maintaining the strategic safety of the Transjordancorridor, more especially in connexion with tie impending construction oi the Bag&amp;ad-Haifa railway and pine line His Majesty 1 s Government have now come to the conclusion, in which nis Majesty * sisal has informed Sir 1. Kumphrys that he concurs, that it is no longer possible for them to agree to place the revision of the frontier between Syria and Transjordan unreservedly in the hands of the Council of the league. On t^e other hand., His Majesty's Government are still prepared to offer the French Government considerable concessions in this in order sector/to secure the es in.blishment of a frontier more in accordance with tribal and administrative needs and geographical and strategical considerations than would be the case if tie line laid down in the 1920 convention were to be literally adopted. They would therefore be prepared to negotiate a revision of this sector of the line by direct agree ment with the French Government, and definite proposals for the establishment of a new line on this sector are in course of preparation. 6. The foregoing considerations do not 'apply to the far longer and more complicated sector of the frontier between Syria and Iraq, where indeed it has been proved by experience that a settlement by direct negotiation of ihe question either of the interpretation of the 1920 line, or of its revision, is unlikely to be unattainable. In regard to this sector there fore His Majesty's Government are prepared to accept the Beirut lormula for a reference of the matter to the League without any reservation. His Majesty's Government understand, indeed, that y/hen the Beirut formula was drawn up by Sir Francis Humphrys and Monsieur Ponsot, and subsequently concurred in bythe Iraqi Go'/erxiuient ^ only the Iraqi sector of the line v/as taken into consideration. His Kajesry 1 s Government realise that, hy restricting the application of the Beirut formula to the Iraqi sector of the frontier ? it may he more difficult to put forward any formal claim that Iraq should 'benefit hy the concessions which His Majesty’s Government are prepared to offer to Syria on the Transjordan sector of the frontier. They feel sure, however, that the French Government will not lose sight of the encent of these concessions when putting fonward to the League their proposals in regard to the Iraqi sector. 7» As regards the Transjordan sector His Majesty’s Government desire to propose that the matter he dealt with by direct negotiations 'between the French Government end themselves 9 independently^ and if necessary in advance,, of any settlement which may he reached in regard to the sector between Syria and Iraq* 8. As you are aware 5 the great advance towards a settlement ' iparked by the provisional agreement reached at Beirut last May between Monsieur Ponsot and Sir Francis Humphrys was due in large measure to the cordial personal relations then established between the two High Commissioners, The proposals set forth in the preceding paragraphs will $ if agreed to by the French Government 0 involve the modification of the Beirut formula in order to restrict its application to the Iraqi sector of the frontier 5 and will necessitate a further understanding with the French Government regarding the negotiation of the suggested modifications in the Transjordan sector, I consider tliao hie best way of securing the agreement of the frencn Governnmo tothis will be by personal discuesion between the negotiators of ciie original i oi p i»to iiOasieur x‘'Ojfe&gt;ot and. uir in Kunphrys in person*. In these eircumctances it is ? in ny opinion, definitely preferable that the reasons will oh have led Lis Majesty’s Government to modify their attitude should be explained fully and frankly to the french Government in the same manner * that is 5 orally by Sir id Humphrys to Monsieur I onset and the French Government* rather than by means of further official correspondence* I consider therefore that any further detailed discussion of the question with the yuai a f 0rsay should be postponed until such a meeting can t&amp;Le place* 9* The final settlement of the frontier between oyria and Iraq and between Syria and Transjordan is however becoming a matter of increasing urgency and importance* I understand moreover that Monsieur Ponsot is returning to Syria in the later part of October* His Majesty's Government are therefore anxious that a in eting between Sir id Humphrys and Monsieur Ponsot shall take place in laris at the earliest possible moment^ It will be necessary that any provisional agreement reached, between the high Commissioners shall be confirmed and completed in order that it may lead to a fin 1 settlement between the two governments* For this purpose further discussions of a more formal nature between His Majesty's Mmbascy and the French Government will be required* and ± desire to place the general conduct of these discussions in your hands* 10® You should therefore now inform t^e French minis cry for Foreign Affairs orally* with further reference to their note of August 27th^ that his Majesty's Government consider tnub cue difficulties which have arisen in connexion v/itn the Beiruoformula are mo sc llf.elj' uo oe sa'cisfs.ctorily overcome 'by personal discussion between the drafters of that fY&gt;unnia 1 n the High Commies tone rs for Syria and Iran, who are now both in Europe on leave, Hio Majesty's Government accordingly propose that informal conversations shall take place in Paris in the near future, m the first instance between Sir F c Humphrys ana iviOiiSo.Ctij.. u .02100 be. and as soon as possible thereafter between His Majesty’s Embassy and the Quai d’Crsay, Sir Ih Humphrys and Monsieur Ponsot both being present, and that, in the course of these discussions, the difficulties in the way of the un qualified acceptance of the Beirut formula by His Majesty’s Goverumenu shall 00 fully explained, and an alternative solution of the question proposed, 11 0 His Majesty’s Government also propose that Lieutenant- Colone1 C,H*P®Cox, C,M.G,, D,3,0, the 3rit1sh Resident in Transjordan, shall accompany Sir P, Humphrys on his visit to Paris, and take part in such portions of the discussions as concern Transjordan. For your information I may add that it is hoped that Colonel Cox’s presence will enable any direct negotiations in regard to the Transjordan sector to be proceeded with immediately, as soon as the main question of the limitation of the Beirut formula to the Iraqi sector of the frontier shall have been disposed of. 12 0 Any agreement reached with the French Government on the lines nroposed by His Majesty’s Government should immediately be embodied in an exchange of notes between His Majesty’s Embassy and the Quai d’Orsay.

Following on the proposal of His Majesty’s Government Mi September 1928 that the frontier should be dealt with as a wnole from the Tigris to the Yamuk, informal conversations na^ taken place in Paris in July 1930, in the course of which tne - br: ^ish representative, under instructions from His ^ajesuy’s Government, had formally proposed that the whole question should be referred to the Council of the League of various, which should be given complete discretion to fix a revisedrevised frontier, and. whose decision the parties concerned ^hould pledge themselves in advance to accept. The attitude of His Majesty 1 s Government had been that what was required, in the interests of the territories concerned, was a common- sense frontier, based indeed on the 1920 Convention, but talc ing into account all relevant tribal, geographical and ad ministrative conditions. His Majesty’s Government were perfect ly prepared to put the matter absolutely in the hands of an im partial body. The French on the other hand disliked anything which would involve a revision of a treaty frontier and had hitherto taken their stand on the letter of the 1920 Convention At the Paris conversa'ticns of July 1930 a fomula providing for a reference of the whole matter to the League had been agreed upon, but the French Government had not confirmed it, as they considered that it gave the League too wide a discretion. Sub sequently a number of alternative foimulae had been discussed, but no means had been found of reconciling the British and French points of view. In May 1931 Sir F. Humphrys and M. Ponsot had met in Beirut and agreed upon a new fomula (see Annex) for submission to their governments. This formula provided for a reference of the whole question to the League on the lines hitherto ad vocated by His Majesty’s Government. It was now necessary to decide whether it should be confirmed. ihe attitude of the French Government to the Beirut ‘•oimula was still uncertain. On the one hand the Quai cl’Orsay Known to be guided to a large extent by M. Ponsot 5 s views. )Xi ^ ie °^-uer hand, their acceptance of the formula would mean 1 reverB al of the attitude they had hitherto maintained. His testy's Government were free to refuse to accept the Beirut formulaThe.... f omul a, or to propose its modification, Put this would of course involve a reversal of their previous attitude. The situation had, however, heen profoundly modified hy the inxninent construction of tne ±r&amp;Q Petroleum Company's oine- line and the possible construction of the Haifa-Bagdad Railway through Trans-Jordan. In a recent despatch from Trans-Jordan lu had been pointed out that if the League were given unfetter ed discretion to modify the Trans-Jordan sector of the frontier the French might succeed in establishing a claim before the League to a much larger stretch of Trans-Jordan territory than we had hitherto contemplated or were prepared to code to them, in which case they would seriously threaten the security of tne southern branch of the pipe-line and of the proposed rail way. it was even conceivable that the French might claim territory extending as far south as Azrak. Attention had been drawn to the fact that in 1921 Colonel Newccobe. the British representative on the Delimitation Commission which ten years ago had unsuccessfully attempted to delimit the frontier to tne east of El Hamme, had actually proposed to the French the inclusion in Syria of an area north east of a line running from Mafrah to Azrak. Although His Majesty’s Government had Promptly repudiated this offer, the French Government had re cently reverted to it. The risk of their pressing the claim could therefore not be ignored, and if they should establish it they would automatically obtain control over the southern Pipe-line and be in a position to close the Trans-Jordan corridor and strangle our communications with Trap and the Persian Gulf.of the pipe line and the railway at the expense of to gain such an advantage« The first point to decide however was whether a fair frontier should run from Mafrak to Azrak, Colonel Newcombe had evidently at that time be lieved the region north east of that line to be of little value. Since the Druze revolution of 1925 - 1927, a small number of Druzes had established themselves at Azrak and actually claimed to possess title deeds for part of the oasis but representa tives v/ho had asked for a grant of land there from time to time had always been told that no such grant could be made. While the fact that there were hruzes as far south as Azrak in itself constitutedno claim, the fact remained that the suggested alteration in the frontier of Trans-Jordan was' in tended to bring all important Druze lands into Syria and the French might be able to make use of the argument. SIR F. FOfPHRYS thought it was difficult to say whether M* Ponsot, in agreeing to the Beirut formula, had been influenced by the idea of obtain ing what v/ould now be an exceedingly valuable concession in Trans-Jordan* He had discussed the matter with M. Ponsot purely from the Iraqi point of view, and the only exchanges of territory alluded to during the conversations had been on the Iraq sector, namely in the regions of the Jeb e i Sin jar and Abu Kemal * But Sir F* Humphrys felt that oven from the purely Iraqi point of view the risk of the French obtaining a concession in TransMJordan running down to Azrak, or even only to Mafrak, such as to enable them to threaten the pipe line and railway, ought not in any circumstances to be taken. He felt that Iraq would be well advised if necessary to abandon the hope of obtain ing what they wanted in the Sin jar if they could only do so by running so grave a risk to their vital c omnuni cat i on s * MR. RSNIFL asked Mr* Cadogan whether he thought that the League would, be deterred from giving so large a concession to Syria in Trane 'Jordan by the consideration that the safety ci the pipe lane and the railway might thereby be threatened^. CABOG-ANMR» CAijOG-AN said 'thai ii would not/ be safe to rely on that. The various possible alternatives were then considered. (1) To maintain our previous policy of giving the League complete discretion to revise the whole frontier on the basis of the 1920 Convention - i.e. to endorse the Beirut formula. It was agreed that this would now involve the risk of the League giving to Syria a dangerous ly large area in TransTObrdan. It was true that obtaining concessions more than ten miles deep in Transjordan. On the other hand, Iraq was claiming a concession about thirty miles deep near the Sinjar and there was no guarantee that an equally large area might not be allotted to Syria on the j | Transjordan sector. • • • ■ . i It would of course be embarrassing to reverse j our policy on this point, but it could truthfully be represented that the situation had completely changed since July 1930, owing to the conclusion of the Iraq Petroleum Company's agreement with the ■ Iraqi government and the impending construction of the pipe line and railway. (2) To ask the League to define the line laid down in the 1920 Convention in the light of the intention of the framers of that Convention, and at the same time to make recommendations for its revision, wherever they should consider the literal adoptionof the Convention line impracticable or undesirable. These recommendations would not be binding on the governments concerned but would form the basis of subsequent negotiations for the revision of the frontier. Mr. CADOGAN thought that this proposal was open to the objection that it would be most difficult in practice for His Majesty’s Government to refuse to accept the recommendations of the League. We should therefore be in much the same position as if we had given the League complete discretion. (3) To give the League discretion ~ i*e, to adopt the Beirut formula - but with a reserva tion that His Majesty’s Government could net accept a frontier which would threaten the security of the pipe line and railway, or, alternatively, which would go beyond a certain specified line in Trans-Jordan* There were various objections to this solution.. In the first place it would be most invidious to fetter the League 1 s discretion in this somewhat arbitrary manner. Secondly, if we did lay down a maximum lino of concession in Trane-Jordan the French would equally lay down a maximum line of concession in the Jebel Sinjar so that the arrange ment would prcbab'L.y bo seriously fc Iraq s dis&amp;uvantage Again, neither the alignment of oLe pipo liae nor that of the railway in TrainJoraan had yet been fixed, so that it would be most difficult to do cine wherewhere to lay down our limit. (4) To ask the League merely to define the line laid down in the 1920 Convention, in the light of the intentions of the framers of that Convention, and to leave the question of the revision of the line to he negotiated subsequently between the interested parties direct. This is the solution which the French have always advocated* The danger, however, of it would be that the line having once been definitely established it might be exceedingly difficult to move the French from it, with the result that Iraq might never obtain any of the frontier rectifications which she regarded as necessary. SIR F. HUMPHRYS pointed out however that this would mean that the French would not get the territory they needed near Abu Kemal, a concession to wnich,he understood from Monsieur Ponsot, they now attached some importance. On the whole it was felt uha^ t,As solution would probably ultimately have to be adopued, but that it would have to be made clear from the first that the definition of the frontier by the League was to be regarded as a preliminary step to subsequent negotiations for a revision of the frontier by direct negotiation. It was agreed, however, that it would undesirable for His Majesty's Government to propose this solution at present, as the Iraqis, who had agreed to the Beirut formula, would consider that we had abandoned their interests. ( 5 )I 9. (5) To adopt the Beirut formula in respect of tho Iraq, sector only, explaining to the French frankly that owing to the new situation created hy the conclusion of the Iraq Petroleum Company’s agreement with the Iraqi Government and the impending construction of the pipe line and railway through the Trane-jordan corridor, His Majesty’s Government could no longer main tain their offer to deal with the frontier as a whole, and must leave the question of revision on the Trans-Jordan sector to te dealt with by direct negotiation, after definition ky the League of the line laid down in the 1920 Convention* SIR F. HUMPKRYS pointed out that this course would have numerous advantages from the Iraqi point of view. The Iraqis, who had already accepted the Beirut formula, had not considered it in connexion with Transjordan. If the French refused to accept tnis proposal therefore, the onus of turning down the Beirut formula would in the eyes of the Iraqis fall upon the French and not on His Majesty’s Government. II, on the other hand, the French were to accept this solution, Sir F. Humphrys thought that the situation would be better than if we found ourselves obliged to negotiate for a rectification of the Iraq sector of the frontier (after the 1920 line had been defined by seme impartial body) with the French Government direct, since the responsibility for any proposed alterations xn nm frontier (which were hardly likely to give tnw xiaqio^ completecomplete satisfaction) would fall on the League and not directly on His Majesty's Government. If solution 5 were to he adopted however, the communication to the French Government would need rather careful wording. Captain Cunningham and Colonel Murray suggested that it might be well not to refer too specifically in any conrnunication to the French to the alignment of the pipe line and railway, as these were not yet finally fixed and a subsequent’ decision to remove the alignment further south might leave the French in a position to claim a larger concession in that sector than they would otherwise ha- obtained. It was agreed therefore that the best course would be to justify our decision no longer to leave the League discretion to revise the Trans-Jordan sector of the frontier, by some such general phrase as owing to the necessity of preserving a strategic corridor between Palestine and Iraq in connexion with the proposed construction of a pipe line and railway'. It should however be made clear to the French that we should be prepared to negotiate minor rectifications on the Trans •’Jordan sector after the League had defined sne 1920 line in that sector. This was important because, if the French were left under the impression inat our object was to prevent their acquiring any concessions in the lYans-Jordan sector, they would be unlikely to agree to any satisfactory solution, since they attach great importance to obtaining at least the cultivated Druse lands immediately south of a line going from Nasib to Imtan, a concession which His Majesty'sMajesty's Government would be by no means unwilling to make. The question was at one time raised whether His Majesty’s Government could safely take the risk involved from the Iraqi point of view by the acceptance of the Beirut formula in respect of the Iraq sector only, in view of the danger that the League might give Syria a larger concession in.the Duck’s Beak area than Iraq was prepared to offer. SIB P. HIIVEPHBYS after some hesitation, however, felt that this risk was not very serious and that it could safely be run. Group Captain Peirse was averse to running any risk of this kind and further discussion on this point took place in which Sir Francis Rumphrys gave it as his opinion that:- (a) it was very unlikely that the French would accept the proposal, and (b) the natural features of the Karachok Dagh so plainly indicated the lines of the frontier as to be obvious to any commission. In these circumstances Group Captain Peirse agreed that the risk appeared to be slight. It was eventually agreed that solution No. 5 was on the whole the least open to objection and that il the French should refuse to accept it we should have no alternative but to fall back on solution No. 4.ANNEX. Humphrys-Ponsot Draft for combined reference to the Council of the League of Nations. In the month of December, 1920, the British and the French Governments, desirous of finally settling the problems raised by the assignment to Great Britain of the Mandates for Palestine and Mesopotamia, and by the assignment to France of the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, conferred by the Supreme Council at San Remo, sought Dy mutual consent a practical solution of these problems. The negotiations undertaken for this purpose by the two governments resulted in the signature of the Franco-British Convention of 23rd December 1920. The first article of this Convention iixed the boundaries between the territories under the Britisn Mandate and the territories under the French Mandate. According to the terms of the article 2, a mixed commission was to he established to trace on the spot the boundaries so fixed. The seme article stipulated that any dispute that should arise in connexion with the work of this commission would be referred to the Council of the League of Nations, whose decision would be final. The two Governments subsequently decided that the Commission should conform to the provisions of article 29 of the Treaty of Sfevres regarding the lines to be fixed on the ground. The commission met in June, 1921, and proceeded to'nrto carry out the delimitation of the frontier as far 8.s n Homme. Beyond this point it was confronted with the difficulty of delimiting a line which took account x of local conditions especially in so far as the south of the Jebel Druze was concerned. The commission being satisfied that it was impossible, in the existing circumstances, to overcome this difficulty suspended its operations which have not since been resumed. The resumption of these operations pre-supposed the issue to the commission of directions agreed upon between the British and French Governments, and an examination of the conditions of the application of the Franco-British Convention could not usefully be undertaken between the two Governments, before a definite allotment had been carried out of all the territories to which this Convention applies. This last condition having been fulfilled by decision of the Council of the League dated the 16th December, 1925, and by the signature of the Franco-Turkish Agreement of the 22nd June, 1929, the British and French Governments proceeded to carry out a combined enquiry into the problem o± the section of the frontier not yet delimited wnich is defined by the Convention of tne 23rd Decernoer 1920. In the course of this enquiry the two rovernments G&lt; .A. hese words from Bagdad, un trac^ qui wording would which should take account. as received 'd 1 etablir appear in the English text The French text however runs tint compte', and a more.correct appear to be 'of establisning a line3 • Governments found themselves faced at several points on the frontier with difficulties analogous to that which had stopped the work of the commission in 1921. The difficulties were twofold. In the first place divergencies of opinion exist as to the exact interpretation of the frontier which article 1 of the Convention was intended to define. Secondly it was found that whatever interpretation was placed upon article 1 of the Convention, a frontier drawn in strict conformity therewith would he likely to he unsatisfactory in certain sectors for military, political, administrative tribal, economic, geographical or other reasons. The French and British Governments consider that it is not within the competence of a delimitation commission, such as that referred to in article 2 of the Convention,to modify the frontier defined in article 1 to an extent sufficient to remove the unsatisfactory features above-mentioned. The British and French Governments being for these reasons unable to prepare suitable joint instructions for the commission and desirous of promoting a speedy, final and equitable settlement of a question of primary importance to the population of the territories over which they exercise their respective Mandates have agreed to invite the Council of the League to examine all aspects of the difficulties referred to above, and, having formed its conclusions as to the intention of article 1 of the Convention, to indicate a frontier based thereon but modified a -s required by the af ore-mentionedafore-mentioned local consideration^,the frontier so indicated to be accepted by all concerned as a definitive solution of the frontier question. The two Governments suggest that the task of the Council would be facilitated by the appointment of a commission which would collect on the spot such information and would make such recommendations as might assist the Council to reach a decision.'Q C R E T (0) 15.

HIKD. Secretary to the Sub-Committee u 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.l. 4th September, 1931.STRIA-Tmiss-JQRMN The course of act ion recommended by the Inter departmental Conference of the 13th of July may be said to comprise two stages* First that we should go to the French with the suggestion that the Humphrys-Ponsot formula should be applied to the 8yria~Iraq frontier only, offering to negotiate direct with the French as regards the Syria-Trans-Jordan frontier after the Convention line had been defined by the Leagueo Secondly, that when, as seems to be assumed, this one-sided suggestion has been rejected by the French, we should fall back upon the original French proposal that the League should be invited to define the whole frontier laid down in the Convention, relying upon our ability, once that line has been defined, to negotiate directly with the French satisfactory frontiers between Syria and Iraq and Syria and Trans-Jordan* This suggestion is inspired by the fear that, if the League were given unfettered discretion to lay down a sound administrative frontier in the Trans- Jordon sector, the French, might succeed in establishing a claim to territory which would endanger the security of the proposed pipe^line and Trans-Desert Railway e This fear in turn is prompted by a reputed offer by Oolonel Neweombe in 1921, made without authority and repudiated by His Majesty ? s Government, of greater territorial concessions than we are now prepared to contemplate* This incident, coupled with the possiDili*y that1 / ZB3 &gt;ae to diai, oiio Fro neb might elaim 8 frontier running oIos nafrak (a possibility which, for strategic reasons, it ia desired to avoid altogether.) is regarded as of sufficient importance to outweigh the geographical, racial and economic arguments which have hitherto led us to think that the French would he unable to sake out a valid ola ni for any territory south of Omm Jemal, But, even assuming that the danger is well founded, it is for consideration whether the course proposed would, in fact, avoid it. Let ns first consi file possibility of the French accepting the prcrjosal that ..in-* application oi the i.uiaphrys—Ponsot formula should he restricted to the Syria-Iraq frontier. This possibility as perhaps i.ot quite so remote as seems to ; AV- be assumed* Indeed, the French might see in it th» cliaxice of extracting a more favourable frontier settlement for Syria than from the full application of the formula, while, at the same time, placing His Majesty’s government Lu an invidious position vis^-vis the League of Mationse To take the last point first; in submitting such a proposal to the Council of the• League it would be neces tarv t-s i'o explain why, alt]lough m were prepared to give the League full discretion to lay down a frontier between Iraq and Syria based upon considerations of common-sense and administrative convenience, we were not prepared to give them a similar discretion, or to allow similar considerations to In applied, in the case of the frontier with Trans-Jordan* It has been suggested that this inconsistency should be explained by the necessity for preserving f, a strategic corridor” between Palestine and ?■ ra n 1 OUJ cIraq, Such an argument might be suitable for use witfc the French Government, with whom a reasonable degree of frankness is permissible; but it would be unlikely to be at all well received at Geneva. She league would at once recognise in it the cloven hoof of Imperialism. Ws sbould be accused, with sone reason, of subordinntW the interests of good mandatoiy administration to the strategic requirements of the Empire; and it is difficult to conceive of any argument for excluding the Trans-Jordan frontier that would not be open to the Bame damaging construction* Frencn might be ©xpoctod to extract come satisfaction from our embarrassment at Geneva, it is not suggested that consideration of that possibility would seriously influence the:.r attitude towards a suggestion for the restricted application of the Humphrys-Fonset formula* They would* however* have more solid reasons for accepting the suggestion* The; nii.g'.t consider that by excluding Trans-Jordan from delimitation by the League, Syria would secure a more favourable frontier with Iraq than would be likely If the two frontiers were settled at the same timSo International Frontier Commissions are notoriously paona to proceed on the basis of equality of territer5 1 concessions* They are reluctant to transfer large tracts of territory from one country to another hi fh * absence of some more or less equivalent territorial nuid pro qp n g Consequently, deprived of the . ity °f territorial compensation in Trans-Jordan* any League Delimitation Oomnission would be unlikely to recoiriaenarecommend the ceesion of . ny large area of Syrian territory to Iraq, Onoe 'rans-Jordan were excluded, they would merely have the relatively small area in the neighbour hood of abu Kama], to set off against the large expanse of territory claimed by Iraq in the north. Consequently, applying the principle of equality of sacrifice, the result would probably be that Syria would be called upon to make o^ly small ierri (orial concessions to Iraq« I&gt;at s it may be argued, the French would not be content to let tie final delimitation of the Syria-Trans- Jordan sector rest upon the possibility of a satisfactory, outcome of direct negotiations with His Majesty 9 ® Govern- aient; they would, therefore, be certain to oppose the partial application of the Humphrys-Ponsot formiiia 0 This does not necessarily follow. The fact that they had agreed, in the first instance, to that formula being appliet to the Syria-Iraq frontier only, would not debar them, at a later stage, and once that frontier had been finally delimited, from turningjthe tables upon us and pressing -iOr a revision by the league of the 1920 Convention frontier with Trans-Jordan on the basis of common-sens© principles. They would use the very arguments that we used with them at the Paris conversations and during the last two years« They would explain that experience in the administration of the Mandate for Syria had satisfied them that the Convention frontier could not be applied without serious administrative dislocation, that direct negotiations between the Mandatory Powers had failed to produce an agreed settlement; and that for precisely the same reasons that compelled His Majesty ? s Government.a-- arranging for direct negotiations regarding the Sjrii. frans-Jordan frontier to break down, and then demanding the intervention of the ^ « me League to set tie the dispute? Tnus it seems to follow that either of the counsas suggested would leave us exposed to precisely the same danger ~ possibly to even greater danger ~ as nhai. ^Lioa is said to thr3aten us if we adopt in full tne basis of the Humphrys=Ponset Agreement, f e should gain nothing, and might stand to lose a great deal. inere appeal to be only two satisfactory courses cyen to us, Firstly we 3 0 uld adhere to our original plan that the League be invite! to lay down a common-sense * frontier between French uad British mandated territories in the middle Bast, and face the danger of an unset is- factory award in Trans-Jordan. That danger, as is suggested above, has possibly been exaggerated. Apart considerations of strategy f there are strong and od? 10 us objections on economic grounds to any arrangement anat would place a small section of the proposed trans- desert railway or pipeline within Syrian territory. uu&amp;iomB and other difficulties would obviously follow from moh a course* But, surely those difficulties would present themselves, or could be represented, to any Frontier Commission sent out by the League; and it would pre-suppose crass stupidity on their part to assume that tliey would be prepared to recommend so obviously inconvenient and unworkable an arrangement. Moreover* some use might be made of Article 5 (3) of the 193J Convention ‘which recognises the principle that the trans-desert pipe-line and railway from Iraq should ran n entirely within the limits of the areas under the British MandatedThis particular provisior, it is true, has now lapsed and the frontier adjustment that it contemplated was not in the immediate area now under consideration; but the principle of an all British pipe-lice and railway, once formally admitted, would be difficult to contest, and there is no reason to suppose that the French government, who were apparently willing throughout the last ten years to surrender territory in order to preserve that principle, would now propose, or that the League Council would adopt, a irentier that would involve the pipe-line and railway passing through hyrian territory c .Alternatively 5 we could suggest to the French before ret erring the whole issue to the League, the possibility of an amicable settlement by direct negotiation should be explored further. If they agreed.. v.e go a Id then explain frankly to them our strategic requirements in Trans-Jordan and make a real attempt to negotiate a satisfactory frontier, which the League could be incited to endorseJudging by the cordial spirit which animated the Humphrys-Ponsot concersat ions g there would seem to be no ground to suppose that a reason* ably satisfactory accommodation could not be arrived at in direct negoi-iation with the French, particularly now that the pipe-line controversy* which was doubtless largely responsible for French inmransigancy in the past, is out of the way,, In all the circumstances it is recommended that the second of the two alternatives mentioned above should in the first instance be adopted. If direct negotiations with the French lead to no satisfactory result then it would be open to us to consider afresh theI 6 SS) 2 ?^ desirability of falling back either upon the first alternative or upon one of the variants recommended by the Conference on the 13th of July(S4563/48/89) Telegram to Mr. Camp Dell (Paris) Foreign Omce 5 7 th Bop temper 1931.

Following on the proposal of His Majesty’s Government in September 1923 that the frontier should be dealt with as a ' ,, ^ 1( - | le iiOn the iigris to the Yanruk, informal conversations .jaa taken pi.ace in Paris in July 1930, in the course of which tne British representative, under Instructions from His Majesty's Government, had formally proposed that the whole question should be referred to the Council of the League of Nations, which should be given complete discretion to fix a revisedrevised frontier, end whose decision the parties concerned sho-oid pledge themselves In advance to accept. The attitude 4 His Majesty's Government had been t^t wrv lc -+ u “ fcn tn&amp; t what was reauired in the interests ^ ^-loones concerned, was a conron- sense frontier, based indeed nn thn i Q o^ r, eeQ on L ' lle - l9 ^ Convention, but taio- tog into account all relevant -ve-i &gt;&gt; Q 7 icxevanx, tribal, geographical and ed- ministrative conditions. His Majesty's Government were perfect ly prepared to put the matter absolutely in the hands of an im partial body. The French on the other hand disliked anything which would involve a revision of a treaty frontier and had Hitherto taken their stand on the letter of the 1920 Convention At the Paris conversations of July 1930 a formula providing for a reference of the whole matter to the League had been agreed upon, but the French Government had not confirmed it, as they considered that It gave the League too wide a discretion. Sub sequently a number of alternative formulae had been discussed, but no means had been found of reconciling the British end French points of view. In May 1931 Sir ?. Humphrys and M. Ponsot had met in Beirut and agreed upon a new formula (see Annex) for submission to their governments. This formula provided for a reference of the whole question to the League on the lines hitherto ad- oc&amp;ued by his Majesty's Government. It was now necessary to ^cide whether it should he confirmed. me attitude of the French Government to the Beirut Simula, was still uncertain. On the one hand the Qua! d’Or say Know n to he guided to a large extent hy M. Ponsot 5 s views, the other hand, their acceptance of the formula would mean a reversal of the attitude they had hitherto maintained. His testy’s Government were free to refuse to accept the Beirut foimula...formula, or to propose its modification, but this would of course involve a reversal of their previous attitude. xhe situation had, however, been profoundly modified by the imminent construction of the Iraq Petroleum Company's pipe line and the possible construction of the Haifa-Bagdad Railway tnrcugh Trans-Jordan. In a recent despatch from Trans-Jordan had been pointed out that if the League were given unfetter ed discretion to modify the Trans-Jordan sector of the frontier the French might succeed in establishing a claim before the League to a much larger stretch of Trans-Jordan territory than v,e had hitherto contemplated or were prepared to cede to them, in which case they would seriously threaten the security of the southern branch of the pipe-line and of the proposed rail- way. it was even conceivable that the French might claim territory extending as far south as Azrak. Attention had been drawn to the fact that in 1921 Colonel Newcccibe, the British representative on the Delimitation Commission which ten years ago had unsuccessfully attempted to delimit the frontier to tns east of El Hamme, had actually proposed to the French the Inclusion in Syria of an area north east of a line running from mafrak to Azrak. Although His .Majesty's Government had promptly repudiated this offer, the French Government had re cently reverted to it. The risk of their pressing the claim could therefore not be ignored, and if they should establish it they would automatically obtain control over the southern Pipe-line and be in a position to close the Trans-Jordan corridor and strangle our communications with Iraq end the Persian Gulf.3 £&amp; 4 • r ^ fiQ Office nad oeen somewhat puzaled at M. Ponsot’s volte-face in so readily agreeing to o3:ie Beirui: formula. it was conceivable that his changed attitude might he due to the fact that tne French now realised that our proposal to hand che settlement over to the discretion of the League gave them an unexpected opportunity to obtain control cl the pipe line and the railway at the expense of a concession to Iraq in the Jebel Sinjar, which it mignt oe well worth their while to make in order to gain such an advantage„ ihe f.i.,.so point to ctecide however v/as v/hether the i isk of the French ostaining so large an area in a.rons-Jordan v/as a real one. Mr. Rondel there fore asked Colonel Cox to give his views on this point. COLONEL COX said that he thought that the risk v/as serious. Ihe French would be able to maintain that the British representative on the 1921 delimitation commission had taken the view that a fair frontier should run from Mafrak to Azrak. Colonel Newcombe had evidently at that time be lieved the region north east of that line to be of little value. Since the Druze revolution of 1925 - 1927, a small number of Druzes had established themselves at Azrak and actually claimed to possess title deeds for part of the oasis but representa tives v/ho had asked for a grant of land there from time to time had always been told that no such grant could be made. While the fact that there were Druzes as far south as Azrak in itself constituted no327 5. cla^m, Oi x g Xctdii PGinainGcl 'tiiaX 'tlio s ug a g sXsci altera uion in tiis iron or or c± Tr 8 .n s.. j ortS^oin v/as'* in tended to bring all important Druze lands into Syria and the French might he able to make use of the argument. SIR F. HLl/EPHRYS thought it was difficult to say whether IU Ponsot, in agreeing to the Beirut formula, had been influenced by the idea of obtain ing what would now be an exceedingly valuable concession in Trans-Jordan„ He had discussed the matter with M* Ponsot purely from the Iraqi point of view* and the only exchanges of territory alluded to during the conversations had been on the Iraq sector, namely in the regions of the Jeh e i Sin jar and Abu Kemal* But Sir F 0 Humphry s felt that even from the purely Iraqi point of view the risk of the French obtaining a concession in Trans.Jordan running down to Azrak, or even only to Mafrak, such as to enable them to threaten the pipe line and railway* ought not in any circumstances to he taken® He felt that Iraq would he well advised if necessary to abandon the hope of obtain ing what they wanted in the Sin jar if they could only do so by running so grave a risk to their vital c ommuni cat i on s c &gt; MR. PiniiFL, asked Mr 0 Cadogan whether lie thought that the League would be deterred from giving so large a concession to Syria in Trans-Jordan by the consideration that the safety of the pipe line and the railway might thereby be threatened. ME* CABOGAH?2a is. CADOGAN said that it would not be sa^e to rely on that. The various possible alternatives were then considered. (1) To maintain our previous policy of giving the League complete discretion to revise the whole frontier on the basis of the 1920 Convention - i. e . to endorse the Beirut formula. It was agreed that this would now involve the risk of the League giving to Syria a dangerous ly large area in Transjordan. it was true that since 1921 there had been no question of Syria obtaining concessions more than ten miles deep in Transjordan. On the other hand, Iraq was claiming a concession about thirty miles deep near the Sin jar and there was no guarantee that an equally large area might not be allotted to Syria on the TransHJatian sector. It would of course be embarrassing to reverse our policy on this point, but it could truthfully be represented that the situation had completely changed since July 1930, owing to the conclusion of the Iraq Petroleum Company’s agreement with the Iraqi government and the impending construction of the pipe line and railway, (2) To ask the League to define the line laid down in the 1920 Convention in the light of the intention of the framers of that Convention, and at the same time to make recommendations for its revision, wherever they should consider the literal adoption ♦ of3e§ 7 of the Convention line impracticable or undesirable. These recommendations would not be binding on the governments concerned but would form the basis of subsequent negotiations for the revision of the frontier, Mr. CADOGAN thought that this proposal was open to tne objection that it would be most difficult in practice for His Majesty’s Government to refuse to accept the recommendations of the League, We should therefore be in much the same position as if we had given the League complete discretion. (3) To give the League discretion - i,e. to adopt the Beirut formula ~ but with a reserva- tion that His Majesty’s Government could not accept a frontier which would threaten the security of the pipe line and railway, or, alternatively, which would go beyond a certain specified line in Transjordan. There were various objections to this solution* In the first place it would be most invidious to fetter the League’s discretion in this somewhat arbitrary nvianer* Secondly, if we did lay down a maximum lino of concession in Trane-Jordan the French would equally lay down a maximum line of concession in the Jebel Sinjar so that the arrange ment would probably bo seriously to Iraq's disadvantage Again, neither the alignment of the pipe lino nor that of the railway in Transjordan had yet been fixed, sc that it would be most difficult to decide wherewhere to lay down our limit. (4) To ask the League merely to define the line laid down in the 1920 Convention, in the light of the intentions of the framers of that Convention, and to leave the question of the revision of the line to he negotiated subsequently between the interested parties direct. This is the solution which the French have always advocated. 'The danger, however, of it would be that the line having once been definitely established it might be exceedingly difficult to move the French from it, with the result that Iraq might never obtain any of the frontier rectifications which she regarded as necessary. SIR F. HUMPHRYS pointed out however that this would mean that the French would not get the territory they needed near Abu Kemal, a concession to which,he understood from Monsieur Ponsot, they now attached some importance. On the whole it was felt that this solution would probably ultimately have to be adopted, but that it would have to be made clear from the first that the definition of the frontier by the League was to be regarded as a preliminary step to subsequent negotiations for a revision of the frontier by direct negotiation. It was agreed, however, that it would be 9 undesirable for His Majesty's Government to propose this solution at present, as the Iraqis, who had agreed to the Beirut formula, would consider that we had abandoned their interests. (5)(5) To adopt the Beirut formula in respect of the Iraq sector only, explaining to the French frankly that owing to the new situation created by the conclusion of the Iraq Petroleum Company’s agreement with the Iraqi Government and the impending construction of the pipe line and railway through the Transjordan corridor, His Majesty’s Government could no longer main tain tneir offer to deal with the frontier as a whole, and must leave the question of revision on the Trans-Jordan sector to be dealt with by direct negotiation, after definition by the League of the line laid down in the 1920 Convention, bIR r , KbMpfihYS pointed out that this course would nave numerous advantages from the Iraqi point of view. The Iraqis, who had already accepted the Beirut j-ormula, had not considered it in connexion with iransJordan, n the French refused to accept this proposal therefore, the onus of turning down the Beirut formula would in the eyes of the Iraqis fall upon the French and. not on Kis Majesty’s Government. If, on the other hand, the French were to accept this solution, Sir F. Humphry's thought that the situation would be better than if we found ourselves obliged to negotiate for a rectifj,cation of the Iraq sector of the frontier (after the 1920 line had been defined by seme impartial body) with the French Government direct, since the responsibility for any proposed alterations in the frontier (which were hardly likely to give the Iraqis completeMajesty’s to make. The Government would be by no means unwilling question was at one time raised whether Kis Majesty's Government could safely take the risk Involved from the Iraqi point of view by the acceptance of trie Beirut formula in respect of the Iraq sector only, in view of the danger that the League might give Syria a larger concession in.;the Duck's Beak area than Iraq was prepared to offer. SIR P. HUMPHKYS after some hesitation, however, felt that this risk was not very serious and that it could safely be run. Group Captain Peirse w averse to running any risk of this kind and further discussion on this point took place in which Sir Francis Humphrys gave it as his opinion that:- (a) it was very unlikely that the French would accept the proposal, and (b) the natural features of the Karachok Dagh so plainly indicated the lines of the frontier as to be obvious to any commission. In these circumstances Group Captain Peirse agreed that the risk appeared to be slight. It was eventually agreed that solution No. 5 was on the whole the least open to objection and that if the French should refuse to accept it we should have no alternative but to fall back on solution No. 4.ANNEX. S1A. Humphrys-Ponsot Draft for combined reference to the Council of the League of Nations. In the month of December, 1920, the British and the French Governments, desirous of finally settling the problems raised by the assignment to Great Britain of the Mandates for Palestine and Mesopotamia, and by the assignment to France of the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, conferred by the Supreme Council at San Remo, sought by mutual consent a practical solution of these problems. The negotiations undertaken for this purpose by the two governments resulted in the signature of the Franco-British Convention of 23rd December 1920. The first article of this Convention fixed the boundaries between the territories under the British Mandate and the territories under the French Mandate. According to the terms of the article 2, a mixed commission was to be established to trace on the spot the boundaries so fixed. The same article stipulated that any dispute that should arise in connexion with the work of this commission would be referred to the Council of the League of Nations, whose decision would be final. The two Governments subsequently decided that the Commission should conform to the provisions of article 29 of the Treaty of Sfevres regarding the lines to be fixed on the ground. The commission met in June, 1921, and proceeded toto carry out the delimitation of the frontier as far as El Hamme. Beyond tnis point it was confronted with the difficulty oi delimiting a line which took account x Ox local conditions especially in so far as the south of the Jehol Druze was concerned. Thu commission 'being satisfied that it v/as impossible, in the existing circumstances, to overcome this difficulty suspended its operations which have not since been resumed. The resumption of these operations pre-supposed the issue to the commission of directions agreed upon between the British and French Governments, and an examination of the conditions of the application of the Franco-British Convention could not usefully be undertaken between the two Governments, before a definite allotment had been carried out of all the territories to which this Convention applies. This last condition having been fulfilled by decision of the Council of the League dated the 16th December, 1925, and by the signature of the Franco-Turkish Agreement of the 22 nd June, 1929, the British and French Governments proceeded to carry out a combined enquiry into the problem of the section of the frontier not yet delimited which is defined by the Convention of the 23rd December 1920. In the course of this enquiry the two Governments XThese words apoear in the English text as received from Bagdad. The French text however runs 'd’dtablir un trac? qui tint compte', and a more correct wording would appear to be 'of establishing a line which should take accountL' i3. Governments found themselves faced at several points on the frontier with difficulties analogous to that which haa stopped the work of the commission in 1921. The difficulties were twofold. In the first place divergencies of opinion exist as to the exact interpretation of the frontier which article 1 of the Convention was intended to define. Secondly it was xound tnat whatever interpretation was placed upon article 1 of the Convention, a frontier drawn in strict conformity therewith would he likely to be unsatisfactory in certain sectors for military, political, administrative tribal, economic, geographical or other reasons. The french and British Governments consider that it is not within the competence of a delimitation commission, such as that referred, to in article 2 of the Convention,to modify the frontier defined in article 1 to an extent sufficient to remove the unsatisfactory features aoove-mentioned, The British and French Governments being for these reasons unable to prepare suitable joint instructions for the commission and desirous of promoting a speedy, final and equitable settlement of a question of primary importance to the population of the territories over which they exercise their respective Mandates have agreed to invite the Council of the League to examine all aspects of the difficulties referred to above, and, having formed its conclusions as to the intention of article 1 of the Convention, to indicate a frontier based thereon but modified as required by the afore-mentioned33? 4. . afore-mentioned local c ons id er at i or/p } the frontier so indicated to Toe accepted ty all concerned as a definitive solution of the frontier question. The two Governments suggest that the task of the Council would he facilitated hy the appointment of a commission which would collect on the spot such information and would make such recommendations as might assist the Council to reach a decision.TREATY SERIES No. 13 (1923).

(1) - I would first draw your attention to my telegram No. 40 dated 19th April, 1921, wherein are summarised the reasons for the rectification of the fiontiei, as delimitated by Hie Ireaty of Sevres, in such a way as to include the district of Amadiyah and the Nestorian country within the confines of ‘Iraq. These reasons not only are still valid, but have increased in import ance owing’ to the continued maintenance of administrative control over the districts in question by the ‘Iraq Government, which has encouraged large numbers of Christian Assyrians to return to their homes in this neighbourhood. ( 2 ) . _ Moreover, further detailed examination of the whole question and consultation with local experts has only served to strengthen my conviction that some such rectification of the Treaty frontier is essential to the future peace and security of the Mosul division.' The Treaty frontier cuts across ethnographical and geographical boundaries; it severs from Mosul large numbers of Muslim Kurds who are economically dependent for that town; and it hands over to Ottoman rule the homes of the Assyrian Christians who have the strongest moral claims to our continued protection. II.—MILITARY CONSIDERATIONS. 1 advised also that, on military grounds, the retention of the Amadiyah district within the ‘Iraqian boundary is most desirable. The high ground on which Amadiyah is situated overlooks the low-lying districts of Dohuk and Aqra to the south and the valley running westwards to Zakho, and it commands the roads which radiate to these places. With Amadivah in the hands of a hostile power and with the facilities for hostile propaganda which the frequent intercourse of the local tribesmen with Mosul would provide, adequate military protection of the northern frontier would involve insuperable difficulties. In any event Hie existence of Amadiyah as a supply and road centre And so as a potential base of hostile operations, for which the inevitable inter-tribal disturbances would offer a ready pretext, would be a constant source of anxiety to the Government of ‘Iraq. III.—EXCLUSION OF AMADIYAH IN THE TREATY. G). The circumstanneo i n which the Amadivah district was specifically excluded from ‘Trap iu the Treaty of Sevres are unknown to me and I do not doubt that they were sufficient at the time to justify the course adopted. In this connection, however, I venturer to invite your attention to Foreign Officeletter to the Colonial Office No. S. 5070/43/93 dated 10th May 1921, in which it is stated that the terms of the Treaty of Sevres regarding the northern f boundary of ‘Iraq “were drawn ut&gt; after full consultation with the British authorities in Mesopotamia.” The views of the Acting Civil Commissioner for Mesopotamia on this subject are contained in his telegram No. 10852 dated 8 th December 1918, to the Secretary of State for India, m reply to a telegram ashing him to telegraph in words suitable for insertion in the draft Treaty a definition of the frontiers of ‘Iraq. The relevant paragraph in the Civil Commissioner’s telegram is as follows : — “Amadiyah is a big Kurdish centre which it is essential to control if we are to repatriate Assyrians, Armenians, etc. now on our hands. It cannot be controlled from the north as roads are blocked in winter by snow and in spring by the flooded state of the valleys. Proposed frontier brings Amadiyah into ‘Iraq: also the Hakki (Harki?) tribe whom I imagine no one else wants.” (2). I would also refer to Map No. 2 attached to the text of the Treaty of Sevres. It will be seen that the former northern boundary of the Mosul Wilayat is marked by a chain-dotted line and that this chain-dotted line has been mainly adopted as the basis of the Treaty boundary, it being stated in Part II, Article 27, Section II, Clause (3) of the Treaty that the frontier shall follow “the northern boundary of the Mosul Wilayat,” The text contmues “modrfied however, so as to pass south of Amadiyah.” It wall be observed that the chain-dotted line on the map attached to the Treaty does in fact pass °J Amadiyah and, if this line was accepted as correctly defining the Wilayat boundary, the modification quoted above, as it appears in the text seems meaningless. In view of the many considerations already cited which emphasize the importance of retaining Amadiyah within the ‘Iraq boundarv f ,’, 1 noti f d • ahove ’ 1 f&lt;*l bound to draw your attention ’* lty °. f an e,TOr bavins; arisen in the text of the Treaty dnd to . u r ,„e t that the clause m question should have read:—“The northern of Antl/ah ” e ya ‘ ° f M0SUl - m ° dified ’ Wer, » as to pass iS (3).

I have therefore endeavoured to provide for all eventualities by submitting four proposals of which, it is hoped one will prove appropriate. These proposals are given, in the order of their desirability : the first representing what would be from our point of view the best possible frontier, and the fourth representing the furthest concessions which I am pre- ■ P arec recommend in order to secure the inclusion in ‘ Iraq of the Amadiyah district. The frontier lines represented by each of the four pro posals are indicated on the map enclosed with this despatch. I would emphasise he fact that owing to the fluid character of tribal boundaries and to the unreliability of the maps available, it is impossible at this stage to lay down a detailed frontier. The frontier lines therefore, as described in this despatch and as marked on the accompanying map, should be taken only as the most geneial indications of the boundary subsequently to be defined in detail by a Boundary Commission (as provided for in Article 29 of the Treaty). (2. The frontier lines proposed in each case may be defined roughly as follows:— First Proposal—The boundary as now administered with the addition of an area bounded approximately on the North by lat. Shewn on map thus 37° 30' and on the east and west by long. 44° and * 43°, respectively. [Detailed descriptions of:— (i) the boundary as now administered and (ii) the boundary of the area which it is pro posed to include, will be found in Appendices I and II enclosed with this des patch.] Second Proposal. —The boundary as now administered, with the addition of the area described above under first proposal, from Shewn on map thus + + + the Tigris to long. 44 ° 5 ' thence a line running in a S.E. direction, crossing the Sukuchuk Su N. of Kolitha and continuing S.E. to the western end of the watershed S. of Rudbar-i Barasgir; thehee along the watershed eastwards to the Persian Frontier. Third Proposal. —The boundary as described above under second proposal except between longs. 43 ° 40 ' and 44 ° where the bound- shewn on map thus .... ary line would follow the summits- of the Gurajar Dagh and Shirindari Dagh. Fourth Proposal. —The boundary as at present administered. This pro posal may also be extended, if necessary, to include— Shewn on map by green line — [i) The surrender of the area which it is proposed to surrender under the second proposal. {ii) The surrender of the area which it is proposed to surrender under the third proposal. VI.—COMMENTS ON PROPOSALS. First Proposal .—Taking as a basis the boundary as defined on the map attached to the Treaty, this proposal involves the following alterations: ( 1 ) The surrender of a fertile strip of territory bounded by rivers Tigris, Khabur and Hazil and by the Treaty boundary on the west, south, east and north, respectively; and the inclusion of an area between the rivers Hazil and Khabur and to the north of the Treaty boundary {see map) 1 .N 0TE: (a) These two minor adjustments are rendered necessary by the fact that the Treaty Frontier does not accord with tribal divisions. In the first instance it includes within ‘ Iraq a portion of the Slopi tribe which is dependent on Jazirah and in the second it excludes from ‘Iraq sections of the Sindi and Guli tribes who are dependent on Mosul. The retention—more correctly the adoption as an administrative boundary—of the Treaty Frontier would thus tend to produce local disorders and general unrest. (b) I am aware that the river boundary, which the first of these modi fications would involve, is open to criticism from a purely military point of view, but I venture to think that in this instance the political considerations are sufficiently strong to overrule the military objections. (c) The surrender of the strip of arable land north of the Khabur would be an indication of our sincerity as suggested above in Section IV, para. 6 . The area to be included on the other hand is mountainous and rugged and of little economic value. (2) The inclusion of a considerable area representing the Amadiyah dis trict and the Nestorian tribal country generally. Note:— (a) The pre-war boundary of the Mosul Wilayat at this point was was not satisfactory in that it separated from Amadiyah the summer pastures of a number of Assyrian and Kurdish tribes who were, and are, economically dependent on that town and on Mosul. This fact, which was unimportant wdien the boundary was merely one between two provinces, may be the cause of serious difficulties if the same boundary is adopted between Turkey and ‘Iraq. (b) The inclusion of the Assyrian country in ‘Iraq would facilitate the repatriation of those now prevented from returning by their fear of the ven geance of the Ottoman Government, from which we are under moral obligations to protect them. (c) The Assyrians, whose homes were thus included in ‘Iraq, would become ‘Iraq subjects and therefore eligible for enrolment in the ‘Iraq Levies, from which they are at present debarred by Article 207 of the Treaty of Sevres. In view of the fighting qualities of the Assyrians, this consideration is one of no little importance and ensures an adequate means of defence for the frontier proposed. (d) If these tribes are not included in ‘Iraq, they will feel that they have nothing further to expect from either the ‘Iraq or the British Governments; their predatory instincts will consequently be indulged to the full at the expense of Iraqis, British, Kurds and Turks impartially. Furthermore it is not im probable that-the Assyrians, finding that they can no longer look to the British for munitions and support, will turn again to their old friends the Russians thereby offering a fresh field for Bolshevik propaganda and enterprise. (e) The area which it is proposed to include comprises those tribes of the sedentary Kurds and Christians who are economically dependent on Amadiyah and the country of the main fighting Assyrian tribes. It is curious that the boundary proposed, though traced without back-reference, is practically identical vith the boundary of the Assyrian enclave proposed in August 1919 and shown on the map forwarded to the Secretary of State for India with the’Civil Commissioner's despatch No. 23268/119/48, dated 4 th August, 1919. m length by 15 “«« * &lt;*p*» rendered under Second PrnSrf 1)!™™ Eaikan e° n 7 “VT- t0 be SUI withiu the Treaty Frontier by a pjonouneed 7a font C0 '“‘ r ^ whlch “&gt; Appendix III).

(c) Fi nally I would emphasise the necessity of regarding this proposal as a ast resort and one only to be adopted if and when every avenue has been already explored whereby it may be possible to achieve the rectification of the frontier m the way which I believe to be most advantageous both to ourselves and to the Ottoman Government.

At this point the Mosul Divisional boundary ends, the remainder of the frontier representing the northern boundary of the Kirkuk Division. The latter boundary which runs through mountainous and little populated country, has never been clearly defined. It will therefore be convenient to adopt from here to the Persian frontier the boundary as delineated on the map attached to the Treaty. This line follows, approximately, the water shed S. of the Rudbar-i-Haji Beg. * Owing to inaccuracies in the map, it is impossible to define correctly the administrative boundary at this point and, for the sake of convenience, the treaty trentier has here been followed.

The rough sketch map attached, however, shows more accurately the actual position of the administrative frontier. 2.

No. 186, Your telegram No. 92 of 14th May and No, 136 of ? 3rd d une. Though prospect of a final settlement of frontier is more than ever remote, nevertheless it is urgently necessary that I should give some assurance both to inhabitants within frontier actually administered by us and in particular tio ? Assyrians, nhom we wish to settle, of intention of His Majesty’s Government regarding northern boundary of Iraq. (1) Necessity of satisfying them is more acute because of Turkish menace and (2) they will no longer be fenced with. Unless F rentier popula tion are convinced it is our intention to stand by them they are bound in their own interests to turn to xhpstilities. ?leading I therefore propose to instruct?permanent adviser to assume that ?Government of Iraq will continue to administer and hold broadly speaking frontier held since Armistice. Unless this assumption is made? Assyrians definitely will not settle; and as soon as Turks move administration will be impossible and country side will be against us. Very special guarantees w r iii be required, if hereafter this assumption should fail, for proper treat ment of persons who have been friendly to us, andare handed back to Turkey. As regards ultim-ate future of frontier detailed proposals are under preparation in consultation with local authorities and General Head quarters and will reach you shortly. AsAs (Persian?) matter is very urgent I trust that my proposed instructions to adviser may have your approval and that I may be informed clear the line*</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000186_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2848</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000186</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2848</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 17/4 'Iraq-Syria &amp; Syria-Transjordan frontier: delimitation'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1921/1932</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-08-10T22:25:26</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (386 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in rough chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 388; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
