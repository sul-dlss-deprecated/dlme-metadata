He was born in Rayy, south of present-day Tehran, Iran. After studying philosophy, at around the age of 30 he began studying medicine under the supervision of Abu Al-Hassan al-Tabari. He became the head of a Rayy hospital and later headed a hospital in Baghdad. Al-Razi was known in the fields of medicine and chemistry, which he combined to prescribe medications for numerous ailments. The author of 200 books and commentaries in various fields of knowledge, al-Razi was the first to use surgical threads and wrote an important treatise on smallpox and measles. Al-Razi’s Kitab al-Mansouri (Book of medicine dedicated to Mansur), a short, general textbook on medicine in ten chapters, was translated into Latin and became one of the most widely read medieval medical manuals in Europe. The ninth chapter, on therapeutics, frequently circulated by itself under the title Liber nonus ad Almansorem (Chapter nine of the book of medicine dedicated to Mansur). Numerous editions of the book were printed in Renaissance Europe, with commentaries by prominent physicians of the day. This 1483 edition was printed in Venice by Bernardus Stagninus (flourished circa 1483–1536). It includes a commentary by Sillanus de Nigris and an essay by Petrus de Tussignano (Pietro da Tossignano), eminent physicians who were active around 1400.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Book</genre><subject><topic>Arab Medicine</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Venice</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Islamic Republic of Iran</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Textbook</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/qnlhc/7384#share">Public Domain</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
