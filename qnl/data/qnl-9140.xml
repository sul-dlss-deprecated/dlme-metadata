The nakhoda of the dhow feared punishment after his cargo was judged to be contraband by the Persian authorities, and so fled to Kuwait, with the customs guards on board and under arrest. When in Kuwait, the Shaikh of Kuwait [Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ] banished the nakhoda and his boat from Kuwait in perpetuity.The papers include a statement made by the nakhoda of the dhow (folio 14) and correspondence from various British officials, including the Foreign Office, as to what attitude the British should adopt, should a complaint be made about the incident by the Persian Government.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Abduction</topic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Great Britain--Foreign relations--Iran</topic></subject><subject><topic>Customs administration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000168#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000168#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
