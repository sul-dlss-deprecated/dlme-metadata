Monsieur le Ministre, I have the honour, under instructions from His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to draw Your Excellency's attention to the following matter. 2* On or about the 22nd September last (3lst Shahrivar) a Bahrain dhow, bearing the registration number 2402, arrived at Khor- ramshahr. On September 25th (3rd Mehrmah) the dhow was ready to depart, when the Haval authorities informed the Hakhud^c that he should register the dhow in Hhorramshahr. The Naval authorities retained his Bahrain registration papers, and instructed him not to leave Khorramshahr until the dhow had been registered in that port. on the 3rd October (llth;Mehrraah) the Naval auth orities issued to the Nakhuda a new set of Iranian registration papers and informed him that he could sail. The Nakhuda re quested the return of his Bahrain papers, but the Naval authorities refused to release them. Since the Nakhuda was suffering considerable loss by the detention of his dhow at Khorr amshahr, he decided to sail without his Bahrain papers, and the dhow eventually left Khorramshahr on the 8th October. 3./ His Excellency Monsieur Bnayatellah Samily, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Tehran.3* I have been instructed to protest on behalf of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain, at the action of the Iranian authorities in confiscating the Bahrain registration papers of a Bahrain dhow and in obliging the Hakhuda to take out Iranian papers.

AMIRALTY, s.f.i. 10th September. 1937. M.03427/37. Sir, With reference to your letter jso. 1 .3l69/l3o9/9l ot tne 7tn July, I am commanded by My Lords Conraissloners of tne Admiralty to state, for tne information of Viscount Halifax, tnat meir Lordships have had under consideration tne memorandum dealing with interference by Persian warships with Arab dnows which was enclosed in Mr. Seymour’s despatch So. 147 of the 21st April last together with the comments of the Political Resident on this memorandum whdch were contained in a semi-official letter to Sir Aubrey Metcalfe dated 21st May . 2« The main point raised in Mr. Seymour* a memorandum is whether or not force should in tne last resort be employed by one of H.M.Ships to protect an Arab dnow against molestation by a Persian warship. They note tnat Mr. Seymour suggests tn a t, althougn force migftt properly be used in Arab territorial waters, it should not at present be authorised in cases occurr ing on the high seas. 3. Their Lordships suggest that the necessity lor tne employ ment of force against a Persian war snip in aucn an eventuality is very unlikely to arise. On tne one occasion when a few years ago a Britisn sloop came on tne scene wnen a Persian warship was interfering with an Arao dnow, tne Persian snip made off in great naste long before H.M.Ship came up with the dhow. 4. My Lords nevertneiess consider it to be important tnat H.H.Ships should nave clear autnority to use force if necessary on / The Under lecretary of 'State, Foreign Office, 3.W.I.on the high seas as well as in Arab territorial waters. ihey suggest, therefore, that the instructions should take the form that, in the event of an Arab dhow being interfered with in the presence of a British warship, the latter should communicate with the Persian warship, warn her that ane is committing an illegal act and, if necessary, take the dhow in tow and take such other steps as are necessary to ensure tnat sne is not further interfered with. They would point out tnat unless tne instructions are in the sense suggested above, there is always the possibility, however remote, that a Persian war vessel might persist in her interference in the presence of and in spite of remonstrances by a British ’warship. If in such circumstances no attempt were imde to resist the illegal action of the Persian warship the effect upon our prestige amongst the Arabs would be likely to be serious. 5© Ah additional reason for issuing instructions in tne sense proposed above is that (in spite of recent verbal communications by individual Persian officials) it seems likely tnat it will shortly be necessary to make a formal communication to tne Persian Government in the sense proposed in paragrapn 6 of Mr. Seymour’s memorandum - namely that JBfjex orders nave been given to H.If. Ships to prevent any interference with Arab dnows on tne high seas. In this connection, fneir herds concur with tne views expressed in paragraphs 4 and 5 of tne Political Resident' semi-official letter of tne 21st May. Any divergence between the language used at Tehran and tne instructions issued to H.a. Ships would clearly be open to objection. 5. Another suggestion contained in Mr.Seymour’s memorandum is that in waters claimed by Persia as territorial, but not admitted as such by His Majesty’s Government, tne same course should /-3- should be adopted ag in Persian territorial waters proper - nataely that there should be no intervention by His Majesty* s Ships, but that diplomatic protests should be made and claims advanced if the vessels nave been arrested without reasonable cause. The reason he advances for making this suggestion is the desirability of avoiding risking a reference t o an internat ional tribunal on the question of the limit of Persian terri torial waters. 7, Their Lordships feel that arrangements on the lines proposed are unnecessarily complicated, and that the risk of an incident leading to recourse to an international tribunal on the question of the proper extent of territorial waters can be discounted. They therefore suggest that the same instructions should cover the whole of the high seas, up to the limit admitted by us as Persian territorial water. 8* 4s regards possible interferences inside Arab territorial 'waters, rneir Lordships would draw attention to the Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait Proclamations made in 1898-1900 in connection with the arms traffic. Copies of these proclamations are appended for convenient reference. It will be seen that they all confer upon Persian vessels the right of search of Muscati, Bahraini and Kuwaiti dhows within tne ruler’s own territorial waters. The question of tne cancellation of tnese proclamations has recently been under consideration - see in this connection semi-official correspondence commencing with Mr.Glauson’s letter P.Z.2970 of the lltn **say and Foreign Office despatch ho.204 to Tehran. Their Lordships consider that it is extremely unlikely that the Persian Government are aware of tnese provisions, and they feel tnat it is not necessary to take open steps to cancel them - wnicn, as pointed out in tne corres pondence /sorrespondence referred to above# migiit draw attention to tfie Persian Pi naan of 1897# They would point out moreover that these proclamations only relate to the suppression of the arms trade, whereas the present activities of the foreign warships seem to be mainly directed to the suppression of smuggling, 9* In order t© cover the point, Tneir Lordships suggest that the instructions to ji*m,S hips should provide that if a Persian warship which is interfering witn an Arab dhow attempts to justify her action to a British warship by alleging tnat tne vessel is engaged in the arms traffic, tne British Commanding Officer should reply that, if the allegation proves to be correct, he will see that the offenders are properly dealt with according to the law to which they are subject; and that he should subsequently talce the necessary steps to ensure tnat this is done, acting in collaboration witn tne political Resident and his staff*. It is understood tnat all tne Arab States in treaty relations witn a®^Government; nave legislation prohibiting their subjects from engaging in tne arms traffic. 10© Tneir Lordships nave noted tnat in tne political Resident* note dated 26tn February suggesting tne cancellation of the proclamations, it is stated in paragrapn 2 tnat under tne muscat Proclamation Persian vessels nave rignts of searcn of Muscat vessels on the nigh seas. Tneir Lordsnips presume tnat this interpretation is based upon tne notification dated 13tn January, 1898, vnicn was apparently issued at tne same time as tne proclamation and wnicn states tnat rt in future our Muscat flag will be no protection to vessels carrying tne said arms and ammunition from our dominions to India and Persia. 1 * Their Lordships would suggest tnat it is unnecessary to treat tnis notification as formally conveying powers of searcn upon tnettign seas, and tnat it ean toe regarded as toeing no more tnan an intimation to tne Sultan^ sutojects tnat tney carmot expect tne support of txleir ruler if tney indulge in fortoidden activities. On tiie assumption, tnerefore, tnat no otner document exists wnicn confers these powers in a more formal and definite manner, Tneir Lordships suggest that the matter would toe adequately met if the instruction covering tne case wnere a Persian warsnip alleges tnat a dhow is engaged in the arms traffic (see paragrapn 9 above) were made applicable to any ease of interference with an Arab dhow on the nigh seas as well as in Arab territorial waters* 11* In reply to tne enquiry as to tne existing instructions in your letter of the 7tn July, I am to state tnat xneir Lord- ships nave been unable t© trace tnat any specific instructions governing tne use of force nave been issued to ji.m.S nips in connection witn Persian interferences witn Arab dhows, otner than those issued in Admiralty letter m. 01721/31 of tne 14tn October, 1931, (copies of wnicn were sent to foreign Ofrice am India Office on tne same date) which stated tnat *any interference outside Persian territorial waters witn Arab dhows suspected of smuggling would call for a strong protest* Tne action to be taxen would, however, nave to depend on tne cir- edmstances of tne case’** As regards instruction or general application. Article 949 K.R • and A* I* provides tnat Brit is a ships (wn&amp;ch would undoubtedly be interpreted as including ships under Britisn protection) *are only to be protected by force against actual and wrongful violence and wnen remonstrance has failed'* This Article relates to Britisn snips in roreign porfcs, and a fortiori it could be argued tnat it applies with! j ; even greater force to Britisn ships uponthe A copy ©f this letter has been sent to Office* I am etc* sd.

Persian interference with Arab dhows . is ii / , • / With reference to your letter M.03427/37 of the 10th September 1937, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to transmit to you, to be laid before the Lord Comrais ioners of the Admiralty, the accompanying copies of correspondence with His 4 ' P Majesty^ Minister at Tehran, in the course of which Mr. Seymour makes certain observations regarding the attitude to be adopteqL by the Commanding Officers of His Majesty’s ships % in case of Persian interference with Arab dhows. 2. As Their Lordships will see from paragraph 3 of Mr 0 Seymours despatch, he considers that any incident involving one of His Maj'esty’s ships and an Iranian vessel, in waters which, although beyond the three mile limit, are claimed by the Iranian Government as territorial, would give rise to great bitterness, and that it is therefore preferable to avoid the risk of any such incident occuring. 3 0 Lord Halifax is aware that interference by a Persian ship with an Arab dhow is more likely to take place in waters near the Persian coast and an oral assurance has, moreover, already been given by the Persian Government that Persian warships will not molest Arab vessels in Arab territorial waters or on the high seas. At the same time, while fully conscious of the ill-feeling which would result if one of His Majesty’s ships were to take measures involving a Persian /ves sel The Secretary of the Admiralty©/ vessel within the six mile limit, His Lordship realises that the effect produced on the Rulers of the Arab coast if one of His Majesty^ ships failed to protect a dhow in waters which, as the Arab Rulers know perfectly well. His Majesty^ '-rovernraent do not regard as Persian territorial waters, might be equally unfortunate. It is, moreover, probable / that Persian susceptibilities would be outraged in whatever waters the incident occurred* 4* Lord Halifax is therefore of the opinion that /the balance of advantage lies in including waters outside the but within the six mile limit, three mile limitj^/in the scope of the proposed Admiralty instruct ions. do His Lordship is, however, anxious that, in the issue oi tnese instructions the following points should be smphasis ed: (a) That the instructions must be carried out (as he has no doubt Their Lordships intend) with utmost tact and discretion, and force be used only in the very last resort. (b) That in all cases, and not only in arms cases. His Majesty's ships shall inform the Persian vessel that they axe themselves prepared to verify the flag and the papers of the dhow in question, to see, if the circumstances warrant it, that it proceeds to its alleged destination, and, if there is any Jg-irca facie reason to suspect that an offence has been committed, to ensure that the offence is duly investigated and punished. /6.6e Lord Halifax is,however, most anxious that every effort should, be made, compatible with the proper performance of their duties by His Majesty’s ships, to avoid an incidence in any waters oi the Persian Gulf, more especially in the present time of unsettled international relations and having regard to the importance of the oil supplies derived from Persian territory. 7. His Lordship therefore urges that the instructions issued to the Commanding Officers of His Majesty’s ships should make this point abundantly clear and that the general Admiralty instructions should be accompanied by further (possibly secret) instructions to the effect that His Majesty' Government are anxious to avoid an incident within six miles of tne Persian coast even more than elsewhere on the high seas and that although the s&amp;oe action must, if the necessity inevitably arises, be taken within those limits as in the rest of the Ghlf, commanders of ships should, if possible, contrive to avoid situations arising in which their ships are IrKely to ce upon the scene when a dhow is stopped by a Persian vessel within the six mile limit. The simplest way of avoiding such situation's not to enter the six mile limit, and it is presumably usually possible for His Majesty's ships, except in one or two places where the main sea routes may pass near Persian islands, not to do so at all except when going to o£ from Persian ports&lt;» 8 * A copy of this ietter is being sent^the India Office and to Tehran, / I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, Sd. LACY BAGGALLAY.P*Z*2268/1938 PCRSIGN OFFICE S.W.l. Ho* 5« (E 7391/1339/91) 6th January 1938. \ I ^Vith reference to your despatch Ho.295 (543/2/37) of the 31st July last regarding Persian interference with Arab dhows, I transmit for your information the accompanying copies of correspondence with the Admiralty as to the attitude to be adopted in the event of such incidents recurring. The India Office concur in the views expressed by the Admiralty. 2. In view of the oral assurances'given to you by the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs that Persian warships have been instructed not to molest Arab vessels in future either in Arab territorial waters or bn the high seas, I agree that the question of a formal warning to be addressed to the Persian Government may be left in abeyance, to be re considered if a further incidence should occur. This does not, however, affect the main question of the principle namely how far one of His Majesty’s ships ought, in fact, \ 'V to go in order to protect an Arab dhow from interference. 9 Jf( yF; rvut'h t / v arising out of your despatch Ho. 147 of the 21st April last, 3. As you will see, the Admiralty consider it important that in the Persian Gulf, as elsewhere, His Majesty’s ships • ' . t. Av should have clear authority to use force if this is necessary in order to prevent interference with any British or British protected vessel, not only as regards Arab territorial waters, /but also H.J. Seymour Esq., C.M.G etc., et Co, etc©, Tehran. C.V.O., etc©,but also as regards the high sees and waters claimed by Persia as Persian territorial waters, but not admitted as such by His Majesty’s Government; and they suggest the issue of new instructions to this effect, with the addition of certain provisions to cover the possibility that a Persian warship might attempt to justify its action by alleging that an Arab dhow was engaged in the arms traffic* H 4 0 Subject to your further observations, I am disposed to consider that the Admiralty view of this problem is the correct one and to concur in the issue of instructions on the lines which the Admiralty propose, on the following conditionss- (a) Thajfc it shall be emphasised (as it may be safely assumed that the Admiralty intend) that the instruct ions must be carried out with the utmost tact and discretions and force used only in the very last res ort • (b) That in all cases, and not only in arms cases, His ifejesty’s ships shall inform the Persian vessel that they are themselves prepared to verify the flag and the papers of the dhow in question, to see, if the circumstances warrant it, that it proceeds to its alleged destination, and if there is any prima faci e reason to suspect that an offence has been committed, to ensure that the offence is duly investigated and punished* 5* With regard to the particular point about the action to be taken in waters claimed by the Persian Government as territorial waters, but not admitted as such by His Majesty’s Government, I am advised that in legal proceedings regarding aclaim to territorial rights over waters more than three miles from the Persian coast it would in all probability be found that: (1) If His Majesty’s Government were plaintiffs before an international tribunal asking for judgment to the effect that Persia is not entitled to excereise territorial right in waters more than three miles from the Persian coast, His Majesty’s Government would lose their case* {2) If the Persian Government were plaintiffs asking for judgment to the effect that His Majesty’s Govern ment must recognise a Persian claim to the excercise of territorial rights in waters more than three miles from the Persian coast, the Persian Government would lose their case. The law is in fact uncertain and it is likely that the litigant who had to prove his case would fail. In any proceedings arising out of the action of one of His Majesty’s ships in preventing Persian vessels from operating against Arab vessels in waters lying between three and six miles ff*om the Persian coast, Persia would be the plaintiff and His Majesty’a Government 1 could probably regard the outcome of the proceedings with equanimity. '• ^ \*^ ' , - % * ■ 6* The Admiralty and the India. Office agree, in the light of the information contained in the despatch Ho. 295 of the 31st %• July, and especially in view of the fact that the Persian Government seem to be unaware of :the provisions of the Muscat proclamation of 1898, that it would be inadvisable openly to cancel the pr ociamat ions of the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait / and the Sultan of Muscat. fi I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, Your obedient Servant, Sd 0 lacy Baggallay. (Por Neville Chamberlain)U.02431/38 18th July 1938 31 Confident ial . Sir, I am commanded by sly Lords Commissioners of tne Admiralty to acquaint you, for the information of Lord Halifax, that they have had under consideration your letter E 968/162/91 of the 30th March, 1938, concerning the action to be taicen by Commanding Officers of M.M* ships in the Persian Oulf to protect Arab dnows against interference by Persian ships* 2. My Lords note that Lord Halifax considers that the balance of advantage lies in including waters off the Iranian coast outside the three-mile limit, but within the six-mile limit, in the scope of the proposed instructions authorising Commanding Officers to use force in the last resort to prevent interference on the high seas. Lord Halifax then suggests, however, that in order to reduce the risk of a serious incident within the six-mile limit, further, possibly sennet,instruct ions should be given to Commanding Officers that they should, so far as possible contrive to avoid witnessing incidents which may occur within the six-mile limit. 3. My Lords have given careful consideration to Lord Halifax’s suggestion, but regret that they are unable to agree that Commanding Officers* discretion should be llmi- -ted by such secret instructions. They do not consider that it would be in fact practicable to instruct H.M. Ships not to enter/enter the six-mile limit* It v/ould not, for instance, be possible, without serious detriment to our prestige for H*M ships patrolling outside the six-mile limit either to ignore an incident which they may observe witnin the 8 ix- -mile limit, or fail to pursue, if necessary, an offending Persian vessel up to the limit of waters claimed by us as the high seas. The damage to our prestige would be all the more serious if, as would now be thee ase, it were public knowledge that we had authorised resistance to Persian interference outside Persian territorial waters. It would therefore seem necessary, if tne rials: of incidents is to be avoided in the inann er sedges ted by lord Halifax for H.M.Ships to be instructed to keep, not only outside the six mile limit, but at a distance from it sufficient to ensure that they did not witness any incident occurring within the six miles, or likely to involve pursuit beyond that limit. a £y Lords do not, however, consider that any such instruction would be desirable in principle or practical; those suggested by Lord Halifax would, not, in fact, avoid the risk of incidents, and would, My Lords consider, merely introduce an undesirable element of doubt in Commanding Officers* instructions which would make decision in particular \ cases difficult and embarass ingr /vs explained in . A/’***' Admiralty letter M.034S7/37 of the 10th Septeraner', 1937, they do not consider that the risk of a serious incident arising is great, and, for the reasons explained above, they would be glad if Lord Halifax could agree to the issue of the instruc- -tions without the proposed reservation. Lords have also considered the propoa^al that H.M.Ships should undertake to see that suspected vessels proceed/-proceed to their alleged destination, and that offences are investigated and punished. To be effective, this would involve escorting trie dhow to its alleged destina- -txon. The actual destination of such dhows would presumably be generally within Persian waters* the alleged destination might be anywhere, and an undertaking to escort suspected dhows would therefore be unacceptable for operational reasons. As regards the investigation and punishment of offences, ThCer Lordfthips consider that the proposal in paragraph 9 of Admiralty letter of lOtirt beptember, 1937, would be sufficient to cover cases of suspected arms running. It is observed, however, that the act ivities of Persian warsnips appear at present to be mainly directed towards the suppression of smuggling, and its would not seem possible for ary undertaking to be given that offences which are offences against Persian law will be investigated and punished elsewhere.

If the Iranian ship does not thereupon releaserelease the Arab vessel, H.M.Ship is to take the latter in tow, and adopt sueh measures as may be necessary to ensure that no further interference occurs# 4# If the Iranian ship opposes such action with force the Commanding Officer of H#M,3hip is authorised to use such force as may be necessary to effect the release of the Arab vessel* 5# If the Iranian -ship attempts to justify her action by alleging that the Arab vessel is engaged in the arms traffic, the Commanding Officer of H#M#3hip should reply that if the allegation proves correct he will see that the offenders are properly dealt with in accordance with the laws to which they are subject} and he is subsequently to take the necessary measures in collaboration with the Political Resident and his staff to ensure that this promise is fulfilled# 6# If an incident occurs within the six mile limit but outside the three mile limit off the Iranian coast, and the Iranian ship justifies its action on the ground that these waters are Iranian territorial waters, the Commanding Officer of H. II. Ship is to reply that H.M. Government does not recognise such waters as territorial and that he cannot permit interference with Arab shipping outside the three mile limit* t i 7# The utmost tacy and discretion are to be employed in dealing with any dispute which may airse, and every endeavour is to be made to obtain the release of the Arab vessel without the use of force, which should be employed only in the very last resort# Commanding Officers-3- Ssr Officera must, however, decide on their own judgement whether a aituation has arisen requiring forcible measures. ■ : - C' .W J BY COMMAND OS’ THSIH LOKDSHH^S.

Hassan bin Qamba was a member of a crew in a Persian sailing boat, Nakhuda Ali bin Mohamed Irani. A Bahrain Nakhuda, Ali bin Abdulla Nairn!, saw him on the customs pier and informed the Passport head natur that he was an Iranian policeman and the man who had detained him in Maghu. Hassan was taken to the Police Station as it was thought he might be an informer or agent. After being questioned by the Superintendent of Police there seemed no reason to suppose that he was a foreign agent. He was released and the Nakhuda was ox*dered to file a case against him. A civil case was beared in the court of the Indian Assistant and Hassan was discharged and returned to Persia in the boat in which he had come. While in Bahrain he was confined to his boat, because he stated that he was one of the Persian Police. He had no visa but was one of the seven members of crew of the Persian dhow belonging to Nakhuda Ali bin Mphamed Irani. The crew were registered on arrival in the usual way. There is nothing to prevent members of the Iranian Police or military forces coming to Bahrain as crew of dhows and landing in Bahrain.

His Majesty's Government regarded the action of the Iranian authorities as merely the logical outcome of the Iranian claim to Bahrain, but a protest was made to the Iranian Government, to which a most unsatisfactory reply was received. I do not think that there is anything to be gained by lodging a protest ever the present incident as it will doubt less evoke an equally unsatisfactory reply. 3d/- C. 'j.

Monsieur le Ministre, I have the honour to direct the attention of Your Excellency to the increasingly frequent practice of interference by Iranian naval vessels with Koweiti and other Arab dhows, and to refer in particular to two recent cases of such interference which have been brought to the notice of His Majesty^ Government. 2. His Majesty*s Government are informed s (1) that on the 11th March one dhow was stopped at a point 30 miles North West of the island of Kh/arg by an Iranian naval ve^el which caused serious damage in coming alongside. It appears that the boarding party failed to board the dhow owing to heavy seas; (2) that on the 18th March two dhows were stopped by an Iranian naval vessel 18 miles from the nearest point of the Iranian shore in the vicinity of Tahirl. Both these dhows were boarded and searched. A few articles were stolen and in each case a sum of $s 1,000 was demanded, although the dhows were eventually released upon payment of a small levy. 3. I am to point out to Your Excellency that the dhows concerned in these incidents, which were returning to Koweit from India, were flying the flag of Koweit and were stationed well outside Iranian territorial waters when they were intercepted. I am therefore to ask you to be so good as to arrange for the issue of instructions to Iranian naval vessels not to interfere with foreign dhows on the high seas. I am further to emphasize that this practice of stopping koweiti and other Arab dhows on the high seas is likely to lead only to constant friction which it is the earnest desire of His Majesty*s Government to avoid. 4. I shall be grateful to receive Y8ur Excellency*s assurance that adequate measures will be taken by the competent Imperial authority to prevent a recurrence of such interference. 5. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration.
