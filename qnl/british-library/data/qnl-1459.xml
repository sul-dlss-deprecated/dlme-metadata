With regard to the title ' Khan of Beloochistan,' Captain Jlarrison reports that he had no Political Superintendent's letter No. 1127, dated 4th August 1870. r j.i „ • 1 ' 0 lurther meanuifr m using it than as referring to His Highness as Sovereign of this country. Under these circumstances if the Political Agent ceases to use it, and the Khelat Government does not assume it, or base any claims upon it, I have nothing more to say on the subject, except that I still retain the opinion that the Khelat Government had a design in adopting it, although Captain Harrison does not know it. 3. Indeed, from what follows, it will be seen that the Seistan corres pondence which first brought it to notiee, is still going on—vide letter No. 03, attached, and the Diary. 4.

I have just received copies of the Cabool Diary for May 1870, which tend to throw some light on this subject from the opposite side of the border;( 2 ) and tliey mark these Beloocli to be as arrant plunderers as any on the face of the earth ; a fact which is nothing new to those who are acquainted with their history. The Cabool Diary of 16th May says— ' A letter reached the Ameer from Meer Afzul Khan, ruler of Furrah, to the effect that the men of Beloochistan will not refrain from plundering the ' subjects of Affghanistan, but continue day and night to commit robberies and tf aggressions, and that unless some arrangements are made for putting a stop &lt;c to such evils, the people of Affghanistan will be completely trampled upon.' G. These are the new correspondents of the Khan, and it is odd, to say the least of it, that whilst great indignation is being expressed at his Court, because the Ameer of Cabool befriended the refugee Sirdars, an affectionate correspondence should spring up at Khelat with men who are evidently giving a a'ood deal of trouble to the Ameer Shere Ali. Indeed, it will be seen from the Cabool Diary of the 10th May, that the Persians also complain of Belooch depredations, and that Zamool Abudin has gone to Cabool on the part of Alum Khan, the Persian Governor of Kain, to confer with the Ameer on the subject. 7. These facts, combined with the contents of the last para, of Surfuraz Khan's letter about Azad Khan, and the Ameer's Durbar, and the utterly improbable statement that the Ameer told him {Surfuraz Khan) to loot the Sungranees, i. e. Ibrahim Khan of Kuchansoor, afford, to my apprehension, an unmistakeable key to the whole movement so far as the Khelat Government is concerned, though the Political Agent sees uo more in it than appears on the surface. The letters now produced may have been written for our informa tion, so as to enhance the Khan's influence in our eyes, and we have no idea what the private communications, which always accompany such documents, contained. 8. 'With regard to the concluding para, of Captain Ilarrisons Diary as to the ' perfect quiet of Beloochistan during the past week,' the extensive Murree raid reported in my letter No. 1199, of the 21th instant, will have shown how imperfect the quiet of Beloochistan yet is. At the end of a year, in the face of a full account of the occurrences of that year—could such be obtained—we might speak with approximate accuracy on the subject, but not 1 think at the close of such short periods as a week or a month. i I have, &amp;c.., II. PHAYPtE, Colonel, Political Supdt., U. S. Frontier.( 3 ) No. G7 of 1870. From, Captain C. H. IIahuisox, Political Agent, Khelat. To, The Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind. KJielat, 215^ August 1870. Sir, In acknowledging the receipt of your letter No. 1151, of the IStli instant, I have the honor to inform you that in official correspondence His Highness designates himself ' Khan of Khelat.' o # 2. The official seal of the Agent at this Court has always been ' Politi cal Agent Beloochistan and Magistrate Frontier Upper Sind;' my using the title fC Khan of Beloochistan' had no further meaning than alluding to His Highness as Sovereign of this country.

Sir, I have the honor to forward for your information, and that of higher au thority, letters from Siestan placed at my disposal by His Highness the Khan.( 4 ) 2. Tt will be soon from their perusal that they have been sent without any solicitation on His Highness' part; the replies, when written, will I feel sure be in accord with your wishes. 3. These Beloocli evidently look upon themselves as outcasts, and would like the Khan to be their ruler. His Highness, liowever, has enough responsibi lity looking after his own immediate territory, without voluntarily interfering on their behalf. As Belooch, he of course feels an interest in their welfare. 4. Sirdar Surfuraz Khan's nephew, Meer Sulla, lias not yet arrived. I have &amp;c., ♦ v. - ' L . - — C. H. HARRISON, Captain, Political Agent, Khelat. P. S.—I have delayed this correspondence in hopes of being able to get some geographical information from a Seistanee residing at Khelat, his descrip tion of the country was so confused, and diffefed so materially from Colonel Walker's map, that I have not recorded what he said. C. H. H. From Surfaraz Khan, Sirdar of tin Sungrances, Chagee, io Ills Highness the Khan of Khelat and Beloochistan. After salutations. —Of your kindness don't be estranged from us. Sirdar Kumal Khan Tokee has sent me a letter, which I forward for your perusal. Wc Belooch look upon you as our head. What is going on in Siestan, and what the Gujjurs are doing, will be understood from perusal of the letter above quo ted ; we have norther hope except in you. The Gujjurs and Siestanees, aided by the Persian Government, create all sorts of disturbances in this country, in fact there is no peace, you are our only support. Since the receipt of Kumal Khan's letter I have sent my nephew, Meer Sulla. We are not able to cope with the Gnj jurs, without assistance, and will only act on your advice ; whatever ill-fate befalls the Bclooch in this part of the country must reflect upon you. The Ameer of AtMianistan has for the third time re-arranged the boundaries from O &gt;- ^ Chuckansoor to the right bank of the river Hodebar, going towards Kandahar, has been given to Aftghauistan, and the left bank made over to the Gujjurs (Persians). Neither the Persians or Affghans have claimed us as their subjects, and we are therefore open to be plundered and ill-used by cither party. If( 5 ) you will only take up our cause and write to Goolam Iloossem, Meer Alum Beerjundee and Shureef Khan, tlicy will leave us alone. If you cannot support us, Brahooees and Belooch, let me know, and I shall come to Khelat. If you can assist us actively, we will fight, if not, as a friend of the English Government, I hope you will intercede with them on our behalf. I had intended to pay a per sonal visit to you, I have however assembled the Belooch to fight, and if I went away, they would disperse over the country. I am awaiting your instructions ; if you wish to see me, I will come at once, or if you will give us aid, we can hold our own patiently in this country; write and comfort us. To the same purport as the letter to His Highness the Khan. From Sirdar Kuraal Khan Tokee to Sirdar Surfuraz Khan Sunjranee. After Salutations. —Vukeels arrived from the Governments of Persia and Affghanis- tan, at the wish of the English Government, to restore property plundered from the Pathans by the Seistanees, also that the property plundered from Kafilas by the Seistanees should be restored to the Persians. From the 27th Augusta man of responsibility and posi tion will reside in the town of Siestan, and Goolam Hoossein with a force will occupy it. Beerjund Goolam Hoossein, the Persian Surteep, is prepared to act in a friendly manner towards the Ameer of AfFghanistan. From Chuckansoor to Rodebar is to be under the Affghan Government, and the other side of the river under the Persians. The Belooch country is without a ruler, and under no control. Wherever the Belooch are settled, they look upon His Highness the Khan as their ruler, and an ally and friend of the English Government. Consider over what I have written, and send a trust-worthy man to His Highness. If he will only represent our case to the English Government, everything will be well. Sirdar Azad Khan ' by word' is a friend of His Highness, but ' in heart' an enemy. I was present at the Ameer's Durbar the other day, when he said ' that he was a subject of the Ameers, and had nothing to say to the Belooch ; also that when I went to Surshela on the Siestan border, that he was at Cabool, and that none of his men were present with me.' The Ameer suggested that I should collect people and plunder the Sunjranees, or leave the country. I am helpless, and have therefore written to you. (True substance.) C. H. HARRISON, Captain, Political Agent, Khelat and Beloochistan. From Swrfuraz Khan to Shagassee Wullee Mahomed. (True substance.) C. H. HARRISON, Captain, Political Agent, Khelat and Beloochistan. Diary hy the Political Agent, Khelat, from loth to 21s£ August 1870. On Tuesday, the 16th, Sirdar Meetah Khan Shaook arrived at Khelat, and paid me a visit on the following day. His account of Beyla appeared to be satisfactory, substance of( 6 ) the conversation was communicated, agreeably to the instructions of Government, in m} letter No. 66 to the Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind. His Highness informed me on the 16th that at Sirdar Fucpiir Mahomed s iccjuost, he proposed sending Naib Mahomed Ivhan to Kedj, and that Peer Jan, the ^aibs son, had been directed to join me. On re-considering the subject, His Highness did not think it advisable to remove Naib Mahomed Khan from Cutchee, and therefore deputed Attah Mahomed, Daroga, to accompany Sirdar Faquir Mahomed. The object of the Sirdar is to have an experienced Revenue Officer, and a small detachment of Infantry and Cavalry. On Thursday His Highness was married to the sister of the Punchgoor Sirdar, Gazee Khan. On the 19th translations of letters from Siestan were forwarded under cover of letter No. 63 to the Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind, no replies have been sent by His Highness. A report was received here through a Syud, residing at Shawl, that the Ameer had withdrawn his troops from Kandahar to Cabool, and that Sirdar Moolah Mahomed Noordeen and others were intending to pay the Ameer a visit. A letter just received by His Highness from the Zuggur Mingul Sirdar, Abdool Keho- man Khan, gives the following news :— After Salutations. —Sirdar Kumal Khan of Bundur writes to me as follows— ' c A Vukeel went from the Ameer of Affghanistan to Tehran, and the English Go- ff vernment wrote to the Shah of Persia to the following effect—that he had unjustly inter- ' fered with the Belooch and Pathans in Siestan, and that he must refrain from so doing ' for the future, or there would be misunderstanding between the Governments. ' The following arrangements were then agreed upon « 1st.—That the Shah and Persian territory should be handed over to the Gujjurs or ' Persians. ' 2nd.—That the Pathan country should be handed over to the Ameer of Affghanistan. ' 3rd.—That the Belooch possessions should be made over to Sirdar Ibrahim Khan r Sunj ranee. « A letter was received from the Shah by his subordinate. They sent for Sirdar Ibra- ' him Khan and told him that he was at liberty to take possession of all his towns and ' possessions. Sirdar Ibrahim Khan refused, and said he did not acknowledge their instruc- ' tions, and would not move in the matter until they gave up the town of Deh, which ^ had been given as a marriage-portion by his father to his sister, the mother of Siulai ' Shureef Khan Narovee. That if they choose to return this village, he would ^ consent. ' Moonshee Ali Khan wrote to Alum Khan of Beerjund asking for instructions. The Nooskhy Sirdar states that no reply had been received from Beerjund, that if Deh is given up, boundaries will be settled between the Persians, Affghans and Belooch, if not, that reference will have to be made to the Shah. There has been perfect quiet in His Highness' territory during the past 'week. C. H.
