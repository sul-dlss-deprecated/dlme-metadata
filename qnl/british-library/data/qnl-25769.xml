Pear Sir, I have just returned from Holland and received your letter, and am quite appalled to think that any action on my part should have caused any dissatisfaction. Sheikh of Koweit and the British authorities there, I was enabled to make the beginnings of a film which was intended to show all the various stages of Pearl production, and I certainly promised to present the Sheikh with a finished copy when it was completed. Very naturally I shall carry out my promise, but up till the present time it has been impossible to complete the closing sequences of the film, hence it has never been finished. July 1938 and for the next five months was engaged in cutting and finishing the three pictures which were the principal object of my visit to the Far East, namely a 4000-ft film of the K.L.M. route to the Butch East Indies, a 'short” describing a journey into South Tibet, and a 2-reel picture in colour dealing with the Toradja people of Celebes. In January I went out to Switzerland under contract to make a short Winter Sports film and immediately on my return had to go to Oalifomia on a business trip to Hollywood. When I got back in May I set to work on a natural history film off the west coast of Scotland, as that is the only time of year when it can be done. From this you will appreciate that there has been absolutely no time in which to complete the Pearling film. I have, however, already made arrangements with the Goldsmiths &amp; Silversmiths Company for the production of the final scenes of the picture, in which all the stages of the stringing and mounting of the pearl will be seen, with the Finale located in their Showrooms. These will probably be shot in the autumn and the finished film should be Trade Shown in Bovember. Sheikh at the first opportunity, and I repeat my very sincerest that the matter should have caused any ill-feeling. • rvfO-r'l It is perfectly true that, through the kindness of the Briefly, the facts are as follows. I arrived home in You may rest a; ured that a copy will be sent to the RECo. POL. DEPt. ■J1JUL1939 INDIA OFFICE Yours faithfully□ P.Z.4121/39. Dear Sir, IlTDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.' ,T .l. 18th July 1939. 19 JUIB59 6 I am desired to write to you on a matter connected with your visit to Koweit, for the purpose of making a film, in 1938. The authorities in the Persian Gulf have reported that on the strength of the recommendations in your favour from responsible people in this country you enjoyed the fullest assistance of the Sheikh of Koweit during your visit and that on its successful termination you promised him a copy of the film. It appears, however, that the Shaikh has not yet received the film, and the result has been to create a very bad impression on His Highness, who feels that he has been treated with discourtesy. This is felt to be most unfortunate, as you will no doubt agree. It is understood that the Shaikh would still greatly appreciate your sending him the film which you promised and I am to express the hope that you will be able to meet his wishes at your very early convenience.

OOPY SENT BY AIR MAIl^ c af /l / Yours faithfully,FILE COPY D,Q.2fo»583-S iTie Residency, Bus^iire, the 2lst June, 1939 1 enclose a copy of a letter from Galloway whxch explains itself* Rankin after the help extended to him appears to have been extremely casual in not fulfilling his promise to supply the Shaikh with a copy of the film, and in not even replying to de Gaury* ihe result is a bad impression on the Shaikh, which is unfortunate. 2. As the Foreign Office, in the person of Hendel, recommended uankin*s visit to Kuwait, could you please ask them to get in touch with Kankin and ask him to full 11 his promise. R.T.Peel Esquire, MO., The India Office London. - 3 JUL 1939 INDIA OFFICE j^—D.O. No. 3^/ Political Agency, Kuwait 12th June, 1939 My dear Sir Trenchard, I arc writing to ask your help in what may at first sight appear to he a small matter, hut this dis courtesy has made a very had impression on the Shaikh* in December, 1937, mentioning one Hoyer-lUllar, at that time a private secretary to Men, as reference, with the request that he might he allowed to come filming in Kuwait* Eventually even Ilendel wrote recommending Rttnkin to de Gaury* 3* Hank in duly appeared and every one concerned, &gt;# 3 &gt; doubtless spurred hy the reco.amendations, put themselves out to help him. The Shaikh, I am told, was particularly helpful. At the termination of a successful visit # - Rankin apparently promised the Shaikh a copy of the film. Since than nothing has been heard from aankin, though de Gaury wrote reminding him of his promise. 4. As the Shaikh often nrentions the matter of this unkept promise and wants the film, whether from motives of personal vanity or what does not matter, do you think you could write to some one at the India Office to see if there is a chance of getting the film? I am sure that if we could get a copy of the film for the Shaikh he would he most appreciative. Yours sincerely Sd. A.C. Galloway.
