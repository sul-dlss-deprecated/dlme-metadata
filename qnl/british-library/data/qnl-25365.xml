External. t / To The Most Hon’ble the MARQUESS of CREWE, K.G., Mis Majesty's Secretary of State for India* Simla, the 8th October 1914. My Lord Marquess, We have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with Your Lordship’s telegram of the 4th February 1913, sanctioning the deputation of a geologist to examine the question of the water-supply at Kuwait. 2 . Mr. E. H. Pascoe, of the Geological Survey of India was deputed to * Enclosure No 1 inspect geological conditions in Kuwait, E • _ and in his report, a copy* of which is enclosed, he recommended that trial borings should be made, but, owing to the uncertainty of obtaining potable water and to the very large cost involved, we decided not to make experiments in this direction. The alternative course of installing a condensing plant at Kuwait appeared to us to have the advantage of certain success and we accordingly asked our Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to obtain from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company an estimate for such plant producing 100,000 gallons per 24 hours, together with estimates of other initial and recurring expenditure. 3. These have now been received and we have the honour to forward, for Your Lordship’s information, a copy of the correspondence detailed in the schedule attached. The initial cost of the installation is estimated at £12,500 or Rs. 1,87,500 and the working expenses at Rs. 80,000 a year, but the latter amount will be slightly increased if a European Engineer is employed. We consider this desirable on the grounds of efficiency and for reasons given in our Political Resident’s letter No. Cf. 59, dated the 26th July 1914. 4. The machinery to be employed is designed by specialists in this class of plant and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who are a British firm of reputation and who, owing to their proximity to Kuwait and their knowledge of local conditions are evidently in the best position to undertake the work, can, we consider, be safely entrusted with the contract for which they have tendered. The Shaikh’s interests will be adequately secured if the firm agrees to the further condition that the plant should be handed over to the Shaikh in full working order and yielding the estimated supply of water, after it had been worked by them for at least 3 months after the installation. As the Shaikh has no funds available, we propose to grant him a loan of £12,500 without interest for the purpose of financing the scheme, and would solicit Your Lordship’s sanction thereto.L i feipsrpr' :: I . “’ir r. ■ * ' T,- - i i:'- ft!;;!!!:--/.::;:;':;:;'' | ■ ■h»'fr .r.,,;: I Ifg'-'’::: I nr) B;':' •r' 1 ' { ^SSS'-KP*-'' IWnin (if 1 *:-. m&amp;Sm mlPI list 5. The question of the water-supply at Kuwait ^ is an urgent and pressing necessity, and we consider it moreover of political importance to oblige the Shaikh in this matter. The revenue to the Shaikh from the sale of water is expected to leave him a sufficient margin, after paying working expenses, to enable him to repay the loan by regular monthly instalments of at least Us. 6,000. Loans previously granted to the Shaikh have always been recovered without difficulty and he has just remitted to us the first instalment due on account of the lean made to him this year with Your Lordship’s sanction conveyed in your telegram of the 2nd January 1914. We have the further security in the sum of £4,000 paid annually to the Shaikh on account of the rent of the Bandar Shuwaikh foreshore. We would, however, recommend that, as in the case of the recent loan referred to above, His Majesty’s Treasury will bear half the loss, if any, on the transaction and also half the loss of interest on this loan. 6 . As the matter is urgent, we would request that Your Lordship’s sanc tion may be communicated to us by telegraph.

H. Pascoe, Assistant Superintendent in this Department, on the prospects of obtaining potable water by artesian boring at Koweit on the Persian Gulf. °CONFIDENTIAL Rocks at Koweit. Prospects of obtaining potable water by artesian boring at Koweit on the Persian Gulf. I arrived on the 20 th February, 1913, and spent a fortnight in and around ^ . w Koweit, endeavouring to form an opi ate an oca i y. n - on &amp;g ^ na ^ U j, e an( j &amp; g e 0 £ country-rock below the sand, and the likelihood of its capability of retaining water fit for drinking purposes. ‘ Koweit lies on the coast of the Arabian Desert, in a small arm of the Persian Gulf at its north-western extremity. The desert stretches inland for at least 200 miles, without a hill-range and probably without an exposure of rock. There are no exposures at Koweit, and the only hard rock found is the ‘ ‘ Litoral Rag ” or “ Concrete ’ ’ mentioned by Dr. Pilgrim as common in the Gulf. Below the surface, at various inconstant hori zons, pebbles and sand are occasionally cemented together into calcareous or gypseous bands sufficiently coherent to influence the under ground flow of surface water. Around Koweit an efflorescent salt, similar to that found in Burma near exposures of Pegu beds and to the ‘ ‘ Reh ’ ’ of India, is common on the surface, especially in damp places. A foot or so below the surface a band of gypsi ferous sand, some 9 inches to IJ feet thick, is very commonly found, the gypsum is derived from subjacent Tertiary beds. With the aid of surface fires this material is partially dehydrated, and the product known as “jus ”, containing a certain amount of ‘ ‘ plaster of Paris ’ ’ and perhaps a little lime, is used as a cement for building purposes. This small industry covers quite a large area. Most of the water obtained from surface wells (from 10 to 20 feet deep) is slightly brackish. By the kindness of Captain Shakespear, Political Agent at Koweit, I was able to visit for a couple of days a low hill known as Wara and some small knolls, and rising ground, known as Burqan, 24 miles south of Koweit. These, fortunate- „ T J ^ ly, are of Tertiary rock, though of very ara an urqan. limited extent only. Wara is a small truncated cone, some 20 to 25 yards across its flat top, and projecting 50 or 60 feet above the desert plain. It is capped by a conglomerate and conglomeratic sandstone about 4—5 feet thick ; the pebbles of the conglomerate are small and consist mostly of quartz. It lies practically horizontally, dipping in one place at 8 — 10 ° towards north-west. A glimpse of the underlying beds is obtained on one side of the hill; they appear to be identical with those seen at Burqan. The conglomerate has every appearance of a Bakhtiari bed, and for. reasons to follow it probably represents the base of this series. Burqan consists of a series of low ridge-like knolls grouped along or parallel to the perimeter of a broad ellipse, which represents in all probability a low flat dome with its longer axis running approximately from north to south. The monotony of the flat plain occupying the centre is relieved by a few additional knolls. Conglomerate or conglomeratic sandstone, exactly similar to those at Wara, caps all these knolls and ridges, and in all cases has scarcely appreciable dip. There is much sagging at the edges and a great deal of scree, but here and there it is possible to observe what lies beneath it. Below it in the easternmost ridges, I found bands of ochreous sandstone, sandy clays of variegated colours—red, pink, yellow, etc., a white kaolin-bearing sand stone, and many large fragments of selenite or crystalline gypsum. Flakes of gypsum occur in other parts of the hills and the efflorescent salt in the central plain. All this points to the exposure, or immediate proximity beneath the surface, of Dr. Pilgrim’s Fars series. I am inchned to think the Fars beds are actually exposed, the caps of conglomerate and conglomeratic sandstone represen ting the basal bed of the Bakhtiari series. The Fars exposure would be about a mile long by f mile broad. Between Koweit and Wara the desert is pebbly all the way, except in a few bare grass-less patches covered with efflorescent salt. Small shrubs also increase in number towards Wara and Burqan, Between Koweii and Wara. where they are quite plentiful . tWs may be a result of the rise of the more or less impervious Bakhtiari conglomerate to wards the surface. VI a Jm (3V) -rw4 {/ _ Kubbar and Qkarain Islands were disappofiting. The latter is about 4 miles west of Koweit, ana contains no rock except the recent litoral ragstone. The same stone w..s found all round the beach of Kubbar and Qarain Islands. Kubbar, which is 35 miles SOUth-east of Koweit. Four and-a-half miles east-south-east of this island, a smooth patch of fresh water was observed in the sea and reported by the Commander of H. M. S. “Lapwing”. A copy of this report, kindly supplied by Captain Shakespear, is appended. The geo-tectonic features appear to run, in a general way, somewhere between N.-S. and N.-W. — S.-E. This is borne out by (i) the orientation of the Burqan dome and the relative position of Wara Hill (a little west of north from Burqan), (n) by the general structure. ^ strike and trend of the Persian Gulf and Euphrates and Tigris valleys, (^) by the direction of the low flat swell-ridges observed and mapped by Captain Shakespear further inland. The eastern slope of these flat swells is considerably more gradual than the western, a cir cumstance conformable with the chart of the Gulf, which shows a very gentle eastwards shelving along the Arabian side, but a comparatively steep drop into deep water along the Persian coast. From this we may deduce that easterly dipping beds cover a greater proportion of the total area than do westerly dipping beds. The dome at Burqan is a very gentle one. This fact and general consi derations are conformable to the view that the subjacent Tertiary strata in and around Koweit have been very little disturbed by folding movements. . After these preliminaries it is possible to consider the question of finding water at Koweit by artesian boring. The Tertiary rocks beneath the thick superficial cap Water of Recent sand consist in all probability of * i. Dr. Pilgrim’s “ Fars ” series and perhaps some of the basal beds of the overlying Bakhtiaris. We have evidence for this in .* a * gypsiferous band at Koweit, the nature of the Burqan and Wara beds, e brackishness of many of the Koweit and neighbouring wells, and to some ex en the intermediate position of Koweit between an Upper Tertiary outcrop mappe y Hr. Pilgrim some 30 miles west of Basrah and the Nummulitic rocks °f re- 1 f 1 ' which Tertiary rocks occur below the surface a ov/ei , we may at least hope that the Burqan and Wara exposures denote a line of uplift whose stake would pass through Koweit and the Basrah out crop, n la a the westerly indent in the coast forming Koweit Bay may reach ^Ahi^drill e ^ &gt;reSSIOn Tertiary rocks, these rocks are not beyond the 0 ser ^ es ^ ^ porous one, and if it can be reached, water ought to be found ffco ai'm 0 - rlz&lt;m or ° 1 ! er ’ ^though it is not, I believe, been plentifully met with in . i, 0 ™ 8 ® r , lea J hwaz.

Survey of India, Volume XXXIV, Part 4.some 40 000 , and also in face of the fact that no artesian experiments have ever been made along this coast, I have no hesitation in strongly recommending trial borings at Koweit. The great element of uncertainty seems to me well worth ignoring on account of the great importance of the object. One of the most hopeful signs is the reported occurrence of fresh water off Kubbar Island mentioned above. Cap tain Shakespear and I were unable to find this, but there is a well-known examp e of this at Bahrein, and the “Lapwings” testimony is quite definite enough. 1 do not think this water can have come from the Shatt-el-Arab ; in the first place, fresh water being less dense than salt, there would be a connecting strip of fresh water between Kubbar and the Shatt-el-/frab, and, in the second place, the distance seems too great. It is far more likely that there is a submarine spring. As drilling would be undertaken more or less blindly, no local spot, as far as is known, would be preferable to any other; I should select one unlikely to be contaminated with foul surface water, convenient for the inhabitants, and removed as far as possible from the 4 4 jus’ ’ areas. The best method of drilling would be the American cable system, and the most suitable engine to work with would be an internal combustion oil-engine, since there would bej great difficulty m obta n g fresh water for a steam boiler. A suggestion made by Mr. C. B. Shaw of Messrs. Shaw and Haynes (Basrah), who has had expermece with water-wells m America, seems to me a sound one, namely, to procure at first a high-power engme capable of drilling to deep horizons ( 3,000 feet or more), and pipe apparatus suitable tor the exploration of depths up to about 700-800 feet. If no success were met with larger pipe and tools could be sent for and the same engine used for deeper boring. Sa water would, of course, have to be shut off by driving the pipe into clay or against a hard bed and perhaps the addition of hydraulic cement; this is a delicate operation and requires experienced supervision. As each water sand encountered shou , whenever feasible, be tested as to its freshness, a good deal of under-reaming w probablyfbe entailed and progress consequently slow. The whole apparatus co d subsequently be used for similar experiments in Bushire, Masqat and elsewhere , Dr. Pilgrim was inclined to think deep wells in Masqat would meet with water m quantity.* There seems to be much irregularity in the dfetribution of salt so that the greater the number of test-wells the better. Dr. Pilgrim remarks that m Bahrein Island, of two wells sunk within a few yards of each other, the one may be brackish a nd the other sweet. * *ljot 7 on 7 sitelor’a proposecfq^antine station inThT’Persian^ulfretcTGeneral Staff, IndiaAPPENDIX. No. 6 , dated the 25th January 1910. From—The Commander, H. M. S. “ Lapwing ”, To—His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron. I have the honour to inform you that the Master of SS. ‘ ‘ Naseri ”, Bombay Persia Steam Navigation Company, reported to me that while passing Kubba Island in his way to Kuwait he sighted heavy breakers in a position S.-75-E., 4| miles from Kubba Island. He did not stop to sound, but fixed position of breakers whilst steaming along his course. 2. He further informed me that the breakers were so sharp that he was certain that there was either rock or coral in the position reported. 3. The following remarks are submitted for consideration :—‘ ‘ Lapwing ’ ’ has frequently been in the vicinity of Kubba Island, and it was observed on each occasion there was a very considerable tide causing tide-rips in various directions according to the hours of the tide. On one occasion a suspicious-looking patch of smooth water was observed close to the position now reported. Boats were lowered and it was sounded out, and soundings were found to agree with chart, but the water was nearly fresh. The Sheikh of Kuwait informed me that this was not caused by an under-water spring, but was fresh water that had come down from the Shatt-al-Arab. 4. In conclusion, I cannot understand how we failed to see the heavy breakers reported, as “ Lapwing ” has visited Kubba Island in all sorts of weather, % G. M« Press, Simla.—No. C. 38 F.

The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, Mohammerah, giving cover to an estimate for the provision, at Kuwait, of a condensing plant producing 100,000 gallons per 24 hours, together with estimates of other initial and recurring expenditure. A copy of a letter, which has been received from the Political Agent at also enclosed. No. E. D.- 329 -T, dated Mohammerah the 4 th February 1914 . From—Messrs. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Ltd., To—J. G. LORIMER, Esq., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. We have the honour to enclose herewith a full estimate of the cost of in stalling a distilling plant of 100,000 gallons capacity at Kuwait. The plant will be capable of distilling from sea water 450 tons of drinking water per twenty-four hours, this quantity, roughly 100,000 gallons, will henptt gained distilled water, i.e., the plant will produce this amount and m addition enough to make up feed for boiler,—this is an important point as it enormously adds to the efficiency and life of plant. The plant offered is the most economical type which can be designed, giving 4^0 lbs. of water per pound of coal or 55-60 tons per ton of fue oil consumed. This result would be a great deal increased by the addition of an economiser to the boiler plant. We would point out the extremely simple construction of the plant, the tubes beintf readily accessible both above and below the tube plate, the former, being straight and of medium length, can be readily and quickly cleaned, more over as any one or more stills can be cut out of the series leaving remainder at work it will not be necessary at any time to shut down the plant for cleaning and scaling purposes ; of course this improvement on the older type plants adds a little to the cost, but it can readily be seen that this extra outlay is repaid many times over in the first year’s working. The boiler being fed with distilled water would not require cleaning, etc., more than once a year and then the who e job could be completed in three days, even this could be obviated by fitting two boilers, but we hardly think the extra expense would be warranted. The buildings required for the complete plant would be, for the distilling plant 60 feet long, 30 feet wide and 24 feet high, for the boiler and pumps 40 feet long 20 feet wide, and 15 feet high, all measurements being inside, the buildings would occupy the position below No. C.-9, dated 17th March 19x4. Kuwait, in which he offers certain observa tions on the above mentioned estimate, is Water Distilling plant for Kuwait. STILLS, ETC. BOILER, etc.The buildings could be either of galvanized iron or mud brick. Two pumps would be required besides the ordinary boiler feed pump—one to feed stills and one to feed storage tanks from stills ; for this purpose we propose a 5—10 h. p. Oil engine belted to two centrifugal pumps. The total working expenses per annum would amount to about eighty thousand rupees on a twenty days per month basis, or a little more than half a pice per gallon of water distilled. For Tanks we would suggest two fifty thousand gallons tanks, thus enabling them to be cleaned in turn without interfering at all with the continuous working of plant. We are assured this plant can be kept in continuous operation for 360 days per annum, requiring one native engineer at about Rs. 75 and 4 coolies at Rs. 13 per mensem for the care of same. We would tender for the same, and for the instruction of the operators, on a time and material basis. Herewith we append an estimate of the cost of the plant completely erected. £ Buildings in galvanized iron erected ... ... 350 Tanks in steel, with foundations erected connections ... ... ... and with • • • cleaning 750 Boiler with brickwork, stack, etc. • •• ... 95° Pumps with engines, etc., erected ... ... 200 Still, condensers and platforms therefor ... 9,862 Piping to sea, and tanks with valves ... • •• 1 .. 5° Incidentals ... ... • •• ISO Total 1 2;3 12 The foregoing prices are based on the assumption that we can obtain coolies locally at Krans two per diem, native bricks at rupees twenty-eight per thousand mud bricks at rupees two and a half per thousand and in quantity sufficient to keep the working going steadily. Our prices for pipes, etc., allow a maximum distance between sea and plant of one hundred and fifty yards, between plant and tanks fifty yards. No. C-g, dated Kuwait, the 17 th March 1914 . From— Lieutenant-Colonel W. G. Grey, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to reply to your endorsement No. 594, dated 24th Feb ruary 1914J forwarding for an expression of my views an estimate of the cost of installing a water distilling plant at Kuwait. As you are aware l have recently visited Mohammerah in order to discuss the matter with the Shaikh who was there, and with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s Engineer who was responsible for the preparation of the estimate. ... ^ notice that the length of the plot of land required for the installation wi be about fifty yards and its breadth some twelve yards. The site has not yet been decided upon owing to the Shaikh’s continued absence from Kuwait, ut he assures me that there will be no difficulty, in fact that he will probably e a le to provide a piece of ground of the dimensions required in the centre of n i| :own an( : on sea shore. I have pointed out to him that such a position will be convenient^for the majority of the purchasers of water, and will save expense owing to its proximity to the sea. The exact site can be fixed later. 3. I have represented to the Engineer of the Oil Company that coolies cannot be procured in Kuwait at less than Rs. i-8 per diem, but as only about3 forty wi be required this will not increase the estimate to any great extent. Nativ bricks, he informs me, can be landed at Kuwait at Rs. 28 per thousand, and ^ can have mud bricks made locally at a price very little exceeding that give! i.'i the estimate. All things considered, the Engineer and I are of opinion that in a^y case the initial expenditure will not exceed ;£ 12,500, at which sum it may be fixed for present purposes. 4. i he amount of water which it is suggested should be turned out is about 100,000 gallons per diem, or 25,000 kerosine oil tins full, a kerosine oil tin being the Kuwait measure, for twenty days in the month, and the working expenses on this basis are given at about Rs. 80,000 per annum. At present water is brought to Kuwait in native boats each carrying some 1,000 tins,' the number of such boats varying according to season and from other causes; and in addition 18,000 tins are brought by the Shaikh’s steamer once a fortnight. The daily sale is said to be about 8,000 tins in winter and 16,000 in summer, but in summer the demand greatly exceeds the supply and it is then that hard ship is felt. It would thus apparently be necessary during the hot weather to work the plant for more days in the month than are suggested in the estimate, but the number could be reduced during the cooler season and the yearly working expenditure remain about the same. The amount of water produced yearly at 25,000 tins per diem for twenty days in the month is slightly in excess of the estimated yearly demand. 5. The rate of sale per kerosine oil tin of water in Kuwait varies according to the season and the quantity available. In summer it is generally As. and in winter has been as low as As. per tin. Probably the best price for the Shaikh to fix at first would be As. i per tin from November to April, and As. J per tin from May to October inclusive. This, presuming that the whole amount produced was sold, would give an average income of Rs. 15,625 per mensem. The amount of initial expenditure is estimated at Rs. 1,87,500 and the average working expenses at about Rs. 6,650 per mensem. In the event of the initial expenses being advanced to the Shaikh he would be in a position to repay the amount in two years by monthly instalments giving an average of Rs. 8,000; he could also defray the monthly working expenditure, and retain for himself a small profit, all out of the income realised. After the initial expenditure had been repaid the price of water could be reduced as considered advisable. 6. I have the honour to request that this scheme may now be submitted for the favourable consideration of the Government of India, who may be asked kindly to advance the initial expenses of the installation on the understanding that the amount is repayable in two years by monthly instalments giving an average of Rs. 8,000 per mensem; repayment to commence from the date upon which the water-supply is realised.

From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Kuwait Water Supply. Please refer to your letter of March 29th 1914. It is recognised that 'primd facie it would be advantageous and convenient that work should be undertaken by A. P. 0. C., but please state whether the Shaikh of Kuwait definitely desires that A. P. 0. C. should execute the work on his behalf; whether he has been consulted in regard to the details of the estimate already submitted and generally accepts them as well as the method of repayment proposed by Political Agent. It will probably be unnecessary to call for other tenders if reply is in affirmative. It is however necessary in our own interests, as the Government of India are expected to finance the scheme, as well as those of the Shaikh, that we should assure ourselves by expert examination that the Company’s estimate is reasonable. On the data at present afforded it is impracticable to do this, and I am to request you therefore kindly to obtain urgently from the Com pany— ( 1 ) Plans showing general arrangement of plant; ( 2 ) Fuller detailed estimate of working expenses which appear 'primd facie to be at present underestimated ; (3) Complete specifications of several items of plant which it is proposed to use, especially details on which item 9862 is based.No. Cf.-U (Confidential), dated Bushire, the 8 th July 1914. From— Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in thfe Persian Gulf, To—The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Z. Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart- ent, Simla. With regard to Foreign Department telegram No. 368-S., dated 17th June 1914, on the subject of the Kuwait Water-Supply, I have the honour to report that the Political Agent, Kuwait, has been through the details of the scheme with the Shaikh, and that the latter entirely agrees with the suggestion put forward by the Political Agent in his letter No. C.-9., of March 17th, which formed an enclosure to this office letter No. 909 of March 29th. 2. In reply to the remaining queries contained in the above quoted telegram, I now forward, for the information of the Government of India, a full specification of each of the items of the plant which it is intended to use, two plans showing general arrangement of the plant, a letter received from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company giving fuller details of working expenses. Copies of this letter and of the full specifications referred to have been forwarded to Kuwait for any remarks the Political Agent may have to offer. As soon as I have received the Political Agent s comments, I will forward a further communication on the subject. No. 111-36, dated Muhammareh, the 27th June 1914. From—W. Greenwood, Esq., To Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., His Majesty’s Consul, Muhammareh. Inferring to your letter (47-C. Confidential) of the 20 th instant, herewith I enclose a copy of our original estimate for the erection of a distillation plant at Kuwait, a blue print showing general arrangement of stills, and a specification of the actual distillation plant. In answer to your queries :— ( 1 ) In the specification of plant you will get a complete list of all details on which the item £ 9,862 is based and our estimate allows for founda tions, erection, lagging, all pipe work, all brick work, and all concrete work, etc. The oil engine driven pumps we propose :— The engine would be one of 10 h. p. consuming fuel oil and driving by belts two centrifugal pumps, each requiring 4 h. p. at pulley. The pump for the sea water would have propeller in gun-metal, for the distilled water in the best close-grained cast-iron. The piping system would be fully equipped with valves, drains, vents, etc., as required to facilitate ease of working and cleaning. The boiler would be of a Lancashire type, with complete set of mountings, injectors, etc., and bricked up in workmanlike manner, complete with stack flues, and necessary dampers, converted to the use of oil fuel; the necessary oil tanks and piping being supplied and fitted. ( 2 ) We enclose a plan which shows the actual arran yment of stills, but does not show, unfortunately, the boiler or pump connections; however, we do not think that matters much. (3) In our driginal estimate we gave the working expenses per annum as 3 Rs. 80,000 or a little more than half a pice per gallon of water dis tilled, working on the bases of twenty working days per month. This is based on figures that, we are assured by Suppliers, have been realized in actual working of these plants. Fifty-five to sixty tons of water j distilled per ton of oil fuel consumed, that is, working on full load for twenty days, the plant could distil 8,000 tons of water consuming 160 tons of oil value say Es. 5,000 or for twelve months Es. 60,000, fuel for small pumping engines would amount to about Es. 1,500 per 3 C445FD2 annum, lubricating oil about Rs. 1 , 000 , repairs and overhauls, etc., say Rs. 4,500. Lighting about Rs. 1,500. Leavmg a balance of Rs. 11,500 for wages and incidentals. I do not think I can give you any more information in time for this mail but if there remains any point still requiring elucidation, I shall be pleased to try and make it clear. We have estimated very safely throughout on all costs of plant and material as we understood Captain Shakespear wanted an outside price. The 450 ton plant will consist of the same parts as the 225 ton, described in the following pages, with the exception that the various parts will be increased in size. The staging will be much heavier, each still, of which there will be six, will be 6 ' 0' diameter inside, and will contain 530-2' and 21-4 // copper tubes 6 feet long. The vapour connections between pans will be 14 // diameter and will be provided with similar cut out connections to those on the smaller plant. The vapour pipe from the last pan will connect it to a condenser, which will contain 450-l // brass tubes each 12 feet long. The internal diameter of this condenser will be 4 , -0 // . The small multiple heaters in the vapour pipes will now contain 180 square feet of copper heating surface*and for circulating water through the condensers and these heaters, we would apply a double ram pump, having rams 6' diameter and 8' stroke. Otherwise the connections and other items remain as in the case of the small installation. Specification of patent sextiple plant for the production of 225 tons of distilled water per 24= hours from sen water. Proposed for Captain Shakespear, Kuwait. Duty. —It is understood that the plant which we are proposing is capable of producing 225 tons nett of fresh water per 24 hours. That is to say, it will produce this quantity of water together with sufficient to feed the boiler which operates the plant. General.—The plant would consist of six “ Scott ” patent tubular evaporators carried on an iron and steel staging with platform and handrail together with the necessary condenser, vapour pipes and liq UO r pipes as set out in detail herewith. Staging. This will consist of two q' X7' rolled steel joists made up in con venient lengths with the necessary.fish plates for connection. These joists will form the main support and these are carried from 6 steel stanchions which will be con structed from 8 ' X 6 ' rolled steel joists fitted complete with capital and bases, hrom these mam joists will be carried the bearing joists which will carry the evap orators. There are 12 of these and each is of 6 ' X5' rolled steal joist. Platform. The above-mentioned joists also carry the platform which is of A' diamond pattern chequer plate 3' 8' wide carried along the whole front of the plant, the sides of the platform will be protected where necessary by a wrought iron hand rail carried in castnon stanchions. Ladder.—To give access to the platform for the purpose of operating the plant, we would supply a steel ladder composed of steel channels with chequer plate r.rpan.Q ^ L ® acl \. 0 l tl ' , ' se slx stills will consist of a heating system parallel top with dome and a dished bottom. These stills are carried from the staging by means ot two eastoon brackets attached to the heating system, and the brackets are each secured to the bearing joists by means of two f bolts in each. Heating System. The heating system of each effect will be 4 ' 6 ' internal dia- meterbys maximum diameter and it will beo'll'long. It will be constructed f 2 S i e /. plate ’ , vert,cal se f ms bem 8 double rivetted. The flanges at each end are oi med 1 om angle non bent and welded into an en dless ring and afterwards rivettedto tlie shell by f' rivets at 2 ' pitch. These flanges are faced on their joining surfaces after being rivetted to the shells, and consequently a true joint can be form- ed without straining. The following fittings are upon each heating system shells. On No. 1 there will be a 3' diameter hole with a forged steel facing pad, to which is attached a high pressure steam valve, and there will be another hole with a facing pad for the removal of the condensed water. This latter facing will be present on all the other holes, but instead of a 3 ' hole and facing for steam, they will be fitted with a 10 ' internal diameter mouthpiece of wrought steel to receive the vapour cdrinection. The flanges of the heating system are drilled with clearing holes for 5-8' bolts at about 3' pitch and into these holes are placed alternatively 3-8' bolts and set screws. These bolts and screws attach the tube plates to the flanges. Each tube plate is 5' l' diameter and is turned from mild steel plates which have been cold flattened, and which are thick. In these plates are cut 265 2 // diameter holes and 13-4' diameter holes for the reception of the tubes which form the heating surface. The tubes are of solid drawn copper arranged on our special rapid circulation system, which causes a free circulation of the liquor and thus gives a minimum deposit of scale. Each tube is 6 ' OJ' long and all the tubes forming the heating surface are of 14 gauge. The tubes are secured to the tube plates by expanding, and being perfect ly straight they are easily cleaned or renewed when either of these operations becomes necessary. Each system is fitted with 3-S' air cock. Top Pan .—To the top pan of each heating system is attached, by means of the bolts and crews previously mentioned, the parallel top. This is of the same diameter as the heating system, and it is 7' 6' high. It is constructed of J' steel plate with rivetted joints and it is provided with flanges bent, welded and faced exactly as described for the heating system. Mounted on each top pan is a pressure gauge, feed valve, protected gauge glcfss, manhole cover with air cock and our special anti-priming valve. The manholes which are 14'' diameter are provided with a cover fitted with handles, and the air cock is screwed into this manhole cover. Into the top of the parallel top piece is rivetted a dome formed of steel plate, dished and flanged. In the centre of this dome is rivetted a 10 ' diameter wrought steel flanged mouthpiece, and to this mouthpiece is attached the catch vessel which will be referred to later. Bottom Pan .—This is also of steel plate with angles, exactly as previously described. Each pan will be of the same diameter as the rest of the still over a distance of about 6 ', and from this point it will be dished in a similar manner to the dome piece in the top pan. Accessibility .—Eree access is given to each still by means of a manhole on the top and bottom pans. By this means the whole of the tubes in the pan are easily accessible, either for inspection or renewal, or cleaning, and we will draw your atten tion to the fact that the top pan is made of sufficient depth to allow the tubes to be taken out and passed through the manhole. This obviates the necessity for dis mantling the pan. Catch Vessel .—On the top of each still and attached thereto by bolts is one of our double baffle cust iron catch vessels which is provided as a final safeguard against boiling over. Vapour Pipes.—From the top of the catch vessel, spring vapour pipes which are of cast iron lO' inside diameter with machined flanges. These vapour pipes connect the top of the catch vessel of No. 1 pan to the heating system of No. 2 pan, and the top of the catch vessel of No. 2 pan to the heating system of No. 3 pan and so on. The vapour pipes are further flanged in such a manner that either one of the pans may be cut out for cleaning or repairs. In this way the Plant can either work C 445 FD 54 i Hi &gt;9B I 1 ___ | I s All included in complete ten der. as a sextiple or quintiple effect. The valves will all be of the full way pattern and will have cast iron bodies and gun metal valves in facings. The vapour pipes from the sixth effect will connect to a condenser. Multiple Heaters.—In each length of vapour pipe there will be a small heater having a heating surface of 90 square feet of copper tubes. By means of these heaters the water will be increased in temperature in stages until it enters No. 1 still at a temperature practically the same as the steam. Condenser .—This will be carried horizontally and it would consist of a body and chambers, tubes and tube plates. Body .—This is constructed of cast iron 5-8' thick, and it will be 3' 0' diameter by 7 / ll // long. The ends of this vessel are flanged to take the tube plates and these flanges are machined. The inside of the body is provided with ribs so that internal baffles can be fitted to the condensers. By the use of this baffle, the vapour is deflected in its passage through the condenser and its travel is in a direction contrary to the flow of the cooled water. The tube plates which are attached to the flanges of the body would be of steel h' thick. Into these tubeplates would be expanded SOO-l' diameter brass tubes, each tube being 8 ' 0' long. The ends of the condensers are closed by means of cast iron waist piece Q' deep and to the flange of which is attached a cast iron cover It is on the O''deep waist piece that the water inlet and outlet to the condenser is formed. The advantage of having this waist piece will be readily seen, as it allows the tubes to be cleaned or replaced without dismantling the water connections. Receiver .—Under the condenser there would be a cast iron receiver, 4'0 // diameter by 8 ' 0 ' long in which the whole of the distillated water produced would be collected. Water Circulating Pump .—For circulating the cooling water through the con denser we would propose to supply a vertical double ram, steam driven pump having rams 4J' diameter by 6 ' stroke, and steam cylinder 7' diameter by 6 ' stroke. e should connect this pump in such a manner as to allow the circulating water to be passed through the condenser and then from the outlet of the condenser, part of the water would be taken through the multiple heaters and thence to No. 1 pan and the overplus of water would be allowed to escape through a relief valve back into the sea. Connections .—We would supply the whole of the vapour and water connections between the various parts of the plant itself and also the necessary pipes for connect ing our water circulating pump to the condenser. Exceptions.—W e do not supply .any brick, wood or concrete work, nor do we supply the connections bringing the water to the suction of the circulating pump, and the pump and pipes for removing the condensed water from the condenser. This would be extra. W e might mention that we have not included in our price for material for lagging the outside of the stills and condenser. Water produced. We have in this way provided for the distilled water which is produced in pan Nos. 2 , 3, 4, 5 and 6 , but not for the water produced in the heating system of No. 1 pan. This is water which has been produced by the con densation of the steam sent to the plant from your boiler, and you will have to connect the steam trap which we provide on the system to your boiler. You will thus be provided with a quantity of water which is almost sufficient for feeding the boiler at a temperature very near to that of the water in the boiler. The small quantity of feed water that wdll be required to make up the loss due to leakage and other causes, can be taken from the heating system of No. 2 pan in a similar manner it is taken from No. 1, and we propose to supply the connections for this purpose. Time of delivery. We would deliver in about six months, erection, etc., would take another two or three.No. Cf.-59 (Confidential), dated Bushire, tlie 26th July 1914. From— Major S. G.

In continuation of the concluding paragraph of my letter No. Cf .-21 of 8th July 1914, on the subject of the Kuwait Water Supply, I have now the honour to submit, for the consideration of the Government of India, the following suggestions and comments put forward by the Political Agent, Kuwait:— “ As the machinery of this instalment is both elaborate and delicate, it would be well to have a European engineer in charge if possible. The sum allotted in the letter of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company from monthly expenditure to ‘ balance for wages and incidentals 5 would presum ably cover part of a monthly salary for such an official, and a small increase m working expenses to meet the remainder could be arranged without difficulty. The Shaikh is not in Kuwait at present, but I am sure he would approve of this suggestion as the Indian engineers employed with his motor car, electric light, etc., are not, on the whole, satisfactory. “ Should the tender of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company be accepted, it would be convenient to induce them to undertake to keep the plant in working order for a time, say three months, after it commences to work. “ From a larger experience of Kuwait, including part of the hot weather, however, I am not sure that the sale of water has not been overesti mated, and, to be on the safe side, world ask that an average rate of Rs. 6,000 per mensem may be accepted by Government for repay ment on the understanding that the average of Rs. 8,000 at first pro posed will be adhered to if possible. ” 7s» No. 947-E.A. (Confidential), dated Simla, tlie 22nd September 1914. From—The Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, To— Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I am directed to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No. Cl-59, dated the 26th July 1914, on the question of the water supply at Ku wait. 2 . The Government of India are of opinion that in the interests of the Shaikh of Kuwait it will be advisable to include a clause in the contract with the Anglo- Persian Oil Company to the effect that the latter will undertake to keep the plant in working order for 6 months, or for at least 3 months, after it commences to work, and that the plant shall be handed over at the end of that time in proper working order and yielding the full estimated quantity for each of the 3 preceding months, i.e., for the whole period if the shorter term of 3 months is adopted and for the last 3 months if the longer. It is expected that this would give the firm a margin in the first 3 months to rectify any initial deficiencies such as often occur in new installa tions. 3. It is also necessary that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should undertake to employ and train for this period the Engineer who is to be in charge of the installa tion. 4 .

We have the honour to enclose herewith a full estimate of the cost of in stalling a distilling plant of 100,000 gallons capacity at Kuwait. f P Water Distilling plant for Kuwait. The plant will be capable of distilling from sea water 450 tons of drinking water per twenty-four hours, this quantity, roughly 100,000 gallons, will be nett gained distilled water, i.e., the plant will produce this amount and in addition enough to make up feed for boiler,—this is an important point as it enormously adds to the efficiency and life of plant. The plant offered is the most economical type which can be designed, giving 45-50 lbs. of water per pound of coal or 55*6° to ns per ton of fuel oil consumed. This result would be a great deal increased by the addition of an economiser to the boiler plant. We would point out the extremely simple construction of the plant, the tubes being readily accessible both above and below the tube plate, the former, being straight and of medium length, can be readily and quickly cleaned, more over as any one or more stills can be cut out of the series leaving remainder at work it will not be necessary at any time to shut down the plant for cleaning and scaling purposes; of course this improvement on the older type plants adds a little to the cost, but it can readily be seen that this extra outlay is repaid many times over in the first year’s working. The boiler being fed with distilled water would not require cleaning, etc., more than once a year and then the whole job could be completed in three days, even this could be obviated by fitting two boilers, but we hardly think the extra expense would be warranted. The buildings required for the complete plant would be, for the distilling plant 60 feet long, 30 feet wide and 24 feet high, for the boiler and pumps 40 feet long 20 feet wide, and 15 feet high, all measurements being inside, the buildings would occupy the position below2 The buildings could \ eitbe ; n tf SrledVoTp-on'to-feed^X^d Lf to feeTCage trnksfrom^tills /for this purpose we propose a 5-0 h. p.

The exact site can be hxed 3 . I have represented to the Engineer of the Oil Company that coo^ cannot be procured in Kuwait at less than Rs. 1-8 per diem, but as yforty will be required this will not increase the estimate to any great extent. Native bricks, he informs me, can be landed at Kuwait at Rs. 28 per thousand, and we can have mud bricks made locally at a price very little exceeding that given in the estimate. All things considered, the Engineer and I are of opinion that in any case the initial expenditure will not exceed £ \ 2 , 500 , at which sum it may be fixed for present purposes. 4 . The amount of water which it is suggested should be turned out is about 100,000 gallons per diem, or 25,000 kerosine oil tins full, a kerosine oil tin being the Kuwait measure, for twenty days in the month, and the working expenses on this basis are given at about Rs. 80,000 per annum. At present water is brought to Kuwait in native boats each carrying some 1,000 tins, the number of such boats varying according to season and from other causes; and in addition 18,000 tins are brought by the Shaikh’s steamer once a fortnight. The daily sale is said to be about 8 ,oco tins in winter and 16,000 in sun ? mer » but in summer the demand greatly exceeds the supply and it is then that hard ship is felt. It would thus apparently be necessary during the hot weather to work the plant for more days in the month than are suggested in the estimate, but the number could be reduced during the cooler season and the yearly working expenditure remain about the same. The amount of water produced yearly at 25,000 tins per diem for twenty days in the month is slightly in excess of the estimated yearly demand. c; The rate of sale per kerosine oil tin of water in Kuwait vanes according to the season and the quantity available. In summer it is generally As. 1 4 and in winter has been as low as As. } per tm Probably the best pnee for the Shaikh to fix at first would be As. J per tin from November to April, and As. ^ per tin from May to October inclusive. This, presuming that the whole amount produced was sbld, would give an average income of Rs. , 5,625 per mensem The amount of initial expenditure is estimated at Rs.

After the initial expenditure had been repaid the price of water could be reduced as considered advisable. 6 1 have the honour to request that this scheme may now be submitted for the favourable consideration of the Government of India, who may b ej^ked kindlv to advance the initial expenses of the installation on the unders n g that the amount is repayable in two years by monthly “ average of Rs. 8,000 per mensem ; repayment to commence from the date upon which the water-supply is realised.

Delhi, the 22nd January 1914* St. a. p. My Lord Marquess, We have the honour to invite a reference to our telegram of the 8th January last on the subject of the deputation of Mr. E. H. Pascoe, Assistant Superintendent, Geological Survey of India, to Koweit in order to investigate a scheme for furnishing that place with an adequate water-supply. In that telegram we estimated the expenditure to be incurred on the proposed deputa tion at Rs 700, and we received a reply from Your Lordship sanctioning our proposals and intimating that half the cost would be borne by His Majesty's Treasury. 2. Mr. Pascoe has now completed his enquiry and we have been informed that the total cost of his deputation amounted to Rs. 1,518-6-0, details of which are given in the margin. A fur ther sum of Rs. 203-14-8 is claimed as deputation allow ance for the period during which Mr. Pascoe was absent from his headquarters in the Punjab. The explanation of the large difference between the sum stated in our telegram and the actual expenditure is that our Director, Geological Survey of India, in making his estimate, calculated only the amount which would be required for the deputation in excess of the provision made in his budget for Mr. Pascoe’s work in the Punjab, and contemplated the debit of the remainder to his Department. The Audit Officer, however, advises us that in the circumstances of this case, the charges of the deputation should include all sums specially disbursed with reference to it from the date on which Mr. Pascoe left Lahore and until his return to Rawalpindi, and we think that this view must be accepted. 8th Febrnary.—Railway fare from Lahore to Bombay ... 290 6 13th to 19th February.—Passage from Bombay to Bushire 298 O Passage from Bushire to Koweit ... Daily allowance for 12th and 20th to 28th Febrnary at Rs. 10 per diem ... ... ••• ^00 7th »nd 8 th March.—Passage from Koweit to Mohammerah •- ••• ••• ® 8th to 16th March—Passage from Mohammerah to Bombay ... ... # •• „ 327 18th to 20th March—Railway fare from Bombay to Rawalpindi ... — ••• 32 * Daily aIIow&amp;ucb fop iBt to 6fch and 17th March at Rs. 10 ... ~ ••• — 70 Totai ••• 1,518 6 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 4 0 0 0 t 7 FEBl3. With regard to the deputation allowance, we would explain that the ordinary principle recognised by us is that such an allowance should not be granted to an officer during joining time or during the period occupied in proceeding to, or returning from, special duty. If this rule is observed, Mr. Pascoe will be entitled only to a deputation allowance of Rs. 75 for the period from the 20th February to the 6th March 1913 during which he was actually on duty at Koweit. In view, however, of the fact that Mr. Pascoe was deputed to Koweit for an important investigation on behalf of the British and the Indian Governments and that he would suffer pecuniary loss if the allowance were restricted to the days during which he was at Koweit, we are of opinion that he should be granted deputation allowance for the entire period of his absence from Lahore, i.e. f from the 9th February to the 20th March. 4. We desire to express regret for the mistake which has occurred, but we trust that, in view of the explanation given in this letter, the Lords Com missioners of His Majesty’s Treasury will consent to pay half the cost of the deputation amounting in all to Rs. 1,722-4-8.

With reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram No. 1379, dated the 17th February 1913, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a report by Mr. E. H. Pascoe, Assistant Superintendent in this Department, on the ^rospects of obtaining potable water by artesian baring at Koweit on the Persian df. Prospects of obtaining potable water by artesian boring at Koweit on the Persian Gulf. I arrived on the 20th February, 1913, and spent a fortnight in and around Koweit, endeavouring to form an opi- Date and locality. nion as to the nature and age of the country-rock below the sand, and the likelihood of its capability of retaining water fit for drinking purposes. ‘ Koweit lies on the coast of the Arabian Desert, in a small arm of the Persian Gulf at its north-western extremity. The desert stretches inland for at least 200 miles, without a hill-range and probably without an exposure of rock. There are no exposures at Koweit, and the only hard rock found is the ‘ ‘ Litoral Rocks at Koweit. j^ a g ” or “ Concrete ’ ’ mentioned by Dr. Pilgrim as common in the Gulf. Below the surface, at various inconstant hori zons, pebbles and sand are occasionally cemented together into calcareous or gypseous bands sufficiently coherent to influence the under ground flow of surface water. Around Koweit an efflorescent salt, similar to that found in Burma near exposures of Pegu beds and to the Reh of India, is common on the surface, especially in damp places. A foot or so below the surface a band of gypsi ferous sand, some 9 inches to Ij feet thick, is very commonly found, the gypsum is derived from subjacent Tertiary beds. With the aid of surface fires this material is partially dehydrated, and the product known as “jus ”, containing a certain amount of ‘ ‘ plaster of Paris ’ ’ and perhaps a little lime, is used as a cement for building purposes. This small industry covers quite a large area. Most of the water obtained from surface wells (from 10 to 20 feet deep) is slightly brackish. By the kindness of Captam Shakespear, Political Agent at Koweit, I was able to visit for a couple of days a low hill known as Wara and some small knolls, and rising ground, known as Burqan, 24 miles south of Koweit. These, fortunate ly, are of Tertiary rock, though of very Wara and Burqan. limited extent only. Wara is a small truncated cone, some 20 to 25 yards across its flat top, and projecting 50 or 60 feet above the desert plain. It is capped by a conglomerate and conglomeratic sandstone about 4—5 feet thick ; the pebbles of the conglomerate are small and consist mostly of quartz. It lies practically horizontally, dipping in one place at g 10° towards north-west. A glimpse of the underlying beds is obtained on one side of the hill; they appear to be identical with those seen at Burqan. The conglomerate has every appearance of a Bakhtiari bed, and for reasons to follow it probably represents the base of this series. Burqan consists of a series of low ridge-like knolls grouped along or parallel to the perimeter of a broad ellipse, which represents in all probability a low flat dome with its longer axis running approximately from north to south. The monotony of the flat plain occupying the centre is relieved by a few additional knolls. Conglomerate or conglomeratic sandstone, exactly similar to those at \\ ara, caps all these knolls and ridges, and in all cases has scarcely appreciable dip. There is much sagging at the edges and a great deal of scree, but here and there it is possible to observe what lies beneath it. Below it in the easternmost ridges, I found bands of ochreous sandstone, sandy clays of variegated colours—red, pink, yellow, etc., a white kaolin-bearing sand- 12 MAY1S J iA,*- 2 stone, and many large fragments of selenite or cr\ stalline gypsum. Flakes of gypsum occur in other parts of the hills and the efflorescent salt in the central plain. All this points to the exposure, or immediate proximity beneath the surface of Dr Pilgrim’s Pars series. I am inclined to thmk the Pars beds are actually exposed, the caps of conglomerate and conglomeratic sandstone represen ting the basal bed of the Bakhtiari series. The Pars exposure would be about a mile long by f mile broad. Between Koweit and Wara the desert is pebbly all the way, except in a few bare grass-less patches covered with efflorescent salt. Small shrubs also increase in number towards Wara and Burqan, Between Koweit and Wara. where they are quite plentiful; this may be a result of the rise of the more or less impervious Bakhtiari conglomerate to wards the surface. ^ Kubbar and Q^arain Islands were disappijpting. The latter is about 4 miles west of Koweit, and contains no rock except the recent litoral ragstone. The same stone was found all round the beach of Biubbar and Qarain Islands. Kubbar, which is 35 miles SOUth-east of Koweit. Four and-a-half miles east-south-east of this island, a smooth patch of fresh water was observed in the sea and reported by the Commander of H. M. S. “Lapwing”. A copy of this report, kindly supplied by Captain Shakespear, is appended. The geo-tectonic features appear to run, in a general way, somewhere between N.-S. and N.-W. — S.-E. This is borne out by (i) the orientation of the Burqan dome and the relative position of War?. Hill (a little west of north from Burqan), (ii) by the general structure. strike and trend of the Persian Gulf and Euphrates and Tigris valleys, (i\) by the direction of the low flat swell-ridges observed and mapped by Captain Shakespear further inland. The eastern slope of these flat swells is considerably more gradual than the western, a cir cumstance conformable with the chart of the Gulf, which shows a very gentle eastwards shelving along the Arabian side, but a comparatively steep drop into deep water along the Persian coast. From this we may deduce that easterly dipping beds cover a greater proportion of the total area than do westerly dipping beds. The dome at Burqan is a very gentle one. This fact and general consi derations are conformable to the view that the subjacent Tertiary strata in and around Koweit have been very little disturbed by folding movements. After these preliminaries it is possible to consider the question of finding water at Koweit by artesian boring. The Tertiary rocks beneath the thick superficial cap Water of Becent sand consist in all probability of aer ' Dr. Pilgrim’s “ Pars ” series and perhaps some of the basal beds of the overlying Bakhtiaris. We have evidence for this in the superficial gypsiferous band at Koweit, the nature of the Burqan and Wara beds, the brackishness of many of the Koweit and neighbouring wells, and to some extent the intermediate position of Koweit between an Upper Tertiary outcrop mapped by Dr. Pilgrim some 30 miles west of Basrah and the Nummulitic rocks of Bahrein*. As to the depth at which Tertiary rocks occur below the surface at Koweit, we may at least hope th?.t the Burqan and Wara exposures denote a line of uplift whose strike would pass through Koweit and the Basrah out crop, and that although the westerly indent in the coast forming Koweit Bay may denote a local depression of the Tertiary rocks, these rocks are not beyond the reach of the drill. The Pars series is a porous one, and if it can be reached, water ought to be found at some horizon or other, although it is not, I believe, been plentifully met with in the oil borings near Ahwaz. The most serious consideration, however, is whether any of it would be fresh enough for drinking purposes. A great part of Arr.bia and Persia are more or less permeated with rock-salt, gypsum and “ reh”; in fact, the water of the upper part of the Persian Gulf is said to be actually salter than that of the ocean (Gulf Pilot Capt. C. G. Constable and Lieutenant A. W. Stifle). In the Burma Pegu series, which corresponds very closely to the Pars in age and character, *See Geological map, Mem, Geol, Survey of India, Volume XXXIV, Part 4 .fresh water has occasionally been found, though most of it is brackish; it is not unlikely that some water-bearing bed in the Fars may also be found free from rock-salt and gypsum. It may not be necessary, however, to penetrate into -the Fars beds. In fact, there seems to me better chances of obtaining potable water from the superjacent Bakhtiari sandstones if these exist belew Koweit, and better chances still from the lowest horizons of the desert sand. One of the Bakhtiari conglomerates would be capable of holding up large quantities of water; a few miles south of Burqan water is so held up in considerable quantity and of good quality. It will be seen that the evidence to go upon is meagre in the extreme, and in ordinary circumstances, one would be very loath to advise such an expensive opera tion as boring on such scanty data. But Borin g- in view of the extreme scarcity of water and the crying necessity of the people here, who, out of the pearling season, number some 40,000, and also in face of the fact that no artesian experiments have ever been made along this coast, I have no hesitation in strongly recommending trial borings \ at Koweit. The great element of uncertainty seems to me well worth ignoring on account of the great importance of the object. One of the most hopeful signs is the reported occurrence of fresh water off Kubbar Island mentioned above. Cap tain Shakespear and I were unable to find this, but there is a well-known example of this at Bahrein, and the “Lapwings” testimony is quite definite enough. 1 do not think this water can have come from the Shatt-el-Arab ; in the first place, fresh water being less dense than salt, there would be a connecting strip °f fresh water between Kubbar and the Shatt-el-^rab, and, in the second place, the distance seems too great. It is far more likely that there is a submarine spring. As drilling would be undertaken more or less blindly, no local spot, as far as is known, would be preferable to any other; I should select one unlikely to be contaminated with foul surface water, convenient for the inhabitants, and remove as far as possible from the ‘ ‘jus’’ areas. The best method of drilling would be the American cable system, and the most suitable engine to work with would be an internal combustion oil-engine, since there would be, great ^Messrs 8 fresh water for a steam boiler. A suggestion made by Mr. C. F. Shaw of Messrs. Shaw and Haynes (Basrah), who has had expermece with water-wells in America, seems to me a sound one, namely, to procure at first a high-power engine capable o it rilling to deep horizons (3,000 feet or more), and pipe apparatus suitable for t exploration of depths up to about 700-800 feet. If no success were met with larger pipe and tools could be sent for and the same engine used for deeper boring. Salt water would, of course, have to be shut off by driving the pipe into clay or aga nst a hard bed and perhaps the addition of hydraulic cement; this is a delicate operation and requires 1 experienced supervision. As each water sand encountered should whenever feasible, be tested as to its freshness, a good deal of under-reamm probablyJbe entailed and progress consequently slow The whole ^Pa^tes «ouId subsequently be used for similar experiments m Bushire, Masqatandel ew ^ Dr. Pilgrim was inclined to think deep wells in Masqat would meet with water m quantity.* There seems to be much irregularity m the totobutiOT of salt, so ® greater the number of test-wells the better. Dr. Pilgrim remarks that in Bahrein Island, of two wells sunk within a few yards of each other, the one may be brackis and the other sweet. * / ' • ' * Note on a site for a proposed quarantine station in the Persian Gulf, etc..

Memoirs of Geological Survey of India, Vol ume XXXIV, Part IV, page 148-149. No. 3154-Confidential, dated Bushire, the 26th November (received 9th December) 1912. From— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a letter received from the Political Agent, Kuwait, giving cover to a letter ■,m o from Shaikh Sir Mubarak bm Subah, m No. 459, dated 13th November 19 . which the latter begs that Government will be pleased to assist him in furnishing the Town of Kuwait with an adequate Water Supply. 2. Captain Shakespear mentions that he has been told by a British Engineer asl in Busrah, who has visited the locality, that the prospects of obtaining water by A sinking artesian wells is not unsatisfactory and he suggests the deputation by the Government of India of a Geological expert, with experience of artesian wells, to examine and report on the prospects before further action is taken. 3 On reference to my records, I find that Mr. G. E. Pilgrim, who was deputed by the Government of India in 1905, to report on the Geology of the Gulf generally, did not visit Kuwait, and in his Memorandum on the Water Supply of thePersian Gulf in connection with the establishment of a Quarantine Station at Hormuz, . T ,, . he makes no mention at all of Kuwait, No^d^&amp;.ch mV— iX whilst his fuller report on the Geology of the Foreign Department endorsement No. 1797-E3., Persian Gulf only refers to Kuwait inciden tally and does not afford any data on which an opinion as to the possibilities for artesian wells in this area could be formed. 4. The visit of an expert Geologist to Kuwait is, moreover, very desirable on other grounds. I have already suggested to Government the expediency of obtaining from the • ^ ^ + ^ thl Shaikh of Kuwait an option or concession juSIm Porelg '’ No - M ' 170, datedl3th for minerals in Kuwait territory, in which 'Foreign to Resident, No. 365, dated 22nd June the oil deposits which are known to exist 1912. there would be included. The Government of India did not then consider the moment opportune for action in this direction, but in view of the active measures now being taken by a group composed of the Deutsche Bank, the National Bank of India and the Shell Transport Company to obtain a concession from the Porte with a view to exploring the Oil Deposits of Mesopotamia, and other parts of Turkish Empire, it seems that we may be constrained before long to approach the Shaikh with a view to obtaining prior rights within his territory and preventing any attempt on the part of the Porte to include the Kuwait Oil Fields within any concession which it may grant. In this connection I would beg reference to the marginally cited letter of which the Government of India have, no doubt, re ceived a copy, in which the Director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company urges the im portance, on Imperial grounds, of the re tention of the Oil Fields in the Persian Gulf region under exclusively British control. The present opportunity for effecting a careful examination of the Oil Fields of Kuwait territory by an experbiologist, whilst nominally examining the potentiali ties of artesian wells in this region, is a most favourable one and not likely to recur, and both on this ground, and with a view to doing our best to meet Mubarak’s wishes in the matter, I beg that Government will be pleased to give the question their benevolent and favourable consideration. 5. In regard to the expediency of co-operation with Shaikh Mubarak, I would observe that, in dealing in regard to such matters with the somewhat unbusiness like Arab potentates of the Gulf, it is always of importance to take them while they are in the mood and to strike while the iron is hot. In the present instance, the Foreign Office to Mr. Greenway, August 23rd, 1912. (Persia— Confidential Print 35252.) Mr. Marling to Foreign Office, No. 816-Con- fidential, dated 28th September 1912. (Asiatic Turkey and Arabia—Confidential Print 41818, October 7th.) Mr. Green way to Mr. Maxwell, dated 21st October 1912, enclosing notes for evidence to be given before Royal Commission on Oil Sup ply. (Persia—Confidential Print 44428, dated 21st October 1912.)Shaikh’s unreserved request to us is not only a very satisfactory sign of his confi dence, but, incidentally, the establishment of a scheme for Water Supply under Brit ish management would constitute a most convenient sign and considerable enhance ment of our predominant position at Kuwait. I, therefore, venture to hope that Government will be pleased to treat the matter ^ urgently and to authorise me by telegraph to inform the Shaikh that they are primd-facie glad to meet his wishes, but before arriving at any definite proposal or decision they propose to depute a Geologist, as soon as it can be arranged, to examine the question on the spot and to give him and themselves expert advice as to the best means of effecting the object in view. The season is favourable now, and, if it is decided to co-operate in this way, the sooner the Geologist could arrive the better. He need not be absent more than a month from date of leaving Karachi or Bombay. No. 459, dated Kuwait, the 13th November 1912. From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to enclose herewith a letter in original from Shaikh Sir Mubarak-as-Subah, K.C.I.E., to your address together with a translation from which it will be apparent that the Shaikh begs the assistance of Government in furnishing the town of Kuwait with an adequate water-supply. 2. The supply of water to this town has become a very serious matter in its development, and I will, therefore, endeavour to explain how the present necessity has arisen. The town used to be supplied from wells on its outskirts, all more or less brackish and shallow, giving what was really only the scanty percolation of each season’s rain water. When the rainfall was slight, numbers of these wells gave out while the remainder became still more brackish as they were deepened. In 1908, owing partly to the failure of the rains during the winter of 1907-08 and partly to the bad pearl season of 1907, reducing the pearling fraternity to poverty, it oc curred to some dhow-owners to employ their vessels in the off-season by carrying water from the Shatt-al-Arab. The idea at once commended itself to owners, who were thus able to employ their vessels to some profit in the off-season and to boatmen and divers, who are at the same time ordinarily without employment and could thus earn a living. It was found that water so brought could be sold cheaply and yet return a sufficient profit so that within a year there were at least 20 native craft engaged solely in this trade. Consequently the donkey-owners, who formerly brought water in skins from neighbouring wells, finding themselves hard put to it for a living, sold off their animals and took to other trades. 3. As the town s population increased and the advantages of good water from the Shatt-al-Arab came to be more appreciated, the number of boats employed rose until in 1910 there must have been at least 40 to 50 large boats alone, specially fitted with tanks for the trade and carrying from 3,000 to 5,000 gallons a trip, each \essel taking at least one trip every 4 to 6 days. By this time the town had become so dependent on the water brought by these boats that a severe storm, astmg only three days and preventing the boats from putting to sea, would cause a water- amine. Serious shortage of water began to be felt during the summer of 1911 w en, owing to the previous good pearling season having stimulated the c emand for divers, the water-boats experienced difficulty in obtaining crews. At the same time the population of the town continued to increase rapidly as trade recovere in sympathy with improvement of the pearl-market, and during the last two years there has been m consequence a large influx of Persians of the artisan anc a ourmg classes, who have taken up a more or less permanent residence in A the past summer (1912) the shortage of water was much more se\eie &gt; e ian formerly, though approximately the same number of water-boats con mue 0 P y- This was the case when the town’s population is at its lowest owing to the absence of the pearling dhows with their crews ; on the return of the peai mg ee a le beginning of the cold weather the shortage became even more lt }\T T W become c 1 llr ? nic - During the 3J years I have been in Kuwait, i 10 ie , 0W j 111 population has been very noticeable, several new bazaars i i i eei | °P ene ^n a are thronged, a large number of new boats have been 1 to the pearlmg-fleet, most of whose crews have to find dwellings in thetown, the demand for buildings has increased to such an extent that masons’, carpenters’ and coolies’ wages have nearly doubled as has also the cost of materials, such as bricks, stone, “ juss,” rafters and other wood. The shortage of water has been so severe that some of the old wells have been re-opened and the brackish water from them sold not infrequently at the rate of $ 1 (Re. 1-8) or more for two skins, containing together not more than 20 gallons. 5. To meet the water difficulty, and probably with an eye to profit himself, the Shaikh ordered from England a water-tank steamer of 300 tons capacity. The vessel has not yet arrived though expected shortly, but as 300 tons represents some 18,000 kerosine tins (the universal water measure) it will be seen that with only one trip in three or four days, which is the utmost she can attempt, her pre sence will not go far towards alleviating the present difficulty, even assuming her to work regularly without delays or break down. Moreover, the difficulty tends to increase rapidly owing to the steady increase of population and the fact that many of the poorer classes, who once drank brackish water “ faute de mieux,” having now become accustomed to sweet river water no longer consider potable that with which they were formerly satisfied. Further, there are indications that the trade of the town is attracting to it merchants and others of the better class from Turkish Arabia and Persia, a fact which tends to raise the standard of comfort and so produce an ever-growing demand for a plentiful supply of good water. I trust that the above paragraphs have made it clear that there is at the moment a really urgent need for a good water-supply and that any method contemplated must take into account a far larger demand in the near future than is at present apparent. 6. I will now turn to the Shaikh’s requirements. The subject has frequently come up in conversation with him, and I have discussed the relative merits and possibilities, so far as I was able to as a layman, of a large condensing plant utilis ing sea-water, such as I believe is installed at Aden, and of artesian well-borings. These are the alternatives the Shaikh contemplates in his letter, for no other system of water-supply seems possible in a sandy flat waste which could not become a catchment area even if the uncertain rainfall of some 6 to 9 inches per annum could suffice to provide an adequate amount of water. 7 The Shaikh having heard of the condensing plant at Aden is inclined to favour that particular method. The main objections to a large condensing plant (it would have to supply the wants of a town whose population is at present esti mated at between 40,000 and 50,000 souls) are, however (a) Heavy initial cost in buildings, machinery, etc. (b) Heavy recurring cost of fuel, whether coal or oil; an oil-fuel plant would appear to be the more economical, if suitable fuel at a cheap rate became available from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Abadan. (c) The maintenance of and the high cost in wages of the necessary com petently trained staff, which would have to be imported, for local labour would be difficult to train beyond the grade of fireman, (d) It is a question whether the pure water produced by a condensing plant could be sold cheaply enough to make its use universal. At present Shatt-al-Arab river water is sold at annas 1^ for a kerosine-tin full (4 gallons) plus carriage to house. 8. If artesian well-borings can find water in the vicinity of the town, most of the above objections seem likely to disappear ipso facto. I do not know whether the geological formation near Kuwait is favourable or otherwise to the project, but the existence of fresh-water springs under the sea at various places along the coast, and the absence of any running water on the land-surface draining the flat deserts of the west and south would argue that there must be water-bear ing strata below that from which the existing shallow surface-wells draw their meagre supplies. Some conversation which I had with a Mr. Shaw, who has estab lished himself at Basrah as a consulting Engineer, has led me to think that pro bably Artesian wells would offer the cheapest and most satisfactory method of supplying Kuwait with water. Mr. Shaw, who is a British subject, trained m America, where he had some experience in Artesian well-boring, gave me to under stand that a 4-inch well properly cased, with all the drilling machinery, etc., would cost for 400 to 500 feet depth some £500 for the first bore, subsequent bores of course bemg much cheaper as the drilling plant would be available for them. Iunderstand that the Government of Bombay have sunk many artesian wells m various districts of the Presidency, and perhaps some reliable information and expert opinion could be obtained from it. _ • 9 It will be seen from the Shaikh’s letter that he is quite agreeable to the whole work being carried out by Government as a Government concern, with its own officers to remain indefinitely in charge and the enterprise to continue in Government’s hands. In this case he would fix a regular rate, calculated to make the plant self-supporting, at which the water would be sold, profit or loss owing o fluctuating demand falling on Government On the score of efficiency there is no doubt that some such arrangement would be an advantage particularly if a condensing plant is decided upon. The Shaikh is equally agreeable to the work being executed by Government or by contractors under Government supervision on his behalf, and being then handed over to him at its cost price ; all he asks in that ease is that he may be permitted to pay the bill by suitable instalments. 10 The point which the Shaikh’s letter does not make very clear is the urgent necessity for the work, for I know that he contemplates it being possible to have a water-supply by one of the methods suggested in full working order by next April or May ; and it is true that, when the pearl-boats leave for next year s season, this town will suffer to a degree not experienced hitherto Irom the want of water. Further the Shaikh is convinced that he must make some adequate arrangement for a proper water-supply at once, he does not care at what cost as the necessity is so great and he can see no way out of the difficulty without the assistance of Government. He therefore leaves it entirely to us to make what arrangements we think best for a permanent supply, knowing that he can make no suggestions in so technical a matter which are likely to be of any use. 11 I would solicit, therefore, your earnest support towards assisting the Shaikh in this matter in which he has shown so enlightened a public spirit, and particularly in order that the project may be taken in hand at as early a date as possible. Per haps Government would be prepared to depute an officer with the necessary ex perience of artesian wells to visit Kuwait for a preliminary investigation on the spot, after which it may be possible so to expedite the work as to realize m part, if not entirely, the Shaikh’s desire that some plant should be in working order by the beginning of next summer. Translation of a letter, dated the 28th Zul-al-Kaada 1330 (9th November 1912), froin Shaikh Sir Mubarak-as-Subah, Ruler of Kuwait, to Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K. C. I. E., C.S.L, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. After Compliments— We would represent to your High Honour that I, your friend and (am) depend ent on the regard of the Precious Government upon me and upon my home-land, (which regard) has increased our town of Kuwait with inhabitants and popula tion and I see all that, that it is from the counsels (utterings) of the Precious Gov ernment, May God assist it with Glory and Fortune and make us suitable to the gaining of its approval. I beg from the Precious Government, through your High Honour, assistance for us in the bringing of water for our town, (wdiich, as we have represented, is troubled from the shortage of sufficient water); we bring it from the Shatt-al-Arab and it is insufficient and there happen difficult winds to the boats and they are delayed ; and the wells do not suffice and we are much worried over water and we ask the help of the Precious Government by one of two methods which may bring out water for us, whichever may be best in your view, either a machinery plant for making it from sea-water or by digging which may produce water from the earth. And when your Honour decides on one of these two ways, if the Precious Govern ment orders there should be an officer from them we would put a fixed price on a kerosine-tin or if it should be to me your dependent the cost should be upon me in instalments such as you may approve. Without the help of the Government upon us in bringing water we will be worried about water and we have represented the details to your Honour, and we ask benevolence of the kindness of the Govern ment to our help for this object and we expect kindness and benevolence. This (is what was necesary) and the order is with you. G. M. Press, Simla.— No. C.600 F.
