The first enclosure is comprised of translated extracts of a letter from the Native Agent at Sharjah, Moollah Houssein [Mullā Husayn]. The Agent reports continued slave trading activity into the Arabian peninsula from Africa, primarily by individuals associated with Sheikh Sultan ben Suggar [Sulṭān bin Saqr Āl Qāsimī] of Ra's al-Khaymah, who import slaves into Soor [Ṣūr], a port south of Muscat and under the authority of Sheikh Syed Saeed. The second enclosure is comprised of translated extracts of a letter from Sheikh Sultan ben Suggar. In his letter Sheikh Sultan asserts that his subjects rebuke accusations that they are involved in the slave trade, and claims that the slave trade thrives at Muscat and Sur.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100028714542.0x00000a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
