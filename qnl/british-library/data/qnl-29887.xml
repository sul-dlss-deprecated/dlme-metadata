If not, how are they grouped?S 3 0 R E T # NOTES ON TUB TRIBES OP THE SULTANATE OF IiIUSCAT AND OlsIAN. In writing any account of the Tribes of Muscat and Oman, two salient factors have to be realised at the outset# The first is that all the tribes, whatever their religion - Sunni, Ibadhi, Wahabi - have divided tharaselyes since early times into two great political factions, and Hinawi* The second is that though the Sultan is recognised by most of the outside v/orld, and especially the United States of America, Prance and Britain with whom he has treaties, as an independent mpnarch of the ./hole tract of land, the districts of which v/ill presently be describ' ed, he has practically no authority over any of the tribes out of the immediate vicinity of Muscat, Sur, Dhofar and the Batinah coastal towns# In fact the tribes of the interior regard themselves, by virtue of&amp;fae Treaty of Sib (1920), as completely independent of his authority, as, indeed, a perusal of the terns of that treaty will tend to show, though the intention no doubt was to provide no more than a measure of home rule. These tribes have grouped themselves together under a triumvirate oonsist- mg of the Imam, Mohammad bin Abdulla al Khalili, their elected religious leader. Shaikh Salih bin Isa al H a rthi, Tamimah of all the Hinawi politic? faction, and Shaikh Sulairaan bin H a myar, Tamimah of all the G-hafiria. Though he continues to appoint his own Walis and collects and administers the revenue and lays down the lav/s, religious and temporal, in r/hich he ie bigotted and almost fanatically opposed to progress or penetration from without, the Imam, himself, is getting old and has in any case probably never wielded any great power except with the support of his two lieutenants. In fact the whole'edifice of this virtually independent tribal kingdom depends upon the support of these two Shaikhs, who appear to have gained and continue to exercise as much influence and* authority as their fathers. The latter were, without question, the most influential Omani shaikhs of their day, and similarly formed a triun- virate with the Imam and his predecessor, who was murdered in the disturbed times immediately preceding the Treaty of Sib* The Sultans have almost invariably asked for and received suppor-- both Naval and Military, from the British Government in their struggles with the tribes of Oman* The most recent occasion was shortly after the accession of the present Sultan, when three sloop*, including H.M.S. Shoreham with the Sultan, Political Resident, Senior Naval Officer,Persiar G-ulf, and the Political Agent on board, concentrated at Sur, 7 /hilst a demonstration by R. A.P, sea planes from a base established at Khor Jaramah was carried out to bring Shaikh Ali bin ^.bdullah al Hamud of the Beni bu Ali to order after he had defied the Sultan over the establishment of a Customs post* A request in 194&amp; for a promise of Royal Air Force asaistanc in a plan to subjugate the Oman tribes upon the death of the Imam was, however, refused* A list of the majority of tribes to be found in the Sul^nate hp- been compiled from Golonel Miles’ lis^ ^r -* 1 uded in his adm - ’a? miration report of 1880 and from such meagre and often unreliable information as is available. Some notes have also been compiled on those tribes which are more frequently met with or upon which attention is from time to time focused owing to their depradations or other activities directed against the Sultan’s authority or one another. Some of the tribes listed by Miles have been omitted either as too depleted for inclusion, or as having been found to be sub-sections of another tribe. A few tribes, notably thnp _ i:he Dhofar district, have been added. This information • * # • •- 2 - This information should be treated only as supplementary to the much more extensive and ably compiled notes contained in Lomjw^w s Gazetteer (1905), and the latter should ijasmxi*bly--hd-ccrisulted when more detailed information is required. These notes are in fact merely an attempt to bring the infoimation more up to date* They are neither exhaustive nor, as indicated, can their accuracy be vouched for, though • where there is a sharp difference from previous accounts, such^steps as are possible have been taken to check up on the infoimation. figures of population and rifles must necessarily be estimates of the crudest kind, and the stated tendencies of the tribes may be no more than the hopes of the informants. It will be noted that for the most part the population ’ has considerably decreased. This is scarcely surprising since, apart from epidemics, which, though cholera and plague have taken severe toll, have been mercifully few, there has been a constant exodus in recent times to the oil fields and the Muscat Consulate has for some years issued visas on Omani passports at the rate of some three thousand a year. From these • jrevised estimates it will be seen that the tribal population of the Sultan ate may be less than two hundred thousand, and, with the cosmopolixwi ■population of the coastal towns, including Muscat, Mutrah and G-wadur, the whole population of the Sultanate is probably not in excess of three hundred thousand, and former estimates of half a million are very likely excessive. The Sultan himself, though frequently approached, either through genuine ignorance or an unexplained desire for secrecy, has supplied no information of value, though few persons can have had better opportunity for accumulating knowledge through actual contact than his present Minister for the Interior, Saiyid Aimed bin Ibrahim* His officials are no more ■helpful in this matter and information must be gleaned despite them /rather than with their assistance. 1 • For a better understanding of these notes a brief enumeration i of the provinces or districts of the Sultanate may be helpful here. To the north covering the whole tip of the Oman promontory is the Ruus al • Jibal. Southward (omitting Shamailiyah which is not Sultanate territory) i is the 3atinah - the coastal plain reaching down almost to Muscat, West J of the Batinah is Western Hajar, which includes the Jibal Akhdar mountain '^Xange. « Further inland is DHAHIRAH and, somewhat north, the iBur?Tmv and Mahadhah tracts, both of doubtful ownership. South and East lie Eastern Hajir and Sharqiyah, and then following the coast southward, Jalu an, B a tedn and, finally, at the southernmost extremity, adjoining the Hadramaut of the Aden Protectorate, Dhofar. The present situation is one of general peace, with the Sultan’s influence slightly increasing in the coastal districts, e.g. Batinah, Dhofar and Sharqiyah , and far better established than in his father s day, *It seems a pity that all his Walis are selected from his own tribe and ate often near relations. In Oman proper and Dhahihrah, and East and West hajar, the Triumvirate continue their rule, and when it comes to it, it sdems that the vote will almost certainly be for continuation of the Imams hip in a person other than the Sultan, otherwise this independenoe will be lost, and at present the most likely candidate, and one who certain quarters insist has already been nominated, is the eldest son of the previous Imam, Yahya bin Salim bin Rashid al Kharusi, aged at present about forty. However,..though seventy two and despite recurring rumours of failing health, the present Imam is by no means yet dead or even dying. A still more/ -&gt; A still more nebulous condition prevails in the Buraimi area* There it would seen that neither the Imam nor the Sultan nor' ^ any other chief has any paramount authority and the four chief tribes claimed by the Sultan to be Omani and within his territories, the Naim| Beni Ka*ab, Beni Qitab and A1 Bu Shamis (actually an offshoot of the Naim) are virtually independent and likely to remain so until it is seen who wins in the bid for oil expected to be develooed in that neighbourhood* Nearly all the Shaikhs visited the Sultan in 1948 and.received hospitality and presents from him. The general oonjfensus of^opinion, however, seems to have been that he was niggardly in his gifts and not many will feel it worth the effort or the trouble to cone again. The Sultan is certainly careful with his money, and reports of his large increase in revenue from Customs with no corresponding increase in largesse or amenities have also aroused unfavourable comment in quarters other than purely tribal. But in this case the Sultan prooably realises the dominating influence of the two principal Hinacwi and Ghafiri Shaikhs, and has concentrated upon them* He certainly treated them handsomely enough as the following notes upon their tribes will show, though to what avail time cnly will show. Religion itself plays little or no part in the tribal politics and no mention has been made of it in the notes. For details of ths religion of each tribe reference may be made to Lorimer's Gazetteer. The bulk of the Hinawi tribe belongs to the Ibadhi sect of Islam, whilst of their Ghafiri opponents considerable nunbers are orthodox Sunnis, and a few follow the Whahabi faith, to which they were converted at the time of the Whahabi invasions in the early 19 th century. But the dominant soot is still Ibadhi, whose tenets were adopted as the national Omani faith in the 8 th century of the Christian era. For the present even the Hinawi and Ghafiri rivalry seems to have died down under the Omani triumvirate, and the chief rivalry, though fortunately at present of a peaceful nature, is between the Sultan and the Imam. Upon the letters death anything nay hap on, vicGont or otherwise, and it is well • ;JLgh impossible to predict, though si^w are in favour of a continuation of present arrangements. The Sultan, on the other hand, is trying hard, and seems confident of his ultimate success. This would certainly make for greater unity in the Sultanate as a whole, and suit our own interests oetter; and the Sultan should receive our support wherever possible: a factor which in itself might be decisive. 4. » • 9 3 • • *-4- BWI Al' Ie _ present strength of this tribe is now about two triousand# It oould muster perhaps one thousand riflemen. Their capital is Yankal m V/estem Hajar and they have settlements alons the Wadi Dhank and in Sah^m The majority are poor and cul ~ators t whilst a few enya^e in trade, ijith the exception of the FIDHA sub-section consisting of about five hundred persons, they are of a mild disposition, and fairly friendly with British and other foreigners. Their Shaikh, Saif bin Amir, is said to be a sincere friend of the present Sultan and gets a monthly allowance of about Rs 60 /~. He lives at Dhank and visited Muscat in August 1949 and stayed as the Sultan's guest for three months. He is about forty years old and has two sons, the eldest, ionir, being his heir. He is liked and recognised by his tribe, and appears to be much more intelligent than his neople. As a Hinawi his connection with Salih bin Isa al Harthi (see note on A1 Harth) is good. It is also good with the Imam (see note on Beni Ruwahah), It is not likely that he could rally any but his own tribe co his assistance in case of war or similar trouble. The tribe is at enmity with the Beni Hinah, BENI BU ALL, • .. of the Qhief tribes in Sharqiyah and Jala'an. Its capital is balad Beni bu Ali, forty miles south of Sur, The tribe is at feud with the oni bu H a ssan (q.v.) and as uliahabis they are allied with the Beni asi , -hey are also allied with the al Hi ohm. Many are bedouins, and ' wild.

Their capital is ^qil or Qala and about three thousand are settled in the Sultanat Poverty has scattered them, and they live in small settlements getting their liyang as cultivators, donkey and camel men.

The Imam, Mohammad bin Jedullah ..1 Fhalili, as tribal lea.der appears to have little to do with his tribe. As elected Imam of Oman since 1920 he has considerable spiritual power over the tribes as a vdiole. His temporal perwer is sloarod, more or less equally with the leaders of the Ghafiri and HInawi factions, and togetlxr these three exercise a fairly effective independent control over the interior of Oman proper, where the Imam appoints his own Walls. He lives at Nizwa, insists upon a strictly puritanical way of life, and is opposed to all progress such as oil development and motor transport, and to penetration by Europeans (and probably Americans) especially Christians, though the Hissionery doctors have been called to him in sickness. He lias brought up the two sons of the late Imam, Xahya and Abdulla, and in some quorfcors it is held that, in 194-8, when suffering from dysentocy he nominated the former as his successor, and that this has the support of nary of the tribes. Other quarters insist that lx has refused to make a nomination, inspite of entrreaty by the various other loaders in 194-7# Whichever is true, as has been shown in these notes, the Sultan appears to have encouraged all tlx leaders to visit him at Muscat in 1948,, Ho has also tightened up on religious observances and retarded many possible developments since® oil in particular.

Apparently this reconsnsndati &gt;*3pet with approval, and it was agreed that the Omani tribes should elect Taiya on the decease of the present Imam, and a document to that effect was drawn up and signed by all present, '’he Sultan is believed to have known of this and to have been considerably depressed at the time, but there was nothing he could do about it, other than to compete as best he can, and this presumably explains why over the past year or so he does seem to have opposed or not gone on with new acheoes, and to have tightened up all religious ouotons and observances to have gone slow on oil development {while laying the blame on the co ipary and to have given considerable hospitality and largesse to Shaikhs in 1943* The fact is, as I have reported in uy accounts of ny oalaiah visit and as the Sultan himself insists, there are still maty powerful reactionary spirits in the Sultanate who, surprising as it may seem, regard the Sultan as much too hasty and advanced, and they will not there fore support hira. The more religions the Shaikh the more this attitude will be found, and in the various notes I ©m compiling on the tribes, I am finding it necessary to record that with few exceptions the tribes of liajar and C ^an proper are likely to support Yahya^s candidature when the time comes I cannot absolutely vouch for all this, but it is information that is repeatedly corroborated. On two previous occasions, however, when the Imajfl was ill, in spite of urging® froa the tribes and even suggestions regarding a noL.lnee, he steadfastly refused to name his successor, ( see Muscat Intelligeuoe Sum iaries Nos 6 and 19 of 194*7# and Section of Auso&amp;t Administration report for 1947 )• It is possible that the story has become distorted by accident, wishful thinking or design.

The bulk of the file consists of an account by the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat entitled 'Notes on the Tribes of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman' (ff 9-33), which provides written summaries of each of the main tribes and tables with further details including principal settlements, estimated population, and estimated number of rifles.The correspondence, which mainly consists of letters from the Political Agent to the Political Residency in Bahrain, discusses rumours that the Imam of Oman, during a spell of ill health in 1948, recommended his successor to an assembled group of leading tribal chiefs. Also discussed is the Sultan of Muscat and Oman's [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] attempts to obtain the allegiance of the Omani tribal leaders, and his hope of persuading them to discard the Imamate altogether when the present Imam dies.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Āl Bū Sa'īd dynasty, Imam of Muscat and Oman</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Internal politics</topic></subject><subject><topic>Tribes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000013#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
