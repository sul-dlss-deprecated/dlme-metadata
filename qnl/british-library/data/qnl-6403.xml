LiL 4^. a* ^ Right of H, . G-. to contract engagcrienL's on 'behalf of the jirab oheikhdoms of the b ian Gu ll in Xi itox'no.c icn al e eLien cg Note by External Dept. India Office The question of H.JuG's right to speak on behalf of the Arab bheikhdous ol the x^ersian G-ulf (ko^eit, jalirem, atar and the Crucial 1 oheikhdons) in international agreements has recently couie. to the fore in connection 'with (l) the Chicago Air Agreements, (2) the recent Petroleum Agreement between the U.K. and U.o, Gtoverniaents and (3) the Bretton Woodj Agreements. The standard definiti of the status of these oheikhdous is 'independent ^-jrab btates under British protection but not British Protectorates 1 ', :j A^-reeimnts . In considering the briefs for the: U.K. •and Indian delegations at Cliicago it was thought desi. able that the bheikhdoias should be brought within the teriis of the draft U.K. Air Convention in order that, traffic between the oheikhdoms and other U.K. fc^iV i uorics should oe reserved to the U.K. as 'cabotage 11 . Tins 'was c on old ere d cc je efiocteci by Section 2 oi' Ai'ticle Ylil of tlie Interim Agreement as signed, since this section defined the ter::-itory of a jtate as including 'territory ui^der protection' ano the oheikhdom^ ai 'e fcuix itories under British protection. There v^as no list of protected fceivi coi'ies, etc., attached to the Chicago Agreements. It has since coi-o to light that theire are certain inconsistencies between the Ciiicago Air Agreoi iencs and ;ur civj.1 ^^viation agreements with Balirein ano Ao .oit, as both the latter agreements provide that H.. .. G. shall not giant Lie use oi aerodromes to foreign aircraft without the consent of the oheikh, and that a. rcrai t shall not fly ove:.', or l-.nd in, tlie sheikh's territo .'j.es except under special authorisation issued by the Sheildi, On the ooner hand, in the Chicago 'Two l^eedoi'is' Agreement ^International Air Services Transit Agreement) each signatory state has granted the ocher contracting states the privilege of flying across and landing for noa- traiiic purposes in 'its ber. itories' and the definition of 'territory' in Section 2 oi' Article VlII of tlie Interim Agreement as including •'Territory under protection' is ap; licable to the Two IVe^doms Agreement. 3» A note on tho implications involved was recorded by oir Geoffrey Prior and will be found below (Annex l). The fact remains that the U.K. signature at Chicago wap given to agreements which specifically and in terms applied to all territories under the oov|;eignity, suzerainty, protection or mandate of the contracting Governments. The ;iheikhdoms aro unquestionably under our protection for international purposes and therefore the U.K. signature did cover them, yo fai as .1., .(j-'s ov.-n x'el tioi\s with the Sheikhdoius ai'e concerned, it may no b ha^ oeen coirect for to sign agreements covering the Sheikhdoms without consulting thoii, Lievert.ieless i^ is certain tliat, internationally, the U.K. is committed in respect of the sheikhdoms, as texiitoixes under H. G's protection, and it is tharefoie neces ary to i ind oOine .-ay oi gettxng the bheildhs to fulfil^ the obligations of the Chicago agreements which the U.K. signed. The Political K. sident stated in his telegram No, 1774 of 2nd December, 1943^ tliat he was proposing to take action to this end, 4. Article VII of the Pecroleui i^.'^reemen t between the U.K. and U,S, Governments states that the signatory Governments agree - / (a)(a) i .h;..t 'the ^onoral purpose ox 'b. is ^nt is to facilitate tho orderly devclopnont of the international potrolcuH trade and that no provision ii\ this Agreement, with the exception oi iii^ticlij J.I, is to be construed as applying to tho operation of the d ones tic petroleum inc uj.tr y vithin the country of either Government; (b) That nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as impairing or modifying any lav or regulation, or the right to 6nact any law or regulation, relating to the importation, of petroleum into the country of either Government; (c) vhat for the purposes of this .article the word 'country' sh^ll mean: (i) in relation to the Government of the United • Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United Aingdo , t. ose British Colonies, o seas territories, protectorates, protected states and all nuaidated territories administered by that Government lists of which as at the date of this Agreement have been exchanged. ' It will be seen 'elicit the definition of country applied only to ^11 01 'the Agreement. The lists which were exchanged did no., include the Arab Sheikhdoms, rhe Petroleum agreement is a ''eneral declaration of intention and it would have made no practical difference if they had been so included, except t riu. t it 'would then have been possible to hold that the oxl trade between the Persian Gulf sheikhdoms and the U.Kv or other British territory was domestic trade, and to tnat extent tne activit-.es of the International Petroleum Commission in regard to the international Petroleui trade .aight Imve been impaired, 3« as regai^ds the Brett on 'i.'oods A ^ -'eements, the signatory govemiion ts, uiider Article IcT liection 2(g) oi the Ilonetary Pund Agreement '.nd Arbicle ^1 oection 2(g) or tlie International Banic Agreement, undertook to accept the Agree . .ones both on their own behali and in respect oi all colonies, etc, , inclu din g all territories utider thei r pro Lection , In point of fact the obligations were not such that they were likeiy to be of any practical effect so far as the sheikhdoms were concerned, and H.j . G., in the im trument of signature deposited with tne U.u. Government, felt entitled' to declare that they h-d taken ■all steps necessary to carry out all of its obligations under the eaid agreement', in spite of the fact that the Llheilchs had not been consulted by them. * 6, The implications involved are nuch the same as in the case of the Chicago Air Agreements, It has however been considered sufficient in this c^se oirjply to inform the jiulers that K,L,G, have accepted certain obligations under the Brett on Woods ..greenents •v^hich will have effect in their territory, 7• -J-he general conclusion seems to be that if we are going to maintain the posicion t at the at a J oheikhdo e oj. the Persian Gulf (excluding i uscat) are British protected states and can have no international /relations- 3 - relations with other states except thi-ough H.L. G., then we must fron time to tiine undertake international obligations on their behalf, and .lust see, ^.s a domestic matter berween ourselves and the Sheikhdoms, tiiat the latter fulfil^ these obligations so far as io required. Indi a • Office ^ b. '.. r . 1. April, 19A j 6.Jil i !lj.x 1 I have ooon shovn the inciiu Jfiico filo regarding the position of oho Persian G-ulf ^heikhdohis undor the Chicu^o a_r Ci.^r&amp;ei.i^n'tj and -understand that I am invited to comment on tUis subject, i would have pr^fe^ruu to defer couiment until I had access to my ovvn records, out my personal views, for v;hat they .,o worth, are as follows. Final Act oi the Conference it itj apparently assuied under :ecommendation 1 of section VIII read w..th xirticle VIII Section 2 of Appendix 1 j that His aje ty's Government have ac&lt;-]u_:ved tiio right to dispose of the Shaikhdom.s interests in Aivil Aviation, I sub. dt that th^-re is no foundation for tliis view, 3. I will take the otates in detail, X'iist, as regards the Trucial i^haiklis - tlivj viis pr^su -bly based on tae exclusive c 'oaties oi the 6th arch, 1892^ These treaties, however do no c cede us any authority to gran', concessions to foreigners without ruioronce to the rulers, and the S-iaikhs would certainly not in^arprot their agreements in this way. The rulers arc, of coui'sc, well a\vare 0; ^ rights, and it will 'be rocalled that we had the greatest difficulty in securing our own original air rights for ourselves,' j .ho Civj .i Air agreements with Sharjah and Debai give us no support as they are purely ad hoc arrangements for the benefit of B,O.A.C, -•-'•-la'am. Here again our position is pi-esumably based on the excluoxve j.reacies ci the 2. !nd jjecerabcr, 1880, arid the 13th March, 1892, ihese creaties ho'jever are purely negative. The ohaikh binds himself no u bo enter into any agreement with foreign powers, but he does not gi\e as c a co blanche co act for him and in the past he has always been consulin advance v.lio.o his interests 'v^cre afiected. In addition thu Civil Air agreement expressly?' provides that we will not allow foreign aix cr .i t to use iiahi^a.-U aerodrome without the ^haiiiho consent, and this completely estops any claim on oui' part, 3* K iJoai i, . Hero the exclusive treaty oi 1899 is less emphatic than that oi Bahrain and the Siiailcli is not precluded from correspondence •■ich ioieign powers, iiis Civil xiir Agreei^ent is equally definite and precludes Ub frori alleging foreign aircraft to use thu aerodro. \e or aorodro! ics without the shaikhs consent. In other words tiio oliaildi expressly retains (and has been allowed by us to retain) thu ower to permit foreign aircraft to use his utate, 0 • c,isc I xi. cat I understand th t it has beuii accepted that the jultan is not bound by thu Chicago ..greepunt aid the question of □ringing him into the picture is being i^ursuuci separately, 7. ./here we give advance intimation of our require ents to G-ulf otatus, iko it clear to txium th; t their interu. ts ar^ boii^j safeguarded, and take carc no to offend their susceptibilities, then it is usually possible to obtain our requirements without difficulty. If this is not done the Political officer's task ib rendered immeasurably more difficult and a molehi-.l may easily turn into a mountain. In this case I myself had not seen a copy of the agreement until a week or so ago, it must be remembered that our position in the Persian Gulf has no other foundation t.ian the good'.ill of the states and can easily be undermined if this is once lost.- ^h-inlv it io clcai'' that our act^oiiL; at Chicago cannot be held m any vay binding on the Persian Gulf She:Jdidoi;w unless ai^d until they have accepted the obligation- involved. As I have temporarily vacated my post it does not seem appropriate for me to suggest solutions for the d^lficulty an4 I would (J - L ^ i/a -t until 1 have resumed charge and can consider the matter on the spot. I request that copies of this note bo sent by Express Air Bag to the Gov^rnriient of India and the Political Resident. Persian Gulf.

The note discusses the question of the right of the British Government to speak on behalf of Koweit [Kuwait], Bahrein [Bahrain], Qatar, and the Trucial Sheikhdoms in the light of:(1) the Chicago Air Agreements;(2) the recent Petroleum Agreement between the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States;(3) the Bretton Woods Agreements.The conclusion is that in order to maintain the position of the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf (excluding Muscat) as British protected states, the British must from time to time undertake international obligations on their behalf and see that the states themselves fulfil such obligations.The document has an annex by Sir Charles Geoffrey Prior, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, containing his views on the question, dated 27 September 1945.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>International relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imperialism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign affairs</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00002c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
