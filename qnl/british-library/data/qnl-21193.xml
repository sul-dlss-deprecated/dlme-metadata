I cannot say without making enquiries which might be embarrassing whether and to what extent jurisdiction is actually exercised at Zubarah but I rather think that the Shaikh sends orders if occasion arises to people who live there. Shaikh ! Isa certainly used to do so. 2. Two sons of late Shaikh Khalid, some of Qatam family of Rifa and bin *Ali of Hidd live there and have fishtraps and boats and sometimes take animals there. No Qatar customs are levied nor are passports required. 3. I cannot say for certain size of Zubarah area but understand that it is marked by certain known wells and towers and may be roughly a semi-circle of two or three miles radius. 4.

How should I make a covenant with one belonging to Qattar against another of Qattar. The people of Qattar are all my subjects from the first to the last and Qattar and all that is in it is subject to me. I am their Chief in any case and every way except in case of foreigners living on our side and he is subject to others and as long as he is in Qattar I am responsible for him and I hold all people of Qattar the near and the distant equal in rights. I do not allow injury to any one from any other neither from the nearest or the farthest. In their rights they are treated equally. This administration and justice. And if I give any one of them from my property that is another matter. I do not understand what you meant by Ramazeen; you say that I am stirring them against you. Are you afraid that they will injure you and I may help them? Or you wish to harm them and you are afraid that I shall not agree and if this is your idea it is a very bad one. If my nearest relation such as a son or brother would harm you I would not agree to it and if your brother came and complained against you I would not allow you to harm him and would try to defend him. This is what my duty and position demands. You mentioned about the covenant which you gave me but you are indebted to me for that. ^ As your father was indebted to me before. ISfhen your father died you came to me and renewed the covenant. If you fulfil it you -v § 2 *® a man who keeps his promise. But if the devil has changed your mind it is, inshallah, a blunder. If a man fails to fulfilhis promise he harms himself. God s does not suffer evil deeds. Before receiving this letter you were the most dear to me. You have mentioned that customs duties will he charged upon your goods. But this country is mine hy the will of God. And if I wish to charge duty on anybody's goods I may do so. And I may exempt those whom X wish. Follow the way that is suitable to you, and leave the way from which you do not get any benefit.

We inform you about the going of 'Al-Ramazan* to Bin Thany and the agreement. After they returned Mansur bin Khalil came and took them back, and Shaikh Abdullah bin lasim arranged for them a pay and arranged for customs to be collected om the western shore. He appointed bin Avaidhah and one from the tribe 'Al Gumarah' in Faraihah. We are not pleased with this action as this does not serve your interests or ours, and these parts are under your control. Al Ramazan was appointed for this job so that there may be some dispute between us, and they poor people, do not know what is right and what is wrong and the position is now placed before you. We at present do not help them and ask you what we should do. Bin Thany has displayed his enmity towards you and what is more is his idea to tkke Zubara and other places and what you approve will be right.

Mansur bin Khalil tells the Maimis of the southern partg that their power is from Al Khalifah and Abdullah bin Jasim told them that the arms of Al Khalifah have been taken away by the Government and they have no power, neither they nor their men, and we are informing you of wnat he said.Telegram © /‘tf «Q' From Political Agent, Bahrain To Political Resident, at Muscat. No. 84 Dated 23rd April 1937. ZUBAHAH . Shaikh of Bahrain showed me April 21st letter from Shaikh of Qatar to Rashid bin Muhammad al r- J abbur , head of N_aim tribe and a Bahrain subject, who enjoys an allowance from the Bahrain Civil List but lives principally at Zubarah. 2. Letter is involved and replies to letter from Rashid appa rently protesting against Shaikh of Qatar f s • v ’ | I having given encouragement to a Naim faction of Zubarah opposed to Rashid. It claims all Qatar and gives Rashid seven days (possibly from April 19th) to state his loyalty or he will be punished. Rashid sent letter to Shaikh of Bahrain, who is incensed at Shaikh of Qatar 1 s action. 3. Story so far as I can at present piece it together seems to be that Naim subjects of Bahrain living at Zubarah have had quarrel over a woman. Leader of one side went off to beg Shaikh ! Abdullah’s aid with result in paragraph 2 above. 4. Other complications seem to be attempt to put tax on juss boats and to instal Qatar customs official at small place just inside Zubarah area. 5. Serious point i f true is^ that Naim are reported to have said that if they do not get support from Bahrain they will adhere to Bin Sa’ud. 6. I have sent letter by special messenger to Shaikh of Qatar saying that I have been shown his letter to Rashid and that I have told you that difficulties appear to/-- 2 - to have arisen and asking him to let me know fully what has occurred so that I may inform you. I added that I hoped that he would ensure that none of his people do any act which might lead to difficulties with others. 7. I do not think after my hint that Shaikh of Qatar will do anything precipitate and after he has replied it should be possible to decide what line w/e should take. PoliticalAgent,'Bahrain* After Oompliments. I beg to inform you that I have learnt that some persons were sent from Bahrain and landed at Zubarah as a result of the actions which I mentioned to you. I do not know what does that, who had sent them to stay at Zubarah, mean because I have forbidden everyone from landing. I have the right of inter!ering in those coasts in any way which suits it was possible to prevent them, but I deferred taking any action before referring the matter to you. I request you to order their withdrawal from that place lest something may happen on account of this, otherwise I would be excused before you if I take the necessary measures against them. As I consider that with the existence of these people in that place there would be reasons for the creation of many difficulties which whoever sent t&amp;em to that place wishes to create. I, as you know me, do not like to involve myself in difficulties with others, but when I am compelled I cannot overlook that which I see to be a challenge to my actions and agression to my rights. I hope that you will pay your kind attention to this matter and I request you to let me have a reply as soon as possible so that I may know the result. the situation which agrees with me. When the news reached me Usual Ending.Translation of letxer dated 11th Shfar 1356(equivalent to 23rd April 1937) from Shaikh * Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani, Ruler of Qatar, to Lieut-Colonel Loch,0*1.E., Political Agent, BaUrain. After Compliments. I had the honour of receiving your kind letter dated 21st April 193? equivalent to 9th Safar 1356 and noted what was mentioned by you in connection witn what you heard about the occurrence of some difficulties near Zubarah, but / you did not as yet know the details except that you were shown a letter from me to Rashid bin Muhammad al Jabbur in which a reply was asked for from him otherwise he will be punished. les it appears that you do not actually know the case because had you known it you would have avoided writing about it. It also appears to me that whoever intimated the case to you, did not disclose the whole facts to you. He contradicted the fact and disturbed your mind with matters quite far from truth. You did not become aware of the actual fact and the reason which made me send such a letter to one of my subjects. What I wish to inform you is that nothing has happened near Zubarah to be called difficultic .' 1 as stated by you. The case is purely an internal matter and reformatory axiairs which were carried out in order to safeguard the country T s income and protect its interests. And i am sure that had you been aware of the fact you would have not interfered in matters which were considered to be of internal affairs of which we are better aware and feel more tnan anyone else. Because you are of those men who understand and know tne duty, fully appreciate things and respect the rights and in order that you should understand j the real fact I shall explain tne case to you. Firstly that all what had happened were considered to be of pure internal affairs to which no one else has any right to protest to us against them. Secondly, that Ikshid bin Muhammad al Jabbur i2 . is one oi my subjects and if he inteneres in a matter wnicn leads 10 rebellion and disobedience and causes agitation it is my duty and it is necessary to restrain and punisn nim. Thirdly, I did not do but what was to be done by any Gorernment which finds it to he its duty to protect its ngnts and to safeguard its interests and to repulse anyone who disobeys its orders and objects to its proceedings. It has been reported to me tiiat tne nortnem coasts ox Qatar have become a landing place Xor those boats which smuggle goods and that many things come from those places and run out from there to all sides of Qatar whicn caused a great harm to the income of the country and affected its imports. I deemed it necessary to control these coasts, to watch carefully all the coasts and to prevent all things of this sort. At present I appointed guards to guard the coasts and to observe all what arrives with the intention of smuggling. This is one of the necessary duties carried out in all the countries for the protection and the safeguard of the income of the country. But this my action did not receive the approval of Bashid bin Muhammad al Jabbur who started trying in those places, causing agitations and doing other acts of which the smell of disobedience and insubordination was forthcoming. He did further greater than this and that is his aggression upon the watchmen and his obstructing them from watching. He has deserved, in my opinion, the heaviest punishment Xor the acts committed by him which might have led to creation of difficulties* but I wanted to treat him in the first instance in as a good way as possible. I, therefore, wrote to him warning him of the consequences of his deed and asked him tor a reply otherwise I would be compelled to repulse and punish him as every G-overnment considered that one of the m&amp;st important of its duties to check anyone who challenges its )3. orders and tries to create disturbances and to cause exitement* You, Political Agent, will observe that there was nothing ol ditliculties as was brought to your notice,but these were internal attairs which we alone have right to decide in any way which we iind suitable to the condition of the country and necessary for the public interest. It is necessary for you to assist me in case necessity arises to ask tor your assistance# With regard to what you mentioned that you hope that none of my subjects would do any act which may lead to ditticulties with others. I do not know what your Honour means by this and what others you refer to. I do not think that there are any diiticulties which may occur with others. All my steps are internal affairs which concern me alone which I took within my territory and limits and between my subjects as already explained to you. I hope that you will consider what was stated by me, pay attention to it and to make out the fact.

Captain T. Hic^inbotham, I.A., Bahrain.On the morning of the 28th April 1937 the Shaikh stayed on after a formal farewell call and discussed the question of Zubarah with Captain Hickinbotham and myself. 2. The Shaikh went into the past history of Zubarah and pointed out that it 02 %inally belonged to the Al Khalifah; that it was only the Turkish power which had superseded them and that without that power the bin Thani family could have donenothing; that since the Zubarah incident 43 years ago the bin Thani family had done nothing in connection with Zubarah till in the last few months. The Shaikh ad mitted that Al Khalifah had not flown a flag at Zubarah but said that this was merely because it was not thought necessary to do so. 3. The Shaikh was clearly perturbed at the possibility of trouble and reiterated that if it started either the bin Thani family would win and seize his flag-from Zubarah or the Nadim would win and take Doha. He did not think that there would be trouble as long as Shaikh T Abdullah bin Qasim did not send people to Zubarah but he said that he had motor cars and that it was easy to get across. He said that he had heard that after Salih bin Mani» returned to Doha Shaikh T Abdullah bin Qasim had opened 35 cases of rifles (thought to be 25 rifles in each case) so that it appeared as if he had serious intentions. 4. I told the Shaikh that T thought that the best plan, would be for both sides to remain quiet and for the Resident to make enquiries into the matter and the Shaikh agreed that, this was best and said that he would not take steps without i consulting us but suggested that it would be a good thing if a warship were to go to Zubarah as in that case neither side would attempt to take any action as they still fear the warships owing to the memory of the Zubarah bombardment% ? 7 4-5 years before. The Shaikh mentioned that one of the shells had carried away the flagstaff and that another shell had been picked up by one of ! Abdullah bin Qasim 1 s own servants who had hammered it to get the powder out and had been blown to pieces. I mentioned that I had suggested that some aircraft should come so that the Political Agent could, if he wished to do so, go over to Doha or see Zubarah. £8-4-37.COPY From - Doha.

Copy to Political Agent, Bahrain, by Royal Air Force air craft proceeding there 28th April, No. T, Dated the % April, 1937, ZUBARAH. As you are aware Shaikh of Bahrain has an old standing claim as against Shaikh of qat&amp;r to Zubarah. Merits of this claim need not be considered at this stage but for previous history see Lorimer’s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Volume 1 Part 1 pages 814 to 318 and 923, 2. Political Agent Bahrain telegraphs that in connection with this claim a somewhat serious situation has arisen briefly as follows, (a) Shaikh of Q,atar ha® ordered Rashid head of the section of the NAIM tribe living at Zubarah to state his loyalty to him (the Shai h) or be punished, (b) Attitude of Naim is reported to be that if they do not receive support from Shaikh of Bahrain against the Shaikh of q&amp;tar they will n adhere to I bn Saud”, They are stated to have complained to Baud bin Jiluwi, Governor of Hasa, against the Shaikh of Qatar, This seems not unlikely but a further rumour that the Shaikh of /v:5 ; - 2 - of c^atar lias similarly complained to •Tiluwi against the Haim seems to me doubtful. (c) Naim numbering about one thousand (the men being armed) with camels and flocks have concentrated at Zubarah. This appears to me to indicate a possible migration of Naim to Hasa. Alternatively Haim may be collecting to resist the Shaikh of Qatar in which case there may be fighting at Zubarah. (d) Individual from Hoffuf states that about April 24th Ji}.uwi sent a party of 70 armed camelmen to Qatar, object unknown but since it is also rumoured that there is some trouble near Doha between Shaikh of •atar and a tribe who claim adherence to Ibn Saud party may have been sent in this connection. I do not think it likely however that party will actually enter Qatar terri t ory. (e) Political Agent Bahrain has sent letter to Shaikh of Qatar saying that he is reporting situation to me and that in the meantime Shaikh s ho aid keep his people quiet• (f) political Agent Bahrain with my approval is also send! g a further letter to Shaikh of Qatar advising him not to send his people to Zubarah area and is addressing a letter to the Shaikh of Bahrain asking him to recall certain servants of his who have just gone to Zubarah, and to stop repairing the fort there pending result of investigation of matter. 3. I do not feel that we should interfere if the Haim emigrate to Saudi Arabia. Nor am I of opinion that we should take any forcible measures against either side in the event of a clash between the Naim and the Shaikh of Qatar (see paragraph 2 /8./ -3- 2 (c) above). Political Agent Bahrain however should of c urse continue his efforts at persuading all parties concerned to keep the peace. In particular Shaikh of Bahrain should be prevented from sending reinforcements to the Naim at 2ubarah, which apart from other considerations would be against his Treaty of 1861 as it would involve a breach of the Maritime Peace,. 4. If fighting breaks out in Q,atar and the members of the qatar Oil Company are in danger (an unlikely contingency) they should be evacuated by sloop. 5. in the above circumstances I would be grateful if Senior Naval Officer could put as soon as possible a sloop at the disposal of Political Agent Bahrain t who should proceed to Zubarah or Doha as he thinks fit get into touch with the local situation and keep Senior Naval Officer, Air Officer Commanding and myself informed of developments. I would be grateful if Air Officer Commanding could arrange to have some Aircraft standing by at Bahrain (1) in case of serious trouble on the i^atar-Saudi frontier though I think this contingency is uni ik ely (2) for possible rapid evacuation of employees of qatar Oil Company though here again I think this contingency is unlikely and (3) for rapid transport of Political Officers to any any special areas in case of need. Perhaps Minister Jedda would be so good as to ascertain to what extent if any the Saudi Government are interested or involved in the present situation.C05TFI.WNTIAI.. fc*:r; Ho*0/97 of 1937* Off too of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Gamp, Muscat.

Situation of Zubarah . 9, The town of Zubarah consists of a number of ruined houses on the sea coast surrounded by the remains of a mud wall which at one time was guarded by towers, and an enclosed corridor runs inland for about a mile to the remains of a large fort (um React) which contained a mosque and dwelling quarters. The whole of this is com pletely ruined and there is no sign.of recent occupation, 10* last and south east from Zubarah there are situa- ted the wells of Halwan, Masaichah, and Lashi. There is good grazing in this neighbourhood and the wells number five. 11. The HaHm informed me that Zubarah was bound on % the north by Faraihah and on the south by Rubaijah. They seem to include the wells mentioned above, i#e. Halwan, 'etcetera, as a part of Zubarah# This is not improbable as there are ruined houses near these wells# The air photographs now being taken will assist in deciding the actual area of the country which can accurately be d&amp;s- cribea as Zubarah#Interview- with i^aHm ledgers - 50th April 1937 » IS, I met Rashid bin Mohammad, Khalid bin Mohammad 2 and other leaders of the Ka f im tribe* They were per fectly friendly. They assured me that they had col lected with no evil intent, but only because they have been threatened with taxation and having objected they feared that Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Qassim would take action against them. They claimed to be the subjects of the Shaikh of Bahrain. I at first advised them to return to their followers and i iduce their followers to disperse and take up their normal life as the case had been referred to the Honourable the Political Re sident. They asked m for a guarantee from His Majes ty’s Government of security if they did return* i was unable to give them this guarantee and a, vised them to return to their people at once ana told tnem that I would see Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Qassim the next morning and would visit them again after my interview with Shaikh * Aodul-ah bin Qassim. They then returned to their people. Interview v ion Shaikh ’Abdullah .bin the HUjLiJL- of Qatar* 1st May 1957 . 13* X met Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Qassum ana his sons Hamad and Ail. They were at Riyan. Saleh bin Man-, the Secretary of the Ruler, was present during our conversation. The Ruler was at first disinclined to discuss the matter with me. He said that he wua aggrieved and that the case had been referred to the Honourable the Political Resident who knew ail there He pretended to know nothing about the events/— was to know.-4- events in his own country* However, after a iittie persuasion, he declcied to discuss the matter of the Ha f iffl* lie admitted that he haa sheltered the E&amp;m&amp;in section and that he had decided to put down smuggling through Zubarah and the villages to the north, and that in order to carry out this purpose he had sent Ram zan and a party of other people to stop smuggling. They were not sent to Zubarah* He claimed that the Na'im living in his area were his subjects and that he was entitled to tax the© if he wished* He was very much incensed against the Ai Khalifan for having pienteu a flag at Zubarah and landed three soldiers and material* He stated that he and Shaikh Hamad were as brothers and that he haa no quarrel with Shaikh Hamad. Eventually ^ ,urea me taut he hud not armed any of his people and had no intention of doing so and that there would be perfe . t security throughout his country from now on wards and that the Ha f im were at liberty to dep rt to their normal places without rear of any interference from him or his people until such time as■the Resident had given a decision in the case* We tnen dined and relations were considerably more amicable after the meal. I returned with Saleh bin Maria to the Neiim* Interview with the Hahim - 1st May 1957 * 14* Together with V.'ing Commander Rickards end Saleh bin Mana I saw Sheikh Rashid bin Mohammad and his bro ther and cousin and other leaders at Halwan wells. I assured them that Shaikh * Abdullah bin Cassim had given me an assurance that they would not come to harm on theli dispersing to their normal occup tion nnd that there would be security -ending the decision of the Political Resident/-( Resident* The majority of the leaders were obviously gratified and relieved* Shaikh Rashid and his two re latives were the only persons who questioned the ad visability of dispersing the force* This was because they are the only people who have actively opposed the Shaikh of Qatar. Saleh bin Mana was present the whole time the conversations took place. I considered it desirable that he should be present so chat there would be no doubt of what I told the ha f im leaders and 210 doubt in their minds that what I was ceiling them re garding the Ruler of Qatar was true. Conclusion. 15, I consider that the possibility of the Oil Company making a port at the west coast of Qatar caused certain persons (Saleh bin Mena)?to influence the Shaik to proceed to those parts end to institute preventive measures against alleged smuggling from Bahrain, It is probable that this tour of the Ruler of Qatar was simply and solely so that he could show to the ?*orid in general and the Ka f im in particular that he was the ruler of the territory, 16, I think that Ramazan was specially chosen to be one of the party of tax collectors who were sent to F&amp;r&amp;ih&amp;h, etcetera, because he was known to be at enmity with the N&amp;him who inhabited those villages* It was probably thought that he was unlikely to enter into collusion with them to avoid duties, 17, Shaikh Rashid bin Mohammad who I understand lives in the area obstructed the t.: x collectors and as a result rec Ived a strong letter from the; Shaikh. He became frightened of the consequences of his action and/-- 6 - and appealed to the A1 Khallfah and the other sub-sec tions of his tribe* The result is known* I consider that Shaikh Rashid would nave been in order if he nad oni *‘&gt; at.de a protest which we could have decided and not gone f urther and collected an armed force* 16* The bhaikh of was also at fault in send ing a party of soldiers to plant the Bahrain flag at nuoar&amp;n and to land material for the ostensible pur pose of repairing the fort* He would have been better aavised if he had confined nis activities to asking our gooa onices to settle the matter* His delay in with drawing his soldiers from Zubarah after being so request ed by the Political Resident is also to be deprecated* X am of opinion tnat many laise and lying rumours^ some ol them intentional, are at the back of this attitude 1 and I ao not think that His Highness would, have personal ly acted in the way that he appears to have done if he had not been somewhat overcome by sentimental feeling for the home of his ancestors* 19* There are in my opinion two problems to fee decided and they are;- (a) the ownership of Zub&amp;rah (b) the nationality of the Ha 1 !® tribe* vath regard to (a) I have nothing to say as I have not had an opportunity of studying the question up-to-date The second point regarding the nationality of the % Ha»im should not be very difficult to determine. If Zub&amp;r&amp;h belongs to the Shaikh of Bahrain and they live §/ ;■ within the area then they mist be subject to his rule, but whether they belong to Bahrain or whether they belong to the Shaikh of Qatar as long as they are in the territory/-territory of the Shaikh of Qatar they mst be sub ject to any laws and regulations that he makes for .tils inhaoitants as a whole* If they are not prepared to do this then they should move out of the territory. Yifhen they go to ba*ucli Arabia they become subject to the lav-'S in force there and such should be the case when they visit Qatar* He co mentation. ’ - 20* X am averse to a decision being given in this case before- every endeavour has been made to bring the two Balers together* If a decision is made only one side can benefit and the losing side will naturally fee-i. aggrieved* For sometime the two Rulers have been on the best of terms and situated in close proximity as the countries are it would be most unfortunate if this state of affairs was permanently altered* I thinl that it is possible that Zubarah might prove a con tinual source of friction between them* 21. I suggest that an endeavour e made to bring about a meeting between trie Rulers or their represen tatives ana I think that this could probably be done at once and would prove acceptable to both sides* I have not aiseussed this with the Rulers. I suggest that uis hxgnnesa the Ruler of Bahrain be approached with a view to his deputing his brother Shaikh Abdulie bin * Isa to meet the Ruler of Qatar and discuss a compromise amicably* If tnls course proves acceptable to him I propose that the Ruler of Qatar be approaches with a vie?; to meeting the Bahrain Representative. This could be done by my visiting Bohar by air ss sooi as possible. If both sides are agreeable then either Shaikh/■I «a-.

Copy given to Political Agent, Bahrain. ■% iPossible basis for comprorc-t . Vide paragraph 20 of Political Agent, Bahrain»s Wo* C/33S-4/13 of 3rd May 1937* 1® The Shaikh of Qatar to agree not to impose taxes on the Nafim* He may agree to this since as far as my information goes he has not the power to enforce his taxation. The Ha»im are believed to number about 1000 armed men. it is doubtful whether Shaikh f Abdullah can put anything like this force into the field. Saleh bin Mana states that Shaikh *Abdullah could put 3000 men into the field. It is obviously Saleh*s game to exaggerate the power of his employer. Shaikh f Abdullah himself is rather senile and the two fire-brands are his son Hamad and Saleh bin Mana, and neither of these individuals have any strength of character. Note :- If there is difficulty over this point it might be dropped as,if the Wa*im choose to remain in Qatar, they should obey the laws of the country and they are at liberty to leave the country if they do not agree to the laws.IX* Shaikh 1 Abdullah bin Qassim not to enforce any iinport dues in the Zubarah area and on the north western coastal villages, and in return to this con cession the Shaikh of Bahrain to extend the favourable terms enjoyed by Sa f udi Arabia to Qatar* Note:- This would include permission for Bahrain juss boats to work as they have from time immemorialIll • The Shaikh of Qatar to continue the existing arrangement regarding travel papers of persons passing between Bahrain and the west and north-west coasts of Qatar. Note:- In practice travel papers have never been necessary between Bahrain and these places.IV. The Shaikh of Qatar to acknowledge the Shaikh of Bahrainis right to the ownership of the Zubarah area as his personal property and in return for the Shaikh of Bahrain to resign all oil and commercial rights in the area to the Shaikh of Qatar.These points were discussed by the Political Resident with Mr, Belgrave, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, this morning, and it was decided that Mtf. Belgrave should approach His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain with a view to ascertaining if His Highness would be agreeable to negotiations being started* 2. For the purpose of this note the Zubarah area may be taken to mean an enclave running from the coast south of aid including Rubeijah inland to include the wells at Halwan, Masaichah and Lashi returning to the coast at and including Faraihah village* The ruined town of Zubarah and the ruined fort of Umm Rear will be seen to be included within this area* 3* It ?fas suggested to Mr. Belgrave that it might be acceptable if the question of taxation of the Na ! im was altered to mean that permanent residents of the Zubarah area should be free from taxation. In prac tice this would probably mean free from import dues as it is doubtful if Shaikh Abdullah bin Qassim ever intended the word f taxation 1 to mean the levy of a tax on the Ha ! im tribe, but it is probable that he meant the imposition of import duties on goods in tended for them. 3-5-37Telegram Inter M v om Air Officer Commanding, Air Headquarters, Baghdad.

Before the arise of the present situation the Political Agent, Bahrain, received a letter from the Shaikh of Bahrain, date the 14th April 1D37, a coijy of ^hich 1 enclose. 3. ftm an informal conversation which I bad »ith *r. helgrave previous to the present situation arising the Bahrain claim to Subarah appears to be as follows, though of course this cannot be taken as either final or comprehensive until we get sn official letter on the subject from the Bahrain Government. Briefly, the Bahrain Government state (t) that far many years past the Naim tribe of Bahrain or k in and members of whom live in Bahrain, are practically the sole inhabitants of ^ubamh {2} that the Naim at Bubarah pay no taxes, includi ng customs, (Signature) * ° ' 44 . P 1374 S&amp;P—(M-2043)—15-1-36—10,000. (Besignatim)*» 23 *» to the Shaikh of 'latar. Kor does the Shaikh of &gt;tar insist on travel papers for Bahrain subjects visiting Zubarah (3) that the Haim tribe obey the orders of the Shaikh of Bahrain, in support of which statement the Bahrain Grovesrnment quote that many years ago the tribe obeyed the orders of Shaikh ♦ Isa, then Ruler of Bahrain, not to occupy the Zubarah fort, which they wished to do. further, that the Haim tribe generally obey the orders of the Ruler of Bahrain. The Bahrain Government, however, admit tiiat they do not administer or take taxes at Zubarah. 4. Mr. Belgrave informed me, unofficially of course, that the Shaikh would be quite willing to give us an assurance that his claim to Zubar&amp;h would not in any way interfere with the rights of the }atar Oil Company nor their operations. This is of c our a e a point of some practical importance. 5. I instructed Colonel Loch to approach Mr. Packer, Chief Local Representative, ^atar Oil Company, and ascertain whether the Company had in fact any intention of making Zubarah into a port (see copy of Shaikh’s letter referred to in paragraph 2 above). Mr. Packer informed Colonel Loch that txie Company had no present intention of doing this. I therefore instructed Colonel Loch to inform the Shaikh accordingly and to add tiiat in tiles e circumstances the question raised by Hi a Highness did not appear to arise. 6. I had hoped that by this line of action the thorny question of the ownership of zubarah would remain quiescent, and that His Majesty's Government would be able to avoid giving /I -3- glving a -iefini ® award either in fisyour of the -xuler of Bahrain or the Ruler of Oatar. Present developaents hare made this more difficult but it may be still possible to arrange a compromise between the two Rulers on lines which CJaptain Hie it in bet ham has suggested, and on which I viil report later. in the meantime the following summary Of the dispute may be of use to Hia » jesty’e Sorer men t arei the Government of India. 7. ,ith regard to the connection of the Ruling Family of Bahrain with gubarah, see Lorimer’a ’•Sazetteer of the Persian Sulf% Volume 1, Part 1, pages 798-818,Zthe correspondence connected with Government of India letter ITo. 114&amp;-3. A. .datsd the 5th ifey 1920 to Shaikh ’Abdullah bin ’Isa. !3riefly, the Al Chalifah family first invaded hubarah from Uejd in 176S, and thence captured Bahrain in 1782 from the Persians. Subsequently a member of the family. Shaikh Muhammad, who was expelled from Bahrain by his grand uncle, shaikh ’Abdullah, ■ e Ruler, re-built the town in 1842 (horimer, Volume 1, Part 1, page 799). 3arly in 1843 he returned to Bahrain, defeated and expelled Shaikh ’Abdullah (ibid page 869) and seized the Sheikhdom of Bahrain which at that time included Qatar. Mutouamad ruled in Bahrain until 1868,when he was expelled consequent on an ultimatum from the British Govern ment, and was succeeded by his brother All,grandfather of the present Euler /In about 1.868 the M f fnani Ruler of Bahrain (ibid page B95). family, who had gradually been rising to power, attained predominant influence over the other ').atar Shaikhs ( ibid page 802)* The Al Thoni f however, apparently still acknowledged ins ome sort the suzerainty of Bahrain since in the same year there is mention that the tribute, if any, payable by the Chiefs of qatar to Bahrain should be determined before the Resident, This state of affairs continued until 1871 (ibid page 802) • 8. As far back as 1873 (Lorimer, Volume 1, Part 1, page 815) the Government of India expressed their concurrence in the view that the Bhaikh of Bahrain had no clear or important rights in I&amp;t&amp;r, and this was conveyed to Shaikh • Isa, then Ruler of Bahrain, In 1875, vide the last sentence of paragraph 2 of page 816 of Lorimer ♦ a Gazetteer, Volume 1, i art 1, 9. * In 1895 (vide Lorimer, Volume 1, Part 1, page 923) the Turks, in combination with Rhaikh J&amp;sim ath Thani, tuler of (Jatar, concentrated a force at hub; rah for the invasion of Bahrain. With them were a section of the Al Bin All, a Bahrain tribe who had migrated to Qatar and were hostile to the Ruler of Bahrain. His Majesty* a Government came to the assistance of the Ruler and prevented the threatened invasion by the bombardment and destruction by Bleeps of the fleet of dhows which had been collected for the descent on Bahrain. 10. It will probably be useful for His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India to have my views as to the merits of the rival claims. (a) It oan be conceded (vide paragraph 7 above) that until 1868 Bahrain held part of (Jatar, including Zubarah, and from then until 1871 the :atar 'Shaikhs, headed by the Al Thani, acknowledged the suzerainty of Bahrain by being prepared to pay tribute. (b)/- 5 ' (b) Since about that date i.e. 1871 the / I Than! (the present ruling family of Qatar) have held qatar, including Zubarah, and in 1875 the important f announcement mentioned in paragraph 9 above was made to the Shaikn of Bahrain. (c) The action which His Majesty's Government had to take in 1895 on behalf of the Bahrain Government shows clearly that at that date the Bahrain Govern ment, far from having any control over ^ub&amp;rah, were actually threatened by invasion from that pl&amp;ee. (d) ¥ith regard to the Bahrain case, see paragraph 3 (l) f (2) and (3) above. The fact that on a single occasion the Naim tribe obeyed the orders of the Hu}.er of Bahrain seems to me to prove little or nothing. rr ima faci® the further argument that in addition to this specific case, the Uaim, generally * peaking, obey the orders of the ruler of Bahrain, would seem to carry some weight, here, however, certain sections of an Arab tribe have migrated from the territory of one Shaikh to that of another, fhey still consider themselves as owing some v&amp;gue allegiance to their original Hhaikh and are generally subject to his influence. The Bahrain Downs ir tribe, for instance, some years ago being on bad terms with the Ruler of Bahrain, emigrated to uasa. vhiie there they doubtless received messages from the uler of Bahrain and evidently considered themselves as owing some allegiance to him, since finally they asked /6 &lt; asked his permission to return to Bahrain* But this sort of allegiance on the part of the 'Dowatir naturally gives no claim to the Shaikh of Bahrain to the part of efftsa occupied by them. fhe fact tlust the Shaikh of q^&amp;t&amp;r takes no taxes from the Inhabit mis of hubarah and does not insist on travel papers perhaps carries more weight, but appears to me far from conclusive, and probably merely indicates a desire on his part to avoid trouble with the Haim tribe and complications with the Bahrain 0oVermont. This attitude, induced by cons idem t ions of practical convenience, does not appear to me materially to weaken in principle his juridical ownership of bar ah. lastly, the Bahrain Government admit that they do not administer or take taxes at ;;ub&amp;rah. In this respect, therefore, their claim is considerably weaker than that in the somewhat analogous case of H&amp;w&amp;r. 11, Personally, therefore, I am of the opinion that juridically the Bahrain claim to bar all must fail. 12. gran another and practical point of view His Majesty's Government, by their endorsement of the at ax Oil Concession, would seem to be committed both to the Lxhaikh of Qatar and to Petroleum Bevelopment (Qatar) Limited, to the recognition of the ownership of ubareh by the Sheikh of Qatar. It may be possible to surmount this difficulty in view of the lhaikh of Bahrain's readiness to give the assurance referred to in para graph 4 abov e. 13• A political consideration on the Bahrain aide is as follows, /follows# Colonel Loch informs me that there is considerable feeling, both on the part of the Shaikh and of his family, on the subject of bar ah, and is of opinion that if a decision r/ere given in favour of qatar they (the Shaikh and. his family) will have a lasting grievance against us. Colonel Loch further points out that the Al rChal if ah are our best friends on the Arab &lt;3oast and that it would be moat unfortunate if this sense of grievance came into being. It is true that if His Majesty’s Cover merit gave a decision in favour of Bahrain, the Shaikh of qatar and his family would likewise have a sense of grievance, but from the political point of view Bahrain is of considerably more importance to us than qatar. 14. 1 agree generally with Colonel Loch’s views but this consideration does not alter my pers onal opinion that if the compr onise mentioned in paragraph 6 fa ils, anti His Majesty’s Government have to make an award, it should foe in favour of qatar subject to any further arguments which Bahrain can adduce, vide my paragraph 3 above. sd • 1.

I pointed out to them that it was for them to question the B~iii*ain representatives fully with regard to the proposition put forward by them and that they should not content themselves with merely saying M No w or 'Impossible'. They were representatives and negotiators and they should do all they could to search for some .way round the obstacle. Saleh bin Mana then gave me a history of Qatar f s claim to Zubarah and I then asked Shaikh Nasir bin Atieh if^ according to Arab custom a house was built and then left unoccupied for ) many years and then the descendant of the builder re turned to the house to whom wguld the house be considered to belong. Shaikh Nasir was unwilling to answer this question and although it was explained to him by myself and the interpreter he still declined to answer and said/-said that Saleh bin Mst}? mast answer that, Saleh bin Mana again embarked on a history of Qatar and the question was unanswered, the reason being^ that^of course ^the answer is that, according to Arab custom ythe house would naturally belong to the descendant of the builder* I tola them that, as negotiators, they must be prepared to concede something and that the Bahrain negotiators must also be prepared to concede something* I agalT! asked them to endeavour to settle this matter by negotiations and as an example of what I meant by negotiating I said that possibly they might con sider returning to the condition that existed six months ago whereby Bahrain were not making an active claim to Zubarah and the Shaikh of Qatar was not endeavouring to levy dues or tax*on the Na f im, and that they might consider this pro position not as officially suggested by me but merely as an example of what I meant when I stated that they should search for a way round the obstacle* 2. Saleh bin Mana suggested that it was difficult to explain what each side was saying and that there were probably differences in the reports of the conversations from each side that he would like the conversations to take place in front of a neutral party* I told him that I would report this suggestion but that at the present stage I hoped that they would be able to come to a reasonable understanding without the presence or interference of a third party. 3. Saleh bin Mana then informed me that he had received i a letter from Shaikh ! Abdullah bin Qassim with a message for me in it and that was to the effect that the Na ! im were not dispersing. I expressed surprise that Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Qassim should write to me through a third person when I was myself in correspondence with him and had/--3- ✓ iiad actually receiYed a letter from him the previous day. 1 informed the representatives that the Na ! im had given an undertaking in the same terms as Shaikh 1 Abdullah bin Qassim and I saw no reason for presuming that they were any more likely to break their word than the Shaikh himself. 3. Tov/ards the end of the meeting I asked him if they were keeping Shaikh »Abdullah bin Qassim informed .

Shaikh Nasir then volunteered the information that the Na f im were causing considerable worry as a number of other people, Qatar subjects, were joining the Na f im gathering and in reply to my remarks that I could not believe that the loyal subjects of Qatar were joining the Na y im, he stated that the subjeots of Qatar were not all of them loyal and that this extra gathering was causing concern to Shaikh 1 Abdullah bin Qassim. I told him that I had that morning received l/* a report to the effect that Shaikh 1 Abdullah bin Qassim himself was preparing for eventualities should the negotiations break down. Shaikh Nasir said that he knew nothing of this. 5. From my conversation with the Adviser and from this interview I have come to the conclusion that the two representatives had not come to Bahrain with any • “l practical intentions of seeking a solution but that they were sent because the Shaikh of Qatar desired to be able to say that he had abided by the request of the Political Resident/--4- Resident to send representatives to negotiate. The in crease in the strength ol the Na ! im, if* this is true, and possibly my conversation of* yesterday may change the charac ter of /the representatives T visit and I do &amp;&amp;&amp; think that it is^possible that a solution may be found through these negotiations. I informed the representatives that I trusted they were here really and truly to endeavour to find a solu tion. I informed the Adviser of such parts of this conversation as I considered it desirable for him to know and he told me at the same time that he had re ceived information that the tribe known as Sudan living in the neighbourhood of Doha were proving dis loyal and were expected to join the Na T im. This is merely a rumour but from other rumours &amp;&amp;£•£ both of that us have gathered/the state of Qatar is becoming a little uncertain. 17-5—37.A V! IQ) Saleh Din Man a asked permission to see me this morning and I granted him an interview at 9.30, He replied that he was busy at that time and I altered the time to 12 noon. My reason for making this altera tion was that I had been informed that he was upset because a recent letter from me had been addressed to Shaikh Nasir and I had not mentioned his name / and I did not v/ant any possibility of the negotiations being in any way obstructed by pique on the pant of one of the negotiators. On his arrival I pointed out to him that he had made an incorrect statement to me at the previous meeting when he stated that he had made . three applications to see me and that the Head Minshi had not forwarded them. The Head Huns hi was nresent on this occasion and Saleh bin Man a found it difficult to substantiate his previous statement as he himself had told the Head Minshi that I was not to be informed and tnat he would come at some other time more convenient to himself. I then explained at length to Mm that the leader of a deputation was a person who was officifIjH*/ A considered to be so and that I had presumed that Shaikh ilasir bin Atieh as the near relative of Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Qassim was naturally and socially a more important individual and therefore I had addressed ny communication to him, that I considered they had both equal standing as negotiators and that my addressing Shaikh iiasir was not intended to be in any way detrimental to the standing of Saleh bin taana and that he had an example in these matters m the method of addressing the Sa'udi representatives when they came to discuss matters some years ago with the representatives of His Highness the Euler.

He said that he had attended the meeting of the representatives that mor ning and had purposely refrained from making any re marks. I again explained to him the situation and pointed out to him that I was unaccustomed to havine* persons who asked for an appointment /£u4 ~/fcZy I notified the time for them to see me and that although I was extremely busy 1117 self this morning and had expected that the meeting which I knew toVU*L ^ was to take place be postponed 5 I was prepared to grant *LLaJ~ Llcu&gt;-cK. a second time for an interview as he was feeling hurt. Saleh bin Mana then assured me that the whole matter was now quite clear to him and that he was doing everything he could to settle the question as the Resident wished. I told him that I was quite sure that he would work in the interests of his own party and the general good of the two States and that he would do his best to meet the wishes of the Resident especially since tne Residents visit to Doha. Saleh bin Mana then stated tnat he wished to discuss the suitable means of settling the present problem. I pointed out to him that just as I yJl.CJLJCm**' t coald n °twith Shaikh Hasir and had no intention of . CtiCuL 0lng 80 ’ w myself, I could not fNyei-with Saleh bin Mana without the presence of Shaikh Hasir and that I was unable to/-Ml. - 3 - to hear any suggestions with regard to the negotiations from him unless his brother negotiator was also present. I said that as it was he had been an hour at the Agency and that no doubt Shaikh ITasir was already beginning to wonder what it was all about. 3S-5-37. ^ ^ Pi- aw.The Adviser was present at this morning 1 s meeting with the consent' of both sides. His own were anxious for him to be present so that some one other than the actual negotiators could observe the g eneral conduct of the proceedings. The Qatar representatives I understand had no objection whatsoever. Mr. Belgrave informed me after the meeting that Saleh bin Man a was rude in the extreme and that if he had not himself been present he would never have believed that Saleh bin Man a would conduct himself in such a way. It appears that he refused to tahe p3_rt in any discussion and there was some thing in the nature of words between him and Shaikh Nasir bin Atieh who was apparently annoyed at Saleh’s attitude. Mr. Belgrave farther informed me that Shaikh Nasir was more loquacious this morning than he had been at any previous meeting and actually certain progress seems to have been made. Shaikh Nasir appears to have put forward very guardedly suggestions somewhat on the lines of the one which I had mentioned to them when they saw me on Sunday. They are meeting again at 2.30 this afternoon and I am seeing Mr. Belgrave after the meeting. 18-5-37.Abdullah bln Dowasir arrived from Qatar about five days ago and I think is interested in this matter. He is at enmity with Saleh bin Mara although outwardly very friendly. 18-5-37. 4 ^ ly fa-Mr. Belgrave who® I informed, of the incident with regard to the addressing of letters to the Qatar representatives tells me that he does not consider that the pigESSEt attitude adopted by Saleh bin Eana at tnis morning’s meeting could be the result of personal annoyance over such a small matter but he thinks there is something much larger behind^but is unable to make any suggestion regarding the actual cause.

Zubarah*tl Having been informed that it was suspected that Saleh bin Mana was:- (b) obtaining advice from Mr. Packer of Petroleum Concessions Limited, I took an opportunity yesterday of speaking to him. Mr* Packer said that he had never attempted to deny or hide the fact that Saleh bin Mana drank at his house. The man was useful to his Company and not wishing to offend him he had always let him have what he wanted. I explained that permits were strictly confined to non- Muslims and that I was responsible for those to whom I issued them and that it was wrong to provide Muslims with liquor even when guests in a house. I told him that I had received a report that Saleh bin Mana was the worse for drink M/hen he called on His Highness on Monday 10th May and that it was suggested that he had obtained it from his (Mr. Packer T s) house. Mr. Packer assured me that from henceforth he would not allow Saleh bin Mana to have beer,etc., when he called. Regarding the second point Mr. Packer admitted that Saleh bin Mana had raised the question on several occasions but beyond informing him that Petroleum Conces sions Limited were not interested in Zubarah he had given no opinion. I asked him in future to refrain from giving any advice or opinion on the subject and he said that he would. his disposal by His Highness and has moved into the town. Nasir bin Atieh is still residing in the house. (a) obtaining alcoholic liquors NOTE:- Saleh bin Mana has left the house placed at 16/5/57.Shaikh Uasir bin Atieh and Saleh bin Mana called this morning at 8.30* Shaikh Nasir was more loquacious than he had ever been before and took a •IiCkcLl qfcerpart in our conversation. They informed me that as a result of a lengthy meeting yesterday they put forward the suggestion that Hubarah should re main as it was previous to this present dispute and that the Na’im if they consider themselves as sub jects of the Shaikh of Qatar were at liberty to re main, but if they did not they should be allowed to leave. 2. We again discussed ways and means for coming to a reasonable solution and I feel that they are both more inclined to be sincere. 3. I suggested another possible means of compro mise and that was that Shaikh Abdullah bin Qassim / not because he had no right^but rather out of affec tion for the Ruler of Bahrain,should announce his intention of levying no taxes, while the Ruler of Bahrain while not foregoing his claim to Zubarah should announce his intention that out of affection for the Ruler of Qatar he was not prepared to press the point at the present time. This solution appealed to Shaikh Nasir who wished me to put it in writing, but X suggested that either he or Saleh bin Mana should write about this as it was not in any way an official suggestion. 4. Shaikh Nasir said that their trouble was not that the Na ! im were in any strength but that many of the subjects of Qatar irere joining them. I tnink that/-that this may be one of the reasons why they are now inclined to search for a solution. 5. Shaikh Nasir and Saleh bin Mana both pointed out that they were not empowered to act on their own but must consult Shaikh Abdullah bin Qassim and I told them that they most certainly consult him and keep him fully informed of the progress of events. 19-5-3?Shaikh *Abdullah bin ’Isa and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad with Mr* Belgrave called to consult me this morning. This was after I had interviewed the Qatar representatives. They gave me their version of the progress of events and Shaikh Salman stated that his father whom he had consulted/told him to ask me whe ther I considered that he should agree to the Qatar representatives 1 suggestions (a) that an arbitrator should be appointed and/or (b) that the situation as it was six ncnths ago I told him that the question of an arbitrator would mean a decision by His Majestyts Government. I made it clear that I was giving my personal advice and not % speaking in an official position because I was not en - titled to do so without consulting the Honourable the Political Resident. I told him that I considered that they would be well-advised to seek a solution by mutual agreement and that an arbitrator should only be a last resource; that if an arbitrator made any decision then he must decide against one side or the other and this would cause bad feeling between their States for some time to come. I suggested that they should explore every possible method of coming to an agreement on the lines suggested by the Qatar representatives. They seemed very anxious to reach a settlement and they gave 2. I suggested to them that they might be able to consider the question of Shaikh *Abdullah bin Qassim should be resumed me quite i account of Saleh tude at the previous meeting account of Saleh bin Manats atti- agreeing out of friendship for His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamid/ -- 2 ~ Hamad not to tax the Ha f im and His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad agreeing out of friendship for Shaikh »Abdullah bin Qassim not to press his claim at the present time to the Zubarah area. I impressed on them that they must not consider that they were to receive everything and give nothing but they must be prepared to concede a certain amount in return for what the Qatar representa tives might be prepared to offer. 3. I advised them to again consult His Highness the Ruler and go further into the matter. ?hey said they would. 19-5-37.CONFIDENTIAL, 6 No, C/400-4/lo The Political Agent, Bahrain, presents his compliments to:—• The Honourably the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Eushire, and has the honour to send him a copy of the undermentioned document (s).

They said they that^/suggested to the Bahrain Government that customs dues would not be imposed on Zubarah or on the personal property and articles for use of the Na»im, that the Zubaran area would be considered to belong to the Shaikh of Qatar and that the Na ! im would be considered to be under his jurisdiction. I pointed out to them that their inclusion of the word n under the jurisdiction of» amounted to the Bahrain representatives, should they have agreed, accepting the decision that Zubarah was part of Qatar. This they undoubtedly would refuse to do. I again suggest ed to them that they should leave out H under the jurisdic tion of 5 * and that they should merely say that the condi tion of the Zubardiarea should be as it was six months ago. We then discussed various alternative propositions in de tail. Eventually I told them that they should put for ward in writing the terms which they had offered to the Bahrain Government yesterday and in reply they said that it was not possible to commit anything to writing as they were afraid of Shaikh f Abdullah bin Qassim and had no real authority to act or make decisions on his behalf. This was told to me by Shaikh Nasir. I suggested that they should put writing with a provisional state ment to the effect that they were subject to confirmation by the Shaikh of Qatar. They then enquired what they were to do as they did not seem any further forward and did not like to offer more generous terms without consultation. I suggested/-suggested to them that either they should write to the Shaikh of Qatar or that one or both of them should go and interview him. 3rhis appealed to Shaikh Masir who stated that he would himself go and interview the Shaikh of Qatar and return and that Saleh bin Mana would remain here. I told them that they must inform the Bahrain Government of their intention so that it was clear that they were not breaking off the negotiations. They said they would do so* Shaikh Nasir again appealed to me with regard to the Qatar subjects who were Joining the Na»im and I said that I was not in a position to do anything in the matter, that Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Qassim and the Na’im had given their word that no untoward incident would take place during course of these negotiations and I had no reason to that they were liiujjujja to break their word and that I had no Jurisdiction over the subjects of Qatar. Shaikh Nasir was most insistent that the subjects'of the Shaikh of Qatar should be prevented from joining the Na’im. I said that I could not do anything with the subjects of the Shaikh of Qatar and that it was presumably the Shaikh of Qatar’s own business. The representatives then left stating that Shaikh Nasir would go and return as quickly as possible. 20-5-37.(ns) Telegram From Political Agent, Bahrain. To Political Resident, BusJaire. No. 114i- Dated 20th May 193'!'. CP My telegram No. 11^ May 20th. ■ Bahrain Government has iniormed me in writing that His Highness the Ruler agreed to their proposing on 19th May to the Q.atar representatives the following terms:- 'His Highness the Ruler of Banram agrees : (i) not to press his claim to Zubarah and the Naim tribe, (li) not to in any way develop Zubarah, (iii) to take measures to prevent smuggling through Zubarah into Q,atar, (iv) not to allow settlements in Zuoarah maae oy persons from Bahrain, (v) to preserve the condition oi Zubarah as it was before the present dispute, provided that the Ruler oi Q,atar agrees&gt; (i) not to impose taxation on the permanent normal inhabitants of Zubarah who are the Naim tribeand their delations while they are within the Zubarah area.

I have been ashed to communicate these terms in writing to avoid verbal misunderstandings to the ShaiKh of Qatar and have done so and also sent copies of my communication^ to his representatives. Political.from. To Sir, With reference to the negociations between the representatives of the Hulers of Bahrain and iijattar regarding the Zabara question I have the honour to acquaint you of the result of the fifth meeting which was held yesterday afternoon. 2&lt;&gt; During the morning the Bahrain representatives had a lengthy discussion with His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifah, K.0.1.1., C.S.I., who even tually agreed to their accepting a proposal which had been made by the Rattan representatives on the previous day, but which had not been discussed in any detail, to the effect that the position of Zabara and conditions in Zabara should revert to what they were formerly, before the present dispute arose. 3o The arrangement was proposed by the Bahrain representatives in the following manner. The claim of the Ruler of Bahrain to the ownership No. 385/9-SF - of 1356 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Dated, B/Awal io. 1356 May 20,193$. C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esquire. C.B.E., Adviser to the Government oi Bahrain, Bahrain. His Britannic Majesty*s Political Agent, Bahrain. of —- 2 - of Zabara and his claim that the Maim tribe are his subjects is not disproved. The claim of the Ruler of^atar to the ownership of Zabara and his claim that the Maim tribe are his subjects is also not disproved. The Ruler of Bahrain, in order to preserve the long friendship, both personal and political, between the two Rulers and the two states, agrees, (i) not to press his claim to Zabara and the naim tribe, (ii) not to in any way develop Zabara, (iii) to take measures to prevent smuggling - through Zabara into tyatar, (iv) not to allow settlements in Zabara made by persons from Bahrain, (v) to preserve the condition of Zabara as it was before the present dispute, provided that the Ruler of Qatar agrees, (i) not to impose taxation on the pema ne nt normal inhabitants of Zabara who are the Maim tribe and their relations while they are within the Zabara area. Should they move out of Zabara into other parts of Qatar they become liable to any form of taxation which is normally paid by subjects of Qatar, (ii) not to develop Zabara in any way but to preserve it in the condition that it was in before the present dispute but should the Qattar oil company wish to carry out genuine work within the Zabara area they shall be allowed to do so. 4. After long discussion the Qattar repre sentative* said that they felt sure that the Ruler of Qattar would not agree to the suggestions of Bahrain, it was his intention, to put a military post in one or two of the Maim villages within the Zabara area to prevent smuggling and he could not agree to leave Zabara in its present condition inde—ft ■3- •• indefinitely. The Qattar representatives stated that the only point which they could, provisionally, agree to was to waive customs dues on the actual food supplies of the Naim tribe but that it would first have to pass through a customs post at Zabara. The Bahrain representatives stated that they could not agree to the establishment of posts inside Zabara area but agreed to them being placed on. the edge. 5* They also sjtated that their definition of Zabara was the revived deserted village of that name only, not the area which is bounded by certain villages and ruined towers which is the area claimed by Bahrain. 6. The Bahrain representatives invited the ^atar representatives to inform the Ruler of ftattar of this suggestion but the Qattar representatives again said that it would be useless to do so, so the Bahrain representatives stated that in that case they would request His Britannic Majesty f s Political Agent to make their proposals known to the Ruler of Qattar as his representatives persistently refused to sign any minutes of the meetings or to take any written drafts or notes of suggestions or discussions and they feared that if the proceedings were communi cated to the Ruler of Qattar verbally some misunder standings might occur as to what was said or proposed.

POLITICAL - Sharjah.Translation of letter dated 13th Rabi al Awwal 1356 (24th May 1937) from Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim Al Thani 5 ^ Tiller of Qatar 5 to in* Tomlinson, Assistant Political Agent, B a hrain. After Compli ments • fith reference to the letter received by me from the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf signed by Captain Hickinbotham for His Honour dated 27th Safar 1356 (=9th May 1937) to the effect that the Haim tribe was ordered not to gather and show movements which may startle minds, that they should stop these activities by their dispersing to their own places. But it is regretted that they did not obey His Honour ! s orders and did not act accordingly. But are still con- tinuing their movements and gatherings which I fear might lead to some trouble. I have now learnt that some of them halted in. a well from which the people of Khwair take water situated in the middle of the road between Khwair and Doha planted a flag there and did some acts which would not be tolerated. I hope that you would tell them to stop these deeds and disperse to their own places as long as the negotiations are going on. I deem it necessary to inform you so that you may take action in the matter before anything happens. Usual Ending.Translation of letter dated 13th Safar 1356 (24th May 1937) from Shaikh ’Abdullah bin passim al Thani, Ruler of igatar, to Captain T. Hiekin- botham Political Agent, Bahrain. I had the honour of receiving your letter dated 20th May 1937 equivalent to 9th Rabi al Aval 1356 and noted what was mentioned by you, that Shaikhs Abdullah bin ’Isa and Salman bin Hamad, representatives of His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain, informed you of the pro posals which you sent them in your letter for settlement of Zubarah question. I do not see a slight doubt which may come between my clear right at Zubarah which is one ^ the coasts of Qatar which cannot be separated. I have carried out my action in the whole Qatar territory with out exception and there was no one to oppose me. I am astonished to see this claim which has appeared now- after all the time passed on Qatar. I do not believe that you would agree that the claimants are rightful in their claim which is not established bn a clear proof and reasonable supports. My representatives have explained the proofs pro vided by me to khEmxajsd the representatives of His High ness the Ruler of Bahrain that there is nothing to justilj their claim. I am sure your Honour would appreciate my friend ship to the High British Government and consider the firm relations existing between me and them. I am sure that you will administer justice and equity in this matter and see to the rights properly. I have seen the proposals sent through you by the representatives of His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain. I am not in a posi tion to agree to them* as I fully believe that my right is/-- 2 - is clear in this matter and there is no confusion and difficulty about it and that A1 Jabur are my subjects and I solely have the right to interfere with them .when they get out of my obedience and disobey me I cannot tole rate with them in this way. But as I like to preserve the old friendship and the brothership exchanged between me and His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain I made some modi fications and submitted my proposals wb-ich will be sub mitted to you by my representatives. I hope you will consider this and make sure that this is the last thing I can afford to accept for the settlement of this matter. I have sanguine hope and according to the friendship and sincerity which I feel towards you and in accordance with the strong relations and firm connections which tie me up with the High British Government that you will act accord ing to justice and equity and what you consider proper for respecting the rights and appreciating the obligations. Usual Ending . \In order to preserve the friendship and unity existing between me and His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain I agree as follows:- 1. To keep Zubarah as it was before the occurrence of the present dispute. 2. 'No development should be carried out at Zubarah. But if the Qatar Oil Company wish to do works there they will be allowed to do so and that should be according to the terms of the agree ment. 3. In consideration of the former state, I shall have same as I used to do formerly before the occurrence of the present dispute. 4. No taxation will be imposed on articles, arri ving for the Na T im tribe who normally reside there, for their personal use as long as they 7 f are at Zubarah, but if they move to other places of Qatar then the same taxation which is imposed on other Qatar subjects will be imposed on them. 5. That each of my. subjects and followers who left their villages and places and joined there during the occurrence of the present dispute should return to his own place in accordance with the past condition. provided that His the Ruler of Bahrain agrees to the following:- \l 1. Withdraw the claim for Zubarah and Na»im Tribe 2. Not to carry on, in any way, any development at Zubarah. 5. Undertake to take effective measures to pre- # vent smuggling through Zubarah to Qatar and checking the goods from Bahrain to Qatar and watching the small dhows.. ■ ■ * ■MMTo permit the people of Qatar to take whatever they want of the goods arrived in the way of tran shipment from the steamers and sailing boats as it is the case with Najd.CONFIDMTIAL.

Shaikh Nasir and Saleh bin Mans, came to see me concerning the Zubarah Question* They handed me a letter for .’forwa.rd.irg to the Political Agenta letter for myself and a paper embodying the proposals put forward by the Shaikh of Qatar. The letter to myself dealt chiefly with the pro blem of the Naiim tribe, who, they stated, had now noved across to a well situated between Khwair and Doha. They further stated that they had hoisted four flags in their camp Mien I asked whether they had definitely seen these flags they replied that they had not done so, hurt that they were given to understand that the flags were definitely Bahraini. Their complaint was that the tribe were attempting by pro paganda and by bribery to obtain adherence from the sub jects of the Shaikh. I further gained the general imp ression that they had not been unsuccessful in this attempt. The representatives requested that an urgent message should be sent to warn the Na ! im that they ¥&gt;rere not adhering to their premise given to the Political Resident that they would disperse. They further pointed out that the Shaikh of Qatar was still rigidly adhering to his promise of in action and was as yet taking no action against the tribes men. The representatives stated further that matters were coming to -Such an intolerable pitch that unless action was taken fairly soon the Shaikh of Qatar would be unable to remain inactive any further. 2. The letter to the Political Agent reiterated the determination of the Shaikh to stand by his rights. I pro mised to inform the Political Agent who was then at Sharjah at the earliest opportunity and I also promised to send down immediately the letter from the Shaikh to him and a copy/-- 2 ~ copy of the proposals of the Shaikh. 5. Mien the representatives had gone I immediately sent a telegram giving the details of the letter to my self and informing him that a letter from the Shaikh of Qatar and a copy of the Shaikh’s proposals were coming down, that day by air mail. Sd/~ B.T. Dictated on 29-5-57.The Qatar representatives visited me for a fur ther conversation on Saturday, May 29th. Their attentions then appeared to have been di verted from the Na f im to the misdemeanour of one Sa T ud a nephew of the Shaikh who it appears had stolen two horses and two camels and dgcamped by night to the Na»im at Zubarah where he received a riotous welcome. The representatives were extremely exercised in their minds because they said that information had been received that the Shaikh of Bahrain had sent a launch across for the purpose of bringing Sa^ud to Bahrain. They implored me to intercede in order that so hospitable a welcome should not be accorded to him as would give umbrage to the Shaikh of Qatar in showing him that one who on the face of it was intransigent and recalcitrant should re ceive this honourable welcome which of itself would be \ a slight upon the Shaikh. The Qatar representatives further showed their disappointment in that they have now been in Bahrain for four days and as yet had re ceived no direct invitation to resume conversations with the Bahrain Government- I replied that I thought this was in all likelihood a misunderstanding on both sides as I myself had seen the Adviser and he had definitely given the impression that the Bahrain Government were prepared at any time to resume the conversations. They replied to this that it was strange that the Bahrain Government had not taken the first step towards the reopening of the negotiations because in the past they had always first sent intimation as to when they would like the represen tatives of Qatar to come for a discussion. I told them that I would inform the Adviser immediately of this impasse and that I would also speak to him concerning the/-- 2 - the reception of Sa ! ud. I further pointed out to them that I could in this matter do really nothing as it was a question of Shaikhly hospitality and as they were also aware we do not wish to enter too deeply into these affairs as we still hope that the problem may be amicably settled between the two Shaikhs. They appeared to be satisfied with this and said that they would be prepared to discuss with the Bahrain Government immediately they received intimation. I then rang up the Adviser to the Bahrain Govern ment and discovered that my supposition concerning the failure to convene a meeting was correct in so far as the Bahrain Government were also waiting for the repre sentatives of Qatar to make the prior move as they had done in previous occasions. He said that he would send a messenger to them immediately concerning the reopen ing of the discussions. Id/- B.T. 29-5-57.. • - ... . - . left sin Sa'iid ai not thirl life, ...I subsequently saw the Adviser and he informed me that the Qatar representatives had been invited to a discussion on 30th May 1937. He also gave me another version concerning the aforementioned Satud. It appears that one Sa f ud bin Thani bin Jassim whose father Nasir bin Jassim is brother to Shaikh »Abdullah, has been living in the menage of Shaikh 1 Abdullah. Wasir bin Jassim, on the other hand, has been living for a con siderable time in Hasar and only just recently returned to Doha. Sa^ud one night with nine followers departed on stolen transport for the Na ! im. Nasir bin Jassim was ordered to pursue, which he did, in four cars with some 30 armed fellows. They got up with Sa*ud and after a parley Sa f ud proceeded to shoot his father in the left shoulder. A further parley ensued, aftefc which Sa ! ud and 1aro followers were rather surprisingly permitted to make their way to the Na*im, whilst the remaining six followers returned to Doha. As regards the story that a launch had been sent to bring Sa f ud to Bahrain the Adviser inforired me that this matter had been men - tioned to Shaikhs Abdullah and Salman this morning and they had both stated with some certainty that they did not think for one moment that Sa*ud would leave the Naiim and come to Bahrain. It will now be interesting to see whose version is correct. My general impression is that the Shaikh of Qatar f s position is being daily weakened by defec tions not only of outside notables but from his own family. He will very shortly not be in a sufficiently strong position to make any terms whatsoever and indeed rumours are circulating that he goes daily in fear of his life- 2 ~ I handed a copy of the Shaikh of Qatar*s proposals to the Adviser which Saleh bin Mana had asked me to do that morning. The Adviser informed me that the Bahrain Government had a counter proposal ready if necessary, the basis of which was that they were prepared to concede all the area directly extraneous to Eubarah itself provided the Bahrain Government were permitted to retain Zubarah itself to do with exactly as they wished. We were agreed that provided any vestige of poY*rer remained with Shaikh ’Abdullah, there was no reason why a compromise should not be fe satisfactorily arrived at in this form - whilst the Na*im should be given the right to decide by plebiscite as to which ruler they desire to serve, and of course should they move into any portion of Qatar belonging to the Shaikh of Qatar, after having admitted, for example, Bahrain nationality, they would then ipso facto be liable for pay ment of all taxation that at that time had been imposed upon the ether adherents to Qatar, Id/- B*T, 29-5-3?CONFIDENTIAL.

Ho. C/439-4/15 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 8th June 1937. From Lieutenant B.L.M. Tomlinson, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, To The Political Agent, Bahrain, On Tour, Camp Sharjah. Sir, I have the honour to enclose a note on a recent discussion with the Qatar representatives which is self- , explanatory. 2, The Adviser immediately afterwards telephoned and told me that a deadlock had been arrived at. This coin cided with my general opinion on the situation. There is going to be a further discussion between Qatar and Bahrain on the 11th June. Bahrain, I gather from the Adviser, are prepared to go to extreme lengths and to higher and ever higher courts in this question not with any idea of — gain but purely as a matter of principle. I gathered from the Adviser that they had not actually discussed any question of extraneous arbitration with the Qatar representatives, I have the honour to be, T» Your most obedient, servant.The Qatar representatives, Shaikh Kasir and Saleh bln Mana, came for discussion on the 8th of June. They stated that in their previous meeting with the Bahrain representatives they had gone into the question of the final proposals of Shaikh 1 Abdullah, the Ruler of Qatar# 2* They said that the Bahrain Government had agreed to a large proportion of Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Qassim’s proposals but were desirous of definitely altering one or two of the clauses (I fancy that the main alteration insisted upon by Bahrain was that referring to the claim of Subarah in toto) ♦ 3. They had the day before received a message from the Ruler of Qatar saying that he was not in any way prepared to alter his. original proposals. 4 . They then stated that they could further now pro duce documentary proof as to the suzerainty over the ba f im tribe. This proof, they said, consisted of letters : m the British Government to the Ruler of Qatar c mplaining against certain misdemeanours performed by tee members of that tribe. This they averred was obviously a complete tacit admission as to teo was the correct overlord of the Ka'im. They are prepared, they say, to produce te*se documents. 5. They teen stated that they further had what they considered to be conclusive documentary proof not only as to the ownership of Zubarah (concerning which they said the Agreement ratified by His Majesty*s Government constitutes proof of the ownership of the entire Qatar Peninsula by the Ruler of Qatar) but also cf tee true overlordship of the Ha*im again implied by the protest concerning them sent by His Majesty's Government to the'/-the Ruler of Qatar and not to the Ruler of Bahrain. 6# Bahrain* on the other hand* they said had expended tremendous number of words but were un prepared or unwilling or unable to produce one scrap of documentary evidence in favour of their claims. 7. The question then arose concerning the ultimate arrival at a compromise* I asked Saleh bin Mana direct if he considered both aides taking up this attitude - whether there was any hope of a decision being reached without the assistance of an arbitrator. He replied that the Shaikh of Qatar was not prepared to go any further as he had even now made far greater concessions than he considered he should have mid© merely in order to retain the good friendship of the Ruler of Bahrain* B* The Qatar representatives were very strongly in favour of the matter being settled by arbitration. They stated that the Bahrain Government were not pre pared to agree to tills. This fact, they pointed out* in itself militated against the Bahrain claims insofar as whilst Qatar by acknowledging their readiness to receive a Judgment felt assured of the strength of their claim, the very unwillingness of Bahrain was a powerful proof that they have no substantiation to any of the statements which they bad made. 9, I then told the Qatar representatives that although they mst realise that as always I can only report to ^ senior officer the Political Agent and it is entirely up to him and the Political Resident to ®alte decisions, .evertheless, I would point out the fact that a deadlock seems to have been arrived at and now that definite/-definite cl alias, proofs and proposals were all ready to hand I thought that unfortunate though it was, never theless, the time for arbitration had come* Hy reasons for this were that it was my considered opinion that an arbitrator might now after all that had passed be able to arrive at some decision which would not only deal equitably with the entire subject but enable the long-standing friendship between Bahrain and Qatar to remain undamaged* 10* I* therefore, assured the Qatar representatives that I would send an air mall letter summarising their statements and putting forward this suggestion* I warned them stringently that this in no way committed us as the entire matter rested in the hands of the Political Resi dent and the Political Agent* \ 1 - * 'Filially I pointed out that of course'no question of arbitration, however hypothetical it might be, could be raised without the complete acquiescence of the Bahrain , Sd/~ B.T.

Bahrain, they said, were not prepared to accept an arbit rator nor were they prepared in any way to go any further towards meeting the suggestions of Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Oassim* The Qatar representatives were extremely exer cised in their minds and asked w advice as to whether they should not immediately go back to Qatar. X replied that I thought it would be a very great pity if tney ald ] and strongly advised them to remain here until the return of the Political Agent* They then said that Shaikh ’Abdul lah bin Cassim had throughout in every way complied with the requests of the Political Besldent but now the time had come when he could no longer acquiesce to the various unfriendly acts that were being committed against aim ana if once they reburned and informed him of the results of this final conversation they considered that he would be forced to take action. I very strongly advised them against doing anything on the spur of the moment. I pointed out that they were possibly disappointed and chagrined at the present spment but that actions taken in hot blood nearly always led to ultimate regret. I told them that I would immediately telegraph to the Political Agent after of course X had obtained verification from the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. They agreed that they would not depart in a hurry and also would not send off any despatch without due and full consideration. &lt;3 rj /- B. T ( o ml 1 n s o n) 10th June 1937.After the departure of the Qatar representatives on June the 10th I had an interview with the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. He stated that as regards the statement of the Qatar representatives that the Bahrain Government had. definitely broken off all negotiations this was absolutely untrue. Hi&amp;t the Bahrain Government had actually said was that they were not prepared to fall in with the deterstLns.tion of the Bhaitei of »^atar to adhere to his original wording of paragraph 1 of his stipulations concerning the actions of the Shaikh of Bahrain (This pro posal was handed in on the 28th of Bay)« Th® Bahrein Government^ he said* were coiap3.eteiy ready to continue tne discussions. He then put forward a suggestion that pos.su.bly a solution would fee for a ffleniber of the Bahrain Boyal Family such as Shaikh »Abdullah bin *Isa to go across in order to meet the Shall* of Qatar himself or e near enough rela- midwnw , . tive perhaps fit a spot/jjstween Zubarah ami Done.' -* c seia that of course he would have to get sanction for this pro posal from His Highness but that he would definitely put this up as a way of avoiding the general i«*&gt;»sse v.nich seemed to be fit hand. He requested me to see the Qatar representatives on the morning of the 11th and inform the* that the Bahrain Government do not wish to break off nego tiations. I said that this was unusual as I had never be fore summoned them - they had always come to me of their free will but in this case I would definitely do it and also would inform them as he suggested that the original idea of leaving the status quo of Subarsh indeterminate should again be sooted. He told me that they had definitely suggested a meeting between the two Shaikhs but this had ■HEbeen completely Ignored bj the ShaiMis S; leli and Hasir# X told him that I thought that this was an extremely good idea as judging by the conversation of the Qatar representa tives Shaikh ?

I have the honour to submit to your Honour the question of Zubarah. I have explained to your Honour repeatedly about the provocation caused and the agression done to us by Bahrain on account of this imaginary claim which is not set up on a foundation or basis according to intellect and logic. I am surprised at this claim which they have created in connection v^ith Zubarah which is my land and one of the Qatari Coasts. Honourable the Political Resident i You asked me when you visited Doha to send two representatives in order to negotiate about the Zubarah Question and as I informed your Honour that I was quite certain that there was no necessity for negotiation in a clear matter* but I could not disagree with your wishes. And in accordance with your desire X sent my two representatives to Bahrain for negotiation under the supervision of His Britannic Majesty r s Political Agent there. negotiations started on the subjecy and my representatives x ooduced clear proofs that Zubarah is a part inseperable from the Qatar Territory. In conc.lusion proposals were set forth to me by the repres entatives of H.H. the Ruler cf Bahrain to which I did not agree because I considered it the same claim which they created but in order to preserve the friendly relations existing between me and H.H. the Ruler oi Bahrain and in support of the mutual neighbourly friendship I inserted some modifications in the same and sent it to them through H.B.M’s Political Agent. I intimated&gt; triL 2. this to you and sent a copy of the modification thereof. I have also informed Your Honour that that was the extreme limit possible for agreement,afterwards I learnt that the claimants are still sticking to their own views and that they want to encroach upon my rights, and try to cu^ s. port from my land and a coast from my coasts. Honourable the Political Resident l I am certain that my proof is clear and known even to the nigh British Government from the time they entered into Treaties with Bahrain and granted them protection in connection with their boundary. They undoubtedly knew that Zubarah had nothing to do with that. The High British Government also granted to us protection of land and by sea to all Qatar without exception and recognized the independence of all Qatar state under my ruling flag. Is it possible that the High British Government granted that to us they had any doubt about Zubarah and did not make it clear to us or draw our attention to it. lately a negotiation took place between me and the Anglo Iranian Oil Company Limited n Qatar territory and excavation m for the survey m all ^ n pq its land, boundary and Coasts. Their agreement conclude by the permission of the High British Government^and survey carried out in all Qatar lands, Zuba . drawn „ ,, ria+ar state including Zubarai£ This map consisting of all Qatar t negotiation ««= going on th^s.W CoW about oil aev.lopn.nt in .hole Qatar bea. or nlaoee a. shorn in • not ion was concluded aiid when I the map. ^^^love^by British Government I agreed sa, thaT?t“i 8 SSSl-«b the saia Co^an, ana signed the concession for the Company a. 1.M 4o« in the agreem.nt »hich is concluded bet.een ms and them.

This took eitee, oy yuu i.iripri in connection with all Qatar Territory, which was concluded in coimct-o I |]|including Zubarah according to the map connected to the agreement# Your Honour confirmed this without hesitation. It is nov/ surprising as to the creation of this new claim on the part of His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain about Zubarah. Today after the conclusion of the Treaties between us and the High British Government and after that of the negotiation and the granting of concession of all Qatar, Zubarah etcetera without exception. If there was any smallest claim or the slightest doubt on the part of the Bahrain people they would have not left out and ignored it in these conditions and during ail these changes. But they knew that they have no right to the same« I am sure therefore that you are aware of all these proofs and contexts and see that this claim of theirs is useless and they have not the slightest connection or right to what they claim. I hope that your Honour will consider this matter keeping a limit for this encroachment and c ausing the settlement of this case by putting an end to the dispute, because, as it seems to you the claim of Bahrain people to our boundary is merely useless and agressive one. 5 m I am confident of your nobility and justice and your inclination of the right side . \ou will not agree to the usurpation of our rights and will prefer right and justice in any way. I have also to draw your attention to thee friendly relations existing between me and the High British Government and to the Treaties which are known to you. I am still the same friend that always wishes to preserve what would satisfy the High British Government and please tnem.

Dated, B/Thany 3. 1356 June 12, 1937. From C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esquire, C.B.E., Adviser to tne (xovernment, Bahrain. To His Britannic Majesty 1 s Political Agent Bahrain. - Sir, I have the honour to refer to the negotia- v tions regarding the Zubara dispute which have been in progress for a month. His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad and his representatives think it is unlikely that any further real progress will be made as long as the discussions are con ducted with the two persons at present representing the Ruler of Qatar. The choice of Saleh bin Mana as a representative of %atar was uni ortunate as owing to his behaviour in Bahrain and his lack of manners towards His Highness, he is not a persona grata,. Shaikh Nasr, though personally acceptable, has scarcely taken any part in the conversations and as he is unable to read or write the Bahrain representatives feel that any 0 x 3 inions that he may have are completely submerged by those of his colleage. The Qattar representatives were only accepted oy Bahrain because His Highness was anxious to effect a —-2- ■ effect a friendly agreement between himself and the Ruler of l^atar. 2. His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad is aware of the state of internal disorder in Qatar, which is increasing daily, and he wishes to do all that he can towards terminating the present situation by settling his part of the dispute amicably* He believes that if there could be a meeting between his brother Shaikh Abdullah and his eldest son Shaikh Sulman and two of the near relations of the Ruler of Qatar, his brothers or his sons, an agreement might be arrived at. He does not wish to put this sug gestion to Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim f s represen- tatives as he thinks it possible that they would resent the proposal, he has therefore instructed me to acquaint you with the suggestion and to ask you if you will lay it before Shaikh Abdullah and if you approve of it, request him to agree to the meeting. 3. His Highness attaches great importance to the place of meeting. He does not think that Shaikh Abdullah would agree to send his relations to Bahrain as it might appear to the public that they had come to ask for favours, therefore he does not wish to ask them to come here. He also cannot consider sending his own relations to Doha. He is willing however to send his representatives to the coast of Qatar to a point in Qatar at a distance of, say, ten miles from the boundaries of the Zubara area where a meeting could be held. 4. His Highness knows that his offer to send his relations to Qatar to discuss the question may —v -3- may be regarded in some quarters as an admis sion of weakness but he is prepared to accept such criticism in the hope of obtaining a peaceful settlement of the dispute.

Ruler of qatar Abdulla al ThaniCopy Fran - Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani, C.I.E., Ruler of qatar. To - The Hon'ble Lt*-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E*, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Dated 13th Rabi al Awwal 1356 ( 24th May 1937). After compliments, In conformity with Your Honour^ wishes I sent my representatives to Bahrain to conduct negotiations about the question of Zubarah although I do not see that there is any misunderstanding in the matter which may call for negotiations. Zubarah, as Your Honour is aware, is one of the coasts of qatar and is an inalienable part of its territory and I have been ruling over it, in its entirety, and without any exception. And the Haim tribesmen are my subjects. They \ were one of the tribes of Qatar State in the past and continue to be so until now. The claim made against this is therefore an unjust one and is considered an act of aggression upon others* rights. I have, however, no alternative but to concur with your views. My two representatives have since reached Bahrain and have produced proofs and evidence to establish that Zubarah is one of the coasts of Qatar State and that the Haim are my followers and subjects while the claimants have no clear proofs acceptable to comuion sense or logically' admissible to offer in support of their claim. I am quite positive that Your Honour will adopt what justice dictates in this question and will give your full consideration to the rights involved. I rely on the strong _ friendly /-2- friendly relations which exist between me and His Britannic Majesty’s Government, who, I am sure, would not agree that any of my rights should be spoiled. I will endeavour to prove to the Government that I am the friend who appreciates their friend ship and continues strengthening his relations with them by doing such things as would please and satisfy them. The representatives of His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain submitted to me certain proposals which it was beyond my power to accept in consideration of the defects that they contained as I am quite confident that my rights in this question are clear, and that the Naim are my subjects, and I enjoy the right to deal with them whenever they would disobey my orders or rebel against me, and that I can have no patience with them in the present situation. But in order to maintain the old friendship and mutual friendliness which exist between me and His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain I made some amendments and \ forwarded my own proposals. Forwarding a copy of the proposals herewith ior Your Honour’s information, I request that you may carefully think over it and know for certain tmt this is the utmost that I can accept for the solution of this question. fith a view to the friendship and sincerity which I maintain towards Your Honour and the strong good relations which connect me with His Britannic Majesty’s Government I trust that Your Honour will gtve a decision based on justice and equity in this quest! on for which I would be most grateful to you. I have sent my proposals with my representatives to the Political Agent, Bahrain, so rth&amp;t he may pass them on t o the Committee of delegates appointed by His Highness the Ruler of Bahra in. In conclusion I offer Your Honour ray distinguished consideration and test wishes hoping that you are in the best condition; of health.In order to maintain friendly relations and unity between myself and His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain I agree to the following i- 1, I agree (to the following) on condition that Zubarah should remain (in the same status) as it was before the occurrence of the present dispute, 2, That no building should be erected at Zuoarah but if the }atar Oil Company wish to carry out some works there they will be allowed to do so in accordance with the terms of their agreement, 3, r a king into consideration the former status 1 should enjoy the same rights which I used to exercise tnere before the occun — ence of the present dispute, 4, I will not impose any duty upon such articles as are brought for the special purpose of the living of the Naim trice as long as they would remain at zu'oarah. But if they move to other parts of qatar State they will be liable to pay the same taxes which are recovered from other Q.atar subjects# 5, My subjects and followers who have left their villages and abodes and went over during the occurrence of the present incident should return to their former habitation where they formerly lived ante bellum, I agree to the above provided that His Highness the Huler of Bahrain would agree to the following 1. That he should withdraw his claim to Zubarah and the Haim tribe, 2. That he should, in no way, construct any building at zubarah. 3. That he should undertake to take active measures for prevent ing smuggling to qatar through zubarah by controlling the export _ , . 4 .^ and bv watching small boats* of goods from Bahrain to Qatar ana cy &amp; . qh on Id b e all ow ed to take fr om 4.

I pointed out to the Qatar representatives that no progress had been made and that they appeared to have contented themselves with rejecting every proposal that had been put forward by the Ruler of Bahrain's representatives and had made no fresh suggestion on be half of Shaikh Abdullah. They complained that Bahrain was arming the Naim and that the Naim were committing various acts which were not in conformity with the under taking made by them to the Resident. They were, however, unable to mention by name anyone who had suffered at the ftanHg Of the Naim or anyone who had actually seen dhows, ammunition or rifles leaving Bahrain. They alleged that certain warlike demonstrations had occurred in Mnharraq and I understand that there is a certain amount of truth in this statement as Shaikh Mohammad has been being silly although the Ruler of Bahrain has issued very clear orders and the occurrences conplained of had ceased. 19-6-37.CONFIDENTIAL.

Shaikh Abdullah bin f Isa and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad* Mr* Bel- grave the Adviser was present* After general matters had been discussed the question of lubarah was raised. I showed His Highness a copy of a letter I was sending containing his proposals to Shaikh Abdullah bin Jassim of Qatar. His Highness raised the question of the possi bility of Shaikh Abdullah attacking the Naim and I told him that in my opinion Shaikh Abdullah would not be so foolish as to break the a^PULiuOTL which he had given to the Honourable the Political Resident. It seemed to me that they placed little hope in Shaikh Abdullah bin Jassim agreeing to sending his near relatives to meeting: Shaikh Abdullah bin *lsa and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad. They were very perturbed regarding the course to be pursued in the event of Shaikh Abdullah refusing to continue negotiations. It seemed to me that Shaikh Mohammad bin ^Isa was anxious for his brother to make an appeal for arbitration to His Mh3esty f s Government and also to ask for us to interfere on behalf of the Naim pending the e£e£r±ng-of such an appeal. Shaikh Abdullah bin *isa and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad rather advocated taking no action but letting the Naim and Shaikh Abdullah bin Jassim settle their differen ces. I think that they were prepared to, and woTjuld if necessary, take whatever action was possible to assist the Naim from Bahrain without doing anything openly. After considerable discussion I toldthat I would send the letter containing His Highness 1 proposed meeting to Shaikh Abdullah bin Jassim and that in the meantime they should consider/-consider what waa ^gge action they wished to pursue in the event of the negotiations being terminated. 20th Jane 1937. /U.► s— i.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that another meeting regarding the Zubara question was held this morning lasting for about four hours. 2. The Q^atar representatives enquired whether we had considered Shaikh Abdullah’s draft agreement. They were informed that in its existing form it was not acceptable. We made certain suggestions slightly altering the wording of the clauses as follows•- In section 2 part 1 ’’according to the terms of the agreement” should De left out. The Shaikh of Bahrain is in no way concerned with any obligations under the oil agreement between Shaikh Aodullah and the ^atar oil company. He cannot agree to the mention of conditions in an agreement to which he is not a party and which he has never seen. If %atar insists on mentioning the terms of the oil agreement the agree ment itself should be filed with this undertaking between the two Rulers. Q^atar representatives refused to make any alterations.— 3 - 3. Qatar representatives objected to the word f, Agareb ,, . We agreed to exclude this word and to give a list of the permanent residents of Zubara not actually belonging to the Naim. There are very few. Qatar representatives agreed that these persons would not be taxed but they would not consider a list. We suggested instead of 'igareb', ,f the followers of His Highness Shaikh Hamad who have always lived there n . ^atar repre sentatives agreed that these would not be taxed, but should not be mentioned. 4. Bahrain agreed to withdraw claim as follows:- n As long as the above conditions are carried out without alterations I agree to withdraw my claim to Zubara and the Naim but should there happen anything contrary to any of these conditions my claim returns as before 11 . Qatar representatives refused to accept this although admitting that in effect it was the same as their suggestion. They said if either party failed to carry out obligations the agreement was null and void but this fact need not be stated. Qatar representa tives then said Shaikh Abdullah would not make any agreement unless it was word for word according to his draft. 5. They were asked three times to inform Shaikh Abdullah of our latest suggestions especially regarding withdrawal of claim. They refused to inform him. when asked why they would not inform him, they refused to reply. 6. They were asked to take a letter or note containing the new suggestions made today. They refused to take any letter or note or anything written.7. They were then asked to state, in writing, that Shaikh Abdullah would not agree to any terms except his own. This they refused to do. 8. They stated that actually negotiations had ceased some days ago and they did not intend to dis cuss the matter further. They announced that they were sailing immediately. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Adviser to the Government.Draft as approved by Bahrain. The Ruler of i^atar agrees 2ubara as it was before the occurrence oi the present dispute. (Agreed) 2. No development will be carried out at Zubara but ii tne ^atar oil company wish to do work there they will be allowed to do so.

In consideration of the former state I shall have same as I used to do formerly before the occurrence of the present dispute. (Agreed) 4. No taxes will be imposed on the Naim tribe and the followers of Shaikh Hamadi/fco originally- lived in Zubara area but should they move lo another part of ^atar then taxes will be levied on them as on subjects of ^atar.

I understand that there has been some talk lately of Shaikh ^Abdullah bin Qasim of Qatar making a port and pier at Zubarah and it is said that they have dug up a 2 .un r* belonging to the Khalifah. I AiZt. understand that there is a good deai;on the subject u among the s^uiiy Khaiifah^ and it seems possible that the decision regarding Zubarah is not widely known though it should be known to the Shaikh and his brothers. 3. When Shaikh^Abdullah^saw,the *Resident during his recent visit I understand that he introduced the subject of Zubarah indirectly by talking of our flight over Qatar and saying that it was no doubt to see the boundaries of Qatar and enquiring about the boundaries of Bahrain, to which it is said that the Resident replied that the boundaries of Bahrain were the sea. I will enquire from P.R. on his forth coming visit whether this is so. In the meantime pps should be got out urgently. 4. I have promised the Adviser a copy of the letter conveying the decision to Shaikh ! lsa or possibly send it to the Shaikhfir Confidential. 3o4- I understand from an ordinary source that ZTIBARAH, the ownership of which remained unsettled since the 'battle of Zubarah which was fought about 70 years ago, is going to be the subject matter of a tensible feeling between the A1 Khalifahs and A! Thani. A1 Khalifahs think that the tract belongs to Bahrain v/hereas on account of favourable physical situation of the place, A1 Thani thinks that it is a part of Qatar territory. Since the land is unpopulated, it remained without being attractive to any side so far. But owing to the development of petroleum, Zubarah has become a place of interest and Shaikh Hamad bin Qasem A1 Thani has started populating the tract with Qatar subjects in order to ensure the claim of ownership of the land. jfu Tr, ■ ^ Vt-4- u. YZ-y*~'’ i v*C i^yi mThe Resident is drafting a letter on the subject of Zubarah and certain old correspondence will be looked up in Bushire. I told the Resident that I thought that Bahrain had a real claim to Zubarah as Shaikh Isa^ orders certainly used to be obeyed and the place is inhabited largely by fiopoianc tivhi*,' ^ from Hidd and from RucPak and no Qatar customs are taken. I explained that the Zubarah area was a large semi-circlet-c/ enclave! with tov/ers around it. I did not know that a±± the towers had been occupied in recent times. I finally beg ged the Resident not to suggest any course to Government until he hadjjan opportunity of finding out the Shaikh* s attitude in the matter because I felt certain that if we refusS) Zubarah to Bahrain (unless the old correspondence which I have not seen definitely refused it to them in the pa stl I i.-^ 4 well start a running sore which will poison our relations with Bahrain. I pointed out that Bahrain is our n strong point” in the Gulf and essentially friendly to us. It was, there fore, very necessary to avoid starting what may possibly prove a very difficult grievance. 2. The Resident pointed out that Qatar had already been given to Petroleum Concessions in their Concession and that no question of Zubarah had come up at that time. I said that although the Concession was known the detail of it was not known to the Shaikh or/would have undoubtedly spoken about Zubarah. I personally think that if the Oil Concession is a stumbling block in the matter we should arrange a compromise by getting the Shaikh to recognise Petroleum Concessions* concession and therefore is a condition to our recongnising it to be a Bahrain possession. 3.

The two letters which were addressed to His Highness and to Shaikh 1 Abdullah bin Qassim are at pages -34 and 35 of file 4/13. These letters were signed by me after approval by Colonel Loch. 2. Will you please see a note at page 36 of the same file which was made by Colonel Loch of an inter view between His Highness, Colonel Loch and myself. This interview took place on the morning of the B8th April. 3. I had an interview/ with the Adviser this after noon and he told me that His Highness was feeling very / deeply his responsibility to the Na’im. His Highness considers that the Ns4im are his subjects and that they look to him to protect them from outside interference. 4. I asked the Adviser to inform the Shaikh that I quite understood his point of view and I myself was proceeding to Zubarah in accordance with your instruc tions and would meet the leaders of the Nalim tribe. I informed the Adviser for His Highness 1 information that you would be arriving here on the 3rd of May and that he would have every opportunity of stating his case in person to you. I have not been able to find- out for certain who started the present trouble over Zubarah, but I think that the real cause is that the Bahrain Government believe that in the ev* nt of the Qatar Oil Company making a port on the west coast of Qatar the trade of Bahrain will be damaged. His Highness says that they are not interested in the ques tion of a port but I suspect they are afraid that al though no customs duties will be charged to the Oil Company for import of material required for drilling I end production, a port on the west coast of Qatar would draw/-3/0 -P. draw a number of merchants from Bahrain for purposes of trade wish the employees of the Oil Company and for other purposes ss well. Imports, such as food stuff and. ordinary merchandise not destined for the Company would naturally be subject to import dues and would probably proceed direct instead of coming through Bahrain as they do now. 5. Mr. Packer in an interview he had with Colonel Loch on the BSth stated that the Company had no intentionr of making a port at Zubarah and were in no vay interest ed in Zubarah. 6 . I have informed Group Captain Ca.llaway of my movements end that I do not expect that he will be re quired beyond Sunday and that the Furopean personnel of the Company have been evacuated. 7. I spoke to Mr. Ler.mitte of the Qatar Oil Company * on the telephone this morning. He returned from there yesterday and told me that there was some excitement in Doha three or four days ago but that it was quieted by the Shaikh and that there have been no further recurrences. The Shaikh and his family have left Doha for their gar dens two or three miles distant.27' Resident’s letter No. C/124 dated 5-5-37 File T.E.

No.331-S dated 13-5-37 from P.R. Bushire.CONFIDENTIAL* P*A. In accordance with your instructions, I went yesterday to the office of Khalil ? Kanoo in connection with the question of the motor-car of K.S.Sayid Abdur Razzaq. While I was sitting Nasir bin Atiyah and Salih al Mani T came there as the latter wanted to buy some motor car tools. They were accompanied by T Abdullah bin Darwish, the Agent of A.I.O.C. at Qatar, but Jie left tjjem and went away. After a wAile, SaliA al feni' called me to one side and said tAat Ae Aad a particular talk and wisAes to see you about it to-morrow(18.5.37)at any time you may fiix for Aim. Tnen Ae said tAat a letter was sent by you yesterday to Nasir bin AtiyaA about tAe negotiations and was not addressed to him too. He said that Ae takes it that you do not aesire that Ae should take part in the negotiations as a Representative of the Shaikh of Qatar. He added that if you ao not wish him to take part in the negotiations, he will withdraw Aimslef. Further Ae said that the first letter sent by you to Nasir asking Aim to come and see you with Salih on the 16th May had hurt his feeling as it was not addressed to both of them equally as representatives and that the second letter of yesterday was on the same lines too and which hurt Ais feeling the more. There were signs of displeasure on Ais face and was talking with a heavy heart. I did not give him any reply about this but said that I will inform you that Salih wants to see you. Later I went and met ’Abdullah bin Darwsih. He said that he came to Bahrain 5 days ago for the purpose of medical treatment and that he will return to Qatar on Thursday next. In the course of talk, he said that every thing is quiet in ^atar. I do not know how far Ais statement; is correct but naturally he cannot say anything against Qatar. Then he started praising Nasir and Salih too. Although he praised Salih before me but I am sure that he is inwardly against him.2 . 1)4 SlliJi al LIani T most of the time stays on his private launch which in Manahah harbour and last night both he and Nasir were invited to dinner by K.S.Yusuf Kanoo. I heard that the cause of ill this Zubarah trouble is Husain Na f mah, the present Director of Customs at ^atar because he put in the mind of Shailh f Abdullah bin ^asim that people smuggle goods from Subarah into Qatar ana that P.A.

The hostilities began after the ruler of Qatar, Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Jāsim Āl Thānī, attempted to impose taxation on members of the Al Naim tribe who were resident in Zubarah but proclaimed allegiance to the Āl Khalīfah family.The correspondence (in English and Arabic) is primarily between British officials (Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Percy Gordon Loch and Political Agent in Bahrain, Tom Hickinbotham) and the rulers of Bahrain and Qatar, Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Jāsim Āl Thānī and Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah, respectively. The file also contains correspondence between Charles Belgrave, Adviser to the Government of Bahrain and Hickinbotham.The file contains three black and white aerial photographs of Zubarah (ff 80-81).On folios 82-92 the file contains a report written by Hickinbotham entitled 'Zubarah incident' that contains a summary of relevant events and recommendations for British Policy on the issue.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Qatar</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Na'īm (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Zubarah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003a9#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
