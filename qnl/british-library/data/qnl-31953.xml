To facilitate the collection of these dues, merchant vessels passing the Straits will communicate to stations appointed by the Turkish Government their name, nationality, tonnage and destination. Pilotage remains optional. (b.) Pn Time of War, Turkey being Neutral. Complete freedom of navigation and passage by day and by night under the same conditions as above. The duties and rights of Turkey as a neutral Power cannot authorise her to take any measures liable to interfere with navigation through the Straits, the waters of which, and the air above which, must remain entirely free in time of war, Turkey being neutral just as in time of peace. Pilotage remains optional.© i 115 (c.) In Time of War, Turkey being a Belligerent. Freedom of navigation for neutral vessels and neutral non-military aircraft, if the vessel or aircraft in question does not assist the enemy, particularly by carrying contraband, troops or enemy nationals. Turkey will have the right to visit and search such vessels and air craft, and for this purpose aircraft are to alight on the ground or on the sea in such areas as are specified and prepared for this purpose by Turkey. The rights of Turkey to apply to enemy vessels the measures allowed by international law are not affected. Turkey will have full power to take such measures as she may consider necessary to prevent enemy vessels from using the Straits. These measures, however, are not to be of such a nature as to prevent the free passage of neutral vessels, and Turkey agrees to provide such vessels with either the necessary instructions or pilots for the above purpose. 2 . Warships, including Fleet Auxiliaries, Troopships, Aircraft Carriers and Military Aircraft. (a) In Time of Peace..

(b) In Time of War, Turkey being Neutral. Complete freedom of passage by day and by night under any Hag, without any formalities, or tax, or charge whatever, under the same limitations as in paragraph 2 {a). However, these limitations will not be applicable to any belligerent Power to the prejudice of its belligerent rights in the Black Sea. The rights and duties of Turkey as a neutral Power cannot authorise her to take any measures liable to interfere with navigation through the Straits, the waters of which, and the air above which, must remain entirely free in time of war, Turkey being neutral, just as in time of peace. Warships and military aircraft of belligerents will be forbidden to make any capture, to exercise the right of visit and search, or to carry out any other hostile act in the Straits. As regards revictualling and carrying out repairs, war vessels will be subject to the terms of the Thirteenth Hague Convention of 1907, dealing with maritime neutrality.

Article 1. From the coming into force of the present Convention, the tariffs applicable on the importation into Turkey of the produce or manu factures originating and emanating from the territories of the other contracting countries shall be those of the Turkish specific tariff which came into operation on the 1st September, 1916. Article 2. The duties prescribed by the Turkish tariff of the 1st September, 1916, in Turkish paper money, will be subjected to coefficients of increase periodically adjusted according to the rate of exchange under the conditions hereinafter provided. These coefficients shall be those which were in force on the 1st March, 1923. Nevertheless, the articles set out in the annexed Schedule 1 shall be subjected to the coefficient 9. The coefficients referred to above shall be adjusted in accordance with the rate of exchange as provided by the following rules: - These coefficients having been determined at a time when the pound sterling represented 745 paper piastres, if the Turkish pound shows an average increase of more than 30 per cent, over this rate during the month preceding the coming into force of this Con vention, the coefficients 12 and 9 will be reduced proportionately to the average rate of exchange for that month; the coefficient will remain in force, as thus adjusted, for the following three months; at the expiration of that period of three months, the coefficient will, should the case arise, be readjusted in accordance with the average rate of exchange of the last month of the period. In the same way, if the Turkish pound shows an average decrease of more than 30 per cent, compared with the initial rate of 745 piastres for a pound sterling during the month preceding the coming into force of this Convention, the coefficients 12 and 9 may be increased proportionately to the average rate of exchange lor that month ; the coefficient will remain in force, as thus adjusted, for the following three months; at the expiration of that period of three months, the coefficient will, should the case arise, be readjusted in accordance with the average rate of exchange of the last month of the period. The coefficient 5 may be increased, in the event of a decrease in value of the Turkish pound, in the same conditions as the coefficients 12 and 9, but, in the event of an increase in value of the lurkish pound, that coefficient need only be reduced from the time when the pound sterling is worth less than 5 Turkish pounds paper. In the event of monetary reform, the various coefficients fixed above will be modified to the extent of the difference between the new and the old currency in such a way as not to alter the incidence of customs duties.159 Article 3. Turkey undertakes to abolish from the coining into force of the present Convention, and not to re-establish during its continuance, all prohibitions of import and export, except those which may be necessary :— (1) to maintain the resources indispensable for the food of the people, and to safeguard the economic activity of the nation ; (2) to ensure the security of the State ; (3) to protect persons, animals and plants against contagious diseases, epizootics and epiphyties; (4) to prevent the use of opium and other poisons; (5) to prohibit the import of alcoholic products, the use of which is forbidden in Turkey ; (6) to prevent the export of gold money or gold metal; (7) to establish or support State monopolies.

Article o. Subject to an equitable reciprocity being accorded to Turkey by •each of the other Contracting Powers in accordance with its legisla-161 tion, every export duty, which Turkey may have imposed or may impose on any goods, natural or manufactured, shall be applied equally whatever the country of destination. No discrimination to the prejudice of the commerce of any one of the other Contracting Powers shall be established by any means. Article 6, Turkey will accord to the other Contracting Parties the benefit of any more favourable treatment in respect of the matters referred to in Articles 1 to 5 which she may grant to any other country, except such special advantages as regards tariffs or generally in regard to all other commercial matters which she may grant to any one of the territories detached from Turkey under the Treaty of Peace signed this day, or, as regards frontier trade, to a limitrophe State. Article 7. Tn order to determine the country of origin of imported goods, Turkey and any of the other Contracting Powers may respectively require the production by the importer of an official certificate stating that the article imported is the national produce or manufac ture of the said country, or that it should be so considered having regard to the transformation which it has undergone in that country.

Your Excellency, Lausanne, July 24, 1923. With reference to the declaration made in the Economic Committee regarding the payment of arrears of taxes, I have the honour to confirm that the Turkish Government, inspired by the same sentiment of humanity as the three inviting Powers, will take the necessary measures in order that Allied nationals, who suffered from the Smyrna fire, may be exempted from the payment of the arrears of the temettu tax due for the financial year 1922—23, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 69 (Economic Clauses).

M. le President, Lausanne, July -28. 1!&gt;28. At the last meeting of the Second Committee, it was agieed between us that Article 70 of the former draft treaty regarding certain financial operations carried out at Constantinople attei the 30th October, 1918, should be suppressed, and replaced bj a letter addressed by your Excellency to the Council of the Debt a letter the receipt of which the latter was to have acknowledged and with it was to have notified its agreement. We had also reached agree- [10868]•231 ment with your Excellency on the draft letter to be addressed to the Council, a copy of which you have communicated to us.* We regret to have to inform your Excellency that it appears from correspondence exchanged with the President of the Council of the Debt that the draft agreed upon here presents certain difficulties from the point of view of the Council. As there is not sufficient time to settle these difficulties before the signature of the Treaty, we propose to your Excellency that the question of the letters to be exchanged between the Government and the Council of the Debt should be left over for subsequent settlement. It should be clearly understood that in making this proposal we do not wish in any way to go back on the agreement to suppress Article 70 of the former draft Treaty, and that we adhere to the principles on which the draft letter which we had agreed upon was based, that is, that the validity of the operations in question will not be disputed, but that, on the other hand, they are not to be regarded as constituting a precedent in so far as concerns the currency in which payments are to be made.
