Political Department. It has come to my knowledge indirectly th&amp;t ! the Persian Government have been pressing at Teheran I f 01- the restoration of communication between Borasjoon . . urn u, fa ! ^ Bander Rig^ has been interrupted since August 1915. The Beputy Political Resident at Bushire has also been enquiring when the line will again be connected up. Both have been informed that the working season is | now P ast artf nothing can be done till the heat abates next autumn. 1 have ascertained that the line from Borasjoon^ to Bunder Rig has entirely disappeared; it was apparently removed at the German Wassmuss*s instigation. In those circumstances itivduld seem best to reconstruct the line by a route through a district where it will be less likely to be destroyed and by one capable of diversion should further occasion arise for so doing. With this in view / surveys have been made and feasible routes nave been found as shewn in the accompanying sketch map . The route shewn via Shif requires two short letigths of cable and I do not therefore propose to adopt it until that via Ahmedi has been proved to be untenable. As the Arabistan telegraph line f though not yet paid for ; is in a w r ay the property of the Persian Govern ment I am not sure whether it is advisable to divert a line nominally their property without their knowledge and consent and I therefore suggest that Sir Percy Cox's opinion might be ascertained during the interval thatelapse before work can be commenced. I am inclined to think that provided the Persians have secure communication they will not cavil at the route that may be adopted but Mr.King Wood, whom I have consulted, is doubtful as to the view they will take of what may have the appearance of arbitrary action and suggests that Sir P.Cox should be consulted’hence this note.

This work was carried out under the Agreement with the Persian Government, signed by the Persian inister of Posts and Telegraphs or 4th January, 1913, (Collection Pc.XXX page 32). The accounts show that the actual total cost amomitoc tcRs485,.545 (£25,690)while the estimated cost sanctioned in Council Minute dated 1st April, 1913,was Rs.3, 46,C00(£23,060) (P.W.82^13) .The expenditure has therefore exceeded the estimate by Rs^345.(£2,623). A comparative statement, ‘•narked A, is attached snoring the estimated and actual cost under the principal sub-heads, of expenditure. • It will be seenfrom this that the chief items in excess are;- . t . (a) Store Expenditure Bs (b) Bstabli sim'eht (c) Direction and Accounts (a) Store Expenditure, excess Rs. 20,900. - f thi s so ■ n Ps. 6,759 is the book value-of the stores issued to the work in excess of the estimate, of which about Rs. 5, n.&gt;c represents the 1 value of surplus stores which would in normal times have been returned to stock and their value credited to the work, but in consequence of the war they are lying on the. Ahwp — Boras icon section of the line whence they cannot at present be recovered and their cost has accordingly been dejbiteo to the work. ‘Should 1 they hereafter be recovered their value will be credited to the capital account of the Arabist'an Telegraph glnes and deducted from the amount .due from the Persian Government under the agreement. The' balance of the excess under this Heading, viz., Ps.12.141 is due ,to the change that has been made sinc-e the estimate was prepared in the percentage to be added for storekeeping charges, in order to assimilate the pr qnn 36,841. 9,93.6.ocedure in this Department ni th thet adoptee 5 in the Indian Post and Telegraph Department.

Then the estimate was prepared it was inferred that the salaries and allowances of the permanent estsblispiij.ent employed on the work would be recovered from the Persian Government by deduction in the monthly adjustment between the two administrations on account of receipts due to Persia collected by this Department for local traffic and of expenditure incurred by us on their behalf. After the work had commenced, however, the Persian Minister for Telegraphs declined to admit this procedure arid insisted that all salaries and allowances of the a t &lt; establishmen-t onployed on this work should be debited to its capital cost and this we have had perforce to do. (c) Direction and Account, excess Re. 9,916. This excess is due to the same assimilation in procedure as that explained above .in regard to the storekeeping charges. - Against the excess expenditure above mentioned, a saving of Rs.28,339 in the other items under cash expenditure has been effected,the main part being due toia saving of Rs. 23,563 in the cost of the carriage of the stores from the coast. \ It is submitted that the excess expenditure of Rs.39,345 (£2,623) may be sanctioned. Under Article 2 of the Agreement of the 4th January 1913 £5,000 is to be deducted from the total cost of the work and the balance is to constitute a debt due from the Persian to the British Government. I attach a bill, marked B, showing that the balance due from the Persian Government under the Article quoted is Rs.3,10,345 (£20,690) and, if approved, I submit that this bill may be sent in triplicate to the Foreigi Office to forward to the British Minister at Teheran for presentation to the Persian Government at a favourable mom ait. TheThe amount due from the Persian Government, £20,690, is under the terms of Article 2 to he diminished annually by the sum of £300 payable by the British Government for the maintenance of the line commencing from the date of the commencement of the work, 11th February 1914, and up to the 1st January, 1945. There will therefore be 31 annual payments of £300 on account of maintenance and by the 1st January 1945 the debt due from the Persian Government will have been diminished by 31 X £300 or £9,300, leaving a balance on that date still due from Persia of £11,390. A method for the recovery of this remains to be negotiated. The Treasury agreed to share, to the extent of £9,030, in the advance made to Persia of the balance of the actual cost of the work in excess of £5,000 (Pol.66/14 and 912/14) and on the 28th May 1915 paid £8,560 being a moiety of the cost of the work which had been completed to Shuster, leaving a section of line to Dizful, 36 miles, then incomplete. The advance made to Persia, as shown by attachment B, is £20,690, and since the Treasury agreed to share in this advance to the extent of £9,030 only, the balance £11,660 constitutes the share to be borne by the Indian Exchequer. The Treasury having already advanced £8,560 a Siam of £470, the balance of the £9,030 which they agreed to contribute towards the advance to Persia, is still due from them and may, I submit be now applied for. There is also due from the Treasury a sum of £150 being 8 moiety of the annuel payment of £300 for the maintenance of the line due to Persia for the year 1917-18. On our side there is due to the Treasury the sum of fbuO being the annual instalment for 1917-18 in pert repayment of the advance thev made in 1915-16.

With reference to my note No.I,E.374 dated 30th April, 19X5 (P.-Y.1432/15) I have now received from the Deputy Accountant General, Posts and Telegraphs, India, the final accounts of the cost of the Reconstruction of the Arabistan telegraph lines. ri his work ms carried out under the Agreement with the Persian Government, signed by the Persian Minister of Posts and Telegraphs on 4th January, 1913, (Collection No.XXX, page 32). The accounts show that the actual total cost amounted to Rs.3,85,345 (£25,690) while the estiated cost sanctioned in Council Minute dated 1st April,. 1913, was Rs.3,46,000 (£23,060) (P.W.828/13). The expenditure has therefore exceeded the estimate by Rs.39,345 (£2,623). A comparative statement, marked A, is attached showing the estimated and actual cost under the principal sub-heads of expenditure. It will be seen from this that the chief items in excess are:- (a) Store Expenditure Rs.20,9 )0 t &lt; /. ' ‘ f 'J'' (b) Establishment M 36,84J. (c) Direction and Accounts H 9,916\ (a) Store Expenditure, excess Rs.20,900. Of this sum Rs.8,759 is the book value of the stores issued to the work in excess of the estimate, of which about Rs.5,000 represents the value of surplus stores which would in nonrkil times have been returned to stock and their value credited to the work, but in coneequence of the war they are lying on the Ahwaz-Borasjoon section of the line whence they cannot. at present be recovered and their cost has accordingly been debited to the work. Should they hereafter be recovered their value will be credited to the capital account of the Arabistan Telegraph lines deducted fror V . thef 'the amount due from the Persian Bovurm sent uir • &lt; r t K ^ agreement. The balance of the excess under this hearing, viz.

There will therefore be 31 annual payments of £300 on account of maintenance and by the 1st January 1945 the debt due from the Persian Government will have been diminished by 31 X £300 or £9,300, leaving a balance on that date still due from Persia of £11,390, A method for the recovery of this remains to be negotiated. The Treasury agreed to share, to the extent of £9,030, in the advance made to Persia of the balance of the actual ' o vt of the work in excess of £5,000 (Pol,6*'/14 and 912/14) and on the 28th May, 1915, paid £8,560 being a moiety of the cost of the work which had been completed to Shuster, leaving a / section of line to Dizful, 36 miles, then incomplete. The advance made to Persia, as shown by attachment B, is £20,090, and since the treasury agreed to share in this advance to the extent of £9,030 only, the balance £11,660 constitutes the share to be borne by the Indian Exchequer.

I m to add that a sum exceed- that sums of £2500 andf 150, being respectively one half the amount Indian, exchequers jointly, and half the amount similarly to be contrib- tenance of the line, are now due to this Office, and I am to request that payment may be made according ly.

I am to enquire whether the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs concurs in the foregoing proposals, the effect of which is estimated to he as shown in the accompanying statement. It is not probable that this Office vHll he in a, position to ash for payment hy your Department of a portion of the advance to Persia at an earlier date than 1915. It will he observed that the proposal is made that, in the event of the total expenditure exceeding £33,060^ the excess shall he ( h ome— 1— tN Approved Pol.

(2) In the event of actual total expenditure being less than £23,060 the above figures will need revision. “TV | 1 MAY 1914The payments to be made by the Foreign Office to the India Office are:- (a) £2500 being half the sum to be contributed towards the total cost of the work by the British and Indian Exche que r s j ointly. (b) £150 per annum being half the suit to be contributed towacds the cost of the maintenance of the lines by the Britiei and Indian Exchequers jointly, commencing with the year 1915 and ending with the year 1944. (c) £9030, approximately, being half the amount of a loan to Persia to complete the work after £5000 or twice (a) has been expended to be contributed in equal shares by the British and Indian Exchequers. The exact amoujit of this loan will not be known until the accounts have been compiled, i.e., in about two years’ time, the work of reconstruction having only recently been commenced^ the interval since the agreement with Persia was signed has been occupied in providing the material for the work. It follows that the payments of (a) and one instalment of (b) for the year 1913 are now due but the payment of (c) can be deferred till some time in 1916, the Indian Exchequer meanwhile providing the funds for carrying out the work. The payments to be made by the India Office to the Foreign Office are:- (d) £501.13.4, approximately, commencing with a payment in January 1917 and ending with a payment in January 1934. N.B. As (b) is due annually in January by the Foreign Office it will probably be found convenient to pay (d) to the Foreign Office on the same date. As the exact amount of the loan to Persia is at present unknown, the sum of £18,060 being only an estimate^ submit that- it will probably be found more convenient to make the J first&lt;© first instalment payable by the India Office to the 19000 x-23000 Foreign Office*C 18 + 2 where the total cost £ of the work, and to make the other seventeen instalments f 9000 ^ x-500 „ 18 “£300 each instead of making each instalment ' 2 as proposed by the Treasury. It is very unlikely that x- 500 0 2 will prove to be a sum of which one eighteenth part will equal &lt;£801.13.4 and it will most likely prove to be a sum which is indivisible by eighteen i.e.a sum which-if divided by eighteen would introduce a more or less complex fraction of a penny. If (a) and an instalment of (b) are paid by the Foreign Office at once, the next further payment will be one of £150 in January 1915 to be followed by a third instalment of the same amount in January 1916. Then comes the payment x~ 50 00 of 2 by the Foreign Office some time in 1916. In January 1917,. if the suggestion I have made be adopted and on the same date the Foreign Office will pay the India Office the fourth instalment of (b) making a net payment by In January 1918 and on to January 1934 the India Office will pay the Foreign Office a net sum annually of £350 and from January 1935/the loan by the British Exchequer having by then been redeemed, to January 1945 the Foreign Office will pay the India Office £150 annually. A tabular statement is attached showing the sum due by the Foreign Office to the India Office and vice versa for each year from 1914 to 1945. The receipts and payments of these sums will, I presume, be adjusted by the Accountant General’s Office and transferred to the Accountant General,?ost Office &amp; Telegraphs, Calcutta^ for credit or debit to the Indo-European Telegraph Department.

Under the terms of para.. 342 of the Report of the Welby Commission and of the letter from the Treasury to the Foreign Office of 31st October 1906 (Pol. 3827a/06)they would have had f| justification - had they chosen to take this extreme step - for refusingt 0 accept any liability beyond what they had undertaken in 1908, and this without im.pa i ring the half and half principle. It is therefore matter for congratulation that they have accepted our proposals in full except to the extent that they stipulate for repayment by us by fixed instalments of the amount they propose to advance. In the circumstances we can raise no objection toA# regardpprocedure, it would be appropriate nd rave complication , f +hink, if the payments* by and to the Foreign Office could be kept apart from the annual adjustments* in respect of diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia. .The payments by the Foreign Office could be credited direct to the Indo-European Telegraph Departand those to the Foreign Office debited to that Department.

Treasury to Foreign Office.—(Received December 22.) r-rATTT-, n . , Treasury Chambers, December 20, 1913. 1 MA.VE laid before the^ Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury Sir Eyre Crowe’s letter of the 5th ultimo transmitting copy of a letter from the India Office dated the 22nd October last with enclosure, together with copy of an agreement dated the 4th Januaiv, 191o, with the Persian Covernment relative to the proposed reconstruction of telegiaph lines m Arabistan, and, in reply, I am to request you to lay before Secretary Sir E. Grey the following observations:— My Loids note that the proposal to construct this line is an amplification of the scheme sanctioned by them in 1908, and it would appear from the terms of the India Office lettei that, fiom their Lordships acquiescence on that occasion in the imposition of a charge on tne Exchequer, it has been inferred that this Board will be prepared to undertake further liabilities in connection with the Arabistan lines. do this view my Lords feel bound to demur most strongly, and I am to express then smprise that the agreement of January last should have been entered into with Persia without any consultation with this Board, who are now requested to provide for a considerable expenditure, as to the mcurment of which they have not any voice or even any opportunity of criticism. An examination of the articles of the agreement and of Mr. Barker’s memorandum, forwarded with the letter under reply, has led their Lordships to the conclusion that India is more directly concerned than this country in the matter. No doubt the favourable terms accorded to Persia in connection with the Arabistan line were used as an inducement to them to extend the period of the agreements referred to in article o, which for the most part affect India particularly, and my Lords conceive that the construction of the Arabistan lines will also indirectly add to the revenues of other lines owned or controlled by the Indian Government. lor these reasons my Lords, who view with the gravest concern, which they feel sure Sir E. Grey shares, the heav}' and growing demands on the Exchequer for expen diture in connection with Persia, would have felt justified in declining to accept any further liability than they have already accepted in respect of the Arabistan lines, or at the least in limiting the British contribution to a smaller amount than a moiety of the anticipated expenditure. My Lords, however, feel hesitation in adopting this latter course, inasmuch as it would involve the abandonment of what is known as the half- and-half principle for expenditure, which falls to be borne by this country and India. In view too of Sir E. Grey’s emphatic representations as to the political importance attaching to the extension of British influence in Arabistan, their Lordships feel constrained to waive their objection to accepting further charges in respect of telegraph lines in that country, and to accept, subject to the stipulation explained below, the proposals of the Government of India to share with them equally the cost of con structing the Arabistan lines. I he expenditure involved, my Lords note, is on capital account 23,090/., with a recurring charge for a period of thirty-two years of 300/. Of the capital expenditure 5,000/. is to be granted as a free gift to Persia, and my Lords agree that a moiety of this sum and tbe recurrent charge may be defrayed from the Exchequer. As regards the remaining sum of 18,060/. on capital account, which it is proposed to treat as an advance to Persia, to be in due course repaid by that country, I am to say that, having regard to their Lordships’ general financial procedure in the matter of grants of this character, and to tbe complexity and uncertainty of the means suggested for repayment, their Lordships can only assent to advancing the money on the condition that the following scheme be adopted. Any advances made in this connection for the assistance of Persia are to be treated as a loan to the Government of India in respect of their Indo-European Telegraph Department, the Indian Government on their part undertaking to repay the loan by the repayment to the British Exchequer of a fixed sum of 501/. 13s. 4cZ. for a period of eighteen years. If this be agreed to my Lords wall waive any claim to interest on the outstanding portions of the loan. [1967 t/—1]The adoption of this simple system, which my Lords earnestly trust will be accepted, wilf enable this Board to make arrangements in ^Z^tmpncS financial procedure, and will relieve the Government of India from complicated adjustments and allocations of receipts whic ma y . , secure tlie British Government in respect of other lines of telegraph it will also secure me ^ntisn Exchequer against ultimate loss, as the repayment of the loan will m no way depend on the actaal payments received from Persia by India.

Hitherto, however, all instruments extending the length of the telegraph concessions have been ratified, and it would therefore appear not unlikely that if the article dealing w r ith the exteusion of the three former conventions is not brought now to the knowledge of that Assembly trouble may arise at any time when the question of a further extension comes under discussion.

IN [1829 dd — 4] / VjX 0 19 SEP ‘S' i \ ■ : --- ■MH Note on Foreign Office letter No.38920 dated 1st September 1913. The telegraphic instructions which were sent to me on the 23th January 1909 when I was Director at Teheran, as a basis for negotiating for the renewal of departmental concessions till 1945 and for obtaining the control of the Arabistan lines were as follows ' When offer (of) transfer (of control) (is) made (to you) combine in after (i.e.,subsequent) negotiations (the) question (of) transfer with (the) question (of) renewal (of) all three telegraph concessions utj to 1945. For renewal of concessions offer (to) spend £6000 (for) permanent construction, £600 (for) annual maintenance of Arabistan telegraph lines (on condition that they are) to be under our gontrol up to 1945 free of cost to Persian Government. If more (i.e.,further) inducement requisite offer (to) advance Persian Minister of Telegraphs for purposes (of) Persian Telegraph Administration^ sub f j ect to sanction of Persian Government^ (an) amount up to a limit of £10,000 in anticipation of yearly payment of £1000 (being) ten years' rental (of the) Central Persia line. In negotiations open with (an) offer below top limit and increase as advisable.' This indicates how it was then intended to recover a loan should it be found necessary to make one. I find that on the 1st February 1909 I telegraphed as follows from Teheran : ' As £6000 and £600 or less will not be sufficient2 V 'sufficient for permanent construction and annual 'maintenance, should the Persian Minister of Telegraphs 'accept the offer, please explain how you propose, 'without offering a loan, difference will he raised.' The reply I received was:- 'A1though amount may not he sufficient for total 'construction and maintenance it would go a long way. 'Any assistance could he promised on fair terms for 'balance required that inspection of line g hows 'necessary.' Negotiations were accordingly opened without the offer of a loan and as the Persian Government accepted terms less than the 'top limit' minus the proposed loan^the offer of a loan was not made^though it is obvious from the terms of the agreement that the Persian Government understood that they would .receive a loan,in the form of material to he paid for by us in the first instance as well as a contribution. It will he as well here to explain the nature of the security we have for the repayment of a loan should We require to resort to that method of recovery. When the first of th V, the ei amour r of the Convention of 1901 which reads 'The Persian Government agrees to lease the use and ^ 'transit revenue of the line, which is its property, 'when complete td&gt; the Indo-European Telegraph Department 'at a rental of 4 per cent on the capital expended on its 'construction, including cost of material-three quarters 'of such rental to he retained by the British Government 'to recoup them for the advances made, and one quarter, subj ectsubject to a minimum of 25,000 francs, to be paid annually to the ft Persian Government in two half-yearly instalments. It is under stood that / should the Persian Government’s quarter share of the (V rental exceed 25,000 francs, such excess shall belong to the Persian Treasury.' ^ Since the negotiations of 1909 the accounts for the Central Persia line have been made up and the bill completed and presented.The rental works out at 31,250 francs (£1250) approximately. £1^060 is, therefore, • about 14-J* years’ rental of the Central Persia line. The bill has not yet been accepted by the Persian Government though payments at the minimum rate, amounting to about £4500 out of £7500 due up to 1st-July last have been made to them,but,whenever it may be considered desirable to do so, it is open to us to withhold further payments and to use them to reduce the debt due to us by the Persian Government for the expenses we are about to incur on the Arabistan telegraph lines. Since I last had the opportunity of writing a memorandum on this subject, I have been in correspondence with Mr .KingWood / the Director at Teheran and he has now informed me that the Persian Tele graph Minister has agreed to our utilizing our annual contribution of £300 in part redemption of the debt, and that the Persian Telegraph Administration will find the whole of the funds requisite for the proper maintenance of the Arabistan lines including establishment. I It will naturally be asked what security we have that the Persian Government will carry out their share of this supplementary bargain. The answer is that the Department collects a part of the charges for local telegrams from the public on behalf of the Persian Telegraph Administration, wft a \■ \meT=*t*ssgtada&amp; and pays them in monthly, less any sums due to the Department by the Persian Telegraph Administration; we also collect a part of the charges for international telegrams originating or terminating in Persia^' the account for these is adjusted annually. The maintenance charges of the Arabistan lines will be included in these adjustments of accounts. As regardssfrlri 4 As regards opening negotiations for the recovery of the ^balance of the estimated advance/viz., £18,060 - £300X until the works have been completed and the actual balance due to us is known. We are at present negotiating for the the successful issue of these negotiations might be endangered by driving too onerous a bargain over the Arab- istan lines which will after all cost us less than we were originally prepared to spend on them. and I would only suggest that it may be advisable to exer cise a little patience before making a demand for it.

[35047] No. 1. Foreign Office to Treasury. Indo-European lelegraph Department on the financial aspect of the question of the reconstruction of telegraph lines in Arabistan.* It will be within their Lordships’ recollection that they agreed, in their letter of the 13th August, 1908, to pay an initial sum of 650L and a recurrent sum of 300Z. for 32 years The Secretary of State for India now expresses the hope that they will see their way to accept liability for 2,5001. initial and 150/.. recurrent expenditure for 32 years and in addition that temporary assistance will be rendered to the Telegraph Department to provide the sum of 23,060/. on behalf of the Persian Government. I am to state that, in Sir E.

Sir, In continuation of my letter of the 5th March 1913, No. P. 667 as to the reconstruction of the Arab is tan telegraph lines, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to enclose, to be laid before the Secretary of State fo r ^o re ign Affa i rs, copy of reports by the Director- in-Chief, I.fl.Tel. Dept, on the financial aspect of the question. I am to explain that the sum mentioned in the earlier report, viz. c£23,060 B represents the total initial expenditure which the I.E.Dept. has in fact to provide in behalf of the Persian Cavern- ment, but that the Secretary of State in Council does not of course propose to ask the Leras Commissioners of the Treasury to undertake final responsibility^ in respect of the cost of recon struction and maintenance J for any charges beyond a moiety of those now accepted by the I.E.Tel. Dept, viz. *£5,000 initial and *£300 per annum recurring during the period for which the Arabistan lines remain under British control, i .e to the 1st January 1945. He trusts however that in the c ire urns tances __c i rc ims tances their Lo rds n ips will be willing to assist the I.fi. Dept, in meeting the immediate demand for &lt;£23,060 pending recovery from the Persian Government, and I am to suggest that one half of all expenditure on this account should be refunded to this Ojfice, one half of all suns received by the Department from the Persian Government being credited to the Foreign Office. pap' jv •mm rci* JM&amp; M M&amp;RWT 24 JUL)S13 approved council 6 i/i.NOTE BY A SSISTANT FINANCIAL SECffitTMY. I would venture to suggest a somewhat different treatment. The position, as I understand it, is as fallows (l) Arra ng ement of 1908 . The Indo-European Telegraph Department undertook an initial expenditure of &lt;£1300 in restoring the line, and a recurring expenditure of £600 a year on its maintenance, and of both these the Treasury agreed to bear half. If for sake of comparison with the present arrangement a period of 32 years be taken the total cost would work out at tf £1300 + (32 X £600) - £20,500 of which the Treasury were to bear £650 initial + £300 a year, or £10,250 in all. (2) Prese n t arrangement . The estimated initial outlay, to be met by the Indo European Telegraph Department in the first instance, is £23,060 +£1,600 ^£24,660. The recurring outlay, I am informed by Mr. Barker, may be takenat &lt;£600 a year, of which the portion above £300 will probably be recovered without delay by his Department from the Persian Government through a separate running account with that Government. Of the total expenditure the Indo European Department has accepted liability for only £5000 initial and £300 a year recurring for 32 years = £5000+9.600 =* £14,600. In this situation it seems to me to be impossible at present to call upon the Treasury to accept final liability for more than one-half of the reduced final liability assumed by the Indo European Telegraph / Department. At the same time I would suggest that the « * whole situation be placed before them and that they be asked to help the Department to meet the immediate demands upon it pending recovery of the sums chargeable to the Persian Government. . If they agree the most convenient procedure would presumably be that the Foreign Office should repay to this Office one half of all expenditure on the service in question incurred by the Department, and be credited by this °ffic e/// 7/^ • Office with one half of all sums received by the Department from the Persian Government. Of course the possibility that Persia may not fulfil her promises has to be borne in mind, but it is perhaps unnecessary to make specific arrangements with the Treasury to cover that contingency.4 Reference Paper.

When the Treasury in their letter of the 13th August 1908 (flagged) agreed in principle to the contribution of a moiety of the cost of the control xS V&lt; of the Arabist an telegraph lines the figures they had before them were those given in Sir Henry Kirk's note of the 7th February 1908 (flagged ). The use of iron standards which we have since engaged ourselves to use was not then contemplated and it uxis intended to rebuild the line to its original specif icat ion, that' is, with wooden poles procured locally, light insulators and the old wire. Since then a period of five years has elapsed during which the project has more tha.n once been reconsidered and, it was eventually taken up in conjunct ion with the renewal of the departmental concessions in Persia, this ultimately resulted in the agreement with the Persian Government signed on the 6th January last P.371/13 below. The Treasury sanctioned an initial expenditure of £650 and a recurrent expenditure of £300 a year for so long as the A rabistan lines are under British control, we have agreed to undertake this obligetion up to Jonua ry 1st 1945, a period of 32 years but we are now committed to a much larger initial expenditure than was then contemplated while our recurrent expenditure is nominally limited to £300 instead of £600 a year as originally contemplated. ^The question for consideration now is whether the Treasury shall be asked for their original contribution or for a- jnodified contribution more in a.ccorda.nce with the terms of the final agreement . In practice we have now to find on initial expenditure of £23,060 plus the cost of the permanent establishment employed on the reconstruction, estimated at £1600, anal we shall also have to find the cost of maintenance annually in the first instance * We have agreed to contribute £5000 and £300 a year for 32 years towc.rds the initial and recurrent expenses respectively, anything in excess of this contribution being a debit to the Persian Government. How this excess is to be recovered has been left for future negotiation.No. 1494, dated Bushire, the nth (received 19th) May 1913.

An arrangement has been made with Minister of Posts and Telegraphs with approval of Cabinet.

It takes £xa* form of a letter to Tehran Director of the Indo-European Telegraph Department and appears ^uite satisfactory. It is to be hoped that necessary authority to start work at once will be issued to Mr. King Wood who deserves great praise for tact and determination with which he has carried out somewhat dif- ficult negotiations. As the original agreement was signed by my predecessor I propose putting present arrangement on record at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs by sending Minister for Foreign Affairs copy of document communicated to me by Mr.Ming Wood.

DATED 29th JANUARY 1913. I am now in receipt of the modified agreement arranged by the Persian Linister of Posts and Telegraphs and the Director of the Persian Section of this Department referred to in my note of the 9th instant. I attach four copies of this agreement. The agreement of 1909 has been copied in the left hand margin for facility of I comparison, The new first Article contains in a new form the old first article together with a portion of the old second and the whole of the old seventh article. The new second article when read in conjunction with new Articles I? and V, the Director points out, saves to us the cost of an Inspector, whose pay, under Article II of the old agreement, we had to find. The effect of the new agreement is that we have in the first instance toto advance the money for the reconstruction of the line now and for its maintenance annually hereafter and that Persia will repay to us such outlay, less a total sum of £14,600, by annual instalments between now and 1945. As is stated in the letter from the Linister of A Jjk ■ Posts and Telegraphs to the Director which accompanied the agreement, a translation of which is put up, Article III is to be excluded when referring the other articleB to the Lajlis for their approval. This Article and the next, Article IV# are the same as the old articles clothed partly in new words. The new Article V gives the Persian Government a voice in fixing the emoluments of the British officer selected to control the line. Th£ they did not have under the old agreement, but in as much as they have relieved us of the expense it is only fair that they should have such a voice even if it lias the effect of limiting our choice of an officer in order to keep within the rate eventually to be stipulated. Should any difficulty arise it can be surmounted in a similar manner to that sanctioned in Council Linuto dated 21st January 1897, whereby in the event of a senior oixicer being in charge of the Meshed line the diiierence between the pay he is actually drawing and Rs.350 per mensem isI charged to doixuri^^ontal account. iiTticle ¥1 of the now convention is a now article* tlio Director write© that a school for training /iTaenian clorko for tlie oorvico of tiie Persian Telo^aph Amini strati on lias boon opened by ir.bow, v4iose oorvices Imve been lent to that adiuin i strat i on * md tliat these clerks are capable of undertaldn^s the duties whicli the British toieepraphiets would inve undertaken under the old t\proeuont. So lon-j therefore ao the torus of tlie article are adhered to tJiere in no prosont necessity for stationing British telegraphists on the hrabintan lines and the abrogation ofathe old .article VI :.:ay be accepted so far as m are concerned# * The new .Wticie /II replaoee the old riiole IX. I kivo asoertainod by beiujraph tliat the tersae of toe new convention have boon coewunicated wo the Btsaion . inister at Tchoran by the British .inioter but I have not been informed wiioUmr tlae foner has expressed approval of thanI mention this because in the political papers sent me for perusal I notice the Russian Government received an See enclosures x,, , ^ . Sir A. assurance that we should tt not put obstacles in the way sol son’s plated 8 2bth if in time ^ should appeax necessary to the Russian f 1909 and i June^1909* Government to despatch their om tele^aph officials to the lines mentioned for the transmission of telegrams in the Russian language on principles analogous with those which have been established in relation to the Khaf- Seistan line'. 'It was further agreed that the Russian signallers should be attached to the Indo-European Telegraph Department and considered as employes of that Department.' The new agreement appears to me to nullify such agreement as before v/e can now station a telegraphist in an office on these lines we have first to obtain the consent of the Persian Government and such consent may be refused. Article VIII of the new agreement replaces Article X of the old, it appears to curtail somewhat the rights accordedaccorded by the latter, but as the most important extension we may require is a connection with the Turkish lines across the Shatt-el-Arab the Persian Government could hardly help applying to us for assistance in laying a cable. Another possible extension is from Dizful to Khorremabad, this would probably be required in connection with the projected railway over that route. Any negotiations for such a railway might be made to contain a clause giving us the right of constructing a telegraph line along it up to the point where the railway enters the limit of the Russian sphere as defined in the Anglo- Russian Convention. The new Article IX is a new clause, it is a clause which opens a road to friction but agreement to it could hardly have been avoided if pressed on us by the Persian Government. Article X of the new Convention ties us more or less to the old route, a shorter route ior the main line with branches to one or two of the offices would perhaps have been preferable, we can however have no option but to acceptI accept the clause* The line belonging to the Persians \ they would consider they have the best right to Choose the route* The Director at Teheran explains by telegraph that Article VIII of the old agreement was omitted in the new because the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs considers that the necessity for a second wire is a question of the future which can be raised when it is actually required* Under the old arrangement we could have put up the wire without paying a royalty for it* Under the new arrange*- ment a royalty will, if we ever ask for the wire, no doubt be demanded and will be difficult to resist* On the whole I think that although we have agreed to the surrender of some of the rights we enjoyed under the old agreement we have obtained a substantial set off by shifting the onus of the payment of the Inspector to \ Persian shoulders, the Director estimates the saving thereby affected to amount to about £14,000 distributed over 32 years*I submit that I may be given authority to convey ! K to ...r.King-Viood an appreciation of his services in connection with these negotiations, I further submit that I may be given authority to commence operations, I have already ascertained by telegraph that the Indian Telegraph Department is unable to assist us with the supply ox a particular class of telegraph posts which, had a stock been available, would have answered our purpose. The posts will therefore have to be obtained in England and as it is now too late to supply material for use before the summer heats commence, an order for it can be placed during the current financial year and delivery arranged for in the early part Oi the next financial year, in the budget estimate ior which funds !o meet a part of its cost have already been provided, I also apply for authority to appoint, after coming to an arrangement with the Persian Minister of Posts andTelegraphs as to his pay and allowances, an Inspector to proceed at once to repair and restore communication on the existing line.

Foreign Office, December 7, 1912, 4*10 p.m. YOU shouldfmake every endeavour to obtain permission for the Indo-European Telegraph (lempany to put the Arabistan telegraph lines in order at once, without waiting any longer for sanction of Medjliss, which is non-existent. It ought to be possible to arrange for the immediate execution of the convention ; but if difficulties are raised, permission could be given provisionally by the executive and subject to the subsequent sanction of the Medjliss when summoned.HESSCONFIDENTIAL. ■i ■BMi Sir Edward Grey to Sir W. Townley {Tehran). (No. 403.) R. Foreign Office, July 3, 1912, 1 20 YOUR telegram No. 390 of 1st July : Telegraphs. I concur. (Repeated to St Petersburgh, No. 533.)Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 2, 8 a.m.) (No. 390.) YOUR telegram No. 384 Tehran, July 1, 1912, 9 , 30 p.m. : Exchange telegraphs. Unless the question is considered of urgent importance, I would suggest that it be postponed for a time. Present weak Government has its hands full of difficult questions without the addition of another that has raised opposition, even if same was unjustifiable, in the past. Moreover, director of the [? Government of India] telegraphs is negotiating definite conclusion of arrangement made respecting the extension of concessions and taking over of the Arabistan line. To raise exchange question anew might hamper his negotiations. (Sent to St. Petersburgh.) &gt;707-161mm 1 1/ v ■ From Viceroy, 2bth June 1912. Foreign Secret. Your telegram of 5th June. Wireless for Sheikh of - o imnnieruli After consulting Cox and Admiral we consider proposal objectionable lor following reasons :— r ^ ox doubts seriousness of Sheikh’s intention to meet the cost. •) lo allow erection of private wireless installation Chief in his territories would create awkward precedent. (').) {establishment of wireless at Mohammerah would doubtless attract attention of Persian Government at time when we are endeavouring to establish wireless scheme in Gulf unostentatiously without question. (4.) Proposed scheme may complicate question of Arabistan telegraph (vide Barclay’s letter dated 17th June 1909). — ~ (b.) Radio stations at Mohammerah, Ahwaz, and opposite to Fao would read messages from Bushire and Koweit, and in hostile hands could seriously interfere with working of these stations. We should, therefore, prefer that proposals should be held in abeyance lor the present, and if eventually sanctioned should be worked by Govern ment, the (Oil Company being allowed, perhaps, private connection between their oil held and concession at Abadan.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000dc_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/325</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000dc</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/325</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 80/1913 Pt 1 'Arabistan: telegraph line'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1912/1919</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-01-20T18:26:33</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (192 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.
