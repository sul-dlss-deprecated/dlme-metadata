Bahrain Island, Persian ^ulf March , Ivok, Major Prank Holmes, Bahrain Dear Sir v - We have received letter no.3i&gt;2 from the Political Agency, Bahrain, forwarded by you regarding a certain xmma amount which has been decreed against Muhammad bin Yahya, an employee of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, Ltd. The letter requests that we arrange to recover the above amount at Ro.8/- per month from this individual. While we are willing to assist the Agency Court in Jn the collection of this money, or any other monies owed by our employees, I think, you will agree it is not G ood policy for us to become involved in such matters. We will pay Muhammad bin Yahya his full wages each pay day but instruct him to pay to the Agency Court the amount stipulated above. If he fails in any payment, upon information to this effect from the Agency, we will be glad to bring the necessary pressure to wear. I would much prefer handling all such cases in this manner if it is agreeaole to you.

Holmes that all summons to Court served on Company* s employees should he submitted to their Office at least 3 days before appearance in Court is required, may be adhered to. As you will see from the letter, the present method of receiving the summons is unsatisfactory and a Source of inconvenience to the Company, the employees concerned and the Court in question. I shall be much obliged if you will approach the 'Bahrein Government in the matter in so far as the request relates to summons issued by their Courts. Thanking you.

To The Adviser, Bahrain Government, BAHRAIN. MEMORANDUM. I enclose a copy of a letter which has been sent to me by the Bahrain ietroleum Gca^any,through the inter mediary of Mr•Hussell,regarding the service of summons on their employees. In this connection will you please see my endorsement Ho: 1319 dated the 29th Ilovember 1931 which forwarded a copy of my letter No: 1318 of the same date to the Chief Local Representative of this Company. iTie request of the Company is quite reasonable and,as far as the Agency courts are concerned,instructions have been given that the notice they require should be invariably given. I do not believe that any inconvenience would be caused to the Bahrain Court by adhering to this principle and if you have no objection I would suggest that its adoption n^ty be suggested to them. In India the employees of railway Companies are invariably given a week’s notice of a hearing of a case in which their presence is required.

Dear Captain Cole: por some reason or another, the attached summonses or orders of arrest, whichever they may he, were sent out to us today altho, according U to my translation, they are not in any way addressed to The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited. We have done our best to locate these men today and advise them to be in court on Tuesday and y/ednesday mornings, as requested. /*' Wt Arrest Saleh bin M 0 hammed Dookhi ,Natoor,and present him before / the Small Joint Court on Tuesday morning, 21st May 1955 , re: case of Bhojanmal Matoomal. 3. Aziz bin Morad Irani should attend small joint court on tu morning, 21st May 1935, re: case of Abdulla Rashid Zayani. 4. Mohammed Abdullah Darazi working at No. 1 (Natoor) should case of Mubarak bin saad. 5. Aziz bin Murad Irani should attend small joint court on 7/ednesday morning, 22nd May 1935, re: case of Abdul bin Rashid zayani. No. 1 and the second man on No.2 are sick in Manama so we have been, of course, unable to notify them. The first under No.2 is a name unknown to any one out here and not appearing on our roster. Nos. 3 and 5 are the same man. He is working at new camp and we are endeavoring to locate him and tell him to be in court on Wednesday. No. 4 has been informed and will be in court on Tuesday. Tomorrow is our day off so we will be unable to check on these any further and we will be unable to collect them and take them to the court on Tuesday. Following is the list as we have it translated: 2. l.Mohammed Shami working at No. 1 )Both witnesses of 2.Salman bin Ali No.7 )Saleh bin Mohamed )Saleh bin Mohamed Dookhi should attend the above court at the above date. attend small joint court on Tuesday, 21st May 1955 , re:In this connection, I would like to urgently request that we be given more time to locate men before they are required to be in court. The names as sent out frequently differ from those which appear on our roster and as a consequence it takes us some time to run down the men wanted. One instance of this which I think should be called to your atten tion is that of one Abdullah bin Hamid Peshouri, who was cited to appear in court on April 28 altho we did not receive the summons until the evening of April 27, We were unable to locate him in time and, there fore, thru no fault of his he did not appear in Abdullah Haij’s court at the time requested. When he did appear on May 4th in response to a second summons he states that he was fined Rs 10/- for not being there the first time. Since he was in no way responsible for his failure to show up the first time, I am of the opinion that the fine should be remitted if it was, in reality, levied because of his absence.
