Apart from the question of the possible infringement of the monopoly of the imperial Bank of i eraia, y Lords find it difficult to understand the suggestion that They should furnish the Jussi an iinister of Finance with credits in rersia to the amount of £4,GQU,OCX). in view of the suras of money which have been previously in question in this connection. They f^el that the proposal is hardly to be taken seriously. On the occasion of i onsieur park’s visit to London last July the question of The Under weeretary of Btate, providing Foreitn Office.0 providing credits for 1 us si an expenses in iersia was fully discussed between representatives of the Treasury and of the lussian Government and also between the Treasury, the Foreign office and the imperial bank of iersia* As a consequence of these negotiations, * y Lords agreed on the 4th August last to total credits amounting to £120,000* The last instalment of tliis ^aount has been drawn by the Lussisn government but recently, the sum of £120,000 having lasted for a period of nearly six months. During the intervening period, the balance of lumim requirements in iersia has presumably been found through the ordinary channels of exchange; and y Lords do not understand, particularly in view of dir 0. karlin^s telegram bo. 70 of the 19th instant, why this state of affairs should not continue. in any case, the purchase of silver to the value of £4,000,000 probably could not be effected, mid, if effected, mi^ht be expected to cause a most grave disturbance in the currency system of India as well to derange the currency arrangements of many other parts of the world. or these reasons, therefore, &lt; y Lords agree that bir George Buchanan should be informed tiiat the proposals of the Jussian minister of Finance cannot be entertained and tnat it is undesirable that any negotia tions on these lines should be proceeded with. 1 E/i, , y Lord, , .

With reference to your letter of the 21st ultimo, relative to the provision of currency for the use of the Russian troops in Persia, I am directed hy Viscount Grey of Fallodon to state that this question has recently been discussed hy the Lords Conmissioners of His Majesty's Treasury with the Russian Minister of Finance. As your Directors are aware, the Russian Authorities have hitherto financed their troops hy the sale of rouble hills hut owing to the numerous prohibitions on export from Russia into Persia and the consequent restriction of normal trade, the available supply of such bills has proved inadequate and the price of the hran in terms of roubles has risen to an unprecedented level. The Russian Government estimate the require- l,oS)?6oo ments of their troops at One million tomans per month for each of the next six months, and they have requested the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury to arrange for credit up to this amount to be opened at the Imperial Bank of Persia in favour of the Russian military detachment in Persia. They propose that the Imperial Bank of Persia should be reimbursed by The Chairman, Imperial Bank of Persia, 25, Abchurch Lane, E • C .toy His Majesty’s Treasury in London, Russian Government Treasury Bills to an appropriate amount toeing deposited to tlie order of the Treasury for this purpose. The atoove proposal has, as you are aware, toeen the subject of semi-official discussion between the Treasury and the Financial Agent of the Russian Govern ment in London and of a conversation at this Department with representatives of your Bank. As a result of these discussions it would appear that the existing restrictions on trade and the diffi culties Which the Imperial Bank of Persia have experienced in the past in obtaining remittances of silver through Russia would make it impossible for your Bank to provide the whole sum required toy the Russian Government. Nor does it appear essential that you should do so. While, indeed, it may toe difficult or impossible for the Russian Government to finance the whole of their requirements toy the sale of rouble bills, it does not follow that they could not finance a substantial proportion in this manner and it is hoped that^as a result of the semi-official conversa tions which have taken place with the representative of the Russian Government in the matter that this sale j of rouble bills may still further be facilitated by the increase of trade intercourse between Russia and Persia and possibly by the removal of the prohibition on the export of petroleum to Persia. Lord Grey understands on the other hand that your Bank are prepared, subject to suitable arrange ments, to furnish the Russian Government with the equivalent in krans of Forty thousand pounds per £40 month during each of the three months August, September and October, and he is informed that theKussian Authorities will not he dissatisfied with such an arrangement. The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury would therefore propose to reply to the Agent of the Imperial Russian Treasury hy offering to place at the disposal of the Russian Government the equivalent of ■i &gt;■ - ... * 1 ^ v t * G‘.iO LOG i. .4 .) Forty thousand pounds per month for three months subject to certain conditions. In the first place the Russian Authorities would he urged to do all in their power to facilitate such exports from Russia into Persia as would not inter fere with the vital requirements of Russia. In the second place they would he informed that the capacity of your Bank to provide the iunds in ques tion must largely he dependent on the certainty and speed with which you are able to obtain consignments of silver remitted through Russia; and they would he asked to undertake to provide all possible facilities for the remittance of this silver. Their Lordships would at the same time inform the Russian Government that the Imperial Bank of Persia must reserve the right to suspend, subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government, the present arrangement in the event of there oeing any inter ference from whatever cause with the receipt by your Bank in Tehran of such consignments of silver as you may have provided for. as far as your Bank is concerned, the arrange ment would be that you should provide monthly in Tehran, against payment of Forty thousand pounds in London, the equivalent of this sum in krano at the rate of the day of transfer, in the event of your acceptingaccepting tlxe arrangement outlined above you would be required to make any purchases of silver resulting from this operation through the Deputy Master of the Mint. I am to request that you will lay the above pro posals before the Board of Directors and that you will inform me at your early convenience whether they are prepared, in so far as the Imperial Bank is concerned, to carry out the above-mentioned arrangement. On the receipt of your reply the Russian Govern ment will be addressed accordingly. Hiio '0 .305;Copy. (156633) ) ^ THE IMPERIAL BANK OP PERSIA, 25, ABCHURCH LANE, LONDON, E.C. Q Cuuxpo Sir:- I am desired to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. W.152561/16 of the 8th August. 2. The proposals contained in this letter have been laid before my Board of Directors, who desire me to reply without delay, that in so far as the Imperial Bank is concerned, they are fully prepared to carry out the arrangements suggested, viz. that against the payment of £40,000 in London by the British Government, they should place monthly at the disposal of the Russian Government in Teheran the equivalent of this sum in Krans, at the rate of the day of transfer, that is, the Bank’s buying rate for telegraphic transfers on London. It is under stood that this undertaking is dependent on the certainty and speed with which the Russian Government are able to facilitate the transport of Silver through Russia to Teheran. 3. The present position in regard to the importa tion of Silver through Russia into Persia by the Bank is as follows:- (i) Silver to the value of £25,000 has been des patched, and reached A.rchangel about the 27th July. It is presumed this consignment is now on it^s way from Archangel to Enzeli. (ii) £50,000 worth of Silver was despatched from Liverppol to Archangel on or about the 7th August, but up to the present we have not heard from the foreign office whether The Under secretary of State, Foreign office.whether the Russian Government will grant facilities for # its transport through Russia. (iii) As stated in the correspondence ending with Sir Maurice de Bunsen’s letter of the 17th July, a further consignment of £65,OCX) worth of Silver is awaiting despatch from London pending the receipt of the Russian Government’s permission. (iv} £35,000 worth of Silver purchased in Shanghai, and hitherto held up for want of the Russian Government’s permit, according to a telegram we have received to-day from Shanghai, is now 'being re-posted via Russia to Enzeli. My Directors would be very grateful if His Majesty’s Government could see their way to press the Russian authorities for the issue of rthe necessary orders still required in regard to items (ii) and (iii). 4. In addition to the above, the Bank has received a further request from their Manager in Teheran for the purchase and despatch of another £50,000 worth of Silver. My Directors are prepared to purchase this consignment at once, as you suggest, through the Deputy tester of the Mint, as part of the operation suggested in your letter under reply, if they can receive early instructions to that effect. 5. My Directors note with much satisfaction that with a view to the increase of trade, the Russian authorities will be urged to do all in their power to facilitate such exports from Russia into Persia as will not interfere with the Russian requirements. At the same time they would venture once again to bring to the notice of His Majesty’s Government the importance of reopening the Southern trade routes also. They hope thatthat it may tie possible to induce the Government of India to remove without delay all the existing restrictions on the forwarding of imported goods from the Gulf ports into the interior of Persia. As stated in my letter of the 21st July, apart from the relief that this would assure to the financial situation in Persia, the present opportunities for pushing both British and Indian trade are unusually favourable.

FUREIGtt uW 1US, August 12tli, 1916. air:- I an directed by Viscount Grey of Fallodon to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, 19507, relative to the question of the provision of funds for the use of the Kussian troops in Persia, and to state, in reply, that he approves of the proposals which the Lords uoninissioners of His Majesty's Treasury intend to make to the kussian Financial Agent in uondon on the subject. Before conveying this approval to Their Lordships Lord Grey has considered it desirable to obtain a formal assurance from the Imperial Bank of Persia to the effect that they would be able to supply funds in Tehran to the extent contemplated in the proposed arrangement, and copies of the correspondence exchanged with the Bank are enclosed, herein, for Their Lordships' information. Their Lordships will observe that, in convey ing the substance of your letter under reply to the Imperial Bank, Lord Grey considered it desirable to modify the paragraph in which it was suggested that the Bank should have the right of suspending the arrangement in the event of there being any inter ference in the receipt of silver despatched to Tehran The secretary to the Treasury.i Tehran, hy the insertion after the word 'suspend ■ of the words 'subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government.’' Lord Grey is at the same time replying to the memorandum from the Russian .mbassy enclosed in my letter of the 1st instant to the effect that he understands that an arrangement is being negotiated by your Department with the Financial Agent of the Russian Government in London. I am meanwhile to request that you will be so good as to furnish me with Their Lordships’ observa tions as to Whether the Bank should be requested to proceed with the further purchase of silver referred to in the penultimate paragraph of their letter.

This proposal, to which we entertain the strong est objection, was, it will be remembered, put forward by the Russian Government in March last (vide your letter Do.59342/16, dated 4th April), probably at the instance of the Russian Bank, in whose interest it was manifestly conceived. But it will also oe recollected that in their Memorandum and Aide Memo ire forwarded to us with your letter of the 26th May and endorsement of 3rd dune, the Russian Government definitely and delioerately discarded the The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.!f the proposal in favour of joint action oy the two Banks in accordance with the agreement of 1914 and the proposed Draft Contract with the Persian Government, in which they suggested certain amendments to which we agreed. We venture to hope that His Majesty 1 s Government will hold the Russian Government strictly to this decision, and will not permit the proposition to be revived. 4. In addition to the arguments given in the en closed Memorandum for regarding M. Heymann f s proposal as doth unnecessary and unwise, it may he observed that one effect of it would be to give to the Russian Bank, for the time being, complete control of the Exchange business in Persia. Thereby the position and prestige of the Imperial Bank would be seriously injured. In illustra tion of what judicious Exchange banking can accomplisii, it may be mentioned that notwithstanding the forced closing of some of our branches, our Chief Manager was aole to finance over eleven millions of Roubles in the six months ending 20th March, although during the same period only £90,000 worth of silver was imported. The Russian Bank should oe able to do as well if they would join us in the importation of silver. 5. Arising out of this discussion there are two points to which my Board desire especially to call attention. The first is the urgency of obtaining with out delay the Persian Governments acceptance of the proposed Joint Contract between that Government and the two Banks. Until the Contract is signed oy the Persian Government it cannot oe acted, upon; the Russian Bank cannot co-operate in the importation of silver, and will continue to complain of its inability to obtain Krans. It seems probable that a joint representation oy the BritishBritish and Russian Legations would result in a speedy settlement of this matter. Secondly, I am to urge very strongly the great importance of reopening the Southern trade routes, and of encouraging the free importation of goods into Persia. The Russians, according to M. Heymann, are unaole to remove their emoargo on exports from Russia. In my Directors’- opinion there is all the more reason for removing all restrictions on importation from the Gulf, not only with the object of relaxing the monetary stringency now existing in Persia and so facilitating the financing of the Russian requirements, but also in the best interests of British and Indian trade. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) Sydney Rogers. Sub-Manager.Dy the Chairman of the Imperial Bank of Persia. On Tuesday, 16th duly, 1916, the Board of this Bank met by arrangement M. Heymann, one of the Directors of the Banque d'Escompte de Perse. Mr. Y/ood, Chief Manager at Teheran of the Imperial Bank of Persia, was also present. M. Heymann began by saying that in making his observa tions, he wished it to be understood that he was not con cerned to argue about the interests of the Imperial Bank or of the Russian Bank, or about the proposed boint Con tract for the importation of silver into Persia. These were matters for separate consideration, and he might say at once that he had no objection to offer to the Draft Contract, as altered. But the procedure provided for by the Draft Contract, admirable as it might be in ordinary times, was not sufficient in the exceptional conditions created by the present war, and the point he wished to make was, that it was urgently necessary to contrive some special and temporary procedure by which the Russian Government could be provided immediately with sufficient Persia Currency to enable them to pay their troops in Persia. At present the greatest inconvenience and difficulty ware being experienced as the troops could not exchange their roubles for xrans, or could only do so at great loss. It had been calculated that five million Tomans would be required for the pay of the troops during the next six months. He thought that as the troops had been increased, the sum now required would be not less than six million tomans, and that it was impossible for the Persian Mint to coin Khans to this amount in the period mentioned. Therefore he thought the only course to pursue was for the Russian Government to ouy SilverSilver in London against a credit provided oy the British Government, and either in London or Russia to coin this silver into Krans, which they would send to Persia and use to pay their troops with. Without prejudice to the Agree ment embodied in the Joint Contract, by which he fully admitted the Russian Bank was bound, he asked the Imperial Bank, as a special and temporary measure for six months, to agree to the course which he proposed. He added that the Russian Finance Minister, M. Bark, was in favour of the special course suggested. It was pointed out in reply - 1. That the Persian Mint v/as now run by Belgians, and could be trusted to coin about £40,000 worth of silver, say 200,000 Tomans per week, or 5,000,000 Tomans in six months, so that if the Mint were kept fully supplied and constantly running, it could provide sufficient Krans for the pay of the troops. 2. Therefore the best and simplest arrangement would be for the two Legations to obtain the immediate consent of the Persian Government to the doint Contract, and for the Russian Bank at once to co-operate fully v/ith the Imperial Bank of Persia in purchasing at least £40,000 worth of silver a week, and so to keep the Mint constantly supplied. 3. That in the event of the Russian Bank requiring more than their due share of the coined silver, the Imperial Bank of Persia would supply them to the utmost of their ability with any balance required, at the then current rates for telegraphic transfer on London 0 4. That there was plenty of money hoarded in Persia, which could not be used owing to the restriction on imports. If these restrictions were removed, orders would at once be placed and merchants would freely ouy Rouble and sterling bills to pay for them, and quantities ol Krans would oe broughtbrought out into circulation. Therefore, the remedy for the present scarcity was, in addition to the coinage at the iviint, ior the Russian and English G-overnments to remove the embargoes on the import trade. m. Heymann replied that he was by no means so optimistic as to the out-turn of the Mint as we were, out admitted he had no personal knowledge on the subject. Mr. Wood, however, assured him that our estimate was by no means exaggerated. As to the trade, M. Heymann said emphatically that it was impossible for Russia to remove their embargo on exports to Persia. All their manufactures were needed in their own country. He admitted that England f s position was different, and that great advantage would result if the British and Indian Governments would reopen the Southern trade routes, and encourage the free importation of goods. It was further pointed out to M. Heymann that the importation, as he proposed, of Ts.5,000,000 (Krans 50,000,000) coined outside uersia would not improve the position if the war lasted more than six months and if the import trade continued to be closed. The money would be paid by the troops to the people in exchange for supplies, but the people would be no more able than before to buy Roubles, unless they could import goods. Therefore, at the end of the six months the operation would have to be repeated. M. Heymann admitted this, but hoped the war might be over in six months. Finally, after a lengthy discussion, M. Heymann said he would reconmend his Government - 1. To accept the Draft Joint Contract. £. to suggest that the Russian and English LegationsLegations should insist on the Persian Government also accepting it without delay. 3. To give meanwhile every facility for the import and transport to Persia of the silver already purchased by us. At first he wished to make it a condition of the above that we should consent to any deficiency oeing met by the coinage and importation of Krans; we replied that we could not agree to this, but would report his views to the Foreign Office. In the end he stated that he would make no condition, out that nevertheless he hoped we and the Foreign Office would see our way to agree to his proposal which he still desired to press. (Signed5 H.

Ct tL* ! tr*J +S- ' ' ‘ ' 7 Dear Sirs:- We Deg leave to state that the negotiations Detween the Managers of our respective Banks in Teheran concerning the drawing up of a new contract for the supply of silver to the Persian Government had to come to a standstill at a very early stage owing to different objections put forward Dy your Manager Mr. Wood. In a letter dated the 4th of May and addressed to our local Manager copy of which please find enclosed, your Manager in Teheran makes the following assertions. Firstly Mr. Wood does not find it fit to try and obtain from the Persian Government any improvement in the terns of the Schuster contract and rejects for this reason without any further motives the increase in the rate of commission from #o to and in the rate ot interest 11 om ^ 5 % to 7f 0 proposed by our local Manager In accord with' ^ Memorandum drawn up in London on the 3rd of February, 1914, We are obliged to state here and now that we are very much surprised a,t and at a loss to undci stand uhis objection. We had all reasons to believe that you entirely agreed with us as to the desirability of improving Mie terms of the Schuster Contract, besides such an improvement on the very face of it could not be otherwise than desirable serving as it does the commercial interests of both our Banks; at the same time the new rates proposed do The Board of the Imperial Bank of Persia, London,do not exceed those existing on the local money market. .Secondly Mr. Wood takes exception*to the keeping in tne new contract of the clause existing already in the bchuster Contract and by which the Persian Government reserves to itself the sole and exclusive right to import silver for coinage. kr. Wood considers that the clause is derogatory to ihe right o± the Imperial Bank of Persia to import silver for covering its outstanding banknotes such right having been recognised (conditionally on the sharing by both Banks of the import of the rest of the silver) by the diplomatic formula elaborated by the representatives of our two Boards in London in the beginning of this year. Moreover Mr. Wood proposes that our Manager should settle the above-mentioned difficulty with the Persian Government and declines to continue the negotiations pending such settlement. Nov/ concerning this matter we would like to point out first and foremost that during the whole course of the conversation which took place in London between you and our Delegates, there was no mention made as to our helping you to obtain let alone obtaining for you the assent of the Persian Government to import silver for the covering of your outstanding banknotes. i On the contrary, the Memorandum of this conversation ! clearly shows that you considered yourselves as already \ possessing such a right. We quote, 'The Russian Delegates put forward a request for our assent to their also having a right to import silver for their own account ... We could give no such assent It was mentioned that the recognition by the Persian Government of■“ ■■■I - - r.. 4- r r ri'r. rv ■ a - oi \j b^ c -OXO d'OH 00 : l bO - ;.( v./ - '.■■/ii..- ...l-.aco :- 0v . .! .

Por this reason we cannot hut consider Mr. Wood's attitude in this matter as entirely unwarranted by our preceding negotiations. It must be quite evident to you that we could merely promise not to raise any objections to the exercising of such a right by your Bank. Returning to the above-mentioned clause which Mr. Wood has taken exception to, we would like you to under stand that it was kept in the draft of the new contract solely because it already existed in the Schuster Contract drawn up by your Bank, and this seemed to prove that it entirely tallied with your concessionary rights. Although your right to import silver for covering the out standing banknotes is based, according to your own state ment, on the concession granted you in 1889 by the Persian Government, and should therefore be entirely independent of any later laws’ or stipulations, we nevertheless would not object to the clause in question being excluded from the contract, as far as our Bank is concerned, but we most emphatically decline any responsibility for the a.ttitude r f which the Persian Government may take in case of such l exclusion, and should it prove a stumbling block to the whole of the contract we would, to our great regret, have no choice but to forego the agreement arrived at with you in February 1914 in London. Thirdly Our Manager in Teheran deemed it prudent to insert into the draft of the new contract a clause giving thethe Banks the right of priority as to the coining of the sliver imported under the contract, namely he wished to prevent the possibility for the Persian Government to postpone the coining of said silver under the pretence of recoining old 'Krans'. We now learn for the first time f r° m mr - v;ood ’s letter that your Bank has concluded an agreement with the Persian Government concerning the recoining of old ”Krans”. At the same time Mr. Wood wishes us to understand that the projected clause concerning c.ne right ol priority is inconsistent with this agreement and as such must he removed. On our part however we cannot possibly consent to the removal of this clause as we should then have no guarantee of the silver impoi ced from abroad being ever coined in good time. It seems to us quite natural that under the existing circumstances no difference should be made between the silver proceeding i-rom old ”Krans” and the silver imported from abroad in other words‘that the old M Krans M should form part of your share of the silver supplied by both our 'Banks to the Persian Government, We trust that you will share this view, all the more so as, had you intended to / reserve the benefits accruing from the old ”Krans” to ^ yourselves over and beyond your normal share in the import of silver, you would surely not have failed to put this fact before our Delegates during their visit to London in February 1914. We do not like to think that Mr. Wood is intention ally endeavouring to hinder our coming to an agreement with regard to the u- v contract, as we believe that joint and friendly work would best forward the interest of our respective Banks, Nevertheless as the experience of the new contract in Teheran, which settling the terms ofwes undertaken mainly accordine to your wishes, cannot he called a very successful one and entails besides a w reat loss of time, we beg to forward you enclosed a draft of new contract and we venture to hope that you will give it as well as the subject of the present letter your kind attention, end favour is as soon as possible with your vie^s.

At lease 5 million tomans will be required by troops for six months and as Teheran mint is incapable Imperial Bank of Persia being also in need of coin - oi so large output Persian Government should consent to coin being minted elsewhere.

In sending this draft letter for your perusal, we would desire to mention that we have tried to act in an accommodating spirit towards the Russian Bank on the question of the joint Mint Contract, at the same time maintaining the necessity of our importing silver for the protection of our Note Issue, a necessity which, after explanation, was recognised by the Delegates of the Russian Bank when in London. The necessity for the recognition of that right by the Persian Government, as you inform us, is in the opinion of His Majesty's Minister in Teheran not vital, as he feels convinced that in practice no serious attempt will ever be made by the Persian Government to prevent us from importing silver, and if such an attempt were made, the The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office.“bne resistance could te overcome by diplomatic pressure.

(Signed) T. Jackson. Chairman. 2Dear Dir:- m*! i. 4 in Referring to your undated letter received through the Russian Embassy here and briefly acknowledged by us to you on 16th April last, we have been in communi cation thereon with our Chief IVIanager in Teheran. At the outset we would like to state that it is our desire to work amicably with the Banque d’Escompte de Perse and in collaboration with them, to our mutual benefit; with this object in view, we propose to deal with the points at variance between us in the following manner. Firstly. The more onerous terms, viz. 7% # interest and i% commission which Mr. Wood was diffident in putting forward to the Persian Government may now, the light of existing financial conditions, not be considered by them unreasonable, and we have given definite authority to our Chief Manager in Teheran to agree to the increase in the rates of interest and commission chargeable. Secondly. With regard to our view of the necessity for our retaining the right to import silver solely for the protection of our Note Issue, recent occurrences in Persia point to the importance of our so doing. We quite see your objection to giving active support to our contention vis-vis the Persian Govern ment, at the same time we understood that you agreed with Monsieur E. Lvoff, Chairman of Directors of the Banque d’Escompte de Perse, Petrograd. 2 c 1 : iwith ue as to its necessity from our point of view, ant this is home out by the remark in your letter under review viz. 'we could merely promise not to raise any objections to the exercising of such a right by your Bank'. Thirdly. With regard to the insertion of a clause in the new contract as to the priority of minting silver imported jointly under the proposed new Contract, and your fear that the minting thereof might be indefinitely held up owing to the recoinage of cracked and old coins by the Government, we do not think that is likely to happen as the recoinage is a matter of some expense to the Persian Government, and we are disposed to waive the point, but we cannot admit that cracked and oIll ^oins should form a portion of our share of the silver imported under the joint Contract - such silver as is indispensable for the bringing up of the old coins to standard would obviously form part of the silver imported under the joint Contract - but the view expressed by you that all the old coi ns reminted should form part of our share will, we feel sure be withdrawn, now that we have explained the matter. | The recoinage of these old coins is purely a j domestic matter for the Persian Government in their desire to keep the coinage in good order. We make no profit whatever on the remintage - indeed, it gives us a great deal of trouble - the Persian Government merely | making use of us as the State Bank for the collection 1 and forwarding of the coins. This we do from a desire'u_ t° keep tiie coinage in as good a state as possible for ohe general good of trade in the country, and to shew the light in which we regard this matter we are, if you so desire, quite ready to also share with you the ”Contract” entered into with the Persian Government in this regard. With this reservation (re remintage of old coins) we agree to the draft Contraxt enclosed in your letter under reply, which we take it.will he jointly presented to the Persian Government by the Ministers of Russia and Great Britain in Teheran, and have informed our Chief Manager to act in accordance therewith.('()'&lt; III )lv\' I I.M. r p j : 2394 1 • '3 Sir Edward Grey to Mr. Marling (Tehran).

Imperial Bank see some difficulty in incorporating such recognition in the new contract, and they suggest, therefore, that you should exchange with Persian Government separate diplomatic notes on subject. On their completion, Imperial Bank would proceed to discuss question of mint contract with Russian Bank.

Manager of Imperial Bank of Persia has so far objected to entering into discussion of such a contract on the ground that it is necessary in the first instance to ascertain how it would be viewed by Persian Government. Russian Government considers that Mr. Wood should be pressed to proceed immediately with drawing up of such a contract in consultation with manager of Russian Bank on lines of understanding arrived at between the two banks in London in 1914, and they ask for intervention of His Majesty’s Government in that sense.”CONFIDENTIAL.

There is also just now a strong anti-foreign current of opinion, acting more especially against ourselves and Russians. However, as it was clear when I urged this view on the Russian Minister that he had some suspicion that the Imperial Bank of Persia were only seeking to delay settlements of the minting question, I told him that I would address a note to the Persian Government. Personally I feel convinced that in practice the Persian Government will never seriously attempt to prevent the Imperial Bank of Persia from importing silver, and that if it did the Legations could overcome any resistance.j/j [This DooHnisiit is th6 Property of His Britannic Majesty s Gov^rTinipnt. ] r i ■ a. 1 A r ^ £-*53 n 47 ^ a Vi ; y PERSIA AND CENTRAL ASIA. ?

Tehran, February IQ, \&lt;dl4:. 1 HA L discussed the question of the varying interests of the Imperial Bank of lersia and the Banque d Escompte during a conversation yesterday and on a previous occasion with M. Ivorostovetz. He said that he was too newly arrived in Persia to be sufficiently up in the question to treat it in all its features, but it appeared to him that there are two cardinal questions upon which it ought to be possible to reach an agreement, namely, the right to import silver for the Persian Government for mintino 1 purposes, and the pledging of the revenues of the northern sphere as security for moneys advanced to the Treasury. M. Korostovetz did not think that we could do any good by discussing the first of these questions, as it was forming the subject of an exchange of views between the Governments of London and St. Petersburgh. As for the second question, he asked me to use my good offices in order to induce the Imperial Bank not to make any opposition to M. Mornard’s entering into arrangements with the Russian Bank which would entail the revenues of the north being pledged as security, and consequently being paid into the Russian Bank instead of into the Imperial Bank as at present. M. Korostovetz took occasion to assure me that the business methods of the bank are to be thoroughly overhauled, and that in the future the Treasurer-General will have no cause to complain of harsh treatment. I replied that I was extremely glad to hear that there was to be a change for the better in this direction. 1 pointed out that it would be much better for all concerned if the two institutions could carry on business in a spirit of legitimate rivalry without endeavouring to outdo each other. I said that he would always find me anxious and willing to assist in every way in my power to bring about a more satisfactory state of affairs, whilst it was obvious that it would be greatly to M. Mornard’s advantage to have two banks with which he could do business on fair terms. I added that it would appear from Mr. O’Beirne’s report of a conversation he had with M. Kokovtsof that there must be some misunderstanding as to the nature of the agreement under which the maliat collected in the northern provinces should be deposited in the keeping of the Banque d’Escompte. M. Mornard had made an agreement to that effect with the Russian Bank for one year, which terminated on the 21st March last, in return for which he was allowed to have a running overdraft of 200,000 tomans. M. Mornard had found the conditions of this agreement so unsatisfactory that he had paid off the sum owing, and had not renewed his agreement. He was then at liberty to enter into similar negotiations with the Imperial Bank, which under its charter, dating from 1889, has the right to carry on banking business throughout Persia. I pointed out to M. Korostovetz that I bad read with some surprise that he had said to both Mr. O’Beiroe and Sir G. Buchanan that M. Kokovtsof had complained bitterly of the situation of the Russian Bank, and had appeared disposed to hold the Anglo-Russian Agreement responsible for this unfortunate state of affairs. It seemed to me that the banking methods of the two banks have been so dissimilar hitherto that the one could not be held responsible for the failure of the other. It had always appeared that the Banque d’Escompte was run on political lines, which had for its object the getting possession of as much landed property as possible without paying much attention to bad debts. Why otherwise, I asked, had large loans been made on most insufficient security provided by landed property, and at very high rates of interest ? It had always been supposed that the Russian Government was prepared to run the risk of financial loss, in order to secure a large landed stake in the country through the bank’s claims on insolvent debtors. I added that the same policy as in the past is being pursued to-day, and that I had quite recently heard from Ispahan that, in addition to the administration of the immense properties of the Zil-es-Sultan by the manager of the Russian Bank, Russian protection is being accorded to all sorts of people who can lay no claim to it, at the instigation of the bank, in order to safeguard the money advanced on such properties. M. Korostovetz replied that the system upon which money had been lent on the [2063 ?‘—6] VAR 1914 Copy to f ' 20 MAR 19142 security of landed property is to be reorganised, and the situation liquidated, but it transpired in the course of the conversation that he did not see how a stop could be put to the old-established habit of lending money on mortgage. This is the root of all the mischief, and it would appear to me that it will be extremely difficult for the Russian Bank to liquidate a situation which has been baseo in the past upon loans on mortgage without either having to abandon a very large number of bad debts, force the Persian Government to make their debtors sell their properties at a heavy loss, or take over the properties m question, w ic would be contrary to treaty. It seems to me that if the Russian Government want us to use our influence with the Imperial Bank of Persia to give the Russian Bank a chance of doing business, they should at once take steps to put a stop to the growing abuse of Russians connected with the bank acquiring possession of villages by lease, which entails Russian protection being extended to the same. It is not indeed merely a question of leasing a village. The fact that a village is leased to a Russian subject or protected person means that every person in that village, or employed on the land in that village, becomes a Russian-protected person, against whom the 'Persian local authorities are powerless to act. The extent to which this is being carried on to-day in the Ispahan district will appear in an accompanying despatch. The manager of the Imperial Bank here is of opinion that it will he impossible for the Russian Bank to succeed as a financial institution unless the entire system under which business is carried on is fundamentally changed. Mr. Wood says that the Imperial Bank is quite ready to co-operate with an institution carried on in a business manner, but that the methods of the Russian Bank are quite foreign to those usually employed by bankers.

Russian Minister at Tehran in which he gave me some account of whTt Ukpkce Besides minor ofhcials the President of the Council, M. Sazonof, M. Poklewskv and M. Korostovetz himself were present. M. Kokovtsof, it seems, displayed the Neatest possible annoyance and dissatisfaction with regard to the present position of the Russfan Banque d Escompte. He said that the operations of the bank had practically come to a standstill and he severely blamed M. Poklewsky and the Russian Legation at Tehran for having failed to support its interests. M. Poklewsky defended himself and the legation with spirit, throwing the blame for the present state of things on the manage ment of the bank and the restrictions imposed on its action by the Ministry of Finance It was, however, agreed on al hands that the bank’s situation was well-nigh desperate' and M Kokovtsof propounded the question whether it should not wind up its affa rs and Withdraw from business in Persia altogether; but added that that would be a pretty result of collaborating^ in Persia with Great Britain. M. Poklewsky replied that such a course would be suicidal, and suggested, so far as I understand, that the bank should be managed more as a commercial undertaking and less as a department of the Imperial Treasury. No definite conclusions seemed to have been reached, and M Korostovetz which ou g rto e b^adoptT ared P 6 ' 0 ' 1 ’ 7 t0 ^ S reatl y P er P lexed ^e policy To come to greater detail, it appears that the most serious feature in the Russian Bank s position is that at the time when Count Witte was Minister of Finance it made loans freely to Persian private individuals of rank or importance, amounting in the aggregate to a very large sum. For years past the bank has been unable to recover either capital or interest^ on these advances. All attempts to enforce the claims by legal methods have been frustrated by the peculiarities of Persian law or the inefficiency of the judicial machinery, and the Persian Government have assisted the debtors in escaping payment. The possibility of insisting on a reform of Persian legal procedure was considered at the Interministerial Conference, but it was realised that a proposal of that kind would raise some very large questions and could not be expected to produce any results in the immediate future. M. Korostovetz expressed to me the opmion that a portion of the bank’s claims should be written off as bad debts, but that if the bank was to be set on its feet a determined effort should be made to collect the remainder. . ^ the Interministerial Conference M. Kokovtsof further complained that the maliat derived from Northern Persia was deposited wholly or in part with the Imperial Bank instead of with the Banque d’Escompte. He referred to this matter in a con versation which I had with him some days ago, and he then asserted that the Banque d Escompte had the right by agreement with the Persian Government to the deposit in its keeping of the maliat collected in the northern provinces. Finally M. Korostovetz informed me that M. Kokovtsof expressed himself as entirely dissatisfied with the compromise proposed by you in your note to Count Benckendorff of the 11 th August, 1913, with reference to the privilege of importing silver into Persia for minting purposes. The President of the Council maintains that the Russian Bank ought to be at least on a footing of equality with the Imperial Bank. That would not be the case under the proposed arrangement, for the Russian Bank would be entitled only to import half the balance of silver required, after the amount necessary to cover the Imperial Bank’s note issue had been provided. Moreover the [1967 #-3]firilt of the Imperial Bank to issue notes would enable it practically to make the rate of exchange so P that the Russian Bank would be at a disadvantage in regard even to that proportion of silver which it would be entitled to import. M. Kokovtsof touched on this poSt also during my recent conversation with him, and he intimated that the Russian Bank ought eithe/to participate share “fjf ToM ^ | importing silver, or else the two banks should respectively hold the exclusive concession | f0r 'irtouUobtluslybe impossible completely to satisfy M Kokovtsof s requirements Lith regard to the privilege of importing silver without largely sacrifacmg the nghte of ihe Imperial Bank under its present contract. At the same time I am afraid that, Inlets arrangements can be made giving the Russian Bank generally speaking, a fair Late of busmess as compared with the Imperial Bank, M.

Th 0 argument that adequate supplies of coin for the reserves required by a bank of issue could be obtained from interior collections and commercial operations is scarcely borne out by the actual facts in practice, as may be shown by the continuous supply of coin furnished to the Banque d’Escompte by the Imperial Bank in Tehran in exchange for notes. The remaining portions of your note allege that the position of the Imperial Bank infringes the principle of “ equal rights and privileges,” but I venture to point out that, since the Imperial Bank of Persia was established under the concession granted on the 30th January, 1889, and since the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 expressly sets forth that all existing concessions, irrespective of the sphere in which they happen to be placed, shall be maintained, no claim can be based on that instrument to equal rights or compensation for any privilege enjoyed by the Imperial Bank of Persia, which, moreover, by its concession, has t he right of actino- as a iStato Bank throughout the whole of Persia. In bringing these facts to your notice, 1 have the honour to repeat that, as set forth in the concluding paragraphs of my note to Count Benckendorff of the 11th August, the directors of the Imperial Bank of Persia are prepared, at my request, to share with the Banque d’Escompte et de Prets the privilege of importing silver for coinage on the condition explained in that note.

Imperial Haiih of Persia to Foreign Office.—(lieceived October 2.) ® ir » 25, Abchurch Lane, London, October 1 , 1913. \V E have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th September enclosing copies of the note addressed to the Russian Ambassador on the 11 th August and the reply from the Russian Charge d’Affaires on the subject of the mint contract with the Persian Government. I am directed by the board of directois to inform you that, with reference to the concession to the two natives, it specially states that “ if it does not contravene the arrangement made with the Imperial Bank.” This reference is to the minting arrangements made by the Medjliss itself, which did not expire until the 20th March, 1912. dhe Persian Government very properly passed the law in the year 1910 reserving to itself the right to import silver for coinage, and, as that law as never been cancelled, the granting of a concession to third parties, whereby the Persian Government gave up to them profits properly pertaining to the State, was ultra vires, and cannot be upheld. The maintenance to the Persian Government hitherto of this right has had the eftect of preserving a stable rate of exchange, and putting an end to the disturbance to trade caused by native speculation in exchange, and also to the unsatisfactory custom of farming out the mint to the highest bidder. The agreement made with the Treasurer-General oi Persia, dated November 1911, took effect on the 21st March, 1912, so as to preserve the continuity of relations between the Government and the Imperial Bank with regard to the better administra tion of the mint to which their contracts for the importation of silver made with the Imperial Bank had contributed so much. The monopoly for a note issue granted to the Imperial Bank and its appointment under its concession as the State Bank of Persia naturally carries with it the right to be the medium through which minted coin would be passed into circulation ; this right has been recognised on many previous occasions, e.g., in the substitution of nickel for copper coinage and the reminting of the old silver coin at present being carried out through the Imperial Bank. The Russian Bank is fully aware of the impossibility of obtaining adequate supplies of coin from interior collections and commercial operations to provide the reserves required by a bank of issue, as is proved by the continuous supply of coin furnished to it by the Imperial Bank in Tehran in exchange for notes. The argument of equal rights and privileges is one implied in connection with I the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, and is a matter which has no bearing on the ^ present question, inasmuch as the Imperial Bank of Persia was established in 1889 under the concession granted on the 30th January of that year. On the other hand, the Convention of 1907 is pledged to respect all existing concessions irrespective of the sphere in which they happen to be placed, and consequently the Russian Bank has j no claim to equal rights or compensation for any privileges enjoyed by the Imperial Bank of Persia. Although a question apart from that of the mint contract, the right of the Imperial Bank to concentrate in its hands the interior collections in the north of Persia cannot for the above reason be disputed, nor can the Russian Bank be said to possess interests that could be injured thereby, seeing that that bank holds no right for making interior collections in the north of Persia, whereas the Imperial Bank of Persia by its concession has the right of acting as a State Bank throughout the whole of Persia. The directors cannot see on what grounds they can be called upon to in any way revise the bank’s concession acquired by purchase twenty-live years ago from the Persian Government. I am, &amp;c. G.

Si?’ Edward Grey to Count Benckendorff. Your Excellency, ' Foreign Office, August 11, 1913. WITH reference to the memoranda left here by you on the 10th June and 3rd July, in which the hope was expressed that His Majesty’s Government would not support the claim of the Imperial Bank of Persia to their minting contract with the Persian Government, and the need was mentioned of the Banque d’Escompte obtaining the contract as an equivalent for the privilege of issuing bank-notes enjoyed by the Imperial Bank of Persia, I have the honour to bring the following facts to the notice of your Excellency :— In the former of those two documents it is contended that the contract of the Imperial Bank was invalid on the ground that it was never ratified either by the Medjliss or by the Persian Government, and in support of that contention it is alleged that the Medjliss on the other hand granted a concession for the supply of a certain quantity of silver to two Persian subjects. It must, however, be borne in mind that no reason has yet been put forward for holding that the Imperial Bank’s agreement either required ratification or was otherwise invalid. On the contrary, the Medjliss only conferred the above-mentioned concession on the two Persian subjects, if such concession did not contravene the Government’s existing arrangements with the Imperial Bank ; and as that concession did actually contravene the arrangements in question it was quashed, and the two natives have never imported any silver. This cancellation of their concession amounted to a recognition of the Imperial Bank’s minting agreement. Turning now to the desire expressed by M. Sazonof in the second memorandum under reference that the Banque d’Escompte should receive the contract in question, I would call your Excellency’s attention to the fact that the grant to the Imperial Bank of the monopoly of a note issue, coupled as it is with a provision for prohibiting the circulation of the notes as soon as payment on a single note is refused, and with the obligation to pay the whole of the notes forthwith, and also to keep one-third of the reserve in cash, involves an implied grant of at least the right to import for minting purposes sufficient silver to make possible the fulfilment of the obligation necessary to secure the continued enjoyment of the monopoly of the note issue. The grant, therefore, of a monopoly of minting silver to any other bank or firm would manifestly prevent the Imperial Bank from being able to fulfil their obligations and would thus be a violation of that bank’s concession. . Moreover, even if the Imperial Bank had not, under the concession, any implied grant of a right to import silver for minting, but such right remained exclusively m the hands of the Persian Government, the latter could not divest themselves of the right in favour of any third party to such an extent as would put it out of their power to permit the Imperial Bank to import for minting purposes sufficient silver to enable them to perform their concessionary obligations.. . In view, however, of the sincere desire of His Majesty s Government to act, w hen ever possible, in complete accord with the Russian Government, I have been in correspondence with the Imperial Bank of Persia, wffiose clnectors have, at my request, expressed their willingness to accept the following airangement . That the right to import for minting purposes enough silver for the fulfilment of the Imperial Bank’s concessionary obligation be assured to the Imperial Bank, and that, subject to that right, the privilege of importing silver for coinage should be shared by the Imperial Bank and the Banque de Prets et d Escompte.

I O [July 15.] Section 1, [31513] No. I. Foreign Office to Imperial Bank of Persia, Sir, _ Foreign Office, July 15, 1913. I AM directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to state, for the information of the directors of the Imperial Bank of Persia, that he has given careful consideration to your recent communications regarding the question of the Mint Agreement of the 27th November, 1911, between the Persian Treasurer-General and the Imperial Bank, against the validity of which instrument he has received energetic protests from the Russian Government. Sir E. Grey is unable to share your opinion that the Treasurer-General received by the law of the 23rd Janza, 1329 (13th June, 1911), full authority to conclude agreements for long periods of time on his own initiative and without reference to the Medjliss. Sir E. Grey was unable to allow His Majesty’s Legation to take notes of the agreement at the time of its being presented for registration five months after its conclusion, because its validity appeared to him to be doubtful, and because it was impossible for His Majesty’s Government to approve of a monopoly in favour of your bank when they had obtained assurances from the Persian Government that they would not grant such a monopoly to any one bank, institution, or person. Sir Arthur Hardinge obtained an assurance in the above sense from the Atabeg-i- Azam in 1901 and again in April 1907. Sir C. Spring-Rice received a promise from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that no preference in the matter of the importation of silver for coinage should be granted to anyone by the Persian Government. In view of their attitude in the past His Majesty’s Government might expose themselves to a charge of inconsistency should they now support your claim to such a monopoly, even if they held that the validity of your agreement could not be called in question. Sir E. Grey is, however, fully alive to the claim of your bank under your concession, and is of opinion that, even if you had not under that concession the implied grant of a right to import silver for minting, and such right remained exclusively in the hands of the Persian Government, the latter could not divest themselves thereof in favour of any third party to such an extent as would put it out of their own power to permit your bank to import for minting purposes sufficient silver to enable you to perform your concessionary obligations. I am accordingly to suggest, for the favourable consideration of your board, that a compromise might be effected on the following lines, viz., that the right to import for minting purposes enough silver for the fulfilment of your concessionary obligations be assured to the Imperial Bank, and that, subject to that right, the privilege of importing silver for coinage should be shared by the Imperial Bank and the Banque des Prets et d’Escompte.

Imperial Bank of Persia to Foreign Office.—(Received July 5.) Sir, 25, Abchurch Lane, London, July 4, 1913. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, in referee ce to the Mint Agreement between the Persian Government and the bank dated the 27th November, 1911. The directors have consulted Mr. Wood, the chief manager of the bank in Tehran, who is now in London. Mr. Wood was in Tehran at the time the contract was entered into, and is cognisant of all the circumstances of the case, and I am requested to forward herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State, a copy of Mr. Wood’s letter to the London manager of the bank, dated the 3rd instant, which my directors think replies to the points raised in your letter under acknowledgment, and, they venture to think, completely vindicates the bank’s position in the matter. I have, &amp;c. G. NEWELL, Manager. Enclosure in No. 1. Mr. Wood to Mr. Newell. St. Ermin's Hotel, St. James’s Park, London, Dear Mr. Newell, July 3, 1913. WITH reference to the Foreign Office letter of the 30th June, which I now return. In article 1 of the Law of the 13th June, 1911, it is clearly stated that the Treasurer- General is charged with the “ direct ” and effective control of all financial operations, such as our Mint contract. Therefore, if he had to refer that operation to the Medjliss, it would not be direct control. In clause 3 of article 2 it is stated that the Treasurer-General shall establish an office for all transactions of the Government with the bank (the State Bank) and operations respecting the minting of bullion, &amp;c. Under the circumstances, it would be quite impracticable for every transaction between the Government and the bank to be first vised by the Minister of Finance, in order that it may have the force of law. Otherwise, we would come to a standstill, and defeat the very ends of the law which gave the Treasurer-General power to exercise his own discretion in matters of this nature. Article 6 therefore has no bearing on the subject, especially as the business^ of minting has been carried out by the Imperial Bank of Persia to the entire satisfaction of the Persian Government, who sought no “ improvement ” in that direction. Improve ment ” was assured when the Medjliss closed the Mint to the public, and placed the coinage entirely in the hands of the bank, and Shuster was only carrying out the policy of the Medjhss when he gave us the Mint for ten years. Several members of the Medjliss told me how pleased they were at what Shuster had done, and thus secured the Mint on a sound basis. . ■ . .. We rely entirely upon the Law of the 13th June, 1911, which the Bussian Minister himself was eventually compelled to accept. In this connection J beg to cite the incident of a cheque for some 300,000 roubles (30,000L) drawn by the Minister of Finance on the Imperial Bank of Persia in favour of the Bussian Minister and in payment for ceitain arms, &amp;c., purchased from the Bussian Government. When that cheque was presented the Imperial Bank of Persia, in view of the Law of the 13 th June, 1911, declined payment, and the Bussian Minister was obliged to obtain a new order on the bank signed by Mr. Shuster. With regard to the granting of a concession by the Medjhss to two natives to import silver, the two natives in question were members of the^ Medjhss, and represented a constituency of Tabriz, where they had sustained (so they said) consideiab e loss during the disturbances at that place. Their claim on the Persian Government was [2987 e —2] /T \ 2 1 8 auGIS: * v)settled by the Medjliss granting them a concession to benefit by the import of a stated quantity of silver for coinage, if it did not contravene the Grovernment s existing arrangements with the bank. . i i As that concession did contravene existing arrangements the bank protested, and the matter was quashed, and the two natives have not imported a single ounce of silve 7 '' * to this day. Apart from this question of principle, the two natives have not the necessary capital to import silver, but rely on the bank advancing the money to do so. This of course was merely the Oriental way of circumventing an awkward situation, and leaving the bank to do what the Medjliss shirked. The same applies to our ten-year contract. The Persian Government is glad to know that the contract exists, but gladder still to think that the onus of fighting the issue does not lie with them, although I’ve no doubt they would cave in to the side which makes the most noise about it.

An infringement of the Mint contract concluded with the bank by Mr. Shuster under full authority. (2.) Would violate the bank’s concession, and (3.)

Yours sincerely, A. 0. WOOD. (5.) Mint Agreement. An agreement made between the Imperial Bank of Persia (hereinafter called the bank) of the one part and the Imperial Government of Persia, acting through its representative the Treasurer-General of Persia by and with the authority of the Law of Medjliss of the 23rd of Jauza, 1329 (their year), (hereinafter called the Government), of the other part, by which the bank undertakes to buy bar silver for account of the Government and for shipment to Persia for the purpose of coinage by the Imperial Mint upon the following terms :— 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1. This agreement shall be in force for the period of ten years from the twenty- second day of March, 1912. 2. The Government, having reserved to itself the exclusive monopoly of importing silver for coinage, the bank is hereby appointed sole agent for the purchase of such silver and for the forwarding of the same to Tehran, and the Government binds itself not to import any silver whatsoever through the agency of any other party nor to purchase silver imported by any other party during the period of this agreement. The Government agrees to pay all expenses covering the purchase of the silver and its transport of Tehran, including insurance, &amp;c., incurred by the bank for account of the Government, as set forth in article 8. 3. The Government binds itself to purchase exclusively from the bank all foreign exchange for the importation of the silver in question. 4. The rate for the purchase of all such exchange is fixed upon the basis of f per cent, (three-quarters per cent.) above the buying rate of the bank for telegraphic transfers on London. The price at which the silver is to be purchased shall be determined simultaneously with the fixing of the rate of exchange. 5. The amount of silver to be imported under the terms of this agreement will be determined by the Government month by month, but it is understood that should it not be profitable to import, on account of the rate of exchange and the price of silver, it will not be binding on either side to import under such conditions. 6. The Government agrees to pay the bank a commission of ^th per cent, (one- eighth per cent.) on the value of all bar silver imported during the period of this agreement; this commission to be calculated on the sterling cost of the silver payable in krans at the same rate for sterling as fixed for each parcel of silver purchased. 7. The bank agrees to provide such sums as shall be required from time to time for the purchase of bar silver to the extent of 300,0001. (say three hundred thousandpounds sterling), of which the equivalent will be repaid as the silver is coined by the Imperial Mint. Interest on all such advances shall be charged at the rate of 5 per cent, (five per cent.) per annum. 1 8. All silver en route to Tehran, in the bank and at the Mint, during the process of coinage or otherwise, will remain under hypothecation to the bank as security for the sums advanced. It is agreed that—should the necessity arise—the approximate profit accruing to the Government on each parcel of silver sent to the Mint is to be held at the disposal of the Government from time to time in advance, full provision however, being allowed for the refund of the cost of such silver and the charges and interest due to the bank. It is also agreed that the amount of silver necessary to be at the Mint at any one time, m order to keep the machinery fullv employed, is considered to be about 50,000L (say fifty thousand pounds).

'Ve have always claimed a privileged position for the following reasons :— 1. Article 1 of the bank’s concession states: “The Government of His Imperial Majesty the Shah grants by this concession to Baron Julius de Reuter, and his associates or representatives, the right of founding a State Bank in the Persian Empire under the name of “ The Imperial Bank of Persia,” and the capital of the bank was called up in terms of the said article. 2. The bank has the exclusive right to issue notes in Persia which would require us always to be in a position to have silver coined ; a position to which no other institution in Persia can lay claim. I call your attention to my predecessor’s letters dated the 16th and 23rd October, 1901, and 7th and 18th March, 1907. Mr. Griffin to Sir T. Sanderson Sir, October 16, 1901. I have the honour to forward for your information and the consideration of the Secretary of State copies of two telegrams received yesterday from the chief manager of the Imperial Bank at Tehran, and a third addressed to the chief manager by the Imperial Bank to-day. Although this correspondence deals with a report not yet officially confirmed, we have instructed our chief manager to take immediate action to protest before the conclusion of a transaction which would cause most serious injury to the interests of the Imperial Bank ; which would imperil English interests and compel us seriously to consider our position and future in Persia. On behalf pf the board of the Imperial Bank I would solicit the assistance and intervention of His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to prevent and prohibit the grant to a Russian bank, supported by the Russian Imperial Treasury, of any control of the Persian Mint or exclusive right to coin silver as inconsistent with our concession and our position as the State bank. The question of the dismissal, or rather the threatened dismissal, of Mr. Maclean, the administrator of the Mint, at Russian dictation, on the ground that he is a British subject, affect^us very seriously; but it is not one of which the Imperial Bank can take official notice. It may, with the utmost confidence, be left to His Majesty s legation to prevent such discourteous treatment of a British officer who has given complete satisfaction in the conduct of his duties, and was recently appointed by the PrimeMinister to the office which he now holds. Nor does the ground of his dismissal appear to be one which can be openly advanced or avowed by a friendly Power. 1 have, &amp;c. LEPEL GRIEFIN, Chairman. ( 8 .) Translation of Telegrams received from the Imperial Bank of Persia, Tehran, October 15, 1901. on (Sent at 3‘25 p.m.) Russian Minister obtained immediate dismissal, H. W\ Maclean being English subject. (Sent at 5'45 p.m.) It is reported, and information is apparently reliable though not confirmed, Persian Government granted Banque de Prets de Perse exclusive rights mint silver or make a contract having similar result; this would compromise our business and make position very dangerous. British Minister requests chief manager remain another week pending answer Foreign Office who well informed. (9.) Mr. Griffin to Foreign Office. gj r ' October 23, 1901. I have the honour to acknowledge your letter of the 19th instant, and in reply to the enquiry of the Secretary of State as to the special provisions of the concession on which reliance is placed as supporting the request for the intervention of His Majesty’s Government, I would beg, on behalf of the board of the Imperial Bank, to submit that your reading of the terms of the concession is entirely correct, and that the letter of the chairman was careful to do no more than point out that the assign ment to the Banque de Prets of any control of the Persian Mint or exclusive right to coin silver was inconsistent with the position of of the Imperial Bank of Persia as a State bank, guaranteed under the first article of the concession. The board of the Imperial Bank has never claimed these rights for itself, although they might with advantage and propriety have been granted by His Imperial Majesty to a financial institution holding the place and style of the State bank ; but to assign them to a rival banking institution, under the control of and supported by the funds °f the Russian Government, would be a delegation of powers which can only be held independently by the Persian Government or by the State Bank on its behalf. It would confer upon the Russian bank privileges which, consistently with article 1 of the concession, can only be granted to the Imperial Bank. This alone is the ground, so far as the concession is concerned, on which we have ventured to solicit the intervention of the Secretary of State. 2. Nor have we reason to believe that the continued prosperity and legitimate influence of the Imperial Bank of Persia is not an object of solicitude to His Majesty s Government, seeing that ’we have so often and so promptly received the most generous and kindly consideration from the Secretary of State. Should the control of the Mint and the exclusive right to coin silver be granted to the Russian Bank, the effect on the Imperial Bank would be serious and might be disastrous; and it would compel the directors to seriously consider their position in Persia which at the present time is in a thoroughly sound financial condition. 3. It is the intention of the board to at once summon their chief manager to London to confer on matters, such as the above, connected with the working of the Imperial Bank ; and to explain a situation which is rendered obscure by the various rumours which reach us by telegraph, and which cannot be accepted without reserve. Our relations with the Russsian institutions in Persia have been friendly since our installation ; and we have no desire to embitter those relations by any hasty or unfriendly' step. At the same time we must endeavour to defend ourselves agamsaction of the Persian Government which would destroy our position as a State bank, and might compel our withdrawal from Persia ; and we would thus solicit the good offices of the Secretary of State to strengthen the protests of our chief manager against a policy which would be so injurious to us. There is no advantage in protesting against a /&lt;u£ accompli, but a timely protest by His Majesty’s Government against an intended measure will not be without the desired effect. X have &amp;c LEPEL GRIFFIN, Chairman. ( 10 .) Mr. Griffin to Foreign Office. • Sir, March 7, IbJJ- - I have the honour to submit for your consideration, and that of His Majesty’s Secretary of State, the opinion of the directors of the Imperial Bank of Persia that the time has come when they may confidently call upon the Government to assist them in safeguarding and maintaining the undoubted rights, granted to their institution by the Royal Charter and their concession, which are directly attacked and endangered by the concession newly given to the so-called National Bank at Tehran by the Shah. A copy of this concession is doutless already in your hands, but for convenience of refer ence the document, ratified by the Shah about the 1st February, is hereto attached. 2. Your acquaintance with Persian affairs is so accurate and complete that it is unnecessary for me to take up your time with more than a brief statement of the considerations which have induced the board to solicit the early intervention of the British Government. It is in the first place evident that the National Bank has but a provisional and shadowy existence, and it might be held that in protesting against a concession which could never become effective we were fighting a phantom rather than a reality. It is true that there is little likelihood of the capital of the National Bank being subscribed locally by Persians. There is little money in the country, and those who possess it, too thoroughly distrust their Government to give it in relief of the Shah’s necessities. But there is great danger of the capital required being supplied, under some colourable pretext or through nominal Persian subscribers by Germany, which is notoriously anxious to obtain a locus standi in Persia. Without trade interests, Germany is endeavouring to found a German bank in Tehran, the clerks to man which have already arrived, while the director is shortly expected. Nothing is more probable than that the Persian Government, disgusted by the amicable relations now existing between England and Russia, which remove the advantages which the rivalry of these nations had so long procured them, may turn to German}' for financial assistance. 3. Whether the embryonic National Bank ever obtains an independent existence or not, it is clear that the Shah, yielding to the extravagant demands of the Assembly, has granted what is opposed to the legal rights of the Imperial Bank of Persia and what may endanger its very existence unless resisted and cancelled. The board would specially invite your attention to clause 8 of the concession to , the National Bank, providing that when silver is required for the Mint the National j Bank will have priority of import and sale. The deadly effect of this clause on our supply of silver to duly pay notes presented has been already brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran by our chief manager on the 9th ultimo. It amounts to a virtual cancelment of our concession. This clause should be also read wit i clause 4 in which the right of issuing notes is promised to the National Bank when the Imperial Bank’s concession shall have expired or otherwise terminated. Ihus a direct incitement to make runs upon our bank is created, which, if ° remains in force, we shall be unable to meet. No allusion to a future grant of this monopo y should have been allowed by the Persian Government seeing that our concession has many years to run. - • p i i u r 4. The directors also desire to point out that the security for the loans botk ot the British Government and the Imperial Bank will be endangered if, as is proposed the customs of the Gulf ports be assigned to the National Bank against subscribed capital; while the dismissal of M. Naus and his deputy M. Pnem leave the collection and appropriation of this revenue in hands in which we have no confidence. 5. The board of directors would consequently respectfully solicit His Majesty s Government to make the strongest possible protest against a policy which, m ic mg Torn o m Cgrievous injury on the Imperial Bank which represents British interests in Persia, is in opposition to engagements as to the application of Customs revenues which have been given to the Governments of England and Russia. 6 The directors would suggest that the Shah be invited to consider the expediency of treating the Imperial Bank of Persia as the State Bank, it has been always acknowledged to be and to absorb in it the National Bank, which could he effected without insuperable difficulty and with a slight alteration in our charter. Unless a determined effort be made in this direction we fear that the ground may be cut from beneath our feet, either by the National Bank, founded by foreign capital secretly subscribed, or by the open action of the Deutsche Orient Bank under the direction of Herr Gutmann of the Dresdner Bank who is shortly expected in Tehran. I llctVC (&amp;C LEPEL GRIFFIN, Chairman. (II.) Mr. Griffin to Foreign Office. Imperial Bank of Persia, 25, Abchurch Lane, London, March 18, 1907. By desire of the Secretary of State I attended at the Foreign Office on the 12th instant, and discussed with Sir Eldon Gorst some points in my letter to you of the 7th instant, on which Sir Edward Grey required further information and explanation. These I supplied to the best of my ability, but suggested that it would be more satisfactory if I submitted these explanations in writing which I have now the honour to do. e _ 5 2. Two preliminary observations I would, however, venture to make in order, in some way, to clear the ground. The first is that the points to which special attention was directed in my interview with Sir Eldon Gorst are only the most striking and dangerous parts of a general conspiracy against the rights and existence of the Imperial Bank of Persia ; whether inspired and directed by the Shah and his Ministers, or by a revolutionary body pretending to speak in the name of the people of the country. The second observation is merely to suggest what has doubtless already occurred to you who know Persia so well, that the ingenious and skilfully drawn documents embodying the new Constitution and the concession to the National Bank have rather an Occidental than an Oriental flavour and origin may, without impropriety, be attributed to whomsoever might be expected most to benefit from the resulting confusion. 3. The first point regarding which Sir Edward Grey desired specific information was the manner in which the grant to the National Bank of the priority of import and sale of silver to the Mint conflicted wdth the text of our concession. It does not directly violate the letter of our concession, but it violates its spirit and would endanger the very existence of the bank. Every express right granted implies that the grantor will not take such obstructive or hostile action that the grantee will be unable to enjoy the right which he has acquired and for which he has given full consideration. To concede the right of priority of selling silver to the Mint to be coined, gives a preference to the National Bank which should be a prerogative of the Imperial Bank of Persia as the State bank. The free and unrestricted coinage of silver is the essential condition for the maintenance of our note concession. The first and imperative duty of a bank of issue is to hold and maintain a sufficient supply of silver coin with which to pay its notes, and the only means of replenishing the bank treasury is to import and coin silver. To grant a preferential right to the National Bank of importing and coining silver would virtually make that establishment the State bank, would render the Imperial Bank of Persia dependent for its coin upon the National Bank and thus jeopardise its continued existence. Nor would any analogy, such as that of the National Bank of Egypt, which may seem to hold a some-, what similar position, be other than misleading, for Egypt is a country under English control and enjoying all the monetary and financial facilities of European countries. But in Persia the import, the transport, and the coinage of silver are matters of grave difficulty : for years the Russian Government prohibited the carriage of silver through its territory and the Imperial Bank was compelled to bring its silver on mules from Bushire to Tehran, exposed to many dangers and losses from robber tribes. With an unfriendly Government and a National Bank possessing preferential rights our position would be impossible.This very question was discussed in 1901 when thprp o T Russian Banque de Frets to obtain control of the Persian Mint and TelxXs ve ri!ht of coining silver; and I would resnectfullv qnlW o exclusive ngiit 23rd October 1901, to the address of yourTredecessor, iTn^avlreV to - answer Lord Lansdowne s enquiry as to our concession rights in the matter of the concession was then proposed to be granted to a competing Russian bank But wbh greater force, i may be contended that the present violation of right is fa^ less justifiable ; as it is not due to the pressure of a formidable Power but to the deliberate action of the Government of Persia in defianpp nf ito i ’ ° ueiibarate n , • i j aVr uenance ot own solemn engagements That Government is precluded from pleading its desire to maintain our right! (as “s nossiblv true), and urging that it is the National Assembly that insists on infringing them \^ e s ®“ nd P° mt on which the Foreign Secretary desired further information was whether there was any evidence that the Customs of the Gulf ports were promised as security for advances to be made by the National Bank. This is naturally! matter which would be kept as much in shadow as possible. But it has been asserted more than once by our chief manager, and he repeats it in a letter of the 28th February received on the 14th instant, a copy of which I enclose together with an interesting demi-oftcial. letter to the London manager of the same date. The British Legation will be able to state whether he has been correctly informed ; but, in any case, if the Belgian officials are withdrawn and the Gulf Customs, depleted bv the dishonesty and corruption of the Persian officials, are paid into the National Bank, the advances of the British and Indian Governments and the loans of the Imperial Bank will be in undoubted danger. u- 5. The directors of the Imperial Bank would invite the particular attention of is Majesty s krovernment to the letter of Sir John Hollams, the legal adviser of the Imperial Bank, dated the 14th March and hereto attached. This distinguished lawyer who has an intimate knowledge of the bank’s affairs from its foundation, is entirely in accord with the board in holding the concession of the National Bank to be manifestly inconsistent with the concession possessed by the Imperial Bank. And if this general contention be allowed, it will be the less necessary to determine whether the cunning hand of the draftsman of the concession to the National Bank has, in any particular clause, invaded the existing rights and privileges of the Imperial Bank of Persia, which is, by its constitution supported by a Royal Charter, the State Bank, and, more over, the National Bank of Persia. For while its position as a State bank is expressly declared 6 in the preamble to the Deed of Settlement and in articles 1 and 3 of its concession, and I would invite special attention to clause 5, “ the object of this hank as a national^institution being the public weal and good of the State, &amp;c.,” where institution’ is merely substituted for bank for tautological reasons, and the Imperial Bank of Persia is virtually declared to be a National Bank. 6. I apologise for the length of this letter, but the board of the Imperial Bank feel that it is their imperative duty to place before His Majesty’s Government, fully and frankly though with all due moderation, their conviction that the interests they are appointed to advance and safeguard are threatened with grave loss and even destruction, if the Persian Government, by its own volition or on the demand and at the instigation of other interested parties, be permitted to transfer to another institution, the functions, rights, and privileges which, in law and equity, can be exercised by the Imperial Bank of Persia alone. The directors fully appreciate the critical state of Persian affairs and the inevitable weakness of an impecunious administration ; and they are content to leave the time and manner of British intervention to the better judgment of His Majesty’s Government from whom they have received in the past so much kindness and consideration, and so many assurances that their undoubted rights, confirmed under Royal Charter, will be adequately defended should they be ever seriously attacked or endangered. For this support and for this sure and powerful defence the directors of the Imperial Bank appeal, with the utmost confidence, to His Majesty’s Government.

IN the course of our conversation on the 2nd April last year, you said that you would consult your colleagues of the Imperial Bank of Persia and write a letter regarding the Mint contract between the Persian Government and the bank, about which the Russian Government complained to us. We have, however, received nothing from you except a short letter dated the 17th April, 1912, stating that the matter wns forming the subject of correspondence with your chief manager at Tehran. Sir Edward Grey has now received a telegram from Sir W. Townley to the effect that he learns from your acting manager at Tehran that a contact is now before the Cabinet for conferring on the Russian Bank a monopoly to coin silver. This contract would grant to the Russian Bank the sole right to import silver for coinage at the Mint from 14th July next for an indefinite period, that is. that the date of termination of the. contract is not filled in, though Sir W. Townley has been told that it is intended to run until 21st March, 1915. _ Apparently the manager of the Russian Bank is making every effort to succeed, as he hopes to get promotion if he can arrive at St. Petersburgh—whither he is soon proceeding —with the contract signed. Mr. Brown has told Sir W. Townley that he thinks such a contract would violate the concession of the Imperial Bank, as under that document it is necessary for you to be able to import silver in order to be in a position to maintain the necessaiy bu hon reserve under your note of issue contract. ,, Sir W.

He realises, however, that it is of course possible that Mr. Shuster may have had such authority from some other instrument or source, and I am to enquire whether you can furnish any information both as to this point and also as to whether by any law other than that of the 13th June, 1911, or by any constitutional practice, such contracts as that now under discussion require to be sanctioned by the Medjliss or the Persian Government. In this connection I am to add that Sir E.

Under this contract Russian Bank is granted the sole right to import silver for coinage at the mint from 14th July next for an indefinite period. That is to say, the date of termination of contract is not filled in, but the Treasurer-General tells me that it is intended to run until 21st March, 1915. Negotiations for this contract have been going on for a long time. Russian Minister pressed it very hard before his departure without success, and now manager of the bank and Russian Charge d’Affaires are redoubling their efforts, apparently, as the Treasurer-General tells me, because the manager, who is about to leave for St. Petersburgh, hopesjto get promotion if he can arrive with the contract in his pocket. Acting manager of Imperial Bank of Persia asserts that such a contract would be a violation of Imperial Bank of Persia’s concession, under which it is clearly necessary for them to be able to import silver in order to be in a condition to maintain the bullion reserve exacted under their note of issue contract. Were it not for strong pressure being exerted in favour of Russian Bank by the Russian Legation, I should not consider that it was my business to meddle in the question, but, under the circumstances, I have asked Treasurer-General to defer action pending the receipt of your instruction.

On the other hand, the manager of the Imperial Bank maintains that, under the law of the 13th June last (see my despatch No. 95 of ) that dateb Mr. Shuster was empowered to conclude a contract of the kind without ' / / special reference to the Medjliss.

The Government agrees to pay all expenses covering the purchase of the silver and its transport to Tehran, including insurance, &amp;c., incurred by the bank for account of the Government, as set forth in article 8. 3. The Government binds itself to purchase exclusively from the bank all foreign exchange for the importation of the silver in question. 4.

THE ‘ Novoe Vremya” of the 4th February publishes a letter from Tehran, dated the 24th January, signed “ Elm,” and directed against Mr. Shuster. The writer, after formulating all the old grievances against Mr. Snuster, his aggressive personality, his lack of tact, his disregard of established Persian customs, &amp;c., makes a sarcastic allusion to Mr. Shuster’s boasted magnanimity in renouncing the two and a-half years salary due to him from the Persian Government. The writer avers that while Mr. Shuster was talking grandiloquently of his self-denial in this respect, he was at the same time pocketing a sum of 61,000 roubles, which the Imperial Bank of Persia paid to him in his capacity of treasurer-general when he no longer filled that office. This sum is alleged to have been paid by Mr. Wood to Mr. Shuster, in order to secure the extension for ten years of the right enjoyed by the bank to import silver for minting purposes. The extension of this right for one year was secured last year with the consent of the Medjliss and the observance of all proper formalities, but now Messrs. Shuster and Wood have dispensed with all such troublesome restriptions. The writer goes on to say that, from a legal point of view, this transaction constitutes a punishable “ abuse and breach of trust,” while from the political point of view, it is a direct infraction of articles 1 and 2 of the Anglo-Russian Agreement, and subversive of the interests of the Russian bank. Sir G. Barclay himself in private conversation has gone so far as to say : C’est un abus. The letter finally points out that while Mr. Shuster has decamped and cannot be proceeded against, his accomplice, Mr. Wood, is a British subject and is still in Tehran. I ri QATP GEORGE W. BUCHANAN.

[From a Special Correspondent.] M. Mom arc!, temporary Treasurer-General in Teheran, has sent to Belgium an extra ordinary message bringing grave charges against Mr. Shuster, his predecessor. The message brings down upon the Persian situa tion, which appeared to be clearing, an ominously dark cloud. There is something very sinister in the haste with which M. Mornard has rushed into print with such allegations. Briefly the Charges are these :— 1. The discovery of a secret contract, to last for ten yea rs, signed by the director of an English bank and Mr. Shuster, maintain ing a monopoly of bullion for coinage, all unknown to the Persian Government. 2. A deficit on current accounts in the bank of £80,000. 3. Mr. Shuster took before his departure his salary for three years, without authorisa tion, plus a large sum for the expenses of his journey. 4. Mr. Shuster went away without con senting to the audit of his accounts. 5. The receipts from the Customs have in creased in nine months by £360,030 in spite of troubles. In endeavouring, for obvious reasons, to discredit his predecessor, M. Momard has only succeeded in showing his own remark able ignorance of financial matters, and in ; demonstrating that Mr. Shuster’s policy is a j good and fruitful one. BULLION CONTRACT. With regard to the bullion contract. Mr. Shuster clearly acted in the best interests of Persia. Far from doing what he did “ unknown to the Persian Government,” Mr. Shuster made the arrangement in complete harmony with an understanding entered into j between the hank and the Government. The fact is that a twelve months’ agree- ment existed between the bank and the State for a supply of silver at the rate of one-fourth per cent. Mr. Shuster knew that if silver ran (Short, the rouble, a fairly effective Russianising agency, would appear ; one-fourth per cent., too, he regarded as too j much to pay. He was successful in reducing that rate by one-half and in extending the agreement for ten years. Clearly that was to the advantage of Persia. The deficit which M. Mornard charges Mr. Shuster with being responsible for is a , simple book deficit. All customs in Persia I are credited to Russia in the interest of loans advanced to Persia. The interest is disbursed to the Government at Teheran twice a vear. I n the intervals there ar« facilities for borrowing from the bank, on the security of that interest, to meet cur- t rent expenses. So the second accusation falls to the ground. As to the charge of taking three years’ j salary without authorisation, the truth is that Mr. Shuster had a three years’ agree- ment. When he was dismissed he was en titled to his salary for the remaining por tion of his term and his travelling expenses. He was offered more, but he took nothing hut his legal dues. As to the alleged refusal to consent to an ! audit, Mr. Shuster, knowing that M. Mor nard was hostile to his policy, refused to ' hand over his books to the Belgian official. ' He did, however, give keys and hooks to ■M-i'. Cairns, another official, from whom he received a certificate stating that the ac- ‘ counts having been checked and official re cords and contract-s examined, everything was in order. TRIBUTE TO MR. SHUSTER. The fifth item in the indictment is really a high tribute to the ex-Tressurer-Generai. j ‘he nine months, during which customs re ceipts have increased by £360,000, practi- calh’ cover Mr. Shuster’s term of office, and the result is a demonstration of the practi- ! cal working of and the necessity for Mr. \ Shuster’s policy. Certainly a few weeks of ; control give M. Mornard no claim to the | credit of this achievement. Thus the whole 1 structure of M. Mornard’s accusations is demolished. But worse than all the bluster of M. Mornard’s message is the position of affairs which it reveals. In the wide empire of the Tsar supervision from headquarters is hound to be loose; an emissary outside its borders has often too free a hand. In Persia there is much firmly established cor ruption ; there are financiers and would-be monopolists who know no patriotism and have no regard for a small, struggling nationality save to exploit it. A dependent Persia, an exploitable Persia, is what they want. And it looks tolerably clear that those parasites and oppressors prefer M. Mornard to Mr. Shuster. It is to such persons and to interests inimical to a free and independent Persia that M. Mornard evidently believes he must appeal to make hie position secure. That is the danger in the situation. NO WAR OVER PERSIA. S v ach a state of affairs makes the position more difficult than it has been before. Still it ca.n only be faced in one way, and it is certain that Sir Edward Grey is putting forth every effort to solve this distressing problem. England cannot go to waj- over Persia. The Anglo-Russian Con vention is too valuable to be torn up. All tha(t can be done is to use that agreement as the basis of diplomatic negotiation to bring about an arrangement which will secure to Peneia her rights and liberties. Both countries are in honour pledged by it to maintain the integrity and independence of Persia, and also to help her in domestic reform. For the sake of humanity that engagement must he kept and carried out. To reach a settlement in this way is the aim of the British Govern ment, and its policy should secure the strong support of the nation. r\1 1 CONFIDENTIAL. 23 I 9 1 Sir Edward Grey to Sir G.

There is no article in the law of 13th July [sic] prescribing that the consent of the Medjliss is necessary for such contracts, but Russia might contend that, in default of any express provision in that law empowering the treasurer-general to dispense with it, consent of the Medjliss, which was required in the two previous contracts, is necessary. In support of this she might invoke articles 18 and 24 of the constitution (see Sir C. Spring-Rice’s despatch of 27th January, 1907). I presume that Shuster did not admit it to the Medjliss either, because he agreed with the view of the bank that the consent of Parliament was not necessary, or possibly because he wished to avoid publicity. , /op/- 'MF P COPY TO INDIA 1 9 FEB 1912 SECRETARY'S NS 6 J ! 151-329]CONFIDENTIAL.

So far Russian Minister has not, to my knowledge, moved in the matter with the Persian Government, but I know that he regards the contract, [ ? ] secured on the eve ) of Shuster’s dismissal and without the consent of Medjliss, as so much waste paper, } and I do not doubt that, unless he is instructed to the contrary, he will urge the Persian Government to declare it invalid. Bank’s last mint contract was revised by the Medjliss. I can see nothing in the law of jurispnadoifrce (see my*despatch No. .95 [of 13th June, 1911]) expressly empowering the treasurer-general to make contract of such importance without consent of the Medjliss, which was still sitting when contract was signed, and I am in some doubt how far you would wish me to support Imperial Bank, should it apply to me. I understand that the Imperial Bank consider the contract vital to the security of its note issue. (Repeated to St. Petersburgh.) |151—285]CONFIDKNTlAI. \ Sir G.

Manager of Imperial Bank of Persia told me yesterday that during November he had obtained from Shuster contract for import of minting silver for ten years. I informed Russian Minister of this yesterday. It was of course most,, unwelcome news to him, and 1 fear that the Russian Government may oppose the contract on the ground that it had not the sanction of the Medjliss. The manager did not tell me of the contract before because he thought that it would be awkward for me, but now that the treasury-general’s archives have been handed to Mornard the matter could not remain secret.
