Consequently, if this service were wholly ours, we should not antedate beyond say a convenient date somewhere near the date on which the application was made to us, say the first of that month or possibly the beginning of the quarter in which the application was made to us. In this particular case had it been entirely ours v/e should probably have agreed to the 1st July, 1944 but would have been unwilling to go beyond that and we could not have considered for a moment an antedate of 2 l/3rd years as proposed in the India Office letter. We trust that you will agree with the application of our general practice, which seems to us so eminently sound, to this case. If it would help we should be prepared to stretch our position a bit, though somewhat illogically^to the extent of agreeing to the 1st April, 1944 or even to the 1st January, 1944 but we should be very i»fespo^ed to go beyond that. aprtA * T /ynt mi.

As the first incumbent of the post was transferred there from the appointment of Political Officer on the Trucial Coast, leaving the latter post vacant, presumably it was assumed that he would enjoy the same emoluments, as appears to have been the case. The Government of India have now written suggesting that as there is no real connection between the posts of Political Officer on the Trucial Coast and Assistant Political Agent, Muscat, it would be more equitable if the special pay granted to the Assistant Political Agent, Muscat, were fixed with reference to the special pay granted to the Political Agent there. (A list of the emoluments attached to these posts is below). In the last sentence of their second paragraph, the Government of India mention 'the reasons for which a higher rate ! of special pay was originally sanctioned for the Political Agent, Muscat'. We do not appear to have any information in.this department about the grant of special pay to the Political Agent, Muscat; it may be that ; as the post is paid for by India alone the papers were not sent here. /ExpenditureEXT. 3016A4- The Secretary to the Treasury, Treasury Chamber^ London, S.W.l.

In August 1939 approved proposal by the Government of India and the Political Resident that in the event of war a Political Officer for the Truoial Coast should be appointed. It was agreed that the expenditure involved should be divisible between Imperial and Indian Revenues, in accordance with whatever general arrangement might be reached in regard to the allocation of wartime expenditure on the Arab Coast (see P.2. 43Wf/39^^ Sidt/ii) A 2. In March 19A2 the Government of India telegraphed that the establishment of the new air route along the south coast of Arabia was giving rise to numerous problems which required urgent handling on the spot. They had therefore arranged with the Political Resident, in anticipation of the Secretary of State's approval, to send the Political Officer, Trucial Coast ; temporarily to Salalah, the Sultan of Muscat's headquarters in Dhofar. There he would deal, under the Political Agent at Muscat, in particular with problems arising at Salalah and Masirah, where aerodromes were being built for the new route. The Government ox* India added that the period of his detachment from the Trucial Coast would depend on the progress in the establishment of the air route and of the aerodrome installations. After consulting the Air Ministry and the Department of the Foreign Office which deals with aviation questions, we approved this arrangement (Ext. 1615/42). ;(■ ? ) S UU* W* - C ' W '- (3&gt;. V i » A ' r 3. The Government of India's express letter below says that the Political Resident has reported that for various reasons it is necessary to fill both the post at Salalah and the post otLthe Trucial Coast (which lias its headquarters at Sharjah). The Government of India agree with the Political Resident, and are arranging to fill both posts in anticipation of formal sanction by the Secretary of State for the revival of the post on the Trucial Coast, now in abeyanc e. A* When dealing with the Government of India's proposal at Ext. 1615/42, we assumed that we were merely being asked to approve a temporary arrangement which would not involve the creation of a new post or the holding in abeyance of an existing one. Nor was it realised that any financial question might be involved. In fact, however, the arrangement has resulted in the creation of aLOCK A! ial care may b of this docurr new post of Assistant Political Agent at ihiscat, which the current iR edition of the I.P.S. List shows to have been held by Mr. G-.N. Jac] since May 26th 1942. The List also shows the post of Political Officer, Trucial Coast, as vacant. While the cost of the latter is, as described above, divisible between Imperial and Indian Revenues, the Muscat Agency is wholly financed by the G-overnment of India. If i therefore the G-ovemment of India bear the whole cost of the Salalah post, they should make no charge Zaft Imperial Revenues on account of the cost of the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, in respect of the period from May 26th 1942 to the date on which the new incumbent assuneS charge of that post. 5. Before we can sanction the co-existence of the two posts it seems necessary to make sure what arrangements the G-ovemment of India have in mind for financing the Salalah post. While, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, they probably are willing to bear the whole cost themselves, they may possibly ^ £ contemplate that the cost of this post, like that of the Sharjah ^ post, should be treated as special wartime expenditure. A If they,^ should have any such idea, we shall have to obtain the agreement of y the Foreign Office. If, however, the 3 r are prepared to bear the b whole cost, it appears that we could sanction their action without ^ ^ consulting the Foreign Office - there seems no need to ask their consent to the revival of the Sharjah post when they were never • asked to agree to its being held in abeyance. ^ r. 6.
