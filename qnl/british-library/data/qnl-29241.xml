MILITA RY ATTAC HE - TEHR AN INTELLIGENCE SUMMA RY (PERSI A.) No. 5 o f 194 8 POLITICAL 1. Cabi n et Changes On 9th March the following changes in Hakimi's cabinet \/ere announced:- General /Jimed /Jimadi. .... a. .. Mr. Nuri Esfandiari. Mr. /JLi Suhaili (F.0.150) Mr. Abdul Husain Hajir (P.0.50) Minister Minister Minister .Minister of Interior, for Foreign Affairs, without portfolio, without Portfolio. General iJimadi has held the post of Minister of the Interior before and is regarded as energetic and capable. Suhaili, who has been twice Prime Minister during his career, was recently acquitted on various onarges of corruption brought against him while Qavain was in power. The previously nominated Minister for Foreign Affuir?,Baqir Kazimi, never took up his appointment, but remained at Stockholm owing, it is believed, to illness. 2. The Go ve rnment Position The Cabinet changes, which are considerably less drastic than expected in some quarters, appear to have been fairly well received on the whole and can be regarded as having strengthened Hakirai's position to somu extent. It is, however, extremely doubtful whether his government will be able to remain in power much longer. Immediately after Hakimi had introduced the new members oi his cabinet to the Majlis, he was faced with two interpellations by deputies cl the Iran Democratic party, on account of home and foreign policy. Hakimi wil presumably have to reply to these interpellations soon after the re-assembly ol the Majlis on conclusion of the Persian New Year holidays now in progress. The transitory nature of Persian governments and lack of permanancy. in outlook in this country is well exemplified by a recent reference to Hakimi's cabinet in one of the Persian newspapers. After stating that Hakimi's position in the Majlis had improved a little of late, the paper went onto say thrt if things continued as they were it was not improbable that Hakimi would remain m office for a month or more. 3* Re-action to Foreign Events Interest in this country in recent foreign events continues to be keen, In particular, the 5 -power treaty, Truman's statement on conscription and the decision to eliminate communists from certain types of employment in the bnited Kingdom-have been fully reported in the local press, but without much comment. \yhile the attention to factual reports of these events indicate that their importance is not lost in this country, the unusual reticence in comment may be due to a feeling of nervousness engendered by recent events in Europe. A. Ministry of Labo ur On 20tn Marchjjp.jir, recently appointed to the cabinet as Minister without portfolio, was placed in charge of the Ministry of Labour. This Ministry, which is still awaiting the decision of the Majlis on^its continued existence, had been supervised since January this year by the Minister ot _ National Economy. The appointment of Hajir may help to strengthen the Ministry s position. MILITARY 5. Training of Tribal Chiefs The Persian C.G.S. recently told the Military Attache that he had /arranged....arrr.nged for each of the military divisions which had tribes in their areas to organise a course of training for tribal chiefs. These courses are of two '“'hionths duration and the training is intended to be directed mainly to demolitions and guerilla tactics including individual action against tanks. Information in support of this was recently received from H.M. Consul, Zahidan, who states that the Baluch tribal chiefs and notables have been instructed to select ten trusted followers each for 2 montns special military training in defence tactics. It is probable that the type of training v/ill vary somewhat according to the equipment available and the local conditions. Though H.M. Consul Zahidan attributes the reason for the training of Baluch tribes as being to counteract suspected intrigue by the Khan of Kalat, it is more probably part of a general scheme for turning the natural aptitude of the tribes for guerilla warfare to advantage in the defence of their country. Training of tribal chiefs at Resht was reported in para. 15 of M.A's Summary No.1 of 194-8. 6 . Ceremony at Officers * Club On 11th March there was a ceremony at the Officers' Club, Tehran, when H.I.M. the Shell unveiled a statue to his father, the late Reza Shah, and presented the order of Javid to the families of officers killed in action. 7. Per sian Navy By arrangement between the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company ana the Persian Naval authorities two Persian naval officers ha.ve been signed on a.s super numeraries on the Company's tanker 'British Pern' for the trip to Australia auid back. The object is to give the officers experience at sea,. ✓ 8 . C onscr ipt ion objection in Baluchistan H.M. Consul Zahidan reports that there is great general dissatisfaction in Khwash, Irashalir and Saqwan are as, in particular with regard to military conscription, and that a large number of Baluchis have crossed over to Kalat or Kharan to avoid this. INTERNAL SECURITY 9. Muhajirs H.M. Consul General at Tabriz states that arrests of muhajirs in Azerbaijan, which ceased in November, re-started towards tne end of January. It is probable, however, that this is at present on a small scale, for according to the Persian C.G.S. action regarding the arrest and screening of the remaining suspects, amounting to about twenty thousand, is held up owing to lack of funds. Baorabad Camp is still empty except for a small military guard, though it may again be usad la,ter on. 10. Khorasan Brigadier Mahin, the G.O.C. at Meshed, visited H.M. Consul General's staff last month and expressed anxiety regarding Soviet activities which he said ha,d increased recently. He also asserted that Tudeh party leaders were secretly returning to iChorasan and organising the party. 11 .

INDEXED j Clfr I948 l J MILITARY ATTACHE - TEHRAN INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY (PERSIA) No. 6 of 1948 6 th April, 1948. POLITICAL. 1• Persian note of 22nd March. On 22nd March the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the Soviet Embassy refuting charges against Persia made during a lecture in Moscow on 18th March, and by Soviet propaganda generally. The note denies that the Persian Government is pursuing an anti-Soviet policy or that Ha2±mi, the premier, is personally opposed to the Soviet Government. It also denies that the Americans will be given any oil concession in North Persia, and that the employment of foreign advisers means that the Government are surrendering Persian independoroo or making Persia a base for aggression against the U.S.S.R. The note states that Persian policy is based on the Charter of the United Nations and aims at the independence and soveereignty of Persia and at friendly relations with all oountries. In conclusion the note requests the cessation of spiteful and untruthful propaganda. This note was not published until after the public ation of the Soviet note of 24th March referred to in para 2 below. 24 Soviet note of 24th March. On 24th March the Soviet Ambassador delivered a further note to the Persian Government, relating to the Persian note of 4th February (see M.A*s Sumy: No.2 para 2.). The Soviet note begins by refuting the Persian statement that U.S. advisers do not occupy key posts nor have authority to intervene in the activities of the War Ministry or other military departments. In support it refers to the agreement of October 1947 with America, which defines the object of the American military mission as co-operation with the Persian War Minister, and to facts quoted in the previous Soviet note. The present Persian denials are compared with similar denials made in 1941 about the activities of foreign agents in Persia at that time. The note denies Soviet participation in the Azerbaijai rebellion, but claims that the Soviet Government has the right, under its own constitution, to give asylum to foreign refugees who are persecuted as a result of their defence of the interests of the labouring classes, of their activities in pursuit of knowledge or of their participation in a national liberation movement » The note also denies that refugees have received permission to form units for the invasion of Persia or that there exists on Soviet territory any clandestine radio operated by refugees. The note concludes by repeating that the American-Persian agreement is in conflict with good relations between Persia and the Soviet Union as provided for in the 1921 Treaty, and describes Persian allegations that the previous Soviet note was an intervention in Persian internal affairs as an attempt to evade responsibility for their policy which is not compatible with that treaty. It would appear from their repeated reference to the Persian-Soviet treaty of 1921 that the Soviet Union is attempting to create a situation in which, at a suitable time, it could at once send troops into Persia, without further preliminaries, to seal up an existing gap in its exterior defensive ring. 3* Persian reply. In their reply, handed to the Soviet Ambassador on 1st April, the Persians regret that the Soviet Government has not attached due importance to the previous Persian reply of 4th February, and in particular to the statement that Soviet concern in the matter of the U.S. military mission represents intervention in Persian internal affairs, especially since in Article 5 of the 1921 treaty the /Soviet. •* I X UP L 1948 l \ Soviet undertook to abstain from such intervention!. ' ‘i'he note scates that the Persian Government has nothing to add to its previous note regarding the American mission and repeats the charges of Soviet intervention in Azerbaijan* It points out that the refugees to whom the Soviet is giving asylum are common law criminals* ^The note concludes by referring to the Persian Government 5 s manifest efforts to safeguard friendship with the Soviet Union and repeats the assurances that the Government’s object is to strengthen relations between the two countries and to develop reciprocal understanding. It calls on the Soviet Government, on its side^ to show equal understanding and correctness in the execution of ibS engagements and to make every effort to safeguard Sotdet-Persian friendship* 4 * 7 year plan* The Oabinet has been considering the Naficy report on the 7 year plan and a bill to give it effect is being prepared for subn: ssion to the Majlis, it is expected, in the near.future* 5* Election of the Speaker. The I.hjlis sat on 4th April to elect the Speaker, 'MO deputies being present. At the first voting Sardar Pakhir Hekmat obtained 52 votes and Malek Madani 49. This did not give a majority taking into acco^mt all deputies present* The voting was taken twice more.

MILITARY. 6 * Tribal Training. OTConsul RESET reports that a short course is new being given on medical first aid to a number of young educated volunteers of the Talesh tribe. The instruction is for 3 hours daily in the military hospital at P.osht* 7* New Year promotions. A large number of promotions were announced at the Persian New Year. These included the promotion of the following Taj cz« Gone rale to :! 3epahbud ,, (Lieut-General) the highest rani: in the Persian Army:- Haji All RAZMARA (M.A.154) at present Chief of the General Staff.

Colonel Zelli, in command of the Persian Naval Station at Abadan, is promoted Vice-Admiral. There are also nearly 2000 more junior promotions •• Some dissatisfaction is said to have been caused by many of the promotions being due to influence rather than merit, but this is probably nothing unusual INTERNAL SECURITY. 8 « Azerbaijan. The situation in Azerbaijan continues to be quiet, H.I.M. the Shal recently paid a visit to Tabriz and was enthusiastically received. The Consul- General Tabriz, reports a certain amount of activity, mainly underground, on the part of the Azerbaijan Democrats and Muhajirs. Its chief manifestation at preseni is a v/hispering campaign complaining that money needed for the relief of the people in the province is being squandered on new public buildings in Tabriz. Of the 1,000 inmates of the Tabriz prison 800 are political prisoners. Duran, four*: /of. .-3- r [ok-E Jviltifejip/gaBaa r^) of the Vengeanoe Party, who was previously in charge of S la.briz, is reported to have been arrested, Representatives from each quarter of Tabriz wore recently summoned by the military authorities and asked to investigate and report on the location of the large quantity of arms $till ubgL^itendereS by the public* The Persian propaganda department in Atjaft Ao 1 -jm~prrj of reorganization. Since 1st March Tabriz wireless has broadcast, in addition to the daily news in Russian, French and English, news bulletins and talks daily in IHmple local Azerbaijani and three times weekly in Kurdish. These broadcasts are j signed to reply to the lies of the clandestine Azerbaijan Democrat wireless# 9* Khuzistan - Tudeh ac ti vity. ihere p.ppoars to have been some increase recently in the movements of Tudeh leaders to and from IQiuzistan. A leaflet, published by the Central Workers Union (Tudeh) was distributed in Abadan in March accusing the A.I.O.C. of trying to sabotage the workers movement by sponsoring new workers 1 organisations and thus ' creating dissension amongst the labour. A few d^ys later, it was alleged at a public meeting by an employee of the A.I.O.C. , who was at one time dismissed for subversive activity and later re-employed, that this leaflet had been issued by the A.I.O.C. themselves to effect a split among the labour. 1C. Kugalu tribes. Reference M.A’s Summary No.4, para 8 . One of the Tehran newspapers recently reported clashes between the Boir Ahmedi, perhaps the most truculent of the Kugalu tribes, and Persian Army forces. This was strongly denied officially by the. Persian General Staff. With the object of establishing effective control, according to the Persian C.G-.S. , small military garrisons have been established at about eight places east and north-east of Behbehan, including posts at Khairabad and Aru. A number of the Boir Ahmedi chiefs are assembled at Aru and the handing in of rifles by the tribe is proceeding satisfactory. The Persian C.G.S., however, does not attach as much importance to the aollection of rifles as to the extension of effective control over the tribes and the acknowledgement by them of government authority. With the object of impressing the tribes, certain demonstrations have been staged, including the firing of live ammunition. 11. Bakhtiari. Reference M.A 8 s Summary No.4 para 11 , According to infomation received from the Persian G.G-.S. a small military operation was carried out a few days ago with the object of capturing Abul Qasim. Four columns converged on Ardal m the early hours of 4th April intending to surround the place. On nearing Ardal two of the columns encountered some tribesmen and a few shots were exchanged, re milting in about half a dozen casualties. The warning thus given enabled Abul Qasin to escape into the mountains to the west of Ardal.' The operation has thus so far failed to achieve its object. COMMUNICATIONS. 12. Ports and railways. Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijan Railway and Lake Communications Department have made the port of Haiderabad serviceable again within the last few months. This port is situated at the south end of Lake Urmia. The Department has also repaired the railway from Tabriz to Sufian and Julfa. Three more locomotives have been brought into service. Passenger trains from Tehran now travel to Mianeh. 13* Uniforms for port employees.

I 6 16 INDEXED .-i POLITICAL. 1. Government vote of confidence. The debate on the interpellations of the government lasted for over a week. During the debate the Government was attacked on numerous points, notably on its alleged attempt to strangle the Press, on failing to maintain public security or to keep down the cost of living, on its foreign policy and on ; the questions of asserting the Persian claim to Bahrein and the revision of the 'A.I.O.C* concession. Avon the price of spinach came in for comment and a piece of bread was produced in the Majlis with criticism of its quality. Finally, on 26th April, the vote of confidence was taken, with the following result:- De put ie s pre sc nt 88 Votes for the Government 67 Votes against the Government 2 Abstainers 19 In spite of his good majority Hakimi is still strongly attacked by a large section of the Press, the situation being referred to by such phrases as the 'temporary stabilisation of a tottering government'. 2. The Majlis. The Majlis has been occupied during the period under review with the debate on the Government interpellations and has not therefore had very much time for other business. A proposal for revision of the press law was tabled and the bill for payment of one-twcLfth of the state budget was approved. . Some excitement was caused by the proposal of one of the deputies that the university should come within the jurisdiction of the Minister of Aduoation. When the latter, in speaking of the independence of the university, said it should be free from political influence.and that not even a given religion should be forced on university students, he was greeted with shouts and insults from some of the deputies and the Speaker was unable to control the House. It is hoped that the Majlis will now find time to give attention to the 7 -year plan. 3* Soviet Ambassador. The Soviet Ambassador called on the Persian Prime Minister on 18th April. Since the rejection of the proposed Soviet oil agreement Mr Sadtchikov has avoided personal contact with the Persian authorities and absented himself from two salaams. The nows of his visit, published in the press, not unnaturally, therefore, gave rise to some speculation as to its significance.The visit is believed to have been a friendly one. 4* Return of Qavam. Qavam-us—Saltoneh, the late Prime Minister, who has been away from Persia for the last four months, arrived in Tehran by air from France yesterday afternoon. He is reported to have stated, when the news of the indictment against him beorme known, (see M.A’s summary No*7 para 5 ), that he would return to clear his name. a large crowd of two or three thousand /people./10 - 2 - »&gt; s&gt;&lt;® people, including a number of deputies, assembled at the airfield to witness the arrival of Qavam and greeted him v/ith cheers. MILITARY. 5 * ^ Parohin explosive factory. The Persian Army explosive factory at Parchin, 25 miles south-east of Tehran, re-started the production of dynamite about 3 months ago. The nitro glycerine and dynamite plants of this factory had previously been closed for the last six years. About 35 tons of dynamite, according to the Commandant of the factory, have been produced since production was renewed. No cordite is at present being made though the plant for this, olosed during the war, still exists. Besides making powder for small arms ammunition for military use, this factory sells part of its alcohol and sulphuric acid production commercially. 6 . Military equipment from U.S.A . Reference M.A’s summary No.A para 7* The difficulty over the payment of transport and packing charges for the milmtary equipment which the U.S.A. is supplying to Persia has now been overcome, as the U.S.A. has agreed to advance the necessary sum for this purpose. It is expected that the part of the equipment now located in Europe will begin to arrive in Persia in about 3 months,time. That part which is to come from America will not arrive till later. 7* French Air Force visitors. 2-7 officers and N.O.Os of the French Air Force arrived in Tehran on 2nd May for a visit of a few days. They are staying as guests of the Persian Army in the Officers Club. INTERNAL SECURITY. 8 . Expulsion of gangsters from Tehre.n. Reference M.A’s summary No.7 para 9* A second party of gangsters, 58 in number, arrested in Tehran, has been deported to Bandar Abbas. The arrests in Tehran have caused some excitement in the Press and the Minister of the Interior found it necessary to issue a statement calling on the Press to abstain from publishing unfounded reports regarding the arrests and expulsions. Not unnaturally, the plan to expel these criminals from Tehran does not meet with approval from the places selected to receive the deportees and the Deputy for Bandar Abbas recently registered a protest in the Majlis. 9* Dismissal of railway employees. The Consul-General, Ahwaz, reports that about 100 employees of the railway in the south have recently been dismissed. It is known that there are a considerable number of Tudeh members employed on the railways in Persia and in this conn/4e«tion the Persian Chief of the General Staff recently told the M.A. that the General Staff had given the railway administration the names of a number of strong Tudeh supporters and advised their dismissal* A recent report in the Press stated that the Army was taking over control of the Persian State Railways, but the Persian C.G.S., questioned by the M.A. on this point, denied that there was any truth in it. It does not, however, appear unreasonable to suppose that some special measures, including possibly some degree of military control, may be under consideration to ensure the speedy and safe transport of the American military equipment when it reaches a Persian port.

A report current a few days ago that Fajm, the Finance Minister, had resigned is untrue* 2* Bill for creation of Senat e* A bill for the creation of a Senate, or Upper House, was presented by the Government to the Majlis on 9th May. The bill was referred to a Commission. The bill is linked with the organic law of the Constitution which provides . Senate though one has never, in fact, existed. The proposed Senate is to consist of 60 members and the bill lays down the qualifications necessary to bo eligi 1 as a member of the Senate. Of the 60 members, 30 are to be elected and 30 afo to be nominated by H.I.M. The Shah. Half the elected members and imlf the nominated members are to come from Tehran and the remainder from the provinces. After the creation of the Senate all legislation, with the exception of financial matters, must have the approval of both Houses. In oortain circumstances th Senate may vote the dissolution of the Majlis, when the Shah may or er n elections. As half the members of the Senate arc to be nominated by the Shoh the proposal obviously gives the Shah groat influence. The that the Majlis can be dissolved, however, may keep its members more on their toes an prevent the prevalent habit of absenteeism resulting in failure to form a quorum and consequent stoppage of all business in the i.ajlis. 3* The Majlis. The Minister of Finance submitted the bill for the 7 y°a^s plan to the Mallis on 3rd May. The bill was referred to a Commission which is to subnet p^posais as ?o haw the plan can bo carried out, a^to expedite matters this Commission is to sit 4 days a week in the Ministry of economy.. A bill authorise the revision of previous tax assessments made on certain incomes, also presented by the Finance Minister, was debated at length and aroused considera o opposition from some Majlis members. Apparently the bill is intended to enable the Government to recover income tax, payment of which has somehow been evaded. The bill was referred to a Commission. On 14th May the Majlis reactc violently against Wallace’s speech, Dr Abdeh attacking him in strong toms and referring to him as an unscrupulous adventurer. Later Dr Abdoh was himself attacked by another Majlis member who called him an American spy. ^t this, excitement was such that the Speaker was unable to keep order. Questions asked in the Majlis included one on 16th May about the former Government’s action on the A.I.O.G, question. Hajir, who was Minister of Finance in Qayam’s government and is also a member of the present one, said that, as Finance Minister, when - question of the revision of the A.I.O.C. concession had been brought up, he had—9*9 W y -2- bogun negotiations with the Company’s representative.

It is not the policy of t^ military authorities to rush matters and so provoke trouble* They are content, therefore, with a fairly slow rate of collection of arms so long as the process is continuous* 9* Prison riot* A riot broke out in the Kassr prison at Tehran on 8 th May* Led by a famous gangster named Farhad a number of the prisoners disarmed the guards and made a bid to escape. The timely arrival of troops of the 2nd Persian Division, however, soon brought matters under control. 15 persons are reported by the Press to have been wounded during the riot* 10. Foreigners in Khuzistan* Reference M.A’s summary No *5 para 9* The Frontier Commissioner at Khorramshahr received instructions a few weeks ago to enforce the order for the removal of foreigners not in the employ of the A.I.O.C. The order applies to foreigners only in frontier areas of Khuzistan i*e. Abadan and Khorramshahr. The Governor-General of the province, however, who is in favour of the removal of undesirables only, has issued strict instructions that no one is to be compelled to move without his written approval. There appears, therefore, to be a struggle between the military and civil authorities in regard to this question. At present the Governor-General is winning# ECONOMIC* 11 # Broad shortage - BUSHIRE. A serious shortage of bread recently occurred in Bushire mainly due, it is said, to smuggling of grain which is prevalent in the South* By order of the Government wheat and rice were despatched to Bushire from Shiraz and General Ahmadi, the Minister of Interior, went by air to Bushire on May to investigate the situation for himself. Apparently as a result of this visit the price of wheat in Bushire has fallen and General Ahnadi told the M.A* that the situation there has now considerably improved. 12# Coal.

The Goycmment* Hakirai*s Governr^nt is thour^t by many to be on its last le^s. An allianoe, probably of a temporary nature, was formed a few days ago between three parties in tnc Ilajlis — namely the Democrat, l^elli and Ittifaq fractions, numbering about 50 deputies. Representatives are believed to have called on the Prime Minister last week and suggested to him that he resign as ho had lost his majority in the Majlis* On 30th May representatives of this coalition are reported to have been given an audience by the Shah. There is no certain indication of liakimi’s successor if, as seems probable, he is forced to resign. The names of Hajir and Soheili, both members of tho present Government, are, however, mentioned in this respeot* 2* Palestine. The Press has recently devoted much increased attention to Palestine, and America has been much criticised for its attitude to this question. On 21st - fy a demonstration was held in the Masjid Sliah to protest against the action of tne Jews in Pale seine. At this demonstration, which was attended by a very large crowd, a sLatemenw issued by Kasnani, a well Renown cleric, was read through a loud speaker. He said the demonstration was only directed against Palestine Jews and that Persian Jews need have no fear. An account was opened for funds for one Arab volunteers now fighting in Palestine* Another prominent cleric, Ayatullah Behbehani, sent a telegram to the Pope asldng him to prevent the Christian nations from helping the Jews. On 28th May the Bsrsian Foreign Minister made a speech in the Majlis expressing sympathy with the Arabs now fighting in Palestine. On another occasion a deputy declared himself ready to go and fight against the Jews. On 2yth lay a meeting of the i .oslem Union was held as a token of sympathy with the Palestine Arabs, the meeting being attended by the Ministers of Iraq, Arabia, Syria, Lebanon and a representative of the Pakist an Embassy. In spite oi those meetings, the agitation in the press and some excitement in the Majlis, it is not considered there is widespread genuine strong feeling on the Palestine question in this country. ^ 3* The Majlis# On 22nd May the bill for one-twelfth of the budget was finally approved with only one amendment after M5 had originally b en proposed* This continued existence on a month to month basis as regards authority for expenditure is obviously most unsatisfactory. On 25th May the Majlis was criticised for holding up the bill for restriction of the activities of foreign merchants* This bill, if approved, would affect India, Iraq and America most, though there are also several British trading companies in Persia. There is considerable opposition to the bill, which has been modified more than once, and it has hung fire for some tune. When it is debated the Majlis frequently loses its quorum. The Government was attacked in the lajlis for its decree by which a heavy tax on land is to be levied. It was maintained that such a decree required Majlis approval and a deputy threatened to bring a criminal charge against the Minister of Finance unless the decree was withdrawn. The Commission appointed to study the bill for the /creation. .oreation of a Senate (ivUA 1 s sunnary No*9 para 2) approved the first 5 articles of the bill # and the Cownission on the 7 years plan also approved certain articles* Dr IKftari, a Najlis deputy, addressed a letter recently to the Minister of Foreign Affu rs alle^in:; that the provisions of the 1937 Treaty with Iraq for joint control of the Shatt-cl-Arab were not boin 3 carried out. military* 4* Tribal training. The G-.O.C. Pars is reported to have started a new military training school in Shiraz for giving military training to selected youths from the tribes. This is in conformity with the policy outlined to the H.A. by the Gidef of the General Staff Wo months ago - see Summary No *5 para 5* Tlie courses at Sliiraz are of the standard duration of 2 months and the first course of 20 tribesmen was completed early in May. The training is said to be unwelcome to the Qasligai leaders who appear to think there may be some hidden motive behind it. 3* Soviet frontier. The incident reported in I'.A*s summary No.9 para 6 is believed to be the only occasion this year when an attempt has been made to cross into Azerbaijan from Soviet -’territory in any numbers. According to the C.O.C. Eastern Azerbaijan, however, previous attempts on a small scale have been made to tost the Persian frontier defences, and during the past 8 months about 20 persons, mostly Caucasians, have been picked up on or near the Soviet frontier, in same oases after a skirmish. It appears therefore that some minor infiltration is being attempted. The Persian C.G*S. admits that persons night cross the frontier singly or in parties of 2 or 3 without detection, but considers that no bigger parties could get through without the loiowledge of the Persian forces in Azerbaijan. 6 . Changs of dispositions in Azerbaijan. .According to the Persian C.G.S. there is some movement at this time of t]xj year amongst the tribes bordering tho Kokran desert in north-east Azerbaijan into the ooolor mountainous area further south. To fill the gap created by this movement some regular troops, from Tabriz and Ardebil, have recently been moved up nearer the frontier in the Mokran district. The exact location and strength of those troops were not stated, but they are believed to consist of one battalion from eaoh of the two garrisons mentioned above. INTi&amp;HAL SECURITY. 7« Azerbaijan. The general situation in Azerbaijan remains quiet, at any rate outwardly. There has recently been a movement among Deputies representing Azerbaijan to preveitt further removal of suspect elements from Azerbaijan to other parts of tho country. Azerbaijan deputies were recently received in audience by the Shall and asked to put an end to these population transfers and to extend an amnesty to those accused of political offences. H.l*.Consul-General at Tabriz reports that orders have been issued by the Governor-General, on tho recommendation of the Director of the Department of Justice, for the formation in Rezaieh, under the chairmanship of the G.O.C., of a oomiittoe to look into the question of political prisoners awaiting trial. It is said to be a source of some exasperation to many of the Azerbaijanis that the war time Soviet consulates of Ardebil, M&amp;ku and Rezaieh continue to exist. 8 , Khuzistan. II#M.Consul-General at Ahwaz reports that although all is quiet on the surface in Khuzistan there are the makings of trouble in plenty.

The diversion of the waters of this river in Afghanistan, which led to grave water shortage for orops in Seistan until heavy r-in; rains earlier this year temporarily relieved the situation, may well load to migration of many inhabitants from Scistan to Afghanistan ovTing to the drying up of their land* One newspaper recently went so far as to advocate a resftrt to arms to protect what it toms the country*s rights on this question* It was notioc- ablo that members of the Persian government and Majlis absented themselves from a reception given in Tehran last week by the Afghan Minister to celebrate Afghan Independence Day. 1 6 * Soviet - Persian trade agreement* Discussions have been taking place in Tehran recently on the subject of a trade agreement between the Soviet Union and Persia* It is believed to be a renewal of an existing barter agreement with, perhaps, certain modifications, rather than a completely now agreement, but details are not at present known. 17* Plant for Isfahan mills* Being unable to obtain Bidsal engines from Britain, 8 of the textile mills in Isfahan have ordered from the Skoda works a total of 10 such engines between 120 and JOQ horsepower* It is believed that delivery in 4 or 5 months has boon promised* MISGELLAKBQUS* 18* Jakistan Ambassador* Ghazanfar Ali Khan, Minister for refugees in the Pakistan cabinet, has boon appointed Pakistan's first Ambassador to Persia.

MILITARY ATTACKS - TEHRAN INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY feERSU) No»12 of 1948 POLITICAL* 1 1 Government vote of oonfiden«e. Disorderly scenes tcrurred in the Majlis and there were shouts 'arraign him for murder' (a referenoe to the troops firing on the orowd during a repent demonstration against Hajir) from the visitors gallery when Hajir, the new Prime Ministe3P| presented his cabinet to the Majlis on 22nd June. There were similar scenes during the debate on the government programme on 24th June and rowdy elements from the visitors gallery were turned out and arrested. During the course Of the debate a deputy referred to the cultural societies and said the Anglo- Persian Institute, and the Russian and American Cultural Societies, had been turned into homes for spies and should be closed. Several speakers strongly attacked the Prime Minister. In spite of these attacks, the scenes of disorder and the many demonstrations against Hajir during the previous two weeks, when the vote was taken on conclusion of the debate the Government was accorded the confidence of the Majlis by an excellent majority, there being 88 votes for the government and only 6 against. This strong backing would appear to show that the Majlis intend to give Hajir a chance, but there are several different parties in the Majlis and deputies of widely differing views, and Hajir is not likely to find it an easy task to retain this good initial majority. 2. Government programme. The 12 points of the government programme presented to the Majlis, and on which the vote of confidence was obtained, are given at appendix 'A'. Although the question of Bahrein and the revision of the A.I.O.C. conoession are not specifically mentioned in the programme, Hajir stated in a Press interview that he intended to pursue these two matters. Hajir has also stated that he intends to put the Labour Law through the Majlis as soon as possible and to take the initiative in improving agricultur 1 editions. As regards foreign policy, he has said that he would take what measu - ; were possible to prevent further incidents on the Russian frontier and would try to improve relations by establishing early contact with the Russian Embassy in order to propose the resumption of commercial negotiations. Some action in regard to the Government programme appears to have taken pla#o already* The Labour Law is said to be ready for submission to the Majlis* Certain restrictions have already been placed on the sale of alcohol, and the Budget, in which Hajir has been interesting himself, is believed at last to be ready to be presented to the Majlis* Steps for the reorganisation of the Ministries have also been initiated. A Commission presided over by the Prime Minister has been studying ways for reducing the cost of living. 3* The Majlis. Since giving the new government its vote of confidenoe the Majlis has done little of importanoe and sessions have been poorly attended* The Senate Bill has been discussed by the relevant commission and certain articles approved, and the oommission deliberating the 7 year plan has also made some process. The Labour Law and the State Budget are due to come before the Majlis in the near future* On 6th July the Majlis approved by a large majority a bill authorising the Government to accept membership of U.N.E.S.C.O. The Ministry of Health Commission has approved a bill for the prohibition of poppy cultivation in Persia and this bill will shortly go before the Majlis*During the visit of General iUinadi (Minister of Interior in the last Povernnent) to Shiraz and Bushire in connection with the grain shortage reporwJd in para 11 of M.A’s sunnary No#9, Adniral Zolli, connanding the Persian Navy at Abadan, was sunnored by the Minister and given certain instruotions designed to prevent srnu ig# The BCrsian gunboat 'Shahrukh' 1 , oonnanded by Colonel Mushkni Nafas, lr r r ince arrived at Bushire and is stationed off the ©ustons jetty# It makes occasional sorties up and down the coast to intercept suspected craft# INTERNAL SECURITY# 10# Antj»«Jowish pamphlet# The following is a translation of a printed pamphlet sold in the streets of Tehran on 2nd July:- 'The Bahais and the Jews are plotting against Islam# For some u years a band of thieves, calling themselves the representatives of the nation, have brought into power Prime Ministers more traitorous than themselves.

MILITARY. 7* Ope ration agai n st Javanrudi tribe. Military action has recently been necessitated against the Jayanru&amp;i tribe which inhabits an area to the W.N.W. of Kermanshah between ar, xoau n .rmanshah - Khaniqin and the road Kermanshah- RawanEir-Qichlcq, About a year ago when arms were ocllooted from most oi tu.&gt; other tribes in the Kermanshah area the Javanrudi were permitted to retain aims for a further year. On conclusion of the year s srtro, hov/ever, they not only refused to hand in their aims but took toll fror. tra^llors on the road between Rawansir and the Iraqi- Persian frontier, ending up by kidnapping a Persian Aimy Sergeant and adopting the attitude that ho had no right to be there as military authority did not extend into their tribal area. They were also believea be be assisting in the smuggling of grain across the frontier into Iraq^ Accordingly, about throe weeks ago the commander of the Kermanshaii garrison, Colonel Pouladvand, despatched two military coiunns fron i^r-unshah, one to the area of Rawansir, and tho other father 1,0 south-west. At the sane time airoraft were sent over the area wx+n ioaflots to persuade the tribal loaders to oorae to heel. There was sun^feai- on the part of the nilitary authorities that, as soon as tie ooxurms attempted to close in on the Ja--anrudi, they into Iraq as haa ’ boon toe™ to have dona • no ° 1 ? ;)00t of Preventing this tho nilitary commander “ co - o porr. : xon of one of the other neighbouring tribes to tb o Passage ot tho Javanrudi to the north-west.

The o vil and military authorities in Azerbaijan look on this measure with dismay. It v/oim.^ appear that if it is approved, all or most of the persons deported iron the province to the south and elsewhere will soon be at liberty to return to Azerbaijan. This, the local authorities consider, nay well undo their by no means unsuccessful efforts of the last two years to bring peaco an 1 security to the province. 12. Khuzistan . There is little of particular interest to report from this province. The Governor-General continues to keep a watchful eye for signs of Tudch activity and at Idiorrrjr.shahr there is a Committee, under Admiral Zelli, of which the Governors oi ^badan and Khorranchahr are members, which meets periodically to discuss Tudch activities and to decide on necessary measures to be taken to combat them. There were rumours that a strike night be staged on 14th July to coincide with the anniversary of the big A.I.O.C. strike of 194-6, but no strike in fact occurred# It is reported that the number of meetings, ^nd the attendance at the meetings, of the Central Union of Oil Workers has dropped in recent weeks. 13* Bakhtiari .

A large ©rowd gave the Shah an enthusiastic welcome as he drove to his summer palaoe. Reaction in this country to the Shah’s visit has on the whole been very good* 2* Interpellation of thr G- ovor nment* The debate on the interpellation of the Government by Iskandari was opened on 21st August. Iskandari accused the Prime Minister of having violated the con^tl ution and of setting up a police government.

Continuing his spooch the following day he then raised the questions of the sovereignty Bahrein and the revision of the A.I.O.C. concession* The next day Mr Ardalan, v/ho had also interpellated the Government, began a long speech in which his main err 'i 'ism was on account of the recent Government decree on the foreign exchange rate. In the course of replies by various Ministers for the Government the Foreign Minister said that the Persian Government would always consider Bahrein to to an integral part of Persia. The Prime Minister told the House that the A.I.O.C* question was actually now under discussion* Votes on the interpellations, which were treated together, were then called for and resulted in a big majority in favour of the Government, there being 93 votes for the Government and only 8 against. 3* The Budget* On 24th August a bill was passed authorising the payment of a further l/l2th of the budget* The bill included an amendment of the Prime Minister to allow for the employment of certain foreign experts to advise the Government on legal, financial and technical matters in connection with the development of the natural resources of the country* These exports are expooLed to be used, amongst other things, to assist the Persian Government in their negotiations with the A.I.O.C.

IHLITARY. Military equipment fro m TT.3. A. The equipment from tho U.S.A. has not yet begun to arrive in Persia, and certain details still remain to be settled between tho American and.Persian Governments. It was originally intended that part of the equipment would be supplied from Germany, but it now appears that little other than aircraft, will be provided from there. 6* Russian frontier. ^ ^ , According to the Persian C.G.S. the situation on the Perso- Russian frontier continues to be quiet, apart from the shooting of a Persian civilian.on the Persian side of the frontier by a Soviet sentry from the Soviet side. From 'nine to time men who have crossed the frontier from Russia are picked up singly. The C.G.S. said that last week an armed deserter from the Soviet Army was taken on the Azerbaijan frontier, but as yet no useful information has boon obt' inod from him.

The new bill v/as finally approved after a somewhat frank criti«ism of some of the Deputies by ^ ^ ^ n ^®' fcGr himself which resulted in an uproar and even an effort to pull him down from the platform. The amnesty does not include those guilty oi murder or robbery, or those who held ministerial rank in Poshovari's government. Following the passage of the bill orders were quickly given by t c various Ministers concerned to release immediately those to whom the amnesty applies and wh&lt;? are now in prison or otherwise •onfinod*, and a considerable? 4 number of political prisoners have already been released.

The C.G.S. said that a proposal was also under consideration to hold on Kharg island Soviet deserters and others who had illegally crossed into Persia from Soviet territory. On an average about two a wook of such persons are apprehended by the Persian authorities and their disposal is presenting some difficulty. 9» SottrsQ for tribal chiefs. A course of about 2 wooks duration for tribal chiefs was •OjagJjjdQd in Tehran on 22nd September. The C.G.S. said that about 300 fbiQfs attended this course which was organised by the Army with the main of shev/ing and explaining to the tribal loaders sor^thing of the system of government of the country, and the organisation of the Amy. It is, however, not improbable that the approach of the elections had some bearing on the decision to invite the chiefs to visit Tehran. Some tritioisn has been voiced both in the Majlis and Press against this visit of the chiefs, andtho General Staff was attacked for 'strengthening feudalism by giving training to the tribesmen'. In fact, the course took the form of visits and demonstrations rather than tactical training, though tho latter is still being organised in divisional areas. During their visit the Chiefs were conducted round tho rifle factory in Tehran and the arsenal at * Sultanatabad, besides v/atching the manoeuvres of the Central Garrison. In addition they visited the Majlis and wore given lectures on the organisation of the Central Govornment, and tho relations between the Army and the tribes* . oonsiderablo number of the Chiefs wore granted audiences by H.I.M.

Legislation is virtually at a standstill. At the back of this stagnation is the case of Qavam-es-iDultaneh,and until this is settled, it is unlikely that any positive action will be taken by the Majlis* The departure of the Shah and many of the Ministers and Deputies to G-urgan for the horse races last week still further held up business* 2* The Budget* * Very little progress has been made in the Majlis with the Budget* The Prime Minister has tried, by meetings and discussions outside the Majlis with party leaders and various deputies, to obtain some agreement to facilitate the passing of the budget, but ho appears to have met with no appreciable results Though it was agreed that the Majlis would hold extra sessions with the object of hastening proceedings, this has in practice had little or no effect as there has usually been too few deputies to form the necessary quorum* A proposal by Taqhizadeh to reduce the budget of the department of propaganda by 10 million rials from a total of 13 million rials was passed in the Majlis* Though some reduction in this department was probably desirable, ohis big cut would make it impossible to continue to run Tehran radio and will obviously have to bo reconsidered* Another proposal to reduce the budget of the Ministry of Labour was rejected as was one for a token reduction in the budget of the Ministry of War. Although a suggostioi to throw out the whole budget was rejected, the prospects of the budget being passed in the immediate future do not appear very bright* 3* Qavsqn* At the end of September the Judicial Committee of the Majlis acquitted Qavam-es-SuLfcaneh, ex-Prime Minister, of the charges of corruption brought against him. The report of this Committee was read out in the Majlis on 5th October* One of the deputies objeoted to this report and insisted on reading out at length the dossier of the case which he said the Comittee had not properly examined* The object of reading the dossier appears to be to delay matters in The hope that a new Committee nay ultimately be made to re examine the case. Before Qavam is finally freed of the charges he must be acquitted by the Majlis. 4* Election of Spe ak-r&gt; On 6th October, the tern of office of the Speaker of the Majlis having expired, voting took place for election of a new Speaker.

Though Hajir twice obtained a vote of confidence in the Majlis during his last month of office , he resigned with all his Qabinet on 6th Ifovember# It appears that after obtaining a vote of confidence on 4th November, on conclusion of the debate on Azad’s interpellation of the Government, Hajir conferred with representatives of the various fractions to discover whether they would support his programme of legislation# Receiving an unfavourable impression, the Prime I'inister came to the conclusion that he could make little progress and decided to resign# The Press had been vociferous in its attacks on Hajir recently and there was much reference to dictatorship, suppression of liberty, the gap between the people and the Crown and the poverty of the masses# But the Press of this country is notoriously irresponsible and appears to abuse every Government as a matter of habits The Majlis, too, was undoubtedly obstructive during Hajir's term of office# Nevertheless, if Hajir had been stronger and had taken less cconsel of nis fears, he mi^it have achieved considerably more than he dido He is, unfortunately, a man lacking in personal prestige and this seems to havo proved a considerable handicap to him, too much importance, perhaps, being attached to it in this country# 2# The new Government# After his acceptance of Hajir's resignation, the Shah in urging the Majlis to lose no time in selecting a successor, intimated that he did not wish to influence the free choice of the Deputies. In spite of this, when, on 9th November Muhammad Sa'od (p#0#134) received the royal approval as Prime Minister in succession to Hajir, tte Democrat and Union parties in the Majlis and certain sections of the Press protested against the alleged unconstitutional procedure adopted by the Shah in nominating the Prime Minister* At a private session of the Majlis about deputies declared their support of Sa’od, who then took almost a week to foxm his cabinet# !Uie now cabinet, announced on 16th November, is as shewn below:- Prime Minister Foreign Minister Minister of War Minister of Interior Minister of Finance Minister of Agriculture Muhammad Sa'ed (F.0#134) All Asghar HIKMAT (F.0.54) General Amir AHMADI The Prime Minister Abbas Quli GULSHAYAN Dr MUQBEL Minister of National Economy Ghulan Hussein ASHRAFI Minister of Justice Minister of Education Mini s tor of Health Sayid Luhsin SADR (FO 132) Muhammad SAJJADI (F.0.135) - Dr Amir ALAM /frlinister of Communications. • • 1• 4 .

During the course of his speech he made a violent attack on the railway administration, which ho said had squandered its profits on luxuries for the Director, and accused the Prime Minister of being the tool of the British, whose policy in Persia Azad attacked* He compared the royalties received under the A*I*0*C» concession unfavourably with those granted to the Sheikh of Bahrein by an American Company* He also accused Hajir of raising the rate of sterling to pleas© the British Government* In the course of a very adequate reply the Prime Minister said the right of interpellating the Government had become an abuse in the hands of private members who used it to obstruct business* The subseqxxsnt vote on the debate gave Hajir a good majority of 67 votes in his favour and only 8 votes against him, with 12 abstentions* Azad’s interpellation has taken up much of the time of the Majlis during the last few weeks and little has been achieved. Some attention was given to the earthquake in Khorassan but a motion to appropriate the sequestered funds of the Democrat party for the relief of the victims of the earthquake was rejected* The Telephone Company came in for some criticism, but a proposal to abrogate its concession was rejected* At The Budget* No further progress has been made with the annual budget and it has again been necessary to pass the provisional one-twelfth for the month in order that civil servants may be paid, and to prevent affairs being brou^xt entirely to a standstill* During the last week of October there was •onsiderable argument on the several supplementary clauses which were appended to the bill for the ono-tv/elfth budget* A clause allotting 4 million rials for the relief of victims of the earthquake was approved, as was one providing for increases in the pay of civil servants to meet the cost of living* A clause providing for 2 million pounds sterling for the purchase of munitions was rejected* 5* Decree against students* Dy a decree of the Ministry of Education, issued in October, University students are forbidden from taking part in politics and have to si#i a promise to refrain from political activity* This decree has been denounced in the Press as another attempt by the ruling class to impose dictatorship* On 3rd November the students of Tehran University held a • V* l -4 . ‘ * . . v\ . /meeting&gt;*• neoting of protest and backed by the Press, they staged a short strife) A tom ya later.

Early in the month some shots wore exchanged between frontier troops in the northeast corner of Azerbaijan where the frontier runs in a straight line across the Moghan steppe botwoon Hassan Khanlu, on the Araxos river, and Belyasuvar. The frontier lino la 0 l° ai, ly demarcated on the ground. The second incident occurred on the ; jast of the Caspian Sea and north of Curgan where the ^trex river forms tho frontier. Near its mouth the river follows several courses and it is possible to argue as to which bed of the river in fact forms the frontier# Russian patrols advanced to the Persian villages of Tazehabad (near the •oast) Neftilja and Behram Tepe (not marked on the map, but believed to lie about 8 miles east of Tazehabad). The Russians have sin«o withdrawn and the Persians have established 3 military posts sloso to what they 90 x^ eider to be the correct frontier. At Neftilja, as its name suggests, there may he oil, and according to the Persian C.G.S. oil can some tines be observed mixed with surface water in that area. The third frontier incident took place towards the end of October, on tho southern side of the salient fonaed by Russian territory into Persia about 2 »j 0 miles N.N.W. of ^irdobil. The Persians have two frontier posts in this area and were in tho habit of sending patrols to the top of a hill which they regard as Persian territory* and which overlooks a considerable area on the Russian sido of tho frontier* Tho nearby Russian post apparently objected to the ifcrsian patrol looking down on then and opened fire. The fire was returned, and one Persian and &gt;*n one Russian were killed. Later Shah Savan tribesmen cane up to assist the Persian garrison and more shots were exchanged, the Russians in the meantioo a hil1 ° n . tho - pcrsian 3idc of th ^ frontier. A note of protest waa lodged with the Soviet Embassy and publicity was given to the incident in the Persian Press. According to the Persian C.G.S. , the Russians have since withdrawn to their normal posts and the situation is now quiet, /.bout 16 years ago, during Roza Shah’s reign, the Russians attacked a Persian military post in the same area and demolished a small fort which Reza Shah had constructed right on the frontier. 7* Persian iiir Forx?. a ooremon- al was held by the Persian Air Force in the presence of H.I.M.

Under the concession the Imperial Bank was given equal treatment with the National Bank of Persia and had certain tax exemptions. few months ago the Governor of the National Bank submitted a new draft banking law to the Council of Ministers, the provisions of which are so disadvantageous to foreign banks that the Imperial Bank would probably not consider it worth while operating in this country if the law were passed. It is hoped, however, that some revision of the draft nay be made^to ensure more reasonable treatment for foreign banks operating in MISCELLANEOUS. 19* Russian Ambass ado r’s return.

In very wet weather this might become difficult. ECONOMIC. 9* Bread situation. There has recently been considerable concern regarding the wheat situation in the country and the price of bread rose in Tehran. In the Majlis the new M’.r.istor of Finance confessed to there having been mismanage ment in the collection of wheat but said there was no cause for anxiety, and that arrangements were being made for the purchase of a .ju&amp;ntity of wheat from abroad. In fact an agreement has been reached for 24,000 tons of wheat and 10,0C3 tors of flour to be imported from Australia. In Tehran the Prime Minister made a personal inspection of some of the bakeries, , and several r.ow ones rre to be opened* A shortage of bread again occurred in S-mear recently, resulting in some agitation and an attack on the Gendarmerie offices. The recent widespread rain, which improves the prospects of next ye.a ; s harvest, has already result-.d in some release of wheat from the stocks of those hoarding grain against a bad harvest next year, and the ger. ral situation in the country now scons likely to improve. MISCELLANEOUS. 1f. Royal divorc e. The divorce of h,!,M The Shah from Queen Fawzieh, sister of the King of Egypt, was anno meed on 19 th November.

MILITARY ATTAGHiil - TEHRAN SlMiARY (PERSIA) No*4^ of 19^8 i ^ Pol( I 4 v.- 1» Government vote of confidence. The debate on the Government programme which began on 22nd November continued until 8th December when the Government obtained a vote of confidence with 56 votes in its favour, 1 against and 38 abstentions* This is generally considered scarcely to constitute a proper working majority and does not promise well for the future of the Government* A proposal made a few sessions earlier to bring the debate to an end was defeated when put to the vote, and the debate dragged on. During its course the Prime Minister was called on to take im;mediate steps to restore Persian sovereignty over Bahrein and it was suggested that, if diplomatic approach failed to bring about any result, the Persian Arn\y be used to f: secure the island* A later speaker strongly criticised the policy of neutrality followed by successive governments in their foreign affairs and i said it had resulted in no benefit to the country* He demanded that Periia • join the bloc with which its interests really lay* The next speaker | disagreed with this view, but said he was opposed to the grant of | concessions to any foreign power, and objected to the renewal of the concession to the Imperial Bank, These utterances should be regarded j more as the irresponsible thoughts of individual Majlis members than as any organised plan directed against foreign, or in particular British, interests in Persia* Winding up the debate the Prime Minister said his government would do everything possible to implement the Y-yoc.r plan in order to raise the standard of living and provide work for the people* 2^ Cabinet changes. Several changes in the Cabinet have already been made, following the resignations reported in para 1 of M.A*s Summary No.18, and criticism of some of the appointments during the Majlis debate. Muhammad Sajjadi, originally appointed to the post of Minister of Education in Sa’ed’s Cabinet has been changed to the portfolio of Cummunications in place of Dr Iqbal who replaces Dr Alam in the Ministry of Health. Abdul Hamid Zanganeh becomes Minister of Education In place of Sajjadi* The post of Minister of Justice has not been filled as thcr Prime Minister’s choioe refused it* Pending the appointment of a Minister of the Interior the Prime Minister will himself hold the post, assisted by Dr Iqbal. 3• Proposal to revise I ajlis status. On 7th December a proposal was tabled with double urgency by several deputies for a revision of the Majlis rules of prooedure. The proposal includes a reduction in the number of votes required to constitute a quorum, and a time limit for speeches. In view of the length of several of the speeches in the recent debate, and the numocr of times that voting cannot take place owing to the lack of a quorum, these proposals appear to have sound reason behind them* Accusations that the proposal will rob the opposition of its traditional rights and that the Constitution is being destroyed have, however-, been made, and certain sections of the Press are against it. Voting on the proposal has not yet taken place, as after debating it, the JM.jlis lost its quorum before votes could be taken-*urn -2- 4« The Press. Attacks in the Press on the ruling class have been increasingly bitter of late and one paper suggested that a wholesale purge is what the nation needs* In conjunction with these attacks there has been strongly '^■orded criticism of the courtiers surrounding the Shah, it being suggested that they exercise undesirable influence on him. Criticism of the Majlis also continues* One of the right wing papers last week openly urged Persia to abandon neutrality and declare its opposition to communism as being incompatible with the religion and beliefs of the country* The Tudch party organ however continues to impute all Persia’s misfortunes to the designs of the Anglo-Saxon bloc, and another left wing paper said that if war comes America cannot help Persia in time, and she should therefore consolidate her friendship with Russia. MILITARY. Military Review. On 12th December military reviews wore held in most of the ki.fjO 31, garrison towns of Persia in commemoration of the successful conclusion of the Army’s operations in Azerbaijan two years ago* This date has now come to be adopted more or less as ’Amy day’. In Tehran a review of all troops of the Central Garrison, as well as the Military Academy and pre-cadet school, and contingents of the Police, Gendarmerie, air Force and Navy, was held before H.I.M.The Shah. Members of the Diplomatic Corps and Service Attaches were invited to attend the review, but no Soviet representatives were observed to be present* The review took the same form as last year, the march past of troops lasting about 2 hours* Unlike last year arrangements for the seating of invited guests and for the.control of the crowd were good, though in the event, perhaps owing to the cold andcloudy weather, the crowd was far smaller than last year. The march past was considprably better than last year and in the case of a number of units v/as definitely good. The turn out of vehicles and guns v/as certainly an improvement on last year. No new equipment v/as in evidencewith the exception of some jeeps recently arrived from the U.S.A. The contingent of the Central Military Police v/as stronger than last year, there being nine companies on foot, each about 100 strong, one company in jeeps, and two or possibly three, in lorries. Their total strength v/as about 150^. They were smartly turned out and those on foo J ? marched well. A number of Tehran nev/spapers took the opportunity to attack the Amy, perhaps out of fear of its influence again becoming too , great. 6* Persian Military Academy. The length of the course at the Persi?.n Military Academy has recently been increased from 2 years to 3 years. Cadets will be - commissioned at the end of the second year but will remain as 2nd Lieutenants at the Academy for another year. Whereas the first two years will be devoted mainly to academic military instruction, during the third year it is intended that the young officer shall, as far as possible, actually carry out the duties of an oificer and receive instruction in the command and administration of a platoon or equivalent sub-unit. In this way it is hoped that in future young officers will join their active units fit in every way to assume the command they are given. The lengthening of the course means that the active part of the Army will lose one year’s output of officers of whom there is already a considerable shortage. In fact, the actual strength of officers in the Persian Army at the present time is only about of establishment. The decision in this case to forego a year*s output in an effort to produce a better trained young officer is, however, probably a wise one which will pay in the long run. Concurrently, efforts are being made to increase the /number. . •-3- nunber of cadets by enlarging the niilitary- school, from which come a lar^e proportion of cadets for the Military Academy* 7^ General St aff denial of boviet alle gations* On 13th December a denial, enanr.tinrj from the Persian General Staff, of certain accusations by radio I.'oscow and Baku in connection with American military equipment, and interference by American military advisers, was broadcast on Tehran radio. The Persian statement said that contrary to Russian allegations no v/ar material from the United States under the agree ment of October last had yet reached the shores of Persia, but that the first consignment of this equipment, which was limited to items required by the Persian Army for maintenance of internal security and the guarding of its frontiers, and contained no heavy aggressive weapons of war, was due to arrive in Persia on 15 th January, 19A-9* The statement continued that any nation which did not itself manufacture v/eapons of v/ar must perforce import those which its Army needed, and that before concluding the agreement with America, Persia had enquired both from Russia and Britain regarding their ability to supply the equipment required* The terms offered by the U.SrA. being the most advantageous, Persia had naturally accepted them, as she had every right to do, it being an entirely internal matter to be decided only by the appropriate authority in Persia. Referring to the accusation of interference in military affairs by the officers of the jjnerican Military mission, the statement said that this v/as completely untrue, that the American officers had no executive command and were used only in a technical or administrative capacity. Though the statement that no weapons of war from the U.S.A. have yet reached Persia is believed to be correct, a number of Jeeps have recently arrived from the IT.S.A. and have been distributed to the Army. 8. Fare Division* General Mutazedi, the new G.O.C. 6th (PARS) Division, appears to have made a good first impression in the district by his initial show of energy. He quickly made a tour of all his outlying garrisons and is reported as saying he found the people of Fars more lazy and undisciplined than those of Isfahan - his previous command. Ho extended this view to include the Army and he appears to be taking steps to tighten up the discipline in his new division. This has manifested itself in one v/ay by the cessation of attendance of Persian officers at British Council English lessons. Though a rule has existed for some time that Persian Army officers may not attend foreign institutes, this has not been strictly observed in Shiraz and a number of officers were previously attending English classes. There is no reason to believe that the enforcement by the new G.O.C. of the existing rule is directed against the British. General Kutazedi expressed a desire for friendship to H.K.Consul-Shiraz, and said that British and Persian policy in tribal areas ran parallel. The General has a daughter at school in England and his wife is also there at present. Kerm an Divi sion^ Brigadier Sartipi, the new G.O.C. of the Kerman Division, has also been displaying considerable energy since assuming command two months ago. He has had his troops out on a number of exercises, one of which was recently witnessed by the British Military Attache. Brigadier Sartipi was a cadet at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, about 25 years ago and has recently been in America in connection with the military equipment which is due to start arriving next month. He is a forceful character with considerable drive and since his arrival has organised a small flying column in 6 jeeps and a wireless truck, and armed with machine carbines, with the object of moving immediately to the assistance of the Gendarmerie or police in the event of trouble being caused by tribal brigands. /INTERNAL SECURITY.INTiSRNAL SECTmiTY., 1 Tudch aotiv ity in Khuzistan. The Tudeh party's secret cell meetings continue to be held in Abadan,and it is believed that the leaders are trying to increase the number 'of cells and to spread then over a wider area. H.M.Consul-General (AHWAZ) states from Khorranshahr that about a dozen new cells are reported to have been formed in various departments of the A.I.O.C. during October and the first half of November, and that about 135 cells are now functioning. A number of ex-Tudeh leaders, who were expelled from the Abadan area by the Persian authorities 2 years ago, are reported to have been paying a number of secretvisits to Abadan during the past few months, somehow having managed to evade the check kept by the police. 11 • Security - Pars. There were two eases early in November of lorries being held up by armed robbers near Shiraz. In the first* case a wheat lorry was held up ..ir , and looted near KAVAR (about 30 miles south of Shiraz l). A few days later a passenger bus from Tehran was held up on the main road about 60 miles north of Shiraz and passengers were robbed of their possessions and clothes. 12. Isfahan. At the beginning of November dmad Salek, the Tudeh party leader in Isfahan, was beaten up in the town. No very serious attempt appears to have been made to apprehend his assailants who wore not recognised, but arc thought locally to be members of the Government ASKI Trade Union, or soldiers. Three Tudeh party organisers who arrived in Isfahan recently, are reported to have been sent away immediately by the Military Governor who is also believed to confiscate consignments of the Tudeh party newspaper arriving from Tehran.

The construction of 3 new Gendarmerie posts along the road between Khairabad and Aru is reported to be making good progress. 14* New road - Fumeh - Llasulch. Considerable progress has been made on a new road which is being constructed by the Persian Amy between Rumen (15 miles south-west of RESET) and Masuleh, about 22 miles west of Fur.ien. The road follows the existing track which is being widened to 21 feet. Drainage ditches have been dug at the sides of the road and the surface is being consolidated with gravel* Culverts are being constructed where necessary, concrete pipes being used. The road is complete to about 5 miles west of Fumen and work is in progress on the uncompleted section. In addition to this nuw road, two new bridges are under construction on the existing road between Resht and Fumen. They will have reinforced concrete piers and will be about Class 18. The C.G.S. states that the road is being made to facilitate control of the tribes in that area, and that there is no intention of continuing the road beyond Masuleh. 15* Railway, Zahidan - Quetta.

In spite of rumours, which may not have been entirely without foundation,.that Taqizadeh (?.0*157) was to be called on to form a Cover men t the position of Sa’ed appears to be more stable than was anticipated a few weeks ago. Prom a conversation which the British Ambassador had with the Prime Minister on 16th IXcember it appeared that Sa'ed intended to concentrate on:- (a) restoring domestic order, especially in regard to the distribution of essential foodstuffs: (b) passing the budget for the 4 outstanding months of the fiscal year: (c) initiating the 7 Year Plan. He has already succeeded in getting the Budget passed by an over whelming vote except for various annexures which remain to be examined, and at a press conference on 27th December, which he said was the first of a scries to be held at least twice a month, he claimed that he had, since assuming office, improved the food situation by allowing bread to be brought to Tehran from the provinces. He has on several occasions stressed the importance of the 7 Year Plan, the bill for which is due to be considered by the kajlis in the near future, but which may be delayed by the case of Qavam. No one has yet been appointed as Minister of Justice, the Prime ■mister s choice, as reported in the last summary, having refused this appointment.

The agreement was instrumental in ringing about the passage of the budget, but some argument and disagreement has already appeared as to whether Qavam 1 s case, or the annexures of the budget, shall be disposed of next. 3* The Majlis. ‘ a ^ lis to form a quorum on several occasions round Christmas, and business has been somewhat slow. On 15th December the /Minister. . .-2- /of. . Minister of war introduced a bill for the payment of the Army budget ( V parar5 for details), and the Prime i inister drew the House's atteridm to the importance of this bill and of the 7 Year Plan Bill. The ^my budget has occupied several sessions since and Army expenditure has cone in for considerable ariticisn- On 28th December the Majlis approved a bill for the payment for 1/12ths of the Budget (i.e. for the remaining 4 months of the fiscal year) , but v/ithout its annexes v/hich are to go th- the Budget Commission before being considered by the Majlis. In effect, this appears to cover little but the salary cf government servants till the end of the Persian year, and other items of expenditure, unless they were included also in the previous year's budget, still remain to be approved^ Sympathy for the cause of the Indonesian republic has twice been mentioned in the Majlis, once being in the course of a speech by the Foreign Ministero series of questions have been put to the Government by three Majlis members and a reply by the Prime Minister has been requested within a fortnight, failing v/hich, it is threatened the questions will become the subject of an interpellation.- The questions include a request for explanation on the government action regarding the murder of Masoud, the suppression of newspapers, murders and robberies near Tehran, the episode in June last when fire was opened on the crowd demonstrating outside the !.ajlis (iMA's summary No&gt;11 para 11), the creation of an artificial famine, the interview between the late Foreign Minister and Mr Bevin, recent trouble with teachers, students and workmen, the pardon accorded to certain criminals, and the affair of the anti-aircraft shells (para 7 °f this summary). 4&lt;» The Pres s,- During the latter half of December the visit of George Allen (late U.S«a.Ambassador to Tehran) received considerable comment in the Press while the case of Qavam again came to the fore. The 7 Year Plan has been commented on favourably generally, but certain left wing papers have criticised it as another plot on the part of the ruling class. The reported statement of M.r /iley, the present American Ambassador to Persia, now on leave in the U.S. , that he intends to discuss the 7 Year Flan with the btate Department, caused much unfavourable comment. Recently, -Amy expenditure has come in for criticism, particularly the proposal to expend £2 million on cartridges from abroad. The Dutch have also been severely- criticised for their action in Indonesia, while the A.I.O.C. and the I.B.L have come in for attacks from the left wing press. __ Thp old favourite - attack on the ruling class - has also been given iVs 1 snare of attention^ The Prime Minister's first press conference, on the whole, received favour able comment:. MILITARY. 5« The -nr my Bu dge t o .,-fter several sessions spent in argument on the bill introduced by the Minister of Mar for the Army budget, it was approved by the Majlir on 9th January with the exception of an annex for the appropriation of H £2 million for the purchase of small arms ammunition abroad. Approval of expenditure on ordinary items up to the amount granted in the vote for last year had previously been obtained, as it was included in the periodical bills under which 1/I2th of the previous year's budget had been approved each month of the present Persian year. The bill just passed means that approval has now been given for expenditure of the difference under normal heads, amounting to 60 million rials, between last year's budget and this year's, and in addition to a sum of approximately 00 million rials for expenses in connection with transportation of the military equipment due from ^merica. It is not the custom of the Minister-3- /8. • # • © • • • of ,/ar to present detailed estimates to the I'ajlis. Total expenditure voted this year is 1718 million rials under normal expenditure, and '°0 minion rials for transportation of equipment. Of the £2 million demanded foi small aims ammunition about 10^o is intended for improvements to existing army factories* 6 # Small , ,ms mnunition. The Persian ^rmy at present holds very inadequate stocks of 7*?mm ammunition, v/hich is in general use throughout the Army for rifles, light automatics and machine guns. The output from the Persian Prmy factoiy is about 6 million rounds a year which does not adequately meet the requirements of training alone apart from the needs of local security operations, and provides nothing for building up reserve stocks. To meet 1he deficinecy, an agreement has been reached, or is expected shortly to be •oncluded, with Belgium for the purchase of 100 million rounds, but the approval of the , ajlis for the necessary funds for this purpose has not yet been obtained and there appears to be considerable opposition to the proposed expenditure, according to the Persian C.G-.S. it is hoped to obtain 20 million rounds as soon as the necessary funds have been obtai.ned and thereafter 20 million rounds every 3 months until a total of 100 million has arrivea. In addition it is intended to increase the output from the Persian factory from 6 million to 13 million rounds a year. This should make reasonable allowance for the annual needs of training, internal security and tribal operations. 7* Explosions in Tehran. Considerable alarm and excitement was caused in Tehran on the afternoon of Ounday 19th December by a number of mild explosions which occurred almost simultaneously in several places in the north-west of the town, .about a dozen persons are reported by the Press as having been wounded, though in the majority of cases the injuries were very slight. For a time mystery surrounded the cause of these explosions and a policy state ment published soon after attributed them to hand grenades thrown by persons as yet undiscovered. There were rumours of a jeep having been seen rushing wildly through the streets, firing on the crowd and then disappearing to the west. ^ Pany attributed the explosions to the Tudeh party, as simultaneous explosions in different places appeared to shew signs of organisation, while several newspapers the next day reported the ,.rmy or ruling classes had engineered the affair as an excuse to bring in martial law to ensure public security. Two days after the occurrence the General Staff published a statement that the explosions were caused by an anti-aircraft unit carrying out firing practice near the town, a number of rounds having failed to explode in the air and having exploded on contact with the ground. This explanation was rejected by many as fantastic but it is almost certainly 1 1 the correct one. Just west of Tehran there is a unit armed with 15mm anti-aircraft weapons, firing a small explosive shell which should explode in the air, but which would, if the self-destruction mechanism failed to operate, explode on hitting the ground. a. British member of this Embassy staff riding near the parade ground of this emit at the time the explosions occurred in the town, heard the noise of firing of guns of a light nature and a small object fell and exploded near her. iuch of the 15 mm ammunition held by the Persian amy is old stock, inspection, storage and safety regulations are considerably more lax than our own, and it is probable that one lot’ of ammunition has deteriorated and is unsafe to use. The alarm and false rumours which followed these explosions appear to shew that considerable nervousness exists in Tehran at the present time./• /12. • . • 8.'Strength of Persian ^riny* 3F' ^ccordin^ to a strength return shewn to the H.A. by the Persian ChG-.at the end of December, the total effective strength of the Persian ,.rny was 111 , 100 . During the recent debate on the u.rmy budget in the Dajlis, though no exact strength was officially quoted, it was argued by some who favoured reduction of military expenditure, that an ^rmy of 100,000 was unnecessarily large for Persia's internal requirements, and that it should be reduced in the interest of economy► Quite apart from any Majlis pressure, the C.G.S. recently told the I...n. that he thought a rather smaller, but more mobile and efficient ihrmy, would perhaps be more suitable for the country's needs than the present one, and it is possible t that with the issue of more modern equipment, due to be made this year, and the resultin • changes in organisation of a number of types of unit, some over-all reduction in strength will be made. Initially, however, the tendency will bo to increase the establishment of some units to allow for men to handle the now equipment, and no reduction can be expected until the provincial divisions are made reasonably mobile. 9-&gt; . ^rmy v e hicles . In addition to the vehicles included in the equipment due to reach Persia during the next few months under the .omurican 10 million dolla.r loan for the purchase of military equipment, 200 Jeeps and 500 load carrying vehi'les of 2 — 5 ton capacity have been ordered direct from the manufacturers in the U.S./i. for use of the Persian armed forces. Of these, about 100 jeeps recently arrived and have already been issued to units* 200 Chevrolet lorries have also reached the port of Khorramshahr• The remainrbr of the consignment is expected to arrive in the near future* 10. ;jnorican military equipment. Reports indicate that good arrangements have been mp.de by the Persian General Staff for the reception and onward rail journey to j.hwaz of thu .tjnerican equipment which is due to begin arriving at Bandar bhahpur this month* a.bout 8,000 tons, mostly munitions, is expected to arrive in January and 16,000 tons in February* arrangements allow for the handling of about 500 tons a day from each ship, not more than two ships being expected at one time. ^liwaz is being used as a collecting and distribution centre, but equipment, except a minimum for the holding of initial instruction m various centres, will not be issued to divisions until a cadre of instructors on the equipment has been trained in each division. This appears sound* A battalion of infantry is now stationed in Bandar bhahpur to ensure the security of the equipment in transit to proven*. cJ ._ ' sabotage at the port* 11* Russo-Persir.n frontier. .. few days a o, according to the Persian C.G-. b. , there was a mild recrudescence of frontier incidents when some disagreement, rerjarding the exact line of the frontier in thu region 4-0 miles N.D. of ArdohijBp^rosc between the Russian and Persian frontier posts there. The Persians^* apparently main to in that the frontier follows the crest of a series of hd.il 3 in this area, wb.-rcas the ussians, probably for the sake of local tactical advantage, claim that the frontier lies about a mile to the west. The C.G-.b» said that on the stretch of frontier between the road Ardebil - ^.stara and the river ^hraxes, there are five places where the frontier has been disputed from tine to tine for many years. No particular significance is attached to the present disagreement, which it is hoped will be settled, at any rate for the time being, by the local commanders*-5- INTx^m jL SJCURITY^ ^^2* Isfah an* Reference li.;Js sur.naary iio-20/1948 para 12* .i second assault was made on Jmad ualek, the Tudeh party leader in Isfahan, early in December* He was attacked and injured with a knifej his assailants, according to the Governor-General, being workers belonging to the Government sponsored D.G.K.I. union. 13* Pars. I'here has been some deterioration of security on the roads in Pars during the last two months. Several hold-ups by amed brigands have occurred on the road between Pasa and ohiraz, and in one of these a Persian contractor was killed. On 3rd December there was a hold-up on the road between Ghiraz and Bushire, and another between Shiraz and Firuzabad. In the latter case a lorry driver succeeded in notifying the nearest gendarmerie who, acting with commendable promptness, arrived on the scene while the bandits were still busy with the contents of a bus, and succeeded in capturing one of the gang. The new G.O.C. in Pars recently told i.If.Consul of his intention to concentrate the sub-units of his division which were previously located, presumably to aid security, in outlying villages. Xhough perhaps desirable from the point of view of administration and training, the concentration of these troops is scarcely likely to improve security in the area unless the division is provided with transport to make it much more mobile than it is at present. 14* Azerbaijan. The situation in Azerbaijan remains generally quiet. H.M.Consul- General at Tabriz reports that last month there was some nervousness amongst many of the population due to flights of unidentified aircraft, at i great height, over the province, and to rumours that something would happen on 12th December, the anniversary of the liberation of^the province, now celebfated as Persian ^rmy Day. The day, however, passed peacefully. &gt;In Tabriz there were endless processions and apparently genuine displays of patriotism and loyalty to the bhah amidst an atmosphere of enthusiasm and good humour. H.K.Consul-General states that there had been much more nervousness about a possible 'come—back’ by the Democrats the previous year, and that this time there was consioerable spontaneity eveident in the celebrations. Returned deportees continue to cause some e.nxiety to both civil and military authorities and there is little doubt that some |^p.re in touch with the Russians ana receive financial help from them* 15* Tudeh ac tivity in Khuzistan. Reports inc.icate that Tudeh party activity is on the increase in aliwaz and Khorramshahr. A similar 'step-up* in the number of cell meetings and subscription levies is also reported from the Oil Field areas, particularly iiasjid—i—ouleiman. In ^.badan about 48 cell meetings took place between Nov.16th and December 15th. During the sane period three individuals, all identified as prominent Tudeh party leaders, visited I ^ibadan for a few days in each case. All throe are known labour agitators, and two were arrested for subversive activities during the 1946 strike. A report from Ahwaz describes the arrival of a succession of suspicious nondescript characters by train from the north. The Russian Consulate appears to have a particular interest in these suspects* 16. Gtrike in .xbadan. On 13th December approximately 400 workers of the shipping /Department. . .—6— Department of the A.I.ChC. in Abadan held a one-day strike demanding the dismissal of a particular foreman for dishonesty and unfairness. The Company fully investigated the allegations and finding little truth in t^m refused to dismiss the foreman. The v/orkers remained dissatisfied su the Company offered to submit to arbitration and appointed its nomine G „ The workers’ leaders thereupon withdrew their complaints which, it seems clear, had been largely invented and put into the mouths of the workers by a young clerk in the Abadan office of the Ministry of Labour; he was subsequently transferred on health grounds to Tehran. ECONOMIC. 17. Isfahan power pla.nt» H.M.Consul at Isfahan reports that work on the foundations of the new power plant buildings at Isfahan is now well advanced. About 25$o of the boiler equipment is now on the sea and is expected to reach Isfahan towards the end of January. 10* Kuhrang tunnel * Reference I-hA’s summary No* 17/19^-8 para 16 . Work on the Kuhrang tunnel proceeds, though heavy falls of snow have severed communications with the outside world* At the end of 1948 about 80 yards of tunnel had been constructed, and work is expected to progress at between 1 and 2 yards a day. 19* Imperial Bank of Iran . Reference M.A 1 s summary No. 13/1948 para 18* The concession of the Imperial Bank of Iran expires this month and is not to be renewed? The conditions under which the Bank will be able to r«ontinue to operate in Persia are not yet certain. The Governor of the National Bank is pressing for conditions which would make it impossible for the Imperial Bank to continue business in thisicountry. It is hoped, however, that more reasonable counsel will ultimately win, and that the Imperial Bank of Iran will be enabled to continue to operate, probably being required to change its name and increase slightly its deposits in the National Bank* I r IS CPU ANJOU'S. 20. Floods near I sfahan* Unusually heavy rain for three days during the middle of December caused severe floods in certain villages near Isfahan, according to Tehran radio 2,500 people wore rendered homeless and 21 were killed as a result of the floods? A proposal, with double urgency, made in the Majlis by the Minister of Finance, that the Government be authorised to purchase 100 tens of wheat for the benefit of the flood victims provoked the retort that the rich merchants of Isfahan should themselves pay for the wheat, and the proposal for double urgency was rejected* 21• Cold spell ? For the last 3 weeks intense cold has been experienced in the greater part of Persia? Heavy snow fell in many regions just after Christmas, and temperatures have been very low since, causing snow on roads to turn to ice , and there has been very little thaw. As a result many roads, including those between Zenjan and Tabriz, and between Kazvin and /Resht. . -4 -7- Reshtj are still closed and travel on those roads in the north which are open is made difficult by the surface bein ; covered with ice* Considerable hardship has been felt among the poorer sections of the population in the '^outh of Tehran where many are inadequately housed and clothed, and relief measures have been started. 20 to 30 degrees of frost have been common lately in Tehran, and many other towns in the north, while 54 degrees of frost was recently reported from Rezaieh in Azerbaijan.

Though there has boon a considerable rise of temperature in most parts of Persia during the last week and a fairl Tr widespread thaw, a number of main roads still remain closed to traffic. A week ago it took the A.II.A. 4 days to travel by lorry from Resht to Tehran (^normally a 9 hour journey) owing to the depth of snow on the Kuhin Pass, 20 miles northwest of Kazvin. This pas a is rarely closed for more than 1 or 2 days. According to a newspaper report yesterday the roads between Koroj and Chalus and between Kermanshah and Hamadan wur * still closed. The lack of effective snow clearance on roads generally, the alternating icing and thawing of tho road surface which has ensued, and the extensive use of chains on vehicles, are causing a very rapid break up of many roads. The tarmacadam on those, roads which have it, is usually inferior and of inadequate thickness. Consequently numerous potholes ar now beginning to appear and thee -• are rapidly increased in size by he avy lorries.

I MILITARY ATTAOHS - TEHRAN SUMMARY (R ERSI A) No .3 of 1949 PCLITICAL. 1 &lt;&gt; Attem p t on the Sh ah 1 s life. On the afternoon of Ath Pebruary, as H.I.M. The Shah was arriving at Tehran University, an attempt on his life was made by a young man named Nasser Hussain Fakhrarai who fired five shots at the Shah. Fakhrarai gained access to the University precincts by obtaining a oard as a representative of a religious paper, said to be under the influence of Kashani, the well known religious leader, v/ho is believed to have been behind much of the agitation against Hajir last summer. Just after the Shah had left his car Fakhrarai advanced with a camera as if to photograph the Shah and suddenly producing an automatic, fired 5 shots at close range. Two of the shots inflicted superficial wounds, one cutting the Shah's cheek and lip, and another grazing his back, while the other shots passed through his hat. The Shah was able to walk to his car in whiffh he was taken to the Military Hospital for treatment before returning to his palaue. Two days later he was able from his bed to broadcast a short speech in which he stressed his readiness to undergo any sacrifice for the unity and well-being of his people. Documents found on Fakhrarai, who was shot several times shortly after his attack on the Shah, and died the same evening, shew that he was a member of the Tudeh party. The exact circumstances of the shooting of this man are wrapped in mystery, for though the Chief of Police is believed to have shot him in the foot, quite correctly, an unknown person, perhap s not di si nterested, appears to have ^fired the fatal shots. —' 2. Repercussions. Immediately after the incident the Government resigned, but this was not accepted. On 5th February, at a special session of the Majlis, twe decrees were passed:- (a) establishing martial law and a curfew in Tehran: (b) prescribing the Tudeh party throughout the country. Members of the central organisation of the Tudeh party in Tehran and leaders of the party in the provinces have been arrested. Others who have b jn arrested include the religious leader, Kashani, and a number of ne.^paper editors. The premises of the Tudeh party have been taken over by the government, and their newspaper, 'Mardcm', together with a large number of other papers, have been suspended. The Police claim that the attempt, if successful, would have been the signal for a coup d'etat and a widespread revolutionary movement. The Persian 0. G. S. states that evidence was obtained to show that if the Shah had been killed, this was to have been followed by the murder cf a large number of other officials throughout the country. Zli3* Gove rnme nt in terpellations* Abbas Eskandari concluded his interpellation speech in the Majlis on 2yth January when, continuing his attack on the A.I.O.C., and demanding the cancellation of the concession, he worked himself int^ a frenzy, ending v/ith tears streaming down his face. I'aqizadeh (P.O.No.137) then replied to the allegations of Jskandari and explained that he did not think it in the country's interests to reveal in public all he knew about the prolongation of the A.I.O.C. concession. However, he went on to explain that Reza Shah had originally ordered the D'Arcy concession to be repudiated before the question of v/hat was to take its place had been decided. Suddenly, after the Company had demanded arbitration at the Plague, but before a decision was reached there, the late Shah, under pressure, agreed to prolong the existing concession. Taqizadeh said that the fact that he had signed the agreement was unimportant, as Reza Shah was all~p«werful and it was impossible to argue v/ith him. This speech has not improved the position of the A.I.O.C., as it is v/idely felt that a concession signed in such circumstances should not be considered valid. On 30th January the oil question was discussed at a secret session and this was followed *y a statement from the Minister of Finance to the effect that the Prime Minister's interview v/ith Reuter's correspondent, in which he v/as reported as saying he would abide by certain articles of the Concession, v/as unofficial. This, in the circumstances, was perhaps the best explanation. The Majlis v/as in something of a quandary for it did not wish to overthrow the Government by a vote of no confidence, but at the same time wished to register its disapproval of the oil concession. Finally, Eskandari's interpellation v/as ruled out of order owing to the non-official character of the Prime Minister's interview. Rahimian, the author of the second interpellation, after speaking on the poverty of Khorassan and its lack of a fair proportion of money for public v/orks, v/as persuaded to withdraw his interpellation.* The Government then, on 6th February, asked for a vote rf confidence irrespective of the interpellations, and this it obtained by 59 votes in favour from the.93 deputies present. The other A deputies voted against the G-overnment. After the vote one of the deputies declared that it should be clearly understood that this vote of confidence had nothing to do with the oil question. A. Departure of Qava m. Qavam-es-Sultaneh, the aged ex-Premier of Persia, concerning whom there have been so many under currents in the political field during the last few months, left Tehran by air for France on 8th February. There were rumours that he was being banished but it is known that he had made arrangements to leave Persia before the attempt on the Shah's life, so that even if he went under pressure it was not connected with that incident. His departure removes from the scene , for the time being, an unstabilising influence in Persian internal affairs. MILITARY. 3• Militar y gov ernment in Te hran. Since the establishment of military government in Tehran, 'kh® attempt on the Shah's life, each civil policeman in the town is accompanied by one or two soldiers with fixed bayonets. A few troops are believed to have been located near the main bazaar and in the south of cow.!, ana military check posts have been established 6n several of the main roads near their entrance to Tehran, but in general, apart from those with the police, soldiers are not much in evidence. Major-General IQiosrovani, one of the Deputy Chiefs of the General Staff, has been appointed military governor and the normal general staff organisation is being used for ccntr'l-&gt; The ourfev/, which v/as criginally ordered from 10pm, has new been changed s11 pm, after which enly those with special permits are allowed in the streets. 6. American equipment. The first ship containing military equipment from the U.S.A. arrived at Bandar Shahpur a few days ago. A second ship is expected abmit 10th February, and a third a few days later. The policy is to move all equipment frem the dock area as quickly as possible by rail to AHWAZ. 7* Visits by Royal Navy. H.k.S.Norfolk visited Abadan for a few days in the latter half #f January, and Wild Goose, v/ith the Senior Naval Officer Persian (Gulf, after leaving Basra, paid a visit to Bushire. Loch Qoich for technical reasons had to cut short a visit to Jask and was unable to call, as planned, at Bandar Shahpur early in February. INTERNAL SECURITY. B. Tehran. * Following increased propaganda in the Press against the A.I.O.G. concession and the Imperial Bank of Iran (see also para 15) and a number of irresponsible statements on these subjects in the Majlis, two demonstrations by University students took place in Tehran last week. The students demanded the cancellation of the A.I.0.0. concession and the closing down of the Imperial Bank, and sent a deputation to the 1'ajlis, but did not get unduly out of hand. Leaflets were also distributed in the streets last week demanding the abrogation of the concession. These demonstrations, probably v/orked up by a small hostile minority, reflect the weakness of the Government and a lack of confidence in its ability to protect the country's interests rather than any widespread anti-British feeling in Persia. 9• Bushire area - clash v/it h smuggler s. According to a report from H.N.Vice-Consul at Bushire there was a pitched battle on 9th January near the Tangestan coastal village of Lavar, between a Government coastal guard force and a band of smugglers. A coastal guard officer and 3 of his men were killed and the smugglers suffered some casualties. As a result reinforcements of Coastal Guards .have been drafted to the area and a number of* arrests have been made. Though recent attempts have been made by the authorities to enforce preventive measures snuggling on a large scale appears still to continue in this area. COII UNICATIONS. 10. Khorramshahr port. It is realiably reported that the port of Khorranshahr is silting up rapidly and that unless dredging is undertaken ocean going vessels nay be unable to get alongside the docks in a few months time. Unfortunately the Persian authorities have little or no dredging machinery and though efforts are being made to borrow equipment from Basra it is not known yet what success this request for assistance will have. 11* New road - Isfahan - Shahr Kur d. A direct route between Isfahan and Shahr Kurd is being made by converting the existing track via Pol-i-Vargan into a motor road. This will save about 50 miles compared with the existing route via Gardaneh-i- Urohinom the Shiraz road. The Government are said to have promised one million rials for the work, which is expected to be finished by the autumn. /According. . . .* I £ /. According to the G-ovornor of the Bakhtiari, press reports that it is o intended to join Isfahan by road with the oilfields are incctrect. !b ; ^0 12. Road - Meshed - Zahidan. H.I.Vice-Consul, Meshed, who travelled to Zahidan via Firjand during January, reports that the road is in fair condition, not having deteriorated to the same extent as other roads surfaced by our forces during the war. This is probably largely due to the relatively light traffic over the route. 13* Road - Isfahan - Kerman. The road Isfahan - Kerman, via Nain and Yazd, when traversed in December 'i 9MS was in good condition for most of its length. Though there are the usual corrugations, common to almost all shingle surfaced roads i: in Persia, they are not deep and fairly high speeds arc possible. The road is generally wide enough for 2-way convoy traffic, but there are narrov/ stretches through a number of villages. Sand is inclined to blow across the roa.d anywhere between Yazd and about 25 miles north of it, and over a stretch a few miles south of Rafsinjan, and might at times interrupt traffic. Petrol is obtainable from a pump at Tain and Yezd and in tins in Anar, Rafsinj~'. and Kerman. ECONOlilC. 1A* 7 Year Plan. Several more experts of Overseas Consultants and some English experts, who are being co-opted, have arrived in Tehran. Dr Naficy, the President of the provisional organisation for the 7 Year Plan resigned towards the end of January and has been succeeded by Ahmad Hussain Adi. Certain discussions on the Plan have taken pl8.ee with the Advisers, who are also making preliminary visits to various parts of Persia, but the Plan has not yet gone before the Majlis. 15* Imperial Bank. Reference MA’s summary No.1 para 19* The Imperial Bank of Iran’s concession reached the end of its 60 year term on 30th January,1949* and from the.t date the Bank became subject to Iranian law in all respects. The immediate effect of this change would be no more than to make the Bank subject to Iranian taxes, since there arc at present no banking laws in the country. Mr Ebtehaj, the Governor of the Bank Me Hi, Iran, has, hov/ever, been urging the Iranian Government to enact legislation controlling the activities of foreign banks and seems to have obtained the support of the Minister of Finance for his proposals. The Imperial Bank consider that the conditions which Ebtehaj wishes to impose would be quite unacceptable to them and that if they became law, the Bank would cease business in Persia. Discussions continue. The Bank has suggested that it should change its name and be called 'The British Bank in Iran and the Middle East'. APPO INTfrUHT S. 16 . Military (i) Colonel Mir Jehangiri took over command of the 15th Infantry Regiment at Shiraz on 16 th December,1948.

Enquiry into the attem pt on th e Sha h ’s life, / The enquiry into the circumstances of the attempt on the Shah's life was finished a day or two ago and the report is now believed to be nearing completion. Apart from publicising Fakr Aral's diary, which shews how he became a member of the Tudeh party, little information has yet been released to the public as a result of the enquiry. There appears, however, to be little doubt that the attempt on the Shah's life was part of a deep laid plot to gain control of the country by a minority. When the Police raided the Tudeh printing house on 4th February, (the day after the attempt on the Shah's life) they found an edition of 'Mardrm' which should have appeared the day before, containing such phrases as 'tomorrow we shall raise the bloody flag of the martyrs'. There was also a set up for a special edition, with a space for a front page 'splash' left blank. The fact that ! _ a recent broadcast from radio Baku contained the text of a clandestine proclamation by the Tuduh party issued a few days previously, but the existence of which v/as unknown to the public or to any foreign news agency except 'Tass', demonstrates the connection between the Tudeh party and the Communists and v/as not lost on Persian officials or the Press. Tehran radio in fact, in a broadcast in French on 21st February said that this broadcast from Baku clearly shewed the Tudeh party to be the tool of a foreign power. Further details of the internal situation are given in para 13* Ho. 4.50/4/49- 2. Soviet protest. The Soviet Ambassador called on the Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs on 12th February to protest against part of the statement made by ^ Dr Eghbal to the Majlis on 5th February on the subject of the attempt on the Shah's life. Dr Eghfaal quoted extracts from the diary of Fakr Arai, the Shah's assailant, saying that he was a member of the Tudeh party and that the Party v/as vmdor Soviet control. Yh~ Ambassador is believed also to have protested against the closing of the Soviet bookshop in Tehran. The Soviet Ambassador supported his representations by an 'aide memoire' and a reply in the same form v/as given by the Persian Foreign Minister, who is understood to have pointed out that the part of Dr Eghbal's statement e ' •’ objected to was a quotation and could not be taken as necessarily representing the views of the Persian Government. There has been strong criticism in the Persian Press of the general attitudeof Moscow wireless towards the attempt on the Shah's life, its defence of the Tudeh party and its objection to the establishment of martial law. 3* The Elections. On 25th February, H.I.M.The Shah issued the Imperial Decree for the elections for the 16th Majlis. The 'Firman' v/as issued in the usual form, and stated that as only 5 months of the life of the present Majlis remained, he was, in accordance v/ith the electoral law and on the advice of the Prime Minister, calling for elections to take place for the 1 6 th Majlis. The existence of military government in most parts of Persia is likely to ensure a return of candidates favouring the Shah, and it will not lie surprising if military government remains in force until after the elections efren if the general situation no longer requires it. A- /7 -2- 4* Constituent AssemHy* It has for some time been known that the Shah was anxious to introduce constitutional reform though the way in which this would !e done was uncertain. At length, on 24th February, after many disaassions behind the scenes with elder statesmen and others, the Shah summoned various Ministers and leaders of political fractions, and told then that the state of the j* - country clearly shewed that the principles of the Constitution were not in keeping with the times and that certain reforms were necessary. He said there should be machinery for dissolving the Majlis and for revising the Constitution. He therefore required the Gkrvernnent to issue a decree for a Constituent Assembly and take all necessary action as soon as possible. He further said that if the existing Majlis were unable to pass the Senate Rill and to amend the Electoral Law by the time the Constituent Assembly was invoked (this is expected to be about the middle of April) these two natters would be dealt with by the latter. The ’'firman' for the convocation of the Constituent Assembly together with regulations for its election were published today. So far, reactions to the formation of a Constituent Assembly appear to be favourable but it is as yet early to judge. 5* The Majlis. The Majlis was apparently jerked into activity as a result of the attack on the Shah. On 15th February a notion was approved by the Majlis calling on the Government to submit to the Majlis 7 Year Plan Committee within 3 months, its own plan for the implementation of the 7 Year Plan. Considerable attention has also been given to the Press Law, certain details of which are given in para 6 . The Economic Commission approved a new Income tax law though the ability of the administration fully to implement any law of this nature is always open to doubt. Later in the month enthusiasm again declined and the Majlis failed to form a quorum on several occasions, but on 23rd February the Minister of Finance tabled the budget for the Persian year 132® which begins on 20th March,1949* This constitutes something of a record being the first time for many years that a o'pnpletc budget has been presented before the start of the year to which it applies. Supplementary clauses for the last 4 months of the present year's budget, however, still await approval. During the month Eskandarij Communist sympathiser and author of the inter pellation last month, perhaps thinking discretion the better part of valour, left the country. Engineer Razavi, whose voice has also been heard frequently in the Majlis of late, and who is considered by some to be mentally deranged,, also departed a few days ago for the United Kingdom. £* The Dress Bill. On 8 th February the Minister of Education, Dr Zanganeh, introduced in the Majlis a Press Pill with the request for 'double urgency' procedure. This bill provides for the immediate arrest and trial without jury of any editor or writer responsible for a seditious article or one defamatory to the Shah, the Royal Family, the religion of the country, Ministers, Deputies and Government officials, or Heads of Foreign Governments. This measure aroused considerable antagonism amongst Majlis Deputies who considered it a device completely to muzzle the Press. The Press itself, in spite of the existence of martial lav/ and the consequent fear of being suppressed, protested vociferously agiinst the Bill. In the Majlis the proposal- for 'double urgency' was lost by 2 votes and the Bill passed to the Education Commission who referred it to the Justice Commission. Here it was re-drafted to limit its provision to immediate arrest and trial for articles inspiring sedition or those attacking the Shah, his near relatives, the Islamic religion and Heads of Foreign Governments. Owing perhaps to opposition to the Bill, there was no quorum in the Majlis on several days round the middle of February and the new draft was not presented to the Majlis until 22nd February when a lively but inconclusive argument ensued.MILITARY. /12. ..... ?• Extension of military Government. At a cabinet meeting on 21st February the Minister of War was authorised to declare military government in any area where he considered it to be necessary for the maintenance of order. Following this there was a considerable extension of military government to include all towns where a divisional or brigaue headquarters is located, and in addition the tov/ns of Babul, Amcl, Lahijan and Bandar-i—Gaz (all near the Cespian), Darijaz, near Lutfabad on the Turkoman frontier, and Ramadan and Malayan. This in effect means that all important towns in Persia are now under military government. The reason, according to the Persian C.G.S., is that the arrest of Tudeh 2 leaders was not being carried out satisfactorily by the rtivil adrainistration owing to Tudeh infiltration amongst officials of th~ Ministry of Justice. Since the establishment of military government arrests have been effected as required in the provinces but there is rather more difficulty in rounding up c^ll suspects in ichran. The C.G. S. said it would probably not be necessary to continue military government for more than 2 or 3 months. S* Tehran. In Tehran the curfew has now been extended to midnight* There are, according to the Persian C. G*3., six battalions of military police in the town^superimposed on the livil police organisation. From these units, one military policeman, with bayonet fixed on hisrifle, normally accompanies each civil policeman at his usual post. The military police units being used for this duty are not wearing the white helmet normally worn by military police but are dressed to appear like normal infantry. At night, in addition to the soldiers with the civil police, military patrols in jeeps tour the town. Apart from a few shots at taxi-drivers, who have failed to stop when challenged, nothing unusual has occurred, though one cannot proceed far after curfew hours v/ithout being stopped. 9* Arrests in the Army. The 'Persian C.G. S. told the It.A* that those arrested for Tudeh activity include a few Army officers, but no senior officers. He said that as those ) officers with known Tudeh or Communist/ had been dismissed from the Army after the Azerbaijan trouble 2 years ago, there was not now any appreciable de^pree of Communist infiltration in the Army. Questioned on the Civil Police he said that perhaps there was some Communist infiltration there. 10 . Military call-up. On 16th February the Cabinet approved the calling uo for military service men of the 1929/30 age group. This is the normal routine approval required for call-up. 11. American equipment. The first ship containing military equipment from tho U.S.A. has now completed unloading and the second ship is at Bandar Shahpur. The first ship c stained mainly munitions and the second had 105 mm guns and more munitions. A third ship is on its way from Germany and is expected at Bandar Shahpur in a few days, while a fourth has just sailed from America. Some re-organisation of unloading arrangements had to be initiated at Bandar Shahpur by General Evans, head of the American Military Mission to Persia, when he' visited the port about the time of arrival o^ the first ship. For the first day or two unloading did not proceed smoothly, but since then the intended figure of 500 tons to be unloaded daily is claimed to have been exceeded. (+) sympathynco -4- * 12 . Aneriean air crash. The American Air Attache, Lieut#Col,Christ, the assistant Air Attache, Captain Saunders, and 3 N.C*Os., lost their lives when the .hiaeri^an Air Attache’s aircraft crashed into the Bakhtiari mountains on a flight from Tehran to Dhahran on 6 th February, There was heavy cloud and a very strong south wind, whi&lt;*h had been considerably underestimated in the weather reports that day, and it is believed that the ^ir Attache, thinking ho had passed the mountain range and was over the Khuzistan plain, began to descend through the cloud with a view to landing at Abadan, but being further north than he thought he crashed into the snow covered mountains whi«h in that region go up to 14,000 feet. It was several days before the aircraft was spotted from the air lying in the snow in a completely uninhabited area some 10,000 feet up on the mountain side, ano about two weeks before a party consisting largely of Persian Army personnel on skis was able, at considerable risk to itself, to reach the aircraft, which by that time was almost completely buried by fresh snow. All 3 occupants of the aircraft were fourld dead and frozen, and are believed to have been killed outright at the tJLme of the crash. In any case there would have been little or no change' of survival in that inhospitable region at this time of year for anyone who had not been killed, during the crash. INTARN^L SECURITY. The general internal situation. The internal situation in Persia, .following the attempt on the Shah's life, has remained generally quiet. The establishment of military law in most towns of any significance has facilitated the arrest of Tudeh leaders and others who have taken a.n active part in furthering Tudeh or Communist aspirations. According to the C,g,s. about 230 persons have so far been arrested throughout the country. These are •hiefly the •entral organisers and local leaders of the Tudeh party, but include also a number of newspaper editors, some of whom have alrerady been sentenced to terms of imprisonment by military tribunals. Several professors of Tehran University have been struck off the rolls of the University and a considerable number of officials of the Ministries of Education and Justice, proved to have strong Tudeh sjimpathies, have been dismissed from their posts. The religious leader, Kashani, reported in para 2 of K.A's summary I T o.3 as having been arrested, has been allowed to proceed to Syria and the Lebanon. It is not intended to grant him a re-entry visa to Persia, at any rate for the time being. Some 20 arrests were made at the sugar refinery in KarcJ following the discovery that Fakr Aral and his actomplice, ^bdullah Arkani, used to attend nie^tings there• COMMUNICATIONS. 14* Persian Railways. The Persian State Railways are still v/ithout foreign exchange to purchase material required urgently for maintenance and repair of their rolling stock and trark. The proposed settlement of Persia’s claims against the Allies for use of the railway during the war has not yet been approved by the Majlis but a formula has been found which it is hoped will enable the Persian Government to accept the settlement.(+i)r Sajjadi, announced at the end of January that he wished to resign his post because the Majlis refused to give him the credits necessary to put the railways in good order, but the Prime Minister asked him to continue in office for the ^time being. Meanwhile, the railways continue to run at reduced efficiency, and the quantity of oil transported from the south in December 1,948 and January 1949 was over 13 % below requirements because of difficulties with railway transport, the deficiency being made up by drawing on reserves in Tehran.

Pew details are available of the progress of these discussions but it is believed that the Russians wish to buy livestock from Persia in return for cotton piece-goods, iron beams and timber. It is understood that the Russians.have been unwilling to discuss the return of Persian gold and.dollars helo in Moscow. Meanwhile the Soviet Union has been sending a variety of products, including piece-goods, to Persia, at cheap prices for ale against rials v/hich the Soviet apparently use for their activities in his country. jlA appointments. 24* Civil, (a) Mustafa .adl (Mansur Saltaneh) P.0.1, has been taken into the Govern]lent as Minister v/ithout portfolio, (b) Jehangir Samsam Bakhtiari has been appointed Governor of Kurdistan.

British Embassy, Tehran. 1st March, 1949*/**% MILITARY ATTACH^ - TEHRAN SUn r ARY (PERSIA) Nr.5 of 1949 fid^ iil ^ POLITICAL. 1. G overnment changes. Several changes in the Cabinet were made last week. JChalil Fahimi, who for the last 6 months has been Governor-General of Azerbaijan, has been brought in to the Cabinet as Minister without Portfolio. Dr Sajjadi, previously Minister of Communications, goes over to the Ministry of Justice, which portfolio has been vacant since the resignation of Sadr (F.0.132) reported in para 1 cf Summary No.19/1948. Nadir Arasteh, Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, becomes Minister of Communications, but no one has yet been nominated to take the post he vacates and the Prime Minister will himself fill it for the time being. Dr Iqbal vacates the. Ministry cf Health for that of the Interior, being succeeded in the former ministry by Dr Adham, who thus returns to the post ho held in Hajir's government. It is generally believed that these changes do not in any way strengthen the Cabinet, nor are they thought to have any particular significance. 2. Constituent Assembly. Reference para 4 of Summary No.A* Although the general attitude towards the convocation of the Constituent Assembly continues to be vaguely optimistic, few people really understand its implications. Preparations for the election of the •Constituent Assembly are in progress and the necessary funds were recently approved by the Majlis. The Assembly will consist cf double the number of representatives from each constituency as are normally elected to the Majlis, and members of the present Majlis are eligible for election. The elections of the Constituent Assembly are expected to be held at the end of this month. 3» Persian - Soviet relations. The Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs handed the Russian Ambassador an 'Aide Memoire' at the beginning of this month complaining of attacks by the Soviet radio. Three favourite Soviet charges were denied, namely:- (a) that Persia was being turned into an American base for action against the Soviet Union: (b) that Persian Government officials were the servants of foreigners: (c) that the Persian Government was being tyrrannical in suppressing certain political parties. In spite of this, violent and slanderous attacks against Persia, and at times against particular officials, hav^ continued from the Soviet radio. 4.

This is the third one which the Prime Minister has to answer as r^jerponations were earlier submitted by two other deputies. On several occasions lately business has been brought to a standstill by lack of a quorum. Majlis members at present appear to be in a mood of apathetic docility in which they might pass almost any measure if a quorum can be got together. The Press Bill. Reference M.A’s Summary No.A para 6 « After further argument the Government Press Bill, in its revised form but j/ith certain additions, was approved as a single article bill containing 7 clauses. A large number of undebated amendments were referred to a Committee whi«h, if it accepts them, can bring them before the Majlis later. Two clauses in the bill appear to be somewhat contradictory in that one clause permits anyone to publish a paper without a licence or permission, whereas the final clause prohibits government employees from holding a licence for editing or publishing a newspaper. 6 . The Press. Since the wholesale suppression of papers following the attempt on the Shah's life, various newspapers have gradually beep making an appearance again and about 25 weekly and daily papers are now in circulation. Papers on the whole are moderate in tone and restrained in their language compared with the vociferous and abusive utterances of the past. Most papers publish full accounts of the progress of the trial of the Tudeh party leaders towards whom they show no sympathy. Some papers recently openly asserted that the reason some of the leaders could not be found was that they were hiding in the Soviet summer Embassy at Gulhek, and this drew from the Soviet Embassy an official denial. The 'aide memoire' to the Soviet Embassy referred to in para 3 was warmly supported in the Press, it being suggested by one left wing paper that the Persian Government might refer the matter to the Security Council if Soviet abuse continued. The Constituent Assembly has been given prominence in all sections of the Press which are unanimous in approving the Shah's decision. The passage of the new Press Bill has aroused considerable indignation, the Bill being regarded as an infringement of liberty. Impatience at the lack of any official public announcement on the progress of the negotiations with the A.I.O.C. has been shewn by several papers.

S. the change of title does not constitute much real change of status for General Shahbakhti provioucly had a smill staff to co-ordinate certain military matters in Azerbaijan, The two divisional commanders in Azerbaijan previously had, and still have, direct approach to the General Staff in Tehran. In emergency, however, it is intended that General Shahbakhti would take executive command, and in the event of a breakdown of communications with Tehran he would be expected to assume control. His H.Q. is not teally large enough to exercise effective operational command, but the change of title is a step in the right direction towards improving co-ordination in the military field in Azerbaijan. INTERNAL SECURITY. 11. General Si tu ation. The general situation in Persia, at any rate on the surface, continues quiet. The number of arrests, almost entirely of Tudeh leaders and officials now totals 560, according to th^ Persi'n C.G.S., who also states that over half of these are from the provinces of Azerbaijan, Gilan and Mazanderan. The Caspian port of Pahlevi comes near the top of the list of numbers of arrests in individual towns. Most of the wanted Tudeh party , members are now believed to have been found, but there are still some arrests remaining to be effected in Tehran. 12 . Tria.ls in Tehran. The trial of 14 Tudeh leaders by a military court in Tehran began on 2nd March and still continues. The charges are based on two articles of a law of 1931 providing for imprisonment of anyone being a member of a party hostile to Constitutional Monarchy, or having a Communist programme, or of anyone taking action to separate part of Persia,or impair its independence or integrity. Several students have been sentenced to terms of imprisonment of moderate length for distributing Tudeh pamphlets, and 7 journalists have also been sentenced to imprisonment. On appeal, some of the sentences were reduced, and none appear particularly severe. COld iUNT CATIONS. 13* Railway QUM - KASHAN. Reference M.A’s Su^ ry No-, 19/1948 para 6 . The laying of the line on the section of railway between QUM and KASHIN is nearing completion, there being only about 1C miles of track remaining to. be laid. Rails for the remaining stretch are skid to be on the site. It is estimated that the line will be through by the end of May. As stations and other construction were completed several years ago, it is reasonable to expert the line to be in operation by the middle of this year.Jili k. 6605 I J Roc-d ISF.Jii^N - QUM, During the last year or so work has been prorceding slov/ly on the construction of a considerable number of culverts on the section of the main ISFAHAN^- QUM road_between 5 and 15 miles north of Isfahan. This stretch has been raised about iR inches by the addition of earth and shingle, and both this work and the culvert_ construction now appear to be completed. The raising of the road and construction of cULverts on this stretch was necessary as tho ground, which is mostly mud in this area, is liable to flood after heavy rain, but the execution of the work is not good. The absence of solid foundation has been shewn up by the exceptional snow and rain this winter, and the raised stretch, which has only been brought into use for most of its length during the last tv/o months, is already badly corrugated and only slow speeds are possible. The rest of the road to QUM, compares on the whole unfavourably with other shingle roads in this country and badly needs re surfacing. There are several stretches where the road is very badly pot- holed. r.ISCDLL/i'DOUb. 15* Return of Prince Abdul Reza. Reference M.A’s Summary No.20/l91f8 para 21.

The Persian New Year holidays have extended for the greater part of the period since the last summary. The Majlis was in recess for nearly 2 weeks and on some other occasions a quorum could not be formed. The elections for the Constituent Assembly are now in progress and results are starting to appear. The New Year holiday was interrupted for some by an incident on the frontier north of CURGAN in 'which one Rjrsian soldier was killed‘and another wounded by Soviet troops. Though considerable publicity has been given to the affair, apparently as a result of the desire of the Persian C.G-.S. to make public such instances of Soviet action, it does not appear to be of unusual significance. On 2nd April a further incident involving exchange of shots between Persian and Soviet troops took place in the area of (SANtEM BULAGH, AO miles NNW of ARDGBIL on the Azerbaijan frontier. This also has been the scene of previous incidents. Details of these two incidents are given in paras 5 a ^d 6 . Though no official statement has yet been issued there have been reports, which appear to have foundation, that ^the U.S.S.R. are withdrawing all their Consulates from Persia. Trials of those‘'arrested'^in coTmection with the attempt on the^hah's life continue, and martial law is still in force. 2. Elections for Constituent Assembly. Polling for the elections to the Constituent Assembly began in Tehran on 3rd April and are due to continuo- till 7th ^pril. In certain other towns polling was due to begin a day earlier than in Tehran but the attempt at Qazvin to boat the pistol by several days was ruled a foul and voting had to start afresh in that town. In several districts, however, voting has finished and the election of 62 out of the 264 deputies has so fe^T been announced. In most cases lists of people acceptable for election have been distributed to the supervisory electoral committees who apparently must ensure that those elected are on these lists. There is therefore some freedom of choice but undesirable candidates are eliminated. The section of the military government law prohibiting all assemblies was suspended to allow election meetings. 3. The Majlis. The Majlis reassembled on 3rd April after nearly two weeks recess for the Persian New Year. Naki raised the question of the delay in the Government's reply to his interpellation which was a month old. The Speaker replied that the Government was ready to reply to the two interpell ations on any day fixed by the Majlis. The House then proceeded to elect the new Speaker, Mr Hckmat's 6 months tern of office being ended. On the first count no one obtained an absolute majority and the voting was held again. This tine Hcknat was re-elected as Speaker.*4 Soviet Consulates. Though no official statouent on the subject has yet issued from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs it appears probable that all Soviet Gcr^J&amp;Lates in Persia are to be withdrawn* Before the war the Persians had on^ CTnsuLate post at Qaku and the Russians one at Pahlcvi, on the Caspian Sea # During the war the U,S*S.R. established Consulates at Meshed, Isfahan, Tabriz, Ahwaz and Kermanshah, and several Vice-Consulates in Azerbaijan. Persia has for some tine been trying to obtain some reciprocal agreement with the U # S*S|R# as regards Consular posts, and it seems probable that as a result of this the U»S»S,R» has now decided to withdraw all or nearly all its Consulates from Persia. Reports have been received from the provinces to the effect that the Soviet Consulates are already packing up at Meshed, Tabriz and Isfahan. 5* The Press. Until the Now Year holidays all papers continued to publish full reports of the tria^ of ox-Tudch party leaders and others implicated in the plot against the Shah. Particular attention was drawn to the subversive activity shewn by the evidence for the prosecution as having been, going on in the provinces. During the New Year no papers appeared for about 10 days, so it was difficult to note any reaction to the Atlantic Pact. .Eventually, however, the references by Mr Bovin and Mr Achcson to Persia, in connection with the Atlantic Pact, received very favourable connent in the Persian Press. The frontier incident north of G-urgan has been given prominence in several papers which demand that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should take up the matter with the Soviet Government. The 7 Year Plan and Persia’s economic condition generally continue to receive attention, ^but little mention has lately appeared of the Imperial Bank or the A.I.O.C. MILITARY. 6 . Turkoman frontier incident. The Persian C.G.S. informed the M.A. that on 20th March 3 Persian soldiers proceeding between the two frontier posts of Scnger Tope and Ncftilja, north of Gurgan, were fired on by a Soviet party reported as being about 50 strong. One Persian soldier was killed, and the other two, of whom one was wounded, v/erc taken prisoner by the Russian troops. Shortly afterwards a Soviet force consisting of some 500 Infantry with a few tanks took up position near the Persian frontier post located about 2 miles north of a small oil gusher marked on the map as Neftilja. The Soviet Commander told the Officer in charge of the Persian post to withdraw south of Neftilja, and threatened that if he did not comply before a stated time the Soviet troops would attack. ThcPersian post, however, on instructions from Tehran, stood fast and informed the Soviet Commander that any proposal for frontier adjustment must be made through diplomatic channels as he, the Persian Commander, was not empowered to i.uike any local change of the nature proposed. The r Persian officer also asked for the return of the soldiers taken prisoner and was informed that they would be returned provided the Pbrsian officer signed a statement to the effect that the soldiers were taken on Soviet soil. This the Persian officer refused to do, as he maintained that the, incident clearly took place well within Persian territory. In fact, 3 of the Soviet posts are located south of what the Persians consider to be the correct frontier. There appears to be some doubt, however, as to what is the true boundary in this region, and there have been frequent incidents here in the past, e.g. see M.A’s Sunrary No.18 of para 6 (second incident). On several occasions in the past Soviet troops have penetrated a considerable distance south of the Atrek riv^r which the Persian C.G.S. maintains demarcates the boundary, though here again there is room for disagreement as this river has more than one bed. The maximum penetration has been in the nature of 30 miles south of the ^trek river. The lateral distance over /which-3- which the frontier is in dispute is about 40 miles. Those figures appear to have given rise to a misleading statement in one of the Persian newspapers, taken up by Turkish radio, which appeared to indicate that Soviet troops war 0 now 80 kilometres inside Persian territory. L note of protest on the i jident was handed to the Soviet Government by the Persian Ambassador at Moscow on or about 23rd March but no satisfactory reply has been received. The incident docs not appear to be of great importance, but considerable publicity has been given to it as the Persian authorities appear to consider that -this may be the best way of replying to Soviet ta#tios. Though the Russian Ambassador informed the Persian Government a few days ago that orders had been issued to the local Soviet Commander concerned to hand back the 2 prisoners, no report had been received in Tehran up to midday 5 th April that this had yet been done. 7• Incident on Azerbaijan frontier . An incident also occurred on the Azerbaijan frontier some 40 miles NNW of Ardebil on 2nd April. The affair started, according to the Persian C.G. S. , by ooviet troops opening fire on a small Porsia.n patrol moving between two frontier posts near a village named Ganich Bulagh, which is not marked on the map but is situated at map reference UU1605* Fire was returned and both sides brought up local reinforcements. A considerable number of armed Shah Savan tribesmen also quickly arrived to help the Persian regular frontier troops. Fire continued to bo exchanged from noon till 6 pm on 2nd April but must have been of a somewhat desultory nature as Persian casualties were only two soldiers and 1 tribesman wounded. Towards evening both sides appear to have considered that the inclement weather called for a ceasefire, and though the local political officers from each side could not agree as to who had started the affair, there has so far been no renewal of the firing. Nothing heavier than light automatic weapons were employed in the encounter. A protest on this incident has been lodged by the Persians through diplomatic channels. Incidents involving exchange of shots between Persian and Soviet soldiers took pla#e in the sane region, where the frontier is not clearly demarcated, in October last year and again in January this year. (luA’s Summary No.l para 11 refers). r- 8 . Lecture by Persian C.g.S. On 18th March General Raznara, the Persian C.G.S*, gave a lecture on n thc security of the country and the duty of Iranians”, The lecture was attended by some 2000 people including a number of Ministers and Majlis deputies. General Raznara urged Persians to exert themselves to solve the difficulties of their country and not to rely on foreigners doing it for them. Ho stressed that every foreigner remained a foreigner and that one was no better than another. Though some parts of his lecture appeared to show an anti- foreign bias, there does not appear to have been anything out of keeping with the exhortations of an energetic pr.triot urging his countrymen to shake off dull sloth and to do something themselves to improve the country’s condition. On the subject of security he spoke of the devotion of the Shah to his^ •oun'try, and said that Persians should have fa.ith in what is now being done to improve the country’s security. 9 « i'j.ierican equipnent, The military equipment from America continues to arrive satisfactorily. A number of 105mm guns have been landed but instruments and staff equipment for them appear to have been shipped separately so that the guns are not yet ready to be put into action. Seven Dakotas are expOftcd to arrive in Tehran tomorrow, these being the first of the new aircraft to arrive for the Persian Air Force. /to. .*4- Zlli t # • t INTERNAL SECURITY. Kurds* ■» Reports or rumours of the formation in the Lebanon of a Committee, v/ith the aim of establishing an indepedant Kurdistan, have been commented #n with some indignation in the Press which claims that Persian Kurdistan is one of the oldest parts of Persia. A Deputy from Kurdistan affirmed in the Majlis recently that the Kurds had no wish to sever themselves from Persia and a number of telegrams have been received by the Government from Kurdish leaders expressing their loyalty to Persia and their regard for the Shah. There does not appear to be much sign of unrest amongst the Kurds of Persia at present, though it is probable that some Soviet inspired propaganda is being carried on, and a few Kurds were arrested a few weeks ago at Mahabad. At the same time the Persian Kurds are resentful of Government neglect of Kurdish problems and pay considerable attention to the Kurdish broadcasts from Baku and the Free Democrat radios. Prom accurate and up-to-date reports which these radios put out about snail events in Persian Kurdistan it seems clear that there is some rapid means of communication between Persian i Kurdistan and the U.S.S.R. 11. Trial of Tudch leaders. The trial of ex-Tudeh leaders, journalists and others arrested after the attempt on the Shah's life have continued, the Military Courts, unlike most other officials, allowing themselves only one day’s holiday at the New Year. Appeals by journalists against their sentences have in several cases led to increases in terms of imprisonment, and in others to a reduction. Sentences on the v/hole have not been particularly severe, one of the heaviest being that of 6 years hard labour passed on the writer of a seditious article on the assassination of Nasir-ud-din Shah, written for the special (unpublished) edition of the Tudeh party paper of 3rd February. The total number of arrests in the country now amount to just over 650 . COMMUNICATIONS. 12. Internal Air Mail service for parcels. According to Press reports the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs recently concluded a contract with tho Civil Aviation Club of Tehran for an a.ir parcel post service for which two routes have been investigated. One of the proposed routes is in the North-west and includes deliveries to Tabriz, Ramadan and Kernanshah. The other covers six ports between Abadan and Chahbar along the coast of the Persian Gulf. The scheme is not likely to operate for several months and its capacity will in any event be small. 13♦ Interruption of rail traffic. As a result of extremely heavy rain towards the end of March the railv/ay line between Ahwaz and Khorramshahr has been cut by floods. The line between Kazvin and Zenjan was also cut for a short period but passenger traffic on this section was resumed early this month. 14* Road Iranshahr - Chahbar. According to a recent statement by an engineer working on the road Iranshahr - Chahbar a great deal of damage has been done by floods this spring. He was not at all encouraging on the progress of the road and even doubted whether it would be open to traffic this year. This information is not in accord with that reported in M.A’s Summary No.4 para 16, but the discrepancy may largely be attributable to damage by ^ain.ECONOMIC. 15-^ Imperial Bank. Re f o re nee IRA's Summary R o. 3 para 1 5 • Discussions botvmun thm Persian authorities and Sir Kinahan Cornwallis on behalf of the T .p-rial Bank of Iran were concluded during the first half of March, and Sir Kinahan returned to the United Kingdom* Following these discussions the Cabinet issued a decree which came into force on 21st March,(the beginning of the Persian New Year- regulating the activities of foreign banks in Persia. By this decree foreign banks are required to leave with the National Bank at least 55^ of all their deposits without interest. Maximum deposits retained by Foreign Banks must not exceed 2j times the total capital they employ in Persia, including a valuation of their properties. Branches may not be maintained without the specifi* approval of the Cabinet. The Imperial Bank will thus continue to operate in Persia though under much less advantageous conditions than before, and it appears probable that the Bank will be permitted to continue to maintain existing branches. 16. A.I.O.C. Reference IRA’s Summary No.4 para 19» Negotiations between representatives of the A.I.O.C. and the Persian Government were interrupted for a few weeks over the Persian New Year and the A.I.O.C. representatives returned to England. They have just returned back to Tehran to resume negotiations. MISCELLANEOUS. 17« Austrian Minister. It Wildner, the Austrian Minister at Ankara, has recently also been accredited to Tehran. He arrived in Tehran recently for a brief visit and to present his credentials. 18. New Year Salaam. The usual New Year ceremony was held in the Gulistan Palace on 21st March, when the Heads of Foreign Missions and 'embers of their staffs assembled before H.I.LR The Shah. Unlike last year, the Russian Ambassador this time attended the salaam. APPOINTMENTS. 19* Military.

Review of events. The Constituent Assembly was opened by H. I.K. The Shah on 21st April. There is indication of some opposition to the Assembly from religious quarters. The Fajlis has been mainly occupied during the last three weeks in hearing throe interpellations at the end of which the G-ovcrnment, on 30th April, obtained a vote of confidence by a largo majority. No new frontier incidents have been reported. The closing of Soviet consulates continues. The trial of Tudch loaders ax'id others has been completed in some towns and as a result military government has ceased there, but in most towns it is still in force. Tho curfew has been lifted in Tehran and in several other places. Floods seriously'- interrupted communications in the first half of April and still continue to do so in some parts of the country. 2. Constituent Assembly. On 21st April the Shah drove in the State coach with a lancer escort to open the Constituent Assembly. This is the first time the present Shah has used the State -coach. In his speech from the throne the Shah referred to the lack of balance between the executive, the legislature and the judiciary, to v/hich lack of balance he attributed the present condition of the country and which had decided him to convene the Constituent Assembly. He now hoped that the Deputies would fulfill their mission and thus lay the foundation for a prosperous, free and democratic country. The activities-of the Assembly have so far been limited to electing its own officers, Sayyid Kuhammad Sadiq Tabatabai having been elected President. Saham Sultan Bayat and Hassan Ali Kamal Hidayat were elected Vice-Presidents. Commissions were also appointed to examine the credentials of deputies. There is some opposition to the Constituent Assembly from religious quarters, fanned perhaps by'the recent circulation of a leaflet allegedly signed by Kashani from abroad, attacking the Assembly and the Shah. The opposition appears to be partly due to fear that the assembly nay do something against the Moslem religion, but it is believed the Shah intends that its activities shall be confined to the tasks for which it was invoked and reassurances to this effect were given by the Prime minister last week when he addressed the Assembly on the task which had been set out for them. The Prime Minister said the Shah should have the power to dissolve the two Houses, but at the same time he should be required to fix a near date for the new elections. 3 . G-overnnont into roe lie, t ions and vote of confidence^. On 30th April, on conclusion of the interpellations of Maki, Dr Baqa 1 i and Hairizadch, Sa’ed’s Government received a vote of confidence by the excellent majority of 90 votes in favour from the 96 Deputies present. „ The interpellations which were due to begin on 10th but were postponed for lack of a quorum till 12th April, occupied most of the time of the Majlis till the end of the month. Maki claimed that the action of the i inister of War~2~ in suppressing newspapers and in exiling Kashani, the religious loader, for actions alleged to have been comitted before the imposition of martial law was illegal. ^ Dr Baqa'i then began a speech which lasted nearly two weeks and was then only brought to an end by pressure from the Speaker, Baqa’i still protesting that interruptions had prevented him from saying much of what he had wished to say. After reading an open letter he had v/ritton to the Shah (but which he could get no paper to publish) complaining that there was no liberty left in Persia, he somewhat irrelevantly attacked two Army Colonels, one of whom was prosecutor at some of the recent trials. The Minister of the Interior was attacked as being a proteg6 of the court while the Chief of the General Staff, General Razmara, came in for considerable abuse. Dr Baqa 1 i insinuated that Razmara was implicated in the murder of the newspaper editor Massoudi, a year ago, in order to prevent publication of a letter which would have revealed his (Razmara’s) treasonable activity. The C.G.S. was also accused of interference in civil affairs. The Minister of War made a suitable defence of Razmara and read a letter from him denying all the accusations, while the Minister of the Interior got his own ba*k on Dr Baqa’i by accusing him of embezzlement. Hairizadeh, who followed, made particular mention of the improper way the elections had been carried out and to the restrictions imposed on Kashani. While Baqa'i is generally regarded as somewhat irresponsible there is little doubt that the abuse he throws on various officials have a considerable effect on public opinion. 4• Th e Majl is. The Majlis has been so occupied with the interpellations that it has had time to attend to little else. On 7th April, however, the Minister of the Interior informed the Majlis that he was withdrawing the Senate bill, which had already been tabled, and was substituting another, for which he asked single urgency. This was agreed to and the bill was submitted to a Commission. A bill regarding the retirement of civil servants was then, approved, which shoiAd enable the Government to retire about ^0yOOO civil servants and so to increase efficiency and reduce costs. On 16 th i».pril the Prime Minister told the Majlis that it had been wasting its time with interpellations which profited no one but the foreigner. The same day it was agreed, on the suggestion of the Spea.ker, that the Majlis should meet in the afternoon as well as the morning for the next few days. At a private session of the Majlis held on 28th April the Speaker, according to a Press report, deplored the fact that the Majlis had accomplished nothing positive and said they had only three months left in which to pass some useful measures. The Speaker added that the internal regulations of the Majlis needed amendment. On 18th April the Majlis approved the bill for a provisional two-twelfths of the Budget for the current year. MILITARY. 5. Turkoman Frontier incident. Reference M.A's Summary No.6 para 6. The two Persian soldiers captured by Soviet troops near Neftilja on 20th March have now been returned with their arms. The body of the soldier who was killed has also been returned and is believed to have been buried by the Persians on the spot where the incident occurred. The Soviet embassy is believed to have expressed regret for the incident and took the opportunity of stating that no new Soviet post had been established in the area. This was presumably intended to rectify the erroneous impression created by some rather wild statements which appeared in certain foreign newspapers as a result of exaggerated reports by the Associated Press correspondent in Tehran.6. Aircraft firocl on. On 10th April an unidentified aircraft was fired on by the garrison of Banch in Kurdistan. Rumours of Soviet aircraft carrying out flights over Persian territory resulted, but the C.G-.S. stated that investigation showed the aircraft to bo a K.L.M. plane somewhat off its course owing to bad weather. The Baneh garrison is cut off by snow for nearly 6 months of the year so might be excused for creating some relief from what must be a very monotonous existence. 7. Anti-t ank gu ns for Persian i. rmy. The Persian General Staff is anxious that some of the first, hundred 6-pounder anti-tank guns, which arc being purchased.by the Persian Army from the War Office, shall be shipped as early as possible to allow a cadre of instructors to be trained. It is understood that these guns are now ready in the U.K. for shipment, and it is hoped they will arrive during June. The intention of the Persian General Staff at present is to have a platoon of 6 of these guns in each of Persia’s thirtyone infantry regiments. The total order of 200 guns therefore allows only 14 reserve. The vehicle v/ith which to tow the 6-pounder gun has not yet boon decided. 8. Vehicles f or Pers ian /t rmy_._ The Persian ^rmy has placed an ord^r for 40 'Land Rovers' through the local agent for Rover cars in Tehran. These vehicles are intended for the military police. The Land Rover created a good impression here when its performance was shewn to certain senior officers of the Persian Army in Tehran recently, and there is a possibility of a further and much larger order for these vehicles being given. Unfortunately, however, two senior officers in the Ministry of War arc believed to be Directors of the agency for Jeeps and to be urging the purchase of Jeeps instead of Land Rovers, on the ground that the Jeep is cheaper. 9. Army Education. Some publicity was recently given in the Press to the Army’s efforts to teach the Persian conscript to read and write. This was occasioned by a ceremony at the H.Q. of the mechanised artillery brigade, attended by the Minister of Education, when diplomas were given to those who had passed certain education tests. General Khosrovani, one of the Deputy Chiefs of the General Staff, said that each year 40,000 soldiers arc taught to read and v/rite. While this is probably an exaggeration, it does appear that increased attention is being given to education in the Persian Army. General Motazedi, commanding the 6th Division in Shiraz, recently claimed in conversation with the H.A. that nearly all men in his Division could read and write by the time they left the army. 10. Signals from Sovi et ves sol. according to information given to H.I..Consul, Resht, a Soviet vessel flashed signals to the shore near Pahlevi on the night 1/2 April. Colonel Daftari, the Senior Naval Officer at Pahlevi, apparently believed this to be true and told II.M.Consul that he would put to sea if anything similar occurred again. When, however, on the ni ht 22/23 April signals from a boat on the Caspian were reported as communicating with the Soviet Vice- Consulate at Pahlevi, Colonel Daftari evidently thought discretion the better part of valour and took no action. Thu following day he reversed his account of the first incident ;ivon earlier to H.M.Consul and said the whole scare had been caused by a fishing boat.11 . Persian Navy. -4~ L snail party of officers of the Persian Navy left Tehran a few aays ago for the U.K. to join the two naval frigates which the Royal Navy aro shortly to bring to Persia. These vessels arc being given to the Persian Navy m conformity with the agreement reached last year with the Persian oyernnent in regard to compensation for their naval losses caused by us in 1941• J 12# Service Attaches . Lieut-Colonel SINGH arrived in Tehran a few days ago as the first Military Attache to the Indian Embassy. He is accompanied by his wife. The Swedish n.A. from Ankara, Lieut-Colonel Pale P:Son Human, who is also M.A. for.Persia, is.at present in Tehran on ^ visit of about a month’s duration, during which time he proposes to tour Azerbaijan and the Caspian provinces, ihe Americans now have an Assistant Naval Attache, Major Ploweriee, resident 1 + 4 - TC ? ran ^ -, iie arrived with his v/ifc early in April. The American Naval gtachc. Colonel I,oilier, is resident in Baghdad, but visits Tehran fron tine ■ tme. ihc Chinese i-.i^ , Colonel F.C.Lew, is leaving; his appointnent and returning to China in a few weeks time. 13. Pakistan frontier. -‘-here .v/as a slight difference of opinion earlier in the year between the Persian and Pakistan frontier troops in regard to a tower located at Qaleh Safid near liirjawa on the frontier between Persian and Pakistan Baluchistan. The tower belongs to Pakistan and was previously occupied by a few frontier guards from Pakistan. These later vacated the .ower whereupon Persian frontier troops occupied it, claiming that the tower is located just inside Persian territory. According to the Persian C.G.S. an amicable agreement was later reached whereby neither side occupied the tower anc. the Persian troops accordingly vacated it. 1if * jfojlis approve funds for pu rc hase of ammunition . Reference H.A* s Summary No.2 para 4. The 2/l2ths provisional ueget,.passec by the 1 ajlis on 18th April included an annexe for the appropriation of £2 million for the purchase ofsmall arms ammunition and for the repair of the Arr.y factories in Tehran. INTERNAL SECURITY. 13* Trials of Tudeh lead ers. nri .. q, , y he n ^ ±e -} of Tudoh l Gad crs and others implicated in the attempt 'T, c ‘ 13 nOV/ noardnr ' completion. According to the C.G.S. rather more than half of those arrested have sin«o been set at liberty, and about 300 have either been sentenced or are still awaiting trial. In several owns the trials are now complete, and military government }yis accordingly ceased, as m Kerman and.several towns in the Caspian provinces. V/here' c.ppeals have been made military government is kept in force until the appeals have been disposed of. as in Shiraz where sentences have been pronounced ^ hc caseof all 12 accused, the maximum sentence being 4 years imprison ment but where appeals still have to be heard. In Tehran, after the tho ' i rud ; e prohibiting assemblies aggin came into for»e, but t wares the end of. the month the curfew was lifted, as it also was in Shiraz and several other towns. Sentences passed on Tudeh leaders in Tehran of^wi Se ^ ral s ^. tencos of 1° y cars solitary confinement and others f ^ y c -rs. The verci.ts on the 9 persons accused of complicity in t0 i as ? assanatG tho s ^ah were announced at midnight 28/29th April. Abdullah iirkani and Husain Haj Parajullah were found guilty of participation m the plot and were sentenced to death. Five others were acauitted of thi^ char ^0 but found guilty of oonplicity in a ninor role in to pS and /sentenced. . . .-5- scntenrod to toms of hard labour, in one ease for life, solitary confinement or imprisonment. Two of the accused were acquitted on both charges. Those condemned are entitled to appeal. ^dolf Pantz, the Czechoslovak student arrested at the University at the time of the attempt on the Shah’s life, has been ordered to leave Persia. 1 6 . Tudeh activity - A.I.O.C. Following the attempt on the Shah's life a number of arrests were made in Abadan and oilfields. Several persons in Abadan and Maajid-i- Suleinan were released on signing documents to the effect that they will take no further part in Tudeh activities. H.2i.Consul-General, Ahwaz, reports that cell meetings of the Tudeh party still continue, but cells have been reduced in size and very short notice of the time and place of cell meetings is given to members. The party is still without direction from Tehran and appears to be marking time. Tudeh pamphlets are reported to have been discovered at Agha Javi, who re a few arrests were made, but none at Behbehan cr G-ach Saran. 17* Tribal - Khuzistan. The total number of arms handed over to the Government by the Kuhgalu tribe at Gach Saran is said to be about 1450, but this may well be an exaggeration. In addition, 350 rifles and 10 light autonatifs were handed over by Boir Ahmed Soufla under the Khanship of Abdulla Sarghanpur. Security in Khuzistan in general has been reasonably good recently though some robberies have been reported in the area of Arab tribes. 18. Pars. Security in Pars has improved of late though the G-.O.C. Pars Division states that there arc still some gangs who hide in the mountains in that region v/here it is almost impossible to find them, and make periodic raids on to the roads. In much of the tribal areas Gendarmes are non-existent and security is probably better maintained by the tribal Khans in their own area than it would be by small isolated detachments of Gendarmerie lacking mobility. On some of the minor roads the shell of a Gendarmerie post destroyed by the tribes a few years ago is a common sight. The Qashqai were just starting their move to their summer quarters near Semirun when the II.A. traversed several roads in the Shiraz area between 18th and 22nd April. Sheep, goats, camels, donkeys and ponies blocked the passes and made it extremely difficult for a car to pass, though flocks were turned aside where possible with good humour. Few rifles were in evidence, though that does not necessarily mean that few exist. The Qashqai on the whole are prosperous at present and in recent years have very greatly increased the size of their flocks which are now said to number between 3 a nd 4 million. C02I1UNI CATIONS. 19* New road Tehran - Savch. A new road between Tehrah and Saveh (80 miles south-west of Tehran) is under construction. .Garth work is complete for approximately the first 20 miles from Tehran; some preliminary earthwork and marking of the alignment is evident over the next 30 miles, whilst the last 30 miles show no signs of work. The road is remarkable for its straightness, the line in some instances cutting through villages and estates, and for the care taken in avoiding gradients in excess of 1 in 20. The foundations are some 25' in width sq that a 20' roadv/ay is probably intended. Pre-cast concrete culvert pipes are disposed along its length indicating an unusual regard for the necessary drainage. The alignment generally conforms to that of the old road and is in no |ase more than 4 miles from it. It is too early yet to state the final surface, but stone soling with a gravel finish is likely. /20« I - 6 - 20. Road Burujird - Nc-havand - Bidsurkh Pr.ss. The road between point OH 6if84 nap I®-3® ^ J ) on the road Ke mans hah - Hanadan and point 0J 3646 (^2 nap 1-39 G-) on the road Malayer - Burujird is under classified on the 1942 edition 4' nap. The road is nowhere less than 20' wide, netalled and without any severe gradients or bends. The three najor bridges on the route (OH 9670; OH 8676 ; 0H6882) are all at least Class (40) and probably Class (70) After rain difficulty at the approaches of two of these bridges is experienced due to nud, but all traffic nornally succeeds in getting through. The route is used by I.O.C. tankers and heavy oonnercial traffic. It is usually open in winter even when the ,*ssadabad Pass between Kernansha.h and Hanadan is closed by snow. Nahavand,a snail squalid town, has no nilitary garrison. Road nctal, labour and a little tinb^r are availahlo near the road. 21• Floods. Considerable interruption to connunications in many parts of the country was caused by floods early in April. The nost seriousi were in Khuzistan and Seistan. The railway and nornal road between Ahwaz and Khorranshahr have been cut nearly all the nonth, but vehicles have recently been using the Tanoonah diversion into Iraq by consent of the government of that country. This roughly doubles the tine taken for the journey by the direct route. It is likely to be sone tine before the railway is repaired. The railway bridge over the Shur Rud between Tehran and Qun was thought to be in danger of being sv/ept away but repairs to one of the piers was carried out before 'the damage v/as too great and traffic continued after a brief interruption. In the Isfahan area the Zayandeh Rud overflowed its banks and flooded several villages. In the Zabul area of S.E. Persia extensive areas were flooded by the Helnand river and the population already threatened by starvation by earlier drought are now likely to lose by floods the few crops which they have. The road Tehran - He shed was broken between Abbasabad and Kuhak, and the roads from Kernan to Rafsinjan and to Sirjan v/ere rendered impassable for a tine. 22. Railway Qun - Kashan. The railway line between Qun and Kashan is now reported to be almost complete and the opening ceremony is expected to take place next nonth. 23. Railway Julfa - Tabriz. According to information ruceived by h.!.. Consul- General Tabriz from an employee of the Persian railways, the U.S.S.R. agreed in the middle of ^pril to return 23 out of the 34 goods wagons taken away by then onthe^ collapse of the Democrat regime in Azerbaijan. The ‘military authorities m Tabriz are believed to have taken the precaution earlier in the year of ordering the withdrawal, at least as far south as Marand, of goods wagons m the neighbourhood of Julfa. 24. Railway se ttlenent♦ In one of the annexes of the 2/l2ths Budget passed curing April the Majlis authorised the Government to settle on its own responsibility the Persian claims against the Allies for the use of railways and other installations during the war. As a result it is hoped that the Persian Government will soon formally agree to accept the sum of £5*7 million pounds in full settlement. The Railways have already drawn up a plan for the immediate expenditure of a large part of this amount for badly needed equip ment. Meanwhile, the 60 cases of spares, paid for curing the war, and lying ready for shipment in Germany, are still being held up by the allied control who insist on payment being made again. These spares would enable 60 German locomotives of the I.S.R. now nearly out 01 co mission, to - c kept in operation. /ECONOMIC. .« SCONOI/JC. .^25. A»I.O.C. negotiations. Sir William Fraser, Chairman of the Bocard of Directors of the A. I.O.C. , arrived in Tehran a few days ar*o to continue negotiations of the Persian Government in regard to*the concession. There are signs that the Persian Government representatives are beginning to adopt a more realistic attitude than hitherto, but progress has been extremely slow. 26. Economic Council. On 3rd April the Cabinet published a decree constituting an Economic Council which is to meet every two weeks and co-ordinate all the economic activities of the Government. The Council is presided over by the Prime Minister and includes the Ministers of Finance, National Economy, Agriculture and Labour, the Governors of the National, Industrial and Agricultural Banks, the Chairman of the provisional organisation of the 7 Year Plan. It remains to be seen what effective action the Council takes. 2?. Irrigation schemes- Fars . Three plans for the improvement of irrigation in the Shiraz area are reported by S‘.H.Consul at Shiraz to have been accepted im principle and likely to be put into operation. These schemes arc:- (a) The Shishpir scheme for the supply of water to Shiraz itself. Shishpir is about 60 miles north west of Shiraz and near Ardakan. The landowners between Shiraz and Shishpir are strongly opposed to the scheme as they fear it will take water away from their lands. A tender, however, has been accepted for the work and it appears likely to begin soon. (b) The Mervdasht scheme involving digging of wells near the sugar factory at Mervdasht to improve the irrigation of part of the Mervdasht plain. It is believed that digging has already started. (•) ’The Daraks scheme (about 70 miles east of Fasa) involving the damning of the Rudbah river. The landowners here are proving helpful, as they themselves will reap the benefit, and have agreed to bear a share of the cost. MISCELLANEOUS. 28• Visits by Commonwealth Prime Minister. The Prime Minister of Pakistan is expected to arrive in Tehran for a short visit at the end of this week on his way back from the Commonwealth Conference. An invitation has also been extended to the Prime Minister of Ceylon. 29* Earthquake. According to the Press a severe earthquake sho«k was felt at Bandar Abbas on the doming of 24th ^pril and tremors continued during the day. Considerable damage was done but only one death is reported. 30. Czechoslovak Charge d*Affaires. Reuter* s recently reported that the recall of the Czechoslovak Charge d*Affaires, Richard Slansky, had been requested by the Persian Govern ment. The Persian Government officially denied this in a rather vague way but there seems no doubt that the report in fact is correct. The Persian /Government. . .•iL * - 8 - Govcrmcnt aro believed to have asked for a Minister to be appointed in plaie of Slansky who was not looked on with favour for three reasons. First, ^ because he is the brother of the Secretary-General of the Corxiunist Party in Czechoslovakia; secondly because ho arrived in Tehran as Counsellor and later assumed charge; thirdly it is possible that the Persian Government had some evidence of his having boen engaged in doubtful activities. 31. Persian journalists visit to dngla nd. The editors of 3 Persian newspapers left for England on 28th April on a visit arranged by the British Embassy Information Department. 32. Soviet Ambassador. On 15 th April Sadtchikov, the Soviet Ambassador, left Tehran for Moscow by way of Pahlevi and Baku. Kis sudden departure has naturally given rise to some conjecture in the Press as to its reasons. His wife remains in Tehran. 33* Foreign Ministers credentials. Klemens Wildner, the Austrian Minister, normally resident in Ankara, and Petar Rakichovic, the new Yugoslav Minister, presented their letters of credence to the Shah on 7th April# lEPFOIHTiDNTS. 3A» Civil . (a) Abul Path Valatabar (Hishmat-ud-Dauleh) .hAS^been appointed Governor-General of Azerbaijan in place of Fahini who, as previously reported, was recently appointed Minister without portfolio in Sa'ed’s Government. (b) The Press reports the recall of Hamid Sayah from Moscow and the appointment of Nadir Arasteh, the present Minister of Communications, as Ambassador to the Soviet Union in his place• 35* Polioe. (a) Major Faridzadeh became Chief of Police Khorranshahr in March in place of Lieut. Gudarzi who has been transferred to his former post at ^badan. (b) Brigadier Iravani has been appointed Head of the Police Judicial section in place of Colonel Hasan Nakha’i who has retired.
