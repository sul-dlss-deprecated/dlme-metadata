(D ABADAN . Mr. Gass advised that he would like to discuss with me hefore I went to Bahrein the Abadan food problem and -I accordingly left Baghdad by A.I.O.C. plane on June 5th. Discussions followed with .General Lindsell, L.G.A. designate, and the A.I.O.C. - The General was not unfavourably disposed to the proposal that Abadan should be put on the Tenth Army ration strength and draw other goods and drink from N.A.A.P.I. - The G.O.C. Tenth Army had already declined co meet the A.I.O.C. request for emergent supplies. General Lane who was due to visio Cairo on June 9th was made au fait with the position. I left Basra at dawn on June 8th and arrived at:- BAHRBIN two and a half hours later. I was met by Mr. Anderson, acting G.M. of 3.A.P.C.O. , who kindly put me up in his bungalow in the air-conditioned camp at Awali. I visited the Political Agent. He told me that Deience Regulation No.2, o therwise known as the Industrial Conscription_ Act. , had recently been put into force and the Bntisn subjects and British Protected persons could now be held to their posos. — American subjects would be controlled by Col. Johnson, the American Representative in India, through the P.A. The P.A. remarked that the Regulation had been accepted calmly, though he had been anxious about the attitude which the Canadians might adopt. Supplies of foodstuffs particularly rice and flour is causing grave concern to the P.A. and aiieco tne Indian employees of B.A.PX.O. and C.A.S.O.C. wlio buy supplies in the Town. - Most of Bahrein’s food is imported from India and export control^ had failed owing to the abuses to which it gave rise. It is now intended to allot quotas, and the P.A. hoped that aided by a new subsidy in kind to Saudi Arabia, into which he seemed prepared to dip in dire emergency, the food problem might improve. Later I discussed with the P.A. the question of^ authority for a British Army officer to plan the demolition ox Ras Tanura Refinery and other C.A.S.O.C. plant in neutral Saudi Araoia. C.A.S.O.C. had represented that before assistance was givaito such an officer the American Minister in Cairo and the British Minister in Jeddah should be acquainted and the necessary authority given oo the Companv to assist the officer in his investigations. The C.A.S.O.C. officials are anxious not to jeopardise their concessions during or after the War; tneir relations with King Ibn Saud are at present most cordial and the King is a very friendly neutral. . . ^ The P.A.Bahrein controlled the movement of all persons from Bahrein to Arabia and officers are required to go dressed as civilians. A telegram was sent to Mr. lunkley at Cairo. I visited Mr. Packer of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. Two wells have found oil at Qatar, the third has recently drilled into salt water, and the fourth is expected to spud in in about two months time. There are twelve to fifteen Europeans at ^ * tiajor Boaden had investigated denial measures j.or tne wells, and these had been agreed with the Company. t think that the Petroleum Department should again consider the utility of further drilling at Qatar at the present k time. A-hnnt/J r - 2 - *■ t irae/ About 70wells have been drilled at Bahrein, and under the denial scheme about 30 of these wells on the centre of the structure will be left as producers. The placing oi cement plugs in wells is proceeding satisfactorily, assisted by some drillers^ from C.A.S.O.C. Mr. Anderson is still averse to permanent junking of any wells. Refinery throughput had recently been reduced to 22,000^ barrels per day from 35&gt;000 barrels on orders from Hew fork. itny substantial reduction causes concern owing to probable reactiona by Ibn Baud and the Sheikh of Bahrein. Mr. Belgrave, Adviser to the Sheikh of Bahrein,told me that though the Sheikh was paid half yearly, he enquired more often about tne figures of crude output. I was told that Ibn Saud was paid royalty quarterly and also took an interest in his royalty. Anti-Sabotage measures consist 01 the installation of choke valves in tubing and an increase in guards an! patrols. The present staff consists of:- Americans 32. Canadians 22. British 126. Indians 239 . Total 419. British women 44• ” children 38* * Total payroll 2934, including about 1000 engaged on sheathing tanks. The future food supply for white staff is beginning oo cause anxiety as the South African authorities have demanded information before shipping goods : Overall there is 6 mon ns stock. Rationing schemes were being investigated. The Indians are not catered for by tne Company, and ar dependent on Bahrein supplies. Much time v/as spent visiting the Refinery and discussing the programme of tank protection : this has been dealt witn uy telegram, a copy of which is attached. I also enclose a plan showing the Refinery tankage. ron I am surprised that B.A.P.C.O. should have assessed tanks as of equal^importance; for it is obvious tnat the Process +anks which are congested and adjacent to the Refinery operatii equipment deserve treatment before the more remote storage tanks and this B.A.P.C.O. now admit. ^ -n ^ nre The R.E., from General Taylor the M.G.R.^. downwards, are not convinced of the need for invariably sheathing tanks to lull height, and information on this point based on actual experiences of bombing would be welcome. , . ^ Work has progressed very satisfactorily ^o date on excavation and foundations, and all cement and a consideraole quantitv of bricks have already arrived. . „ . n Accounting for this and other past and present P.A.D. work and denial measures was discusseu. ) p w t? for A conv of the recommendations of the jJ.o.k.-j. iox additional P.A.D. Works, viz. blast walls, at an estimated cos of £5000 is attached. SAUDI A RABIA . I crossed to Saudi Arabia in a dhow on June 9th and was most hospitably cared for by Mr.Davis m the C.A.S.O.C. caap at Dhahran. 23 walls have been drilled on the Dammam fieid^it.is • 4 . -nino* off with cement all bui A oi o now ^Lr discussion with the C.A.S.O.C. Head Office who are* 'S. . - . • • . . . * . . ..... • ^ • • • • ' ' . . . . . • ' • . ' - a : - .U .... . c . . . . . . •yr who are/ inclined to think at present that 8 producers could be left. The plugging is being done with the consent of the King. Average depth of wells is 4500 feet and drilling is difficult. The gas separators have been protected by walls, and such protection to the stab plant and other vital equipment is in hand. Bunsen Burners have been installed for the disposal of surplus gas and the venting of such gas to atmosphere is under consideration. Guards and patrols on the lease have not been increased since the War : these are under G-overnment control. Loading ghats are at A1 Khobar and at Port A1 Aziziyah, 7 miles to the South; the latter ghat is usually used as the haul by barge to Zellaq on Bahrein Island is shorter : there are two 15,000 barrel tanks at the jetty which it is not intended to sheath; even if these tanks were put out of action loading could continue though at a slower rate. The 3000 barrel Refinery at Has Tabura, 60 miles from Dhahran, is shut down : I did not visit it - It must contain much idle tankage. Staff at Dhahran is homogeneous, namely about 110 Americans : the only women are 2 nursing sisters. Stocks of food and drink are adequate meantime, but like B.A.P.C.O. a rationing scale is under consideration. C.A.S.O.C. have recently lost at sea half a years 1 supply of lub oil for themselves and the West coast of Arabia* The position regarding the supply of certain sizes of tyres is also causing anxiety. There is a shortage of drums for distribution of oil in Arabia, and it was intended to investigate the feasibility of drawing on the vast stocks of Italian returnables said to exist in Abyssinia and Eritrea. I returned to Bahrein by dhow on June 10th. On June 11th I visited the R.A.P. landing ground, and the Naval Base where I met the officers in charge. ^ Nothing of importance emerged in my discussions with these ox-icers* I also met Major Hewitt, Defence officer of the Persian G-ulf, whose title is likely soon to be changed. It is probable that an Indian infantry Batalion will be posted to Bahrein, the majority of which will be stationed near the Refinery. I took the opportunity of telling B.A.P.C.O. and C.A.S.O.C* of Indian needs of material and asked them to advise me if they could assist. I left Bahrein by air on June 12th and arrived Basra that evening : several evacuees from the Burma Oilfields v/ere aboard en route to Abadan. BASRA . On June 13th I called upon Mr. Lock of the M.W.T. and the R.E. to discuss supply and transport of bricivs to Bahrein and left Basra for Bagdad that night.
