IP To Sir, His Excellency the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain. I have the honour to address you on the subject of local reaction to the visits of war ships of the United At States to/waters of this Agency. It may be useful here to recapitulate these visits since that of U.S.S. 'Toledo' last year. The following table shows the visits since then j U.S.S. 'Toledo' Bahrain 10th to 13th May, 1947. U.S.S. 'Rendova' and U.S.S. 'C.H, Bosn' Bahrain 19th to 21st May, 1948. O.S.S. 'Greenwich Bay' 27th to 29th July, 1948 29th July to 3rd August, 1948. 17th to 20th August, 1948 25th to 29th August, 1948. Sharjah Bahrain U^S.^pell^U' Qatar Bahrain WtSjk aMfcwMp Bahrain 26th to 28th August, 1948. It will be remembered also that Admiral Connolly, with a large staff, visited Bahrain both in 1947 and in 1948, (from the 11th to the 13th Hay, 1947 and from ti e 2nd to the 3rd September, 1948). 2. The officers arid crews of all these ships were entertained suitably by the local British representatives, the Royal Navy, and the British and American communities. This-2- This, however, has no particular significance except in so far as it goes to foster friendly relations between the British and the Americans. 3, To the few Bahrainis who think politically and above all to the Shai&gt;h and those about him in his ad ministration, these visits are the cause of much question ing, Not only has Admiral Connolly and his attendant admirals and staff and Vice-Admiral Duncan visited the Shaikh, but the Commander of every ship has Insisted on calling on His Highness, while he has entertained the officers of the U.S.S. 'Toledo* 1 and II.S.S. 'Siboney' to large Arab dinners. It seems unnecessary to refer to the traditional role of the Royal Navy in the Persian Gulf for the last 200 years to throw into relief the question raised in the Shaikh 1 s mind as to the reason for this continued display of American Naval power. The nearest he has gone to telling me that he does not like it is to say in reference to it that^and his people have always been quit© content with the Royal Navy alone. I think it is time that he be given at least an expla nation of the reason for the presence of the American ships here, 4. While on this subject, I think, I ought to bring to your attention that on the occasion of the recent visit of Admiral Connolly to Bahrain, the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, gave e luncheon party in his honour in his flagship, H.W.S. ,, v ,'lldgoose M , to which the Political Agent, Bahrain, was not Invited; while officeis ranking as Com manders end the Commanding Officer of a mere American Naval Tanker at anchor at Sitra were present. It is a pity that, while dealing with outsiders, this sort of dis courtesy-3- dlsccurtesy should mar the relations between our selves and the local Naval Representatives. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Agent, Bahrain1 (482/3/49) vA PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN. 8th November, 1949, yh/ ' &lt;S}. I forward herewith a copy of a telegram I have sent to the Political Agent, Kuwait about the United States survey aircraft.
