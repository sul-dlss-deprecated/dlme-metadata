To Mr. Creec^ Jones, Colonial Secretary, Colonial Office, London. r -'VEL Sir, ^■8 MAR /947 I and all the world know thaVTnw'Brrrish-v^y^r ^ r of Government and their orders with Justice are very strong. 25 years ago I myself have seen the proof of the strength of the British justice. Once a slave was beaten by his master in the city of of Shafcjah (Persian Gulf). The slave took oCf his clothes soaked with blood and sent to His Britannic ’vfajesty, the King of England appealing for justice. After^six months, suddenly a warship came from London and stayed in the port of Shatejah. The captian of the ship called the master and his slave and heard their statements. When the master denied tlie charge, the captian of the ship opened the box and showed him the clothes soaked with bloofi and said that it was the proof. The captian set the slave free and gave him some money for his expenses. - This is the British justice. I am submitting my case for your favourable consideration. I belong to Bahrain (Persian Gulf). My family is called Sheikh Ahmad Alherz;''Everyone* can tell you about my family i.e. Alherz. 25 years ago, our family was carrying on the work relating to Justice (Kazi), religious endowment, charity, waqf and orphanage. The Ruler of Bahrain was Sheikh Isa Bin Ali that time and then his son, Sheikh Hamid Bin Isa succeeded him. During the reign of these two sultans, we did all the work mentioned above with justice and impartiality. No cause of grievances was given to any body. Your consul, Major Cox, was these. He can testify it. V/hen we came to know that the British Govt, are making some reforms and changing the system of Government in my country, we were very pleased and handed over all the work which wex were carrying on for the last so many years to the Govt, without any hesitation. Inspite of this good gesture shown to the Govt., when Mr. C.D. Belgreve came to Bahrain as their Adviser, he neglected our rights and no attention was given to my family. We were treated as if we were slaves and the fame of our family was kffacfed. Our big persons died with privation and suffering and our big houses were collapsed. T x he family was ruined and there is no one to look after our children. There are only children and old women left in the Alherz family who were once renown/2 - renown in the whole of the Persian Gulf, They are unable to provide brend for themselves and for their children. In such circumstances, the education of the children are neglected and they are not being properly brought up. As an elder member of this family, I am writing to you in the hope that you will come to their rescure and relieve them of the trouble they have been put in. For long time I come to India for the purpose of trade of export of foodstuffs and textiles from India but I have no great credit in my account. The family , is big and income is very small, I am unable to support them all alone. griewaBees and grant monthly allowances to Ali Bin Sheikh Ahmad Alherz and his sister Abdul Ali who are the eldest and deserving members of Alherz family so that they may be v -i j j t J ~ v- ■* 4- 4 e prices of commodities while deciding for granting the allowances so that they may lead a happy life. I hope that my letter will receive a favourable consideration and I will receive a favourable reply as soon as possible, because the time Is very critical and we are in great distress. Please consider this matter yourself and do the favour to a family of 15 !iembers Do not send me to Mr. C.D. Belgreve or to other persons. Please arrange this matter yourself and do the needful. I and all my family pray for your long life and prosperity and have great admiration for great English paople. I hope that the Great Britain will remove our able to educate their children and improve the conditions of life.

I have to report that oft 5th, July, 1948, Ford lorry No. T. 930 2-o tons. 1936 model,' owned by Ahmed bin Ghareeb of L/uharraq was examinod by me, ; ahd as result of various mechanical defects, I decided that the vehicle was unsafe to be used on the road, and in such a condition as to be practically beyond repair. This lorry was purchased from the Bahrain Petrol- eum Company on 2nd June, 1947 by I.iasseh Behrooz Toorani of Manama. On 7th, January, 1948 the lorry was bought from Toorani by Ahmed bin Ghareeb and brought to the Fort for a technical examination. As result of the examination, Ahmed bin Ghareeb was informed that the vehicle could be used oh the road for one year from that date, after which it would have to be scrapped. Since that time, no attempt has been made to keep the vehicle in running order. neither hand or foot brake, no horn, all springs were broken and in a rusty condition, the front wheels were loose, all steering connections were loose and badly worn. hen the owner ifms told of the defects, he stated that he was too poor to have the lorry taxis and lorries, and a general check up is being carried out. Many vehicles have been taken off the road until' the mechanical defects haveheen put right. In a number of cases the vehicle has been scrapped. In nearly every case the owner states that he is too poor to have his vehicle repaired. to some mechanical defect in one or both of the vehicles, and a more thorough check appears necessary. When I examined the vehicle I found that it had repaired. He was told that the vehicle would be scrapped. There has been a considerable increase in buses.

P.J. Fleming, : 613, Bahrein Petroleum Co.Ltd., Yours faithfully H.G.Jakins Political Agent BahrainA . . &gt; ^ c • o t k/l-J- jl^. \. ^/himself There are no pps. in this office relating tp Mansur 2*? bin' Kacki Al-Hirz; but the following account as revealed by enquiries may be useful. Mansur bin Macki Al-Hirz is a Bahrain subject by ^ \ birth ii» that he was born in Jidhafs, a village some 4 to 5 miles in the south-westernly direction from Manamah. His^ ' • father Macki was of the middle class and died in 1334 Hejira i.e. about 32 years ago. He had two uncles, one named Haji Husain Al-Hirz who was a pearl broker and who died in 1337 ^ Hejira (29 years ago) and the other Shaikh Ahmad Al-Hirz, a Qazi of some reputation and influence over the Shi'a community who died in 1352 Hejira (about 14 years ago). , Mansur immigrated in 4335 Hejira (about 1916) to Bombay and there he engaged^to one Haji Yusuf bin Ali As-Sayigh, a pearl commission agent, as a clerk. The latter, in consideration of his hard work,married him to his, sister- in-law. He, however, divorced his wife after a few years, after he had got one daughter from her.- Papers regarding I his daughter who was married in Dubai Without his consent may be traced in the C.G. A Since his departure to India Mansur has been to Aahrain only once and that was in 1341 i.e. in 1932;and since then he has been living permanently in Bombay where he is said to be doing business. The relatives of Mansur who are about 20 in number (male and female) still live in their native village, Jidhafs. They have their own houses to live in and have some small pieces of palm-garden near that village. In addition, they have 'some old uninhabitable ruined houses in Jidhafs and their life on the whole is comparable with that of their fellow villagers - a hand to mouth life. 23 r D UA\t ^ fbr^s ft ny ~io/(o i &lt;A; ' £.&lt;?.
