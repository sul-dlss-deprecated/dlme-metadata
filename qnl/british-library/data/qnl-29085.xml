From The SECftETAKY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA, NX To The POLITICAL RESIDENT, PERSIAN GULF. Simla, the 21th May 1880. v* POBBIOS DlW. Political. Sir, I am directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 92 of the 30th April, regarding the alleged desire of Syud Turki to retire from Muscat, and the negotiations between him and the Sultan of Zanzibar for the reunion of the two States. 2. You are of opinion that Syud Turki’s overtures to his brother are intended merely to sound the way; that both the Sultans are well aware of the necessity of obtaining the consent of the British Government before they can hope to carry out the scheme supposed to he entertained by them; and that consequently nothing more is needed to put a stop to the negotiation than a clear intimation of our views. You therefore recommend that you be allowed to communicate confidentially with Syud Turki on the subject, and to inform him of what has been reported by Dr. Kirk. 3. I am to say that, after full consideration of your proposal, the Governor- General in Council thinks it undesirable to take the initiative in this matter. It is not impossible that the negotiation -may fail through without any direct interference on the part of the British Government; while such interference, in the present state of affairs, might lead to inconvenient consequences, more especially by affording Syud Turki an opportunity for claiming a guarantee of permanent * pecuniary aid in return for his deference to our objections. His Excellency in Council is not, therefore, prepared to authorise your making the proposed communication to the Sultan. But I am to add that you should avail yourself of any opportunity of eliciting from Syud Turki some hint of his supposed intentions, and of conveying to him the views of Government without committing yourself, at present, to any formal declaration of policy. 4. His Excellency in Council agrees with you in the opinion that there is no immediate necessity for considering in detail the measures to he adopted in the event of the Sultan’s abdication. This question may stand over for the present. I r0h 4* &lt;V &gt; 5. A copy of your letter and of the instructions now issued to you will be forwarded to Dr. Kirk for inforniation and guidance.

IT APPEARS THAT HIS HIGHNESS SUFFERS FROM A COMPLICATION OF DISEASES SO SERIOUS THAT,IN PRUDENCE, IT IS ADVISABLE TO BE PREPARED FOR HIS SUDDEN DEMISE. IT IS FURTHER RIGHT TO ASSUME THAT ON THE OCCURRENCE OF THAT EVENT,A PERIOD OF ANARCHY WILL ENSUE IN OMAN,AND THE CRISIS WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH, AS REGARDS PROTECTION OF BRITISH INTERESTS OF ALL KINDS 9 THA// IF IT WERE ^QUEST ION OF ABDICATION OF THE SULTAN, AS BEFORE THE LATTER STEP SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT SOME SORT OF ARRANGEMENT COULD AND WOULD BE MADE FOR TRANSFER *» OF AUTHORITY at THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT, and THERE: IS NO LIKELIHOOD of AMY PROVISION BEING MADE BY THE SULTAN FOR THEOTHER CONTINGENCY.

BUT WHETHER THIS ASSUMPTION IS WAR RANTABLE OR NOT,A GENERAL EXPRESSION OF THE COURSE WHICH GOVERNMENT WOULD PREFER TO SEE EVENTS TAKE AS REGARDS THE SUCCESSION WOULD l THINK BE ADVANTAGEOUS. 6.

I 7. AS REGARDS THE CHANCES OF THE SEVERAL ASPIRANTS : ft IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT COLONEL MILES IS. INCLINED TO THINK THAT IBRAHIM-B IN-KA T S HAS AT LEAST AS GOOD A CHANCE AS ANY OF THE OTHERS INDICATED.

I PRESUME THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD CHIEFLY fa. DESIRE THAT THE SUCCESSOR TO THE SULTANATE SHOULD BE A MAN CAPABLE OF SECURING AND MAINTAINING GOOD ORDER AND IN A POSITION TO DO SO WITH THE LEAST DELAY,AND ALSO A PERSON ABLE AND WILLING TO MAINTAIN ALL THE EXISTING RELATIONS WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND TO FULFIL THE ■=&gt;m*r KL.

Extract from a letter from General Mathews to Mr, Rodd, dated the 19th January 1894, The Muscat Arabs are coming in numbers. They want him to join Muscat with his African dominions, and would rise against Fazil of Muscat if he only gave them a chance of doing so, but the Sultan is too loyal to Her Majesty’s Government and would not think of moving in the matter without sanction of the Government. At the same time it is his greatest wish. He has not spoken openly to me about it, but has said a great deal about Muscat, and his people whisper (as the Arabs and Persian say) little sayings to the point in one’s ear, which probably come from him. It is rather a difficult matter to talk about, and if he speaks, to me I shall say, that I think it better to let matters rest as they are and not bring about any complications.

I have the honour to report that on the receipt of the telegram of the 17th instant, expressing Your Lordship’s views as regards my despatch No. 29 of the 14th ultimo, I, as directed, put myself in communication with General Mathews who conveyed Your Lordship’s message to the Sultan : His Highness replied and said he would thoroughly acquiesce in the wishes of Her Majesty’s Government, and informed me at the same time (whether as an'argument in his own favour, or as a justification of the Arabs* action, I do not know) that the Arabs of Muscat and Oman were discontented with the treatment received by them from Seyyid Eaisul and, that ^determined on a change of rule, they felt for many reasons he was the most fit and proper person to be chosen, and that in case of his refusal or disability their hopes were centred in one of the sons of Ayan- bin-Kaise, who drove out from Muscat Salim-bin-Thwain the parricide brother of His Highness; he also informed me that he had heard and believed that Eaisul had recently been intriguing with Russia, and that at a secret interview, at which no followers were allowed to he present, Faisul had come to some agree ment w r ith regard to Russian protection or flag. I ventured to telegraph the purport of this message to Your Lordship as I Totrght that perhaps it might be important as showing that a plot was being hatched in Zanzibar against a Prince in treaty relations with the Government of India, and also as possibly revealing an intrigue or attempt to gain an important strategic position at the entrance of the Persian Gulf. I here mention, for Your Lordship’s information, that the three Arabs now in Zanzibar most actively engaged in this matter are Abdullah-bin-Saleh, son of Saleh-bin-Ali, Muhsen-bin-Amur and Hamood-bin-Said-el-Jakafi; another Arab, Ali-bin-Uussan, under British protection, I Invited to this Agency and reminded him that under certain conditions I can deport persons to another place. In conclusion I may'add that I informed the Sultan of the contents of Your Lordship’s telegrath referring to the declaration of the 20th March 3 891, and that His Highness has replied t hat he ha s nowmo wish to go further on, but I am privately assured that it is only with great reluctance that he abandons a project most dear to his ambition.

Hardinge, Esq., T» The Earl or Kimberley, K.G., Secretary of State for foreign Affairs. I have the honour to xeport that the Sultan has become involved in pecu niary difficulties owing to careless and extravagant management of his private fortune. In addition to his Civil List His Highness derives a certam income the exact amount of which I cannot state, but which I should estimate at not much beyond 8,000Z. or 10,000Z. a-year, from real property belonging to him in Zanzibar, Pemba, and on the German coast. There were also, I believe, about 3 lakhs of rupees left by previous Sultans in the cellars of the palace, all o which he has, I hear, squandered since his accession, partly in presents and partly in orders on Indian and other merchants for goods of various kinds which their agents have persuaded him to purchase. He has spent lavishly in gifts to Muscat Sheikhs, in the foolish hope of some day playing a part in Oman politics, and his chief native adviser, a Muscat Arab named Hilal-bin-Amr, has, I believe, encouraged him m this course. Only a week or to ago he was nearly, persuaded to attempt to buy a tract of land in Oman, in which it was asserted that coal had been discovered, and in which certain Arab intriguers were apparently desirous that be should acquire an interest, with a view to his thus obtaining a foothold m Arabia. On being informed of it, I strongly dissuaded him from embarking m an enterprise which, quite apart from the political complications which it might ep a , would, from a business point of view, prove disastrous ; and I have since heard that, so far from possessing any capital which he could employ in acquiring fresh property, his private funds are so completely exhausted that he has begun to sell houses and furniture belonging to him here. He owes, moreover, con- siderable sums to Indian merchants, and to Tippoo Tib, which there seems no prospect of his being able to pay at an early date. Some of his courtiers appear to cherish a delusive hope, and to have sug gested the idea to him, that Her Majesty’s Government will, if tbe worst comes to the worst, assist him out of these financial embarrassments I have, so tar, not spoken to him on the subject, nor shall I do so unless he broaches it hm&gt;- self, but I have thought it right to mfoim Your Lordship of the position of affairs, as at any moment he majM^quest my advice and help. \ w No. 1071-E., dated Simla, the 29th May 1895 (Coufidential).

[Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter of 8th May 1895.] No. 66, dated Zanzibar, the 8th April 1895. F rom —M r. A. H. Hardi^ge, To —The Earl of Kimberley, K.G., Secretary of State for Foreign Affaiis. Your Lordship having authorised me in your despatch No. 40 of the 15th ultimo to renew to the Sultan the warning I had previously conveyed to him against interference in Maskat affairs should I consider it requisite, I spoke to His Highness on the subject this afternoon. I thought it desirable to do so, because the news of the disturbances at Maskat had aroused a good deal of interest here and because there seemed grounds for suspecting the existence at the Palace of an impression that the abstention of Her Majesty’s Government from any active intervention on behalf of Seyyid Feysul was due to secret dissatisfaction with the attitude of that Prince, who was alleged to be oh bad terms with Major Sadler and to have coquetted with the new French Consul. I am disposed to think that Hilal-bin-Amr, who is at present the Sultan’s chief native adviser, and who has been the intermediary between His Highness and his visitors from Oman, has encouraged this idea to the best of his ability, with a view to furthering his own private designs. He is the brother of Mohsin-bin-Amr and the‘son-in4aw of Saleh-bin-Ali, two of the principal insurgent leaders, and, quite apart from his relations with the latter, his influence over the Sultan is not a satisfactory one. He has com pletely ousted from favour Mohamed-bin-Seff, who at His Highness s accession was his principal confidant, and who is thoroughly loyal to the protecting power, and he has, I believe, flattered the impatience which it is only natural that His Highness should occasionally feel, though he is too cautious to betray it openly,°at the restraints which the protectorate, imposes on him. I waS therefore not sorry to have an opportunity of warning the Sultan against his counsels, provided I could do so. without -the exercise of any harsh or undue pressure. I informed His Highness of the contents of the Viceroy’s telegram of the 3rd ultimo, and pointed out the deplorable effect which could not tail to be produced by the use of his name, after all the assurances he had given me, as the standard of rebellion in Maskat. He repudiated in the strongest terms any connection with or knowledge of the objects of the revolt declared that Saleh-bin-Ali was the enemy of his house, which had been driven from Oman by the faction of Azan-bin-Kais, and asked whether the Government of India really accused him of combining with that faction against the throne of his cousin Seyyid Feysul. I Said no accusation had been actually made against him, but when the Government of India observed that certain disaffected Maskat Sheikhs had received a warm welcome and presents here, that soon after their return to Maskat a rebellion broke out, two of the principal leaders being near relatives of and in close touch with his chief Arab adviser, that the rebels were supplied with arms from Zanzibar, and that their professed object was to place him on the throne in his cousin’s place, they could hardly fail to conclude that the rising must have received some encouragement at his Court, I would not of course say, since he assured me it was not the case, irom himself, but from persons about him using his name to cover their own purposes.

(Knclosure in Foreign Office letter of 23th September 1895.) No. 166, dated Zanzibar, the 31st August 1895. From—A. H. Hardinge, Esq., To—The Marquis of Salisbury, K.G., Secretary of State for Foreign A(Ta rs. I have the honour to report, with reference to Your Lordship’s despatch No. 153 of the 2nd instant, and telegram of 13th instant, that I informed the Sul- s tan to-day that I was authorised to offer to revise the arrangement made at his accession, in the sense of increasing his Civil List by £3,000 a year. I said, however, that an impression prevailed in London that he had been unduly lavish of presents to Oman Sheikhs, some of whom had afterwards, by the con spicuous part which they had taken in the late rebellion, given colour to the rumour of its having been directly encouraged from Zanzibar ; and that Her Majesty’s Government would not have allowed me to make the offer had I not assured them that the proposed increase to His Highness’s income would not be employed, either directly or indirectly, for the pursuit of political aims of any kind in Arabia. I could not conceal from him that since I had last spoken\ with him on the subject, very circumstantial accounts had reached India of language said to have been used, on bis behalf and in his name, by the rebel Readers, and had produced an unfortunate effect. The satisfaction with which His Highness received the announcement of the proposed increase to his income was evidently a good deal marred by these references to Muscat, and to his supposed connection with the disturbances there, and he was again emphatic m assuring me, as he had repeatedly done before, that the reports spread about him were entirely false. It is difficult, as Colonel Wilson himself observes, to get at the exact truth in a matter of this kind, and it is self-evident that some of the rumours circulated in Muscat respecting the part played by the Sultan of Zanzibar in the rebellion were absurd; one of them, for instance, was that he had actually started in a ship - for Oman to put himself at the head of the insurgents, and this being so, it is only fair to him that others, less palpably untrue, should be received with a good deal of caution. Your Lordship will have observed, for example, that al though the rebel leaders repeatedly put forward the name of Seyyid Hamid- bin-Thwain as their candidate for the throne of Oman, they were not apparently -v. satisfied that he would accept it and were prepared, should he refuse it, to fall back upon the branch of Azan-bin-Kais. His Highness might, I think, plead “Hhat this ignorance of his own wishes and intentions was evidence in itself x that he was not acting iu concert or maintaining close relations with them. , Though I have little doubt that the Sultan was at one time keenly desirous of re-uniting Zanzibar and Muscat under his sceptre, and gladly seized every opportunity of increasing his popularity and prestige iu Oman by presents to v Sheikhs and others, and that Hilal-bin-Omer, Mohsin’s brother, sympathized strongly with the rebellion and probably used the Sultan’s name to encourage it, and though I believe that in the early stages of its initiation arms were sent, whether with the Sultan’s deliberate connivance or not I should not like to say, from Zanzibar to the insurgent Chiefs, I have no reason to think that, since he was warned by me, in obedience to the Earl of Kimberley’s instructions, of the serious consequences which might follow should he be proved to have instigated or assisted the insurgents, he has continued to entertain any relations with them. I think the warning which he received, and which has now been twice repeated, as reports from Muscat have reached me, through Your Lordship’s office, of his responsibility for the troubles there has a good deal alarmed him, and it is not improbable that he may connect in his own mind the disappointment of his hopes of recovering his coast with a diminished confidence on the part of Her Majesty's Government resulting from his intrigues in Oman. If this S E—216-217—Dec. 1V- / Froposal to increase the income of H. H. th e Sultan of Zanzibar. suspicion exists in his mind, I should not be disposed to dispel it; and I should be glad if I thought it could shake his trust in Hilal-biu-Omer, who has, I believe, been the main promoter of these Muscat aspirations, and whose influ ence, both in this and other respects, is, I consider, a distinctly bad one.

So far as can be ascertained all mo'uies so received were for commercial transactions. A sum , of $5,000 sent in three hawalas has within the last few months been paid to Khalfan-bin-Nasar of the Beni Biam residing at Tanoof near Jebel Akhtar, who, I am informed, is heir of a brother lately deceased in Zanzibar and which, it is said, accounts for these sums being remitted to him. I have been unable to obtain any information here which would in any way tend to implicate Sleim-bin-Said with the rebel-leaders, and I have there fore considered it advisable not to inform His Highness the Sultan of the sus picions against this man, though Fadvised His Highness upon the occasion of a recent visit, that it would be as well to show some discrimination in the choice of his confidential servants as possibly some of them were not quite trust worthy.

Cox, Her Britannic Majesty's Consul and Political Agent at Maskat, To The Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to refer you to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department No. 1676 E.-A., dated 13th August 1898, and accompaniments, received with your forwarding endorsement No. 101 of 26th December 1898, on the subject of Hilal-bin-Amr, political Omani detenu at Zanzibar. 2. About 25th May last information reached the Sultan that Hilal had a few days before landed at Sur in a dhow, with a quantity of money and ^oods, and that after foregathering with Monsieur Ottavi, he was busy preaching sedition to His Highness’s subjects at that port. His Highness in commumcat- in 0 * the news to me remarked that presumably Ililal was “ absent without leave , aspire did not think he could have been allowed to leave Zanzibar without previous warning being given to Maskat. He begged me, however, to find out for certain from the Consul-General, Zanzibar. Accordingly I telegraphed to Sir Arthur Hardinge and attach a copy of his reply. On my communicating the purport of this to the Sultan, he appeared a good deal annoyed at the news, and remarked that Hilal’s arrival meant inevitable disturbance in Oman, if not to-day then a few months hence, and he added that “ Hilal is not only my enemv but that of the British Government since his deportment from Zanzibar, and his vindictiveness towards me will be now increased”. It was Hilal’s unfortunate arrival at Sur when Monsieur Ottavi was also theie that made His Highness particularly desirous of reaching that place without delay, in order that he might as far as jiossible undo any harm effected by Hilal before it had had time to spread; and it was to accommodate His Highness in this respect that I arranged the details of our previously projected trip together in H.M.S. “ Sphinx”, so as to land him at Sur as soon as possible after Monsieur Ottavi had quitted it. 3. During my sojourn there I was at some pains to ascertain accurately the details of Hilal’s doings with the following result He arrived at Sur on the 19th May in the evening and found Monsieur Ottavi also there, with whom he had, I understand, been on terms of intimacy in Zanzibar. On the following day complimentary visits were exchanged between him and the Suri Sheikhs, and on the third day, 21st May, after spending 6 hours in communion with Monsieur Ottavi, Hilal went straight from the latter s dwelling to the house of the principal Jcnnebch Sheikh, IMuhammad-bin- Mubarak, one of the French flag holders, and got him to assemble all the Jennebeh elders. These Hilal addressed in the following terms cc You all know what a miserable life I have been leading of late years; this has been all owing to my original friendship with the English, which has brought me nothing but harm. I have to thank the 1 rench that X am once moreback in Oman. You, Suris, have two enemies—Saiyid Feysal of Maskat, and the English behind him—and the only people who can give you any effective assistance against them are the French. My honest advice to you is2 that those of your numher who have not yet taken French pnpcns and flags should take them without fail when next season opens. If you do not, you 1 certainly he harassed by the English In response to this exhortation, the elders referred to the threatening remonstrances recently addressed to them by the Hejraeen section of the Hmawi (reported in my diary on 3rd of May last), and said that they had some fear that now that Saiyid Feysal was on friendly terms with the British bovern- ment, he might bring about a coalition of the Ilinawi against them. To this Hilal retorted: “ Do not be under any apprehension regarding the Hinawi: I can manage them : and if Saiyid Feysal attempts to molest } ou, I guarantee to get all the Ilinawi to throw in their lot with you, no wi i him 4. Fortunatelv the Sultan’s timely visit to Sur, wherein he had not previously set foot since his accession to the Sultanate, has probably obliterated any effect which Hilal’s evil influence might otherwise have had; but there can be little doubt that he will sooner or later stir up disaffection against the Sultan in the interior; and in any case he is unquestionably a most undesirable fire-brand to have been let loose in the hinterland of Oman at this juncture. 5. In view of the opinion expressed by Sir Arthur Hardinge in his despatch No. 269 of August 25th, 1898, to the address of the Marquess of Salisbury, and having regard also to the assurance given by Mr. Cave in his despatch No. 48 to the Foreign Department of the Government of India, I think you will agree with me that it would have been well had His Highness been referred to, or at all events warned, before Hilal-bin*Amr was allowed to return to Oman.

Hardinge, K.C.M.G., C.B., Her Britannic Majesty's Agent and Consul-General at Zanzibar, To—The Marquess of Salisbury, K.G., Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. I have the honour to state that I have just received a cypher telegram from the Political Agent at Maskat, enquiring as to the truth of a report that the “ political prisoner ” Hilal-bin-Amr has escaped from Zanzibar and returned to Oman. The following is a paraphrase of my reply :—“ Hilal is reported to have left about twenty-five days ago for Oman via Bombay. He has not, however, for some time past been either treated or considered as a political prisoner, as with the accession of the present Sultan his influence completely ceased, and he was soon after it restored to full freedom ”.♦ I may mention that Bilal-bin-Amr several times asked me after his release, whether he might go to Oman, and I always replied that I had no obioction to his doing so, provided I were assured that none was felt by His Highness Saiyid Feysal-bin-Turki or by Her Majesty s Political A 0 int Maskat During my absence on the mainland, he addressed a similar reque to Her Matty’s AcLg Consul here, who put off replying to it, uuW having satisfied himself that his departure would not be opposed by the Sultan, h started without further permission on a Suri dhow. It is possible that the Sultan of Maskat may view with some dissatisfac tion the return to Oman of a brother and a former secret ally here of Mohsm- bin-Amr, who bore so conspicuous a part in the rebellion a few years ago, who has now, I understand, himself been pardoned. Hilal will probably 30 m Mohsin at Burra, and I hardly think he is likely to do much mischief, as he is utterly broken down in health, besides being ruined financially. He can, however, I should imagine, be easily expelled from Oman, and sent back here should his presence there be objected to. He might, indeed, make some attempt to obtain French mrotcotjon through Mons. Ottavi, hut ! doubt his going to Maskat itself. Ir he does, we can treat him as a Zanzibar subject and B™ 1 '* protected person, and decline on that ground to allow him to claim the benefit of the treaty between Prance and Maskat.
