Loraine to Sir Austen Chamberlain.—[Received January 5, 1926.) (No. 666. Confidential.) i Tehran, December 17, 192o. ’ THE incident which has arisen, as I had the honour to inform you by my telegrams No. 397 of the 12th December and No. 401 of the 16th December, m connection with the conversion of the Soviet Legation here into an Embassy, is a most unfortunate one. 2. The sequence of events, so far as I have been able to establish them, was as follows: About four days after the decision of the Majlis to depose the Kajar dynasty, and therefore about the 4th November, the Soviet Minister was received by Reza Khan Pahlavi, then provisional head of the State, presumably m order o acquaint his then Imperial Highness with the recognition of the provisional regime by the Soviet Government. M. Yureniev appears to have saturated Keza Khan with fulsome compliments and effusive protestations of friendship, and, m the course of this ebullition of amenities, to have enquired whether a Soviet Ambassador would be welcome in Tehran. Pahlavi appears to have answered affirmatively, but not to have attached any importance to the matter, perhaps regarding it as being of a piece with the remainder of M Yureniev s compliments. At all events, the fact that Pahlavi did not acquaint any of his Ministers with what had passed appears somewhat to bear out this constructioiu 3. The next event was the receipt by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on about the 10th December, of an official note from M. Yureniev in the sense that he had acquainted the Soviet Government with His Imperial Highness s expressed willingness to receive a Soviet Ambassador, and had ascertained from them that as a mark of their friendship and esteem for Pahlavi, they were vvilhn^ to appoint an Ambassador and ready to take the necessary steps to that effect. Ihe Minis for Foreign Affairs at once took this note to the head of the ^tate and enquired whether in point of fact there had been any such conversation or any such oral assurance. Pahlavi frowned and looked annoyed when he read the note, and at first said that he had no recollection of giving any such assurance, but could not be sure. He said he had no time to go into the matter then, which was no idle excuse at a moment when momentous decisions were pending in the Constituent Assemb y, and begged Hassan Khan Moshar to put the note by for the moment and bring it back to him in a day or two for discussion. , . . , ^ • 4. Thereupon the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and this shows not onl&gt; his friendliness towards this Legation, but also his confidence, sent for Mr. Havar and acquainted him in strict confidence with the whole circumstances, on his own responsibility. I promptly sent Mr. Havard back with written instructions as regards the language which he was to use, copy of which is enclosed herein. Next the discussion was resumed with Pahlavi. Hassan Khan Moshar advised against accepting a Soviet Ambassador, but, having had no authority to inform or consult me, was unable to represent my views as such, or with any appreciate force. Ihe Acting Prime Minister Faruki (Zoka-ul-Mulk), the Minister for Public Works, Taimur Tash (Serdar Moazam), and the Minister of Justice, Prince Firuz, gave contrary counsel, and their views appear to have carried most weight. According to Hassan Khan Moshar, no definite decision was taken and he did not consider himself authorised to return any reply to M. Yureniev. At all events, he did not 5 This was the state of affairs when I saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs myself on the 15th December. I told his Excellency that the matter seemed to me extremely grave. I could hardly think of any gesture, short of the publication of a treaty of alliance between Persia and Soviet Russia, likely to produce a ni^f 6 disagreeable impression in London than the reception of a Soviet Ambassador at t is Court. I begged him to banish definitely from his mind any idea whatever fhM His Majesty’s Government would be disposed to follow suit and establish an Embassy [1181 e—1]I in Tehran, and thereby, as it were, equalise matters. It would be a big mistake o suppose that the Persian Government would render the matter more palatable to His Majesty’s Government by suggesting that they should likewise appoint an Ambassador; indeed, if any such suggestion were put forward, it would m likelihood be met with an abrupt refusal, which would only make matteis w 7 orse. The whole policy of His Majesty's Government in this connection, I went on to say, was rather to restrict than augment the number of British Embassies abroad^ and the reception of a Soviet Ambassador in Tehran would rather tend to harden a 1 to soften their hearts towards the appointment of a British Ambassador here. More* over, in the eyes of His Majesty’s Government, the creation of an Embassy m a foreign country was not a mere compliment to be dished out according to the dictates of transient political expediency, but connoted one of two things; eithei the recognition of the State in question as a Great Power, or the existence 01 lelations of very special intimacy, probably in the nature of an alliance, between Grea Britain and that State/ Neither of those conditions could be said to exist m tbe case under examination; but the conception which I had explained cut both ways, for British opinion would probably assume at once that the second condition obtained as betaveen Persia and Soviet Russia. I could hardly imagine the relations between the new regime in Persia and His Majesty s Government starting un ei more uncomfortable auspices. I added, in conclusion, that I did not wish to laboui my personal point of view, though I could easily say a good deal about that, except to point out that this advertisement of Perso-Soviet intimacy would not tacilitate mv task in convincing my Government of the sincerity of the oft-expressed desire ot the Persian Government to improve and draw closer their relations with my own country. „ , . , 6. As regards Hassan Khan Moshar, I was of course preaching to a convert. He agreed with me in every particular and said that if this step w 7 as taken it would be the gravest mistake. He undertook to seek authority from His Imperial Majesty that same day to ascertain my views and a few hours after that to explain them fully to Pahlavi, feigning to have seen me in the interval. Ihis comparatively innocent subterfuge was, however, unnecessary, for the news had leaked out and his Excellency was able to assume that it had reached my ears from other sources. Unluckily, how T ever, the arguments he employed did not prevail, as His Majesty, as he had since become, had made up his mind that the proposal of Moscow must be accepted. Yesterday, after the official proclamation of the new Shah, Reza Khan gave orders for a reply to be sent to M. Yureniev, the terms of which were settled by the Council of Ministers. According to Hassan Khan Moshar, the note does not constitute a definite acceptance of the Soviet Ambassador, but I have little doubt that it will lead to one. i k ^ -i- c ^ 7. One other detail sheds a little more light on the matter. After his first conversation with the present Shah, Hassan Khan Moshar telegraphed to the Persian representative in Moscow to ascertain what he knew about it. Moshayer-ul- Mamalek replied that Narkomindel had indeed spoken to him about the drafting of M. Yureniev’s new credentials, and had enquired whether he should be described therein as a Minister or as an Ambassador. They had, how T ever, given Moshayer-ul- Mamalek clearly to understand that they were not themselves much interested m the matter and that the initiative and insistence belonged to M. Yureniev himself. 8 At the suggestion of the Minister for Foreign Affairs I spoke yesterday evening in much the same sense as is reported in paragraph 5, to Taimur Tash, who enioys Raza Shah’s confidence to a large degree and has just been appointed Minister of the Court. From wdiat he said, and from what Mr. Havard has been able to dean from other sources, it seems as if the Persians themselves are by no means happy about this development; that they consider that Reza Shah has been trapped, and pinned down to an oral assurance which he gave in a moment of expansiveness and without realising the import of what he was saying; and that Reza Shah has felt obliged though realising later the probability of a deplorable impression being produced in London, to go through with the matter, firstly, in order to honour his kindv word secondly, because there is no valid or avowable reason to invoke for ffoin/ back on it and refusing the proffered Embassy. It is, indeed, clear that the probable annoyance of His Majesty’s Government is not a reason which can be used at Moscow and if it were used the only effect would be to persuade the People s Commissars that they had scored a direct hit. My further conclusion is that both Reza Shah and his advisers, other than the Minister for Foreign Affairs, have been comforting themselves by the assumption that an easy path out of the difficulty cancomersation with Taimur Tash, during which I dwelt on the impossibility of this with great earnestness, must have definitely dispelled this illusion, and I felt that my language in this regard produced a certain dismay in my interlocutor. It will have been reported to Reza Shah this afternoon and it remains to be seen what effect it will have produced on His Imperial Majesty. ^ \ou will see, Sir, that the circumstances recorded in this despatch have placed ne in an extremely difficult and embarrassing situation, and I can only trust that ihe manner in which I have attempted to meet it may merit your approval. On the one hand, the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards this eventuality was defined with perfect clarity by the Marquess Curzon in 1923, and, all things being- equal, I should have been presumably justified in taking my stand definitely on the instructions addressed to me at that time and nailing my colours to the mast. Had I done so, had I breathed diplomatic fire and slaughter, and had Reza Shah maintained his acceptance of a Soviet Ambassador, there would have been only three courses open to His Majesty’s Government:— 1. My recall; 2. The creation of a British Embassy; 3. My somewhat ignominious disavowal. But all things were not equal. There is a new Shah, who offers a striking- contrast in every way to the monarch who was reigning in 1923. He is an effective person; he is the principal instrument through whom it has been possible to reach a far better state of Anglo-Persian relations than has obtained for a good many years, and he has promised me to do his utmost to improve those relations yet more; his very accession to the throne is generally regarded as denoting a foreign policy with a bias towards England, and many Persians even go so far as to consider this accession as an absolute master-stroke of British diplomacy, as inscrutable as it is irresistible. Some quarrels may be unavoidable, even necessary, but it hardly seemed to me that a quarrel about whether a particular Bolshevik called himself an Ambassador or a Minister was one into which we should plunge very lightly, especially if it meant a breach with the man in question, now become a King, and as completely the master of Persia’s destinies as any single human being well could be. A diplomatic battle of this sort, apart from its being as far removed from modern political conditions as the Congress of Vienna from the recent meeting of European statesmen at Locarno, might perhaps have been engaged in order to forestall a decision, but hardly, it seemed to me, in order to reverse one, with any prospect of profit or usefulness, and in no case without your express instructions and the knowledge that you intended to fight it to a finish. I therefore endeavoured, with the limited means and opportunity at my disposal, to discourage the Persian Govern ment from taking this step; when I found it was to all intents and purposes too late to influence the decision, I outlined its possible consequences as regards Anglo- Persian relations, but in such manner as not to compromise either the line of advance or of retreat of His Majesty’s Government. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s Acting High Commissioner at Bagdad. I have, &amp;c. PERCY LORAINE. Enclosure in No. 1.

I should like you to see Minister for Foreign Affairs and tell him that, when in May 1923 this same question was raised, I was authorised by my Government to inform the Shah, and that I did so inform him, as well as the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the time, that nothing could create a more painful impression on His Majesty’s Government than the acceptance of a Soviet Ambassador at the Court of Persia; that they could not expose their representative here to being placed in a position of permanent inferiority to the envoy of a Power which does not even conceal its hostility towards Great Britain; that they would not in any case convert their own Legation into an Embassy; that if their Minister was not treated. \ with the respect due to him, it would always be open to them to entrust the protection of British interests in Persia to a Charge d’Affaires. Tell Minister for Foreign Affairs that this is for his private information, and that I think it only right and friendly to let him know what was the attitude taken up by His Majesty’s Government on a former occasion. In view of the greatly improved relations between our countries, it would doubly unfortunate if this 'matter cropped up again ; to-day, His Majesty’s Goveri ment might not be so blunt in the expression of their views, but I feel quite cert£^,P that their attitude has remained, and will remain, the same, and that they would feel it very deeply.

Shah has decided to receive a FciBSian Ambassador disregarding advice in contrary sense of Minister for Foreign Affairs and contending that Moscow's proposal is a personal compliment to himself on the occasion or hie accession. Before interview between Einister for Foreign Affairs and His Majesty on DecenSer 15th at which this decision was tsicen, I saw former myself and soMce to him most seriously developing 1923 arguments and dwelling calmly tut seriously on unfortunate con clusions which His Majesty's Government and Bntisn opinion would almost inevitably draw from the facts.

It is unfortunate that up till December 15th Minister for Foreign Affairs was unable to represent my views as such because he had not been authorised to inform or consult me; and on that date His Majesty had apparently made up his aim to honour the statement to which he had been pinned down. ...mm ( 2 ). tjl f' A.MA.

Although my opportunity was but slender* I have thus represented matter as forcibly as I could. I have staked out rather than taken up a position based on our attitude in 1923 being sure that you would not wish to be committed to any diplomatic hostilities before you had been consulted. Nevertheless we are faced with an accomplisned fact and it becomes necessary to define our attitude at, once. There are, I think, two alternatives: (1) to tics the tragic view and toll Persians we are deeply offended and slighted: in that case we must be prepared to carry out Lord Curcon's threat of leaving the Legation in the hands of a Charge d'Affaires, (2) regard matter as ono of secondary Importance and Russian action as slightly ridiculous; tell Persian government that prompt settlement of our outstanding questions rather than mere matter of precedence is the thing to which we attach importance end by which wo shall assess friendliness of Persia; i,e. use a lost battle as a lever rather than pursue a uead issue. It may be that the worst Inferences from P.sza's action are the correct ones though I doubt it.

Sir, In your Despatch No# 25, dated the 8th June 1923, you kindly gave me an appreciation of the Soviet Russian Consul General Apresov newly appointed to Meshed. You concluded with the expression of your opinion that if given sufficient rope the man would soon hang himself. This prophecy seems to be on the point of fulfilment, for on the 10th instant M. Apresov announced that he was proceeding to Tehran in four days* time to complain against all the high Persian officials in Meshed! I understand that he is taking his wife with him. His chief grievances appear to be (1) that he has not been allowed to open a Library in the city, (2) that the elections for the new Majlis are not being conducted in a way that he approves and particularly that no members of the 'Union of Khorasan' ( Ittihad-1 - Khorasan ) are being given a chance to win seats, (3) that the Chief of Police, Major Mudabbir-ul-Mulk, who was at Resht with him when he first went there, is still hostile to him and keeps too close a watch on the Russian Colony here, (4) that he has not been given satisfaction for the insult inflicted on him, in his own office by the Russian woman Denisova. M. Apresov has stated openly that he cannot return to Meshed/ Sir Percy Loraine, Bart., C.i.*.G., His Majesty*s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, TEHRAN.4NB - 2 - i. eshed unless the Governor General is removed, and that he will report to the Russian Minister accordingly. To what extent the above mentioned reasons have contributed to M. Apresov's departure are not clearly known. There is another story afloat that M. Shumiatsky has recalled him on account of the insistence of the Caucasian community to have M. Hakimov back or another Muhammadan in his place.

This morning at 10 a.m. H.E. tne Governor General sent for me. he asked me to give you the following message as, on account of Roza-Khwanis in his grounds, he will be unable to see you before the beginning of next month (13th September). The communication is as follows:- 'The Karguzar has brought me a message from the ’’Russian uonsul General announcing that he has broken off ’’official relations with me. 'He is offended with me (1) because, although I ’’know that the 'Union of Khorasan' (Dahqan &amp; Co) are his ’’friends, I am unkind to them, and (2) that I have not 'complied with his demand that the Russian woman Denisova 'should be deported. 1 am informed that M.Apresev has reported to his 'Minister '(1) that I am openly hostile to Russia and that I unreasonably trouble Russian subjects here, '(2) that I am unfriendly with Persians who are RussophQ. '(3) that I have appointed Nuzzars (Supervisors) for the Parliamentary elections in consultation with the British Consulate,' (Note. This is quite untrue.) '(4) that I work according to the British Consul General's advice and that I have converted . Khorasan into a British colony, '(5) that the 'Vakils' elected for Khorasan will all be pro-British# ( Note . This is improbable.) '(6) that, in spite of his efforts, he has entirely failed to get on with me, and that either he or I must leave Khorasan. 'Personally I do not mind his 'breaking off official 'relations ' with me. He has been interfering in internal affairs“affairs and trying to do. as he did in Resht* He cannot “succeed in this. 'I understand from the Karguzar that the Foreign “Ministry have ordered that Madame Denisova should be “expelled from Meshed. If the Karguzar communicates to “me in writing the Foreign Ministry’s order, I will deport “the woman to Nishapur or Sabzawar. “At Lutfabad there is a crisis about the water supply “which rises in Persian territory and of which two-thirds “only should go to Russia. The people of Lutfabad have not i / i “been getting their share and recently took it by force. 'I have asked the Amir Lashkar to see that no conflict takes “place there. 'The Karguzar yesterday asked M. Apresov to wire to “Russia a recommendation that the people of Lutfabad should “be allowed their share of the water. He replied that he “would not do so because he was annoyed at the non- “ expul si on of Madame Denisova*. “The Superintendent of Telegraphs has been “submitting reports to Tenran about Apresov which confirm “my reports. “We have a spy in the Russian Consulate who has 'reported that Apresov is going to Tehran to make a protest, “if he is satisfied he will come beck with honour. Other- “wise he will not return. “This report requires confirmation.'Note on the quarrel between Apresov, Russian (Jonsul General at Meshed, and Madame Denisova. Madame Marie Ivanovna Denisova is the young wife of ex-Colonel Denisov, a Czarist refugee, who has been in Meshed for the past 4 or 5 years, ne at present is engaged in private trade in partnership with M. Rustanovich ex-Manager of the Russian Banque d f Esoompte de Perse . M. Denisov went a few weeks ago towards Bujnurd on business• His wife is a peasant girl, the daughter of a fourgon driver, whom he married 3 years ago. She has twice suffered from miscarriage and is now again enceinte . She was very desirous of going to Askabad to place herself under the treatment of a noted doctor there. She accordingly went, in her hosband's absence, to the Russian Consul General and applied for a passport. M. Apresov refused to give it on the ground that her husband was not registered in the Russian Consulate. He added some abusive expressions about him. Madame Denisova lost her temper and abused the Consul General. The latter had her placed in custody and sent to the Persian Police station with a demand for her imprisonment or expulsion to Russia. A few hours later the Governor General instructed the Chief of Police that as the lady's husband was a person of repute she should be sent to her own house and confined there under a sentry. Colonel Muhammad nusain Mirza, the Military Chief of Staff, is a personal friend of M. Denisov and, having a Russian wife, moves freely in Russian society here. He forced his way past the Police sentry and had an interview with the lady. These facts enraged M. Apresov, who/who has been telegraphing to Tehran, demanding the expulsion of Madame Denisova and her husband to Russia. Apparently an order has reached the Karguzar from the Foreign Ministry for the ''deportation 1 ' of the lady, though no action has been taken on it yet.Document is the Prope rty of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should -he 6b) returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] Decode $748 L Sir P.

Letters from HM’s Envoy Extraordinary &amp; Minister Plenipotentiary at Tehran, Sir Percy Loraine, record the British Government’s fierce resistance to the appointment of a Russian ambassador. Loraine’s concern was that such an appointment would elevate Russia’s diplomatic presence in Persia to a level superior to Britain’s. The file includes two brief communiqués between Loraine and the Russian ambassador, dated December 1925 (ff 44-45). Written in French, they record the occasion of the Russian diplomatic mission’s elevation to the rank of embassy. Subsequent correspondence concerns the movements, activities and changes in personnel at the Russian Embassy in Tehran, as well as reports of Russian espionage in Persia.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ambassador of Soviet Russia to Iran</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Tehrān</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Embassies and consulates</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Bilateral relations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0003e8#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
