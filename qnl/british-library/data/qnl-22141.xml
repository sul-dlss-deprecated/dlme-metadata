My dear Belgrave, Will you please let ne know what the present output of the power-house is and the average current consumption for the year January 1st 1946 to December 31st 1946? Also what is the situation as regards the new generator and what are the details of its output? Yours sincerely, % C.D. Belgrave, v.sc^., Q.D.Il. , Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain . NS. ! ■GOVERNMENT Og BAHRAIN. STATE ENGINEERS IKPARTOSNT , BRIEF REPORT ON THE STATE SNGINI^ER^ DEPARmSNT FOR THE YEAR 1946 # ELECTRIC IT? UI^RTiOCING . The installation of the new generating set of 206 kW capacity was completed on 6th Aprils and after prelimir nary running and final adjustments, it was put on load on 13th April* His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman bin H&amp;m&amp;d t K*C*I#E* visited the Power station accompanied by the Adviser on this date and officially started up the engine by opening the compressed air starting mechanism. This generating set has successfully operated to date and has carried loads representing 90^ of its rated output on numerous occasions for continuous periods between 7 and 24 hours* Owing to the delay in obtaining the water pumps and cooler to enable a closed circuit cooling system to be used^it has run to date on an open circuit.using an Heenan and Froude water cooler* This has resulted in daily distilled water consumptions up to 1,140 galls: for 24 hours running as compared with a consumption of 90 galls when using a closed circuit under similar load and duration conditions* The distilled water has had to be transported by road from the Naval Base at Jufair in a 500 gallon capacity tanker, and the cost of this, together with the production costs has considerably increased generating costs* As the engine is of the high speed type and is unable to operate when using the local raw water, there has been no alternative to the procedure employed* There have practi cally been no shut downs during the hot weather season excepting on rare occasions for short periods and for * reasons entirely beyond control* The maximumload recorded was 400 ki'/ and the load variation during the months April - October was between 330 - 388 kW. The maximum output of the plant during this period was425 kW. Additional Generating plant on order consists of two 300 kW. Mirrlees-Metrovic alter nators. The first is due for shipment in March 1947 and the second in November 1947. Preliminary work is now in hand for the installation of the first of these two sets* EXTENSIONS TO POWER SUPPLY. THE B»0.A.C. Rest House new sub-station of loo kVA capacity supplying power for lighting and Air Conditioning was ; connected during April* power and lighting for the Bahrain Government? New Stores and machine tool workshops, two residential quarters for Staff employees, a new wing to His Highness* s Palace at Gudhaibeya, Residential staff quarters for Messrs* Gray, Mackenzie and in addition approximately 116 private consumers were connected for light, and four new flour mills, the latter necessitating the erection of a new sub-station of 50 kVA capacity adjacent to the fish market 0 An increased demand by p.c.Ud* for air condition ing of staff and office premises was also provided. Four power line standards have had to be replaced owing to damage caused by motor trucks and cars,and three Standards owing to excessive corrosion which made them unsafe.2 - Three High Tension line breakages occurred without serious damage and also several Low tension lines, in each instance the breakages were the result of corrosive action and old age. BUILDING SXPSN5I0NS &gt; The following work has been completed by the State Engineer’s Department during the year. Seven garages in the power Station Compound. Two living quarters for senior staff employees. New stores office and building for all stores of the State Engineer’s Department. New workshops consisting of Machine tool shop, General fitting, electric welding, and tinsmiths shops. New electrical shop for motors, a.C. units and refrigerators. New Blackmiths shop. .i/ork planned but not commenced,consists of a water distill ation plant building. Water tower for distilled water storage. Construe tbtfraof a surface pond for conservation of well water from power House plant to provide boiler feed water for the 10 Ton distillation plant on order. Office accomodation for the State Engineer, which is at present approximately one mile distant in the town area. TELEPHONE DEPARTMENT » To date no work has commenced in connection with the installa- ? n automa ' t i c telephone system planned by Messrs. Cable ana tireless Ltd. The present system is unsuitable and inadequate for the needs of Manamah and Muharraq. Most of the equipment is obsolete and efficient line maintenance is virtually impossible owing to climatic conditions and interferences set up by the High and low Tension Electricity distribution lines which are superimposed on the same pole line, TRANSPORT DEPARTMENT. During April the transportation of 99 M.T. Vehicles and 18 motor cycles was made from the Army Base at Awali by the department. These vehicles were purchased from the Army disposals Board at a time when there was an acute shortage in all Government Departments. Only a few were retained by the Government, the remainder being taken by His High ness’; members of the ruling family^and the general public. The vehicles taken by the various Government Departments have mostly been sold owing to the arrival from the UoF. of new ones on order. These have been standardised by types and consist of 7 Humber touring cars. 7 Standard ' ” 6 3 Ton Sommer Trucks 6 Light ” ” Other vehicles on order but not. yet received consist of 6 Humber station wagons and 6 - 15/20 cwt. pick ups of a type not yet decided. P WORK SHOP DEPARTMENT . This most important and long outstanding requirement has at last been met by the arrival of special machine and hand tools from England.Exoellent progress has been made in comp leting the installation of all the equipment received to date, and urgent repair work, requiring the use of special ised equipment, has been carried out efficiently and expeditiously for tne Power Station and other Government Departments. Important work has also been undertaken for the R.A.F#, P.C.L. and Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie Ltd.7 ■ 3 . Two first class machine tool operators of Indian Nationality have been engaged, and several young Bahrainians of excep tional ability are under training in the workshop* There is at present one Senior Staff vacancy for an Electricity distribution and Maintenance Superintendent. This post has been vacant for the past 1| years, but has been filled, as a temporary measure, during the past lo months by the lines and cable - jointer foreman* The volume of work to be undertaken in the re-planning of all electrical distribution in Manamah and Muharraq, and in providing more efficient lines maintenance requires this vacant appointment to be filled as early as possible. Urgent action is being taken in India to this end. Shaikh Hamad Bridge . This contiraued to operate efficiently during 1946, and with the exception of repairs to the actuating mechanism for the slewing gear, no% other repairs to the main structure were required. The Bridge was non-operative for a period of 24 hours while repairs to the acuating mechanism were carried out. IvLANAMiiH V/ATER SCHEME * ^contract** for the supply and installation of water mains, pumping plant, .fater tower and tanks,has been made with Messrs. Holloway Brothers Limited. The final scheme has been approved and all materials and equipment are on order. Preliminary work has commenced and completion of the scheme is expected to take place in February 1948. WATER DISTILLATION PLANT. An order has been placed for a plant of Ten Tons capacity per 24 hrs. This will provide distilled water for the electricity Generating plant, and M.T. vehicles. Also the Government Hospital, other Government buildings and private consumers domestic requirements. The plant is expected to arrive early in 1947 and will be erected on the Power House Site.
