No.2108 of 1934. British Residency &amp; Consulate-General Bushire* the 15th September 1934. To The Officiating Political Agent, Bahrain Memorandum. A plan of the Sepoys’ Barrack is enclosed showing alterations suggested with a view to transforming it into (a) a Court and Office for the Indian Assistant and (b) a quarter for a Clerk. A rough estimate is also attached. &gt;&lt; 2. Please return the plans by next mail with any comment which you may wish to offer after consulting with the Indian Assistant. 3 . It seems desirable to have some shelter for witnesses and, if you agree, please inform me how best you think that it can be arranged. 4. It will be seen that the west wall of the suggested Clerk’s quarter has been made without windows, so that the Adviser's house and garden will not be overlooked. It is requested that you will kindly have the extremities of the walls (A and B in blue on the plan) represented by poles and see whether the building of this wall will adversely affect the view from Adviser’s house. It may increase the glare, which is felt in the Adviser’s house from the Agency walls, but this could perhaps be prevented by colouring the wall brown, and on the other hand it may hide the present unpleasant view of the sanitary and kitchen arrangements of the Agency. .Lieut. -Colonel, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.( 5 ) § / Y . o. 18/9.

The only comments I have to offer are:- (a) Opposite the Sepoys* Barrack there are old stables and one of these can be converted as a waiting room for witnesses and petitioners ^b) The West well of the Clerk's quarters should have ventilators high up in the wall otherwise the rooms will be very hot during summer months (c) The west wall of Clerk's quarters will not affect very much the view from the Adviser's house but will increase the glare and this could be prevented as suggested by you by colouring the wall brown.

Additions and alterations to the old Sepoys* barrack at Bahrain. -t/ v&gt; \ /&gt; —OoT)y of a Memorandum No. 2595 % dated the 24th November 1924 19/137 from the Hen’hie the Political Resident in the Persian 3 Gulf, Bushire, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Nev; Delhi Additions and alterations to the old Sepoys* barrack at Bahrain, The need has long been felt for removing the Indian Assistant's Court from the lower floor of the Bahrain Agency House as the swarms of litigants and witnesses render the courtyard, which is just below the residential quarters of the Political Agent, noisy or dirty. The offices are overcrowded and record space is insufficient. Moreover the Indian Assistant's Court Room is now required for the Assistant Political Agent, 2 . Temporary arrangements have been made to remove the Indian Assistant's Court, Office and the Court records to a building, which has been rented not far from the Agency. His Excellency Shaikh .Hamad bin 'Isa, while willing with his usual courtesy, to agree to this arrange: -ment for a few months in order to assist us in cur difficulties said that he was not prepared to agree to the arrangement as a permanent measure because such a Court should be held in the Agency area for political reasons. His Excellency is of course Quite correct: we have no right to have a Court outside the Agency area and it is undesirable for various reas'ens propose I, therefore,^/to convert the old sepoys' barrack 3 into three rooms consisting of Court Room 30' x 20 ', Record Room 20 * x 20 * and Waiting Room 20 ' x 10 *. The barrack is not required as a barrack as there is no longer an Indian Infantry Detachment, and it can conveniently and cheaply be converted into Court Rooms, though certain improvements will be required to make it suitable for its new purpose. 4 It is proposed at the same time to convert therest of the barrack into a residential quarter. Since the coining of the -Bahrain Petroleum Company it has become increasingly difficult to obtain suitable accommodation for clerks and ,the rents charged for such accommodation as is available have risen considerably. It is also desirable to have one clerk on the premises to attend to urgent business, which has much increased with the rapid development of Bahrain. I 1 he extra cost of making this quarter while the work on the Court Rooms is being carried out will be comparatively small and there will be a permanent saving of an house rent allowance of fc 30/- a month. 5 . The proposed additions and alterations are shown on the accompanying plans and are estimated to cost Ks 3,500/- of which Rs 5,500/- will be debitable to Original ^ : orks and Rs 3,000/- to Repairs. 5 . The necessary provision has been made in the Schedule of Demands for 41-Civil Works Central, Ncn-Voted, for the next financial year, and it is requested that the Grovernment of India may be pleased to sanction the scheme.Froai * The Hon’hle zne Political Reeideat in the Persian Gulf* To - The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India t New Delhi* Memorandum So* 137137-17.

An extract from a report by Mr. Croad who recently inspected the Agency buildings at Bahrain is enclosed herewith. The Government of India are inclined to agree with Mr. Croad*s remarks that in view of the very dilapidated condition of the Old Sepoys* Barrack it would be a waste of Government money to incur any expenditure on the proposed additions and alterations. The Government of India would however be glad to have your views and further proposals. Sd. V. Narahari Rao, Additional Deputy Secy, to the Govt, of India. 1Extract from a report by Mi’. Croad. The Assistant Engineer tells rne this is only a preliminary estimate for administrative approval. I have seen the building which is to be altered and it is in a very dilapidated state. The present proposals entail xhe replacement of doors and windows and the raising of the roof by 3* and the replacement of the roof by one of R.S. joists and wooden battens. Tne present roof is of ballis spanning 20’ with an inevitable sag. Personally I think this is throwing good money after bad and would suggest that the present building be demolished and a suitable structure be put up in its place. This will entail an expenditure of Rs.18,000, and further maintenance can to a large extent be avoided. The Agency property is congested as it is and a new building cannot be pun up elsewhere. :oOo:Ko* 1225-18/9* political Agency, Bahrain, the 20th July 1935* The Honourable the political Resident in the Persian ttolf, Cam Bahrain* ^emoranduB:* //' Reference your printed letter MO:1345/19/13V dated the 4th July 1935* 2* in view of Mr* Croats report I make the follcv/ing further fjuggestions#- (a) tiince a new nouse is desirable would not the money be better utilised in building a house for the Assistant political agent v/ith its ovm Court and office? (b) if so would not such a house be constructed better on a healthy site outside Bahrain? (c) If so would not the objections regarding glare and congestion referred to in the Honourable the officiating political Resident* s memo randum Mo*2108 dated the 15th September 1934 ; and vTm Oread* s report be overcome by demolition of the bepoys* Barrack* 3. Altemativately I suggest that a house-and Court room be constructed on the site of the present Barrack for use of the Indian Assistant or any of the Agency staff* I should like to point out that since these proposals further proposals to add a wing to the Agency have been made to find suitable quarters for the Honourable the political^ Resident on his frequent visits to Bahrain* The construction of this wing will I think make the building of a new house on the present barrack site highly undesirable.

I have again been reminded that His i&amp;cellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin f Isa ai Khaliiah only agreed to the use of the present runted building io^ the Indian Assistant’s Court as a temporary measure and that two years have elapsed since then. 3. You will reammber that «hen the proposal to mit the present building was mooted at a meetingwith the Shaikh and his Iteailj, they wer-e much against it on the gn)unds tiiat it was not app^p^iato politically that an Agency Oou^t should he held outside the Agency limits, and that it was not suitable that the OouH should be held in a building which fas nmted and was oi so pooan ap^euTunce# J?he ijhaikh, however, in spite oi the strongieeling expressed by his Family, agreed to allow the GouH to be held in this way as a temporary measure, as we we-^e in difficulties ove**” accommodation. 4. I am aware that the Shaikh and his Family and his entourage have commented somewhat bitterly, when passing the building, on the time which has elapsed without any steps having been taken to move the CouH; back to the Agency a-nja. It is most undesirable that we should give cause lor _ a feeling Ol ill-usage to enter the minds oi ou^ friends, on v/hom our policy in the Persian Gulf so much depends, o^ that we should place in the hands of ou*^ ehemies the weapon oi pointing eut, as they neglect no opportunity ox doing, the danger of allowing the British to establish themselves anywhere as they at once take advantage ox it. 5.
