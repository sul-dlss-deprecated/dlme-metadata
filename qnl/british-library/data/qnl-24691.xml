My Loud Marquis, In reply to Your Lordship’s despatch No. 10 (Secret), dated the 19tli April 1912, regarding Persian claims to Kacha and Piran, in which you ask for the evidence on which the statement in our Secret despatch No. 6, dated the 18th January 1912, that the “ red ” line on Sir A. H. McMahon’s map roughly represented the limits of our occupation in 1905 was based, we have the honour to make the following ohservations. 2. The statement that the “ red ” line roughly represented the limits of our occupation in 1905 is based on the following considerations :— (a) When, after the demarcation of the Baluch-Afghan boundary line in 1895, the opening up of a trade route to Sistan brought us into contact with this tract of country, we found it absolutely uninhabited, and our local officials not knowing the exact position of the boundary treated the tract lying between the “ red ” and “ blue ” lines as being on the British side of the Persian frontier. The original alignment of our trade route ran through this tract from Kacha, south of the Kacha Koh, via Bug Thana and Piran. The word Thana used in our maps, in conjunction with Bug, refers to the fact of our having placed a levy Thana, i.e., post, at that place. This post, when a better alignment for the trade route was subsequently found to the north of the Kacha Koh, was transferred elsewhere. (h) Mr. Tucker, in his letter of the 15th March 1907, was incorrect in describing the Zarezais, to whose intermittent occupation he refers, as “hardly British subjects’’^ They, like all other Afghans wffiose lands fell on the British side of the Balucli- Af°-han boundary line demarcated in 1891-95, became ipso facto British subjects in regard to such lands. These same Zarezais have always been treated as British subjects m respect we would remark tnat local o ehistan since 1905. We do n these orders, and consider this petty matter. We do not anticipate any difficulty in giving effect to j I ‘ ’ le manner in which to deal withA , * l etter £r ® m th . e 1 I ^ dia +n ^ territory has ever been made is technically correct, Inftx.) tbTtraet formed the basis of our contention with the Persian ^ Government in 1905.

With reierence to correspondence ending with my letter dated the 6th December 1911, No. P. 4712, as to the alleged violation by the utisn authorities in Baluchistan of the Perso-Baluch frontier near Piran, I am directed to enclose, to be laid before the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a report ' on the subject from the Government of India. r Ihe Marquess of Grewe is not aware what authority the Government of India have for describing the red line on the map as roughly repre senting the limits of our occupation in 1905. Colonel MacMahon’s memorandum of 5th November 1905 (in which the red line is advocated on grounds of convenience and the district between the two lines is said to be “ absolutely barren and uninhabited ”) does not appear to support this description, while Mr. Tuckers letter of 15th March 1907 (enclosed in this Office letter of 22nd June 1907) states that there were no British levies west of the blue line in the spring of 1905 and that “ the status was one of intermittent Zarezai occupation.” The Zarezais are neither Persian nor British subjects, and since they divide their time between British and Afghan territory, Sir F. Grey may be disposed to regard their intermittent occupation in 1905 as justifying the con tention that the Persian Government has no right to the territory east of the red line, which is the true watershed. On the other hand, it may be admitted that we have made no formal claim to the territory, and difficulties may arise in carrying out the instructions given by the Government of India to the local authorities in their letter of 14th October 1911, that “ any trespass between the red and blue lines . . . should not be permitted.” I have, Ac., The Under Secretary of State, P.

External. to The Most Hon’ble the MARQUIS of CREWE, K.G., P.C., Mis Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Calcutta, the 18th January 1912. My Lord Marquis, With reference to your telegram, dated the 5 th December 1911, regarding the alleged violation on the part of the British Indiaa authorities of the Perso-Baluch frontier, we have the honour to forward, for the inform- ation of His Majesty’s Government, a copy of the papers noted in the accom panying schedule. 2. In August* last, the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, Deputy Governor of Seistan, • Enclosures No., i and 2 . ^ previously had been instigating the Baluchis to raid in the Kainat, extended his operations towards British territory by sending his emissary, one Nazar Jan, to Kacha to recover his share of the looted property which had been taken across the British border from Kain. On . . XT „ receipt of this information we tele- graphedf to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan to expel Nazar Jan and his party from British territory, and directed that he should not be permitted to take away any persons or property that he might have seized in British limits. The Local British authorities had, however, I Enclosure No. 14. already taken! action, and it will be seen from the report, dated the 14th September 1911, from our Agent in Baluchistan that the Persian party actually arrived at Bug, which is well within the territory we claim, but were made to remove themselves, leaving a represent ative in the person of Nazar Jan, to whom, after careful enquiry, the loot claimed by the Persians was restored, as it was clearly shown that the property had been robbed from Persian territory. 3. In connection with the question of the boundary in this locality, we would invite a reference to Sir H. McMahon’s memorandum on the Perso- Baluch boundary question of the 5 th November 1904, which formed an § Copy forwarded with Foreign Secretary’s letter enclosure of hlS letter No 2540,§ dated No. 48 m., dated the 1 st December rju4. the 5th November 1904, and to the mao annexed thereto. The principles underlying the settlement which was ultimately arrived at by Sir A. Hardinge at Tehran in 1905, were that the boundary should not be specifically defined, that the status quo should be adhered to, and that no further claim should be made by either side. The status quo meant the then existing conditions of occupation by either side. The “ red ” line on the map referred to above roughly represented the limits of our occupation, and it will be seen that Piran lies w^ell wfithm this line, while Kacha is on our side even of the “ blue ” line. It will thus be observed that not only has there been no violation of Persian limits on oui pait but the Persians have themselves disturbed the status quo by transgressing British territory.li 2 4. TTe are equally desirous with Your Lordship that the boundary- question in this neighbourhood should not be reopened; and it was in this view that we issued instructions to the Consul in Seistan not to discuss the matter with the local Persian officials, and to reply to any representations that might be made to him that the locality was beyond his jurisdiction.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. It is reported tliat Hashmat-ul-Mulk is proposing to start towards Sarhad in a few days with a force of some 2,000 men, the alleged object bein^ to recover from Baluchi Sarhad the loot taken by them from kain. The Russian Consul and I are making joint enquiry from him as to scope of his expedition, and unless I hear to the contrary I am warning him that we cannot view with indifference military operations so close to our frontier, as these may be likely to cause disturbances to spread to tribes on British side of border.

My telegrams Nos. 61 and 62, dated 8th and 14th August. I now hear that emissary from Hashmat-ul-Mulk has arrived at Kacha, where he is engaged ostensibly in recovering property looted from Kain, Another emissary of the Hashmat is looting innocent Baluchis on same pretence in neighbourhood of Koh-i-Malik Siah. 1 believe that these measures have been taken by the Hashmat without Persian Government’s permission, and that they are simply an extension in a new direction of his previous robberies. It is eminently undesirable that he should he permitted to extend his opera tions into British territory, and I would suggest the immediate arrest of emissary at Kacha named Nazar Jan and all his followers on suspicion of brigandage. It is known that Nazar Jan has taken prominent share in Kain robberies^ He could be detained until enquiries have been made regarding the authority and objects of his mission. In any case, I strongly deprecate that any prisoners, camels or other property be permitted to leave British territory under this man’s charge. In event of any looted property being recovered I could inform the Governor of Kain who would send his own men to identify it and take it over. Kindly inform the Government of India if you agree with these views. Addressed Tehran No. 63, and repeated to Simla. Enclosure No. 3. Telegram P., No. S.—475, dated the 17th August 1911.

With reference to the correspondence ending wdth my telegram No. 745- Confidential, dated the 24th August 1911, l) have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, copy of a letter No. 155, dated the 24th August 1911, from the Political Agent, Chagai, giving an account of the information which has reached him regarding the conduct of Persian officials at Bug. 2. It will be seen that on hearing of the arrival of the Persian party Major Webh-Ware’s representative, under his instructions, requested them to remove themselves at once, which they did, leaving a representative in the person of one Nazar Jan. Enquiries having shown that the property claimed by the Persians had clearly been robbed from Persian territories, the whole of it was restored to Nazar Jan. 3. There remain in our custody at 'present 19 men who are accused of having brought the stolen property to Bug, and also 10 camels which are con nected with an entirely separate case and which are believed to have been looted from Kain. 4. I am directing Major Webb-Ware to put the 19 prisoners hack across the Persian border, and am asking him to enquire from the British Consul in Seistan whether the latter can arrange to take over the 10 camels still in our possession. Letter No. 155 (Confidential), dated Quetta, the 24th August 1911. From—The Political Agent, Chagai, To—The First Assistant to the Hon'ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. I have the honour to invite a reference to the telegraphic correspondence on the subject of the appearance on the Kacha-Robat frontier of a body of Persians, and to say thao I have just received the details from the Officiating Native Assistant, Kacha. 2. The facts of this incident are briefly as follows :— On the 8th instant a body of Seistan Jambaz sowars arrived at Bug, which is situated at the head of the Piran river. The Native Assistant on hearing of their arrival communicated with me and received instructions to proceed with sufficient levies to Bug, ascertain what the deputation of this party was due to, prevent any violation of British territory, and, in pointing out that the presence of Persian sowars at Bug conflicted with the terms of the 1905 Tehran agreement, request courteously but firmly their withdrawal. wThese orders were carried out to the letter. The Native Assistant reached Bug on the morning of the 9th. He asked and obtained a statement from their leader Sayed Khan, showing what his purpose on the frontier was, and he requested him to withdraw his men which he did a few hours later the same day. There w as no violation of our territory, nor indeed did any Persian sowars so much as enter our limits. 3. Their leader complained that several Baluch with cattle, which had been stolen, had crossed into British Territory. The Native Assistant suggested that they should leave a representative at Bug, which they did in the person of one Nazar Jan, and he said that he would make enquiries into the matter. This was done and as the result he collected, from near Piran and Lashkari Ah, some 19 men, 20 camels, ISl sheep and goats and various petty articles. These men, who were on their way from Sarhad to Afghanistan, admitted on being questioned that the cattle in their possession did not belong to them but were stolen property. The Native Assistant communicated with me by telegram,— this was on the 14th or 6 days prior to the receipt of your No. 726-Confidential, dated the 18th instant, and I authorised him, but subject to the proviso that there was no room left for doubt that the cattle were really stolen, to make the cattle over to the representative who had been left. This was done under detailed receipt. In issuing these orders I was actuated by the following considerations. There is at present no grass within our limits, and before any definite orders or arrangements could be made for the return of the stolen ■property to their owners, the large portion of tne sheep and goats must ka\e perished. Once the transfer of the property was made it was for the Kam and Seistan authorities to fight the matter out between themselves, and it seemed to me, in the circumstances ruling, to be very much better to inform the Kam authorities and let them do this than to risk the loss of most of the cattle. 4 I shall he glad to receive the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor- GeneraPs instructions as to the disposal of the 19 prisoners now m confinement at Kacha. 1 r . . ,, 5 There are under detention at Kacha some 10 camels which there is no reasonable doubt form part of property f f en BritamS Ws to trace their owners haye been unsuccessful, and should His Britannic Majesty Consul assist me here I shall he favoured.

Mornard had &gt; observed certain buildings at Kacha which he believed to \ be in Persian territory. I have not myself visited Kaoha, but 1 presume these are buildings for the Bobat troops* I do not know the Director's grounds for supposing that Kacha is in Persian territory, and in accordance with orders received from the Government of India last year (copy enclosed for ready reference) I did not attempt to discuss the question with him* As reagrds the complaints of British interference witl the Customs, the Director told me that he had made no com plaint or report of any sort* He admitted however that it was possible his Persian subordinates had done so as he said*fcid the Belgian* were alwaye under auspicion by the Persian government, Re told me that if a report had been sent of ttus kind, it probably referred to the visit of an * ir regular aoldier ' ( Chagai Levy ?) named, he thought, Yakub Khan to Duzdap in Persian territory, where some Oustoms* employes are stationed. According to X* Bottieau, this individual executed a m fanfarronade * at Duzdap and refused to pay passport fees. On the matter being reported to M, Bottieu, he had ordered that on this man’s next visit to Duzdap, if he again refused to pay, he should be arrested, M, Bottieau added that any complaint made by himslef to his departmental heads would as a matter of course have been accompanied by a Proces Verbal showing precisely what the offence alleged was and substantiating m it with whatever proofs were forthcoming. Prom the wording of the reports sent to you by the Persian Government and their vagueness, I imagine they must have come from a Persian source and were probably merely the outcome of a desire of some ignorant Persian Customs’ employe to exhibit his zeal. 2.T06 tilJ m UT luQ f ol u/d ti 2.

I have the honour to report that a Persian Sultan (Captainl named uhammad Azim from Koh-i-Mahk Siah, accompanied by a Naib and three men, visited Kacha on the 23rd and Piran Ziarat on the 24th August. 2. The Officer Commanding the Robat Detachment, who had had previous notice of the intended visit, sent orders to his Native officers at these places not to permit the Suitan and his party to cross the frontier but to meet him there and hold any conversation he wished but to be careful not to be drawn nito a quarrel with him if possible. This order readied Kacha after the Sultan’s visit but was acted on m the case of Piran Ziarat where the Sultan and his party were stopped on the frontier. 3. The meetings between the Sultan and the Native officers at both places were amicable. The Sultan informed the officers that he had received orders r™ Haklm ® e ^ an these places and ascertain if it was a fact that British troops had been stationed there and that forts were beino- erected and said that he would report that the former was true, but that there° was no truth in the report regarding the erection of forts. 4. The Sultan appeared to have a very hazy idea regarding the boundary and said he had been given to understand that the trade route formed the boundary between Baluchistan and Persia and that consequently both Kacha and Piran Ziarat were well within Persian limits. “The exact boundary,” the Officer Commanding Robat reports, was, however, “ pointed out to him by he Native officers ” and be was told that no aggression would be permitted under any circumstances. 5. What particular boundary was thus pointed out I have not yet learnt. It was obviously impossible for the Native officer to have given correct information on this point as no boundary line has been laid down. This, however, is immaterial as the information given by that officer, what ever it may have been, carries no weight, and it is extrem dy doubtful whether the Persian Sultan either understood it, or if he did, whether he correctly reported it. 6. Bam issuing renewed instructions to the Political Agent, Chagai, that no discussion of this kind on the part of our subordinates with Persian officials is ever to be permitted. Any Persian officials who visit our posts in a friendly manner sre to be treated politely, but referred for any information they require to higher authorities. Any who approach our posts in an unfriendly manner or decline to withdraw when requested to do so will be dealt with as the occasion demands. 7. As a sequel to the Sultan’s visit to Kacha and Piran, the Political Agent, Chagai, has received a further communication, dated September 1st, from the Karguzar of Seistan through His Britannic Majesty’s Consul. A translation, together with the original document, is forwarded herewith for information.

I do not propose to take any further action, or to be drawn into futile discussions with the local Persian authorities. They will doubtless get tired of ineffective attempts to reopen the question, and if the Persian Government ever make representations on the subject, these can easily be disposed of. In the meantime ray instructions to the Political Agent, Chagai, ensure the preservation of the status quo on which Sir A. Hardinge’s settlement of this boundary question was based. r r. « nr u Wn 0 dated 23 n d Kaiiab 1325 (1st September 1907), from the Translatmn to His Britannic Majesty's Consul in Seistan.

T have received to-day a regrettable report from Muhammad Azim Beg Sultan of Koh-i-Malik Siah, to the effect that 75 sepoys and a Jemadar with their arms and ammunition have established themselves ^ Kacha and O senovs with a Native officer have gone to Piran. The Sultan conversed with these people and learnt certain matters which are contrary to those which have come to light. It is a matter of deep regret that despite so great a friendship as exists between the two Governments, British employes, trespassing beyond their boundary, have entered Persian territory. I therefore most respectfully beg that yon will please take early steps to withdraw these men so as to avoid any chance of inimical feelings arising between the two Governments.

Extract from a letter } dated the 14th November 1907, from the Officer Commanding^the Rabat Escort, to the Eolitical Agent, Chagai. In reply to yours of the 8th instant, the Jemadar in Command of the Piran detachment on the occasion of Sultan Muhammad Azim’s visit made no definite statement regarding the line of the frontier. He told Muhammad Azim that he had no map and could not define the frontier, but that he knew for certain that the position on which he was encamped and all country north of the most northern Ziarat was in British territory, but he made no statement that country south of the Ziarat was in Persian territory or where the boundary commenced. r lhe Sultan himself prolessed equal ignorance but said he had always understood that the Robat-Nushki trade route formed the boundary. The Sultan was treated in every way in a friendly spirit and entertained both at Kacha and Piran which pleased him greatly, so Ashraf Khan informs me. ^ He offeied to make the Jamadar at Piran Katkhuda if he was willing to give him Rs.

But as regards Piran, it is beyond my power to make any alterations in the present state of things, as the particulars of the occupation of the place have been reported to the high officials of the Persian Government.

As regards the Piran question, the telegrams cited above show the present position. A later report will follow when Major Webb Ware’s report is received. ^ 3. As regards Kacha, it will be observed that the location of our levies there has not been seriously challenged, and that one of the Rekis of Kirtaka, which is well within our boundary, has cultivated there at intervals since 1897. The Persian bazgirs from the Duzdap side appear to have levied transit dues occasionally on caravans in this neighbourhood during the past three years, while we have collected for the last ten a tax on asafoetida taken from the hills. As to these minor points I await Major Webb Ware’s report before addressing the Government of India. 4. In connection with Piran the Government of India will observe that the visit of the Persian Sultan (or, apparently Officer in Command of Sarbazes) from Diwanchah, which was followed by the ejection of our levies, occurred on the 14th November, i.e.t after Lieutenant Daukes’ letter of the 5th November, to the Mumtahin*us-Sultana in which Piran and Kacha were referred to as Persian territory and the cultivators were said to be Afghans. I am not sure as to the extent to which our Consular Officers in the border territory of Persia are expected to intervene in regard to border questions. I think, however, that except in very exceptional and urgent cases, Consular action or intervention should not be allowed without a previous reference to the border administra tion concerned, if not to the Government of India. The first intimation received in this Agency that the presence of our levies at either Piran or Kacha Koh was in question was received under a telegram from the Consul, dated the 22nd November, in which it was stated that the Karguzar complained that the Robat levies had taken possession of Persian lands at Piran and Kacha, and that it was understood that he had turned out the Piran levies. The telegram further enquired what were the facts of the case. The Political Agent in reply, after reference to myself, requested the Consul to explain that the places where our levies were posted were within our boundary and that the Karguzar’s action was not understood, and that it was hoped that it would not be repeated. The enclosed copy of letter No. Ill, dated the 8th August 1905, from the Political Assistant in Chagai (Major Benn), shows the circumstances in which our men were sent to Piran, after the withdrawal of the Seistan Mission m the autumn of 1905. „ Telegram No. L.C.-20, dated the llth February 1907.

Prom—The Political Assistant, Chagai, To—The Pirst Assistant to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. I have the honour to inform you that during the recent visit of Colonel McMahon to Quetta on his return from Seistan an interview on the subject of the Perso-Baluch Frontier was held between the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General and Colonel McMahon at which I was present. The Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General will no doubt remember that at this interview Colonel McMahon urged very strongly the necessity ^ of our putting a few men without delay into two places along the Baluch-Persian border to the south-east of Koh-i-Malik Siah, viz.y at the Piran Ziarat and the Kacha river. Both these places are on important routes leading from Mirjawa and Persian Baluchistan through our territory to Afghanistan. Of the two the Piran Ziarat route is perhaps the more important. 2 . I have now the honour to report that, acting on the verbal instructions which I received from the flon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General at the above interview, I endeavoured to make arrangements to furnish the above two posts with some men. But it was found that to do so would have meant a reduction of our levy strength at the different thanas at the western end of the route to an extent which we could not afford to risk, especially as the Mission had at that moment been withdrawn from Seistan. As a temporary measure and pending the establishment of the new*first class levies along the route, I have been able to make the following arrangement for the establishment of a small *Pir - a ? Ziarat i w 1 1 ^oTit incurring any extra expenditure to Government. IheChaga! Levy establishment includes a post of “ Jemadar of camels ” at Lalbandm on Rs. 20 per mensem.^ This appointment was apparently created in e early days of the route when it was often necessary for travellers to obtain tresh camels at Dalbandin. With the introduction of the new camel contract whereby the contractors are bound to supply camels straight through to Seistan, the necessity for a Government camel agent at Dalbandin appears to me to have disappeared. I have, therefore, subject to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor- General’s approval, done away with the appointment and utilized the pay of the Jemadar (Rs. 20} for two extra Levy footmen (on Rs. 10 per mensem) who have already taken up their quarters at Piran Ziarat. 3. Eor the second post at Kacha river I propose finding a temporary estab lishment in the following way:— It is proposed that six men with a thorough knowledge of the country should be enlisted locally at Robat as guides for service in the new first class levies. It will be sometime before the detachment of the new levies, who are now being enlisted in Mastung, can be equipped and made ready for Robat. The men whom it is proposed to enlist locally as guides could, however, be enlisted at once at Robat, and I would suggest sending two or more of them without delay to reside at the Kacha river post until some better arrangement can be made. I should be ^lad to know if the above proposals meet with the approval of the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General. Extract from the Seistan Consular diary No. 3 for the period 14th to 19th January 1907 . ******* Regarding the Piran incident, the Mumtahin said his action was forced on him by M. Nikrassof. The latter, he The Piran incident. stated, had brought and exhibited to him a map, and had pointed out that encroachments were being made on Persian territory at Piran and Kacha. The Mumtahin went on to say that he had referred the matter to Lieutenant Daukes, who, in his reply, had admitted that Piran and Kacha were Persian territory, and had informed him that the people settled there were Afghans. The Mumtahin had accordingly taken necessary steps to re-establish Persian rights. On my asking him whether, now that he had been made acquainted with the true facts, he was prepared to restore the status quo, he replied, firstly, that the matter was being settled at Tehran, and, secondly, that he had telegraphed his resignation and could therefore take no further action. As regards the alleged admission of Persian rights to Piran and Kacha, it is only necessary to say, that without specially admitting the Persian claims in the preamble of his letter of the 5th November, Lieutenant Daukes referred to “ Piran and Kacha in Persian territory.” As half of Piran at any rateseems to belong to Persia, the sentence admits of interpretation m two wavs The admission, such as it was, has been subsequently corrected and cannot of course be accepted as a reasonable excuse for the Mumtahin s refusal restore the status quo. , ...

C. Webb Ware, C.I.E., the Political Agent in Chagai. 2. It will be perceived from these reports that in May 1905, when the recent agreement between our own and the Persian Governments was concluded, the status as regards occupation at Piran was as follows. There had been cultivation on the various small plots that are culturable on the river bank by the Zarezais, who can hardly be described as British subjects although they spend part of their time in British limits, part in the Garmsel of Afghanistan and part in Seistan. This culti vation considerably antedated the Holdich delimitation, but apparently ceased in 1894 and was resumed in the summer of 1906, in which season the two levies, who were posted at Piran by my orders in 1905 cultivated a small plot with melons. The Zarezais had also erected a small Ziarat 15 years ago among the other Ziarats at Piran. There is no evidence of any other sort of occupation in Piran. There is nothing to show that, before 1905, there was any transaction there which could be construed into occupancy or control by or with the permission of the Persian Government. 3. As regards Kacha we have had cultivation by our people at Kacha Thana from 1897 to 1900. We maintained a levy post there up to 1899 when it was removed and have levied taxes on the collections of asafoetida within Colonel McMahon’s blue line for ten years. There is no question about our right to post our levies and to permit cultivation here. There have been one or two unjusti fiable collections by Persian “ bazgirs ” of grazing dues from British subjects within our boundary since 1903, but any Persian claim here appears to me to be quite untenable. The Kacha portion of the case presents no difficulty. 4. The Piran part of the case, however, is not so easy. Colonel McMahon’s blue line from peak 7714 northwards to Koh-i-Malik Siah does not represent a delimited boundary. It represents an illustration of an incorrect definition and its adoption as our boundary is admittedly inconvenient. What then are the limits of occupation on this section ? If we are to apply the criterion of the status quo ante May 1905, then I was perhaps wrong in posting the two levies there in the autumn of 1905. There were no levies on our part there before that date: the status was one of intermittent Zarezai occupation. By the agreement of May 1905, however, the frontier is to be regarded as definitely settled in accordance with the agreement of 1896 and no further claim is to be made in respect of it. The agree ment of 1896 does not mention Piran Ziarat, but, in paragraph 15 of his report No. 77-T. H. of the 23rd June 1896, Colonel Holdich states that the Piran Ziarat on the banks of the stream of that name is exactly on the line. Hence there was no irregularitv in the despatch of the two levies to Piran : such action does not const! tute the making of a further claim. The hypothetical boundary is up to the Ziarat.: The Persian action in removing the Zarezais and in claiming a boundary up to, the trade route has been quite unjustifiable. _ But, as I have already reported,: we are not in a position to claim Piran in entirety. If we can send our levies to | the Ziarat the Persians do not appear to be barred from cultivating up to i . ; Hence I doubt if there are adequate reasons for removing the Shahizai cultivators^- the interlopers of Major Webb Ware’s report-whom the Persian official from Diwan Chah placed there last winter. The return of the Zarezais and the re stora- tion of our levies there appear to be as much action as is now called for and this has been taken. In Kacha we are retaining our levies and cultivation. Majoi Webb Ware is in error in mentioning the Padagi spring on .the Kacha side as being in Persian limits : it is not so, in the absence of evidence of Persian occu- pation. 5205 F. D.I 5. In view of ^ Stdtle KaLaKoi, can hardly be regarded as leaving the Piran Ziarats on the British side. , , • pnT1T1 p r tion with the case generally that the acqui- 6.

To-The First Assistant to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General m Baluchistan. _ _ In eomnliance with the orders conveyed me in Foreign Department telegram M l 1 r Tted 7th January, I have the honour to submit two memoranda, each consideration and orders. i p t&gt;- i,- -u+ iv 2 It will be noted that the boundary in the neighbourhood of Piran which the Perso-Baluch delimitation agreement lays down, is a line earned straight from the highest point of the KachaKoh to the highest point of the Malik Siah Koh, docs not cross the river, as the British Commissioner understood was the case, at the point known as “ Piran Ziarat ” (vide paragraph 15 of his report) : but at a point some 2 445 yards further up-stream, i.e., to the south. The bend which the river makes at this point, which the map I attach illustrates, is no doubt responsible for this error. The boundary as shown in this map is the correct one : but, if it be decided that the frontier bisects “ Piran Ziarat ”, I foresee that a difficulty will arise for the Persians will doubtlessly claim the most northern Ziarat as being the “ Ziarat ” intended, whereas it is equally certain that we are justified m claiming the most southern. If we take Piran Ziarat to mean the land of that name, then another difficulty presents itself, for any division of this land will leave the water supply on the Persian side and, unless provision is made to regulate them, quarrels are likely to ensue between the Zarizai owners and the Shahazai interlopers. 3. In the course of his interview with His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, as referred to in Sir C. Spring Rice’s telegram No. 18, dated the 15th January, the Grand Vizier is understood to have stated that no military officials were deputed to Piran. I would venture to traverse this for Muhammad Hussain, who is stationed at Diwan Chah and enjoys the rank of Sultan, visited Piran on the 14th November and depriving the Zarizai of the lands they possess not only at Piran Ziarat but also those situated to the north, our claim to which cannot be contested, escorted them to a point 7 miles down the river, near to where it dis charges itself, and returned by way of the trade route and Robat. I think we are justified in taking exception to this action as it is clearly an infringement of the May 1905 agreement. 4. It will be noted that, on the occasion of his visit to Piran, Sultan Muhammad Hussain alleged that Persian territory extended north as far as the trade route. His action on the occasion tends to demonstrate that such was his belief. It will also be noted that the Bazgirs who visited Saindak in October alleged the same. I think that we are entitled to ask that Persian officials stationed on the frontier may be instructed regarding this subject for claims of this nature, although no doubt they are advanced by ignorant officials, do not make for the preservation of the 1905 agreement which it is our desire to see upheld. 5. As regards Kacha I have nothing to remark except to invite a reference to Sir H. McMahon’s secret report dealing with the frontier in this neighbourhood, and to add that the point where the levies were posted is that shown as “ Kacha Thana ” on the map and that the drainage basin of the Kacha river, as delineated on sheet No. 14-N. W., is correct. 6. I would express regret that this report has been so greatly delayed. The cause of this is the inclemency of the weather I have encountered since my arrival on this frontier. rPlRAN. cut by the Perso-Baluch Boundary and^ ba * n ^ S °f Pl * ran river near wheTe H is amounting to some 8 or 10 acres ci]ltivr+ S1 ^l S v° ^ V&lt; ' ?, lec ?? * an ^ collectively Rustam Khan Kutkhuda of Dekdela in Par 6 Tu Rashlc * K han » brother to Baluch interlopers.

South of Abdulla bad at a distance of 220 yards, is placed the most important land on the river which is known as “ Piran Ziarat ”, a name derived from the several Ziarats in the vicinity. It is an elongated stretch of ground some 355 yards in length by 165 yards in breadth at the widest. About 330 yards above Piran Ziarat comes the last piece termed Murghi ” which is watered from the same channel which supplies Piran Ziarat. In area it is insignificant. The lands north of Piran Ziarat each possess their own irrigation channel taking off from the main supply in the. river bed. The water for the Piran Ziarat cultivation takes its rise in a patch of jungle in the river bed some 770 yards up-stream. Ziarats .—These number four and enumerated from north to south are as follows:— (i) Syed Langar, 330 yards north of the Piran Ziarat cultivation. (ii) Shahid Langar situated 190 yards to the south of No. (i) and said to be the Ziarat of No. one’s disciple. (iii) Syed Hussain Langar, 170 yards south of No. (ii) and said to be the Ziarat of No. one’s son. (iv) Pir Sultan Ziarat, 180 yards south of No. (iii). In addition to the foregoing there is a small ziarat a few yards west of No. (ii) which was erected, so Kutkhuda Rustam, who came in from Garmsel to see me and has proved of great assistance, tells me by his idiot son Wali some 15 years ago but it is generally regarded as being spurious. As to which of the foregoing is the most important is a question which it is not easy to decide. Nos. (ii) and (iii) may be eliminated, the sanctity attached to them being of small import; the difficulty lies in deciding between the relative merits of Nos. (i) and (iv). The ziarats of Pir Sultan and Syed Langar are usually to be found in close juxtaposition throughout the western portion of this Agency. Of the two saints the Pir Sultan has the larger following and is regarded as being the most powerful for good or evil; while this is so, however, the question in reality resolves itself into one of belief. The followers of the Syed regard him as being the premier whereas the adherents of Pir Sultan, who allege that their saint was a companion of the Prophet, traverse this. Counting the graves which each ziarat claims as its own did not show a way out of the difficulty, for, whereas the Syed Ziarat has 25 graves to its credit, as against Pir Sultan Ziarat’s 16, it was explained that certain Zarizai wayfarers, whose saint is the Syed, lost 8 children, while passing a few years ago through Piran, from fever of a malignant type, thus giving the Syed’s Ziarat the present balance of graves in its favour.e 4 Routes leading from Piran.

This is the only land which has, so far, been cultivated directly or indirectly by us. Prior to last year the Piran lands had not been cultivated since 1894. Recent events .—In July 1905 two sowars were stationed at Piran and two at Kacha to guard these roads and to keep an eye on the traffic which passes through with special regard to the illicit trade in arms, a very necessary precaution as the records show. On the 14th November a Persian Sultan named Muhammad Hussain, accompanied, among others, by Lai Muhammad and Dur Muhammad Shahozai, arrived at Piran. He enquired of Rashid Khan what he was doing there and directed him to withdraw. Rashid Khan said that he was cultivating lands which the Zarizai had held from upwards of a generation. The Sultan rejoined that as they were not Persian subjects the Zarizai must quit Piran forthwith and placing their more important possessions on three camels, he had with him, he escorted them, in person, to a point 7 miles north of Piran Ziarat situated close to the mouth of the Piran river and leaving them there made his way back to Diwan Chah via the trade route and Robat. The Sultan informed the Zarizai, as he also did the levies, that they were trespassing on Persian territory whose limits extended, he alleged, as far as the trade route. Some few days later the same Sultan sent instructions by Lai Muhammad to eject our levies which was accordingly done. The levies have since been replaced and are still at Piran Ziarat. They reside on the left bank of the river a few yards north of Ziarat No. 1, where they have instructions to remain. Boundary .—A reference to the accompanying map drawn by a member of my office, late of the Government of India Survey Department, is requested. If a straight line carried from Koh-i-Malik Siah to the highest peak of the Kacha Koh range is held, as it certainly is, to be the boundary, then all the lands at Piran, enumerated in this memorandum, fall on our side of the frontier, for, as will be seen, the boundary passes 705 yards west of the left bank of the river opposite Piran Ziarat. If, however, the frontier is taken to bisect Piran Ziarat, vide the explanation accompanying Colonel T. Holdich, Commissioner, Perso-Baluch Delimitation s report, the question which presents itself for settlement is which ziarat is to be regarded as that referred to by him. As this is a problem whose solution appearsUkely to offer considerable difficulty, the most equitable settlement would appear to be in dividing the Piran Ziarat lands equally between Persia and ourselves. Remarks. The status quo in May 1905 and the status quo ante are sufficiently explained in the body of this memorandum. The Zarizais returned to Piran on their /^own initiative. They have been warned, and the levies instructed, not to interfere with Persians, i.e., Shahozai Baluch cultivators. There are no sarbazes at Piran, and none were left there by Sultan Muhammad Hussain. F.C. WEBB WARE, Major, Political Agent, Chag^o. Kacha. The existing map. —With reference to Sir H. McMahon’s signed map sheet No. 14-N.-W., dated Seistan, 5th November 1904, it may be well to premise this memo randum by saying that the several peaks south of Kacha through which his blue boundary line passes, enumerated from east to west, are :— The mountain which connects peak 7157’ a with peak 7336 and thence continues to Kacha is named the Mazawad range ; these two peaks being termed, respectively, “ Kisan Mazawad” and “ Mazan Mazawad ” or Mazawad the lower and Mazawad the higher. The peak due south of Kacha “ thana ” which is cut by the blue boundary line is named Bagh-Koh and peak 7033, which lies nearly due west from here, is term ed Padagi Koh, the name under which the western prolongation of this mountain is also known. The range which the blue boundary line follows from peak 7157 to Bagh-Koh is the Suntabad range and the large nullah lying immediately below its northern foot is named the Suntabad nullah. It may incidentally be remarked that the word “ Sant” in the Baluchi language means “ devoid of.” There is no water in the nullah. Within the Kacha drainage limits, as marked by the blue boundary line, there are, excluding the nullah just named, three important nullahs. That shown on the map running parallel to the southern foot of the Kacha Koh enjoys the name of the Pourchinki nullah. There is a spring of water in a small at the head of this nullah but the supply although good and constant is scanty. The large nullah which runs near the northern foot of Padagi is known as Padagi JNuilah. South-east of Padagi Koh there is a spring of water known as the Padagi spring which yields an abundant supply but it hes on the Persian side of the frontier, the main drainage nullah flowing north-east from Bagh hil is known up to the point it approaches Kacha “ Thana ” as the Bagh nullah and the large nullah, which runs north-west parallel to the Mazawad range and forms one of the mam feeders of the a®tautprinlthf suppty t ^ a^ugh apparently springsof wate^whichare'to b'e^found^within°Kacha 'as^re^ards those of Chedegi and Mazawad.

The cultivators have been informed that they have permission to cultivate such land as they did last summer but that they should not extend its limits, at present, 4thout sanction. The actual ownership of the Kacha land itself, has never so far, been called in question and there would appear no likelihood of its being so. leeies.-Two levies were posted here in July 1905 with orders to prevent the passage of Gulf rifles through the district. On their arrival at Kacha they repaired one of the rooms in the old thana and have lived in it ever since They have been instructed to remain where they are and to request any Persian official who may put in an appearance to withdraw as his presence there is inadmissible. These orders were transmitted to the levies early in January and I satisfied myself by personal enquiry that they were fully acquainted with them. Recent events.—We have levied a tax for the past ten years on the Kakars who come from Zhob to collect asafcetida in this district. This tax has been taken on asafcetida collected within the limits of the ' blue boundary line south of Kacha but never beyond or to the south of this; the water parting has always been regarded as the boundary. In the summer of 1903 certain Persian Bazgirs (tax-collectors), whose names are not forthcoming, levied grazing tax within this limit on some Dalbandin graziers who are British subjects. This action has been repeated on two or three occasions since. In March 1906 two bazgirs, named, respectively, Ibrahim and Kamalan, levied “ Rahdari ” on a caravan in the immediate vicinity of Kacha itself. In August last year five men visited Kacha. The party came from Duzdap and consisted of Juma Khan, Pasand Khan, Mamasani’s son, two bazgirs named, respectively, Kamalan and Hussain and they were accompanied by two followers. They informed the cultivators that they had been deputed to destroy their melon beds and they gave as their reason that this was because they were British subjects. The Kirtaka levy Duffadar was present on this occasion and he requested them to withdraw saying that Persian claims to the Kacha basin were not admissible and adding that if they resorted to force he would reluctantly be compelled to do likewise. They then returned whence they came after threatening to pay the Duffadar out. In October two bazgirs named Ibrahim and Kamalan demanded a tax from certain Zhob Kakars who had collected asafoetida on Mazawad and between 1 that range and the northern spurs of the Bagh Koh. Payment was declined and ultimatly both parties, Bazgirs and Kakars alike, visited Saindak. The former claimed the right to collect taxes on all territory which lay south of the trade route which they alleged was the boundary between Persian and British Baluchistan. The Thanedar declined to discuss this surprising claim and the Kakars paid us the tax which was due from them. Towards the end of November the Persian Sultan Muhammad Hussain, who it will be remembered visited Piran in November and ejected the cultivators from there, sent word to Kacha that he proposed shortly inspecting that place and that if he found any cultivation he would destroy it. This threat was not carried into force.t T 0. /e2f/? ? Frotn ^?}u? Dexmty Sec rotary to tlie Govwnuaeiit of Zn&amp;ia in tlu?

The Consul at Persian claim to Kaeha and Piran. culturable land on the Seistan reports that a dispute has arisen con cerning two plots of vaguely defined boundary between Baluchistan and Sarhad at Piran and Kacha, about 30 miles south of Koh-i-Malik Siah. The Vice-Consul at Koh-i- Malik Siah reports that a small party of Sarbazes, under an officer belonging to the Koh-i-Malik Siah detachment, visited Piran with the object of expelling the occupants who belong to our Bohat levies, and that the land has been handed over to Persian subjects. On a reference being made to the Karguzar of Seistan, he stated that Piran and Kacha were both on the Persian side of the boundary line, but this was denied by the Political Agent, Chagai. Pending decision of the question, the Karguzar has agreed to take no action. The matter has been reported to the British Minister at Tehran, and his attention has been drawn to Sir H. McMahon’s memo randum, dated 5th November 1904, on the Perso-Baluch boundary question, and the map annexed thereto. It has been pointed out that the principles underlying the settle ment, which was ultimately arrived at by Sir A. Hardinge at Tehran, were that the boundary should not he specifically defined, that the status quo should be adhered to, further claim should he made no and that — . ,, ,, by either side. The status quo meant the then existing conditions of occupation by either side. The action of the Persian Sarbazes m expelling our people is therefore unwarrant able, and it is proposed, unless Sir C. Spring- Bice sees any objection, to issue orders for the restoration of the status quo by causing the Sarbazes to remove forthwith. \3 o^- Telegram, No. 529 C., dated Seistan, the 13th (despatched from Robat on 15th) December 1906. From Lieutenant C. T. Daukes, His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Seistan and Kain, Seistan, To—The Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. The subjoined telegram, No. 211, has been sent to Sir C. Spring-Rice Begins. Dispute had arisen concerning two plots of culturable land situated on vaguely defined boundary between Baluchistan and Sarhad at Piran and Kacba, about 30 miles south of Kuh-Malik-Siah. Both these places are situated almost exactly on the boundary line as shown in our maps. The Vice-Consul at Kuh-Malik-Siah reports that a small party of Sarbazes, under an officer belonging to the Kuh-Malik-Siah detachment, visited Piran with the object of expelling the occupants who belong to our Robat Levies, and that the land has been handed over to Persian subjects. On a reference being made to the Karguzar, he stated that Piran and Kacha both lay on the Persian side of the boundary line. This, however, has been telegraphically denied by the Political Officer at Chagai. Pending decision of the question, the Karguzar has agreed to take no action. I would suggest that the Vice-Consul at Kuh-Malik-Siah be sent, if possible, to report on position in company with some responsible Persian official. The matter might thus be settled without further difficulty. The Karguzar states that he cannot depute official himself, but has agreed to recommend this step. Ends. Extract from the Chagai Diary for week ending the 24th November 1906. ****** 5 His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan, has telegraphed to the Political Asent' to say that the Karguzar has lodged a protest in regard to the two Balueh posts which were established at Kacha Koh and Piran Ziarat so iar hack as 1905 It would appear from the Consul’s wire that the Karguzar’s rnen have actually elected the Khassadars who were stationed at Piran on the fround lhat they well in occupation of Persian territory. The Pol tical Agent lescredited this, as he had received no intimation on the subject from Bobat, hut in reply to telegraphic enquiries which he has made it transpires that the Karguzar’s statement is correct, and that his men have actually done this. The Political Agent has wired to ascertain the precise position which this post occupied. ^ ***** Telegram, No. S. 198, dated the 25th December 1906.

It is true a Persian party recently caused our levies, wdio have been posted at Piran since July last year, to leave the place. Piran is on the boundary, and there is no reason for believing our men w r ere on the Persian side of it while w r e have had a post at Kacha off and on for some ten years. Political Agent or Assistant will proceed to spot before long to make enquiries and report further. Meanwhile, I do not recommend joint examination suggested by Seistan Consul, which seems inconsistent with Agreement of May last year, while a Baluchistan officer should be party to any examination of the kind if it were necessary.

The Vice-Consul, Kuh-i-Malik Siah, just come in after visiting Piran. From his report the position is shown to he as follows The exact boundary is difficult to determine as there are several ziarats adjacent to one another. The land cultivated by Chagai Levies has been extended this year, and if we assume that the boundary line passes through the principal ziarats, it is possible that a few yards of Persian territory have been taken up. The Chagai Levies were dispossessed not only of this, but also of other plots of cultivation which are without doubt British territory. There was no Persian cultivation at Piran till November. Then cultivators from Persian village Duzdap were posted, and they are now in possession. There are no Persian Sarbazes at Piran.
