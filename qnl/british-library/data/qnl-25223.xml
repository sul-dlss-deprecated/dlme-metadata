Xou are also, no doubt aware, that tho wording of the Treaty of irzeroum, road in conjunction vith the explanatory notes attached thereto, purports to give the whole of the waters of the ahatt-al-Arab to Turke,, only allowing Persia the Town of nohanaaerah and its anchorage on tho -arun; Mid further that when the Turxo-Persian Houndary Commissioners met in the 8hatt-al-Arab in 1850 to endeavour to fix the frontier and the representatives of the two countries made unreasonable cross claims, of the nature of which you are generally aware, the two English and Russian mediating Commissioners expressed the view that an equitable boundary might be considered to run from the mouth of the Abu Jidlyeh Canal direct through Rishk-i-Basri to Ilawizch. By the adoption of till a lino the strip of riparianground between Abu Jidiyeh Garni and Diaiji would fall to Turkey, It tborotora til# question of tiia ^iribi a tan boundary should bs oarriod to th© Hague Court, it is oonoidared by legal ox- parts very doubtful whether Persia would be awarded nearly as good a frontier as that which now soome to be locally observed, and it consequently seems of the highest importance to Persia and more particularly to lour excellency, that all reference to th© Hague should be avoided by the conclusion of an amicable compromise in regard to this part of the Frontier. The above considerations have prompted nis majesty's Go vernment to do their utmost, in the interests of yourself and of the Persian Government to get Tux-key to agree, without go ing to the nague, to a settlement which as far as possible Confirms th® frontier as-locally observed, and which, as ex plained above, will be much more favourable to yourself and to Persia than the line recommended by the Mediating Commis sioners in 1860. The boundary line which we hav© put forward rune as fol lows: - Coming from that branch of the buvrairij called the Hhor- ©1-huhaisin, it passes Southwards across the wior-ol-As am until it reaches the main channel of the marsh just west of th© village of Shuaib. Thence it continues In a southerly direction down the sain© channel through the Marsh until it arrives due West of kishk-i-Baari • From that point it breaks back and passes inja straight line to aishk-i-Basri itself and from thence again it turns and proceeds due south until it reaches th© vicinity of Diaiji near th© ^hatt-al-Arab. ^@ra it becomes til© boundary at present locally observed and ©n- tering th© xdiaiyin Canal, (the channel running from the Cus toms post at Diaiji between the islands of nhamubiyah, Do- war in , Aqawat and Idle mainland as far as the junction of Kahr B assail eh with the Shat t-al-Arab and sahr Abul Arabid), it follows the middle line of the xdior xdiaiyin until it reaches the point wner© the Buhr Dliaiyin and the Aahr Aazailoh meetthe left bank of the Shatt-al-Arab or on the Persian islands tii#rein which is covered at nonsrtl low tida# Firtjhix.

YOUR telegram No. 424 and Bush ire telegram of 6 th August. Copies of the maps of the Mohammerah frontier which we have proposed to Turkish Government were posted to Tehran and Bushire on 19 th July. The line which we have proposed to Turkey is more advantageous to Persia than that which was proposed by mediating commissioners in 1850 and then accepted by Persia, so that Persia should be satisfied if Turkey accedes to our present proposal. It seems to me that the most expedient course now would be for you to communicate a copy of the map confidentially to the Persian Government, for Sir P. Cox to do likewise to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and for Mr. Marling to do likewise to the Persian delegates at Constantinople ; at the same time it might be explained that, while we hope to secure the frontier we have proposed, we are not satisfied, in view of the wording of article 2 of the Treaty of Erzeroum, that Turkey is legally bound to recognise the modern port and anchorage of Mohammerah in so far as it is in the main stream of the Shatt-el-Arab and not in the Karun, and on this point it may be impossible to maintain the line we have proposed to Turkey ; but we will do our best, and in any case we should provide against any arbitrary interference with the commercial interests of the port of Mohammerah. Before deciding on this course I should like your observations and those of Sir P. Cox, and I am asking Mr. Marling to furnish me with his views.

I am unable to send more than one copy of each of items (in) and (y) on account of the difficulty of copying them. The originals of the above papers were sent by the Turkish Foreign Office to the Turkish Consulate at Lingah, where the British Vice-Consul represents Turkish interests. In doing so the Turkish Foreign Office must have forgo^en that their Consul at Lingah was an Englishman ; and it would seem that they must also have been under some curious illusion as to the relative positions of Lingah and the disputed tracts on the Turco-Persian frontier. The Political 1 Resident in the Persian Gulf, not being able to get the papers translated at Bushire, referred them to me ; and I am now returning them to him accompanied by translations.

(For the Minister for Foreign Affairs.) Copy of a Report by the Persian Frontier Commission addressed to the Grand “\d izier • Investigation has been made in regard to the places which were from old time parts of Turkey, but which have been usurped by the Persians at different epochs. This investigation was based on the articles, still in force, of treaties signed between the two Powers since the year 1049 A. H. and on evidence confirming and explaining the said articles. According to this investigation and to the old entries discovered during its course in the Daftarkhana (Land Records office), the Turco-Persian frontier, as fixed by treaty, begins as was stated in a written report of the 15th Kianuni awwal 1327, at the river Aras, and leaving the greater part of the lake of Urmi on the Turkish side, ends on the lake (a) Possibly Masho of the r.g. s. map (1919). of Urmi at a point upon the general line J.G.L, passing from the highest part of the Nisham (o) mountains over Keshki Sarai and Elma Sarai. From the lake of Urmi, from a place very close to the so-called Tash kesan (“stonecutter”), the frontier runs to the summit of the Sahend mountain ; and the Liwas (Civil Divisions) of Achari Mahali, Afshar, Avroman Monvan and Sihna and its dependencies remain on the Turkish side. inai is to say, mat me whole basin ot the Jaghatu river and its tributaries together with the westerly slopes of the Naran mountains and the Liwa o Jawanrud and its dependencies belong to the Turkish Empire.

But in order to derive full advantage from the records and evidence now available, and in order to explain exactly the line of the frontier, a complete map is required showing the places entered in the records (of the Daftarkhana). No such exists in the Department of the General Staff of the Army or the Diwan-i-Humayun (? Archives Office) ; nor has one of the sort ever been published in Europe. Consequently it is most necessary, first of all, to indicate the places in a map. As a means to this and booklets containing the names found in the Khaqani (Land Records office) archives have been printed, and the requisite printed sketch maps have been attached to the said booklets, and empty columns for remarks have been provided in the booklets for the purpose of entering opposite to the name of each place any information relating to it. These booklets and sketch-maps should be sent to the Civil officials of the Wilayats of Erzroum, Van, Musal, Baghdad and Basrah through the Ministry of the Interior; and to the Military officers in the neighbourhood of the frontier through the Ministry of War; and to the Ottoman Consuls in Persia and in the vicinity of the frontier through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The said officials and officers should be instructed to make the necessary investigation and enquiries as soon as possible, in accordance with the instruc tions* attached to the said booklets. The * A translation of the instructions is attached. j^ na | resu i ts should be very clearly entered in the column of remarks opposite to each name; and the precise situation of each place should be marked in the sketch- map with the best possible approximation; and finally the said booklets and sketch-maps should be forwarded through the Ministries mentioned to the Com mission, for examination. But, as the investigations to be made by the Civil and Military officials separately cannot be extended beyond the places where they are posted, and as those places which require investigation and examination most of all are places now wrongly in the hands of the Persians, some officers of the General Staff of the Army who are employed as Military officers at military stations in the region in Question and who have sufficient local information about the region, and who are fiUor the work should be sent to the Ottoman Consulates which a.e directed to take action under pretext of examining the accounts and . 0 ^ h c e er S s al c d 0 . 0 e ! dulates or on some other excuse, and that in civil dress. If these otticers co ope rate with the Consuls it will expedite and facilitate the investigations and examinations, and the situations of the places named, which are to be shown m the sketch-maps, will be fixed with greater exactness. It is necessary that these officers of the General Staff of the Army should Affairs by correspondence.

These places lie between a general line (running from th ® ras bj the western side of the Qarah Dagh, Tabriz, Afshar Hama4an Kirmanshah, and Shushtar to the Persian Gulf and the WHayats of Erz ~ u ™* ^ Baghdad and Basrah. The treaties in force and the old records ° f *e ^d Re cords office show that these places belong to Turkey and that at different the Persians have usurped them. The said booklets and sketch-maps have been made for the P^P^es of proving the facts in question, as between the Ottoman and the Persian D e J e S or at the Court of The Hague, and also for the purpose of fixing the said front precisely. 1. As there are no maps available, the requisite investigations should be made, especially on the Persian side, and the geographical position or situation of the places named in the booklets should be ascertained and entered in the maps as correctly as possible. They should be written very clearly and legi y • and any information which may be obtained should be written in the column ot remarks. 2. The direction of important mountain chains and their spurs and of rivers and their valleys in the said places, especially between Liwas and Nahiyahs, should also be shown by best approximation. This might help the work of deli mitation. It should be done as soon as possible. 3. If any old records and Farmans or Boyourouldis can be obtained in regard to the names in the booklets, numbers should be put in the columns of remarks and the same numbers should be put on copies of them, and the copies should be annexed to the booklets. 4. If any old Farmans, etc., are found in the hands of private individuals, these should be copied and the originals returned to the holders ; but it should be noted on the margin of each Farman in whose possession it is. Special care should be taken in copying them correctly and in writing their dates. 5. If the new information obtained discloses names of villages, etc., which do not exist in the booklets, these names should be written in the empty spaces in the pamphlet and the information regarding them should be entered in the column of remarks. 6. If no information can be obtained in regard to some of the names men tioned in the pamphlet, it should be noted in the column of observations, opposite to each name, that no information could be obtained relating to that item. Special care should be taken in distinguishing the frontiers of the two Powers and in ascertaining the boundaries of Liwas and Nahiyehs.7. If it seems impossible to write all the names in full on the map, a numeri cal figure may be put at the geographical point of any name and the name can be given on the margin of the map, repeating the same numerical figure there. 8. Each official will receive instructions from his superior officers to treat this work as very confidential, but we also ,may observe that it should be done very confidentially and promptly. 9. After the enquiries and investigations have been completed and the information received has been added, the booklets and sketch-maps should be returned to the Commission assembled in the Department of the Grand Vizier. The booklets and sketch-maps should be returned to the Commission by the Department from which the officials have received them. Special care must be taken that the booklets and maps are not given to foreigners or lost; and they should be returned to the Commission with as little delay as possible. G. c. B.

Secondly —Present anchorage is in mid-stream from the mouth of the Karun up-stream for about 2,000 yards, but if mooring buoys were provided it would be possible to berth all ships on the Persian side of the mid-channel line. As many as 10 ships already are occasionally to be seen lying at anchor at Mohammerah at one time and as double berthing 13 not . practicable and as allowance is necessary for the future increase in size of ships, f^horage must be considered to run 4) ooo yards up-stream.

It is very difficult to dog tise in these cases, and all that can be said with confidence ^ is that the village west of Hawizeh is habitually pronounced by the local Arabs in two syllables, w i e they invariably pronounce the name of the stream at its junction with the Shatt-al- Arab, in one syllable, doubtless for purposes of distinction. 4.

The result of the triangulation by planetable, and of the astronomical ine resuu r .P uracv 0 f t he Commissioners determiation observations, was ' This be i ng t he case, there seems no doubt that the ad Jus^ment'made inThe ^lane^able sketch enclosed in your letter No. M-,8, dated May 6th, was necessary, the difficulties of tnangulat.on between Snwaiyib and Kishk-i-Basri being in the opinion of the Surveyor sufficient to_ account Z the discrepancy in latitudinal distance. 1 had hoped to oe able to vistt Jefa.r to confirm its position, but was not able to do so owing to lack of water and of facilities for transporting it there. 4. To turn to the question of the frontier north-west of Hawizeh with a view to fixing accurately the position of Bisaitin, on the Karkheh, as well as Hawizeh by triangulation, I found it best to proceed thither direct from Nasiri, extending in a north-westerly direction the triangulation which had been carried out in 1910 as far as Kut Hashim under my supervision. Bisaitin is some 18 miles north-north-west of Hawizeh and is the last inhabited place in this direction until Pusht-i-Kuh is reached, the low hills north of the Karkheh being uninhabited except for occasional incursions of nomads such as the Khasrij, on their way to commit depredations in the neighbourhood of Dizful, or of the Bani Lam when seeking in Persian territory a safe refuge from the importunities of the Turkish tax-gatherer. Bisaitin is therefore popularly spoken of as the limit of the Hawizeh district to the north west. 5. When questioning the Shaikhs of the Bani Turuf, who exclusively in habit this corner of the district, regarding the Turko-Persian frontier in their neighbourhood, I found a disposition among them to distinguish between the boundary of Persia and their own tribal limits, though they themselves are the sole Wardens of the Marches in this direction. The frontier of Persia, they said, was the main stream of the Dawairij River from the point where it left Pusht-i-Kuh, past the Turkish frontier fort on the ’Amarah-Dizful track (on the west bank of the stream), and past a locality called Khaiyit-us*Sultan, and then along the old main channel (now dry) called “ Shatt-al-Ama ” and “ Ghor Muhaisin ” on the map of the Commissioners. Thence to the Azaim or ’Azam, a small sheet of open water in the middle of the marsh some distance west of Shwaiyib down the Suwaib stream until the boundary line turned off, at some indefinite point, to Kishk-i-Basri. 6. I then pressed the Shaikhs to give me details of the frontier as actually observed and occupied by their tribesmen : this they willingly consented to do, and arranged for me to visit it by boat ; it turned out to be the dry bed of a stream, some 8 miles north-west of Bisaitin marked Ghor-ed-Douvil (Hor-at- Tawil ?) on the Commissioners’ map ; this stream they said had formerly carried the bulk of the waters of the Dawairij, but had now been dry for many years ; it was known locally as the Dawairij Maiyit (the dead Dawairij) or as Umm Chir. Herds of buffaloes and tracks worn by flocks over the barren plain showed that up to this point they were undoubtedly in actual occupation of the land, t.ie actual owners of the buffaloes being Saiyids of the Bani Turuf. When asked why they did not occupy the land between Umm Chir and the fron tier which they claimed for Persia, some 7 miles distant, they replied that the an s in question were barren and liable to raids by Turkish and Persian nomads, thatthey were waterless the marsh water being quite undrinkable even by cattle and that they feared that were they to go further westwards trouble would result. I was in fact, unable to induce them to take me to the Turko-Pers ; an boundary at Ghor Muhaism which they said was beyond their limits and to visit which might involve them in all sorts of calamities They insisted so strongly on this as to raise some doubt in my mind as to whether the realboundary was not Umm Chir, but they protested that as the limit of cultivation extended westwards in the marshes, so also would they push forward their grazing limits along the edge of the marsh. 7. It will be seen from the foregoing that there is a patch of territory some 7 miles broad, bounded to the north by the “ Ghor Muhaisin ” and the “ Ghor ed Douvil-” and on the south by the marsh, which is not occupied (nor as far as I know claimed) by Turkey, and not occupied by Persia, though claimed locally, as Persian territorry. Documentary evidence on the subject of this section of the frontier seems to be entirely lacking*, but we know that the engineers of the Mediating Commissioners in 18^1 were not accompanied here by the Turkish Commissioner. Discussion with the Shaikhs elicited the following arguments in support of the frontier which they claimed for Persia, as distinct from their own tribal limits: — (1) That the Turks have never advanced beyond the line of the Dawairij, and have been careful to build their fort, referred to above, on the west bank, and that their proposals to strengthen the frontier posts do not include the establishment of any posts beyond this line. (2) That the lands of the Dawairij main stream have never been culti vated by Turkish tribes, except for a brief period many years ago when the Bani Lam fled from Turkish territory and camped there. (o) I was informed by one Mulla ’Alwan, clerk of Shaikh Asi of the Bani Turuf, and formerly a writer in the head office of the Turkish district of Dawairij, that he himself had seen the official Turkish Kharita which gave the Dawairij as the boundary between Turkey and Persia. (4) I was informed by the Shaikhs that since the breaking of the dam ^ ' on the Karkheh at Kut Hawashim (in 1837?) the silt of the river which had previously been spread over the lands in the neighbourhood of Hawizeh, had been ra P ld 'y°' f either side of the river and in the marshes which the Bam i urut inhabit, with the result that their rice-fields have extended con- siderab y westwards and continue to do so every year They uWed that in order to retain for Persia the natural accretions of land and to avoid a land frontier with Turkey, t° which they had the strongest practical objections, it was essential t a frontier should run through the middle of the marsh to the old mJn stream of the Dawailj; the portion of the. frontier imme- diatelv north of the marsh was, they said, practically un.nhabit- able and before unlikely to be a cause of friction with the Turkish authorities. ervnf- a rnmoarison of the present state of things Observations on the spot he P Commiss i one rs’ map of 1851, and my with, that shown on r into the question of irrigation frmn'the fCarkheh,'tend°?o confirm the correctness of the above view. . , .1 The Karkeh is ^ly “ wuth silt, more^I an an^o ^r deposited aU its silt in the marshes instead of spreading ,t over the broad plains around Hawizeh. . 8. The position therefore would appear.to be^ that whdsHor^t^ P y P persian le present time, the adoption of the j nconv enience to the Persian Govern- •ibes (Umm Chir) would cause no great ^ , satisfactory settlement ient or to the Shaikh of Mohammerah a perman^ y ^ observed by an only be arrived at by ‘he adoptmn of t b J he advanta g e of being a urkey (Ghor Muhaisin and the Dawa irij), wmcn .1 ■ t TT 17 ^ nrint 100 * 11 #4 natural frontier line, not liable to disturbance ^ ^ for Dractically the whole of its length from the ^ hatt Arab t0 sht 1 ^uh, whether through uninhabitable marshes, or uninhabitable deserts, thus rendering collisions between the tribes on either side of the border unlikely : this, m view of the religious hostility that exists between them is of considerable importance. The adoption of any frontier east of that locally recognized by Persian tribes would appear to be unjustified by anything in the present condition or past history of the frontier, and to be most strongly to be deprecated. Copy with enclosures handed to His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah. Enclosure No, i. Diary. From June 2ist to July 3rd, 1912. On J une 21st I left Mohammerah en route for Ahwaz in company with Lieutenant H. Digby Beste, R.I.M., after waiting six days for the S.S. “ Malamir ”, which had been under repair at Basrah. We arrived at Ahwaz on June 22nd and left for the Turko-Persian frontier on the 24th at 9 P.M., a dust- storm having prevented our crossing the river earlier. The Karkheh was struck at Kut Hawashim ’Atiq at daybreak the next day, and a halt made till the afternoon, when we moved on to Kut Saiyid ’Ali, some six miles downstream, a start being made at this point with planetable triangula tion. Kut Saiyid ’Ali is a community of Saiyids living on the North bank of the Karkheh practically independent of the Bani Turuf, and subject to the rule of the Shaikh of Mohammerah. On the 26th at daybreak we left for Khafajiyeh, the headquarters of Shaikh ’Asi, chief of the Bani Turuf: the track lay parallel with the Karkheh, across low tying ground intersected with canals, some of them four feet deep, watering extensive rice fields and finally emptying into the belt of marshes which lies some miles south of the river. Shaikh ’Asi was very friendly, put me up in a mat hut, and preferred me every assistance : he has been nominated this year as chief of the tribe, and has accepted responsibility to Shaikh Khaz’al for the revenue of the tribe, which amounts to about 40,000 Tomans or nearly ^'8,000. We left at daybreak next day for Bisaitin, some 18 miles distant ; I rode, the rest of the party going by bellam : the ground on both sides of the river was very marshy, and the land route crossed the river at Khafajiyeh and kept some mdes north of it, only touching it again opposite Bisaitin. Shaikh Salih and Shaikh Aufi of the Bam Turuf rode with me, as well as Shaikh ’Asi. Bisaitm is a long straggling settlement of Bani Turuf, covering three miles or so along the southern bank of the Karkheh ; the huts are well built of reeds, and are airy and roomy, whi st the marshes all round keep the temoerature down by ay and nig t, even in the height of summer. Mosquitoes, strange to say, were conspicuous by their absence, and the inhabitants, a fine healthy looking race, “ ' If, 1 he y were . seldom troubled with fever.

On the 29th I left Bisaitin for Hawizeh, horses and mules being sent without loads or saddles over a reed causeway through the marsh for the first six miles, whilst the baggage was sent by bellam : I halted during the heat of the day at the house of Shaikh Mahaji of the Shurufa tribe, subject to Shaikh Khazal, and went on in the afternoon to Hawizeh, where our triangles joined up with those in the direction of Shwaiyib which formed part of the survey made under the supervision of the Political Resident by the same surveyor earlier in the year. I was accom modated in a cool house in the village by Jamal, the local agent of the Shaikh of Mohammerah, who told me that the revenue of the village of Hawizeh was about ^500. We spent the 30th in taking astronomical observations, leaving in the afternoon for Kut Hawashim, instead of Nasiri direct, in order to enable the surveyor to join up his triangles with his starting point on the Karkheh. We halted during the heat of the day at Kut Hawashim, and reached Nasiri before midnight on July 1st. I may conclude by mentioning that I endeavoured to ascertain during my journey how far smuggling was indulged in by the tribes op this border. I came to the conclusion that the difficulties of communication with Amara are so great that very little smuggling indeed is done, except to some small extent in arms and ammunition for the Dizful market. I was assured and was satisfied that the Hawizeh market was supplied almost solely from Nasiri, a little produce coming from Mohammerah in winter, brought back by the large camel caravans which go there direct with rice.

Equal altitudes of the sun’s upper and lower limb 4 sets, were taken and a meridian distance was run thus from Hawizeh to Nasiri, the interval being 2 days. Allowing the old rate of ri67 losing daily, the results place Hawizeh 34' 8’7' west of Nasiri which result tallied so closely with the result of Lieuten ant Wilson’s planetable survey that in my opinion it may be assumed that the chronometer (by which the meridian distance was run) kept good time during these two days, and the difference shewn during these two days between the comparisons was result of the Hack watch going badly and not the chronometer. 1.0., Resultant position Hawizeh :— f Lat.

From Political Resident, Persian Gulf, 10th July 1912. Foreign Secret. 710. Your telegram of 3rd July. Firstly, Sheikh of Mohammerah claims on behalf of Persian Government that following islands are Persian territory, viz.:—( 1 ) Muhalleh and its adjunct Bahriyeh ; (2) the four islands between Shatait and Maawiyeh, referred to in sub-enclosure to my Despatch dated 4th May, No. 3, Political, to the Foreign Office ; (3) two islands off Manqnhi, variously named, joined to mainland at low water. All above are actually in possession of Persian Government, and it is claimed that they have never been in the hands of Turks at any time. Contention of Sheikh of Mohammerah in regard to them is that all, and particularly Muhalleh, are part and parcel of island of A1 Khidhar, and must be regarded as forming part of left bank of the Shat, vide page 122 of Turko-Persian Boundary Papers, part III. Secondly, Sheikh of Mohammerah claims on behalf of Persian Government that all islands which may subsequently form, and all accretions to existing islands as above stated, on Persian side of mid-channel line, i.e., line taken by steamers, shall be ipso facto recognised as Persian territory in accordance with ancient custom and for reasons given in sub-enclosure to my Despatch above mentioned. For map showing above islands, please see that quoted in sub-enclosure to my Despatch above mentioned.—— —I— 7 1 n [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Govemmont ] PERSIA.

IN continuation of my letter No. 2 of the 8 th April, 1912, I have the honour to forward copies of a despatch,* with enclosure, which I have addressed to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, giving further details regarding the “ Shalhah ” Island. A brief abstract of the additional information now acquired was contained in my telegram No. 447, dated the 25th April, 1912. I have, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel, British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Majesty's Consul- General for Ears, Ac. Enclosure in No. 1. Lieutenant Wilson to Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox. Sir, Mohammerah, May 4, 1912. IN accordance with your instructions, I yesterday visited the islands in the Shatt- el-Arab on the eastern side of the mid-channel stream below the village of Shatait, and have the honour to submit the following further details regarding their position, in amplification of my despatch No. 104 of the 1st December, 1910, to His Majesty’s Minister. The map to which I would invite reference is that of the Shatt-el-Arab and Abbadan, on the scale 1 millim. —1 inch. 2. Four islands are shown on this map, on the Persian side of the river, extending from below Shatait to above Ma’awiyeh. 1 will describe them in turn, commencing with the one nearest Shatait 3. The first island is a small, very low-lying patch, in which date-palms have not yet been planted, though it is cultivated and banked. It was first brought under cultivation in 1908 by Zair Hussain, a subject of the sheikh, resident a few hundred yards lower down on the Persian side of the river, but last year the island was handed over by the sheikh to Haji Wahab, of the Bu Chachirah. It has no recognised name. 4 . The second island is that shown (incorrectly) alike on the above map and on the chart as “ Dawasir.” It is a long and fertile island, stated to have been first brought under cultivation some fifteen years ago. It is cultivated by the adherents of Zair Hussain-ibn-Haji Mahmud, who are subjects of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and live on the Persian bank close by. The island yields a substantial revenue to the sheikh. Arabs only apply the name “ Dowasir ” to the district on the Turkish bank. 5. The third island is a mere mudbank, not yet cultivated, and covered at high tides. 6 . The fourth island, shown on the map as Ma’awiyeh, is, according to the state ments of old and respected Arabs resident in the locality, the “ Shalhah ^ which the Turks claimed in 1877 (the Arabic date was correctly quoted to me). The general testimony of the elders of the tribe (Thawamir) which cultivate it was that it was first brought under cultivation about forty years ago, and that thirty-five years ago the incident referred to in my office note of the 15th December, 1910, took place. ^ It is covered with date-palms, and yields a handsome revenue to the sheikh. The cultivators are Thawamir and Ma’awiyeh tribesmen, the former under Sheikh Ghazban-bin-Nasir , the latter first brought the island under cultivation, and it is. sometimes called Nasiriyah in consequence. . 7 . I will conclude with a few general remarks affecting equally all the above islands: — (1.) They are uninhabited, the cultivators living on the mainland on the ieisian side ; this is because the ground is swampy and unhealthy. ■&gt;^4 1 [2473 bb-l]I 19 \ Thev are not connected, even at the lowest tides, with the mainland, but at certain points the water is stated to fall at low tide sufficiently to enable men to wade across^) ^ islal]ds sllow a tendency to extend down-stream, and also to broaden in the ll ^ e ) ct ^ ? f a * e ad ““comparatively recent growth, the eldest having been put under cultivation onlv fortv years ago ; this is confirmed by Colonel Chesney s chart of 1849, CTs enclosed in his “ Narrative of the Euphrates and Tigris Expedition, m which the islands do not figure. I n£LV6 (xC* A. T. WILSON, on Special Duty.MINUTE. In order to make sure that no point has escaped notice, the numerous telegr(xm,s on these snbjects are briefly reviewed. In telegram of 4th April the Government of India supported the views of Sir P. Cox regarding the claims of Persia to participate in the Riverain Comnissioh on the Shat-el-Arah. His Majesty's Government have decided that the whole river must be admitted to be Turkish, and all considerations that do not recognise this must therefore be set on one side, including the practical one mentioned here by Col. Cox viz: that if dues are levied probably a considerable, if not the major part of the shipping affected, will be that plying to the Persian ports of Mohcmnera and Abadan, and. Persia will hardly fail to claim participation and cannot be ignored- This point seems to be also covered by the provision in the draft Convention that dues are only to he levied for services rendered. If Persia renders no ser vices she will be entitled, to no dues. On the other hand, for wharfage etc. at these Persian ports she would be entitled, apparently to some share of the consolidated due which it is proposed that the Comnission should levy. This was admitted as regards Mohamm.era in our telegram of 10th April, but does not appear in the Convention, and should he further considered. Col. Cox also urges that recognition of Turkish claims to the whole river would, be eguivalent to aggression on the Sheikh of Moharmera's rights. andand would be regarded by him as a breach of our assurances. His Majesty's Government have declined to recognise this (tel. of 10th April), but Sir P. Cox remained unconvinced (tel. of 5th May). He also suggested some modified- proposal under which Persia would be allowed representation direct, or through the Sheikh. The Secretary of State in reply (tel. of 10th April) pointed- out the incon venience of admitting Persia, and asked whether the Sheikh could not be persuaded to delegate any claims he m.ay have to the British representative on the Commission. Sir P. Cox objected to this (tel. of 6th May) on the ground that it would be disloyal on the part of the Sheikh, who is an official representative of the Persian Government, and that he would, only agree in return for a consid erable extension of our assurances of protection. But in his shorter telegram, of 23rd May he himself suggested that our representative on the Commission should, be explicitly permitted, to represent the Sheikh's interest. In our letter to Foreign Office of 4th June it was accordingly proposed, that a clause should be insetted 'to the effect that nothing 'in the Convention shall derogate from the rights 'enjoyed by Persia and Moharmera under Art. 2 of 'the Treaty (of Erzerown), and that it shall be the 'duty of the British member to make such represent- 'ations to the Commission as may at any time be 'necessary upon any question affecting those rights” It is for consideration whether any communication should be made to the Persian Government on this point.In the telegrar of 4th April Sir P . Cox also urges th&amp;t to deprive the Sheikh (on whose responsibility for one safety of our commerce we have always insisted) of all supervision over the river will have a very bad effect in view of the fact that by far the greater proportion of the Arabs on both sides of the river owe allegiance to him; and in his shorter telegram, of the 23rd May he aggin pressed for recognition of the middle line for the purpose of responsibility for police arrangements* The middle line is, however, abandoned, for all purposes. But we may have to consider whether we should not give the Sheikh some honour, or other form of compensation for any loss of prestige that he may suffer* In his telegram of 5th May Sir P. Cox deals with the interpretation of the treaty of Erz&amp;roim , without, however, producing any argument that shakes the interpretation put upon it by His Majesty's Government* In para* 2 he refers to fishing rights carried* by lands on the Persian bank (see also Mote VI to his letter of 21st May)* Clause ? of the draft Convention purports to save these rights; but what will be the statujL of land between high and low water mark at low tide? Appar ently, it will be Persian at low tide and Turkish at high tide* This also raises the question of the islands, referred to in note Y to Sir JD * Cox s letter of 21st May* Apparently the ownership of them is Turkish. But would it be possible to provide thatir 1 the event of any of them becoming attached to the mainland (? even at low water), or of new islands being formed which are united to the Persian bank (? at low water), they shall he recognised as Persian?. To return to the telegram of 5th May- The Oil Company's property is intended to be covered by clause 16 of the draft Convention; but no mention has been made of the anchorage off Moharmera which Sir P. Cox says is now in the main stream- I am not aware if there is any objection to this being in the hands of the Commission. Sir P. Cox's longer telegram of 23rd May has already been commented on by Mr. Parker. It is a summary of his letter of 21st May, which nowever does not seem to add anything material to It may he mentioned with reference to head that it is clear from the correspondence of 1847 that the tribes referred, to in the Treaty are not nomads, but the settled tribes - see enclosures in Mr. Wellesley's despatch No. 81 of 3 March 1847 (Correspondence purt 3, pp. 39, 40). Sir P. Cox's shorter telegram of 23rd May has been answered by the Secretary of State's of 1st June. But it may be note' 1 that part 3 of the Correspondence relative to the negotiations 184.)- 1852 makes the position with regard to fortifications quite clear. The Porte desired a formal and posi tive engagement that its right to the exclusive possession of the channel of the Shat should never be challenged, and, in order that Persia might never have an excuse for claiming possession (as distinct fromfrom the right of free navigation), that no kind °J fortifications should ever he erected either on the island (Khizl) or in any place where they would ie detrimental to the navigation of the river by Turkish merchant vessels (Turkish ILF.A. to the two Powers 5th December 1846, p.30); and they proposed to add to article. 2 of the Treaty a paragraph to the effect that, provided that the Persian Govern ment formally undertake that no fortifications shall ever he erected ”sur ceux des endroits situes sur m la rive gauche du Chatt-el-Arab, qui, comma il est 'dit plus haut, doivent raster en la possession de n la Perse', Turkey undertakes not to erect fortifi cations 'sur les cdtes de ces terras situees sur 'la ri ve dnite du fleuve susdit qui sont vis-a-vis 'des en&amp;roits susmentionnes, 9 (Turkish M.F.A. 9th March 1847, p. 12). The two Ambassadors approved this reciprocal engagement (14th April 1847, p.ol). The Persian representative then asked for 'a declar ation in writing that the fortifications of Moham- ”mera were not included among those whose prohibi- 'tion was demanded by the Porte', and the two Ambassadors considered that they mignt give it •inasmuch as all that the Porte requires is that 'no new fortifications shall be constructed on the •Shatt-el-Arab, while the fortifications of Moham- 'mera exist already, and it may be even matter of 'doubt whether Mohammera can he considered as •actually situated on the Shatt.' (Lord Cowley, 2 Feb. 1848 p. 61). The declaration was accordingly given (19th January 1848 p. 65), and the Persian representative gave the engagement 'qu'aassi longtempslongtemps qiie la Tnrquie ne batira point de fortifi cations sur la rive droite du Chatt-el-Arab, situee vis-a-vis da territoire persan, la Perse a son tour s'ahstiendra d'en construire sur la partie de la rive gauche gai lui revzent selon les stipulations du traite* ' (19th Jan* 1848, ih.). The Porte gave its own engagement in the following terms:- 'Comme par le present acte la Conr de Perse s 1 engage 'formtllement a ne construire la Sublime n Porte, de son cote, s'engage a ne pas eleven de Convelles fortifications ' (p* 68), ami the two Ambassadors described the transaction as a 'defense reciproque de batir des fortifications sur 'les cotes du Chatt-el-Arab, ou les possessions / r 'des deux Etats se trouvent opposees les unes aut\res (26th Feb* 1848. p. 69). In his telegram of 29th May Sir P. Cox critic- Iifsb ised thB/draft of the proposed Convention, and in that of 4th June the final draft. Both of these have been fully dealt with by this Office in constit ution with Admiral Sir E. Slade. On a perusal of the telegrams this consideration suggests itself - that though Turkey is entitled to ownership of the whole river de June, the recognition of her claims de facto is a very considerable con cession in view (1) of the strength of the case against them (2) of the degree of joint ownership which she has allowed to grow up. For so consider able a concession we ought therefore to insist on getting what we vjant, i.e. the frontier as locally recognised, between Mohammera and Hawieeh. (Z/tAFrom Viceroy, 7th June 1912.

[Note by Mr. Parker. —My comments are inserted in italics. Some of the points have already been dealt with on the telegraphic correspondence.—A. P.] gj r) ' Muscat, May 21, 1912. IN submitting the accompanying notes relating to points of detail in Mr. Alwyn Parker’s memorandum of April 1912 on the subject of “ the frontier between Moham- merah and Turkey,” I have the honour to offer the following observations for the consideration of the Government of India, on the bearing of the memorandum as a whole and the line of policy advocated therein. 2 . The findings arrived at in the memorandum may be summarised as follows :— (a.) As regards the riparian tract west of Mohammerah, it is agreed that there is a case for supporting a Persian claim for the formal recognition and confirmation of the status quo as represented by the boundary locally observed. (b.) As regards the district of Hawizeh, it is suggested that there are no grounds for any modification of the arbitrary line inserted in the mediating commissioners’ rough diagram as indicating the boundary recommended for adoption in respect of that locality. My suggestion in my memorandum under discussion was overruled (see tele gram No. 335 of the llih April, 1912, to St. Petersburg). I may add that I am convinced by Sir P. Cox’s facts and arguments on this point that my suggestion was inexpedient. — A. P. (c.) As regards the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab, it is held that a claim on the part of Persia to the mid-channel boundary is untenable. (d.) Apart from the above main issues under immediate consideration, Mr. Parker expresses the apprehension that the question of the status of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in the matter of jurisdiction over those of his tribesmen who tenant lands in admittedly Turkish limits must come up incidentally for discussion in the course of the frontier negotiations now in progress at Constantinople. He merely touches on this problem for the purpose of indicating the probability of the contingency arising. My words were that it (( is not unlikely to be discussed A I am preparing a separate paper on this question. — A. P. (e.) Lastly, he suggests, at the conclusion ot his memorandum, that the Sheikh of Mohammerah seems to be pursifi^eavgoj^^vof territorial encroachment by means c ' ' ' v ^ ” 1 b [2506 m—1] : l-\ Qpov &lt; o i 23 AUG 1 S 12 i ; ; ' 23 AUG 1912 n: 34of the purchase of real property in Turkish limits, and expresses the view that it is undesirable that we should give him any encouragement in this course. As I have already 'pointed out, my misapprehension, if It is one, rests on certain passages, especially on pp. 58 and 59, of Lieutenant Wilson s precis on Arobistan. — A. P. 3. Speaking briefly, the notes now submitted may be said to bear on the several points above cited to the following extent:— As regards (a), it is shown— ( 1 .) That there has been no encroachment by Persia at this part of the frontier for the last sixty years at least, and that the boundary which has throughout this period been locally observed by both parties is apparently identical with that claimed by Persia in 1850,'* which, it will be remembered, was only modified in the recommendations of the mediating commissioners in order to secure to Turkey safe navigation up to Bussorah ; and ( 2 .) That the experience of the same sixty years has demonstrated that the danger then apprehended to Bussorah from the occupancy of these lands by Persia is really non-existent, and is in any case provided against by the undertaking entered into by the latter to erect no fortifications. This, the non-existence of the danger, as demonstrated by experience, is precisely what I have pointed out on p. 38 of my memorandum. — A. P. As regards (b), it is submitted that the rough diagram enclosed in Colonel Williams’ despatch of the 4th February, 1850,t has already been shown to be altogether sketchy and inaccurate and not drawn according to scale; that the boundary-line inserted in it was apparently drawn arbitrarily and without any visit having been made to the locality, and without knowledge of the local geographical or political conditions existing; that the Hawizeh district has, in fact, been a recognised district of Persia for three centuries; that its boundaries are well recognised, and that the adoption of the arbitrary line shown in the diagram is not feasible in practice. As regards (c), further arguments, based on both legal and practical considerations, have been adduced in support of the attitude adopted by the India Office in their letter to the Foreign Office dated the 3 rd June, 191 l.J See my minute on p. 4, under 8. — A. P. , Items (d) and (e) : Discussion of these points hardly comes within the scope of the present letter ; I may therefore confine myself to a reference to the text of my notes themselves, merely reiterating in regard to (e) that Mr. Parker’s observations seem to be based on a misunderstanding of the sheikh’s proceedings. v&gt;'.. My misunderstanding arose from Lieutenant Wilsons precis (vide supra).— A. P. 4. As to the line of policy which His Majesty’s Government can best adopt under the circumstances, Mr. Parker’s recommendations are ( 1 .) As regards (a), that we should confer with the Bussian Government and get them to agree to our jointly advising the Persian Government to induce the Turks to reveal the extent of their claims in respect of the neighbourhood of Mohammerah, and then to press their claim for the recognition of the boundary (at Di’aiji) as locally recognised and observed, and that we ourselves should simultaneously intimate to the Porte in a friendly way the great importance which we attach to the maintenance of the status quo, and ask them to take our wishes into favourable consideration. ( 2 . i That as regards ( 6 ), we should seek no departure from the arbitrary line drawn by the mediating commissioners. (3.) That as regards (c), we should support the claim of the Turks to the whole channel. _r . v 5. It remains for me, as directed, to express my personal views with reference to those conclusions and recommendations. While 1 fully appreciate the soundness and advantage of the course adopted by Mr. Parker, in drawing up his memorandum and framing his recommendations from the purely legal standpoint, from which the subject would probably be treated in the main . _ * Vide p. 37 of memorandum. T opposite p. 2o of memorandum. ^ P. 31 of Foreign Office memorandum.if it went before The Hague Court, yet I think that it is generally agreed that it is very greatly to our interests to avert an appeal to that court by diplomatic action ; and it is hoped that these notes, read in conjunction with Mr. Parker’s memorandum, will suffice to demonstrate that the Persian contentions in regard to the boundary from Dawairij southwards are well-founded, and will enable His Majesty’s Government to undertake that action with confidence. A copy of the Foreign Office memorandum of the 23rd February, 1912, in which a reference to The Hague Tribunal was first deprecated, has been sent to Sir P. Cox. It is in consequence of the inexpediency of such a reference that an alternative course was suggested in the Foreign Office letter of the 31st May, 1912 (No. 22191) to the India Office. — A. P. 6 . As regards point (a), I agree that we should in the first instance confer with the Bussian Government with a view to obtaining their co-operation ; this, judging by their attitude at the time of the Treaty of Erzeroum,' :;: ‘ we may presumably expect them readily to afford. 1 would urge, however, that in our communication to the Porte we should go con siderably further than Mr. Parker suggests. The expediency of making some intimation to the Porte of the nature of our engagements with the Sheikh of Mohammerah has aln ady been deliberately considered by His Majesty’s Government in connection with the Zain incident of 1910, and approved of in principle. The local authorities at Bussorah have even been informed in the most explicit manner by His Majesty’s consul at Bussorah that the Sheikh of Mohammerah is under British protection.! This announcement was widely promulgated in Turkish and Arabic papers at the time, and must be common knowledge to the Porte. Surely, in view of these considerations, we are now in a position to speak freely to the latter, explaining that we have been in the best possible position for being aware of and taking note of the nature of the status quo, as locally observed for the past sixty years or more ; that taking for granted, as we were warranted in doing, the permanence of that status quo, we have entered into engage ments with the Sheikh of Mohammerah which involve its maintenance, and that both our interests and our good name preclude us from going back on these pledges or permitting any alteration of the sheikh’s position on the Shatt-el-Arab and in Arabistan. As regards (b). It is submitted that it has already been pointed out in the past correspondence that the rough and small-scale diagram! enclosed in Colonel Williams’ despatch of the 4th February, 1850, was not a document on which any reliance could be placed ; that the boundary line shown in it must have been arbitrarily drawn ; that as far as Hawizeh is concerned, it is clearly only very approximate and indeterminate, and must have been so inserted in the absence of any local knowledge or visit to the locality ; that the Hawizeh district has been a recognised district of Persia for three centuries, that there is no record of its having been claimed by Turkey, and that the adoption of the arbitrary line shown in Colonel Williams’ diagram is not feasible in practice. Vide supra under 2 (b).— A. P. 7. Should it be necessary for Persia to make some concession to Turkey as a set-off against the abandonment of the latter’s claim in the Arabistan region, I would recall to mind that the Turks seem in 1891§ to have contemplated such abandonment in return for the cession of certain territory between Zohab and Khanikin, and it might be possible to come to some such arrangement now. The very important British od con cession at Kasr-i-Shirin would probably be affected by such a cession of territory, but if the Turks would consent to guarantee the continuance of this, the change of nation ality might not improbably operate to the benefit of the company. Zohab is largely within the Russia?! sphei'e : moreover, Persia seems now to attach almost greater importance to Zohab than to Mohammerah. — A. P. Locally, the only concession which it would appear that we can advisedly recom mend to the Persian Government to agree to, in order by friendly compromise to eliminate the boundary betweeh Dawairij and the Shatt-el-Arab from the issues referable to The Hague, is that the line should be drawn from the channel west of the village of Shu’aib direct to Kishk-i-Bussorah, and thence to the locally recognised * * P. 19 of memorandum. t P- 61 of Wilson’s precis. ]: Opposite p. 25 of memorandum. § See Annex (II) to this letter.4 boundary on the Shatt at Di’aiji. A considerable strip of territory would thus be relinquished to Turkey, especially if we consider Persia’s original claim—the course of the marsh channel from west of Hawizeh until it reaches the Shatt-et-Arab. Persia can afford to do this, for, although the area involved is an extensive one, with irrigable potentialities which it is hard to estimate, it is nevertheless probable that the nomad occupation and cultivation by Shi’eh Arab tribes under Persia would remain unaffected, and that lurkish subjects and Turkish influence would continue to be as non-existent and unknown east of the natural boundary as they are under existing conditions. 8 . As regards (c), I can only say that nothing in Mr. Parker’s memorandum enables me to alter the view expressed in my telegram dated Mohammerah, the 5th May. /, ^ 0UicL re jer to the following passage, based on the legal opinion of on h. Davidson, Mr. Hurst, and Mr. Malkin, and quoted from the Foreian Office letter of the Zlst May, 1912 (No. 22934) to the India Office ' ' “ SiT' E. Grey is advised that under normal conditions there is no doubt a pi esumption that each riparian owner owns on Ins side of the river usque ad medium um aquae, but that, in the present case, that presumption has by implication undoubtedly been swept away by the terms of the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847) the effect of which was to give Turkey the whole waterway I would also refer to the view of Admiral Slade, Sir A. Hirtzel, and Mr Hurst (see joint Utter of the 15th May, 1912, to Sir E. Grey (No. 20863) ).—A. P. 9 :j? “ nclu '? ion &gt; I a wo t u , ld urge that ha ™g regard to the fact that our commercial stake and interests in Southern Persia, present and potential, now mainly centre in Arabistan, and are bound up with the maintenance of the Sheikh of Mohammerah’s position and the strengthening of our special relations with him, we have everythinjr to ose by a course of action (the failure to safeguard the status quo which has been icgarded and treated by the present generation as the established order of things) which will tend greatly to discredit the value of our engagements and support fnd create in the minds of the Arab public in the Gulf and the native rulers in treaty ’with us a feeling of apprehension and uncertainty which we can by no means, especially at this juncture, afford to disregard. ^ ^ Our attitude will, in fact, be regarded as a crucial test of our sincerity and ability to make good our engagements, and I would add the personal opinion that the increased confidence and frank reliance m us, which the Sheikh of Koweit has shown within the last two years, has been due less to anything that we have done for him than to the ?f onr t ^Tr^Ti !- 11 the J case of Mohammerah of the substantial and moral value of our steadfast friendship and support: I should view with very great concern anv action calculated to weaken those sentiments. ^ Ihere is a consensus of opinion as to the importance of obtainina the most favourable settlement possible for the sheikh, due regard being had at the same time to our general relations with Turkey, to legal and treaty and to the expediency of not arousing misgivings as to the justice of our attitude in Turkey wiere the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and our proteges, have largely invested m real estate, and might suffer, from resentment entertained against His Government. Whether our attitude can be such as to insist-m the face ofZMle Turkish opposition-upon the continued exercise of jurisdiction by the Heikhoi Mohammerah over his tribesmen resident in admittedly Turkish territory (Z ol the right bank of the Shatt-el-AraV) is I think a to the Za,n incident of 1910 ivas, as I understand inspired by the outrank committed against the sheikh's relatives rather than by a determination to feZt acts of lawful sovereignty and administration by the Turkish authorities on Turkish sod Sir G.

Page 4 : Fort at Failiyeh destroyed by order of the Commissioners in order to secure Freedom of Navigation for Turkey. It may be observed that the boundary as locally recognised leaves the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab a few hundred yards above the sheikh’s palace at Failiyeh (which is in no sense a fort) and passes behind wooded islands, which completely shut off Persian territory from the view of the navigable channel. Thus its adoption would not give Persia control of the left bank beyond Failiyeh. As regards Failiyeh itself, and, indeed, as regards the whole of his frontier, the sheikh has rigorously observed the undertaking to build no fortifications which was given by the Persian envoy in 1848 (see foot of p. 48). Note 2. Page 10 : The Haffar Canal. (See also reference to it by Layard at pp. 52 and 53.) The exposition here given of the geographical position of Mohammerah and the rough sketch map given in illustration are both based upon the assumption that the section of the waterway on which Mohammerah stands is an artificial cut, and that the latter is the “ Haffar ” properly so called. I submit that this assumption is erroneous. The testimony of ancient maps and documents which, owing to my absence from books and records, I am unable to quote in extenso, is that the position was originally as shown in the accompanying very rough sketch. That is to say, that the Karun flowed via Marid and the old settlement of Kubban to the Khor Musa, whilst the Shatt-el-Arab bifurcated at the present site of Mohammerah and divided its waters from thence to the sea between its present channel and the Bahmanshir branch. The term “Haffar” is applied locally invariably to the reach of the Karun above Mohammerah between Marid and the head of the Bahmanshir, and in no case to the waterway on which Mohammerah stands, which, on the contrary, is often called Bahmanshir (see “ Gazetteer,” p. 598, and Lieutenant Wilson’s 1 m. = 1 inch maps of Mohammerah and the Shatt-el-Arab for further explanations as to the position of the Haffar reach). 2506 m —1] C6 There is a well-known tradition current locally that the bed of the Karun from Marid, where the old Karun diverges, to the head of the Bahmanshir, was once an artificial cut for small boats, and so narrow, to quote the words of the tradition, “ that one woman could hand to another a basket of dates across the water.” Gradually, however, the Karun tended to adopt the canal for its surplus waters, as the Kubban Channel became silted up ; dams were built to counteract this tendency, but in vain, and finally the river abandoned the Marid-Kubban bed and flowed south wards to the Bahmanshir. There is strong inductive evidence of the correctness of the above tradition deducible from the levels of the old and new stream beds and other considerations, which have received the endorsement of Sir W. Willcocks, who has made a close study of the question. It may further be asked, when the Karun entered the sea via Kubban, what was the position and raison d'etre of the Bahmanshir, if it was not at that time a mouth of the combined waters of the Euphrates and Tigris ? Other pertinent arguments may be adduced, such as the great size and depth ot the Haffar, and the nature of the delta of the Bahmanshir, but the subject is not one which affects the frontier directly, and is only touched on here to show that the arguments of the responsible officers of that period were not always founded on a basis of unassailable fact. Note 3. Page 12 : The Independence of the Kaab and their original Nationality. Whether the Ka’ab (or Chaab) emigrated from Najd (as stated by Mr. Lorimer in his “ Gazetteer ” at p. 961) or from the Arabian coast (as stated by Lieutenant Wilson on the authority of an old native historical record, vide p. 8 of his precis), their stay at Wasit, on the Shatt-el-Hai in Turkish territory, was only a short one, and Najd and the Arabian coast being alike independent at the time, their brief sojourn in Turkish territory does not make them a Turkish tribe. Turkish dominion over Mesopotamia was then very shadowy except at Bussorah and Bagdad, and the statement of Mr. Townley in his memorandum of 1891, on the authority of information obtained in Tehran from the Turkish Embassy, that the Ka’ab were recognised as independent by the treaty of 1639, coming as it does from a Turkish source, is prima facie probable. There is, I think, no doubt that the Chaab were not recognised as independent by the Treaty of 1639 : all the versions we possess, including the Turkish versions and that obtained from Vienna and regarded as the most reliable, omit all reference to the Chaab, and the ipse dixit of the Turkish Embassy at Tehran, without any documentary proof, is, I submit, not of any decisive weight in view of the consistent evidence to the contrary afforded by all the versions of the treaty extant. Moreover, it is hardly conceivable that, if the Chaab were recognised as independent by the Treaty of 1639, the fact should not have transpired between 1842 and 1850.—A. P. Major Bawlinsons conclusions at the top of p. 14 may, so far as they relate to the independence of the Ka’ab, be accepted as correct, with the exception of the assertion that they were Turkish subjects in 1639. It is impossible to reconcile this general statement with the record (printed at p. 8 of Wilson’s precis), to the effect that about 1620 on the accession of Shah ’Abbas, Imam Kuli Khan, Governor of Farsistan, headed an expedition against the Ka’ab, and compelled them to pay revenue to the Shah of Persia. This statement indicates that some years before the treaty of 1639 the Ka’ab were admittedly Persian subjects, and one of the principal Turkish assertions thus falls to the ground. In any case it may be asked, What are the rights “ of which Turkey never made any formal renunciation ? ” The payment by the tribe of rents to Bussorah may, with due reserve, be admitted as evidence of the nationality of the lands concerned, but not ol the subjectivity of the tribes paying it, as it has been constantly admitted that Persian tribes might occupy lands belonging to Turkey without surrendering their nationality, though without, of course, giving Persia a valid claim on that ground alone to the ownership of the lands occupied. (See second query, p. 24.) 4 am not aware where this is “ constantly admitted,' at any rate to the extent of allowing the exei cise of jurisdiction by a foreign Sheikh on Turkish territory. 1 would also refer to my minute under Note 7 on p. 10.— A. P.As a matter of fact, painstaking local research has failed to find any trace or even tradition of payments to Turkey for any lands to the e ist of the frontier as now locally recognised. But equally painstaking local research by Major Rawlinson in 1844 showed opposite results as regards the payments to Turkey up to that time. — A. P. Note 4. Pages 14 and 15 : Nationality and Ownership of the Lands lying between the locally recognised Boundary and Mohammerah. We have it on the authority of Rawlinson that towards the beginning of the 19th century the Ka’ah gradually withdrew from the part of the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab opposite and above Bussorah, and remained in possession of nothing higher up than the Tamar lands (see foot of p. 14). At p. 16 he states with regard to the Haffar lands that Turkey had no valid geographical claim to them, and that for many years they had been practically lost to her. 1 submit that her claim to the Haffar lands is based upon the same arguments and is every whit as valid as her claim to the Tamar lands, which Rawlinson mentions in the same breath in the middle of p. 14, and that if Rawlinson considered Turkey’s claim to the Haffar lands invalid, it follows that her claim to the Tamar lands is likewise invalid. The claim of Persia to remain in possession of the lands may therefore be based on the following grounds :— 1 . That in 1844 (before the treaty of 1848), Major Rawlinson found these lands to be in possession of the Ka’ab (p 14), and considered that Turkey could not advance any valid geographical claim to them, and that for many years they had been practically lost to her. 2 . That for so long as Mohammerah has been in possession of the Ka’ab or of Persia, so long have these lands been in possession of the Ka’ab, and that the ruling of Sir Stratford Canning at p. 14, “that the principle of uti possidetis might be considered to apply to that district without injustice,” applies equally to Mohammerah and to the Tamar and other lands in question. Sir Stratford Canning’s statement that the Persians were not in possession of the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab higher than Mohammerah is directly contradicted by the contemporary evidence of Major Rawlinson at the foot of p. 14 of his memorandum of the 6 th January, 1844. 3 . That the claim made on behalf of Persia in 1850 of ancient occupation has been vastly strengthened by over sixty years of continued undisputed possession by Persia, and recognition of Persian sovereignty by local representatives of the Turkish Govern ment in many ways and on many different occasions. 4 . That the boundary as now observed has for many years been commonly and officially recognised as such by all concerned, both Arabs, Persiaus, and Turks. Cairns and other marks have been put up in the vicinity of the boundary line by common consent, (See (a) “Gazetteer,” p. 1257 ; (b) paragraph 4, p. 51, Wilson’s precis; (c) paragraph 4 , p. 52, idem; (d) paragraph 5, Lieutenant Wilson’s letter of the 5th May, 1912, forwarded to Foreign Office and India under Resident’s letter of the 6 th May.) At Di’aiji, just beyond the boundary, there exists a regular Turkish customs post (see “ Gazetteer,” p. 110 ), the position of which implies the most explicit recognition by the Porte of the locally recognised boundary. In view of fifty years’ continuous recognition of the present boundary by their local officials, it is surely impossible for the Turkish Government to claim some other line and refuse to be bound by the acts and omissions of its own agents. Qui facit per alium facit per se. 5 . That the explanatory note in no way bears on these particular lands ; Mr. Wellesley (at p. 24) does not say that the lands referred to in the second explanatory note are immediately above Mohammerah, and it may be reasonably presumed that the Porte was contemplating, with not unnatural anxiety, the lands above Di’aiji and almost opposite Bussorah, which were then, as now, mostly in the hands of the Ka’ab (see Lorimer’s “Gazetteer,” pp. 108 to 111 , which shows the Muhaisin to be in practically in continuous occupation, as freeholders or leaseholders of Turkish territory, of the whole left bank of the river above Di’aiji to within 6 miles of Bussorah).r’SiMBir*-. 8 6 . That Colonel Shie], an impartial observer, considered (p. 28) the Persian claim to Tamar in the main well founded, but pressed on the Persian Government the acceptance of the decision of the mediating commissioners on other grounds—those of expediency rather than of strict justice—the principle being that if the commission had fixed the boundary higher up the river they would have placed the port of Bussorah fC at the mercy of the Ka’ab. After reading every despatch which was written at this period on the frontier question, I have reached the conclusion that Colonel Shell, Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, held a view if anything rather favourable to Persia, while Sir S. Canning held a view more favourable to Turkey. On the whole, it would seem that Major Rawlins on, who made a minute study of local conditions and had access to the registry at Bussorah, is likely to have formed the more accurate and precise conclusions. Those conclusions, which deal specifically with each small district, are set forth in detail on pp. 16 and 23 of his memorandum of 1844, and reproduced in my memorandum of the 3rd April, 1912. I submit that they show, with some degree of authority, that the Persian claim to sovereignty over the whole country between the locally observed boundary at Diaji and the mediating commis sioners' line was not, in 1844, of uniform validity. However, I ventured in my memorandum to express the view that H/s Majesty's Government can neve 7 theless now support Persia in claiming the whole country up to Diaji, and this view has been approved {see telegram No. 335 of the 11 th April, 1912, to St. Petersburgh), and I quite agree that we should, in the impending negotiations, take full advantage of Colonel Sheiks opinion.—A. P. Now such a consummation is avoided altogether by the locally observed boundary, which leaves the main channel just above Failiyeh, and runs about 1 mile distant from, but parallel to, it near Di’aiji, thus giving ample protection to Bussorah against the construction of forts or other action which might operate to the detriment of that port. As a matter of fact, the commissioners were very wide of the mark when they sought to protect Bussorah against the Ka’ab by the simple expedient of an artificial boundary line. If the Ka’ab wished to attack the commerce of Bussorah, they could do it at any time by walking across the boundary. The Arab tribes of Atub, Idan, and Muntafik, who live mainly on the Turkish side, are far more dangerous than the Ka’ab to the l urks, and were they to be called upon to do so would willingly unite with the latter in attacking the Turks, who, as in 1766, so now, “are in no'capacity to stop them.” r J Note 5. Page 26 : Ownership of Islands in the Shatt-el-Arab. Colonel Williams, in his despatch of the 4th February, 1850 (p. 26), states that “ we have carefully abstained from admitting Persian claims to the islands in the Shatt-el-Arab, all of which lie to the west of Mohammerah and El Khizr I ” . This indicates that in his time there were no islands in the main stream below Mohammerah and that all have formed since that period, though this is not entirely borne out by Colonel Chesneys charts of 1836, which show Muhilleh Island as existing on the iurkish (instead of, as now, on the Persian) side of the main stream. J do not think Colonel 11 illiams’ language is intended to indicate this Them was much correspondence m 1850-51 about Muhilleh island, and island is shown moreover on Colonel Williams diagram. — A. P. Islands in the Shatt-el-Arab are formed in two ways 1 . The river cuts into the mainland and isolates a patch of land, which becomes an island generally separated by only a short distance from the parent mainland. A 2 f 6 Tk* accentu ^ te lts bends by erosion, and below such a bend deposits a mud bank, which is walled, and gradually becomes an island. Islands so formed tend to grow gradually from their lower or down-stream end yards^ dSSUme a C 1 g ar ~ llke shape, masking the parent main bank by several hundred . tlierefore &gt; ownership of all islands be accorded to the Turks, they will be placed m virtual possession of both banks for many miles. J P Ibis possibility, which the local understanding regarding the mid-channel line avoids, nentails another contingency; the tendency is for such islands to be reunited to the parent bank eventually by the silting up of the intervening channel. When this happens, the Turks might be established on the Persian bank. It will be seen from the correspondence on the subject of the “ Shalhah,” which took place in 1887, that this possibility was not lost sight of at that time, and that the island is now much nearer to the main shore than it then was. Wbth the mid-channel line is also bound up the question of fishing rights. These are very valuable, as the inhabitants of both banks draw their principal food supply from the river ; they erect fish-traps on the mud banks and shore on either side, and spread seine nets in the stream, the inhabitants of each bank keeping to their own side or half of the river. Fishing is free, and no taxation is levied on the industry by either Government. At present no friction whatever occurs in the matter of fisheries; but if the Turks get both banks they will probably raise the question, according to their custom, in some crude and arbitrary form, and arouse the bitterest hostility among the tribes, who from time immemorial have enjoyed the use of the river. It is important, I agree, to provide against this. — A. V. Note 6. Page 42 : Legal Objections to the Mid-Channel Line. While admitting the force of the arguments adduced in Mr. Parker’s memorandum on which The Hague Court might rely in deciding in favour of the Turkish case, I would submit that the arguments which can be derived from the international law on the subject must also carry weight. Thus, Wheaton (p. 291 et seq.) lays down that: “Where a navigable river forms the boundary of conterminous States, the middle of the channel or ‘ thalweg ; is generally taken as the line of separation between the two States, the presumption being that the right of navigation is common to both; but this presumption may be destroyed by actual proof of prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession, giving the riparian proprietors the exclusive title to the river.” I apprehend that a study of the records of Turkish Arabia and of the Ka’ab for the past 200 years, as outlined in Lieutenant Wilson’s precis, will summarily dispose of any claim on the part of the Turks to “ prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession.” I would further invite reference to the “Treaty of Vienna, 1815” (Hertslet’s Commercial Treaties, vol. i, p. 3 et seq.), to which, it would appear from a foot-note, Turkey has acceded, and which does not seem to contemplate the possibility of exclusive ownership of interstatal rivers. See my minute on p. 4 wider 8 .— A. P. The fact, moreover, that the Porte has explicitly stated to Persia that should Turkey construct forts on the river in her territories, Persia might do likewise,' :;: ' seems inconsistent with any assertion by Turkey of exclusive rights of sovereignty over the river, since it places Persia admittedly in a position to erect forts at Mohammerah and elsewhere, a position which wmild enable her to close the river at will and prevent all access from Bussorah to the sea; this contingency was actually anticipated in the formal discussions which took place between His Majesty’s Government and the Porte in 1888 regarding the fortifications at Fao.f The right to build such forts upon a river bank is surely one of the first attributes of effective sovereignty. Our Legal Advisers do not agree with the conclusion arrived at by Sir P. Cox as to the effect of fortifications on the ownership of the river (see Foreign Office letter of the 31st May, 1912, to India Office. — A. P. It is, as a matter of fact, stated in a foot-note to p. 27 of the Foreign Office memorandum, that Mahommerah town was excluded from this engagement; there is nothing in the papers quoted above to indicate that such was the case, but that it was so in practice may be inferred from the fact that in 1856 Persia had two large * * Vide enclosure to Constantinople Embassy despatch No. 314, dated Augmst 12, 1888, enclosed in Political Secretary’s letter dated October 12, 1888. f Vide note to Turkish Ambassador dated August 4, 1888, and note to Porte dated August 9, 1888, referred to in the embassy despatcli quoted above, enclosed in Political Secretary’s letter dated July 27, 1888. [2506 m — 1 ] D10 forts at the mouth of the Karun, where it joins the Shatt-el-Arab ; these forts were made use of, unsuccessfully, to prevent British men-of-war from bombarding and landing troops at Mohammerah in the year 1857. My authority for my statement that Mohammerah town was excluded is the f official correspoyidence which excluded it (see pp. 01 and 65 of Pai't III of printed correspondence respecting the frontier). J should not have made such a categorical statement (( as a matter of fact” without proper authority. — A. P. I venture in conclusion to doubt the accuracy of the statement made at the foot of p. 42 of the Foreign Office memorandum, to the effect that “ Persians could not navigate any part of the Shatt-el-Arab without being liable to the duties levied on shipping and merchandise by the Ottoman authorities.” My authority for this statement is Sir S. Canning s despatch No. 239 of the 1st November, 1844 (see pp. 115 and 116 of Part III of printed correspondence). It will be noticed, that his Excellency states that u from the collection of these duties an annual revenue of some amount accrues to the Pashalik of Bagdad.” A further search will be made in the Bagdad records. — A. P. I am not aware of any evidence that such was the case in practice, while old records seem to indicate that from 1760 to 1780 at all events, the Ka’ab rather than the Turks were paramount on the river. Again, the latter are mentioned, in 1766, as building forts on either bank of the river, and the Turks are referred to as being “ in no capacity to stop them.”* A little later, in 1769, the Ka’ab are found to be in alliance with the Turks, on the river, for operations against the Muntatik, while in 1775 they excelled all their previous exploits by sacking Bussorah. Were it not for the absence of further records, I have no doubt 1 could adduce other instances of action on the part of the Ka’ab, indicating either the exercise by them of sovereignty over the river or their joint enjoyment of it with the Turks. Note 7. The Status in Turkish T emit or y of the Sheikh and his Tribesmen. The provision of the Treaty of Erzeroum bearing upon the subject is as follows :— “ And they (the two Mussulman States) have agreed that the tribes concerning whom there is a dispute and whose suzerain is not known shall, once and for all, have the choice and election of the place where they will henceforward reside, and the tribes whose subjection is known shall be forcibly returned to the territory of the State to which they belong.” Read m connection with the treaty of 1823 this provision seems to indicate that the wandering or Ilyat tribes of the northern border are referred to rather than the settled tribes of the Shatt-el-Arab, and in this connection it would be interesting to know whether the word “ tribu ” in the French text is Ilyat or Tawa’if in the original Persian or Turkish text. It is, I think, clear from the correspondence of 1847, that the tribes referred to in the treaty are not nomads, but the settled tribes (see enclosures in Mr. Wellesleys despatch No 81 of the 3rd March, 1847, Part III, pp. 39 and 40, of printed correspondence). — A. P. ,-^ ie second explanatory note of the mediating Powers also has an important earmg on the question, for it shows that Turkey then contemplated without demur the possibility of tribes genuinely dependent on Persia finding themselves established partly in lurkey, as also did the representatives of the mediating Powers. I am unable to agree with Sir P. Cox's deduction, which is similar to that contained in Lieutenant W ilson s precis, either as to the attitude of the Porte or as to t at of the mediating representatives : the reason why the mediating repre sentatives confined their reply as they did is, I think, clear from p. 40 of Part 3 of the printed correspondence respecting the frontier, viz., that the point was already l /'/s ilson s precis, pp. 5 and 6, based on Saldanha’s Bombay selections.provided for by article 8 of the Treaty of Erzeroum, which stipulates that the tribes, if genuinely dependent on Persia, must return there. I would also invite reference to p. 29 of my memorandum; but I propose to discuss the point more comprehensively in my further paper respecting the jurisdiction of the Sheikh on the right bank of the Shatt-et-Arab, where, according to the Explanatory Note, Persia can, under no pretext whatever, lay claim to any territory : and I would only add here that my apprehension is that Turkey may possibly insist on more drastic administrative intervention by Turkish officials, in such a manner as might prove distasteful to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. — A. P. Again, the Ka’ab Muhaisin, &amp;c., are not wandering or pastoral tribes, but agri cultural communities seldom changing their abode, and generally owning at least a share in the lands cultivated by them. Eieutenant Wilson (p. 58 of his precis) says that annually many of them are to be found in Persia 100 miles distant from their homes in Turkey. — A. P. It should also be borne in mind, in considering the possible inconvenience that * the Turks may bring about by agitating this question, that the Persian tribesmen settled in Turkey are very numerous, and that their expulsion would so completely dislocate the whole agricultural system of the Bussorah vilayet, to the detriment of the wealthy Turkish landowners concerned, that it is quite improbable that the Turks would in anv case proceed to such extremes. .Moreover, the tribes are numerically so powerful and so closely united by financial and other ties to the resident Turkish population that it would hardly be possible for the Turks to take any action without resort to force on a large scale, a course which would almost certainly bring on a general conflagration. The tribesmen on the other hand are mostly adscripti glebce in one way or another, and would be extremely loth to leave the lands with which they have been long associated, and of which in many cases they have become part owners. For the legal aspect of the question 1 would invite reference to Lieutenant Wilson’s precis (p. 55 et seq.) which deals with the subject fully from this point of view, and seems to give a very fair representation of the present state of affairs. I cannot quite agree with all Lieutenant Wilsons conclusions, but I prefer to develop my arguments in my separate paper on the subject, after consultation with the Legal Advisers as to how far, if at all, the Treaty of 1875 is applicable — A. P. As regards the attitude which His Majesty’s Government should adopt towards the question, I should like to hear the sheikh’s considered views on the subject before making any definite recommendations, but, speaking generally, 1 think that the problem is one w hich requires no further special treatment by treaty or otherwise, as the existing stipulations of the treaty of 1875 (Aitchison, vol. xii, Appendix 20 ) should suffice to safeguard the legitimate interests of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, if fairly enforced by Turkey. The question of reciprocity on the part of Persia, as things stand at present, does not arise, on this part of the frontier at any rate, the number of Turks residing on Persian soil being infinitesimal. Finally, it should be remembered that from the local point of view the adminis trative system of Turkey am! Persia have been freshly superimposed, during the last two decades, after being dormant for centuries, upon a far more ancient and effective tribal system common to both banks of the river, and that whatever may be settled between the two Governments, the Arab communities on either side of the river will continue to be guided by tribal law and customs rather than by complicated foreign systems of law administered by venal officials, and wholly unsuited to their simple needs. Note 8. Page 4 6 : d'he Position and Status of the Hawizeh District. It will be noted that the maps at pp. 2 , 16, and 45 alike refrain from placing Hawizeh in Turkish territory. | 2506 m —I] E‘marram From the report of the mediating commissioners of 1850 ;;: ' it is plain that they never visited Hawizeh, or the frontier line which they so airily attempted to lay down, and that they expressly placed it on record that they had fixed no frontier in this direction pending further investigations. ^ . rf In any case, Colonel Williams’ diagram (opposite p. 25) is hopelessly inaccurate; ' he shows the Juab River (Suwaib or Karkheh) as running through Hawizeh, instead of some 16 miles to the west of it. The mere fact that he calls it the Jaabt River is something of an admission. Major Rawlinson’s map at p. 16 is equally vague, and he places Hawizeh many miles out of position. The commissioners are full of explanations of their boundary line in the neighbour hood of the Shatt-el-Arab, but I have failed to find anv remarks dealing with the boundary round Hawizeh. Had the commissioners realised the nature of the boundary they purported to lay down they could scarcely have failed to offer some explanations in regard thereto, but they are silent—as also, it seems, were the Turkish and Persian commissioners. It should be noted, too., that Sir A. H. Layard, who seems to have been biased on the whole in favour of Turkey, suggested a boundary which ran west of Hawizeh (pp, 8 and 53). He was doubtless glad to fix it there from his personal experiences of the district, in which respect he seems to have had an advantage over the commissioners. His views have been published, and may carry weight with the Turks. It would a'p'pear very inexpedient to appeal to Sir H. Layard’s published views respecting the Hawizeh region when in the same passage he has expressed views regarding the Mohammerah region so decidedly unfavourable to Persia. — A. P. From a reference to p. 10 of Wilson’s precis, it will be seen that in no case can “ Bussorah and its acknowledged dependencies” be held to have included in 1639 the district of Hawizeh, which was then undisputedly Persian. In 1727, moreover (see p. 55, precis), it was provided by treaty that the province of Hawizeh should be ceded to Persia, though it does not appear that the Turks had ever taken it. From p. 8 of the precis, it will he seen that about 1600 the Ka’ab applied to the Vali of Hawizeh for assistance against the Afshars ; it was then a Persian dependency. This is a mistake : by the Treaty of 1727, Hawizeh was ceded to Turkey, not Persia: but see enclosure in Sir G. Lowthers despatch No. 341 of the 23rd April, 1912.—A. P. There is no evidence—it is not even alleged—that the Turks have ever raised a penny of revenue out of Hawizeh, or had a military post there. On the other hand, there is strong evidence that Hawizeh has been under Persia and paying revenue more or less continuously since 1600. It is of importance also to note that in 1877, when war threatened to break out between Turkey and Persia, the main Persian army was collected at Bisaitin, a village a few miles north of Shuaib and north west of Hawizeh, where the Governor-General was occupied in coercing a refractory sheikh of the Ma’adanJ (for remarks on whom see “Gazetteer,” p. 1254). The precise position of Bisaitin lias not yet been fixed, but it is a recognised point at or near the Hawizeh frontier, as locally observed. At the time in question there was no suggestion that the force was beyond the border of Arabistan, though it is on record that the presence of troops at Mohammerah was regarded as a menace (Enclosure 5 , idem). Since 1877 the Persians have constantly sent armed forces to collect taxes, &amp;c., and, as far as I know, on no single occasion has any objection been raised by Turkey. The most recent occasions are 1905 and 1908 (see pp. 20 and 21 of precis). With reference to p. 45 of the Foreign Office memorandum, as the Turks have never occupied the district, there can be no question of their giving it up or abandoning it; as far as I am aware, they have never seriously laid claim to it, and it has been from time immemorial in the hands of Turkey and separated from Turkey by a wide marsh (see resident’s letter of the 6 th May). * * We will defer dealing with the sinuosities and the prolongation of this line in the direction of Hawizeh until our engineers have made their investigation of this line in the above-mentioned spots. j The Arabic equivalents of “ K,” Jf’ and “ Ch ” are commonly interchangeable, thus Kaab = Jaab = Chaab. 1 See sub-enclosure 1 to enclosure 3 of Resident’s letter of April 8, 1912 , to Foreign Department, a copy of which was sent to His Majesty’s Foreign Office.13 No adjustment on the basis of the mediating commissioners’ line is conceivable ; it is not merely a question of territory, for the present boundary is a natural one, very strong strategically for both parties, and as such deserving of adoption. It is also a _ racial boundary, for the tribes on the Turkish side of the border are, like their masters, Sunnis, whereas the Beni Taruf, Beni Salih, &amp;c., are Shiahs, like Persians. A bitter hostility exists between them,* and I am persuaded that no decision of The Hague or of any other body could give effect in practice to any other frontier but the present, except at the expense of much blood and money. It need scarcely be said that Turkey would not gain in any way from such an extension of her territory, as the Arab tribes on this border pay no taxes to .Turkey to speak of. Note 9. Page 4f&gt; : The Sheikh of Mohammerah’s purchases of Land. I am unable to understand what can have given rise to the idea that the sheikh is pursuing a policy of gradual territorial encroachment by means of the purchase of real estate. A general survey of his position in Turkey as a landowner is given at p. 58 of Wilsons precis, but it cannot be too strongly emphasised that the sheikh conforms to Turkish law like any other foreigner in all matters concerning his estates and buildings on Turkish soil, and that the purchase of land by him involves no question of territorial encroachment any more than in the case of Sheikh Mubarak, who has also purchased in recent years extensive properties in Turkey. I would refer to pp. 58 and 59 of Lieutenant Wilson’s precis on Arabistan. —A.P. Although in 1909 a hot-headed vali did much to strain the relations existing between the sheikh and the local Turkish officials, this year (1912) the sheikh’s relations are again cordial, and, if things are allowed to remain where they are, will doubtless remain so. Note 10. Map opposite p. 46. I venture to point out that this map is quite inaccurate, and has been cancelled and withdrawn from sale by the Survey of India. Beference should be made to the map enclosed in Lorimer’s “ Gazetteer,” or to the 4-mile = 1 -inch maps of Arabistan, which were sent to His Majesty’s Foreign Office in 1909. Enclosure 3 in No. 1 .

HIS Excellency the vali stated that the frontier line between Turkey and Persia was at present a matter of dispute between the two countries, that the Porte claimed Moham- merah as Turkish territory, that negotiations were pending between the two countries by which Persia would give up certain territory between Zoab and Khanikin, and that in consideration thereof Turkey was to relinquish all claim to Mohammerah and the islands in that vicinity. o * * See “ Gazetteer,” p. 69.jarirm* 7^1 [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Governmenf ] St [B] PERSIA.

I am sending a copy of this letter and enclosures privately to Sir A. Hirtzel. Yours sincerely, P. z. COX. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox to Government of India. [Note by Mr. Parker.—My comments are inserted in italics. Some of the points have already been dealt with on the telegraphic correspondence.—A. P.] Sir, Muscat, May 21, 1912. IN submitting the accompanying notes relating to points of detail in Mr. Alwyn Parker’s memorandum of April 1912 on the subject of “the frontier between Moham- merah and Turkey,” I have the honour to offer the following observations for the consideration of the Government of India, on the bearing of the memorandum as a whole and the line of policy advocated therein. 2 . The findings arrived at in the memorandum may be summarised as follows :— (a.) As regards the riparian tract west of Mohammerah, it is agreed that there is a case for supporting a Persian claim for the formal recognition and confirmation of the status quo as represented by the boundary locally observed. ( 6 .) As regards the district of Hawizeh, it is suggested that there are no grounds for any modification of the arbitrary line inserted in the mediating commissioners’ rough diagram as indicating the boundary recommended for adoption in respect of that locality. My suggestion in my memorandum under discussion was overruled (see tele gram No. 335 of the llth April, 1912, to St. Petersburg). I may add that I am convinced by Sir P. Cox's facts and arguments on this point that my suggestion ivas inexpedient. — A. P. (c.) As regards the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab, it is held that a claim on the part of Persia to the mid-channel boundary is untenable. (d.) Apart from the above main issues under immediate consideration, Mr. Parker expresses the apprehension that the question of the status of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in the matter of jurisdiction over those of his tribesmen who tenant lands in admittedly Turkish limits must come up incidentally for discussion in the course of the frontier negotiations now in progress at Constantinople. He merely touches on this problem lor the purpose of indicating the probability of the contingency arising. My words were that it “ is not unlikely to be discussed.' I am preparing a separate paper on this question. — A. P. (e.) Lastly, he suggests, at the conclusion of his memorandum, that the Sheikh of Mohammerah seems to be pursuing a policy of territorial encroachment by means [2506 m— 1 ] B Qpoy ~ro i p|a 5 JUL1912 SECRETARY'S N 2 27 _2 of the purchase of real property in Turkish limits, and expresses the view that it is undesirable that we “should give him any encouragement in this course. As I have already pointed out, my misapprehension, if it is one, rests'n certain passages, especially on pp. 58 and 59, of Lieutenant Wilson’s precis oh Arabistan. — A. P. 3 . Speaking briefly, the notes now submitted may be said to bear on the several points above cited to the following extent:— As regards (a), it is shown— ( 1 .) That there has been no encroachment by Persia at this part of the frontier for the last sixty years at least, and that the boundary which has throughout this period been locally observed by both parties is apparently identical with that claimed by Persia in 1850,'* which, it will be remembered, was only modified in the recommendations of the mediating commissioners in order to secure to Turkey safe navigation up to Bussorah ; and ( 2 .) That the experience of the same sixty years has demonstrated that the danger then apprehended to Bussorah from the occupancy of these lands by Persia is really non-existent, and is in any case provided against by the undertaking entered into by the latter to erect no fortifications. This, the non-existence of the danger, as demonstrated by experience, is precisely what I have pointed out on p. 38 of my memorandum. — A. P. As regards (b), it is submitted that the rough diagram enclosed in Colonel Williams’ despatch of the 4th February, 1850,t has already been shown to be altogether sketchy and inaccurate and not drawn according to scale; that the boundary-line inserted in it was apparently drawn arbitrarily and without any visit having been made to the locality, and without knowledge of the local geographical or political conditions existing; that the Hawizeh district has, in fact, been a recognised district of Persia for three centuries; that its boundaries are well recognised, and that the adoption of the arbitrary line shown in the diagram is not feasible in practice. As regards (c), further arguments, based on both legal and practical considerations, have been adduced in support of the attitude adopted by tbe India Office in their letter to the Foreign Office dated the 3 rd June, 191 l.J See my minute on p. 4, under 8 .— A. P. Items (d) and (e) : Discussion of these points hardly comes within the scope of the present letter ; I may therefore confine myself to a reference to the text of my notes themselves, merely reiterating in regard to (e) that Mr. Parker’s observations seem to be based on a misunderstanding of the sheikh’s proceedings. My mi sunder standing arose from Lieutenant Wilsons precis (vide supra).— A. P. 4. As to the line of policy which His Majesty’s Government can best adopt under the circumstances, Mr. Parker’s recommendations are :— ( 1 .) As regards (a), that we should confer with the Bussian Government and get them to agree to our jointly advising the Persian Government to induce the Turks to reveal the extent of their claims in respect of the neighbourhood of Mohammerah, and then to press their claim for the recognition of the boundary (at Di’aiji) as locally recognised and observed, and that we ourselves should simultaneously intimate to the Porte in a friendly way the great importance which we attach to the maintenance of the status quo, and ask them to take our wishes into favourable consideration. ( 2 . s That as regards (b), we should seek no departure from the arbitrary line drawn by the mediating commissioners. (3.) That as regards (c), we should support the claim of the Turks to the whole channel. 5. It remains for me, as directed, to express my personal views with reference to those conclusions and recommendations. While 1 fully appreciate the soundness and advantage of the course adopted by Mr, Parker, in drawing up his memorandum and framing his recommendations from the pure!)' legal standpoint, from which the subject would probably be treated in the main * Vide p. 37 of memorandum. t Opposite p. 25 of memorandum. + P. 31 of Foreign Office memorandum.4 if it went before The Hague Court, yet I think that it is generally agreed that it is very greatly to our interests to avert an appeal to that court by diplomatic action ; and 't is hoped that these notes, read in conjunction with Mr. Parker’s memorandum, will feffice to demonstrate that the Persian contentions in regard to the boundary from Dawairij southwards are well-founded, and will enable His Majesty’s Government to undertake that action with confidence. A copy of the Foreign Office memorandum of the 23rd February, 1912, in ichich a reference to The Hague Tribunal was first deprecated, has been sent to Sir P. Cox. It is in consequence of the inexpediency of such a reference that an alternative course was suggested in the Foreign Office letter of the 31st May, 1912 (No. 22191) to the India Office. — A. P. 6 . As regards point (a), I agree that we should in the first instance confer with the Russian Government with a view to obtaining their co-operation ; this, judging by their attitude at the time of the Treaty of Erzeroum* we may presumably expect them readily to afford. 1 would urge, however, that in our communication to the Porte we should g;o con siderably further than Mr. Parker suggests. The expediency of making some intimation to the Porte of the nature of our engagements with the Sheikh of^ Mohammerah has aln ady been deliberately considered by His Majesty’s Government in connection with the Zain incident of 1910, and approved of in principle. The local authorities at Bussorah have even been informed in the most explicit manner by Hip Majesty’s consul at Bussorah that the Sheikh 6 f Mohammerah is under British protection.t This announcement was widely promulgated in Turkish and Arabic papers at the time, and must be common knowledge to the Porte. Surely, in view of these considerations, we are now in a position to speak freely to the latter, explaining that we have been m the best possible position for being aware of and taking note of the nature o± the status quo, as locally observed for the past sixty years or more ; that taking for granted, as we were warranted in doing, the permanence of that status quo, we have entered into engage ments with the Sheikh of Mohammerah which involve its maintenance, and that both our interests and our good name preclude us from_ going back on these pledges or permitting any alteration of the sheikh’s position on the Shatt-el-Arab and m Arabistan As regards (b). It is submitted that it has already been pointed out in the past correspondence that the rough and small-scale diagram^ enclosed in Colonel \\ ilhams despatch of the 4 th February, 1850, was not a document on which any reliance could be placed • that the boundary line shown in it must have been arbitrarily drawn ; that as far as Hawizeh is concerned, it is clearly only very approximate and indeterminate, and must have been so inserted in the absence of any local knowledge or visit to the locality ; that the Hawizeh district has been a recognised district of Persia for three centuries, that there is no record of its having been claimed by Turkey, and that the adoption of the arbitrary line shown in Colonel Williams diagram is not feasible m practice. Vide supra under 2 (b).— A. P. 7 . Should it be necessary for Persia to make some concession to Turkey as a set-off against the abandonment of the latter’s claim in the Arabistan region, I would recal to mind that the Turks seem in 1891§ to have contemplated such abandonment in return for the cession of certain territory between Zohab and Khamkm, and it might be possible to come to some such arrangement now. The very important British 01 cession at Kasr-i-Shirin would probably be affected by such a cession of territory, but if the Turks would consent to guarantee the continuance of this, the change of nation ality might not improbably operate to the benefit of t he company. Zohab is largely within the Russian sphere: moreover, Persia seems now to attach almost greater importance to Zohab than to Mohammerah. A. Locallv, the only concession which it would appear that we can advisedly recom- mend to the Persian Government to agree to, in order by friendly compromise o eliminate the boundary betweeh Dawairij and the Shatt-el-Arab from the issues referable to The Hague, is that the line should be drawn from the channel west of the village of Shu’aib direct to Kishk-i-Bussorah, and thence to the locally recognised * P, 19 of memorandum. + Opposite p. 25 of memorandum. •j- P.61 of Wilson’s precis. § See Annex (II) to this letter.boundary on the S hatt-el-T h'/aiji. A considerable strip of territory would thus be relinquished to Turkey, especially if we consider Persia’s original claim—the course of the marsh channel from west of Hawizeh until it reaches the Shatt-et-Arab. Pers^, can afford to do this 3&gt; for, although the area involved is an extensive one, with irrigabic potentialities which it is hard to estimate, it is nevertheless probable that the nomad occupation and cultivation by Shi’eh Arab tribes under Persia would remain unaffected and that lurkish subjects and Turkish influence would continue to be as non-existent and unknown east of the natural boundary as they are under existing conditions 8 . As regards (c) I can only say that nothing in Mr. Parker’s memorandum 5 th May ^ ^ a ^ ^ V1GW ex P ressed m m y telegram dated Mohammerah, the o; l tooiild refer to the following passage, based on the legal opinion of bn L. Dcividson, Mr. Hurst, and Mr. Malkin, and quoted from the Foreign Ofice letter^ of the 31st May, 1912 {No. 22934) to the India Office ^ Gr ey advised that under normal conditions there is no doubt a presumption that each riparian owner owns on his side of the river usque ad medium uia aquae, bin, that, in the present case, that presumption has by implication urMoubtedhj been swept away by the terms of the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847) the effect of which was to give Turkey the whole waterway.” I would also refer to the view of Admiral Slade, A. Hirtzel and Mr Burst (see joint letter of the 15th May, 1 912, to Sir E. Grey (No. 20863)). A. P. 9. In conclusion, I would urge that having regard to the fact that our commercial stake and mterests in Southern Persia, present and potential, now mainly centre in abistan, and are bound up with the maintenance of the Sheikh of Mohammerah’s position and the strengthening of our special relations with him, we have evei-nhino to lose by a course of action (the failure to safeguard the status quo which'has been regaided and treated by the present generation as the established order of thino-s) which will tend greatly to discredit the value of our engagements and snimort 5 j create in the minds of the Arab public in the Gulf and the nftive rulers in treaty ’with us a feeling of apprehension and uncertainty which we can bv no means especially at this juncture, afford to disregard. - ’ P ' at Our attitude will, in fact, be regarded as a crucial test of our sincerity and abilitv to make good our engagements, and I would add the personal opinion that the increased confidence and frank reliance m us, which the Sheikh of Koweit has shown within the ast two years, has tieen due less to anything that we have done for him than to the practical demonstration in the case of Mohammerah of the substantial and moral value of pm steadfast friendship and support: I should view with very great concern any action calculated to weaken those sentiments. ^ / here is a consensus of opinion as the importance of obtaining the most favourable settlement possible for the sheikh, due regard being had the same tmie to our general relations with Turkey, to legal and treaty considerations and to the expediency of not arousing misgivings as to the justice of our attitude in Turkey u here the Sheikhs of Mohammerahand Koweit, our proteges, have largely invested in real estate, and might suffer from resentment entertained against government.

Page 4 : Fort at Failiyeh destroyed by order of the Commissioners in order to secure Freedom of Navigation for Turkey. It may be observed that the boundary as locally recognised leaves the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab a few hundred yards above the sheikh’s palace at Failiyeh (which is in no sense a fort) and passes behind wooded islands, which completely shut off Persian territory from the view of the navigable channel. Thus its adoption would not give Persia control of the left bank beyond Failiyeh. As regards Failiyeh itself, and, indeed, as regards the whole of his frontier, the sheikh has rigorously observed the undertaking to build no fortifications which was given by the Persian envoy in 1848 (see foot of p. 48). Note 2 . Page 10 : The Haffar Canal. (See also reference to it by Layard at pp. 52 and 53.) The exposition here given of the geographical position of Mohammerah and the rough sketch map given in illustration are both based upon the assumption that the section of the waterway on which Mohammerah stands is an artificial cut, and that the latter is the “ Haffar ” properly so called. I submit that this assumption is erroneous. The testimony of ancient maps and documents which, owing to my absence from books and records, I am unable to quote in extenso, is that the position was originally as shown in the accompanying very rough sketch. That is to say, that the Karun flowed via Marid and the old settlement of Kubban to the Khor Musa, whilst the Shatt-el-Arab bifurcated at the present site of Mohammerah and divided its waters from thence to the sea between its present channel and the Bahmanshir branch. The term “Haffar” is applied locally invariably to the reach of the Karun above Mohammerah between Marid and the head of the Bahmanshir, and in no case to the wateiway on which Mohammerah stands, which, on the contrary, is often called Bahmanshir (see “Gazetteer,” p. 598, and Lieutenant Wilson’s 1 m. = 1 inch maps of Mohammerah and the Shatt-el-Arab for further explanations as to the position of the Haffar reach). 2506 m —1] C1 i! There is a well-known tradition current locally that the bed of the Karun from Marid, where the old Karun diverges, to the head of the Bahmanshir, was once an artificial cut for small boats, and so narrow, to quote the words of the tradition, “ that one'woman could hand to another a basket of dates across the water.” ^ Gradually, however, the Karun tended to adopt the canal for its surplus waters, as the Kubban Channel became silted up ; dams were built to counteract this tendency, but in vain, and finally the river abandoned the Marid-Kubban bed and flowed south wards to the Bahmanshir. There is strong inductive evidence of the correctness of the above tradition deducible from the levels of the old and new stream beds and other considerations, which have received the endorsement of Sir W. Willcocks, who has made a close studv of the question. It may further be asked, when the Karun entered the sea via Kubban, what was the position and raison d’etre of the Bahmanshir, if it was not at that time a mouth of the combined waters of the Euphrates and Tigris ? Other pertinent arguments may be adduced, such as the great size and depth of the Hafiar, and the nature of the delta of the Bahmanshir, but the subject is not one which atfects the frontier directly, and is only touched on here to show that the arguments of the responsible officers of that period were not always founded on a basis of unassailable fact. Note 3. Page 12 : The Independence of the Kdab and their original Nationality. Whether the Ka’ab (or Chaab) emigrated from Najd (as stated by Mr. Lorimer in his “ Gazetteer ’ at p. 961) or from the Arabian coast (as stated by Lieutenant Wilson on the authority of an old native historical record, vide p. 8 of his precis), their stay at Wasit, on the Shatt-el-Hai in Turkish territory, was only a short one, and Najd and the Arabian coast being alike independent at the time, their brief sojourn in Turkish territory does not make them a Turkish tribe. lurkish dominion over Mesopotamia was then very shadowy except at Bussorah and Bagdad, and the statement of Mr. Townley in his memorandum of 1891, on the authority of information obtained in Tehran from the Turkish Embassy, that the Ka’ab were recognised as independent by the treaty of 1639, coming as it does from a Turkish source, is primd facie probable. There is, I think, no doubt that the Chaab were not recognised as independent by the Treaty of 1639: all the versions we possess, including the Turkish versions and that obtained from Vienna and regarded as the most reliable, omit all reference to the Chaab, and the ipse dixit of the Turkish Embassy at Tehran, without any documentary proof, is, I submit, not of any decisive weight in view of the consistent evidence to the contrary afforded by all the versions of the treaty extant. Moreover, it is hardly conceivable that, if the Chaab were recognised as independent by the Treaty of 1639, the fact should not have transpired between 1842 and 1850.—A. P. Major Bawlinson’s conclusions at the top of p. 14 may, so far as they relate to the independence of the Ka’ab, be accepted as correct, with the exception of the assertion that they were Turkish subjects in 1639. It is impossible to reconcile this general statement with the record (printed at p. 8 of Wilson’s precis), to the effect that about 16 -jO on the accession of Shah Abbas, Imam Kuli Khan, Governor of larsistan, headed an expedition against the Ka’ab, and compelled them to pay revenue to the Shah of Persia. This statement indicates that some years before the treaty of 1639 the Ka’ab were admittedly Persian subjects, and one of the principal Turkish assertions thus falls to the ground. p P ± In any case it may be asked, What are the rights “ of which Turkey never made any formal renunciation ? ” The payment by the tribe of rents to Bussorah may, with due reseive, be admitted as evidence of the nationality of the lands concerned, but not of the subjectivity of the tribes paying it, as it has been constantly admitted that Persian tribes might occupy lands belonging to Turkey without surrendering their nationality, though without, of course, giving Persia a valid claim on that ground alone to the ownership of the lands occupies!. (See second query, p. 24.) I am not aware where this is “ constantly admitted;’ at any rate to the extent of allow nig the exercise of jurisdiction by a foreign Sheikh on Turkish territory. 1 would also refer to my minute under Note 7 on p. 10. A. P.As a matter of fact, painstaking local research has failed to find any trace or even tradition of payments to Turkey for any lands to the east of the frontier as now localfy recognised. * But equally 'painstaking local research hy Major Rawlinson in 1844 showed opposite results as regards the payments to Turkey up to that time. — A. P. Note 4. Pages 14 and 15 : Nationality and Ownership of the Lands lying between the locally recognised Boundary and Mohammerah. We have it on the authority of Pawlinson that towards the beginning of the 19th century the Ka’ab gradually withdrew from the part of the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab opposite and above Bussorah, and remained in possession of nothing higher up than the Tamar lands (see foot of p. 14). At p. 16 he states with regard to the Haffar lands that Turkey had no .valid geographical claim to them, and that for many years they had been practically lost to her. I submit that her claim to the Haffar lands is based upon the same arguments and is every whit as valid as her claim to the Tamar lands, which Rawlinson mentions in the same breath in the middle of p. 14, and that if Rawlinson considered Turkey’s claim to the Haffar lands invalid, it follows that her claim to the Tamar lands is likewise invalid. The claim of Persia to remain in possession of the lands may therefore be based on the following grounds :— 1 . That in 1844 (before the treaty of 1848), Major Rawlinson found these lands to be in possession of the Ka’ab (p 14), and considered that Turkey could not advance any valid geographical claim to them, and that for many years they had been practically lost to her. 2 . That for so long as Mohammerah has been in possession of the Ka’ab or of Persia, so long have these lands been in possession of the Ka’ab, and that the ruling of Sir Stratford Canning at p. 14, “that the principle of uti possidetis might be considered to apply to that district without injustice,” applies equally to Mohammerah and to the Tamar and other lands in question. Sir Stratford Canning’s statement that the Persians were not in possession of the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab higher than Mohammerah is directly contradicted by the contemporary evidence of Major Rawlinson at the foot of p. 14 of his memorandum of the 6 th January, 1844. 3 . That the claim made on behalf of Persia in 1850 of ancient occupation has been vastly strengthened by over sixty years of continued undisputed possession by Persia, and recognition of Persian sovereignty by local representatives of the Turkish Govern ment in many ways and on many different occasions. 4 . That the boundary as now observed has for many years been commonly and officially recognised as such by all concerned, both Arabs, Persiaus, and Turks. Cairns and other marks have been put up in the vicinity of the boundary line by common consent. (See (a) “Gazetteer,” p. 1257 ; (b) paragraph 4, p. 51, Wilson’s precis; (c) paragraph 4 , p. 52, idem; (d) paragraph 5, Lieutenant Wilson’s letter of the ath May, 1912, forwarded to Foreign Office and India under Resident’s letter of the 6 th May.) At Di’aiji, just beyond the boundary, there exists a regular lurkish customs post (see “ Gazetteer,” p. 110 ), the position of which implies the most explicit recognition by the Porte of the locally recognised boundary. ^ In view of fifty years’ continuous recognition of the present boundary by their local officials, it is surely impossible for the Turkish Government to claim some other line and refuse to be bound by the acts and omissions of its own agents. Qui fa( it per alium facit per se. . 5. That the explanatory note in no way bears on these paiticular lands, Mr. Wellesley (at p. 24) does not say that the lands referred to in the second explanatory note are immediately above Mohammerah, and it may be reasonably piesumed that the Porte was contemplating, with not unnatural anxiety, the lands above Di aiji and almost opposite Bussorah, which were then, as now, mostly in the hands of the a a (see Lorimer’s “Gazetteer,” pp. 108 to 111, which shows the Muhaism to be m practically in continuous occupation, as freeholders or leaseholders of Turkish territory, of the whole left bank of the river above Di’aiji to within 6 miles of Bussorah).6 . I hat Colonel Shie], an impartial observer, considered (p. 28) the Persian claim to Tamar m the main well founded^ but pressed on the Persian Government the acceptance of the decision of the mediating commissioners on other grounds tho«» of e x pedie nc y rather than of strict justice-the principle being that if the commission nad fixed the boundary higher up the river they would have placed the port of Bussorah at the mercy of the Ka’ab. After reading every despatch which was written at this period on the frontier question I have reached the conclusion that Colonel Shell, Her Majesty’s Minister at 1 ehran, held a mew if anything rather favourable to Persia, while Sir S Cannina held a mew more favourable to Turkey. On the whole, it would seem that Major Hawhnson, who made a minute study of local conditions and had access to the registry' at Bussorah, is likely to have formed the more accurate and precise conclusions Ihose conclusions, which deal specifically with each small district aie set forth m detail on pp. 16 and 23 of his memorandum of 1844 and reproduced in my memorandum of the 3rd April, 1912. / submit that they show with some degree of authority, that the Persian claim to sovereignty over the ichole country between the locally observed boundary at Diaji and the 'mediating commis sioners hne was not, m 1844, of uniform validity. However, I ventured in mu memorandum to express the view that His Majesty's Government can nevertheless now support Persia in claiming the whole country up to Diaji, and this view has been appr oved (see telegram No. 335 of the Uth April, 1912, to St. Petersburqh) TfCoZll^ nnpCndm9 take advantage Now such a consummation is avoided altogether by the locally observed boundary which leaves the mam channel just above Failiyeh, and runs about 1 mile distant from, but parallel to ,t near Di’aiji, thus giving ample protection to Bussorah against that port n ° r ° ther a ° ti0n '’ hich mi S ht to the detriment of As a matter of fact, the commissioners were very wide of the mark when the,.

When this jfeppens, the Turks might be established on the Persian bank. It will be seen from the correspondence on the subject of the “ Shalhah,” which took place in 1887, that this possibility was not lost sight of at that time, and that the island is now much nearer to the main shore than it then was. With the mid-channel line is also bound up the question of fishing rights. These are very valuable, as the inhabitants of both banks draw their principal food supply from the river ; they erect fish-traps on the mud banks and shore on either side, and spread seine nets in the stream, the inhabitants of ^ each bank keeping to their own side or half of the river. Fishing is free, and no taxation is levied on the industry by either Government. At present no friction whatever occurs in the matter of fisheries ; but if the lurks get both banks they will probably raise the question, according to their custom, in some crude and arbitrary form, and arouse the bitterest hostility among the tribes, who from time immemorial have enjoyed the use of the river. It is important, I agree, to provide against this. — A. V. Note 6. Page 42 : Legal Objections to the Mid-Channel Line. While admitting the force of the arguments adduced in Mr. Parker’s memorandum on which The Hague Court might rely in deciding in favour of the Turkish case, I would submit that the arguments which can be derived from the international law on the subject must also carry weight. . .. . , Tims, Wheaton (p. 291 et seq.) lays down that: “Where a navigable river forms the boundary of conterminous States, the middle of the channel or thalweg ^ is o-enerally taken as the line of separation between the two States, the presumption being that the right of navigation is common to both; but this presumption may be destroyed by actual proof of prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession, gnmg the riparian proprietors the exclusive title to the river.’’ . , , , I apprehend that a study of the records of Turkish Arabia and of the Ka ab for the past 200 years, as outlined in Lieutenant Wilson’s precis, will summarily dispose of any claim on the part of the Turks to “ prior occupancy and long undisturbed ^ I would further invite reference to the “Treaty of \ienna, 1815 (Heitslets Commercial Treaties, vol. i, p. 3 et seq.), to which, it would appear from a foot-note, Turkey has acceded, and which does not seem to contemplate the possibility of exclusi\ e ownership of interstatal rivers. See my minute on p. 4 under 8 .— A. P. The fact moreover, that the Porte has explicitly stated to Persia that should Turkey construct forts on the river in her territories, Persia might do likewise,- seems inconsistent with any assertion by Turkey of exclusive rights of sovereignty over the river since it places Persia admittedly in a position to erect forts at Mohammerah and elsewhere, a position which would enable her to close the river at will and prevent all access from Bussorah to the sea ; this contingency was actually anticipated m the formal discussions which took place between His Majesty’s Government and the Porte in 1888 regarding the fortifications at Fao.t ^ -i. The right to build such forts upon a river bank is surely one of the fust attributes of effective sovereignty. Our Legal Advisers do not agree with the conclusion arrived, at by Sir P. Cox as to the effect of fortifications on the ownership of the river {see Foreign Office letter of the ?Ast May, 1912, to India Office. —A. P. It is as a matter of fact, stated in a foot-note to p. 27 of the foreign Office memorandum, that Mahommerah town was excluded from this engagement; there is nothing in the papers quoted above to indicate that such was the case, but that it was so in practice may be inferred from the fact that in 1856 Persia had two large * Vide enclosure to Constantinople Embassy despatch No. 314, dated August 12, 1888, enclosed in 4, 1888 »nd note to Porte dated August 9 1888, referred to iu the embassy despatch quoted above, enclosed in Political Secretary s letter dated Jul} 2i, 1888.

P. 1 am not aware of any evidence that such was the case in practice while old records seem to indicate that from 1760 to 1780 at all events, the Ka’ab rather than ie Turks were paramount on the river.

I would also invite A reference to p. 29 of my memorandum; but I propose to discuss the point more ™ comprehensively in my further paper respecting the jurisdiction of the Sheikh on the right bank of the Shatt-et-Arab, where, according to the Explanatory Note, Persia can, under no pretext whatever, lay claim to any territory : and I would only add here that my apprehension is that Turkey may possibly insist on more drastic administrative intervention by Turkish officials, in such a manner as might prove distasteful to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. — A. P. Again, the Ka’ab Muhaisin, &amp;c., are not wandering or pastoral tribes, but agri cultural communities seldom changing their abode, and generally owning at least a share in the lands cultivated by them. Lieutenant Wilson (p. 58 of his precis) says that annually many of them are to be found in Persia 100 miles distant from their homes in Turkey. — A. P. It should also be borne in mind, in considering the possible inconvenience that the Turks may bring about by agitating this question, that the Persian tribesmen settled in Turkey are very numerous, and that their expulsion would so completely dislocate the whole agricultural system of the Bussorah vilayet, to the detriment of the wealthy Turkish landowners concerned, that it is quite improbable that the Turks would in anv case proceed to such extremes. Moreover, the tribes are numerically so powerful and so closely united by financial and other ties to the resident Turkish population that it would hardly be possible for the durks to take any action^ without resort to force 'on a large scale, a course which would almost certainly bring on a general conflagration. The tribesmen on the other hand are mostly adscripti glebce in one way or another, and would be extremely loth to leave the lands with which they have been long associated, and of which in many cases they have become part owners. ' For the legal aspect of the question I would invite reference to Lieutenant Wilson’s precis (p. 55 et seg.) which deals with the subject fully from this point of view, and seems to give a very fair representation of the present state of affairs. 1 cannot quite agree with all Lieutenant U ilsons conclusions, but I pi efer to develop my arguments in mi) separate paper on the subject, aftei consultation unth the Legal Advisers as to how far, if at all, the Treaty of 1875 is applicable—A. P. As regards the attitude which His Majesty’s Government should adopt towards the question, I should like to hear the sheikh’s considered views on the subject before makino - any definite recommendations, but, speaking generally, 1 think that the problem is one which requires no further special treatment by treaty or otherwise, as the existing stipulations of the treaty of 1875 (Aitchison, vol. xii, Appendix ^0)^ should suffice to safeguard the legitimate interests of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, if fairly enforced by Turkey. _ . , , , The question of reciprocity on the part of I ersia, as things stand, at present, does not arise, on this part of the frontier at any rate, the number of lurks residing on Persian soil being infinitesimal. . . . Finally, it should be remembered that from the local point ot view the adminis trative system of Turkey and Persia have been freshly superimposed, during the last two decades, after being dormant for centuries, upon a far more ancient and effective tribal system common to both banks of the river, and that whatever may be settled between the two Governments, the Arab communities on either side of the river will continue to be guided by tribal law and customs rather than by complicated foreign systems of law administered by venal officials, and wholly unsuited to their simple needs. Note 8. Page 46 : The Position and Status of the Hawizeh District. It will be noted that the maps at pp. 2 , 16, and 45 alike refrain from placing Hawizeh in Turkish territory. [ 2506 m —1]12 From the report of the mediating commissioners of 1850' ::: ' it is plain that they never visited Hawizeh, or the frontier line which they so airily attempted to lay down, and that they expressly placed it on record that they had fixed no fronthw in this direction pending further investigations. \ In any case, Colonel Williams’ diagram (opposite p. 25) is hopelessly inaccurate ; he shows the Jaab River (Suwaib or Karkheh) as running through Hawizeh, instead of some 16 miles to the west of it. The mere fact that he calls it the Jaabf River is something of an admission. Major Rawlinson’s map at p. 16 is equally vague, and he places Hawizeh many miles out of position. The commissioners are full of explanations of their boundary line in the neighbour hood of the Shatt-el-Arab, but I have failed to find any remarks dealing with the boundary round Hawizeh. Had the commissioners realised the nature of the boundary they purported to lay down they could scarcely have failed to offer some explanations in regard thereto, but they are silent—as also, it seems, were the Turkish and Persian commissioners. It should be noted, too. that Sir A. H. Layard, who seems to have been biased on the whole in favour of Turkey, suggested a boundary which ran west of Hawizeh (pp. 8 and 53). He was doubtless glad to fix it there from his personal experiences of the district, in which respect he seems to have had an advantage over the commissioners. His views have been published, and may carry weight with the Turks. It would appear very inexpedient to appeal to Sir H. Layard’s published views respecting the Hawizeh region when in the same passage he has expressed views regarding the Mohammerah region so decidedly unfavourable to Persia. A. P. From a reference to p. 10 of Wilson’s precis, it will be seen that in no case can “ Bussorah and_ its acknowledged dependencies” be held to have included in 1639 the district of Hawizeh, which was then undisputedly Persian. In 1727, moicover (see p. 55, precis), it was provided by treaty that the province of Hawizeh should be ceded to Persia, though it does not appear that the Turks had ever taken it. From p. 8 of the precis, it will he seen that about 1600 the Ka’ab applied to the Vali of Hawizeh for assistance against the Afshars ; it was then a Persian dependency. This is a mistake : by the Treaty of 1727, Hawizeh was ceded to Turkey, not Persia; but see enclosure in Sir G. Lowthers despatch No. 341 of the 23rd Anvil 1912.—A. P. J ^ &gt; There is no evidence—it is not even alleged—that the Turks have ever raised a penny of revenue out of Hawizeh, or had a military post there. On the other hand there is strong evidence that Hawizeh has been ^ under Persia and paying revenue more or less continuously since 1600. It is of importance also to note that in 1877, when war threatened to break out between Turkey and Persia, the main Persian army was collected at Bisaitin, a village a few miles north of Shuaib and north west of Hawizeh, where the Governor-General was occupied in coercing a refractory sheikh of the Ma’adanJ (for remarks on whom see “Gazetteer,” p. 1254) &amp; The precise position of Bisaitin has not yet been fixed, but it is a recognised point at or near the Hawizeh frontier, as locally observed. At the time in question there was no suggestion that the force was beyond the border of Arabistan, though it is on record that the presence of troops at Mohammerah was regarded as a menace (Enclosure 5 , idem). Since 1877 the Persians have constantly sent armed forces to collect taxes, &amp;c. and, as far as I know, on no single occasion has any objection been raised by Turkey The most recent occasions are 1905 and 1908 (see pp. 20 and 21 of precis) With reference to p. 45 of the Foreign Office memorandum, as the Turks have never occupied the district, there can be no question of their giving it up or abandonino- it; as far as I am aware, they have never seriously laid claim to it, and it has been from time immemorial m the hands of Turkey and separated from Turkey by a wide marsh (see resident’s letter of the 6 th May). v . ^ defer dealing with the sinuosities and the prolongation of this line in the direction of Hawizeh untd our engineers have made their investigation of this line in the above-mentioned spots- Chaab ^ ArablC e 9 mvalents of “ K, “ J, ’ and “ Ch ” are commonly interchangeable, thus Kaab = Jaab = X See sub-enclosure 1 to enclosure 3 of Resident’s letter of April 8, 1912. to Foreign Department, a copy of which was sent to His Majesty s Foreign Office. &amp; f iNo adjustment on the basis of the mediating commissioners’ line is conceivable ; it is not merely a question of territory, for the present boundary is a natural one, very strong strategically for both parties, and as such deserving of adoption. It is also a ^cial boundary, for the tribes on the Turkish side of the border are, like their masters, Sunnis, whereas the Beni Taruf, Beni Salih, &amp;c., are Shiahs, like Persians. A bitter hostility exists between them,* and I am persuaded that no decision of The Hague or of any other body could give effect in practice to any other frontier but the present, except at the expense of much blood and money. It need scarcely be said that Turkey would not gain in any way from such an extension of her territory, as the Arab tribes on this border pay no taxes to Turkey to speak of. Note 9. Page 46 : The Sheikh of Mohammerah's purchases of Land. I am unable to understand what can have given rise to the idea that the sheikh is pursuing a policy of gradual territorial encroachment b^ means of the purchase of real estate. A general survey of his position in Turkey as a landowner is given at p. 58 of Wilsons precis, but it cannot be too strongly emphasised that the sheikh conforms to Turkish law like any other foreigner in all matters concerning his estates and buildings on Turkish soil, and that the purchase of land by him involves no question of territorial encroachment any more than in the case of Sheikh Mubarak, who has also purchased in recent years extensive properties in Turkey. 1 would refer to pp. 58 and 59 of Lieutenant Wilson's precis on Arabistan. —A.P. Although in 1909 a hot-headed vali did much to strain the relations existing between the sheikh and the local Turkish officials, this year (1912) the sheikh’s relations are again cordial, and, if things are allowed to remain where they are, will doubtless remain so.

Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Extract from a Letter from the Assistant Political Agent Bussorah to the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, Bagdad, dated December 30, 1891, forwarded to the Government of Lidia in the Foreign Department under Bushire Residency Letter of February 1, 1892. HIS Excellency the vali stated that the frontier line between Turkey and Persia was at present a matter of dispute between the two countries, that the Porte claimed Moham- merah as Turkish territory, that negotiations were pending between the two countries by which Persia would give up certain territory between Zoab and Khamkm, and that in consideration thereof Turkey was to relinquish all claim to Mohammerah and the islands in that vicinity. o * See “ Gazetteer,” p. 69.ao.

I submit that this assumption is erroneous. The testimony of ancient maps and documents which, owing to my absence from boo&amp;s and records I am unable to cuote in extenso . is that ;. i© position was originally as shown in the accompanying very rough sketch. That is to say that the Karun flowed via Marid and the old settlement of Qubban to the Khor Musa, whilst the shatt al ’Arab bifurcated at the present site of Mohammerah and divided its waters from thence to the sea between its present channel and th© Bahmanshir branch The term H Haffar tt is applied loc-lly i^nvanably to the reachd* of|th 8 Karun above Mohammerah do tween Marid and the head of the Bali manshir, and in no case to the waterway on which Moha miner ah stands wnicn,on the contrary,is often called Bahmanshir. (see Gazetteer Page 588 and Lt.Wilson’s im.= linch maps of Mohammerah and the Shsfctt further explanations as to the position of the Haffar reach) There is a well-known tradition current locally that the bed cf of the Karun from Marid, twhere the old Karun diverges, to the head of the Bahmanshir, was once an artificial cut for small boats, and so narrow, to quote the words of the tradition, 'that one woman could hand to another a basket of dates across the water' Gradually however the Karun tended to adopt the canal for Its surplus waters, as the Qubban channel became silted up; dams were built to counteract this tendency, but in vain, and finally the River abandoned the Marid - Qubban bed flowed southwards to the Bahmanshir.* There i^fetrong inductive evidence of the correctness of the above tradition deducibl© from the levels of the old and new stream edS ’ aM ° tiler c derations, which have received the endorsementof sir w.wiilcoclcs, who hns made a close study of the question. Xt may fui’the.r oe ashed— when the Kaicun entened the sea via Qubban, what was the position and raison d'etre of the Bahmanshir, If it was not at that time a mouth of the combined waters of the Euphrates and Tigris? other pertinent arguments may be adduced, such as the great size and depth of the haffar, and the nature of the delta of tne Bahmanshlr, but the subject is not one which affects the frontier directly ana is only touched on here to show that the arguments of the responsible officers of that period were not always founded on a basis of unassailable fact. /l ewLjt U i f~r' /^U /3 6 f i Hh ^CruvnnJ ZIA, / &gt; fit/Ty k-l f ' &amp; yC kj: m ft ■ &amp;&amp;' y£ cykj $*4 , f li'K*- v? i/9 l l r. ![- fa r//, nu /a/ipage 13 The independence of* the Ka^fcy and their origlnaA hy Mr Lorimer in Mis ian coast,(as stated stated hy Lieut* Wilson on the authority of an d old native historical recordi, vide page S of his Precis), Tolley in his memorandum of 1891 on the authority of inform ation obtained In Tehran from the Turkish Embassy, that the Ka^b were recognised as independent by the Treaty 1839, cob coming as it does from a Turkish source, is prima facie probableJ Ma^or Rawlinson 1 s conclusions at the toprji of page 14 may, so far as they relate to the independence of the Ka 1 ab , he accepted as correct, with the exception of the assertion that they ^ere Turkish subjects in 1039.

At page 16 he states with regard to the Haffar lands that Turfcey had no val -ici geographical claim to them, and that for many years they had been practically lost to her.

The claim of .Persia to remain in possession of the lands may these -fore be based on the following grounds*;- (1) ttot in iBiKtefor. tne Treat, of ««,, n.jor Ra.linoon found these lend, to he m poos.oeton of the (w „ u) and considered that Tunc, could not ad™.. dan, to tne. and that for .an, the, nad ».«, praoUoall, loot to ' h©rj * (3) that for so long as Mohammerah has been in possession of the Ka-ab or of Persia, so long have these landsjbeen in possession of the Ka'ab and that the ruling of sir Stratford Canning at page 14 'that the principle of-uUnossldetls' might be considered to 'apply to th^lstnct without injustice' applies eoually to Mohammerah and to the Tamar/l^inVestlon.!

Now such a consummation is avoided altogether by the locally observed boundary, which leaves the main channel just above Palliyeh, and runs about i mile distant from but parallel to j-b 'oar Pi*aiji, thus giving ample protection to Basrah against tne construction of forts or other action which .wight operate to the aettandetriment of that port;i Ab a ^^-^©r of fact the Commissioners were very wide of the aaris; when they sought to protect Basrah aga nst the EaaxKa'ab by the simple expedient of an artificial boundary line.- If the Ka'ab wished to attach the commerce of Basrah they could do do ic at any time by waiting across the boundary.

No. M. 11 . Mohammerah, blr &gt; 5th May 1912. I have the honour to forward, under instructions from the Govern ment of India, a copy of a letter (No. M. 10 of 5th May 1912), which I have addressed to them on the subject of the Turco-Persian boundary in the region of the Shatt-el-Arab. I have, &amp;c., P. Z. Cox, Lieutenant-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. From Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, to the Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Henry McMahon, G.C.V.O., K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Govern ment of India, in the Foreign Department, Simla. No. M. 10. Mohammerah, ^ r &gt; 5th May 1912. In continuation of my telegram No. M. 9 of 6 th May 1912, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a further report on the subject of the Turco-Persian boundary in 'the vicinity of the Shatt-al-Arab by Lieutenant Wilson whom I deputed to re-examine the locality on the spot wuth a view to clearing up, if, possible, doubtful points on the record. 2 . To what he records I may add that when at Ahwaz a few days ago, whilst consulting the Shaikh regarding the Hawizeh boundary, I took the opportunity to question him regarding the nature of his ownership of the land between the locally recognized boundary and Failiyeh. He stated emphatically that there was no difference whatever in the nature of his tenure there (nor had there been in the case of his father) from that existing in the case of any other lands in his jurisdiction, as, for example, ’Abbadan, a part of which he has recently leased to the Oil Company; that is to sa\, that the possession of the land is vested m him not as private owner but as tribal overlord, his hereditary rights as such having been specifically recognized by farman from the Persian Government. 3. He altogether denied that in his own time or in that of his father (Le., since 1857), any tribute had been paid on account of any of these lands to the Government of Basrah. 4. The bona fides of the Persian claim to the sovereignty of the above lands, as already explained, receives constructive corroboration from the fact that though the Shaikh (and his predecessors), and their tribesmen have for many years been the private proprietors of large and valuable tracts of land on the islands and mainland adjacent to the boundary but in Turkish territory, the difference in the tenure is frankly recognised and the taxes readily paid to the Turkish authorities. There is no record of cases of such private ownership being used to build up factitious claims designed to convert the lands into Persian territory, nor, indeed, is there the slightest inducement to do so, for as proprietors in Turkish territory the occupants are, on the whole, better off than their fellows in Persian jurisdiction where the rights of landowners are less well defined, and they are more a prey to arbitrary treatment than they are in Turkey. 5. I will postpone any further remarks on the question of the frontier pending the receipt of the further papers promised in Foreign Office Despatch, No. 1, Political, 13,425/12, of 29th March 1912. S. 158.—i.2 6 As the question is under the lively consideration of His Majesty’s Government, I have ventured to send a copy of this letter simultaneously to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. I have, &amp;c., P. Z. Cox, The Hon. Lieut.-Colonel Lieutenant-Colonel. Sir Henry McMahon, G.C.V.O., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. From Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, Indian Army, on special duty, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, Mohammerah, 5th May 1912. In accordance with your instructions I yesterday revisited the Nahr- Khaiyin and made a close examination of the lands on its banks from its eastern mouth above the Shaikh’s palace to its western mouth at Liaiji, and I now have the honour to submit the following further details m amplification of previous correspondence. 2. The position of the various canals, with their names, and those of the various tracts of land which they water, Scale 4” = 1 mile. are shown in the attached sketch map. The following important alterations and additions have been made. 3. The Khaiyin Canal. I am satisfied that the name Khaiyin is applied to the whole canal from its junction with the Nahr Diaiji to its mouth above the Shaikh’s palace ; the small branch running north from the lower mouth and named by me originally Khaiyain is called Nahr Nazailah locally. 4. Tamar. I had not previously succeeded in identifying this place, which is referred to in Mr. Parker’s memorandum of 5th September 1910, and in subsequent correspondence : the identification of its position is of considerable importance as it indicates that the boundary as locally recognised is identical with that claimed by the Persians in 1850, on grounds which Colonel Shell considered in the main to be well founded, and which have gained additional force from 60 years undisturbed possession. My failure to identify it previously is found to be due to the fact that it had been assumed from the reading of the word in English that its phonetic sound would be Tamar or Tamr, which was not recognised by any of the local people from whom enquiries were made. As I had heard from you that on your way back from Hawizeh a property named Tamar had been mentioned to you I had no difficulty in identifying it beyond any doubt. 5. From conversation with local headmen from both Persian and Turkish territory, I obtained the following further statements regarding the status quo. All alike assured me that in their lifetime the boundary as now shown had never been questioned by Turkey, but that, on the contrary, the Turks had frequently given specific recognition to it. and many years ago had actually buried some coal in a pit near the present line as a permanent boundary mark. The periodical cleaning of the Nahr Khaiyin, they said, had always been undertaken by Persian subjects under the orders of the Shaikh, whilst the cleaning of the Diaiji canal w T as only undertaken under the orders of the Turkish mudirs. This seems a point of considerable importance in favour of the Persian case. 6 . The Shaikh’s palace in the Khumaiseh lands was, they said, built some 12 years ago, and has been occupied without question ever since by one of the Shaikh’s principal wives, and for the past six years by one of his sons who is in charge of the lands, though his youth at present makes his responsibility only nominal.3 ) ‘ • Saiyid (rhalib a local headman of some importance, who lives on the extreme border of the Persian territory, was not in his house when I called there, having proceeded with a large following to Ahwaz to join the army ■ v, which the bhaikh is now mobilizing. 8 . All the individuals whom 1 questioned drew a very clear line of distinction between the position of the Shaikh in the islands of Aqawat (which is cultivated by his tribesmen) Barin and Bowarin, Shamshamiyah, and Umm- ut-Tuwadeh, of the greater part of which islands he is the proprietor, and in Diaiji, where he is private owner of extensive date groves, and his position in the lands on the Persian side of the locally recognised boundary. In the case of the former he had always paid revenue to Government of Basrah, while in the latter case he was sole master and owner, putting in and ejecting cultivators as he thought lit, and exercising seigniorial jurisdiction, paying no dues to the Turkish Government, who had at no time attempted to exercise authority in the lands. ir- The cultivators are tenants at will of the Shaikh in his capacity as head of iti' the tribal community, and liable to ejection by him in favour of other Dij tribesmen. on * I have, &amp;c., A.

IbCl Copy of a letter from Hie Excellency the ft&amp;val Comaander-in-Chief, to the Secretary to the Government of Indie, Marine Department, Ho. 1462 XXI A., dated the 6 th May 1912. In reply to Marine Department letter of 24th ultimo, Ho• 35«5-6-il4., relative to the navigation of the Shatt-al- Arah river, I have the honour to report for the infoircation of His Excellency the V'iceroy and Governor General of India in Counoil that I am of opinion that every endeavour should he made to nettle the question of the Turkish and Persian -lI onoiors on the S&amp;att~al~Arah so that no disturbance of the line which has been observed locally for more than 60 -**• *er°e&lt;l to agree to the frontier the [Turkish Government years shall take place. If the Home Government/are claim ing, it will place the palace of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and a large tract of country which has always been regarded as belonging to the Sheikh in Turkish territory, and this could not but fail to have a far reaching effect on our position with the various Sheikhs in the Persian Gulf who for many years have been accustomed to look to the British Government to see that their interests are safe-guarded. The Sheikhs of Moharanerah and Kuwait are on very intimate terms and our relations with the latter would undoubtedly suffer and we should be considered by everyone to have sacrificedsacrificed the former to the Turk who is generally disliked hy them all. That news travels fast in the Gulf I know from several very pertinent questions asked me hy the Sultan of liasqat. 2* As far as the control of the waters of the Shatt-al-Arab is concerned there appears to he no objection to the Turkish proposal of a purely Gttoman-Aiverain Commission with a British member in Ottoman employ provided suitable guarantees can be obtained that the British member shall be appointed by the British Government, that his position on the Commission shall be a real one with an \ effective voice, and that no other foreigner^ shall be allowed on it.

Foreign Office May 31st, 1912 Sir Immecnate. I am directed dy Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknow ledge the receipt of your letter P.1950-51 of the 28th. ultimo forwarding telegraphic correspondence on the subject of the Shatt-el-Arah, and the draft of a telegram which, subject to the concurrence of Sir E. Grey, the Secretary of State for India proposes to despatch to the Government of India. Ae regards the first point in this draft telegram. Sir E. Grey is advised that under normal conditions there is no doubt a presumption that each riparian owner owns on his side of the river 'usque ad medium filum aquae', but that, in the present case, that presumption has by implication undoubtedly been swept away by the terms of the Treaty of Erzeroum,(l847), the effect of which was to give Turkey the whole waterway. He would accordingly suggest that there should be substituted for the words 'we are inclined to believe' The Under Secretary of State the India Office.(22934/12) the words H we consider, for the reasons given on pages 40-43 of Mr. Parker^ memorandum'. As regards point (2) Sir E. Grey is inclined to agree that the arrangement of 1848 was only a 'self- denying ordinance' on the part of Turkey and Persia. The memoranda presented to the Ottoman Government in 1887 and 1888 based the protest of Great Britain against the erection of fortifications at Fao on the grounds that they both constituted a menace to commerce and were inconsistent with the arrangement of 1848. Sir E. Grey considers, as at present advised, that the Turkish answer was sound in law, so far as the arrangement of 1848 was concerned. It Is clear that Turkey in 1888 admitted the right of Persia (apart from the self-denying ordinance) to fortify the left hank; hut Sir E. Grey is advised that the building of forts on the left or Persian hank of the Shatt-el-Arab would not affect the provisions of the Treaty of Erzeroum, or Turkey's rights to the waterway thereunder. The right of Persia to fortify (apart from the self-denying ordinance) flows from the fact that(22934/12) that the left hank belongs to Persia, and does not imply ownership of any part of the waterway. Sir E. Grey would therefore suggest that point (2) should he amplified accordingly. He agrees with point (3). As to point (4), he is advised that it is doubtful whether Article 2 of the Treaty of Erzeroum confers the right of navigation by Persian warships. Such naviga tion appears rather to be one of the practices pursued by Persia but not Justified by the strict law applica ble. He agrees with point (5); and he considers that there is no reason for the conclusion that such a categorical statement would have been made by Sir S. Canning on insufficient evidence. I am.

[A] PERSIA. [May 31.J '^CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1 . [22191] No. 1 . Foreign Office to India Office. Sir, Foreign Office, May 31, 1912. I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 23rd and 21th May, in which you forward two telegrams, dated the 23rd May, from the British resident in the Persian Gulf respecting the frontier in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah, and the negotiations now pending with Turkey in regard to British interests in the Persian Gulf. A separate letter will shortly be addressed to you, dealing with certain legal points raised in the shorter telegram from Sir P. Cox, to which von refer in your letter of the 28th May. In the meantime, Sir E. Grey considers it important to arrive at a definite decision in regard to the procedure to be followed, in order to bring about a satisfactory settle ment of the frontier between Turkey and Mohammerah. As soon as Sir P. Cox furnishes precise information—which, apparently, will not be available until the astronomical position of Hawizeh has been fixed—in regard to the frontier as locally observed, Sir E. Grey proposes to have a map reproduced, indicating this line, for communication to the Russian Government. As you are aware, the Russian Government have already promised His Majesty’s Government their support in upholding that line, though they have not been furnished as yet with full details regarding it (see Sir E. Grey’s telegram No. 335 of the 11th April, 1912, to St. Petersburgh, and Sir G. Buchanan’s reply No. 150 of the 16th April, 1912). Sir E. Grey proposes at the same time to inform the Russian Government that the prospects of a favourable award in regard to this portion of the frontier if the matter is referred to The Hague Tribunal are uncertain, and that in these circumstances he proposes to inform the Ottoman Government that His Majesty’s Government cannot conclude certain pending negotiations in regard to other British interests in the Persian Gulf, or acquiesce in the desired increase of the Turkish customs duties, unless the Turkish Government formally undertake not to disturb the land frontier as locally observed near Mohammerah. He will further suggest to the Russian Government that this is a solution to which, in his view, the Persian Government could not reasonably object, inasmuch as it would secure to Persia a frontier more favourable than that indicated by the line of the mediating commissioners, which Persia conditionally accepted sixty years ago. With regard to the boundary between the Persian Gulf and Diaji—that is, so long as it follows the course of the Shatt-el-Arab, His Majesty’s Government have already expressed to the Russian Government the view that a frontier more advantageous to Persia than the mediating commissioners’ line of 1850 could not be successfully claimed against Turkey, and the Russian Government have intimated their concurrence. But Sir E. Grey considers that the fact that the boundary of mid-channel has been locally recognised as 1 he boundary for a period of sixty years does afford a certain lever for His Majesty’s Government in negotiating directly with the Turkish Government, and one which may prove of value in securing satisfactory arrangements for the proposed commission for the conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab ; he would accordingly propose to inform the Turkish Government, when negotiations are reopened, that His Majesty’s Government consider that Persia and the Sheikh of Mohammerah have certain pre scriptive claims on the Shatt-el-Arab, and that His Majesty’s Government are only prepared to agree to the proposed draft convention provided the rights of Persia and the Sheikh of Mohammerah are adequately safeguarded, and provided also that the land frontier, as locally observed, is accepted by the Turkish Government. Sir E. Grej would be glad to be furnished with the views of the Marquess of Crewe on this subject ; and he would also be glad to be furnished with his Lordship’s observations on the draft convention and report regarding the future conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab, a copy of which is enclosed for convenience of reference.* In particular, he would be glad to know whether the draft convention should, in [2473 hh—1] * Joint letter of May 15, 1912.Lord Crewe’s opinion, be modified in any respect in order to provide for the pomts enumerated in the finkl paragraph of Sir P Cox’s shorter telegram of the j 3 rd May In regard to the longer telegram of the same date, I *0 enc ^ e &gt; e c information of the Marquess of Crewe, certain comments on deta ' • ’ LOUIS MALLET. Enclosure Telegram from Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox to the Marquess of Crewe. (Com municated by India Office, May 24.) Muscat, May 23, 1912. APART from question of jurisdiction over waters of Shatt-el-Arab, which has been dealt with separately, following are salient points of my letter No. M. b5, dispatched to Government of India and London on 21st May, regarding Turco- Persian frontier, in reply to Mr. Parker’s memorandum of 3rd April:— Firstly, independence of Kaab. State ment at p. 8 of Wilson’s precis shows Kaab to have been under Persia in 1620, that is, prior to date of Sultan Murad’s treaty. Moreover, available evidence tends to show that they never were really Turkish subjects. Secondly, ownership of the lands between the locally recognised frontier and Moham- merah. Local Turkish authorities have accorded unequivocal and repeated recog nition of present boundary by erection of marks and maintenance for many years of permanent frontier customs post at Diaiji; such action should make it impossible for them after a lapse of sixty years to claim another frontier to which their pretensions are at least doubtful. It is hardly likely that they would get support from Hague Tribunal. Thirdly, status in Turkey of sheikh and his tribesmen. Foreign Office seem to be unduly apprehensive in this regard. Pro visions of Treaty of Erzeroum appear to refer to nomad tribes only, and not to settled agriculturists like these. They represent bulk of very large agricultural community, and as Turks have no surplus population wherewith to replace them, it seems extremely unlikely that they will attempt to oust them, even if they were in a military position to do so, which is very doubtful. Problem has not caused much practical difficulty hitherto, and v* ill probably adjust itself if left to the local authorities. Sheikh of Mohammerah, at all events, will adopt a reasonable attitude in his own interests. in No. 1. Comments by Mr. Parker. Firstly. I have no observations to make on this beyond what is stated in my memorandum of the 3rd April, 1912. A full history of the Chaab is contained in Major Rawlinson’s memorandum of 1844. I have already pointed out that the state ment on p. 7 of Lieutenant Wilson’s precis to the effect that the independence of the Chaab was recognised by treaty is based on an erroneous reference and appears not to be founded on fact. But the point seems only to be of academic interest. Secondly. I have stated in detail in my memorandum the reasons why the prospect of a favourable issue of a reference to TJie Hague Tribunal seems uncertain: but the matter is admittedly one of speculation. ^Thirdly. A separate memorandum on this point is in course of preparation.Fourthly, boundary near Havize. From last paragraph of decision of mediating commissioners quoted at p. 49 of Wilson’s *~Veeis, it is plain that they neither visited Havize nor delimited any boundary on the spot in that locality, nor intended that their rough diagram should serve as a basis for demarcation. Again, local boundary described in my despatch No. M. 18, dated 6 th May, proves to be practically identical with that proposed by Rawlinson at pp. 17 and 18 of his memorandum of 6 th January, 1844, just received. Layard also suggested line west of Havize (vide pp. 8 and 53 of Foreign Office memorandum). Undisturbed pos session of Havize district is of most vital importance to Sheikh of Mohammerah, and it is inconceivable that we should tolerate any alteration of status quo in it, especially when Rawlinson stated categorically in 1844 that it was not in dispute. Fifthly, policy of Sheikh of Mohammerah in purchasing land in Turkey. It is a misapprehension to suppose he is seeking territorial encroachment. Such a contin gency does not arise, for in regard to these lands sheikh, like any other foreign land holder, is in position of a Turkish subject and is amenable to Turkish land laws. Sixthly, 1 have urged that we inform Turks that, having been close observers of the status quo as interpreted locally on the Shatt-el-Arab and in Arabistan for the last sixty years, we have reasonably [?J - guaranteed [?] its permanency, and have entered into engagements with sheikh from which we cannot recede and which pledge us to maintain it. This intimation will be no surprise to them, having regard to in timation made to Bussorah authorities by consul at Bussorah referred to at p. 61 of Wilson’s precis. Seventhly, I have suggested that, in exchange for satisfactory settlement of Fourthly. The boundary commissioners visited Hawizeh in February 1852, but only after they had drawn the line. When Sir P. Cox receives Sir E. Grey’s telegram No. 335 of the 11th April, .1.912, to St. Petersburgh he will perceive that “ His Majesty’s Government ivould strongly deprecate, on account of the local incon venience which would be caused, the disturbance of the frontier even as locally observed near Hawizeh.” I think Sir P. Cox is mistaken in saying that the mediating commissioners did not intend their diagram to serve as a basis for de marcation: though they did not intend it as a detailed basis. Fifthly. The misapprehension rests on the following passages quoted from pp. 58 and 59 of Lieutenant Wilson’s precis :— “ When reproved by the Persian G-overnors of Arabistan for favouring this policy (i.e., of land purchase in Turkey), the Sheikh of Mohammerah used to reply that he did so from patriotic motives and with the strategical object of securing from hostile influences areas of Turkish territory adjacent to that of Persia. “ The acquisition of lands of Umm-al-Rassis and Umm-al-Khassasif, opposite Mohammerah and Failiyeh respectively, and of the Diaji lands on the Turco-Persian frontier was used to illustrate this point of view, which found ready acceptance, and the purchase of the islands of Shamshamiyah by the Sheikh in 1909 may be quoted as another instance of this policy, although it is doubted whether it has ever been so regarded by the Sheikh. It is certain, however, that the almost complete absence of active frontier disputes in Arabistan and the Shatt-el-Arab is in no small degree due to the fact that the Sheikh of Moham merah is the actual owner of all lands in the neighbourhood of the Turco-Persian boundary, and of all islands in the Shatt-el-Arab which might form objects of dispute.” Sixthly. It is doubtful whether our assurances to the Sheikh of Mohammerah can be so interpreted as to pledge His Majesty’s Government to maintain the status quo as locally interpreted, even in face of an adverse award by The Hague Tribunal. It is not clear whether the status quo here referred to is that of the frontier, or whether it is intended to in clude the exercise of jurisdiction by the sheikh on the right bank of the Shatt-el- Arab, even if the Turks object to the exercise of such jurisdiction : on this latter point vide supra, under “thirdly.” * Seventhly. Zohab lies largely within the Russian sphere in Persia.J • V 'boundary question as regards ^ Arabistan without recourse to Hague Tribunal, we might support Turkey in their claim to the Zohab lands, which in 1891 [?] they proposed to take in exchange foi abandon ment of their [? lands] in the Arabistan Their claim in the Zohab region region. might be sup- com- was This I am not sure what correspondence is here referred to. i seems fairly strong, and ported b } 7 ns on condition that oil pany’s concession at Kasr-i-Shirin obtained and confirmed by them, might even be an advantage to the com pany. Eighthly, 1 have urged our interests in South Persia now centre mainly in Arabistan, and are bound up with the maintenance of the sheikh’s position. Thus we have everything to lose by failure to preserve well-established status (j[uo, a course which will greatly discredit value of our engagements in the Gulf generally, and sow seeds of doubt and distrust in the breasts of other native rulers and com munities with whom we are in relations. In this connection I believe improved and trustful attitude of Sheikh of Koweit is due less to what we have done for him personally than to his innocuous [? in genuous] appreciation of the patent value of our support for his friend the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Please also see admiral’s letter of 6 th May, in which I concur. Lastly, I would observe that recent marked and persistent endeavours of the Porte to take advantage of our friendly attitude during negotiations, in order to prejudice local status quo to their advantage in regard to various issues under dis cussion, entirely bear out apprehensions expressed at conclusion of joint Indian and Foreign Office minute of 24th April; and I respectfully urge that unless we can in duce Turks at early date to comply with our requirements we should consider expediency of breaking] off negotiations and asserting ourselves effectively in the Gulf at the points where our claims conflict. (Addressed to Government of India; repeated to India Office.) Eighthly. There is a consensus of opinion as to the importance of securing the most favourable settlement possible for the sheikh. A. P. Foreign Office, May 30, 1912.17 FOREIGN SECRET TELEGRAMS. Secret Department. From Political Resident, Persian Gulf, 23rd May 1912. M. 93. Secretary of State’s telegram dated 8 tli May and your telegram On 21st May 1 posted demi-officially to Simla and London provisional letter No. M. 85, dealing with advance copy Foreign Office memorandum. I have received to-day and studied official papers posted in London 26th April, and now beg that the above-mentioned letter may be accepted as official and its receipt await [? ed] if possible. Careful study of above papers and other records gives me no reason for modifying views in my telegram of 5th May regarding Shat-el-Arab. On the contrary I have presented further argument or evidence favouring the Persian claim and possibility of its being upheld a [? at] Hague Tribunal. For instance Wheaton, page 291, requires “prior occupation or long undisturbed possession 11 as a necessary condition of exclusive sovereignty over any interstatal river. Historical and other evidence shows Turkey has not enjoyed such possession, nor is it explicitly reserved to her by treaty ; nor, 1 submit, can the “ principle of construction ” quoted page 42 of the memo randum be applied, since another most important sovereign right, that of fortifying Persian bank, was expressly admitted to rest reciprocally with Persia, in the Turkish note regarding fortifications at Fao, enclosed in despatch/lated 12th August 1888. Such forts existed in 1857 on the Persian bank of the entrance of the Karan into the Shat-ef-Arab. Again, not only Persian merchant vessels but also her men-of-war have habitually enjoyed the use of the river and exercised police rights there. F am not aware of any evidence that Persians could not navigate river without being liable to Turkish dues, as stated at page 42 of memorandum. On the whole, however, I am of opinion, provided we can secure adherence to the mid-channel line for old established purpose such as jurisdiction over islands, responsible police arrangements, and exercise of fishing rights, Persian Government will have no reason to interest them selves, and we might then agree to the proposed Turkish Commission, our own representative on the board being explicitly permitted to represent Sheikh of Mohammerah’s interest.

X., Appendix, pa&lt;Te 1 y, Third Edition.” “/Translation of Articles of Agreement concluded at Erzeroum and signed by the Turco-Persian Commissioners on 31st May 1847 :— “ Article 2.—The town and port of Mohammerah and the Island of Khizr with the anchorage, as well as so much of the Eastern bank of the Shat-el-Arab as is occupied by tribes confessedly belonging to Persia, are to remain in the possession of Persia, besides which, Persians will enjoy the complete liberty of navigating the Shat-el-Arab from its mouth to the point of contact of the two frontiers. Soolumaneeyeh Avill remain in the possession of Turkey. In regard to Nohab, the Persian Government settles that all the mountainous portion with the pass of Kerrond on its eastern part will be retained by it, and the plain of Nohab, which forms the western portion, will be given over to Turkey.” Fao is a village on the west (Turkish) bank of the Shat-el-Arab, and is thus described in Findlay’s Directory for the Navigation of the IndianOcean. (Persian Gulf, Chapter XIII., p. 712.) “ Passage up the river to Basrah. “ After entering between the regular banks with vegetation, the eye is the chief guide. The southernmost part of these banks is quite swampy, all of soft alluvial mud, thickly grown with weeds and coarse grass. It is almost impossible to land, so soft is the mud. The first date grove is on the west bank, about four miles from Has al Bisheh; and there is a small village called Fao or Fau in it. The direction of the river is N.W. from the mouth, until past the south end of Kusbeh Grove, when it turns to N. ^ E. for about four miles. “ The Electric Telegraph Cable, as before stated, is landed at Fao from Bushire. It is not a station, but the line is continued on to Basrah, and thence along the course of the great rivers, through Asia Minor to Constantinople and the European system.” 2. The eastern bank of the Sliat-el-Arab is Persian territory, and under the terms of the Articles of Agreement* concluded at Erzeroum in 1847, the Persians enjoy the right of navigating the Shat-el- Arab from its mouth to the point of contact of the two frontiers. I Letter from Foreign Office, 16th April 1887. H, C., Yol. 93, page 825. 3. In May 1883 the Officiating Political Agent and Consul at Basrah mentioned, among items of intelligence, that the Commander-in-Chief of the Bagdad Corps d’Armee, accompanied by the Com modore, the Mutessarif of Basrah and other officials, had paid a visit to Fao, “ where it is rumoured the “ Turkish Government desires to build a fort or “ a lighthouse.” In subsequent reports it was stated that,— “ The Commander-in-Chief came down to Fao to fix on a fcire for a lighthouse which is to be erected there, and to arrange about a light-buoy to be placed at the bar, to enable ships to enter the river during dark nights. # # # # # “ The Pasha visited Fao at the end of April in a small river steamer. He steamed past Fao some two miles and back again. He did not land lower down, and could not have decided on anything there. He arrived at Fao about noon, landed, and with his staff, was the whole time at the Telegraph Station, and nearly S. 19. A &amp;the whole time with me either rifle shooting or talking. He spoke of improvements, and I suggested that he should drain and fill in the swamp at the back of the godown ; he promised, but has not done so. Nothing was said about building anything, and there is not the slightest rumour of any such intention. Some thousands of building stones were ordered from Bushire, but were expressly to be shipped to Basrah. The Pasha dined with me, and not a word was said about Fao. Some years ago it was proposed to build a small round fort at back of trees, but Sheikh (of Koweit) asked, ‘ What for, there was no necessity,’ and so the idea dropped. This was some six years ago.” 4. Thus the matter rested till 16th December 1885, when the Basrah Consul, Lieutenant-Colonel Mockler, reported that, during a conversation with Admiral Ali Itiza Pasha, Governor-General of Basrah, it had come out that the Ottoman Government contemplated building a large fort at Pao at a cost of 93,000/. 5. In 1886, the following further information was supplied by Her Majesty’s Consul at Basrah.— “ 1 st May.—Orders have been received from the Porte to erect fortifications at Fao at a cost of 180,000/., to be contributed as required from the Pashaliks of Basrah and Bagdad. “17th May.—One hundred and sixty soldiers, under the com mand of Major Kamal Bey, have arrived at Fao with a quantity of building materials for the purpose of commencing the fortifications there. Kamal Bey took a simple letter of introduction from the Wali of Basrah to the Sheikhs of Koweit, who are the proprietors of Fao. The letter did not mention the project of constructing fortifications, or ask for the grant of a site, or offer to purchase one. On arrival Kamal Bey marked out a large extent of river frontage, about 50 acres, which he said would be needful for the fortifications, and summoned all persons owning boats at Fao to meet him. He told them that their boats would be required to convey earth from El Dora, some miles up the river, to the fortifications, and asked them what hire they would want. They replied 20 piastres for 2 tons. He told them he would give 8 piastres for 2 tons, and that, if they did not accept it, their boats would be seized and used without any payment. The Sheikhs of Koweit strongly resent the seizure of their land, which is valuable, and purpose petitioning the Porte against it. “ 26th May.—Mohammed el Sabbah, one of the Koweit Sheikhs, arrived at Basrah to protest against the construction of forti fications on their property at Fao without their consent or compensation being made to them. “ 29th May.—The Wali returned from Fao. He and Sheikh Mohammed el Sabbah failed to come to an understanding about the ground taken for the fortifications, and the latter is petitioning the Porte. ° “ 13th November.—Admiral Ali Riza Pasha, in company with Rafat Pasha, who came down from Bagdad, went in the Turkish river steamer £ Furat ’ to Fao to inspect construction of forts there.” 6 . Pending the receipt of further intelligence, the Secretary of State lor Foreign Ailairs inquired on the 16th April 1887, whether, in the opinion of Viscount Cross, it would not he desirable that Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran should be instructed to call the attention of the Persian Government to the matter, and to suggest that they should ascertain whether the fortifica tions were of a nature which would enable the Turks to obstruct the navigation of the Shat-el-Arab. If sucli should prove to be the case,3 Mr. Nicolson might be authorised to state that Her Majesty’s Government would be ready to support the representations which the Persian Government would no doubt think it necessary to make at Constantinople on the subject. Viscount Cross concurred in the proposal looking to the importance in the interests of Persia of maintaining free access to Mohammerah from the Persian Gulf. At this time the project for opening up the Karun river and constructing a railway from Ahwaz to Teheran was under consideration. The construction of a fort at Pao was consequently a measure hostile both to British and to Persian interests. Instructions in this sense were accordingly sent to Mr. Mcolson on the 3rd May 1887. Letter from Foreign Office, 13th June 1887. H. C., Vol. 94, p. 1557. 7. The Shah having inquired what was the best mode of proceeding, Mr. Nicolson suggested that the matter should be referred to the Persian Am bassador at Constantinople, who could confer with Sir W. White. The Poreign Office, however, telegraphed to Mr. Nicolson on the 13th June that it appeared that, in the event of the Skat-el-Arab being closed, navigation to Mohammerah would still be open by the Bamishir. In view of this, and of the Treaty engagements of the Porte to Persia, it might be unnecessary to raise the question at Constantinople. It was subsequently ascertained that the Bamishir channel was full of sand-banks and shallows, and, in fact, impracticable. The fortifications at this time were not of a very formidable kind, and the Poreign Office considered it not “ worth while to make a fuss about the fort under the circumstances.” Letter from Foreign Office, dated 6 th August 1887. H. C., Vol, 96, p. 467. 8 . Before Sir W. White had received the instruc tions sent to him on the 20th July to support the protest of the Shah’s Ambassador at Constantinople, he had mentioned that Mohsin Khan had been for some time consulting him on the subject of repre sentations to the Sublime Porte regarding the construction of fortifications at Pao, but, as the Ambassador had very little knowledge of the subject, Sir W. White could not give him much assistance, having received no instructions from the Poreign Office. He had, however, urged Mohsin Khan, who was a personal favourite with the Sultan and was about to have an audience with him, to speak to His Imperial Majesty and obtain an Irade to stop the works to which liis Government objected. On learning the above, Lord Cross observed that, according to the reports of Colonel Murdoch Smith, the projected fortifications were of a nature to enable the Turkish authorities to obstruct the free navigation of the Shat-el-Arab between Moham merah and the sea, and it was very possible that this might lead to works of a similar nature being constructed by the Persian Government on theopposite bank of the river—a not altogether desirable result, considering the great importance of this route in connection with British Indian trade. Lord Cross was, therefore, glad to learn that instructions had been sent to Her Majesty s representative at Constantinople to suppoi ie protest which the Persian Ambassador was preparing to address to the Sublime Porte ; hut suggested, for Lord Salisbury s consideration, whether it might not he desirable that supple- mentary instructions should be issued to kir YV. White, directing His Excellency, without awaiting the result of any personal representations which Mohsin Khan might make to the buitau, to formally intimate to the Turkish Ministers that Her Majesty’s Government could not view with indifference the action taken by the Ottoman Government in this matter. , Instructions to this effect were accordingly issued to Sir W. White on the 21st August. 9 . His representations were not well received ^by the Porte as appears from his report of the 25th August, which is as follows :— “ Said Pasha (Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs) to whom the subject appeared to be very distasteful, observed with much animation, if not irritation, that he did not see on what grounds the two Governments, the British and the Persian, could fairly dispute the right of a great independent State to erect forts or fortifications on its own territory, adding at the same time that the fort in question, which was but a very insignificant one, was not at all intended to interfere with the free trade and navigation of the river. “ Said Pasha concluded the conversation by stating that he had also been spoken to by the Persian Charge d’Affaires who had invoked in support of his representations the Treaty of Erzeroum of 1847 which he (Said Pasha) wished now to consult together with any other documents which might exist at the Porte, before entering into any further discussion on the subject with the Persian Embassy.” 10. Ill consequence of this denial by the Porte of the right of Her Majesty’s Government or even of the Persian Government to object to the con struction of a fort at Eao, and of the Turkish contention that it could not he considered as interfering with the free navigation of the Shat-el- Arah, the Eoreign Office sent to Sir W. White “ copies of two memoranda relative to the nego- “ tiations connected with the Treaty of Erzeroum “ in 1847,” and stated that the contention of the Turkish Minister for Eoreign Affairs was in direct contradiction with the view held by the Porte in 1847. “ At the time when the Treaty was drafted by the British and Russian Commissioners, who acted as mediators, the Turkish Government objected to the relinquishment to Persia of the Island of El Khyzr, on which a portion of the town of Mohammerah is situated, and only withdrew their objections on the condition that no fortifications should be erected on the Island or at any point Avhere they could interfere with the free navigation of the river. “ In March 1848, the Turkish Government submitted to the British Commissioner a proposal for an addition to Article 2 of the Treaty, which they desired should be inserted in the Acts of Ratification. r Letter from Foreign Office, 5th September 1887. Letter from Foreign Office, 9th September 1887. II. C., Vol. 97, page 143,5 The clause in^ question contained a formal engagement on the part of the Persian and Turkish Governments reciprocally to abstain from erecting fortifications on the banks of the Shat-el- Arab in their respective possessions. . Turkish negotiators consented to sign the treaty in its original form on receiving an assurance from the British and Russian Commissioners that the wishes of the Porte on these and other points would be supported at Teheran. With some difficulty the British Minister at Teheran obtained the consent of the Shah to this condition as to the non-erection of fortifications, and still uither pressure had to be used by the British and Russian Ambassadors at Constantinople before a formal assurance could be obtained from the Persian Ambassador on the subject. “A copy of this Declaration was annexed to a joint Note addressed to the Porte by the British and Russian Ambassadors on the 26th February (9th March) 1848, and on its receipt the Porte consented to the ratification of the Treaty, which took place on the 21st of March following. “ It follows from the above facts, which are detailed at 'renter length in the Memorandum which forms the second enclosure of this Despatch, that the Turkish and Persian Governments stand mutually pledged to one another to abstain from fortifying on either side the banks of the Shat-el-Arab, and that Great Britain and Russia, who were the means of obtaining for the Porte this engagement from the Persian Government, have a direct interest and right to watch over its faithful observance by the contracting party, on whose behalf they intervened at the time. “ 14 is Possible that the Minister for Foreign Affairs may be unaware of these facts. Or he may, perhaps, argue that, the engagement being a reciprocal one, the Turkish Government have the option of departing from it, with no other consequence than that ol leaving the other party free to do the same. Her Majesty’s Government cannot admit, in view of the history of the nego tiation, that such a contention is valid in international law, or that the Porte can tree itself from the engagement which it took to the British and Russian mediators, as well as to the Persian Govern ment, without previous arrangement with them. “ And, setting the legal question aside, Her Majesty’s Govern ment, being interested in the integrity both of Persia and the Ottoman Empire, and having regard to the fact that British subjects are largely interested both in the trade of Basrah and Mohammerah, would greatly regret the construction of opposing fortifications on either bank of the river, which must constitute a menace to its peaceful navigation, and might, under certain circumstances become a source of danger to the maintenance of good relations between the two countries or between either of them and Great Britain.” Enclosure in above. Memorandum on the Negotiations respecting the erection of fortifications on the Shat-el-Arab, in connection with the Ireaty of Erzeroum in 1847. It appears that, when the Treaty of Erzeroum was drafted by the mediating Commissioners (British and Russian) the Porte at first objected to the relinquishment to Persia of the island of El Khyzr, upon which a portion of the town of Mohammerah is situated. j-xicy Ultimately witnurew tneir objections, on the conditi however, that no fortifications should be erected on the island at any point where they would interfere with the free navfrat ot the river by Ottoman merchant ships. ° “ Mr. Wellesley, in reporting this, observed that if the Po were willing to make this condition reciprocal, and that if tl would engage to erect no'fortifications on the right bank of i Shat-el-Arab, this need not be considered a difficulty. “ The Persian Government had already accepted the Co missionors’ Draft Treaty. “ 0n 17th February 1847, Mr. Wellesley sent home Memorandum presented by him and his Russian colleague to t I urkish Government. It contained assurances relative to thi points in connection with the Treaty, which they understood tl Government to require. They related,-— S. 19. ‘ B k6 “ ( 1 ) to the definition of the term ‘ anchorage of Moham- merah ’; “ ( 2 ) to the divisions of the tribes and territory occupied by them, &amp;c., mentioned in Article 2 of the Treaty; “ (3) To Government and individual claims. “ Nothing was said as to fortifications ; but in March 184:7 the Turkish Government submitted to Mr. Wellesley _ (with other clauses) an additional clause to Article 2, respecting the non- erection of fortifications by Persia on the left bank of the Shat- el-Arab, or by Turkey on the right bank, which they desired should be inserted in the Acts of Ratification. “ The text of this proposed clause was as follows :— “ ‘ Attendu seulement que 1’illustre cour de Perse s’engage ici formellement a ce que jamais il ne soit construit des forti fications d’aucune espece sur ceux des endroits situes sur la rive gauche du Shat-el-Arab qui, comme il est dit plus haut, doivent rester en la possession de la Perse, la Sublime^ Porte s’engage de son cote aussi a ne construire aucune espece de fortifications sur les cotes de ses terres situes sur la rive droite du fleuve susdit, qui sont vis-a-vis des endroits sus- mentionnes.’ “ Assurances were thereupon given by the British and Russian Ambassadors at Constantinople that the wishes of the Porte would be supported at Teheran. “ The Porte then agreed to the signature of the Treaty as originally drafted; at the same time stating that unless Persia agreed to the assurances given by Great Britain and Russia on the various points raised, Turkey would not ratify the Treaty. “ The Treaty was signed on the 31st May 1847 in the presence of Colonel Williams and Colonel Oairese, the British and Russian mediating Commissioners, and the signature was recorded in a Proces Verbal signed by Colonel Williams. “ The Persian Government at first refused to have anything to do with the assurances given by the British and Russian Representatives at Constantinople, but eventually the Shah informed Colonel Sheil (with reference to the question of the fortifications) that he was willing to declare that, so long as Turkey refrained from fortifying the portion of the Shat-el-Arab opposite to Persia, he would abstain from fortifying the Persian branch. “ When the Persian ratifications of the Treaty arrived at Constantinople, the Persian Ambassador refused to give his adhesion to the assurances given by the British and Russian Ambassadors to the Porte previous to the signature of the Treaty, but after great pressure had been put upon him by the two Ambassadors.—Lord Cowley threatening to break off relations with him,—he signed his adhesion to them, receiving from them in return an assurance that the requirement relating to the forti fications did not include the existing fortifications at Mohammerah. “ The Porte appearing inclined to delay the ratification of the Treaty, the British and Russian Ambassadors sent in to them a Note recapitulating the assurauces previously given by them, to which was annexed a copy of the Persian Ambassador’s declaration alluded to above. “ The ratifications of the Treaty were then exchanged on the 21st March 1848, in the presence of the British and Russian Ambassadors, and the exchange was recorded in a Protocol signed by the Turkish and Persian Plenipotentiaries and by the Am bassadors of the two mediating Powers—Great Britain and Russia. “ It will be seen from this memorandum that although no stipulation with regard to fortifications on the Shat-el-Arab was inserted in the Treaty of Erzeroum (which, however, contained a clause securing to Persia the free navigation of that river), yet the Porte required that such a clause should be added to the ratifications; “ That the Porte, however, ultimately signed the Treaty on receiving from the mediating Powers assurances on the subject (among others) of the non-construction of fortifications* ; “ That the mediating Powers, after great difficulty, obtained from the Persian Plenipotentiary his adhesion to these assurances in the form of a declaration or note; * Namely, that the wishes of the Porte should be supported at Teheran.7 “ And that on this adhesion being communicated to the Porte by the mediating Powers, the ratifications were exchanged ; the mediating Powers being parties to the exchange, and signing the Protocol in which it was recorded.” Turkish Contention. Condition on which it may construct fort. Letter from Foreign Office, 20 th January 1888. H. C., Vol. S9, p. 483. 11. In answer to the above Memoranda the Porte rejoined that it had the right of constructing the Pao Ports (sic), subject to no other consequence than that of conceding a similar right to the Persian Government. “ Pro Memoria, dated 29th December 1887. . Le Traite d Erzeroum de 1848 ne contient aucune clause ayant trait aux fortifications des deux rives du Schatt-el-Arab. Le seul engagement pris porte qu’aussi longtemps que la Turquie ne batira point de fortifications sur la rive droite de ce fleuve, situee vis-a-vis du territoire Persan, la Perse de son cote’ s abstiendra d en construire sur la partie de la rive gauche qui lui revient selon les dispositions du traite. “ II s’en suit que si le Gouvernement Imperial eleve des forti fications sur ladite rive, le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste le Schah se trouve evidemment delie lui-meme de son engagement. &lt;£ Cette maniere de voir est conforme d’ailleurs a la note collective remise a la Sublime Porte a la date du 9 Mars 1848 par ies Ambassadeurs de Russie et d’Angleterre. “ La stipulation susvisee etant falcultative pour le Gouverne ment Imperial, qui ne s’est jamais engage a ne pas elever des fortifications dans les parages en question, il n’y a eu de sa part aucune derogation qui puisse justiher les observations du Gouvernement de Sa Majeste le Schah. “ Tel les sont les considerations que le pro memoria remis par 1 Ambassade de Sa Majeste la Reine le 21 Septembre dernier a suggerees a la Sublime Porte, et tout en appreciant 1’esprit amical qui a diets sa demarche, le Gouvernement Imperial demeure persuade que dans son jugement eclaire le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste Britannique en reconnaitra lui-meme la justesse.” 12 . In forwarding this rejoinder Sir W. White wrote ( 2 nd January 1888) as follows :— “ jour Lordship is aware, the Minister for Foreign Affairs was very much inclined to resent any attempt at interference on our part, and although I am aware of the views of Her Majesty’s Government, I am reluctant to continue a controversial corre spondence with the Porte without positive instructions from your Lordship. J “ The chief difficulties in my way are :— (1.) The length of time the works have been carried on without giving rise to any spontaneous protest on the part of the Persian Government. “ (2.) The hopelessness, so far as I have the means of judging, of obtaining any support from our co-mediator, Russia. “ (3-) The Government of Persia never moved or showed any interest in this question till it was taken up by us, and appeared indifferent; the Ambassador has been kept “ an courant ” by me of every step taken, and Llis Excellency s intex-est has been lately considex-ably awakened by instructions from Teheran.” ^ 13. It appeared to Lord Salisbury that Her Majesty’s Government had grounds for complaining of the action of the Porte, who, having in 1847 made use of the intervention of Her Majesty’s Government to obtain the consent of Persia to a reciprocal engagement that neither party should erect forti fications on the hanks of the Shat-ei-Arab, had then, without giving notice of the termination of this agreement, proceeded to build a fort which Her Majesty’s Government had only become aware of from reports from the Agent of the Indo- European Telegraph Company there, and from Her Majesty’s Consul at Basrah.8 14. But it could scarcely be said, as a matter of strict international right, that Her Majesty’s Government were in a position to claim that the fort should he demolished or abandoned, and as the Porte was almost certain to suspect some hidden design if the British Government took too prominent a part in the discussion, Lord Salisbury proposed to instruct Sir W. White to drop the controversy until the Persian Government took the matter up. Meanwhile the construction of the fort was progressing. The earthworks of the enceinte were completed, a high inner rampart wall and quarters for the garrison were begun, and guns were expected from Constantinople. 15. In January 1888, the Persian Ambassador presented a note to the Porte, in which he protested against the erection of a fort at Pao as being contrary to the Treaty engagements, and demanded its demolition. Sir W. White was authorized to give his Persian colleague such support in the matter as he thought judicious. 16. In that year the Government of India forwarded a Beport by Colonel M. S. Bell, on the position of the Pao Port and the effect of the entrance to the Karun being commanded by it, from which the following extracts are taken :— “ The fort being constructed at Fao is a fleurd’eau on the right bank of the river Shat-ul-Arab, 6,800 yards below the Fao telegraph buildings, three miles above the Fao inner buoy, and over 30 miles from Muhammerah. “ On the river side is a parapet 4' high and 6 ^' thick at the level of the crest. It is said that a high inner rampart and quarters for its garrison of brick are being built. “ Half a mile below the fort the channel narrows, and the deepest water is on the Turkish side. The width of river at fort is 1,500 yards. The front face of the fort measures 673', rear face 787', side faces 626'; along front face, seven heavy guns can be mounted to fire straight across the channel ; along the down stream side face, six heavy guns can be brought to bear upon the channel. At high tides the river washes the front face of the work (tide recedes 250 yards at low-water). On either side are creeks 90 and 60 yards wide respectively; to the rear, at a distance of 2,000 yards, is a bund or sea wall, behind which lies an extensive mud flat at times covered at high-water; the ground to the rear of the fort can be inundated. It is supposed that 13 guns (12-ton) placed as noted will be mounted in the fort. The position is strong against a land attack, and if it be armed as stated, will be too strong for our Persian Gulf gun-boats. It commands the main river channel across and down-stream as already noted.” “ The description given of the Shat-ul-Arab from the bar to Muhammerah will serve to indicate that the fort is not built as an express menace to the town of Muhammerah, and therefore as a direct menace to Persia. It is 30 miles below Muhammerah. “ This it was meant to point out by Intelligence Branch notes on the case of 23rd September and 19th October. By them it was desired to indicate that the menace was thought to be primarily directed against Great Britain and not Persia, i.e. y that it was a continuation by the Turks of their hitherto fruitless endeavours to get the river traffic into their own hands, and to compel the withdrawal of Lynch’s boats from the Tigris ; a river which the Turks hold that British boats have no right to navigate, permission having been given by them to navigate the Euphrates and not the Tigris. “ The diplomatic history of this disagreement is not in this office, and I refer to it as the cause of the building of the fort only Persia protests against erection of fort.

Vol. 102, p. 1293.) as the generally received opinion in local unofficial circles. Its construction can, I think, have but one object, i.e., that stated above and apparently well known, and an opinion which is strengthened when taken in conjunction with the threat of the Turkish Admiral at Basrah some few years ago to fire upon Lynch’s river boats, a threat which he was only dissuaded from carrying out apparently by the astuteness of Captain Ramsay, then Political Officer at Basrah, who pointed out to him the anomaly of the Wali of Baghdad ordering him to blow the river steamers out of the water when it was equally in his own power to have done so himself at Baghdad. The consideration that Turkey is a bankrupt nation and its Mesopotamian walayats in want of funds but (sic) confirm this opinion. “ Doubtless on the first favourable opportunity the Turks will again call in question Britain’s right to navigate the Tigris, and endeavour to enforce their opinion by blocking access to it even as low down as Fao.” 17. In transmitting tins report the Government of India wrote,— “ Your Lordship will observe that the Fort commands the main channel of the Shat-ul-Arab, and will enable the Turks to block, at least temporarily, all access to the Tigris. It will further give to the Turks the command of the traffic to Muhammerah, and thereby control British trade with Mesopotamia and Arabistan. “ We are of opinion that the erection of the Fort is prejudicial to British interests ; and if Her Majesty’s Government do not feel themselves in a position to demand that it should be demolished or abandoned, we would at least recommend that strong support should be given to any similar demands made by the Government of His Majesty the Shah of Persia.” 18. And Lord Cross, in forwarding this communi cation to the Foreign Office, expressed doubts whether— “ in existing circumstances diplomatic protests on the part of the Shah against the construction of this fort would be effectual even if supported by Her Majesty’s Government, but if the Marquis of {Salisbury should deem it opportune to press the Persian Government to take active steps at Constantinople with the object of inducing the Sultan to abandon the construction of this fort as menacing the approach to the Persian town of Mohammerah, Lord Cross would entirely concur in such a course.” 19. It appeared to Lord Salisbury impossible to allow the construction of the fort to be persisted in without serious remonstrance and a warning of the manner in which it was regarded by Her Majesty’s Government Sir W. White was accordingly authorised to present the following Memorandum to the Porte, and, if he thought it desirable, to take measures to bring its contents to the know ledge of the Sultan. Lather than leave the matter to be discussed by the Persian Government and to support their representations, the Marquis of SaHs- bury thought it desirable to remonstrate again directly with the Porte. II. C., Vol. 102, p. 1139. “ Memorandum. “ Her Majesty’s Government desire a^ain to call the serious attention of the Sublime Porte to the objections which they have already urged to the erection of a fort at the mouth of the Shat-el- Arab, near Fao. “ According to the latest accounts which have reached them, this fort has now nearly been completed, and is so placed as to command the deepest part of the channel, so that when armed it will have the power of completely closing the navigation for sea going merchant vessels to Basrah and Mohammerah. The treaty between Turkey and Persia, signed at Erzeroum on the 19/31st May 1847, contains in Article II. the following engagement on the S. 19. Gm n JO part of tke Sublime Porte:—‘Outre cela, los navires Persans ‘ auront le droit de naviguer en pleine liberte sur le Schatt- ‘ el-Arab, depuis 1’endroit ou ce fleuve se jette dans la mer * jusqu’au point de contact des frontieres des deux parties.’ “But before consenting to ratify the treaty, the Turkish Ministers required certain further assurances from the Persian Gorernment, one of which was to the effect that neither party should erect any fortifications on the banks of the Shat-ul-Arab where the possessions of the tjvo Mates were opposite to one another. These assurances were obtained with great difficulty by the exertions of the British and Russian Representatives at Teheran. The Turkish Ministers desired that the assurances should be confirmed by Great Britain and Russia as the mediatory Powers, and to satisfy this desire a joint Note was addressed to the Sublime Porte by the British and Russian Representatives at Constantinople on the 26th February (9th March) 1848, which contains the following passage:— “ ‘ La declaration de 1’Envoye Persan enonce enfin, quant a la defense reciproque de batir des fortifications sur les cotes du Shatt-ul-Arab oil les possessions des deux Etats se trouvent opposees les unes aux autres, une resolution du Schah, pleinement conforme an desir exprime par la Sublime Porte et appuye a Teheran par les bons offices des deux Representants mediateurs, c’est-a-dire que le Schah consent a ce qu’aussi longtemps que la Turquie ne batira point de fortifications sur la rive droite du Shatt-ul-Arab, situee vis-a-vis du territoire Persan, la Perse a son tour s’abstiendra d’en construire sur la partie de la rive gauche qui lui revient selon les stipulations du Traite.’ “ Having been thus instrumental in obtaining this reciprocal engagement, and having themselves confirmed and endorsed it at the express wish of the Turkish negotiators, Her Majesty’s Government consider that they were entitled to expect on grounds of courtesy, and indeed of international obligation, some previous announcement from the Sublime Porte of its intention to depart from the arrangement. “It has been argued by the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs that the erection of this fort is not a breach of any absolute engagement, but that the effect of this measure is merely to leave the Persian Government free to erect similar fortifications on its side of the river. It is undoubtedly true that the Persian Govern ment have the means of erecting fortifications on the left bank of the river in their possession which would obstruct completely the navigation of the river upwards toward the Tigris and Euphrates. And for any power which desired to see Turkey and Persia in antagonism, or to make use of Persian assistance or Persian tenitory in furtherance of aggressive designs against the Ottoman Empire, such a solution would not be an unsatisfactory one. 7 “ But Great Britain has no such designs; her interest is in the peaceful development of trade with the districts on the banks of the Shatt-el-Arab and of the several rivers which debouch into it and in fact by far the largest proportion of sea-going vessels which ascend the river to Basrah and Mohammerah are under the British flag. “ Her Majesty’s Government are not aware of any circumstances in the present relations between Turkey and Persia which can be held to call for the construction of the fort at Fao as a measure of necessary precaution, and according to the reports which have reached them, the fort is so situated as to coustitute in the existing state of things, a menace, not so much to Persia as to the British commerce frequenting the river. “ Her Majesty’s Government cannot therefore regard the con struction of the fort as undertaken otherwise than with a view to possible hostile action against British interests. They trust that the Sublime Porte may be induced, on reconsideration, to ^ive orders for its demolition or abandonment. But they think it rfoht to warn the Sublime Porte distinctly and emphatically that if the fort is completed and steps are taken towards arming it, they will regard this action as one of hostile preparation which they will be entitled to resent and to take the necessary measures for counteracting.” 20 .

On receipt of these instructions, Sir W. White wrote:— “I got a Turkish translation carefully made of the said Memorandum, a copy of which I instructed Sir A. Sandison to deliver to the Grand \izier. “ Hls Highness, after having taken some days to study it, expressed, I am sorry to say, subsequently, an opinion less favour able to our demand than the one he has stated on previous occasions • whilst the Minister for Foreign Affairs had become in the mean time more open to entertain these (objections ?) on our part especially on learning the serious consequences of a refusal on the part oi the Imperial Government. I continued to urge on the Grand Vizier the representations 1 was instructed to make by your Lordship, when I suddenly that thls controversy so uselessly raised by the Turkish VYar Department had reached the Sultan’s ears. ‘ His Majesty t ion gave orders that all the documents should be submitted to himself pending any further decision, and the Turkish Minister tor foreign Affairs declared himself unable to do anything before receiving his Imperial Majesty’s commands. • ‘‘ 0l ! t l U! 9th in stant I forwarded to the Sultan’s First Secretary, m lurkish, a copy of the above-named Memorandum, and also of the 1 ersian Note addressed to my predecessor and to the Eussian Ambassador on the 31st January 1848, as bearing upon this point, so as to leave no doubt whatever in the Imperial mind of the importance of his decision as affecting the future relations of England and Turkey. 'i dncstion of Massowah and financial complications may probably have occasioned His Imperial Majesty to delay studying the subject, and I propose immediately after the Bairam holidays to resume urgently pressing this question. “ I cannot, however, refrain from stating to your Lordship very confidentially that M. de Nelidoff has been working in a sense hostile to our demands, both at the Palace with the War Minister and even indirectly with the Persian Ambassador. ‘ I beg likewise to forward to your Lordship translations of a Note addressed by the Porte on the 31st ultimo to the Persian Ambassador here, and of an article which appeared in the £ Tarik ’ newspaper of the 2 nd instant, with reference to this question' and which both show sufficiently the animus which inspires them and the obstacles with which we have to contend.” Turkish attitude on the Fao question. I i “ Copy of a Note addressed by the Turkish Foreign Office to &gt; 1 the Persian Embassy. ‘ “ We have perused your Note of reply stating that the con struction of fortifications at Fao is contrary to the decision arrived at when the Treaty of Erzeroum was concluded, viz that no fortifications should be made on the banks of the Shat-el-Arab and declaring that any modification of this decision must be subject to the consent of the mediating Powers. It is needless* to explain that the agreement arrived at on this subject was not a reciprocal undertaking, but Turkey at that time in her own interests reserved to her own initiation the right of constructing fortifications on those banks, and brought about the engagement that so long as Turkey should not fortify the right bank °of the river, Persia should abstain from building forts on her (the left) bank. Now that Turkey has had forts made, Persia is released from her engagement, and is also free to construct forts on her own ground and has no right to object. And this agreement being between the two Governments, there is no kind ob’eno-aa-e-. ment vis-a-vis the mediating Powers, and the two Governments aforesaid are not dependent on their consent, and the construction of these works is no violation of any treaty between the two countries.” Translation, “‘Tarik,’ Thursday, 2 nd August 1888. “ I he ‘Tarik,’ referring to the statement which appeared in the &lt; Standard ’ that England had made representations to Turkey with regard to fortifications which are being constructed at the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab by the 6 th Army Corps, remarks that it has no official information on the subject, but that it considers the statement in question as to the construction of important forts at that point must be exaggerated.Should it, however, be correct, the question of how such d step is a violation of any treaty between Turkey and Persia surely belongs to those two countries to decide, and England’s interference in the matter, while causing surprise, can only be explained on the supposition that she is seeking to acquire influence on the Shat-el-Arab and in the Gulf of Basrah, a proceeding which is, however, contrary to England s established policy.” 22. The Turkish Ambassador, haying made no communication to the Foreign Office respecting Fao, was asked if he had instructions to present a Memorandum on the subject. He said that he had no formal instructions, hut had been privately told to give explanations and assurances to Her Majesty’s Government. They were to the effect that the intentions of the Porte were far from being hostile to any one, and that there would be no interference with the navigation of the Shat-el-Arab. But His Excellency could give no explanation of the object with which the fort was being built. Rustem Pasha was warned that unless an assurance that the works were stopped was given to Her Majesty’s Government, ships from the Zanzibar squadron would be sent up to see what was going on, and that under no circumstances would guns be allowed to be landed at the fort. 23. This action of Her Majesty’s Government caused “ a most painful impression at the Palace, “ and amongst those officials who are cognizant of “ what has taken place.” Confidential inquiries made at this time failed to elicit any information as to the despatch of guns for the armament of the fort. 24. The representations made at Constantinople by the British Ambassador, however, remained without effect, for on the 28th February 1889. Sir W. White wrote:— “ I have come to the conviction that it is a question on which the Ottoman Ministers who constitute the Sublime Porte, with the exception of the Minister for War, are entirely powerless, and that the matter rests with the Sultan with whom are all the papers. “As regards the present Seraskier or Minister for War, it is not unlikely that he has some secret personal interest in these costly constructions. “ As I have some reason to believe that Russian partizans have represented here that in reality the Shah himself entertains no serious objections to these Fao fortifications, but that it is only Great Britain that has some selfish motive to prevent those fortifications, I have been constantly pressing Mohsin Khan, the Persian Ambassador, to urge the Sublime Porte on the subject; and seeing how unavailing all these repeated representations to Ottoman Ministers proved to be, I suggested to my Persian colleague to place in the Sultan’s hands a short Turkish memo randum which I got drawn up for Elis Excellency on the subject, and of which I promised also to send a copy to the E’alace after he had done so. “ After considerable delay His Excellency had the honour of dining with the Sultan on Monday the 25th instant, and got His Imperial Majesty’s permission to send a memorandum on the next day, which he did, and which was followed by an exactly similar memorandum (also in Turkish), given on the next day by Sir r\ * Tetter from Foreign Office, dated 31st October 1888.

Wolff.” “ Memorandum. “ It is clear that the construction of fortifications on the Shat- el-Arab is contrary to the Convention concluded through the mediation of Russia and England at the time of the exchange at Constantinople of the ratifications of the Treaty of Erzeroum dated 21 st March 1848. “ ac ^ on contrary to the provisions of that Convention can be legitimate without the consent of the two signatory Powers of the above-mentioned Treaty, as well as that of the mediating Powers having been obtained. “Now this action, in|opposition to the said Convention, whose provisions are at present in force, has given rise to strong remonstrances on the part of England and Persia, and it is sub mitted that the fact that no attention is yet being paid to these remonstrances cannot naturally serve to maintain the friendly sentiments 'which exist between the two countries.” Letter from Foreign Office, dated 14th 25. Still the works on the fortifications were February 1890. H. C., Vol, 112 , p. 1 185. carried on. Early in 1890 the following intelligence was received:— “ Works on Fao Fort in active progress. Signs of large labour force. Works sufficiently advanced to conceal storage of arms, ammunition and warlike stores. No guns were seen in position, but signs of completion manifest.” * H.C., Vol. 141, p. 1203. 26. In July 1898* it was reported that work had been resumed under Military Engineer officers, and that 80 men were employed, presumably on earthworks, as masons had not been sent from Basrah. Portions of the site were said to have subsided. Renewed remonstrance ad dressed to Porte in 1893. Letter from Foreign Office, dated 29th August 1893. H. 0., Vol. 142, p. 1131. 27. Acting in accordance with instructions from the Foreign Office, Mr. Nicolson, Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Constantinople,— “ called upon the Foreign Minister and left with him a Pro Memoria renewing the remonstrances and warnings formerly made by Her Majesty’s Government in regard to the construction of the Fort at Fao. “ Said Pasha, in accepting the Pro Memoria said that it should not be imagined that the fort was intended as a menace to British commerce, and he could not conceive the possibility of Ottoman guns ever being turned against British merchant ships. I said I presumed the fort was constructed with some object, and I could not think of any other object than the one which had been mentioned in the Pro Memoria. If the fort was constructed without an object, there could be no difficulty at all in ceasing further work upon it. His Excellency said that he would tell me privately, but not as Foreign Minister, that the fort was built solely with the object of putting money into the pockets of the Minister of War, and that he himself would have preferred to see the expenditure laid out more usefully in the defences of the Bosphorus. He begged me not to repeat these observations on his part, as, if they were brought up against him, he would be compelled to deny them. “ Said Pasha is clearly opposed to the continuance of the works at Fao, and it is to be hoped that the Pro Memoria will strengthen his hands in obtaining a definite abandonment of the project, “ Pro Memoria. “ Information has reached Her Majesty’s Embassy that further activity is being shown towards the completion of the works at the Fort at Fao ; and in accordance with instructions from Her Majesty’s Government, Her Majesty’s Embassy desires to call the very serious attention of the Sublime Porte to the above report. Should it be correct that fresh measures are being taken towards S. 19. D14 A completing the construction of the Fort at Fao, Her Majesty’s Embassy must recall to the serious consideration of the Sublime Porte the representations which were formerly made to the Ottoman Government on the subject, and especially to the Memo- ^ randum which was communicated by the late Sir W. White to tlie Grand Vizier in August 1888. Her Majesty’s Embassy desires to review the remonstrances which were set forth at length in that Memorandum against the completion and arming of the Fort at Fao, and to impress strongly on the Sublime Porte the view of Her Majesty’s Government, that this fort will constitute a menace to the British sea-going commerce frequenting the Shat-el-Arab. Her Majesty’s Embassy hopes that the Sublime Porte will give orders for the prompt discontinuance of the work in question; for should the fort be completed, and steps be taken towards arming it, Her Majesty’s Government will regard that action as one of hostile preparation, which they will be entitled to resent, and which they will be justified in taking the necessary measures to counteract.” 28. Her Majesty’s Government continued to press for the discontinuance of the works at Eao. On the 19th November 1893 3 Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople (Sir C. Eord) wrote :— “ I spoke to His Highness (the Grand Vizier) on the subject of the works which were reported to be going on at the Fao forts, and I expressed the hope that the proper instructions might be sent at once to the Turkish Authorities there that they might be discontinued. “ I pointed out to His Highness a fact of which he appeared to have been entirely ignorant, or to have lost sight of, namely, that in the year 1847 an urgent request had been addressed by the Turkish Government to the Mediating Powers, Great Britain and Russia, that as a condition to their ratifying the Treaty of Erzeroum it should be established that the Persian Government should on no account raise fortresses on their side of the Shat- el-Arab river, the prohibition to apply equally to the Turkish Government. “ Before visiting the Grand Vizier I had prepared a short memo randum on the point, which I read to him, and as he expressed a desire to that effect, I have supplied His Highness with a copy of it. “ I likewise enclose herein a copy for your Lordship’s infor mation. The Grand Vizier gave me to understand that orders would be given for the works at the fort to be discontinued.” “In 1847 the Porte were afraid of the Persians erecting forti fications on the Shat-el-Arab, and proposed to Mr. Wellesley to insert in the Treaty of Erzeroum a clause forbidding them to do so, and containing the following declaration :— “ ‘ La Sublime Porte s’engage de son cote aussi de ne construire aucune espece de fortifications sur les cotes de ses terres situees sur la rive droite du fleuve sus-dit qui sont vis-a-vis des endroits susmentionnes.’ “ Ultimately, the Turkish delegates consented to sign th Treaty in its original form, on receiving an assurance that Great Britain and Russia would support the wishes of the Porte at Tehran, but on 3rd (15th) May 1847 a note was sent to Her Majesty’s Embassy, saying that the Porte would only ratify the Treaty on condition that the Persian Court ‘ n’elevera aucune pretention contraire a ces assurances ’ (i.c,, the assurances given by the British and Russian Ambassadors that Persia would not fortify), ‘ et que s’il s’eleve aucune pretention de ce genre le traite conclu sera considere comme nul et non nvenu.’ Accordingly, the British and Russian Ambassadors sent in a Note recapitulating the assurances already given, annexed to which was a declaration by the Persian Ambassador. “ In other words, the Porte only ratified the Treaty on condition that Persia agreed to erect no fortifications, and this condition (as seen by the draft of the article which it was proposed to insert) implied that Turkey agreed to erect no fortifications on the opposite shore.” Letter from Foreign Office, dated 4tli December 1893, Vol. 145, p. 803.16 Letter from Foreign Office, 3 rd January 1894. H. C., Vol. 146, p. 53 . % 29. In November 1893 Her Majesty’s Consul at Basrah reported that the garrison, numbering about 50 men, had been reinforced by 40 men from Basrah. About 30 men were at Abui-Elus engaged in brickmaking. Letter from Foreign Office, 12tli January 1894 , p. 455 . ^ 30. Delay arose in the transmission of orders for the provisional cessation of work, and on in quiry as to its cause the Grand Vizier assured Sir A. Sandison that he had instructed the Minister of War to send the necessary orders, and that he would lose no time in ascertainmg what steps the War Department had taken. On the 24th December 1893, the British Embassy was informed that the Minister for War had sent telegraphic orders a week before direct to the Commandant at Eao to abstain for the time being from any work on the con struction of the fort. Letter from Foreign Office, dated 6 th April 31. Later on the despatch of a British gunboat to 894. H. C., Yol. 148, p. 801. ]^ ao was i u contemplation. Sir P. Currie stated that the Grand Vizier had repeated his belief that no work was in progress, and had asserted positively that no orders had been given from Constantinople for its resumption. As His Highness promised that he would telegraph for information, and if he learnt that work was being carried on he would order its discontinuance by telegraph, Sir P. Currie thought the despatch of a man-of-war might be delayed. Letter from Foreign Office, dated 2 Gth May 1897. H. C., 1931. 32. The British Consular Agent at Eao has recently heard that the Turks contemplate im provements at Eao. Writing on the 9th April, he says: — “ Last night several Turkish military officers arrived here in Sheikh Yusuf’s steam launch, and early this morning pro ceeded to the Fao Fort. So far I have not been able to 'obtain any reliable information as to their intentions, but I hear that the Turks contemplate improvements at the Fort. “ The number of Turkish soldiers at Fao have to some extent increased lately. This may be due to the fact that the Mudir is a military man. This increase does not in any way incommode the Lritish subjects at Fao, and I am glad to inform you that the Turkish Mudir, and the Turks in general, are at all times very friendly and the Mudir does everything in his power to make things pleasant for us.” Actual condition of Fort. 33. The fort seems to have fallen into decay and to be without guns. In a report received here on the 10 th June it is said— Capt. J. A. Douglas’Report* on a Journey from India to the Mediterranean via the Persian Gulf, Baghdad and the Euphrates Valley, chapter “ The Wilayats of Baghdad and Basra,” page 9. “ The fort which the Turks commenced to build at Fao has never been finished, no work having been done on it for the last six or seven years ; the walls which were built are already fallin&lt;&gt;- into disrepair, there are no guns in it, and the garrison consists only of some 30 or 40 men.” * G. 66. 34. Thus it has been shown that despite the Summary. action of the Porte, which in 1848, with the aid of Her Majesty’s Government, obtained the consent of Persia to a reciprocal engagement that neither Power should erect fortifications ou the banks ofk !, V, J . % B W- ; i tlie Shat-el-Arab, and notwithstanding the repeated protests, verbal and written, of the British Government, the Turkish Government has never abandoned the project of constructing a fort at Tao, and at intervals has carried on the works. It is evident from the above narrative that measures other than those which have been adopted in the past, and which have failed, will have to be resorted to if any extension of the works at Pao is to be stayed.

Minister for Foreign Affairs explained to me yesterday his point of view. He could not show on a map what he described as status quo. England and Russia had insisted on Treaty of Erzeroum as basis of argument for joint commission. This with notes would give Turkey territory well to east of Mohammerah, and Hague Tribunal would accord this to Turkey if case went there. There was, however, no intention whatever on the part of Turkey to claim this, but if they departed from basis of treaty in this part of frontier it would be impossible to get Persians to adhere to it elsewhere, and whole of foundation of commission would break down. His Excellency’s idea was evidently to keep this as a bargaining fact for some advantage elsewhere. Therefore he asked His Majesty’s Government to lay down what they wanted in that district for their own [? interests], and we could undoubtedly come to terms, but he hoped that we would not depart too much from treaty. I reminded him again that in 1850 various interpretations were given of the [group undecypherable] notes, but he maintained that they were quite clear. It seems to me clear that Turkish pretensions under explanatory notes, whether eventually insisted on or not, will be found to be much the same as those previously put forward by Derviche Pasha.

Elle doit les prouver par des documents historiques. Ln reponse, les delegues iraniens resumerent leurs pensees ainsi qu’il suit:— La question des notes explicatives est terminee et nous avons commence la question de Zohab. Nous ne voulons pas que les histoires et les geographies soient doit etre partagee entre les deux Etats. Or, il est tout naturel partage, il faut d’abord connaitre les frontieres de cette province. “II est hors de doute que les limites de la province de Zohab commencent d’un cote, depuis la riviere Elvind jusqu’a sa jonction avec la riviere Sirvan, et de 1’autre depuis le point de jonction de cette derniere riviere jusqu’a son autre jonction avec la riviere de Semkan. Dans Farticle 2 du dernier traite il est dit que le Gouvernement de Perse s engage a abandonner au Gouvernement ottoman tous les terrains plats, c’est-a-dire les terrains de la partie occidentale de la province de Zohab, et le Gouvernement ottoman s’engage, de son cote, a abandonner au Gouvernement persan la partie orientale c’est-a-dire les terrains montagneux de la province de Zohab avec la vallee de Gherend. “11 ressort des termes qui precedent que la province de Zohab est divisee en deux parties, dont Pune (Poccidentale; est plate et Pautre (Porientale) est montagneuse. La partie occidentale et plate revient a la Turquie, et la partie orientale, c’est-a-dire cede composee de montagnes et de plaines, a la Perse. “ Pour etre plus clair encore, les terrains exclusivement plats situes dans la partie occidentale de la province de Zohab jusqu’au point on commencent les terrains mon- tagneux, appartiennent a la Turquie, et les terrains accidentes composes de plaines et de montagnes situes dans la partie orientale de cette province jusqu’au point oil commence la partie entierement plate, doivent appartenir a la Perse. Du reste, le mot ‘ djebelie,’ qui equivaut au terme frangais de ‘ montagneux,’et dont il a et’e parle 1 ’autre jour, ne pent avoir la signification de montagne, mais bien dune partie de terrain accidente et compose de montagnes et de plaines, tandis qu’au contraire le mot * bessite ’ signifie ‘ etendue de terrain plat ’ depourvu de montagnes. “ II ressort de cette expression qu’il ne pent y avoir de doute au sujet de la partie plate et montagneuse de cette province ; de meme, la division de cette province en plus de deux parties etant contraire a 1 ’esprit du traite, il ressort que si meme la partie montagneuse n’eut ete designee parole mot ‘ djebelie ’ mais par celui de ‘ djebel,’la portion revenant a chacun des deux Etats ne devant pas etre interrompue et les plaines situees entre les deux montagnes n’ayant pas de contiguite avec les terrains entiere ment plats de 1 ’ouest, il est naturel que ces plaines fassent partie des terrains montagneux. Aussi, en examinant avec un peu de som, on comprend bien que Bonkodre, Dakke, Nolle, Hadji Gare, Hanekine, &amp;c., sont a 1’ouest de la province de Zohab et sont des districts importants et productifs, situes dans la partie entierement plate, et entoures et arroses par des canaux et des cours d’eau creuses a droit et a gauche des nvieres Elvind et Sirvan, tels que les canaux Hadji Gare, Baladjou, &amp;c., et de 1 autre cote on comprend aussi bien que tous ceux qui restent pour le Gouvernement persan sont entremeles de grandes montagnes. _ “Consequemment, la ligne frontiere du cote de Mendelitz au point borne par la riviere Llvmd smvant le haut du cours de cette riviere, traverserait le point ou le canal Hadji Gare regoit^ses eaux de cette riviere vers Test, de la colline Hatem Mil, passerait ensuite a droite, s etendrait de la en suivant cette colline jusqu’a la montagne Melle Merde Azema passerait par les sommets des chaines Aghdac, Koutere, Kechkan Sirvan, et traversant le defile de Gounagoun, elle aboutirait a la riviere Sirvan, consideree comme la frontiere septentrionale de la province de Zohab. Elle suivrait ensuite le haut du cours de la riviere Sirvan jusqu’au point appele Zohab Berre ” \ ' /[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] PERSIA.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 68 of the 24th ultimo, I have the honour to forward herewith a despatch from His Majesty’s vice-consul at Van, respecting the presence of Turkish troops on the Persian frontier. Assim Bey has on two occasions informed me that Jabir Pasha would not go to Urmia. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. Vice-Consul Molyneux-Seel to Sir G. Lowiher. (No. 7.) Sir, Van, March 25, 1912. WITH reference to my telegram No. 2, I have the honour to inform your Excellency that Jabir Pasha, commanding 11 th Army Corps, and Jemal Bey, chief of staff, left Van yesterday for Salmas, and thence will probably proceed to Urmia. The extent of their tour will depend on subsequent instructions which they may receive. As stated in my telegram, the Ottoman War Minister informed them that Russia complained of the Turkish troops on the frontier having made a further advance eastwards, and of the Turks being engaged in consolidating their position in the Nevahi-i-Sharkie by the taking of a census of the inhabitants with a view to the election of a parliamentary deputy for these districts. Jabir Pasha, according to his own statement, has been instructed to withdraw immediately any troops which may be found to have advanced beyond the limits occupied by them as ascertained by the British and Russian delegates last summer, and has been given very ample powers to deal with all the matters forming the subject of complaint whether of a military or of a political nature. As regards the advance of the Turkish military posts, the military authorities say that, to their knowledge, the only movement of troops which could be construed into a further advance eastwards is the dispatch of fifty men from the consular guard at Khoi (150 men) to Dilman. They explain that the Ottoman consul residing at Khoi is at the same time consul of Dilman, and that he on his own initiative sent a portion of his guard to Dilman. For this and for any further movements which may be subsequently found to have taken place they are apparently quite willing to find scapegoats in the consul at Khoi and the frontier commissary, Behjet Bey. With regard to a census of the population being taken in the Nevahi-i-Sharkie with the intention of electing a deputy for these districts, there is no doubt of the fact being as stated, and of the Government being cognizant of it. It seems probable that instructions for carrying out the census were sent to the local officials by the Committee of Union and Progress, with the knowledge and approval of the civil authorities at Van. It was hoped that the proceedings would thus escape observation, but in the event of their not doing so and of a protest being made, the Government would be in a position to deny having given their authorisation and to throw the blame on the local officials. The authorities at Van were evidently much perturbed at the receipt of the telegram from the Ottoman War Minister. They consider the matters complained of as trifles which could be set right without difficulty in a few days, and as not by any means justifying the menacing action of Russia in concentrating troops at Alexandropol, the real motive for which they say must be sought elsewhere. The Ottoman authorities here have no details as to the extent of the military preparations at Alexandropol. I am unaware as to whether the Ottoman Government entered into any engagement with the Russian Government to maintain unaltered the political conditions and the [2440 p—U]2 frontier occupied in the disputed territory pending the delimitation of the frontier by a commission, but it would seem that if such was the case, the Turks can justly complain that Russia did not respect the territory occupied by them when they obliged the Turks by force majeure to allow troops to pass from Khoi to Urmia. A third Russian complaint is said to be that the Committee of Union and Progressf* have formed an agreement with the Taschnak Committee based on permission being given for the return of the Taschnak revolutionaries to Persia, and receiving as formerly a monthly salary from the Committee of Union and Progress. Supposing this to be true, it is difficult to see what the Turks could gain by causing a continuance of disorders in Persian territory. Such a state of affairs would mean the continuance of Russian troops in Azerbaijan whose arrival caused the Turks sufficient discontent. It could hardly be argued either that the Turks would accept the withdrawal of Russian troops from Azerbaijan as a reason for their own withdrawal from the contested territories. The Russian supposition that the Turks consider it in their interests to maintain a state of disorder on their Persian frontier appears to me quite untenable. In the past such disorder evidently furnished the Turks with a pretext for the further extension eastwards of the territory occupied by them, but at the present moment Turkey cannot be accused of having any such intentions, as she is sufficiently occupied with maintaining the tranquillity of the Kurds in the frontier area already in her possession. Simko, of Kotur, recently made another raid on Turkish territory, carrying off several thousand sheep. Between Chari and Mawana, the Kardash, Dalan, and Finik tribes, sub-divisions of the Somai Shekaks give trouble. Other restless tribes are the Hinara Ashiret, south of Mawana, the Begzadi and sedentary Heriki around Tergavar and Mergavar, and the Zerza Ashiret around Ushnu. These tribes, according to the Turks, being uncertain where their best interests lie pursue a double-faced policy. They are in doubt as to whether they are to remain Ottoman subjects or about to come under Russian control. Hence they remain in a state of unrest, and the Turks are fully occupied in endeavouring to keep them under their influence. I have, &amp;c. L.

Consul Stevens to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 15.) (No. 8 .) Sir, Batoum, March 31, 1912. WHILST reporting the passage through Batoum, in two batches, on the 28th instant and again this' morning of the recently appointed Turkish commissioner and his staff to enquire into existing conditions on the Turco-Persian frontier, who left here by rail for Tiflis and are thence to travel to Urmia, I have the honour to inform you that the Russian Government do not apparently intend to mitigate the military measures which have been in course of progress in the Caucasus for the past six or seven weeks. , _ . , rp n The immediate cause of the recent strained relations between Russia and 1 mkey would seem to have been removed by the appointment of the commission, and the threatened mobilisation of the army of the Caucasus has apparently been temporalily countermanded ; but I am informed the Viceroy is determined, should present negotiations fail to bring matters to a satisfactory solution, to be prepared to support any demands the Russian Government may have to make in connection with luikish encroachments on territory in the district of Urmia by sending a strong armed force into Asia Minor. . £ „ In order, at a given moment, to more substantially sustain thn claims of Kussia on the point at issue, an infantry division is being brought by rail from the Kazan military district to the Caucasus. My informant tells me these troops aie being conveyed towards the Persian frontier. The idea would seem to be to relieve axl units belonging to the army of the Caucasus now in Persia by the freshly imported units from Russia, so as to have the military forces marked out for service m Turkey intact and ready to send into Asia Minor at short notice in case of emergency. _ Military stores, principally small-arm ammunition, continue to be dispatched fiom here to Sarikamish. ^ _ . . rp . .

[Translated from the Turkish language.] PRAISE to God, the holy, the gracious, the hestower of victory, who has opened the door of peace and concord with the key of the words “Verily I wish nothing so much as reconciliation,” and dispelled the darkness of war and fighting with the light of quiet and happiness, blessings, and benedictions, so long as flowers will spread their perfume and daylight shine, upon his prophet, who has fully and clearly manifested the faith, and with whose auspicious advent the Islamism was greatly rejoiced, and upon his family, children, and companions who have been active in propagating that faith. Now, whereas by the will and good pleasure cf Him who raised the skies without pillars, and by an effect of the wisdom and omnipotency of Him who composed all things from various elements, and who has no equal, good order in society and the conservation of the world depend upon the justice and equity of the Sovereigns and upon their good understanding and union, no less than upon their submission to the positive and to the negative divine commands, the August Sultans have, in conformity to this sacred precept, “Rear God and reconcile yourselves,” resorted to reconciliation, which is a source of happiness and renounced to hostilities and war; the sword of mutual contrariety was put into the scabbard, and nations which were making war with each other cordiallv reconciled themselves. That is a favour of God. He grants it to whom He pleases, and God is most gracious. I, therefore, the most humble of all the servants of God, being charged and authorised to do or undo whatever concerns the Empire and the nation, and to make, just as I chuse, war or peace, an authority which I hold from the most glorious Padishah, who is the defensor of the faith, whose majesty is as great as that of Solomon, who is the substitute of God in the world, and who has justified the maxim that an equitable Sultan is the shadow of God on earth, the asylum of the greatest Mussulman Princes, the shelter of the most illustrious Turkish Sovereigns, the supporter of Islami^m and of Mussulmans, the exterminator of heresies and of the polytheists, the Sovereign of the two lands and of the two seas, the Sovereign of the two orients and of the twm Occidents, the servant of the two holy cities, the treasure of mankind, and the apple of the age, w r ho is protected by the supreme Being whose divine assistance men implore, and favoured by the most high and propitious God, may His Imperial Majesty’s dynasty last till the end of the world, and their reign be prolonged till the consummation of ages, have, in virtue of my full powers and my real character of the Sultan’s substitute, ordered the victorious Turkish troops to march from beneath Bagdad, and began to go forward with an intention of entering the Persian territory. On our arrival at a station called Haronia, the most distinguished among the Grandees Chems, Hddin Mehmed Culi Bey, great equerry, arrived there in the capacity of ambassador with a letter from him who is the ornament of the Persian Throne, the splendour of the Kingdom of Djem, and whose magnificence is equal to that of Darius, the great Prince and illustrious Lord, the precious pearl of the sea of royalty, the sun of the sky of sovereignty, the noble eagle of the high region of the dignity of Shah, the most illustrious and majestic Prince, * On the 2nd November, 1844, Sir S. Canning, in his despatch No. 240, forwarded a statement on the- whole frontier question by Count Medem, .Russian Minister at Tehran. This statement contained the following passage:— “Selon les assurances de Haji Mirza Aghassi le traitd signd entre Schah Sefi et Mourad IV aurait^td- conclu sous les auspices et par la mediation de FAutriche. Si le fait est exact, il seralt a presumer qu’une traduction du traits se trouverait dans les archives de Vienne, et qu’il y aurait possibility de s’en procurer une copie vidimee. Un tel document ferait cesser toutes les incertitudes qui planent sur le litige turco- persan.” The translation here reproduced was procured as early as December 1842 from the Imperial Library at Vienna by Sir S. Canning, with the assistance of the Chevalier von Hammer.msso 4 whose troops are as numerous as the stars, may the most high God raise the banners of his strength from earth to heaven, and exalt the edifice of his glory to the height of the vaulted sky, to our great and august Padishah, and also a flattering letter to me. The ambassador having asked that the fire of war should be extinguished and the dust of fighting dispersed, stating that His Majesty the Shah’s will is that reconciliation ^ and peace between the two parties should take place, I, on my part, too, wishing to act in conformity to the sacred text, to wit, “ If they incline to peace do ye also incline to it,” have readily consented, for the sake of the safety and tranquillity of mankind, to make peace, and a letter was sent to the Shah to the end that His Majesty might send a person of confidence with power to settle the conditions of the peace in a manner suitable to the honour and dignity of the two Governments. Consequently the Shah has appointed, according to the established laws and rules, to negotiate and conclude this treaty of peace and establish and fix the state of the frontiers, the most excellent and faithful Saroukhan, may he always be fortunate in transacting affairs on which quiet and security depend. Saroukhan, on his arrival in the Imperial camp at Zohab, was received with marks of hospitality, and on the 14th day of Muharem, in the year 1049 of the Hegira of the Prophet, upon whom be the best benedictions, a divan was held iu the Imperial camp, in which were present the illustrious viziers, the Miri Miran, the commanders and agas, the aga of the janissaries, six agas of six companies, and other officers of the army. Saroukhan, the plenipotentiary who was duly accredited, and the ambassador, Mehmed Culi Pey, were introduced in the divan, and the preliminaries were discussed with them so as to put on a good footing the position of the kazas and of the poor, who are a deposit trusted by the Author of all Beings, and the result of the discussions on both parties has been written down, and is as follows: Tzanan, Bedrie, Mendeldgeen, Pairtenk, and Dairna, in the Pashalik of Bagdad, will remain under the authority of our august Padishah, who will also take possession of the plains between Mendeldgeen and Hairtenk, and the mountain will remain under the authority of the Shah. Serminil is fixed as frontier between Hairtenk and Dairna. That part of the country of Haronia occupied by the tribes of Djaf and Zilja Uddin will belong to the Sultan. Pezai and Zerdony remain to the Shah. The fortress of Zindjir, which lies on the top of the mountain, shall be demolished; the Sultan will take possession of the J villages lying westward of it, and the Shah will take possession of those lying eastward. The villages on the mountain above Salim Calb, near Chehrezor, will be in the possession of the Sultan, and the villages laying on the east will be in the possession of the Shah, who will also keep the Castle of Orman, with the villages which are its dependencies. The defile leading to Chehrezor has been established as a frontier. The fortress of Kizildji, with its dependencies, shall remain in the possession of the Sultan, and Mihreban, with the dependencies thereof, in that of the Shah. The fortresses of Kotour and Maukew, on the frontier of Van, and the fortress of Maghausberd, towards Hars and \ an, will be demolished by the two parties, and so long as the Shall will not have molested the fortresses o*f Akhiskha, Kars, Van, Chehrezor, Bagdad, Bussorah, and other places within the limits, such as fortresses, forts, districts, lands, hills, and mountains, and no such horrible act as provoking to rebellion shall have been committed by him, on their part also, His Majesty our great Padishah will respect this peace, and no molestation shall, contrary to treaty, be done to the places which remain within the limits of the other side. j.n order, therefore, that merchants and travellers belonging to either party may come and go and meet with a friendly reception, I have, in virtue of my full power and positive authority, written down this egregious treaty, the contents of which are true, and sent it to His Majesty the Shah and to our most 'august Padishah. So long as the Shah shall, according to the sacred text, “ Do not violate an agreement after ye have done it, observe this treaty as it ought to be observed, His Imperial Majesty, our most magnificent Padishah, also will act in obedience to the holy command, “ Fulfil your agreement, for an agreement is obligatory.” This happy peace will last and be maintained with the permission of God till the day of resurrection, and he who shall alter it after having heard it, verily this sin shall be upon those who shall have altered it. Praise to God! He is the sole God, and blessings upon him after whom there will be no prophet. In the beginning and in the end, and externally and internally. The most humble of the servants of God, MUSTAFA, Grand Vizier.Ratification of the Treaty of Peace between Sultan Murad IV and Shah Sefi, signed at Zohab, May 17, 1639. [Communicated by tbe Turkish Plenipotentiary at the 6 th Conference, held at Erzeroum, November 21, 1813.] (Translation.) IN the name of the most merciful. There is no power nor strength except by God, in whose hands are the keys of events, and in whose omnipotence is the forth coming of all things preordained by His providence. Praises and salutations unto His holy prophet Mohammed, the most excellent of those unto whom wisdom is given, and the decision of debates; also unto his noble posterity and excellent apostles, the best of posterities, the best of apostles. Now, whereas by the will of Him, the Lord of the most majestic throne, and by the ordaining of Him who effects whatsoever He ordains, the ruling of mundane affairs, and the government of the concerns of man, are made to depend upon the accord and friendship of the kings of the earth, those heaven-conducted rulers, who are the outward figurings of the holy verse, “ they who strive for God,” and of the other, “ they who fulfil their promise when they promise,” under the wing of whose protection the^ countries of Islam are kept safe from evil and disorder, and the paths of the believers are endowed with the utmost degree of security and safety ; more especially since the high degree of our mighty sovereignty and the elevated grade of our sublime khaliphate is raised to the very summit of all ranks by the holy verse, “ Verily w r e have appointed thee our vicegerent on earth ” ; and honour and glory is given to our sacred person by our being ennobled with the service of the two holy places (may God most high sanctify them); and extent and amplitude to the circle of our Empire and dominion by means of our subjection to the sacred custom (soonnet from whence soonnee) of the prophet of the races of both material and immaterial beings (may the blessings of God most high be upon him); and our pure heart is illumined and sanctified w-ith love for the posterity and apostles ; and the following the path of divine guidance is made the means of salvation in the day of judgment; and we are the possessor of the possessions of justice and equity, according to the holy verse, “ Judge between man and man with equity”; and the follower of the road of holy warfare, according to the command worthy of obedience. “ Strike for God with full energy ” : and, since w r e make the sacred promise, “ if you assist God he will assist you,” the incessant subject of our thoughts, and compliance with its gracious signification our constant aim and business ; and therefore have made of our victorious sword an iron barrier for the repulsion of enemies and idolaters, and a strong castle for the circuit of tbe frontier of the territories of the followers of the true religion. Therefore God has given unto the days of our glorious kingdom firmness and duration, and to the line of our Imperial sovereignty strength and stability unto the end of time. Glory to him wliose benefits are innumerable ; sanctified be his essence and his attributes. Unto the sincere presence of the high Majesty, the srlorious, the elevated in degree, the noble in rank, the possessor of the throne of the State of Iran, the protector of Ears and Mazenderan, the Commander of the Persian Empire, the Shah Sefi. (may he ever be encircled with the gifts of his God, the all-sufficient), after the offering and presenting of sincere prayers and ample salutations, the friendly information is this:— Through the select of the selected, Mohammed Kuly Khan (may his salvation be divinely bestow r ed), your friendly letter has arrived at our high threshold, dignified as the spheres, at our sublime portal, the axis of the world. The amicable tenor thereof is a commentary and exposition of the holy verse, £C We have placed friendship between you,” and a confirmation and proof of this other, &lt;£ I have thrown love upon thee ; ” it is a guide to the straight road of sincerity, and an index to noble habits of bygone generations, and openly explanatory of the fact that you are desirous of peace and amity, and wishing for happiness and prosperity ; that your agent, a chief of nobles and of courtiers, Saru Khan (may his guidance increase), whom you sent to our actual Grand Vizier of noble degree, our commander-in-chief on the eastern frontier, the high Minister, the noble councillor, the regulator of the universe, the orderer of the affairs of nations. Mustafa Pasha (may God give duration to his greatness) having had a meeting at the place named Zohab, a conference was held, in which the subjects of [450] 06 arranging peace, concluding a treaty, and defining the frontier, were brought forward and discussed ; and an arrangement made that— Of the frontier places towards Bagdad and Azerbaijan, Jessan, and Bauderani should belong to our Imperial self; tbe town of Mendiijin and the intei\ening plains as far as Dairtenk (the place called Sair-mil being fixed as the boundary of Dairtenk) also should belong to our Imperial self, and the mountain on the other side thereof to the other party • that Mil Bashi being designed as a boundary to Dairna and Dairtenk, they should belong to our Imperial side, and the divisions called Zeyau-ed-dm and Hauruni of the tribes Jauf, should belong to us, and Bera and Zairduh remain to the other party; that the fortress of Zenjir, which is situated on a hill, being demolished and made waste, the villages to the west of the said demolished fortress remaining with our Imperial side, those to the east thereof should remain with the other party; and those parts of the mountain above the fortress of Zaulim, near the town of Shehr-e- Zur which look towards the said fortress, should be taken possession of for our’Imperial self, and the fortress of Avraman, with its dependent villages, should remain to the other party; that the pass of Chagan be a boundary to Shehr-e-Zur, and that Kizilja, with its dependencies, be held m possession on our Imperial side, and Mlhriban, with its dependencies, should remain to uhe other party; and that the fortresses of Kotur and Maukew on the frontier of Van, with that of Maghauzberd towards Kars, should be pulled down on/by both sides; that you are satisfied with the agreement and arrangement so made by the said persons ; and that you undertake henceforward to observe the customs of sincerity and of compact, and to guard the requisitions of peace and friendship, and to observe your oaths, and to shun and avoid the breaking and perjuring thereof. By reason, therefore, of your demand that your sealed bond should be accepted by our Imperial self (proverb), The acceptance of promises is one of the indications of majesty. We, merely to give rest to the creatures and servants of God, and tranquillity to our States and dominions, have accepted the peace of prosperous omen thus concluded, which shall be held established under the condition that the horde of redheads (Shia Persians) be made to withdraw their hands from all sites and places, plains and lands, counted among the countries and provinces situated within the frontiers and boundaries as defined and determined, depending on, and relating to, our Imperial side, and protected by our equitable shadow; and that, whether they be cultivated or uncultivated lands, they shall be held by the agents of our supreme Court and the confidential servants of our most high portal, with all their dependencies and adjuncts, according to the rule, “ When a thing is established, it is established with all its necessary accompaniments.” And besides the above-mentioned articles, Akhiskha, and Kars, and Van, and Shehr-e-Zur, and Bagdad and Bussorah, and all forts and habitations, districts and lands, plains and deserts, hills and mountains within their limits, be not disturbed by the other party. (And among) the class of explicit clauses in force of the treaties sent to your predecessors in the happy days of my glorious ancestors, according to the saying “ Religion is an admonition,” it is (stipulated) that certain low and debased people under your dominion be not permitted, but be restrained from letting loose their tongues, God forbid it, God forbid it, against the two elders (Abu Bakir and Omair), the lord of the two luminaries (Osman, who married successively the two daughters of Mohammed), the chaste spouse of the prophet of the races of both material and immaterial beings (Ayesha), and others of the elected apostles, and chiefs of those who interpret the sacred writings (may the blessings of God most high rest upon them all), henceforward also no latitude must be given to such people, so that the peace now concluded may be firm, and endure to the end of time. So long as no act of irregularity, contrary to agreement and treaty, and tending to breed misunderstanding and dissension, proceeds from your Majesty, we, on our most noble imperial part, will observe the conventions and stipulations above named and inscribed. And in order that your land and country may not be disturbed, this our imperial and truth-filled letter of ratification has been drawn up and written, in exchange for your engagement, which you have sent me ; so that enmity may cease on both sides, and the usages of friendship and concord be observed more than ever before. Also your above-mentioned envoy, having been honoured and ennobled by being admitted to kiss my imperial carpet, spread with grandeur, and having executed Ins mission in a complete manner, now departs, in order to return to your Majesty, with our imperial permission, accompanied by the Mutaferrika Mohammed (may his honourendure), the pride of nobles and princes, one of the Mutaferrikas of our august court, who is charged with the service of conveying our imperial letter of ratification. May those whose meditations are for the good of their religion and country ever he the objects of the grace of God, the bountiful, in the name of the Lord, the prophet, his posterity and apostles, the most glorious.

[Communicated by the Persian Plenipotentiary at Erzeroum, November 17, 1848.] IN the year 1048 Sultan Murad IV tore Bagdad from the holding of the Shah Safee, and the Vizier Korra Mustafa Pasha concluded a treaty with the Persian by which the frontiers were thus settled:— In the province of Bagdad, Jessaun, Bedra, Mendeljeen, Dairtenk, Dairna, unto the place called Sair-meen (Sair-meel, i.e., the chief land-mark), also the plains between Dairtenk and Mendeljeen and the divisions Zeyan-ed-Deen and Hauroonee of the tribe Jauf, and the villages to the west of the fortress Zenjeer, and the forts and hills above the fortress Zaulim, near unto Shehr-i-Zoor (Suleimanieh), and the environs of Shehr-i-Zoor as far as the pass Chagaun, which look towards the said fortress, also the fortress Kizilja and its dependencies, shall be held in possession by the Sultan; besides these, Akhiska, Kars, Van, with Deera and Zairdooyee, called also Zairdeyan, of Shehr-i-Zoor, and the villages to the east of the fortress Zenjeer, and Mihrebaun with its dependencies, shall he held in possession by the Shah.

True translation: J. W. Bedhouse. Erzeroum, November 17, 1843.13 i No. 5. 1 reinstation of the Treaty concluded between Nadir Shah and Sultan Mahmoud Khan in the year of the Hegira 1159 (a.d. 1746). IN the great meeting of the plain of Moghan, the people of Persia having agreed to the sovereignty of the successful Prince, whose Court is splendid as the heavens, of the exalted and distinguished race of Turcomania, the thunderbolt destroying by the assistance of God the existence of all rebellions, the bestower of the lloyal Crowns of the Sovereigns of the Kingdoms of India and Turan, the King of the country of Iran, wise as Dara, the exalted and glorious Emperor, the shadow of God, the King of the Kings of the world, His Majesty the King Nadir, may his sovereignty and greatness be everlasting. But, as from the first rise of Shah Ismail Suffaveeah, reproach and execration were divulged in Persia with reference to the religion of Haneefeh, one of the orthodox creed, who was the chosen of the dear predecessors of that Boyal person (Nadir Shah), and were the cause of producing and giving rise to strife and enmity between Turkey and Persia, and of causing to him horror of the sovereignty. After that great supplications had been made by that tribe (the Persians), they (Nadir) commanded that whenever that tribe should by sincere profession abandon its faith and foolish speeches, and acknowledge the justice of the rule of the Caliphs, the instructors in religion, to all of whom be the paradise of God, they would obtain their wish. They (the people of Persia) also consented to the Boyal order, and from the present time retract what had previously passed. As His Majesty, exalted as the heavens, whose face is splendid as the sun, the most exalted of the Sovereigns of the earth, the most distinguished of the Emperors of the globe, the Sovereign possessing the world, the Prince exalted as Feridoon, the Emperor of the two seas, and the ruler of the two continents, second to Alexander the Great, the Caliph the shadow of God, the Sovereign the refuge of Islam, the Hanifeh of the people of the faith, the light which illuminates the world of the Turcoman race, the victorious Sultan Mahmoud Khan (may God ever protect his Caliphate and State) and the Imperial Prince Nadir Shah have had their extraction from the race of Turcomania; in order that friendship might be increased between the two Princes, and to put an end to the evils of enmity and reproach between the two parties, five demands were made, namely, the acknowledgment of the truth of the religious sect of the lahree, and the particular appropriation of one of the pillars in the house of God to the pilgrims of Persia, and the fixing of a chief for the pilgrims from the State of Nadir by the way of Egypt and Syria, and the release of the captives of both sides, and the residence of an agent in the capitals of both Governments. After the repeated arrival and departure of Ambassadors and agents from Turkey, the refuge of the faith, the three last articles were agreed to, but in regard to the division of religion into five (sects) and the appropriation of the pillar, they (Turkish Government) excused themselves by committing (these articles) for decision to the court of law, and by evasive excuses broke the agreement, being desirous of putting an end to these claims. Although His Majesty the Shahinshah was the originator of these demands, he had no other desire than to put an end to enmity and to abolish strife, and to secure friendship among the people of Islam, yet, by the decree of God, the completion of the desire did not have effect. At the time that the door of peace seeking was knocked at he had no other view than being free from machination, and from pure friendship, and solely in order to please the Boyal mind of the King, the shadow of God, the occupier of the place of Alexander (the Sultan), and the preserva tion of the renown of Islam, he employed himself in knocking at the door of friendship and abandoned the demand of what had been established and took the road of peace. The happy news of the granting of peace was sent by a messenger to the King (the Sultan), whose horse is as the heavens. But as a part of Irak and Azerbaijan, which in former times was dependent upon the State of Turcomania, passed over to the Ottoman Government in consequence of the hostilities of Shah Ismail, in the contents of that message it was made known that if it should not appear a hard condition to the King (the Sultan), the refuge of the faith, and opposed to the rules of friendship, he should present by way of present one of those two provinces to be annexed to the possessions of the kingdom of the Shahinshah, and the choice was left [450] E14 entirely to the King (the Sultan), the refuge of Islam, of refusing or agreeing to it. In the Royal letter (of the Sultan) which at present has arrived from that exalted Government by Lateef Effendi, it is written that, although the laudable endeavours shown (by Persia) in wiping away and giving repose from innovations were perceived on the part of this (the Turkish) Government, and that the two exalted Governments were reckoned as one, still, having regard to the laws of the exalted Ottoman Govern ment, a council was held upon these affairs with the chief viziers and learned priests, who were of opinion that to give their consent was opposed to law and contrary to the laws of the State. In like manner as the former conditions were set aside let this question also be passed over, in order to secure the increase of friendship and reconciliation, and let the peace established in the time of Sultan Mooiad Khan the IVth. whose dwelling be in paradise, be adopted, so that friendship and amity may remain firm between the two exalted Governments and our beloved descendants and exalted successors as long as the world exists. I or the conclusion of this affair, the hisrh in rank, the exalted Minister and dear and intelligent counsellor of State, Ahmed Pasha, Governor of Bagdad and Bussorah, and the highly honoured person before mentioned (Lateef Effendi) are instructed and empow eied on the part of that exalted Government (Turkey) and on the part of the high in rank before mentioned (Pasha of Bagdad), the respectable, &amp;c., Katib, Wallee Effendi, was sent along with the before mentioned (Lateef Effendi) to this exalted Court. The two^above-mentioned persons arrived in the great Royal camp between lehran and Kazvm, and veie dignified in kissin' the exalted splendid threshold; on the part of this exalted Government also this least of the servants of the Royal Court of the King of Kings was appointed to negotiate. As His Majesty the Shahinshah considers that Prince (the Sultan), his elder brother, with the view of giving satisfaction to his Royal mind and the repose of the people of Islam, after the arrival of the Royal letter of the King, the refuge of Islam, it Avas agreed: In conformity with the Royal commands (of Isadir) a treaty of peace is established and composed in this manner—one condition, one stipulation, three articles, a separate article, and a conclusion. Condition. The peace which existed during the reign of the Emperor wdio is in paradise, Sultan Murad Khan the IVth, shall be observed between the two Governments, and the frontiers and boundaries which were established between them shall be observed in the same manner, and no change or deviation in its conditions shall be permitted. Stipulation. Henceforward, strife having ceased and the sword being sheathed, that which is suitable to the dignity of both sides and connected with the peace and v T elfare of the two States shall in every respect be acted upon, and all actions shall be avoided which raise the dust of enmity and are opposed to welfare, peace, and safety. Article 1. In regard to the Hajis who proceed to the honoured house of God by the way of Bagdad and Syria, the governors and rulers who are upon the line of road shall pass them on in safety and security from station to station, from one to the other, and shall pay attention to their property and necessities. Article 2. In order to confirm the friendship and unanimity of the two Governments, every three years a person from that Government shall be present in Persia, and a person, also from Persia, shall be present in that State (Turkey), and their expenses shall be paid by the several Governments. Article d. The captives on both sides shall be freed without purchase, and whoever may wish to go to his native country shall not be prevented from doing so.Annexed Article. The frontiers and boundaries of Sultan Murad Khan shall be correctly ascertained, and the governors of the frontiers shall refrain from actions which are ^ opposed to friendship; besides which the people of Persia shall entirely abandon the improper conduct which was invented in the times of the Suffaveech, and with complete good faith shall conform to the orthodox religion, and shall remember the Caliphs, the instructors in religion, with blessings and contentedness. And to those persons (Persians) who hereafter shall go to the exalted Kaabeh and the honoured Medineh and the other countries of Islam on the part of that (Turkish) Government the same attentions shall he paid as are usually observed towards the pilgrims of Turkey and the people of the other countries of Islam, and not demand from them the exaction called Doormeh and other demands contrary to law and equity, and also in regard to Kerbelah, provided that merchandise be not in the possession of those persons (pilgrims), no tax shall be taken from them by the governors and rulers of Bagdad, and whoever shall have articles of merchandise in his possession, no further demand shall be made upon him than what is regularly due. And on this side also (Persia) the same conduct will be observed towards the people and merchants of Turkey. Also, from the date of the establishment of the peace, whatever persons belonging to Persia shall flee to Turkey, or from Turkey to Persia, assistance shall not be given to them, and they shall be delivered up to the agents of the respective States, and, please the Great God, this friendship and amity between the two Governments, the descendants and successors of these two great dynasties, shall firmly exist for ever. Conclusion. As his Excellency Lateef Effendi, who came on the part of the Turkish Govern ment, has at the present time, month of Shaban, in the year of the Hegira 1159, equivalent to the year of the tiger, agreed to the conditions and the contents above described, agreeably to the lloyal letter of full powers with which he was provided, sealed this document and delivered it to His Majesty the Shahinshah (Nadir); on this account this least of His Majesty’s servants, who was empowered on the part of His August Majesty, has sealed and delivered this instrument under the condition that hereafter Ambassadors of equal rank shall be appointed on both sides, and that about the time of the festival of Novrooz (“ vernal equinox”), or after it, a ratification of the written articles shall be sent.

Treaty between Persia and Turkey concluded a.h. 1237 (a.d. 1822). (Translation.) SINCE between our ever-enduring Government and the Government of Persia peace and friendship have constantly subsisted and amicable relations have been at all times established, which, within the Inst few years, on account of a variety of circumstances, have been converted into coldness, enmity, and strife, it has become necessary for the sake of preserving union among the people of Islam, particularly as neither party desired war, to evince an inclination for renewing cordial relations and to establish peace, so that all cause of strife may be removed and that both people and both countries may rest in tranquillity. Viewing the exalted dignity of both Governments, it has become incumbent on our Pcoyal mind to contribute our aid for maintaining ancient boundaries and treaties by conferring our sublime letter-patent on the Seresker Pasha of Erzeroum, Mahomed Paouf Pasha, &amp;e., to conclude a treaty of peace. And on the part of His Majesty the Shahinshah of Persia, Mirza Mahomed Ali, Mustorofee, &amp;c., has also been appointed with full powers for the same purpose. After full discussion on both sides they, according to their full powers, sealed a treaty at Erzeroum on the 19th Zil Kadeh, 1237 (about the 5th August, 1822), containing the articles and stipulations which will be hereafter mentioned. According to the treaty of peace concluded in the year 1159 (a.d. 1746), the stipulations regarding the ancient boundaries and frontiers and the former agreement regarding pilgrims to Mecca, merchants, refugees, the restoration of prisoners, and the residence of an Ambassador from each Government at the capital, are all in full force between both exalted Governments, and by no means whatever are they to be considered abrogated. The relations of friendship are to be perpetually maintained between both Governments. Henceforward the sword of strife is to be fixed in its scabbard, and there is never to be the slightest trace of coldness or bitterness or of whatever is opposed to truth and good faith. Within the space of two months from the date of the peace, whatever forts, territory, villages, great or small, within the ancient boundaries of the Turkish Government have fallen into the possession of Persia, whether before the war or during the war, are all to be restored. And in celebration of the peace the prisoners are to be unreservedly liberated and to have full leave to depart, and whatever subsistence is required for them on the road is to be supplied by each Government until they reach the frontier. Article 1. Neither Government is to interfere in the internal affairs of the other, and hereafter the Persian Government is by no means whatever to interfere with the territory of Pagdad or of Koordistan,* or with the frontiers attached to them, or with the revenue of the districts (senjak)f of Koordistan, and it is not to use any influence over (or else not take under its authority) the former or present possessors of districts (senjak); and with regard to the Eelyats (wandering tribes) of the above-mentioned places belonging to both Governments which pass into the territory of both Govern ments to fix there their winter and summer abodes, if there should be any quarrel in obtaining from them the hire of their winter and summer quarters, His Itoyal Highness the Heir-Apparent of Persia and the Pasha of Erzeroum will give each other notice, and they will endeavour to settle and finish the above quarrels that they may not become a source of coldness between the two Governments. Article 2. The people of Persia who go to the Great Mecca and the Pure Medina and other cities of Turkey are to receive the same treatment both in going and returning that is * Exclusive of its more extensive application, this word is used in Persia to denote the pro% r ince of Ardelan, of which Lewra is the capital. In Turkey this word perhaps implies Suleimanieh. t Senjak is not a Persian word. [450] \ Gbestowed on the hajis and pilgrims and people of other Mahommedan nations; nor are fines (or else gratuities, “doormeh,” which is not Persian), or anything contrary to the law or regulation or any other money to be exacted from them; and in the same manner from the pilgrims to Kerbela, unless they are carrying merchandise, no tax is to be levied, and if they should have merchandise in their possession an account (R is to be taken and no more is to be exacted than is customary. The Persian Govern ment is to treat Turkish merchants and subjects in the above manner ; and hereafter the validity of this agreement with regard to Persian hajis and merchants is to be strictly observed by the viziers, the leaders of the haj and by governors and all other persons in authority in Turkey ; from Syria to Mecca and Medina, both in going and returning, the Royal treasurer (of the Porte) is to have them under his observation, that there may be no breach of these stipulations, and he is carefully to attend to their protection ; if, through fate, there should be any quarrels, the treasurer and some other trusty person are to endeavour to settle them. And if at any time the honoured haram of the Shah and the Princes, or any other among the nobility of Persia, should go on a pilgrimage to Mecca or Kerbela, they are to be treated with the greatest respect in Turkey. in the same manner, with regard to customs duties and so forth, the merchants of the exalted Persian Government are to be treated in exactly the same manner that the Turkish Government treats Turkish merchants, and 4 per cent, is to be exacted from their merchandise, and a certificate is to be given to them that no other duty is to be again required from them in subsequent transactions (of the same goods). And with regard to pipe-sticks, which Persian merchants bring to Constantinople and other cities in Turkey, and which could only be sold to one person, that arrangement is annulled, and they themselves are allowed to sell to whomever they think fit. And Persian merchants who come to Turkey are, to preserve unity in Islam, to be treated in a friendly manner, and they are to be protected from oppression and injury. Article 3. With regard to the tribes of Ilyduanloo and Sibiku, which are a subject of dispute between the tw r o States, and which are now in the Turkish territory, if they encroach on the Persian frontier and commit any injury, the frontier authorities of the Turkish Government are to employ the utmost exertion (in restraining them), and if punishment proves ineffectual, and they will not desist, the frontier authorities are to abstain from protecting them (the word used is “ tesahub,” which does not mean exactly protection; it may be translated the frontier authorities are to have nothing more to say to them). And if they (the Kurds) wish to come to the territory of Persia with their own will and choice the Turkish frontier authorities are not to obstruct them. And if after they (the Kurds) come to Persia they should commit injury in Turkey the Persian frontier authorities are to use every exertion in repressing their presumption and violence. Article 4. Agreeably to the former agreements of the two exalted Governments, the refugees from either country are not to be retained, and in the same manner the tribes and Eelyats which go from Turkey to Persia or from Persia to Turkey are not to be retained. Article 5. The property belonging to Persian merchants and pilgrims which has been retained in the Turkish territory by the decree of the heads of the law (the Cazusk) is to be restored to the owners by the heads of the law and the Persian Ambassador within sixty days after the date of this treaty. And if the Turkish governors should have taken anything by violence from the Persian merchants and pilgrims on the road or elsewhere, the latter are to appoint an agent, who is to prove their demands in the presence of the heads of the law; after legal proof the Turkish Government is to contribute its aid in collecting their property, and a firman is to be issued commanding its restoration. Article 6. Should a Persian subject die in the Turkish territories without appointing a legal executor, the persons in charge of the Byt-ul-Mal will, with the knowledge of thehead of the law, lodge the property, agreeably to the certified inventory which has been made, for one year in a secure place, until the heir or his legal agent arrives, and the property is to be given to him in conformity with the inventory, and the keepers of the property are to receive the customary fee, and if the property should accidentally be burned or destroyed no demand is to be made. If after a year the heir or a legal agent should not come, the property which has been deposited in the Byt-ul-Mal is to be sold, and the proceeds are to be kept until the heir or his legal agent arrives. And if a Turkish subject should die in Persia the same course is to be observed. Article 7. In order to improve the cordiality of the relations between the two Governments, agreeably to former stipulations every three years a confidential person is to reside on the part of the Turkish Government in Persia and on the part of the Persian Government in Turkey. Whatever persons during the war have come to the territory of either Govern ment (meaning deserters) are, in honour of the auspicious treaty, not to suffer any molestation. Article 8. Whatever has been written above is to be agreed to by both Governments as it is written. Demands for the restoration of property which has been unlawfully seized, for injuries, and for the expenses of the war are to be considered by both Governments as past and gone, and no regard is to be paid to them. As it was stipulated that envoys should meet on the frontier within tne space of sixty days from the date of this treaty and deliver the Royal ratifications for both exalted Courts, in order that peace and cordial relations should be regarded in force from the date of the above treaty, and that every cause for estrangement should be extinguished, and that nothing contrary to the rules of friendship or contrary to the stipulations which have been agreed on should be committed by either Government; therefore a document in accordance with the agreements and engagements contracted by both Governments has been delivered at my sublime Court by an envoy on the part of the exalted King of Persia. According to the ancient customs of this ever-enduring Government, the honourable and renowned, &amp;c., Grand Vizier, Seyyid Ali Pasha, has given us an explanation of its contents, which we have fully comprehended. It has pleased our Gracious Majesty to honour it with our approval and dignify it with this our Royal ratification, and, in order to its completion, we have dispatched the accountant of Anatoli, Mahmoud ISejub Effendi, to convey it (to Persia). In conclusion, the stipulations in this treaty shall be perpetually observed, according as they have been written, by the Shah, the Heir-Apparent, and their posterity; and on our part, too, this treaty and arrangement for improving the relations of friendship are to be held in consideration; and hereafter neither by us or our Royal posterity, our viziers, or the governors of this exalted State will there be a hair’s-breadth deviation from what has been settled. May our sublime Throne endure for ever by the glory of the Prophet. Verse. For settling the affairs of this world, No one needs to search behind the curtain of fate; May friendship which preserves order in this world, Be, by the grace of God, perpetual.

Your telegram(s) No. 185 of 12 th 4pril VrlTl'~+A regards tecl l nic 1 ? 1 interpretation of text of articles.

Such a position would be specially unworkable m case of tidal river like Shat-el-Arab, where landlUs lying between high and low watermark are in many places extensive and carry with them valuable fishing rights. Again, effect of giving whole of river to Turkey wouid be to give them control of Oil Company’s wharf and anchor age at Abadan and the present-day anchorage off Mohammerah, which is in the mam stream.

As regards Sheikh himself it must be remembered that he is official representative of the Persian Government as well as the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and has with him a representative of Persian Foreion Office. oi us to make a proposal to Sheikh on the lines suggested would ^surely be to ask him to depart from that technical loyalty to the Central Government on the observance of which our assurances to him have hitherto depended I grant that he might be ready to accept our proposal in spite of Persian Government, m return for a considerable extension of our assurances in the direction of British protection. But however welcome to him and desirable tor us such a development might be, we need to realise that if we acted fairly and unequivocally up to extended assurances so given, we should be imposing upon ourselves greatly increased responsibility in practice both in regard to ^Ijcikh and his territories. This is a large question, which can be considered deliberately as a factor of our general policy and intentions in regard to Gulf and South Persia.

THE following description of Shallah, or Shalhah Island, was given in July 1877 by Surgeon-Major Colvill, who bad been deputed by tbe British consul-general at Bagdad to visit it and to report such information about it as he was able to obtain :— COPY TO INDIA 3 MAY 1912 1 DV'Q “ The Shallah Island is about 32 miles below Moham- merah, and 6 miles above and within sight of the Turkish custom-house at Dowasir. Shallah is, I believe, no name, but in Arabia a generic term meaning outgrowth, and it is well that it should have been applied in this case, for it is really no island, but a bank which had it been left alone would even now (i.e., in 1877) have been covered by every tide. The bed of the Shatt-el-Arab at this point is broader than usual, being about 3,000 yards wide, on account of the bank on the Persian side forming a sort of bay, and the island is about 1,000 yards from the Persian and 2,000 yards from the Turkish shore,and situated as it were in the mouth of this Persian bay. The result is that, whatever it might have been originally, the whole orce of the current now is between the island and the Turkish bank, while the bay is fast filling up; even now a man can wade at low tide from the island to the Persian hank, and there is no question but that in a few years more the island will become a portion of the Persian mainland.” Mr. Thomson, Nos. 59 and 60, May 3, 1877. In 1877 a question arose as to the ownership of the island. The Arabs of the Muntefik tribe, who dwell on the Turkish side of the river, were about to take forcible possession of it, when the Persians assembled a considerable force at Mohammerah, with a view to preventing them from so doing. Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, who had been instructed to use his good offices between Turkey and Persia in the dispute, [575]2 ill 1 telegraphed on the 25th May, 1877, that he ha induced the Porte to give orders that the island should not be interfered with, provided the Persians engaged not to raise any buildings upon it until the question of ownership was decided Lord Derby (then Minister for Foreign Affairs) thereupon instructed Mr. Thomson, Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, to inform the Persian Govern ment that this appeared to Her Majesty’s Government to be a fair and reasonable settle ment, which Persia would do well to accept until the question was formally decided. r Ihe proposed arrangement was accepted by the Persian Govern ment, who informed Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran that the Porte had agreed “that the island of Shallah shall remain in the possession of Persia as formerly, only that she is neither ^ to cultivate it nor erect any fortifications upon it. Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople pointed out, however, that the Turkish Govern ment did not consent to the island remaining in the possession of Persia, but that the pioposal made by him, and accepted by the Poi te, v as that the claims of Turkey and Persia to the island should be held in suspense until they could be decided by the Boundary Commission, or in some other satisfactory way, and that m the meantime neither Turkish nor Persian authorities should take possession of the island and build upon it. In July 1877 the British consul-general at Bagdad reported that Nassir Pasha,* Governor of Bussorah, had withdrawn his fellahs or cultivators and evacuated the island. In June of the following year the Persian Governor of Arabistan telegraphed to Tehran for authority to occupy the island, but was instructed not to do so. The Persians were apparently cultivating the island when, in 1884, the Turkish claim was revived, and a demand for its evacuation was made to the Governor of Bussorah. Repre sentations on the subject of this demand were made to the Porte, and the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople that, according to his information, the island had been purchased Mr. Layard, So.

Lord Dufferin pointed out to him, in reply, that the action of the Turkish authorities contravened the arrangement arrived at in 1877, and urged him to maintain the status quo in the island in accordance with that agreement.

BUCHANAN. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Ext7'act from the Booh by Dervish Pasha respecting the Turco-Persian Frontier. (Constantinople, 1286 Hegira.) (Translation.) 41. (A.)—“ Old” Frontier, i.e., the Frontier which the Turks wish to re-establish from the Chigan Pass to the Bugra Mountain. IN accordance with the protocol (“ masbata ”) drawn up on the testimony of well- informed persons in the district of Kyzilja, and also in accordance with information collected in Kyzilja, and latterly in Suleimanieh, Serdesht, and Liakhijan, the old frontier, turning to the east from the point of that side of the Chigan pass which lies to the side of Mele Surin, proceeds along the pass Kele Piran ; thence to the mountain Mir Haji, popularly known as Mir Aji, and leaving on this side (the Turkish) the district Ser-dush, passes along the hills of Ser-dush, which are on the Merivan side, by the passes Melei-Ser-dush and Koutar-Kish, and by the mountains Kuche-au-spi (Kuchelu-spi), Berde-resh, Gyrdy-Sauz, and Pushti Belu. Then it proceeds to the mountains of Siakh-Nesar, Khaneh-Sheikhan, Taleh-Kesik and Keleh-Ismail to the mountains of Siakh-zag, Mileh-gozan, Kani-Irvan, Pushti Nemelias and Kara Khan, situated to the south-east of Teretul “kasi,” turning thence to the pass Nau-Khuvan and passing through the mountains Kani-Geveh, Kala-Tirishkeh, Veivulistan, Takhti Abdalan and Kuteh-resh, situated to the north of the same Teretul “kasi”. From Kuteh-resh, the frontier turns to the north and passes through Kani Tal, Keleh-Kermi, Pushti-Kheftash, Karji Daban, Pushti Badinjan, Makhi-Sauz, Kyraulan, Keleh-Khan, Pushti-Meidanan, Kani Govej, the Zerdeh-Kial pass, the mountain Kiapri, the Kurtek pass, the mountain Ibrahim Jelal, Pushti-Naaleini Faki-Isa, the mountain Ester, Bpi-Seng and Lendi-Sheikhan. Then, turning along the crest to the south-east of the [2440 i—2] B 24. . ; ; ? . \ 26 APR 1912 \ SEGUE T ARY[S N9 I 7 _j2 * Liakhiian villages Zelekeh and Au-shm, under Pasva, proceeds by the watershed to the , pass of Meidan and crosses the mountains Khumam and Frengi, the pass Chagn, Kuliavi beer the ridge of Pushti Shaveha, the Baiz-ova defile, the mountains Kani- Lekan and Yernasa and reaches the heights of the mountain known under the name Thus as is mentioned in the treaty, and as is known to the local inhabitants, Kyzilja with all its demesnes belongs to Turkey, and Menvan with all its demesnes to Peism.f ^ ions not men tioned in the treaty Turkey should retain the nahie Teretul, forming part of the Suleimanieh sanjak; the makhall Baneh, now in the possession of Persia ; Serdesht, and Liakhijan with their demesnes. Persia should retain the makhalls Khorkhoreh, Sakkyz, and Souk-Bulak. (B ) The Frontier of 1848 from the Chigan Pass to the Mountain Sur-keu. Although this should be as described above, the present frontier of the Kyzilja district commencing from the above-mentioned pass of Surin, proceeds along the passes of Keleh-Piran and Kileh-Naveh-Sar to the source of Bnava-suteh, thence along the channel towards the Piver Kyzilja, then along the course of this last-named river up to a point where a small stream flowing out of Khahl-abad falls into it. Further up the course of this stream it reaches the mountains Kumi-ser-reshe. Thence it proceeds to the summit of the mountain Khezar-maleh, situated between Menvan and Teretul, to the Naukhuvan Pass and to the mountains Yevuhstan and Kuteh-Pesh, then ciossmg the Dupluskan defile to the Pass Kani-Dozdan, it reaches the mountains of Berdeh- Kechel • thence, passing between the villages Champar-au (until recently belonging to Kyzilja, but now the property of a certain banets, Akmet Beg? son of Khusein Beg) and the village Siakh-Guvez, now incorporated with Kyzilja, it reaches the mountain Surkeu, situated between the makhall Baneh and the kasi Sivel under Suleimanieh. The Frontier 1842 from the Mountain Sur-keu to the Mountain Keleh-Shin. The present frontier, having reached the mountain Sur-keu, leaves on this side (the Turkish) the kasi Sivel and Alan, lying to the south-west of the mountain named, and subject to the Suleimanieh sanjak, and on the other side (the Persian) the makhall Baneh lying to the north-east. The frontier passes along the watershed, formed by the mountain Sur-keu, along the highest points of the latter, and reaches its most northern point. Thence it drops to theloank of that tributary of the Piver Kiala, flowing from the side of Liakhijan and Serdesht, which, formed by the junction of the waters flowing from Baneh, passes m front of the extreme northern point of Sur-keu. The frontier proceeds down this tributary to where it falls into the Kiala, and then down the Kiala (leaving to Turkey the kasi Alan and Mavut belonging to Suleimanieh), and lying on the left bank of the river ; and to Persia certain villages of the makhall of Baneh lying on the right bank, and the makhall Alani Ajem belonging to Serdesht or Beitush. . . At the point situated opposite the rise which is known under the name of Zmvi- Akmed Khan, or Surin, and is situated between the village Kondal (be 1 onging to the Suleimanieh kasi Pushder) and the village Keshker-Shiveh (belonging to the makha Alani Ajem)—both banks of the Piver IGala form part of the Suleimanieh sanjak. The frontier line from a point lying opposite the above-named hill, Kani Guvej, crosses the rise itself, turns towards Beitush and proceeds along the pass Dervi Mergase, situated on the Khoumyl ridge, across the mountains and passes of Kuneh-Batr, Kurfatyk, Lagau-Kir, Ser-akhuran, and Seri-Bustem-Alian. _ Having reached the summits of the mountain Bul-fatyk, it proceeds afterwar s through the following places: Khalso, Berdeh-Spian, Gilgineh, another Kuneh-Bar, Ser-Kialu, Bamin, Jesusan, and Shenie. Having skirted the heights of the moun am Seliareh the frontier reaches the summits of the mountain Seri-Gumeh, passes throng the locality of Purkania, and along the road known under the name of Pei-Kuneh-spi, and, going up to the summit of the mountain Seri-baski-ali-Meran, turns to e east where it reaches the narrow channel of the hollow which lies to the south o e village there named Gurumar (Guri-Omar) ; then going along this channel the fron iereaches the river known about Serdesht as the Kiala, and about Liakhijan as the Rubareh-Liakhijan or Rubareh-Mashkan. Turning then to the north along the course of the river just mentioned, and leaving on the Turkish side the mountain Gereh-Deiaven, goes up to the mountain Purkani, then it turns to the west and reaches the stream ^Liaven,^ opposite the village Girdi-Sur, then proceeds along the River Liaven right up to the bridge close to the village Pulkava (on the left bank of the Liaven), and the village Mashkan (on the right side of the Liaven). Thence it makes towards the summit of the mountain Komaberan, situated near the village Mashkan in a south-westerly direction. Thence the frontier goes across the pass Barsin, the mountains Baski- Milani, Junelu-chopi, and the height Siakh-keu, and then we reach the heights of the mountain Kelek-shin. This frontier line therefore at the present divides the district Liakhijan into two parts : One section of the eastern portion—namely, the makhall Pasveh—is the district Souk-bula.ga, now forming a portion of Persia, and in the possession of the Mamash tribe of the bilbass ashiret, who are of Persian nationality ; and the other section of the eastern portion—namely, the makhall Naalein Mangur, which, although in the possession of the Mangur tribe of the bilbass ashiret, and under the authority of Suleimanieh, nevertheless, also belongs to Persia. The western portion, Lahkijan, in the possession of the tribes of Piran and Remek of the same ashiret, under the Khoi sanjak, remains Turkish. 65. The “ Old ” Frontier from Bugra to Kotur. The old frontier, having reached, as is explained above, the mountain Bugra’ situated between the makhalfs Liakhijan, Sulduz, and Ushna, then leaves on this side (that is, on the Ushna side) the village Du-avan and its valley, and passes across the heights of the mountains Pushti Char-pur and Pir-Pasir, leaving on the Ushna side the villages of Dynkha and Gundi Vela (Kendi Molla). The frontier then goes to the summit of the mountain Dereh-sureh, thence to Pushti-Durbeh, Kurakh, to the mountain Kani-takht, or Az, and thence to the mountain Mendil-pech ; afterwards it divides the makhall Baranduz (Berandiz), under the authority of Urmia, into two parts. The kasaba itself of Baranduz and also the villages Didan, Ardysha, and others lying to the east of Baranduz remain Persian ; but the villages Kasymli, Dymdym, Gek-Tepeh, Baiat, Saatly, and others lying to the west of these, remain Turkish. Beyond the valley of Baranduz the frontier rises to the mountain of Sir and then passes between the villages of Kheilori, under the authority of Berdeh-suru, and the Urmia village of Kara-khach. Passing through the locality of Khanei-Kalianter, lying in the Keli-Bendi defile, it rises to the mountain Ambar, thence to the mountain Zinvi Mulla Yeli, and then, leaving to Turkey all the villages, plough lands, and grazing lands of the Tergever makhall, it proceeds across the mountains Menjelser, Tapkeh, and Kura Meidan, lying to the south of Baradost. From the above-mentioned Baradost it deviates somewhat to the north-east and leaves to Turkey the nahie Upper and Lower Anzal with all their plough and pasture lands. Coming down to a point on the shore of lake Urmia, the frontier turns to the north, and following the shore of the above-mentioned lake reaches the headland of the mountains Mergevuz running out into the lake, turns a little to the west and proceeding along the highest points of the mountains Mergevuz, Augan, and Unjalykh, traverses the locality Bereh-bri (or, in Turkish, Kesik-dash), otherwise Kochi-beg-Kalasy, lying between the makhalls Chekhrik and Salmas, thence across Uch-teleper, Aluteh Kharky, and the fortress called Senger— ■ which places are situated also between Chekhrik and Salmas—thence it rises to the summit of the mountain Giaurav and proceeding along the boundary of the plough land lying to the west of Khoder-Kalasy, passes across the Mulla Isa pass, then across Kyr-tepeh, Kyzil-dag, and the rises Meskinlyj and Kalajik to the mountain Pelutli, thence it goes up to the frontier sign of Dagmaji- dash, which locality serves, as was dicovered at the commencement of my expedition, as the commencement of the boundaries of the nahie Katur. Thus the makhall Ushna remains on the Turkish side as also the nahie Mergever, the makhall Keliaz, owned by the Baumer tribe (its being a portion of Rovanduza has been referred to above) ; a portion of the makhall Baranduz, and the nahie Berdeh-sur, Tergever, and Baradost, the nahie Somai, together with Upper and Lower Anzal, of which the last named is now administered separately by Urmia, the nahie Chekhrik, and the now attached nahie Gerdian, Shinetal, Shepiran, and Deirik; Kala Khoder with the villages belonging to it, and also the village Ezdikan,the actual rio-ht to which of Kala Khoder is disputed ; and finally, the whole nahi&lt;$ Kotur in its entirety. On the Persian side there remain the makhalls Salduz, Urmia, Salmas, Khoi, and also those remaining localities administered from Khoi and Salmas which do not belong to the makhalls remaining to Turkey on the basis of the above- mentioned frontier. 99. The Modern Frontier from Ushna to Kotur. Although, according to the old frontier, of which mention is made in paragraph 65 r all the regions and districts specified between Ushna and Kotur should remain Turkish, they all, however, are at present on the Persian side, and the modern frontier, ha\ mg reached the mountains Keleh-shin, lying between Revanduz sanjak and the makhall Ushna, goes along the watershed, and passing across the mountain Shatreb, descends into the valley of Gaderan (that is of the river Gadyr). Having cut the valley laterally the frontier goes to the height of Berdeh Kell, which constitutes a part of the mountain Renduleh Zerzan, situated on the left bank of the River Gadyr, exactly opposite the mountains Shatreh, thence, passing across the height of Renduleh Zerzan, reaches the heights of Kalati-basat. Then the frontier turns to the west and goes across the pass of Gervek-Zardkeh and the heights of the mountains Aalakh (Valkh [?]), Takhti Mam Piri, and Deliamper. Having left on the Turkish side the village Binar, situated in the nahie Nau-chia, and afterwards crossing the river of the same name, the frontier goes to the height of the mountains Mai-Khellaneh, passes over the mountain Gyrd-Siaba, the pass Gerveh Tabutan, the mountains Mur-shekhidan, Seri-sheveh-Audeh, and Seri-Kelenkani. Leaving the village Arzin on the_Persian side and crossing the river Berdeh-resh, otherwise Arzin, flowing past the tillage Arzin, the frontier rises to the summit of the mountain Sen Shiveh-Kharamian, thence it goes to the height ot the mountain Kuneh-mesh, neighbouring the kali Kuneh-mesh. Leaving the villages Surkan and Kouket, the property of the Khekkaria kasi Gever, on the Turkish side, and the Baradost village of Bekhik on the Persian side, the frontier, first crossing the river Bajergia, passes through the centre of the villages of Sero and Sartyk, to the east of the ruins of the village or Terau rises to the mountain Kotul and thence along the watershed it crosses the heights of Meidan, Durgiakhi-Malanbasan [?} Kaifaruk, Peri-Khan, and Berkhebin, and reaches the height of Kutankel. Then the frontier leaves on the Turkish side eight villages with all their plough and grazing lands, namely, the villages of Upper and Lower Keleh-resh, Urtanys, Gekhikan, Kheshtarak, Kaulik, Kasrik, and Keleh-Haji, which, as was explained in paragraph 87, constitute the villages of the nahie Shepiran, and were built ninety years ago by some of the population of Albak, and of those tribes of the ashiret Shekkak, which are in Turkey. Passing by the boundary of these villages the frontier reaches the mountains of Sary-chichek, and again by tne watershed goes to the pass of Khach-gedig, the mountain Khala-vur and the pass Birishk-Khoran, otherwise Khanyk-gedig, and passing across the north-western end of the mountain Samur reaches the summit of the mountain Surav. Thence the frontier turns towards the east to the mountain Bereiulik, which, on a special map of the previously described nahie Kotur, is shown under the name of Aga-dagi. From the height of this mountain it goes to the mountains Giri-beran and Chakal-dagi, of which the latter, on the map above referred to, is called Kara-kaba. Across these mountains, and across the mountain Kur-kur, called on the same map Anaj-dash, the frontier goes to the height of the mountain Pir-zadeh, respecting the placing on which of a mark mention has already been made. Thence, along the crest of the mountain Pir-zadeh, the frontier reaches Dagmaji-dash. 100 . The Old Frontier from Dagmaji-dash to Great Ararat, representing the Extreme Point of the Frontier of the two Countries. The old frontier, having reached the mark placed on Dagmaji-dash in the nahie of Kotur, passes through the defile of Bianli and rises to Aladag, where, going across t e summit, on which the boundary mark was formerly placed, it leaves the vl fi^S e Kashkabulakh on the Turkish side and goes to Kaia-dash, lying to the north of village of Khisar, taking the height of Chavender on its way. Then the frontier leaves the village Kyrys [?] to Persia, but the region of Aliand entirely to Turkey. -^ assl rK along the Kyrys [?] defile the frontier goes to the highest point of the Kyrys L-imountain ; then, leaving the whole region of Sogmen-ava (Segban-abad) also on the Turkish side, crosses the pass of Karvansarai and the mountain Susuz. From Sogmen-ava the frontier goes to the makhall Chau-pareh, and, crossing the Fiver ^hiveh-resh, flowing directly into Persia, leaves to Turkey the nahie Bebejik, a portion /f the makhall Kara-koun, and the nahie Chaldyran and Avajik, with all that now constitutes a part of them. The makhall Chau-pareh, with the other portion of the makhall Kara-koun, in the meantime are Persian. The frontier crosses the mountain Akmezar, the pass of Uch-dash, the mountain Sokkar and its spur named Gemi-Kaia, across the mountain Soli and the mountain Kara-zemin. Kaza-Maku in its present form remains Turkish, and the frontier, havino* reached the bridge in the proximity of the village Muradli, on the Fiver Maku, at the bridge goes along this river up to the point at which it falls into the Arax, after which it proceeds up the Arax to the point which represents on this river the boundary point between Persia and Fussia. Then the frontier, going along the modern frontier between Persia and Fussia, ends on the summit of Great Ararat. 112 . The Modern Frontier between Baiazid and Maku since the latter Makhall passed into the possession of Persia. Although it has been impossible to obtain from anyone proper information as to where, since the Persians have become the possessors of the makhall Maku, the frontier proceeds for the distance between Dagmaji-dash, representing the commencement of the boundary of the nahie of Kotur, and the defile Bendi-Khalebi—which is considered by the inhabitants of Baiazid as the frontier point—nevertheless, if attention is paid to the disposition of the lands situated between the makhalls Maku and Baiazid, and also to the fact that at the present time the kasi Satmanys and Akhorik, as also the makhall Abagai—forming parts of the vilayet of Van—are in the possession of Turkey, and the makhalls Aliand, Sogmen-ava, Chaldiran, and Avajik are in the possession of Persia—the frontier, commencing from the above-mentioned Dagmaji-dash, should leave on the Turkish side the villages of Bianli and Kashka-bulakh, and on the Persian side the villages of Bar and Beshik, and, going along the defile of Bianli, should pass through Ak-kaia and go towards the hill Charvendir. Thence it rises to the mountain Kiaudel, and, crossing the pass Zeki, the mountain of logut-dukh, and the hills Keshkeh-lin, Korukh, and Kanli-Ziaret, reaches the mountains Koch-dagi. Then it leaves on the Turkish side the village of Korichen, and, passing over the mountain situated to the north-east of this village, goes across the pass of Sheikhan to the hill Biribkez-Adkan [?], and, having reached the mountains of Junik, goes across the pass of Junik and the hill Ak-toprak, reaching the mountains Feshken. Then it leaves on the Persian side the villages of Lower and Upper Magmur, and on the Turkish side the villages of Akhorik, Feshken, Kochkyran, and Pachukhli, and goes by way of the watershed to the mountain of Cheli; thence, also by the watershed, across the heights of the mountains Alekan, Kyrklar, and Dumanli, and the pass of Khan, goes to the mountain Kara Bulak. Then it follows the defile Egri-chai and reaches the defiles of Bendi Khalebi, situated between the ruins of Suvalin and Karabulak, portions of the villages of Kazli-Gel and Avajik. From enquiries made of well-informed persons of the Baiazid sanjak since the transfer to Persia of Maku, the modern frontier in the region of Baiazid begins at the above-mentioned defile of Khalebi, leaving the village Bedouli on the side of Avajik, and the village Sinorli on the side of Baiazid. Passing between these two villages the frontier goes to the mountain of Siran, and leaving to Baiazid the village of Nazik, lying to the west of this mountain, and the village of Bash-koi on the side of Maku, goes along the heights of Siran to the Gilman pass. The village of Bazygrian remains on the Maku side, and the village Gurji-Bulak with all the lands lying along this side of the Gilman pass remain on the Baiazid side. Proceeding to Giriberan, the frontier leaves the ruins of the village Kol-shikiak on the Baiazid side, passes along the ridge situated at the back of this village and known under the name of Kol-shikiak-dagi, and comes out towards the gorge Tikmeh-deresi, the right bank of which following the stream remains to Baiazid and the left bank to Maku. The frontier then goes to Tikmeh-dash, and in this gorge the right bank belongs to Baiazid and the left to Maku. Going up the gorge the frontier proceeds to the mountain Musa Seliavi, and the small valley, situated where the above-mentioned gorge ends, remains in the district of Ak-gol. All the points of the mountain Musa Seliavi remain on the Baiazid side, and the frontiers goes along the foot of the mountain to the top of the rise situated in [2440 i —2] Cft 3^0. $L{h-6 —- [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] k \ 1 N [B] PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [14638] Memorandum by Mr. Parker respecting the Frontier between Mohammerah and Turkey. THIS memorandum is divided into three parts :— 1. A preface, explaining the points at issue. 2. A historical summary of the voluminous hut important correspondence directly hearing upon those points. 3. Conclusions on the present situation, with special reference to the proposal to submit the Turco-Persian frontier dispute to The Hague Tribunal.

At various times from 1S99 to 1910 His Majesty’s Government have extended assurances of support to the Sheikh of Mohammerah: these assurances are printed in extenso in Appendix (A) (p. 47). They include a guarantee to protect Mohammerah against naval attack by a foreign Power, whatever pretext for such action may be alleged, and an undertaking to safeguard , the sheikh (and his male descendants) against an 'unprovoked attack by a foreign Power on his jurisdiction and recognised rights or on his pro perty in Persia. Early in 1908, the sheikh expressed appre hensions to His Majesty’s consul on account of the unsatisfactory position on the Turco-Persian frontier, evidently anticipating a possible exten sion to the neighbourhood of Mohammerah of the Turkish encroachments which had recently taken place further north, near Urmia. The sheikh’s apprehensions led to the issue [2440 c—10] H! * i 'Iri if km of tlie following despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople :— In the Mohammerah district His Majesty’s Govern- To Sir N. O’Conor, No 75 ment are not prepared to recognise any other frontier p e { )ruar y 25 than that laid down by the mediating commissioners in 1908. 1850, as indicated in red on the accompanying sketch map. . . . Any disturbance of the status quo at Moham merah would affect British interests, and might not improbably lead to the active intervention of His Majesty’s Government, who have given the sheikh certain assurances in regard to his territory. . . » In the event, no Turkish encroachments actually took place on the Mohammerah frontier, and Sir N. O’Conor accordingly had no occasion to make representations to the Sublime Porte. The subject, however, gave rise to some correspondence—more or less, at the time, of an academical character—as to the proper boundary between Turkey and Mohammerah ; and now, owing to the proposal to submit the whole frontier dispute to The Hague Tribunal, the question has acquired immediate interest. The correspondence in question, which w T as between the Foreign Office and British officers in Persia, and took place from 1909 to 1910, was essentially as follows :—- Lieutenant Wilson, adverting to the above Sir G. Barclay despatch to Sir N. O’Conor, pointed out that the September^!909.’ boundary recommended by the Anglo-Russian mediating commissioners in 1850 differed, con siderably to the disadvantage of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, from the frontier locally recog nised by the Mohammerah and Bussorah authorities ; and he urged, principally on grounds of local expediency, that His Majesty’s Government should disregard the line of 1850, and simply take their stand on a subsequent declaration made by Great Britain and Russia to the Turkish and Persian Governments, that the wdiole boundary between Turkey and Persia was to he found within the limits of the frontier zone, as indicated cn the so-called “identic” Anglo-Russian map, which was com municated to Turkey and Persia respectively in 18f'9 and 1870.* He represented that this oil * 4 * Both the line of 1850 (which is confined to the Mohammerah district and does not extend to the whole frontier) and the frontier as locally recognised at Mohammerah are within the frontier zone as indicated on the “identic” map. The frontier zone comprises a region 20 to 50 miles in width, the whole length of the frontier from Mount Ararat to the Persian Gulf.Consul McDouall (Mohammerah), No. 65, June 12, 1909. Sir C. Ford (Constantinople), No. 526 a, November 14, 1893. To Sir G. Barclay, No. 146, October 27, 1909. Consul-General Cox (Bushire), No. 2, Political, May 8, 1910. 3 attitude on the part of His Majesty’s Govern ment would be conducive to the perpetuation, much to be desired, of the local status quo, the maintenance of which, moreover, had been agreed upon—though merely as a temporary expedient pending a final settlement—in a protocal signed by Turkey and Persia in 1869. Lieutenant Wilson’s views were generally approved by His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. His Majesty’s Government, however, did not feel that it would be prudent to adopt the full suggestions of that officer; in arriving at this conclusion they had regard to the complicated nature of the negotiations which preceded and followed the ratification of the Treaty of Erzeroum in 1848, and they were not unin fluenced by the knowledge that, as recently as 1893, Turkey, relying upon the wording of that treaty, had attempted to revive claims to the ownership of the district, as distinct from the town, of Mohammerah. The reply to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran was accordingly as follows :— While His Majesty’s Government have no desire to disturb the frontier status quo as locally observed, and which, they are well aware, has never precisely coincided with the line as drawn in 1850 by the mediating commissioners, and indeed as subsequently accepted by the Persian Government, they would hesitate to approve Lieutenant Wilson’s contention that the line as defined in 1850 was cancelled by any subsequent declaration of Great Britain and Russia. That line was, after an exhaustive examination of the conflicting claims of Persia and Turkey, defined by the mediating commissioners as an equitable compromise, and such evidence as there is goes to show that it was upheld by the later commission which met at Constan tinople in 1875. His Majesty’s Government could not, therefore, formally support the Sheikh of Mohammerah, in claiming that his frontier extends beyond that line, except after consultation with the Russian Government . . . . , and as the result of an agreement with the Turkish Government, who are in possession of a copy of the map of 1850. The British Besident in the Persian Gulf, on learning the terms of this reply, supported a representation from Lieutenant 'Wilson, urging His Majesty’s Government to go further and to disregard the line of the mediating commis sioners of 1850 and adhere to the boundary as-jmm P L locally recognised. In support of this attitude it was urged:— 1 . That the line of 1850 threw the sheikh’s personal residence, &amp;c., at Pailieh into Turkish limits. 2. That whereas the centre of the fairway of the Shatt-el-Arab was the dividing line univer sally recognised in practice for many years past, the line of 1850 gave the whole channel of that river to Turkey, including two important islands now regarded as Persian territory.' A map to illustrate the two lines of frontiei was forwarded and is annexed. The reply of His Majesty’s Government to these and further representations was substantially to the following effect:— 1 . As early as 1850 Sheikh Jabir of Mo- hammerah had possessed a fort, if not a residence at Pailieh, on the destruction of which, with that of another fort, the commissioners insisted on the ground that it rendered freedom of navigation to Bussorah uncertain. 2. His Majesty’s Government had no desire to disturb the status quo as locally observed, and if there were danger of the question being raised would devote their efforts to the prevention of such a contingency. If, indeed, the question were forced upon His Majesty s Government, it would, of course, be open to them to negotiate for the recognition of the locally accepted boundarv, while retaining that of the mediating commission as the basis of discussion; and they could with equal justice refuse to tolerate the recognition of anything hut the local status quo as regarded the southern (?&gt;., Mohammerah) por tion of the boundary, until the Turkish Govern ment admitted the frontier zonef of the mediating commissioners in the north. * In reference to point 2, it may be mentioned that, by article 2 of the Treaty of Erzeroum, Persian shits have the right to navigate the Shatt-el-Arab in full liberty up to the point where the Persian frontier joins that of turkey; this clause at any rate secures freedom of access via the Shatt-el- Arab to Mohammerah town and the River Karun. j' By a clerical error in the original despatch the word “ line” was inserted instead of “frontier zone.” First Conference at Mohammerah, January 28, 1850 (Enclosure 2 in Sir Stratford Canning, No. 110, March 30, 1850). To Consul-General Cox (Bushire), No. 1, Political, June 27, 1910. To Sir G. Barclay (Tehran), No. 143, August 30, 1910.

It will be seen from the foregoing summary that the attitude finally assumed by His Majesty’s Government did not differ very materially from the views advanced by Lieutenant Wilson and the British resident in the Persian Gulf. Those officers urged, in effect, that since, so far as Turkey was concerned, His Majesty’s Government did not yet seem irrevocably committed to father the line of 1850, His Majesty’s Government should disregard it. His Majesty’s Government, while holding that it would be prudent to retain the 1850 line as the basis of discussion, were prepared, if the question were raised, to negotiate for, to press, and, in certain contingencies, to insist upon, the recognition of the boundary as locally observed.* There was some further correspondence in 1911 with the India Office on the subject: this is referred to in a subsequent part of this paper. The question which now arises is that of the procedure to be adopted by His Majesty’s Government, in view of the proposal to submit the Turco-Persian frontier dispute to The Hague Tribunal. This question, which is somewhat more complicated owing to recent Turkish attempts to control lighting and buoyage at the entrance to the Shatt-el-Arab, will be dealt with in the final portion of this memorandum. In order, however, that the conclusions eventually adopted may be arrived at with a full knowledge of the facts, a historical summary of the earlier correspondence—embracing the views of Sir H. Layard, Sir H. Rawlinson, Sir Justin Sheil, Sir Penwick Williams, Sir Stratford Can ning, and other authorities, on Mohammerah, and embodying the important negotiations on the subject from 1843-52—has been prepared, and forms Part II of this memorandum. The diplomatic correspondence of those years is of cardinal importance, since Turkey has only recently laid special stress upon it in the nego tiations which led up to the protocol signed at Tehran on the 21st December, 1911 (see Appendix (B), p. 51). * It must not be overlooked that Russia, by virtue of her past mediation, is concerned in this question; and His Majesty’s Government would seem almost bound not to abandon formally the joint line of the mediating commis sioners of 1850, without previous consultation with the Russian Government. [2440 c—10] CPart II. Summary of Correspondence, 1843—52. The enquiry contained in Part II of this memorandum goes rather beyond the immediate points at issue ; since, however, the basis of the proposed reference to The Hague Tribunal is to he the Treaty of Erzeroum (1848), it may prove convenient to have the conflicting claims, as they were advanced and dealt with 70 years ago, set forth here, as possibly Turkey may now attempt to reassert those claims. Sir S. Canning, No. 70, April 27, 1844. Sir Henry Layard, who was British Ambas sador in Turkey from 1878 to 1880, has published in his “ Early Adventures ” an account of the earlier negotiations respecting Mohammerah. His statement is reproduced in full in Appen dix (C), p. 52 ; but since it is in some respects an accurate account of what took place ; since it has been made public—though of a highly confi dential nature; and since it may he produced, as the “ impartial ” evidence of a former British Ambassador, by the Turkish Government at The Hague Tribunal, it is of sufficient import ance to justify the quotation here of certain extracts, as an introduction to a more detailed examination of the question :— Soon after my return to Constantinople .... the joint mediation offered by the English and Russian Governments to Turkey and Persia to prevent a war, which was then on the point of breaking out between them, was accepted by the two Powers It was necessary for the representatives of the mediating Powers at Constantinople to make a careful investigation into the claims of the contending parties, and to propose to them tor their acceptance a fair and equitable arrangement founded upon their respective rights and interests. Sir Stratford Canning entrusted me with this duty on his part The knowledge which I had acquired of the territory in dispute, and of the history and traditions of the tribes which inhabited it, proved of much use to me. I was able to prepare a project of settlement which appeared to me just to both parties, and warranted by the proofs which they had produced in support of their respective claims. It was entirely approved by Sir Stratford Canning, and sent by him to Lord Aberdeen, to be communicated to the Russian Government. He fully expected that he would speedily receive authority to submit it to the Porte for its acceptance. The result of my examination of the evidence and maps furnishedme was that the claims of Turkey to the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab and to Mohammerah were well founded. I consequently proposed in my scheme, as a fair compromise, that the new frontier-line should be drawn through the desert country to the west of Hawizah, at some distance from the Shatt-el-Arab, across the Haffar, and midway down the delta to the sea My suggestion, approved and adopted by Sir Stratford Canning, was submitted by Lord Aberdeen to the Russian Government, which declined to accede to it, and not only upheld the claims of Persia to Mohammerah and the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab from the Haffar to the sea, but insisted upon the cession to her of territory on its east bank (i.e., left bank), which she had not even claimed Lord Aberdeen, who was desirous of deferring to Russia, accepted her view’s and instructed Sir Stratford Canning to recommend them to the Porte. He sent for me after the arrival of Lord Aberdeen’s despatch to this effect Without saying a word he handed me the despatch. I read it, and remarked that I was deeply grieved to find that Lord Aberdeen had come to a decision which, in my opinion, was not consistent with justice and right, and was not in the interests of England. He requested me to draw up an answer to Lord Aberdeen’s despatch pointing out the objections to the arrangement proposed by Russia, the injustice that would be done to the Porte, and the discredit that would fall upon England as a mediator if she showed so flagrant a spirit of partiality to Persia. I wrote the draft of a despatch in this sense, which was adopted by Sir Stratford Canning. But it failed to produce the desired effect, and nothing remained to him but to carry out the instructions he had received from Lord Aberdeen r [Note. —This extract, written over forty years later, conveys a mistaken impression of the corre spondence. In regard to Mohammerah, Sir S. Canning’s recommendations were approved, with but slight variation, by Lord Aberdeen, then acquiesced in by Russia, and finally embodied in the treaty.

My precis, which here largely consists of extracts from the first two documents, does not follow implicitly all the arguments advanced by Sir Stratford Canning regarding the ownership of Mohammerah, partly because there was a certain divergency between the conclusions first reached by his Excellency and those urged by Colonel Sheil; partly because his Excellency ultimately admitted (pace Sir Henry Layard) that more regard should be had to the factor of prescrip tion, which militated against Turkey; and partly because, on a review of the complete correspond ence and at this distance of time, arguments and data appear in a slightly altered focus. If, however, as appears possible, the Mohammerah question is again reopened, and especially if it is brought before The Hague Tribunal, a more detailed reference to the correspondence, w r hich is now being printed, will be required. One of the points most warmly debated at the Conference of Erzeroum was the question of right to Mohammerah. That town had been attacked and razed to the ground by the Pasha of Bagdad in 1837, for the reason that, it was becoming a thriving commercial port, and bid fair to endanger the trade of the neighbouring town of Bussorah. This episode greatly embittered the relations of Persia and Turkey : the former Power claimed an indemnity of one million sterling on account of property destroyed and the indignity suffered ; the latter Power not only rehutted the claim for indemnity, but put forward a counter-demand for the ownership of Mohammerah and the surround ing country, and to the allegiance of the resident tribe. Owing to this and other causes, a rupture between the two Mussulman Powers appeared imminent: it was in such circumstauces that Great Britain and Russia, more nearly interested than any other European Powers in the mainte nance of peace in the East, offered to mediate, [2440 c— 10 ] Dand that the disputants were finally brought together in conference at Erzeroum. In the treaties then subsisting between Persia and Turkey no specific mention had been made of any frontier point south of Mendali (not far from Khanikin). The treaty of 1639—the instrument relied upon and appealed to by either litigant—contained only a general allusion to “ Bussorah and its acknowledged dependencies ’ as the southern limit of the Turkish Empire. Great uncertainty attached, as it still does, to the extent of territory dependent on Bussorah at the period of that treaty. Less conclusive evidence than precise treaty stipulation was therefore necessarily advanced, based upon the geographical features of the country, as showing the natural limits, and upon the allegiance paid by the resident tribe. The geographical position of Mohammerah and the extent of the rival claims will best be understood by reference to the accompanying rough sketch map. The united waters of the Euphrates and Tigris, receiving, after their junction, the name of the Shatt-el-Arab, flow nearlv due south-east from Ivorna to the Persian Gulf. The Biver Karun, rising in the Persian mountains of Luristan, runs nearly due south west until it approaches within about 3 miles of the Shatt-el-Arab, and then a portion of its waters is diverted suddenly to the south-east, flowing through the Bamishere Channel, parallel with the Shatt-el-Arab, to the sea. The two rivers (Karun and Shatt-el-Arab) are united at their point of nearest approximation by a channel which, according to the best authorities, is an ancient canal or artificial cut. The town of Mohammerah is built upon both banks of this channel (the Ilatfar), through which the waters of the Karun and not, as formerly, those of the Shatt-el-Arab, now flow. The Karun had till about the year 1765 another outlet into the Persian Gulf called the Goban, which was parallel to, and about 10 miles to the east of, the Bamishere outlet. The latter was the natural outlet of the Itiver Karun, whose waters were forced into the Goban by an artificial dam; after the destruction of that dam the Goban Channel again became dry.

J&gt;.) than any other document of the time—the following passage occurs :— The rule of appropriation from the time of authentic history appears then to have been simply this : that the lands deriving water from the Tigris and Euphrates belonged to Irak-el-Arab (Turkey), while the country along the banks of the Karun was within the limits oi Khuzistan (Persia). Nothing, perhaps, could be more simple in principle than this distribution, but nothing could be more fluctuating and perplexed than it has proved in practice, owing to the numerous changes in the courses of the rivers. [Incidentally, it may be observed that the justice of Major Itawlinson’s conclusion has been further confirmed since he wrote: Eor the Bamishere Channel, which was then a regular means of access to Mohammerah from the sea, is now only navigable for half its length by boats of small draught, thus rendering the Shatt-el-Arab the sole means of water transport between the sea and not only Mohammerah, but likewise Ahwaz on the Karun.] Apart from the general rule of geographical appropriation, rendered uncertain as has been * shown by the fluctuating course of the rivers, two questions, more or less interwoven, appeared to l)e involved in the dispute between Turkey and Persia respecting Mohammerah, the one the dependency of the tribe of Chaab, the other the right of territory to certain lands upon which portions of the tribe had settled. At the time under discussion (1843), the delta formed at the mouth of the two rivers, Karun and Shatt-el-Arab, together with a large portion of territory to the east of it, the town of Mohammerah, and the northern hank of the Haffar Canal, were inhabited by the tribe of Chaab or Kiab, whose chief settlement was at Pellahieh, an inland town some 30 miles to the east of Mohammerah.* * This memorandum does not deal especially with British relations with the Chaab tribe: but it may be mentioned that both Colonel Sheil and Captain (afterwards General Sir Arnold) Keinball reported in 1843 that, in the intercourse which had continually taken place between the Chaab and the East India Company, the tribe had either been treated as independent or regarded as subjects of the Shah (see Sir Stratford Canning, No. 70, April 27, 1844). A full account of British-Indian relations with the Chaab will be found in the precis, dated March 1911 , by Lieutenant Wilson on “Relations of the British Government with the Tribes and Sheikhs of Arabistan.”12 Major Rawlinson’s memorandum contains a graphic and detailed history of this tribe. As to the earlier years, it is here only requisite to establish that it came from the Turkish dominions; that its emigration took place about the year 1683 (thus after the treaty of 1639); that it settled on the delta, at that time a district of land too insignificant to excite the attention of either Persia or Turkey; and that until the year 1740 it remained dependent upon Turkey.* The political condition of the Cbaab then underwent a rapid and remarkable change. Under their famous chief, Salman, they dis possessed another tribe of the town of Durak and dependent territory, and thus obtained a per manent footing in a country to which the right of Persia was unquestioned. Sheikh Salman then pursued on all sides a systematic course of territorial encroachment, his acquisitions in Persia extending eastward to the Hindian River and northward along the Karun to the vicinity of Bend-i-Kir, while from the Turks, partly by intimidation and partly by bribery, he obtained for his tribe Abadan Island (El Khizr), the territory of Dowasir on the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, and a tract of country north of the Haffar Channel, comprising the districts of Mohammerah, Haffar, and Tamar, along the Shatt-el-Arab. The Turkish authorities seem to have enter tained apprehensions for the security of Bussorah itself : a naval engagement accordingly took place in 1765 between the Chaab and Turkish fleets, and fortune again favoured Sheikh Salman.f It is from this period that Major Rawlinson dates the emancipation of the Chaab tribe from any further dependency upon Turkey. This creation of a formidable and almost inde pendent Power upon the shores of the Persian Gulf was not viewed with indifference by Persia any more than by Turkey, and two attempts were made by the then Shah to reduce Sheikh Salman to obedience, but without decided success. * Major Rawlinson is explicit in stating that at the time of the treaty of 1639 the Chaab were settled at Wasit in Turkish territory. Mr. Lorimer, in his recently compiled “ Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf,” states that their original home was in Nejd f The account of the causes of this naval action, as related by Lieutenant Wilson in his precis dated March 1911, differs somewhat from that of Sir Henry Rawlinson.—A. P. Major Rawlinson’ Memorandum of January 6 , 1844.13 c&gt; None tlie less there was an essential difference between the subsequent relations of the tribe to Sir Stratford Turkey and Persia respectively for, while con- Aprim istJ 0 ’ stantly endeavouring to establish its indepen dence, from the moment it threw off completely the yoke of the former Power it appears to have become more or less subject to Persia.

Major Rawlinson’s Jt was about this time that Sheikh Salman Jamiary n G, U i84 0 4. removed the seat of his government to 1 ellahieh, within the well-established frontier of the Persian province of Pars. About four-fifths of the extent of country now occupied by the Chaab was unquestionably Persian territory, and the liability of the tribe to pay the Persian Crown the revenues of these lands, if that Power were in a condition to assert its rights, does not appear ever to have been questioned. Major Pawlinson infers, from the increased connection which was observable between the Persian Government and the Chaab subsequently to the foundation of Pellahieh, that the distinction between liability for payment of rent, as tenants of the soil, and of a fixed tribute, as subjects, was gradually lost sight of, and that the tribe, residing for the most part in Persian territory, governed by a chief whose capital w T as likewise in Persian territory, and subjected almost yearly to demands for revenue to the Persian Crown, came to be re garded as Turkish colonists who had immigrated to the Persian territory, and, by a continued residence of many years, had naturalised them- Major Rawlinson’s Memorandum of January 6 , 1844. selves as Persian subjects. The arguments of the Turkish Government in favour of an uninterrupted claim to the allegiance of the Chaab were simply these: that Turkey had never made any formal renunciation of her rights; that the Chaab, notwithstanding the removal of the seat of government to Pellahieh, continued to hold lands upon the Haffar and the Shatt-el-Arab subject to Turkey, and even to pay the revenue of those lands to the Governor of Pussorah ; that the fees formerly payable by the tribe to Turkey for other districts were merely withheld because those districts had become desert; and that a robe of office was still furnished by Turkey to the Sheikh of the [2440 c—10] E14 Chaab, in accordance with the old fashion of annual investiture. Major Rawdinson, in commenting on these claims, observes that to him, ever since the death of Sheikh Salman (1768), the Chaab appeared to have been virtually independent of Turkey, and that the notion of the indefeasibility of their allegiance to that Power seemed an invention of late years. When the Chaab had interfered with the Turkish territory on the Shatt-el-Arab, they did so either as conquerors or as purchasers of the freehold right or leasehold tenure. None of the relations which they thus bore to the Turkish Government, as occupants of the banks of the Shatt-el-Arab, appeared to indicate their national dependency. “ On the contrary” he continues, in a passage which, desiring to emphasise for reference, I have caused to be printed in italics, “ as they have continued almost uninterruptedly to pay to the Government of Bussorah (i.e., Turkey) the rent of the lands of Ha far and Tamar above Mohammerah, which they obtained by a grant from Suleiman Pasha of Bagdad, while they have long ceased all other payments ” [i.e., for land on the left (east) bank of the Shatt-el-Arab], “the pre sumption is that they have considered themselves liable for these lands only, and that they must have thus regarded themselves in the light of foreigners holding Turkish property, either in farm or by right of occupancy.” Major Bawlinson considered that the relation which the Chaab had borne to Turkey since Sheikh Salman’s death, to times comparatively modern [i.e., when he wrote in 1844), so far from being one of protection and dependency, had been marked by open and almost constant hostility. That the Chaab were Turkish subjects at the period of Sultan Murad’s treaty of 1639, which was still supposed, in its definition of the terri torial rights of either Power, to he in force in 1844, was a point beyond question; that the tribe had been virtually independent of Turkey for a hundred years was equally a matter of notoriety. I now pass to the actual town of Moham- Major Rawlinson’s merah and its immediate vicinity.

Major Rawlin- son says that the Sheikh was influenced in this withdrawal rather by a disinclination to come into collision with the growing power of the Muntefik tribe, and by the necessity of preparation against Persia, than by any respect for the rights, or deference to the views of, Turkey. It was at this time, or about 1812, that be built a fort upon either side of the Halfar Canal, with the view, it was stated, of protecting his frontier against the Muntefik, and he entrusted the defence of the place to his confidential servant Mirdow, of the Muhaisin tribe, which was at that time subordinate to the Chaab. It was a place of no consequence at first, but under the increasingly independent rule of Haji Jabir, the son of Mirdow, and a man of exceptional capacity, its favourable situation attracted com merce, and it rapidly rose into eminence as the mercantile town of Mohammerah.

Major Rawlinson’s Memorandum, dated January 6 , 1844, on Mohammerah. (Parenthetically it may be mentionned that, with certain interruptions, Haji Jabir acted as deputy at Mohammerah from about 1820 till 1858 on behalf of the Chaab Sheikhs, whose principal place of residence continued to be Pellahieh, and that in 1862 he finally superseded them. The present (1912) Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah, is the son of Haji Jabir, and rules over both the Chaab and Muhaisin tribes.) Between 1830 and 1837 the town of Moham merah had risen into so much consequence that it now evoked general attention, and Sheikh Haji Jabir’s anomalous position began of course to be submitted to enquiry. ::: ‘ It was in the last- named year that the Pasha of Bagdad, as already related, marched against Mohammerah, took it by assault, and plundered all the merchandise stored in its warehouses : he even made a demonstration against Pellahieh, which compelled the ruling Sheikh Thamir to seek refuge for a time at Koweit. This Sheikh Thamir, on his return, signed, for his own personal ends, a convention with the Pasha of Bagdad, securing himself in occupation of the sheikhship, and pledging the allegiance of his tribe to Turkey. But Sheikh Jabir, who could not so easily forgive the destruction of his flourishing town by the Turks, refused to be bound by this conven- * Sheikh Haji Jabir settled directly with the Government of Bussorah for the land rent of the town of Mohammerah.16 tion ; lie now asserted his independence of Thamir, and threatened, if interfered with, to call in the protection of the Persians. It was from the year 1837 that Major llawlinson dated the direct political connection between the town of Moham- merah and Persia. In the next few years Persia seems to have intervened more actively in the affairs of Mohammerah, though she did not disturb Sheikh Plaji Jabir: at Pellahieh, on the other hand, she had deposed Sheikh Thamir, and installed his nephew Pariss in his place. Such, in general outline, was the result of Major Rawlinson’s investigations. He recom mended, and his advice was in the main endorsed by Sir Stratford Canning, that the frontier should he defined as shown on the accompanying sketch map ; it will be observed that the suggested line passes lengthways through the centre of the island of El Khizr or Abadan, then, leaving the town of Mohammerah to Persia, it runs parallel to the Shatt-el-Arab at some distance inland from the hank. In recommending this line, Major Rawlinson estimated that the only valuable lands which Turkey would lose would be those along both hanks of the Haffar Canal, where the double town of Mohammerah was situated ; but to these lands, he added, she could not advance any valid geographical claim, and for manv years they had been practically lost to her. It is important to recall once more that at this time the boats bound for Mohammerah used largely the Bamishere Channel, now no longer navigable; and doubtless this was not without influence upon Major Bawlinson s conclusions. The only evidence produced at the Conference at Erzeroum relative to the allegiance of the Chaab tribe is to be found in the examination of Sheikh Thamir, the late chief at Eellahieh, who had been summoned to attend by Turkey. This person declared that the Chaab were actually, and always had been, under the dominion of the Sultan; but Sir Stratford Canning reported that his evidence should be received with caution, as he had been ejected from his chiefship by the Persian Government, and was seeking to re establish himself through the assistance of the Porte. Certain natives of Bussorah had indeed given evidence to the same effect, and a certificate in a similar sense, and signed by thirty-five inhabitants of Koweit, was also produced; but Evidence at Erzeroum Conference ( 1843 ).

Stratford Canning, No. 70, April 27, 1844. 17 Sir Stratford Canning observes that all these persons (including the Koweitis !) were Turkish subjects residing at a distance from Moham- merah. As proof of territorial claims, Turkey produced certain deeds of sale, court rolls, and deeds of foundation in mortmain. These documents bore, in the opinion of the Mediating Commissioners, the marks of antiquity; but Colonel Sheil, Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, pointed out that even if the authenticity of these documents— none of which was of more recent date than 1766—were admitted, they merely proved a temporary possession, and that similar docu ments might he, and had been, produced to support a claim to Tabreez and Kasvin, which, in consequence of the defeat of the Persian armies, were known to have been held for a short period by Turkey. Most of the European maps produced, including that of Macdonald Kinneir, adopted the Shatt-el-Arab as the boundary between the two Empires. The Turkish Plenipotentiary somewhat unintelligibly cited also the geo graphical work of Macdonald Kinneir to the effect that Abadan Island had formerly been in the possession of Turkey, but having been conquered by the Chaab Sheikh Salman in the middle of the 18th century had remained in the possession of his successors. His object was presumably to establish the original ownership of Turkey, but the quotation served also to confirm the duration of the severance of Turkey’s connection. The British Commissioners at Erzeroum, Mr. Curzon and Colonel (afterwards Sir Eenwick) Williams, basing their opinions on the evidence produced at the Conferences, and on a paper fur nished by General Monteith, who had long been employed in Persia, considered that the balance of probabilities respecting Mohammerah was immeasurably in favour of Turkey. But, at the time of writing, they had not yet seer Major Bawlinson’s memorandum, which gave a totally different complexion to the matter. Sir Stratford Canning’s view was summed ur in the following sentence :— ■ The whole results in a presumption that the original territorial right is in favour of Turkey, and the right of conquest and possession is in favour of Persia. [2440 c— 10 ] E ' -Iiiawufc 18 Early in 1844, the proceedings of the Con ference were abruptly suspended by the rupture of negotiations by the Ottoman Plenipotentiary. It is unnecessary to relate the causes of this dissension; but, in the deadlock which now ensued, Sir Stratford Canning addressed the Earl of Aberdeen in the following terms :— Confirmed in the persuasion, which I have long Sir Stratford entertained, that the Conferences at Erzerourn will not 1844. * terminate in peace without the expression of a decisive opinion on the part of the mediating Powers, I have prepared, and have now the honour to submit to your Lordship, a statement embracing all the points of the negotiation, and suggesting what I conceive to be the most practicable mode of settlement. Sir Stratford Canning’s statement had reference to the whole frontier, and to other subjects of dispute, and the suggested settlement was a plan of compromise, based on concessions in one direction balanced against corresponding con cessions in another. His Excellency pointed out that as the territorial claims were advanced almost exclusively by Turkey, while those to indemnity proceeded from Persia, the most obvious expedient would be to seek in the one class of claims the means of forming a set-off against the other. He accord ingly suggested that the pecuniary claims of the Persian Government should be entirely relin quished, and that, in return, Persia should be allotted the town of Mohammerah ; and, in that region, a frontier as proposed by Major Rawlinson (see yellow line on map opposite page 16). By this arrangement, it was pointed out, the uninter rupted navigation of the Biver Karun (through the Bamishere Channel which was then open) Avould be given to Persia, and that of the Shatt- ol-Arab to Turkey, whose only sacrifice would be a doubtful claim to the town of Mohammerah. If, however, it was added, this plan should fail, owing to the growing obstruction of the Bamishere Channel from natural causes, then both parties might be provided for by the only remaining expedient of placing the town and delta of Mohammerah under the administration of a Chaab sheikh, securing a common right of access to the town by both parties, and exemp tion from all duties, but such as should be separately levied by the authorities of Turkey and Persia, on goods and shipping destined r T 4To Sir Stratford Canning, No. 148,5 September 13, 1844.

It w r as in 1844 that the Emperor Nicholas I visited England ; and Her Majesty’s Government took advantage of the presence of Count Nessel rode to communicate fully with his Excellency on this question. The Russian Vice-Chancellor, while agreeing in many respects with Sir Stratford Canning’s suggestions, in some particulars proposed modi fications. He submitted that it would he prefer able to leave Persia in possession of Mohammerah and of the left hank of the Shatt-el-Arab, with the right of free navigation of that river, “ which in reality was the sole outlet for the exports of Southern Persia.” In the existing state of un certainty he considered that the principle of uti possidetis should apply, and that that principle militated strongly in favour of the maintenance of the frontier of the Shatt-el-Arab. Persia, in return, was to abandon her claim for indemnity on account of the pillage of Mohammerah in 1837. Sir Stratford Canning, while admiring the simplicity of Count Nesselrode’s proposals, added that unfortunately “the reason that was alleged against the original propositions was equally available for the rejection of the modifications; for if the consent of Persia was not to be expected in the one case, the refusal of the Porte might be equally anticipated in the other.” This anticipa tion of his Excellency was amply justified by the subsequent attitude of Turkey ; however, with regard to Mohammerah, he admitted that the Turkish claim was too uncertain to be made good against a continued occupation of eighty years either by Persia herself, or by a tribe, whose headquarters had been situated within the Persian territory twice the length of that period. The principle of uti possidetis might therefore, he considered, he applied to that district without injustice, though care should be taken to give it no extension unwarranted by fact. The Persians, he added, were not in possession of the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab higher than Mohammerah, nor could they navigate any part of that river without being liable to the duties levied on shipping and merchandise by the Ottoman au thorities. Sir Stratford Canning subsequently ascertained that Count Nesselrode’s views on the Mohammerah20 question had been derived from Count Medem, Russian Minister at Tehran. Count Medem had obtained his information from a Persian memo randum, which Major Rawlinson had demonstrated to be a mass of inaccuracies. This Persian memo randum, with comments, will be found in ap pendix E, page 57. As showing the owner ship of land on the left bank of the Shatt-el- Arab, Sir Stratford Canning quoted the following additional statements of Major Rawlinson, founded upon local enquiries and an intimate knowledge of the country—statements which, having an obvious bearing on the question of the actual frontier, at the present time, are of considerable interest:— Above the Island of Abadan occurs the mouth of the Sir Stratford Haffar Canal, with about a mile of territory belonging jlJfy 1844 /^’ to Mohammerah. Above you have for 2 miles the date No. 240, groves of Budijee cultivated by the Chaab, but paying ^ ovem ber 2,1844. revenue to the Bawee Arabs, then occur for 4 miles the lands of Tamar inhabited by the Chaabees, subject to Fellahieh, bvt paying revenue to Bussorah, and above that point the Muntefik and other Turkish subjects possess the entire territory for 19 miles into Bussorah. .... the lands watered by the Shatt from Girdelan to the sea are registered in the Bussorah records as dependencies of that city from the earliest period to which such documents ascend, and all the ancient geographical notices confirm this territorial allotment. Her Majesty’s Government, in conveying their The Earl of ultimate instructions to Sir Stratford Canning, si^Stratford after agreement with the Russian Government, Canning, No 5, considered that the only fair and rational mode of striking a correct balance between the parties was by regarding undisturbed possession of long standing, as the only rule by which the right of continued possession could he equitably deter mined. Applying this rule to Mohammerah, “ which had for eighty years past been virtually possessed, directly or indirectly, by Persia,” they held that the town should still remain to Persia, together with the possession of the left bank and free navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab from Mohammerah to the sea. (B).—-T7ie Negotiation of the Treaty of Erzeroum and the Conditions of Ratification. Period 1845-48. r The late Mr. Curzon, who for a short while was associated with Colonel Williams as a British21 Commissioner at Erzeroum, has graphically described in his book “ Armenia ” an episode which took place shortly after his arrival in 1842 :— I was walking up and down on the roof of the house watching the crowds passing in the valley below, and looking at the great guns of the citadel, which the soldiers were firing as a salute to the Persian Pleni potentiary. They fired very well, and in very good time; but I observed several officers and a number of men busily employed at one gun. At length this gun was loaded, a prodigious deal of peeping and pointing took place out of the embrasure, and, just as I was turning in my walk, bang went the gun and I was covered with dust. On looking down I saw a ball stuck in the earth : the soldiers had all disappeared from the ramparts of the citadel, and I found they had been taking a shot at the British Commissioner. Mr. Wellesley (afterwards Lord Cowley), No. 11 , August 4, 1846. Sir Stratford Canning, No. 8 i April 2, 1845. Here, perhaps, was a frank token of the value set by Turkey upon the mediation of Great Britain and Russia. The resumption of work at Erzeroum, which did not take place till 1846, was marked hy a similar incident of well-nigh fatal import to further treaty negotiations : the house of Mirza Takki, the Persian Plenipotentiary, was besieged and pillaged by a fanatical mob of Sunnis ; an assault was made upon his person and he was compelled to defend himself for many hours, Colonel Williams risking his life in the affray while the Turkish authorities remained inactive ; and, finally, two members of the Mirza’s suite were murdered. Many months elapsed before the Sultan was at length impelled to appease the outraged Envoy with a peace-offering of 15,000 purses.* In March, 1845, Sir Stratford Canning was able to join with his Russian colleague in recommending to the Sublime Porte a basis for settlement, by advising the total abandonment of claims for indemnity, and, in regard to Mohammerah, the surrender to Persia of the island of El Khizr (Abadan), and of so much of the left bank of the Shatt- el-A rah as was occujned by tribes recognised de facto as dependent on Persia, as well as the grant to her of full freedom of navigation on the Shatt-el-Arab up to the point of contact of the two frontiers. Sir S. Canning anticipated that the Turkish ' * \m22 objections to the proposals about Mobammerah would not be easily overcome: this forecast proved correct. A treaty was eventually signed at Erzeroum in 1847 : but the settlement was only one in Sir A. Kemball. semblance, as, before consenting to the con- ^ e? batim.) elusion even of the Preliminary Treaty, the Porte required that assurances should be given to it as to the meaning of some of the articles, and made conformity with its views on the part of Persia indispensable to its acceptance of the proposed engagement. After considerable negotiations, in which the Tj0rc ^ Cowley, Persian Government, or its agents, took no part, j une 2 , 1847. it was arranged, with a view r to secure the pre liminary signature of the Treaty, that the desired assurances should be given in writing by the representatives of the two mediating Governments at Constantinople; and, as a further precaution against their rejection by the Persian Com missioner on the spot, and his consequent refusal to sign the Treaty, it was determined to keep him in ignorance of the arrangement. It was hoped, indeed, that the Treaty once signed, the Persian Government would be readily induced to indorse these “ assurances,” or, if not so induced, it was argued, the Persian Government might still, if it pleased, decline to ratify the Treaty. The Porte for the nonce accepted this com promise, but at the same time declared emphati cally that, if the Persian Government did not adopt the assurances, the Treaty must be con sidered nul et non avenu. Under these circumstances, tbe Treaty was signed. The assurances in question did not, however. Colonel Shell, meet with the concurrence of the Persian Govern- t 0 ' ^ June 27, 184/. ment. Tearing some covert object which it could not comprehend, it persisted in its dissent from them to the Representatives of the mediating Governments at Tehran, and the course it deter mined to pursue, without refusing to ratify the Treaty, was simply to ignore them.

Thus was the Treaty ratified at Constantinople in March 1848. The effect of these transactions was to render the work of delimitation impossible, and, after more than two years wasted in barren discussions, to restrict the labours of the Frontier Commission Russian Delegates), which was now appointed, to the mere acquisition of topographical and statistical information. In order to appreciate the extent to which the “ Explanatory Note ” affected the terms of the Treaty, and the conflict of pretensions which of either instrument, in so far as they refer to Mohammerah. The following are the Treaty stipulations :— the town and port of Mohammerah, the island of El Khizr, the anchorage place, and the lands on the eastern, that is the left, bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, which are in possession of tribes recognised as subject to Persia, shall be in possession of the Persian Govern ment in full sovereignty. Besides this, Persian vessels shall have the right to navigate in full liberty the Shatt-el-Arab from the place where it enters the sea to the point of junction of the frontiers of the two parties. The two high Powers will leave once for all, to the free-will of the tribes, whose suzerain is unknown and concerning whom there is a dispute, the right to choose and designate the places where they will henceforward always reside; and it is agreed that the tribes whose allegiance is known will be forced to return to the territory of the State to which they belong.

The Ottoman Government formally undertakes that Article 8 (Extract).late Her Majesty’s Consul at Bagdad, who happens to be here, lias confirmed this statement. But this is a question which must be left to the decision of the commission. It is clear, then, that the Explanatory Note refers in particular to those very lands on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, above Moham- merah, which Lieutenant Wilson and the British Hesident in the Persian Gulf wish now that His Majesty’s Government should claim, at all events in part, as being within the territorial limits of the present Sheikh of Mohammerah; in other words, that His Majesty’s Government should now deny to Turkey possession of those very lands which it was the primary object of the Explanatory Note to secure to her. Whether or not there are factors tending to justify, or even to excuse, such an attitude on the part of His Majesty’s Government will be reserved for discussion in the final part of this memorandum. (C)* The attempt of the Mediating Powers to de marcate the frontier in accordance with the Treaty. Period 1850-52. First aud Second Conferences at Mohammerah, January 28 and 29, 1850. “ Chaldsea and Susiana,” by W. K. Loftus. Owing to various delays the Delimitation Commissioners did not assemble at Mohammerah, to start operations, till January 1850. The British Commissioner was againColonel Williams; the Bussian was Colonel IchirikofF, who subse quently published a book giving his experiences ; and the Ottoman and Persian Commissioners were respectively Dervish Pasha and Mirza Jaffer Khan. The Ottoman Commissioner at the outset pro ceeded to allege proofs of ancient Ottoman suzerainty o\er the tribes in possession near Mohammerah, and recorded his claim to all the country indicated within the green line traced on the annexed map, with the exception only of the walled town of Mohammerah and the island of El Khizr. In most lawyer-like manner he argued, like Portia in the “Merchant of Venice ”:— This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood; The words expressly are, a pound of flesh. then take thy bond,—take thou the pound of flesh. According to the letter of the Treaty, he was content to deliver up the walled town and the [2440 c—10] jj26 island of 111 Kliizr, but not an inch of the sur rounding territory. He claimed, in fact, not only all the territory immediately surrounding tlie town of Moham- merak, but also the extensive country to the east of the island of El Khizr, and he justified his demand by the terms of the Explanatoiy !Note, though, in point of fact, that document was intended by its authors merely to refer to lands above Mohammerah on the Shatt-el-Arak. As an offset to these exorbitant demands, the Persian Commissioner put in his claim as indi cated by the blue line on the same map, on the ground that the country so defined was actually occupied, and had been occupied for untold years, by Persian tribes. The Mediating Commissioners pointed to the terms of the Treaty as being obviously opposed to the isolation of strips of territory belonging to either State within the limits of the other, involving, as it would, the absurdity of a triple boundary to each. Colonel Williams, in a despatch dated the Enclosure 1 in „ .Sir Stratford 4th Eebruary, 1850, reported as loiiows to Canning’s No. 110, 01 . o.. i/. i ^ March 31, 1850. Sir Stratford Canning :— Without discussing, in conference, the merits ot the explanatory note upon which the Porte founds its pretensions, we have sufficiently marked our estimation of it, by the line drawn for the future boundary; my colleague and myself believe that the note has had an interpretation put on it by the Porte which was never contemplated by the parties who drew it up ; its object, as 1 understood at the time, teas to calm the suspicions of the Divan relative to Persian pretensions towards Korna on the Shatt-el-Arab With reference to the line decided on by my colleague and myself for the consideration of Your Excellency and M. de Titow, we have arrived at that conclusion after a careful inspection of the Shatt-el- Arab and the waters flowing into it whilst on board the “ Nitocris ” steamer, Avhere we were fortunate in having the practical knowledge of Captain Jones, her commander ; and, in combating Turkish pretensions to the east of Mohammerah and the island of El Khizr, we have carefully abstained from admitting Persian claims to the islands in the Shatt-el-Arab, all of which lie to the west of those two places :— The enclosed diagram will, I trust, demonstrate the justice of our award. Beginning from the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, the proposed line (marked in red) runs along the western bank of the island of El Khizr, crosses the mouth of the Haffar Canal, and then U p the Shatt-el-Arab to the mouth of the Abu Djudei Canal, a distance of a geographical league [it isDC 27 To Lord Bloomfield, No. 256, July 12 , 1850.

P.] from the Hafiar; and thence in as straight a line as circumstances will admit of to the town and district of Hawiza, passing through the towers named by Dervish Pasha. The Persian pretensions are marked in blue, while those of the Porte will be found traced in green. In this diagram I have omitted the dotted lines which mark the “ supposed frontier ” in the skeleton charts in the possession of your Excellency and the Foreign Office; and I do this to prevent confusion which a number of traces would cause on a diagram which by necessity is so small. Thus we offer to Persia a free entrance to, and security in, her port of Mohammerah, at the same time ensuring to Turkey the navigation of the Shatt-el- Arab by the destruction of the fort (at Feylieh) built by Sheikh Jabir during the conferences of Erzeroum Colonel Williams referred too to the wish of Dervish Pasha for the retention of this fort by the Turks, hut he and his colleague deemed its destruction indispensable.* In the same despatch Colonel Williams ex pressed the view that any other line which the Mediating Commissioners might have proposed would have failed in producing the desired results. Her Majesty’s Government and the Russian Government pronounced in favour of the line of the Mediating Commissioners. The Persian Government, while disposed to forgo its own pretensions, maintained that the line proposed by the Mediating Commissioners ought to be drawn at a place T or 6 miles to the west of Pailieh, near a place called Tamar higher up the Shatt-el-Arab, the argument being that a portion of the Chaab resided on, and was in actual possession of, the land up to the above spot, if not beyond it. * As bearing on this point, it should be mentioned that, Turkey having raised the question, the Persian envoy had written in January 1848 to the British and Russian repre sentatives at Constantinople as follows :— “ Sa Majeste le Schah consent a ce qu’aussi longtemps que la Turqnie ne batira point de fortifications sur la rive droite du Chatt-el-Arab, situee vis-a-vis du territoire persan, la Perse a son tour s’abstiendra d’en construire sur la partie de la rive gauche qui lui revient selon les stipulations du traite.” Mohammerah town was excluded from this prohibition.Colonel Shell, though considering the argu ments of the Persian Government to he in the main well-founded, observed that, on the whole, the advantage and justice of the decision of the Mediating Commissioners seemed so obvious that he had no hesitation in pressing its acceptance on the Persian Government. The Persian Government eventually accepted the delimitation of the frontier according to tbe opinion of tbe Mediating Commissioners, but on condition that the portion of the tribe of Chaab to the west of their line of demarcation should he transferred to Persia. That portion was by the Persian Government estimated at 20,000 souls, and by Colonel Sheil at a smaller number. With reference to this condition, Colonel Williams furnished some additional information as to the motives for the decision of the Mediating Commissioners ; and, inasmuch as the lands in question lie between the 1850 line (that of the Mediating Commissioners) and the boundary as locally observed at the present time (1912) I venture to quote tbe following passage:— The decision we (the Mediating Commissioners) came to on the point of departure from the Shatt-el- Arab was founded on a geographical point unknown to those who framed the Treaty of Erzeroum (1848), and which was clearly stated in the protocols drawn up at Mohammerah, viz., that the large channel on the west side of the island, opposite to Sheikh Jabir’s fort at Failieh, marked in Colonel Chesney’s maps as the channel of navigation from the sea with Bussorah, is now closed except to small boats, and that at the present moment all the traders bound to Bussorah are obliged to take the narrow channel to the east of the island in question, which forces them under the musketry of the fort in question. If, therefore, we had gone up the river twelve miles, the point to which individuals of the Chaab tribe have crept (1 believe in very recent times), we should have placed the port of Bussorah at the mercy of this not very scrupulous Arab tribe, and thus, in placing Persia in the possession of her desired port and anchorage of Mohammerah, we should have denied to the opposite party the same security for its port and city of Bussorah. I can see no reason why the Chaab about Failieh should not, if they like, rejoin their clan; for they do not come under even doubtful allegiance, being a portion of the Chaab or Persian tribe. These reasons Colonel Sheil urged upon the Persian Government as conclusive ; the equal protection of access to Mohammerah and Bussorah Colonel Sheil to Colonel Williams, June 27, 1850. Colonel Williams to Colonel Sheil, September 17, 1850. (See map atp. 25.) Colonel Sheil, No. 162, December 18, 1850.29 Colonel Shell. No. 68 , April 19, 1851. being tlie object of the Mediating Commissioners, it was represented that any other line would have brought the trade of one of the above towns under the control of a rival Power. As regarded the portion of the Chaab tribe remaining to the westward of the Mediating Commissioners’ line, these families did not belong to wandering tribes, living in tents, without any fixed property ; they resided in villages, and were said to be owners of property of some value, particularly in date groves. Their compulsory removal would therefore be a measure of great harshness, which the Mediating Governments could never reconcile with the dictates of justice and humanity. It was therefore proposed by Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran to leave the expatriated portion of the tribe where it was, and to compensate Persia in some other shape for the loss she would suffer. The Ottoman Commissioner and the Sublime Porte absolutely rejected the line of the Mediating Commissioners; and it was agreed, but as a purely provisional arrangement, and expressly pending a final adjustment, to accept the status quo and to proceed with the work of delimitation further north : but a long wrangle took place as to what was the status quo, and nothing precise was generally accepted.31 Part III.— Conclusion. India Office. June 3, 1911. There are two principal points involved in this question, namely, at what place should the boundary be made to strike off from the Shatt- el-Arab, and, until it does strike off from the course of that river, should it he drawn in mid channel, or should it be drawn along the left (eastern) bank. As explained in part I of this memorandum, the British Besident in the Persian Gulf and Lieutenant Wilson, who was Acting Consul for Arabistan, have urged that the boundary should be made to strike off from the Shatt-el-Arab at a place more advantageous to Persia (and the Sheikh of Mohammerah) than a line recom mended by the British and Itussian Mediating Commissioners in 1850, and they have also urged that the boundary should, so long as it follows the course of that river, be drawn in mid channel, and not along the left (Persian) bank as recommended by the Mediating Commissioners. In support of this point of view they advance, amongst other reasons, the argument of long- established usage. The India Office, on reconsideration, supported the views of these Officers in a letter, dated June 1911, from which extracts follow - In so far as concerns the wording of the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847), the Earl of Crewe recognises that it might be taken to imply the right of Turkey to control the Shatt-el-Arab from bank to bank, subject only to free liberty being accorded to Persia to navigate it. This view might find support in the suggestions of the mediating commissioners in 1850, regarding the boundary in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. In this connection I am to solicit reference to the corre spondence ending with this Office letter of the 26th August, 1910, and to say that the Earl of Crewe does not altogether share the opinion of his predecessor on the question therein discussed. That the Turks are in possession of the commissioners’ map, which would appear to assign to them the whole river, is undoubtedly inconvenient, as is also the circumstance that the two Powers pressed the Porte in 1850 to accept the com missioners’ line. But the Porte declined to do so, and in his Lordship’s opinion the situation thus created must be held to be governed by the communication made to them in 1869, when the representatives of the Powers handed in a map on which no line at all was drawn. This identic map seems to have been the lbasis of all subsequent discussions, and Lord Crewe sees no reason for going behind it, or for permitting the Turks to go behind it, to an earlier map, which their own ill-judged action had caused to be superseded. It might further be pointed out to the Turkish Govern ment, if necessary, that by their rejection of the line proposed in 1850 they have allowed a situation to grow for sixty years in which mid-channel has, without challenge, been accepted by local usage as the boundary, and that this is consequently the status quo on the observance of which His Majesty’s Government must insist. As regards the approaches to the Shatt-el-Arab, as distinct from the channel, there may be presumed to be no question but that Turkish and Persian rights are regulated by general considerations of international law, instead of exceptional treaty stipulations. Subject, therefore, to any observations of Secretary Sir E. Grey, Lord Crewe does not consider that, as between Turkey and Persia, the case presents any special difficulty. . . .* With the last paragraph of the above extract this memorandum is not primarily concerned. I propose to deal firstly with the question of the point where the boundary should leave the river, and secondly with the question of whether, while following the course of the river, it should he traced in mid-channel or on the Persian hank. It will be noticed that the India Office admits, in the above letter, that it is somewhat incon venient that Turkey is in possession of a copy of the map of 1850, and also that Great Britain and Ilussia urged her to accept the Mediating Com missioners’ line. But the arguments advanced are, first, that the Mediating Commissioners’ line of 1850 was cancelled and superseded by the com munication made some twenty years or so later that the boundary would be found somewhere within the limits of a certain zone about 40 miles in width ; and, second, that His Majesty’s Government might, if necessary, point out to Turkey that a different boundary to that pro posed in 1850 had, as a matter of fact, been locally observed without challenge for sixty years, and that this consequently is the status quo on the observance of which His Majesty's Govern ment must now insist. * The India Office letter was written before the proposal for a reference of the Turco-Persian frontier dispute to The Hague Tribunal had been finally adopted. My memorandum refers to the questions involved not so much from the point of diplomatic negotiation as from what seems likely to be the purely legal standpoint.—A. PThe “ zone” argument. 33 Por facility of reference, the first argument may be designated that of the zone, and the second that of the status quo. It may also be remarked here that the two lines of frontier, that of the Mediating Commissioners and the one locally recognised, are, at the point where they leave the river, about 6 ^ miles apart, and that both are within the limits of the above-mentioned zone. The argument of the India Office that the Mediating Commissioners’ line has been can celled is based on what took place subsequent to 1850, the diplomatic transactions prior to that date being altogether ignored. Now the Mediating Commissioners proposed a line at another point on the frontier, in the district of Zohab, much further north : and it may, perhaps, be conceded that, in regard to the line drawn at Zohab, the recommendation of the Mediating Commissioners has been superseded by tbe communication made some twenty years later that the boundary would be found somewhere within the zone 40 miles wide. Be this as it may, the case of the line recom mended by the Mediating Commissioners in the Mohammerah district is essentially different, owing to the special negotiations which took place in regard to that particular district before the Mediating Commissioners proposed their line in ]850. These antecedent negotiations were succinctly as follows :—• Article 2 of the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847) contained a clause providing that “ the town and port of Mohammerah, the island of El Khizr, the anchorage place, and the lands on the eastern, that is the left, bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, which are in possession of tribes recognised as subject to Persia, shall be in possession of the Persian Government in full sovereignty. Besides this, Persian vessels shall have the right to navigate in full liberty the Shatt-el-Arab from the place where it enters the sea to the point of junction of the frontiers of the two parties.” Before signing this treaty, Turkey insisted on receiving assurances inter alia as to the meaning of the above provision, and, before she would ratify it, she required that the Persian Envoy at Constantinople should accept them formally, which he did in a written note and “in virtue [2440 c—10] K isof the mission entrusted to him by his Govern ment,” and that the British and Bussian Representatives should embody them in an “Explanatory Note.” One of these assurances was to the effect that, beyond the places specifically named in the treaty, Turkey did not cede in the Mohammerah district any lands or ports. Another of the assurances was to the effect that Persia could not in any case put forward a valid claim to lands situated on the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, nor to lands belonging to Turkey on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, even if those lands w r ere occupied in w T hole or in part by Persian tribes. The upshot of all this seems to be that the treaty allotted to Persia such lands on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab as were in possession of Persian tribes : the “ Explanatory Note,” or assurances, provided explicitly that the mere fact of occupation by Persian tribes did not, per ac propter se, and in the absence of some territorial right of ownership, confer upon Persia a valid •claim. There were certain lands, above Mohammerah and on the left side of the Shatt-el-Arab, which were cultivated and dwelt upon by Persian tribes; but Turkey maintained that rent for such lands was paid to the Government of Bussorah ; and that they were accordingly Turkish territory. The British Representative at Constantinople, in commenting on the assurances subsequently embodied in the “ Explanatory Note,” asserted, in a despatch to Lord Palmerston, that they were nothing more than a repetition of what was already in the treaty. “We have” he wrote, “ not specified which is Turkish territory: w r e have merely declared that what is Turkish territory is to remain so; but it will be the business of the Commission to be appointed hereafter to settle the exact spot where Turkish property ends and Persian begins.” (It may be thought that Lord Cowley w r as rash in stating that the “ Explanatory Note ” was a mere repetition of what was in the treaty: indeed Sir S. Canning, who had been absent at the time it was drawn up, was compelled to admit that the terms of it, taken literally, did imply a limitation of the treaty which it was equally difficult to reject on clear grounds of right, or to admit with any degree of satisfaction ; Mr. Wellesley (afterwards Lord Cowley), No. 115, April 2, 1847.Mr. Wellesley (afterwards Lord Cowley), No. 48, February 3, 1847. First and Second Conferences at Mohammerah, January 28 and 29, 1850, Enclosures 2 and 3 in Sir Stratford Canning’s No. 1 10, March 30, 1850. but be added that the note, being of an explana tory character, could not be supposed to change the very nature of the treaty, as contended by Turkey. The primary object of the explanations given was, according to Lord Cowley’s own account, to reassure the Porte on two points : it wished to have the anchorage ground of Mohammerah more accurately defined, and it was apprehensive that, under the wording of article 2 of the treaty, it risked losing a large portion of territory if it were to be inferred that territory was to be given over to Persia merely because it was occupied by tribes calling them selves Persian.) Now when the Delimitation Commission did meet at Mohammerah in 1850, both the Persian and the Turkish Delegates put forward extravagant claims; the latter based his claims on the ‘ £ Explanatory Note,” while the former declined to be bound by anything but the Treaty, con tending that the Persian Envoy at Constantinople had acted without authority in adhering to the “Explanatory Note”: the Mediating Commis sioners recommended a line which Persia accepted conditionally, and Turkey rejected altogether. The line proposed by the Mediating Com missioners is important, inasmuch as it represents, except in so far as proof may be adduced to the contrary, what was the conclusion of the Mediating Commissioners on the important question of where, in the year 1850, Persian territory ended and Turkish territory began. In other words, it was the impartial interpretation, and practical application of the terms of the Treaty of Erzeroum,and of the “Explanatory Note” by the Mediating Commissioners on the spot. 'Whatever arguments may be adduced in favour of the abandonment by His Majesty’s Govern ment of the line proposed by their own Com missioner in 1850, and in favour of their support of a line less advantageous to Turkey, there seems little reason to expect that the Hague Tribunal, whose award must expressly be based on the Treaty of Erzeroum, will readily set aside such leading evidence. His Majesty’s Government have cordially supported the proposal for submitting the Turco-Persian frontier dispute to the Hague Tribunal; and since Turkey, in negotiating last year for a reference to the Hague, laid special emphasis upon the diplomatic correspondence36 which passed at the time of the Treaty of Erzeroum—a correspondence which relates, in particular, to Mohammerah—a refusal on the part of His Majesty’s Government now to countenance a reference of the Mohammerah question to the Hague, or to abide by an adverse award, would be an attitude perhaps difficult to justify as wholly consistent. The argument advanced by the India Office that the Mediatirg Commissioners’ line cannot now be appealed to, owing to events which have subsequently taken place, seems therefore diffi cult, if not impossible, to sustain as a purely judicial proposition, so long as that line stands out as a strict interpretation of the Treaty of 1847 and the “Explanatory Note,” or indeed merely of the former instrument alone. It would seem to follow that what I have termed the “ zone ” argument in the India Office letter is unlikely to prevail before the Hague Tribunal unless the authority of the Mediating Commis sioners’ line can be undermined by a clear and convincing demonstration that it was not in point of fact a strict interpretation of the express terms, as distinct from the supposed object, of the Treaty and the “Explanatory Note.” It is therefore desirable to examine the motives which determined the line recommended by the Mediating Commissioners : before doing so, it will not be out of place 1 o remark that Turkey had claimed every inch of territory above the actual town of Mohammerah, while Persia had claimed the whole left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab above Mohammerah (the Haffar Channel) to a point some twenty miles or so above Bussorah. The independent evidence at the disposal of the Mediating Commissioners had been furnished in the main by Major Bawlinson and his pre decessor at Bagdad: they had both indicated that the lands on the left bank of the Shatt-el- Arab above Mohammerah were, for the most part, laid out in gardens and date groves dependent on Bussorah, and Major Hawlinson had, after a care ful inspection, reported in 1844 that about three miles of territory above Mohammerah (the Haffar Channel) was dependent on Persia, that then for four miles there was land inhabited by a Persian tribe (the Chaabees) but paying revenue to Turkey, and thence right into Bussorah the entire territory was possessed by Turkish tribes.37 Colonel Williams to Colonel Sheil, September 17, 1850. Colonel Sheil (Tehran), No. 35, March 25, 1850. Colonel Sheil to Colonel Williams, June 27, 1850. Before Colonel Williams left Constantinople in 1849 to delimit the frontier, he had prepared a map embracing the supposed line of the whole 1 rentier from the Persian Gulf to Mount Ararat according to the treaty, and, he wrote, “ that portion of the line in the vicinity of Moham- merah I presume to be a near approximation to truth.” The line in this map of 1849 leaves the Shatt-el-Arab at a point 5^- miles or so above the Haffar Channel (Mohammerah) : that actually proposed by the Mediating Com missioners in 1850 left the Shatt-el-Arab at a point about 2J- miles above the ITafPar Channel. It is not quite clear why Colonel Williams had selected 5g miles above the ITaffar Channel as the point whence to start his line in the map he had prepared in 1849; but the reason why the Mediating Commissioners eventually, in 1850, selected a place 2 |- instead of 5 ^ miles above the Haffar Channel was that they apprehended danger to navigation for Bussorah if a certain fort, built by the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and the land in its immediate neighbourhood, were left to Persia. This decision gave rise to a protest from Persia, who claimed that the frontier ought at least to have started from a place four or six miles further up the river, on the ground that it was in actual possession of a tribe dependent on Persia. The Persian Government eventually accepted, how ever, the line proposed by the Mediating Com missioners, on condition that the Persian tribesmen outside the Mediating Commissioners’ line for a distance of six miles or so should be transferred to Persia; but as this condition was considered impossible of execution, it was sought to give Persia compensation in another direction : this compensation was after wards awarded to her by the line proposed by the Mediating Commissioners at Zohab, and although the line at Zohab was never accepted by Turkey any more than the Mediating Commissioners’ line at Mohammerah, Persia does, in point of fact, still hold the land near Zohab allotted to her by the Mediating Commis sioners, and apparently a good deal more besides. It appears that, if Turkey should now claim the frontier line proposed by the Mediating Com missioners at ^lohammerah on the ground that [2440 c- 10 ] L38 it is more advantageous to her than the one she now holds by usage, we can furnish Persia with an argument which would carry weight with the Hague Tribunal: we can point to the protocols of the conferences held at Mohammerah in 1850 and, without going too precisely into distances, we can represent that the decision of the Mediating Commissioners was influenced by a very laudable consideration—the security of navigation to Bussorah—but one which was not enjoined expressis verbis in either the treaty or the “ Explanatory Note ”; that therefore the line of the Mediating Commissioners cannot wholly and in its entire length be regarded as the precise interpretation of the treaty; that the failure of Turkey to accept the line proposed by the Mediating Commissioners, and the consequent control by the Sheikh of Mohammerah of land which was to he allotted to Turkey, has served to demonstrate, during a period of sixty years, that the apprehensions of the Mediating Commissioners as to a possible danger to shipping for Bussorah were unfounded; and, finally, that the Persian Court as early as 1850 protested against the ruling of the Mediating Commissioners on the ground that the Chaabees, its subjects, not only resided on, but were in actual territorial possession of, the land almost up to what is now (1912) locally recognised as the frontier (though, on the impartial evidence of Major Bawlinson, it can hardly be said that their claim to it all was very strong!); and that, in view of all this, the only frontier which, in strict accordance with treaty stipulation, can be regarded as the correct one is that locally recognised, which leaves the river six miles or so to the westward of the line of the Mediating Commissioners. These are the difficulties involved in the “zone” argument of the India Office letter ; the other argument advanced, that of the status quo, will also appear, on closer scrutiny, to be hedged round with perplexing and exceptional limita tions. Nothing seems simpler at first sight and more The status quo equitable than the argument that 60 years or aigument ' more of continued occupation and unchallenged administration should confer a right to territory; and the argument appears still more convincing when it is shown that the frontier enclosing such territory has been de facto tacitly accepted by the r39 Enclosmes in Sir Stratford Canning’s No. 391, December 31 1851. local authorities on both sides for a similar period of time. 4 ' When the line proposed in 1850 by the Mediating Commissioners in the Mohammerah district was rejected by the Porte, it was with the utmost difficulty that the Ottoman and Persian Governments were induced to accept, for the nonce, the actual status quo, —as to the definition of which there was every conceivable disagree ment,—and allow the Commission to proceed with its work further north. This arrangement was, however, ultimately accepted in 1851 in writing, but with the most explicit reservations that it was provisional, and merely pending a final settlement. As is well known, no final settlement has ever been reached ; but in 1869 an incident arose in regard to another portion of the frontier, and a formal Convention was concluded between Turkey and Persia, in that year, providing that:— Le reglement du statu quo, qui a 4te adopte de part et d’autre lors de Tenquete des Commissaires des quatre Gouvernements an sujet des lieux litigieux des frontieres, doit etre maintenu tel quel jusqu’a une delimitation definitive . . . (Article 2.) .... L’administration ne sera point provable comme de droit et lesdits lieux litigieux ne seraient aucune- ment par cela consid^res des proprietes acquises. (Article 3.) Aucune construction a I’avenir ne sera 41evee sous aucune denomination que ce soit dans les lieux en litige qui se trouvent a Tadministration de Tune et de 1’autre partie ; et toutes cedes qui out eu lieu jusqu’a ce jour, aussi que toutes les marques ^et indices de limite, ne seront 4 la delimitation definitive aucunement consid^rees comme preuves de droit et de propriete acquises (sic). (Article 4.) Cette convention provisoire sera observe scrupuleuse- ment jusquA la delimitation definitive des frontieres, sans annuler neanmoins toutes les reclamations et protestations echangees de part et d’autre au sujet des lieux en question et des constructions y ^levees, qui toutes gardent leur effet et vigueur. (Article 7 .) In the face of these explicit and formal reserva tions, it seems doubtful whether the Hague * It is said, on the authority of a confidential agent of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, that the boundary as locally re cognised was “ fixed ” in 1880 by representatives of the Bussorah and Mohammerah authorilies, but this statement lacks definite confirmation; the agreement may only have been verbal, and in any case it appears to have been one merely between the local authorities. ( Vide Lieutenant Wilson’s prdcis on Arabistan, dated March 1911, p. 51. A,Tribunal is likely to endorse the principle of uti possidetis, especially in so far as possession only dates from, and not prior to, the Treaty of Erzeroum (1848). Now the only impartial evidence as to what ought to he considered the status quo at the date of the Treaty of Erzeronm, and of where Turkish territory ended and Persian began, is afforded by the line drawn by the Mediating Commissioners in 1850, and therefore I submit that the efforts of His Majesty’s Government should be directed to the acceptance of that line as the basis of negotiation, except in so far as it can be demonstrated not to have been in strict conformity with the express terms of the Treaty: it is clear that the Mediating Commissioners made a departure from the express terms of the Treaty when they drew the line to the east of Sheikh Jabir’s fort (at Failieh) instead of a few T miles to the west. If we do not adopt the Mediating Commis sioners’ line, with this slight modification, as the basis of negotiation, there seems some degree of danger that Turkey may revive some of her earlier extravagant claims. It seems incon ceivable that that line should not weigh, as impartial evidence, with the Hague Tribunal to such an extent as to preclude that danger; and it accordingly appears to be to the interest of Great Britain to uphold the line except only in so far as it does demonstrably deviate from the treaty expressis verbis. So much for the first question—that of the precise place w r here the boundary should leave the river; the second question is, whether the boundary, while following the course of the river, should he traced in mid-channel or on the Persian hank. In 1844 Sir Stratford Canning wrote that the Persians could not navigate any part of the Shatt-el-Arab without being liable to the duties levied on shipping and merchandise by the Ottoman authorities. In the negotiations which preceded the Treaty of Erzeroum, Turkey took very great pains to record her assertion of sovereign rights over the entire waters of the Shatt-el-Arab, and, although there is no clause in the treaty to that effect, the Porte did maintain to the British and Bussian representatives at Constantinople that it only agreed to negotiate about Mohammerah on the understanding that the course of the river Sir Stratford Canning, No. 239, November 1,1844.

Mas still to belong wholly and exclusively to Turkey, and it contended that it merely granted freedom of passage to Persian vessels in the projected treaty; and, in order to secure this right, it was required that no fortifications should he erected on any part of the river banks remain ing in the possession of Persia. The British and Bussian Governments at first held that the claim of Turkey to the sole sove reignty of the Shatt-el-Arab was inadmissible, and Lord Palmerston wrote early in 1847 to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh :— I have to state to you, with reference to the pre tension which has been advanced by the Porte to an absolute right of sovereignty over the Shatt-el-Arab, that when the opposite banks of a river belong, as they do in the case of the lower portion of the Shatt-el- Arab, to different Powers, it would be contrary to international usage to give one of the two Powers the exclusive sovereignty of that portion of the course of such river, and that therefore this proposal of the Turkish Government seems to be inadmissible. But this despatch of Lord Palmerston’s was written before the text of the treaty, as eventually signed, had been definitely accepted, and also before the Poreign Office, in the absence of telegraphic communication, was aware of the full bearing and origin of the assurances which, at a later stage, were embodied in the “ Explana tory Note.” The text of the relevant clause of article 2 has been given above (see p. 23): and it is clear that the Porte would not have agreed to the treaty had it anticipated that its sovereignty over the entire waters of the Shatt-el-Arab would be jeopardised; indeed, it was probably in order to provide against such a con tingency that it requested, and received in the &lt;c Explanatory Note,” and in a memorandum of earlier date, a more clear definition of what was meant by the anchorage place of Mohammerah. That, after the Treaty of Erzeroum had been signed and ratified, Turkey was, according to the view of the Mediating Powers, entitled to sovereignty over the entire waters of the Shatt- el-Arab, is shown by the map prepared by Colonel Williams in 1849 to indicate the modifi cations in the frontier effected by the treaty : this map draws the line not in mid-channel but on the left (Persian) bank of the Shatt-el-Arab. [2440 c—10] M42 It is true tliat in 1850 the Persian Commis sioner did claim medium jUum aqua as against the claim of the Turkish Commissioner to sovereignty over the whole river; hut the Mediating Com missioners supported the Ottoman Commissioner on this point, thereby affording evidence of the true purport of the treaty provision ; and the recommendation of the Mediating Commissioners was afterwards endorsed hy the British and Bussian Governments. The treaty secures to Persia full freedom of navigation on the lower portion of the river ; hut the Porte as recently as 1911 urged that this, on the principle of construction uniua expressio exclusio alterius, in itself implies Turkish owner ship of the entire waters. It would seem that the only consideration which could he urged in favour of medium jilum aqua as the boundary, is that the Bamishere Channel, which at the time of the Treaty formed an alterna tive means of access to the Karun, is now no longer navigable ; hut it is a moot point how far this change would he held to modify the legal position. I assume that, if the case goes to The Hague Tribunal, Turkey might present her claim to ownership of the entire waters of the Shatt-el- Arab somewhat on the following lines :— («) Expressum facit cessare taciturn : the treaty gave Persia freedom of navigation and, by the very fact of granting liberty to navigate, the possession by Persia of any other right is im plicitly denied. (b) In regard to territorial possession, the treaty allotted to Persia the town and port of Moham- merah, the island of El Khizr, the anchorage place, and, conditionally, certain lands on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab. But the treaty did not allot to Persia anything else in the Mohammerah district either claimed or owned by Turkey. That Turkey claimed full sovereignty over the Shatt-el-Arab was emphasised in the negotiations preceding the conclusion of the treaty; that she did own the river prior to the conclusion of the treaty is proved, firstly, by the fact that the Persians could not navigate any part of it without being liable to the duties levied on shipping and merchandise by the Ottoman authorities; and, -t) rsecondly, by the fact that in 1850 the Mediating Commissioners endorsed the claim advanced by the Ottoman Commissioner to exclusive ownership. As regards British interests in this matter, it will he recollected that we proposed to the Porte in July 1911, as part of the general settlement of our respective interests in the region of the Persian Gulf, that a small Commission, consist ing of a Turkish member, a British member, and an engineer, should he appointed to control navigation in the Shatt-el-Arab. In the infor mal negotiations which have taken place during the last few days, the Turkish delegates have intimated, on behalf of their Government, that Turkey is prepared to agree to this Commission in principle, subject to its being nominally Ottoman ; subject to a Convention being con cluded regulating, in accordance with the general requirements of shipping, all points of importance; and subject to it being definitely agreed that there should be only Turkish and British representation on the Commission. Their alleged reason for wishing the Commis sion to be nominally Ottoman w r as to exclude the applications which might be made for representation from inconvenient quarters if it were international. It seems then that Britisli interests have nothing to gain from pressing the argument medium filurn aquce. It is true that the Anglo-Turkish negotiations for a riverain commission may break down : but even so, the position of His Majesty’s Govern ment in upholding British shipping interests would not be appreciably weakened by sacrificing the Persian claim, which in any case does not seem a strong one, to mid-channel. The conclusions to which this enquiry leads are then that His Majesty’s Government would be well-advised:— 1 . To urge as a general basis of nego tiation the Mediating Commissioners’ line of 1850. 2. To urge the strict observance of that line from the sea to Pailieh, thus making the frontier the left bank of Abadan Island and not the mid-channel of the Shatt-el-Arab. 3. To urge the modification of that line at Pailieh so as to include 6 |- miles more territory44 to the west, so as to extend to the boundary as locally observed, and so as to include the palace, court-house, and prison, of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. I would suggest that we should lay before the Russian Government these three conclusions supported by the necessary arguments; that we should propose that the two Ambassadors at Constantinople should be instructed to advise the Persian Delegates on the Turco Persian Commission now sitting to continue to press the Turkish delegates to reveal the extent of the Turkish claims near Mohammerah; that similar advice should he given hy Great Britain and Russia at Tehran; and that Sir G. Lowther should he instructed to intimate in a friendly and informal manner to the Turkish Minister for Poreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Govern ment, as his Excellency is aware, attach great importance to the maintenance of the status quo at Mohammerah, as locally observed, and that they feel persuaded that the Ottoman Govern ment, who have shown such a conciliatory spirit in the negotiations now being opened in London, will take their wishes into favourable consideration. I would submit that this mode of procedure is, for the time being, preferable to a flat declaration that His Majesty’s Government could not abide by an award of the Hague Tribunal if it tended to upset the status quo at Mohammerah ; and the course of action suggested associates Russia with His Majesty’s Government in so far as advice to Persia is concerned, while it avoids the risk of offence which might be caused to Turkey by joint representations from Great Britain and Russia, and the consequent probability of failure. There is another important question relating to Mohammerah which is not unlikely to be discussed in the course of the present negotiations at Constantinople, and that is the position of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in regard to the exercise of jurisdiction over members of the Chaab tribe resident in territory on the right bank of the river, which is admittedly Turkish; but this matter is relatively less urgent, and is therefore reserved for a separate memorandum. There is also a point which I have not brought out earlier. After leaving the Shatt-el-xArab, the45 * In bis despatch dated May 26, 1909, Lieutenant Wilson writes that lack of exact geographical knowledge renders it impossible to lay down the limits of Ilawizah territory with certainty, but that the sheikh’s claims extend “ 6 to 8 farsakhs west of Ilawizah” : but in a despatch dated March 12 , 1910, he writes of the frontier line as locally observed as being only k ‘ some 10 miles west of Hawizah,”—A. P. [2440 c—10] N boundary proposed by the Mediating Commis sioners proceeds, in as straight a line as circum stances will permit, across the desert towards Hawizah (see map opposite p. 37). Lieutenant Wilson urges that it ought to extend, according to the claims of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, fl^elman^No 7 169 some twenty-five miles or so to the west of September 9,1909. that town; that the irrigation system does extend to the west of that town for 16 miles; and that it is occupied by tribes tributary to the Yali of Hawizah. He represents that as the Mediating Commissioners’ line bisects the territory of the Yali of Hawizah, it would be impossible for His Majesty’s Government to urge it upon the Sheikh of Mohammerah. or the Persian Government, the more so since the turbulent Beni Turuf tribe would be placed partly in Turkish territory.* I submit that if His Majesty’s Government procure a deviation from the Mediating Com missioners’ line to the extent of 6 ^ miles on the Shatt-el-Arab (so as to include the Sheikh’s palace, &amp;c.), they will have secured the most important point; it seems, however, altogether outside the range of practical politics to expect Turkey either willingly to abandon, or His Majesty’s Government forcibly to compel her to give up, such an extensive district to the west of the Mediating Commissioners’ line in the north ; the Sheikh of Mohammerah, moreover, already has to a certain extent under his control a number of tribesmen, believed to aggregate 75,000, on the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab in what is incontestably Turkish territory ; it is doubtful how far he is really entitled by treaty to exercise such control ; but, be this as it may, if he does exercise control over his tribesmen on the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, there seems no primd facie reason why those in the region of Hawizah should not be on a similar footing. There might be some difficulties of irrigation ; but they could probably be adjusted by mutual agreement. The Sheikh of Mohammerah is a wealthylandowner, and much of his property is in Turkey ; hut it seems most undesirable that His Majesty’s Government should encourage him in a policy of gradual territorial encroachment by means of purchasing real estate. It is, moreover, important to hear in mind that the assurances conveyed in the “ Explanatory Note ” were intended in part to guard against an undue extension of Persian claims to the w^est.

British Assurances given to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, 1899 and 1902-10. IN November 1899, when Sir H. M. Durand, Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, visited the Karan, the Sheikh of Mohammerah, who had been anxious to obtain guarantees relative to the independence of his territories in certain eventualities, submitted a request for assurances. Sir H. M. Durand thereupon instructed Colonel Meade, British Besident in the Persian Gulf, to make a communication to him to the effect that— we cannot, of course, undertake to maintain the sheikh against the Persian Government, nor can we say that, if the Persian Government breaks up, we can guarantee his independence. Our Government does not, I imagine, contemplate such a contingency. But we can tell him that we consider him the most influential person in this part of the world, and we intend as far as possible to support him, believing that it is for the interest of the country that he should be strong. If ever he wants our advice we will give it. In return we expect he will help us in matters of trade and the like. As to the Customs withdrawal from Mohammerah, I will do all I can to help him. He may rely upon our good-will at all times, and upon our help whenever we can give it without ill-faith to the Persian Government.* Cn the 7th December, 1902, Sir A. Hardinge, the British Minister at Tehran, addressed a letter to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, in the course of which he stated that the British Government had authorised him to say that— we shall protect Mohammerah against naval attack by a foreign Power, whatever pretext for such action may be alleged, and also, so long as you remain faithful to the Shah and act in accordance with our advice, shall continue to give you our good offices and support. The full text of this note is as follows :— I write to inform you, my honoured friend, of my return to Tehran from Europe and to enquire after your health. It was a great disappointment to me that I was unable to visit you this spring, but, as you know, I was obliged to go to England instead. I hope, however, that it may be possible for me at no distant date to have the pleasure of making your personal acquaintance. I was very glad to hear from Hajji Reis-ut-Tujjar of the satisfactory arrangement concluded between you and the Department of Customs. On general grounds of policy it is very desirable that differences should as far as possible be avoided between the Persian authorities and the Arab tribes under your rule. The relations between the British and Persian Governments are of a friendly character, and the preservation of the integrity and independence of^ the Persian monarchy has for many years been one of the great objects of British policy in this part of the world. Disturbances of a nature to imperil that object would be a serious evil, and you would gain little and might endanger much by throwing off the sovereignty of the Shah. I am convinced that, under present circumstances, the Arabs, and yourself as their ruler, have every interest in cultivating good and loyal relations with the Government of Tehran, and that the latter has no desire to oppress you or curtail your authority. For this reason I think you acted wisely in giving up all idea of forcible resistance to the establishment of a custom-house, and in seeking rather to come, as I have from the first urged you to do, to a friendly understanding on the subject with the Customs Administration. Hajji Reis-ut-Tujjar asked me on your behalf to what extent you might rely on the protection of the British Government, and I told him that so long as you behaved to us, as you have done in the past, in a friendly manner, our influence would be exerted here to maintain you and your tribes in the enjoyment of your hereditary rights and customs, and to dissuade the Government of Tehran from any endeavour to diminish or interfere with them. Hajji Reis thereupon said that you were not afraid of the Persian Government itself, nor of attack by neighbouring tribes acting or professing to act under its orders; but that you wished to know whether we should protect you in the event of an attempt by a foreign Power to depose you or deprive your people of the rights which they at present possess. This might happen in two ways: either such a foreign Power might be at war with Persia, and might, as an enemy of the Shah, send ships to attack your district; or such a Power, pretending to be the friend of the Persian Government or to act on its behalf, might attempt, also by means of its ships, to conquer you and the Arabs. Sir A. Hardinge to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. (After compliments.) December 7, 1902. I replied that both contingencies were extremely unlikely, but if either were to arise we should, I * Enclosure in Mr. Spring-Rice No. 15, March 20, 1900.believed, interfere, provided you had acted in accordance with our advice ; and our fleet, which is the strongest of any in the Gulf, would be employed to prevent any forcible measures against you. I stated, however, that I would refer these questions to the Foreign Minister of the British Government, and he has now authorised me to say that we shall protect Mohammerah against naval attack by a foreign Power, whatever pretext for such action may be alleged, and also, so long as you remain faithful to the Shah and act in accordance with our advice, shall continue tf^ give you our good offices and support. As I have, however, said above, I do not regard the danger—at any rate, at present—as a real one. The Persian Government desires, I am sure, as earnestly as you do, the preservation of peace in Arabistan, and the establishment of a custom-house at Mohammerah is, as l assured you last year, a fiscal, not a political, measure. It has already informed me in a friendly spirit of the conditions under which the new arrangement has been made, and the British Government has instructed me to intimate its acquiescence in them. We reserve, of course, our right to object to any further change which we may consider likely, as affecting peace and trade on the Karun, to be detrimental to our interests. 1 trust that the new arrangement may work smoothly. There will be very likely some small difficulties and friction at first, but I trust to your wisdom and judgment to deal with them prudently and patiently. Our consul has my orders to afford you all help and advice, and you may place every reliance on my friendship. You can write to me freely should you wish to do so, as well as to the Resident at Bushire. Arthur PI. Hardinge. The assurances given in the foregoing letter were confirmed in a further note from Sir A. Hardinge to the sheikh, dated the 21rd December, 1903. The following is the text of this note :— Sir A. Hardinge to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. (After compliments.) Your Excellency, Bagdad, December 24, 1903. I have received a telegram in reply to the one to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from Mohammerah, after my first interview with your Excellency. Lord Lansdowne says that if, as he presumes is the case from my account of your Excellency’s statement to me, the Persian Government is really attempting to repudiate the arrangement made with you last year, I am authorised to say that you are, in his opinion, justified in opposing such attempt. He instructs me to remind you of the message which he sent you last year, and to add that you may rest assured of the support of the British Government so long as you on your side observe the conditions of the arrangement made between the Persian Government and yourself. He has authorised me to point out to that Government the necessity for respecting the conditions of the arrangement on their side. I do not propose to do so until 1 hear further from you, as I think it will be better in the interests of good relations between the Persian authorities and yourself that our intervention should not be invoked until all other means of adjusting matters directly between them and you have been exhausted. Meanwhile, I should be obliged if you would send me to Tehran, through Plis Majesty’s resident at Bushire, a copy of the note from M. Nans, promising not to tape duty on your personal imports, and any further information on the subject. I have, &amp;c. Arthur H. Hardinge. On the 1 st December, 1908, Major Cox, consul-general at Bushire and British resident in the Persian Gulf, in pursuance of instructions received from Tehran, addressed a note to the sheikh repeating the assurances previously given in 1902 by Sir A. Hardinge and extending them to the sheikh’s successors. This note was thus worded:— Consul-General Cox to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. (After compliments.) December 1, 1908. After enquiry after your welfare and congratulations on the satisfactory conclusion of your business with the Arab tribes, I have the honour to inform you that 1 duly communicated to Government all that passed at the interview which I and our friend Mr. McDouall had with your Excellency on the 7th January last, and also placed before them the statement of Govern ment expenditure subsequently received from you through Mr. McDouall. The reply of His Majesty’s Government reached me through His Majesty’s Legation in September last, but, in view of the importance of the subject and the insecurity of the post, I thought it best to delay addressing you until my return to head-quarters On arrival here I learnt of your own absence in Arabistan, and have since waited for your return to Failieh. I am directed to repeat, on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, the assurances given to your Excellency in the letter of His Majesty’s Minister, Sir Arthur Hardinge, dated the 7th December, 1902, which is in your possession, and the terms of which I repeated to you at ourinterview above referred to, and I am then to add that His Majesty’s Government now extend those assurances to yonr successors. I am further to point out that His Majesty’s Government have engaged to respect the independence and integrity of Persia, and to explain that that undertaking involves the main tenance of the status quo in that country, and includes the continuance of the state of autonomy ,jvhich your Excellency at present enjoys. ^ It follows from the above that any external aggression upon your Excellency would constitute an infringement of Persian integrity which is recognised by the terms of the Anglo-Russian Convention. Trusting to have an opportunity of repeating the foregoing assurances in person at an early date, I am, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Major, British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General for Pars, &amp;c. The amplified assurances conveyed to the sheikh in the foregoing note were further extended in a letter dated the 16th May, 1909, addressed to the sheikh hy Major Cox, acting in accordance with instructions received by him. This letter was as follows:— Consul-General Cox to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. (After the usual compliments.) Mohammerah, May 16, 1909. On the 1st December, 1908, I had the honour, by the direction of His Majesty’s Government, to repeat to your Excellency the assurances given you on behalf of Government by his Excellency Sir Arthur Hardinge, British Minister at Tehran, in his letter of the 7th December, 1902, to your address, and to inform you that the British Government were now prepared to extend those assurances to your successors. I was further directed to explain to you that the British Government had engaged to respect the integrity and independence of Persia, and that that undertaking in itself involved the maintenance of the status quo in Persia, and thus included the continuance cf the same state of autonomy which your Excellency at present enjoys. I was then to point out that it followed from the above that any external aggression upon your Excellency would constitute an act of infringement of that Persian integrity which has received recognition in the Anglo-Russian Convention. While expressing your thanks for these amplified assurances, you represented that they seemed to you only to safeguard you so long as Persia continued to exist as a sovereign State, and you pressed for a further assurance which would cover the contingency of Persia ceasing to exist as a sovereign State and the intervention or occupation by foreign Powers. You also expressed doubt as to whether the present assurance only provided immunity against unwarrantable encroachment on your rights by the absolute government of His Majesty the Shah, or whether it also covered prevention of similar action on the part of parliamentary government. In reply to those representations, your Excellency was informed that Great Britain and Russia being pledged to respect the integrity of Persia, the British Government were not, properly speaking, able to admit even the possibility of Persia ceasing to be a sovereign State or coming under the occupation of a foreign Power, but that in the unlikely event of such a contingency the assurances already given to your Excellency would, become even more binding- than before. I was further permitted to inform you that whatever change might take place in the form of government in Persia the British Government were prepared to give you the same support against any encroachment on your rights as was promised to you in 1902, and I was authorised to add that they were now prepared to extend the application of those assurances to your “ heirs and successors.” Mr. McDouall and I have informed you that in our opinion the assurances as now extended and expressed, appear to satisfy all your requirements; but you have further requested that the Avords “ heirs and successors ” may be changed and the words “ owrrsuccessive male descendants ” may be written instead; and you have gone on to express the hope that His Majesty’s Govern ment will be pleased to dispel the last shadow of doubt from your mind regarding their own intentions in the future, by adding after the words “male descendants ” as above, the words “ up to a period of 100 years ” (or if it be possible 150 years). I cannot give your Excellency any reply on this point without reference to Government, but I will lose no time in communicating to them your representations. I have, &amp;c. P. Z.

The assurances given on this occasion were not confined to the sheikh hut extended to his male descendants.

EDWARD PARKES. Foreign Office, April 1912.—fc fcw |—if^ 52 APPENDIX (C). Extract from “ Layard’s Early Adventures” Vol. 2, pp. 431-439. [Edition pnblisEed in London in 1887.] SOON after my return to Constantinople from my mission to the Western Provinces of European Turkey, the joint mediation offered by the English and Russian Governments to Turkey and Persia to prevent a war, which was then on the point of breaking out between them, was accepted by the two Powers. Sir Stratford Canning was thus able to carry out his intention of availing himself of the knowledge I had acquired during my travels in Mesopotamia and Khuzistan, and to employ me in the correspondence and negotiations which took place. The principal matters in dispute were certain parts of the frontiers between the two States. Persia claimed the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, or united waters of the Tigris and Euphrates, from about sixty miles of their junction with the Persian Gulf, and certain districts in the mountains of Kurdistan, which had been seized by the Turks. Since the Matamet’s expedition against the sheikh of the Chaab Arabs, who had gi'ven an asylum to Mehemet Taki Khan, the Persians had occupied Mohammerah and some territory to the north of that town. 11ns territory was claimed by the Porte, and as the Shah refused to withdraw his troops from it, the Porte was about to have recourse to war to enforce its claims. It was already fitting out an expedition for the purpose. _ . It was necessary for the representatives of the mediating Powers at Constantinople to make a careful investigation into the claims of the contending parties, and to propose to them for their acceptance a fair and equitable arrangement founded upon their respective rights and interests. Sir Stratford Canning entrusted me with this duty on his part. I had to examine the evidence furnished by the Porte and the Persian Government in proof of their respective pretensions, consisting of a mass of documents, maps and surveys, many of them of ancient date, and to prepare a scheme for the settlement of the matters in dispute, to be submitted to the British and Russian Governments for their approval before being presented to the two Powers. I took great interest in the work, which was very congenial to my tastes. The knowledge which I had acquired of the territory in dispute, and of the history and traditions of the tribes which inhabited it, proved of much use to me. I was able to prepare a project of settlement which appeared to me just to both parties, and warranted by the proofs which they had produced in support of their respective claims. It was entirely approved by Sir Stratford Canning,.and sent by him to Lord Aberdeen, to be communicated to the Russian Government A He fully expected that he would speedily receive authority to submit it to the Porte for its acceptance. The result of my examination of the evidence and maps furnished me was that the claims of Turkey to the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab and to Mohammerah were well-founded. Persia had never exercised more than a nominal jurisdiction over the territory in dispute, the right to which had always been asserted by the Porte. The Arab tribes which inhabited it, and which were semi-independent, had, however, acknowledged at one time the supremacy of the Sultan, and at another that of the Shah. The question was further complicated by the change which had taken place in the lower part of the course of the Karun. In the early part of this century, as may be seen by maps of the time, this river discharged itself into the Persian Gulf by more than one outlet, the principal of which was known as t he Bamishere. As it rose in the mountains of Luristan, and the whole of its course was through Persian territory, it was unquestionably a Persian river, and Persia had undoubted claims to the lands on both its banks. But a canal had been cut to unite this river and the Shatt-el-Arab, known as the Haffar, a name which denoted its artificial origin, and upon its banks Mohammerah had been built by the sheikh of the Chaab Arabs. In the course of time the waters of the Karun had enlarged this canal, and through it the main body of the river was * * Sir Stratford Canning No. 70, April 27, 1844. Idirected into the Shatt-el-Arab ; consequently Persia now claimed the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab below the Haffar, with the town and district of Mohammerah, as Persian territory. The original month of the Karun, the Bamishere, was still open and navigable, at least to vessels of moderate draught. The earlier mouths of this river to the east of the Bamishere had been gradually deserted by it, and were silted np and ^jiry. In fact, the Karun had for centuries been forcing its wfty westwards until it found a convenient outlet for the principal portion of its waters through the Haffar canal into the Shatt-el-Arab. The Porte contended, not without reason, that as the Euphrates was a Turkish river, running through the dominions of the Sultan from its source, it was unjust, and against universally recognised principles, to give to Persia the control of its outlet into the sea, merely because a Persian stream had changed its course, and had invaded a territory which did not appertain to the Shah. The command of the trade and navigation of a great river, which had flowed for more than one thousand miles through Turkish territory, would thus be transferred to a Power which might, if hostile to Turkey, close that river at its mouth. The Bamishere, the Porte maintained, was the true outlet of the Karun, and might without much trouble or expense be rendered navigable to trading vessels of any size, and that consequently the possession of the entrance to the Shatt-el-Arab was in no way necessary to Persia for the water communication between the sea and the province of Khuzistan. It was further able to show, by ancient maps and documents, that the frontiers of Persia had never reached the Euphrates, and that the whole of the delta between the mouth of that river and the Bamishere had originally belonged to Turkey. I considered the contention of the Porte just and well-founded. I consequently proposed in my scheme, as a fair compromise, that the new frontier line should be drawn through the desert country to the west of Hawizah, at some distance from the Shatt-el-Arab, across the Haffar, and midway down the delta to the sea. Turkey would have thus remained in possession of the banks of the Euphrates throughout the whole of its course. My suggestion, approved and adopted by Sir Stratford Canning, was submitted by Lord Aberdeen to the Russian Government, which declined to accede to it, and not only upheld the claims of Persia to Mohammerah and the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab from the Haffar to the sea, but insisted upon the cession to her of territory on its east bank (i.e., left bank), which she had not even claimed, almost to the junction of the Euphrates and Tigris at Korna—thus giving her the control of the navigation of both those rivers, which form the means of communication between the sea and the south-eastern provinces of Asiatic Turkey. Lord Aberdeen, who was desirous of deferring to Russia, accepted her views and instructed Sir Stratford Canning to recommend them to the Porte. He sent for me after the arrival of Lord Aberdeen’s despatch to this effect. I found him walking up and down his study, his brows knit, his thin lips compressed, and his delicate complexion scarlet with anger. Without saying a word he handed me the despatch. I read it, and remarked that I was deeply grieved to find that Lord Aberdeen had come to a decision which, in my opinion, was not consistent with justice and right, and was not in the interests of England. He requested me to draw up an answer to Lord Aberdeen’s despatch, pointing out the objections to the arrangement proposed by Russia, the injustice that would be done to the Porte, and the discredit that would fall upon England as a mediator if she showed so flagrant a spirit of partiality to Persia. I wrote the draft of a despatch in this sense, which was adopted by Sir Stratford Canning. But it failed to produce the desired effect, and nothing remained to him but to carry out the instructions he had received from Lord Aberdeen. The Porte protested against the decision of the mediating Powers, and against the sacrifice of territory it was called upon to make by it. But it was in the end compelled to yield,* in the face of the threatening insistence of England and Russia. 1 was deeply impressed with the position of Mohammerah, and its great importance to any Power having commercial and political interests in the East, ft commands the entrance to the Euphrates and Tigris, which are navigable to the very heart of the Turkish dominions in Asia, and to that of the Karun, which flows through one of the richest, though one of the most neglected, provinces of Persia. These rivers are destined to become great military and trading highways. It is, consequently, to the interest of England that their mouths should not fall into the possession of a Power which might be hostile to her. Turkey having been compelled to accept the Russian project for the settlement of [2440 c—10] * In the Treaty signed at Erzeroum in 1847. P54 her differences with Persia, the next step was to appoint a commission to delineate the the new frontier between that country and Turkey, to consist of commissioners to be named by the two Powers and by the mediating Governments of England an Russia It had been Sir Stratford Canning’s intention to employ me as one of them, in recognition of the services which I had been able to render him, and he accordingly proposed my appointment to Lord Aberdeen. But my views on the Turco-Persian an ' Servian questions had not been such as to induce the Foreign Office to look upon me whk favour, and Colonel Williams, afterwards known as Sir Fenwick Williams ofVlfs was selected for the office, ami Mr. Robert Curzon, the author of a popular and pleasantlv-written book on the monasteries of the Levant, who had accompanied Sir* Stratford to Constantinople in the capacity of private secretary, was chosen as his colleague.* moTE _I wa s some years afterwards named by Lord Palmerston joint commissioner with Sir Fenwick Williams, but I resigned the appointment to undertake my second expedition to Nineveh for the Trustees of the British Museum. |APPENDIX (D). Hough Notes made by General William Monteith, when in Persia, on the Frontier of Turkey and Persia. [These notes were communicated to the Foreign Office hy the author in a letter dated the 18th February, 1843, and were written during the period of Lis employment in connection with the Turco-Persian and Russo-Persian boundary questions, previous to his departure from Persia in 1829.] SINCE the cession of the provinces of Erivan and Nahtchivan (Treaty of the 22nd February, 1828), the northern frontier is very considerably diminished and admits easier adjustment with Persia, Russia having succeeded to the claims and disputes in this direction when the Treaty of Erzeroum (1822/1823) was concluded by Mirza Mohammed Ali, one of the Ministers of Abbas Mirza, who was then Heir Apparent and entrusted by his father, the late King, with the general direction of the negotiations. 2. It was then agreed that the treaty concluded by Nadir Shah (1746), which was based on that of Shah Ismail, # should decide the limits of the respective Empires. But as neither State, if they possessed the document in question, were willing to produce it recourse was had to grants made to the chiefs of tribes and districts to whom the charge of the frontier had been entrusted, and if these documents could have been relied on they would have afforded the fullest and most minute information, comprehending the fields and springs belonging to each tribe and district. The few that were produced tended to prove that the greater part of the frontier lands had been granted in “teul” or personal service, the holders of which were obliged to maintain order, and protect travellers and caravans within their respective limits. 3. The Kurdish tribes within the Turkish frontier, being decidedly the most powerful, gradually encroached on the Persian lands during the civil wars which so long continued in Persia. From the accession of Agha Mohammed Khan (1794) and the union of the different provinces of Persia under one Government, it became much superior to the pashaliks of Erzeroum and Bagdad, as the Government of Constantinople left them almost entirely to their own resources. On the conclusion of the Russian war by the Treaty of Gulistan (the 24 th October, 1813), both Abbas Mirza and his brother, Mohammed Ali Mirza (the latter took less part in the Russian war and earlier began to dispute with the Pasha of Bagdad), reoccupied all that was considered belonging to Persia, and followed far within the Turkish territory the tribes who had committed depredations on Persia. Turkey still continued to treat with indifference these disputes, though almost every expedition turned to their disadvantage. The districts of Kotur, Chareh Derik, Tergavar, and Mergavar, on the frontiers of Khoi and Urumia, were undoubtedly within the Persian limits, but for a long- period had been held by Kurdish begs, who not only refused submission but made constant irruptions on the Persian villages. These castles were quickly captured by the regular troops of Persia, but hostilities were continued by the Kurds on the frontier, which led to Abbas Mirza’s invasion of Turkey (1821) and occupation of the whole country between the Lake of Van and the range of Ararat. In the following year, the Pasha of Erzeroum, having received some reinforcements from Constantinople and assembled the whole force of his own Government, was totally routed near Zohrab Kulla, and Abbas Mirza was only prevented marching to Erzeroum by the cholera breaking out in his army and its consequent dispersion. Peace was concluded the following year (i.e., 1823), and, as before mentioned, the frontier settled on the same conditions as by Nadir Shah. The only doubtful part of the Azerbaijan frontier with which I am more particularly acquainted are the precise limits of Maku and * * Shah Ismail was proclaimed Shah in 1499 and died in 1523. Nadir Shah’s Treaty of 1746 was based on Sultan Murad’s Treaty of 1639.Chalderan with Byazud and Van. I, however, believe it to extend from the top of Little Ararat in the direction I have marked it. The districts of Kotur and Chareh may also be disputed, but I thought from the documents produced at the time, as wnll as their situation to the east of the great range which has evidently been intended as the line of demarcation, they were decidedly Persian lands; they are positions of considerable importance, commanding two principal routes into Persia,^ to whom they are of more importance than to Turkey. A lofty chain of mountains forms the boundary of the remaining part of Azerbaijan, and is well defined. The Turkish and Kurdish tribes within the Turkish frontier have been in the habit of pasturing their cattle within the Persian limits, but only on sufferance, for which they paid a sum of money or other valuable consideration. It has always been difficult to enforce this arrangement, to evade which, as well as to resist excessive demands, has been the cause of constant disputes and bloodshed. This was particularly the case regarding the right of pasture on the plain of Lahijan, much frequented by the Bilbass tribe of Kurds, belonging to Keu Sanjak and subject to the Babher chiefs of Karachulan, the most powerful and warlike of all the Kurdish States. For the last forty years they have been in constant revolt against Turkey, and have more than once forced pashas on Bagdad ; when pressed by a Turkish army they have sought the protection of Persia, but always revolted when the Turkish forces had retired or a true submission been exacted. The boundary here can hardly be said to be defined, and I believe was vaguely stated in the treaty as the respective limits of the Persian Kurdish State of Senna Ardelan and Shaherazur or Karachulan. Both chiefs enjoy sovereign pow r er within their own limits, supplying troops in case of war, when they likewise furnish some money and provisions, but more as a free gift than a tax. Every new chief must be confirmed either by the Courts of Tehran or Constantinople. In Persia formerly the chiefs of Luristan and Persian Arabia (Hawiza) had under the same title of vali their own princes, but were abolished by Nadir Shah, on account of their constant revolts. The treachery of the Vali of Arabia was the principal cause of the defeat of the Persian army by the Afghans and the fall of the Suffavean dynasty (1722). They followed the same course with Nadir Shah, but not with like impunity. Between Kermanshah, which now includes the province of Lusiana or Luristan, the mountains were to form the boundary, which is an imaginary line running through uncultivated or desert lands to the village of Banilla, on the Jerrah or Hawiza River, unmarked by any defined or known object. From this Persia wishes to establish a claim to the entire possession of the Chaab Sheikh’s lands, which extend to within 8 miles of Bussorah, consequently including the important position of Mohammerah, at the junction of the Hafar Canal with the Shatt-el-Arab, and commanding the navigation with India and the Persian Gulf of all the rivers of Mesopotamia and Lusiana, including the Tigris, Euphrates, and Karun. Sir J. McDonald (then Lieutenant McDonald) and myself were directed by Sir J. Malcolm, then Minister in Persia, to examine the country from Bushire to Dorak and Bussorah, then ascend the Karun to Shuster, Dizful, and the ancient Susa, returning direct through the mountains to Shiraz. We then considered the frontier as running as I have marked it, from the before-mentioned village of Banilla to the point where the Hafar comes out of the Karun, including one or both of the great islands formed by the channels of the Shatt-el-Arab and the Karun. The first time I heard the claim to Mohammerah advanced was in 1821, in consequence, I believe, of the French officers serving with Mohammed Ali Mirza having pointed out the great importance of the position and the advantage Persia would derive from commanding the exit of so great a river navigation. It is said Kerim Khan, when obliged to relinquish Bussorah, made some efforts to retain Mohammerah. No English officer or trader has, I believe, traversed Persian Arabia, or gone direct from Bussorah by Hawiza to Kermanshah. The French officers who served with the Persian army were employed on several expeditions in this direction, and it is said made surveys of this hitherto unknown region ; should that be the case, they will probably exist in the Depot des Cartes in France. The officers in question were' generally in the habit of keeping routes of all their marches in Persia, and will probably be found either in Paris or Constantinople.APPENDIX (E). Observations by Major [afterwards Sir Henry) Rawlinson on a Persian Memorandum Relative to the Situation of the Cities of Mohammerah and Fe/lahiah. [Enclosed in Sir Stratford Canning’s despatch No. 155 of the 18th July, 1844.] Observations. Persian Memorandum. # From the point of confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates at Korna, the river flows in a general direction of south east to Bussorah; it is subject to few windings, and the distance has been fixed by survey at 38 miles. If the title of Ears is here used in its general application to the province of that name the description is altogether incorrect, not a single rivulet that rises within the frontiers of the said province finding its way to the Shat-el-Arab. The expression may, however, have a general reference to the Persian territory; and even then, the assertion that all rivers rising within that territory disembogue, like the Ear an, into the Shatt-el-Arab, will require to be greatly modified.—the fact is that the Karun itself does not dis embogue into the Shatt-el-Arab, the main body of the river finds its way by a separate channel (the Bamishere) to the sea, and is merely connected with the Shat-el-Arab by the artificial cut of the Hafar, on the right bank of which is situated the town of Mohammerah. Independently of this Hafar canal there is only one other stream which joins the Shatt el-Arab between Korna and the sea and that is the Soweib, which carries off the superfluous waters of the great Ibur of Howeizeh, a huge marshy lake, in which the river Choaspes or Kerkha and the minor streams of the Tib and Dowairej exhaust themselves, and which is also fed from the Tigris through the channel of the Had. There is much confusion in this description. The Bakh- tiari rivers descending to the south-west from the culmina ting ridges of Aosteran Koh, Miyaneh Koh, Zardeh Koh, and Mungusht fall into three distinct channels. The Dizful river to the west, the Karun in the centre, and the Tab or Jerrahi to the east. The waters of the Feili mountains on the contrary flow on the one side into the Kerkha and form on the other side the petty streams of the Gfangir, the Abi- Jestan, the Teb, and the Dowairij, which are lost in the marshy plains of Settacene. The streams of Koh Gfiluyeh unite and fall into the sea at Hindiyan. The river of Shuster is the Kerkha itself, and that of Dizful joins the former at Bandi-Kir, while the river of Bebahan, or which flows near Bebahan, is the main stream of the Tab or Jerrabi. The general direction of these streams is south west, and the only channels by which any part of their waters join the Shatt-el-Arab are the Soweib and Hafar. It is begging the question altogether to lay it down as an axiom that the Shatt-el-Arab is the boundary between Persia and Turkey. Sultan Murad’s treaty expressly names Bussorah as the Turkish limit, and under this head includes of course the acknowledged dependencies of the city which have always been the lands on either side of the Shatt-el- Arab Avatered by that river. The claim of Persia to Mo hammerah consists in the latter city being on the Hafar, which is now a continuation of the Karun, and not on the Shatt-el-Arab, but until the present year Persia has never received Maliyat or revenue from Mohommerah. The measured distance between Bussorah and Mohammerah by the river, which has few sinuosities, is 25 miles, and a MOHAMMERAH is situated to the east of the Shatt-el-Arab, which is formed by the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates at a village named Korna, distant 10 farsangs from Bussorah. All the rivers, great as well as small, on the confines of Ears, flow into the Shatt-el-Arab, which continues its course till it disembogues into the Persian Gulf. The Karun is one of the streams which thus unites with the Shatt el-Arab, the latter river passing Bussorah and forming, on the west, the boundary of Nejd and Arabistan. The right of Turkey to the ports which are situated on the western bank of the river is not contested, hut those to the east of the Shatt-el- Arab, which forms the boundary of Ears, depend upon that province. All the rivers, great as well as small, which rise upon the borders of Ears, traverse the territory of the Bakhtiaris, of the Eili Lurs, of Karoua (?), of Koh Giluyeh, of Shuster, of Dizful, and of Beba han. and flowing towards the east (“vers I’orient”) disembogue into the Shatt-el-Arab and thence into the Persian Gulf, the western shore of which is formed by Arabistan and Nejd. The Gulf and the above-mentioned river divide the two conti nents, and Mohammerah becomes in consequence a part of the territory of Ears, to which province accordingly it has always paid its revenue. The distance between the latter city and Bussorah is 4 farsangs by land, by water the interval may be traversed in an hour. The port of Mohammerah is situated on the banks of the Karun, a river which in its descent from Shuster becomes first a con- * Communicated to the Foreign Office by Colonel Sheil, Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, in his despatch No. 41, April 16, 1844. [2440 c—10] Q* 58 siderable stream in the neighbourhood of the former place. A preference has been generally accorded to the waters of the Karun over those of the Tigris and Euphrates on account of their superior purity, lightness, and sweet taste. The waters of the Tigris and Euphrates are subject, it is said, to the influence of the atmosphere, becoming warm or cold according to the state of the weather, whilst those of the Karun, on the contrary, are always comparatively cool. During the great heat of summer, indeed, the water of the Tigris and Euphrates is only drinkable during the night, whereas above the junction of the Karun with the Euphrates the former stream may boast through out the year of the peculiarly cool and agreeable flavour of its water, the inhabitants of the country affirming that they never feel the want of ice, and acknowledging that all the best qualities of a good water are to be found united in the stream of the Karun. As Bagdad has different quarters on either side of the Tigris, so also Mohammerah is divided into two parts by the Karun. The northern quarter used to be very populous and surrounded with cultivation, and it contained also the bazaar which is now in ruins. In the southern quarter were situated a fort, with various buildings and mosques, and the popu lation was composed of Arabs of the tribe of Keab. The parties sent periodically by the Arab sheikhs of the Keab tribe to gather in the produce of the date groves had established many depdts on the banks of the Shatt-el-Arab for storing the fruit. Sheikh Fariss, nephew of Sheikh Thamir Khan, was entrusted with the direction of the affairs of commerce, while Sheikh Jaaber acted as the political Governor of Mohammerah. Had not this country been under the rule of the Keab it would have arisen into great celebrity—the only draw back to its prosperity consisted in its subjection to the Arabs. It contained about 6,000 houses, which were scattered along the borders of the Karun. Persians from Shuster, Dizful, Howiezeh, Bebahan, and Kazeroon. and others emigrating from Bunder Bushire and its dependencies of Bunder-Big, steamer at ebb tide can just traverse the interval in two hours. Mohammerah is on the Hafar Canal and not on the Karun. At ebb tide the former channel is certainly filled from the Ivarun, but at flood the current is reversed, and formerly the natural flow of the waters was in this direction, from west to east. ^^ On the contrary, the Karun between Weis and Ahwf 100 miles above Mohammerah, is very much larger than the Hafar at the latter place. The excellence of the waters of the Karun and Kerka, “ the drink of kings,” has been proclaimed by the consentient voice of all antiquity and attested by the result of all modern experience. There ha» been much geographical confusion it is true, in consequence of one river being mis taken for the other, but this question of distinction or identity appears to have the least possible connection with the disputed right to Mohammerah. The name of Mohammerah certainly applied originally to the northern and southern quarters of the town on the Hafar Canal, but for the last twenty years at least it has been restricted to the northern division, the southern quarter having been designated as the Koot-el-Sheikh (the sheikh’s castle) from its being the usual residence of the next heir to the chief ship of the Chaab tribe. Sheikh Jaaber, the Q-overnorof Molmmmerah, having rebelled against the chief of Felialiiah, there has been constant fighting between the inhabitants of the two towns separated by the Hafar Canal. Mohammerah being on the mainland while Koot-el-Sheikh was on an island, and thus affording greater facilities for the dispatch of merchandise into the Turkish and Persian territory, was generally visited by traders in preference to the southern quarter. When the Chaab possessed the territory from the sea to Grirdelan their storehouses for dates -were no doubt established upon the Shatt-el-Arab along the entire line, but at present 1 know of no depots belonging to the tribe upon the river above the Hafar. Sheikh Jaaber being in rebellion in Mohammerah, Sheikh Fariss was sent from Fellahiah to Koot-el-Sheikh to hold him in check, they never were associated in a common government, but each ruled independently in his own quarter; Sheikh Jaaber, however, addicting himself to commerce, while Sheikh Fariss was chiefly occupied in collecting the date produce of the island of Abadan. No doubt Mohammerah possesses natural advantages of some consequence, being situated in a fertile tract im mediately between the two large navigable rivers of the Shatt-el-Arab and Karun ; but the population of the countries through wdiich these rivers flow must be multiplied tenfold before the demand and supply can be such as to entitle the port to be ranked amongst the great emporia of eastern trade. Personal examination and extended enquiries enable me to state positively the following factsregarding Mohammerah. In its most nourishing state it never contained at the utmost computation above 500 houses, probably not more than 400 of these, be it observed, were almost exclusively reed huts plastered with mud; there were four caravanserais and three temporary sheds used as coffee houses. Sheikh Jaaber once brought a boat load of burnt bricks from Bussorah which he made use of in laying the foundations of his ow r nhouse and one of the caravanserais, and these were the •only bricks that were ever known in the place, reeds and mud were the exclusive materials used in the other buildings. The transit trade was no doubt flourishing at one time, but a comparison, even in the proportion of their relative extent betw T eenMohammerahand our Indian capitals is preposterous in the extreme. As for the lakhs of gold and silver money in^d.ai'y circulation, no one that 1 have ever conversed w 'S? behove it possible that tie re could have been at any one time a lakh of rupees collected in Mohammerab. The staples of export and import were respectively dates and rice, and at all times three-fourths of the inhabitants were A-rabs. Gena web, Dilem, and Rishahan assembled at Mobammerah and built bazaars, khans, caravan serais, and coffee houses. The place became so flourishing that the rent of a single room in a caravanserai amounted to 10 kurush (ain) per mensem, a sum equivalent to fifteen Shiraz rupees, and the merchants were only too glad to secure accommodation at that exorbitant rate. Wealthy and respectable merchants in fact have certified that the condition of Mohammerah was at one time so flourishing as to rival Calcutta and Bombay, not considered in regard to its actual extent, hut as being more populous and celebrated than either of the above-mentioned cities in refer This geographical description is quite unintelligible, the otal distance from the sea to GKrdelan is about 75 miles. As you ascend tbe river the isle of Abadan stretches for ■ about 50 miles on the right, and this is all Chaab territory, but quite independent of Mohammerah ; then occurs the mouth of the Hafar Canal with about a mile of territory on the Shatt-el-Arab belonging to Mohammerah. Above you have for two miles the date groves of Bujidee, cultivated by the Chaab, but paying revenue to the Bawee Arabs, then occur for four miles the lands of Tamur inhabited by the Chaabies subject to Fellahiah, but paying revenue to Bussorah, and above that point the Muntifik and other Turkish subjects possess the entire territory for 19 miles into Bussorah. The rivalry always subsisting between the two sub divisions of the Chaab tribe, named Ediis and Xasara, appears to have had but little effect on the condition ot Mohammerah. Ilajee Jaaber was of neither one tribe nor the other, and admitted few of them into his town; he formed and supported his own garrison, and as far as I have been able to ascertain was well and faithfully served by them. This account of the capture of Mohammerah is strangely perverted. Treachery was never imputed to the garrison, nor did Jaaber fly from his own people but from the Turkish soldiery. Relying in fact on support f- , om Fellahiah, which was withheld by Sheikh Thamir from jealousy of his rival’s power, he rejected all overtures and determined to defend his town to the last. The place was accordingly formally invested, battered, breached, and finally taken by assault, Sheikh Jaaber escaping in his boats by the Bamishere river when the Turkish troops were occupied in plundering the town. ence to the space which they relatively occupied. Agha Abdul Mahommed, a merchant who visited Mohammerah before the expedition of the Pasha of Bagdad on certain commercial affairs of his own, has taken oath also that during his residence of one month in the place lakhs of gold and silver money were in daily circulation. On the eastern bank of the Shatt-el-Arab from the head of the Persian Gulf as far as Girdelan, opposite to Bussorah, the port of Mohammerah occupies to the south a space of 4 farsangs. The whole of this tract produces dates and other fruits, and it also contains within its limits fourty-four forts belonging to the Keab Arabs. Amongst the Arabs of those parts there are two particular tribes, named respectively Derissis and Ansar, who have risen into great power, and to whom is owing the ruin of Mohammerah, Jaaber having been deputed by Sheikh Thamir Khan to govern Mohammerah, appropriated to himself the entire revenues which arose from the gardens without admitting the Keab Arabs to any partici pation. On the arrival accordingly of the Pasha of Bagdad, and enmity having at the same time broken out between the two tribes, a project was formed for the assassination of Jaaber, who, how ever, obtaining information of the plot three days after the Pasha’s arrival and before any slaughter had commenced, fled away in a boat with his Mobammerah w’as stormed on the western face, and when the troops were fairly in possession of the breach there was a general rush to the boats on tbe Hafar, which runs along tbe southern wall of the town, and numbers of persons who were without the means of flight throwing themselves into the canal were drowned ; the total population of the place when it was captured, including the Arab garrison of fighting men may have been 3,000 souls, and as always occurs when a place is carried by assault, the loss of life was no doubt considerable. I have never been able, however, to collect any satisfactory information on this point, nor can I obtain an approximate estimate of the extent and value of the plundered property. family and servants. On this intelligence getting abroad, the whole population was seized with a sort of panic and cast themselves into the waters of Shatt ; women and children unable to swim perished in the waves, about 4,000 souls were carried into slavery by the Arnaouts and Turkish soldiers, others saved themselves by flight. The60 Mahommedans of Bussorah purchased many of these children for 18 or 20 kurnah a-head, end restored them to their parents. From Mohammerah to the town of Fellahiah on the River Jerrahi, where the sheikhs of the Keab trihe have their residence, merchandise is con veyed in small boats named by the inhabitants ‘ &lt; belem ,, and “ shuyeh,” as well as in the large boats which navigate the Shatt-el-Arab. The distance from Mohammerah to Fellahiah amounts to 10 farsangs ; the usual method of performing the journey is in small boats upon the river, but the traveller can, if he desires, ride along the banks on horseback, being obliged, nevertheless, at two places to take his saddle and other property into a boat and cross his horse over the streams which oppose his progress by swimming. The River Jerrahi, formed by the junction of three streams named respectively the Kurdistan, the Bebahan, and the Ram Hormuz, directs its course towards Fellahiah ; but before reaching that city it divides itself into five branches, two of which only pass through the place. At three different spots the lands are irrigated and devoted to a large extent of rice cultivation. The country for the space of 30 farsangs presents a very com pact (tres uni) appearance, and belongs to the Keab Arabs, who are employed in every species of agriculture. The whole territory along the course of the river is extremely fertile, the water which remains after the wants of the cultivation are supplied being carried off by a subterranean passage [ ? ]. The plain, moreover, produces a vast quantity of reeds which are both used for fuel and in the construction of all the houses that are not intended for the sheikhs and great people. From Arkoot Mihna, a village which is situated in the district of Zeidan, containing also seven other villages and two forts named Deh Moolah and Bunder Hindonam, as far as Fellahiah, the capital of Sheikh Thamir Khan, the cultivation of corn and green vegetables (legumes) is general. Sheikh Thamir Khan’s various possessions extend over a space of ten stages upon each side [ ? ] the lands being watered by the rivers Jerrahi and Zeidan, and the revenues which are realised from the cattle and pasture grounds accruing to the said sheikh. Mohammerah possesses a port which, had it not The water communication between Mohammerah and Fellahiah is by the artificial canal which connects the Jerrahi with the Karun, and the navigability of this -&gt;] by vessels of a greater or less draught depends entT y on the state of the great dyke on the Jerrahi. When this dyke is in repair belems can alone ascend the canal when it is destroyed the usual river boats of the Karun can be tracked to Fellahiah. I have always understood the banks of the Fellahiah Canal to be so densely covered with reeds as to be altogether impassable to a horseman. I do not understand how the traveller would require to cross two rivers; it appears to me that between Moham merah and Fellahiah the bed of the Karun itself would form the only obstruction. This description of the Jerrahi is exceedingly incorrect. The Kurdistan, the Bebahan, and the Ram Hormuz are all the same, the three names being applied to the Jerrahi in different parts of its course; the only affluent of conse quence that joins this river after leaving the mountains west of Bebahan is the united stream of the Ab Allah and Abi- Zard, which falling into the Kurdistan in the plain of Ram Hormuz forms the Jerrahi, identical with the Oroatis of the ancients and the Tab of the Arab geographers. At present two branches of this river, named the Jungeri and Kolfi, leaving the main stream a few miles above Fellahiah, unite and form the Nahr-i-Busi, which disembogues into the sea at the Khur-i-Musa, the remaining waters are divided between the Boteynaut, the Fellahiah, and theRaghiodhee, the Fellahiah passing through the town of that name and joining the Karun about 15 miles above Mobammerah, and the other two canals being consumed in the irrigation of the Chaab lands. I have never heard of this “ souterrain,” and conclude^ therefore, the allusion to be to the mere absorption of the superfluous waters. Between the district of Zeidan, which is on the river of Hindiyan, usually named Zohreh,and formed by the united streams of the Abi-Shur and Abi-Shirin and the rich country of Fellahiah on the Jerrahi, the interval, 50 or 60 miles in extent, is entirely desert and devoid of permanent inhabitants. It belongs to the Chaab, but is only of value for its winter pasturage. The general shape of the Chaab territory is triangular, that is, taking as a base the sea coast from the mouth of the Shat to the mouth of the Zohreh (the Brizana of antiquity), the western side will be formed by the Shat, the Hafar, and the Karun, and the eastern by the course of the Zohreh to Deh Moolah, and by an imaginary line stretching from that point to the Karun, the point of inter section of the two sides being at Weiss, which thus becomes the apex of a triangle. The extreme distance from north to south is about 100 miles and from east to west 80 miles.The province of Nejd is the high plateau of Central Arabia, distant some 500 miles at its nearest point from Bussorah, and the name is never applied to the valley of the Euphrates. ^would appear from this that Persia claims the left bank of the Shat and the Tigris as her boundary from the sea to near Bagdad, but I know not the grounds upon which the claim depends. At present she does not possess any territory on the river above Mohammerah. Grirdelau was certainly built by Persian colonists about 100 years ago and continued with the adjoining villages subject to Howoizeh for some years after Nadir Shah’s Turkish conquests; but the lands watered by the Shat from Garde- lan to the sea are, nevertheless, registered in the Bussorah records as dependencies of that city from the earliest period to which such documents ascend, and all the ancient geographical notices confirm this territorial allotment. The village of Sadireh is on the Jerrahi about 40 miles above Fellahiah; the extreme Chaab possession, however, on this river is Khalafabad, 15 miles above Sadireh. The country is thinly inhabited from Khalafabad to Old Doorak, but between that point and Fellahiah the cultivation, watered by canals from the Jerrahi, continue in an un interrupted line and maybe increased to any desired extent. The direction of the Jerrahi from Bam Hormuz to Fellahiah is south westerly, and from that point to the sea the Nahr-i-Busi runs due south. Bunder Maashar is on the sea near the mouth of the Nahr-i-Busi; it is distant about 30 miles from Fellahiah and nearly 70 miles from Sadireh by the river. been destroyed, would have become very cele brated. The whole country to the west of the Shatt-el-Arab from the Persian Gulf to Girdelan opposite to Bussorah, is included in the territory of Nejd ; but Girdelan is to the east of the river, where the country, for a space of 80 farsangs, belongs to the province of Pars. Throughout all this tract the date palm flourishes, the groves in many places stretching for a space of 8 farsangs, in others being limited to 3 farsangs. Besides dates the country also, which belongs exclusively to Sheikh Thamir Khan, produces oranges, citrons, figs, grapes, pomegranates, plums, peaches, &amp;c. The Keab tribes of Edres and Ansar occupy the gardens on the banks of the Shatt-el-Arab. the eastern shores of which are held to be an integral part of the territory of Ears. There are forty-six forts which acknowledge the rule of the Keab Arabs. The houses which are built within these forts and around them are constructed of earth, of bricks, and of the wood of the date tree ; the buildings and edifices which surround the gardens are inhabited by the Keab subjects who are employed in gathering in the fruit. As for the rice and corn, of which the produce is very con siderable, the sheikh enjoys the entire revenues. The village of Sadireh, which is situated at the distance of 8 farsangs from Fellahiah, is one of the dependencies of the Sheikh, it may be reached either by land or by water. Agents are maintained there by the chiefs to superintend the cultivation of the wheat and barley. The families occupied in husbandry amount to about 200 . The water for irrigation comes from the Jerrahi which runs easterly “ vers Torient ” towards Fellahieh. Meashar occurs at the distance ot 4 farsangs from Sadireh. H. BAWLINSON, Consul at Bagdad.

THE two Mussulman States agree to abandon totally the pecuniary claims of both parties which they have hitherto been raising against each other. But no invalidity shall acrue from this agreement to the convention contained in the fourth article for the settlement of particular claims. Article 2. The State of Persia undertakes that all the level lands of the province of Zohaub, he., the lands of the western part of it, shall be abandoned to the State of Turkey. The State of Turkey also undertakes that the lands of the eastern part of the province of Zohaub, i.e., all the mountainous lands of it, with the valley of Kerind, shall be abandoned to the State of Persia. And the State of Persia firmly undertakes to give up all manner of claim in regard to the town and province of Sulaymauneyya, and not at any time to meddle or interfere in any way with the right of sovereignty which the State of Turkey possesses in the said province. And the State of Turkey also firmly undertakes that the town and seaport of Mohammerah, and the island El Khizr, and the anchorage place, and also the lands of the eastern bank, i.e., of the left side of the Shauttu-l-Arab, which are in the possession of tribes acknowledgedly attached (subjected) to Persia, shall be in possession of the State of Persia, in full sovereignty. And besides this, Persian ships shall have the right to navigate the said river in full liberty, from the place where it flows into the sea, as far as the point of junction of the frontiers of the two parties. Article 3. The two contracting parties undertake that by this treaty, all other territorial claims being abandoned, engineers and commissioners shall be appointed without delay on either part, so that they may draw the frontier between the two States in conformity with the foregoing article. Article 4. The two parties have agreed that commissioners shall be appointed on both sides without delay, to judge and decide in an equitable manner the questions of damages which have happened to both sides since the acceptance of the friendly suggestions of the two great mediating States that were written and communicated in the month of Jamauzyu-’l-evval, 1261 ; and also of the pasturage dues from the year when they fell into arrears. Article 5. The State of Turkey promises to make the fugitive Persian princes live at Broosa, and not to give permission for them to be absent from thence, or for them to- correspond secretly with Persia. And it is agreed on the part of the two exalted States that all other fugitives shall be surrendered in accordance with the former treaty of Erzeroum. Article 6. Persian merchants shall pay the customs duties on their objects of commerce,, either in money or in kind, according to their current price at the time, in the mannerprescribed by that article of the treaty of Erzeroum, concluded in 1238,* which relates to commerce; and no sum shall be demanded more than the amount mentioned in that treaty. Article 7. The State of Turkey promises that according to former treaties it will accord the necessary privileges to Persian pilgrims, so that they may be able to visit in safety and in freedom from any sort of molestation, the sacred places situated in the dominions of the Turkish State. It also promises that, in the view to strengthen and corroborate the ties of friendship and unity which it is necessary should exist between the two Mussulman States and between the subjects of both it will take the most proper steps, so that, in like manner as Persian pilgrims are in the enjoyment of all privileges in the dominions of the Ottoman State, the other Persian subjects also may participate in those privileges; and so that, whether in their commerce or whether in other matters, they may be protected from all kinds of oppression, molestation or disrespect. And besides this, the state of Turkey accepts the consuls who may be appointed on the part of the State of Persia for the benefit of commerce and protection of Persian subjects and merchants, in all places of the Turkish dominions where they may be necessary, excepting Mekka the respected, and Medeena the illuminated. And it promises that all privileges which are befitting the office and commission of the said consuls, and which are observed in respect of the consuls of other friendly States, shall be observed towards the said consuls. And the State of Persia also undertakes to reciprocate in the fullest manner in respect to the consuls who may be appointed on the part of the Ottoman State to any place in the dominions of Persia that may be necessary, and in respect to the subjects and merchauts of the Turkish State who may frequent the Persian dominions. Article 8. The two exalted Mussulman States agree that, in order to prevent, repress and restrain the robbery and depredations of the tribes that inhabit the frontiers, they will devise and put in execution the necessary measures ; and in this view, they will station troops in the proper places. And the two exalted States undertake to do what is requisite in the case of any kind of trepass occurring within the territory of each other, such as robbery, plundering, or murder. And they have agreed that the tribes concerning whom there is a dispute and whose suzerain is not known shall, once for all, have the choice and election of the place where they will henceforward reside ; and the tribes whose subjection is known shall be forcibly returned to the territory of the State to which they belong. Article 9. All the articles and paragraphs of former treaties, especially of the treaty concluded at Erzeroum in 1238,which are not particularly charged or annulled by the present treaty, are renewed in all their force and validity the same as if they were inserted word for word in this document. And it is agreed between the two exalted States that in two months from the exchange of this treaty, or in less time, it shall be accepted and signed by the two States, and the ratifications exchanged. 16th Jamauzyu-s-saanee, 1263. [2440 c—10] A.D. 1822.66 APPENDIX (G). Sir Stratford Canning to Lord Palmerston.—{Received June 20.) (No. 172.) My Lord, Constantinople, May 30, 1850. THE conference, which in concert with the Kussian envoy, I held with the Grand Vizier and Aali Pasha at Batta Liman on the 21st instant, resulted, with respect to Mohammerah, in a promise on the part of the Turkish Ministers that our opinions and arguments should be fully submitted to the council, and, with respect to Kotur, Tamban, and other disputed points of the frontier not specified in the Treaty of Erzeroum, that no further attempt at occupation, unprovoked by any aggressive movement of the Persians, should be made under the Porte’s authority until the commissioners had visited those parts of the line and taken the respective claims into consideration. The arguments used by M. Titow and myself in support of the line recommended by the mediating commissioners, as the fairest demarcation for Mohammerah and its neighbourhood, were principally derived from the true intent and wording of the second article of the treaty, from the mutual interest of the parties when rightly understood, and from the useless, not to say mischievous, complications involved in the arrangement proposed under his instructions by Dervish Pasha. The Ottoman Ministers grounded their preference for that arrangement on the terms of the Porte’s explanatory note accepted, as they reminded us, before the exchange of the ratifications, not only Lord Cowley and M. Oustinof, but also by the Persian plenipotentiary, who was here. They represented the note in question as containing certain conditions on w T hich alone the Saltan had consented to ratify the Treaty of Erzeroum, and they persisted in giving to that part of the note which regards Mohammerah an interpretation calculated to bear them out in requiring the adoption of their commissioner’s line. Though it does not appear that the Persian plenipotentiary had any express authority to accept the note, there is no denying that it was accepted by the British and Russian representatives, and that the terms of it, taken literally, imply a limitation which it is equally difficult to reject on clear grounds of right or to admit with any degree of satisfaction. If the Turkish line were established there would be three lines of frontier, running almost parallel to each other, from the sea to the Haffar Canal—an absurdity which never could have been contemplated by those who sought to simplify the relations of Turkey with Persia and to diminish the chances of fresh collision between them. Such an arrangement also stands in contradistinction with that clause of the second article of the treaty which extends the future acknowledged territory of Persia to other portions of the eastern coast of the Shatt-el-Arab, besides those which are included in the island of Khizr and Lie tow r n of Mohammerah. In this equivocal and contradictory state of things it was not to be expected that the Turkish Ministers would give way at once?, and it is doubtful whether they will be induced to give way at all without a reference to the mediating Courts. Care has been taken to divert them from any expectations which they may possibly entertain of undoing the treaty altogether and opening a door for the reconsideration of its territorial arrangements. They have been told that a difference of opinion as to one clause of a ratified treaty can hardly be allowed to vitiate the whole body of the instrument, however the disputed point may be shown to be a just object of discussion and of better defined settlement; that the note appealed to by them, being of an explanatory character, could not be supposed to change the very nature of the treaty, in one of its essential parts, and to render its execution incompatible with the terms of the original stipulations ; or, if such had been the purpose of those who framed it, that at least so extraordinary and unexpected an intention should have been frankly declared and unequivocally expressed. In reply to a joint application from the Russian envoy and myself, it was stated to-day by Aali Pasha that the council had not yet had time to deliberate on the subject of the conference, and the Sultan’s aporoaching absence from his capital will come in aid of His Majesty’s personal disinclination to accept our inter pretation of the treaty, and probably contribute to postpone a final decision of the question. * * This refers to the Explanatory Note of April 26, 1847, addressed to the Porte by the Mediating Representatives at Constantinople, giving explanations and assurances relative to certain stipulations of the Treaty of Erzeroum. hi opeui 11 ; jf f conceri IlyRll igber ductitt (Under these circumstances, I venture to submit the expediency of your Lordship opening a direct communication with the Court of St. Petersburg!! as to the real meaning and fair interpretation of the explanatory notes, in so far as they relate to the line of demarcation near Mohammerah.

THE commissioners appointed by the Turkish and Persian Governments to settle, under the mediation of British and Russian commissioners, the line of boundary between Turkey and Persia, as contemplated by the Treaty of Erzeroum have, at the very outset of their proceedings, so decidedly differed as to the intent and effect of that instrument and of the notes exchanged previously to its signature and ratification with reference to the southern portion of the boundary, that there seems every probability of its being necessary for the Governments of England and Prussia to pronounce an opinion on the matters on which the parties more immediately interested in the settlement are at issue. Your Lordship is aware that in the year 1845, when it became evident that the respective plenipotentiaries at Erzeroura could not, even with the assistance of the commissioners of the mediating Powers, come to any agreement, the represen tatives of England and Russia at Constantinople drew up and submitted to the Porte and to the Persian Government a scheme of arrangement in nine articles, and in the second of these articles it was said, in regard to the matter now more immediately under discussion, “ that the Porte would consent to leave Persia in possession of the island on which Mohammerah is situated, and of as much of the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab as was actually occupied at that time by tribes admitted to he dependent on Persia, including the free enjoyment of the navigation of the river from its mouth to the point where the respective frontiers touch each other.” The Shatt-el-Arab, or the Arab River, is the name given to the united waters of the Tigris and Euphrates between Korna and the Persian Gulf. In the observations which I have now to make I leave out all reference to what passed at Tehran in regard to these articles, inasmuch as the question which is now to be dealt with is purely a Turkish one. The Porte at first objected that Mohammerah and the neighbouring districts had heretofore been Turkish territory, but had been wrongfully seized upon by Persia in 1841. Eventually, however, the Porte agreed to the article respecting Mohammerah, with the understanding that the concession was not to affect the Porte’s right of property to the river, the course of which was still to belong wholly and exclusively to the Porte, which only granted freedom of passage to Persian vessels ; and, in order to secure the Porte’s right, it was required that no fortifications should be raised on any part of the river banks remaining in the possession of Persia. The commissioners of the mediating Powers having, however, found it impossible, to bring the respective plenipotentiaries to agree to the terms sent from Constantinople, drew up a draft of treaty in which they sought, as far as possible^ to reconcile the differences between the two parties. That draft, as regards the point now in discussion, stipulated that “ the Ottoman Government formally engaged that the town and port of Mohammerah, the island of Khizr, and the anchorage, and likewise the lands on the east bank, that is, on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, which are in the possession of tribes admitted to be dependent on Persia, should remain in the possession of the Persian Government in full sovereignty. Moreover, Persian vessels should have the right of freely navigating the Shatt-el-Arab, from its- mouth to the point where the frontiers of the two parties should touch each other.” Eurthermore, “ the two contracting parties, having by the present renounced their other territorial claims, engage immediately to appoint commissioners and engineers, who may lay dowm the boundary between the two States, according to the preceding article.” . But before this draft, drawn up by the mediating commissioners, came under discussion, the Porte alleged that it had just discovered that Mohammerah was wholly situated on the mainland, and that the town opposite to it on the island of Khizr bore another name : and therefore it refused to cede that island.The Porte, however, did not persist in this objection; hut, as difficulties were still raised to the signature of the treaty, the Ministers of the mediating Powers at Constantinople suggested that the treaty might be signed, and that the Turkish plenipotentiary should present to the Persian plenipotentiary, at the time of signing, a that the Porte would require certain modifications of the treaty to be ass *fted to by Persia previously to the exchange of ratifications. Hut the note which the Porte was disposed to present in conformity with this suggestion not being satisfactory, the British and Russian Ministers suggested that the scruples of the Porte might be removed if the mediating plenipotentiaries were to record their own opinion as to the interpretation to be given to the article in question ; and they proposed that such interpretation should he that the anchorage of Mohammerah was opposite the town and within the Haffar Canal; and that the Porte, in ceding to Persia the town, port, and anchorage of Mohammerah, did not cede anv other territories or ports in that quarter; and tliat, as regarded divided tribes, territories occupied by one portion of a tribe were not to be claimed by Persia simply on the plea^ that another portion of the same tribe was located on lands admitted to he Persian. And Lord Cowley subsequently explained that this limitation applied to territories situated above Mohammerah. But as the Porte w^as not satisfied with this proposal, the British and Russian Ministers went further, and stated that under no pretence could Persia claim lands situated on the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, nor lands belonging to Turkey on the left bank, even in the event of Persian tribes being established on the said left bank lands. The assurances finally given by the two Ministers, on which the Porte consented to allow its plenipotentiary to sign the treaty, and on the meaning of which the question now under discussion depends, are contained in the note presented by them to the Porte on the 26th April, 1847, a copy of which is contained in Lord Cowley’s despatch No. 167. I transmit to you herewith a copy of that despatch for more convenient reference, and your Lordship will perceive that those assurances were that the Porte did not cede to Persia any port or territory in that quarter besides the town and the port of Mohammerah, and the anchorage of Mohammerah opposite the town and within the Haffar Canal, and besides the island of Khizr; that the Persian Government could not pretend to any right of property either over the country situated on the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, or over territory belonging to the Porte on the left bank, even if Persian tribes in whole or in part were established there. The treaty was accordingly signed at Erzeroum on the 81st May, 1847 ; hut when the period arrived for exchanging the ratifications, the British and Russian Ministers had great difficulty in persuading the Persian plenipotentiary to acquiesce in the assurances which they had given as to the interpretation of the article in question ; and even when they had succeeded in doing so, they were met by fresh objections on the part of the Porte, which were only removed by their formally repeating the assurances given by them previously to the signature of the treaty. The ratifications were thereupon exchanged on the 21st March, 1848. Lord Cowley’s despatch, of which a copy is enclosed, contains an account of what passed with the Porte immediately before the exchange of the ratifications. I also enclose copies of the 2 nd and 3rd articles of the Treaty of Erzeroum to which I have already referred. No copy of the treaty as actually signed was sent home. But the signed treaty is understood to have been identical, as far as its stipulations are concerned, with the nine articles drawn up in 1846 by the mediating commissioners at Erzeroum. Matters remained in this state until the beginning of this year, when the commis sioners of the contracting parties and those of the mediating Powers met together at Mohammerah in order to proceed to an exact settlement of the line of frontier which was to separate the possessions of the two Mahommedan Powers in that quarter.

Your Lordship will perceive from Sir Stratford Canning’s despatches, of which copies are enclosed, that the commencement of the proceedings of the commissioners has not been satisfactory, and that in all probability the mediating Powers will have to pronounce an opinion on the respective claims of the two parties in regard to the country in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. Her Majesty’s Government therefore think it expedient not to delav communicating with the Court of St. Petersburg on this matter, in the hope that, if the views of the two Courts should coincide, the expression at Constantinople of their decided opinion on the matters in dispute may tend to an early settlement of these matters. The Turkish commissioner, as will be seen from the enclosed papers, interprets the explanatory note addressed to the Porte by the Ministers of England and Russia at Constantinople previously to the signature of the Treaty of Erzeroum as securing to the Porte all districts not specifially mentioned as ceded to Persia, and he maintains that the note precludes all discussion in regard to any other districts. But this is far from being the correct interpretation of the note. Ihe note merely says that nothing is ceded bv treaty beyond the points specified, but it does not fetter the action and discretion *of the boundary commission, or say that if in the course of the investiga tions set on foot by the commission it should appear that Persia is entitled to other districts the commission should nevertheless be precluded from assigning such districts to her. The note precludes all discussion in regard to Mohammerah, its port and anchorage, and the island of El Khizr, for those places, being absolutely ceded by the treaty and admitted to be so by the Porte, the boundary commission have no discretion to exercise in regard to them. But the note does not say that the boundary commissioners should not ascertain whether, in addition to the distiicts specifically ceded to Persia, there might not be other districts in the same neighbourhood to which Persia might make good her claim. On the contrary, the note, by admitting that districts on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab belonging to Turkey should continue to belong to Turkey, even though occupied by entire Persian tribes or by parts of Persian tribes, clearly implies that there might be districts in that neighbourhood which would turn out on enquiry not to belong to Turkey. That such w r as the understanding of the British and Russian Ministers at Constantinople is evident from the words in red ink on the margin of their note of the 26th April, 1847, which your Lordship will see by Lord CowTey’s despatch Ino. 16/ of the 17th May that they proposed to insert, and which they only abstained from inserting in order to a\oid reopening the whole subject with the Porte ; and on being, moreover, assured by the Turkish Minister for Eoreign Affairs that whatever portion of the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab might be declared by the future commission to belong to tribes appertaining to Persia wmild be secured to Persia. It is manifest from this that in seeking to limit the possessions of Persia in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah to the points specified by name in the note of the English and Russian Ministers, the Turkish boundary commissioner is attempting to give to that note an interpretation which it w r as never intended that it should bear. Such being the case as regards the construction of the note of the 26th April, 1847, the pretensions of the two Mahommedan Powmrs in regard to the line of boundary by which their respective territories are to be separated appear to be as follows : The furkish commissioner, admitting that the island of Khizr is to belong to Persia, claims as the Turkish boundary a line considerably to the eastward of that island, which would then be separated on the east from the Turkish territory by the Bamishere Channel, in the same manner as it is separated on the wmst from the same territory by the Shatt-el-Arab. The ground of the Turkish claim is that the district in question is occupied by a tribe which originally emigrated from Kedjid, and obtained grants of lands from the Sultan. The Persian commissioner claims the whole country to the eastward of the Shatt- el-Arab from the point a little below Korna wTiere the Kerkha River (Jaab) flow r s into it, to the Persian Gulf; and he grounds his claim, first, on the fact that the sources of the Kerkba are in Persia; and secondly, on documents showing that for many years past the tribes occupying that country have been to a certain extent subject to Persia. You will find in the tracing enclosed in Sir Stratford Canning’s No. 110 , the lines marked as claimed by the respective Mahommedan commissioners, and also a third line recommended by the commissioners of the mediating Powders. With regard to the line claimed by the Turkish commissioner, it is to be observed that if the Porte contemplated setting up any claim to the territories lying to the eastward of the island of Khizr, it w r ould in all probability have insisted upon some / &lt; r V t ustipulation in regard to the Bamishere Channel hy which that island is separated from the districts claimed by the Turkish commissioner. The Porte took very great pains to record its assertion of sovereign rights over the entire waters of the Shatt-el-A.rab, hy which stream the western side of the island is bounded ; but it made no stipulation in regard to the stream which bounds the eastern bank. | The possibility of such an inconvenient arrangement as that now contended for by the Turkish commissioner could not have been contemplated, for that arrangement Trould have interposed between the Persian island El Khizr and the continental frontier of Persia a narrow slip of country wholly separated from the rest of the Turkish dominions; or, if the territorial claim of Turkey in that quarter was to be admitted in its full extent, the effect of the arrangement would be to separate the town of Mohammerah and the island of El Khizr from the rest of the Persian dominions. On the other hand, the claim of the Persian commissioner to the extensive district between the Kerkha Biver and the Haffar Canal which rests on the fact that the Kerkha has its source in the Persian boundary, cannot be sustained on such a reason. The question therefore to be resolved seems to be : to which of the two countries, Turkey, or Persia, the tribes by which the district in dispute is occupied properly beloug ; and on this point the Turkish and Persian commissioners are at variance. The mediating commissioners, without pronouncing an opinion on the last question, have proposed a line which they appear to consider best calculated to secure the essential interests of both parties. It is an object of considerable importance to Persia with a view to the prosperity of Mohammerah, that both banks of the Haffar Canal should belong to Persia. On the other hand, the Turkish Government are understood to consider it essential for the welfare of Bussorah on the west hank of the Shatt-el-Arab, and of Korna, that not only the channel but also both banks of that river above the Haffar Canal should belong wdrolly to Turkey. The mediating commissioners propose to provide for both these objects by running a line, which vv ill divide the territory in dispute in nearly equal parts. The line claimed by the Turkish commissioners, in its prolongation towards the north-west crosses the*Karun Biver above the point where that river falls into the Haffar Canal, and that line is carried on to two points, apparently buildings, which are situated somewhat to the south of the town of Hawizah on the Kerkha Biver. The mediating commissioners propose that the boundary-line between the two countries should run up along the east bank of the Shatt-el-Arab for a short distance above the Haffar Canal until it reaches a small stream which falls into that river ; and that the line should from thence be drawn directly to the points reached, as above stated, by the Turkish line, and thence directly to the town of Hawizah. Thus everything to the west of the proposed line, and consequently the east bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, with the exception of a small portion of that bank which can be of no value to Turkey, would belong to Turkey, and everything to the east of that line and consequently the north bank of the Haffar Canal would belong to Persia. Her Majesty's Government conceive that if the two mediating Courts should be called upon to pronounce an opinion on the respective claims of the two Mahommedan Powers, they can do no better than recommend those Powers to adopt the line proposed by the British and Bussian commissioners ; and I have to instruct your Lordship to communicate on these matters with the Buissian Government, and to ascertain whether the opinion of that Government coincides with the opinion of Her Majesty’s Government as stated in this despatch.

I HAD a conversation to-day with the Minister for Foreign Affairs respecting the Turco-Persian frontier question. Assim Bey was evidently still much disturbed at Russia’s action, and could not quite understand what it meant. The Russian Govern ment, he said, were constantly moving in troops to Khoi, Urmia, Salmas, and Maku. He was unable to control the numbers, but they seemed to constitute a considerable increase of the troops in these districts. There was even a question of sending troops to Kermanshah. Furrher, the Russian Government were constantly making complaints of the action of the Turkish authorities, which, when investigated and explained, were allowed to drop. The charges were quite groundless. The Turkish Government, his Excellency declared, were most circumspect, and had recently sent Jabir Pasha, the general at Van, to the frontier to see that no irregularities were being committed in the contested zone. But they had been careful to instruct the^ general not to cross over the frontier, and to summon the Turkish consul at Khoi to him to deliver the instructions which the Government were sending him. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. [2440 i —3] in 13 APR 1912 SECLE -&gt;* ■ '* t a n v' iwmmmmm [This Dc-cument is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] [A] T PERSIA. 1 o u CONFIDENTIAL. [14719] No. 1. Sir G. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 9.) (No. 270.) Sir, Constantinople, March 31, 1912. THE policy of Turkey with regard to the Turco-Persian frontier question is described in a couple of articles, published during the last few days in a new Turkish paper, the “ Hakk,” whose attitude is moderately in favour of the Committee of Union and Progress, in a manner which can hardly be considered palatable to the Turkish Government or nation. The author of these articles, a certain Suleyman Nazif Bey, sets forth to explain the true reason of the Russian concentration of troops on the Caucasian frontier, and the conclusion he arrives at is that it is caused by Turkey’s aggressive policy on the North Persian frontier line. The whole trouble, he considers, began in 1907 (? 1905), when Sultan Abdul Hamid sent an expedition to Urmia not to protect Turkish interests, but simply to try and put a stop to the new constitutional movement in Persia. England, believing Turkey’s aggressive policy to be dictated solely by Germany, was thereupon driven into the arms of Russia, and the Anglo- Russian reconciliation was the death-blow to the integrity both of Turkey and Persia. The constitutional rdgime has indeed supervened in this country, but no change of policy has resulted on the Persian question, and the Turkish Government of to-day are still “ greedily watching Persian affairs in the hope of gaining some material advantage.” How, for instance, asks the writer, can the present Turkish Government claim that they have documentary proof of their rights over a great part of Russian* territory round Khoy Salmas and Kotur, seeing that there have been Turkish consuls established at the two former posts for the past half-century, and that Turkey agreed to leave the latter to Persia when she signed the Treaty of Berlin ? Russia now claims, and with some justice, that Turkey’s advance to Urmia has become a serious menace to Russian territory in the rear of Kars, which is of great strategic importance to her. The only real way for Turkey to strengthen her eastern frontier is to avoid as far as possible coming into contact at any point along it with Russia. If, instead of this, Turkey proceeds to seize the territory of a country whose integrity she has pledged herself to defend, and if Russia, exasperated thereat, marches in and settles herself in Urmia, Turkey will be left helpless; for England will not interfere in her favour, having recognised Russia’s paramount interest in the north, nor can any help be expected now-a-days from Germany either in this or in any other question. Notwithstanding the anti-government tone of these articles, it must be observed that their author is by no means an enemy of the committee. It is true that his removal from Trebizond, where he held the post of vali until a few weeks ago, though ostensibly connected with an incident in which he was said to have struck a policeman, was probably really due to the desire of the committee to have a stronger supporter at that place during election times, but I am told that he continues to enjoy here, as editor of the “ Hakk,” a subsidy from the Government equal to his salary as vali. I understand, moreover, that these particular articles were written by him after an interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The writer clearly failed to convey in them the impression he was intended to convey, and I am informed that he has been severely reprimanded in consequence. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER.

I HAVE the honour to report that I have received a telegram from His Majesty s consul at Erzeroum, stating that he had been informed by the Russian consul-general that Russian troops are concentrating at Igdir and that the Customs officials at Orgofi are removing their effects. Igdir lies about 30 miles north of Bayazid and about 20 miles from the nearest Russian railway station at Karkhun (Echmiadzin). Orgoff is the Russian Customs post on the road leading from Bayazid into Russia over the western spurs of Ararat. If this road is still being used, it is unlikely that the Russian consul-general s statement as to the evacuation of the OrgofF Customs post is accurate. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER.

MAHMOUD SHEYKET PASHA came to see me to-day, and in course ol conversation said that he was quite at a loss to understand the recent considerable movement of Russian troops in the Caucasus. To put it down to the independent action of the governor was obviously absurd; it must have had the agreement of the Central Government. If the movement was intended in any way to exercise pressure with a view to the termination of the war with Italy, he could not admit that it would alter matters. The movement must consequently be in connection with the Persian frontier question. But Turkey was making no forward movement, and did not intend to make any. The whole question was about to be submitted to a joint commission, and eventually perhaps to The Hague Tribunal. He had no conception as to what decision that tribunal would give, and whether Khoi and Urmia would be awarded to Persia or Turkey, but even if half Persia were to be awarded to lurkey she had no desire to become possessed of these territories, and he saw no reason why an amicable arrangement could not be arrived at in spite of any decision of 1 he Hague Tribunal. An agreement could be come to with Persia and also with the other Powers interested. It had been urged that it was essential for Russia to occupy certain strategical points where she had now stationed troops. For his part these points were m no way of strategical necessity either for Russia or for Turkey, and he was at a loss to undeistarn the importance attached to them by Russia. , . , , Although the language of the Minister of War does not correspond with the forward movement of Turkish troops during the past few years, I have thought it worthy of record as perhaps indicating an intention of a more conciliatory attitude m this question. ^ l have, Ac.

THE reports of Russian mobilisation which have been current during the past few davs here have not failed to arouse considerable anxiety in the columns of the Turkish press The general pessimism with which such mobilisation would be regarded here is reflected in the “ Tanin ” of yesterday in a leading article by Ismail Hakki Babanzade. In this article Russia’s sudden change of attitude towards this country is commented on, and the writer wonders what can be the inducement for Russia to champion Italy, who is at this moment weakened both at home and abroad. Surely Russia has enough difficulties on her hands at present in Persia and China without wishing to embark on new adventures whose issue must be very uncertain. What is the meaning, Ismail Hakki asks, of Russia’s pretended and groundless fears of Turkish aggression in the Caucacus ? The only cpiestion between the two countries in that region could he relative to certain contested boundary points, and the assurances given by M. Tcharykof already have sufficed to settle these amicably. As regards the Persian boundary question, it is being submitted to a friendly commission, and may eventually go to The Hague. Turkey is Persia’s test friend, and desires to see the preservation of her integrity. Why then this Russian concentration ? It is only to be hoped that, being inexplicable, it will cease. Thus inconclusively the article ends, and, like several others published within the last few days, by its despondent tone re-echoes the feeling of nervousness which the recall of M. Tcharykof and the movement of Russian troops on the frontier have aw akened here. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LCWTHER [2397 cc— 2 ]CONFIDENTIAL.

But, owing to failure of Turkey to accept the line recommended by the mediating commissioners in 1850 , a frontier has been locally observed for sixty years which is more advantageous to Persia than that line;, and His Majesty’s Government could not admit that, in arriving at a final settlement, the argument of uti possidetis should be entirely ignored, though, j on a strictly legal interpretation, it may be doubtful whether that argument would prevail, owing to the reservations contained in the Turco-Persian protocol of 1869 . Having regard to the wording of article 2 of the Treaty oF Erzeroum, His Majesty’s Government are inclined to think that nothing more can be claimed on the Shatt-el-Arab for Persia than freedom of navigation, Turkey having taken great pains to assert her right of ownership over the entire waters of that river while, conceding such freedom. From the sea to where the mediating commissioners’ line strikes off from the Shatt-el-Arab, I do not think, therefore, that a frontier more advantageous to Persia than the mediating commissioners’ line could be successfully claimed against Turkey. But the point where the frontier as locally observed strikes off from the Shatt-el- Arab is 8ij miles to the west of the mediating commissioners’ line, and the intervening territory contains the palace and offices of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Persia protested in 1850 against the cession of these 6 miles or so to Turkey, and the mediating commissioners had suggested the allocation of territory in question to Turkey, not in pursuance of the treaty expressis verbis, but in order to secure the safety of navigation to Bussorah, which they thought might be endangered if Persia held that particular territory. As the experience of sixty years has shown the apprehensions of the commissioners to be groundless, there seems no reason to disturb the sheikh, and His Majesty’s Government would oppose any attempt to do so. After leaving the Shatt-el-Arab, the mediating commissioners’ line proceeds in the// direction of Hawizeh. The line as locally observed is some miles to the west of Hawizeh.

Your Excellency should make a communication to Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the following effect :— Protocol of December 1911 specifies the clauses of the Treaty of Erzeroum as the basis of work of commission, and omits all reference to ‘‘ explanatory note. It is therefore possible that The Hague Tribunal would not take cognisance of the “ explana tory note.” It is important in any case that Persian delegates should not accept that document at this stage, but that they should press for a precise definition of what Turkey claims under it in Mohammerah region, and British and Russian representatives at Constanti nople and Tehran should, I consider, continue to advise Persian delegates and Persian Government in this sense. The justification for Persian demand, apart from the fact that all mention of the “ explanatory note ” is omitted from protocol of last December, is the extravagant claims wdiich Turkey made under the note in 1850. The following is for the confidential information of the Russian Government :— His Majesty’s Government would be unable to recognise the Turkish cl aims _ of 1850 if they were now revived. But, owing to failure of Turkey to accept the line recommended by the mediating commissioners in 1850, a frontier has been locally observed for sixty years which is more advantageous to Persia than that line, and His Majesty’s Government could not admit that, in arriving at a final settlement, the argument of vti possidetis should be entirely ignored, though, on a strictly legal interpretation, it may be doubtful whether that argument would prevail, owing to the reservations contained in the Turco-Persian protocol of 1869 „ • , , Having regard to the wording of article 2 of the Treaty ol Erzeroum, His Majesty s Government are inclined to think that nothing more can be claimed on the Shatt-el-Arab for Persia than freedom of navigation, Turkey having taken great pains to assert her right of ownership over the entire waters of that river while. conceding such freedom &amp; From the sea to where the mediating commissioners line strikes ofi trom the Shatt-el-Arab, I do not think, therefore, that a frontier more advantageous to Persia than the mediating commissioners’ line could be successfully claimed agamst Turkey.

I HAVE the honour to address you on the subject of the Arabistan portion of the Perso-Turkish boundary-line. ^ [2412 dd—22] Sir \{ I ill \ , &lt; -I will commence by a brief recapitulation of its history. 2. By article 3 of the Treaty of Erzeroum provision was made for the appointment of a commission to define the Perso-Turkish boundary (vide Aitchison’s “ Treaties ” vol. ix, Appendix 17). This commission, as appears from p. 218 of Hertslet’s “ Persian Treaties,” 189' x held meetings in Bagdad and Mohammerah in 1849-50-51. In 1851 Lord Palmerston stated that it was clear that no settlement could be come to except by an arbitrary decision on the part of Great Britain and Russia, and he therefore proposed that the general line of frontier should be traced by the agents of the Mussulman Powers at Constantinople, assisted by the commissioners, leaving doubtful localities to be settled in detail in future. 3. Ihe Russian Government agreed to this proposal, and the work of surveying the whole frontier was then commenced. In September 1869 a copy of the map thus prepared was officially communicated to the Turkish and Persian Governments, but no boundary was marked on it, the Porte having been informed that, in the opinion of the mediating Powers, the future line of boundary was to be found within the limits traced on the map (a strip of country 20 to 40 miles wide), and that the two Mahommedan Governments should themselves mark out the line. The boundary has remained unsettled to the present day. ' . August 1869 a protocol was concluded between Turkey and Persia for the maintenance of the status quo on the frontier. It was renewed in 1873 and is still in force (vide Aitchison, Appendix 18). ^ ll March 1909 , in discussing the sheikh of Mohammerah’s anxieties regarding lurkish aggression, Sir George Barclay suggested to His Majesty’s Government “that the sheikh might be informed of the substance of Sir E. Grey’s despatch No 75 of the 25th February, 1908, to Sir N. O’Conor, in which the latter was informed that in the Mohammerah district His Majesty’s Government were not prepared to recognize any other frontier than that laid down by the Mediating Commission in 1850.” 6. It is on the subject of this boundary, and the results that would accrue from our upholding it now, that I venture to address you. There is nothing in the pages of Aitchison or Hertslet to show that the Mediating Commission ever “ laid down” a boundary. The declaration of 1865 (vide paragraph 3 boundary 1 ^!^l ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the frontier ma P presented in 1869 did not show a Offl J1 q S ^ confi ^ med . aa inspection of the map, which was published at the Ordnance Office, Southampton, m 1870 (scale 4 miles = 1'). aS far aS i ' com P 1 ® te , information goes, it seems not unreasonable to ppose that the recommendations of the commission in 1851 were cancelled by the declaration referred to above. In any case I can discover nothing to show that the recommendation was ever accepted by the* Persian or Turkish Governments, or that the line recommended was ever marked out on the ground. /1fi 8 : 1 A marginal notef in the first edition of the Survey of India Map of Persia ( mi es makes 10 plain that the boundary referred to by Sir E Grey is that now marked on most maps and shown in the abo^e map* as running from Miya to awizeh (see enclosure (A)).

The shaded red line on enclosure (A) indicates approximately the boundary claimed by the sheikh north of Mohammerah. As far as that portion of the boundary wfa of Hawizeh is concerned, our lack of exact geographical knowledge renders it impossible to lay down the limits of Hawizeh territory with certainty, but the sheikh’s contention that the ground for 6 or 8 farsakhs west, of Hawizeh is and has for many generations been occupied by the tribes tributary to the Wali of Hawizeh, and conse quently to the Persian Government, is fully borne out by such facts as I have been able to ascertain. The extensive irrigation system of Hawizeh extends nearly 16 miles ^ to the west of the town, and, though only a few of the camels are now in use, Sheikh Khazal hopes, by restoring the dam at Kut Nahr Hashim, to bring them into use again. Beyond the area irrigable by the canal system shown on the map extend marshes inhabited by Beni Turuf Arabs, lawless tribes, to punish whom the Sheikh of Mohammerah collected a large force and expended large sums in military preparations last year. 12. But whatever the true line of demarcation be, I venture to think that the boundary referred to in Sir E. Grey’s despatch, which bisects the territory of the Wali of Hawizeh, placing some of' its inhabitants (including the turbulent^Beni Turuf) under Turkish rule, whilst leaving in Persian territory the head-waters of the canal system on which they depend is one which it would be impossible for us to urge upon the sheikh or upon the Persian Government. Its adoption would prevent the steady consolidation of the Sheikh of Mohammerah’s authority west of the Karun, as it would place out of his power the tribes whose incursions into Persian territory are a constant menace to the peace of the district, but who are now under the control of the ; sheikh. It would deprive the sheikh of thousands of acres of valuable date groves and irrigated lands, and entirely upset the status quo. _ . „ 13. I therefore submit that we should altogether disregard the “ recommendations of the Mediating Commission of 1851 as far as they affect the Mohammerah-Hawizeh frontier and simply take our stand on the authoritative Anglo-Russian declaration of May 1865 that the future line of boundary is to be found within the limits of the map which was presented in 1869. . -i i -i • j i -rr This policy will perpetuate the status quo, as is presumably desired by His Majesty’s Government, and will not prejudice the consideration of the question at any future time.

Mohammerah, June 12, 1909. lr ’ IN compliance with your despatch No. 1366, dated the 8th June, regarding Lieutenant Wilson’s letter on the subject of the Perso-Turkish border near Moham merah I have the honour to inform you that I entirely agree with the statements made by him The boundary he shows near Daiaji is that which for some years has to my knowledge been acknowledged as the border by the two loca Governments. I enclose a translation from the French of Cufnet’s “ Turquie dAsie, which confirms this, in so [2412 dd —22] B 2far that the Persian border is on the limits of the Daiaji district. As a fact, there are one or two districts between Daiaji and the creek Nahr Yousif. The names also below that are incomplete, and not arranged in proper order. Mirza Hamza tells me that about thirty years ago a dispute occurred as to the ownership of the limestone, which is found from Daiaji to Mendowan, and is used to make “gach,” and that the prer'at border was then fixed by representatives of the Bussorah and Mohammerah authorities giving the limestone to Mohammerah. In 1892 and 1893 the Turks claimed the right to collect duty on goods from or for, Mohammerah, saying that they did not recognise Mohammerah as foreign territory or that only the town and not the district of Mohammerah were acknowledged as Persian by the Treaty of Erzeroum. This appears not to have been pressed, and gradually dropped, for the claim has not been made since 1894. In 1899 the Bussorah authorities were making an embankment on the Daiaji border, and were extending it across the border. On a personal protest by the Sheikh of Mohammerah’s deputy they withdrew, and since then there have been no disputes as to this border. The Islands of Aghawat and Barin were formerly said to be under dispute; but the Turkish flag has occasionally in recent years been flown there without dispute^ The sheikh or his family own land in Daiaji, and his father, before he became independent of the Cbaab Sheikh, used to reside there at times. In short, to my knowledge, during the last ten years, there has been no attempt to dispute the border as shown by Lieutenant Wilson at Daiaji, and both local Govern ments exercise full authority on their respective sides of that border.

Lieutenant Wilson to Major Cox. Mohammerah, June 12, 1909. WITH reference to my letter of the 29th May, 1909, I have the honour to state that the Survey of India have since informed me that the boundaries on all maps issued by them are inserted by the Foreign Department, and that the Survey of India have no responsibility in the matter. 2. I enclose one copy of a tracing,* sent to me by the Survey of India, of a map bearing on the Turco-Persian boundary claims. I was unfortunately vouchsafed no information as to the authorship| of source of the original ; its value lies in the fact that it corroborates the opinion previously expressed, that the Mediating Commissioners’ line ran direct from Failiyah to Hawizeh. I have, &amp;c. A. T. WILSON. Inclosure 7 in No. 1. Memorandum by Major Cox. IT will be noticed that His Majesty’s consul at Mohammerah in his despatch dated the 12th June last, and addressed to the Political Hesident, Bushire, states that, to his personal knowledge, the boundary shown on Lieutenant Wilson s map at Daiaji has been for some years acknowledged as correct by the two local Governments, while in his letter to Resident dated the 29th December, 1904, of which the purport was forwarded with Residency letter dated the 29th January, 1905, to the Government of India, he stated that the Khayen Creek was the boundary acknowledged by local authorities on both sides. The apparent discrepancy between these two statements is to be explained thus If the boundary-line is taken from the embouchure of the Karun River, it follows the centre of the deep-water channel of the Shatt-el-Arab, passing between the Islands Uman-ul-Rassis, Umm-al-Khassasif, and the Persian mainland until it reaches a point opposite the mouth of the Khayin Creek ; it then leaves the Shatt-el-Arab, and for about 5 miles follows a small creek running parallel to the left bank of that river between the Persian mainland and Agawat and Barm Islands until the village^ of Daiaji is reached. From that point the boundary-line turns almost due north, passing between Daiaji and Saiyid Ghanb {vide map marked B ). His Maiesty’s consul, in his letter dated the 29th December, 1904, was writing on the subiect of Turkish and Persian jurisdiction on the Shatt-el-Arab and therefore quoted the Kayin Creek as the boundary, since west of that creek the frontier-line leaves the Shatt-el-Arab. In his despatch dated the 12th the question was not as to the point at which the frontier-line left the Shatt-el-Arab, but as to the western land frontier of Persia, and he agrees with Lieutenant Wilson that the southern and western frontier-lines should meet at, or m close proximity to, Daiaji. ^ z COXj Ma j or&gt; July 4 1909 Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. o f The authors of this map were the Mediating Commissioner, who dehned the frontier as shown in I860.—A.

Confidential.) Sir, Bushire, May 8, 1910. I HAVE the honour to submit, for your information, a copy of a despatch, with enclosures, which I have addressed to His Majesty’s charge d’affaires at Tehran on the subject of the Turco-Persian boundary on the Shatt-el-Arab. I have ventured to forward the papers direct in case, as seems possible, the question may come into prominence in connection with the current dispute between the Vali of Bussorah and the Sheikh of Mohammerah which is before Government. I have, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel, British Resident in the Persian Gulf. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul-General Cox to Mr. Marling. (Confidential.) Si r Bushire, May 8, 1910. I HAVE the honour to refer to Sir George Barclay’s despatch No. 20, dated the 6th December, 1909, to my address, communicating the views of His Majesty’s Government on certain aspects of the question of the Turco-Persian boundary in the neighbourhood of the Shatt-el-Arab. His Majesty’s acting consul, Mohammerah, submits a further representation, in which, now that he knows for certain which is the documentary boundary suggested by the mediating commissioners in 1850, he urges two additional grounds for the suggestion that, if it is by any means possible, Great Britain should seek arguments which will enable her to disregard the “recommendations” of the mediating commissioners and support an adherence to the boundary line actually recognised by the local authorities on the spot for years past. These two grounds are :— 1. That the mediating commissioners’ paper line is found on examination to throw the sheikh’s personal residence, court-house, &amp;c., at Failieh, and the head of an important creek into Turkish limits. . . . . 2. That whereas the centre of the fairway used by the steameis is^ the dividing line universally recognised in practice for many years past, the commissioners line gives the Porte the whole channel, including two important islands now Persian territory. These considerations are, I submit, of sufficient liveliness and cogency to warrant my submitting the question to you again, in the hope that the position will be reconsidered, and that His Majesty’s Government will perhaps see their way, by arrangement with Russia or other means, to support the existing older of things m the event of the question coming into lively issue. ^ I of course quite realise that it is greatly to the interests of Persia and ourselves that it should not be so raised, and that the present boundary as now practically recognised should rather inure by passage of time Recent events, however, clear y demonstrate the expediency of our knowing definitely, m advance, as far as possible what attitude we can adopt in case we are obliged by force of circumstances to make a declaration on the subject. m ■ i o ^ i ^ t Lieutenant Wilson’s paragraphs speak sufficiently for themselves, and 1 do not think I need add comment, except to say that I generally endorse his remarks. I may mention, however, that I do not quite follow him m paragraph 8 of his letter, and that the page of Mr. Alwyn Parker’s memorandum to which he alludes therein refers to a [2744 ee —2]2 Government of India print. The passage in question will be found in paragraph 6, p. 8, of Foreign Office print, Confidential 8800, dated December 1906.^ I should explain, in conclusion, that although the Acting Consul’s letter is dated the 12th March, and was awaiting me on return to Bushire from leave on the 31st March, Lieutenant Wilson, after discussing the map with me personally a fe\ A days later, asked permission to modify one or two passages. J lis amended letter did not reach me till the latter part of April, and I had not been able to study it up to the moment when the sudden quarrel between the Mali of Bussorah and the Sheikh of Mohammerah supervened, and, curiously enough, threatened to involve this question. I have, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel, British Resident in the Persian Gulf. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Lieutenant Wilson to Consul-General Cox. I HAVE the honour to refer to the correspondence on the subject of the Turco-Persian frontier at Mohammerah forwarded to me under your endorsement of the 8th March, 1910. 2. Sir George Barclay states in his despatch No. 20 of the 6th December, 1909, that the map enclosed in my letter to you of the 12th June, 1909, is that of the mediating commissioners of 1850. 3. This being the case, the discrepancy between the frontier defined by the mediating commissioners and that locally recognised by both sides for many years is greater than I at first thought. 4. Commencing from the north, the line runs from the middle of the town of Hawizeh to Failieh. Any such division of the town of Hawizeh is plainly impracticable, as the country for many miles west of this town is, and has for many years been, in undisputed possession of the same tribes which now occupy the town, and who are tributary to Sheikh Khazal. 5. The mediating commissioners’ line strikes the Shatt-el-Arab on the east bank of the Abu Jidieh Canal, thus placing the sheikh’s court-house and official quarters at this point in Turkish territory, and giving to Turkey the control of the head of this important canal on which extensive date groves depend. Even the sheikh’s palace half-a-mile above Failieh and his two other residences behind the island of Barin and Aqawat would all fall in Turkish territory. 6. Southwards from Failieh the line follows the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, not the main channel. Thus the large islands of Mohallah and Dawasir, now Persian territory, are assigned to Turkey, which has in consequence the full control of both banks of the Shatt-el-Arab at several points south of Mohammerah. 7. Were Turkey to raise the question of the frontier and claim to take possession of all the lands assigned to her by the mediating commissioners in 1851, the Persian Government and the Sheikh of Mohammerah would be deprived of large areas of valuable land, and the Shatt-el-Arab, instead of being under the joint control of Turkey and Persia, would become solely a Turkish stream. 8. The frontier near Mohammerah, as mutually adopted by both sides both now and for many years past, probably does not differ greatly from the status quo provisionally accepted by the Ottoman and Persian commissioners in 1851 (vide 8th paragraph of p. 7 of Mr. Parker’s memorandum), and is shown in detail in the 1 mile = 1 inch maps forwarded to you under my letter of the 18th September and to His Majesty’s Minister under cover of my despatch of the same date. 9. Keeping some 10 miles west of Hawizeh, this line approaches the Shatt-el-Arab near Diaji, where it is marked by a well-defined mud wall. It does not, however, reach the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab, but, turning east, runs parallel to the river about a-mile from the left bank of the main channel or half-a-mile from the boat channel along a small canal. It strikes the main channel at a point 1^ miles above Failieh, and thence is locally considered to run down midstream along the main channel of the river to the open seas. The islands of Mohallah and all other islands on the left side of the main channel are thus admitted to belong to Persia, and no contrary claim has been raised by Turkey as far as is known for the last fifty years or so.'29 3 10.

Your Excellency should make a communication to Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the following effect:— Protocol of December 1911 specifies the clauses of the Treaty of Erzeroum as the basis of work of commission, and omits all reference to ‘'explanatory note.” It is therefore possible that The Hague Tribunal would not take cognisance of the “ explana tory note.” It is important in any case that Persian delegates should not accept that document at this stage, but that they should press for a precise definition of what Turkey claims under it in Mohammerah region, and British and Russian representatives at Constanti nople and Tehran should, I consider, continue to advise Persian delegates and Persian Government in this sense. The justification for Persian demand, apart from the fact that all mention of the “ explanatory note ” is omitted from protocol of last December, is the extravagant claims which Turkey made under the note in 1850. The following is for the confidential information of the Russian Government:— His Majesty’s Government would be unable to recognise the lurkish claims of 1850 if they were now revived. But, owing to failure of Turkey to accept the line recommended by the mediating commissioners in 1850, a frontier has been locally observed for sixty years which is more advantageous to Persia than that line, and His Majesty’s Government could not admit that, in arriving at a final settlement, the argument of uti possidetis should be entirely ignored, though, on a strictly legal interpretation, it may be doubtful whether that argument would prevail, owing to the reservations contained in the Turco-Persian protocol of 1869. &gt; ? Having regard to the wording of article 2 of the Treaty of Erzeroum, His Majesty s Government are inclined to think that nothing more can be claimed on the bhatt-el-Aiah for Persia than freedom of navigation, Turkey having taken great pains to asseit hei right of ownership over the entire waters of that river while, conceding such fieedom. From the sea to where the mediating commissioners line strikes off from the Shatt-el-Arab, I do not think, therefore, that a frontier more ^ advantageous to Persia than the mediating commissioners’ line could be successfully claimed against Tui key. But the point where the frontier as locally observed strikes off from the bhatt-el- Arab is 6^- miles to the west of the mediating commissioners line, and the intervening territory contains the palace and offices of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Persia pioteste in 1850 against the cession of these 6 miles or so to Turkey, and the mediating commissioners had suggested the allocation of territory in question to Tuikey, not m pursuance of the treaty expressis verbis, but in order to secure the safety of naviga ion to Bussorah, which they thought might be endangered if Persia held that particu ar territory. As the experience of sixty years has shown the apprehensions o e commissioners to be groundless, there seems no reason to disturb the sheikh, and His Majesty’s Government would oppose any attempt to do so. ^ , After leaving the Shatt-el-Arab, the mediating commissioners line piocee s m t e direction of Hawizeh. The line as locally observed is some miles to the west o awize . His Majesty’s Government would strongly deprecate, on account of the ioca inconvenience which would be caused, the disturbance of the frontier e\en as oca y observed near Hawizeh.

In 1850 Turkey interpreted the note as changing the very nature of the treaty and as justifying the most extreme claims. These claims being absolutely incompatible with the extreme claim put forward by Persia, the mediating commissioner proposed a line which seemed at that time calculated to secure the interests of both parties. The Turkish Government refused to accept that line, and by their refusal have allowed a situation to continue for sixty years, which could not be disturbed now without throwing the Palace und offices of the Sheikh of Mohammerah into Turkish territory. His Majesty’s Government could not consent to such a violent disturbance of the status quo, w T hich has been accepted for over half a century. It can hardly be supposed that the Porte desire to reopen this question, but the insistence of com missioners on the acceptance of note, and their refusal to reveal the extent of their claims under it, is difficult to explain. It may be result of a misunderstanding, which instructions from the Central Government would remove. The best course would be not to revive discussion of explanatory note, and I propose to inform the Porte in this sense; but, if this is now impossible, instructions should be given tc their commissioners not to insist upon it too much, but to show the Persian Commissioners privately and unofficially what is the extent of their claims on a map, in no case to break off negotiations. It necessary, they might be suspended for a fortnight in order to give i ime for an exchange of views. Your Excellency should ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to send instructions to the Russian charge d’affaires at Constantinople to support Sir G. Lowther in his representations. It is a matter to which we attach great importance. ;OPY 1 O IN Q— CONFIDENTIAL. Sir G. Ixnvther to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received April 6, 8'45 a.m.) (No. 81.) R.

THE Russian Ambassador called at this Office on the 15th instant, and informed Sir Arthur Nicolson that he had been instructed to communicate to me the following statement made by M.

If Turkey, by any means, were to extend her sovereignty to localities having a real importance to the Russinn-Caucasian frontier, then, in that case, the whole policy of Russia in regard to Azerbaijan would have to be reconsidered according to the exigencies of the case, and might have to be radically changed.

Were these expectations to be realised Russia would, as be had already informed Turkhan Pasha, be obliged to reconsider tier whole policy with regard to the regions adjacent to her frontiers. She had hitherto regulated that policy on the presumption that the territory in question belonged to Persia—a weak country, from whom she had nothing to fear. But the situation would be entirely different were Turkey to enter into possession of it, as she could not leave the frontier exposed to the danger of an attack by Turkish troops under German officers. I remarked that if we could prove that Turkey was in illegal possession of the territory in dispute, the fact that she could produce evidence to show that she had during recent years been performing certain administrative acts within it would carry no weight with the arbitrators. The documentary evidence in our possession, such as Kurshid Effendi’s diary and the map communicated to the Erzeroum commission by the Ottoman commissioner in 1843, strongly supported the Persian case. 1 then repeated to his Excellency the language which M. Neratof had held to me last year, as reported in my telegram No. 99 of the 6th May, on the subject of the reference of the whole frontier dispute to The Hague, and asked whether his Excellency shared M Ndratofs views. M. Bazonof said that he must confess that he personally knew nothing about the history of the dispute, and that, therefore, he could onl)- go by what was told to him by those who had made a study of the question. The Persians, his Excellency continued, were as helpless as children ; and we must, therefore, make them clearly understand that they must consult us in all matters connected with the projected arbitration, and that they must designate as one of their arbitrators either a Russian or a British jurist. On my communicating to his Excellency yesterday the substance of your telegram No. 236 of the 15th instant, his Excellency expressed much satisfaction with the assurance that you would be prepared to consider with him the situation which would arise, were the negotiations at present proceeding between the Persian and the Ottoman Governments to break down. In the course of our conversations, M. Sazonof told me that Turkhan Pasha had complained to him of a supposed mobilisation of the Russian troops at Kars, and had said that Turkey would be compelled to take precautionary measures on her side. There was not, his Excellency assured me, any truth in this report, any more than in those which had reference to military preparations at Kieff, Odessa, and other places. Some two years ago there had been a question of reinforcing the Russian troops in the Caucasus, and in view of the uncertainty of the present situation he had insisted in a recent council of Ministers on this being done at once. The 45th Division would, consequently, now be dispatched from Kazan to the Caucasus, so that should necessity arise flying columns could be sent to any points where their presence might be required. He had, however, no intention of forestalling the decision of The Hague Tribunal. The situation was, nevertheless, somewhat disquieting, as according to reports which had reached him the Turks were about to call out the redifs. The two Governments were thus apparently imputing to each other aggressive designs which, so far as Russia at any rate was concerned, were entirely unwarranted. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W.

Both plenipotentiaries, Sir S. Canning states, admit the authenticity of the treaties of Nadir Shah (1746) and Erzeroum (1822) produced at the conferences.

I 4the extracts from the “ Jehan Numa” and “ Tarikh-i-Naimeh ” respectively. The late Sir H. Rawlinson, in his detailed examination of these two extracts, while remarking on their great similarity, points out that “a strange discrepancy, nevertheless, is found in the general tenor of the frontier demarcation,” and finds that this discrepancy arises from the “ omission by the author of the ‘ Jehan Numa ’ of one or two lines of the^ original treaty, the second and third territorial clauses being blended into one, and aC v totally different limitation of territory from that which was _ intended being thus assigned to the two Empires.” The one or two lines of the original treaty, referred to by Sir H. Rawlinson as having been omitted by the author of the “ Jehan Numa,” and which are found in the “ Tarikh-i-Naimeh,” are :— “No interference, moreover, to be admitted on the part of Persia with any of the fortresses, or villages, or lands, or districts, or mountains, or coasts lying within the several acknowledged territories of Akheshkeh, Kars, Van, Shahrizal (Shahrizor), Bagdad and Bussorah.” These lines, it is to be noted, follow immediately after the first clause, concluding in both versions with the words “ as well as the fort of Kizildjeh and its dependencies, &amp;c.” The “ Jehan Numa,” on the other hand, immediately after this first clause, and omitting all reference to the words “No interference, moreover, to be admitted, &amp;c.,” goes on to say : “ Moreover, with regard to Akheshkeh, Kars, and Rawan (Van), the dependencies of Shahrizor, Derah, and Zarudi or Zardiya (Zardeh), &amp;c. These to be given up to Persia, &amp;c.” This, if correct, would of course give Akheshkeh, Kars, Van, and the dependencies of Shahrizor to the latter country,| and would amply justify Sir H. Rawlinson’s comment. At the present day, however, the point seems to me to have lost much if not all of its importance, as Akheshkeh and Kars have been otherwise disposed of, no pretension, as far as I know, having been put forward by Persia to Van since the Erzeroum Treaty of 1848, while as to Shahrizor, both versions in the immediately preceding first clause assign the districts of that place to Turkey. The author of “Jehan Numa” is thus, as regards Shahrizor, apparently in contradiction with himself, and this point is not without importance in estimating the trust worthiness of the respective versions. But if the “ Tarikh-i-Naimeh ” thus disposes of the pretensions to Akheshkeh, &amp;c., of Persia it gives to the latter country “the fortresses lying between Mendallijin (Mendalli) and Dartang.” If this is correct—and the “ Tarikh-i-Naimeh,” it must be remembered, was the version produced by the Turkish plenipotentiaries—it is clear that the plains of Ghilan Derah and Kileh Shahin, which are between Mendalli and Dartang, would remain to Persia, and this is the opinion of Sir H. Rawlinson, who states (Memorandum, p. 4) that he is “inclined to consider this expression vague, though, as it certainly is to apply to the respective positions of Ghilan, Derah, and Kileh Shahin,” and, further (p. 5), after remarking, however, that “ if the grand geographical distinction between the mountains and the plains be attended to, Ghilan, Derah, and Kileh Shahin will belong to Turkey, and the frontier will be the great range immediately to the east of them, but that if, on the other hand, it is our object to disturb as little as possible the principles of distribu tion thereto obtained at present, the districts in question may be judicially allowed to follow the rule of dependency that must be determined in regard to Zohab.” My own impression was that it was intended in the treaty to assign these lands to Persia, but that they remained, nevertheless, in the occupation of the Turks until within the last fifty years. On the other hand, neither the Vienna copy nor the Turkish version (No. 5) make any mention of the fortresses in question, while the “Jehan Numah ” j contains an acknowledgment of the right of Turkey to the plains between Mendalli and Dartang, as do the Vienna copy and the Turkish version (No. o).§ This apparent contradiction, i.e. } the attribution, on the one hand, to Turkey of the “ plains between Mendalli and Dartang,' and, on the other, to Persia of the fortresses between the same places, would seem to be an obscure point in the treaty, nor does the subsequent treaty of 1822, or that of 1848, help to clear it up. In the sketch map, however, to illustrate the ancient and modern frontiers of Zohab and Suleimanieh * * * § * Produced by the Persian plenipotentiary, vide supra. f Bussorah is not mentioned in the k - Jehan Numa.” t The “Jehan Numa” was produced by the Persian plenipotentiaries. § The “ Tarikh-i-Naimeh” has no mention of the “ plains between Mendalli and Dartang,” the reference in this connection being “ Darneh and Dartang, extending as far as the place called Ser Mil and to all the territory lying in and between these districts.” The Persian version (No. 4) “ Mendalli, Derne, Dertent (Dartang), up to Bermail (Sermeel), with the countries therein contained, the plains situated between these two last towns.”(Turkey 57 a), the ancient frontier, “ as defined by treaty,” gives the plains of Ghilan, Enetosur 0 Derah, and Kileh Shahin to Persia, while in the identic map of 1869 the plaius in J? an ^- n g’ s question are merely placed within the limit of the neutral zone, the question being thus 155 0 f left open. The other points in the treaty do not seem to me to call for much comment, 1844. Darneh and Dertent in all five versions being given to the Sultan ; while there can be who doubt as to the attribution to Persia of Derah* and Zardeh, Mihriban and its dependencies, and Avroman and its dependencies, though it is somewhat singular that in the “ Jehan Numa” no mention is made of the latter place. Similarly, the general tenor of the treaty unquestionably leaves Shahrizor to the Sultan, while the stipula tions regarding the demolition of the fortresses of Kileh Zanjir, Kotoor Makow, and Magazberd j (on the side of Kars) are practically the same in all five versions.^ Only, however, in the Turkish version (No. 5) is Sirmil itself expressly attributed to lurkey, and only in this version is it to be found that Azerbaijan belongs to that country. Of the five versions of the treaty, the three which make mention of Bussorah are The “ Tarikh-i-Naimeh ” ( 2 ). The Vienna copy (3). The Persian version (4). The “Jehan Numa” ( 1 ) and, singularly enough, the Turkish version (5) being silent as to this particular place. The Vienna copy (3) and the Persian version (4) are identical in their references, which are as follows :— “ The Shah is to commit no aggression, nor meddle with the fortresses, burghs, provinces, countries, mountains or hills lying between (i.e., on the side of) Akhattzihs, Kars, Van, Cherizoul, Bagdad, and Bussorah. In the “ Tarikh-i-Naimeh ” the reference is :— “No interference, moreover, to be admitted on the part oi Persia with any of the fortresses, or villages, or coasts lying within the several acknowledged teintones of Akheshkeh, Kars, Van, Shahrizoul, Bagdad, and Bussorah. Beyond the references above given, the treaty contains nothing further as^ regards Bussorah, and it wdll be noticed that only the “ Tarikh-i-Naimeh mentions the “ coasts ” in connection with the latter place. The Omissions in the Treaty. 1 . No mention of any place between Bussorah and Jestan (Jessan, about 12 miles to the south or south-west of Bedrai) which could serve to fix the limits of the two Empires between those two places. 2 .

On practical grounds he considers proposal dangerous as he thinks it will be necessary to construct regular training works before or simultaneously with dredging operations and to watch behaviour of river during same. He is of opinion that recent increase of depth upon bar is due to Tafting up of channel connecting bhat- el-Arab with Bahmanshir. Any interference with this channel, even to deepen it without at the same time closely observing eftect on recently formed shoals, might lead to most disastrous results. He recommends that negotiations with Turkey for commission to control river be brought to successful conclusion before any work is undertaken, and that competent engineers be then appointed to draw up comprehensive scheme tor dealing with whole question.

Sir: - Since my last report of the 9th instant concerning preparations for war hy the Military authorities of the Caucasus,! have the honour to inform you, that the 81st Apsheron Infantry Regiment a unit belonging to the 3rd Army Corps of the Cau casus, has been moved from the Northern Caucasus to the town of Gori in the Trans-Caucasus. The forces forming the 1st Caucasian Army Corps are reported to be concentrating in the direction of the Turkish frontier principally about Kars, Sarikamish and other points in those districts. All Government Offices at Batourn are said to have had sealed envelopes placed in the hands of their Chiefs, to be opened only on the outbreak of hostilities, which portend to contain instructions relative to the removal of the offices oo Kuuais. Provision has already been made at the local Treasury to [is Britannic Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.( ^3 to meet the expenditures which such removals would involve. It is difficult to prophesy how soon Russian Military forces are likely to step beyond the bound ary; but to judge from the reports that are being circulated and which have become almost public talk, the date is not far distant. The measures being adopted by the Military authorities are thorough. It is reported that per fect organisation is being everywhere introduced, the forces intended for service in the field are being brought up to a high state of efficiency and equipment, which, combined with the dispositions of troops that are taking place, would seem to abundant ly illustrate that Russia is in earnest and that strenuous efforts are being made by the authorities to prevent anything of the nature of unpreparedness or surprise on the present occasion.

[Enclosed in Sir Stratford Canning’s despatch No. 155 of the 18th July, 1844.] Observations. Persian Memorandum.* From the point of confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates at Korna, the river flows in a general direction of south- east to Bussorah; it is subject to few windings, and the distance has been fixed by survey at 38 miles. If the title of Ears is here used in its general application to the province of that name the description is altogether incorrect, not a single rivulet that rises within the frontiers of the said province finding its way to the Shat-el-Arab. The expression may, however, have a general reference to the Persian territory; and even then, the assertion that all rivers rising within that territory disembogue, like the Karun, into the Shatt-el-Arab, will require to be greatly modified—the fact is that the Karun itself does not dis embogue into the Shatt-el-Arab, the main body of the river finds its way by a separate channel (the Bamishere) to the sea, and is merely connected with the Shat-el-Arab by the artificial cut of the Hafar, on the right bank of which is situated the town of Mohammerah. Independently of this Hafar canal there is only one other stream which joins the Shatt-el-Arab between Korna and the sea and that is the Soweib, which carries off the superfluous waters of the great Ibur of Howeizeh, a huge marshy lake, in which the river Choaspes or Kerkha and the minor streams of the Tib and Dowairej exhaust themselves, and which is also fed from the Tigris through the channel of the Had. There is much confusion in this description. The Bakh- tiari rivers descending to the south-west from the culmina ting ridges of Aosteran Koh, Miyaneh Koh, Zardeh Koh, and Mungusht fall into three distinct channels. The Dizful river to the west, the Karun in the centre, and the Tab or Jerrahi to the east. The waters of the Feili mountains on the contrary flow on the one side into the Kerkha and form on the other side the petty streams of the Gangir, the Abi- Jestan, the Teb, and the Dowairij, which are lost in the marshy plains of Settacene. The streams of Koh Giluyeh unite and fall into the sea at Hindiyan. The river of Shuster is the Kerkha itself, and that of Dizful joins the former at Bandi-Kir, while the river of Bebahan, or which flows near Bebahan, is the main stream of the lab or Jerrahi. The general direction of these streams is south west, and the only channels by which any part of their waters join the Shatt-el-Arab are the Soweib and Hatar. It is begging the question altogether to lay it down as an axiom that the Shatt-el-Arab is the boundary between I ersia and Turkey. Sultan Murad’s treaty expressly names Bussorah as the Turkish limit, and under this head includes of course the acknowledged dependencies of the city which have always been the lands on either side ot the Shatt-el- Arab watered by that river. The claim of Persia to Mo hammerah consists in the latter city being on the Hatar, which is now a continuation of the Karun, and not on the Shatt-el-Arab, but until the present year Persia has never received Maliyat or revenue from Mohommerah. The measured distance between Bussorah and Mohammerah by the river, which has few sinuosities, is 35 miles, and a MOHAMMERAH is situated to the east of the Shatt-el-Arab, which is formed by the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates at a village named Korna, distant 10 farsangs from Bussorah. All the rivers, great as well as small, on the confines of Ears, flow into the Shatt-el-Arab, which continues its course till it disembogues into the Persian Gulf. The Karun is one of the streams which thus unites with the Shatt el-Arab, the latter river passing Bussorah and forming, on the west, the boundary of Nejd and Arabistan. The right of Turkey to the ports which are situated on the western bank of the river is not contested, but those to the east of the Shatt-el- Arab, which forms the boundary of Pars, depend upon that province. All the rivers, great as well as small, which rise upon the borders of Ears, traverse the territory of the Bakhtiaris, of the Dili Lurs, of Karoua (?), of Koh Giluyeh, of Shuster, of Dizful, and of Beba han. and flowing towards the east (“vers I’orient”) disembogue into the Shatt-el-Arab and thence into the Persian Gulf, the western shore of which is formed by Arabistan and Nejd. The Gulf and the above-mentioned river divide the two conti nents, and Mohammerah becomes in consequence a part of the territory of Pars, to which province accordingly it has always paid its revenue. The distance between the latter city and Bussoiah is 4 farsangs by land, by water the interval may be traversed in an hour. The port of Mohammerah is situated on the banks of the Karun, a river which in its descent from Shuster becomes first a con- * Communicated to the No. 41. April 16, 1844. Foreign Office by Colonel Shell, Her Majesty’s [358] Minister at Tehran, in his despatch Bsiderable stream in the neighbourhood of the former place. A preference has been generally accorded to the waters of the Karun over those of the Tigris and Euphrates on account of their superior purity, lightness, and sweet taste. The waters of the Tigris and Euphrates are subject, it is said, to the influence of the atmosphere, becoming warm or cold according to the state of the weather, whilst those of the Karun, on the contrary, are always comparatively cool. During the great heat of summer, indeed, the water of the Tigris and Euphrates is only drinkable during the night, whereas above the junction of the Karun with the Euphrates the former stream may boast through out the year of the peculiarly cool and agreeable flavour of its water, the inhabitants of the country affirming that they never feel the want of ice, and acknowledging that all the best qualities of a good water are to be found united in the stream of the Karun. As Bagdad has different quarters on either side of the Tigris, so also Mohammerah is divided into two parts by the Karun. The northern quarter used to be very populous and surrounded with cultivation, and it contained also the bazaar which is now in ruins. In the southern quarter were situated a fort, with various buildings and mosques, and the popu lation was composed of Arabs of the tribe of Keab. The parties sent periodically by the Arab sheikhs of the Keab tribe to gather in the produce of the date groves had established many depdts on the banks of the Shatt-el-Arab for storing the fruit. Sheikh Fariss, nephew of Sheikh Thamir Khan, was entrusted with the direction of the affairs of commerce, while Sheikh Jaaber acted as the political Governor of Mohammerah. Had not this country been under the rule of the Keab it would have arisen ipto great celebrity—the only draw back to its prosperity consisted in its subjection to the Arabs. It contained about 6,000 houses, which were scattered along the borders of the Karun. Persians from Shuster, Dizful, Howiezeh, Bebahan, and Kazeroon, and others emigrating from Bunder Bushire and its dependencies of Bunder-Big, steamer at ebb tide can just traverse the interval in two hours. Mohammerah is on the Hafar Canal and not on the Karun. At ebb tide the former channel is certainly fdled from the Karun, but at flood the current is reversed, and formerly the natural flow of the waters was in this direction, from west to east. On the contrary, the Karun between Weis and Ahwaz, 100 miles above Mohammerah, is very much larger than the Hafar at the latter place. The excellence of the waters of the Karun and Kerka, “ the drink of kings,” has been proclaimed by the consentient voice of all antiquity and attested by the result of all modern experience. There has been much geographical confusion it is true, in consequence of one river being mis taken for the other, but this question of distinction or identity appears to have the least possible connection with the disputed right to Mohammerah. The name of Mohammerah certainly applied originally to the northern and southern quarters of the town on the Hafar Canal, bu*t for the last twenty years at least it has been restricted to the northern division, the southern quarter having been designated as the Koot-el-Sheikh (the sheikh’s castle) from its being the usual residence of the next heir to the chiefship of the Chaab tribe. Sheikh Jaaber, the Governor of Mohammerah, having rebelled against the chief of Feliahiah, there has been constant fighting between the inhabitants of the two towns separated by the Hafar Canal. Mohammerah being on the mainland while Koot-el-Sheikh was on an island, and thus affording greater facilities for the dispatch of merchandise into the Turkish and Persian territory, was generally visited by traders in preference to the southern quarter. When the Chaab possessed the territory from the sea to Girdelan their storehouses for dates were no doubt established upon the Shatt-el-Arab along the entire line, but at present I know of no depots belonging to the tribe upon the river above the Hafar. Sheikh Jaaber being in rebellion in Mohammerah, S! eikh Fariss was sent from Feliahiah to Koot-el-Sheikh to hold him in check, they never were associated in a common government, but each ruled independently in his own quarter; Sheikh Jaaber, however, addicting himself to commerce, while Sheikh Fariss was chiefly occupied in collecting the date produce of the island of Abadan. No doubt Mohammerah possesses natural advantages of some consequence, being situated in a fertile tract im mediately between the two large navigable rivers of the Shatt-el-Arab and Karun ; but the population of the countries through which these rivers flow must be multiplied tenfold before the demand and supply can be such as to entitle the port to be ranked amongst the great emporia of eastern trade. Personal examination and extended enquiries enable me to state positively the following facts regarding Mohammerah. In its most flourishing state it never contained at the utmost computation above 500 houses, probably not more than 400 of these, be it observed, were almost exclusively reed huts plastered with mud; there were four caravanserais and three temporary sheds used as coffee houses. Sheikh Jaaber once brought a boat load of burnt bricks from Bussorah which he made use of in laying the foundations of his ownhouse and one of the caravanserais, and these were the only bricks that were ever known in the place, reeds and mud w ere the exclusive mat erials used in the other buildings. The transit trade was no doubt flourishing at one time, but a comparison, even in the proportion of their relative extent between Mohammerah and our Indian capitals is preposterous in the extreme. As for the lakhs of gold and silver money n daily circulation, no one that 1 have ever conversed with believe it possible that there could have been at any one time a lakh of rupees collected in Mohammerah. The staples of export and import were respectively dates and rice, and at all times three-fourths of the inhabitants were Arabs. Genaweh, Dilem, and Rishahan assembled at Mohammerah and built bazaars, khans, caravan serais, and coffee bouses. The place became so flourishing that the rent of a single room in a caravanserai amounted to 10 kurusb (ain) per mensem, a sum equivalent to fifteen Shiraz rupees, and the merchants were only too glad to secure accommodation at that exorbitant rate. Wealthy and respectable merchants in fact have certified that the condition of Mohammerah was at one time so flourishing as to rival Calcutta and Bombav, not considered in regard to its actual extent, but as being more populous and celebrated than either of the above-mentioned cities in refer ence to the space which they relatively occupied. Agha Abdul Mahommed, a merchant who visited Mohammerah before the expedition of the Pasha of Bagdad on certain commercial affairs of his own, has taken oath also that during his residence of one month in the place lakhs of gold and silver ’his geographical description is quite unintelligible, the d distance from the sea to Gtirdelams about 7o miles vou ascend the river the isle of Abadan stretches for ,ut 50 miles on the right, and this is all Chaab territory, , quite independent of Mohammerah ; then occurs the uth of the Hafar Canal with about a mile of territory the Shatt-el-Arab belonging tolfoh^nuerali Above you re for two miles the date groves of Bujidee, e^tiv^ed by , Chaab, but paiing revenue to the Bawee Arabs t h ur for four nules the lands of lamur inhabited by the aabies subject to Fellahiah, but paying revenue to IS iband above that point the Muntifik and o her rkish subjects possess the entire territory for 19 miles o Bussorah.

On the eastern bank of the Shatt-el-Arab fiom the head of the Persian Gulf as far as Girdelan, opposite to Bussorah, the port of Mohammerah occupies to the south a space of 4 farsangs. ^ The whole of this tract produces dates and other limits, and it also contains within its limits fourty-four forts belonging to the Keab Arabs. Amongst the Arabs of those parts there are two particular tribes, named respectively Derissis and Ansar, who have risen into great power, and to whom is owing the ruin of Mohammerah, Jaaber having been deputed by Sheikh Thamir Khan to govern Mohammerah, appropriated to himself the entire revenues which arose from the gardens without admitting the Keab Arabs to any partici pation. On the arrival accordingly of the Pasha of Bagdad, and enmity having at the same time broken out between the two tribes, a project was formed for the assassination of Jaaber, who, how - ever, obtaining information of the plot three days after the Pasha’s arrival and before any slaughter had commenced, fled away in a boat with his- family and servants. On this intelligence getting abroad, the whole population was seized with a sort of panic and cast themselves mto the waters of Shatt; women and children unable to swim perished in the waves, about 4,000 s mis were carried into slavery by the Arnaouts and Turkish soldiers, others saved themselves by flight. The [358] B 24 Mahommedans of Bussorah purchased many of these children for 18 or 20 kurnah a-head, and restored them to their parents. From Mohammerah to the town of Fellahiah on the River Jerrahi, where the sheikhs of the Keab trihe have their residence, merchandise is con veyed in small boats named by the inhabitants £ ‘belem ” and “ shuyeh,” as well as in the large boats which navigate the Shatt-el-Arab. The distance from Mohammerah to Fellahiah amounts to 10 farsangs ; the usual method of performing the journey is in small boats upon the river, but the traveller can, if he desires, ride along the hanks on horseback, being obliged, nevertheless, at two places to take his saddle and other property into a boat and cross his horse over the streams which oppose his progress by swimming. The River Jerrahi, formed by the junction of three streams named respectively the Kurdistan, the Bebahan, and the Ram Hormuz, directs its course towards Fellahiah ; but before reaching that city it divides itself into five branches, two of which only pass through the place. At three different spots the lands are irrigated and devoted to a large extent of rice cultivation. The country for the space of 30 farsangs presents a very com pact (tres uni) appearance, and belongs to the Keab Arabs, who are employed in every species of agriculture. The whole territory along the course of the river is extremely fertile, the water which remains after the wants of the cultivation are supplied being carried off by a subterranean passage [ ? ]. The plain, moreover, produces a vast quantity of reeds which are both used for fuel and in the construction of all the houses that are not intended for the sheikhs and great people. 4 rom Arkoot Mihna, a village which is situated in the district of Zeidan, containing also seven other villages and two forts named Deh Moolah and Bunder Hindonam, as far as Fellahiah, the capital of ► Sheikh lhamir Khan, the cultivation of corn and green vegetables (legumes) is general. Sheikh Thamir Khan’s various possessions extend over a space of ten stages upon each side [ ? ] the lands being watered by the rivers Jerrahi and Zeidan, and the revenues which are realised from the cattle and pasture grounds accruing to the said sheikh. Mohammerah possesses a port which, had it not The water communication between Mohammerah and Fellahiah is by the artificial canal which connects the Jerrahi with the Karim, and the navigability of this canal by vessels of a greater or less draught depends entirely on the state of the great dyke on the Jerrahi. When this dyke is in repair belems can alone ascend the canal when it is destroyed the usual river boats of the Karun can be tracked to Fellahiah. I have always understood the banks of the Fellahiah Canal to be so densely covered with reeds as to be altogether impassable to a horseman. I do not understand how the traveller would require to cross two rivers; it appears to me that between Moham merah and Fellahiah the bed of the Karun itself would form the only obstruction. This descript'on of the Jerrahi is exceedingly incorrect. The Kurdistan, the Bebahan, and the Earn Hormuz are all the same, the three names being applied to the Jerrahi in different parts of its course; the only affluent of conse quence that joins this river after leaving the mountains west of Bebahan is the united stream of the Ab Allah and Abi- Zard, which falling into the Kurdistan in the plain of Earn Hormuz forms the Jerrahi, identical with the Oroatis of the ancients and the Tab of the Arab geographers. At present two branches of this river, named the Jungeri and Kolfi, leaving the mainstream a few miles above Fellahiah, unite and form the Nahr-i-Busi, which disembogues into the sea at the Khur-i-Musa, the remaining waters are divided between the Boteynaut, the Fellahiah, and the Eaghiodhee, the Fellahiah passing through the town of that name and joining the Karun about 15 miles above Mobammerah, and the other two canals being consumed in the irrigation of the Chaab lands. I have never heard of this “ souterrain,” and conclude, therefore, the allusion to be to the mere absorption of the superfluous waters. Between the district of Zeidan, which is on the river of Hindiyan, usually named Zohreh,and formed by the united streams of the Abi-Shur and Abi-Shirin and the rich country of Fellahiah on the Jerrahi, the interval, 50 or 60 miles in extent, is entirely desert and devoid of permanent inhabitants. It belongs to the Chaab, but is only of value for its winter pasturage. The general shape of the Chaab territory is triangular, that is, taking as a base the sea coast from the mouth of the Shat to the mouth of the Zohreh (the Brizana of antiquity), the western side will be formed by the Shat, the Hafar, and the Karun, and the eastern by the course of the Zohreh to Deh Moolah, and by an imaginarv line stretching from that point to the Karun, the point of inter section of the two sides being at Weiss, which thus becomes the apex of a triangle. The extreme distance from north to south is about 100 miles and from east to west 80 mil es. rritorp. for so” ■ butft 6 IPs arf i 1 He tillage of i ibteMahiali; *tliii river is E smtiT is thinly kt lietween thi uteri by cana ierrapted line i direction is soul ikMr-i.Busi ib-i-Busi; jThe province of Nejd is 'the high plateau of Central Arabia, distant some 500 miles at its nearest point from Bussorah, and the name is never applied to the valley of the Euphrates. 4 j i It would appear from this that Persia claims the left bank of the Shat and the Tigris as her boundary from the sea to near Bagdad, but I know not the grounds upon which the claim depends. At present she does not possess any territory on the river above Mobammerah. Gird elan was certainly built by Persian colonists about 100 years ago and continued with the adjoining villages subject to Howeizeh for some years after Nadir Shah’s Turkish conquests; but the lands watered by the Shat from Girde- lan to the sea are, nevertheless, registered in the Bussorah records as dependencies of that city from the earliest period to which such documents ascend, and all the ancient geographical notices confirm this territorial allotment. been destroyed, would have become very cele brated. The whole country to the west of the Shatt-el-Arab from the Persian Gulf to Girdelan opposite to Bussorah, is included in the territory of Nejd ; but Girdelan is to the east of the river, where the country, for a space of 80 farsangs, belongs to the province of Pars. Throughout all this tract the date palm flourishes, the groves in many places stretching for a space of 8 farsangs, in others being limited to 3 farsangs. Besides dates the country also, which belongs exclusively to Sheikh Thamir Khan, produces oranges, citrons, figs, grapes, pomegranates, plums, peaches, &amp;c. The Keab tribes of Edres and Ansar occupy the gardens on the banks of the Shatt-el-Arab. the eastern shores of which are held to be an integral part of the territory of Ears. There are forty-six forts which acknowledge the rule of the Keab Arabs. The houses which are built within these forts and around them are constructed of earth, of bricks, and of the wood of the date tree ; the The village of Sadireh is on the Jerralii about 40 miles above Fellahiah; the extreme Chaub possession, however, on this river is Khalafabad, 15 miles above Sadireh. 1 be country is thinly inhabited from Khalafabad to Old Doorak, but between that point and Fellahiah the cultivation watered by canals from the Jerrahi, continue in an un interrupted line and maybe increased to any desired extent. buildings and edifices which surround the gardens are inhabited by the Keab subjects who are employed in gathering in the fruit. As for the rice and corn, of which the produce is very con siderable, the sheikh enjoys the entire revenues. The village of Sadireh, which is situated at the distance of 8 farsangs from Fellahiah, is one of the dependencies of the Sheikh, it may be reached either by land or by water. Agents are maintained there by the chiefs to superintend the cultivation of the wheat and barley. The families occupied in husbandry amount The direction of the Jerrahi from Bam Hormuz to Fellahiah is south westerly, and from that point to the se the Nahr-i-Busi runs due south. Bunder Maashar is on the sea near the mou ^ h ? f , Nahr-i-Busi; it is distant about 30 miles from Fellahia and nearly 70 miles from Sadireh by the river. to about 200 . The water for irrigation comes from the Jerrahi which runs easterly “ vers 1 ’orient ” towards Fellahieh. Maashar occurs at the distance of 4 farsangs from Sadireh. H.

Sir, f In continuation of tlie letter of this Office dated the 12th inetent^ as to arrangements for the con servancy of the Shatt-al-Arab, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to address you regarding the further correspondence mar ginally quoted* that is now before the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. In so far as concerns the wording of the Treaty of Erzeroum (1848), the Earl of Crewe recognizes that it might be taken to imply the right of * Admiralty letter to India Office, M 6550, dated 17tli May 1911.

Turkey to control the Shatt-al-Arab from bank to bank, subject only to free liberty being accorded to Persia to navigate it. This view might find support in the suggestions of the Mediating Commissioners in 1850, regarding the boundary in the neighbourhood of Mohammera. In this connexion I am to solicit reference to the corre spondence ending with this Office letter of 26th August 1910, and to say that the Earl of Crewe does not altogether share the opinion of his predecessor on the question therein discussed. That the Turks are in possession of the Commissioners’ map, which would appear to assign to them the whole of the river, is undoubtedly inconvenient, as is also the circumstance that the two Powers pressed the Porte in 1850 to accept the Commissioners’ line. But the Porte declined to do so, and in His Lord- ship’s opinion the situation thus created must be held to be governed by the communication made to them in 1869, when the representatives of the Powers handed in a map on which no line at all was drawn. This identic map seems to have been the basis of all subsequent discussions, and Lord Crewe sees no reason for going behind it, or for permitting the Turks to go behind it to an earlier map, which their own ill-judged action had caused to be superseded. It might further be pointed out to the Turkish Government, if necessary, that by their rejection of the line proposed in 1850, they have allowed a situation to grow for 60 years in which mid-channel has, without challenge, been accepted by local usage as the boundary, and that this is consequently the status quo on the observance of which His Majesty’s Government must insist. As regards the approaches to the Shatt-al-Arab, as distinct from the channel, there may be presumed to be no question but that Turkish and Persian rights are regulated by general considerations of international law, instead of exceptional treaty stipulations. Subject, therefore, to The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.♦ HOI 2 any observations of Secretary Sir E. Grey, Lord Crewe does not consider that, as between Turkey and Persia, the case presents any special difficulty. As regards, however, the privileged position of Great Britain, the ground is not so secure. British enterprise has in the past done all, or most, of what has been effected to secure the navi- gabdity of the Shatt-al-Arab, but the upkeep of buoys and charts, and the provision of lights might have been carried out with greater thoroughness (with the result that the present situation might have possibly been avoided), and it seems certain that, whatever services Great Britain might render in future, they would not be held from any legal standpoint to substantiate a claim upon her part to control the waterway between two independent countries. Lord Crewe would therefore suggest that while Great Britain may reasonably insist on equitable treatment in view of her past services and the magnitude of her shipping interests, she should admit the legal rights of Turkey and Persia and act as suggested in the telegram of the Government of India, dated the 16th instant, namely induce Persia, if possible, (1) to object to Turkey’s claim to assume the whole control of the river, and (2) to accept Great Britain as her delegate in the matter. The possession of equal influence with Turkey would presumably be sufficient to obtain acceptable arrangements in the Shatt-al-Arab, since otherwise its navi gation might be made impossible, and, if no International Commission were set up, the situation would not be so likely to arise in which another European Power might claim to intervene. As regards the important question raised by the Naval Commander- in-Chief’s report as to the superiority of Basrah as compared with Koweit, as the terminus of the Bagdad Railway, Lord Crewe feels some doubt whether the report should in itself be regarded as of a decisive character. Though he speaks with some diffidence on the point, he imagines that there must remain at least an element of uncertainty as to the stability of conditions at the bar, and it is more than likely that in course of time the navigability of the river will be detrimentally affected, if not destroyed, by works of irrigation. The matter appears to call for further careful consideration between the Departments concerned. Copy of this letter is being communicated to the Admiralty and the Board of Trade.

He fears that commission will break up in a very short time, as Turkey is sure to put forward impossible pretensions. His Excellency then spoke to me very seriously of the situation. He had, he said, good reason to know that Turks had been collecting documents such as deeds of sale for a lono- time past, whereas Persians had no legal documents wherewith to support their case. If the question went to The Hague it would be judged solely on its legal merits, and the Turks would win the case on the strength of documents they could produce.

Inform Russian Government that we propose that Mr. Shipley should leave here for Constantinople about 21st March, but that we do not consider that two embassies should communicate to litigants for the present more documents than are essential; by this I mean that I do not wish to contribute to the breakdown of negotiations at Constantinople by rigidly withholding documents, but I think that the time for affording such assistance as we can will he later rather than at the present stage, and I should like to arrive at a full agreement with Russian Government before taking action. A full statement on the question is being prepared here, and early next month will be communicated to Russian Government, our desire being to agree with the Russian Government as to the evidence the two Powers should jointly furnish at a later stage. As recent Turkish encroachments have not extended to the frontier south ot Khanikin we presume that discussions at Constantinople will relate more particularly to the more Northerly districts ; this will obviate for the present necessity of communicating any documents relating to Mohammerah, and I trust that,_ pending communication ol the above-mentioned statement, Russian Government will at once instruct t ieir Ambassador at Constantinople to withhold such documents. For your confidential information I would add that His Majesty s Government aie anxious that the frontier as locally observed at Mohammerah should not be disturbed. That frontier differs, to the advantage of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, from the one recommended by the Mediating Commissioners in 1850.

I propose shortly to furnish you with a copy of a detailed memorandum which is now being prepared, on the basis of important correspondence which has recently been procured from the Record Office, on the subject of the frontier at Mohamraerahj and I shall then request Your Excellency’s observations on certain aspects of that question. The points upon which I now desire an expression of opinion from Your Excellency are two:- (1) Do you consider that there is any prospect of the Ottoman Government being induced to submit the frontier dispute to a Mixed Commission at Constantinople in the event of the impending Turco-Persian negotiations proving abortive? (il) Do you consider that an attempt to persuade the Ottoman Government to adopt such a course would, if\ T it were confined to friendly ana infornul repreeenta tions, be open to eerlouB objection from the point of • viev of Mplo-Turkish relatione? Excellency's attention to eection(b) of the accompany ing memorandum; and I would also ask you to bear in mind that, even If the dispute is brought before the Hague Tribunal, the Persian Government is likely to re quest Great Britain and Russia to furnish certain in formation, which the two Powers could not equitably refuse to communicate, and which - being the Joint and } reasoned conclusions of t»wo Great* Powers $ho, di. ring a long period of mediatrion, made careful enquiries into the merits of the dispute • will Incontestably exercise a profound influence upon the terms of the arbitral award. If then, Turkey is not in a position in any case to preclude the evidence of Great Britain enci Russia, there would seem to be no orlma facie reason why she should object to the substitution of a Mixed Commission at Constantinople for the more formal luthocl of a 6. In relation to the first point, I would draw Your reference(8437/12) reference to the Hague Tribunal, especially as the pro cedure proposed would bw considerably less costly. 7&gt; The constitution of the proposed Mixed Coranission would be a matter for agreement between the Ottoman and Persian Governments; and it might be desirable for-the British and Russian delegates not to sit upon the Com mission, but merely no act as Assessors, or in some other capacity to be determined later. The proposal might be more palatable to Turkey if some British sub ject enjoying Turkish confidence in a special degree were appointed to serve in the capacity in question. ^ Tho ground upon which Hie Majesty's Government would prefer tho question to be decided at Constantinople rather than at the Hague is that it would seem to be proceedings at the Hague Tribunal any considerations based upon political expediency, such as that of the importance of the territorial status quo at Mohaataerah; whereas at Constantinople it might be more feasible to control in some measure tho ultimata issue.

I era, with groat truth end respect. Sir, Your Exeolleney'e most obeuient, humble Servant, fI VENTURE to draw special attention to the last paragraph of this despatch, containing the opinion of the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs and of the Persian Ambassador at Con stantinople that the Turco-Persian Frontier Com mission is unlikely to come to any agreement at Constantinople, and that the matter will have eventually to be referred to the Hague Tribunal. It will be recalled that on 21st December, 1911, the Turkish and Persian Governments signed a protocol, of which article 4 is as follows:— “ 4. Dans le cas ou les delegu^s des deux parties ne tomberaient pas d’accord sur I’interpre- tation et lapplication de certaines clauses de ce traite, au bout dune periode de six mois de negociations, pour solutionner completement la question de la delimita tion des frontieres, il est entendu que tons les points sur lesquels il y aurait divergence seront soumis ensemble a la Cour arbitrale de la Haye afin que la question entiere soit ainsi definitivement tranchee.” Before the Commission meets at Constantinople it seems desirable that His Majesty’s Government and the Russian Government should look ahead and consider how a reference to the Hague Tribunal is likely to affect their respective in terests and their prestige; whether the cases of the litigants, and more especially that of Persia, can be drawn up without the co-operation of Great Britain and Russia ; whether it is desirable that Great Britain and Russia should, either by advice or supplying important documents in their possession, facilitate a reference to the Hague [381] B2 Tribunal; and whether, in the probable event of the Turco-Persian negotiations at Constantinople proving abortive, an effort should not first be made by Russia and Great Britain to solve the dispute by means of a Mixed Commission com posed of a British, a Russian, and a third delegate or more, possessing powers of arbitration or, if Turkey declines as in the past to admit arbitra tion, then of mediation. (a.) The question of British and Russian interests and prestige. The Turks and Persians have bound themselves, failing agreement after six months’ negotiation at Constantinople, to refer the whole dispute to the Hague Tribunal: according to article 45 of the “ Convention for the Pacific Settlement of Inter national Disputes ” (1907), each party selects two arbitrators, who must be chosen from the general list of members of the Court,* and one of whom may be its own national. It is not possible to forecast the constitution of the Court; but it is highly improbable that Turkey would choose a Russian arbitrator and not likely, for obvious reasons, that she would choose a British one ; Persia would perhaps be more likely to select a British or a Russian arbitrator. But, however this may turn out, it seems far from likely that the Umpire would be either a Russian or a British member of the Court. The upshot of this is that British and Russian arbitrators may be excluded altogether: and, in any case, if the matter goes before the Hague Tribunal, the British and Russian Governments cannot, even in the very improbable contingency of a majority of the arbitrators being Russian and British, exercise a decisive influence on the judg ment of the Court. On the other hand, we possess so many leading documents, and so much evidence, indispensable to the successful preparation of the Persian case, that we possibly could induce Persia to allow her case to be represented by an advocate possessing the confidence of Great Britain and Russia : but the precise effect of such representation on the terms of the award would of course be quite uncertain. * The general list includes the following British members: Sir E. Fry, Sir E. Satow, Sir C. Fitzpatrick, and Lord Desart.1 Mr. Curzon’s “ Armenia.” (London: 1854.) Sir S. Canning. Memoirs. 3 It must not be overlooked tbat Russian in terests are involved in tlie frontier dispute in the north, as are British interests in the south m relation to Mohammerah and the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab : and an award prejudicial to those interests would prove highly embarrassing. Moreover, even if the Hague award proved not inconsistent with such direct interests, it might not redound to the prestige of Great Britain and Russia, while possibly furthering that of other Powers, for a solution of the dispute to be thus found independently of the two Powers who, at such great sacrifice of labour and money,' have mediated for 70 years. In estimating the effect of this mediation, it should be borne in mind— though the actual boundary delimitation has never prospered—that it was wholly and entirely owing to the exertions of the British and Russian Commissioners that the Kurdish tribes upon the frontiers were kept down for more than ten years, at a time when the great massacre at Kerbela had rekindled the old animosity of Shiite against Sunnite to a dangerous heat, and that indeed, ever since, the population from Bussorah to Mount Ararat has enjoyed a relative state of tranquillity and prosperity, such as was unknown in the memory of man. (b.) Can the cases of the Contracting Parties be drawn up without British and Russian assistance ? (i.) Turkey: In 1875 Turkey accepted, conditionally, the frontier zone of the Anglo-Russian Identic map of 1869, and this acceptance on the part of Turkey may prove a point of some importance, and possibly a governing consideration, in framing the award at the Hague. Appreciation of this, and of the importance likely to be attached by the Court to neutral testimony, may compel Turkey to seek the support and evidence of Great Britain and Russia regarding certain contested points within the frontier zone. But it seems more probable that Turkey may dispense altogether with Anglo-Russian assistance. She can put forward a claim, based on Dervish Pasha s fantastic map and on spurious documentary * * Great Britain alone has spent over 100,000/. on work connected with the Turco-Persian frontier.—A. P.proofs collected by that officer, to places outside the frontier zone; and, on the flimsy pretext of temporary occupation in the past, she might, if earlier pretensions were again put forward, lay claim to such places as Tabreez and even Kazvin. Colonel Shell to T , , , -i n ., -t , , , the British Com- It must not be forgotten, however, that though missioners at the Treaty of Ezeroum (1847) is to be the basis of -E rzerou DU August 29 and the arbitration, that instrument only deals September 27, specifically with certain regions of the frontier, 1843 ‘ confirming, in regard to other portions, the ante cedent treaties, of which the most important is that of 1639. Neither Persia nor Turkey could produce the original text of this treaty 70 years ago, much less now ; and the only reliable infor mation on the subject of the text is in the possession of His Majesty’s Government and the Russian Government. On this point, therefore, Turkey might have to appeal to those Govern ments. (ii.) Persia ; With Persia the case is materially different in various respects. In the first place the Persian Government intimated definitely in 1875 that they would agree to the arbitration (as distinct from mediation) of the British and Russian Commissioners, and accept any line which they might lay down within the frontier zone of the Anglo-Russian “ identic ” map. Persia appears to have lost, at the time of the bombardment of the Medjliss in 1908, such scanty papers as she still possessed ; and for documentary proof of her claims she would seem to be largely, if not entirely, dependent upon the British and Russian Governments. (c.) Is it desirable that Great Britain and Russia, either by advice or by the provision of important documents in their possession, facilitate a reference to the Hague Tr ibunal 9 The Persian Government have now asked for copies of the proces-verbaux of the Conferences of Erzeroum (1843-1847) and Bagdad and Mohammerah (1848-1850). It is, however, important to note, in determining whether this request should be acceded to or not, that the proces-verbaux of the Persian and TurkishColonel Williams, No. 12, February 12,1844. Sir Stratford Canning, Septem ber 17, 1851. Sir Arnold Kemball, Septem ber 14, 1907. Commissioners were taken down in their re spective languages, and probably differed essentially from those drawn up, principally in French, on behalf of the British and Russian Mediating Commissioners. In fact the present request made to us by Persia is for papers which she has never .actually possessed. It seems most undesirable to communicate those relating to Mohammerah to Persia with a view to their submission to the Hague Tribunal, as it would bring to public notice matters relating to the territorial position in those regions: and it is desirable, for reasons set forth in detail in a separate memorandum which is being prepared on the Mohammerah question, not to abandon any control we may possess as to the ultimate demarcation of this portion of the frontier. On the whole I think it is not to the interest of Great Britain to promote a reference to the Hague Tribunal. Apart from other arguments, it is questionable whether we are serving our interests by advancing money to Persia in the shape of a loan, if she is to incur heavy liabilities for an arbitration at the Hague, which may be so costly as to run into six figures. (d.) the Turco-Persian negotiations at Con stantinople prove abortive, should an attempt be made by Great Britain and Russia to settle the dispute by means of a Mixed Commission to meet at Constanti nople ? The past history of this question does not encourage a fresh attempt at intervention. But the experience of Great Britain and Russia has at least served to bring out one consideration clearly : any such attempt, to quote the words of Sir Stratford Canning, is bound to terminate in a fruitless and discreditable failure, unless it has been provided beforehand that the decision arrived at shall be final. Lord Palmerston, in commenting on the views of Sir Stratford Canning and his Russian colleague at Constanti nople, expressed the opinion that the boundary between Turkey and Persia could never be finally settled except by an arbitrary decision on the part of Great Britain and Russia. As recently as 1907, General Sir Arnold Kemball [381] C6 wrote :—“ The facts as traced and recorded by yon amply justify the conviction that has always possessed me, that if practical results are to be obtained .... arbitration must be conceded to supersede mediation for the determination of final issues not otherwise reconcilable. Even so, the proposed change must still fail of effect unless fortified by preliminary agreements, * recognising the neutrality of a well-defined zone —say that of 1869 (viz., that of the identic map) . . . .” No one was more intimately acquainted with the Turco-Persian frontier question in all its complicated aspects than Sir Arnold Kemball. It is apparent from the above enumeration of views that an attempt at Anglo-Russian mediation would be futile, foredoomed to failure, and possibly harmful in its effects. It remains to consider whether any means can be devised for inducing the Porte to agree to some form of arbitration at Constantinople: Turkey has now agreed to submit the whole question to the Hague Tribunal, and there seems no primd facie reason why, such being the case, she should object to the less costly procedure of a Mixed Commission of Arbitration at Constanti nople, especially since, in any case, even if the dispute goes to the Hague, Anglo - Russian influence cannot be entirely excluded, inasmuch as the support of the two Powers is essential to enable Persia to state a case at all. It is indeed hardly conceivable that Turkey would abandon her interests to the absolute and uncontrolled arbitral decision of Russia in this question ; much less in fact now than in the past, since Russia is a by no means disinterested party. But it might be possible to induce Turkey, and at any rate worth trying to induce her, to agree to the arbitration of a Mixed Commission, composed of Russian and British Delegates (who might be members of the two Embassies), and of three other Delegates of legal standing nominated by minor European Powers. I think it is undesir able that a French Delegate should be proposed, owing to the special political relation in which France stands to Russia : it is of course important, if the Mixed Commission is to be accepted by Turkey, in lieu of the Hague Tribunal, that it should, apart from Anglo-Russian participation, ns far as possible be judicial as distinct from political in constitution.7 1 \ v r. ; I would suggest that a note should be sent to the Russian Government reviewing the more important aspects of this question ; sum marising the existing situation as it presents itself to His Majesty’s Government; expressing the view that a frank and detailed interchange of opinion between Great Britain and Russia, who have acted in close co-operation in this question for so many years, is desirable in order to avoid confusion of purpose in the circumstances which have now arisen ; and proposing that if, after two months’ negotiation, the Turco-Persian Commis sion has reached no conclusion, then we should recommend the appointment of 'a Mixed Com mission with powers of arbitration to sit at Constantinople. Before, however, adopting this course, it would seem desirable to consult the India Office, and also His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople. A. P.
