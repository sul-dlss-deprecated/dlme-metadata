In regard to other matter, however, such as Shaikh's dealings with his tenants or with produce of his gardens or other commercial transactions carried out in 'Iraq they cannot agree that Shaikh should be free to institute civil proceedings in 'Iraq Courts while himself refusing to appe ar as defendant through his ''''SWlMl i il - authorised representative in Basra in cases v/hich might be brought against him.

S # We are advised that we must start from the fact that there is a rule of international law that foreign sovereigns and governments are exempt from the jurisdiction of the courts of other States. This rule is recognised by the municipal laws of other foreign countries; and, whether or not Iraq has incorporated express provisions in her God© to this effect, she will ultimately be obliged to recognise it also, as she is subject to the general rules of inter national law, and in cases where His Majesty's Government are themselves concerned, they will have to insist on respeot for this rule on the part of the Iraqi Government, 3. This exemption from the jurisdiction of foreign courts may however be, and indeed probably is, subject to an exception which is important in the present case and which/ ieutenant-Colonel Sir Francis Humphrys, G«C # H«6*, G.C .V .O#v&gt; whioh is nientioned below; but perhaps I should first explain the position in oases where this exception does not apply. In such oases we are advised that the foreign sovereign can never be sued as defendant unlese he voluntarily chooses to submit to the jurisdiction of the foreign court in question^ but that he eim nevertheless, when, he ohooses, sue as plaintiff« In other words f precisely the circurastances to which the Iraqi Government profess to object in the case of the Sheikh of Koweit's suite apply generally in connexion with proceedings brought by and against foreign sovereigns. Other foreign States accept this position as following from the rules of general international law, and Iraq will have to realise sooner or later that she imist do the s^e # I assume that the Iraqi Government do not dispute the character of the Sheikh of Koweit as a foreign sovereign; if they tid try to dispute this, we should, of course, have to insist strongly on our view to the contrary. 4# I come now to the exception to which I alluded above. Where a foreign sovereign owns real property in the territory of another State, there may be an exception made to the rule which I have described in the preceding paragraph, in so far aa actions relating to the title to such property in the courte of the other State are concerned. It is not possible to say finally whether such an exception does in fact obtain, because authorities on international law differ as to the degree of immunity conferred by sovereign status as regards the ownership of land, but the possibility that this may be so, or that the Iraqi Government may be able to claim that it is so without our being able to prove that it is not, has to be taken into account. As a result, we are bound/1/&gt; bound to consider that, so far as the actions brought in the Iraqi courts as regard© land are concerned, it is probably true to say that the Sheikh had no right to deny the jurisdiction of the Iraqi courts, hJven assuming, however, that this were so f is it any reason for the Iraqi Government to interfere and make trouble in connexion with the actions which the Sheikh has brought as plaintiff? Their attitude is really only explicable on the assumption that they wieh to raake things difficult for the Sheikh, because he has denied the Jurisdiction of their courts in the cases in which he would have been defendant. We can well understand that they my not wish to admit the Sheikh's right to deny the jurisdiction of their courts in caaes relating to title to land in Iraq, but they can quite well avoid committing themselves on this point, and there seems no reason for them, from this point of view, to isake diffi culties in connexion with the actions which the Sheikh brings m plaintiff. It would hardly in fact be in the Iraqi Government's own interest to asaist the conduct of the actions brought against the Sheikh, since they wish (or profess to wish) to assist us in reaching a settlement and presumably they do not therefore want matters to come to such a point that, owing to the complete failure of the Sheikh to obtain satisfaction in the Iraqi courts. His Majesty's Government have to make claims against the Iraqi Government in order to secure compensation for him. Yours ever, { Sgd, ) G,W, RKbDiSL,CONFIDENTIAL. No. iO-S of 1936.

It is to be regretted that the Shaikh of Kuwait has so far declined to coamit himself to a written list of his proper ties, a reluctance which is encountered in one form and another in connection with noat of the difficult Kuwaiti questions with which His ajesty's .Uabassy is concerned. Por the purpose of considering the questions generally however, the detailed and valuable straaaries provided by Colonel 3iokson appear to be adequate, as they sore or less confirm and amplify the informa tion alrasdy in our poesession. It is to be hoped that the Political -Resident will be able to obtain the written concurrence of the Shaikh, for which he has called, in the accuracy of the lists, so as to leave no room for the Shaikh to claim subse quently that properties not included therein are 'exeapted properties'. 4. It was r. Ogilvie-Porbes' intention, as expressed in paragraph 6 of his Davingraia of Oepteaber 5th, to tranaait this list to the Iraqi Government for authentication, but as the Shaikh has been given a promise to the effect that no steps will lie Bight Honourable Sir John f iaon, G.G.s.I. , K-C.V.O., etc *» etc., etc.a - will be taken to coaotuiicate particulars to the Iraqi Government without hisconsent, the only purpose which the list can serve at present is to enable His rajesty' s Qoverment in the United Kingdom to form sun opinion as to whether the Shaikh has a reasonably good title to his properties (other than to the Paddaghiyah ;state» his title to which has already been impugned). ; The lists have been examined in His Majesty's .iabassy with this object in view, 5 * i: 'ut v ery briefly the position appears to be that the Shaikh owns the following five properties, which are in his possession by virtue of the documents noted against their naaes:- 1, Mutaawaih. - Tapu Deeds. 8. Padaaghiyah - Tapu Deeds issued in 1915, the validity of which has been called in question. S. Farhaniyah - Deed of Purchase (60 years possession). - Pao - Deed of Sift (100 years possession), ^ ,c.^ 5. Ujairawiyah ' * Tapu Deeds, , t ^ i .O.exander in his note, a copy of which accoupanied Mr. Ogilvie-Porbes' despatch of the 6th aeptesiber, Ho. 530, sug gested that difficulties would arise over the boundaries of the properties and over encroachaents. The notes supplied by Colonel Dickson show that minor difficulties of this nature may easily arise and that it is impossible for any guarantee to be given that the Shaikh has a clear title to all the properties which were in his possession in Iraq, in 1914,even if it can be definite ly established what the then boundaries of those properties were, I suggest that possible disputes over boundary aligmaents and encroachments are matters of detail for which His Majesty's Oovemaent should assume no responsibility. They are matters with which the Shaikh himself must deal. They should be capable of local adjustment by the Shaikh or hie agent if and when they : f arise- 3 - arise. His Majesty's Oovemnent can hardly be expected, to guarantee that the Shaikh will not be called, upon to pay for land on which he had illegally, or without authority, encroached either before or after 1914, or to insist upon the Integrity of . boundaries which the Shaikh himself cannot or will not prove. I suggest that the important question now outstanding is whether the Shaikh has in general a sufficiently good title to the pro- p parties to protect him froa a risk of dispossession similar to that which hangs over the FadOaghiyah Sstate. 7, In ay view, the information now available shows that in addition to having had undisputed possession for long periods, he has documents which give hln reasonable protection, sufficient to safeguard his possession until the operations of land settle- aent extend to Basrah, whan his ownership, and the boundaries of his properties, can be permanently confirmed and authd^ioated. It is raost unlikely that the Iraqi Government will agree to guarantee the shaikh's title to all his properties in Iraq. They are in fact not in a position to do so until the processes of land settlement have been applied to those areas. In isy opinion, any attempt to link such a guarantee to the single and comparatively straightforward problem of compensating the plain tiffs in the Padoaghlyah case, will only result In postponing indefinitely the settlement of the latter. 10|» x ' t ia &gt; 1 suggest, of great isaportance that the Faddaghiyah problem shall be settled now. She difficulties arising out of the attempts to keep the case out of Sourt will, as has been pointed out in ir. -gilvie-.-jrbca' despatch of 87th .ctober, 1934, . o. 630, regarding the Fao land cases. Increase with time, and add to the difficulties both of the Shaikh and of His Majesty's Government. l .ven if the settlement of the Paddagbiyah case itself leaves the other properties open to successful attack, (and from the infomation now on record this seems to be unlikely), it- 4 - &gt; it will at least have removed a focal point of difficulty and eafcarrasament. The am of £2$00Q is comparatively a email, amount to pay for reuioving these difricultiea and sec tiring an impregnable title to the estate, 10. I strongly recommend that# in view of the above consider ations, I should be authorised to re-open Liegotiations iimedi- ately with the Iraqi Qoverrmient for the settlement of the problem of the date gardens of both the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Shaikh of &gt;.i^hmi-aerah on the conditions approved in your telegram Ho* 160 of 29th August, except that the Iraqi Govern ment should be asked to do no more in respect of the properties of the Shaikh of Kuamit than to validate his title to the whol# of the Fadaaghlyah Kstate (less that portion of the Bashiyah strip of it which hae already been alienated)* 11. I would re-iterate that it will not be possible indefin itely to keep the Faddaghiyah cases out of Court and that there is a grave risk that further delay in accepting the offered co operation of the Iraqi Oovernaent will result in the whole arrangement falling through. 12.

Shaikh's title to pro perty number 1 seems to be absolutely secure and to properties 3 and 4 reasonably so. Strength of title as re b ards property number 5 depends on date and nature of tapu deeds regarding which India Office are making telegraphic enquiries with Political Resident. 2. In these circumstances risk of successful attempt to dispossess Shaikh of these properties seems comparatively slight and it would be most satisfactory if you could therefore persuade Iraq Government to extend their guarantee to cover all five properties. In doing so you will no doubt, so far as you can, without disclos- ~ing particulars, make all possible play with strength of Shaikh , s titles and you will appreciate importance of point so far as His Majesty 1 ^ Government axe concerned since if titles to these gardens were to be challenged they- would be bound to support Shaikh in some way as they have had to do over Faddaghiyeh. 3 If, however, you consider it quite imprac tic ablehH z. impracticable to obtain such a general guarantee you may fall 'back on course of action suggested in para- -grapk 10» including of course, arrangement that in respect of all gardens 'Iraq Govertiment should abandon their claim to arrears of taxation and undertake im- -position of no discriminatory tax on Shaikhs in future. -s In that event you should before deal i^ completed place it on record in writing that as regards the other four gardens His Majesty f s Government for their part hold that they are covered by guarantee given to Shaikh in 1914, that obligations under this guarantee have passed to •Iraq Government and that consequently if Shaikh should be dispossessed, ^is Majesty's Government would make a claim on ^iraq Government in respect of such dispossession.

As regards boundary disputes, His Majesty^ Government would not consider guarantees as covering areas over which Shaikh had no possession at date of pledge and therefore pledge would not cover encroachment since 1914. Question of encroachments prior to 1914 is perhaps academic since by now Shaikh must have had possession for over twenty years and might have acquired prescriptive title under Iraqi law. graph 6 of your despatch subject to qualification that if Shaikh lost a boundary dispute under a judicial decision His Majesty T s Government would certainly be faced with a claim on the part of Shaikh and might have to admit claim if area in question was possessed in 1914 and certainly would have to do so if decision was xmi contrary to equity. Consequently it is important that everything possible should be done to prevent such a decision being given.

KUWAIT. The 16 th January 1935# 'Z -.or Reference your Express Letter No»35-S of 8th January 1935. t May I add the following additional oonmients on H.M's Ambassador, Baghdad's letter No.712, dated the 16th December last, to those so concisely and admirably put forward by you. U. 2. Paragraph 8 of Ambassador's despatch suggests that only after the Land Settlement Commission has reached the Shatt al Arab area and has thoroughly examined the Shaikh's properties one by one, and decided itself what can legally be called his, will it be possible for the Iraq Government to grant the Shaikh a guaranteed title* 3. This point of view to my mind is highly objection able and dangerous from the Shaikh's and His Majesty's Government's point of view, as it will further give the Iraq Government just that necessary handle, which ap parentl y tjiey axe seeking for , to break up, and so deprive the Shaikh of his Estates (especially the FAO one), both by the process of arranging for separate title deeds to be issued to the various members of the Shaikh's family and by support ing the recalcitrant 'Taaba' (stirred up \)y the Iraq Government) to becoming independent landlords• 4. The Iraq Law will assist in this, for if strictly applied, the said Law, I understand, makes it illegal for a person to 'inherit' and 'run' on behalf of or for the benefit of the rest of the family, properties which actually :he Hon'ble Lt.-Colonel T.C.Fowle, G.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIRE. f \xn u V mm- 2 - 7-/ s actually belong under Sheria Law to the decendants of the person who originally acquired the property (be he father, grandfather or other ancestor}• The Law if appealed to I Uatutye, would^insist on a proper division according to 'Sheria' principles, and would insist on the issue of fresh Tapu Sanads to all the various members of the family having rights in the said property. 5. Here incidentally also lies one of the greatest dangers in allowing the Shaikh to accept service of judicial documents on himself emanating from the Iraq Courts on behalf of his recalcitrant fellehee^as it would enable the^ll latter to either claim that (a) they are not the Shaikh's tenants at all, after the fashion of Muntafik fellaheen vis t vis their saadun landlords (see below) or (b) claim that they were the rightful tenants of another member of the Shaikh^ family, but not of the Shaikh's. In either case suggesting to the Court the desirability of issuing Tapu Sanads, in favour of themselves or some other person. 6. It may be of interest to you to learn that this very Land Settlement commission referred to, has during the last few years been operating in the Muntafik country (lower Euphrates) in much the above manner described, where 6UJC the great 'Saadun 1 * properties were concerned. There, partly no doubt for political reasons, such as to break the power of the 'Saadun' Shaikh landlords, and also possibly to win over to the Government side, the always dangerous Muntafik tribes, who form the fellah population on the 'Saadun* 1 estates, the Commission, as far as I can gather,^ systematically supported the fellahs against the landlords, with the result, I believe, that a large portion &lt;ff the latter's ancestral lands have been taken away from them under the very excuse that would probably be used in the case of the Shaikh of Kuwait, namely that the said landlords had^encroached^ on the right of others.53/11. ■x 4 Telegram R # 27 ^rom Political Resident, Bushire® To Political Agent, Kuwait, Repeated His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London# Copy by post to Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Kew Delhi.

I beg to inform you that the piece of date-palm land situate in the Ajairawiyeh (district) wa^ purchased by my late grandfather Shaikh Mubarak. It was registered in Basra Tapu Department in the name of Sharifah bint Shaikh Mubarak as-Sabah on April 7th 19 29, corresponding to the 27th Shauwal 1347. For your information. Usual Ending. POLITICAL AaENT'S NOTE, I understand from A Shaikh/ A that garden was originally bought and registered by Shaikh Mubarak in 1912 in his daughter Sharifa^ name, the papers were however lost by Sharifa f s mother Amnah in whose charge they were, sometime after Sharifa died. Fresh copies were therefore taken from Tapu Department on 7th April 1929 again in Sharifa 1 s were name and/re-registered in Basra Tapu Department.I &lt;73, SPECIAL NOTE ON THE 'SDCEMPTED* *UJAIBAWIYEH^ESTATE (1) The property was purchased by Shaikh Mubarak in 1912 and as was his custom, to avoid complications with the Turks, he registered it in Tapu nominally in the name of 'Sharifa^ his daughter, who had just married his nephew Saud al Mohamed al Subah, and gave it to her as a marriage gift. NOTE. Mubarak, it may be recalled, was not allowed to buy and register property in his own name by the Turks unless he accepted Turkish nationality. He never in consequence registered any gardens he purchased in his own name but always in the names of one of his children. (2J Sharifa died, 'childless', some 14 years ago i.e. about 1920. (Arabs are rather vague about actual dates where their women are concerned). (3) The Ujairawiyeh property was then divided as follows, -J of it went to Saud al Mohamed, husband of Sharifa, and f went back to Mubarak's other surviving children and their heirs as per margin* but on the intervention of the Shaikh of Kuwait and with the approval of the heirs, Saud was allowed to continue to enjoy the produce of the heirs' share as well as his own, on condition that he left his own half share to '^riam', 'Sharifa's' sister who it was arranged he should marry as soon as possible. (4) Shaikh Saud al Mohamed al Subah shortly afterwards married 'Mariam' as arranged, and registered the i of the property which had come to him from his first wife Sharifa, in the name of Mariam with the 'Katib al Adl* 1 Basra.

Dear Department, You will no doubt receive from the Inula Office in due course (if you have not already done so) a despatch from Bushire enclosing a letter from the Sheikh of Kuwait confirming the information given verhally to Dickson (see . 3V our despatch No.712 of December 16th) about the actual titles to his property in this country. This is fairly satisfactory as the Sheikh will not now be able to dig up any further properties to be classified as exempt. For some time we entertained doubts about the fifth property - the Ujairawiyah - but the position is now clear. What has happened is that this garden was given by the Sheikh, to whom the 1914 promise was made, , to his daughter on her marriage and is now held by her family. This family can probably be fairly considered as descendants within the meaning of the 1914 promise, but we are not prepared,'on the basis of present information, to go as far as Dickson in maintaining that the property will always be exempt no matter who holds it. For instance it would be difficult to hold that the property should retain its exempt status if it were sold to someone not in the Sheikh's family. The/ stern Department, Foreim office. COPY . (E 276/82/93) (14/1/35)- 2 - The Iraqi Government appear to have regarded this garden as being exempt and, in common with other exempted properties, have not levied taxes on it in the past. Nor has the Sdeilch included any figures relating to produce from Ujairawiyah in his statement of losses incurred dy reason of the introduction of Ishtihlak tax. This is mainly of academic interest of course and we are taking no further action till we get a reply to our despatch No.712. This, as you will realise, is a matter of some urgency if the question of Faddaghiyah is to de settled before the Ambassador departs. Yours ever, chancehy.7 FOREIGN OFPICE, 3.W. 1.

His Majesty's dovernaent would contribute a sua not exceeding £2,000 towards the expenses which might be incurred in carrying out the necessary transactions. I further explained to Your xcellency that provided full cfrect was given to the arrsngeaent set out above and on the fur- ther understanding that the Iraqi Govemraent woulds- (a) mdertalco to aalce no daim for arrears of taxation against the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Muharamarah in respect of their properties in Iraq.} (b) give ae a written assurance that no discriminatory taxation *ould be iniwsed on the properties of either of these Shaikhs in future.

You will see that while the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs h s been told orally that we regard the obligations arising from the 1914 promise ae devolving upon the Iraqi Government, we know perfectly well that they will never admit it. How the point is this. Wo ar reasonably sure that once the Faddaghiyah case is out of the way and we hove a valid sanad covering that property, the titles* of the Shaikh to al: his properties will be fairly sound. (Let ue leave aside the question of poiaible encroachaients before or after 1914. They do not raeily affect the aain question). Handicapped as we are by not being able to disci se details of the Shaikh's holdings we can etill (as you tell us L ^3 to do in your telegram No. 15) aake fairly good play with the strength of his titles. Do you think that, as a matter of tactics, any purpose whatever ill be served by our telling the Iraqis eg in in writing, when the appropriate moaient arrives, that we regard the* as bound by the 1914 promise? Will it not be sufficient to say something on the following lines? '♦we protect the Shaikh's interests in Iraq.

This was however followed by a family arrangement whereby the husband married Sharifa T s sister Mariam:- and was allowed to enjoy the whole of the income of the property. And since his death the income of the whole continues to be enjoyed by Mariam and the issue of the marriage. In these circumstances no question arises as to (b) above, so far as the pledge is concerned. As regards (a) the position still seems to be that since the property vested in the husband under Islamic law, the chain was broken, and that his widow and children enjoy it at present not as descendants of Mubarak but as transferees or successors of the husband. It comes very near to the situation suggested in para.3(2) of my previous note, and it might well be considered reasonable, so long as the present circumstances continue, to maintain the pledge in their favour.

In that case there will be no real delay.

On receipt of this report I will consider what action, if any, I can usefully take. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. I have the honour to 'be Sir Your obedient Servant (Copy sent to Govt.of India and Kuwait under P.L.No.341-8 of 29/4/36). The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf B U S H I R E.f\1 /w (14/84/35) British Embassy, Bagdad# 4th April, 1935. Sir, With reference to my despatch of March 21st last (No. 14/21/35) concerning the alleged intention of the Iraqi Government to ex-propriate a portion of the property of the Shaikh of Kuwait at Fao, I have now received the observations of the Port Director at Basra on this matter, The position will he clear to you from the attached blue print, and may be summarised briefly as follows, A small strip of date planatation belonging to the Shaikh adjoins the Pao Depot. The boundary of this strip is shown in red, A ring fence surrounds the depot and a bund connects it with the Basra-Pao road. The Shaikh's property will be seen to be on both sides of this bund, 4, For some time past. Colonel Ward, impressed by the danger of epidemics arising from the presence of waste undrained land on both sides of the Basra-Pao road, has been anxious to raise the general level of this land and to improve the living conditions of his native labourers who occupy the site. It would obviously have suited his purposes better if the Shaikh's property (which is wet) could have been drained and its level raised. But, knowing the inconvenience that would be caused by any proposals touching the Shaikh's property. Colonel Ward made The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIRE,2 - made specific enquiries with a view to ascertain its exact boundaries. These enquiries indicated that the small strip adjoining the Basra-Pao road, on which alone Colonel Ward proposes to work and for which he is prepared to pay, is waste G-overnment ground# Xt seems to me therefore that unless the Shaikh can produce some proof, other than a mere declaration by his agent, that the strip is, in fact, his property, he has no locus standi for protesting against the proposed improvements. 5. So far as I am aware, there has been no effort on the part of the Iraqi G-overnment to lay hands on the pro perty under the terms of the Land Acquisition Act, In fact, Colonel iSfard appears to have gone out of j^is way to protect the Shaikh f s interests at some inconvenience to himself and the Port employees. 6 * I ^ sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

EXPRESS LETTER »•. recetpt, with the same expedition ' 7^t%f r *' ' 1 F rom Political, Kuwait. To Britconsul, Bushire, n No. C-118. Dated 26 th April 7555, 'Visit of His Exoelisney Syed Hani id Beg al Naqib'. I beg tcjreport that His Excellency Syed Hamid Beg al Naqib, Deputy tor Basra in the IRAQ Parliament (a person of distinguished ^ - family in Basra,and brother of the late Syed Talib Pasha) visited Kuwrait on the 22nd April, and left again on 25th April. 2* He came straight from Baghdad and called on me on arrival, with Syed Abdur Rahman al Maqib, his cousin and one Yusuf al Salim a well known resident of Basra. 3. Though Syed Hamid Beg's visit was, he assured me, quite of an informal nature, (He had only come down, he said, to see his sister who is married to the Shaikh's son) he early on started discussing the Shaikhs Date Gardens question / and the IRAQ, Governments smuggling accusations against Kuwait. 4. As Syed Hamid is a very influential deputy in the IRAQ Parliament, and as his opinions count for something in Baghdad, I think it worth while reporting the gist of what he said, as it shows that there is a good deal of infoimative and influential opinionopinion in IRAQ, whioli seos 'fclie Shaiich. ot Kuwait's point oT view and is out for just and conciliatory methods. 5, As regards the date gardens . Syed Hamid's views were as follows (a) He deplored the way in which the IRAq Government had deliberately gone out to persecute the Shaikh during the last four years, and considered such methods the worst form of diplomatic tactics that his country could have undertaken - Kuwait, he said, was IRA^s near and good neighbour and was ruled by a high spirited and proud Arab of ancient lineage, and his country IRAQ ought to have known better than tf to drive a spear into Shaikh Ahmad's heart tf (his words), and so deeply wound him as to make it almost impossible to recover lost ground or ever discuss any minor disputes which arose, in friendly manner again, (b) IRAQ'S whole quarrel was really with His Majesty's Government and not with Kuwait, and she ought, instead of attempting to take the law into her own hands, and force eH date garden revenue out of the Shaikh, to have held her hand where Kuwait was concerned and carried the warfare to London. Kuwait's goodwill and friendship She should have cultivated from the first. Her obvious line was to have given an ultimatum to His Majesty's Government 4 years ago and warn her that if within say a definite period of time, she (His Majesty's Govemmait) did not pay Kuwait's garden taxes herself and incidentally honour her pledges to Kuwait by so doing. She (IRAQ) would most reluctantly have to take steps to recover same direct. This course,said Syed Hamid Beg, would at any rate not have made an w enemy tf of the Shaikh of Kuwait. (o)3 (c) Clearly, continued Syed Hamld Beg, the Shaikh had been deeply wounded by IRAq'3 stupid aadtlBH ana bullying action, and the smuggling question had been rendered ten times more difficult of settlement in consequence, for to use a strong expression 'the Shaildi was justifiably trying to get his own back'. (d) While therefore he (Hamid Beg) blamed his own country for extremely bad tactics, His Majesty^ Govern- really ment/were the chief culprits, for when they went out to get the IRAQ, treaty through, her representative, Sir i Henry Dobbs, deliberately omitted to make mention of His Majesty's Government's pleadge to Kuwait, as he knew he would not have got the treaty througih had he not done so - In actual fact Sir Henry Dol^bs did not forget the matter at all, and did try to include the Kuwait date gardens, (it was not a case of forgetfulness as was later said of Sir Henry Dobbs) but IRAQ forced him to exclude the clause - He (Hamid Beg) was present at the discussions of the IRAQ Cabinet at the time, so could speak with authority# (e) He hoped and believed that his Government had now seen the error of these ways, and he felt confident that under Yasin Pasha's wise guidance, IRAQ 's attitude in respect of the Shaikh and his gardens would show a decided change for the better from now onwards* 6. As regards 'Smuggling' Syed Hamid Beg's views were as follows (a) By dragging in His Majesty's Government, and by exaggerating difficulties by publicity, and by strong propaganda in the press, IRAQ had again shown unutterably stupid tactics - They had preferred 'HUH' methods to quiet and unofficial friendly discussions - For this he blamed certain Customs officials, who gave wrong advice to his Govemment, and who hoped to get His Majesty's4 Majesty*s Government, by clever manipulation of facts, to take up the cudgels on behalf of IRAQ and force Kuwait to toe the line, irrespective of the rights of small communities and elementary justice . (b) Clearly and obviously the whole onus of stopping the smuggling lay with IRAQ, and the only way to do this was for IRAQ, to place two or three strong Customs cum police posts on the frontier and patrol between them with light armed cars: If this were done he (Hamid Beg) believed th^e matters would be settled within a fortnight: Add to the above 'goodwill* 1 on the part of the Shaikh, born of better treatment where his date gardens etc # were concerned, and everything would be arranged satisfactorily. The one important and out standing point, however, was that IRAQ, must go ahead in the first place and act on her own without trying in any way to drag in the Shaikh by raising any so called follow question of 'co-operation' - This latter would of itself, if IRAQ acted by strictly legal methods, and won the Shaik , s goodwill, by treating him properly in other directions* (c) All talk of placing an Snglishman in charge of the Kuwait Customs etc. etc, was so much foolish^ id^a, would only acerbate the situation; The man would have to be the servant of the Shaikh, and must in the end act under his orders, for the Shaikh was after all an inde pendent ruler and could not abdicate his rights. The one and only solution was for IRAQ to herself guard her frontiers, and in other directions go 'all out' for improving good relations• (d) He finally hinted that with the departure of certaincertain British officials from IRAQ, a new era of under standing and friendliness would arise between the two neighbouring States. ?• I was naturally not a little pleased to hear Syed Hamid Beg express hiiaself in such straightforward and candid manner, especially as his views reflected my own almost exactly - I expressed my gratitude for all he had said, and assured him that speaking for the Shaikh as well as myself, I felt certain that if only IRAQ were to adopt the policy he had outlined, all would be well, for I knew that both the Shaikh and his people desired nothing better than to live on the friendliest and most neighbourly terms with IBAQ, which after all was looked upon as big brother, A 8* Before he went, Syed Hamid Beg, pointed out that he fully realised (though certain persons in Baghdad did not) that Shaikh Ahmad, though an autocrat, lived and existed by the goodwill of his subjects - That with all the goodwill in the world, and even if he were stupid and weak enough^n his desire to placate, to agree to IRAQIS demands, such as x an outside Customs officer, or a quota for imports, he «ould not with safety to himself do so - He would have to face the undoubted prospect of revolution, abdication or even worse- This everyone who knew anything about the case appreciated to the full* Lieut-Colonel Political Agent, Kuwait#5'^ 1 GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

'Rftffhdad. to H.M f s Ambassador, Baghdad. I have the honour to report that as I considered it a matter of urgency that His Excellency the Shaikh should be put in possession of the observations of Hie Basra Port Director, as quoted in H.M's Ambassador^ despatch (a) above, and as it was only fair to both the Shaikh and his attorney Mr. Gabriel, that tbey should be made acquainted with how things were developing (See my Confidential Letter No. G-69 of 10th March and enclosures) I took up on myself the responsibility of sending the Shaikh copies in summary of H.M.Ambassador• s letter (a) referred2 \ &amp; referred to above as well as your letter (b) by way of I y answering his urgent letter R-4/1957 dated 7tli March 1935 # 2. The Shaikh in reply seat me his letter No.R-4/a)21 f dated End May, translation of which I am enclosing with this. 3. He followed up his letter by calling on me personally half an hour later. He was agitated and in excitable state of mind. From 'Sie general trend of the conversation that followed I could see that he had un fortunately got into his head that both you and H.M's Ambassador were adapting a rather one sided view of the trouble, 4. The Shaikh contended that Colonel Waid of the Port Directorate had no right by law, custom, or equity, his to seize a piece of/land on the mere assumption that he (the Shaikh) had no right to it. ,, Who M , queried the Shaikh, 'made Colonel Ward the judge as to what was his property and what was not?' Surely, the methods of Colonel Ward savoured of the war period, when the military took over what land tbey mnted irrespective of the rights of owners• 5. What were the facts? Continued the Shaikh - Thw Port Director wanted to build houses for his labourers near Fao villag3, where he had dredging and other interest- He had fixed on a piece of ,t waste ,, land, as he called it, lying immediately behind his (the Shaikhs) Date gardens, had and/decided that it was the right and convenient piece of land for his purpose. He was told by his agent, as well as by certain local inhabitants that the ground belonged to himself, the Shaikh of Kuwait, so to save his comcience he had made ,, specific w enquiries, with a view to ascertain exact boundaries of the Shaikh 1 s properties. As a result he was conveniently told by some person or persons unknown( ^v unknown that the portion he wanted belonged to the IRAQ, Grovemraent. No doubt Colonel Ward would have no objection to divulging the naime of the person from whom these 'speci fic enquiries' were made. 6. The Shaikh next asked me, how it was that Colonel Ward had not taken the straightforward course of addressing him direct, if he had had any doubts at all as to who was the owner of the property. He did not do this and the workmen rudely entered his grounds and affixed pegs showing the areas to be built on - Surely it would have been an act of simple courtesy to have seen him about the matter first. 7. The Shaikh concluded by saying that he did not think that any law in the world permitted a man to enter another persons house, seize his property, and then ask him to prove his title, before he agreed to depart. That in effect what Colonel Ward proposed to do. 8. The above, as well as other lines of argummt were put to me by the Shaikh, and pressed htoe with characteristic vigour, and I confess I had some difficulty in calming him and explaining that all was not lost. 9. In fairness to Colonel Ward the Shaikh did certainly add that he had met him a short time ago in Kuwait, and had found him a particularly^ charming person, and that for this very reason he was loath to think too hardly of him and preferred to believe that he (Colonel Ward) was the innocent pawn, in yet another subtle attack on the part of the IRAQ Grovommmt - He even hinted that he thought he knew who the person was who had given Colonel Ward advice. 10. Actually I myself think that the seriousness of the issue from the Shaikh's point of view, has peihaps not beennot been quite fully realized, and with deep respect, I venture to make the following observations for what they are worth:- (a) We know that the Shaikh possesses no Tapu documents for his 7 miles long Fao estate, but we do know that he has a ^Wahbiyeht document, and that the 'Saniya' department of the late Turkish Govern ment, decided that the ruling family of the A1 Sabah held these Fao lands by right of tenure (see previous correspondence). (b) We have from time to time also heard it put forward by the IRAQ Govemmmt that me Shaikh has encroached on and taken over certain ♦♦Slate' or 'Miri' lands adjoining his property # No attempts have however been made to point out actual encroachments or to prove that they were made after 1914 when His Majesty's Government guaranteed the Shaikh possession of what he held. (c) I myself have gone out of my way to point out in certain despatchei, notably that describing the various Faddaghiyeh holdings, that certain 'Shuwatis' and strips of silt land in process of being recovered from the river, had not yet been paid for by the Shaikh, as the Law required, but I have certainly not been able to find out any other portions that were not absolutely the Shaikh's by right of unchallenged possession since 1914. If any encroachments were ever made, they were made in the dim past and in the days of the Turks, certainly not after 1914. (d) For the benefit of those who do not know the actual lay out of the ground, and the areas embraced by the various 'Hauzes' or garden strips, which extend in every case from the river bank to the protective bund5 ^ bund on the land side of the gardens from Basra to the sea at i'ao, there is a waste swamp area, liable to be flooded at high tide from the direction of the Khor Abdulla - which floods are especially dangerous to the date gardens when a strong wind blows up from the Persian Gulf and piles up the water. During the Turkish times, when Government was hopeless and control nil, everything was left to the individual, and garden owners all along the yscax river each year spent much time money and energy building protective bunds in the rear of their garden s, in the endeavour to keep out the flood sea water from entering and ruining their properties - The fight was continuous and long — The rich saved their gardens, the poorer ones lost theirs. (e) Than came the British Administration, during and after the war - The necessity *as immediately seen for a substantial and continuous government bund along the back of the date gardens; Government took the work in hand, and the new bund or protective dyke followed in continuous line as nearly as possible along the site of their amateur bunds set up and maintained by each garden owner. (f) Now for the important point, the new Govern ment bund was such a good and stout affair (especially on the lower reaches of the Shatt al Arab), that its top became the recognised roadway from Abftl Khasib down to Fao, during the rainy and flood seasons - This bund roadway for all practicable purposes forms the desert or land route today to all properties lying near the mouth of the river. The Shaikh only claims as his property, the land lying between the river and this bund/ this bund, The ,f waste n strip wanted by Colonel Ward lies east of or within the bund in question. (g) The next, and most important point of all to my mind is that, if the Port Directorate get the land V- they want, and t^y the methods they are using, a dangerous precedent will be set up, and it will be next to impossible to prevent other claimants notably the IRAQ Government (if they wish to continue the campaign of pressure on the Shaikh of Kuwait) from taking any slices of land they want, at the expense of the Shaikh. (h) It will be recollected, no doubt, that the main^ reason why the Shaikhs lawyer fought recently to prevent the Shaikh from being put into Court in Basra by his tenants (oath case) was because he, the lawyer knew that these self fame 'fellaheen 1 had prepared their plan and were going to ask the Shaikh in Court to prove his title to the Fao property. Under the strict interpretation of the land law, if the Shaikh could not have produced Tapu papers, the case would have gone against him. The above I reported at length in despatches at the time 0 11. It is clear to me at this end and I think His Majesty f s G-overnment realize this, that one must support the Shaikh always if any person or persons challenge his title to any of his exempt properties or portions thereof, and we must take our stand if such challenge arises (and this particularly is the case ftf a question of the desert boundary crops up) on the following formula, 'Did the present boundary exist, and was it recognized as 'good' by the local fellaheen and 'TAABS', in Shaikh Mubarak's time, when the 'expemtion' promise was given him by His Majesty 1 sMajesty^ Government or not? If it did aM the boundary had not been altered, in any way, then that ronained the bouncfery of the estate, as guaranteed by His Majesty's GoTemment. If it did not, then official investigation on the spot(with a British officer to represent the Shaikh) should be made immediately and decision arrived at w # IE # In the particular difficulty, which we are now H- dealing with, I feel, I may say so, that Colonel Ward would L*. have done better to have written and told the Shaikh frankly what he intended doing - I camot but feel that if this had happened, the Shaikh would have been reasonable / fj^d have reacted well, and would have granted all his requests. What has so upset the Shaikh (o^e to understand his feelings properly, one must put oneself in his place and be aware of the past history of the gardens), is the fact that he feels that he has been short circuited, and that a great discourtesy has been done him. Even now I feel that if Colonel Ward were to pay Shaikh a visit, and put forward his case, all would be well - I suggest this seriously as a solution of the difficulty, and I hope it will be given a try - The other way will lead to further difficulties.

In very truth I am surprised at the explanations made by His Excellency the Ambassador, to the Hon'ble the Political Resident, stating that the abovementioned land was not a part of my Fao property, but was waste land, and I cannot see how the Hobble the Political Resident came to agree to that. I am confident that their Excellencies both know all about my Fao property, including the area and boundaries (of the gardens) which come under my ownership. There is no doubt whatsoever that the piece of land refer red to above is situated within the area (limits) of my property. Therefore, I beg to repeat my request to you to kindly explain to the Hobble the Political Resident very clearly about the abovementioned land.

We are most grateful for th£ tion, contained in your letter of the 30th tTanuary, of the My dear Batemn, position regarding the Power of Attorney of the agent of the sheikh of Kowelt* 2« It Is clear that we must, for the moment, laave this mtter for looal treatment, and w© moh hop© that you will be able to dispose of it In soiao satisfactory way. You will of course remember that the present postponement of the Fao oases expires on tha 2Sth February and before ito expiry you will no doubt take steps# if necesaaryt to secure a further postponement# 5# We do not for the moment wish to express any definite view on your suggestion (aee last sentence of paragraph 6 of your letter) that it may be better, after the Fadda^iiyah ease has been settled, to revert to the pre~Fadda$hiyah procedure. Indeed we could only do so after consultation with toe India Office, Provided however that the Iraqi Government and the Iraqi courts admit (1) the ordinary principles of international law as regards the imimmity of foreign sovereigns from the Jurisdiction, and {2) that the Sheikh of Koweit is a foreign sovereign, we are provisionally inclined to think/ Bateman, Ssc]*, M»C,think that in future laoth w© and the Shaikh might do well to admit that there is m exception to this mle as 4 regards actions involving a title to land in Irat, and that, in future proceedings which fall strictly within this category, the Sheikh should not endeavour to put up a probably useless plea of immunity from the Jurisdiction. The exception would, not however cover claims by hia tenants or employees working on his garden® for their wages or anything of that kind# If these people should hsve grievances they would have to take them up through the diplomatic channel and not through the courts. 4« Even BOf we feel that we must go on hammering at the point that it is entirely wrong for the Iragi Government or the Iraqi courts to take the line that f because the Shaikh has not submitted to the jurisdiction in a case which comes within the exception, they will obstruct him in some action which he brings as plaintiff. It is entirely improper for the Iraqis to connect the two things in this way. The Iraqi courts are perfectly well able to proceed with actions involving the title to land, i.e. those coming within the exception, even if the Sheikh were wrongly to plead immunity and refuse to accept the documents served on him, by adopting suitable rules such as the courts of nearly all countries have for 'substituted service' where it is impossible to serve a defendant in the ordinary way. This is the manner in which they ought to deal with this point instead of interfering with other quite distinct actions. Yours sincerely, (Sd) A. K. Helm.S bjtt nnnfidential .

The 19 Oath Goimiissions emanating from the Peace Court Abul Khasib, which I duly administered on the Shaikh here, were duly returned to the said Court through the British Embassy Baghdad, 'then the defence lawyer in a last desparate attempt to upset things, pleaded that although I (the Political Agent Kuwait) administered the necessary oath to the Shaikh in his presence, nevertheless the act was illegally done, as tha defendants Kj\- 2 - defendents had no one present to watch their interests. Further that they had expected that such person would have been one of my clerks. 4. Mr, Gabriel contends that in law the defendents' counsel is quite right, but that the whole fault for not mentioning that one of the Agency clerks should be present at the taking of oath by the Shaikh, lay with the Abul KhasiVs Court, which kept silent on the subject, 6.

Today I appeared in the Court of Abul Khasib to attend on the cases raised against the 'taabeen* (tenents with permanent holdings) of Fao. The situation of these was as follows: 22 cases were nearing conclusion, oaths on account of which having been taken by Your Excellency; and 21 cases were ready for Your Excellency to take oath, protests having been made against their Judge ments passed in default. The opponents' lawyer protested against Your Excellency's oath not having been made in tie presence of the opponents, or their representative. This indeed is entirely the fault of the court, for not mentioning the matter when papers were sent to Kuwait, seeing that tha opponents had already nominated a clerk of the Consulate at Kuwait as their representative, to be present at the time of swearing Your Excellency. The court have therefore decided once aged.n to get Your Excellency sworn, aid the oath should this time be made in the presence of the Consulate's clerk, in his capacity as the opponents' representative. The court have also decided on Your Excellency's taking oath in respect of the other cross oases. Therefore, the Consulate (Political Agent) will shortly receive through the Ministry and Emfcassy, 43 oath commissions. It is hoped they will be returned to the court in the earliest convenient time, so as to reach the court before the day appointed for pleading. Usual ending„N ote.

Ward, C.M.G., C.I.E., D.S.O., Port Director and Director General of Navigation, Basrah. Sometime ago there i/sias a good deal of correspondence between the Shaildi, myself, Bushire and Ba^idad about a small piece of waste land lying behind Fao village, which belongs to the Shaikh and which it seems you want to acquire as a site for bungalows for some of the Port Directorate staff, S. The Shaikh at the time took special alarm at your statement that you had been told that the land was not his, but belonged to Government; and at your practically inviting him to prove his title. 3. This of course would have been an undesirable line of action for him to have taken, especially at a time when His Majesty's Government were themselves engaged in trying to get the IRAQ Govemmaat to admit the Shaikh's full title to his five exempt Date Gardens guaranteed to him by promise of H .M. Government in 1914 (Fao being one of these), 4. The line which I took therefore with the Political Resident and the Ambassador was that the Shaikh had been very hurt at the thought that you had not approached him direct about the land in the first place, (which was indeed true), and that it ms my firm belief that if you could now see your way to run down and see him (the Shaikh) personally or write him a nice letter explaining the position, he would be genuinely grateful and would be very ready to let you have the plot of ground you required and on the easiest of terms. 5. Fowle who passed through here recently from Baghdad, moationed- 2 - i mentioned that you would probably get the tip from the Ambassador to act on my suggestion and he told me if I did not hear from you soon, I could write and ask what your plans were. 6.

No. 248 dated 15tli June 1935 from Colonel J.G.Ward, Basrah to Lieut.Colonel H.R.P. Dickson, Kuwait. Thank you for your Confidential letter of the 6th June 1935. I think there must be some misunderstanding. It is true that I applied for land but before doing so ascertained from my people at Fao that it was, as far as they could gather from the local residents, well clear of any land owned by the Shaikh. Having applied, it is very difficult for me to withdraw and say I do not want the land when actually I do. It might be possible for me to move in the direction of the salt pans. As a matter of fact, now that the Iraq Government have appointed a Mudir and made Fao into a Nahia, I cannot make any move outside my own particular working area, and having applied officially to the Iraq Government for a piece of what I understood was their land it is rather difficult for mfc to write to or see the Shaikh about land, I must of necessity apply through Government. In any case I cannot deal direct being an Iraqi Government official. However if I had some idea where the Shaikh's land is I could, perhaps, put forward now without delay a good reason for shifting the site of my proposed labour camp somewhere else. I fear I cannot come to Kuwait just now, I am far too busy and I much regret that His Excellency thinks that I have shortcircuited him for liiat is the very last thing that I would think of doing. I applied for what I was- 2 - I was given to understand Shat it was Government land in perfect good faith and if I had had any idea that it was likely to create trouble for the Shaikh I wauld not have applied for land as I did. It was only because I felt quite sure it was all clear that I moved and mil now do all I can to i^ove out of it. I feel however that I cannot now approach the Shaikh for land, having applied to the Government, I can only flo my best to shift to another site if that is possible. I hope you understand.

Had there been any doubt about it, I should have deferred action. It was only after I had been informed by ray Officers who had taken the trouble to find out on the spot which was and which was not Gtovemment land, that I applied for the land. However, having done so, it is very difficult for me to withdraw. I can meanwhile do as Dickson suggests, find out from the local 'fallaheen and Taabs' whether the present boundary did exist and was recognised as 'good' in Shaikh Mubarak's time. I have not, by the way, i^ade any further move re this land since I realized that there was some doubt in regard to its ownership. At the moment I cannot very well go to Kuwait, My hand are completely full, in fact I have more than enough with the floods, which have given me a terrific setback both on the Mohamnierah and outer Bars - the arrival of the new dredger together with the extra load which these tribal troubles have thrown upon me - is all I want just now. xxxxxxxxxxx I have not paid any money for the land and the question of my taking up that land can wait until my return from leave if that is possible - everyone in my show have all the work that they can do without dealing with the Fao land question.By Air MaiL p. z. ^7 /19 j.r H'T- INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, Hi B* No i i^s Ur .iy&gt; Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.

I raised this question with Huri Pasha this evening# I explained that it was causing a most unnecessary amount of trouble and difTiculty to everyone concerned, and that we were really becoming rather worried about it. It was no good going back over the early history of the matter or the question of why the pledges had been given* The fact remained that there was a pledge, which we had to see implemented # that the late King Feisal had promised that the Sheikh's title should be validated, and that Nuri himself had renewed this promise, when it had been agreed that the matter could be settled if His Majesty's Government would pay £2,000 # Could not Nuri Pasha do something to ensure that this tiresome question should now be got finally out of the way on the basis which had been agreed upon? 2* Kuri Pasha did not attempt to deny that these promises had been given, and said that just before he leftBagdad the natter had been discussed by the Council of Ministers. The difficulty then had bean - according to him - to make the proposed validation square with the ternas of existing legislation, and it had been necessary to consult Mr. Drower on this point. Further it had been suggested that an undertaking should be given that the Sheikh's title would not be contested in future; this was impracticable, since no-one could prevent people challenging a title, however legal it might be. S* I replied that it seemed to me that two things were required. In the first place, the present action must be disposed of and got out of the way. Secondly, some act was required on the part of the Iraqi Government, either by legislation or by any other kind of administrative action which would put the Sheikh's title on an unassailable basis, i.e. finally/ ■Mjrt 1finally dispose of any technical irregularities there might be in it at present. If this were done, it would lie very difficult for anyone to challenge it, and it would not matter very much if they did* 4. After a long discussion, I again begged Huri Pasha to write to Bag ad and urge an immediate settlement of this question. I said that I thought it was having a most unfortunate effect, and that it would help our relations in every way if it could he disposed of. Kuri r^asha eventually agreed to write to Bagdad about it at once. (Signed) G.W.Rendel. fOPyim OF^TCK. 11th June, 1935.By Air Mail. P.Z 19 4^2-5'^ J INDIA OFFICE. E RESIDENCY. WTf. a-yzr coaFsaa,:;.

' .i^m a/ IfL (55/41/35) My dear Fowle, BUSH1RE RESID ENCY . ^77 C0^FlDEI&gt;i i i&gt;iL R^i/Dribd BRITISH EMBASSY, BAGDAD. 29tli June, 1935. f r I was distressed to see from your express letter of June 19th (No. 421-S) that the oath question is likely to 'begin de novo . At the present rate, it threatens to 'become a hardy annual. I must confess that I do not quite follow your argu ment that the objection made 'by the defence was frivolous or Dickson's argument that the Abul Khasib Court was at fault, We have known all along that the defence would seize on legal technicalities and even Gahriel admits that they have the law on their side. Surely then the fault lies mostly with him ? Dickson could not he expected to know the law and it was clearly the duty of some one like Gabriel to have put him wise. In any case he would, I think, have been well advised to have consulted Gabriel who, after all, is the lawyer of the Shaikh whom we are protecting. However, the upshot is the Shaikh was improperly sworn. There can, I am afraid, be no doubt about that. And now we are back where we started and all our wire pulling of DN'BLE LIEUTENANT-COLONEL T.C.W. FOWLE, C.B.E./f 7 2 of last autumn and spring will have to begin again under auspices which are not so happy as they might have been. You will, I know, realise that somebody ! 8 mistake has tied our hands pretty tightly. Naturally we are a bit upset and are inclined to think that Gabriel is far from being the angel his name would imply.^1' 142 Confidential ^ D»0»No»629*&gt;S of 1936• The Heeiciency, Bushire, the 18th July 1936# J/ould you please refer to your letter (No.66 /41/ 36) of 29th June 1936 on the subject of the Shaikh of Kuwait's oath. I^y reasons for thinking that the objection made by the defence was friv olous were that as far as I know under English law in no circumstances is the presence of the opposite party necessary when the other party merely takes an oath. If, for instance, there is a case in Calcutta in connection with which an oath has been administered in London before a competent authority, i.e. a Commissioner for Oaths, the opposite party cannot otgect to the oath as such because they were not represented w^en the oath was being taken# I imagine that this rule holds good under the legal procedure of any ordinary country. However, the legal procedure of Iraq appears to be far from ordinary. 2. Perhaps it could be ascertained whether the objection of the defence can actually be upheld even by the Iraqi law ? I quite agree that the matter is un fortunate and it seems to me that it was up to Gabriel to have advised Dickson and the Shaikh. I also quite agree in your opinion of Gabriel and will go as far as to say that, in my opinion, he is an out-and-out scoumrel. But, from what I hear, His Iraqi colleagues are very little better and so the unfortunate Shaikh has not much choice. &amp;ccellency, Archibald Clark Kerr, K.C.M.G., His Itojesty's Ambassador, Bagda^P.Z. u-isoq 19 r i iii INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, shl VS .

He explained that the Iraq Government had imposed a tax on the produce of the land exported from Iraq, but that this tax was not being paid by the exporters themselves but had had to be defrayed for the last few years out of his own pocket. His Excellency had given details of his expenses to Colonel Dickson, but nothing had yet been done by H.M.G. MR. LAITHWAITB said that H.M.G. had fought hard to reach a settlement with the Iraq Government both on the question of the Sheikh's title to his lands and on the question of taxation and would continue to do so. Mr.Rended added that he had talked to Euri Pasha on the important question of title a few days ago and had impressed upon him the importance of settling this matter quickly. Huri Pasha had premised to attend to it on his return to Bagdad. /, n fix. 7. j/ - Sheikh of Koweit's e Gardens in Iraq.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001d1_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/492</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001d1</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/492</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 53/11 X (D 117) Shaikh of Kuwait's Date Gardens in Iraq'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1934/1935</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-08-28T10:02:46</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (220 folios)</extent><extent>File is arranged in chronological order, from earliest at beginning of the file to most recent at end.Serial numbers refer to entries in the notes at the rear of the file: red for incoming, blue for outgoing correspondence.</extent><extent>Condition: A bound correspondence volume.Foliation: The file's foliation sequence commences at the title page and terminates at the fifth folio from the back of the volume; these numbers are written in pencil, and can be found in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
