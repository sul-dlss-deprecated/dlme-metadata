Introduction. This report should be read In conjunction with the Trade Report for the year ending the 31st Varch, 1939. 2# Trade. The total value of trade f excluding oils, for the year unaer review amounted to ta.3 f 61i3!yi #0 (Imports fe.^21 f 59 f 030f Exports fti *l 9 a9 9 7S f 130) as compared with to&gt;4 f 81 9 70 v £20 (3Qnport« hi»ll f 73 f 2?ri f 230i Exports ii«ri f 0t f 43 t 990) in the prevl us year, shoeing a decrease of ^•I t a0 f 34 f y60.

The value of transhipment cargoes was conslderabl less than that of last year, owing 9 firstly; to the completion of constructional work at und secondly! to the development of the port of Has tenure.

Bahrain is famous throughout the world for its pearl industry on which gntsit numbers of people/-8- people still depend for their livelihood. Unfortunately this industry haa been in decline in recent yenra• The poaaibility of initiating a nother-of-penrl inriuetry should be explored* ' Inen* The Bahrain letroleua Co., ltd., now owms a fully develop eJ oil field. f very modem refinery, capable of dealing: «ith over 26,000 barrels of oil dally has been Miorkin^ steadily to full crpacity. 16 • Conwunlcntlona and t.-anaoc-n.. Motor rood, suitable for cars and lorries exist over most of the two laain islands. There are 281 motor cars, 115 buses, 90 lorries of various types and 36 ^otor cycles, which i re almost excly sively of American Manufacture. Motor boats ply regularly between Bahrein, atlf and U^qair and occasionally to other ports on the nainland. The fares are cheap* There is a regular weekly steamer service ^Britlah India staam Ifavl^atlcn Company) from and to India and 2mq. This Comijany's ftest mail also calls at B-ihraln weekly. in addition the J trick, Silver t/ava Pacific and Mitsui lines maintain regular services frore British, Aiaerican and Ja T aneso ports* The British Overseas Airways halt at Bahrain on their east and west bound flights* IV.

Report on the Economic and Trade Conditions irT the Bahrain Islends for the year 1940-41 Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith three copies of e Reoort on the Economic and Trade Conditions in the Bahrain islands for the year ended the olst March 1941• I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, 5^, R &amp;- Political Agent, Bahrain.fiepgft on LgQftQalc the Bahrain Islands fgf Xhs Ygaf 1^4Q - 41 PARI I (a) GENERAL Di ^ CRIPTIQM The Bahrain Islands form an archipelago in the Persian Gulf 20 miles North of Al Hasa on the Arabian coast. Bahrain, the largest island, is 27 miles long and 10 miles wide. Other islands are Muharraq, to the North-East of Bahrain, 4 miles long and 1 mile wide; Sitra, to the East, 3 miles long and 1 mile wide; Nabi Saleh, about 2 miles in circumference and several uninhabited islets. The islands are low lying, the highest ground being a hill in the centre of Bahrain 400 feet above sea level. Manama, the capital and commercial centre, extends for 1^ miles iong the shore. A causeway 1^ miles long carrying a motor road has been constructed across the shal.ow strait separating Manama from Muharraq, and awaits only the completion of a swing bridge over the deep channel which is nov in course of construction. The gap is crossed by ferry boats at present. According to the census taken by the State in January 1941, the total population recorded was 89,970. 46,354 of these are the original inhabitants of the islands and belong to the Shia 1 Sect, the remainder (with the exception of 1672 non Ifeislims who are mainly foreigners) are Sunnis. The Sunnis who include the Ruling Family live mainly in the towns of Manama and Muharraq. There is a wealthy Iranian community in Manama and a number of Indian merchants. The principal coins in use are Indian rupees, but Austrian (Maria Theresa) dollars (worth 1 sh. 11 d), Turkish liras (worth about 18 sh.) and Saudi Arabian riyals (worth about /-about Re. 1/-) are also current. The weights are i roba (4 lbs)j man (56 lbs); and ruffa (560 lbs) dhra The measure employed is the &lt;JMa5W«L (= 19 inches) A considerable proportion of the total State income is derived from Oil Royalties and most of the balance comes from Customs duties. Manama, the capital town, contains three schools and a technical school, a Post Office maintained by the Indian postal Department and a Cable and Wireless Station. (b) Custo m Ad rr unistration and Harbour Facilities The administration of the Customs Department is in the hands of a British Director of Customs, an official of the Bahrain State. The Customs House and the Pier are situated in the centre of the water front of Manama close to the main bazaar. The pier, which has been improved and extended at various times during the last 20 years, is over 2000 feet long and extends into water which has a sufficient depth to enable large dhows and launches to come alongside at all states of the tide. The pier is lit by electricity and served by a light trolley line running from the head of the pier to the import yard shed on the edge of the bazaar. There is one 5 ton crane installed on the pier. ^Zargo is stored in two large sheds, one on the pier, the other on the edge of the bazaar. Steamers anchor between three and four miles from the shore and are lightered by sailing dhows and motor launches which meet every boat. Cargo is discharged by a landing company which is a subsidiary to Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Company Limited, Bahrain, who are the local agents for the British India Steam Navigation Co^any Limited The /-- 3 - 1 //: The Customs tariff is fixed at 5 ^ ad valorem on general merchandise and 10 % on certain luxury articles such as carpets, cycles, clocks and watches, electrical goods, furniture, gramaphones, gold and artificial gold thread, hosiery, henna, motor cars, perfumery, toilet soaps, silken goods, sewing machines, rubber tyres and tubes, typewriters, boots, shoes, playing cards etc. Alcohol, tobacco and cigarettes pay 15 % duty# PARI II (a) TRADE General Conditions In spite of the control on exports in the countries y *hich are the main sources of supply for Bahrain the trade for the year under report has been satisfactory. The total value of trade, excluding oils, for the year under review amounted to k 3,82,36,770 (imports * 2,13,45,290; Exports £ 1,68,91,480) as con^ared with a 3,51,35,260 (imports ill 2,21,59,030; Exports is 1,29,76,230) in the previous year, showing an increase of 31,01,510. In order to obtain a true indication of the trend of trade, the value of direct transhipments and re-exports from The bond should be excluded#/ total value of transhipment cargoes and cargoes re-exported from bond for the year under review In- amounted to m 45,81,910# The total value of imports, including specie but excluding transhipment cargoes, amounted to £ 1,67,63,380; and the total value of exports, including specie and cargoes re-exported from bond, amounted to k1 23,09,570. The true trade values after excluding the value of direct transhipments and re-exports from bond are, therefore, as follows s- klt&gt;56-39 1939-40 1^40-41 * k h Imports 1,58,£4,730 l,b5,47,430 1,67,63,380 Exports 74,02,490 7S,1S,050 77,27,660 It ttiiil be observed that iaports show an increase of 3b 12 9 15,950 as compared with an increase of M 16,62,700 during 1939-40# Exports also show an increase of k 5,15,610 as compered with a decline of &amp; 1,90,440 in 1939-40 The value of transhipment cargo considerably less than that of last year, owing xirs^iy to the comyletion of constructional v^ork at Liianran ana, seconaly, to the develop ment of the port of Has Tanura. The increase in the true value of trade is mainly due to certain aerohants, anticipating control on exports in other countries, importing large stocks in order to maintain reserves. The slight increase in the true value of exports is chiefly due to the neigliboaring iLrab States, who heve been unable to ostein their supplies from abroad, buying their normal requirements in Bahrain, Growth of foreign competition vis-a-vis British Trade United Kingdom goods have on the vihole a high reputa tion for quality, but lately in vie* of the slackness of the pearl trade, it seems that cheap Japanese goods have found favour in tae market. The total value of imports of cotton pibcegogds from England to Bahrain has decreased from k 4,42,500 in 1932-33 to s 1*03,500 in 1940-41; imports of the same material from India have also decreased from nearly 'to 7 lakhs in 1932-33 to fe 4,64,000 in 1940-41. On the other hand imports tfrom Japan increased from * 5t lakhs in 1932-33 to just over 8 lakhs in 1940-41. 'The main reason for this unfor tunate diversion of trade has been the copying by Japanese firms of almost /^laost all British designs of cotton oiecegoods at a con siderably lower prices The current year's figures as com pared with the last two years 1 are given below. The drop in iacorts from Japan is probably due to the maricet being already over-stocked from the previous years' ia^ports. 1958-39 1959-40 1940-41 M * as Imports of cotton goods from:- England 2,37,100 1,63,700 1,03,500 Japan 14,74,300 14,90,100 8,17,600 India 4,13,100 4,49,500 4,64,000 Opening for British goods There Is a considerable market in Bahrain for tobacco and cigarettes, drugs and medicienes, bicycles, marine engine§ haberdashery and hosiery, hides and skins, dyes and colours, oils and paints, china and glassware, twist and yarn, soap, perfumes, sparking plugs, wireless sets, tools and electrical equipment, tinned foods, hardware and cutlery. Overtrading Nil Commercial Iforality Good Credits offered by foreign firms as opposed to those granted by British firms The exports from Bahrain, apart from oil, being negligible, no credits are offered by foreign or British firms# (b) FINANCIAL Tightness of Money - to what extent Ifoney during the year under review can be said to have been easy. Banking Facilities /-- - 6 - Banking raclliti^s There is a branch of tne Eastern Bank Limited in Bahrain which transacts ail types of business. The Hundi sys tem is also used by Hindu merchants. Bankruptcies 311 Exchange The average sterling-rupee rate of exchange during the period under report was Rs. 1,345 per £ 100. The Bombay Bahrain rate of exchange fluctuated between 1 ^ premium and 1 % discount. (c) AGRICULTURE Approximate area under cultivation The area of Bahrain is roughly 1,38,000 acres, of which | roughly 1/12 th is cultivable and 1/20 th is at present under cultivation. Harvest The principal crops grown are dates and lucerne. As a result of greatly increased demand by the European and American residents more attention is novs being paid to the cultivation of vegetables. Irrigation The whole of the irrigation water in Bahrain, with the exception of a small quantity which is lifted from wells by hand or draught bullocks, is supplied from artesian springs and artesian bores. Some canals lead out from these springs but as no adequate seepage drains exist, the uncontrolled application of water from the springs and artesian wells has a detrimental effect on the land. A scheme of water control and provision of adequate seepage is under consideration. An Egyptian agricultural expert has recently been engaged by the Banrain Government. (d) INDUSTRY- 7 - (d) IHDU^TRY State of Industry generally Bahrain is famous throughout the world for its pearl Industry on v .hich a great number of people still depend for their livelihood* Unfortunately this industry has suffered a sharp decline in recent years. Other industries are : boat-building, manufacture of sail cloth and reed mats, date cultivation and breeding of particu larly fine draught donkeys. Use of electricity in industry The high cost of electricity produced by the State has unfortunately discouraged its use in any industry. Development of mines The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited now owns a fully developed oil field. A very modern refinery, capable of deal ing with over ^5,000 barrels of oil daily, has been working steadily to full capacity. The figures below will give some idea of the development of the oil fields Quantity of oil shipped for the fiscal ' year 1st April 1940 to 21st March 1341 ... 3,49,207 tons Total production of oil for the same period • 9,42,554 tons Quantity of crude oil received from Arabia and refined in Bahrain approximately in the same period.. ... 5,53,163 tons (e) colcaumicmqm ASP XtUlM sport \ freight. Sh.l;'^l nn K-Tlaatlon Freighti Bahrain - Basra Bahrain - Karachi Bahrain - Bombay Bahrain - Gulf Ports The most frecuent calls were made by passenger and freight carrying services of the British India Steam navigation Company, who have maintained a fairly regular service in the Gulf throughout the war. They also carry mails to from the Gulf ports. The local agents et Bahrain are Messrs. Gl'ay Mackenzie /- &gt;v X Rs. 18/- psr ton t^eral cargo Rs. S0/4 per ton general cargo Rs. 22/- per ton general cargo Rs. 22/4 per ton general cargo \ \- 8 - Mackenzie and Coinpany Limited. Insurance facilities are also offered by these agents. Other shipping lines operating are: The Strick and Elleraan Line, The Silver Java pacific Line and The Mitsui Bussan Kaisha (See statistics for the ships which have called at this port during the year)• Shallow water round the Island makes navigation un usually difficult and steamers normally anchor at a distance of about four miles from shore. Lighterage There are a number of sea going dhows with cargo capacity of up to 40 tons each. In addition there are twelve steel lighters each cap: bis of carrying S00 tons with suitable towing units. Lighterage charges during the /ear under review on all types of cargo were between &amp; 3/- and $ 5/- per ton, which includes landing charges at the pier. State of Rosds Motor roads suitable for cars and lorries exist over most of the two main islands. There are approxinately 267 motor cars, S16 lorries and buses, and 30 motor cycles which are almost exclusively of American manufacture. New Roads Constructed No road of any importance was constructed during the year under report. Upkeep of Old Roads All the existing roads have been mainoained in good condition. /verage Transport H&amp;tes, Summer and winter&gt; on Chief Irade Routes Land trade routes - Nil Sea rou&amp;es - See 'Shipping' above. In addition motor boats ply regularly between Bahrain, Qatlf and ! 0qair and occasionally to other ports on the mainland and Iran. Transport charges are low. Effect /-Fffect of ^otor Transport as against Anlaai Transport Donkeys and camels are still used for carrying goods for short distances, especially in the town itself, owing to the cheapness of this method of transport. Air Services The British Overseas Airways and have maintained regular bi-weeltly services during the period under report, (f) SOCIAL Standard of living Owing to the decline of the Pearl trade, there has been no improvement in the standard of living. The eaagployment offered bj the oil companies has not br-en on a sufficiently large scale to affect any material improvement. Lm^loymont There are 1504 3ahrainls in the employ of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. The California Jkrahian Standard Oil Company Petroleum Development (Qatar) Iiimlted and Petroleum Concessions Limited iho maintain offices in Bahrain also en^loy a number of Bahrainis. The Bahrain petroleum Company also employ 217 Europeans and Americans and 831 Asiatic foreigners. Other oil companies also employ a fev. Iraqis and British Indians. Other inhabitants of the islands are employed in Fishing, Pearling, Agriculture, Boatmaking and other local trades. Fvidence of Migration Nil public Health and Hygiene The health of the towns has been good on the whole. There have been no epidemics. There are three hospitals in Bahrain: The State Medical Hospital Has a branch at Ifciharraq ana is also maintaining village dispensaries which are proving very useful. The Aaerican Mission Hospital j- which is furnished with x-ray euuipaent and l - 9 -The Victoria Memorial Hospital. No cases of plague or cholera were reported during the year. An anti-malaria campaign has reduced malaria to a mini- mam and in course of time ix is possible that malaria may be eradicated from Bahrain. In spite of the efforts of the medical authorities eye disease remains common amang tne local iniiabitants. ilunlcljal vServices There are mnlcxpal councils in Manama and Muharraq. Their services include Tioads, drains, reclamation of swains and anti malarial measures. Taxation Private property is free from taxation but there are municipal taxes in the towns of Manama and Muharraq. rmmgrn-ammmmsamm The Political Agent^ Bahrain, %ho is in close touch with local affairs and those of the mainland will be glad to answer any enquiries regarding trade from merchants in the United Kingdom through the Department of Overs as Trade, and from merchants in India through the Director General of Commercial intelligence, Calcutta. oQoTABLE C~IU~ isXPOHTS- Cont. 73 Articles am) countries to 3hich exported* jjULJititv^ YfiJlttfit lkie8-3'd ld3d-.40 li^40^41 1938-33 ld3d-40 1940*40.
