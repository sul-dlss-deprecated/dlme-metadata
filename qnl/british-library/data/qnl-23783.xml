Our supplies of T. r ater in the barge are not as plentiful at present as they vrere in peace tine for the reason that generally speaking the distilling plants of the ships here now produce a very much smaller margin above actual requirements than did the ships we had previously. In fact in sane cases we have to purchase water. Naturally I do not wish to stop supplies completely, but might I ask you to ensure that water obtained from the Base is only used for drinking purposes in your household.

I cannot trace any definite orders on the file covering the P.A., H.C., H.M. or Mr. fhomas, but on the . 25th July 1929 the distribution, as approved by the then P.A. (Captain^now Major—Prior), was drums (p.18) though no reason for the increase is assigned. f On the 22nd April 1934 the number was further increased by ten drums (that is, from 26 to 36 drums) though no record exists as to how these were to be distributed. The distribution given by me on the 5th January 1935 (see note of that date) excluding that of the A.P.A. was got from David, who is in charge of the actual despatch of the v/ater after the H.C. has seen that the number received is correct. For the concurrence in the distribution of water to the P.A. I.A., H.C. please see pages 5 to 7.

Said says that the drums were leaking. I do not believe this because with the addition of 20 new drums he could have picked up the b6 from amongst the total of 57. The drums if leaking could have been replaced by Nakhuda if he had been informed. A cap of the drum is also lost b by Said. Nakhuda and David think that Said either takes the water to his own house or sells it. They request that he should be warned and ordered to obey his superiors.

The file’s principal correspondents are: the Political Agent or Assistant Political Agent at Bahrain (numerous incumbents); the Clerk-in-Charge of the British Naval Base at Jufair [Al Jufayr]; the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf [SNOPG] (Commodore Cosmo Moray Graham); the Commanders of various British vessels in the Persian Gulf Squadron (including HMS
                           Fowey, HMS
                           Deptford, HMS
                           Bideford, HMS
                           Shoreham).The bulk of the file is letters sent from the Political Agency, approximately on a weekly basis, requesting water from different sources. Between 1935 and 1938 requests were sent to British naval vessels at Bahrain, following an arrangement agreed between the Political Agent and the SNOPG. The naval vessels at Bahrain had on-board distilling plants, enabling them to produce their own drinking water. From 1938, requests for water were sent to the Clerk-in-Charge at the British naval base at Jufair.Wartime correspondence acknowledges anticipated and actual shortages in freshwater supplies. A note by the Political Agent (Hugh Weightman) dated 22 September 1939 details revised quantities and distribution of water at the Agency (f 209). Two pieces of correspondence from the SNOPG to the Political Agent, dated 24 August 1940 and 24 January 1942, note respectively the reduced water distillation capacity of British naval ships, and subsequent inability to continue supplying water to the Agency (f 263, f 304).Other papers in the file relate to:the Commandant of the Bahrain State Police’s displeasure at the use of his sepoys to convey water to the Agency (ff 2-4);requests for increases or decreases in water supply at the Agency, in response to visits by the Political Resident, or absences from the Agency of the Political Agent;water distribution lists for staff at the Agency (for example, f 243).The file notes at the end of the file (ff 307-329) offer further insight into policies and arrangements relating to water supply at the Agency, including distribution lists for Agency staff.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Royal Navy, HMS Jufair, Naval Base</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Water supply</topic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Drinking water</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0000fc#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
