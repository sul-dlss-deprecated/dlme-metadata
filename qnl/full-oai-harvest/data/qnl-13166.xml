The lower right corner of page 13–14 has broken off entirely.Many of the individual images are faded and some show signs of surface losses.Foliation:The images have been numbered 1–118 alongside each image in pencil and paginated 1–47 in pencil in the upper right corner. Some additional image sequencing in pencil in the first twenty nine pages of the album (e.g. a–d on each page) has been crossed out.Process:Gelatin silver printsBinding:The album is bound in maroon three-quarter-leather format, which is heavily scuffed along the spine, particularly at the upper spine.This binding likely dates to its presentation to Lord Curzon and indicates the title of the album with gilt stamp ‘ Photos’ ‘South Persia’. The binding also features linen joints and hand-stitching.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Genre/Subject Matter:The album contains landscape and architectural views of South Persia and the Persian Gulf coastline.
