C., Part IT., p. 35—39. t Letters from Aden, 22nd and 23rd Feb ruary 1886. It has been mentioned in a previous Memo randum* that proposals were made to the French Government in 1885 for restricting the trade in arms on the Red Sea and on the Somali Coasts, and that, pending the conclusion of a Convention to this effect, an arrangement had been made on the 15th December 1884 between the Resident at Aden (General Blair) and the French Consul at that port, under which all arms and ammunition for Obokh would be passed by the authorities which were covered by the special permission of the repre sentative of France at Aden in each case, and that consignments of arms, &amp;c., awaiting transhipment might be deposited in the Customs warehouse as heretofore. On the 19th February 1886f the Resident (Brigadier-General Hogg) forwarded to the French Consul at Aden a list of the actual number and description of consignments of arms, ammu nition, military stores, &amp;c., transhipped at Aden for Obokh from 14th February 1885 to 1st February 1886, showing that a large import of arms and ammunition was carried on by foreigners w r ho used Aden as a port of transhipment for the opposite African coast, and invited his co-operation in checking the indiscriminate import of arms into Africa via Obokh, adding that he believed that the attainment of this result had the sympathy of the French local authorities on the coast. The Re sident further said that, although the above- mentioned arms, &amp;c., were intended for Shoa, still there was no security that after leaving French territory a portion might not have fallen into the hands of the Dankalis and Somalis. At any rate it was known that the possession of firearms by the natives on the African coast had certainly become more common. Another mattei was that were any kafila consisting of cases of arms, &amp;c., overpowered en route to Shoa by the intervening tribes, the consequences would be very serious as well to the Government of the Republic as that of Her Majesty. , M. de Gaspary (22nd February 1886) entirely agreed with Brigadier-General Hogg that the wholesale importation of arms would seriously impair the interests of both France and England on the Somali Coast, and undertook to urge on his Government that the introduction of arms, Ac., into Obokh, or the adjoining French territory, should be formally prohibited. In the meantime tne Resident begged M. de Gaspary to intimate to al 15607. 1.1201. A2 French subjects at Aden concerned in this traffic that the transhipment of arms, ammunition, &amp;c., would, in future, be prohibited. In forwarding the correspondence to the Foreign Office on the 18th March 1886, Lord Kimberley stated that he entirely concurred in the opinions expressed by the Resident at Aden that the time had now arrived for a reconsideration of the matter, in view to some arrangement being entered into with the French Government for the restriction of the trade of arms on the Red Sea and on the Somali Coasts. Lord Lyons was accordingly instructed (30th March) to draw the attention of the French Govern ment to this correspondence, and to ascertain whether they were prepared to entertain the pro posal made to them in 1885. On the 26th May Lord Lyons transmitted copy of a Note in which M. de Freycinet stated that he concurred in the opinion of Her Majesty’s Government as to the danger of an unrestricted trade in arms in that part of the world, and asked to be made acquainted with the regulations on the subject, the establish ment of which would be deemed advisable by the British authorities. M. de Freycinet added that measures had already been taken to prohibit the introduction into the interior of a certain quantity of arms and ammunition landed at Obokh, or in its neighbourhood. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thereupon inquired of the Secretary of State for India as to the nature of the regula tions which should be recommended to the French Government as proper to be adopted by the French and* British local authorities. Lord Rosebery added that whenever an agreement was arrived at with the French Government, he would propose to invite the Italian Government to join in it, and give similar instructions to their authorities on the coast. The Resident at Aden was (4th June) in con sequence requested to submit, for the consideration of the Earl of Kimberley, a draft of the regula tions which might be recommended to the French Government with this object. In reply, Brigadier-General Hogg wrote as follows on the 28th June 1886 :—* 2. At Aden, the import, export, and transhipment of arm: and ammunition are regulated by the provisions of the Indiai Arms Act XI. of 1878. “3. Importation for trade purposes is strictly limited to j moderate and carefully watched traffic in lead and sulphur foi export into Arabia. Such small quantities of ammunition as an required for sporting purposes are not objected to. No arm: are allowed entry if intended for local sale. “4. Export and transhipment are permitted (in accordanc. with the instructions of the Government of Indiaf) when tin Resident considers that no detriment will be caused to Britisl interests, and are prohibited when any friendly Power invites co operation in checking the traffic between Aden and ports whicl that Government desires to close to the entry of arms and am munition. 5. Ihe import of arms and ammunition, or other warlike stores, is entirely prohibited at Berbera and Zaila. The trade i not attempted at any other of the British protected ports.

August3 .cguiawuus necessary to give ett'ect to this should be left to each Power. 5 * arrangement It is thus seen that the Political Resident, ap prehending that the object proposed was to stop entirely the traffic in arms and ammunition on the African coast, suggested that a convention might he entered into by the Governments concerned, binding themselves to altogether prohibit the im port, export, and transhipment, for trade purposes, of arms, ammunition, and warlike stores, and that the framing of the local regulations necessary to give effect to this arrangement should he left to each Power. The original proposal, however, as has already been stated, was to restrict, not to suppress this trade entirely, and the attention of the Government of India was drawn to the matter,* with a request that, as Brigadier-General Hogg’s reply was not sufficiently definite for the object in view, a draft of the local regulations which it might be desirable to lay down for the regulation, and not the entire restriction, of the arms traffic should be submitted. The Resident was in consequence instructed by the Government of Bombay to submit a draft of such local regulations as they might consider however, rejoined that— “ It is the object of this Residency to entirely prohibit the trade in arms. Weapons and ammunition in the hand-j of persons con nected with scientific missions, or Government expeditions, or European traders and travellers for their personal defence, when entering Africa by any port situated between Massowah and the territories of the Sultan of Zanzibar, ought to be passed under certain special restrictions. “ 2. For the above purpose the various Powers interested might come to an understanding that no arms, ammunition, or warlike stores shall be transhipped at, or exported from, Aden to any part of the coast line above defined, except with the joint consent of the British authorities and the Consular Officer at Aden, of the Power within whose protectorate the place of import lies. “ Secondly. The import of arms, ammunition, or warlike stores to be absolutely prohibited over the whole of the above coast line, except for any of the purposes mentioned in para. 1, and then only when protected by a license from the Consular authority at Aden of the Government concerned. “ Thirdly. That copies of all licenses granted, by whomsoever issued, be supplied to each of the Powers joining the Convention. “3. It is for the mutual benefit of England, France, Italy, and Germany that north-east Africa shall be kept as long as possible free from all evils consequent on the introduction ot firearms, and I do not believe that this can be accomplished if any countenance be given to the traffic in muskets and gunpowder, however safe- a-uarded by preventive regulations. The importance of this matter is as well known and understood by the local officials of all the Powers mentioned as by the British authorities at Aden.” t Letter from Aden, 16th November 1886. suitable for the purpose.

X Letter from Aden, dated 24th January However, on the 22nd January 1887,t in com pliance with a telegraphic instruction from the4 Government of India to send a P‘'“ ise dl ® f ‘ , of nronosed vestulations for controlling the tiafflc in S as distinguished from its entire restriction, the' Resident submitted to the Government ol Bombay the following draft regulations, oddi that it y was very desirable that the adhesion of Germany and Italy should be obtained m inspect to the coast line under the respective protection of Hogg did not think this Convention could have any value unless there was a furt agreement or understanding that the issue of licenses for the transhipment or import of arms, ammunition, and military stores for trade purpose, was opposed to the policy of both Powers. To em body such a stipulation in the draft Convention would not, however, he in accordance with the wishes of the Government of India who referred to trallic as distinguished from entire restriction. . The draft Convention was to the following •— Convention between the British and Trench Govern ments for controlling the trade in Arms, Am munition, and Military Stores on the ^North- East African Coast, under the respective protection of the said Powers.

In witness whereof the respective plenipoten tiaries have signed the same, and have affixed thereto the seals of their arms. Dated at this day of 1887. No steps were taken in the matter pending the Demi-official ; Mr. Forbes to receipt of the views of the Government of India 1?radford ’ 16th A P nl 1887 ' which were communicated in the following Note from the Under Secretary in the Foreign Department:— “ I send you a draft embodying the regulations which we would recommend should be adopted for the control of the arms trade on the Somali Coast. It has been framed after reference to the Government of Bombay and the Resident at Aden, and we believe meets the requirements of the case. The draft takes the form of an Order of Her Majesty in Council applicable to the African coast. We are advised that this is the only manner in which the regulations can be made equally operative in the tracts under the British Protectorate. So far as Aden is concerned the Indian Arms Act is sufficient. If we are, however, to have effective control over the traffic on the African and Arabian coasts, it is indispensable that Her Majesty’s Government should have an agreement with the French and possibly the Italian, and German Governments, to accept and enforce the measures now proposed so far as they concern the territories in that quarter which are under their protection. The draft assumes that the necessary steps will be taken to this end. General Hogg, in his letter of 22nd January 1887, suggests a convention with those Powers. But the object in view may probably be attained by less formal means. This, however, is a matter for Her Majesty’s Government.” The draft Order in Council is drawn up in the Draft Order in Council, following terms:— Draet Order in Council. I. In this Order “ arms ” includes fire-arms, bayonets, swords, daggers, spears, spear-heads, bows, arrows, cannon, parts of arms, and machinery for the manufacture of arms. “ Ammunition ” includes all parts of ammunition and all machinery for manufacturing ammunition. “ Military stores ” includes sulphur and lead. II. The importation and transhipment of arms, ammunition, and military stores within the British Protectorate on the North-East coast of Africa for trade purposes is hereby prohibited except under license as herein-after appearing, and in the manner and to the extent permitted by such license.IIL Licenses for the importation of arms, am munition, and military stores into ports and places within the British Protectorate on the North-East coast of Africa may be issued by the Political Agent for the Somali Coast stationed at Aden. IV. Arms, ammunition, and military stores brought into any of the ports or places above men tioned for transhipment to ports or places on the North-East coast under the protection of theErench (German or Italian) Government shall not he per mitted to he transhipped at the ports and places aforesaid except under license granted by the Political Agent for the Somali Coast stationed at Aden. Such license shall be granted by him only on the production of a permit from the Erench (German or Italian) Consul at Aden authorizing the applicant to import such arms, ammunition, or military stores into ports or places on the North-East coast of Africa under the protection of the Erench (German or Italian) Governments respectively. V. Any person infringing any of the provisions of the Order shall he triable in the Court of the Political Agent for the Somali Coast stationed at Aden, and shall he punished with imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. VI. Any arms, ammunition, or military stores imported or transhipped in contravention of the provisions of this Order shall he liable to con fiscation. E. N.
