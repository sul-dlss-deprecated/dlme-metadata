A deserted walled town standing high on the left bank of the Aras the direct and easiest line of communication between the rich valley of Nakhjivan and Khoi. It was once a flourishing town and owed its pros penty to Armenian enterprise to whose energy and art its cut-stone church and ruined embankment yet testify. Before the Russian war in the early part of the 19th century, the banks were connected by a bridge of boats. After the war the opening of roads to Julfa and Shah Takht as main lines of communication, soon caused the place to be deserted. Parallel t the river on the Persian side is a low line of earthworks, about 200 or 300 yards long, relics of the time of ’Abbas Mirza. The country is barren and salt. A semicircular piece o land (radius 3| versts or 4,083 yards) on IL right bank of the Aras opposite ’Abbasabad, became Russian territorv in virtue of the Turkmanchai treaty (1828), but was restored to Persia together with the village Hisar on the Khorasan—Trans-Caspian frontier in C300GSB ' m’ABBASlBlD exchange ior the village and grounds o£ FIruzeh in accordance with the CO About°a n thirda mile below the church is the ford.

The old Tehran-Kum road crosses the river by an old bridge, 5 miles below the new bridge. In its lower course it is called Ab-i-Shur on account of its salty water.— (Schindler.) AB-I-AHFOZ— A mountain stream rising in the Kuh-i-Ahfaz (q. v.), south of Khunsar near Akhura-bala and Khdjgan ; it flows south-east and joins the Zindih- rud near Imamzadeh Isma’il (q. v.).

At the point of its junction with the Hulvan, it is said to be spanned by a natural arch of rock which is called in consequence Pul-i-Khuda (God’s bridge). In the narrow valley which opens into the plain of Direh are the winter pasture grounds of the Kirmanshah stud. This spot has been selected as well on account of its excellent herbage as for the security of its position, shut in between the hills on one side and the river on the other, and horses reared on it are celebrated through Persia. The plain is about 4 miles in length and 2 miles in breadth. It was formerly included in the j)dshdlik°oi Zohab, but after the conquest of that district by the Persians, it was purchased by the Kalhnr chiefs from its Turkish owners.

Leleux and H. L. Rabino, 1902-03). IB-I-GARAN— A small river in Kurdistan. It rises near the village Galeh in the Marivan buluk. Two farsakhs from its source it passes the village Garan, and six farsakhs farther, at the village Qalagah, it joins the Ab-i-Marlvan. (Schindler.) AB-I-GARM (1)— A small and dilapidated village in the Khur district. It contains 12 inhabitants and is situated on the summit of a low pass between two low chains of hills. There are about two acres of cultivation and a small fort. Close by is an Imamzadeh. The remarkable feature of the place is the spring. The water issues at one spot from the ground in a copious stream at a temperature of 125°, and at another spot, not 20 yards off, is a spring whose temperature is below 60°. The water here, both hot and 1 cold, is fresh and good, and celebrated for its healing properties.— (Vaughan.)

Long. 46° 14' E. Elev. —5,500' {Gerard.) 5350' (Rozario.) A river of Kirmanshah, which rises close to the gates of Zagros, and has a tortuous course of nearly 100 miles in a south-east direction. In the latter part of its course, it forces its way through the Zagros, by a tremendous gorge, into the plain of Zangavan. Thence, it joins the Ab-i-Shirvan, and passes in a south-south-east direction through the valley of Rudbar, (Rawlinson — Rabino .) The Ab-i-Karind has two sources, one to the east of the Tak-i-Girreh pass at an elevation of 1,895 metres, (5,680'), the other in the mountain to the north of Karind. These two streams unite in a flat valley, the average elevation of which is about 1,500 metres (5,000'),; the length of the valley is 20 kilometres, (12| miles), and its width from 5 to 6 kilometres. To the north the valley is bordered by a rampart of limestone, practically vertical, which separates it from the plain of Biwanij. To the south is the great Noah-Kuh range. In leaving this valley the Ab-i-Karind enters a^series of gorges and defiles, where, in the space of a few kilometres it falls about 200 metres (660 feet). The river then waters the plain of Harunabad, which has an elevation of about 1,300 metres (4,300'). The dimensions and shape of the Dasht-i-Harunabad are about the same as those of the Dast-i-Karind. The river then enters further gorges, to descend to the Mahal-i-Aivan and Chahar Davar, the elevation of which is between 1,000 and 800 metres. At Chahar-Davar the Ab-i-Karind joins the Gamasiab (Saidmarreh) in the middle of inacessible gorges, the queerest of which is certainly that of Tang-i-Charmin, on the upper border of the Saidmarreh. The difference of elevation of the Ab-i-Karind at its source and at its junction with the Gamasiab is 1,200 metres, occurring in a distance of 120 kilometres.—{De Morgan, 1S92). The Ab-i-Karind is supposed to be the ancient Choaspes. AB-I-KASHl— A stream crossed by the road from Hama dan to Malayar, 2| miles from Hamadan.

The sources of the former are the Karaj or Karj Rud and the Ab-i-Khunsar, both rising in Faridan, those of the latter near Deh Nau. These two streams join below Kaidu and form the LaTbar river. The9 AB-I-Q—AB-IS- La'lbar after passing the villages of Charras and Arkedeh forces its way through a narrow gorge and enters the Mahallat district, takes up its drainage and flows in a north-easterly direction towards Qum.

AB-I-SHlRWAN. See also AB-I-KARIND. A river of Kirmanshah, which rises near Sinneh and flows towards the Avroman mountains, where it receives numerous petty tributaries. About 10 miles beyond Darneh in the same direction, it takes a westerly course of 20 miles through the mountains to Gundar, where it receives the Zimkan Rud which rises near Gahvareh in the Guran country at about 70 miles distance towards the south-east. Immediately after this increase the Ab-i- Shlrwan forces ros way through a narrow gorge (without even suffleient space for a footpath along its bank) into the plain of Sem/ram. where it is joined by a considerable affluent, formed by the waters of the Taj Rud and Salmi C300GSB10 AB-I-S—AB-I-Y It now takes a south-west direction still preserving the same name. Below the junction of the Sulaiman eh river it receives from the Zagros, on the east side, two considerable streams, the first at 35 miles from that junction, call d the ’Abbasan and the second called the Kuretu 25 miles further on. . The Ab-i-Slfrwan now runs nearly south for about 30 miles when it receives the Hulwan near Khaniq'n, whence the united waters take the name of Diala {q. v.). On the road between Sulaiman’eh and Kirmanshah there is a ford at Baneh Kalan, which is practicable in summer, but in the winter wholly impassable. There was formerly a substantial brick bridge over the river at this point. It is not navigable at any part of its course, but timber is frequently floated down to the Tigris from the mountains of Kurdistan. From near the town r f Gundar to the plain of Slvrwadeh, this river forms the boundary between Persia and Turkey. It is also called the Upper Diala, Rohava, and Rakam ‘h.

Its principal villages are :— r Yulgun Aghach, Tikan Tappeh, Chiragh Tappeh, Akdareh, Babanazar, Hampa Aqbulagh. The Governor of the_ district, generally an Afshar chief, resides in a strong castle at A ulgun Aghach, built by the late Sulaiman Khan, who died A. D. 1883, more than 100 years of age. A hundred horsemen are furnished by the district for the Shah’s service and the regiment of Maragheh is supplied with a few men serving as volunteers or substitutes. Grain is produced in sufficient quantity to supply the wants of the district, but there is little surplus. The people live chiefly by raising sheep and cattle for sale in the Khamseh and Kazvln districts. The district is rich in minerals.

It is said to have existed over 1,000 years, and has many monu ments and ancient inscriptions. It lies about 2 miles south of the moun tains bounding the south of the plain. It is remarkable for its noble cara- vansarai and “ dbambdr,” built by a merchant of Rasht about 1851 ; also for a large spring in a hollow under the fort, which is fed from the hills. The date trees and myrtle bushes in its neighbourhood give the place a picturesque appearance. Water and supplies are plentiful. The district of Aghda appears to contain only two other villages, viz., Shamsabad andAGHD—AHAN 15 Saiyid Muhammad to the east and about 12 inhabited mazra’ehs.

Holmes, who visited it in 1843, states the greater part of the place was in ruins, notwithstanding its being the residence of one of the Persian princes, its Governor. A stream of the same name flows by it in an easterly direction, on the bank of which wheat and barlev are grown. The district abounds in very rich veins of metals, iron, t’n, and copper [vide Urguhart) which, under a better government, might be a source of incalculable wealth.

The village was originally contained within the four mud walls of a large fort, but now about two-thirds of the houses are outside them. It is on the bank of the Zamrud, the bed of which is about 30 yards wide, but is quite dry for a great part of the year. The river supplies the town with capital water in the rainy season, but stops 3 miles short in the hot weather when there is a great scarcity of water. The water here is said to be very brackish.AJAB—AJI-C 21 To the south-west of the village is a range of hills which supply Tehran with salt. The salt is got by blasting, and is pure without adm ixture of earth, the supply is inexhaustible. In these hills are numbers of deer which are very fond of the saline springs. The rains of the ancient city of Kai Kans (Cambyses) are situated about 2 miles south-west from the village, and between it and the hills above-mentioned. There are also ruins of two forts, the larger of which was 115 yards long by 100 yards broad with very thick walls. This village pays 200 tumans in cash, 250 khanv 'rs of wheat and 300 of straw.

In the spring, on the melting of the snows, it is a rapid and considerable river ; later in the season most of its water is lost in irrigation, and in the summer its bed near the lake is frequently dry. The water is clear, but gets salt in passing through the salt plain 20 miles north-west of Tabriz and be comes more and more so on its approach to the lake, owing to the extensive saline marshes surrounding it. Close to the northern gate of Tabriz a brick bridge of 12 arches and 230 paces in length crosses one of its tributaries. From this bridge the roads to BayazTd and Tiflis separate. The river is sometimes so hard frozen and hidden by snow in the winter as to be indis tinguishable from the surrounding country. The total length of the river is 140 miles ; in August it is usually dry.— (Holmes — Morier—Gerard —• Schindler — Picot.) AJl-CHAI, (2) also erroneously HAJl-CHAl— A river in Kurdistan.

There are 80 inhabited houses ; population 350. It is watered by leads from the river. There is a good spring nearly in the old river-bed. A species of ferry is arranged for -crossing the river when in flood, consisting of a rope stretched across to which is fastened a raft, made of inflated skins, covered with boards well secured. The river is here about 30 yards broad with steep banks. There is a similar ferry a little higher up stream.— (Preece.)

Ouseley, however, says of it :— ‘ ‘ There are many large and handsome houses here, reminding one of Brabant and Flanders, some of them being roofed with very good red tiles/ 1 and Stuart seems to agree with him. Eastwick says it is surrounded with thickets of the box tree from 10 to 15 feet high. It is a village of mendicants who are eternally saluting every traveller with the cry of ‘ hak ! hak ’ ! The only healthy place is the ceme tery, or Imamzadeh, a building not inferior to, and with very much the air of, a country churchyard in England. The gateway of this building is where travellers usually rest. Melgunoff (1864) says of it; it is situated on the Talar river and has 400 houses. Among the inhabitants are some Janbeglu and Madanlu Kurds. The village has frequently been raided by Turkomans. Shah ’Abbas built a palace there and the great paved road or causeway passed through the village. Rice and cotton are much cultivated and much silk is also pro duced. Wild pig 5 abound in the rice fields and the people have the custom of hanging the heads of the pigs they kill on trees, which increases the noxious exhalations.— (Melgunoff, 1864; Ouseley; Eastwick; Holmes, Stuart: Schindler, 1910.) ’ALlABAD (2)— A village, 8 miles west of Damghan, on the road to Gusheh.

The Chief of Maku and his family are said to belong to this sect. ^ Little is known of their origin or doctrines. Two theories have been advanced—- (a) That they are a remnant of the old Persians partly converted to Islamism through fear. ! (b) That they are really Christians outwardly professing Muhammad- ■ anism. The srories of their practising obscene rites are apparently untrue.

It is about 30 miles in length, by 20 miles in breadth. In this district is situated the famous rock of Aluh-Amut, 32 miles from i Kazvin and about 63 miles north-west of Tehran. The ruins of the castle of Hasan Sabah, theredoubtedchief of the Assassins are on the top of the rock ; the ridge on which they stand is about 300 yards in length from east to west, and very narrow, not 20 yards at the top. The height is about 200 feet pn all sides, except the west, where it may be 100. It is a bare rock exceed ingly steep. There are no habitations in the vicinity nearer than the village of Gazar Khaueh about two miles to the south, nor are there any traces of ruins. Within a short distance of the rock, there is a burial ground. There are some cisterns on the rock to catch rain water. The vicinity of the rock is a most dreary solitude; excepting eagles and lizards, not a living thing is to be seen, nor even a single tree. The view from the summit of the rock is very fine, embracing nearly the whole of the valley of Aluh-Amut, and all the high mountains by which it is enclosed. It is sometimes called “ A1 Mowut” and “ Allah-amout,” which latter signifies eagle s nest in the language of the province in which it is situated.-— {Sheil ; Malcolm • Schindler.)30 ALYA—AMIN ALVAD— A village in the Talish district, on the west shores of the Caspian.

A town in Mazandaran, 22 miles west-south-west of Barfarush, on both banks of the Harhaz. It is without walls or defences or any kind • it was once regarded as the capital of Tabristan, and celebrated for its beautv extent, and numerous population, but is now fallen much below its original importance, and wears an air of poverty, gloom, and progressive decay • yet several good shops still remain, and the bazaar is generally crowded with people. Most of the inhabited houses are constructed of wood, and either roofed with boards or thatched with straw. In the vicinity are 10 or 12 small towers (their forms various, but chiefly square and octagonal, with been ’’ aIr- 16 18 alS ° &amp; s P acious mausoleum, said to have been built by Shah Abbas over the remains of Saiyid Quvvam-ud-Dln*AM AN—ANAR 3$ a saintly monarch of Mazandaran, who in the 14th century raised himself to the throne by his virtues and abilities. He was better known as Mir Buzurg, came into power in 1358 and died in 1379. His descendants ruled Mazandaran until the begininng of the 16th century. The number of houses is from 4,000 to 5,000. The bazaars are large and well supplied, but beyond mere local traffic there is little or no trade. The inhabitants cultivate rice and cotton, or are employed in the canon foundries of the district. In summer they retire to their summer-houses in the mountains, which approach to within 5 or 6 miles of the town. In winter, when it is fullest, Amul contains a population of about 40,000, but in summer only 20,000 souls. There is here a handsome bridge of 12 arches over the Harhaz. The revenue derived from Amul, according to Fraser, amounted in 1822 to from 12,000 to 15,000 tumdns. Of this amount not above 3,500 was derived from the town, the rest arising from the country and villages an nexed to the district. Holmes, however, who visited the place 20 years after, says the revenue did not amount to more than 800 tumdns, and there is no doubt that between the two above-mentioned visits the place fell off greatly; when Fraser visited it, the Governor was a prince of the blood, but Holmes only found a Hakim appointed by the governor of the province of Mazandaran. The decay was owing chiefly to the desolation caused by the plague of 1831-32. To some extent it has recovered, but it lacks the stimu lus given by an increasing and active trade with the Russian coasts enjoyed by the towns nearer the ports of Mashad-i-Sar and Gaz. Amul was connected with Mahmudabad on the Caspian by rail and it was hoped to make it a considerable and important place, but the railway is now not in working order, and the enterprise may be said to be dead. The conces sionaire of the railway built sugar refinery works and wood-working shops here in 1890 .—(Fraser ; Holmes; Napier; Stack; Curzon.) AN AN or ANAND—Lat. 36° 14' O''; Long. 51° 20' 0'.

A town in the Biabanak division of Samnan. It is situated amid a cluster of low rocky hills which are accessible to infantry and mountain guns; these hills completely command it within 600 yards range. In the centre of the city is a steep rock, on which still stand the remains of an ancient fort. The town is supplied with water by an artificial stream which flows from the Kuh Daramgil, a very high and barren rocky range north-west of the city. The population consists chiefly of miners and camel owners. The former work the mines in the neighbourhood, of which there are many, both of lead and copper. The city is governed by a Naib, who is under the Tehran Government (not that of Yazd). There is a good caravanserai outside the walls. C300GSB84 ANAR—ANGU There are at least 30,000 camels belonging to the place, large numbers of which at certain times of the year are to be found feeding in the neigh bourhood of the wells in the surrounding country. There are no crops here; only a few gardens in the adjacent hills. Grain is imported from Nam, 15 farsakhs off. 4,000 to 6,000 sheep. Other supplies.—Chopped straw, dried fruits, chickens, eggs. The want of defilade in the city walls is very noticeable.

ANGURAN— 1 One of the 17 districts of Khamseh, it occupies all the east face of the range, which stretches up to the north as far as the Qaplan Kuh, and is broken by innumerable ravines, generally running in an east-by-south direction, which swell the waters of the Kizil Uzun; in the beds of these ravmes are situated the villages of the peasantry, smiling, and happy. o nnrw-k 11 -^ C ° n ^ ams about villages and pays an annual assessment of 3,000 tumans to Government, besides furnishing nearly 200 men for the army. This revenue is mainly realised from the produce of lead, large quantities of which are received by Government in lieu of money.ANJI—AQAJ 35 The Anguran lead mine is situated some miles north-west of Ganjabad in the Arghun Kuh at an elevation of 8,210'. Work goes on there for four months in the year only, as the mine is under snow the remainder of the year. When Schindler visited the mine is 1880, 110 men were employed in it and the yearly output did not exceed 14 tons of lead. The Government tax on the mine was £40 per annum. There are 7 shafts, one over 300 feet in depth. Some distance above the lead mine is an old and very extensive fluor-spar mine, which, however, is not worked now. The principal place of the district is the little town of Anguran on the Anguran river, which rises in the Arghun Kuh and flows into the Kizil Uzun ; but the Governor of the district resides at Ganjabad. The produce of grain in the district is very limited, and does not suffice for the wants of the population. The Anguranis are Turks, and consider themselves to be part of the great tribe of Afshars. The Government was formerly heredit ary in the family of a particular chief, subject, however, to the approval of the provincial governor appointed from Tehran. In common with the surrounding districts, it suffered greatly in the harassing conflict which was kept up all along this frontier between the Kurds and Kizilbash, previous to the rise of the Safavian dynasty. Towards the close of the sixteenth century, when the Turks had overrun Azerbaijan, Khamseh and the dependent districts as far as Hamadan were confided to the care of a chief named Daulat Yar Khan, of the Kurdish tribe of Siah Mansur; and, as the safety of ’Iraq depended upon the defence of this frontier government, the power of the Chief was strengthened with all the disposable means of the Empire. Daulat Yar Khan elated with this power and relying on the natural strength of his country, now took occasion to assert his independence; he built a very strong fort in these mountains of Anguran and defeated the first army that was sent against him; it was not until Shah ’Abbas the Great undertook in person the siege of his stronghold that this dangerous rebel lion was finally crushed. The remains of Daulat Yar’s castle are still shown upon a high peak north of Yenijah (? Yangizeh)(tfawfeon, Schindler.) ANJIRAK—Elev. 4,690'.

A pass in the district of Khamseh, over a spur of the Elburz, which separates the valley of Zinjan from that of Tarum, or the Safid Rud, From the village of Tim on the south side, the road ascends very steep ly indeed, for four miles to the summit, which is probably 7,000 to 8,000 feet in elevation. The descent on the north side follows the Liwan Chai. In the early part the road dips down abruptly from the top of .the ridge to a little dell, where a small ruined caravansarai still affords shelter to travellers, who may be benighted or weather-bound; it then follows the course of the stream, sometimes winding along the steep hillside, but more generally in the rough rocky bed of the torrent, which it crosses and recrosses a hundred times, till at length it reaches a huge craggy ridge, formed by a vertical projection of the strata, which serves as a sort of33 AQKA—ARAB outer rampart to the chain, and through which the stream forces its way by a tremendous chasm, cut almost perpendicularly in the naked rock; this is the key to the pass, and a few resolute men might defend it success fully against thousands. The road has been built up round the bluff edge of the precipice, and is so narrow that two horsemen can barely pass each other. Beyond the gorge, again, there is a very steep winding descent down the face of the hill to regain the bed of the torrent, and the pass then gradually opens on the valley of the Safid Rud. There are other passes, the Kamchai and Tirichai, but the Aq-gaduk is considered by far the easiest, and is the one generally followed. When in a state of repair, there is no obstruction whatever to laden mules in the lower part of the pass ; but during the winter there must always be difficulty in crossing the snowy ridge at the summit; indeed it frequently happens that this is blocked up for weeks together in a severe season. The length of the descent is nearly 12 miles, with a general direction north 66° east. This pass is in differently named the Aq-gaduk, or the defile of the Li wan Chai.— (Raw lins on.)

AQSU— A river which rises in the Lahijan district of Azarbaljan and, flowing down the western border of Kurdistan, eventually joins the Tigris. It passes through the deep valley of Sardasht on the road from Sauj Bulagh to Sulaimanieh, and is crossed by a sharp and difficult ford.— (Fraser; Gerard.) AQTAPPEH— A village in the Ardabll district of Azarbaljan, one stage south-east of Aslanduz on the road to Ardabll.— (Moner.) ’ARAB (1) (or ARABLE).— Elev. 2,000'. A Persian village in Azarbaljan of from 80 to 100 houses, situated near, the junction of the Zangmar-chal and Aras, from which it is distant aboutARAB—ARAB 39 1 mile, and facing the Russian village of Shah Takht (160 houses) which is built on a high spur overlooking the river about 1| miles awav from the water. There is a ferry here, constructed on exactly the same principle as that at Julfa, a boat platform and wire hawsers driven by the force of the current. One hawser is Russian property, the other Persian. The river keeps to the Russian side, leaving on the Persian a broad stretch of sand, about 80 yards wide. A ramp is cut to the water’s edge on the left bank, but carts have some difficulty in loading and unloading. Passport officers and guards are on both sides. A large trade passes by this ferry, which is on the direct line between Salmas, Khol and Urumieh on one side and Nakhchivan and Erivan on the other. The cotton trade is becom ing of importance; every village in the north-west cultivates a little and the Russian market always pays. There are two cotton-cleaning machines in the village imported from Russia. Russia has an almost complete monopoly of all classes of cottons from Julfa to Maku and Khoi. She gives a drawback on cotton stuffs, woollens and velvets. The exports are— Raisins 5,000 to 6,000 loads valued at 4 tumdns per load. Cotton, 300 camel loads, valued at 20 tumdns per load. Cotton stuffs from Salmas, in request by Russian Kurds, 300 donkey loads. Smuggling is a profitable business. Berdan rifles with the Russian mark, fetch 20 tumdns, others 15 tumdns. Cartridges cost 14 shdhis, or about | krdn (2|d.) each. The fords are many; between here and Kaghulak there are six, and up stream in the first 4 farsakhs there are six, and further upstream they become more numerous. These fords durum the summer and early autumn are open to men on foot, but are best avoided. At high water skins and rafts are utilised in spite of the Cossack guards. From ’Arab there is a track along the river bank to Zakirlu on the west, it is seldom used and is very rough owing to the lavatic outcrop which hereabouts covers the country.— (Picot, 1894.) ’ARAB (2)— A village in Azarbaljan, one stage north-west of Ardabil, on the road to Aslanduz. ’ARAB (3)— A sub-division of the Varamln district, south-east of Tehran.

A village in the Khar district. It has 150 houses and lies 73 miles from Tehran via Khatunabad and Aiwan-i-KIf in the Khar plain. There is extensive cultivation round it, producing 2,500 Jcharwdrs of wheat. There are miles of cotton and shaltuk ground, though there are only about 100 families in the village, who get among other things 15 Tdiar- wdrs of wheat each. The castle at this place, said to have been built by Gabrs, is worth a visit. It stands on a mound, 60' high, and on the steep est side the parapet at the top is 130' from the ground. From this there is a fine view over an immense plain. The walls of the castle are immensely thick, and the legend ascribes its construction to demons. 20 families live in the fort; the others outside. There is a telegraph station here on the Tehran-Meshed line.— {Clerk; Eastwick; Bellew; Goldsmid ; Schindler.)

ARARAT— Elev. Greater 16,916', Lesser 12,840'— {Stebnitzky.) Mount Ararat, divided into the Greater and Lesser Ararat, lies in the extreme north-west of Azarbaijan, and marks the commencement of the Turko-Persian boundary in this quarter, whence it passes 20 miles to the west of lake Urumieh. The Russo-Persian boundary ends at the summit of the Lesser Ararat. It is called by the Armenians Masis Lexn and by the Tartars AgrI Dagh, both Lern and Dagh signify mountain. Its appearance is that of a great isolated double-coned mountain, rising to the skies. Only to the westward is it connected with a rugged mountain chain, and even this chain is separated from the Ararat by a deep inden ture so that nothing practically intervenes to impair the impression created by its superb loveliness. While the sharply peaked cone of the Little Ararat, although 12,840', above the level of the sea is free from snow, the cone of the great AraratARAS 41 is covered with it perennidly. The mountain consists of two cones; the radius at the base of the greater cone being about 14 miles and that at the base of the lesser cone being a little over 9 miles. Both are united up to an elevation of 8,000', at which point the Great and the Little Ararat diverge. The rise is easy during the first half of the ascent; by a mean gradation of less than 10° an altitude of 6,000' above the level of the so is attained. From this elevation the rise is steeper ; and from the slightly curved ridge which separates the two peaks, the Little Ararat ascends in a conical form, with almost mathematical precision at an angle of 45° until it reaches its northern circular summit. This summit forms the common boundary of Russia, Persia, and Turkey. The Gre it Ararat, on the other hand, possesses an irregular formation. Whilst its rise between the elevations of 6,000' and 10,000' amounts to about 30°, declivities of considerable abruptness (up to about 60°) commence from the letter altitude on the west and south sides, and also irregular forms, occasioned by terrace-shaped intermissions, which resolve themselves, 2,000' below the peak, into an ice-field, which rises to the highest summit. To the north and east the rise, although somewhat less steep, is almost as regular as in the case of the Little Ararat. On the north side t an enormous chasm, the sides of which are perpendicul ar, and which are about 4,000' in height at its upper extremity, winds down from the ice-field near the summit to an altitude of 6,000' above the level of tho sea. Here was situated the monastery of St. James, and further down the village of AgrI, both of which within this century have been buried by a fall of the mountain. The other half of this chasm is filled in by a gl acier. The l.ne of perpetual snow begins at an altitude of 13,400'; and the summit, lies concealed beneath a white covering. The ascent of the Ararat h .s been several times accomplished by Parrot, Abich, Stuart, and others, but the reader is referred to Thielmann’s own account of his ascent in 1876 for a further and lucid description of the mountain and its ascent, and to that of Major Stuart in Teller’s “ Crimei ”. They made the ascent in 1856, and set down the elevations as 17,323' and 13,093' respectively for the Greater and the Lesser Ararat. The region is very volcanic; hot springs, mineral waters and other signs of igneous agency are common. Iron, lime and lead are found in t-6 e range. Many Armenian ruins are found scattered about; the most extensive appear to be those of Dambat; near Srngar is a rock-cut building of con siderable size, very neatly chiselled out of the solid limestone°—-(TM- mann ; Telfer; Picot, 1894.) ARAS (OR ARAXES)— The river forming part of the frontier between Persia and Trans-Cau- casian-Russia. It cannot, therefore, be regarded as belonging to Persia It rises in the spurs of the Bindagh mountains south of the Erzerum district of Armenia, and, flow ng in a serpentine with a general easterly direction, after a course of about 500 miles joins the Kur river about 10 miles from the Caspian, into which the combined river flows above the bay of Kizil Agach. It has numerous tributaries both from the north-west and south-east. The principal streams which flow into it from Azar C300GSB ’ - -42 ARAS-ARDA baijan r.re the Sarisu, Makuchai, Zumuzchai, Kuturchai, Anaschai and Kara-urt.

In addition to these there are others of minor importance along various reaches of the river, which are open during the summer and early autumn to men on foot, but in winter and spring the river is rapid and is impossible to cross except at the fords.—• (Thielmann; Picot, 1S91.)

ARDABlL— Lat. 38° 14'; Long. 48° 21'; Elev. 5,000'. A town in Azerbaijan of about 10,000 inhabitants, situated on the left bank of the Karasu, or more accurately on the BaJuksu, a tributary of the Karasu, 100 miles east of Tabriz, 40 miles west of the Caspian Sea. It is situated near the south side of the great plain of Ardbad, which is about 40 miles long by 40 broad, and has an elevation of 5,000 feet. To the west rises the mighty snow peak of the Savalan Dagh and to the east a narrow ridge divides the plain from the Caspian. It is a large straggling place, built from the ruins of a famous city, surrounded by ruinous walls and flanked by towers in a like state of decay. The houses are mean and small, built of mud or sun-dried bricks, with flat roofs. There is a Persian telegraph station in communication with Tabriz ;‘this is the terminal station. The fort is situated 500 yards east-south-east from the town, and was eonstructed according to the European system of fortification. It is 180ARDA—ARDA 43 yards square, built of mud, with ditch, draw-bridge, and glacis. There are no gardens in the vicinity of Ardabil, the strong north-e'/St winds from the Caspian being very prejudicial to certain kinds of vegetation, especially fruit trees. The climate is cold a: d is not considered he Ithy, yet in many localities around, more especially on the banks of the Karasn, abundant crops of rice, wheat, and barley are raised. Ardab 1 is one of the places of pilgrimage enjoined on Muhammadans of the ShJ’ah persuasion on account of hs containing the tombs of Shaikh S'ofi-ud-dln and of his descendant Shah Isma’il, the founder of the Safavian dynasty. The following description of the tomb of Shaikh Safi is from Morier The first approach to the tomb is by the gate at the north-west angle of the town, which leads into a street enclosed by a brick wall on the left side, and by the habitations of the priests attached to the foundation on the right. It then passes through a smaller gateway, faced with slabs of Tabriz marble, which leads into a court filled with tomb-stones, falling into decay. The small cupola which covers the mausoleum of the Shaikh has given way in several places, and has already lost a great number of its varnished tiles, whilst the walls are full of rents and fissures. “ On entering the first large hall, visitors are stopped by a silver grat ing, where they are obliged to take off their shoes. This large hall is beautifully painted and ornamented, and from its ceiling are suspended silver lamps and lanterns, and its floor is covered with carpets. At the furthest end of this hall is the tomb of Shaikh Sufi, and the approach to it is by one high step, which is bounded by a second silver grating, and then a gateway, plated with gold, beyond which visitors .are not permitted to advance. Through this gate the tomb is seen covered with offerings, among which a golden ewer, set with precious stones, is the most conspi cuous, having been presented by Humayf n Shah* “ Close to the tomb of the Shaikh are those of his sons, who commenced these buildings, but they were completed, beautified, and endowed by the great Shah ’Abbas. To the left, in a small dark room, is the tomb of Shah Isma’il, first king of the Safavis. “ From the tombs the visitor is led to a saloon of large dimensions where the fine library given to the shrine by Shah ’Abbas used to be kept. The original endowment of the whole establishment was 18,000 tumdns per annum, which, like the endowments of mosques,, consists in unalien able grants of land, the revenues of which are assigned for the maintenance of the mullas, or priests. The library of Ardabil was carried off by the Russians in 1828, notwithstand ing that the place had surrendered without fighting to Count Sutchelen. The revenue of the town formerly amounted to 14,000 limans per annum, but it is now much less. The trade of Ardabil is unimportant in contrast with former years and is mainly in the hands of Armenians ; principally with Russia through the port of Astara. The imports from thence, chiefly of iron, steel, paper, earthenware, and hardware, are usually packed in painted boxes. The imports from the interior of Persia are mostly in transit for Russia, and amount during the year to about 3,000 Rcrse loads of go 11s,44 ARDANA dried fruit, Persian manufactures and some native cotton twist from Rama dan. Almost all goods from Russia come by way of Astara. The popula tion of the province of Ardabil is said to be classed as follows : 3,000 families for the town, 1,000 for the villages, 5,000 Shahsavans, total 9,000 families. Ardabd is the r.e-t of the Governor of the district and has a garrison of | a battalion, and a regiment of artillery, which however are practically non- existent except on paper. Ardabil has been occupied by Russian troops since 1910, and there are now (1912) regular barracks for them holding between 1,500 and 2,000. In July 1912 during the Shahsavan revolt only a small garrison was left at Ardabil, and this, for security, moved into the citadel, much to the annoyance of the Persians. For risings of the Shahsavans see under “ Shahsavans.” The plain of Ardabil is situated high, and the fruits common to the warmer parts of Persia are not produced here, although apples, pears and cherries are in abundance. The climate is cold and herd thy.— (Fraser; Morier? Holmes; Shell; Imperial Gazetteer! Monteith; Stuart; Thielmmm.) ARDAHlL (ARDAHAR ok VARARDAHAR)— The most southern district of the (Qum) Kum province, 42 miles duo south of Kum. It comprises the following villages, Mashad-i-Qali (q.v.) Khaveh, 40 houses ; Armak, 200 houses ; Joshak, 50 houses ; Shanek, 50 houses ; Sinngan, 50 houses ; Kulijar, 40 houses ; Kermaheh or Chtrma- heb, 50 houses. The above villages are situated in a fertile valley, surrounded by high hills, having a mean elevation of 6,200 feet. The valley has a length of about 10 miles and a width of 2 to 2| miles. Its general direction is north-west to south-east and it is in consequence exposed to prevailing cold north-west winds and has a severe winter. The water-supply is from a stream flowing down the valley, which joins the Barzuk river a few miles below Ardahal. There is much game in the surrounding hills.— (Schindler.) ARDAKAN— Elev. 3,537 / — (Schindler) ; 3,639 / — Indo-European Telegraph Inspector. This considerable town is situated some thirty-five miles north-west of Yazd and on the most frequented caravan-route to Kashan. It lies in a hollow, with its three villages of Sharifabad, Turkabad end Ahm ,dabad ; the population is said to be 15,000 inhabitants for the town, 400 for Sharifabad (half of whom are Parsees) and 1,000 for each of the other villages, making a total of 17,400. This struck me as excessive, but was given by the best local authorities. There are 37 kan ts, 3 only of which are sweet, viz.

A town in Mazandaran, about 5 miles from the Caspian. The port is Bandar Gaz. The inhabitants of Ashraf are of mixed race ; they are descend ants of a Georgian colony brought from the Caucasus by Shah ’Abbas, Safavl; some families of Talish, a Turk tribe from the coast near Lanku- ran; Tats, a Persian tribe, and a few houses of Gudars, a peculiar race, whose origin is very obscure. The last are the pariah caste of Mazand aran, having a status and occupation similar to those of the aboriginal tribes of India, the Khols, Bhils, and Dhers. They are village watchmen, hunters, fishermen, and, though nomin lly Mussulmans, live m mly on the flesh of wild swine. In summer they wander in the forests, when not C300GSB50 ASHR—ASIA employed in watching the distant fields; in winter a small thatched cabin on the outskirts of some village shelters them and their families. They rarely marry Persian women, but their women, if pretty, are occasionally taken by Persians. From their appearance and costume there can be but litle doubt of their Indian origin. Captain Napier was unable to trace any traditions amongst them of their origin. They speak the Mazandarani dialect. From its situation Ashraf should be unhealthy; it is enclosed in a hollow of the mountains formed by a projecting spur on which stands the castle of Safiabad. Fever, however, is not more prevalent than in the other towns of the province. Cholera appears frequently, and is much dreaded. During the last thirty years the town has experienced a revival, owing to trade which has sprung up with Russia. The famous garden of the Chehil Situn (forty pillars), constructed by Shah ’Abbas at the close of the sixteenth century is now entirely neglect ed, the building, fountains, and raised stone terraces being in ruins. Its natural beauties are perhaps unequalled. The building of the place and the laying out of the gardens by ’Abbas I. was begun in 1612, and completed in 1627, it was destroyed by Afghans in 1723, rebuilt by Nadir Shah in 1731, but was again in ruins in 1743. It is backed by lofty wooded spurs ; to the north is a fine view over the blue bay of Ashurada. Several springs rising under the hill-slope flow through it. The Cyprus trees are of gigantic growth, and several of them are covered with massive wreaths of wild vine, orange and citron trees grow in wild luxuriance; their fruit is left to fall and literally covers the ground, as every h &gt;use in the town is provided with its own gardens or groups of orange trees. The old palace of Safiabad built by Shah Safi (1628-1642) for one of his daughters, has been replaced by a new building in the European style, with fine rooms. It is decorated outside without taste in the Persian style, but commands a fine view of the bay and plain. It is already, even before completion, falling to ruin. Though now of little note, Ashraf should, some day, be the centre of one of the most important agricultural districts in Persia. There is a Persian Govern ment telegraph oifice here.— (Khanikoff; Pushchin; Napier; Schindler, 1910.) ’ASHRAIN— A village of 15 houses, 14J miles west of Kazvln on the road to Zinjan via Girishkin.— (Schindler .)

A village about 50 miles south of Amul, in Mazandaran, and north-east of Tehran, on the right bank of the Harhaz river. It is the capital of the mountain chiefship of Larijan, is said to contain about 900 houses and 1,500 to 2,500 inhabitants, and is the chief of 72 villages. It is an extraordinary place, situated on one side of a great mountain, and, excepting where the river Harhaz has formed an opening, surrounded by other immense moun tains, pre-eminent among which is the hoary Damavand. D’Arcy Todd tays of its situation :—“ Its position is remarkable. The Harhaz runs below the town through a deep and narrow channel of rock, crossed by a wooden bridge. From the water’s edge the town is built on natural steps rising to the height of several hundred feet upon the south-east side of Damavand, which forms one of the natural impassable bariers of the place. A chain of lofty mountains shuts in the valley on every side, the only ingress and egress to which is at the points, where the river enters and leaves the narrow basin on the south side of which Ask is situated.” Although the village boasts a governor, it is almost deserted in the winter, its inhabitants mostly coming from Amul for the summer. The sulphur bath here is much resorted to by patients suffering from rheumatism. The pervading stench of sulphuretted hydrogen is at first insupportable, and travellers are recommended to avoid Ask and camp at Rahna, especially as Ask has no good camping-ground.— (Skeil; Stuart; D’Arcy Todd; Holmes ; Na'pier ; Stack Lovett.)

ASLEH— A village of 120 houses in the Darjazln district, 41 miles north-east of Hamadan.— {Schindler.)52 ASLA—ASSA ABLANDOZ— A village in Azarbaijan, just below the junction of the Karasu and Ar vs. It is a collection of huts made of reeds and mats, tenanted by a few miserable nomads. Here is an artificial hill in the shape of a cone which has been fortified by the Persians to defend the adjacent fords of the Aras, which are very practicable. Here the. Persian force under ’Abbas Mirza was encamped in the war of 1828, when a Russian detachment under General Ku itlerov'ki surprised it, and inflicted an immense loss, including 12 guns. Major Christie, an English officer of the Pers an army, refusing to desert his men, was killed after a most desperate resistance, and not withst ml.ng the generous efforts of the Russian General to spare him. A good description of this battle is given in R. G. Watson’s History of Persia, London, 1866. Christie was an officer of the Bombay Army and came to Persia w.th Sir John Malcolm in 1810. The| ford here is of some importance, and has been repeatedly used by troops operating in this direction, notably so by Prince Madatoff, who crossed on February 28th, 1828, with a body of Russian troops, and carried dismay into the Persian territory as far as Mishkin.— {Monteith; Morier.)

ASSASSINS —(Derived from Hashshdshin “ Eaters of Hash'sh”) The name of a military and religious order, formed in Persia bv a sect of Muhammadans in the ninth century, who, in process of time, obtained possession of ten or twelve cities, and chose a leader or king to whom they gave the name of the ‘ Old man of the Mountain,’ who resided in the hill- fort of Alah-amat north of Kazvln and surrounded himself with a devoted bind, dressed in a peculiar manner and armed with sharp daggers, who paid the most implicit deference to his commands, esteemed°assassina- tion meritorious when sanctioned by his mandate, believing that the highest joys of paradise awiited them should their lives be sacrificed in his service. Secret assassination, aga nst which no precaution could prevail, was the tremendous instrument of his vengeance. The greatest monarchs stood in awe of him, for his was a power which they could not &lt;mard against, and many princes fell under the daggers of their own followers assassins who had succeeded in getting into their service for the purpose of destroying them. About the middle of the thirteenth century, howeverASIA—ASIA 53 the assassins were themselves almost exterminated by the great Mongol conqueror Hulagii Khan, their haunts all taken one after another and their inmates massacred without distinction. They existed, however, in parts of Gilan up to about A. D.|1400 .—(Imperial Gazetteer; Rabino.) AS TALIK— Lat. 35° • Long. 51° 46' 45' Lemm corrected by St. John.)

There are Post, and Telegraph Offices, a Customs house, a naptha oil reservoir and a fishery station at Astara. There is a Russian Consular officer. The fishery station belongs to Messrs. Leonozoff. Persian Astara is separated from Russian Astara by the small river Astarachai which is here about 40 yards wide. The fiver is unfordable and is crossed by a wooden bridge which is passable by horses and foot passengers, and by carriages. It was built in 1905 on the occasion of the Shah’s visit to Europe and has since been thoroughly repaired. There is a Russian guard at one end of the bridge and a Persian guard at the other. There is no wharf or other landing facility at Russian or Persian Astara. Russian Astara has ten boats, some 15 yards long able to carry 20 men. Persian Astara has 20 such boats. There are also 40 fishing boats, the property of the Leonozoff fishery station belonging to the port. Astara is the port foi goods and passengers to and from Ardabil. Russian Astara has 100 Frontier Guards. In March 1911 a Russian detachment bombarded Astara on account of disturbances there. By the Turkmaijchai treaty the Russo-Persian frontier was made to run from the mouth of Astara up that river to the Jiku heights. A railway has been proposed since 1880 from Baku to Astara. There are a multitude of rivers, streams, and brooks in the neighbour hood of Astara, which produce excellent fish, including salmon. The staple article of food consists of rice, which is of excellent quality. There is a large54 ASIA—AVAM export trade in caviare and dried fruits.

It is well wooded principally with oak, and galls are exported. Much wild celery grows in the district and the pickles which are locally made of it are a delicacy. It also produces pomegranates, figs, gall-nuts, and other forest fruits. Wheat and barley and other provisions are imported. The climate is warm, and the pomegranate thrives well. The inhabitants are wild and unruly, and, as troops with artillery cannot reach the district on account of the difficult roads leading to it, they rarely pay any taxes and are practically independent. Farhad Mirza, Mu’tamad-ud-Dauleh, brought them to reason in 1871, but since then the Chiefs have again ceased to pay taxes.— (Schindler, 1902; Rabino, 1917.) AVUGLO—Elev. 2,750'. A large village in Azarbaljan of 500 houses, the property of the Wall ’Ahd. Roads converge here to Maraud, Khol, Julfa, Marakand and Karaziadin. Many of the inhabitants are supposed to be Bahis though Bahls deny it. From Av glu the road passes over a waterless salt tract to the watershed overlooking the Aras valley : this plateau is called Yakain, also the Khar Dasht. The village lies on the left bank of the Qutur Chai, which here flows in a broad bed, 120 yards wide between low banks. The water had a breadth of 30 feet, depth 6 inches, in November.— (Picot, 1891,) AWAJIK or AVAJIK— Elev. 5,900'. The name given to a plateau in north-west Azarbaijan, situated west of Maku where the Awajikchal, one of the branches of the Maku and Zangmar river, takes its rise. The plateau stands at an elevation of 5,900 feet and covers an area of about 1'4 by 8 miles. It is enclosed on all sides by high mountains. Its 35 villages, of which Kal'sa Kandi is the most important, are peopled by a tribe of Turks who originally came from the direction of Kars and settled in Awajik some 70 years ago. They apparently displaced the Arme va .s, the remains of whose large villages and churches lie scattered throughout the valley. The present chief, the first in successionAYAG-AZAN 57 from Khalifa Quli Khan, the founder of the family, now rules by hered itary right. The people are hardy and fairly well-off. They raise good crops of wheat and barley, and possess a fair number of sheep and horses. During the summer the higher slopes of the mountains afford excellent grazing for the sheep and cattle of the Jalali Kurds, who migrate here from Maku and Agra Dagh. The climate in winter is severe, but not such as to stop the camel and mule caravan traffic from Trebizond. Fair supplies are to be had and during ordinary seasons a surplus of grain is exported to Bayazid or to Russia. The chief is responsible for such part of the road as passes through his territory, and 100 horsemen are maintained for this purpose. From Awajik the road runs southwards, over a pass 6,800 feet, into Chaldaran. The road from Maku is very difficult and mountainous. Awajik is interesting from an antiquarian point of view : Armenian relics are constantly unearthed.— (Picot, 1S94.) AYAGHLl— A small village in the Anguran sub-district of Khamseh, 45 miles from Zinjan.— {Schindler.) AYl— Lat. 36° 54'. Long. 48° 54'.. A village in the Khamseh district, 22 miles north-east of Zinjan. It is very pleasantly situated in the vale of Tarum, and possesses a garden house, which was built by a late governor of the province. ’AISHABAD— A village in Yazd, about 3 miles south of Yazd. It is situated on the verge of an utterly sterile plain, but is itself surrounded by gardens.— {K. Abbott.) AZ— A hamlet in Mazandaran, 7| miles from Sari, on the road to Barfarush.— {Holmes.)

C300GSB58 azarbATjan AZARBAl JAN—Between Lat. 36° 50' and 39° ; Long. 44° O' and 48° 50'. History, See Tabriz, Geography. Azarbaijan is one of tbe great divisions of Persia and stretches across the , . north-west of the country. Commencing at its south-west corner, its boundaries may be defined as follows :—That on the west is formed by the Zagros range, dividing the province from Turkish Kurdistan and Armenia up to the summit of the Lesser Ararat on the north-west. The line dividing the province from Trans- Caucasian Russia then follows the Araxes or Aras, the course of which river it follows up to ’Abbasabad. It passes at a distance of 2| miles outside this village ; then rejoining the Araxes, follows its course to a point, 14 miles below the Yadi Bulagh ford. Its eastern boundary here commences in a line crossing the Mughan plain to a point on the Bolgarchai, which it ascends to its confluence with the Adina Bazar Chai. This river it follows to its source under the height of Jiku; thence it runs along the ridge of mountains to Aqdagh, dividing it from Talish and Gllan. From this hill the southern boundary runs in a curve below Mlaneh and Sain Kaleh to a point above Sardasht, dividing the province from the districts of Khamseh and Kurdistan. Its greatest length is 270 miles from east to west, and its greatest breadth 250 miles from north to south. Chesney says its area is 25,285 square miles. The province of Azarbaijan is generally mountainous, intermingled with fertile valleys, undulating plateaux, and some mountains of great height. The mountain system of Azarbaijan all emanates from the mountains of Kurdistan and, with the exception of the short spurs which run down from that range in the west of the province to the Urumleh lake, it consists of one range which meanders through the whole province. This has its origin in Mount Akronal (?) in about Lat. 38° 20' Long. 44° 35'; from thence it goes due east dividing the drainage of Kohl from that of Sal-maso, apparently under the name of the Kuh Ma’shuq (pronounced Maishan), and running south of Maraud, draining north to the Aras and south to the AjI Chai; to the north-east of Tabriz it takes the name of Kosha Dagh, shortly before which it throws a spur to the north called ShahvardI Kuh (which runs parallel with the Ahar Chai branch of the Karasu river and ends south of the bridge of Khudafarln over the Aras). The Kosha Dagh still continues east dividing the drainage of the Karasu from that of the AjI Chai to the Savalan Dagh. At this point the ridge turns due south still dividing the Karasu (which flows round from the south of the Savalan) to the north from the AjI Chai, till, in about Lat. 37° 50' it splits into two main ranges, one going east the other west. The former maintains its east direction till Long. 48° 35', when it also divides : one branch, the Bagru Kuh, runs northward and divides Tallsh from Azarbaijan, while the other, the Masuleh mountains, runs south to the Kizil Uzun River and divides Gllan from Azarbaijan. The second main range, mentioned above, goes westward under the name of the Buzgush to the Sahand mountains. Here it turnAZARBAIJAN 59 due south (draining on the west to the Jaghatu river and on the east to the tributaries of the Kizil Uzun) as far as the latit .de of Mianduab, when it gives a short turn east and then resuming its southeasterly course leaves the province of Azarbaijan. The principal peaks of this range, which may with justice be termed the Azarbaijan range, are those of the Savalan Dagh, which reach a height of 12,000 to 13,000 feet, and of Sahand, rising to 11,600 feet. There are no data to show what the average height of the main ridge is. The plain country of Azarbaijan merely consists of the valleys of the various rivers, which always have on their banks some level ground of .greater or less breadth. On the right bank of the Aras there are some extensive plains as that of'Mughan and there are besides the plains of Ujan Tabriz and Urumieh. The rivers of this province are the Aras on the north with its tributary, the Karasu, which receives the north dainage of the Kuh Ma’shuq, Kosha Dagh and Savalan Dagh ; the Kizil Uzun on the east with its tributaries, the Qarangu and Aidughmish, which collect all the water of the Buzgush and Sahand mountains; the Jaghatu, which drains from the Kurdistan range to lake Urumieh, and, finally, the smaller streams of the Aji Chai, of the Dilman river, and of Urumieh. The only lake in .the province of any importance is that of Urumieh or Shahi, described elsewhere. The valleys of Azarbaijan are alluvial slopes formed by torrents. Forests are numerous and extensive, and part of the province, as for instance the basin of Urumieh, is extremely fertile. As they recede from the east and north the intervals between the ridges are wider, and the rainfall smaller, till grassy slopes are replaced by gravelly forests and shifty sands with occasional patches of green oasis. The pasture lands are extensive and valuable, comprising as they do the slopes of nearly all the mountains and many fine plains besides. The villages are, for the most part, embosomed in orchards and gardens but it cannot as a whole be considered a great timber or fuel producing province. The climate of Azarbaijan is described as warm in summer and very severe in winter but healthy. The spring is temperate .and delightful, as is the autumn on the plains ; but on the mountains it is always cold, though in summer the sun is hot. The winter lasts long and, in the moun tains, snow lies for seven and eight months in the year. Mr. Campbell, who spent a winter in the country, described the climate as follows :— “ On the 20th October, he says, wn had a heavy fall of snow which covered all the surrounding country, but it did not remain long on • the ground, for the weather again became mild, and we had no excessive cold till the middle of December, from which period till the end of January the thermometet when exposed to the air at night never rose above zero, and in our rooms at midday seldom reached higher than 18°. January was by far the coldest month. The water became almost instantaneously solid in the tumbler on the dining table. .The ink was constantly frozen in our inkstands although the tables were quite close to the fire. For at least a fortnight not an egg was to be had, all being split by the cold*€0 - AZ ARB AI JAN I Some bottles of wine froze although covered with straw and many of the copper ewers were split by the expansion of the water when frozen in them. Towards the end of February the weather became comparatively mild but on the 1st of May we had a fall of snow and such cold weather that it destroyed all the vegetation. Afterwards the weather became very warm, and they began to cut their corn on the the 15th July. The winter in Azarbaljan is all the more severely felt from the almost total want of fuel, the only substitute for which is dried cowdung mixed with straw.” The following summary of meteorological observations, for the years 1890, 1891,1893, 1894 , will give a good idea of the climatic conditions obtaining :— Climatic averages taken from the, years 1S90 — 94.

The climate is generally dry, rigorous and healthy. Fever is rare except in some few low and swampy valleys, such, for instance, as Khoi; and those, who survive the early years of their existence grow up strong and healthy. The mortality amongst the children is very high, 60 to 70 per cent, being the ordinary loss. The carelessness and ignorance of the people rather than the climate are probably responsible for this excessive death-rate. The following notes on specific forms of disease were obtained from Dr. Adcock of Tabriz. All forms of zymotic diseases are common, and diseases of the eyes (ophthalmia and its consequences) perhaps occur more frequently thanAZARBAIJAN 61 any other, especially among the young of both sexes. Stone in the bladder is also frequent at all ages, especially among the males. In the towns the men suffer most from indigestion, and the results of sexual abuses and excesses. Heart disease is common. Lung diseases are not particularly common, except during winter. Tuberculosis is certainly less common than in Europe. The women suffer greatly from accidents of child-birth, and the mal-practices of mammas or mid-wives ; all are almost universally hysterical. Hysteria in one or other of its Protean forms can nearly always be discovered. Headache is the most general malady complained of and is most probably due to their sedentary existence, and the abuse of the kalian. They also suffer greatly from constipation and its attendant evils. The custom of early marriage has also a most detrimental effect, and numbers of poor girls are completely ruined during the first year of marriage. In the country the men are decidedly more healthy and robust, their principal ailment being rheumatism, due to exposure and damp houses. In feverish districts they naturally suffer from ague, but this is not common except in the Kara Dagh. The women, as a rule, are strong and healthy; they work very hard and suffer much in the same way and of the same complaints as the men, with the exception of the diseases consequent upon child-birth and lactation. Diseases of the eye are frightfully common among all classes, and skin diseases of the scalp are nearly universal. Vaccination and inoculation are commonly practised ; inoculation being most usual, especially outside the towns. Population. The inhabitants are, mainly, Turks, Kurds, and Armenians. Turks. —The Turks are greatly in the ascendant, and are gradually pushing out the Armenians, and in a lesser degree the Kurds. They be long to the same race as the Turks on the north side of the Aras (now Russian subjects), who occupy the valley from Julfa to Erivan, with whom they are closely connected by history and marriage. They have taken the place of those Armenians who previously peopled the country from Julfa and Khoi to Mount Ararat, and will probably in course of time either deprive the Kurds of their cultivable lands, or oblige them to settle down as cul tivators of the soil. They are a hardy, brave race, and whether looked upon as soldiers, of whom they furnish the most courageous, or as peasants, pure and simple, they are among the best of Persian subjects. Mentally they are not advanced, and offer a marked contrast to the Armenians, with whom they are brought in contact. They are bigoted and easily led by their spiritual guides, but socially a pleasant, if stupid people, easy to deal with and manageable. On the western border they come into collision with the Kurds, against whom they are fairly well able to hold their own. As a rule, they are poor, the exactions of their rulers preventing the attainment of any degree of comfort, notwithstanding their possession of rich soil, which enables them to raise fine crops of wheat, barley, rice, and cotton. ’ Owing to scarcity of timber, their dwelling places are miserable and their villages wretched in appearance. A trait to be remarked upon is the change visible in their attitude of mind. The happy philosophy, in which they have62 AZARBAIJAN hitherto rested, viz., that what was good enough for their fathers was good enough for them, is now giving place to a new energy of feeling. They see their brethren on the north side of the Aras living in greater ease and comfort, and comparisons have not taken long to ascribe this to a better administration. Kurds .—The north-west frontier is occupied by a comparatively small num ber of Kurds, but as they form an important factor in its social life, some account of them is necessary. They operate over the country west of a line drawn between Marand and Julia, and extend from the Aras on the north to near Kh5i on the south. They are divided into four tribes—the Jalalis, the Milan, the Haidaranlus, and the Burkleh, accounts of which will be found under their respective headings. These people depend almost entirely for existence on their herds of sheep and goats, the products of which they exchange for various foods, chiefly wheat, raised by the Turkish or Armenian peasant. Milk in various forms is the staple article of food, eked out by a little flour and mutton (the latter only on festive occasions). Their dress consists of a tunic of cotton, open at the throat, rough cotton breeches and felt bands for the legs, boots of untanned hide. In winter they wear an extra garment, a large felt waistcoat without arms. In summer they live in open tents, made of long strips of woollen stuffs, woven by the women. In the winter, in the more desolate regions of Maku and under Mount AgrI Dagh (Ararat), they dig under-ground holes to the depth of some 10 feet. The largest is generally reserved for the family, the smaller ones for the cattle. The poorer families live in extreme wretchedness, their underground dwellings being small, badly roofed with brushwood and not impervious to rain or snow. On the Aras and in Kara Aineh the Kurds live side by side with the Turks, and are a little better off than their fellows of the underground dwellings. All alike suffer from the want of fuel, the country producing no timber, and few woody shrubs. Dung is carefully stored for winter use, and is practically the only fuel. The average Kurd owns but few sheep, 50 or 60 being a liberal number for one family. A few horses are also raised ; each tent may possess one or more. The large flocks of sheep and small herds of horses seen in the mountains belong to the chiefs, not the tribesmen, and the greater number in the Maku territory belong to 14 or 15 of the Khans. The valuables of Kurds consist of his tent, horse, a few sheep, rifle and cartridges, the wedding garments and ornaments of his wife, and perhaps a few rugs. They make a few carpets and derive little profit therefrom. As a people they are to be admired for their endurance, and may be for their physical courage. They are cunning and treacherous, without the redeeming quality of hospitality. They number in all about 350,000 souls. Armenians .—The Armenians are now thinly scattered in the north west corner of Persia. They are found in the city and immediate neigh bourhood of Khoi, where they number about 500 families, and again are met with along the Aras and in the Ararat district. Once they thickly peopled the whole country from Tabriz to Ararat, and the valley of the Aras was more especially the scene of their ancient history and glories. Commencing with Julfa on the east and travelling westwardsAZARBAIJAN 63 along the Aras many ruins and remains are met with. At Daniel, 12 miles west of Julfa, is an exquisite old church, surrounded by high fort ified walls. A Khalifa presides over the church, which is held in great reverence by all Armenians, and is annually visited by many pilgrims from Kussia and Persia. Along the whole length of the Darreh Sham valley are to be found ruined villages and churches of cut limestone. At Kizil Wang on the Russian side, a church of the same exquisite design as that of Daniel towers above the site of a large Armenian village now occupied by Muhammadans. At ’Abbasabad are similar ruins and the remains of a stone embankment. Towards Karghulak are the stone-cut foundations of a well laid-out city, whose walls yet stand a foot above ground. In the Ararat district the ruins of city, church and graveyard are frequently met with. At Dambat on the south slope of Mount Ararat, the site of a large town with the vestiges of aqueducts and other civilised works is now occupied by an encampment of Jalali Kurds. On the cliffs of Maku high up and out of reach, several large crosses are cut in the face of the rock, the largest carved with inscriptions in the old Armenian character of Ourjistan. South of Maku is an old church, called Kara Kalisa, or the black church, so known because it was originally constructed of a dark, almost black limestone. Inscriptions show that the church dates back 1,280 years. ’Abbas Mirza, Naib-us-Saltaneh, raised a modern struc ture, equally beautiful, of light limestone, to replace the greater part of the old church which had fallen to pieces. Westward again in Awajik the chief village of the district is Kalisa Kandi, the village of the church, near which is a grand and massive Armenian ruin. Now the Armenian is re presented over all this area by a few miserable villages. As regards their status they seem to occupy a position analogous to that of the Hindus of Afghanistan and the north-west border of India, with this difference that in Persia they are protected by the more powerful families, as a com munity at large, instead of as in Afghanistan as individuals. They complain bitterly of oppression from Kurds and Turks, but apparently without just cause. As regards numbers, the following table furnished by well-known Armenians may be taken as approximate :— Tabriz, 900 houses, 6 inmates each .. .. 5,400 Villages, Mujambar, Sohrul and Alchamnak .. 700 Karadagh, 3,600 houses, 6 inmates each .. 21,600 Urumleh and Salmas, 1,800 houses, 6 inmates each 10,800 Khol and Maku, 620 houses, 6 inmates each .. 3,720 Maragheh, Mlandat, Sauj Bulagh, Sulduz .. 1,200 Total .. 43,420 The popular language of Azarbaljan is Turki, not Persian. In addition to the above there are some 4,000 Nestorian Christians, Resources. -The principal towns of Azarbaljan are Tabriz, the capital, Ardabll &gt; Marand, Khol, Sarab, Dilman, Urumleh, Nakhudeh, Ushnu, Sauj Bulagh Dehkharqan, Bunab, and Maragheh.64 AZARBAIJAN The agricultural produce of this province consists of wheat, barley, opium, maize, rye, flax, hemp, madder, fruit, cotton, tobacco, and grapes. In corn its resources are said to be practically unlimited. The amount of revenue paid in kind annually is as much as 60,000 to 70,000 kharwc.rs and large amounts are annually exported to supply the deficiency of other districts. There are large herds of sheep and goats and a considerable quantity of wool is produced, as well as wax and honey. There are reported to be large numbers of cattle, mules, horses, and camels. The mineral productions of Azarbaijan are abundant and valuable. Iron, lead and copper exist in abundance and have been frequently, if unmethodically, worked. The richest district is that of Kara Dagh in the north-east, where iron and copper mines have been recently worked both by natives and Europeans. Lead, copper and saltpetre have been produced from the Khalkhal region, coal from a spot 4 miles north-east of Tabriz. In the adjoining Khamseh district are deposits of copper, lead, coal, and mercury. At Maragheh is found a beautiful transparent white marble which is much prized in Persia, being used for paving baths and palaces, and in thin plates as windows. Trade .—The trade of Azarbaijan is considerable and would be even greater than it is, had not new avenues of approach been opened up to Tehran. In former years there were only two main trade arteries into north* west and west Persia : (a) through Turkish territory via Trebizond, (b) through Russian territory from the Caucasus, The main line of approach for imports from Russia to the capital and the west generally is no longer through Azarbaijan, but across the Cas pian and from its southern ports to Tehran. The opening up of the Persian Gulf ports has also decreased the trade of the province by offering other routes for goods to come in by, so that merchandise intended for the west generally, instead of coming through Turkish territory via Trebizond as before, is now transhipped from ocean-going steamers to river steamers at Busreh, which take it to Bagh dad, whence it goes by caravan to Tehran via Khaniqin, Kirmanshah and Hamadan. The imports into Persia from Trebizond doubtless owing to the open- ing up of this route, sunk from £ 577,200 in 1896 to £ 405,280 in 1900. In spite of all the new routes opened up, the trade returns furnished by Mr. Consul-General Wood for 1900-1901 shew a marked improvement on former years. This, however, may be owing to the improved custom service which is now under Belgian supervision and not farmed out, and it is quite possible that had the same system prevailed in 1887-89 that the figures given below, published by Lord Curzon in 1892 might have been very different. 1887. 1888. 1889. Importa £910,108 £664,196 £853,891 Ex P ° rt3 £573,035 £413,694 £389,456AZARBAIJAN 65 At this time England held a scarcely disputed command of the cotton market, the value of her exports to Persia in this line being £393,200 in 1888 and £501,830 in 1889. The figures given by Mr. Consul-General Wood are as follows 1899-1900 1900-1901 Imports .. .. £723,174 £1,204,069 Exports .. .. £316,304 £ 649,415 This almost incredible increase is attributed by Mr. Wood to the sweep ing away of the abuses existing in the time of the farmer of customs. From Mr. Wood’s report it appears that in spite of the cheaper rate at which Russian merchants can sell their cotton goods (owing to the 30 per cent., or more, drawback granted them), British firms are still holding their own in this line. This is not the case now (1912). As regards imports generally, Russia is now first on the list, Germany, whose imports during 1911-12 increased by £ 41,202, second, and'Great Britain third. The imports of the United King dom and India were respectively £ 41,480 and £28,897 less in 1911-12 than in the previous year. The falling off in imports from India was due to the competition of Russian tea. Chief articles of export.—Carpets, dried fruits of all sorts, gum, wax, hides and leather of all sorts, and raw cotton. Chief imports.—Tea, hardware of all sorts, textiles of all sorts, manu factured tobacco, sugar, stationery, iron, petroleum, flour and matches. Commercial. —The following European firms were engaged in business in Azarbaijan in 1894, their operations being carried out from Tabriz: Ziegler, an English firm. Castelli, an Italian firm. Stevens, an English firm. The Imperial bank of Persia is a British institution under a Royal Charter. Besides, these, many Persians and Armenians deal direct with Con stantinople, England and Russia. Their operations are individually limited, but in the aggregate they do a considerable amount of business in competition with the English fir ms . Ziegler deals in prints, Manchester cottons, silk tissues, gold and silvet thread, gold laces, handkerchiefs, chargats.} Castelli confines himself almost entirely to banking and imports silvei from London via Russia to Persia. Stevens deals in woollen goods, gold and silver laces, silks and com mission business. The Persians and Armenians trade in the above articles of import. Owing to the opening up of the Bushire route by English firms, the im ports by Trebizond have fallen off by 60 per cent, and whereas Ziegler, ten years ago, imported 6,000 or 7,000 packages, chiefly prints representing on an average £20 per package, the firm now imports from 1,500 to 2,000 packages, and is turning its attention to the southern line of trade. Castelli previously imported 400 to 500 packages, representing value of £15,000. This firm now imports little or nothing. Stevens previously imported 400 to 500 packages of woollen goods, now they bring in from 200 to 250, valued at £10,000. Their silk tissues C300GSBAZARBAIJAN 66 amounted to 30 cases, valued at £2,500 a case, but they have been obliged to give up this import entirely, as now the goods can only be sold at a loss instead of at a profit of 30 or 40 per cent. As a set off against this, Indian teas have supplanted Russian. From 1910 to 1912, the figures for the import of tea from Russia and India respectively were as follows :— — 1910-11. 1911-12. £ £ Russia 930 42,397 India 106,£82 77,367 Russia, however, competes in the import of cottons and inferior cloths Russian imports. an . d mono P olizes ‘Jf trade in sugar and pet- roleum. Her cottons reach Tabriz, Kh 5 i and Urumieh by the Julfa and Shah Takht roads, and trade has been steadily increasing for the last five years, and had, as early as 1902, obtained a footing in Azarbaijan as far south as Urumieh. The great advantage of Russia lies in the nearness of her manufacturing centres, and the encourage ment given to her trade by drawbacks. In the north-west (in Maku) the imports are free of custom duties. The chief has always had the right of free import and so his people are supplied more cheaply than the rest of the country. English goods, except those Russia cannot manufacture, such as superior woollens, have no field whatever in Maku, Awajik and Kara Aineh ; these two latter places do not come directly under the Maku cus tom rules, but benefit indirectly. Russian trade has been encouraged to find an outlet in Persia by a system of drawbacks, a certain percentage being allowed to the importer when the goods cross the frontier. Russian goods have one great advantage over English in that good dyes are the rule not the exception. In the export trade little is done by the European firms, except in car pets, of which Ziegler &amp; Co. are the chief exporters. The trade in Sultan- abad carpets is on the increase. A very large export is done with Russia in raisins, almonds, dried fruits, plums, and cotton by Persian and Armenian merchants. The export of cotton is not very great, but Russia has considerably encouraged the culture and improved the quality by inducing the peasant to grow Ameri can seed, though, owing to the extra labour and care it demands, it has not as yet found much favour with the cultivator. The total export does not exceed 30,000 pounds, though this only represents a part of the out turn, for much is locally consumed in the manufacture of inferior goods for the nomads. Military. The inhabitants of AzarbaTjan are reported to be a “ bold, hardy race and ehow a great aptitude for the military profession.” In 1911, however,AZARBAIJAN 67 ho opposition was offered to the entry of Russian troops into the Province. Rawlinson and Shiel maintain that 20,000 cavalry could be raised in Azar- baijan, equal if not superior to the Persian Cossacks, and also 60,000 infantry. The chief of Maku is said to dispose of an irregular body of foot and horse numbering 7,000 men, all well armed with breech-loaders and fairly well sup plied Ten days’ warning would be sufficient in all probability to collect a body of 5,000 men. In October 1910 the chief of Maku attacked the Tur kish barracks at Bulagh Bashi, on the grounds that the locality belonged to Persia, but he was unsuccessful. He is entirely under the influence of the Russians, who supply him with ammunition. The Shahsavans (fp v.) are a powerful tribe, and having been more or less constantly fighting since 1910 till to-day (1912) against both Persian and Russian troops, ought to be experienced fighters. They number about 15,000. The Kurdistan tribes are a source of weakness to the Persians, as they are without cohesion, independent and ill-disciplined. A vast amount of intrigue has been carried on among them during 1911-12 on the part of the three rival nations Russia, Turkey, and Persia. They number (in Persia) abut 15,000. The Karadaghis might possibly muster 10,000 horsemen. __ Of regular troops Persia possess a very few in Azaroaijan (1J12). Shuja- ud-Dauleh being a strong ruler was able to keep together a fairly strong force, but out of this he could not spare more than about 1,000 men, to operate against the revolted Shahsavans in 1912. The majority of the ‘‘Fidaies,” who had fought against the Royalist troops, were disarmed when the Russians occupied Tabr z in December 1911. . , In July 1912 Russia obtained the consent of Persia to raise a force o^ 700 Cossacks in Tabriz, as part of the Persian Cossack Brigade, whose headquarters and main body were at Tehran. Administration. Azarbaiian is governed bv a Governor-General, in former days usually the Heir Apparent, who has his seat of government at Tabriz. In 1910 the administrative Divisions of Azarbaijan were Tabriz. Bunab. Ahar. _ Sarab. Urumieh. Mianduab. Ardabil. Mianeh. Dilman. Saujbulagh. Mishkin. Samkaleh. Maku. Dehkharqan. As tar a. Khoi. Maragheh. Marand. Khalkhal. The Government districts are controlled by Governors (Hakims), the groups of villages by Deputies (Naib-ul-Hukuma). These posts are held, as a rule for one year and are sold by the Governor-General to the highest bidder who in his turn, parcels out the districts, and sublets to minor officials, who likewise are changed every year. Finance. qq ie successful purchaser is, on leaving the capital given a memorandum setting forth the revenue of the district, the amount to be collected, the local expenses, and the balance to be re mitted to the central authorities. No mention is made of the purchase money. The local expenses are mainly— Army expenditure, buildings, repairs.68 AZARBAIJAN Any special remittances of taxation. Salaries of officials, who, though not directly concerned with the dis^ trict, draw their incomes from it. Pensions. The taxation may be classed as direct and indirect. The direct is that Taxation. levied on the land and forms the main por tion of the revenue. The indirect is derived from customs duties, road taxes (Rahdari), octroi, special guild taxes, tribal taxes, passports. In the first case the proprietor is responsible for the taxes, in the latter the kadkhuda or headman. The tax is roughly estimated on the cul tivated lands, sometimes on the water-supply, or again on cattle and heads (poll-tax); no regular system exists, local circumstances, customs, ancient rights, being among the minor factors influencing the question. The valuations are made by Mlrzas or Secretaries, men with no other qualifications, except those of writing and being able to keep accounts. They proceed to the villages and value roughly the amount of cultivated land, cattle, etc., and fix the proportions for taxation, nominally this is one-tenth of the produce. The proportion once settled is seldom varied or changed, except when the cultivated area and prosperity of a village has much increased. The taxes are paid in cash and kind. The cash revenue is derived from such cultivation as vines, or rice, and from poll and cattle taxes ; that in kind from wheat, barley, straw and rice. The customs duties go to the revenue of Persia at large and are controlled by the Central Government. They do not form part of the local revenue of the provinces. The system was, for many years, to farm the customs to the Prime Minister, who sublet to minor contractors. The local Government have no direct interest, neither can they interfere in the general administration of the business. This is however a matter of ancient history, as the customs throughout Persia are now managed by the Director General, a Belgian, who appoints his own officers, who are res ponsible to him alone, throughout Persia. The road taxes, octroi and passports were also, as a rule, farmed out amongst certain of the court officials who made a business of this part of the administration. An instance of the practical working of one of the contracts will show what was formerly the general system of the whole. Take the passports. The original contract was ir the hand of an official who had sublet the mo nopoly at the various frontiers, Turkish and Russian. The sub-con tractors finding the profits less than they anticipated, suppressed the original and authorized forms, on the face of which the price, condition of issue, etc., were printed, replacing the same by another form, in which many of the details were omitted. They then raised the price more than 50 per cent, from 5^ to 8 Jctutis, and reduced the available period of the passport. We now come to the illegitimate taxation of the Governors to reimburse themselves for their outlay. The direct and indirect taxation above described form the “As\” or real revenue, but in addition is another taxation called the “ far ” (additional). This is an extra levy in cashazarbaijan 69 proportionate to the cash payments of the “ Asl” revenue, and is the per qmsite of the Governors. It ranges from | to 5 or 6 Iran per tuman i.e., if a man pays to the Government as revenue 10 tumans in cash he must pay in addition perhaps 50 or 60 hrdns to the Governor. The “ far ” tax has gradually come to be accepted by the people. It is made the source of much exaction, each Governor making what he can out of it sometimes even forcing the village to pay as “ far ” three or four times the amount of the “Asl” revenue. The troops are also exploited in the interest of the Governor, only a percentage of the amounts noted in the memorandum as payable to the troops really finds its way to the proper quarter ; so with buildings, repairs, pensions. 1 Maku and the adjoining districts of Awajik and Kara Aineh (q. v ) are under the control of hereditary chiefs. The Government of the heredi tary Chiefs differs in some respects from the foregoing. They are prac- Hereditary Chiefs. tically independent, and except for small j-iii , , , annual payments in cash and kind contribute little towards the general expenses of the province. The taxation is re gulated much on the same principle, though the amounts may differ in degree ; for example, those villages in Maku which have come to the chief by inheritance pay different rates from those obtained later from the throne by purchase. The following will give some notion of the relative taxation. Maku village proper :— Cotton pays in proportion of .. Wheat House tax .. Royal property purchased— Cotton pays in proportion of .. Wheat „ Barle y „ Cattle pay a small tax. Men and boys pay a head tax. An additional tax is also levied as “ far.” The nomads a,re taxed differently ; the tax takes the form of a house to house demand; m Maku it comes to 1 medjidieh. Each aroup of tents also contributes a small amount of oil, namads and horse clothing to the 1 in 5 1 „ 5 5 tumdns. 1 in 3 i „ 3 1 „ 3 As regards the well being and status of the peasant, the conditions of life in the Government provinces or in the chiefs’ territories are much alike The people are fairly well off though robbed to the last degree but they are at last beginning to realise what good government 'and order nie&amp;n, 3»nd are discontented, with, their own rulers. The frontier along the north-west from Julfa to Ararat, adjoining that Frontier policy of Persia. Russia, offers little subject of dispute. The . , lme of demarcation is strictly defined, whilst the cession of lands, south of ’Abbasabad, has removed any claim of Russia to further extension south of the Aras. Such disputes as arise are due to70 AZARBAIJAN the smuggling, of the border Turks or petty raids by the Kurds. A Russian officer meets a Persian official every year at some frontier village in Kara Dagh and then proceeds towards the frontier of Makfl, where he meets a member of the chief’s family. Frontier disputes are then talked over and settled: the arrangement seems to work satisfactorily. On the Turkish border affairs are not so well ordered. Here the chiefs of Maku, Awaiik and Kara Aineh are the guardians of the frontier. Their policy has always been, and still is, to push forward their outposts whenever an opening may occur and so small aggressions are constantly taking place from one side or the other. The Kurds also give much trouble, raiding on both sides, and then seeking protection, wherever their interests are best served. The frontier itself is fairly well-defined by the mountain range ; but this does not deter the chiefs from moving their villages over the border with a view to final claims based on present possession. The Tehran authorities encourage the chiefs in this policy and also keep alive the religious hate of the Shi’ah and Sunni on the border. Frontier officials both Turkish and Persian, have been on the Bayazid border for the last 3 years, but not one case out of 400 has been settled. There is a British Consul at Tabriz, the capital. Communications. The communications of Azarbaijan will be found fully detailed under Routes in Persia. But it may be remarked that, notwithstanding its mountainous character, the province is favoured by its situation between the capital and Europe. m ^ _ ,rri- R oa ds. I. The main road from Trebizond via Erzerum to lehran may be called the chief artery, while Tabriz the capital is the heart of the system. As it is unnecessary to describe the road in Turkish territory, it will be sufficient if we describe it from Kizil Dizeh, a few miles across the frontier. From Kizil Dfzeh to Khoi the road passes through the districts of Awa- jik Chaldaran and Zohrabad, which are described under their respective headings. The road crosses the frontier a few miles beyond Kizil _ Dizeh and first touches Persian territory at Awajik. Between Zohrabad and Dashlu Darreh is an extensive and richly cultivated valley, 9 miles long by 21 broad, occupied by many flourishing villages. This portion of the valley is 2 fairly free from Kurd interference and is specially protected by the governor of Kh5I. The road is excellent throughout. No special mention need be made of the road from Dashlu Darreh to Khoi, except that the pass is moderately easy for caravans, difficult for carts. The descent is by a difficult ravine to the village of Dizeh, and carriages must make a detour to the east into the hills. From Dizeh the road descends to the Khoi plain. Two main routes run from Khoi to Tabriz, one by the north of lake Uru- mleh the other bv Marand and Sufian. The former crosses the Masho Dagh south-east of Kh 6 i valley. The latter proceeds by the valley of the Zilbir Chai to Marand and thence across the mountains above Sufian. The route by the lake is more generally used by caravans, as both supplies and safety can be depended on, and it is well suited for both mule and camel trans port. That bv Marand and Sufian is used in its entire length, but from Khoi to Marand supplies are scarce and the road infested by theA2 ABB AT JAN Tl ll'ats. The road from Marand via Snfian to Tabriz, however, being part of the Tabriz-Julfa road, is in constant use. II. The Julfa-Tabrlz road is commercially the second road in north western Azarbaijan, that by Tabriz and Kizil Dizeh being of more impor tance ; but in many other respects it is the first of the roads in the north west. On the Russian side an excellent military road has been made along the Aras valley from Erivan to Julfa, where it joins the Persian caravan route to Tabriz, but no regular service is maintained. The Rus sians are now connecting Julfa with Erivan by railway. Shortly after leaving Julfa in a southerly direction, a difficult defile, the Darreh Duz, is entered. Here carriages must proceed with great caution along the bed of the river, heavily laden carts and light Victorias sometimes pass through it to the higher level of the plateau of Zal behind. Thence the road is along the level or by gentle slopes, through a rich and highly cultivated country, studded with large villages, to Marand. This plateau compares with Khoi and Karaziadin in richness. From Marand the road rises rapidly to the plateau lying off the MeshS and Kara Dagh, and there is a long descent over good ground to Sufian and so by the plains to Tabriz. A line of rail has often been spoken of in connection with this route. The Darreh Duz, how ever, offers a very great obstacle. It would be extremely difficult both to build and maintain a line through this defile. An immense amount of bridging would be necessary, the gradient is very unfavourable, and the line would be at the mercy of the spring floods (the water comes down like a wave sometimes) or, if carried up the cliff and friable rocks, would be subject to landslips. In many parts the steep hills are of friable rock, which can be compared to the strata of the Harnai. It would be much wiser to bring a line somewhere west of the Darreh Sham mountain in the valley of the Aras and by Karazladin (the watershed is remarkably easy) to Marakand then by the Zilbir Chai valley to Marand, and so to Tabriz a perfectly feasible and easy route. A concession has been granted by the Shah to the Russians in return for a loan made in 1902, for the construction of a carriage road from Julfa to Kazvin, then linking with the Rasht-Kazvln-Tehran road, and a com pany has been formed in Russia to carry out the concession. In 1912 the Russians applied for a concession to build a railway from Julfa to Tabriz with a branch to Urumieh, making it a condition for an advance to the Persian Government. The road between Julfa and Tabriz had already been made fit to take a railway, and the bridges were also adaptable for that purpose. III. From Kh5I to the Aras river there are four routes, leading to Shah Takht, ’Abbasabad, Karghulak and Julfa respectively. There is also a road suitable in fine weather for carriages to Maku from Khoi. The following other important roads lead from Tabriz ; (IV) through Ahar and Aslandfiz to the north-east; (V) to the Caspian through Ahar and Ardabil to the east; (VI) to Kurdistan through Marageh and Sainkaleh on the south ; (VII) to Turkish Kurdistan through Oilman, Urumieh, Tabriz, Sauj Bulagh and Ushnu on the west and south-west. In June 1902 the Persian Government commissioned a German en gineer in their service to make a road from Astara to Tabriz via Ardabil,72 AZARBATJAN the road is to be fit for carts and to follow the existing caravan road. This road will not have to fear the competition of the Julfa-Tabriz-Hamadan Railway, a line projected by Russia, as it leads from Astara which has cheap water transport to the centre of Russia, whilst there is a long land trans port from Julfa. This projected road is noteworthy as being a purely Per sian undertaking, to be made entirely with Persian money. But in 1910 it had not yet been begun. TelegrafJis —Besides the main line of telegraph with iron poles through Mianeh, Tabriz, Marand and Julfa, there are branch lines from Tabriz to— 1. Giigan, Maragheh, Mianduab, Sauj Bulagh. 2. KhoJ, Salmas, Urumieh. 3. Sarab, Ardabil, Namin, Astara. 4. Ahar, Kalipar, Pul-i-Khudafarln, Hasankhanlu, Pilsuvar. The most important passes are— 1. That from Khosran to Oilman, height 7,000' by spurs of Siah Rish, and villages of Neri and Holaneh. 2. Neri to Urumieh steep and in parts only 2 feet wide. 3. The Kalashln (Kalehsln) pass from Ruvanduz to Ushnu over the Iva Shaikh mountain, commonly called the Peak (height lO^GS 7 ). It is so difficult as to be scarcely practicable for military opera tions. 4. The Sauj Bulagh route to Mosul through Sulduz to Ushnu, thence over the Kalashln via Sijakchal to Ruvanduz. 5. The southern, or Garushim route from Pashi Fort over the water shed of the little Zab, 6,180', and, down the valley of the Sauj Bulagh river. 6 . Kiepert’s map shows a shorter route, but by a higher pass, via Lag win.

Some of the ’Azalis participated actively in the constitution a list movement and the Bahais for this reason abstained entirely from politics until 1910. Ab-ul-Baha in the meantime travelled in Turkey, England and America. His teaching attracted much attention in Chicago, where a Bahai con venticle has been built.

A river of Mazandaran, which rises in the Elburz range, and, flowing past Barfarush, falls into the Caspian Sea at the port of Mashad-i-Sar. It lies too far below the level of the country to be useful for purposes of irrigation. At Barfarush it is about 50 yards wide, and flows with a current of about 2 miles an hour ; it is said to be navigable for boats from Mashad-i-Sar to within 3 or 4 miles of Barfarash, but only during flood time. Above Barfarush it is crossed by a handsome brick bridge called Pul-i-Muhammad Hasan Khan of eight arches, very slightly raised in the centre. Its width at its mouth at Mashad-i-Sar is about 70 yards and its depth 14 feet, but the entrance is obstructed by sand banks. The stream is deep and muddy, with quicksands.

Their chief is Riza Sultan. ,. . » -.r. Some Baityaravands have settled in other villages of the district of Kir- manshah or Baladeh, such as in Sarab-Nilufar, Shahini, etc. The tribe is settled on the frontier line of the Kirmanshah and Kurdistan provinces, near Mian Darband.— (Rabino, 1907.) bAjlan— The Bdjldn tribe— The Persian section is properly called Jumur. On- einally the Bajlan, or ruling Bajlan family came from near Diarbekr, headed bv one Khan Abdal Beg, and settled in Darna and Dartang whence they were expelled by the Kalhurs in the early part of the 17th Century. They were given Zuhab by the Turks, and ruled there till 1826, the tribe being then expelled by Muhammad ’All Mirza. The succession was as follows (1) Khan Abdal Beg, who dispossessed Qubad Khan of Dartang, (2) Assaf Beg (3) UthmanBeg, (4) Ahmad Beg (subsequently entitled Pasha for braver’y during the wars against Nadir Shah), (5) ’Abdulla Pasha (killed Shiraz in the war against Karim Khan Zend), ( 6 ) Haji Qadir Pasha, (_7) Abul Path Pasha, ( 8 ) Ahmad Pasha, son of Haji Qadir Pasha, (9) Uthman Pasha evicted in 1826, (10) Mustafa Pasha, now resident in Khaniqin. The l as t has no son, and will be succeeded by Abdullah Beg, his younger brother. After 1826 the tribe split, the Jumur sub-section remaining on the frontier, afterwards Settled at Quretu under ’Aziz Khan. The Qazanlu section settled in Ben Kudra, and the Shirawand, Hajilar, Gharibawand, and Daudawand, migrated to Musil and Khushnav in central Kurdistan. The tribe is com posite being formed of the Guran peasants found on the land by Khan ’AbdalBeg, and the tribe which accompanied him when he came to Darna and Dartang. The language of the ruling family has thus continued to be Kurmanj (Northern or pure Kurdish) and that of the peasants the Guran or debased Pehlevi tongue. This admixture accounts for the widely divergent physical and moral types found in the tribe, which in its Jumur branch, composed entirely of the peasant Guran class, is of a low standard, poor and filthy, while the Qazanlu of Ben Kudra are a finer tribe in every respect, having much more of the true Kurd stock among them. The Jumur sub-section has always been sedentary, and has been settled since early in the 19th century around Quretu village where ’Aziz Khan, the most noted of the Jumur Chiefs, built a house, his brothers having fortified residences in neighbouring villages. On the death of ’Aziz Khan six sons were left, Karim ’Ali Agha, ’All Murad, Majid, Parviz, and Hamid, the last of whom was only about 3 years old. So long as Juan Mir Hamawand held Qasr-i- Shirin, the Jumur Bajlan were a poor and insignificant people, but on Juan Mir’s death ’Aziz Khan obtained the post of guardian of the frontier in his dis trict and the right to maintain road guards up to the old Bajlan frontier at Mil-i-Y’aqub on the Sar-i- Pul road, and he left some money and flocks to Karim Khan.— {Soane, 1911.) Karim Khan supplies 15 horsemen and 15 tufangchis to the d’Arcy con' cession works, at a salary of 15 and 10 tumdns respectively. The oil wells belong to the Bajlan, but the Chiahsurkh camp is on Guran territory. The Baj Ians are agriculturists and shepherds.— (Rabino, 1911.) The Baj Ians under Persian rule barely number 200 families. They occupy the territory from Qasr-i-Shirin to the frontier. There are two rival factions, the ’Aziz Khan, who have a post of 100 horsemen at Quretu, and the Qadir Agha, who have a similar post at Bishkan. For further information see Rabino’s “ Gazetteer of Kirmanshah ” and Soane’s article on Qasr-i-Shirin. The Bdjldn country may be said to be bounded by Qa r-i-Shirin, Dar-i- Diwan, Zuhab, Shirvan rivers, and Aqdagh mountains, the two latter form ing the locally recognised Turkish frontier. The Bajlan tribe musters 100 horsemen and 300 families.— (Wilson.) BAJMANLU— A tribe living in the Tehran province.

BAND-I-BIJ1N see BIJIN— BANEH—(District.) One of the eighteen buluks of Kurdistan, about 24 farsalchs west of Sinandlj. It is inhabited by a wild and blood-thirsty people under a chief who has the title of Sultan. Nadir Shah, Padishah of Persia, gave this title to the chiefs of Baneh in order to be even with the Sultan of Turkey who called theBANEH 85 governor of the adjoin'ng district in Turkish territory ' Pasha ” which is a contraction of Padishah. The district was in 1910 occupied by the Turks. It was under the Government of the Kurdistan province through the sub-governorship of Sauj Bulagh. In 1912 the Turks were reported to have evacuated it. The bululc has 200 villages and a Sunni population of over 30,000, paying until a few years ago yearly taxes amounting to 56,000 krdns, now (1911) more. The buluk is well wooded with oak, and the various products of that tree, principally galls, are exported in great quantities. As these products are easily gathered, the people easily earn money and, not caring much for agri cultural pursuits, which entail hard work, they sow grain only sufficient for their wants. All the men are well armed and are good shots. Most of their clothes are made of stuffs woven locally of wool of sheep and goats and called “ ehal ”, and some of these are of very fine texture. The people of Baneh speak the Mukri dialect of Kurdish. There is a large number of Jews in the district—pedlars and petty merchants. Partridge abound in this district, particularly in some hills called Kuh-i- Shikar, where there is a narrow pass a farsakh in length. In the proper sea son the Governor gets all the people of the buluk to drive the birds into the pass and the birds are then slaughtered “ in' millions, ” enough to supply the population with food for three days. The inhabited portion of the vil lages is comuonly a mere kernel, enclosed in a mass of vineyards and orchards. Each house forms a portion of a small block, divided off by narrow, ill-paved lanes,—never as much as 20 feet broad, and often less than 10 feet: each has a central court or yard, a high wall and strong gate facing the lane, and high walls on the other three sides : beyond the court is usually a small patch of garden. Of the better class of houses, a large proportion are two- storeyed, with upper windows looking on to the lane. The walls of all are built of very hard mud. With a double storey the height is about 20 feet; the lower walls 3 feet thick, upper 2 feet; the roof flat, with 6 beams of poplar, varying in length from 10 to 15 feet, covered with a thin layer of mud. A parapet wall of mud, bullet-proof, runs round each roof. Such buildings would afford no protection against shot, but would be difficult to fire. Bazar shops cover less ground. The vineyards or orchards or (locally) gardens extend for more than a mile round the larger villages, being thickest on the line of irrigation. They cover from 2 to about 10 acres of ground, are thinly planted, and enclosed by solid mud walls, of 12 to 15 feet high, with a single small gate. Narrow lanes and watercourses wind through, and about them, affording very indifferent communicatons. Though the height of the garden walls and the thinness of the cover within them detract from their defensive value, they might, with some little labour, be converted into an excellent screen very difficult to penetrate in the face of even disciplined opposition. The tract about Baneh and between it and Maragheh is fairly supplied with forage. Fuel is plentiful and water easily procured. Carriage in any quantity is not to be found. There are no large droves of camels, and but few mules.— {Napier; Schindler.)86 BANEH BlNEH—(Town). The principal place of the above district is Baneh. Lat. 35° 39'; Long. 45° 54:'. Elev. 5,400 feet. Baneh is situated on the bank of a tributary of the river Kalvi, and there is a deep ravine on the other side of the town. It numbers at present 900 houses of which 40 are of Jews and 90 of Ottoman subjects. In 1832 Gerard esti mated the population of this place at 600 houses, It has 1 hammdm, 8 mosques, a Masjid-i-Juma. and 3 caravansarais to accommodate merchants, who come here during the gall nut gathering season. The Governor of the district lives here. The town has a prosperous look and the Khan’s residence is fine and well-furnished. The Governor of the district of'Baneh is called S dtan, a title granted by Nadir Shah to the frontier governors as a retort to the title of Pasha (Padishah) given by the Turks to their frontier governors, and to the present day the cus tom of sounding the naqqdr khdneh in Baneh, instituted by the same Nadir Shah, is still maintained. A peak, Arbabat, three miles south of the town, has its slopes covered with vineyards more than half-way up. The town was formerly known as Baruzeh and, according to Rich, who visit ed Kurdistan in 1820, it was a wretched, filthy place, scarcely deserving the name of town. The town of Baneh was built about 160 years ago by Ism’ail Sultan , a gover nor of this district, descended from Suiaiman Beg, who is buried one mile to the west of the town (some say this tomb only contains one of his teeth) and whose tomb is now a place of pilgrimage, in the vicinity of which it is considered a crime to touch the trees, so that there is a fine forest at this spot. Haj i Zaman Khan‘ who for 18 years was governor of Baneh, until he fell into disgrace when Mu’ayyid-ud-Dauleh was governor of Kurdistan, is also a descendant of Suiaiman Beg. Communications. —Near to Baneh the road traverses a mud flat—a depres sion in the plain some two miles in width, which would form a serious obstacle to the passage of guns or waggons. This morass—which it really is in winter—may be turned by a long detour over a rough hill skirt. Trade.—The trade of this place is very limited. Baneh imports from Turkey sugar, dates, iron and worked iron, copper, cotton and silk goods, drugs, spices, mercery, and haberdashery. The importations from Turkey to Mukri and Saujbulagh pass through the Baneh Custom-house. Exports to Turkev comprise gums, mercery and hardware, tobacco, native silk goods and clarified butter. The imports from Turkey for the year January 21st, 1902, to January 20, 1903, amounted to krens 269,008 and the exports to Turkey to krdns 96,242. Baneh also exports to Russia gums and gall-nuts. Some serviceable Henry-Martini rifles are made here. Some of the sub-districts of Baneh are :—Kaileh-Naur, chief place Sairan- band-Pusht-Arbabat, name of the sub-district between Baneh and Balekeh. Dastelal, chief place Siaumeh. Tajan, chief place Tajan. Kivarud, chief place Kiverud. Dasht-Tal, chief place Satkeh (Tal, in Kurdish, is the Persian talkh, bitter). This plain was formerly called Dasht Khush, the pleasant plain, but Nadir Shah passed a very bad night when in camp here,BANE—BANV 87 and ordered the name of the plain to be changed from Dasht Khush to Dasht-Talkh-B uin.) f( Fot list of villages in the district and further information see Rabino’s ‘ Report on Kurdistan. ” The water of Baneh is good.—(Schindler 1910 • Rabino, 1911.) ’ BANEH (Tribe).— The name of the tribe occupying Baneh District (q.v.), now (1910) almost sedentary .

The valley is a narrow gome with steeply-rising bare hills on either side ; its stream, after passing through the village of Bizarud, flows into the Khandula stream near the Kirmanshah- Kandula road The elevation is from 5,550 feet to 6,210 feet, and the climate is delightful m summer, but severe in vrintev.—(Burton) BANlGAS MOUNTAIN— A bare and lofty ridge on the right bank of the Zimkan river, along which it extends, from the Mamakura to the Kaleh KazI mountain It has no very conspicuous summit, but north of the gorge of the Halur river by which only its continuity is broken, it attains a height of some 4,000 feet above the stream. It forms the watershed between Malndasht and the Zimkan and is crossed by paths between the two valleys. Its outlines are rounded and it is quite bare of trees.

The town is situated in the midst of flat country, about 15 miles from the mountains and a like distance from the sea shore; it is surrounded on all sides by cultivation of rice, sugar, and cotton; it is built amidst tall forest trees, and as the houses are small, stand in groups and are surrounded by mud walls, it is difficult to believe one self in the middle of a large town, and impossible to guess its extent from a hasty observation.

BlJAR— A town of 3,000 houses, the capital of the district of Garus between Azar- baijan and Kirmanshah. It is curiously situated in a hollow, surround ed by barren peaks, rising at several points to about 1,000 feet. It has no defences, save a weak wall, enclosed, but not effectively screened, by gardens. The inhabitants are occupied chiefly in agriculture. Save a few carpets nothing is manufactured. The high elevation of the site of the town entails the disadvantages of a rigorous winter and a scanty water-supply ; it was, no doubt, selected when the level fertile banks of the Kizil Uzun were trampled by hostile bands of Tartars or Kurds. , The villages of Bijar are usually without gardens and stand in the centre of extensive tracts of plateau land ploughed for' corn. The quan tity of land owned by the village is so extensive that a crop is grown only every third year on the same land. The average yield of wheat on such land is calculated at five-fold. Ordinarily the gross products of the land are said not to exceed local requirements ; .but after a good season, such as in 1875, a considerable surplus would be available. The only exportable products of the district are sheep, which are kept in large flocks on the upland pastures and the wastes surrounding the cultivated lands. Forage may be procured in large quantities, and in spring there are a few fine pastures about the head-waters of the Kizil Uzun. Fuel is more scarce perhaps than elsewhere on the route (Tabriz-Kirman- shah), the people depending on dried camel-thorn and small stores of ta'pdleh, or dried camel dung. Beasts of burden of all descriptions are almost unprocurable, and the fact is remarkable, for the country seems peculiarly fitted for rearing camels. There are no nomads save a few tents of Shah- savan, and few mules or horses are bred in the villages. In the district of Khamseh, lower down the Kizil Uzun, camels are to be found in consi derable numbers, there being a large and constant export of grain thence. The Official Army List shows a regiment of infantry 1,000 strong and 300 irregular cavalry as being in garrison, but this is only a paper garrison. There is a Persian Government telegraph office.

BILAVAR (Buluk), see MlAN DARBAND.— BlLAVAR—(Valley) Elev. 5250.' A valley in Kirmanshah, about 30 miles north of Kirmanshah city. It is immediately north of the range of hills that bound the Kirmanshah plain in that direction. It is bounded north by a mass of hills. The valley is about 27 miles in length from north-west to south-east, and is about 4 miles in breadth. It is separated to the south-east from the Bizarud valley by a low chain of hills, a spur of the Kuh Baluch. It is bounded west by the Shahu range. The valley is exceedingly fertile and contains numerous villages. It is well watered by springs and streams, the principal one being the Razavar-rud, which forms one of the head-waters of the Kara- su. The inhabitants are Kurds of the Shi’ah sect and are of the Bilawarl branch. The valley is governed by a Sartip, who resides in Kirmanshah. The annual revenue is only 1,300 tumdns and is derived from taxation on crops. It was fixed at this amount many years ago, and has never been altered since. This sum is small, and in no way represents the wealth and produce of the valley. Firewood is procurable from the ranges north and south of the valley, and from the banks of the Razavar where, in many places, there is an extensive growth of willows, small trees and bushes. The peasantry use dried cakes of cow-dung and that of other animals as fuel. The Hamawand Kurds, two hundred to three hundred tents, camp in the valley during the summer months. The winter in the valley is severe, the snow sometimes lying on the ground for three months, while most of the roads as well as the passes giving entrance to the valley are impassable. Wheat is reaped early in August, when fruits, such a100 BILBA BILBA— f The name of a tribe, which inhabits the district of Lahijan in the province of Azarbaijan, for which they pay rent to the Mikrls, of which tribe they are believed to be a branch. The Bilbas roam about the frontiers of Persia and Turkey, transferring their allegiance from one Government to the other as expediency suggests, until it is difficult to say among the sub jects of which nation they ought properly to be included. About 80 years ago they rose to such power that they were alike a terror to the Afshars, the Mikris, and the Muqaddams. The MikrI country they had entirely overrun, and it was not until Ahmad Khan, of Maragheh, the famous Muqaddam chief, invited all the leaders of the tribe to a great banquet where he murdered 300 of them in cold blood, that the South of Azar baijan recovered its tranquillity. For some years after this they were hunted from the face of the country like wild animals, and were obliged to take refuge within the Turkish frontier, where the Mir of Ruwandiz found them, when he rose to power, and by again slaughtering their most distinguished chiefs brought them under some order and obedience. Since the removal of the Mir, they have partly relapsed into their old predatory habits, and are now regarded as the most treacherous and turbulent of all the border tribes of Kurdistan. Their power is so broken that at the pre sent day they cannot pretend to meet the Mikris in open combat; bub still, to prevent their depredations and retain them in some sort of vassal- age that tribe has been content to relinquish to them the rich district of Lahijan, where parts of the two divisions of Mangur and Mamish are now settled, gradually adopting agricultural pursuits and passing from a nomadic to a settled life. The third great division, which indeed includes nearly half the whole tribe, is named Piran. • These, with the remainder of the Mangur and Mamish, still adhere to a wandering life, pasturing their flocks in summer upon the Persian frontier along the skirts of the mountains from Sardasht to Ushnu and retiring on the approach of win ter far. within the Turkish line, to the warm pastures of Baitush and Gar- migan on the banks of the Lesser Zab. They number about 5,000 fami lies, but they can bring even a larger number of horsemen into the field ; every Bilba is provided with his horse and his spear. Firearms are used by the Bilbas in all their mountain warfare, and their matchlockmen are excellent marksmen, their assistance being eagerly courted by the Kur distan chiefs in their struggles among each other, or for a foray on the plains.

This plain terminates on the Kirmanshah side at Paintak.—( Plowden.) BISITGN (or BlSUTUN or BIHISHTAN)— Lat. 34° 23' 4' Long 47 ° 21' 24'. Elev. 4,500'. A village in Kirmanshah, 21 miles east of that town, on the road to Hamadan and Tehran, consisting of 400 houses and a royal caravansarai. It is well-known on account of its ruins, of which accounts will be found in Sir John Malcolm’s ‘‘ Persia”; also in Sir H. Rawlinson’s paper on the subject in the 9th volume, Geographical Journal, in Jones’ “Journey through parts of Persia and Kurdistan”, in Taylor’s “Route from Tehran to Bagh dad,” and in Rabino’s “ Gazetteer of Kirmanshah ”. The latest book on BIsitun is “ The Sculptures and Inscriptions of Da rius the Great on the rock of Behistun in Persia. A new collation of the Persian, Susan and Babylonian texts, with English translation ” bv L. W. King and R. C. Thompson. 1907.— (Schindler.) The stream Gamasiab, an affluent of the Karasu, flows by Bisitun, where there is a good brick bridge. There is a caravansarai in fair repair here, and a few supplies are procurable. It seems a busy little place. Passen gers, both foot and horse, and caravans of laden mules and donkeys, are continually passing to and fro. The rock of Bisit an is nearly per pendicular, and rises abruptly from the level plain. The engravings and in scriptions, of which a copy was first taken by Sir H. Rawlinson in 1844, are cut on the face of the rock at a height of about 300 feet above the ground. One-third is now illegible. The bas-reliefs, however, are still in excellent preservation. The whole design is intended to represent a triumphal memorial of Darius Hystaspes', 521 B.C. The famous sculptures are at the foot of the Parrao cliff, where also a splendid spring of water issues. The surrounding country is crossed by numerous irrigation streams, dotted with many villages and covered with corn crops. This village suffered severely in the famine.— (Plowden—Floyer — Rozario — Bellew.) BlSTAGAN— Elev. 5,330/ Twenty-nine and a half miles from Isfahan on the road to Yazd. It contains 40 houses (200 people) and belongs to the Shah. The village is watered from the Zindeh Rud and by wells. Sixty hharwdrs (39,000 lbs.) of barley and wheat are sown yearly. There are 11 pairs of oxen for the plough. Taxes 100 tumdns yearly. In the village are the ruins of a very fine mosque and minaret. The mosque and minaret are quite distinct buildings. Outside the moSque, to the east, is a courtyard, the buildings surrounding which are decorated with inscriptions in modern tile work. It is said that the inscription on the top of the minaret gives the date, 47 A. H., but this is incredible, as it would fix the building only some 10 years after the Arab conquest. The mosque is probably over 700 years old. (Preece, 1892.)104 BIS—BOL BlSTAN— A village of Kurdistan, situated in the Zagros mourtains, on the Tur kish side of the Buchan pass, which leads to Baneh.

A town in Azarbaljan east of the south-east corner of lake Urumieh, 12| miles south-east of ’Ajabshir and 71f miles from Tabriz on the Tabrlz-Kirmanshah road, being situated on the left bank of the river Safi Chai, over which there is a handsome stone bridge of five arches south of the town. Bunab has about 700 houses, five covered bazaars, seven or eight sarais, and is surrounded by extensive high-walled gardens. As in almost every village in this district, each house forms a portion of a small block divided off by narrow, ill-paved lanes, never as much as 20 feet broad, and often less than 10 feet. Each has a central court or yard, a high wall and strong gate facing the lane, and high walla on the other three sides ; beyond the court ia usually a small patch of garden. The walls are built almost entirely of mud, which becomes nearly as hard as stone. The surrounding vineyards cover from 2 to 10 acres of ground, are thinly planted, and enclosed by solid mud walls of 12 to 15 feet high, with a single small gate. Fuel is plentiful and water easily procured. Fruits, meat, etc., are cheap and abundant. For 4| miles to the north-west of Bunab on the TabrI road is an antiquated causeway across a muddy end of lake Urumieh. This causeway is rudely paved with round stones, is 10 feet wide and raised about 2 feet. Bunab forms a dependency of Maragheh, paying 4,000 tumdns of revenue and furnishing a quota of 400 men to the Azarbaljan army—an obligation fully■ equivalent to the amount of actual taxation. Abundance of water is found a few feet beneath the surface, and the vine yards are thus all provided with wells for irrigation. The Safi Chai rive* of Maragheh flows along the south outskirts of the gardens, and numerous canals are derived from it, which contribute to water the town and vineyards.— {Rawlinson; Thidmann; Napier; Gerard; Schindler.)

Its waters drain partly towards the Ab-i- Diz, partly towards the Gulpaigan plain. Many of its villages are very poor and some, principally those belonging to the Government, have been deserted on account of the rapacity of local officials. About 500 Armenian families reside in 16 of the Burbarud villages, bravely holding their own against the almost perpetual attacks of the Chahar-lang Bakhtlarl nomads, who hold the hilly regions to the west.— (Schindler.) &lt; BURBUR— A tribe in the Tehran province.

It is now one of the largest opium-growing districts in Persia.— (Mmfe) BURUJIRD (TOWN) —Lat. 33° 53' ; Long. 49° 10'; Elev. 5,050'. (5 315 ' {Schindler.) ’ ‘ v 5 ’ The town is divided into 4 parishes, containing 8,000 houses (of which at least 2,000 are m rums), some are well built and shew signs of comfort. Population about 22,000 ; there are 11 mosques, 3 colleges, 12 hammdms and 6 caravansarais. The bazaars are small, but neat ; the caravansarais are entered from them. The town has been surrounded by a wall and ditch, but in most places the wall has fallen down and the ditch is full of cultivation. The town and its surrounding villages pay 6,000 tvmdns (£.1,200) taxes; in the days of farming the customs were let for £2 000 In the bazars there is a good show of cotton goods, Manchester ’ and Russian. Burujird was formerly renowned for the excellence of its printed cotton goods, but this industry has declined, and thev are now imported from Isfahan. In the town and villages there are 1,000 carpet looms and 3,500 carpets are turned out yearly, the carpets, however, are not good but what has been done by European firms at Sultanabad {q.v.) might also be done here. Cotton twist, karbdz, or native cotton cloth, and the uppers of native shoes, called g~veh are also made here. 130,000 lbs. of cotton the whole of the local growth, is thus employed. Burujird exports opium, which is widely renowned in Persia, almonds and kat ra or gum tragacanth. ' ’ The imports are cotton goods to the value of £20,000 each from England and Russia, lamps, glassware, cutlery, woollen goods, etc., from Austria and110 BUR—BUZ As a distributing centre Burujird is of much importance, roads radiating from it as under :— To Shushtar via Khurramabad and Dizful 257 miles. „ Kirmanshah .. .. .. 120 „ „ Hamadan .. .. .. 95 „ „ Sultanabad .. .. .. 60 „ „ Qum via Sultanabad .. .. 82 „ „ Tehran via Sultanabad and Qum 234 „ „ Tehran direct .. .. .. 226 „ „ Isfahan ' .. .. • • 230 „ The road to Sultanabad is very good and if the Shushtar road were developed and peace maintained, Burujird would develop into a large and important town on account of the convenience of its situation. All kinds of supplies are to be got in the bazar, which possesses a Persian telegraph office, but in 1911-12 the wires were so frequently cut, that communication was completely interrupted. The town is entirely enveloped in gardens, each with its picturesque little summer house. Scattered round the city are about 50 villages. The water supply seems unlimited throughout the valley, and as it is very near the surface it could easily be procured even in very dry years : grapes and melons are plentiful. On the hills above'the town are many thriving villages. There is a regiment of infantry quartered here, nominally 1,000 strong, but it is doubltful whether more than two or three hundred exist; the town is the place of embodiment of the Savareh-i- Bakhtiari and Yar Ahmadh nominally 1,000 strong, but it is very doubtful if even 200 exist. Here are also a few gunners, 6 brass guns made in Austria, and 700 muzzle-loading muskets. Burujird was like most places in Persia, in a more or less continual state of unrest during the years 1909-12. In January 1911 the Lurs rose against Muntasir-ud-Douleh, the Governor- General, because the latter had executed Latlf Khan, Salar us-Saltaneh, a relative of the Lur chiefs. Burujird wuis also the scene of some fighting during Salar-ud-Douleh's rebellion of 1911, for which see Kirmanshah ”. (Preece ; Picot.)

The Chaldee an population is Christian in Turkish as well as m Persian territory and is described, though erroneously, as a Nestorian sect ; hence the Chaldseans are generally designated as Nestorians, especially in Persia.

DAMAVAND—(Mountain)—L at. 35° 57'40°, Long. 52° 6' 47°.— (&amp;. John.) There is considerable difference of opinion as to height of the mom- tarn, which is a peak of the Elburz range between ’Iraq AjamI and Mazan- daivn, 40 miles north-east of Tehran, and 45 south of the Caspian. In 1858 on?on/T ? th hypsometric al apparatus made it 21,520'. Lemm made it ^0,120 by trigonometrical computation, whereas the Russians, by the same means, only made it 18,549', which is probably correct.DAMAVAND 133 The mountain is of volcanic origin, consisting of layers of calcareous tufa sandstone, coal, limestone, greenstone, whilst the cone or summit is com- posed of a soft rock from which pure sulphur is dug ; there are hot springs at the base. Felly says the coal is of good quality and always burns in the British .Legation m Tehran. The hot springs are near the village of Garmab on the soutn side, the hottest of which, Garmsir, has a temperature of 148°Fahr Th f c ?' le terminates in a crater, 85 yards wide, the sides beir^ , com- po^ed of basalt, sulphur and limestone, the basin being nearly always filled with snow. J From two caves near the summit, and many small holes in the rock a stream, strongly impregnated with sulphur, issues. Very severe earth quakes are sometimes felt in Damavand. Snow lies upon the mountain all the year round, but only in large patches, parts of its extreme summit being totally uncovered. It does not look so high as Ararat, although its cone is much more abrupt nor does it m any manner rest upon so extensive a base. It would appear that though classed as an extinct volcano, the fires of Dama'v and are still alive and may become active. At about 5 niiles from Damavand is a lake, apparently formed by the waters of melted snow, which have accumulated in a valley without an outlet: it is situated at a considerable height above the town of Dama vand, in the basin of some very craggy mountains, without the possibility of a natural outlet. A water-mark all round shows the maximum of the collection, when the snows have entirely melted, which is in the sprino' • since that time we observed that it had decreased several feet in conse , quence of evaporation alone. Some of the old inhabitants of Damavand assert that whenever the waters of this lake decrease below their usual quantity, several springs in the neighbourhood of the town become dry This lake or basin—the water of which is quite fresh and most piercingly cold—is about half a mile m circumference. Its depth is great and in the winter it is frozen. It is entirely enclosed to the northward by an almost perpendicular chain of high mountains, the snows of which afford it the greatest supply of water .—(Thomson ; Ainsworth ■ Morier ■ Pellv • Traser.) ’ J ’ (( x For the various_ observations for the altitude of Damavand Notes on Damavand” in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, February 1888. y see Schindler’s Geographical DAMAVAND—(Village) —Elev. TjbOO'. A large village of 400 to 500 houses (300 of which are Damavandis, and the remainder Kirman families brought from that province by Agha Muhammad Khan) 40 miles north-east of Tehran, at the south foot of the Damavand mountain. It is situated in a hollow on the banks of the Damavand stream, which rises north of Zannkuh in the lake district of Tar, on the road from lehran, and is first distinguished by some old turrets which stand con spicuous on an eminence, and by one brick minaret which formerly be- onged to its best mosque. The valley about 3 miles in length and 2 in breadth, inclining on a gradual descent from the north to the south134 D AM A—DAM G and thus its cornfields are levelled like terraces. Besides the town of Damavand, situated nearly at its lower extremity, it contains ten vil lages, and nothing can be more lively and flourishing than the appear ance of this little tract. It is watered by two streams : the one flowing from the north-west, which is small, the other from the north, which is the principal river; they both meet the Damavand and flow through the town. On the borders of these streams are planted willows, poplars and walnut trees, which add generally to the landscape. The interior of Damavand is thickly shaded by them, and the conjunction of trees and water tends to keep up a constant coolness, even in the hottest part of the day. The towm is spread over a hill, the principal street being at the foot of it near the river. It is governed by a Saiyid, who has a large house at the south end of the town, and whose jurisdiction extends over all the villages that are dependent upon Damavand: of these there are about 30 in number, situated according to the quantity of water near them. The mountain of Damavand is seen from the town to which it gives its name: Damavand pays into the royal treasury a revenue of 497 tumdns, 118 kharwdrs, and 27 maunds of wheat.— (Morier; Fraser; Shiel; Stuart; Thomson ; Felly .)' ; DAMAYISH—(see DANA VISE)— A range of hills bordering the plateau of Halvan, near Zuhab.— (Raw- linson.)

DAMBAT— A village, lying north-east of the Kulush Kfih pass over the Ararat, mountains on the road from Maku to Erivan. It is a Kurd village, occupied summer and winter by Jelalis. Extensive Armenian ruins are found here. The road on to Erivan is said to be easy. The entire journey from Maku has been made in a landau with six horses in eight hours. The difficult part is from Kulush Kuh to Dambat, where the horses have to be assisted by the Kurds.— {Picot, 189i.) DAMGHAN— Lat. 36°, 15' 3' ; Long. 54° 19' IS” ; Elev. 3, 767'. The principal town of the district of the same name, 198 miles east of Tehran, 50 miles south of Astrabad and 41 from Shahrud. Description. —The ark or citadel, within which every family of Damghan owns a small piece of ground, is on the west side, standing on an artificial mound commanding both city and surrounding country. Inside it is the Mauludkhaneh (house of birth), where Fath’Ali Shah was born. This place had fallen in ruins, but has lately been repaired at the expense of the Governor of the Samnan-Damghan district, and is now lent to travel lers as a resting place. Damghan has an old brick caravansarai of Shah ’Abbas and several smaller, modern ones.DAM—DAM 135 The Chashmeh ’All stream passes the town on the western side and is crossed by a five-arched bridge at the Iraq gate. Canals, which intersect the town in all directions are led off from the stream some distance north of the town. The town has five quarters [Mahalleh-i-Shah, M-i-Chub-i- Masjid, M-i-Dabbehghan, M-i-Saravarl (commonly pronounced Sar6h)l and Zar Jub inside the walls, and one, Mahalleh-i-Ab outside. There are five gates, Darwazeh-i-Traq, Sara van, Zarjub, Khorasan and Shahman. The Chashmeh ’All hills contain a summer residence of the Shah, and a Buildings of interest. f )lace P%™ a ge, where ’All’s charger left an indent of his hoof. Near here also is the Chashmeh-i-Bad, a spring which, if disturbed at certain times causes a destructive hurricane. The town is recognised at a distance of 2 or 3 miles by two minarets the shrines of Imamzadehs, Ja’afar and Qasim, each with a minaret and domed mosque standing out conspicuously to the view. With reference to these monuments and the tomb of a saint named Imamzadeh Pir-i-’Alamdar, Khanikoff says that they all belong to the same period, to judge from the architecture, i.e., to ”the fifth century of the Hijreh. J He failed to discover the date of the construction of the great mosque of Imamzadeh Qasim. The mosque called after Pir-i-’Alamdar is adorned with two inscriptions in Cufic character—and was finished in the year of the Hijreh 417. The Imamzadeh Ja’afar is at the north-west gate of the city. The remains of the saint are placed in the mosque, under a wooden sarcophagus ornamented with richly-carved arabesques, but without date. To the right of the entrance a slab has been fixed in the wall on which is engraved a “ firman ” of Shah Bukhfson of Tamerlane, of the year 825 of the Hijreh. This “ firman ” proclaims a reduction from 7 to 5 per cent, of the duty hitherto levied on the soap manufactures in the town and district of Damghan. In a vegetable garden, near the mosque, is a small tower simply but tastefully designed, and the mscription above the pointed arch which forms its entrance states that it was.finished in the year 446. Damghan has several remains of more modern consequence in some well-built domes and cupolas, one of which is at present used as a mosque. History. Damghan was once a large city. Its foundation, like that ?&gt;* °S er 0 l d r ^ erslan towns 18 Popularly ascribed to the mythical Pishdadian King, Hushang. b/^r ranSacked by Jen 8 lliz K]l ' dn and thoroughly destroyed Here on the 2nd of October 1729 Nadir won his first great victory— nnn ta y def T e T ated tlie Afghan leader Mir Ashraf Ghilzai, with his army of 30,000 men Here, too, Zaki Khan Zand planted a garden with Persian heads and Agha Muhammad destroyed Shah Rukh, the grands on of Nadir The site of Hecatonepylos (q. v.), the capital of the Parthians, was south of Damghan, extending to Prat (q. v.). On August the 7th, 1911, the royalist troops of the ez-Shah Muhammad All, under Sardar Arshad, defeated the Government troops at this place and many of the latter then joined the royalists.136 DAM—DAN Climate. —The region in which Damghan is situated, though nearly on a level with Tehran, enjoys a pure and delicious air. Population. —This is now estimated at 15,000 souls. Resources. —Damghan can supply 500 camels ; 100 mules ; 3,000 donkeys and 60,000 Indian maunds of grain. The river flowing from Chashmeh ’All is the principal source of irrigation to the district, to which is added another small stream and several kanats. The soil is hard and gravelly, yielding 8 or 10 for one; where uncultivated it is covered with soap wert and the khdr-i-shutur or camel thorn. Large pieces of cultivated ground and many gardens now occupy much of the ground on which houses formerly stood. There are very few trees about the district; they are only to be seen in the neighbourhood of the villages ; the streets of Damghan are planted on each side with the JujabI tree. There is very little wood used in build ings as the place is infested with white ants and the only wood which resists their attack is juniper wood which has to be brought from Mazandaran. Cotton, wool, barley, wheat, fruit and nuts are sent to Astrabad and Rasht for the Russian market. Administration. —The town is under the administration of a Governor, who generally resides at Samnan or Shahrud; he pays a fixed sum to Tehran, and repays himself by local taxes, having 300 villages in the district under him. The Ndib, or deputy lives in Damghan. Communications : Roads. —Eastwick s^ys there are two good roads by one of which Sari is reached in 3 stages and both of which are much frequented.

A picturesque village in Azarbaijan on the Turkish frontier, about 17 miles east of Ruvandiz, on the Mosul road. It is situated in a hollow on the right bank of a small tributary of the Ruvandiz Chai, towered over by an old castle, and shaded by primeval trees. The rocky walls of the hollow are rent by defiles leading to the gigantic Zagros mountains.— (Gerard, Thielmann.) DARIA-I-NAMAK— Elev. 2,400'. To the west of the Siah Kuh lies an immense sheet of salt water, ex tending away beyond the horizon in that direction. No land appears anywhere above its surface. It is said to have existed for many years, old men remember seeing it when children. Natives say that the new lake which appeared near Qum a few years ago (of which an ac count appeared in the proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society for 1885) increased until it joined it, and that one continuous sheet of water now exists. The following rivers contribute to it:— (1) The Kand river. (2) The Karaj river, (3) The Rud-i-shur, (4) The Karasu. (5) The Qum river. (6) The Jajrud river. The eastern boundary of this lake is formed by one continuous sheet of the hardest rock salt, resembling in its evenness and appearance a sheet of ice. It is exceedingly difficult to make any impression upon it even with heavy iron hammers and wedges, and the small portion which was extracted was found to be crystalized salt. Its thickness cannot be less than 3 or 4 feet, and it may be 30 or 40 feet. No impression could be made beyond a few inches. The salt plain extends eastward, it is said, to a distance of 6 farsakhs beyond the route. It evidently drains westwards, and does not join the great kavlr of Jandak, as a low watershed intervenes. In winter it is said to be covered by a sheet of salt water from 2 to 3 feet in depth, but such is the hardness of the salt that it does not dissolve but remains and affords a firm passage for qdfilehs in all weathers. The surface is covered with a web of fine cracks, leaving octagonal slabs about 3 feet in diameter.140 DAB,—DAR The cracks are filled in with a fine white layer of hard salt. The slabs are to a very great degree transparent, and the surface is dotted with patches of soft white salt resembling freshly fallen snow. It affords a firm and un- slippery foothold. The salt contains a considerable amount of moisture, a bag in which some was placed being speedily saturated. The salt con tinues along the south borders of the lake for many miles. The ground adjoining the salt is havlr or swampy soil with a salty efflorescence. The salt commences on this in a cake { inch thick saturated with water and breaks on being trodden on, but this rapidly gives place to a sheet firm as a rock. If a hole is cut in the salt, water oozes up and fills the hole precisely the same as with ice. I think it probable that these vast deposits of salt absorbing all the moisture in the air may account for the extreme dryness of the atmosphere in these parts.— (Vaughan, 1890.) A salt lake, or marsh, which extends between Qum and Tehran, east and west, for about 150 miles, and has a breadth of 35 miles in some places. The roads through this morass are not easily distinguished, and the unfor tunate wanderer runs the risk of either perishing in the swamps or dying of thirst and heat.— (Kennier.)

DILLO— A place in Kurdistan situated on a hill between Karadagh and Ibrahim Khan Ji. Here are some very extensive excavations or caverns, of which it is said no one has ever been able to reach the termination.

DILMAN, DlLMAN OR DlLMAGAN— A town in the Salams district of Azarbaijan, on left bank of an affluent of lake Urumieh at its north-west cover. It is of considerable size ; is said to contain 15,000 inhabitants and is surrounded by gardens. The streets are clean, but the bazaars are poor and ill-supplied. There is a Persian telegraph station here ; the line runs on to Bash Kaleh in Turkish territory. There was an old town about 4 miles to the west of the present site, which is now almost in ruins, the position having been changed on account of the greater security from the Kurds which the new spot afforded, cara vans are sent from Dilman to Van, Julamarik Tiflis and Erzerum.—(Shiel.)

The Chief estimates the surplus grain produce at about 6,000 kharwdrs or 2,300 tons. It now finds its way chiefly to Hamadan. Rabino says that in 1902, owing to drought during the last 3 years, the cultivation of rice had been much reduced. A considerable number of horses and mules might be found in the district, and fuel and forage in large quantities. The plain is entered from the north by the Gardaneh-i-Millehmas Pass, t he easiest between Sunqur and Kirmanshah. Napier says, “ though rugged, this pass is by no means a serious obstacle : guns might cross it in its pre sent state, and a little labour would render it easily practicable.” At the foot of this pass lies the little valley of Dinavar, and opposite to it frowns a precipitous impracticable-looking range of mountains, which however is pierced by the drainage of many hundred square miles of country. From the plain of Dinavar flow two considerable streams which find an exit through the “ Tang ”, or defile of DinaVar. The road winds for 7 miles between towering precipices, and would be difficult to traverse in the face of any determined opposition, its flanks for many miles being inaccessible, and, when accessible, so flanked by steep scarps as to be nearly impracticable to direct assa ult. A detour of about 20 to 30 miles from Dina var east over a low pass, crossed with ease by horsemen and laden camels to Sinneh, a station on the high road, turns the defile. For a list of villages in the district see Rabino’s “ Gazetteer of Kirmanshah ”.— ('Napier, 1876.)

Direh is the Garmslr of the Khammam, Shehrik and Varmaziar Kalhurs. “A track of country watered by the Direh river in Kirmanshah, some 14 miles south-west of Zuhab on the road to Shushtar.” “In the narrow valley, which opens into the plain of Direh, were the pasture grounds of the Kirmanshah stud. This spot has been selected on account of its position ; it is shut in between the hills on one side and the river on the other, the horses reared in it were celebrated throughout Persia. The plain is about 4 miles in length and 2 miles in breadth. It was formerly included in the Pashaliq of Zuhab, but after the conquest of that district by the Persians, it was purchased by the Kalhur chiefs from its Turkish owners. There are 150 resident families of Kalhur at Direh, and it also affords winter quarters for 400 more, who are nomads. ” — (Rabino, 1902.)154 DIR—DIZ DIRKl— A grazing hamlet of 10 houses of Kurds in a bare side valley above the left bank of the Qishliiq stream below Sinn eh.

' E ELBURZ— A range of mountains that separate the Caspian basin from the table land of Persia, and is continued east and west : in the former direction it unites with the Paropamisan range in north-west Afghanistan, and on the west it is connected with the Caucasus by the Talish range. 1 e northern slopes are clothed with dark forests, but the southern are pre cipitous and mostly bare, a few juniper trees only dotting the rocks here and there as little black spe iks on their rugged sides. Their course is nearly parallel to the southern shores of the Caspian sea, into which numerous small rivers or streams, having their source in these mountain heights, tind their way. These streams, generally dry for the greater part of the year, are rapid torrents in the spring, and in many places they are quite untord- able. ENZ ALL— A seaport in the province of Gilan, situated in the south-west corner of the Caspian. It stands on the westernmost of two long sand-spits, which separate the Murddb from the sea. On the opposite, or easterly, sand- spit stands Qazian. . n . , ,. There are some 300 to 400 houses in EnzalT itself spread out m alon^ line, where all the business, etc., is carried on, and where all the native population lives. There is also-an Armenian church. . , , It is on the whole a miserable place, consisting of a collection of wood and reed houses. . , Qazian boasts of a small hotel and has 2 customs houses for import and ^History.—In 1805 a Russian force took possession of Enzali and tried to take Rasht, but being defeated with a loss of 1,000 men they retreated to Enzali, which they shortly after vacated. i i * In 1909 and 1911 Enzali was used by the Russians to disembark their troops for Rasht and Kazvln. In 1911 owing to disturbances mEnzali the administration of the town was taken over by Russia, and all Persians were disarmed. . . , Resources .—See consular trade report on the Caspian provinces under Military. —There are small detachments of Persian troops at Enzali and at Rasht, and a few gunners in charge of guns of an obsolete pattern, used chiefly for saluting purposes. In 1912 even the saluting guns were con fiscated by the Russians. There is a fort in Enzali, but it is of no military value, and only mounts 2 or 3 obsolete muzzle-loading guns. Harbour .—The bay or lake of Enzali is nothing more than a very large breakwater formed by the waters of several streams and separated from the sea by two long sand spits. The entrance between these is from 200 to 300 yards wide, and very difficult owing to a bar. The bar allows boats drawing 8-9 feet to enter. The extent of the bay may be as much as 30 miles by 10, C300GSB162 ENZALI * 1 the greater part of which lies to the west of a line that would join Rasht and Enzali. It is for the most part, very shallow, but there is good enough anchorage for ships that ply on the Caspian. There is a rough kind of wharf at Enzali, and also a stone light-house which, however* is not of much use as it is seldom lighted. At Qazian there are wooden wharves, and 2 landing stages, alongside which steamers can load or discharge. In January 1904 the Russian Road Company obtained permission to dredge the lagoon and construct wharves ; but it is not known (1912) whether any work has been carried out. There is a Russian fishing establishment just behind to the east of Qazian the lake being full of fish. Shipping—A certain number of ships are built here, of various sizes, generally about 20 feet long, but all alike in shape, having the stem and stern equally sharp and pointing upwards, while the centre is considerably lower. They generally carry oars, but have also a mast and sail which carries them on at a good rate when the wind is fair; but which are never used when it is at all before the beam. Many of these crafts are to be seen running along the shore, and lying in the mouths of the creeks and rivers up the coast, and there are a certain number constantly trading between Pir-I- Bazar and Enzali. They are navigated by a crew of from three to six men, one of whom is looked np to as the master. Some of these boats are cal culated to carry from 10 to 12 tons, and have a half deck, under which they could stow baggage or goods out of danger from the weather. At Enzali is stationed a small yacht of 129 tons presented to the Shah by the Czar of Russia. Mail streamers of the Caucasus and Mercury Steam Navigation Company touch at Qazian twice a week in summer and once a week in winter. They lie outside off the Customs’ House, passengers and goods being landed in steam launches. If the weather is very bad, steamers go on without attempting to put passengers ashore. Communications .—There are 2 routes from Enzali to Rasht, the land and sea routes. The land route goes via Qazian ; it is practicable for carriages and has lately been put in order by a Russian Engineer named Sultanov ; a tax of Krdns 7 per carriage is charged. Steam launches ply to Pir-i-Bazar by a circuitous route instead of by the direct route taken by native boats ; this is owing to the shallowness of the water in certain places, which could easily be remedied by dredging. The Pir-i-Bazar road, owing to want of repairs, has become practically impassable for wheels in autumn and winter. There is an alternative route by Mubarakabad, which, owing to its having less traffic, is in better repair. It is the property of a private individual, Haj&gt; Agha Riza. For native boats, Mubarakabad in a shorter distance than Pir-i-Bazar. A certain amount of traffic goes on by this route, especially in heavy goods, which can go up the Mubarakabad river, but have to be transhipped at the mouth of the Pir-i-Bazar river owing to its shallowness. T rENZALl 1G3 A scheme exists for the construction of a landing place within a few hundred yards of the mouth of the Mubarakabad river. It is stated that steam launches could go alongside a pier at this spot and goods be delivered out of lighters into carts for Kasht. This would obviate the present tedious journeys up the Rivers Pir-I-Bazar and Mubarakabad. From here a direct road would be constructed to Takhteh Pul, about half way b tween Pir-i-Bazar and Rasht. The Russian bank has recently (1903) purchased the Qazian Rasht road, the construction of which will greatly shorten the present circuitous and tedious journey by foot from Enzali to Pir-I-Bazar. The distance from Enzali to Tehran is 234 miles in 19 stages. The sea route is as far as Pir Bazar.

The latter runs south-west till it meets the former on the plain of Maran about 10 miles south-west of Kangavar; and at a spot nearly 10 miles south of that place, it is joined by the third, or chief branch, the Ab-i- Kulan, which comes from the Guran mountains by a north-west course of about 40 miles. The trunk of the three united streams under the above name then winds for nearly thirty miles in a general direction to BIsitun, where it is crossed by the Harsin road, 19 miles east of Kirmanshah, and is here a broad stream with a smooth and rapid current. The width is 40 yards and the depth 2 feet 6 inches : the banks and bed are of gravel and the gradient gentle; 250 yards below is a pier in the centre of the stream used for a flying bridge when the ford is impracticable.

It is miles east of Gandabeh.— (Vaughan.) GARDANEH-I-GARDAKANU—“ The Walnut Pass.” A pass, about 1,000 feet abo 'e the plain, abmt 76 miles from Kirman shah, on the Tabriz road. It is rugged and steep, and commanded by heights difficult of access, but might, with no great amount of labour, I be made passable for guns. It may also be turned by a detour of about 20 miles, by another pass to the west of Kuh Panjeh. • It marks the boundary between Kirmanshah ahd Kurdistan provinces on the road between Tabriz and Kirmanshah. The ascent is by a steep , and narrow path between steep and barely accessible slopes of 500 to ' l,000feet, crowned by granite peaks, total ascent, 1,000 feet. The descent is over steep slopes, 400 feet in | mile ; path barely practicable for wheels, but improvable without serious difficulty.— (Napier.) G ARD ANE H-I -H AS AN-F AL AK— A pass between Kokah and Khumain, about 50 miles north-west of Isfahan, on the road to Hamadan. It leads into the Saneh Alvand valley where KumI is situated.

Or “ The Pass of a Thousand Windings”—is a pass crossed between Afcheh and the Ear 7 miles from the former, on the road from Tehran to Dama vand. It is very long and wearisome, going winding up and up, disclosing still more distant heights at every turn. But the road itself is good and fully equal to our roads in the Himalayas.— {Stack.) GARDANEH-I-KALUl—Elev. 6,660'. A bare open saddle about 30 miles from Kirmanshah on the road to Kandula. The grazing is good, and the hill to the south-west is occupied by nomad tents ; the flocks water in the ravines below the Zilu mountain to the south-west. There are a few patches of corn. The ascent from the south side is gentle : the descent to the north towards Kandula is steep and rocky. There is no wood or water on the top of the pass. Prac ticable for laden animals, and improvable.— (Burton.)176 GAEDANEHIK—GARDANEHIR GARDANEH-I-KHAN— Is a long and difficult mountain pass between Saqqlz and Baneh; it is gene rally snowed up in winter.

GARDANEH-I-NA’L-SHIKAN (No. 1)— {i.e., the horse-shoe-breaking pass)— A pass in Kurdistan, about 36 miles north of Kirmanshah on the road from the Bllawar, valley to Ruvansar. Elevation 6,432 feet. It is about 4| miles west of Maran (Marab in maps), and the ascent thence is easy, though the last half mile of it is very stony and slippery in places from smooth slanting rocks. It is impassable to field guns. The summit is fairly level for | mile, and it and the hills on either side are covered with bushes and shrubs. On the Ruvansar side there is a very steep and diffi cult descent for 1J miles; road generally very (bad from loose stones, a few short stretches of an easier gradient, intervening. The hills on either side of the valley into which the descent takes place are steep and high. It would be easier for a force to advance from east to west across it than vice versa. The heights on either side are accessible from the summit of the pass, and those on the south of the route, from Maran, whence a flank ing force could move. It offers a strong defensive position facing west and would be very difficult to force from that direction.— {Vaughan.) GARDANEH-I-N’AL-SHIKAN—(No. 2.) A pass in Kirmanshah, about 25 miles south-west by west of Kirman shah city and on the main road, thence to Baghdad. Its elevation is 5,440 feet. It is 2| miles in length, and, though the road up it, is stony and formed of slabs of rock, sometimes slippery on its northern side, its gradient is easy and it is passable to field guns. The summit is 1 mile from the northern side, and the descent thence is down a valley over loose stones. Its southern exit forms a good position facing .south, the road for | of a mile after leaving it running within 800 yards range of the crest. The northern slope of it might form a position facing in that direction. It is turnable east by a road from Harunabad, which runs over or through the range under a hill, whose summit is marked by a clump of trees 4 or 5 miles off and to the west by the road from Gardaneh Cheharzabar to Gavarra.— {Burton .)

A town of about 100 housi s, situated on open ground, at the foot of a chain of low rocky hills, sur rounded by a fair amount of cultivation and by large plantations of date- trees. Water is obtained from a spring in the hill-side above the town, whence the water, which is good and exceedingly plentiful, issues through a cave blasted in the rock, and fills a series of pools. The surrounding country which is bare and sandy, slopes gently down to the kavir between this place and Tabas. Although the higher surrounding hiils are covered with heavy snow, it will not lie here, and the climate is mild for the time of year Air moist and damp. Camping ground good.

GARMAB (3) or AB-I-GARM— A village in Mazandaran situated high up in a glen on the eastern slope of the Damavand mountain. There are some hot springs here, highly impregnated with sulphur, and much used by the natives for bodily ail ments ; they have been resorted to also by members of the European mis sions at Tehran, and found very efficacious in certain cases. There is a bath and indifferent accommodation in the village, but unlimited grounds for tents. The spring issues from a rock in a rapid stream, through a stone channel that has been cut for it about 3 feet wide, and is hot enough to scald the finger if immersed in it. At about half a mile distant from the site of the present spring are the very extensive remains of baths, evidently of great antiquity, and curious small pieces of old pottery, quite unlike any to be now found in Persia and to be met with in large quantities. The bathing establishment had evidently been on a grand scale, and had occupied a considerable plateau on the side of the mountain. There must in those days have been an outlet from the mountain at this spot, as the present stream is lower down. These remains are very curious and well worth the attention of the antiquary.— {Fraser; Holmes; Baker; Napier; Stack.)

The villages of the Humeh are Safiabad, watered by the Kuhrud stream, Lathur watered by the Qamsar stream ; and Salihabad, Zaidi and Ghlas- abad watered by canals. The Garmsir proper extends in the north to the Shurab ravine forming the boundary of Qum in the east to the shifting sands of the desert, and in the west and south to the hills, in the south-east it touches the bound ary of Natanz. Its water-supply is from the rivers Kuhrud, Qamsar and Barzuk and from several kantits, but it is not abundant. The Garmsir contains the following villages, north of town of Kashan : Bidgul (q.v.) ; Aran and Nushabad, respectively 4 and 2 miles from Bidgul east of the Qum road, which produce some silk ; ’Aliabad (q. v .); Nasrabad, celebrated for its melons, 100 miles north of Kashan ; Sinsin (q. v.) and S. urab (q.v.).

West of Kashan, Fin (q.v.). j South of Kashan, the Garmsir extends to Gabrabad (q. v.). South-east of Kashan, are the villages Khurramdasht and Buzabad (q.v,). Most of the Garmsir villages have a scanty water-supply, and very few trees, but they produce much cotton and tobacco and some silk.— (Schindler.) GARMSIR (SPRING )—Vide Damavand. GARUS— The district of Garus, one of the hereditary chiefships of western Persia; covers a large area between the district of Khamseh and Kurdistan, and the provinces of Azarbaijan and Kirmanshah. The surface is broken by the drainage of the Kizil Uzun into a number of wide level plateaux, culminating at one central point in rocky elevations, and, round the edges, falling abruptly into a labyrinth of ravines, to the drainage level. The valleys and glens are well watered and fertile but their area bears a very small proportion to the whole. The extensive plateaux are almost destitute of vegetation and barren to all appearance, but have an excellent soil and with seasonable rains bear large crops of wheat and barley. As much as fifteenfold is commonly stated to be yielded under favour able conditions. The rocky elevations and the unploughed portions of the plateaux afford pasturage, seemingly poor in quality, but of unlimited extent. Various computations places the number of villages at about 500 with an average of 30 houses each. For the most part they are small, there being but two, Khasrabad and Najafabad, of over a hundred houses. These have about 300 each, and Bijar 1,500. Hence the population may be roughly estimated at 80,000 to 85,000 souls. Kurds, Turks, and180 GAS—GAY Persians, that is, clans, speaking Persian, but of obscure origin, are found in about equal proportions. To the south and west the Kurdish element predominates, to the north the Turkish. The revenue of the district, estimated at about 12,000 fwmaws—-£4,800,—is assigned to the chief, who furnishes to the Shah’s army one regiment of 1,000 men, 500 artillerymen and 300 irregular cavalry ; these numbers are nominal, for the most part from the Turkish villages. The actual troops are cavalry 100, artillery 100, infantry probably 300.— {Holmes.) GASHAN PASS— Elev. 6,290'. I he point where the road from Sinneh crosses the Shahu range to Juanrud. 4 he ascent from both sides is very steep and difficult for laden animals, that to the west being almost impracticable. The pass is waterless and bare of trees, but grassy. The ridge of Shahu slopes gently down from rocky summits to the north of the termination of the rang eat Kuvansar, about 4 miles to the south of the pass. The nearest villages are Karajian to the east and Khani Khadran to the west, each 1,000 feet below.—(5wrton.) GASKAR (GIL-I-GASKAR) also written KISKAR. Is a buluk of the province of Gilan.

GAVARRA— Elev. 4,970'. Properly GAHVAREH Stands on a point running down to the left bank of the Zimkan river a few mdes from its source. Is distant by road from Kirmanshah about 40 mnes to the west. Above the town the river flows north-east and bending sharply round, it runs north-north-west below ; its valley is narrow, and lined with cultivation and vineyards : below the town are some groves of fine poplars. The slopes round are gentle, well cultivated, and clear of trees The adjacent mountains hold the remains of oak forest. Water is abundant from the Zimkan river and many springs. Besides the usual crops large quantities of tobacco are grown : the gardens and vineyards have (1897) been largely destroyed by locusts and cultivated fields have taken their place. The town contains 400 houses, a small bazaar and some shops : there are a number of Jews engaged in trade. Here also is the residence of the Amir-i-Tuman Husain Khan, commander of the Guran Kurd regiment. It is also the head-quarters of Husain ’All Sultan.

GAVKHANEH or GAUKHANEH —Elev. 5,000'. The name means a depression and not cow or anything to do with the abode of cows, as is so often said. It is a great fen or marsh, 45 miles east of Isfahan near the road to Nain, and is the delta of the Zandeh-Rud the river on which Isfahan is situated. In summer there is very little water, about 15 square miles being covered, depth only a few inches • in spring, however, it forms a vast lake, 35 miles long by 8 to 10 feet wide the water in parts being 15 to 18 feet deep. On reaching the commencement of the Gavkhaneh the riv.-r breaks un into numerous branches, which flow for three or four miles through dense jungie and finally enter the salt lake beyond. This jungle consists of hign tamarisk and other bushes so close that in places one can only force a way through with difficulty. The ground is also very swampy and cut up by deep artificial channels, which have been made to distribute the water as evenly as possible over it. There is also rich undergrowth of grass and small shrubs. The place is said to be full of wild pig and it is breeding ground for wild duck, which rear their young in its most inacces sible parts. This thicket forms a good grazing ground for cows even in the ariest weather. There are numbers of seagulls and other birds about which live near the lake. The point, where the stream breaks up into numerous channels, is a regular halting place, as it is the furthest point eastward at which fresh water is to be found for many miles, &lt;182 GAY—GAV Beyond the Gavkhaneh lies the salt lake. It is 75 miles in breadth ! from east to west, and stretches in a southerly direction out of sight when viewed from the Slah Kuh. Vaughan, who visited it in December 1890, thus described itI viewed the lake from the Laghireh pass on the high road between Isfahan and Nam, when its further southern shore was distinctly visible, appearing as a high yellow bank, perhaps of sand. As, however, the road from Yazd to Yarzaneh passes between the shore of the lake and a low red hill called the Takht-i-Surkh, the position of which I fixed, it is improbable that the lake can extend much further south than that hill. At my camp at the foot of the Siah Kuh we were within 200 yards of the margin of the lake, of which the waters were a brilliant green, except near the shore, where they had a yellowish hue. Arriving Within 30 yards of the water a long bank of fine grey gravel about 12 feet high and 20 yards thick was reached. It had three successive watermarks on it—one at 8, another at 6, and the last at a foot. This latter, the most recent, con sisted, like the other ones, of drift wood, but contained in addition feathers and wings of sea birds, and myriads of the bleached bodies of locus ts Beyond this beach lay a level expense of soft clay, into which one’s feet sank deeply. Passing over about 30 yards of this mud the water’s edge was reached but it was so shallow that, after going into it for 30 yards, there was only a depth of 18 inches of water, the water being excessively salt. A delightfully cool breeze was blowing across the lake, on the surface of which flocks of white birds were resting. The scenery, though wild, is picturesque ; and if fresh water were carried by a channel, as it easily might be, from the Zindeh Bud to the foot of the Siah Kuh, the place would form a charming bathing and boating resort for the inhabitants of Isfahan. It is said that towards the end of the summer the southern end of the lake dries up, and exposes a vast sheet of solid rock salt similar to that on the shores of the Daria-i-Namak, south-east of Tehran. Kav'ir is witnessed here in the process of formation, it being in every stage bet ween the smooth soft mud round the water’s edge and the dry plain of a deep brown, pitted with large holes, and studded with dry excrescences. The Gavkhaneh appeared, from this point, to stretch away for 7 or 8 miles along the western shore of the lake, behind which was a high chain of sandhills. The northern shore of the lake, as well as the eastern, is formed by the smooth gentle slopes of the hills on those sides. The desert between Abarkuh and Chah Beg drains northwards, and probably into . the lake ; and the desert, of which this is the commencement, stretches south for many miles past Abarkuh, Karat-i-Yazd, and Robat. The Zindeh Rud river, which feeds the lake, pours down an immense volume of muddy water for several months of the year and this in all probabi- - lity is slowly silting it up. The river is far too rapid and tortuous to be navigable even when in flood, while in summer it is said to dwindle away to a shallow stream. Though fish are plentiful in the river, I saw neither them nor shell fish in the lake.—Round the margin of the fen, cattle and ^ mules graze through the winter till the “Nauruz,” when the mules have$AVK—GAVE 183 to return to avoid the heat, but cattle can graze all through the summer. The herd-bovs carry flour and curds with them for a month. Brackish water is to be found in the pools.— -{Preece; Stack; Vaughan.)

GAVRUD—GAVEH RUD—GAVARUD—GAURUD (q.v .)—GAURtT A river flowing down the Gav-rud valley, about 30 miles south-south east of Smneh and fed by numerous springs and streams from the adjacent hills opposite Kaleh : its bed about here is 200 yards broad from bank to bank, and m the spring it is quite impassable. In summer it is fordable and has a stream abo it 20 to 30 feet broad. The Valley is fairly well populated with villages, and corn and other crops are grown. As the stream runs further west its width narrows considerably, and as it runs through the hill to join the Shirwan river its breadth decreases to about 20 to 30 yards from bank to bank. While its bed gets more stony it contains numerous runs and pools, but the fishing is very poor, owing to the practice of the inhabitants of periodically poisoning the water for the sake of the fish. It is a picturesque stream, its banks in many places being fringed by willow and other bushes. A great deal of the water is led off for the purpose of irrigation during the summer. There is a route along its bank from Sinneh to Kaleh. Cows are found grazing on its banks in the valley during the summer months. Its waters are quite drinkable, being of a pale greenish tint. Partridges are seen in numbers on its banks morning and evening. A river, which rises near the village Akeh and Tulan, in the grazing grounds of the Kulliai tribe.. It is crossed by a good bridge called Pul-i- Darvesh, near the village Dairmuli, about 5 farsakhs south of Sinandij, The bridge was put into good repair in 1888. Is crossed by the road from Kandiila to Sinneh, about midway between the roads from Kirmanshah to Sinneh and Bijar respectively. The river184 GAY—GAZ here runs in two channels, each 30 yards wide, separated by a gravelly bank or island : in the summer months the left channel only holds water, the stream at midsummer being 10 yards wide and 2 feet deep of clear and good water. During the melting of the snows, the river is unfordable and is crossed 200 yards above the ford at a narrow point by a temporary wooden bridge. The valley here is broad and cultivated: on the left bank it slopes 2 miles low hills, on spur of which is village of Kaleh commanding the ford and bridge. Height 5,500 feet. It is crossed by a caravan route from Kirmanshah to Sinneh, 14 miles south of Girdakanu. It is crossed by the Kirmanshah-Bijar road between Sunqur and Bisitun, 21£ miles from the former; it is here a small stream, with a descent to it of 300 feet, fordable, except* in flood, with sound bottom.

GlLAK— A caravansarai in Azarbaijan, 48f miles from Mlaneh on the road thence to Tabriz. It was built by a merchant of Gilan, hence its name (Gilak being adjective form of Gilan).— (Schindler.) GlLAN— Lat. 36° to 38° 30'. Long. 48° 30' to 50° 15'. A province of Persia, bounded on the north by the Caspian and the Rus sian province of Talish, east by Mazandaran, south by Khamseh and Azarbaijan, and west by Azarbaijan. Its length is about 150 miles, and its breadth varies from 20 miles to 50 miles. Its area in square miles is 4,673. The province is divided into the low, unhealthy, jungle-clad plains, which t skirt the Caspian and the lofty hills to the south of the province.188 GlLiN the beginning of June to the end of September the flat country is reputed to be almost uninhabitable by Europeans or other strangers to the climate. The neighbouring mountains, however, offer a salubrious refuge during this period, but a person is there in complete seclusion and cut off from intercourse with the neighbourhood by the distance and badness of the roads. During the unhealthy months the inhabitants always sleep on raised platforms —a sure sign of a damp, malarious climate. Fraser mentions a very malignant and inveterate cutaneous disorder, which prevailed not only among the lower, but also among the better classes, which he attributes to dirt and a total want of any remedial measures. Another very common disease is a sort of joint evil, by which the patient suffers the loss of his toes and fingers one after another as in joint leprosy. Fraser, however, did not consider it the same for the countenance has not the swelled and leprous appearance of .that malady. It is leprosy according Dr. Frame. (Rabino, 1911.) Other cutaneous disorders, as ring worm, ulcers, etc., are also very common. Gmelin mentions the small-pox as frequently visiting Gilan. It is said to be brought on by, or generally consequent upon, a particular wind, which blows from the south, and it remains epidemic for from six to twelve months, after which its virulence relaxes and it gradually disappears. A dreadful plague visited the country in 1830 and carried off a large number of its inhabitants. Position of the Peasantry — Labour. The price of the peasant’s labour is in the most cases one-half of the produce, be it rice or silk. Under this arrangement, called “Manasifi, ” the peasantry, who work upon the estates of silk proprietors have to furnish the seed or silk worms’ eggs, but in rice plantations the seed is provided by the landlords. Another system is that of £&lt; Ijareh ” by which the landlord lets his mulberry or rice plantation to the peasant, receiving from the latter in lieu of rent a share in the produce of his labour. In the former instance, the landlord’s share is three-fourths ; in the latter, one-third of the produce. In all circumstances, the labourer lives in his cottage rent free. He is at liberty to cut as much wood as he choses from the surrounding forest, part of which he uses for fuel, selling the remainder. But, although the peasantry enjoy certain advantages in this province, to which they are strangers in other parts of Persia, their position is far from being a flourishing one. The unequal distribution of the fiscal burdens, as illustrated in the mode employed for levying the mdlidt (which will be treated of later on) affords an incentive to the landlords to deal unfairly with the peasant. In other words he frequently takes “ the lion s share ” of the produce, instead of abiding by the terms of his contract, and the peasant is left to shift for himself. The law in despotic Musalman States affords no effectual remedy for abuses of this kind; here, as in the other parts of Persia, might is right, and a bribe administered in the proper quarter will always ensure success to the donor.gtlan 189 This unsatisfactory state of things is further aggravated by another evil—usury. In many districts of Gilan the peasantry are heavily in debt to their landlords, who exact a usurious rate of interest, from 25 to 40 per cent, being the lowest figure upon each loan. Money thus lent is frequently lost. A succession of bad crops plunges the labourer into difficulties; he is unable to pay, and when reduced to great straits, deserts the village to elude the pursuit of his creditors. In a thinly populated province like Gilan, where the supply of labour is already far below the demand, the practice alluded to must necessarily operate as a serious check to agriculture, and it follows, as a natural consequence, that, in districts where both the landlords and tenants are in pecuniary embarrassments, the collection of the mdlldt is attended with great difficulty and with a certain amount of oppression. Many thousands of labourers come from the Khalkhal districts of the west side of the Talish mountains for the winter, but return to their homes in the spring as they cannot endure the climate in the summer. The Gilanls are far from ill-looking; they are not so ruddy as the natives of the higher provinces, and persons of a dark, almost of a black, com plexion are oftener to be met with than among these. They are by no means deficient in size or muscular strength. The population is estimated variously at 150,000 to 200,000 souls, but there are very few data for a correct estimate and it is very difficult to form an idea of the probable number on account of the peculiar nature of the country. The dense forest which covers it, by concealing from the view of the traveller the habitations of the people, except such as are immediately in his line of route, precludes his forming any estimate from what comes under his observation, and there are no public records to which to refer. The language of Gilan proper is the Gilek, a dialect of Persian, which is spoken with great rapidity and is less sonorous than the Persian uf other parts. The language of the Talish district, which bounds Gilan on the north is another dialect of Persian, and it has been ascertained to contain much more Pahlavi than either the Gilek or the language of Mazandaran. Of twenty substantives, which Abbot noted of the Gilek, only two varied from the modern Persian ; in the same number of words and of the same meaning in the Talish language there were only nine which corresponded with the Persian either exactly or approximately ; the greatest difference in the former dialect appears to be in the verbs and in the pronunciation. In Gilan gipsies are more numerous than elsewhere. They preserve the characteristics of their race as in other parts of the world. Fortune- telling is the occupation of the women. They live in little camps formed of miserable tents in which they migrate from the hot to the cold country according to the season. The donkey is their companion, and his master is the professional vendor of pots and pans. In features and habits they differ but little from their brethren in the West, and like them they have preserved in their language the trace of Hindustani origin. In the Persian they are called Kauli, which word is supposed to denote a connection with an origin from Kabul.190 • GlLlN The Indian method of carrying loads slung on either end of a stick c *r- ried across the shoulder is practised here ; grass, fruit, vegetables, and other market commodities are brought into town in this manner; and it is the custom of every one to carry a small basket of reeds in his hands, in which he puts everything he requires for common use or for journeys; it serves as a pocket and a wallet too; and being flexible, it folds up and goes under the arm when empty and expands, as required, when filled. The food of the Gilanis is very simple and light. Rice and fish are the principal articles. Besides these, they have abundance of fine poultry and horned cattle, but mutton is not commonly to be met with, except in autumn, when all classes are in the habit of consuming meat. Neither fat nor butter is used in cookery, nor is any sort of bread eaten except in the towns, the people generally believing it to be injurious to their health in this climate. The houses are, as has been remarked, very much scattered, generally consisting of three or four placed together in the heart of the forest. They seldom present the appearance of regular villages and are so much screened from view by the jungle that one is frequently not aware of their proximity. They are usually clean and neat within, and instead of carpeting they have beautiful mats, the reeds for which are obtained in abundance all over the country. There are few places in Gilan deserving the appellation of town. Rasht and Lahijan in fact stand alone as such. Enzali Langarud Euman, Masuleh Kasma, and Tahirgurab are large villages with tolerable bazaars. Resources. While Gilan is unhealthy and, up to date, utterly neglect ed yet it is a very fertile belt of country. The soil of Gilan appears to be in some parts a rich vegetable stratum on one of sandstone and pebbles ; it is probable from this circumstance and from marine shells being found underground that at some period the low country was all under the sea. Rice is the staple article of food in Gilan and its cultivation has, dur ing the last 30 years, made enormous strides and has become of para mount importance. Vast tracts of jungles have been cleared and put un der cultivation, but the inhabitants will not understand that water may be necessary and leave everything to nature, consequently; if the rains fail, the crops fail, in spite of there being water everywhere that could be used for irrigation purposes . An acre will yield 13,750 lbs. of rice, which is supposed to be superior to that of Mazandaran. The flora of the province is exceedingly rich. Amongst the trees, the oak and beech are in abundance, but the former is seldom of great girth. A species of very thorny acacia grows all over the country, and the pome granate and other wild fruit trees abound at certain seasons. Cotton and sugarcane do not thrive in Gilan, but these form almost the solitary exceptions. Forest trees .—The oak, elm, sycamore, ash, walnut and box abound in Gilan. The marshes and flats display a noble growth of alder, besides several varieties of poplars, willow and acacia. Amongst the latter, the silk acacia especially deserves mention and is called by the natives shabkhos, because it closes its leaves at night.192 GlLlN salmon, mullet, trout and carp being the principal varieties. In the Enzali lagoon 300,000 carp have been netted in a single day. The cows of Mazandaran and Gilan are of small size and resemble the lesser breeds of that animal in India ; they have small humps, bilt those of the bulls are larger ; they differ from the cattle of Upper Persia, which are of a better size, have less of the hump, and sometimes resemble the English breeds. The sheep are all small, and of the common-tailed sort; but few of the “ dumbas ” or fat tailed sheep, so common in other parts of Persia are here to be seen, the few there are have been brought chiefly as pets or by some accidental circumstance. No large horses are bred in these provinces, as neither the climate nor the nature of the country seem at all adapted to them, but there are excellent ponies that answer all purposes much better. They are strong, stout ani mals, very much resembling Highland ponies, which will carry enormous loads through their worst roads in winter. Nearly 300 lbs. is the usual load, but they often carry a great deal more. Horses, cows and sheep are fed upon rice straw, with which also the poorer classes thatch their houses. There is a great variety of birds in the woods. The pheasant is very plentiful; also the wood cock in its season, and the lake and its reedy islands and the marshes harbour myriads of wild fowl of many kinds. In summer the swarm of gnats and flies render a residence in this country far from agreeable. The wild animals found in Gilan are the tiger, panther, wild boar, jackal, and marten, and an animal called the “ vaspan, a sort of lynx, and the wild cat. There are more than one species of goat and deer; of the latter there is a fine animal called the “ maral.” • The principal exports of Gilm are, silk to France ; rice, timber, dried fish and fruits to Hussia. The principal imports are cereals, piece-goods, hardware and sugar. The proximity of Russia and cheapness of transport for Russian goods, combined with industrial progress in Russia, have been dominant factors in the increase of Russian imports at the expense of the United King dom, but, in spite of these advantages, Manchester holds its own. Man chester white shirtings, for example, enjoy a monopoly. There is no direct trade between the United Kingdom and Gilan, all prints, shirtings, etc., reach Rasht through Baghdad and Tabriz. Hardware and sugar are practically Russian monopolies. For the Consular trade report of the Caspian provinces for 1909—1911 see under ‘ Rasht ”. Military—Oi the military resources of Gilan, not much is known. The Gllaiks are not held in much estimation as soldiers by other Persians, though Shiel says they make good irregular troops in their own jungles, and certainly their conduct in repulsing with heavy loss the Russian attempt to advance on Rasht does not speak against them. There is a British Vice-Consul at Rasht, a French Vice-Consul, and a Rus sian Consul. Administration .—Gilan is under a Governor, who usually resides at Rasht.—GlLAN 193 The administrative divisions of Gilan are:— Lahijan, with Langarrud, Rudsar, Ramku, Lashtanisha. Rasht, Tfdim, Gilgaskar, Fuman, Shaft and Kuhdum. Rudbar. Rahmatabad; Shandarmin. Gil Dhlab. Talish Dfdab. Asalim. Karganrhd. The revenue is derived from customs, fisheries, Crown lands and taxes. The taxes levied in Gilan may be classed under two heads : the maliat or land tax, and the tax upon shops. The first is an impost upon free hold landed property throughout the province, which is assessed by Govern ment at a fixed sum for that purpose. It amounts to £6-9-1 levied upon every acre of cultivated land and is collected as follows : six months after the “Nauruz” or vernal equinox, the Government claims from the landowner one-half of the maliat, the remainder being payable in monthly instalments within the expiration of another six months. The tax upon shops, which also comprises public baths and caravan- sarais, is levied in proportion to their size and the manner in which they are occupied, whilst the tenant of such places also pays according to the nature and extent of his business. “Throughout the whole of Gilan the population may be divided into two distinct classes. The first, or that, which inhabits the plains exclusively remains stationary in villages or towns, where it cultivates rice, wheat, sugar, cotton and silk, its habits be : ng in all respects similar to those of the peasantry in other peaceable parts of the country. The people of this class are of course regularly assessed, and the revenue derived from them is fixed, because their means are known. The second class consists of those, who inhabit the skirts of the hills and the valleys amongst them, as well as the villages nearest their base, during the cold season, but who retire in the hot weather to their summits, and are thus subject to a periodical ch ,nge of abode. Some of these cultivate land to an extent which is, to some extent, proportionate with the goodness of the soil they possess and the advantageous position of their villages, but their chief dependence is upon flocks and herds which, in spring, are sent to the lower bills for pasture, and with which they move higher and higher as the season advances in warmth. Those villagers who cultivate land plant their rice or whatever their crop may consist of, and, having done so, leave a few of their number to watch its progress and perform the necessary operations, whilst the greater number with the’r wives and families move upward to their ‘yailaqs’ along with their chiefs, where they all lead a pastoral life, until the approach of the cold weather and want of pasture forces them down again. Each tribe has its own ‘yailaq’ or mountain lands, as well as its own villages and cultivable land below distinct from others, and they never interfere with one r nother ; but within their respective boundaries every one strays or plants his tent or his hut where he pleases.194 GlLAN It is evident that the arrangement and collection of stated assess ment among people, who lead a life so irregular must be a duty of great difficulty to the officers of the Government, and much must therefore be left to the chiefs, who retain for themselves as much as they possibly can. ; They, in their turn, are squeezed from time to time by Government, and thus i matters are equalised, though not in a very regular or sytematic manner.” The fisheries are let to a contractor; at the time of Lord Curzon’s visit they were leased to a Russian for £18,500 a year. The customs were formerly let to a contractor, but now they are worked by the Belgians, who have taken over the working of all the Persian cus- ( toms, and probably the state is a gainer from this arrangement, in Gilan, as well as elsewhere. . in spite of the state of neglect it is kept in, is one of Persia’s richest provinces. Its inhabitants appear to possess a great deal of wealth. Among the highest classes there are large fortunes, and traders' with from 2,000 to 5,000 tumdns capital are very numerous. The branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia is the only British institution in Rasht, and up to the end of 1900 was the only banking establishment. The rate of exchange at the beginning of 1901 was 51^ krans to a pound sterling. Communications. —Rasht with its harbour of Enzali is the centre of all the communications of the province. For maritime communications from Enzali, see article on that port. The only really decent road in the country is the road from Enzali to Rasht and thence on to Kazvln; this road has been made by a company nominally Persian, but in reality Rus sian, financed by the Moscow Poliakoff. The company received a con cession for 99 years and the road was opened in August 1900. The Rus sian traveller Rittich, 1901, describes it as being a well-made road, but states that the arrangements are not good, horses, carriages, etc., bad, and that it does not pay, as the Persians prefer to take their pack animals by the old paths and passes and so escape the road tolls. In May 1912 a Russian automobile section, consisting of 4 motor lorries and one light car, travers ed the road Lnzall to Kazvln, carrying supplies, ammunition and passengers. The light car travelled as far as Tehran, in spite of the difficulties of the road. The following is a description of the road that used to exist from Enzali to Rasht:— The road uo PIr-i-Bazar, the village where goods for Enzali are shipped from Rasht, extends for five miles through one continuous series of sloughs and bogs in deep jungle; and, having never been regularly made, each carrier leads his beasts as he best can, taking a new track when former ones have become impassable. No weather ever puts more than a tem porary stop to the traffic along this wretched path, which is entirely car ried on by means of ponies, a certain number of which are continually employed in it, and carry their heavy loads to the journey’s end, although after a shower they sink to their girths at each step.” All the roads in G.dan, up till recently, were in the worst state of repair, especially those round Rasht; they seem to have been allowed to get into tins state with the purpose of keeping out invasion. However, the Sipahdar-GILIN 195 i- Azam, Governor General of the province, showed much energy in making new roads and causing old ones to be repaired. Good me ins of communica tion are everywhere of great importence, but especially so in places, where, like Gilan, the country is a mass of jungle and morass. There is a certain amount of water communication from the Murdab at Enzali, inland ; for details see article on Enzall. The telegraphic service connecting Rasht with Europe and other Persian towns has been of late years much improved, but there is still room for im provement. From Rasht to Tehran and vice versa a telegram usually reaches its destination in 24 hours ; formerly a telegram has been known to take 18 days to get from Rasht to Tehran. There are few countries more completely protected by nature against external aggression than Gilan, for its coast is lined with a belt of impene trable forest, which shows a most disheartening aspect to an invading foe, whose perplexity would be completed by the deep murdcbs or back waters and extensive morasses, equally covered wifi forests, that lie behind the first barrier. At the same time these very obstacles would prove the best advantage to the defenders acquainted with their intricacies, and afford them means of securely annoying their enemies. On the south the passes through the mountains are of extreme steepness, difficulty, and ength, and might be defended or obstructed with so much ease that no 1 hostile army unassisted by treachery could hope to force them, or, if it succeeded m reaching the places below, it would find itself embarrassed in i a maze of jungles and morasses, impenetrable without a guide, and even under every advantage presenting the most serious difficulties to the march of many troops encumbered with baggage and military stores. MonteRh has formed no less decided an opinion of the impracticability of Gilan, saying that if the Persians were only united, nothing ought to be more desired than an attack from this side of the Caspian ; for had he not been forced to traverse it, he would have had no hesitation in report ing it impracticable, and it certainly is not possible to journey through it except with the aid of the cattle belonging to the inhabitants. In sum- m ® r “ be practicable to advance along the banks of the Kizil Uzun which then occupies but a small part of its bed, but immediately beyond its bank are deep rice swamps so unhealthy as to have obtained the appellation The district of death.” Should an enemy force his way through these impediments, the difficulties of driving the defenders from the steep and lofty mountains which bound Gilan on the west would be still greater, supported as they would be by the population of the neigh bouring parts of Persia. “ In fact ”, he winds up, “ nothing but a combined movement from both sides of the mountains by an army already possessed of the upper country would easily accomplish that object. There are no fortresses or fortified places in the province ” GILAN (No. 2)— A valley in Kirmanshah about 25 miles south of Sar-i-PuI; on the south east it joins the Chila valley, to the north-west it extends on into a valley which reaches the Hulvan river south of Qasr-i-Shirin.

They are said, with the connivance of the Government of Kirmanshah, to have driven the Bajlans out of Darnah in about the year 1,700, and to have obhged the latter to confine themselves to the plains m which, shortly afterwards, the Bajlan Pasha founded the town of Zuhab ” in 1S34, when British Officers were attached to the Persian army, Mai or Kawlmson was appointed^ to raise a regiment of Guran Kurds, which he suceeded m doing.

The Gurans are divided into six principal branches or dasta :— (1) Gahvarreh; (2) Baziani (tufangchi); (3) Niriji; (Narizhi); (4) Qalkhanl; (5) Bibiani or Buyani; (6) the two small Jaf tribes known as Jaf-i-Qadr-Mir Waisi and Jaf-i-Taishi. Total forces of the whole tribe on all reckonings, at the lowest possible estimate :—1,000 horse, and 3,500 armed foot. Large number of Guran not included in above are separated from their tribes, but would rejoin in time of general danger. All the Gurans are notably courageous and able fighting men. The chiefs of the tribe are Shi’ahs. The first six branches are ’Ali Ilahls and the Nairizh T s and Jafs are Sunnis. These latter, who have settled in the plain of Sarkaleh north of Zuhab, are Jafs who have separated from the great Jaf tribe of Sulaimameh. Mah mud Pasha, chief of the great Jaf tribe, has lately made great efforts to induce the Jafs, who have joined the Gurans, to return to his rule, and has threatened them with severe reprisals should they refuse. The Gurans furnish a regiment of infantry, divided into 8 companies, each normally 100 strong, with a ‘ Sultan , at the head of each. The regi ment has no band.

They number about 500 families under the chieftainship of Taghar Khan the son of the leader, who headed the migration from Turkey. Kara Aineh is the head-quarters of the tribe. This and several smaller villages in the neighbourhood shelter the various sections in winter. In summer they migrate to the mountains, which, on the west, form the boundary line between Persia and Turkey. The tribe was of greater im portance a few years ago (1890), but the hostility of the chief of Maku drove many of the families into Turkish territory. They are at constant enmity with the Jalalis and their feuds keep the frontier in a constant state of uproar.— (Picot, IS94.) The tribe is a branch of the Hasananlu (q.v.), and probably the most power ful tribe of the Azarbaijan frontier.

A large town situated at the foot of Mount Alvand, some 180 miles south-west of Tehran. The province of Hamadan is contiguous to the governorships of As’adabad, Isfandabad, Garrus, Khamseh, Nubaran (Khalaj), Iraq, Malayar and Tui-Sirkan. Dense trees and cultivation mark the neighbourhood of Hamadan which is prettily situated at the foot of the snow-covered AlvandHAMADAN 213 range. The town itself is extremely dirty, with narrow paved streets consisting of nothing but a central drain and two narrow foot paths on either side. There is a branch of the American Presbyterian Mission here, under the charge of Mr. Hawkes (in 1902). There is also a branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia in Hamadan ; in 1902 it was under the management of Carapet Zorab, an Armenian of some wealth and importance who held the title of ’Azaz-us-Sultan and was a capable and obliging person. There is a British Consular i^gent at Hamadan, as well as representatives of a Russian Agency and a Turkish Consulate. There seems no doubt that Hamadan, the old Persian Hogmatna of the Hiatory. inscriptions, is the same as the Agbatana or Ecbatana of the Greeks, and that modern Hamadan occupies the site of one of the ancient Ecbatanas, of which there were seven. It is admitted that Hamadan is the Ecbatana of the Achaemenian kings from Darius, son of Hystaspes, down to the Mace donian conquest. This is the Darius of the book of Esther. In the centre of the town is the tomb of ’Ali-bin-Sana, a once famous philosopher and physician of Bokhara, who flourished A. D. 980-1036. Not far from his tomb are the tombs of Esther and Mordecai, which are held in veneration by Jews and Muhammadans alike. Outside the town is an elevation known as the musallah, which, until it was levelled by Agha Muhammad Shah, was always occupied by a citadel. In July 1910 serious disorders occurred at Hamadan, and in 1911-12 the district was much disturbed owing to the presence of Salar-ud-Dauleh, who was fighting on behalf of the ex-Shah Muhammad ’Ali. Hamadan changed hands several times, and, in April 1912, was the scene of the death of Yprim (Ephraim), the Armenian chief of police, in a fight against the royalists. In December 1911, the Russians increased their consular escort by 100 Cossacks, and in April 1912 they sent another sotnia and a maxim gun. The town being situated on a plain 6,000 feet above the sea, has a climate and fhealth almost ideal climate, though it is intensely cold in winter. In spite of these advantages, fever prevails in Hamadan once every year and sometimes _ cholera breaks out. Small pox also attacks children, who ^succumb to it in great numbers. Almost all the people suffer from eye diseases. Snow remains on the hills ten months, and on the plain four months in the year. The population of the province of Hamadan may be divided into three p , ,. distinct classes—military, religious and mixed, opu a ion. The first consists of the Karaguzlu, 2,000 to 3,000 families. The second is composed of an infinity of saiyids and mullas, who seem to have a marked predilection for this province, most of the villages of which have been given them in fief by the Government. And tfie third class, the smallest, consists of merchants, tradesmen, workmen and agricultural labourers. The population of Hamadan town is estimated at 50,000 souls. Of these about | are Turks, the remainder are Persians, Jews and Armenians. The Jews number about 5,000 and the Armenians 250.214 HAMAD AN There are about 270 villages, averaging some 150 houses 'per village in the province. The villagers are mostly Turks, some of them not knowing a word of Persian. The majority are descended from the Ashaklu, Haijilu and Khuda Bandehlu. The Karaguzlu are now quite sedentary and have lost all tribal propen sities. They are divided into two branches, the Ashaklu and the Hajjilu. They were brought herefrom Turkistanbya certain Kara Yusuf. The Ashaklu inhabit the Darjazin district extending up to Nubaran. Their principal residence is Shavarin. The elder of the tribe is the Nasir-ul- Mulk, Abdul Qasim Khan ; the most influential and wealthy chief is Hisam- ul-Mulk, Zain-ul-Abdin Khan. The Hajjilu inhabit the Mihraban districts. Their most important villages are Kabudrahang and Bubukabad. Under their chiefs are also the Khudabandeldu who inhabit the same district. The principal chiefs of the Hajjilus are Sarkar Akram (’Abdullah Khan), and Jila-ul-Mulk (’AH Khan). Hamadan lies on the edge of a fertile plain, and is well supplied with Resources. good water. Fuel is cheap and plentiful. The district produces 40,200 kharwars (kharwdr—6^0 innn ° f ai J d barIe 7&gt; which is very cheap. The price of barley in 1900 was about |rd the price m Tehran at the same time, and at Gulpaigan Kumain and Dizabad on the road from Isfahan was nearly ith of Tehran prices, namely, 4 maunds to one kran (i.e., 261 lbs. barley for orf.) The bhahsavans get their supplies from this district, especially from Darjazin and carry them away with them when leaving for their winter quarters! There is a salt mine in the district, 40 miles to the east, a mule load costs about 2 annas. Pack mules can be purchased here in any numbers for an equivalent of Transport. ^ s ‘ 100 to Rs - 40 ? eacb - Ponies or ydbus can also be had at prices varying from Rs. 40 to Rs. 100 each ; Arab horses from Rs. 150 to Rs. 500 each. Any number of mules can be obtained on hire, generally at Rs. 30 a month, though sometimes the rate is reduced to Rs. 25 to Rs. 20 per month. The estimat ed load that a mule can carry, if fully loaded and over a march of 5 to 8 farsakhs, which is considered the ordinary march of a kdfileh, is from 4 to 5 Indian maunds. The principal manufactures are a sort of felt carpet called namad Mr. Rabino states that the exports of Hamadan from March 1901 to March 1902 amounted to 19,381,000 krdns and the imports to 24,188,000 krans, which shows it to be one of the busiest trade centres in Persia. , Highly prized among the Persians, are copper-ware, leather used for the Trade. covering oi trunks and bindings of tents, and .... „ , red and wbit e wine—price about 10 pence a bottle—which is well known and patronized. Gold washing and tanning are two industries which distinguish Hama dan from other places. The former has been discontinued of late years owing to local quarrels and lack of water, but anywh- re on the site of the present town a man can earn a hr an a day by washing the earth. TheHAMADAN 215 gold found is supposed to be from the old coins and buildings on the site of this ant lent capital. As regards the tanneries, Mr. Rabino states that |th of the population lives and works in the tanneries, and that hides are imported from all over Persia. The Nizam-ul-Mulk owns 2 Karaguzlu regiments of infantry of a Military nominal strength of 1,000 each. The Zia-ul- Mulk has 1 regiment, and Mansur-ud-Dauleh 1 regiment, the Karaguzlu Mukhbiran regiment ; Hamadan supplies one other corps, the Fadavi regiment of Turks and Lurs (1912). Gendarmerie .—In the beginning of June 1913, there were about 80 gendarmes at Hamadan. The province is divided into 4 buluhs or districts ; namely :—The biduk Administration. °l D t ar |!f in the &lt;&gt; £ Mehaban, (q.v.), the buluk of Sardarud (q.v.) and the bnluk of Durab-wa-Tawabeh (q.v.). Hamadan is a telegraph station on the Tehran-Khaniqin line ; there are Communications. branches from here to Salma, Khurramabad via Burujird and Sultana bad and Nihavand. Good k ifdeh roads lead from this city to other large ones, and all kdfilehs have to pass through it. Caravans go every month to Sulaimanleh from Hamadan, and occasion ally to Panjvm. The importance of Hamadan, from which so many roads radiate in all directions, both commercially and strategically, has always been great, and, now that the Tigris valley railway scheme has come into the field of practi cal politics, is greater than ever before (1902.) The Muhammareh-Khurramabad line may still further increase its im portance. (1912.) Commercially there is no railway line in Persia that would appear to have more favourable branches for trade than one linking Baghdad with Khaniqln, Kirman- shah, Hamadan and eventually Tehran. The pilgrim traffic to Karbala also passes along this route and would form a large increasing asset for a line which would also tap the fertile grain district of Kirmanshah and Hamadan. Baghdad-Hamadan way. Rail- In 1884, a Persian gentleman obtained a concession from the Turkish Government for a railway line from Khaniqln to Baghdad and Karbala and went to London to get it taken up, but failed to find support and even tually abandoned the scheme. The concession then lapsed. Then in the early nineties the Germans thought of a railway from Tehran to the Turkish frontier, but the scheme was given up. In 1895, a German, Mr. Moral, obtained a concession for the construction of a road from Tehran to Khaniqln and the establishment of wheeled traffic on it. He hoped also to secure a similar concession from Kkaniqln to Baghdad, but failed to get it. The scheme was dropped and the concession lapsed. * In 1897, a French syndicate applied for the Tehran-Khaniqin road con cession and the establishment of autocar traffic on it. The Persian216 HAM—HAN Gorernmen!; was not averse, but the scheme was opposed by the British Government and was then dropped. After that, the Haklm-ul-Mulk obtained a concession for running auto mobiles with exclusive rights on all roads in Persia not yet leased to others, with the right of making such repairs and works of construction on the roads as may become necessary for the automobile traffic. He then placed himself in communication with the above-mentioned French syndicate, who sent out an engineer to induce the Haklm-ul-Mulk to cede his conces sion to them, but they failed to come to terms.— {Yusuf Sharif ; Curzon ; Napier ; Rabino.)

Between Ask and Ranah it is crossed in six places by wooden bridges and the river then runs in a deep narrow channel be tween wails and perpendicular rock to the caves of Karu; thence to Paras | it is crossed in two places by wooden bridges. At about 18 miles from Paras it enters a valley 400 yards broad and then enters the plains. At Amul it is very broad, but not in the dry season more than 2' in depth ; in flood it is a much more considerable stream, being very full and rapid. It is crossed at this point by a bridge of 12 arches. It flows past the village of Mahmudabad, at some distance north of Amul. It is described as about 30 yards wide, with a deep bed and rapid current, and navigable by large boats. The characteristic feature of the Harhaz Valley is the banks of gravel varying from 10' to 50' and even 100' in height, which fill every angle of the stream and seem to mark its former level. They are formed of gravel of all sizes; in parts water-worn, the deposits of the numberless mountain torrent; and in parts angular, the collection of centuries of disintegration of the precipitous slopes bounding the river, by the action of frost, snow and rain. Many of the banks are now above the highest flood-level of the stream and consequently permanent. In these, long lines of caves have been excavated. There are four such'stations with numerous caves and it is calculated that they shelter no less than 40Q or 500 travellers every night, — (Todd ; Holmes ; Napier.)

The road from Kirmanshah to Khurramabad passes the town and exits from the upper end of the vtdley of Harsin. The town itself is situated on the north side of the valley which is there bounded by steepHARS—HARZ 219 and rocky mountains. The direction of the valley is from east to south-west, in which direction the drainage falls towards the Gamasiab river, the upper part above Harsin being a broad and cultivated plain ; mountains bare of trees on all sides. The water supply is most abundant, the principal source being a large spring which gushes out of the mountain close to the town : the upper part of the valley is also watered by numerous springs which form a fair stream. The gardens round and in the town are most luxuriant and in them the houses are scarcely visible. They also stretch for some distance below in a mass of verdure and are watered by broad and clear streams. The town contains the remams of a former castle, now represented by some rain-worn pinnacles and minarets of rubble masonry, rising to a consider able height. The people are Harsini Kurds, but there is some intermixture of Lurs in the villages of Karingi, Kariz, and Tamarg in the upper part of the valley, immigrants from Luristan, the frontier of which is only 7 miles to the east. Forage and grazing are abundant and supplies of every sort procurable. There are large herds of sheep, goats and cattle, and a considerable area of cultivation, which stretches over the whole of the upper part of the Valley, the breadth of which is about 8 miles, and length from the Gashur pass at its east end to the south-west gorge some 10 miles. The town of Harsin itself (which is divided into the two parts of Lakhu Sarab and Takhteh Khapi) is largely owned by men who are hereditary servants of the Persian reigning family, to the number of 200 houses.

From there one of the ancestors of the present owners of Hazarkanian came to the district of Saral and founded the village of Na’lshikan not far from Hazarkanian. He assisted a chief of the Bebeh Kurd, who had been driven away from Sulaimanleh, and who, when he came again to his own, granted his host land in Shahr-i-Zur.

HECATOMB YLOS— Where Alexander the Great rested after his pursuit of Darius, and later- on, the residence of the Parthian kings, was a large city full of supplies and well watered, situated in a plain, 1,260 stadia (144 miles) from the Caspian gates. 144 miles from the centre of the Tangi-bSar Darreh (q.v.) along the present high road brings us exactly to Damghan. But the site of Hecatompylos must be sought south of Damghan, for, accarding to Polv- bius (X, 28), when Antiochus III pursued As-aces III, he made one dav’s march from Hecatompylos to Tagae, and Tagae, present Taq (q. v.) lies only 5 miles and not a day’s march from Damghan. Again, the old road from Samnan to Hecatompylos did not go over the Ahuan hills, for from Arrian, Diodorus and Polybius it appears that neither Alexander the Great nor Antiochus III crossed any hills after passing through the Caspian gates C300GSB ''226 HID—HIM They therefore went by the plains south of the Ahuan hills, which is the road even now generally preferred by camelmen. This road is a few miles longer than the one via Ahuan and 144 miles from the Caspian gates would bring us to the neighbourhood of Frat where, without doubt, Hecatompylos stood. Between Frat and Qusheh there are many mounds, probably covering ruins, and a number of ancient subterranean water-courses lined with bricks. The people of the villages in the neighbourhood find most of their building material by digging in the mounds. Hecatompylos was the chief city of the Comisene district which adjoined that of Choarene (Khar). Comisene was the Persian Qumish, the Arabicised Qumish, the district with Damghan and Bostam. Even now the people speak of the riches and the greatness of the old city of Qumish (Hecatompylos ?) which, they say, extended from Qusheh to Frat. At Qusheh they say, stood the great gate and the Naqqar Khaneh {vide Volume I) and the Qumish river there entered the town. Innumerable canals supplied the town with water. In connection with Hecatompylos it may be interesting to give details of Alexander the Great’s forced march in pursuit of Darius—from Rhages Rai (Shah-’Abdul-’Azim S. of Tehran) to Shah Rud, where he came up with the dead or dying Darius. 1st day 44 miles. ^ 2nd day 34 miles. 3rd day 38 miles.

It is situated in the level p ain, which stretches from the Kuh Gundl range of the Shahand mountain to the Urumieh lake. The plain is fertile but somewhat scantily watered, the small str ams flowing from Shahand being almost entirely consumed in the irrigation of vineyaids and orchards at the expense of the corn cultivation. The large demand for dried fruits for exports has made the village rs of the district dependent on external supplies of grain. Less than a month’s supply per family would be found in the villages at any time of the year, and in summer much less. C300GSB234 ILI—IMA This would be available only at a very high price or by prompt requisition. Forage would be even more difficult to procure. Bhusa is used instead, and in autumn and early winter there would be a considerable quantity found stored in the villages, the winter supply of owners of cattle. In spring and early summer unlimited pasturage is to be found along the edge of the lake basin. Firewood may be procured in large quantities from the gar- dens and plantations. Water is everywhere procurable either in small streams flowing from Shahand, or by digging, at a depth of 10 to 15 feet.

Legend has it that he saved his father from being devoured by a dragon by calling out just in time “ Gur Gur”, which in Turkish means “ look, look.” The ground in the neighbourhood seems to be hollow and curious noises come out of it. There are also some springs of bitter and brackish water. A hundred paces from the hill is a little lake 200 paces in circumference and, as measured by Mirza Ibrahim Khan Nizam-ud-Dauleh, 40 feet deep (40 zar). The water is reddish.

It used to be the country bounded by Azarbaijan and Gllan on the north, by Kumish and the central Persian desert on the east, by Kirman, Fars and Khuzistan on the south and by Traq-i-’Axab and Kurdistan on the west. Its length was about 480 miles from the Kizil Uzun river to Yazd, its width about 400 miles from Gilan to Khuzistan, and it comprised the following districtswhich for administrative purposes were grouped into several sub-divisions, varying in number from five to nine :— 1. Isfahan— Extending east to near Nam, south to Yazdikhast, west to Chahar Mahal and north to Kuhrud, about the same as the present province of Isfahan. 2. Rai— Later called Tehran, the same as the present Tehran province. 3. Sultanieh— The present province of Khamseh, with Zinjan as seat of Govern ment. 4. Kazvln— Was the actual province of Kazvin together with the districts of Talish (which is now part of Gilan) and Saveh (which is now joined to Tehran). 5. Qum and Kashan— With Ardistan Gulpalgan, Tafrash and Farahan. 6. Lur-i-Buzurg— Great Luristan, the present Bakhtiari province. 7. Lur-i-Kuchik— Little Luristan, the present Luristan with Khurramabad and Burujird. Up to the end of 1888 Burujird with its districts was a separate province ; it was joined with Luiistan. 8 . Hamadan— With Khirkanin, Darjazin, Malayar, Nahavand, ’Asadabad. 9. Yazd— With Maibud and Nam. • Samnan, Damghan, Shahrud and Bostam together with Khar formed the province Qumish (old Commisene) ; Flruzkuh and Damavand were in Tabaristan and neither Qumish nor Tabaristan nor Gilan were ever part of Traq-i-’Ajam. During Fath ’AH Shah’s reign Qumish, with the exception of Khar, formed par^ of Khorasan, and the tower, which marks the frontier of that province on the west, is still standing between Deh-i-Namak and Lasgird. Although there is now no such province as ’Iraq-i-’Ajam, still it may be as well co say a few words about the great central plateau of Persia, which is practically what the old province was. The appearance of this plateau is almost everywhere the same, being entirely mountainous, with valleys of an indefinite length, but seldom exceeding 10 or 15 miles in breadth. The mountains, which are barren and devoid of timber, run almost invariably from west to east, and either gradually sink into the desert or throw branches into the provinces of Kir man and Khorasan. The valleys are for the most part uncultivated except near the villages, bu^ cannot be called barren, for the land in general is good. The mountain system consists, 1st, of-the Elburz range, which bounds it on the north and connects the mountain system of Persia with that of the Hindu-Kush and the Himalayas ; 2nd, of the Alvand and Kuhrud range, which runs through the centre of the province ; 3rd of a spur from the main range of Ardalan, which runs from south-west to north-east,238 ’IRAQ-I-’AJAM across the north-west of the province, and connects the Elburz system with that of Azarbaljan ; 4th, of the Bakhtiari mountains, which are an offshoot of the Alvand range. The province is essentially mountainous, and therefore there are no large valleys or plains ; vet between the different ranges are to be found plains of small extent. The climate is very various ; in the vicinity of Isfahan it is one of the most temperate, equable, and delightful in the world. Excepting for a few weeks of the year, the sky of this favoured region is unclouded and serene. Tiie rains are never heavy a d the snow seldom lies long on the ground. The air is so pure and dry that the brightest polished metal may be exposed to it without being corroded by rust. The regularity of the seasons in this part of Persia appears quite extraordinary to a person accustomed to a more uncertain and variable climate, for they perceptibly change almost to the hour. The northern portion does not enjoy so favourable a climate as Isfahan. The country about Hamadao is very mountainous and the winter severe, while the cities of Kashan and Qum, which are situated on the verge of deserts, are exposed to almost as oppressive a heat in summer as the count ries on the shore of the Persian Gulf. Tehran is liable to great vicissitudes of climate and is not deemed salubrious. Arrangements for supplies for troops can be easily made at any time of the year at the following places, viz., Kirmanshah, Sinneh, Bijar, Hamadan, Saqqiz, Khurramabad, Burujird, Kangavar, Daulatabad, Sultanabad, Khunskr, Isfahan and Shiraz. All sorts of supplies and provisions can be procured'in great abundance in these towns. Besides the above, there are also several smaller towns and large villages, where supplies can be obtained. For cattle and mules plenty of barley and grass can be had at these places ; sheep and ghi are also procurable . It is a prevailing custom in all the towns and villages in Persia, however small they maybe, to collect and keep a suffi cient supply to last for the four winter months. Firewood is the only thing, which there is some difficulty in obtaining, on account of its scarcity, but it can be procured to some extent in all the big towns by cutting down gardens and orchards. There are only two places where it can be got in abundance, viz., at Pusht-i-Kuh and Khurramabad, near which places are large forests. In consequence, the price of firewood throughout the district is high. One TabrizI man (=61 lbs.) is to be had for three shahls or about nine pies Indian money. Charcoal is procurable at Khurramabad and Burujird in great quantities, but is not so plentiful in other places. Grass fodder for mules is very scarce in the jungle, but for camels and cattle, fodder of sorts is procurable. The people store fodder for the four winter months. Any town or village is sure to have at least 500 to 1,000 khanvdrs (a kharwdr being 100 TabrizI mans=about 650 lbs. English). During the winter snows the animals are not allowed to graze in the jungles, but are brought home. As many as 400 baggage mules could formerly be obtained on hire at almost all the places mentioned above, by giving a week’s previous notice Kirmanshah is the principal mart for merchants and other dealers, and 500 yabus and mules can be easily purchased here for transport purposes. It isone of the most important cities in Persia, and kafileh roads to many places pass through it. At Hamadan and Isfahan camels can be purchased. There are numerous donkeys at all these places, and a Persian donkey wdl carry two Indian maunds weight. Persian mules can carry from four to five maunds. The usual daily march for a loaded mule is 15 to 25 miles, and for a donkey 10 to 16 miles . Sheep, as many as are required, can be obtain ed at every village, the price varying from Rs. 3 to Rs. 6 each. The price of a yabu is from Rs. 40 to Rs. 80, and that of a mule from Rs. 100 to 250. The rate of daily hire for a mule is two to three krans ; for donkeys and cattle one to two krans each, and camels two and a half to four krdns each. A pack saddle can be got for four to sixteen krdns, and 100 to 300 pack saddles can be made within a week, as there are manufac- turies for them in almost every town. At each village and town, good car penters and blacksmiths can be secured for daily wages from one to two and a half krdns. Two or more water mills are situated at each village, and atta can be easily ground, but previous notice is required for this. In this central plateau or old province of Traq-i- 5 Ajam, good water is as a rule plentiful, as canals, springs and wells abound nearly everywhere. There would therefore be no difficulty about water for a large force. There are fair tracks from village to village, and with a little work all these tracks, or nearly all, might be made available for wheels ; there is nothing to prevent the usual rate of marching. 1 IRAV— A desolate-looking village in the district of Biabanak, nortn of Yazd, 7 farsakhs west of Biyaza.

There is a large telegraph station of the Indo- European line here and a Persian line to Kirman. The town of Julfa is some 4 miles off on the right bank of the river. Description of city .—Isfahan is one of the largest cities in the Persian Em pire, and is the emporium of a large trade coming from India* Turkey, and Afghanistan. _ . It was formerly surrounded by a wall 24 miles in circumference, but this was destroyed by the Afghans and now scarce a vestige of it remains. The city is divided into 37 mahallehs and has 14 gates. All the gate ways are made of mud, have no outworks to defend them, and are only secured by clumsy folding-doors. The streets of Isfahan are n xrrow, dirty, and mean, and not less than one quarter of the city is in ruins. In the streets nothing of the houses is to be seen, all that is visible being a uniform dead wall. The entrances from the street to the houses are generally mean and low, except in the cases of habi tations of men in power, when the gateways are elevated in proportion to the vanitv of the owners. , . , , . r The houses are generally only one story in height, but are composed ol so many compartments that even the meanest of them occupy a consider able area. They are built either of earth or brick. The bazaars are very extensive, and it is possible to walk undercover in them for 2 or 3 miles together. The traders are here collected in separate bodies, which makes it very convenient for purchasers. On Fr day the bazaars are more particularly thronged, and the women on that day are to be seen in parties, going to the cemeteries on the outskirts of the city to mourn over the graves of their relations. The bazaars are all laid out on nearly the same plan as those of Constantinople. In them the confluence of people is certainly great, and if the crowds here were a fair measure of the general population of the citv, the whole numbers of Isfahan would swell rapidly, but as every one in the course of the day has some business on this spot, the rest of the city is comparatively deserted ; as the traders also have only their shops here and return to their homes at night, the mixed mul titude which throngs the bazaars, again scatters over all the quarters of the town and represents a very small proportion of its numbers. The women except indeed the very lowest class, generally remain at home, and during the day form with their children all the population of some parts of ^The Maidan-i-Shah, or Royal Square which Lord Curzon says is undoubt edly one of the most imposing piazzas in the world, is the centre of the city, but no longer presents the busy scene it must have displayed in olden times, i It is now used as a parade ground. The whole of its great extent, 600 pacess ' by 200, was formerly covered with tents, booths, etc., but these are now con fined to a few stalls at the northern extremity. _ Here still stands the majestic portico known as the Naqareh Khaneh. On each side of this square is some important building. The Masjid- i-Shah on the south side is still a noble building and the Masjid-i-Lutfullah on the eastern side is externally in good repair.ISFAHAN 241 On the west side is the gate of ’AH KapI, the most advanced portal of the royal palace which extends along the whole western side of the Maidan with a circumference of 3 or 4 miles and terminates on the far side in the Chahar Bagh Avenue. The principal object of interest inside the enclosure of the royal palace is the Chehil Situn {q.v.). Adjoining the Chehil Situn is the modern palace called Fathabad, built for Fath ’AH Shah, which is a very good specimen of the style and workman ship of the present day. The Chihar Bagh or Great Avenue 1,350 yards long, constructed by Shah ’Abbas, has been allowed to fall into decay, the trees have been cut down and the gardens are now a wilderness. Lately a carriage road has been made right through the centre of it and some good houses have been built on each side, some of which have been occupied by Europeans. Of the principal buildings in Isfahan, the college called Madrasseh-i- Shah Sultan Husain is remarkable. Its entrance is handsome ; a lofty portico leads through a pair of brazen gates, of which the extremities are of silver and the whole surface highly carved and embossed with flowers and verses from the Koran. The gates pass into an elevated semi-dome, which at once opens into the square of the college. The right side of this court is occupied by the mosque, a beautiful building ; the other sides of the square are occupied, one by a lofty and beautiful portico, and the remaining two by rooms for the students, twelve in each front, arranged in two storeys. There are 160 of these cells, but only 50 students. The city still contains 12 mosques, as many schools, and a number of baths, all, however, more or less in a state of decay. The famous shaking minarets must also be mentioned. There is also a palace on the Julfa or south side of the Zindeh Bud which is now r crossed by 4 or 5 stone bridges. There are 2 British hospitals in the city. Consula'es—At Isfahan there is a British Consul General with an escort consisting o c 1 I. 0. and 17 men and a Medical Officer, a Russian Consul General with an escor, of 18 cossacks and a secretary, and a Turkish Vice- Consul. The British Consulate consists of straggling buildings commanded on two sides. It would be useless to try and hold the consulate with five times the present number of troops against an armed force. The normal escort is one dafadar and 7 sowars but in September 1907 owing to disturbances it was increased to 1 Indian Officer and 20 sowars For “Administration”, “Communications”, “Transport”, “Military”* “Resources”, and “History” see Isfahan province.— {Curzon • Preece 1902 ■ Graham : 1910.) Climate.—S ulfa is 4 miles distant on the other side of the river, and here European inhabitants reside. The climate isdry and bracing ; in summer during the middle of the day it is very hot, but seldom oppressive ; the nights, with the exception of six weeks in July and half of August, are 'moderately cool and pleasant; the winter lasting for four months is often severe, snov T lying for days together. The rainfall is usually less than in the surrounding districts. The water-supply is chiefly from wells, and is of good quality. C300GSB242 ISFAHAN Isfahan and Julfa are remarkably healthy places, and were it not for the prevalence of epidemics, the death-rate would be very low, Europeans do not seem to be much affected by the hot weather, certainly not nearly bo much as in other parts of Persia both farther north and south. The following are the mean normals of observation at the station of Isfahan, obtained from the Meteorological Department :— . i Month. Maximum. Minimum. Wind Resul tant. Rain.

The final blow was inflicted by the removal of the capital and the residence of the monarch to Tehran. At present, 1913, its population including that of Julfa and other immediately adjacent villages is computed at 80,000. Resources. — Water-supply .—The water-supply of Isfahan city is excellent, coming, as it does, in numerous canals from the Zindeh Hud. There are also numerous wells, water being found at 10-12 ft. There are only a few Kandts. Trade .—The chief exports are opium, cotton tumbac, skins, hides and pelts, almonds etc., and gum tragacanth. Although the cultivation of opium has declined in the last 10 years and continues to do so (1912), it still remains the most important product for export. The principal imports in the order of their importance are cotton piece goods, sugar (loaf and soft), metals, (copper, iron, yellow metal), indigo (natural and synthetic), tea, silks, velvet textiles, kerosine oil and woollen cloth. Mr. Consul-General Preece in his report of 1900 states that British trade, if not actually decreasing, is stationary ; he attributes this to the supineness of the Government, antagonism of the Mullas, high price of provisions and bad communications. The customs arrangements, too, were an impediment, but doubtless now that the Belgians have talcen them over, this hasISFAHAN 243 improved. The real evils to be fought against are the mullas and want of communications. The Isfahan market serves as a distributing centre for the villages of the district, for the Bakhtiari country and for other towns in Persian Traq, and is therefore very important. British trade used to hold the whole market, but since the disturbances on the southern roads (1909 onwards) it has been gradually losing its position. In 1910-11 of 23,000 bales of cotton 22,000 were British and 1,000 Rus sian, and in 1911-12 out of 17,150 to 17,200, 16,500 were British and 650 to 700 were Russian. But later on in 1912, the Russians made strenuous efforts to capture the Isfahan market from British trade. The revenue, which up till now had always been lodged in the Imperial Bank, was lodged in the Russian Bank and Russian goods from the north were escorted to Isfahan by the Cossack Brigade, whereas British trade, owing to insecurity in the south, was unable to reach Isfahan at all. In normal times 65 % of the French sugar brought into Isfahan (valued at £ 160,000) is imported by British firms and 35 % by Russians. In 1910-11 these figures were reversed. The increase of Russian trade induced the Russian Banque d’Escomptes to open a branch in Isfahan in 1910. The inhabitants have by no means lost their manufacturing industry. All kinds of woven fabrics, from the most Industries. expensive velvet and satin to the coarsest nankin and calico, are manufactured ; besides which, many hands are em ployed in making gold and silver trinkets, paper and paper-boxes, orna mented book-covers, guns, pistols, sword blades, glass and earthen-ware. The sweetmeat shops, too, are a remarkable feature in this city ; these are very numerous, and the consumption is almost incredible. Silk and woollen carpets are also now woven in Isfahan with considerable success, ISF AH AN—(Province). A Province of Persia, formerly one of the districts of the province of ’Iraq-i-’A] am, roughly speaking lying between longitude 50° and 54°, and latitude 32°—34°. The Province of Isfahan extends in the north-east and east to the desert, in the south-east to Yazd and Ears, in the west to the Bakhtiari country, in the north-west to Luristan, Kazzaz, Kamareh, and Mahallat, in the north to Jushqan, and Natanz. In' A. D. 228 Ardashir, of the Sassaman dynasty, is said to have reduced Isfahan as well as Assyria, Hlstory ' Media and Parthia, so apparently Isfahan was in these days already an important place. In 1604 Isfahan was made the capital of Persia by Shah ’Abbas I, who constructed many fine buildings in the place, and originated a court which be came famous among foreigners for its splendour. In 1716 Mahmud of Ghazni advanced on Isfahan and defeated the Persian army with great slaughter. Mahmud then entered the city and sacked it, destroying most of its nobility and inhabitants in a series of appalling mas sacres.244 ISFAHAN In 1729 Nadir, after defeating the Afghans in Khorasan, pursued them to Isfahan, and defeated them again there. He proclaimed, himself Shah of Persia in 1736, and made Meshed his capital instead of Isfahan. Isfahan thus lost its position, for in 1760 the Zend dynasty made Shiraz their capital, and in 1779 the Qajar dynasty selected Tehran. After this Isfahan ceased to be closely connected with the most important historical events of Persia, but it still retained some importance as a trade centre. During the latter part of the nineteenth century the history of the town and province is closely linked with history of Zill-us-Sultan, the elder brother of Muzaffar-ud-Din Shah. He was the Governor of the province for many years, and distinguished himself by the cruel severity of his rule, so much so that his name still inspires awe in Persia ten years after his enforced retire ment to Europe. He owns a large amount of property in the province. In January 1909 Isfahan revolted against the Shah in fa vour of a constitu tion, and its voice was made all the stronger b} r the presence of large numbers of Bakhtiaris in the town. These in June 1909, under Sardar ’Asad, left Isfahan, and advanceci on Tehran, which town they entered on July 13th, in company with the nationalists from the north under the Sipahdar, and thus secured their coveted constitution. In April 1910 the British Consul of Shiraz was attacked on the road to Isfahan, and two Indian sowars of his escort were killed. In July 1910 serious disorders occurred in the town, and in February 1911 the Governor of Isfahan and h : s nephew were shot by Russian subjects. During the whole of 1911 and 1912 the surrounding country continued unsafe, and several Europeans were attacked and robbed. In Novemoer 1912, a squadron of the 3Sth Central India H rse was sent from India to reinforce the British consular guard at Isfahan ; but it was with drawn agair in September 1912 to Shiraz. At the beginning of 1912 Sardar Arshad, Bakht'ari, was replaced rs Gover nor-General of Isfahan by Sardar Ja’afar, Bakhtiarl, but the latter appeared no more capable of maintaining order. Isfahan being closely connected with the Bakhtiarl country and be.ng also the summer-he .dquarters of many of the tribe, usually has a Bakhtiarl Governor-General. In ihe end of Octo ber 1912, Sardar-i-Ashjawas appointed Governor-Gemral.— (Schindler; Graham, 1910.) Data are insufficient on which to base even an approximate esrimate of Population. t ^ ie population of the province. Persians compute it at 600,000 to 1,000,000 ; but this is mere guess-work. The chief supply of grain is derived from the districts of Chahar Resources. Mahall and Faridan. The amount of grain cultivation in the district is very large; \ azd and Kashan and some other smaller districts are supplied from here. As a rule there is a safficient store in hand to supply the district for two years at least. \\ heat is grown in such abundance that, after satisfying the require ments of the people, a great quantity of it is exported to other places, and the rate at which it is sold is from ten to fifteen krdns for one khartclr, oISFAHAN 245 about 100 Tabriz! mans. Kice is rather scarce, as it is sown in smaller quantity than wheat. The soil of Persians very good, and capable of pro ducing almost anything. For irrigation purposes, water from springs, canals, and nala • is used. The following plants and vegetables are pro duced plentifully, viz., toba-co, cotton, castor, pulses, peas, potatoes, cab bages, cauliflowers, beetroots, carrots, turnips, radishes, cucumbers and many others. Shaftal and lucerne grass for horses are grown in great quantities. The fruit trees grown are pears, quinces, apricots, peaches, plums, cher ries (of six kinds), grapes of different kinds, melons, water melons, almonds, pomegranates, apples of different kinds, figs, etc. The carriage of the place is done indiscriminately by mules, camels Transport ancl donkeys. The mules are mainly bred by the Bakhtiaris, who also breed very good horses, sturdy and strong, and wonderfully good on the hillside. Donkeys are bred all round in the various villages of the district. Camels are bred in the south and about the villages near the desert. Being in the centre of the high road from Bushire to Tehran, Isfahan is not dependent on its own local supply, but is fed by all the districts within those limits. For “ Industries ”, “ Trade” and “ Water ” see under Isfahan City. The official Army List gives the troops in the province in 1900 as under;— Infantry Battalions 3. Irregular Cavalry 1,100. Artillery 500. Of the above, the nominal strength under arms and actual strength under arms is shewn below Trade. Military. — Nominal Actual. Artillery 100 50 Cavalry 200 100 Infantry 800 400 In 1907 there were three infantry regiments attached to the Isfahan district. Of these one the “Jallahieh” regiment, with a nominal strength of 1,000, and an actual strength of under 200, was employed on guard duties. The other two relieved each other in garrisoning Shiraz, the men of the one off duty remaining at their villages. As regards armament, there were said to be 6,000 rifles (Werndl), many of which were out of repair, and four small rooms full of ammunition— probably the residue of a supply manufactured locally some years ago under the orders of the Zil-us-Sultan. There were 12 mountain guns, of which 7 were serviceable; one an old English muzzle-loader, the others breech-loaders (Euchatius). There were no horses for the guns, only 16 artillerymen, and scarcely any ammunition.246 ISFAHAN The cavalry force was 25 Persian Cossacks with two Officers, and some thou sands of Bakhtiari horsemen, quite irregular and not always present or willing to be used. Their arms are a mixture of ancient and modern rifles. In 1913 no regular army existed in Ispahan. The Swedish Gendarmerie was still in course of being raised in 1912, and had not taken over the policing of the roads. In 1914 it is expected that one battalion will be located at Isfahan. The assessed taxes of Isfahan amount to 3,791,202 Terms cash, 8,855 kharwdrs of grain and 6,000 of straw or about £ 100,000 altogether. The province is under the Administration. charge of a Governor-General and is divided into nineteen districts, viz., 3 tavlbeh, each under a hakim of governor, 8 Mat Ml, each under a hakim, and 8 bulaks, each under a Kat Khudd.

The Kirmanshah road to Burujird is closed during the winter, owing to the heavy snow-falls, but the other roads are only temporarily closed for Communications ; road. a ^ ew days and then are again open. As a rule, the Persians never travel during the four winter months, except on urgent and very exceptional occasions. All the roads that have been surveyed are good for troops, and are usually straight, and smooth ; even through hill passes they are comparatively smooth, but carts might have a little difficulty, on account of the stiff gra dients. Cattle and all baggage animals can go by them without any fear of injury, and short cuts and by-paths offer alternatives, because there are very few rivers in the country, and those that do exist are all fordable; only a few large canals have no fords. It is only during the rains that some difficulty is experienced in crossing these, owing to the depth of water ; but the big rivers that have plenty of water in them, can be crossed by means of rafts. The Ahwaz-Isfahan road, which was built by Messrs. Lynch (Persian Transport company) who maintain transport on the road, and are per mitted to exact tolls to pay for the upkeep of the road, has had a not Postal commission Customs labelaltogether successful existence. It is frequently closed for months at a time, owing to the depredations of the Bakhtiaris and Kuhgalus. It is not fit for carts and the scarcity of supplies along the road decreases its value as a communication. In 1903 the total number of packages despatched up and down this route was about 6,700. In 1906 the number had risen to nearly 20,000. ISFAHIAJS T AK— A large village to the right of the road from Tehran to Hamadan, situ* ated in a valley about 86 miles from the former.— {Taylor.)

It has 110 villages, of which only 3, Sirishabad, Qurveh, and Qaslan, have over 100 houses, is situated about 12 farsakhs east of Sinandij, and extends southwards to the Hamadan territory. The population is about 20,000, and it pays 71,204: krans taxes per annum. Its chief place is Qurveh (q.v.). Until about 40 years ago it wrs Qaslan, which is now ruined. The Chahar- dauli, a notorious tribe of robbers, reside in the buluk, and, as they are very unruly and disorderly, the Governor has no peace and must keep continually on the move, .and go from village to village. This is also partly due to the fact that he has no offici 1 residence. The district is fertile and has a few trees. Some grain is exported to Hamadan. There are a few mules in the villages, but no c mels. A portion of the Zand tribe resided in this district in the first h 4f of the 18th century.— {Schindler, 1902, 1910 ; Rabino, 1911.)

C300GSB250 ISH-ISM Between Ishaqvan and the. village of Chaman Isma’il is a range of moun tains crossed by a narrow ‘path, near which, on an abrupt cliff high up m t le mountain and facing the village of Chaman Isma’il, are to be found ; three rock tombs. The one on the right and the oue on the left are un- ornamented: The one in the centre is surmounted by a tablet, representing a arge figure of a man with hands unlifted as in prayer, and three smaller figures turned towards him. This is most probably an Elamitic sculpture. There is no inscription. De Morgan calls these tombs the tombs of Deh JNau, a village 1 farsahh distant; and believes them to be the tombs of some petty tribe’s chiefs. On the opposite range of mountains on the other side of the valley of Ishaqvan, )s a Farhad tar ash (so called from the legend of Tarhad and Shinn) on the smoothed and polished surface of the rock, which greatly resembles the one of Bisutun.

JAFS — A nomad tribe who live on both sides of the Turkish frontier as far south as Khaniqin, but chiefly in the Saqqiz and Sauj Bulagh district of Azar- baijan. They are considered- Kurds, though apparently more resembling Arabs, and are divided into the Qashqal, Sursur, BabajanI, and Avromani clans. They were formerly Persian subjects, but now acknowledge Turkish sovereignty. They are popularly said to be able to muster 35,000 horse men (5,000, according to Soane in 1910). The whole of the upland valleys ; of Saqqiz are invaded every spring by these nomads, and mounted parties make swoops on the villages of the district, all of which are perfectly defenceless, levy black-mail at their discretion, and recross the frontier before they can be punished. Notwithstanding the protests of the Persian Government, Merivan and the districts of Khurkhureh, Salar, Hubetu and Tilehkuh are, during five or six months of the year, occupied by the Turkish tribe of the Jafs. In contraven- tionof the treaty between the Persian and the Turkish Governments, the chiefs of this tribe, after having practically destroyed all the villages of these districts, purchased them and have retained possession of them During the time of their stay in Persia not only do the Jafs import and export all their goods and produce without paying custom duty, but they also help Ottoman subjects to import merchandise, specially prohibited goods, such as arms and ammunition and aniline dyes, without paying f ut V- These goods are then forwarded, under the escort of Jaf sowars, to MukrI, Afshar, Zinjan,Garus, Hamadan and vicinity of Sinneh. To stop the incursions of these Jafs a strong governor is required. It is said that a large amount is allowed every year to the Governor of Kurdistan out of the revenue of the province to defray the expenses for preventing the Turkish Jafs from entering Persian territory. TWiviamns of the Jaf tribe now (1912) recognised are as follows:— _ Be S (Walad Begl); Jaf-i-Qadir-i-Murld (or Mir) Waisi; and i W^h 1 ' , For further particulars see article under Qasr-i-Shirin, and also Rabinos Gazetteer of Kirmanshah '—(Gerard; Plowden; Uabino.)254 JAG-JAB JAGHATtT also CHAGHATG— A river of Azarbaijan, flowing north between Sain Kaleh and Sauj Bulagh and Kurdistan into lake Urumieh. Is crossed by the Sinneh-Saqqiz road between the village of Tomar Beg, and Saqqiz. It has a wide gravelly bed and is easily fordable in summer, but presents some difficulty, though never quite impassable, in the spring;— 1905.) It rises in the Kuh-i-Chahal Chameh in the Khur Khureh buluk of Kur distan, about ±2 /arsakhs noith-west of Sinandlj. It passes Saqqiz and the Siah Kuh and flows into lake Urumieh beyond Mianduab (1902) after passing the Siah Kuh it enters Azarbaijan. With the melting of the snows in the spring the Jaghatu frequently be comes connected with the Tatahu (Tatava) near the village Chilik, 15 miles below Mianduab. Boats are kept at Mianduab. Uchtappeh (7 miles lower down) and Chilik are used as ferries when the river is unfordable. The river bed has little depth near Mianduab and the width of the river there sometimes considerably exceeds | of a mile. At Uchtappeh the width seldom exceeds 200 yards. I could ford the river at Mianduab in December 1887 when it was 200 yards broad and 3-4 feet deep, but in January 1882 I was obliged to use the ferry at Uchtappeh. On the right bank 12-16 miles above Mianduab there are some canals for leading the river to villages and fields in the neighbourhood. (Schindler, 1910.)

JAJRGD DISTRICT— The district east of Tehran with the Royal hunting grounds. It begins on the west at Surkh Hisar and extends eastwards as far as the Karakaj mountain. Its northern boundary is the high road leading from Tehran to Firuzkuh past the villages Kimar, Bumahin, Riidahan, and Astalik and southwards it extends to the beginning of the Varamln plain near the village Hisar-i-Amir. The district, which is very hilly, is watered by the Jajrud river. The Shah made it QuruJc (private enclosure ; preserves) in 1862 and since then no one excepting the Shah shoots there. The Shah visits it three times a year and has great sport. Before 1862 the trees and brushwood of the district were cut for the Tehran market; this was put a stop to and some parts of the districts are now thickly wooded. Willows, poplars, tamarisks, and Bohemian olive-trees grow in the valleys, with almond trees and barberry bushes on the hills. The district being well sheltered on all sides, its climate is very mild in winter and the nomad Hadavand tribe make it their winter-quarters. About twenty years ago eome sand partridge (the Indian sisi) and francolin were brought here from Astrabad and Luristan, and two years ago some pheasants from Gilan and, what with red-legged partridge, geese, duck, teal, etc., game is very abundant. Of larger game the district has also a large quantity ; there are mouflon, gazelle and mountain goat. The district is also famous fcr its many panthers and cheetahs, wolves, hyaenas, foxes and jackals. The Shah has a couple of shooting lodges there with a number of little houses for his suite and some hammams .— (Schindler.) JAJROD river— A river which rises between the Shimran range and the Kasi Kuh north of Tehran and flows with a direction south-west in an undefined bed, more or less deep, to the plain of Varamin, where it is expended in irrigation. All accounts agree as to the extreme rapidity of this river, especially in winter, when it is much swollen by the melting of the snow ; it comes down with very great velocity, carrying everything before it. The lands irrigated by this river are deemed especially fertile and seldom change hands. It is crossed on the road from Tehran to Mazandaran 20 miles east of Tehran ; fording is attended with some difficulty on account of the rapidity of the current and the loose boulders in the bed. Its over flow joins the Kand and Karaj rivers south of Varamin ; its principal tri butaries are the Shakarab and Valayit-rud.— (Schindler.)JALALIS 257 JALALlS— When Tahmuras Khan-ruled over Gurjistan, seven clans of Kurds inhabited the country about Erivan and Nakjivan, numbering in all 16,000 tents, and called by the name of Jalall. When Shah ’Abbas took Gurjis tan he settled the Jalalls at certain places on the frontier. The chief of all the clans was a certain Pasha Khan Saiyid. One of the clans, the Misri Kanlu, was established at or near Erivan, from whom is descended the present chief of Maku. 178 years ago, in the time of Nadir Shah, Mustafa Sultan was Governor of Maku ; he rebelled and was killed, and Ahmad Shah, chief of the Misri Kanlu, was appointed in his place. From him dates the history of the family which has continued to give chiefs to Maku to the present day. The Maku Jalalis number some 920 tents divided into seven clans. The following gives the tribe in detail :—- (Murtazd Quit Khan.) Clans. Families or tents. 1. KhSna Kanlu .. .. 300 2. Birka Kanlu .. 150 3. Misrx Kanlu .. 100 4. Khundl Kanlu .. .. .. 20 5. Gin!

Sakhanlix .. •• 80 Total 920 Like all Kurds they have both summer and winter quarters, migrating from one neighbourhood to another as the seasons advance and the con ditions of grazing change. The winter quarters of the tribe extend from Tarim (Janin) Gaia, a village under Mount Agri Dagh (Ararat) and close to the Turkish frontier—to Kizilwang, a village on the Aras, a few miles east of ’Abbasabad. Between these areas they graze their sheep and cattle and live, as a rule, in underground excavations lightly covered over with brushwood and earth, sometimes occupying natural caverns, manv of which exist in the volcanic region round about Mount Ararat. The summer grazing lands extend all over the high plateau of Awajik and westward to Abagail in Turkey. During the summer they live entirely in their nomad tents. As a people, the Persian Jalalis form a small section of the large tribe of that name found in the Bayazid and Abagaia districts of Turkey, with C300GSBJAM—JAN 259 JAMALlBlD (1)— The valley of the Shahrud in the Kazvin district, from the Loshan bridge to Manjd.

JAMALI— A village situated on a small tributary of the Zindeh Rud, about 48 miles south of Khunsar. It is a treeless village, with bare brown walls standing at the end of a road, a vista of dazzling white. The Zindeh Rud • seems useless for irrigation here, as all the villages hereabouts are watered by tiny affluents, flowing through ravines terraced with crops. The snow lies deep here in winter and cuts off communication between the villages for weeks at a time, showing the elevation to be considerable — {Stack ) JAMLAV— A village in Azerbaijan, about 5 miles south of Guchl, in some low hills, about 2 miles to the west of the road to Urumieh.— {Gerard.) JAMSHURAN.—Mahldasht. It is situated in the middle of the plain of Mahldasht, at a distance of 1 farsakh from Dum-i-Zangalian and | farsakh from the caravansarai of Mahldasht (Rubat).

It is situated on a gravel slope from the north foot of the lofty range which extends from Farukhi to Jandak, and on which are the lofty peaks of Buneh Sada and Devi-Dun. Around the town, within a radius of 6 or 7 miles are a number of hamlets or mazra’ehs said to number thirty, each with its own cultivation and stream of water. Jandak contains a large and ancient fort bearing a strong resemblance to a mediaeval castle. It is in a dila pidated condition. It has a large door, which the people said had been constructed from the timbers of one of the ships that sailed on the pre historic Darla-i-Saveh, which is supposed at one time to have covered the Salt Desert. The place is well watered by no less than three handt streams. The revenue of the town is 250 tumdns, the adjacent mazra’ehs owing to an old law, paying no taxes at all. Supplies, sheep 6,000 and goats 12,000. There are extensive crops of wheat and barley. Bhiisd and grain are procurable. Firewood is abun dant, but has to be brought in from the sand some miles off. Transport 1,000 camels and about 100 donkeys. The best grazing grounds, where the transport, if not in use, and the flocks are to be found at this time of year (October), are in the Rig-i-Kaleh, a chain of immense sandhills stretching along the foot of the mountain chain north of Farukhi and Chah Malik, and between it and the kavlr. There is abundant graz ing and firewood, while water is procured by sinking wells. Jandak is the place at which a force, before crossing the desert in a nor therly direction, would collect supplies and rendezvous in small columns; these would have to advance on it by separate routes owing to the scarcity of water and supplies en route. — (Vaughan, 1S90.)

The population was much great er formerly but the district does not produce sufficient grain for the requirements of the present one. The inhabitants, particularly the tent dwellers, are wild and fierce, and ever ready to shed blood ; among the nomads or tent dwdlers, the Jafs are the most savage. The district is infested with snakes ; there are also many panther ; Selim Beg killed one and received a pension from the government of 20 tumdns a year. There are great numbers of pig, which the villagers hunt with large dogs called the Sag-i-har (m Persian means a mad dog, but here means fierce dog) the Tazi (greyhound) and Tuleh will not tackle pig.

Popularly, Juanrud, Joanrd ? etc. A large village of the huluk of the same name in Kurdistan, about 40 miles north-west of Kirmanshah. The castle on the hill 20 zar (70 feet) above the village, and a ynasjid and a hammdm adjoining it, were built bv Aman Ullah Khan-i-Ardalani in 1224 Hijrl. A large reservoir for water a garden, an underground watercourse, etc., are also of his founding • al! these are much ruined. In A. D. 1878 (1295 Hijri) when Prince Sultan Murad Mirza was Governor of Kurdistan, Mirza Nasr Ullah, an officer of Engineers, who had been sent from Tehran, came to Javanrud, laid the foundations in stone of -a new fort about 200 paces higher up the hill, burnt bricks, and prepared lime for further construction. In the spring he went to Kirmanshah intending to return later but in the winter there was a change of Government, and he was unable to cai.ry out his intention ; what he had built was abandoned and 4,000 tumdns (£ 1,600), which had been expended, were lost to the Government. The villagers took the bricks and other building material, and used them in construct ing their own houses. Some good cutlers live in the village. Ihe village stands on the right bank of a small stream running down kf 01 ? ' ra ff.-° f low Y ood f d g rass y hills which run along the south-west o t e Halabjafi-Kirmanshah road parallel to the Shahu mountains. Thecountry round is grassy, and undulating, and to the west rise the high peaks of the Saraban mountain and the Banigas range, 10 miles distant the country between being clothed with thick forests of dwarf oak. Water is abundant and the numerous channels show a large area of ground for merly under cultivation. The town now (1897) is deserted and in ruins having been recently raided and burnt by Habibullah Khan of the Jaf Kurds. It formerly contained 100 houses in addition to the residence of the Vakil of Juanrud, the principal landowner, and the Governor’s bouse. There was also a small bazar and some shops. The inhabitants are slowly re turning, the Governor, Sharaf -ul-Mulk of Sinneh having been dismissed and Navab Khan, son of Mushir-ud-Divan of Sioneh, appointed in his place. The feud with the Jafs is at an end. There is room for camping. Wood, water and grass are abundant. Some supplies are obtainable from villages a few miles off in the direction of Kirmanshah, and when the town is rebuilt should be plentiful. The climate is hot for three months of the summer, but very pleasant in spring and autumn, and the soil appears most fertile. Roads to Kir manshah, the Zimkan river, and Pavah pass through the town. The people fled with their flocks and herds to the Zarneh mountain. They are tenants of the Vakil of Javanrud, the chief landowner of the district.

The village is about 3| miles above the ferry on the north of the river. The place, known to travellers as Julfa ,is that chosen for the ferry which, though the most convenient for the transit of goods and passengers, is situated in a desert spot where supplies are scarce. The soil is impregnated with saline matter and no village has grown up. On the Persian side are a few houses of officials, the custom and passport officers, a good rest-house and sarai. On the Russian side are a few houses of officials, custom-houses, etc. Since August 1905, when the Erivan-Julfa section of the Trans- , r Caucasian railway was completed, Julfa ‘ &gt; ’ has increased considerably in importance, Russian troops have constantly been passing through, in and out of Persia. In March 1910, 2 companies of infantry, 100 Cossacks and two guns crossed over to Persian Julfa, owing to fear of a conflict bet ween Russian troops and the Persian Nationalists. In November 1910, 100 more infantry were sent over. At the end of 1911 Julfa was a subsi diary base for the five or six thousand troops sent to Tabriz and Khoi, and in July and October 1912 it saw more Russian troops pushed through it into the Shahsavan country and Khoi. There does not appear to be any large garrison maintained here. The road on Ahe Russian side is an excellent one with a carriage n service to Erivan. A concession was granted Communications. ^ by ^ Goyer Ae„t to the Russians [to construct a carriage road from Julfa to Tabriz and thence on to Tehran, in return for a loan of a million sterling. In 1911 the road was fit to take motors as far as Tabriz, and at the end of that year a military automobile section was employed between Julfa and Tabriz in transporting Russian troops to Tabriz and provisioning them there. The journey of 98 miles betv/een Julfa and Tabriz occupied 8 hours out and 11 hours back. The cart road has been specially constructed to allow of a railway being laid along it, and all the bridges are of railway type. A bridge has also been built over the Aras at Julfa to take a railway, and earthworks connect ing the Russian Julfa station, on the Tiflis-Julfa line, with this bridge were under construction at the end of 1911. In August 1912 Russia commenced negotiating for a concession for the Julfa-Tabrlz railway with a branch to Urumieh. It is estimated that the railway will be completed three years after construction is commenced. There is a tunnel, 1,200 yards long, to be made at a place 13 miles from Julfa, and a detour of 3 miles will be necessary at the Yam pass (8 miles south of Maraud). Mate-JULFi 265 tial is said to be collected at Kars sufficient to build the line from Julia to Khoi. . T ^ e Indo-European Telegraph Company have a transmitting offico m charge of an inspector, but messages are not accepted; they must be sent through the Persian Government office. In December 1911 a Russian radio-telegraphic company arrived at Julfa and established a system of wireless telegraphy connecting Julfa with Urumleh, Khoi, Tabriz and Maraud. The river flows in a low sandy bed and hugs the Russian bank. River. leaving on the Persian side a stretch of sand varying . with the season; in Nov ember it was about 100 yards across. The Persian bank is so low as to endanger the houses, which often suffer from the spring floods and run the risk of being swept away. The crossing and right bank are com manded from the Russian side by a ridge which, commencing at the ferry rises quickly to a height of 100 to 120 feet and runs parallel with the river for a distance of 1| miles. Russian sentries are stationed on the ridge, from which various fords are within view up and down stream. In Nov ember the breadth of water was 100 yards, depth 8 feet, rapidity of current 2^ miles an hour. The ferry is conducted by means of two wire hawsers stretched Ferries, across the stream, along each of which the water power moves a platform, 5 yards by 4 yards, supported on two small boats. The transit takes about five minutes. One platform and hawser are Russian property and convey passengers and baggage from the left to the right bank, the others Persian, and convey passengers, etc., from the right to the left bank. Wooden stages of a temporary character exist at either end of the haw sers^ A steep ramp on the Russian side gives access to the landing stage. The arrangements are very primitive and quite unsuited to the requirements of a great highway : during the summer, when traffic is at it highest, ani mals can cross by the fords a short distance down stream. Three fords exist above and below the ferry— No. 1 Ford. At the first bend, f mile below the ferry. Access from b , ot ^ anks _ eas T» for &lt;I 100 yards broad, with a length up and down stream ot 100 yards, depth 3 feet, bottom firm and shingly, giving an excel lent passage ; open during summer and early autumn ; difficult and dan gerous at other times. This ford is well known, and is marked by a quantity of heavy mill-stones obtained from a quarry in the neighbourhood. No. 2 Ford .—This is about 150 yards below the ferry. The banks on both sides slope easily; good sandy bottom, depth 3' to 3|-'; open summer and autumn, when it is much used for camel transport; dangerous at other times. No. 3 Ford.—At the village of Julfa, about 3| miles above the ferry at a point where the river divides into three channels. The crossin' is exceptionally easy and is closed only during spring floods and winter freshets. Below Julfa the mountains of the Kara Dagh and the Trans Caucasian impinge on the Aras, and such fords as may exist on the mountain266 JULF—JULG section are only of local importance, and do not appreciably afiect the strategical question of Azarbaijan. JULFA— Elev. 5,400. (Official name Julahleh.) A suburb of Isfahan on the south side of the city on the right bank of the Zindeh Rud. It is well known that the suburb was founded by Shah ’Abbas in 1604 who transported several thousand Armenian families from Julfa on the Aras ; hence the name. The present population is about 2,500 of whom 80 per cent are Armenians. There is a Church of England Mission in Julfa and a certain number of Europeans, employes of the Telegraph company and merchants. The Armenians of Julfa are a poor oppressed race, unprincipled, de ceitful, mean and much addicted to drink. There is a fine Armenian cathedral dating from the time of Shah ’Abbas, but the town itself has no pretention to architectural skill or beauty. The streets are narrow and only admit of narrow muleloads ; many of its lanes are entered by narrow gateways, closed at night. Narrow canals, lined by poplars, mulberry shrubs, low elms, etc., run down the centre or sides of most of them. The houses built round courtyards into which they open, and many of which are occupied by gardens well stock ed with flowers and well watered, are surrounded by high mud walls which give the place a most uninviting appearance. The houses are of mud bricks, the walls being 4 to 5 feet thick. Drinking-water from wells ; supplies plentiful and cheap. Plums, melons, grapes, peaches, cucumbers, lettuce, etc., of excellent quality and abundant when in season. The red and white wines made here are excellent. Grapes are so plentiful and cheap that horses are fed on them.— {Bell; Curzon.)

KALEH-I- Y AZDIJIRD or BANZARDEH, or LARDEH— A fortress in Kirmanshah immediately overhanging the town of Zuhab. This is the stronghold of Hulwun, to which Yazdijird, the last of the Sassanian kings, retreated after the capture of Ctesiphon by the Arabs, and it is a noble specimen of the labour which the monarchs of those ages bestowed upon their royal buildings. It is formed by a shoulder project ing west from the mountain of Dalahugird upon three sides by an inac cessible scarp, and defended upon the other, where alone it admits of at tack, by a wall and dry ditch of colossal dimensions, drawn right across from one scarp to the other, a distance of above 2 miles; the wall is nowKALEH— 279 in ruins, and the debris has fallen down into the ditch at the foot, but stil presents a line of defence of no ordinary description. The wall is flanked by bastions at regular intervals, and if an estimate may be formed from a part of it which still preserves something of its original character, it would seem to have been about 50 feet in height and 20 feet in thickness ; the edge of the scarp has also been faced all round with a wall of less dimensions. The hill itself is elevated very considerably above the plain of Zohab, perhaps 2,000 feet; the slope from the plain is most abrupt, and it is everywhere crowned by a scarp, varying from 300 to 500 feet. The north side of the hill is higher than the south, and the tableland of the fort, therefore, containing about 10 square miles, presents an inclined surface throughout. At the north east angle, where the scarp rises in a rocky ridge to its highest point and joins the mountain of Dalahu, there is a pass which conducts into the fort, the' ascent rising gradually from the shoulder : the whole way from the town of Zuhab is easy enough, but the descent on the other side into the table land of the fort is by a most precipitous and difficult gorge. A wall has been thrown across the jaws of the pass ; towers have been erected on either side to support it; and somewhat lower down the defile, where the jutting rocks nearly meet, two strong castles have been built opposite to each other which command the narrow entrance and render it quite secure against attack. Altogether this fortress may be considered to have been perfectly impregnable in an age when artillery was unknown. The description given by Dr. Mann of what he saw does not tally with General Rawlinson’s account as given above. This is what Dr. Mann says : “ Kaleh-i-Yazdijird. Near Zadeh, and overhanging that village, are the ruins of a Sassanian castle known as Kaleh-i-Yazdijird. It is situated at the summit of a precipitous rock, commanding the entrance of the Tang-i- Baba-Yadgar, which leads from Zardehto Baba-Yadgar, 2 miles distant. The Tang-i-Baba-Yadgar is reached by the Milleh Shatir on the one side, and by the Milleh Khat Kharmanan on the other. The castle, which I visited, is only accessible from one side by a very tor tuous road. There are large rooms, very like cellars, with very thick walls, and arches of doors or windows still erect; very strongly built of stone and plaster. The total superficies of the enclosed area is about 100 square yards. This castle commanded the town, called by natives Shahr-i-Yazdijird ; extensive ruins of which are still to be seen. I completely fail to identify the castle I visited with any of the two mentioned in Rawlinson’s description.”— (Rawlinson; Mann.) KALEHJEH— A village in Kurdistan about 2 miles south of Ruvansar.

Kalisa Kandi means the village of the church. The church is, if possible, better worth a visit than that of Daniel. One of the inscriptions gives the age of the older portion as 1,280 years. Only a small part of the old structure now exists, a remnant in a dark stone, almost black, surmounted by a quaint unadorned tower. The modern side was added by Shah ’Abbas. It is built in light grey stone, beautifully sculptured and decorat ed. In front is a porch of Norman shape held up by massive pillars of the darker stone. A white tower lends height to the church.

KARA DAGH MOUNTAINS (or “BLACK MOUNTAINS.”) This range lies between Sahand and Julfa in north-western Azarbaijan. Rich deposits of bituminous coal are found in this range. The coal-beds begin at the south-east edge of Tabriz, but do not get thick and valuable until half way between Sahand and the Aras river. Gold has been found, but not in paying quantities. Iron works, as far back as 1837, were erect ed by Sir Henry Bethune about 60 miles north-west of Tabriz for the purpose of smelting a magnetic ore found in immense quantities near the village of Juvan. A Dr. Riach visited these mines and spoke of the existence of tin and copper in the granite region of the Kara Dagh, The deposits seen by him were apparently so rich that he makes the follow ing remarks on the mineralogy of the district : “The district of Kara Dagh seems to be one enormous mass of the most valuable minerals, whole moun tains being almost, apparently, composed of ores, perhaps the richest in the world, of iron, tin and copper. Pieces of lead, too, have been found in a hill, in a situation and soil marking the site of a mine of the valuableKARAD-KABAG. 293 metal. It is not surprising that this portion of the country should be rich in minerals, as it is really a portion of the mountainous country of the Cauca sus, which is covered with mineral deposits. Unfortunately, both the coal and iron are said to contain quantities of sulphur.” In the present state (1891) of Azarbaijan when the chief transport is by means of ponies, camels and donkeys, it is difficult, if not impossible, to develop the mineral re sources of the country. Russia, in 1912, was negotiating fora railway line between Julfa and Tabriz, and it is well known that she intends to obtain a mining concession for the Kara Dagh minerals. In parts of the Kara Dagh fuel in the form of mountain wood is sufficiently abundant, but westward along the Aras, and in the mountainous district of the north-west from Mount Agri Dagh to Kotur, and on the south the country is devoid of tree life.

The Kara Su river is crossed here, and, at times when its waters are used for irrigation, might almost be passed unnoticed.— {Picot, 1894.) KARASt}— A village in Silakhur 8 miles south of Burujird.— {Schindler.) KARASU (1)— A river in south-west Persia which rises in Kurdistan, its principal stream originates at Ruvansar, where numerous springs pour out a con siderable volume of clear water from some rocky hills on the north-west border of the village. Two other small tributaries join it east and north west of the same village on the fertile plain of Shahabad 30 miles north-west of Kirmanshah city, it receives additional water from numerous tribu taries ; a little lower down it is joined by the Ab-i-Marak, which rising in the Luristan hills flows through the Mahidasht plain. A few miles further down it is joined by various streams from a place called Sarab-o-Lillu- far about 5 miles west of its right bank. The river at this early part ot C300GSB298 KARASU-KARASUN its course flows at a considerable distance below the level of the surround ing country, at least 10 and often from 15 to 20 feet below it. In conse quence of this, its waters are not used for irrigation purposes below Uramowar about 8 miles from its source. The country through which it passes is exceedingly fertile, while the banks of the river are lined, in many places for several miles together, with willow trees and bushes. Ten miles north-west of Kirmanshah city the Razawar-rud, from the Bilawar valley coming down via Kakhstan, joins it. Its waters are now more or less discoloured. It is full of fish which in places in its upper waters take a small gilt spoon. They average f to 2^ lbs., but there are others much larger; a few geese and duck breed in the parts referred to. There appears to be no reason why its waters should not be utilized for irrigation, at any rate as far as Kirmanshah ; the probable explanation is the disinclination of the, Persian to expend n oney in mansonry dams, and his incapacity to construct them, and also owing to a legend which declares that the river cannot be used for irrigation purposes. It is joined at a spot about 15 miles south-east of Kirmanshah by the Gama slab. The united rivers then flow south-west, through Chama-Miza, Gudapur, Tang-i- Fureh and Halallan to Saimara, when they join and help to make the main stream of the Karkheh.— (Plowden — Vaughan.) KARA SU (2) or KARA CHAI— A river rising in the hills near Hamadan, formed by many little streams and by the Rud-i-duab or Zarin Rud which has its source in the Rasvand hills. In the Karaguzlu district it takes up a number of tributaries, passes the Vavus Kuh and turns sharp to the east. South of Saveh it is dammed up by a fine old hand now much out of repair, near which it takes up the Riza Chai. It then flows due east to the bridge near Man- zarieh on the new Tehran-Qum road and the Pul-i-Dallak (Barber’s bridge) on the old road ; close to the Barber’s bridge it is joined by the Qum river from the south. 3| miles further on stands the bridge which was on the old road from Qum to Rai via Kaj and Dair, and 12 miles further was a dyke which kept the water from flowing into the depression called the Hauz-i-Sultan, this gave way in 1883 and was the cause of the formation of the new lake. The river is generally from 25 to 30 yards wide and on an average 4 to 5 feet deep with a muddy bottom. It is fordable during summer, but during spring months is swollen by rain and melting snow to such an extent that it must be crossed by a bridge. The greater part of the river, however, continues as before to lose itself in the Kavir. The Kara Su with its affluents drains an area of about 18,000 square miles.— (Schindler .) KARASUN— A tillage in Kirmanshah situated in the Bilawar valley about 32 miles north of Kirmanshah city.

KARA TAPPEH (2)— A small -village in Azarbaljan, 14 miles south-west of Tabriz.— (Schindler.) KARA TAPPEH (3)— A village in Mazandaran situated 3 miles from the extreme west corner of the Astrabad Bay, and 6 miles from Ashraf, on the road to Barfarush. It derives its name from a black hill, or mound, round which the village is built precisely in the manner of an old Gabr village, and has a very curious appearance. The houses are all slight structures of wood reeds, and straw, except one edifice of bricks at the top ; one side of this is peopled by Persians, the other by 125 to 150 Ghilzai Afghan families brought here by Nadir Shah—for what particular object is unknown. The inhabitants of this village cultivate rice, barley, and wheat, and their fields are neatly kept and enclosed by good hedges. Bread is commonly used by them, but the wheat crop sometimes fails and it is then very scarce. The people complain that this place is unhealthy in summer, and that the stream with which Kara-Tappeh is supplied with water being at that time small, it becomes strongly impregnated with the salt of the soil. In winter and in spring the current is quicker and, being also more abundant, the un pleasant taste of the minerals is hardly perceptible. The inhabitants of Kara-Tappeh trade with the Turkoman coast, owning six or eight large boats, and have also dealings with the Russians, whom they provide with live-stock wheat, etc .—(Vamhery ; Holmes ; Ouseley.)

The houses, though small, are neat and built in terraces on the slopes of the gorge, with the naked and scarped rock rising abruptly above them. Rich gardens extend up the defile and along the base of the mountain, which produce a variety of fruits (including the celebrated stoneless grape known as that of Karind) which ripens during the end of July and August. The willow and the lofty poplar attain a considerable size on the margin of a mountain stream that bisects the village, and is afterwards turned off into smaller channels for the supply of the gardens in the plain. Several copious springs issuing from the plain, which is here about 3 miles broad, _add their water to numerous mountain streams and form the sources of the Ab-i-Karind {q.v.), the north-west tributary of the Karkheh river.

KARKHEH— A river of Persia, which rises in three branches, all springing consi derably east of Kirmanshah. The first and most inconsiderable rises about 25 miles west of Hamadan, the second has its source in three springs on the side of Mount Alvand 6 or 8 miles south of that place. The latter runs south-westward till it meets the former in the plain of Maran, about 10 miles south-west of Kangavar ; and at a spot nearly 10 miles south of that place it is joined by the third, or chief branch of the Karkheh, which comes from the Girun mountains by a north-west course of about 40 miles. The trunk of the three united streams, under the name of Gamasiab river (of which the second above-mentioned may, from its northern and central position, be considered as the main branch) winds for nearly 30 miles in a general westerly direction on to Bisitun, chiefly along the Girun mountains. At this celebrated spot the Gamasiab receives the Ab-i- Dinavar coming from the north, and again, after a course of about 12 miles nearly south-west, another stream, called the Kam Su, passing through Kirmanshah at about 20 miles north-north-west of that place. The direc tion of the main trunk is nearly south, until it receives, at a few miles from thence, a tributary coming from the Guran mountains by a westerly course, and passing by the tomb of Baba Buzurg continues flowing in a southerly direction through Luristan and Khuzistan till it joins the Karim river, but this part of its course is outside the country treated of in this section, and will be found in “ Gazetteer of Persia, Volume III kArkhAneh— Pronounced Kardna, a village in lower STlakhur, about 7 miles south of Burujird and on the left bank of the Tahij nvex—(Schindler.)

KASHAN (Province). ^ The province extends to the desert on the east, on the north it is bounded by Qum, on the west by Qum, Mahallat and Jushqan, and on the south by Jushqan and Natanz. , „ Formerly a portion of Qum, it is now a separate Government; its taxes amount to £17,000 per annum. It is divided into two districts, the Garm- B ir (q. v.) and Sards^r {q. v.) (hot and cold districts), the former comprising the plains, the latter the hills. The total population of the province is 75,000. I^October 1910 the province was much disturbed owing to the depreda tions of one Naib Husain. The Persian Government, after suffering this man’s robberies for a couple of years, at last in 1912, made him Governor of the province. 1 i KASHIN—Lat. 34°; Long. 51° 17'-Elev. 3,300'. 51° 26' 39'. By telegraph from Tehran.—-(M. John.) A town 128 miles south of Tehran, and 111 miles north of Isfahan. Capital of the district of the same name. It is situated at the junction of t e Tehran-Isfahan and Tehran-Yazd main roads in a stony plain on the edge of the great salt desert which extends to the north. Lord Curzon describes it as being outwardly one of the most dilapidated cities in Persia, scarce y a building in repair and hardly a wall intact. , , In spite of local tradition which ascribes the foundation of the town to the wife of Harun-ur-Rashid, there seems no doubt but that it was m existence in the time of the later Sassanian Monarchs. From a very remote period Kashan has been celebrated for e c0 ^ mercial aptitude of its inhabitants, its brass and copper utensils, its silk manufactures, its earthenware, and its scorpions. In former times the silk worm was cultivated, and the deficiency made up from Gllan; a number of beautiful silk fabrics as well as velvets are still manufactured here. Kashan is still the great native manufactury of domestic copper utensils and is renowned for its pierced brass and coppe wares. The copper formerly came from the mines of Sivas, but is now imported in bars from England. nr- x.- The decorative art of mosaic work is known by the name of Kashi work, and has its origin here. . Kashan is celebrated for the number, size and venom of its scorpion, which are of the black variety.

The probable population is about 30,000. The inhabitants of Kashan have a widespread reputation for pusillani mity of character ; this may be attributed to their long connection with commercial pursuits, and to the enervating nature of their climate. Owing to the scarcity of wood, there is hardly any u ed in house building, arches being made to take the place of beams. Supplies of all sorts and water abundant.

The following account of the climate was given in 1885 by Dr. Odling, Climate an( ^ as ^ can hardly have changed it is given in extenso. Kashan is very hot in summer, and during this season people live in under ground apartments ; in June, July, and August the climate is very trying the winter is not very severe, but both frost and snow may be looked for. The water supply is from 3 Tcancts and from a number of excellent cisterns filled by the Kuhrud and Qamsar streams; some of these cisterns are 200 feet below the surface. Kashan is healthy, especially in spring. In summer and autumn, intermittent fever and diarrhoea, and in winter bronchitis, are the principal diseases.

The capital of a division of the same name, one of the divisions of the old province of Traq’-i-Ajami, 90 miles west-north-west of Tehran, 124 miles north-west of Qum. Its foundation is ascribed to Shapur II, who reigned A. D. 309—380; it was the capital of Persia in the time of Tahmasp, the last of the Safavian monarchs who was dethroned by Nadir Shah. History. In July 1909, on account of the nationalist revolution, and disturbances at Tehran, the Bussians sent troops to Kazvin. About 1,000 of these troops were withdrawn in March 1911, leaving a consular guard* of 77 men. In December 1911, Russian troops, to the number of 2,500, were again sent there as a lever to force the Persian Government to submit to Russian ultimatums. In April 1912 the number was reduced by half, but was again increased in 1913 to 1,625 men. Kazvin is situated at the foot of the mountains leading to Gilan and at the extremity of a fine plain. It is surrounded by gardens and vine- . . yards in every direction, so that nothing is seen escnp ion. 0 £ the town till it is closely approached. It is defended by towers and walls, which, like the rest of the town, are in a state of decay ; add to the neglect of man the fact that the town has been repeatedly overthrown by earthquakes, and it can be understood that it is not in a good state of preservation. The town has 9 gates. Samghan or Tehran ; Darbrai on the old Tehran road ; Shahzadeh Husain on the Qum road ; Maklavak on the Tabriz road ; Pambariseh ; Shaikhabad ; Gusfand. Maidan on the Rasht road, and Darb Kush leading to Alamut, Kuhistan and Kuhpayeh. There are 17 quarters, the most important being Bachman, Darbrai, Khandakbar, Maklowak, Gusfand-Maidan, Darb-Kush, Shaikhabad, Dabba- ghan and Sabalan. Three main streets, the Khiaban-i-Chaussee or Khaibar- i-Vapoor—leading from the Tehran gate to the Post House, the Khiaban- i-Alaghapi—leading from the Post House to Government House, and the Khiaban-i-Darvazeh Rasht—leading from Government House to the Rasht road, allow one to drive through the town. The other streets are narrow and tortuous. The houses are built of baked and unbaked bricks and the courtyards of most of them are below the level of the streets. There are cisterns in many of the houses and a few wells have been dug 90 to 120 feet deep. There is an Armenian church and school in Kazvin, a railway office and a branch of the leading and discounting Bank of Persia. There are two conspicuous mosques, one called the Masjid Shah, begun by Agha Muham mad and finished by Path ’Ali Shah, and the other of much older date, ~~*^Note .—No Russian Consul was known to be at Kazvin in 1912.KAZVlN 311 . i distinguished by a large dome and two minarets of glazed blue bricks, which are now partially destroyed. The population is estimated at 40,000 souls. The people are hardy and robust, and they are remarkable for having preserv- opu a ion. ec [ tpg ru( ie and ungovernable spirit of their an cestors. Among its other privileges, Kazivin, has always boasted of one of a very extraordinary nature ; it may be termed the right of insurrection or “ Lull bazar,” which is resorted to in cases of violence and oppression. The lower orders act on these occasions under the direction of their magis trates, who seldom proceed to this extremity, except when there is no hope of relief by any other method. Water is a very scarce commodity at Kazvin, and the vast plain is intersect ed in every direction by watercourses (Jcandts) which Resources. extend for miles. What water there is, is limpid and very agreeable to the taste. The raw produce of Kazvin is vitriol, grain, dried fruits, treacle of grapes, sheep and horses. The commercial importance of Kazvin is due to its situation at the junction of the Rasht, Tabriz, Tehran and Hamadan roads. Trade ' Considerable quantities of dried fruits are exported and were estimated in the year 1909 at dried raisins 100,000 puds (361bs.) ; dried raisins for distilling 300,000; almonds, nuts and pistachios 50,000.; apricots and plums 10 , 000 . 25,000 bales of 5 puds each of cotton were also exported during that year, and also 30,000 lengths of guts. The imports consist of sugar, naphtha, glassware, unmetalled goods, samo vars, crockery, drugs, mercery and hardware, from Russia ; Russian prints from Tehran; Manchester goods, Mexicans, and Table cloths, from Hamadan ; silk and cotton goods from England, France and Germany, via Constan tinople and Tabriz. The manufactures of Kazvin are velvets, brocades, and karbas (a coarse cotton cloth,) namads, swords and arms. It carries on a considerable trade with Gilan and (here are signs of a reviving prosperity. The new Russian road from Enzali to Tehran passes through the town; there are also direct roads to Hamadan and Qum. Communications. roa( j jj ama ^a n was i n working order in 1906. There is a telegraph station of the Tehran-Julfa Section (to Russian frontier) of the Indo-European Telegraph, with a branch line (Persian) to Rasht. The Indo-European Telegraph Office has no dealings with the public, who have to send their messages through the Persian Office.— (Chesney ; Lemm ; Gurzon ; Schindler ; Rabino.)

They were brought here it is said from Shiraz by Agha Muhammad Khan, These tribes are :— Ma’afi Yalilavand Kakavand Behtin ■ Kalhur Ghisvand Rishvand Amarlu Gi’an Chigini Families. 1,000 800 1,000 300 400 2,000 800 1,500 2000 Much wheat and barley is grown and exported to Gilan and Tehran. The Resources. greater part of the fields are ddimi. Peas, butils, beans and dover are also grown. There was a project to divert by way of a channel the Shahrud river to the Kazvin plain, but the requisite funds were not forthcoming. Garden crops are not produced on account of the scarcity of water. Tragacanth gum is collected and exported to Russia. The province is rich in sheep, goats, cattle, mules, and camels. There are only a few horses, and those few are imported. Bees are kept and excellent honey is produced. Trade. Good carpets of pure wool are manufactured and spoons and combs are made of box wood.

The above legend may be taken for what it is worth. The Khaman is recruited by many springs and streams in the Alishtar plain and crosses the Khurramabad road in three branches which unite to the south of tne ' road. It then flows through the wooded gorge of Jinan, where it is swelled also by the Kakurleh river. Where crossed by the Khurramabad road the principal channel is 25 yards wide by 2 feet greatest depth. The bottom and banks are pebbly and firm ; the latter require ramping for the passage of artillery. The other branches are of inferior size, being mere streams.

KHAR-DASHT (or Yakain)— A plateau in Azarbaijan, lying between Avoglu and Julfa on the Aras ; it is about 16 miles long and 8 broad. Through it in the direction of Marakand run the Zilbir and Kotur Chai rivers. The former, where it is crossed by the Avoglu-Julfa road, flows in a broad bed, 120 yards wide between low banks. In November the depth of water was 6 inches and brea'dth 30'. The Zilbir Chai, where the road crosses it, 3 miles from Avoglu, had a channel oTwater, 50 to 20 yards wide, 6 inches deep. The banks were 20' high. The elevation of the watershed is 3,160' and from here the road descends gradually to Julfa (14 miles) over stony barren ground. Want of water and salt-impregnated soil renders the greater part of the land barren. Between Avoglu on the south and Julfa, 29 miles, there is only one spring at 13 miles. This and the two rivers, both near Avoglu, are the only water obtained on the road. No supplies are to be had from the villages on the plain.— {Picot, November, 1894.)

KHOl—(Russian ‘‘Hoi”) Lat. 31° 27 '; Long. 45° 15 . Khoi, 91 miles from Tabriz and 95| from Kizil Dizeh, on the Trebizond road, is a walled town, a quadrilateral with faces of from 1,110 to 1,200 yards in length of bastioned trace. The bastions are small circular towers placed about every 80 yards apart, some large enough to hold one gun, and to give some flanking fire on to the main ditch. The curtain is in the form of a mud wall, 24' high. The interior wall is built up vertically from the ground level to within 8 ' of the top of the parapet, so as to form a road way, 6 ' wide, and which is in many parts paved with burnt bricks. The parapet is loopholed to give direct fire on to the ditch. The exterior of the parapet slopes directly to the main ditch at a very steep angle. The ditch is 50' broad, and gives out on an outer line of defence, of the ordinary field work description, massive and broad, with a good command. Small rave lins are thrown out at every 170 or 180 yards. The second ditch is about 40' broad, 15' deep, the escarp and counterscarp being at sharp angles. The parapets and ditches are in a very fair state of preservation, and would require little work to be placed in good order. The walled town contains but a small portion of the population ; out side, on the west, the suburbs extend for miles. On the south and east small quarters have also been established, so that the number of houses cannot be short of 12,000 (4,000 in the town itself). At 5 souls per house this would give a population of 60,000. Five gates open on to the town, access to which is reached by .neat wooden bridges over the ditches. They go by the name of the Chors (northside), the Mahalleh and Shawana (west side), Khiaban (south side) and Sharun (east side). All are supposed to be closed shortly after sunset. The Ark, a Urge walled enclosure, situat ed in a well-watered pretty garden, contains various official residences, the arsenal, etc. Water seems to be plentiful, and has been added to by canals from the Kotur Chai. The streets are broad and often shaded with trees. The central bazaar is covered with a brick vaulted roof; business was very brisk. English and Russian goods divide the market, the latter predominating. In respect to its buildings, streets and cleanliness, Kh5i compares more than favourably with Tehran or Tabriz. There is a Persian Government Telegraph Office. The greater mass of the population are Turks, but the Armenians still Population. retain some position in town and country. The Armenian quarter outside the town numbers 500 houses, with a fine old church, said to be 1,000 years old ; old churches, graveyards and324 KHOI other remains are still to be found in the valley.

Its valley, 18 i r le V 0n | i and ? miles broad ’ su PP° rt s numerous and large vil lages, well watered by the Kotur Chai and various mountain rivulets. It comes after Urumieh as an agricultural district, and, situated on the mam loads between Urumieh and the Aras, and Tabriz-Trebizond, it has become the chief centre of north-west Azarbaijan. Although surrounded by mountains, the lofty range of the Mesho Dagh on the south and the A\ arautDagh on the west, both covered with snow in November, and a high snow-range on the north, yet the valley is easily approached by good roads, and is well m touch with Tabriz, Urumieh, the Turkish and Russian fron- ’ akk- -u-T t?! -? i f r0Utes d ± ver g e t0 the Aras, viz., to Shah Takht, asa a , argiula^ and Julia ; two other tracks also cross the mourn aiI ^ 1 ' ) f weei i and Karaziadin, one by Siavas, the other by Chors^ useiul for mter-village communication.During 1911 and 1912, as well as for some years previously, Khoi had been the object of much jealousy between Turkey and Russia, la March 1911 there were 6 mountain guns and 3 battalions of Turkish troops dis tributed along the Khoi-Urumieh road. In June of that year a commis sion consisting of Mr. Shipley (British representative ^and M. Mmorski Rus sian representative) examined this frontier with reference to Turkish e croachments. _ , -.i t In November 1911 a Russian Consulate General, wdh a large escort (4,000) was sent to Khol to safeguard Russian interests. Turkey was obliged to withdraw. , , ^ , Mr M P. Price who visited Khol in October 1912 reported that officers quarters and a church were being built, that a wireless station had been erect ed and that the road from Julfa to Khoi was being used by motors. He estimated the Russian garrison at 9,000 to 10,000 of all arms. Although a rich agricultural district, if the artificial irrigation channels did not exist, the land would be a desert.

A town of some size on the left bank of a stream 50' wide, 2' deep (May) pebbly bottom, flowing in a bed 8 to 10 feet deep ; banks gravelly. It runs at the southern foot of the Hulwun hills and is a branch of the Qum River (vide Rudkhaneh-i-Nummawar). Khumain is on the direct route from Gulpaigan to Sultanabad (Burujird-Qum road). The stages are Gili 22 miles and Sultanabad 18 miles, total 40 miles ; it is one hund red and thirty-five miles from Isfahan. It is the principal village of the Kamareh district and residence of the local Governor. It consists of four parishes, 800 houses, population 2,000. Water is from the river, and 3 kandts provide for irrigation ; 195,000 lbs. of wheat are sown yearly. The taxes amount to 450 tumdns. Snow lies here for 3 months in the year. There are 3 caravansarais, 3 baths and 200 Karlas looms. The town belongs to peasant proprietors.— (Bell — Preece.) KHUMIN— A small village a couple of miles south of Qushehfa to the left of the road from Tehran to Hamadan, 146 miles from the former.— (Schindler.) KHUNSAR— Lat. 33° 9 ; Long. 50° 23 ; Elev. 7,770/ Ninety-six and a half miles from Isfahan on the Hamadan road. It is a long straggling town, built on the two sides of a ravine,' it has many lovely springs and is very picturesquely situated. The houses are of two and sometimes three stories, with quaint latticed windows. The ravine is full of very fine walnut trees. The hills to the west, above the town, are fine bold cliffs, with a good covering of snow. Down the centre of the town runs a fine clear stream, about 12 feet wide, turning many miles on its way. The streets and small bazaars are thronged with Saiyids and Mullas, the place has an evil reputation for religious fanaticism. It consists of six parishes, with 2,400 houses, 10,000 people, has five cara vansarais and three masjids ; 13,000 lbs. of grain are sown yearly ; taxes 5,500 tumdns. It is the residence of a Sub-Governor. In all directions on the hill sides are a mass of low bushes of a sort of thorn like an umbrella blown inside out with its stick in the ground. From these “ Manna ” or “ Gaz ” is got; whether this is the secretion of an insect, or an exudation of the tree caused by the punctures of an insect has not been definitely settled. The bush has been indentified by Major Sawyer as the “ Astra galus Ainsacanthus ”. The flat branches are covered with a secretion of a sugary nature. When ripe, sheets are placed under the shrubs which are beaten with sticks and the “ gaz ” falls on the cloth. The best and most esteemed comes from here, and is chiefly sent to Isfahan, whence it finds its way all over Persia and even into England. The Zill-us-Sultan in 1880 started the cultivation of opium, but it has not proved successful. A kind of cider is made of the apples but it will not keep above a month. The women of this place are celebrated for their beauty and vivacity. It is very cool in summer here, but the cold is probably exceedingly rigorous in winter, on which account perhaps the ravine was selected as site of the town. The Khunsar stream is crossed by the Guipaigan road by means of a good stone-bridge of a single arch.KHUN—KHUR 327 Transport, chiefly donkeys, can be procured in some numbers.

KHUNSAR— A pass over the Kuh Radian, traversed a short distance south of the town of Khunsar by the road Duak. On the southern side there is a vil lage ; on the western side, at the foot of the pass and half-way up, a small fort tenantless since the drought of 1879. On the top is a spring of good water. The descent of Khunsar occupies three hours, and the road winds so much among ravines and round hillsides that Khunsar does not come into view till one is within a short distance of it.— (Stack.) KHUR DISTRICT— Is a portion of the Samnan division. It is bounded north by the kavir, to the west by the Shurab district, and to the south by the Kotal-i-Jamal Khani, which separates it from the Yazd district. To the east it extends to the kavir, where it joins that of Tabas. It is practically surrounded on all sides by deserts. The climate is exceedingly mild in winter as contrasted with that of other parts of Persia. On an average it does not freeze on more than 10 or 12 nights in the year. This is no doubt owing to the low elevation at which it is situated and to the high ranges to the south and south-west which protect it from the cold wind. In winter the air of these parts is moist for Persia, owing no doubt to dampness of the surrounding deserts into which the drainage flows from an immense area. During the328 KHftR winter months there are usually clouds about, or else haze and mist. Snow will not lie except on the hills, and even there it rapidly disappears, except on the highest peaks. The soil, as might be expected in places so close to the salt desert, is salty, and the waters of many of the streams are brackish. The streams contain as a rule small fish, and many of them small shells resembling dwarf mussels, and exactly similar to those found on the seashore. The date tree and the tamarisk are the principal trees and there are also pomegranate and bitter oranges and limes. The date trees grow in immense numbers, and give a pleasing and verdant appearance to the towns even in the depths of winter. ; A curious feature of the country is the warmth of the springs. The Governor of the district in 1890 was Mirza Had! Hunar, the nephew of Mirza Ibrahim, ‘ Yaghmd \ He is a man of about 40 years of age, has read a great deal, and was most kind to us during our stay at Khur, where he resides. He is friendly and ■well disposed towards the English. The revenue of the district is 1,500 tumdns, of which about three-fifths is raised on date-trees alone, and the remainder on camels, crops, etc. The population numbers 10,000 ; they are chiefly occupied in camel driving, tending flocks of sheep and goats, mining, and charcoal burning. Supplies .—Cows 100, sheep 12,000 and goats 8,000. Fowls, eggs, flour, dried dates, and bhtisd in large quantities. Firewood is everywhere abun dant from low-lying swamps and from the ravines in the hills. Transport usually 2,000 camels, but last year’s drought (1889) killed 1 , 000 , about 20 horses, 2 mules and 1,000 donkeys. There is said to be considerable mineral wealth in the hills. In those - near Bayaha to the north-west of i he Gudar-i-Surkh lead ore abounds, from which 30 per cent, of the pure metal is extracted by a most primi tive arrangement. ‘ Zag-i-Safld ’ (alum) is found in large quantities close to the same town, and, when mixed with pulp from the rind of the pome granate, forms a deep and indelible black, which is used for dyeing clothes. The redness of many of the hills would appear to indicate the presence of iron, and there are ancient copper works at Ab-i-Garm.— (Vaughan, 1890.) KHUR (1)— Lat. 33° 47'; Elev. 2,655'. The chief town of the Khur district, and on the direct road from Yazd to Damghan. It contains about 600 houses, and is surrounded by date- tree plantations 2J miles in length and from | to f mile in breadth. The revenue of the town is 250 tumdns, of which 200 are raised on trees and the &lt; remainder on various other things. It is watered by five good handt streams containing fish and by five hauz. There is swampy ground to the north, north-east, and north-west of the town, which commences in a watercourse near Chah Malik, and continues on past FarukhI until it joins the great lavir on the east of the town. The banks of this creek or inlet are in many places covered with a dense growth of tamarisk, which forms excellent firewood.

About the year 1830-1840 it was one of the most prosperous and flourishing provinces in Persia ; but a series of extraordinary bad and rapacious Governors, succeeded by years of drought and disease, reduced it to a very low ebb. It was so out of the sight of the Central Government, that the complaints of the people were either not heard or else were ^The^ourney of the late Shah to the Shi’ah shrines at Karbala in 1871 when the people forced their complaints on his notice had some effect, and afterwards, up to his death, Kirmanshah had a share of his attention. Some fairly good Governors, years of prosperity, together with dearth in the adiacent province of Baghdad, have conduced to bring the Province o of its slough of despond, and about 1900 it equalled, if it did not exce,KIRMANSHAH 33T any other province in its general state, although the Government left much to be wished for. To us Kirmanshah has considerable interest, both politically, strategi cally, and commercially, and as years go on this interest may largely in crease. Strategical .—Strategically the province is of importance, and more es pecially the town, as it is practically the centre of an arc drawn through Baghdad, Isfahan, Tehran, and Tabriz, from all of which points it is almost equidistant. This has been pointed out by many military writers, notably by the late Sir Henry Bawlinson, as far back as 1847. History .—See article under Kirmanshah (town.) Geography. The province of Kirmanshah lies between lat. 31° to 35° N. and long. 44° 5' to 48° O' E. Its boundaries are the vilayet of Baghdad (Kaleh Sabzl) and Luristan Kuchik, or Pusht-i-Kuh, to the west and’ south, and Kurdistan and the Governorship of Kanga var (pass of Bid Surkh) to the north and east. The small Governorship of Kangavar and As’adabad have recently bee r added to the province of Kirmanshah. The province of Kirmanshah contains a great number of villages, mostly inhabited by Kurds and Lurs. It is known for its great production of grain and for its cattle. The soil being fertile, and water plentiful in all seasons, the greater part of the province is either under cultivation, or forms natural pasture grounds of large extent. The land is cultivated separately, each villager looking alter his own bit of land. On account of the numerous mountains, which retain the rain-water, part of the land is turned into “ dam ”, which does not require to be watered ; the rest, or “ abi ”, land is easily irrigated and without great outlay of capital; kandts are very scarce in this part of Persia. “Ddim” land is sown with corn, and allowed to lie fallow every other year; “ dbi ” land, or irrigated land, is sown with grain one year and with “ saifi ” (garden crops such as water melons, melons, cucumbers, etc.,) the following year. Mountains .—“ The province of Kirmanshah is remarkable for its parallel plains and mountains, which nearly all follow a north-west and south-east direction. From north-east to south-west the great ranges of mountains are “ Kuh-i-Delakhani, Kuh-i-Parrau, Kuh-i-Hulaneh continued by Kuh-i- Safid and Kuh-i-Galu, Kuh-i-Parkamarz continued by Kuh-i-Buzan and Kuh-i-Shlrak, Kuh-i-Dalahu and Kuh-i-Behlul (these two latter known by the ancients under the name of Zagros), and finally the Kalhur mountains, Nuh-i-Kuh, Kuh-i-Sumbuleh, Kuh-i-Anarak, and Shah Kuh, which are situated on the Turkish frontier. “ Mount Dalahui s the highest mountain of the Province, and its summit is always snow-capped. Between these various mountain ranges are usually extensive plains and valleys, where the greater part of the sedentary popula tion of the province is settled. “ The country between Hamadan and Zuhab is all mountainous, and forms part of the ranges bordering Iran, that is to say&gt; the succession of perk C300GSB338 KIRMANSHAH and valleys wliicli allow one to pass from the heights of Hamadan (elevation 1,870 metres) to the level of Mesopotamia (elevation of Baghdad 40 metres). This descent is gradual, and covers about 50 farsakhs (300 kilometres.) Frontiers .—The frontier of the province of Kirmanshah has never been definitely delimited, and if it had, would only be of theoretical interest, on account of the yearly migrations of the nomad tribes. The Turkish Customs together with the “ Regieh ” have built from Hurin and Shaikhan to Baghcheh, which is 3 farsakhs south of Kaleh Sabzi, eight towers, from which the frontier can easily be controlled. These towers known as “ kishleh ”, although placed at spots arbitrarily chosen, are accepted as marking the frontier. South of Baghcheh there are no towers, and the fron tier between Saumar and Mandali is formed by the Kumasang hills, but the Turks contest this and lay claim to the whole plain of Saumar. The tribes along the frontier are, from north to south, the Sharafbainis, Jafs, Muradis, Bajlans, G irans, Ja-i-Fath Beg, Sinjabis, Ahmadavands, Kalhurs and Aivanis.”— The villages of the province of Kirmanshah are, as is the case all over Persia either Khalisseh (Government property) or Tiul (Government pro perty granted for life to private individuals in lieu of pension), or Milkiat (belonging to private landlords), or Khurdeh Mdlek (belonging to the villagers themselves and divid' d up in small portions). Climate .—The climate is mild in summer, but very cold in winter; if the summer is abnormally hot, the inhabitants largely migrate to the hills in the neighbourhood. “ In Kirmanshah itself there is comparatively little snow, the cold season begins at the end of December and ends in March. “ The valleys in summer preserve a beneficial humidity, on account of the mountains which surround them. The heat is never too great, and the nights remain cool. “ In the Kalhur country and the mountains situated between the right bank of the Gamasiab (Saidmarreh) and the plain of Mahidasht, the climate is still milder, and the nomads find in the valleys well protected pasture where snow seldom falls. In the summer, on the contrary, they climb the highest mountain peaks in search of cooler atmosphere. “ The district of Zuhab is very pleasant in winter, but very hot in summer. The plains near the Turkish frontier are practically uninhabitable in sum mer. “ In the lower parts of the Kalhur country the heat is also very great, but these regions being wooded, a certain coolness of atmosphere is maintain ed. This applies also to the Hulailan, Balavand, Mahidasht and Gamasiab valleys.” In the mountains of Kurdistan the winter snows, and spring rains are so plentiful that in many parts the necessity of irrigating crops is preclud ed. For “Health” see under Kirmanshah rown. Population. The population of the province of Kirmanshah, outside the town, con sists of Kurds, who are both nomads and sedentary. They are broken upKIRMANSHAH 339 into great divisions or tribes, each having its own winter an 1 summer camping ground.* The chief Kurdish tribes in the province are die Kalhurs, Gurans, Kuliai, Sinjabi, Karindi, Zanganeh and Aivanis. All these Kurdish tribes used to be in far more affluent circumsfanoes, yet now, with reduced numbers and greater poverty, they are mulcted to a far greater extent than they were before.

Some people mention the population as 350,000, but it must be borne in mind that this is only an approximation, as it is very difficult to get at exact figures in Persia. The tribesmen will always return their tribe at a lower figure, as they are afraid that the taxes may be levied for a large number of families if they were to give an exact figure, which is even for them very difficult to get at. The nomad Kurds in winter have little to do in their villages, or settle ments. They gather in the largest tent or house of the settlement, and there, surounded by camels and cows, they listen to their mallat, or learned one, who reads out to them Kurdish poems. The Kurdish literature dates some 300 years back.340 K1RMANSHAH Some families in each tribe or settlement are known as Chupankera or Galladar (i. e., shepherds), Assalbor (f. e., honey-gatherers), etc., and the le names are often erroneously given as names of branches of tribes. Resources. Supplies. —The grain crop (ghalleh) is usually composed of one-third barley and two-thirds wheat. Much wheat is exported to the interior of Persia by camelmen, who, having no goods to transport for the return journey, buy wheat and barley of their own account and sell it wherever profitable, thus paying for the keep of their camels aird making a small profit. The usual output of grain of the province of Kirmanshah is roughly esti mated at 200,000 kharwors. In 1902 the charges on exporting grain to Baghdad were three times as much as the grain was worth on the spot; but as this was so little, a profit could be made on exporting. The following tribes and districts each provide 20,000 kharw~rs or more towards the total output of grain : Kalhurs, Mahidasht, Guran, Sunqur and Kullai, Qasr-i-Shlrln and Zuhab, and As’adabad and Kangavar. The total output of rice is about 16,000 kharwars, derived from Raziaa, Bilavar, Dinavar, Chamchamal, and Zuhab. About 10,000 kharwirs of peas (nakhud) are also produced. The other agricultural products of the province are :—maize, clover, castor oil plant, cotton, indigo and opium. Garden crops, such as melons, water melons, cucumbers, egg plants, tomatoes are also grown for local consump tion. Fruits are abundant during the fruit season. The fruit of Kanduleh, HarsTn and Sahneh is famous, and is brought to town for sale. Karind has excellent grapes; dried figs from Rijab are well known, and Gavarreh at one time had fine apples. Oranges and lemons are received from Mandalt, Turkey. Trees. —The usual trees of the plain of Kirmanshah are the willows, poplars, oriental plane and walnut, and the fruit trees of Northern Europe. Palm trees are to be found in the gardens of Sar-i-Pul-i-Zuhab and Qasr-i- Shirin. In the mountains one finds oak, elm. sycamore and some small coniferous trees. In the mountains near Hulailan are the following trees :— Crataegus^ Ficus, Daphne Acuminata B. ei Hoh, Quercus Persica, Acer, Lonicera, Prunus Mahaleh, Pistacia Kinjuk, Amygdalus Kotechyi Storks, etc. The flora is varied, and occasionally rare specimens are to be found. Game. —Bear, wolf, wild goat, gazelle, partridge, small partridge (taihu), sand grouse, geese, duck and other birds of passage, such as the small and large bustard, woodcock, snipe, double snipe, quail, etc., are abundant in this province. The rivers Kara Su and Gamaslab have also fine fish. Wool. —“After wheat one of the next largest products of the country is wool. The vast flocks of Kurds and Lurs, grazing all over the green hills of these countries, supply a great quantity of fair quality wool, which might be vastly improved by a little care inbreeding. It is, however, mainly used in various industries in which the women only are employed, such as carpet weaving, etc. Tent covers, saddle-bags, and ropes are also manufacturedkirmanshah 341 out; of it, and yarns, which are exported to ’Iraq and Luristan, yet when all these requirements are fulfilled about 1 , 000,000 lbs. of wool are exported via Baghdad. Little care is taken in cleaning the wool, and there are no presses in the place, either hand or hydraulic, so that the bales are bulky, and, in consequence, the export is all done by means of camels.” Tobacco is grown in sufficient quantities to allow of some being exported. Gum is collected and exported, chiefly to London. The carpet industry, which used to thrive, has now (1902) almost ceased to exist. Aniline dyes are used. Transport .—Mules and horses are bred in great numbers. There are extensive pasture lands, and forage is plentiful. The horses, when well bred, have much Arab blood, and fetch good prices. The mules are strong, and most of the charvaddrs apply to this province for their requirements. To buy horses one has to go to the tribes, as few are brought to Kirmanshah for sale, and few are exported via Baghdad, on account of the heavy duty charged by the Turkish authorities. Mules up to the age of four years can be bought in the villages ; past that age they are taken over by charvaddrs for transport. A good, fully deve loped mule fetches 50 to 100 tumdns. Kirmanshah was for many years famous for its horses, but the breeding is not what it used to be. From 50 to 100 Arab horses are brought every year from Baghdad by pilgrims. Prices range from 30 £ T. to 100 £ T. These horses are seldom offered for sale. Horses are bred by the Sinjabis, Kalhurs and Kuhals ; and in Kurdistan and a few of the villages. The Kalhurs, having many horsemen, have not many horses for sale. They dispose of a few to the pilgrims passing from Kirmanshah, to Khaniqln, or vice verso. The Sinjabi horses have much Arab blood, and, although rather small, are better than other horses of the province. The Sinjabis are said to have about 1,000 horses and mares, producing yearly 200 foals. They are good for draught and as beasts of burden. The Kuliais have sonn 500 to 600 horses, producing yearly about 100 colts. Their horses are said to be not very strong. They occisionally buy mares for breeding purposes from the Jafs and Khazals. Colts having good blood fetch, when one or two years old, from 20 to 30 tumdns. Those from the Jafs are sold at 40 to 50 tumdns. One to two- year old Yabus ” can be bought at 15 to 16 tdmdns. An ordinary horse, four to five years old, can be bought amongst the tribes at from 30 to 40 turn'ms. The best season for buying horses and mules is about one month after the feast of Nauruz (March 21st). In winter, on account of the great demand for transport, horn s and mules are expensive. Young horses intended for caravan work are accustomed, when three to four years old, to carry loads. 50 maunds is a usual load for a fully develops d horse, but up to 70 maunds is sometimes carried. The usual lifetime of a horse is 15 to 20 years. The cost of shoeing a horse is 4 krdns ; if inferior quility shoes be used, the price is only 2| krdns. The shoe, in universal use, consists of a thin plate of iron, about to 1 |- inches wide, hammered to the shape of a hoof, which it nearly covers ; and is fastened on by four or six large-headed nails. They last for about 10 weeks.342 KIRMANSHAH Mulea are bred by the Sinjabis, Kuliais, Kalhurs, in Kurdistan, and in Harasam and near Kirmanshah. Some 2,000 to 3,000 mules are produced yearly, in the province. All the mules are produced by mares. A one-year old mule fetches from 30 to 50 tumdns. A good three-year old mule costs from 70 to 80 tumdns ; although mules of that age are also to be got for 55 tumdns, they are not then so well-developed. When three to four years old, the mule is accustomed to carry loads of 20 maunds; from four to five it carries from 35 to 40 maunds and when five, 50 to 60 maunds. The usual load is consequently 320 to 390 lbs.; this load the mule carries a distance of 20 to 30 miles, day after day. The lifetime of a mule is 20 to 30 years. Shoeing costs 3 krdns. The cost of a com plete pack-saddle for a mule is 14 tumdns. As a headquarters for mule purchase the town of Kirmanshah is well situated as it commands two sources. The west and north-west where the mule is of the SanjaVi str dn and Luristan. Within a radius of some 50 mik s to the south-west of the city the largest breeders or dealers in mules are the Kalhurs (q.v.) who have droves of mules between the ages of 18 and 36 months, up to 500-600 animals. The Ilkhani of the Kalhurs is probably the largest owner of mules in Persia. Riding donkeys, used by the mullas (priests) and merchants, are got from Halleh, Baghdad, S Iraz, Yazd and Kirman, and fetch from 25 to 50 tumdns. The ordinary small black or grey donkey, kept by the villagers and tribesmen, and supplying the means of transport for local produce, is bred in the province and fetches from 10 to 25 tumdns. Every village has from 10 to 50 of these donkeys. Shoeing costs 1 • 50 fcrans. A kharvdr is said to be the load of three donkeys. The usual load is consequently a 1 out 216 lbs. for a donkey. No camels are bred in the province of Kirmanshah. From 2,000 to 3,000 camels come here every year from Isfahan, Qum, Yazd, and Kashan ; and carry goods from here to Tehran or Isfahan, or return without loads. Arab camel- men come from Baghdad and take loads to Hamadan, and occasionally some direct to Tehran. They usually take no loads for the return journey, except during the wool season. They also take grain to Turkey and sometimes, but very rarely, a few cases of gum. Cattle .—A certain number of cows and oxen are bred in the province, but the Kirmanshah peasantry have, however, to import cows and oxen from Luristan. The nomads, who use cows and oxen, not only to plough their fields but also to carry their tents and belongings, seldom, if ever, part with them. Beef in Kirmanshah is good. Oxen, which refuse to carry the yoke, are given over to the slaughter house. Herds of goats are to be found in the mountainous districts of Kirmanshah; goats’ hair is used in the manufacture of tents. Goat-skins are either dried for export to Baghdad and Marseilles, made up into coverings for gl~, or turned into water skins or “ mashaks ”, of which every nomad family has at least two or three. Sheep are plentiful in the province of Kirmanshah, and form part of the wealth of the nomads. Wool is exported in large quantities an d a considerable amount of gh~ is produced; but Government usually prohibits the exportation of gU to the interior of Persia. Permits could be obtained in 1902 by theKIRMlNSHAH 343 payment of 50 krdns per Tdiarwdr. The Kurds of the mountains and province of Kirmanshah, in a great degree, supply the Tehran, Hamadan, Qum and Baghdad markets with sheep. To these places they drive whole flocks destined for s de, but of late they prefer selling their flocks in Turkey. Minerals. Ike mineral resources of the province are marble, plaster, lime, coal and naphtha oil. In the lower valley of the Kirmanshah province, near the Turkish frontier, their exists a wide oil belt which extends south, from Karkuk in Turkey to Shushtar in Per ia and even to the island of Hormuz; following a north-west to south-east direction. The principal oil fields of the province of Kirmanshah are those of Chiah Surkh, Qasr-i-Shirin, Shah Murad, Karim Khan and Bazargar, Hurin, Gahwarreh and Shlan. There are also indications of naphtha at other locali ties. From the numerous ancient cemeteries and fine temples one comes across in these districts, it is evident that the extraction of the oil has been carried on since the remotest antiquity, and, to this day, the Kurds get the oil in what must have been the most ancient way of obtaining naphtha. There is usually a well, some 24 feet deep, in the shape of a funnel the top being 15 to 30 feet wide and the bottom 10 feet. At the bottom is a wood en platform, giving access to two smaller wells, some 30 feet deep. In these wells salt water and naphtha collects. The wells are emptied every five or six days by means of a bucket. The salt water is turned into tanks for evaporation, and the salt is sold in Qasr-i-Shirln at 1 krdn a batman. The 0 tj w ? 1 i c ^ 3 ' ^tches at the well 4 krdns per 4 imperial gallons or tin (32 lbs. British), is taken to the still, which is now in Karim Khan’s village on the Kuretu river. The capacity of the still is only 70 imperial gallons ° f charge 35 gallons of lamp oil are produced. This oil is sold at the still to the Qasr-i-Shlrln Jews, at 7f to 8 krdns per tin of 4 imperial gallons and is re-sold in Qasr-i-Shlrln, at 10 krdns a tin. Trade.—-There are but few towns in Persia which show to-day so flourish ing a condition from a trade point of view as Kirmanshah, and this in spite of oppression by the local governors and the badness and lack of safetv on the roads radiating from it. ^ Kirmanshah is the port of entry for all goods entering Persia from Bagh dad coming from England and India via the Persian Gulf and the Tigris It is practically the only route available for Western Persia, now that the n ° !? nger be 1 relied u P on ’ Su PPlyfeg such districts as K ruistan, Hamadan, Iraq, and even competing seriously with the trade of the European merchants in Isfahan. At one time a certain portion of the trade filtered down from Tabriz, but now very little comes through h t town such Russian goods as naphtha, glassware, and hardware as t 6 foot ® i m the baZars come md Hamadan from Rasht. n 1885 the totaf number of loads coming in from Baghdad was in round figures, 33,700 loads, whilst in 1897 the amount passing through the customs was 73 950 loads, the great increase being in Manchester piece-goods, which had risen from 8,000 to 22,000 load S g But even this does not show what really came into the country. The administration of he customs was very slack and evasions were numerous, the farmer los- g arge y on his speculation. A syndicate of merchants was formed in344 KIRMANSHAH 1897 to take over the customs and with a view of seeing what they could give caused a searching enquiry as to the imports and exports of the three previous years. An average was struck, the result of which is shown in the table of imports. In the bazaars about 2,000Z. sterling in bills is required weekly for re mittances to England. There are six first-class merchants dealing with London, Bombay, and Baghdad who have a bazaar credit of over 100,000k, and are supposed to have property to an equal amount; another 10 whose credit equals some 25,000k deal only with Baghdad and Persia ; besides these there are a number of what may be called second-class merchants, who also deal with Baghdad and Persia generally, but only in a small way, each having a credit to the extent of 1 , 000 k to 2 , 000 k Kirmanshah lies on the direct road for all pilgrims to and from Persia to the Shi’ah shrines of Najaf and Karbala. During the course of the year from 150,000 to 200,000 pass through the town ; they bring money to exchange, or also try to pay their way by selling things, and so gener ally add to the well-being of the town. Imports .—The chief imports into Kirmanshah are shown in the follow- table. The values were calculated by a syndicate in 1897 on the average years :— e Sugar .. 70.000 From Marseilles.

Russian steamers irom Udessa to Basrah but m 1912 no Russian goods had reached Kirmanshah by this route. One firm was said to import their goods for the Tehran market through Baghdad and Kirmanshah finding it the more expeditious, though dearer route, but this can hardly apply for 1911-12 when, owing to disturbances’ this route was closed for months at a time. The exports irom Kirmanshah to Baghdad, taking an average for three years (95—97), were as follows :— Carpets Gum tragacanth Skins Wool Dried fruits Opium Black tents iRoghan (clarified butter) £ 14.000 54.000 6,400 24.000 7,800 18.000 2,000 14,500 Total .. 138,600 Of the exports the following countries usually take the largest share In 1901 the United Kingdom and India had £120,000, France £38 575 (silk) and Turkey in Asi_a £3_8,553. It is difficult to gauge the countries of destination at Kirmanshah, as everything is forwarded to Baghdad and distributed from there. 5 The latest figures show the total exports to Baghdad as follows : 1907- 08 1908- 09 1909- 10 1910- 11 1911- 12 1912- 13 £ .. 230,679 .. 304,045 .. 321,662 .. 280,188 .. 206,699 • • 302,087 This does not include exports to Hama dan and the north. Military. The nominal strength of the army of the province of Kirmanshah is four regiments of 800 men each and 150 artillerymen, and some 400 to 500 ir regular cavalry. But these only exist on paper, and in 1912 none were available for Government, C300GSB346 KIRMINSHAH The regiments in 1902 were— Kalhur : chief of regiment, Muhammad ’All Khan ) colonel, Samsam-us Sultan Mirpanj, nephew of Muhammad ’All Khan. Karind : chief of regiment, ’Ali Murad Khan, Ihtasham-ul-Mamalak. Guran : chief of regiment, Husain Khan, Mans\p&gt;ul-Mulk. Zanganeh : chief of regiment, Muhammad Riza Khan Zanganeh, Zahii ul-Mulk. The artillery is under the Zahir-ul-Mulk. Further information as to the composition of these regiments will be found in the chapters dealing with tribes. The following is the irregular cavalry paid for by the Government. Sinjabi -- •• •• 200 Ahmadavand Nanekali Sharafpaim Bajlan 150 60 100 150 It is only of late that the Bajlans and Sharafbainis have been subsidized by the Government for the keep of their sowars. The pay for the above was allowed for by the Central Government, and taken care for in the provincial accounts, but very few of the men were really entertained. The Chiefs of the tribes, which should supply these various forces gave the Governor receipts for the amounts due on account of the pay of the men, but no money passed ; this is the way the Chief pays for his position of Governor of the tribe and General of the Regiment, and the sum withheld forms a portion of the provincial Governors “ Mudakhil ’’(perquisite). Food for the soldiers was distributed at the rate of one-and-a-half seers of bread each, per diem. Their pay was only seven Jcrdns, equal to Rs. 2-13-0 per mensem, and if they worked daily, they got 10 Irdns (equal to one tumdn), or Rs. 4 per month. The officers of these regiments misappropriated a good portion of their men’s pay. When the soldiers are at their own houses, they do all sorts of works ; some are chamdrs, others, carpenters, bakers, butchers, etc., there is no restriction whatever against their carrying on business. The sowar gets 15 tumdns per annum when employed, when not employed he gets only 3 tumdns per annum. , The numbers of sowars to be furnished by the tribes, and the tribes from which they have to be furnished, are questions settled by the Governor of Kirmanshah, and altered at his will. ^ . There is always in Kirmanshah a regiment, which is not from the province , garrisoned in the town. It is rare to find more than 500 soldiers under arms. They are armed with Werndl rifles, which they have to return to the arsenal when disbanded. In 1911-12 it was difficult to compute the fighting strength of Govern ment troops at Kirmanshah, as the town was continually, changing hands between Salar-ud-Dauleh’s adherents and Government troops, which consisted apparently only of Fiddis and Bakhtiaris sent rom e a In January 1913, it was reported that 150 cossacks, trained men with a maxim, had left for Tehran, the Governor having to maintain his authority in their absence with some 300 Sarbazes and about the same number oi levies, who were armed with rifles of obsolete pattern. The tri esmen, on the other hand, were reported to have some three to four thousand repeating rifles besides ordinary onesjKIRMANSHAH 347 There is an arsenal built on an eminence in the middle of the town, by Tmad-ud-Dauleh, a former governor. It is not defensible as it is behind the palace, and surrounded by shops. , . f Road Guards .—A few road guards are furnished by some of the villages on the road to Baghdad and that to Hamadan. They are armed with Martini-Henry rifles. Tribal .—In 1902 the following list was given of the forces the respective tribes could turn out in case of need :— Zanganeh Kalhur Karind! Sinjab! Ahmadavand Bebtui Bajlan Bajlan Sharafbaiui .. Nanekali Kuliai 200 4,000 50 200 50 100 50 200 50 700 Most of these sowars are armed with imitation Peabody-Martini and Martini-Henry rifles belonging to their chiefs. At Sar-i-Pul-i-Zuhab there are three old muzzle-loaders, with a few rounds of ammunition. The state of the whole country is absolutely defenceless, and a very small Turkish force could make its way to Kirmanshah in a few days without any difficulty. It is very doubtful if the Government would get any assistance from the Kurds, who would be more likely to employ them selves in trying to put their families, flocks and tents in a place of safety. All the Chiefs of these various tribes on the slightest provocation im mediately retire into Turkish territory. The Persian officials and Gov ernment dislike this above anything, and use every endeavour, short of force to prevent their crossing the border. Arms .—The arsenal is said to have 700 Werndl rifles. All the guns are now on the artillery square and number 16, of which two are Austrian breech-loaders, 9 centimetres ; two Austrian breech-loading mule guns, 7 centimetres; and four Austrian 6 -pounders, muzzle-loading, made in Tehran, all with full accessories ; also 10 old muzzle-loaders of Various sizes mounted; 20 old muzzle-loaders of various sizes in the arsenal ; two mortars' one of which is mounted on a gun carriage. The whole of these Kurds are very badly armed. The Kalhur tribe have some 1,500 rifles, the Guran about 700, mostly of the Martini-Henry type. In the other tribes it is only the chiefs and their immediate follow ers who are armed with breech-loading rifles. The people, as a rule, are too poor to be able to buy for themselves. In Kirmanshah there are two men who make Martini-Henry rifles ; they turn out one a week and very fairly turned out they are. The apparatus for boring the barrels has been got out from England For the best class of rifle, from £8 to £10 is obtained ; for less well finished £5. It is said that at Karind there is a gunsmith who turned out guns superior to either of the Kirmanshah men. Karind has long been celebrated in Persia for the excellence of its steel work.848 kirmanshah Cartridge cases are got out from Europe, and are charged in Kirmanshali. The powder made here seems to have better explosive qualities than that generally found in Persia. Communications. Roads .—The flew of commercial traffic is via the Tigris frem Basrah to Baghdad, and thence by mules or camels to Kirmanshah. The freight or the Tigris is about 37s. 6 d. per ton, equal to the freight per ton from London to Basrah, and on the top of this the Turks charge 1 per cent, ad valorem transit duty. As previously pointed out, by this route our goods are placed all over northern and western Persia and also serve to a large extent Isfahan and its districts. Even with this heavy riverain freight from Basrah, it has been computed that via Baghdad to Tehran a ton of goods can be put down at 700 ferans (£14), whilst from Bushire the same amount to-day averages about 900 krdns (£18) when not hampered by either riverain freight or transit duty, a difference of £4 per ton or about 30 per cent., and, even under the most favourable circumstances, with light charges on the Bushire route, the Baghdad route has always an advantage over it.. It is, therefore, obvious that to enable our trade to compete with Russian in the northern markets, the Baghdad route affords greater facilities than the Bushire one. It is evident that if the Baghdad railway be constructed, and if it be extended to the Persian Gulf, it will do much to increase the importance of the Kirmanshah route and of the town as a port of entry for Persia. When it is considered that from Basrah to Baghdad by the Shat-el-Arab and the Tigris the distance is 510 miles, whilst as the crow flies the distance is only 300 miles, and that now it costs as much to send goods from Bas rah to Baghdad as to get them from London to Basrah, one will easily im agine the enormous impetus which will be given to the Kirmanshah trade by the cheapening of the cost of transport, a natural result of the railway to Khaniqln and the Gulf. With the completion of the Bakhtlari road, freights via Isfahan to Tehran should average something on the same level as the above-quoted rates lid Baghdad. But to enable us to fight Russian trade via the Caspian with success even a lower rate than £14 a ton should be attain able. There is no doubt but that the Luristan route via Dizffil, Khur- ramabad, and Burujird could be opened up again. All that is required is that in ’Arabistan ard Luristan there should be a good efficient Governors, who would keep the Lurs in order and prevent them raiding the road. A small subsidy paid the tribes, who are immediately adjacent to the road or through whose territory it passes, would greatly assist in this. From Kb.i rramabad, Kirmanshah could be supplied ; it is only some 10 miles distant, the land transit would thus be about the same as from Baghdad. From Burujird the Hamadan market could also be served; again the land transit would be practically the same. As regards Sultanabad, Qum and Tehran, the service would be more efficient and easier. By taking advantage of the various rivers of Khuzistan and Luristan, the Karun, Diz, Karkheh and the Shah Pur, either as a means to generateKIRMlNSHlH m electricity as motive power for electric railways, or by the making of locks and bunds and using the rivers as canals, this route would be brought into direct and cheap connection with the sea. At the present time the Imperial Bank of Persia holds a concession for the road from Tehran to Mohammerah, via Luristan, but it does not appear to have any intention of moving in the matter. In 1912 the Baghdad-Khaniqln route was still practically the only one available for trade into and out of Kirmanshah from the south and west. Negotiations for a railway from Mohammerah to Khurramabad, and thence to Kirmanshah and Hamadan, were in progress in 1912. But the railway is unlikely to be built beyond Dizffil for many years. The Bagh- dad-Khaniqm-Kirmanshah-Tehran line will be built within about 6 vears of the completion of the Baghdad railway. In February 1911 a Russian subject started a carriage service twice weekly from Kirmanshah to Khaniqin. The rates of carriage per mule load from Kirmanshah to Baghdad is equal to Rs. 6 to 8 , and from Baghdad to Kirmanshah Rs. 8 to Rs. 12. Ihe standard weight of a mule load is 4 Indian maunds.

History. ^ Kirmanshah was built by Bahram (Varahran) IV, son of Shahpur Zulak- taf, who under the reign of his father conquered Kirman and governed under the name of Kirmanshah, i.e., King of Kirman. He is known to the SS^to^O^A 6 !) 1 ' 116 name ^ and rei g ned over Persia from Gobad (491-532 A. D.), son of Pirus rebuilt the town, which was after wards beautified by his son Khusrau Nushirvan (532-579 A D ) and his grandson Khusrau Parviz (590-628 A.D.). Khusrau Nushirvan is supposed to have built here a palace where he received, in the audience hall, the homages of the Emperor of Rome, the Ruler of China and of the Khan of the Tartars. There are no ruins_ to be seen, and in all probability the town was for merly quite near Taq-i-Bustan, where large mud embankments are still ta be seen. A few mounds or tumuli are also to be found here, and the350 KIRMINSHAH Persians point to one as the site of Khusrau Parviz’s palace. No excavations have ever been made, and, for the present, one can only make conjectures as to what may lie hidden under these tumuli or buried within the en closures of the mud embankment at Taq-i-Bustan. The village of Kirmanshah Kuhneh is supposed to have been the em placement of the Government buildings and arsenal before and during the Turkish occupation. Amongst European authors, for centuries, no mention of the place is made. The Jesuit, Raphael Dumas of Isfahan, just mentions it as Kirman shah “ la capitale des Gourdes.” Pietro della Valle who in 1616-17 passed the plain of Kirmanshah on his way from Mahidasht to the Pul-i-Shah or Pul-i-Kara Su, never mentions Kirmanshah, although he must have passed within a few miles of the town. In the time of Mahmud Khan Afghan, Kirmanshah was mbdued by Ahmad, the Pasha of Baghdad, but later on Ashraf Khan compelled him to leave Kirmanshah and to fall back upon Baghdad. During the wars between Nadir Shah and the Turks, 752-757 A. D., Kir- manshah was taken and retaken many times by the Turks, but remained finally in the hands of the Persians. Mirza Muhammad Taki was Governor of Kirmanshah under Nadir Shah, who in 1770 A. D. bestowed upon him the title of Mustaufi-ul-Mamalak. On the death of Nadir Shah, Mirza Muhammad Taki took the part of ’AH Shah against Ibrahim Shah. This latter besieged Kirmanshah, which was surrounded by Mirza Muhammad Taki, together with all the military implements and stores collected in the town by Nadir Shah. Ibrahim Shah having been defeated and killed by Shah-Rukh, Mirza Muhammad Taki declared himself independent chief of Kirmanshah. The town was many a time pillaged by the Zends under the direction of Karim Khan, then a highwayman whose stronghold was at Parlveh near Harsin. Karim Khan, having taken in hand the reins of Government, invested Kirmanshah in 1780 A. D., but had to retire on hearing of the defeat of ’Ali Mardan Khan. ’Ali Mardan Khan was killed near Nihavand, and the siege of Kirmanshah was renewed, and vigorously pushed on. After a stub born resistance of two years the town had to surrender on account of the ravages caused by famine. Mirza Muhammad Taki and his nephew Mirza-ibn-Muhammad Amin were taken prisoners, but escaped and retook possession of Kirmanshah which they held in the name of Azad Khan Afghan, who inflicted a severe defeat on the armies of Karim Khan. Shortly afterwards Mirza Muhammad Taki was murdered by the Zends, and Mirza-ibn-Muhammad Amin escaped to India where in the years 1810-1811 A. D. he wrote history. In the early part of the century, Path ’Ali Shah conferred the Governor ship of the province and city upon his eldest son Muhammad ’AH Mirza, whose jealousy of ’Abbas Mirza, the heir-apparent, plays so a large part in the history of the contemporary writers. Muhammad ’Ali Mirza, Daulat Shah, was succeeded by his eldest son Muhammad Husam Mirza, Hashmat-ud-Dauleh, who was Governor for ten years. A few years later Imam Quli Mirza Tmad-ud-Dauleh, brother of Hashmat-ud-Dauleb, was appointed Governor, in which position he remained for 21 years.KIRMlNSHlH 351 When the Shah passed by here on his way to Karbala in 1871, a huge peti tion, complaining of the oppression of the Governor, was presented to him, but was not answered. In 1885 this province formed part of the immense territory under the governorship of Zil-us-Sultan. After Kirmanshah was taken away from the Zill-us-Sultan, it was given for some years to the highest bidder, with the result that the people have been greatly oppressed. Since the last few years the town seems to have entered upon a new era of prosperity, which will no doubt increase in the near future. It has suffered severely from plague, cholera and famine. The plague which ravaged the town in 1830 is said to have decreased the population to 12,000 souls. 1903 .—In 1903 the Governor of the province was His Highness ’Abdul Husain Mirza, better known as Farman Farma. He was pre ceded by ’Ala-ud-Dauleh, who by his energy did a great deal for the tran quillity of the province and for the embellishment and cleanliness of the town. At that time one could travel all over the province of Kirmanshah among the tribes, without fear of being robbed or attacked ; so great was the dread of the Governor’s name amongst these usually troublesome tribes. Up till 1902 the British Government was represented by an Agent in Kirmanshah and latterly this was Haji ’Abd-ur-Rahlm, Vakil-ud-Dauleh. He was banker, merchant and land-owner and had an annual income of about £10,000. All his wealth he inherited from his father and brother. The father was an extraordinarily powerful and capable man, and prac tically governed Kirmanshah. The Governor had generally to dance to his piping. His position with the late Shah, the Zil-us-Sultan, and the authorities in Tehran was unassailable. In March 1904 a British Con ml was appointed to Kirmanshah, as a set off against the Russian Consul. He was to be “ Consul for Kirmanshah, Malayar, Hamadan and Kurdistan”. 1910 .—In July 1910 a great wave of anti-Russian feeling wai raised in Kir manshah by the fact that a Russian Cossack shot a Persian, and the Russian Consular escort was unable to leave the Consulate for some days. About the same time the Kalhurs under Baud Khan threatened the town. In March 1911 two attempts were made to break into the British Con sulate, and the local authorities were obliged to post troops. On July 31st, 1911, Salar-ud-Dauleh, brother of the ecc-Shah, Muham mad ’AH entered Kirmanshah in the name of the ex-Shah, with 2,000 men, being joined so it is said by 4,000 local levies. He also occupied Hamadan and on September 11th defeating Amir Mufakham, Bakhtiari, captured Sultanabad, and advanced to within 50 miles of Tehran. On Septembei 28th, 1911, Yprim, Chief of Police, and Sardar Bahadur, Bakhtiari, defeated the Salar at Zarand and captured 13 guns ; and again at Burujird, on Nov ember 18th, they defeated him severely, but he rallied and on December 13th he occupied Kirmanshah, the Governor taking bast in the British Consulate. 1912 .—On February 8 th Government troops re-occupied Kirmanshah, and the prince fled, but a fortnight later h e re-captured the town with the aid352 KIRMANSHAH of a Kurdish force, which recouped itself by plundering the town; while Salar-ud-Dauleh revenged himself by cutting off the Governor’s legs and burning him alive. In the disturbances created one of the sowars of the British Consular escort was wounded. The Persian Government offered a pension to Salar, if he would leave Persia, and the two Powers tried to induce him to accept this, but he demanded nothing short of the Principality of Western Persia. At this time, and again in September 1912, the Turkish Government threatened to send a large consular escort to Kirmanshah, and to protect their caravans on the road, protesting that the Russians and British were doing the same in the north and south. It was only when diplomatic pressure was brought to bear on them by these two powers that they desisted, In April 1912 Salar-ud-Dauleh organized a force of Kalhurs, Sinjabij and other Kurdish tribes, and advanced towards Tehran. Farman Farma who had been appointed Governor-General, after much delay, started from Tehran on April 15th. Salar got to beyond Hamadan and his lieute nant, Mujall-us-Sultaneh, took Zinjan, but his success was then arrested by Yprim, who defeated him severely at Hamadan, being, however, him self killed in the fight. On June 1st Government troops occupied Kirmanshah, and it was thought that the last had been heard of Salar-ud-Dauleh’s pretention, especially as Daud Khan, Kalhur, his most powerful supporter, had been killed. But he was apparently not easily disheartened, for throughout the next six(?) months he and Farman Farma took it in turns to occupy (and of course loot) Kirmanshah ; and on one occasion these two even exchanged posses sion of Kirmanshah and Sinneh within a Kw days, without encountering each other. The Government troops (Fideas) under Farman Farma were discontent ed owing to non-receipt of pay, and some of them, led by Yar Muhammad Khan, who had in 1911 led an expedition against the prince, now rebelled and joined him. Yar Muhammad, however, was killed in September 1912, yet the next news of Salar-ud-Dauleh was that he was outside the walls of Tehran, and the Government were afraid of the capital siding with him. In 1913, the Turks succeeded in establishing a Consular guard of 15 men. General description .—Kirmanshah is the capital of the province of Kirman shah, and is part of a buluk of the same name. It stands on rolling ground connected with the hills of Fath ’All Khan, Chiahsurkh and Kamarzad, which form part of the limits of the Kirmanshah plain. Chiahsurkh, which is covered with small huts, inhabited by the lower Kurdish population, marks the end of the town towards the south, and the beginning of those fine gar dens which give the town such a picturesque aspect, when reached from the Baghdad highway. There is also a hill in the town known as “ Tappeh Alaf Khaneh ” or “ Sar Tappeh. ” The town, approached from the Hamadan road, presents a mean appear ance and is quite denuded of any relieving feature. A few tin-covered minarets, the Naqqareh Khaneh and the whitewashed walls enclosing the Governor’s palace, are the only signs which point to a town instead of a large Village ' . . , . The plain, on which the city stands, extends 6 miles in breadth from north to south and 30 miles from east to west; it is studded with small351 KIRMINSHAH Public buildings .—Kirmanshah owes the buildings which can now be seen (either in fairly good condition or in complete ruin) to the munificence of two of its Qajar Governors—Muhammad ’All Mirza, Daulat Shah and Imam Qull Mirza ’Imad-ud-Dauleh, son of Daulat Shah. The former built the Chahar-bagh, the town walls, the Governor’s palace, the artillery and the barrack squares, the villa of Dilkusha and the arsenal : the latter, the mosque of ’Imad-ud-Dauleh the Post Khaneh, Imadieh, and the Kaisarieh part of the bazaars. Two other buildings of public interest are the Pul Kara Su and the jisr at |Vakilieh. The Chahar Bagh, known also as Bagh Shahzadeh and Bagh Muhammad ’All Mirza, is near the barracks; a garden planted in imitation of the Chahar Bagh of Isfahan. It had a large building or reception place called Tallar, the upper part of which was covered with tiles of no great value. This building is fast going to ruin. As for the fine garden, where water once flowed through numerous water-courses, it is now quite desolate, and the big plane trees, so rare in this district, were mostly cut down under the pretext of building barracks there, whilst the remainder have lately been sacrificed for the purpose of making carriages for some antiquated guns recently unearthed from oblivion in the arsenal. Governor's 'palace.—The Governor’s palace, which is reached from the artil lery square bv a slope ended by a large gate and then through long vaulted passages, is composed of some 12 courtyards surrounded by rooms and apartments. The only things worth seeing are the grand court (Divan Khaneh) with the Tallar, where there are two monoliths of Sang Sumakh (porphyry from the Bisitun Hills, considered a great rarety by the Per sians) and the “ Archaine ” or Ilauz Khaneh (tank room) now in decay. The Artillery square. —The artillery square is in front of the Governor’s palace. Most of the bazaars end here. The maidan or square is about 95 feet wide and 240 feet long. _ 4 Barracks .—The barracks, which have been described as untenanted, near the Governor’s palace, consist of a large maidan, surrounded on three sides by a long row of small rooms very much resembling the inner court of the caravan- sarai “ Shah ’Abbassithe fourth side consists of three tiers of rooms, and over these can be seen the lofty towers of the Anderun of the palace. The maidan measures about 480 feet in length and 252 feet in width. There are about 128 rooms, each supposed to accommodate five or six soldiers. Up till quite recently part of these rooms were used as stables for the soldiers donkeys. , , The situation of the arsenal is in no way strategical. It is behind tne palace and surrounded by buildings and shops ; it is simply a military store. There are many fine gardens to the south of the town near Sarah and a few to the north, but at a certain distance. There are plenty of fruit trees and poplars, but unfortunatley such a great quantity of wood is cut down every year that few trees are allowed to grow to their full height. The Vakllieh is a villa on the Kara Su at f farsakh from town. It belongs to the Vakil-ud-Dauleh, who had the jisr (bridge) thrown over the river at this spot. It is a favourite resort in spring for the people of Kirmanshaii. Climate and Health. For “climate” see under “ Kirmanshah (Province).”kirmanshah 355 PvMic health. —The water-supply in Kirmanshah is plentiful, but as the water runs from the tank of one house to that of the next, and as in these tanks the cooking utensils and house-linen are washed, the vater generally used for drinking purposes is polluted and contaminated. The water of the hammams or public baths is only changed once or twice a year. Notwith- s andmg this, and the total absence of drains, Kirmanshah is, through the rynessofits climate, a healthy place. The water is heavy and indigestible and diarrhoea and dysentery are the result. The usual illnesses are fever, small-pox and diphtheria. Kirmanshah during the last century suffered many times and very severely from cholera, plague and famine. In 1801 Sir J. Macdonald Kinneir estimated the population at 60,000 souls, but the plague which ravaged the town m 1830 is said to have reduced the population to 12,000 souls. n October 1910 cholera appeared in Kirmanshah, and there were as manv as 4o deaths m one day. There were no cases after November 8 th Small pox also appeared in October of that year. ' Ethnography. The population of Kirmanshah town is estimated at 60,000, but this is a minimum figure. It must be taken into consideration that the Kurds live huddled together small rn^h 1 ^^ 7 ' ^ ^ }mt UP 311 a mud ll0Use consisting of three , rooms, and it is said that m no town in Persia are there so many in- Wrotp-^' TW' ISa ^ nd - Din 1 ?“ w cll aware of this fact ihen fV n&gt; ; T h ® town of K irmanshah has 7,000 houses,” and further “ the inhabitants of this town are a mixture of Kalhurs, Zanganehs, a few Gurans ana other tnoesmen.

There are about 20 Ottoman Jews, who have in their hands tin greatest part of the foreign import and export trade.

Their imports come to 100,000 tumdns, but are exceeded by their exports ; the consequence being that bills on Isfahan are always offering in the bazaars. Hamadan merchants import naphtha, rice, Russian prints, glassware and hardware (coming from Rasht); export to Hamadan, dates from Man- dali, gall nuts, grease, ghi, raw hides, tea, spices, iron, lead, Manchester goods and window glass. The exports exceed the imports. There are other Hamadan merchants, who work exclusively as commission agents for releasing goods from the eustom-hcuse and forwarding them to Hamadan. Bankers. —There are here a few bankers whose business seems to be mostly the granting of loans against mortgages. The Shirkat Amtia ’Umumi, a Persian commercial bank, has had for about a year an agency here ; and, since March 20, 1902, the Imperial Bank of Persia has opened a branch in Kirmanshah. The sarrdfs of Kirmanshah are merely money-lenders or brokers, and have no influence on the market; they pay a tax of 600 kr~ns per annum. One finds in Kirmanshah, Shi'ahs, ’Ali Illahis, Babis, a few Sunnis and Jadid-ul-Islain Jews and Christians. The greater part of the town population is of the Shl’ah persuasion ; it was formerly ’All Illahi, but Haji ’Ali Khan, former Governor of Kirmanshah who built the Musjid Juma’ is said to have forced the inhabitants to pray in the mospie, and to have thus rendered, in the course of a few years, the Shi’ah persuasion paramount in the town of Kirmanshah. Most of the tribes are ’All Illahi, many are Shi’ahs, whilst a few nearer the Turkish frontier are Sunnis. As already mentioned, there are here about 20 Jewish merchants, but these are from Baghdad, and are only temporary residents. There is a fixed population of Persian Jews numbering about 150 houses, or about 750 souls, who live by small trade and hawking. A few Chaldean Christians, amounting all told to 30 souls, have settled here; one of them is engaged in trade, the others live by the manufacture of a aq and wine of very inferior quality. The real language of the town of Kirmanshah is Kurdi. The town dialect is very close to the Sinjabi and Kalhur Kurdi. Unfortunately for this language, of which so little is known, the Kurds think it a mark of educa tion to insert in their conversation Persian words here and there. The result of this mixture of language is that many Kurdish words are getting lost. Pilgrims. —About 23,000 passports were delivered this year to pilgrims for Karbala, Najaf, andKazimain. Only pilgrims travelling on horse, mule or donkey-back, require passports; pilgrims on foot, women and children require no passports. Well-to-do Persians go on horseback or in takiehravdns (litters), whilst women usually go in kajdvehs. It is estimated that from 50,000 to 100,000 pilgrims pass Kirmanshah yearly en route to Karbala. Pilgrim caravans have usually a “ chd ' sh ” or guide who from time to time sings religious hymns. The caravan is lead by a “ pishahang ” or heavily358 K1RMANSHAH The Gular AghassI Bash! has to introduce to the Governor the inhabitants of the town when the Governor is newlv appointed, and the principal vil lagers, when the Gcvernor goes on a tour in his province. The Sandukdar is the treasure chest cashier. The Kalantar is the chief of the Katkhudas. The Katkhudas are practically the mayors of the principal quarters of the town. The Darugheh-i-Bazar is responsible for the safety of the bazaars at night. The Shatir Bashi is the chief of the runners. The Rais Bashl Tahqlqat has the administration of justice in his hands, and to the Rais Tijarat are referred matters concerning trade and commerce. The province of Kurdistan is normally under the Government of Kir- manshah, but it was reported from Tehran in 1913 that it had been handed over to Zafar-us-Sultaneh as Governor. The Governor is named by the authorities in Tehran, but has the nomina tion of the Deputy Governor and of other officials. For the divisions of Kirmanshah town, sec under “ General description The province of Kirmanshah is divided into 19 buluks or districts, which are as follows:—Baladeh, Vastam, Mian Darband, or Bilavar, Pnsht Darband or Bala Darband, Dinavar, Kulial, Sahdeh, Kangavar, As’adabad, Harsin, Chamchamal, Durii Faraman, Mahidast, Harunabad, Guran, Karind, Zuhab, Aivan and Hulaiian. Kdrguzdr .—There being here a Turkish Consulate-General the Persian Foreign Office has to be represented by a Karguzar. The Karguzar has charge of the passport service. A charge of 1 krdn is made for a passport to Baghdad and Karbala, and for a vise the charge is 12-60 krdns for every six months. Passports for other countries are also delivered here, and the charge varies from 1 krdn to 20 or 30 krdns, according to the rank of the traveller. The Jews are under the direct jurisdiction and protection of the Karguzar. Foreign representatives. —There is here a Turkish Consulate-General, on ac count of the frontier question. The Consulate is said to have a large revenue from passport service, and from the passes for taking dead bodies to Karbala. Of these, 7,000 passed Kirmanshah last year, on their way to their last resting place. The charges are :— Vise of passport, 1 tdmdn ; for charvaddrs 2} krdns every six months; pass for dead body, -2 tumdns ; sealing wax on above, 1 krdn. The dead bodies are examined here by a medical officer of the Conseil Sanitaire; if the body may be safely taken to Khaniqm and Karbala the pass is delivered and the coffin is sealed down. The coffins are opened again in Khaniqln, where a further charge of 1 £T. is made, and if any body be found there to be in a state of putre faction it is buried on the spot. There used to be a British Agent, Haji ’Abdur Rahim, Vakll-ud-Dauleh, son of Haji Agha Husain, Yakil-ud-Dauleh. The Vakll-ud-Dauleh was one of the richest proprietors of Kirmanshah, and his hospitality was well known to all travellers wdio passed through this part of Persia. He died in 1902. There is now (since 1904) a British and a Russian Consulate in Kirmanshah. Telegraph. —The telegraph office occupies one of the khaydts or court yards of the palace, opening on the artillery square. Kirmanshah is on the Tehran-Baghdad line. The stations are Tehran, Khanabad, Naubaran, Zaneh, Hamadan, As’adabad, Kangavar, Kirmanshah, Karind, Sar-i-Pul-i-KlRMlNSHlH 359 ^uhab, Qasr-i-Shirin, Khaniqin, Kizil Rubat, Shahraban and Bakuba (Yakubieh) The line consists of a single wire. Messages can be sent to lehran, Khaniqin, and Baghdad in Latin characters, but for other stations the language of the country has to be used. For the interior the charge is 2 75 krans per 10 words, for Baghdad LS krdns per word. On delivery of the telegram the farrdsh of the telegraph office claims 10 shdhis. It is usually preferable to send telegrams for Europe to Tehran to be retransmitted from there as messages over the Turkish lines are so mutilated in transmis sion that they are usually incomprehensible when received Post office —administration of the post office having been made over to the custom-house officials, the post office is now in the customs-house cara- vansarai on the outskirts of the town to the north. The mails leave for Hamadan arid Tehran on Mondays and Thursdays, and for Baghdad on Wed- nesdays. They are receiyed from Tehran on Saturdays and Wednesdays and from Baghdad on Sundays. There is also a mail to Harsin which leaves Kirmanshah on Wednesday; the mail from Harsin is received on the Tuesday. The Tehran post takes seven days to cover the distance from Tehran to Kirmanshah, and the Baghdad post four days from Baghdad to Kirmanshah. The Tehran-Kirmanshah post-houses pay six horsi, the Kirmanshah-Baghdad only two. The mail to Harsin is taken by a (m id or man on foot In winter the mails from Tehran and Baghdad are two days longer on the road. 8 Customs. The custom-house is now in the hands of the Belgian administra- tion. There is a custom-house at'Qasr-i-Shirln, and guards on the road to prevent cAaroodars, from evading the customs. There is also an off^ at Sumeh (Sanandij), Kurdistan, and one at Baneh. These three offices are under the control of the Kirmanshah administration. Under the energetic direction of Belgian officials the working of the Customs has greatly Im proved the frontier is effectively patrolled by armed sowars and the revenue derived from the Customs of the province of Kirmanshah will no doubt be greatly increased The control of the frontier has been extended and there are now posts at the following places :-Kirmanshah, central office - Qasr-i- Shirm, collecting and control station; Dabrulleh near Kandali collecting station ; Sarab Gdan, control station ; Aushkuri, 3 /arsajehs from Qasr-i-Shirln caravans ah the feet Io7d kafe fevfeofT “ ffi ^ The new tariff which came into force on February 14, 1904 was accented here without opposition.

There is another tax (hawdl) on goods enter^ mg and leaving the country. In former years the custom-house compound belonged to the Government, and a charge was made for all goods deposited m it the Government being responsible for any goods stolen. This compound • has lon g been sold to private individuals, and the custom-house does n^t hold itself responsible for the goods deposited in its present compound Yet the charge is still made by the Governor, and special collectors are appointed to watch the caravans and collect the tax, which is 1 krdn per every 12 loads Currency.—The currency of Kirmanshah is of new coin^eciallVthe I)t Kazan. 1-W pieces, when they have no holes, command Sp to 3 per cent premium old com is at a discount of 1 to 1 £ per cent.

Report on Persia, Part II, Route 236-246). KIZIL UZfJN— A river of Persia, generally pronounced Kiziluzain, the principal branches of which rise in the mountains of ’Abbas Beg, in Ardalan, in about Lat. 35° 50', Long. 46 c 45'; 8 or 9 miles north-west of Sahneh towards Sinneh. Thence it makes an exceedingly tortuous course about 100 miles in theEIZIL UZUN 363 general direction of north-east. After this its line is more direct for about 50 miles and then it turns abruptly north-north- west, and runs for 40 miles between high precipitous banks through the district of Kizil Gachllar, near the extremity of which it receives a tributary on the east side. Two and a quarter miles from Karagul the river is fordable at times, but it is exceedingly difficult and dangerous owing to the rapidity of the current and the great masses of rock that are brought down in the bed of the stream, causing the ford to constantly change. It is only in November, when the water is at its lowest, that the river is fordable ; in the spring there is no possibility of passing it anywhere in this neighbourhood, except on rafts. The Kizil Uzun now breaks through a terrific chasm in the Anguran mountains, and afterwards runs north about 10 miles to the extremity of the strong defile called Darband, where it inclines a little to the east, for 8 miles, and passes the village of Kara Buteh. Proceeding in the same direction 6 miles beyond this place, it receives the Zinjan river, which arrives by a north-west course of about 70 miles from the plain of Sultanleh, passing the town of that n ime. The river then runs nearly north, along the deep valley east of Mlaneh and is crossed eight miles south-east of that town by the Qaplan Kuh bridge (6 arches, 160 paces long, built in the 15th century). At about six miles north-east of Mianeh it receives the Karangu river, also called Mianoh river, formed by the junction near Mianeh of the Shahrl Chai, Qarangu, and Aidghamish. Soon after receiving the Mianeh, the main branch forces a passage through the west branch of the Talesh range. At about 3 miles below Maman, which is below Mianeh, the river runs through a very steep defile, and for two miles- and a half the road along it is very difficult and dangerous ; 3 miles from Maman there is an easy ford over the river, forming a defile barely practicable for loaded cattle. It is here only a shallow and narrow river ; but in the spring, from April to July, the melting of the snow renders it passable only where bridges and ferries are established. The road is here confined by high mountains, which some times oblige it to quit jts banks, but it is generally practicable for troops, and a carriage road could easily be made. The water at this point is rather brackish, though used by the inhabitants; the river then takes a south-easterly course along the plain lying between these mountains and the east branch of the some name. After this the river runs through a broad valley, covered with brushwood, and divides into many shallow branches. At 8 miles above Alvar it is crossed by a fine bridge of 6 arches. One mile below the bridge the mountains recede, leaving a small space of table-land which ends precipitately at the river on both sides. Three miles further the river is again shut in by high rocks, and the road has only been made practicable by blasting. The Sukuz Chai joins it about 5 miles above Alvar on the left, and the Kabak Chai 2 miles below it. At Darram the river is only fordable when very low, and even then not without difficulty. It has here a velocity of about 2 miles an hour. Near Manjll the trunk formed by the west afflu ents receives the Shah Rud, or east branch, which comes from the borders of Mazandaran. The Kizil Uzun is crossed by a bridge at Manjll; 5 miles above the village of Kankand there is a very difficult, dangerous and con stantly changing ford in the dry season. The meeting of these -arms gives a new direction to the Kizil Uziin, which nearly forms a right ande with364 KIZ—KOG each of its two branches, as it forces its way through the defile of Rudbar anl the n ,rrow valley of Rustamabad. Having traversed Gllan the Safid Riid, as it is now called, finally enters the Caspian Sea, 57 miles east of Rasht, after a north-easterly course of nearly 490 miles from its source. The bed of this river is generally many hundred feet below the surface of the adjoining country. The road from Zinjan to Rasht leads along its bamc, and is described by Sutherland as one of the grandest and most terrific scenes he ever witnessed. The frightful roar of the waters is heard at a distance, and an unwary step would instantaneously precipitate the traveller into the gulf below ; but near the pass of Rudbar it becomes ' less deep, and when passing through the plain of Gilan, the banks of the river are low and swampy, and the current moderate. The latter portion, to the point 40 miles north of Rasht, where it falls into the Caspian, is called S did Rud. At its mouth the river is of great bre adth and of considerable depth withm the bar. A grert sturgeon fishery h »s been established here, iditeen miles from the sea the Safid Rud divides into four branches forming an extensive island or delta. These are : the Safid Rud, which is the furthest east; the Salarjut (formerly a canal now a branch of the river); the Yazechhai ar.d the Hasan Kiadeh. The valley is sometimes dis gree- ably hot, but has excellent pasture,ge, and some considerable tracts of cultivated land in it. It was on the banks of this river that Mr. Brown, the traveller, was murdered in 1810. The Kizil Uzun is the “ Mardus ” of the ancients. K1ZILVANK— A picturesque village, 2 miles below ’Abbasabad at the western mouth of a precipitous gorge through winch the river Aras flows between ’Abbasa- bad and Julfa. The village is overlooked by a beautiful Armenian church with fortified walls. A footpath runs at the foot of the precipices through . the gorge, but is on both banks exceptionally difficult and untrustworthv owing to the wearing away of the pathway by the spring floods It is seldom used, except by foot travellers. The ford starts from a pebbly bed on the Persian siae and runs obliquely upstream in the direction of the church Banks on both sides easy ; water knee deep for horses in summer and chest deep in autumn. Sand and pebbly bottom. There is the usual Cossack guard of 10 men. From Kizilyank westward the country is comparatively open the river dividing the rich valley of Nakhjivan and Shah Tukht on the north from the sterile valley of Abbasabad, and Arab on the south.— (Picot, 1894.)

JT It is an isolated rocky mountain several hundred feet high, from which saline springs issue, forming a marsh and pond around, and leaving a thick deposit of salt. The interstices and gullies of the hill are likewise full of salt, which appears to impregnate, and perhaps forms the interior mass of the hill. Large slabs of this mineral are removed for general use. The hill is a natural curiosity well worth visiting. It is regarded with superstitious feeling by the natives, who say that “ he who goes to it returneth not. ” The probability is that the ascent, at least in parts may be rendered danger ous by the boggy and infirm nature of the soil, and accidents occurring have given rise to the superstition.— (Abbott).

C300GSB378 KUHPA—KUH PAR KtHPA or YlR—Lat. 32° 42' 25' ; Long. 52° 2' 46' ; Elev. 6,011'. The chief village of the Kuhpayeh Mahall or district in the province of Isfahan. The town lies 50 miles east of Isfahan and is surrounded by a high mud wall, unloopholed, but strengthened by semi-circular loopholed towers which project at intervals. It contains about 700 houses, and is watered by two Jcandt streams from the north, water brackish. There are three small cara- vansarais built of sun-dried bricks which are inside the walls, and there are a few shops. A large number of abbas or cloaks are made, occupying some 400 of the inhabitants. There is a Persian Telegraph Office which is open, when the clerk is not at Nam. Outside the town, and facing the entrance to it, is a caravansarai of burnt brick. It is 60 yards square with round towers at the corners. Its entrance faces the town, which is commanded from its roof within a distance of 150 yards. The roof, formed of tiles, is about 14 inches thick, and has an all round parapet 6 to 7 feet in height, with 40 faultily constructed loopholes in each face. Its thickness is 15 inches. The top of the parapet is 21 feet from the ground, and the walls of the building itself are very massive. The building contains stabling for 200 horses.

KUH PARAU— A mountain in Kirmanshah, about 8 miles north-east of Kirmanshah city. It forms part of a range of high mountains that commence at Bisitun in the Kuh Bisitun to the east and runs north-west as far as Gurgman in the Bilawar valley. The western portion of the chain consists of the Kuh-Arjuwan, Kuh Baluch, Kuh Zilu and Kuh Kinish. The Kuh Parau, which is the highest of these, is over 11,470 feet in height. During July and August a number of villagers from the Kirmanshah plain migrate to the upper portion of the hill and feed their flocks on the fresh grass which appears as the snow slowly melts. There are regular tracks to their camping-grounds, which are possible for mountain batteries. The range is of limestone formation and between its higher rocky peaks it contains a number of small valleys the drainage of which has no outlet except a hollow in the centre, or under one of the rocks at its side. These hollows contain snow all the year round, the water from them percolating through the hills and issuing in springs or streams into the lower valleys at the base of the range. These valleys containKtfHPl—KOH RtTO 379 exce'lent grazing. The mountain contains wild sheep on its higher summits during the spring, while ibex are found on its lower slopes. Panthers, bears, wolves, wild cats, hares, partridges, quail and pigeons are also to be found. There are several very fine looking peaks on it, one of them forming an almost perpendicular wall of rock about 2,000 feet in height. The scenery generally is grand, though desolate looking, owing to the want of trees ; bushes and shrubs, forming good firewood, abound. Its camping-grounds in the lower valleys would form pleasant halting places during the hottest part of the summer. The route to it from Kirmanshah runs up the Tang-i-Kinisht and up the first valley leading into the hills on the right. Water from a spring about 5 miles up the valley. There are said to be some very extensive caves in the hill, which are passed ew rowZe to Zalu-Ab.— {Vaughan.) t .

A village 75 miles from Isfahan, on the road to Tehran. It is justly cele brated as one of the pleasantest places in Persia. It contains about 300 houses and is situated on the steep side of a hill, so that the houses almost seem to stand upon one another. Below is the caravansarai, and near it, on rising ground, the remains of an old castle. Between various eminences the valley appears richly cultivated, and finely diversified with gardens ferti lised by a stream, which abundantly supplies it with water and causes a large yield of most admirable fruit. The village and gardens of Kuh Rud completely command the road and would be a very difficult position to force. The pass of Kuh Rud (8,800') lies to the south of this village. The road is bad and stony. On the top of the pass is an artificial lake, about \ mile long, of clear water, formed by dam ming up the river. The range over which this pass lies is a spur from Mount Alvand ; it is crossed again on the road from Isfahan to Yazd, and continues to tie south of Yazd, and is probably eventually lost in the desert towards Sistan.— {Ouseley; Morier; Clerk; Taylor; Smith.) The range forms part of the central Persian range, which extends from Azarbaijan in a south-east direction to Baluchistan.

It is picturesquely situated on the slope of the hill west of the high road and has many gardens and orchards with fine fruit. The water-supply is from a stream which rises in the hills close by and flows northwards to the Kashan plain. A few miles below Kuhrud and just above the old caravansarai of Gabrabad which belongs to Kashan the stream is dammed up by the cele brated Band-i-Kuhrud., built in the first half of the seventeenth century.

Their property in villages is very great and extends from As’adabad on one side, to the province of Kurdistan on the other. They are under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Sunqur, to whom they are answerable for the revenue. Mr. T. C. Plowden, who passed through Kirmanshah in 1881, tells us that this tribe was wealthy until ruined by the exactions of ’Ali Quli Mi cza. Saram- ud-Dauleh, who having been appointed by his father Imam Quli Mirza, Imad-ud-Dauleh, “ Hakim of the Kuliai,” plundered them right and left. In former days the tribe furnished an infantry regiment, but for some cause or other the privilege was withdrawn. The Suffiavand, who are connected with this tribe, and whose chief is Fathullah Khan, claimed to be Turkish subjects, but Persia had the case decided in her favour. The Kuliais are Shi’ahs. They have the command of extensive pastures and rear large numbers of small hardy horses and mules. The women weave carpets and woollen socks and gloves. The Kuliais are said to be able to turn out 700 fully equipped horsemen. In 1907 the Kuliais were divided as follows :— Bagavand : chief—Haidar ’Ali Khan Sartip. Faleh-kuri : chief—Ghulam ’AH Khan.

For a comprehensive history of the Province see Rabino’s “ Rcnnrf Kurdistan.” report on C300GSB386 KURDISTAN Geography. The region occupied has no natural or political boundaries ; it includes both Persian and Turkish territory and contains many other elements be sides Kurds. During the years 1905-12 the Turks encroached considerably on Persian Kurdistan and incited the Kurds to create trouble (see Azar- baijan). The district may be said to extend from Turkish Armenia on the north to the plains of the middle Tigris and the Luristan mountains on the south and through the greater part of this length to overlap the Persian frontier. The above is broadly speaking the whole country inhabited by Kurds, but it is with Persian Kurdistan that we are concerned here, which is one of the provinces of northern Persia and is bounded on the north by the Persian Province of Azarbaijan ; on the west by Sulaimanieh and other Turkish territories ; on the south by Kirmanshah ; and on the east by Hama- dan and Khamseh. Kurdistan will be seen, therefore, to occupy the mountain system which starting from the range of Anti-Taurus, sweeps east in a crescent to become the Zagros, which bounds Persia upon the west, and which the Kurds divide with the Lurish tribes south of their limit line. From the river Saruq, which separates it from Azarbaijan, to Sinneh, the face of the country is everywhere the same. It presents to the view either progressive clusters of hills, heaped as it were upon each other, or great table lands covered with flocks and the tents of the Illats. The valleys are narrow strips at the foot of the mountains, where the villages are commonly built in situations which protect the few inhabitants that remain in them from the inclemency of the weather. The soil is good and would yield abundance, but the Kurds prefer a pastoral life. The oil plant is everywhere common, and tobacco is cultivated in small quantities. Wooded mountains separated by narrow valleys and occasional plains, producing excellent pasture, cover the north portion of Ardalan. The woods yield excellent oak and fine gal apples. Between Kaleh Shah Khanl and Khizr Elias in Kirmanshah the nature of the country entirely changes, and instt a 1 of a succession of verdant hills, intermixed with deep glens, there are here extensive cultivated plains, bounded by break and barren mountains. For details of the rivers and mountains of Kurdistan see Rabino’s c ‘ Report on Kurdistan ” or under the individual names in this Gazetteer. The Persian section of Kurdistan comprises : — (i) part of the district of Avroman. (ii) Merivan. (Hi) Sardasht and Baneh. The first is a sub-province of Ardalan, and is ruled by the hereditary chief, Shah ’AH, who possesses a large part of the power exercised by his predeces sors who were semi-independent rulers under the old Ardalan Valis of Sinneh, To all purposes he is, at present, independent, having paid no taxes for some years (1912). Merivan fort is the centre of a district of that name where formerly a few Persian soldiers were stationed, but at present the Merivanis are in a state of independence. They are connected with the Avromanl tribe, and are a separate section under the administrative scheme of Ardalan.Kurdistan 387 Sardasht and Baneh are here included under the Persian section, though occupied by the Turks at present (1912). They were both under the Govern ment of the Kurdistan province through the sub-governorship of Sauj Bulagh (Mukri tribe). The capital of the province is Sinandlj or Sinneh, as it is popularly called. Climate. Snow falls for four months in the year, during which months the people live in underground houses, which are often absolutely useless as protection against the weather ; here they store food for themselves and fodder for the cattle. The great want of the district is fuel which is everywhere very scarce, and dung is carefully preserved as a substitute.” Population, See also under ‘ Kurds.'' The population of the province of Kurdistan consists wholly (excepting the inhabitants of SinneL) of hill people and nomad tribes.

All pass the summer in Kurdistan and most of them go for the winter to Kirmanshah, Lur-i-Pusht-i-Kuh, and Shahrizur. They are looked after by 7 delegates who always give trouble and cause much confusion. All these tribes are Sunni. The Shaikh Isma’ili Shamshiri and PurpisheK have their winter pasture grounds in Turkish territory. Administration .—Persian Kurdistan was governed for centuries by Guran princes of the house of Bani Ardalan under the title of Vali of Sinnoh. At the date of Rich’s visit (about eightly years ago) Amanullah Khan, the Vali of Sinneh, was almost independent of the Tehran Government, though as a concession to the Persian Court, he and the chief members of his family professed the Shi’ah faith. Amanullah was a strong ruler, who exacted the most implicit obedience from his own children, ministers, and subjects. He appointed whom he pleased to be governors of the different districts of Kurdistan, and even in the case of the chief ships of Avroman and Baneh, although the field of selection was by custom restricted to one family, the particular individual to succeed to a vacancy was named by the Vali. Ghulam Shah Khan was the last Vali of Sinneh of the house of Ardalan. His father married a daughter of Path’All Shah, a princess of a very vigorous and determined character. She was the virtual ruler of Kurdistan, and administered the affairs of the province in open darbdr. Her son, Ghulam Shah Khan, died about forty years ago, leaving a brother, Riza Qull Khan, and three children, sons. These were all set aside, and Mu’tamad- ud-Dauleh, the late Shah’s uncle, was appointed the first Hakim of Kurdistan. It does not appear that the people made any objection to the change of ruler. Rich points out that the peasantry of Persian Kurdistan are not clansmen, and notoriously lacking that love for, and devotion to their princes, w T hich marked the relations between the chief of Sulaimanieh and his tribesmen. The Valis of Sinneh moreover were cruel and rapacious and deserving little sympathy, and probably their people were not sorry to be rid of them. However this may be, the subjection of the Chief of Avroman seems to have b6en Mu’tamad-ud-Dauleh’s main difficulty. After a struggle the details of which belong to Persian history, the district was eventually subdued. Mu tamad-ud-Dauleh administered the district for nine years and has been followed by a succession of Persian governors. The ancient family of the Bani Ardalan has been reduced to poverty and insignificance. The governor does not trouble himself much about the condition of the province over which he rules. The administration is carried on by the Vazir who has himself farmed the revenue. The amount to be nominally collected is 60,000 tudmns, of which 25,000 are retained for local expenses and the balance remitted to Tehran, but the governor demands pishkash from the vazir who has to maKe his profit as well, so it is evident that the people have to pay con siderably more than the sum required. The Governor of the Kalhur district is-now for the present Sulaiman, son of Daud Khan, who was killed in 1812. For an account of Salar-ud-Dauleh’s rebellion of 1911-12, during which Kurdistan was much disturbed, see article under Kirmanshah (Province).KURDISTAN 389 Kurdistan is divided into 19 administrative divisions, one dependency and 18 buluks as follows :— 'pendency.

In con travention of the treaty between the Persian and Turkish Governments the chiefs of this tribe, after having practically destroyed all the villages of these districts, purchased them, and have retained possession of them. Dur ing the time of their sojourn in Persia not only do the Jafs import and ex port all their goods and produce without paying customs duty, but they also help Ottoman subjects to import merchandise, specially prohibited goods, such as arms and ammunition and aniline dyes, without paying * It is said that a large duty. These goods are then forwarded under amount is allowed every the escort of Jaf sowars to Mukri, Afshar, Zinjan, year to the Governor of Garus, Hamadan and vicinity of Sinneh.

Resources .—Land is cultivated under one or other of the following ar rangements :— (1) Nisf-i-Kdn .—Under this system the cultivator and the proprietor of the land divide the produce equally. The cultivator sup plies the seed and necessary labour. The landlord pays the mdlidt and the expense of reaping. (2) Dah-u-du .—Under this arrangement, which is most common in Kurdistan, the produce is divided into twelve parts, of which390 KURDI-KURDS the proprietor takes two, the cultivator ten, the latter paying all expenses. r j &amp; Yusuf Sharif says the soil is saturated with water and that water can be obtained anywhere by digging two or three feet. The chief produce of Kurdistan is wheat, gram, barley, rice, cotton, and tobacco (this last m great abundance); vegetables: pumpkins and gourds, cucumbers, brinjals, lettuce, beetroot, cauliflower, potatoes, onions and garlic ; fruits : melons, water-melons, cherries (about five kinds), grapes apples, plums, peaches and walnuts. &amp; ^ » The great want of the district is fuel which is everywhere very scarce and dung is carefully preserved as a substitute. The women of Kurdistan are beautiful, and are of fair complexion. No black faces are to be seen among them. They do not wear the veil, but go about freely like European women. The marriageable age is from 12 to 15 for women and from 18 to 20 for men. The prevailing complaint is ophthalmia and other kindred diseases, at least 25 per cent, of the entire population suffer from these ailments.

Their habits are nomadic in moving during the summer months into camps on the higher acclivities of the hills above the settled villages. Nomad Kurds are largely Turkish subjects or live on the Turkish border and per haps the wealthiest members of the tribe belong to this class, the cultivators and shepherds being as a rule deplorably ignorant and poor. As to what their numbers may be, it seems pure guess work. Some say one million, some two, some a half. Dissensions and clan feuds weaken them, as they did the Scottish Highlanders, and they do not attempt resis tance to the Persians, whose present army is far from formidable, but in the event of any invasion the great fact would be that the invaders would find auxiliaries rather than enemies in them, which, considering the nature of the country, is of enormous importance. Persian-born Governors are now beginning to replace the Kurdish chiefs, who up to now (1903) were always Governors of their own districts. In December 1880 there occurred an abortive Kurdish rebellion in Persia under a certain Shaikh Obaid Ullah which, though a fiasco, was from a political point of view of groat importance as it showed the utter impractic ability, owing to family and clan dissensions, of a united Kurdish organisa tion, which will probably not be heard of again during our time. For further particulars see Lord Curzon’s Persia, and articles Azarbaijan and Kirman- shah of this Gazetteer. Whatever the Turkish Kurds may be, the Persian ones are celebrated for their hospitality and are not at all unfriendly towards Europeans. They 8re great dandies in dress, and the richer ones are always well dressed in clean and good clothes. The national clothing is a short coat and very baggy trousers with an enormous sash round the waist in which are placed knife and pipe, and some sort of coloured silk (generally dark) handkerchief wound round the head ; the Kurd invariably carries arms of some sort. Nature has well endowed him, as he is a fine, large, handsome man.— {Gerard ; Curzon ; Harris.) KUREHVAZ (KURAVAZ).— ’ A bvluk of Kurdistan about 10 farsakhs west of Sinandij. The produce of the buluk barely suffices for its population which does not exceed 3,000, chiefly composed of members of the KumasI tribe, all Sunnis, and notorious robbers.

LAHIJAN (1)— A town in Gilan, 28 miles east of Rasht, on the right bank of the Langarud. The old capital of the Bieh Pish district of Gilan. It was independent until the 17th century. It is a pleasantly situated town on a hill on the bank of a clear stream, and the country is open and dry, for which reason people often move to it from Rasht for change of air. It is a town of no small antiquity, and was once of considerable extent, but now only contains about 5,000 souls. The bazaars are extensive and well stocked with goods ; the shops are comfortable and well arranged. The staple commodity is silk, of which much is made in the town and in all the villages round about it: from here it finds its way either to Rasht or Enzall for expor tation, or is sent direct to Isfahan for home manufacture. There is a Persian Government telegraph station and three or four good caravansarais, the bustle in which proclaims a brisk trade, one college, but no other building of any interest. The revenue of the district of Lahijan is about £20,000, including the customs of the towns, some £,2,650. Many of the houses are solidly built of burnt brick with upper storeys. — (Fraser; Holmes ; Monteith : Schindler.) LAHIJAN (2)— Elev. 5,650'. A district of Azarbaijan, at the sources of the Lesser Zab river. It is a fine open plain, about 20 miles long and 20 miles broad, bordered on the west by the Zagros mountains, and on the other three sides by wild barren mountains of considerable height. It is abundantly watered, and possesses a rich, fertile soil, most favourable to agriculture. This district, being on the immediate frontier of Turkey and Persia, has been inhabited at different times by tribes subject to either government. It has belonged successively to the Zerza, Baban, Mikri, Bilbas and Kurds, and its present condition partakes of this anomalous nature; for, though acknowledged as a Mikri possession, and though the proprietorship of the lands belongs to the Mikri chiefs, it is inhabited almost exclusively by the Bilbas, a tribe of Turkish Kurdistan. The capital of Lahiian is Pishva. (Rawlinson—T hielmann.) LAIZAN— A village of 200 houses in the Sauj Bulagh district of Azarbaijan, 23 miles south of Biuab on the Tabrlz-Kirmanshah road. This village is a fair type of the villages on the elevated eastern portion of the district. It stands on a nearly level plain, irrigated to a very small extent, and barren enough to all appearance elsewhere, but capable of producing fine crops of wheat with sufficient and seasonable rain. There396 LAI—LAL are no gardens or vineyards to screen the village, and the mud houses are only of a single storey, with a small enclosure for cattle. The whole covers a small extent of ground and could not be held for half an hour against a force provided with guns.— (Napier.) laileh— (Also called Ab-i-Zalan). A river in Kurdistan.

It has two sources, known as Sar-i-Bast, two farsakhs from the village of Zalan in the Juamud buluk. It rises in the high Kuhd-Bast., The Sar-i-Bast is a copious spring flowing out of a rock with a volume of 7,900 gallons per minute. This water flows first eastwards for 3 000 rar (3,500 yards) then to the north for 2,000 zar (2,333 yards) and win south-west and west until it joins the Shirvan river (1902). According to Burton the ‘Laileh’or ‘ Lusha ’ as he has it,'flows into the Zimkan river according to him the Lusha and Zalan are two separate rivers (1910). ^ LAJANA— A stage 32 miles east of Samnan, on the road from Tabas via Jumin.

It contains a summer house and garden,- and spring near it • is a favourite place of recreation for the Tabrizis. There is also a mineral spring which is supposed to possess certain medicinal properties. The tem perature of the water in summer is nearly that of the surrounding atmos phere, but m winter it retains a considerable degree of warmth, which has given it the name of Isi Sr, or hot water. —^{Rawlinson ,)i LALEHKAND— Elev. 4,730'.

LAMIR—Lat. 38° 10' 0'.—{St. John.) A river in Gilan, flowing towards the west shore of the Caspian. It is a clear shallow stream in the dry season, about 20 yards* broad a sandbank at the mouth. ^ a t ^ e 7 name ° f a V1 ! lla g e about 2 miles up-the river, on its right bank.— {Todd; Holmes ; St. John.) 5398 LANGARUD LANGARGD (1)— (Pushchin .) A river in Gilan, which rises on the northern slopes of the Elburz range and falls into the Caspian Sea, 30 miles east of the mouth of the Safid Rud. The river at the town of Langarud is about 30 yards broad, and is crossed by two bridges, one a very lofty and curious old brick structure, with two large pointed arches, and the other merely of wood. The mouth of this river near the sea is almost choked up by a sandbank, which acts as a dam and always keeps the water in the bed up to a certain level. The water which flows into the sea and the neighbouring swamps, or is exhausted by eva poration, is supplied by the stream from the mountains. The river has the appearance of a broad and almost stagnant ditch, except in the spring, when the water rises about 5 feet above the winter level. For a mile from the town the banks are wooded and dotted with cottages ; these gradually disappear and are succeeded by a flat swampy country, covered with high reeds and bulrushes. Within a short distance from the sea the river is divided into two branches, one flowing towards the sandbank at its mouth and the other turning into an extensive stagnant lake (murdab). Also the name of a hill which forms a conspicuous landmark for vessels bound for the Langarud or Chomkhaleh roadstead or the mouth of the Safid Rud, So called from the mouth of the Langarud being also called Chomkha leh # The Langarud roadstead may be considered one of the best anchorages in the southern shore of the Caspian, where almost all are bad. Its depth is about 28 feet, and the bottom mud and sand. The roadstead is sheltered by a sandbank on the north-west, and the Safid Rud bank protects it some what on the north ; besides this the shore here is comparatively shelving, so that the strong north winds do not produce the same effect as in other places on the southern coast, where the shore sinks abruptly and enormous waves, in water 40 or 50 feet deep, not finding sufficient space, break into surf and render anchorage dangerous. The Langarud roadstead cannot, however, be considered a convenient anchorage, as ships are here subject to severe rolling, due to the swell, which often does not coincide in direc tion with that of the local winds ; for the sea-wind changes its direction on the coast, being deflected by the mountains which line the shore.— {Holmes; Pushchin.) LANGARUD (2)— A town in Gilan, on the sides of a river of the same name, close to the point where it falls into the Caspian 40 miles east of Rasht. The river is navigable for kerejis between Langarud and Chomkhaleh, but not between Langarud and Lahijan. There is a Customs House and a fishery station and a naphtha reservoir at Chomkhaleh. Apart from a few herdsmen, who spend part of the year there, there are no other inhabi tants. Holmes describes it as one of the most picturesque towns he ever saw, and remarks, “ Were there a drier climate and a less swampy countryLAN—LAR 399 around, it, it would be delightful.” Unfortunately, it is the most un healthy spot in all Gilan ; the marshes which surround it, combined with the dreadful heat of summer, render it, at that season, almost uninhabitable, and the richer people retire to Lanjan, or the neighbouring mountains. In Hanway’s time it was the same, and he remarks that, as Gilan was ac counted the sink of Persia, so Langarud was considered the sink of Gilan. It is now a town of some commercial importance lying in the centre of a rice- producing district ; it has a population estimated at 50,00. There are, however, some excellent well-built brick houses and among the trees stands conspicuous a circular summer-house of three storeys high, surmounted by a dome. The revenue derived from the custom house at Langarud is said to amount to between £750 and £,1,000. LANGARUD (3)— A village in the Vazkarud division of Qum, 10 miles from the town of Qum on the road to Kashan situated on a stream of running water; during winter most of its people reside at Khurabad.— {Schindler.)

Stands back | mile from the Sinneh-Kirmanshah road in a small grassy ravine, affluent to the right bank of the Shenih stream a mile from its junction with the Gavarra river. Water-supply good and plentiful from springs ; the surplus from the cultivated land escapes across the Kirman- shah road. The village consists of 15 houses, Kurds : some corn, Indian corn and vegetables are grown ; willow and fruit trees. The people graze some flocks of sheep and goats, and own cattle.— {Burton.) LARGAN— A valley in Mazandaran between Arsinkiru and Mlkhsaz It is wide and well cultivated; the huge mountains on the south afford copious supplies for numerous streams by which the valley is irrigated.— {Lovett.) LARlJlN— A district of Mazandaran, which commences north from Paras and ex tends to a distance of 7 miles south of Ask, its capital. A more impene trable valley could not easily be found. It is said to contain 72 villages, and400 LAR—LAS furnishes 500 matchlock men (Tufangchia) and 500 regular soldiers (Sarbaz) to t .e Government. It is so completely enclosed by mountains and n ir- row gorges is to be almost inaccessible to an invader. On this account the chief and his dependents are somewhat unmanage ible. At every succes sion to the throne, or other time of commotion, they generally revolt and refuse to pay revenue. Larijan is equidistant from Amul and Tehran. It is inhabited by about 5,000 families. Larijan or the Lar district comprises the whole country watered by the Lar river and the upper course of the Hirhaz. The basin of the Lar is bounded on the north by the Mountain of Sutak, Kehu, Piazak, Divasiah Ararud, Vararud and Damavand, on the south by the H irjsang, Ashtar, Khatun Barga, Kazunak, Larikuh, Lavasan, Filazamin, Bustan, and Siahchal. The sources of the Lar river are on the Kulum B usteh, Sutak, Harisang and Ashtar Mountains, at an elevation of about 10,000 feet. At the Duab of the Yurt-i-Seh Darreh two streams unite to form the Lar river, which here flows south-e^st. At first the valley is very narrow, but it widens below Yurt-i-Gul Urduk and extends to a broad valley be low Bastak. The valley becomes narrow again at Yurt-i-Khanlar Khan, and r ms in an easterly direction ; after receiving the Dalichai river it enters a narrow gorge up to the Pulur bridge. The Lar river receives from the left, besides smaller streams, the united Safidab and Giligach, the Ab Alarm, the united Aburu and Safidab, and the Dalichai; from the right it receives the Yunizar, the Khushkirud, Chehil- birreh and Slahpalas. The Lar valley affords excellent grazing, but there are no trees or bushes. In the summer it is inh ibited by nomads, in the winter it is deserted. There are practically no buildings in the district. In 1912 the Amir Larijan, Governor of the Lar district, reported that the Russians were engaged in trying to consolid ate their influence in the Lar district by issuing Russian “ papers ” broadcast.—; Sheil; Holmes • Stahl) LARIN I— A sub.-division of the tribe of Kalhurs, who number 200 families and live at Dartaki in Kirmanshah .—(Plowden-) LARS— A village in Azarbaljan, south-south-east of Ak Tappeh, on the road from Ardabil to Aslanduz— (Morier.)

It belongs to the Samnan district and pays to the state 1,000 tumdns per annum ; about half the village is Government property. The fort is very dirty and is generally spoken of as the Pokhkaleh (correctly bok kaleh) ; in factLAS—LAU 401 the filth and dirt inside are indescribable. It is perfectly circular and con sists of 67 houses arranged in a round central block and two concentric circular rows separated from each other by narrow streets. The houses of the central block, as well as some of the rows, have three stories, and the roof of the highest house has an elevation, reckoned from the foot of the outer wall of the fort, of 83 feet. The fort is entered by a small hole , which is approached by a narrow causeway and closed by a heavy stone turning on a pivot. The village outside had, in 1875,85 houses; it now (1887) has about 140. Supplies are abundant. The corn-fields produce annually about 300 tons of grain. The Lasgird gardens are very extensive and famous for their pomegranates, some of which have no pips, their almonds and pista chios. The bread of Lasgird is also very good. The water-supply is abun dant, but the water which comes from the hills is somewhat brackish. Las gird has a mosque, a chaparkhana, a good brick caravansarai with 24 rooms and a large hall below and some rooms in an upper storey, three reservoirs for rain water, an ice house, and the tomb of two Imamzadehs, the brothers Riza and ’Ali Akbar.

The Mafi, Jalllawand and Nanekall, when oppressed in Kazvin come to Kir manshah, and when oppressed in Kirmanshah go to Kazvin. But as these tribes are very poor many families during these peregrinations have settled in villages belonging to other tribes and thus it is that they have dwindled down to their present reduced number. Mr. T. C. Plowden in 1881 speaks of some Mafi Kurds in Kaleh-Yavar, some 23 miles from Kirmanshah on the road to Sinneh and “ I have heard* of some 70 families of Mafi Kurds who reside near Zuhab, but the Mafi do no longer, at least in the Kirmanshah province, exist as a tribe.” They are Shi’ahs. J Malcolm describes them as a section of theLakks.— (Rahino.) A tribe of Kurds numbering 1000 families who spend part of the year between Qishlaq and Kazvin.

It is traversed in a north to south direction by the Anarbar river, and has an abundant water-supply from this river with its numerous small affluents. Its mean elevation is 5,000'; and its climate is salubrious, though hot in the plain in summer. This province is constantly changing hands, one moment being under the Governor-General of Isfahan, and at another forming with other dis tricts a separate Government: it apparently is now united with ’Iraq, Kazzaz, Farahan and Saveh under one Governor. The population is under 20,000.— {Schindler.) MAHALLAT (Town.)—Kiev. 5,850'. The principal place of the province of the same name and the seat of the Governor appointed by the Governor-General of Isfahan, when under that officer.

The town is beautifully situated on the southern slopes of a range of lime stone hills, and overlooks a fertile valley watered by the Anarbar or Qum river. It has magnificent gardens, orchards, and meadows, and the houses are clean and well built. It is 63 miles from Qum on the road to Gulpai gan. The upper town has a population of 8,000, the lower 800. The upper town has 5 mosques and a bazaar with 200 shops ; two hamlets Hajiabad and ’Aliabad also belong to it.

The principal water-supply of the town is from a spring which flows out of the rock about a mile north of the upper town, at an elevation of 6,100 . This spring supplies 50,000 cubic feet of water per hour in April and May, and 40,000 during the rest of the year. In some of the orchards are found the famous sihri pears and the grapes and apples of the district are excellent. Game is said to be plentiful.— (Schindler.)

It is the terminus on the sea of the Amul-Mahmudabad railway, a project of one Haji Muhammed Hasan, who hoped by means of this railway to obtain a monopoly of the carrying trade between the Caspian and Tehran, Amul being ony six marches as opposed to seven from Mashad-i-Sir and ten from Rasht to Tehran. He built five caravansarais and shops at Mahmudabad, but omitted to improve the entrance to the murdab, and goods can only be landed by lighters. The railway was laid, but the Europeans in charge not being paid left in disgust, and the whole enterprise has now fallen through and the line is not in working order.— (Curzon.)

Yazd some 30 miles from the town of Yazd; it boasts a hne caravansarai with an excellent covered tank, but the chaotic condition of its city wall can only be compared to that of Kujan. Now-a- days it is famous for the manufacture of gilim, a very durable hand-woven cotton carpet, the usual colours being red and blue. The district of Maibud is dependent on Yazd and with its- adjacent villages has a look of great prosperity ; there appear to be 17 villages and 8 hamlets, besides the towns o Ardakan and Maibud. The revenues amount to about £3,000. Snow does not remain long in this part of the plain, but in winter a dry cold of considerable intensity is experienced. In so arid a country the heat of miner must be oppressive. Has a post house and a conspicuous ice-house : also a spring of pure water. ’MAI—MAH 409 Its population is about 3000. It is frequently mentioned in history. In the northern part of the town stands the Bashnighan castle with a draw bridge. In the southern part stands the castle called Kaleh-i-Hir, surrounded by a double wall. Maibud with its deep ditch and strong walls and towers and only two small well-defended gates must have been an almost impreg nable place in former times. Of the colleges, mosques, and other public buildings of the Muzafari family in the 13th and 14th century nothing is now (1879) to be seen. South of the town and close to it is the grave of a Sultan Rashid. [Abbott ; Smith ; E. Smith ; Floyer ; Sykes ; Schindler, 1879.)

The place is inhabited by Kal- hur Kurds, a large proportion of whom migrate during the winter to Mandall and Khaniqln with their flocks. The inhabitants of the village appear to be half nomad, many of them spending a portion of the summer in tents adjoin ing their houses in preference to dwelling in them. Their houses are largely used as lodgings for pilgrims to Karbala. Roads run from here to Gavarra (Guowara on map), distance 25 miles, and thence to Karind and Mian Taq (same place as S-urkhedizeh, V'tde Karind and Surkhedizeh) and also south east along the Ab-i-Mark into Luristan.

The °f Mahidasht is* some 10 miles in breadth and 70 miles in length rt is watered by numerous irrigation canals and kandts and by the rive: Mark. There are also a number of springs on Hie plain and on the adjacen onnrfa tf 111 s ^ eS; r ^ se i n many instances to numerous streams whicl CoOOGSB410 MlHlDASHT traverse the country in every direction and water the villages. The plain grows vast crops of wheat and barley which are reaped about the end of June. Crops on the adjacent slopes ripen later proportionally to height. At this season a portion of land is under plough for next year’s crops. It also affords grazing to numerous herds of cattle and flocks of sheep and goats belonging to the surrounding villages and numerous camps of Mahidasht Kurds, who dwell here during the summer, migrating in winter to the Garms'r about Khaniqm and Mandali. The hills north-east and south-west of the plain rise to a height of from 7,000 to 8,000 feet above the sea. The winter is severe, the plain being covered with snow, while in summer the temperature ranges from 90° at mid-day in July to 55° at night. The plain is celebrated as one of the most productive tracts of Persia. It is said to furnish two-thirds of the grain supply for the town of Kir- manshah, and its grain fetches 4 krans more per kharwcr than that from other parts of the province. The plain of Mahidasht numbers some 400 villages and hamlets, and is divided into two parts for revenue purposes, Mahidasht-Zanganeh on the right bank of the Mark and also on the opposite bank and Mahidasht Kalliur along the mountains forming the limits of the plain towards the Haranabad side. The population of Mahidasht plain is said to be some 6,000 families composed principally of Kalhurs, Zanganehs and Smjabis. Most of the inhabitants leave their villages to join their tribes in the qishl'qs near the frontier. They take with them their cattle and horses, and the cattle and horses of those who remain. The yaildqs of the Sinjabis are in the mountains to the north of the plain. Some Kalhurs have their yaildqs to the south of the plain. In the plain of Kirmanshah are also found small tribes which have no importance whatever. Such are the Mahmudwand of the Jaf-i-Fathbegi, the Turkanshawand, who number some 100 houses, and are also to be found in the- Parau mountains. The Shahrazuli, Khumavui, Zauleh Zanganeh, Baityaravand, etc. There are three routes from Mahidasht to Kirmanshah. The main route followed by all travellers, and two others only used by villagers. Of these two routes, the one leaves the main route at 2 farsakhs from Mahidasht, passes through the small valley between Mah'dasht and ’Ain-ul-Kosh, and thence to Tueh-Latif and Sarab ; the other leaves the main route in the Mahidasht, plain, passes by Gardaneh Milleh Chakhmagheh and reaches Siah Kamar north-west of Kirmanshah in the plain of Kirmanshah at If farsakhs from the town. The plain of Mahidasht is about 21- farsakhs in width and is ended by a range of mountains called Kuh-i-Lalaban which extends from Sar-Firuz- abad to Gardaneh Kurkur. The Kuh-i-Zangalian is joined at Qunrsheh, a village belonging to Saiyid Hassan Naghib, by a range of mountains which extends to Bar Firuzabad. From Kurkur to Haftashian the distance is said to be 4 farsakhs; that is to say, from the spot where the Mahidasht-Harunabad road passes through the Kurkur Mountain up* to Haftashian, the distance is 4 farsakhs.TIie Kuli-i-Lalabait, whicli ends at the Mahidasht-Harunabad road ia continued by the Gardaneh Kurkur, which extends up to Gahwareh, changing its name into Milieh-Maikhan (length 2 farsakhs) then into Kal-i-Kazi (length | farsakh), and finally into Milleh Kabud, this last mountain extending up to Gahwareh. The main road to Mahidasht, crosses the plain forming an angle of 110° with the mountain bordering the plain .—(Vaughan ; Rabino, 1907.)

MAJlDABAD (1)— A village in the district of Saveh 17 miles from Saveh, on the road to Qum. The village is a ruin, but it has a new and well-constructed brick caravansarai .—(Kinneir ; Abbott.) MAJlDABAD (2)— Some gardens and an enclosure so called, about 10J miles from Gulhak near Tehran, on the road thence to Eiruzkuh.—(Aapter.) MAKU (District). Maku is the general name given to the north-west corner of Azarbai- jan. The district which takes its name from the mountain stronghold of Maku extends from the Darreh Sham and Karaziadin valleys on the east, to Awajik on the west and from Mount Ararat (Agra Dagh) on the north to Kara Aineh [Chalderan] on the south. Its mountain system consists of the Agra Dagh range, extending from south-east to north west, some 46 miles in length; parallel to it and separated by the Bayazid-Danalu valley are the mountains ofMakfi, which, commencing in low hills, north of Kara-412 MAKft ziadm, reach to the north-west, gradually increasing in height as they approach the dividing range between Turkey and Persia, length about 52 miles. North-east from Karaziad n and extending as far as the Aras is the very broken and mountainous district of the Darreh Sham through which the Aq Chai flows to the Aras. The fourth and greatest range is that extend ing from Bayazld southward, forming the mountain wall between Persia and Turkey. The region is drained by two large rivers. The Zangmar Chai takes 'the northernmost drainage assisted by its three branches-—the Kizil Chai, Awajik Chai, and the Bayazid Chai. These rivers unite at the Maku ravine. The Aq Chai drains the elevated country between Zohrabad and Karaziadin, thence it flows to Marakand, where it is joined by the Kizil Chai, a fine river formed by the Koturu and Zilbir Chai, the united streams finally passing down the Darreh Sham valley to the Aras. The first impression of the district is one of utter desolation, of lofty and treeless mountains, of sterile and bare uplands. Further acquaintance, whilst confirming the first impression, discloses mountains which, though bare of trees, are at times covered with grasses which support a few nomads with their sheep, goats and horses. Rich valleys are also seen and fine crops of rice and cotton are grown on the river levels, whilst fair crops of wheat and barley are raised on the mountains wherever the slopes allow the use of the plough. The principal centres of life are in the valleys of Karaz adm, Maku, Awajik, Kara Aineh, Babajigh. _ , For information regarding the chief of Maku, and troops at his disposal; see article on Azarbaijan. MAKU—Elev. 3,740'. A town in Azarbaijan, on the left bank of the Alsas river (Maku Chai), 35 miles on the road from Bayazid to Makshvan from which it is about 46 miles distant. . . ■. * r The town, consisting of about 400 houses is situated m a gorge, f to £ mile broad, where the Zangmar river has cut a channel, 20 feet deep, 30 feet broad in the limestone rock, in the desolate region, south of Mount Ararat, in a valley formed by the Maku mountains and a small detached range of hills in the north. Timur Pasha Khan, the hereditary chief, has an irregular force of about 7,000 men. He is said to be merely a tool of the Russians, who supply him with ammunition. (M. P. Price, Decem ber 1912.) The Chief and his family belong to the sect of ’All Ilahi (q. v.). The entrance to the gorge is about 200 yards in breadth, the mountains on either side rounded, but gradually getting higher and higher till at Maku they present on both sides a precipitous lofty face to the ravine. An excellent carriage road threads the valley. The valley at Maku is about | mile in breadth, circular in form, enclosed apparently on all sides by gigantic clifis. On the north in the direct face of the cliff, which rises to a height of 5,650 feet, is an enormous natural overhanging arch, a vault of solid rock, perhaps 800 feet, in height. Under this is a ledge, 40 to 50 yards broad, occupied by a line of castellated houses, the former residences of the Chiefs of Maku. Below the castle slopes a debris of rock, and there the eye falls on a white-walled palace, built far out into the valley on a projecting ledge. The modern village is built at the footof the debris fairly secure against falling boulders ; the ruined houses of the old village are perched as close as possible to the castle. An old wall with bas tions enclosed the old town but this has been removed to make room for the modern houses, and can only be traced in parts. At the river level the scene changes; here are the residences of the chief, his son and nephews, a line of white palaces facing the river, enclosed in vineyards. High up on the cliff is a roadway leading to a cavern — at one time the refuge of a band of robbers who were destroyed by order of Shah ’Abbas, 1605 A. D. (1014 A. H.). The road-way was blown up, and an inscription was cut at the foot of the rock recording the event. The cavern is popularly supposed to lead into the bowels of the moun tains. There is a much older inscription than the foregoing cut but of the rock near the entrance to the cavern. It is in the old Gurjistan charac ter, and has been sculptured across the face of a large cross at the mouth of the cave. There were five of these crosses, but only two with the writing. The cliff was unscaleable but by means of ropes and grappling irons, and the assistance of the Maku people the cavern might be approached and copies of the inscription taken. Many roads radiate from here to the Turkish and Kussian frontiers, which are very easy considering the mountainous nature of the country. Those communicating with Bayazid on the west and the Aras on the east are passable for all arms, and carriages, such as victorias and landaus (of which there are some 10 or 20 in Maku) are in daily use by the chief and his relatives. Northward through the Agra Dagh range, also, there are several roads, one of which is sometimes driven over by the chief when going to Erivan. West and south mule-tracks connect with Awajik and Kara Aineh. Maku is thus well in touch with Russia and Turkey, as well as having a ready line open to Karaziadin and Kh5i. The Chief of Maku has always had the right of free importation, and thus Russian goods enter duty free almost completely ousting British trade {via Persia). See Azarbaijan.

It passes for half a mile between walls of rock, rising to 200 and 300 feet in the perpendicular and divided by a space of 15 to 20 yards only at the narrowest point. A new road was being cut sheer into the face of the cliff in 1874 by the Persian engineers. There are traces of an old road and very curious relics of two old bridges.— {Napier.) MALIK KANDl— A large village in Azarbaijan, 14£ miles from Bunab and 12 miles from Mianduab. It is situated on the Murdichai, which is dry in the autumn.

MALUCHEH or MALICHEH— A village in the Darreh Buzurg district of Malayar on the southern slopes of the Tajar Kuh.— {Schindler.) MAMA-GAN— A large village of 500 houses in Azarbaijan, lying in the hill district to the left of the Tabriz-Bunab road, about 20 miles south of the former. The inhabitants do not grow sufficient corn for their own consumption here. This has apparently long been the condition of agriculture in this district, but of late years a large demand for dried fruits for foreign export has stimu lated the production of fruits, rendering the villages more dependent than ever on external support of grain. Probably not more than an average of a month’s supply for each family would be found in the villages at any time of the year, and in the summer much less. This would be available only at a very high price or by prompt requisition. Forage would be even more difficult to find in any large quantities. Chopped straw is the principalforage used. In autumn and early winter there would be a considerable quantity found stored for the winter supply of cattle owners ; at other times very little. In spring and early summer unlimited pasturage would be found along the edge of the lake basin. Firewood may be procured in large quanti ties from the gardens and plantations. Carriage is unprocurable save to a very small extent, there being but few nomads, the export trade being carried on mostly by carriers from Tabriz. Water is everywhere procurable, either m small streams flowing from the Sahand or by digging to a depth of 10 or 12 feet. It is of good quality. The climate is most favourable and healthy.— (Napier.)

Supplies in small quantities are procurable, and water is obtained from a “ kdrizT A flourishing town of some 15,000 inhabitants in Azarbaijan on the Safichai, 80 miles from Tabriz by the road via Gugan. This town was the residence of Hulaku Khan, who reigned in the 13th century. A building in the town is known as the tomb of Hulaku Khan; but that prince, as we know from history, was buried in the Shahu peninsula. In another building, called the Gumbad-i-Kabud (blue dome), is said to be the grave of one of Hulaku Khan’s wives. On the eastern side of the town °is a large burial ground with some tombstones dating from the 16th centurv. On a hill west of the town stood the famous observatory (rasad) which Hulaku Khan had constructed under the direction of the great astronomer Nasir-ud-Din Tusi. The hills west of Maragheh consist of horizontal layers of sand-stone covered by pieces of basalt, and the top of the hill, on which to a foot in thickness. The town is pleasantly situated in a long narrow valley running nearlv north and south, at the extremity of a well-cultivated plain opening to Lake Urumleh from, which Maragheh is distant some 9 to 10 guiles.

Only the foundations of the observatory are to be seen ; the walls were 4| C300GSB418 MARAKAND. place is surrounded by orchards and vineyards watered by canals from the Safiehai, which gives a plentiful water-supply. The town is encompassed by a high wall, in many places in ruins, and has five gates. Two stone bridges, one of six, the other of five arches, said to have been constructed during Hulaku Khan’s reign in the 13th century, lead over the river on the western side of the town. Water plentiful from the Safichal; forage is procurable ; also pasturage to a small extent; carriage in any quan tity is not to be obtained ; only a few mules ; fuel is abundant. There is a telegraph station here on the Tabriz-Sauj Bulagh line of the Persian system. The troops in garrison consist of an infantry regiment and a detachment of artillery, but these like most Persian troops probably only exist on paper. The famous marble pits of Maragheh are situated about 6 miles from Deh Khazagan, in the district of Maragheh, a few hundred yards to the right of the road, at the entra nce of an inconsiderable plain, which here stretches up from the lake and forms a sort of open bay among the prongs of the Sahand range. These pits are well deserving of examination by geologists. They extend over a space of about half a mile in circumference, are small and irregular, and do not appear to have been even sunk below 10' or 12' in depth ; the sides are cut perpendicularly, and in the section thus exposed the strata of marble may be seen running in parallel and horizontal layers, the first occurring at about 5' or 6' below the surface, and the succeeding strata at intervals of about 2'; the average breadth of the layer of marble may be 7 or 8 inches. A multitude of springs, strongly impregnated with carbonic acid gas, are seen bubbling up among the pits in all directions. On the escape of the gas, a copious deposit is left of carbonate of lime, and the channels in which the waters run are thus raised up into little rocky ridges, varying in height from 1' to 2' above the plain. The marble is the semi-crystalline formation of this deposit, though why it should thus form only in thin horizontal layers, several feet beneath the surface, may perhaps be an interesting subject of inquiry. This Mara gheh marble is highly valued in Persia ; when formed into thin plates it is nearly transparent, and is used as windows to the baths at Tabriz. In larger slabs it is frequently used for pavements to baths and palaces, and the famous throne in the Divan Khaneh at Tehran is formed of the same material. There is a small village at this place called Dash Kasan, inhabit ed by the labourers, who work the quarries. The direction from Gugan is about 18° west.— {Curzon; Schindler.) MARAKAND— A large village of Azarbaijan of 500 houses, situated near the junction of the Aq Chah and Qutur Chai rivers, in an enclosed valley, on a rich soil where fine crops of wheat, barley and rice are raised. The people are more than usually well off and possess nu ny sheep and goats. They are well armed and are gradually getting Berdans or Martinis. On the south is a precipitous hill about ROOO' high on the eastern front of which is a remark able cave. The cliff is difficult of access, but along its front runs a edge toMABAR—MAftAN 419 which a zig-zag path leads. The ledge, 2 or 3 feet wide, leads horizontally to the mouth of a tunnel which, after a short distance, opens into a cavern with a wide fissure in its front face. This fissure 30' high has been built up with masonry, and a breastwork raised to enable men to fire over the aperture. The foot of the cliff is about 80 yards below. Water is stored in a rock-cut basin, and a narrow aperture gives out on a break-neck path leading to the mountain above. The cave commands the Avoglu-Julfa road. Gold has been found in the plain near by, but not in paying quanti ties. During flood time (in spring) the river floods the lower part of the valley and the road to Karazladln has to take to the hill side. In ordinary dry weather, with the river at its usual level, carriages can pass fairly easily.— (Picot, 1894.) MARAK, MARRAGH, KHARABEH, or MIRIK— A village in the Dukhan District, 126 miles from Tehran and 61 from Hamadan, on the road between the two.

It contains 80 to 100 houses inhabited by Bilawarl Kurds, Sunn's and is the residence of Agha Khan. It has a plantation of trees’ chiefly poplars, a garden and a considerable amount of cultivation, of which wheat and tobacco form a cons ; derable part. Melons and pumpkins are largely grown in the summer ; good grazing ; water plentiful from a stream. Supplies : 20 horses, 50 cows, 600 sheep and goats, and donkeys. Roads run from here to Juanrud and Kirmanshah, distant 28^ and 45* miles, res pectively.—( Vaughan.) MARAN (2).— A plain in the Kirmanshah province. About 10 mdes south-west of Kangavar where 2 branches of the Kar- kh h join. The first and most inconsiderable has its commencement about 25 miles west of Hamadan, the second has three springs on the side of Mount Alvand, 6 or 8 miles south of that place. The latter runs south- westwards till it meets the former in the plain of Maran about 10 miles south-west of Kangavar.— (Rabino, 1907.) MARAND.—Elev. 3,950'. A small town m Azarbaijan of about 3,000 houses, the seat of the Governor of the district, and boasting a fine bazaar. The district grows a la&gt;rge amount of fruit, in which an*export is done with Russia ; also of gums, carpets, wool and honey. Russian cottons are more popular then Eng lish. Between Marand and Khoi are found very large deposits of rock salt, large mountains being sometimes almost entirely composed of it Maku and the Bayazid district of Turkey are supplied with salt from here. The Persian army list shews two half-battalions and a regiment of artil lery at Marand, but their existence is very doubtful. It is the plaoe120 MARA—MAKG where the Sowar Galibiri-ve-Bikam-i-Marand and the Sowar Mukri irregular cavalry, nominal strength 350, probable strength 170, are recruited. Strategically it occupies an important position. Its left; flank rests against the Musho Dagh, its right agsnist the Kara Dagh, both very difficult ranges, and on it converge two main caravan routes, from Julfa, on the north, and from Kizil Dizeh, on the Trebizond road, on the west. The village itself, lying in the valley, is commanded on every side, but above it between the ranges is a position offering every advantage to a defending force, w T hich could only be turned from Kh6I. The surrounding hills are all very desolate and barren. Nothing larger than a camel bush grow*s in the valley or on the mountain. Life, too, except for a few nomads and their tents, is absent. There is a Persian Government telegraph station here. In December 1911 Marand was occupied by Russian troops, when an advance was made to Tabriz and Kh6L During 1912 the number of Russian troops maintained here was reported to be about 1.000.— (Picot, October 1894.)

A village and fort on a plain of the same name, situated among valleys with good grazing ground, it is the largest of the dependencies of Sinneh. The lofty and rugged mountains of Avroman overlook the fort on its south aspect; near as they appear to be, they are distant 6 farsakhs, or a long day’s march. There are three passes which lead up the Avroman hills by precipitous paths so narrow that two people cannot go abreast. The hills round Marlvan and Avroman are densely covered with a fine forest of oak, walnut, chenar, or plane tree and various wild fruit-trees. The gathering of gall-nuts is one of the chief occupations of the people and the nuts are exported, not to Sulaimanleh in Turkish Kurdistan, which is comparatively near, but to Hamadan, some four marches beyond Sinneh For description of fort see under Marlvan (district).

The old castle of Marlvan was destroyed in 1635 by order of the Shah Safi I to prevent Kurdish rebel chiefs taking refuge in it. Farhad Mirza, Mu’tamid ud'Dauleh, Governor of Kurdistan built a new fort in 1871 and placed on its bastions two 9-pounder guns and two 18-pounder guns. He also provided for a good water-supply by having a special kandt (underground channel) dug At the same time Prince Farhad Mirza settled some families at the foot of the fort and named the settlement Shahabad. Muhammad Ah Khan, Zafar-ul-Mulk, afterwards added some buildings a caravansarai, a hammiim, and a garden with another kandt. The fort is a substantial stone enclosure, about 300 yards square but as the cement is friable, it requires frequent repair. It is commanded bv422 HARM—MARY some low hills, and is of little use. The garrison used to be (in 1871) 30 artillerymen and a company of the Fauj-i-Kurdistan. At 3,000 to 4,000 paces from Kaleh-Shahabad on the summit of a hill is the old Kaleh Mari van, in olden times one of the strongholds of the Valis and capital of their dominions. It is situated in a position of great strength. Some twenty times did Turks and Persians meet in battle array in the plain down below. In this ancient fort Algas Mirza, who had taken arms against his brother Shah Tahmasp L, surrendered in 1005 A. H. (1597) to Surkhab Beg, Vail of Kurdistan, who obtained for him the royal pardon. The local levies, or militia, of [Marlvan are subordinate to the Mustaufi Bashi, or Hakim of Mari van ; they consist of about 1,500 tufangchis, armed with flint guns, and 200 horsemen. Only half the tufangchis serve at one time. A regiment of infantry, nominally of eight companies of 100 each, and called Fauj-i-Kurdistan (Zafar regiment), is furnished by the surrounding districts as their quota for the regular forces ; this is not under the authority of the Hakim of Marlvan, but is commanded entirely by its Sartip. The names of these officials, respectively, are Mirza Muhammad Sadiq and Muhammad ’AH Khan. The regiment was_ armed with heavy muzzle loading muskets, sighted to 550 yards.” Resources. —Exports from Marivan to Turkey consist of the so-called ‘ ‘ red ’ ’ tobacco, carpets, silk tissues, henna, wooden combs, mercery, and dried fruits. Imports from Sulaimanleh and Panjvin comprise gall-nuts, iron, worked iron, dates, a few prints, tea, and sugar. For the year January 21, 1902, to January 20, 1903, exports to Turkey amounted to Krs. 4,808 and imports to Krs. 97,690.

MASAL— A pass leading over the mountain N. E. of Masuleh from Gllan to Azarbaijan. The ascent from the village of Shalimeh in the north is about 14 miles and the descent to the village of Diz is about 10 miles. Fraser says that the ascent consists of a succession of passes of unequalled length and steepness, the road for the most part leads right up the face of a projec tion from the great range above, seldom slanting along the side, so that there is no relaxation of toil, no level space, and no descents whatever, all being fair continued breasting. The path, if such it may be called, is of a nature to aggravate this labour exceedingly, especially after rain, when the soil is exceedingly heavy, and sometimes almost impassable! Ihe latter part of the ascent, after trees are left behind, is over a good road gradually rising till just before reaching Ihe crest there is a steep Pi'll- Tlie descent is at first gradual over turf, but lower the road becomes rocky and rough, and winds precipitously along the rap'd descent of the bed of a torrent to the village of Gilivan. From this it still con tinues down the stream for 2 miles, when it leaves it and enters the dry bed of a torrent, and follows it among low and bare sandy hillocks as far as Diz. This is not the main pass to Azarbaijan, which goes from Gaskar, but it ascends the mountains to the east of it.

History In 1668 there was a Cossack descent on Mazandaran , they took and sacked Earahabad, but were immediately afterwards attacked and driven out by the Persians. In 1723 a treaty was signed between Peter the Great and Shah Tahmasp, one of the principal clauses of which was that Persia ceded Gilan, Mazandaran and Astrabad to_ Russia The Russians however, never seem to have sat fast m Mazandaran, though they were in de facto possession of Gilan. However, in 1734 the Russians finally evacuated Gilan, whether due to the pernicious climate, to internal trouble or to fear of Nadir Shah, the fact remains that in 1746 all that was left of the former Russian occupation was a factory at Enzall and an agent at Barband. „ ^ In 1913, the distribution of Russian troops m the district was as ^Astarabad. —Two Companies 19th Turkistan Rifles, 200 Toman Cosaacks.

In the troubles succeeding the death of Nadir Shah, Mazandaran, which was the native province of the Qajars, followed the fortunes of Agha Muhammad, and since his fmal war has remained in undisputed possession of the Persian Crown. _ _ On July 18th, 1911, the ez-Sha]^ Muhammad 'All Qajar, landed at Oumesii Tappeh near Astarabad, and after g°i n g to Shahrud, he advanced m two columns through Mazandara^ towards Tehran.

On September 5th (1911) a government force of 1,000 men, under Yprim, (Ephraim), the Armenian, and Sardar Bahadur, Bakhtiari, defeated the royalists west of Aradan captured (he Mazandaran force and shot Sardar Arshad. This disposed of the ez-Shahs. Geography .—A province of Persia lying between the southern coast of the Caspian and the Elburz range ; bounded on the north by the Caspian, on the east by the province of Astrabad, on the south by the Elburz range, and on the west by the province of Gilan. It has a length of about 220 miles and an average width of about 60 miles. Mazandaran may be divided into two distinct descriptions of country ; the low, marshy, and impenetrable jungle-clad plains, varying in breadth from 10 to 30 miles along the south coast of the Caspian, and the elevated and forest-clad spur from the northern face of Elburz; both these in their peculiar way partake, in the highest degree, of the impracticability usual to such countries. The following general de'scription of the province, which was given by Fraser, holds good to the present day: — 4 £ The surface, where not cultivated, consists of natural or artificial swamps, overgrown with forest trees and thorns, particularly bramble bushes of incredible luxuriance and perfectly impervious. Indeed, these brambles are called by the inhabitants the ‘ Pahlwan-i-Mazandaran, that is, the heroes, or guardians, of Mazandaran, and well do they deserve the appellation. ■&lt; -- &lt;- Above this flat space tower the mountains, assuming the appearance of two ranges, the first of which is clothed with forests as dense as those below, and which throw forward spurs and shoulders that sometimes reach the coast. Beyond this wooded and buttressed wall, the peaks and masses of the second are seen, snow-spotted even in September. It is in ascending these that one meets with the most difficult passes. Among their recesses, and even on their summits as well as on those of the wooded hills below, are found the ‘ yailaqs ’, or summer quarters to which the inhabitants resort in the heat of that season. The whole of these wooded mountains are pervaded by paths and passes so intricate that none but an experienced guide can find his way from one place to another ; but the long winding tracks that lead through fhe foothills and the low plain are equally perplexing and more difficult, following, as they do generally, the windings of streams and rivers that keep to no particular bed, and involving the traveller in swamps, creeks, and quicksands against which, as they shift with every flood, no experience can guard. These dense jungles and swamps are the birthplaces of all the ill-health and disease, the hosts of flies, insects and reptiles, and the other abominations that infest Mazandaran. 1 The beach, which bounds this flat is a strip of sand and gravel, thrown up by the wash of the surf, which is driven against the southern shore with great violence by the prevailing wind from the north. In fact, the whole coast is lined by a chain of sand-hills, rising sometimes from 25 to 30 feet in height, and 20 yards in breadth, behind which lies a morass of stagnant428 MAZANDARiN water from the numerous streams and rivers that, decending from the mountains, are prevented by these sand-hills from finding their way into the sea. Wherever a river does force its way through them, there is a continual battle between it and the surf, which latter throws up a bar that shuts up the channel entirely, so that its waters will accumulate and spread behind the sand-hills for mile?, sluggish and dead, and only finding their way to the sea by filtration, or very small streams beneath the sand, until a flood enables it to sweep bar and all before it. It is by these stagnant waters, or ‘ murd-abs ’ (dead waters) as the natives call them, that the lakes arid harbours of Salian, Enzali, Langarud, Mashad-i-Sar, Astrabad and others, have been formed. ‘ ‘ The banks of these dead, or rather back waters, to speak more properly, are overgrown with alders of enormous size, with plane-trees, elms, ashes, poplars and other trees which love a moist soil; and in the rainy season the country round is all flooded, so as to exhibit the singular spectacle of a bound less forest in a swamp. Yet scattered amongst these swamps, behind these ‘ murd-abs’, and sometimes between them and the sand-hills, the traveller may find numerous villages and clusters of houses inhabited by the culti vators of the rice-fields around. But a stranger would pass a dozen of these, and never suspect the existence of a human being, unless he chanced to see the smoke curling upwards from some of their fires or to hear the bark of one of their dogs ; and yet from each of these mahallehs there is always more than one pathway, which leads to the seabeach, for the inhabitants have a con siderable traffic which is carried on by sea, and at certain seasons the peop 1 e live on fish, salmon, mullets, and other excellent kinds, which come to the coast, particularly in autumn and winter. Mountains. —The mountain system of Mazandaran consists entirely of the northern spurs thrown out from the Elburz mountains towards the Caspian. The length of these spurs varies from 30 to 50 miles, and they approach to within from 1 to 30 miles of the sea. They are all of a very difficult and impracticable nature, being covered with dense forest for a great portion of their slopes. Rivers .—The rivers of Mazandaran all rise in the northern slopes of the Elburz and consequently none of them have any great length, and are really no more than mountain torrents, most of them being very low in dry weather, but subject to, very sudden and dangerous rises after rain and during the melting of the snow. There are nearly fifty of them. Their names in succession from w T est to east are as follows : Surkhani (which separates this province from GUan) Turkrud, Safarud or Ab-i-Sikhtsar, Barisheh, Nasiehrud, Chalkrud, Shirrud, Vachek, Shahr-i-Kalan (?), Mazar, Tirpurdehsar, Zuvar Kileh, Izarud, Nashtarud, Pasandehruu, Asp- i-Chin, Asgharabad, Tilrud, Palangrud, Kalarabad, Namakabrud, Nurud, Rudpusht, Sardabrud, Chains, Kurkrud, Mashalak, Shamjaran (?), Khair- rud, Mazigahrud, Duzdakehrud, Namakarbrud, Shaikhrud (?), Kackehrud, Ahlamrud, Sulehdeh, Rustamrud. ’Izzatdeh, Narhaz, Babil, Talar, Slahrud, Tajin, Burj-i-’All Naqi. Burj-i-Zardi, Burj-i-Nika, Burj-i-Gauhar Baran. These last names are the names of towers at the mouths of four branches of the Nika river. No other important rivers are crossed betwen Nika and Ashraf.mazakdaran 429 Holmes remarked that all the rivers on the Mazandaran coast have a long sandbank at their mouths, projecting from their west banks and stretching east, to which point they take a turn, flowing almost parallel to the shore before entering the sea : this occurs even when the rivers approach the coast in a north or north-west direction. From this fact it is evident that the prevailing winds are from the west and north-west, and the waves run ning one way and the streams another, gradually raised banks between tnem. All the rivers of Mazandaran are well stocked with fish. Climate. The climate of Mazandaran is universally condemned It is extremely capricious and not naturally divided into wet and dry, or cold and hot seasons : one year it pours for a month without cessation, and the same month m the next year may be quite dry. Though not nearly so damn ' S Gilan, it must be termed a humid climate, for there is no day throughout the year m which the people can rely on dry weather. The rainfall is five times as great as it is in the south. From December to April are the wettest, as also the coldest months. The summers are very hot and tie weather then is subject to very great changes, of temperature which occasion much sickness. It is the same in winter; the inhabitants are sometimes forced to throw off their warm clothing and in summer they are obliged to have recourse to their “positins”, or sheepskin cloaks, and fuis Snow often falls heavily, and, though it does not remain so lone as in the upper country to the south, it.is a mistake to think that it does not he at all. The cold of summer is damp and unwholesome, causing many diseases. Rheumatism and dropsies are commoh, and complaints of the eyes still more so. Many cases of cataract ocQur, and frequently a strange loss of sight, without much appearance of external disease many of the inhabitants certainly have a sallow look, but others are re markably stout and athletic. Population^mng to the nature of the country and the customs of retiring to 1 ailaqs or summer quarters in the summer, a large proportion of the population is migratory; and with them is a fair sprinklinsr of nomad tribes who have become village-settlers, but whom the summer heat tempts to wander again. Fraser who expected to find the Mazandaranis “ a wretched puny and diseased-looking race, with frames enfeebled and little energy of either body or mmd ’^says, this is far from being the case. The complexion oi the Mazandaranis, who remain below the hills during the hot months are no doubt rather more sallow than those of the men of Upper Persia • but the people themselves are, in general, remarkably stout-limbed and well formed, with more than ordinarily handsome countenances. The intellect of the Mazandaranis has been described by the rest of eir countrymen, as that of the Boeotian by the Greeks, as notorious for stupidity and brutality, but I suspect on no sufficient grounds. They are called Mazandaram yabus, a nickname which may have a double meaning the province being m reality celebrated for a breed of yabus, or small horses which are highly esteemed for their powers of endurance. The peasants ane, to be sure, less acute than those of ’Iraq, who live in villages near the great roads; but I saw no symptoms of extraordinary stupidity As regards their own interest they were sharp enough, as we had cause to0 M AZANDARAN know ; and certainly in point of curiosity they do not fall behind their neighbours.” The above is extracted from Fraser’s report, who, however, did not form a very favourable opinion of their general character, as he says they are not nearly so friendly or polite to strangers as other natives of Persia and that even the well-to-do people are extremely ignorant and, to our ideas, but slightly civilized. He considered that they were really quiet, in offensive people, but brave and good soldiers in their own climate. Their bigotry in religious matters is great, but it is chiefly in forms for there are few, who do not transgress every article of inhibition ; all of them drink strong liquors and eat opium ; the Prince himself, with all his suite, regales, himself unreservedly with the ‘ mai-ul-hayat’. The majority of the inhabitants of the lowlands, especially in Western Mazandaran, speak Mazandarani, a dialect closely connected with Gilek although at some places a Gilek fails to understand a Mazandarani. The tribesmen speak Turkish or Kurdish as the case may be. “ Their dress differs little in essentials from the national Persian garb. Every man who travels, whether mounted or on foot, clothes himself in a pair of ‘ shulvdrs ’, or immense trunk trousers, into which the skirts of his ulcaluc, or vest, are stuffed. They bind their legs in rolls of cloth instead of stockings, and the feet are cased in a pair of shoes called ‘ charugh ’ , made after the fashion of the Kurds, like leather bags drawn round the instep and ankle in puckers, by a thong. “ The women here, as elsewhere, use the veil thrown over their person when they go out ; these are made of silk, or of cotton cloth, checked ; the check is sometimes bme, in large squares, sometimes red, and occa sion illy red and green. They draw upon their legs a sort of stocking call ed ( chakchor which takes inthe trousers like a boot; and over these they wear the usual green and high-heeled slipper. It is surprising to see through what deep mud they can make their way without soiling the stock ings, or without even dirtying their shoes very much. Towns. —The principal towns in Mazandaran are Sari the capital, Amul, Barfarush, Mashad-i-Sar, and Ashraf, all of which are described under their proper headings. Resources. —The production of Mazandaran are chiefly rice, sugar, cotton, a little silk, and a variety of fruits. It is difficult to form any idea as to the amount of the yearly produce, as the natives themselves cannot do more than make guesses, and these differ. ‘ ‘ The whole extent of the country, between the foot of the hills and the sea is said to present a succession of large and populous villages, em bosomed indeed in wood, quite surrounded also with cultivation ; the greater part of this is of rice, for which the country is best adapted ; but cotton and sugar are also very much planted. ‘ ‘ The farmers transplant their rice, as in Bengal, and raise the plants from seed : this is done from one to two months after the Nauruz, or vernal, equinox, and they reap it in about 100 days after. Cotton and sugar are also planted at this time ; the latter requires twelve months to ripen, as in other places ; but all the canes are small and poor, few being ever found thicker than a man’s finger, and the produce is of very inferiorMAZANDARAN 431 quality, being dark and moist. Both these defects, in all probability, arise from want of skill in the cultivation and preparation of this valuable plant. Tobacco does not succeed in Mazandaran ; its produce is harsh and bad, and all who are found of good smoking import their tobacco from Shiraz and Tabas. Silk is not produced in any great quantity, nor is opium much or successfully cultivated, although the poppy which produces it grows sufficiently well. The land in Mazandaran yields only one full crop in the year, but barley is sown occasionally in spring, for horses and cattle, as a green crop ; it is cut about this time, after which they plough up the ground, and plant it with rice, which is produced in great quantities : Great quantities are sent to Tehran, Gilan, Kazvin, Tabriz, and Russia and it forms also the principal food of the inhabitants. The sugar is mostlv consumed in the province ; the cotton is used in native manufactures, and some is also sent to Gilan. The silk is comparatively small in quantity, and of inferior quality to that of Gilan ; it is used in native manufactures, mixed with cotton. Beans, wheat, and barley are grown in the moun tainous districts, and some flax in the lowlands. During the winter, a great many labourers come from the upper country and are employed here ; their wages at this se son is about 6d. a day. “ The principal fruits are a great variety of the orange, lemon, and citron species, the Persian names of some of which are as follows : tuisurkh ndrmuf, the mandarin orange ; badrang, a very large kind of citron, with a knotty, rough and thick rind ; mined), a fruit, in shape something like a pear, and of a pleasant acid, the colour, both inside and outside, is that of a lemon ; timu, sweet and sour lemons, ndrangi ; a bitter orange like the Seville, and iuisabz, balang, tabushghabi, dardbi, turanj, varieties of the above-named fruits ; Sultan Murakabat, a shaddock, rather a rare fruit sometimes weighing 6 or 7 pounds. “ There are evergreens, which in winter give a lively and cheerful ap pearance to the gardens, which are filled with them. A great quantity of ab-i-narangi, the juice of some of the species, expressed and put into bottles, is sent to the interior, and is used in making sharbats. Besides these fruits, there are to be found apples, pomegranates, quinces, pears, peaches, walnuts, grapes and melons. The vines are seen climbing the trunks of the forest-trees, and their stems are sometimes 8' and 10' in diameter. The appearance of the melons is here the reverse of those of the upper provinces of Persia ; the water-melon of Mazandaran being long and of a greenish yellow, like the ordinary bread melon ; while the bread-melon is a round, dark, mottled, green fruit, like most water-melons.” The climate and marshy soil of the lower parts of Mazandaran seem well-adopted to the growth of the sugarcane. The appearance of a field of this plant is that of a dense mass of ordinary reeds of a height of about 5 feet. The canes kept for planting are preserved under ground during the winter and in the month of March, the ground having been prepared, they are cut into pieces of two or three joints, and planted in rows. At each joint there is a bud, and each bud produces from eight to as many as ten shoots. The canes arrive at maturity in about eight months, when they are cut down close to the roots. The process of expressing the juice is verv crude and, as no attempt is made to purify the liquor, the sugar has a strong432 MlZANDARAN unpleasant flavour. A machine expresses in one day about 15 mans shdhi of juice which yields 5 mans shdhi of sugar, or about TO lbs. Mazandaran produces mineral pitch, which is found in abundance in different states, from petroleum to the choicest kind of naphtha, and is applied to many useful purposes. There is a good deal of iron, lead and copper ore in the Elburz range, and the country is rich in timber of all sorts, which with a proper system of forestry would be a great source of wealth. There is a very sturdy breed of small ponies called “ Yabus ” which are used for pack transport and can carry enormous loads. The cattle of Mazandaran are very small and have humps like the Indian cattle ; the sheep are likewise small, but have not fat tails, like those of ’Iraq. The mountains of Mazandaran abound in wild beasts ; among others the tiger, panther, bear, wolf, goat, and deer of different kinds; wild boars are found in vast quantities. Pheasant, woodcock, and wild duck are abundant all over the province. All the rivers are exceedingly well stocked with fish, which is the staple food of the peasantry ; among these are the orang (represented as a very large fish), ispek, the dzddmohi or Caspian salmon, saf dmchi (a kind of mullet), kupur, (carp), seluqa, and kizl- ala (trout), sagmdhl, or sturgeon, and soame, a fish, common to the Russian rivers. There are practically no vehicles in the country all transport being pack. The principal external trade is done with Russia from Mashad-i-Sar to Baku (for details see article on that port). For Consular trade report on the Caspian provinces see under ‘ ‘ Rasht’ ? . The revenue of the province amounts to about 1^ million krdns, though how much of this reaches the royal treasury is not to be ascertained. Military. —Mazandaran furnishes 9 infantry regiments of a nominal strength of 1,000 men each ; 1,600 irregular cavalry, of whom probably only 800 are really effective. The rifles in use in Mazandaran are principally the Berdan and Werndl, but these are mainly private property and not supplied by the State.— {Fraser ; Holmes ; Picot; Schindler; Curzon ; Rahino.) This article should be read in conjunction with that on Gilan, as the two provinces have much in common, and the one will act as a comple ment to the other. Fortresses. —There are no fortified places in the province. Harbours. —The only place that can be dignified with the name of a harbour is Mashad-i-Sar {q.v.). The Master of the Persian Mint tried to open up Mahmudabad (f/.u.) twelve miles due north of Amul with which he connected it, by rail, the project, however, failed, and there is now no trade there. Administration. —Mazandaran is ruled by a Governor, who is no better or no worse than other provincial rulers. There is no provision, for instance, for the repair of roads, no penalty for breaking them up to forward private objects. When any part becomes impassable, an order for repairing it is sent by the governor of the district to the next village, and this is obeyed at all times in the most superficial manner. All other matters of police are on a like loose and inefficient footing.MAZAN—MAZAR 433 Communications. —In a country so difficult as Mazandaran, with a Gov ernment so apathetic as that of the Shah, it is only to be expected that communications would be indifferent, and such they are. There are two made roads in the province ; from Amul to Tehran, skirting the eastern base of Damavand, constructed by the Austrian enigneer, General Gastei- ger Khan by order of the late Shah and from Barfarush also to Tehran via Firiizkuh : both are tolerably good. The roads of the interior occasion great fatigue and destruction of the horses. The only tolerable route, and the one, which is always adopted by muleteers when possible, lies along the sands on the sea-shore; but experienced guides are necessary to point out the fords of the numerous rivers, which are full of quicksands ; and the fatigue of crossing these streams may be conceived when the number of them between Langarud and the Harhaz is 136. Fraser, who visited the province before the existence of these two roads thus describes the internal communications of Mazandaran :— “ Certainly I never saw, nor can I imagine, a stronger or more impractic able country, from a military point of view, than these provinces. Roads —that is, made roads—there are none, except the great causeway, made of old by Shah ’Abbas, and this has now so nearly disappeared, that it requires a guide to find it ; and, even when found, it would be useless for military purposes, from the numerous breaks and gaps in its course, and from the impenetrable jungle which surrounds it on all sides, and affords cover for all sorts of ambuscades and surprises. But for their paths, who except themselves, could discover them ? A dense hedge, a perfect wall of bramble, blackthorn, and thick boxwood, cemented with wild vine and other creeping plants that r in up and overtop the trees. It is of great thickness, often approaches within 30 yards of the water’s edge, and usuallv terminates in one of those swamps and jungles I have described. No one ir his senses would be mad enough to attempt to penetrate it, but a guide will show you a “hole in the wall,” a crevice, a thing like a rabbit run through which he introduces you to a pathway at first scarcely percep tible, winding like a snake through the bushes, but which increases 'in size as you get on, not, however, in facility, for it is intersected by at least a dozen deep natural creeks, through the mire and water of which your horse must flounder, or he may have the choice of a precarious bridge of boughs • or, for variety, after a little space you may have to tread through artificial ci ts, made for irrigation no less deep and difficult than the natural creeks as your poor lo.d-horses soon find out, and which flood the whole vicinitv so that you travel girth-deep in the soil; and thus, if you survive after a* circuitous and perilous pilgrimage, you reach the mahalleh or village.” MAZAR— A river in Mazandaran which flows into the Caspian at the village of Mazar, 5 miles west of Khurramabad. It has a considerable stream in the summer, though in December it does not contain much water. At its mouth are fisheries of azad-mahi, the Caspian salmon. The fish are caught all the year round, either in wires or with a lonff- CSOOCSR 1 three '2 ron S 9d fork : but tke Principal seasons are during the434 MAZA—MAZE spring and autumn, when sometimes as many as ten horse-loads a day are taken.— {Fraser — Holmes.)

The soil of th ; s district is throughout extremely rich at the upper end of the plain, where many streams descend from the mountains to the north and east, and the higher level of the beds of the two great rivers affords facilities for irrigation. Cultivation is abundant, but as the plain slopes down gradually to the shores of the lake, the Jaghatu and Tatau wear themselves into deeper channels, the difficulty of raising the water into artificial ducts is increased, and the greater part of the land is allowed to run waste, serving at best for the winter pasturage of the flocks belong ing to the Makadam Mikarl nomads.—(isWZmsfm.)

There is a telegraph station here of the Indo-European line and a Per sian Government office. It is unhealthily situated and infested with poisonous bugs. The effects of the bite of the poisonous bug of Mianeh (which by-the-bye is very common in many other places in Northern Persia) have been much exaggerated. I know several Europeans who have been bitten, and I have been bitten myself. We suffered from remittent fever in consequence, and the bitten parts ulcerated and healed up in a couple of weeks or so. This fever in my case lasted a couple of months.— (Schind ler.) The bug, or tick, is the Argas Persicus and locally known as Kaneh Shab- gaz. — (Schindler, 1910.)

The villagers are very exacting towards pilgrims, 2 or 3 of the villagers were hanged by order of ’Ala-ud-Dauleh for molesting pilgrims. Provisions are scarce and have to be brought from long distances. Water abundant. Taylor says : “It has a few stone huts and a ruined caravansarai. A garrison of 100 infantry occupies a fort, situated in a dell, surrounded by high and precipitous hills, on the sides of which grow stunted oaks and poplars.” In 1907 there had been no garrison here for some years.— (Taylor — Babino, 1907.)

The Mikri chiefs declare they value a family of their own peasantry as equal to two or even three Turkish families. The Kurd never visits his chief without the'offering of a lamb or sheep, and in any exigency, when he is suddenly called upon to produce a large sum of money, the chief is sure of being cheerfully assisted by all his peasants to the utmost of their means. Still, however,' the Kurds are half savage, and thus the traveller in passing casual ly through the country, and perceiving their dirty miserable villages is apt to infer distress and poverty, and to argue inferiority of their general condition to that of the peasantry of other countries. Physically they are of remarkably fine stature, their black, well kept beards giving them a very martial appearance. Their dress consists of moderately wide linen pantaloons reaching down below the knee, leather shoes, with woollen buckles and Persian, stockings; over the short blouse they wear a jacket without sleeves of a very coarse woollen material, fitting tightly round the chest. The girdle, the buckle of which is alway* ornamented with silver rosettes, contains the curved dagger which was formerly in use in Persia. For undress they wear a tightfitting felt cap, with a variegated or blue turban wound round it. When on horseback, the Mikii always carries a lance and shield ; the former of bamboo, the latter of rhinoceros skin, both of which are imported from India via Bagh dad. Their women are not veiled. Their figures are strongly built, and their features regular, though often coarse. The men are open in their intercourse with strangers, and, being Sunnis, have no prejudice about associating and eating with Christians. Their language is Kurdish, but they all understand Turkish and Persian. They number 2,000 families, probably 7,000 souls.— (Rawlinson — Curzon.) Until quite recently the Mikris were loyal subjects of Persia, but intrigues from Tehran and Turkish efforts have completed their disaffection, while at the present time, their capital Sauj Bulagh is in the hands of the Turks.

Water plentiful from kanats, but somewhat brackish. The town is built in an oblong form lying east and west. It is surrounded by a wall of sun-dried bricks and also by a ditch, both of which are in a more or less ruinous condition, specially on the western side, where the ground outside the walls completely commands the town. The average height of the walls is 25 feet and they are strengthened by semi-circular loopholed towers which project at intervals. The ditch is 12 to 15 feet in depth and 19 to 20 feet broad. The gateways are five in number. Those at the eastern end and centre of the south face are in good repair, and built in the usual Persian style.

Another device, which seems commend able on account of its simplicity, is to split the top of the pole with a hatchet and pass the wire through the cleft. The poles vary in height from 18 feet to about 6 feet. This is accounted for by firewood being very scarce on the road, and benighted travellers cutting off the lower portions of the poles for this purpose. There appears to be one clerk for this section, who is to be found sometimes at the Naln and at other times at the Kuhpa station. Notwithstanding these defects, messages travel through from Yazd to Isfahan without any serious delay.— {Vaughan, 1890.) NAlN (District).

NESTORIANS— The Nestorian Christians of the Turko-Persian highlands have been estimated at anything between 100,000 and 200 , 000 , the latter being the more correct, in all probability. By far the greater number are Turkish subjects, the Nestorian population of Azarbaijan being only some 44,000; see calculations at end of this article. They themselves, however, neither accept nor employ the name Nestorians, refusing to accept the general origin attributed to them, viz., the descendants of the sect founded by Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople, who was excommunicated and banished foi holding heretical opinions in A. D. 431. The sect took refuge in Persia and spreading their tenets throughout the east converted Piaster John and established 25 sees, stretching from the Mediterranean to the Pacific. They were far in advance of the Western Christians in number and influence, when Timur the Great Tartar fell upon them, and their scattered and decimated fragments fled to the mountain fastnesses north of Mesopotamia, which they have since held, descending by degrees to the plains of Mosul on the one side and those stretching towards the Urumieh basin on the other. They claim to be the spiritual progeny of St. Thomas and St. Jude, and while they common ly call themselves Syrians, are styled by the Moslems, Nasrani or Nazarenes* The genealogy of these people is impossible of exact solution ; they speak a dialect of ancient Syriac intermingled with a good many Arabic, Kurdish, Turkish, and Persian words. There are at present three branches of Syrian Christians; ( 1 ): the old Nestorians, under Mar Shimun ; ( 2 ): the old Chaldeans under the Patriarch of Babylon; (3): the new Chaldeans under Mar Elia Melus of Mosul. The first-named are the most numerous and are supposed to number 100,000 ; 60,000 in Turkey and 40,000 in Persia. In an article of this nature it will be sufficient to confine oneself to the Old Nestorians, under Mar Shimun. The Mar Shimun who nominally unites in his own person both the spiritual and temporal functions of government over his flock, has long resided in the mountainous village of Kochannis near Julamerk in Turkish territory, he appoints the lay ruler of each district and the spiritual heads of the various villages : in time past his authority was absolute, but in recent times since these districts have begun to be seriously governed by the Porte, the authority of the Mar Shimun has sensibly diminished. During the Kurdish outbreak of Badar Khan Beg in 1843, the occupant of the Patriarchate fled into Persian territory, to Urumieh. Since his return to Kochannis he has become a - pensioner of the Turkish Government, receiving £12 a month. The Maliks no longer obey the Mar Shimun and hie authority in spiritual matters is460 NIA—NIG weakened owing to his being in the pay of the Moslem, in correspondence and co-operation with the Anglican Church, and more or less mixed up with the American Presbyterians ; whilst, as is rumoured, his political sympathies are with the Russians. The reigning Patriarch, who is always called Mar Shimun, is always chosen from the same family, a number of the male members of which, who have never eaten meat from their birth nor married, are kept as a school of candidates from whom one is chosen, when the others are allowed to become as ordinary mortals. The main features of their creed are an uncommon and elastic cata logue of sacraments (seven in all, baptism, eucharist, ordination, marriage, burial, confirmation and confession, not auricular) and an hereditary and a celibate episcopate, accompanied by very strict observance of the Sabbath ' and Christian feasts. Their churches are mostly very plain and unpreten tious buildings, in order not to excite Muhammadan hostility. There have been four distinct missions organised to the Nestorians, 1 American Pres byterian ; 2 French Catholic, 3 Swiss Protestant; 4 Anglican ; of these the Swiss Protestant did not long survive, but the other three still remain. What the spiritual result of these missions may be, it is perhaps too early to say, but one thing is certain that immense benefit has resulted to the Christian subjects of both Persia and Turkey thanks to the labours of these missions. The French and Anglican missions are on the best of good terms, but there is considerable friction between the Anglican and American missions. There are computed to be 5,500 families of Nestorians in Azarbaijan, which, at four or five to a family, would give the usually accepted number of 20,000 to 25,000; the missionaries, however, say that eight to a family is a fairer computation, which gives a total of 44,000 souls. The Nestorians of the plains are robust, broad-shouldered men, with open countenances, fair complexion and frequently with red beards, those from the mountains are wild and uncouth and often undistingishable from the Kurds with whom, however, they are at deadly enmity. Each attack and rob the other, but the Kurds being stronger and better armed are usually the aggressors. The Nestorians being a subject Christian population in a Muhammadan country have to take their share of all the petty persecu tions, class and social drawbacks, etc., which always fall to the lot of Chris tians in such cases, but on the whole, thanks to foreign influence, their lot is no harder than the rest of the Shah’s subjects.

The name of a chashmeh at the foot of the Nukluk group of hills, which are a low detached range north of the Kuh Mahalla near Anarak. Water good, from a well cut in the solid rock in the hillside. It is about 4 feet square, and contains 4 feet 1 inch of water, 3 feet 6 inches below the surface of the ground. • There are some curious remains to the east of this hill. Near the chashmeh are the ruins of a square fort and the remains of some three or four hundred houses all built of stone. Large heaps of debris from which most of the copper has been extracted, are lying about, and ruined dams, built across the ravines of the hills, show how the inhabitants obtained their water. About 1 mile further on are the remains of a fort about 80 yards square and very massive, with round corner towers with a peculiar bulge in them. The walls are 5' to 3' thick, and the remains of a thin parapet above still exist. The building or dome near the entrance to the fort is curious, and there is a similar one half way up a hill close by. It is most probably a tomb or a temple. The only ornamentation remaining is that of the niches. All the arches are circular.

It is a masonry bridge of 5 arches, 100 feet long, 8 feet wide, paving, rough, of stones ; span of centre arch, 12 feet to 15 feet. The bed of the river is much obstructed by huge boulders ; current rapid ; the ascent from the bridge on the left side is rocky and difficult for 100 yards ; the river valley is here 300 yards wide.— {Bell, 1884.) PUL-I-KARASU or PUL-I-SHAH— This bridge consists of 6 arches and is very strongly built and kept in good condition. The whole structure is of burnt bricks. It was built by a certain Shaikh ’All Khan, once Prime Minister under one of the Saffavi j monarchs and an ancestor of the present Zahir-ul-Mulk. The bridge is on S the highway between Kirmanshah and Bisitun at 1 farsakh from the former and five from the latter.

The superstructure is all that is required to afford a’passage much needed at this spot in winter. What remains of the old work leaves one the impression of very good masonry and is undoubtedly Sassanian.

There is a fine spring of water here, and many villages and much cultivation around. There are two caves here, on opposite faces of a rock above the pond or spring. These are said to contain the tombs of the prophet Elias and his brother. The one I visited contained ’an empty tomb, built of burnt and sun-dried bricks. It is covered with bits of rags, and with wooden birds on small sticks, placed there by pilgrims in testimony to vows made at the shrine. The cave is much frequented by the Kurds of the neigh bourhood, who are fond of making a sort of picnic there. They bring with them a sheep or goat, which they sacrifice and eat on the spot in honour of the saint, and then pray for luck.— {T. G.

A mountain valley, about 16 by 10 miles enclosed on the west by the great range dividing Persia and Turkey, on the east and north by the plateau and hills of Babajik district. The valley is peopled by Turks and Haidaranlu Kurds. The latter are settled in winter about the villages near Kara Aineh, and in summer they migrate to the western mountains where they share the grazing with the Jalalls of Maku. The differences between these two tribes keep the valley in a constant ferment and pre vent the development of its fine lands by the Turk peasant. Supplies are consequently generally scarce. The safetv of the road is entrusted to Agha Khan of Zavleh and Mahmud Taghar Khan of Kara Aineh who are supposed to maintain sixty horsemen for the purpose. As a rule large caravans seldom suffer, but small parties are liable to attack and robbery by the Kurds. The road is in fair weather passable for carts, and all that is desirable for ordinary caravans.— {Picot, 1894.) qamishAbad— A village on the Ibhar river, 2 miles south-west of Qirveh, on the road to Tabriz.— {Schindler.)

This range, running east and west, crosses the Tabriz road between Zinjan and Mianeh and is traversed by a difficult pass, at an elevation of 4,800 feet, 62 miles from Zinjan. From the southern side it is entered by a well built bridge, whence it winds for about 4 miles to the valley of Mianeh. The road is steep, but easily passable for mules in fine weather ; - in its worst parts a “ stone farsh ” (stone carpet) has been built, about a mile long, but it is little used, except in wet and stormy weather. The mountains on either side are abrupt, and from this pass appear to present a rugged barrier. In good hands they would offer a strong line of defence against an enemy coming from the north.—(Pico£, lS9i.) QAPLAN KUH (2)- A range of hills crossed by the Tehran-Hamadan road, 128 miles from Tehran. Elevation of pass 5,450 feet.— {Schindler.) QAPLAN KUH (3)— This range is a spur of the Azarbaijan mountains. The ascent from the west commences almost immediately after crossing the Karangu river and takes about 1| hours, and the descent about the same. Fraser says it is one of the easiest mountain passes he ever crossed. It rises about 1,000 feet above the plain. When Eastwick passed it in 1861, a good road was being made over it, about 40 feet broad, with a foundation of stone and a gutter on either side. The crest of this pass is the boundary between the provinces of Azarbaijan and Khamseh. The remains of a stone causeway are here and there visible. Morier makes the following remarks regarding the geology of this mountain :— “ Its stratifications have been thrown together by some great com motion into the most extravagant positions. In some places they are perpendicular ; in other almost horizontal. On the south of the Kizil Uzun is one limb of the mountain, almost entirely composed of chalk, here and there with schistose strata intervening ; and on the right of the road in the descent from Gultappeh are hills apparently of clay, of conical forms, more or less distended, the strata of which are as horizontal as if mathematically laid.” — {Holmes; Fraser; Eastwick; Morier; Ouseley; Stuart.)

A small town with a population of about 1,000 deriving a livelihood entirely from the pilgrim traffic. It is divided into two quarters, the Luristanl and Turk, who were the two peoples responsible for the origin of the present population. The Luristani quarter shelters such few Persians as reside in Qasr-i-Shlrin. These are not more than about twenty people. The bazaar is small, and consists of foodsoller^ and a draper or two. Former ly there were more sh/ ps. but the misrule of Shir Khan Sinjabi (Samsam-ul- Mamalik) followed by the atrocious tyranny of Karim Khan Bajlani, and the Kalhur exactions, has emptied the place of all craftsmen, and latterly even of butchers and grocers. There is a large Customs House with a European (Belgian) in charge, and a small disused barrack originally built by Muhammad ’AH Mirza at the beginning of the nineteeth century. The Governor resides in a strong castle on a hill south of the town, which was built by the robber chief, Juanmlr of the Hamavand about 30 years ago. Across the river {i.e., on the S. bank) are two gardens, one belonging to Government, built for Nasr-ud-Dln Shah at the time of his pilgrimage to Karbala, one planted by Juanmlr, and the last, north of the town at a distance of about a mile and on the north bank, is a garden constructed by the late QazT, or Sunni chief priest, who was strangled in it by order of Shir Khan Sinjabi. The town is full of caravansarais and houses built to accommodate animals and travellers. Of late years it has been much improved, as the Anglo-Persian company have built houses for their staff in the town. For486 .

The present population of the place is composed of families of Luristanl origin, i.e., former subjects of the Vail of Puslit-i-Kilh, some Jaff and no mads, settled, a few Bajlan and a large number of Turks of the Derghe- zinli section of the Khalaj Turks of the Hamadan district. For an account of the ruins around Qasr-i-Shlrin see Rabino’s “Gazet teer of Kirmanshah, 1907 — {Soane, 1912.) QASR-I-SHlRlN (District).— The following account by M. Soane, who is Manager of the Persian Oil Company and also Vice-Consul at Qasr-i-Sh'rln includes the districts of Bajlan (N. of Qasr-i-Shirin) Gilan, and Khaniqin (Turkey) (S. E. and S. W. of Qasr-i-Shirin respectively). The border between Turkey and Persia is now (1912) under dispute. Though some of the remarks apply solely to Turkey they are included, as the district is the subject of much interest. History .—The district under review, being all a part of the province of Hulvan, comes within the history of that province, which has been the centre of a large population and a high degree of security at various times. The province takes its n tme from the River Hulvan, about the derivation of which n .me considerable speculation has occurred without granting any degree of success. The Persians, who delight in “ correcting” all names they do not understand, call it “ Alvand ” thinking that because they have a mountain of that name near Hamadan, this is the same name, corrupted by the Kurds, but it would appear that the latter have preserved the name correctly. It is pronounced by them Halawan, 7.e.,The river coming from the high places.” The Hulavan, among the other streams of the district, is distinguished by this very peculiarity. The spelling should be and not which is the misleading Arabicised form. The province was one of importance during the time of the Sassanian dynasty, and up to its overthrow by Islam was of considerable value as a tax-producing district. For years after the Muhammadan invasion it was deserted and spoiled, but was a governorship under Kufa. No one seems to have been able to keep its people in subjection, however, except Kurds themselves, and in the 9th, 10th, and 11th centuries it was under the rule of the family of ’Abul Fath Muhammad bin Ayyar. After the confusion caused by the various Mongol invasions had given place to the comparative order and rule of Turkey and Persia, the province again fell into the hands of Kurdish governors, sometimes under one and sometimes the other Power. In the middle of the 16th century the Kurds of Dartang (northern portion of Hulvan) were in possession, their most noted ruler being Suhrab Beg, under Persian rule. In 1638 the first Bajlan Pasha, Khan Abdal Beg, was installed at Zuhab, then a considerable town, now a ruin—Nadir Shah gained possession of Zuhab for a time and then the family of Khan Abdal Beg ruled the pro vince till 1826, at which date it was expelled by the Persians under Muhammad AH Mirza, who have retained it ever since and ruined it.QASR-I-SHlRlN 487 Geography ; boundaries .—The district is divided into two portions ; that in the Turkish territory, and that in Persian territory. These portions will, as far as possible, be treated separately. Commencing from the north with the Persian Section, the boundaries taken are, east, the main line of moun tains formed by Bamu, Bishikan, Biznan, Gazaviz, and the line of hills bounding the plain of Sar-i-Pul (or Sarpul) to the east, known as Kuchuk Bari — Kal-i-Daud, Kal-i-Shahin, and Enzal. South, the plain of Gulin, the Sarkash mountain, Sarab-i-Mirt, and Anarak plaiij and mountain. West the assumed and locally accepted frontier from south of the Baghcheh mountain to Hurin and Shaikan, where it meets the eas f ern boundary. Turkish Section .—The boundaries treated here are, east, the frontier as above detailed, west, the Diala river, north, the Diala river, and south, the Baghcheh and Qatar hills. All these boundaries are physical features of the country. The tract is practically identical (except for Zuhab and Bishiva, not here included) with the old Pashaliq of Zuhab, and the older province of Huluvan (Holwan). This report fills in the gap left between my former report on Sulaimanieh district and the Report on Pusht-i-Kuh by Captain D. L. R. Lorimer I A. 1908. Physical geography. —(1) Persian Side .—- The main geographical feature of the country is the regularity of the ranges N. W.—S. E., each range westward being of less altitiude than its eastern neighbour. The last regular and high ranges westward are, taking from the N. W., Bamu and Dalahu. Farther west, commencing from the Hulvan river, is the composite range of Sumbulak and Bazi Daraz. Farther west again and rising three miles N. of Tangab village is a range, the most northerly portion of which is called Gamakawu continuing S. E. under the names Dar-i-Baru, Kuh-i-Shah, and Shak Maidanto Anarak and so on to Luristan. Both Bazi Daraz and Gamakawu ranges increase in height as they go southwards and eventually join the intricate system which forms the northern frontiers of Luristan. The district, generally speaking, forms a bay in the Zagros mountain system,—by which the Hulvan and Quretu rivers are permitted to escape —in which the mountain system is broken up and sinks into insignificance. At the eastern extremity, or head, of this bay, is the Zuhab plain. Farther south the mountain system again advances to the line set by Kara Dagh and Kirkuk ranges in Turkish territory, and takes with it the frontier line westwards. All mountains, as they approach to the Hulvan river, decrease in height, except the Ak Dagh, which is highest at its southern extremity. The plains west of Sumbulak, Bamu, and Daridivan are cut up by ridges of grey sand-stone cropping up from a heavy red soil, overlaid in places with gravel. This soil is itself intersected in all directions by ravines, so that the so-called plains of Ganumban and Bajlan are in reality a mass of gullies and small hills. The Sumbulak mountain is almost entirely gypsum, as is also Gamakawu. (2) Turkish Side .—The country on the frontier, after the mass of the Karadagh in the extreme north, is a depression, a plain as seen from afar, but cut up by small hills and ravines north of Khaniqln, where a gravelly soil replaces the red soil and grey sandstones of the most northerly parts, and the country becomes undulating.488 QASR-I-SHlRlN The districts, which are flat, are represented in the map by the names Ban Kudra, Baba Pilavl, and ’Aliava (’Aliabad). The first and second are sepa rated by the Jabal Murwarld hill, and by the spurs coming from the little Agh Dagh (Kuchuk Agh Dagh) Baba Pilawl and Aliava are separated by the Hulvan and the districts Quia and Baba Mahmud. The Baghcheh and Qatar mountain in the south of the district is a stony waterless waste of hills, and the tract Kuzaraqi south of Khaniqin is desert also, with layers of sandstone and hillocks. Wheat is cultivated in the northern portion of Baghchoh. Water. —(1) Persian Side .—The water supply is good except in the tract between Daridivan and the Sirvan river. This latter forms the frontier between the northern limit of the district and the northern spurs of Agh Dagh, and in the extreme north of the district the ’Abbasan stream flows into it, which rises in the mountains Laqlaq and Bamu and at Sar Qalao on the western side of the latter mountain. This stream passes through the Bamu mountain by a defile known as Darband-i-Ur and flows N. W. south of Bamu, and rising in the mountain Dalahu, is the Quretu river (known as Dalashir in Zuhab) which flows by Zuhab and across the Bajlan plain. Reaching the foot of the Agh Dagh it is forced to turn northwards, as the slope resulting from the foot of the N. W. spur of Sumbulak, and the height of Agh Dagh slopes are greater S. E. than N. W. From quite close to the village of Quretu, it turns, deflected by the flank of the Ak Dagh, and flows into the Shlrwan near Gurashala, where the frontier separates from the Shirwan river. The Quretu stream receives in its N. W. portion the Saikawand brook (also known as Dalashir) and in spring the Qizil torrent. These constitute the regular water supply of the northern part of the district, except for a few very small perennial springs at KanI Pamu, Chla Surkh, Kanl Shirina, Saiyid Mustafa, and Sangar. In the centre of the district is the Hulwdn River, the sources of which are— (а) RIzhab in the Ban Zarda mountain. ( б ) Sar-i-Mil near Karind. (c) Sarab-i-Garm in Danavishk. (d) Ab-i-Dira rising in Gulin. (e) Ab-i-Kal-i Shahin rising in Kal-i Shahin. These all unite in the Sar-i-Pul valley, and flow N. W. round the end of Sumbulak, where, headed off by the rising ground towards the Ak Dagh, the stream is forced southwards in order to gqt round that mountain. At the termination of this obstacle it turns immediately west, then south, and ultimately N. W. to join the Shirvan, which it does near Dakka, outside the district under report, near a range called Anara, an extended spur of Bagh cheh N. W. On the southerly portion of its course it receives— 1. Nehpahn or Naipan, composed of— (a) Garrav, rising in Sumbulak. (b) Kurrkirik, rising in Sumbulak. (c) Imam Hasan, rising in BazI Daraz. (d) Hudara, rising in Gamakawu.QASR-I-SHIRIN 489 2. Tangab, composed of— (а) Maiqurikhan, rising in BazI Daraz. ( б ) Kuruk, rising in BazI Daraz. (c) Sarab-i-Mirt, rising in Gilan. (d) Chilla rising in Qalaja Mt. 3, Palkana, a brook rising in Baghcheh Mountain. With the exception of the last-named, these are all drainages of the long mountain system, which is called Sumbulak, BazI Daraz, Sarkash and Qalaja from N.-W. to S.-E. ( 2 ) Turkish Side. —The water supply is entirely derived from the Sirwan and Hulwan rivers, and the irrigation canals carried off from them. There are four such at Khaniqln watering the gardens of HajI Qara and Baba Mahmud on one side, and ArkawazI and Allawa on the other side of the Hulvan. A small stream exists in Sauj-Bulagh, which waters Baba Pilavi. In late summer very little water of the Hulvan reaches the Shirvan, as it is also tapped in Bishiva and Sar-i-Pul (Persian territory.) Population. —To a large extent the population is a floating one, as in the winter the land is covered with tribespeople, who retire in March and April, so that by the end of the latter month the country is deserted except for the people of the sedentary tribes, and the villages. 1. Sharafbaini. (See separate article.) The Guran tribe does not come within the scope of this report, but south of Bamu, in Zuhab, and in the Bajlan plain the following tribes pitch their tents from January till the middle of March: (a) Taishai at Chla Surkh ( 6 ) Qadir Mir Vaisi, north of Chla Surkh and at KanI Pamu, (c) NairzhI, in the district of Bajlaa known as Qizil (and watered by the stream of that name and also at Ban Zamin near Haush Kurl, {d) QalkhanI between the hill of Blshikan and Qizil and also in Jigarlu, which lies between Qizil and the Qaravaz hill. These tribes pass up through Znhab to their summer quarters in the Dalahu mountain. 3. The Bajlan tribe. (See separate article.) 4. The Baityarawand. The remnants of a tribe now very poor. The few of them now remaining are under the protection of various other tribes. 5. Sinjabi. (See separate article). 6 . Ahmadavand Buhtui. —This tribe has its main headquarters in the neighbourhood of Kirmanshah and only winters between Baghcheh and Dar- i-Baru, where the Chief Muhammad Khan, Path us Saltana, son of Shah Murad Khan, possesses some property. He has no affairs in the frontier. The tribe is small, and has abandoned the raiding for which it was notorious in recent years. It is supposed to be remotely connected with the Hamavand of Bazia and Chemchemal (near Sulaimanleh). At Tangab, the only Ahmadavand Buhtui village,'there are 31 people under a headman, ’Aziz, appointed by Path us Saltana, and he has built a mill there. The tribe is Sunni. 7. Kalhur .—(See separate article). Language. —Immigrant tongues have displaced the native language of the district, except among the Bajlan tribe, who still speak a dialect developed from the Pehlevi spoken there in Sasanian times. Otherwise Southern Kur- manji (Kurdish) is spoken north of the Hulwan and Kirmanshahl, a Lur-Kurd dialect, to the south. Persian is understood on the main road, and Turkish C300GSB490 QASR-I-SHlRlN almost equally well. Arabic is spoken largely in Khaniqin Generally speaking, the language is Kurdi, against which Persian and Turkish make Languages .—languages of the different tribes vary very considerably, and are as follows :— Sharafbaini ..

The products of Zuhab and_ Sar-i-Pul do not come under the scope of this report. In summer Ganumban, Gilan, and Baahcheh are deserted, absolutely the only inhabited spots m them being Imam Hasan, Sar Tatan, and Sarab-i-Mirt (or Sarab-i-G.lan). There is an abundance of gypsum everywhere, and crude oil springs at Chia Surkh in Bajlan, Imam Hasan in Bazi Daraz, and Tangab in Shah Kuh. Bitumen also exists in the Sumbalak range and at Sar Qalao. There is also reported to be oil in Aniirak. For a description of the oil springs set under Kirmanshah (Province) Resources. . , Roughly speaking the geological feutures m Gilan are, limestone (m the hills) gravel (in the plain) giving place to gravel over sandstone over clay m Gunamban. Bajlan is gravel over standstone over clays, red and green, the gravel denuded in many places. Agh Dagh is gravel and conglomerate, and Compared to Kurdistan generally, the district is very barren. In s P ri ^g- time, when all the hillsides and plains are covered with long grass, sprinkled with flowers of many kinds, the country appears fertile enough, and at that time wild asparagus, mushrooms, truffles, and various edible roots are obtainable, but after April this is all dried up, and the country side becomes particularly barren and forbidding, despite its plentiful water, and lizards, scorpions, and snakes innumerable take the place of the vegetation. _ Mili'ary • Persians.—According to an old arrangement, the Sharafbaini are to supply a small force, about 70-80 horsemen, but in the present state of affairs this arrangement has fallen into desuetude. The Bajlan when under the late’Aziz, supplied 150 horsemen, but the present head, Majid Khan, cannot raise more than 100 men and those badly mounted and armed ’Ali Akbar Khan to whom the guarding of Kaleh Sabzi is entrusted, is to supply 50 men in all and does so. These are liable to be called upon for internal warfare. The Ahmadavand Buhtui supply no men for the frontier, but are under obligations to assist in Harunabad and some Kirmanshah districts when necessary. This they do. The Guran areQASR-I-SHlRfN 491 supply a regiment for internal affairs, and each Sultan, or head of a section, has to furnish a certain number towards it. The regiment has not been raised for some years. The Kalhur formerly were responsible for a regiment, but Baud Khan Sardar-i-Muzaffar undertook to supply 1,000 horsemen when necessary on condition that no regiment be raised. This was agreed to. Turks '.— At the present moment there are no troops in Khaniqln, though a force of some two hundred is supposed to be quartered there. Quite recently the Turkish authorities have been endeavouring to press into- military service the Persian subjects resident in the district. There is at Khaniqin a Police Commissary and one policeman. This officer also undertakes the post of Mudir-i-’Umum, or judge of petty causes, for wffiich purposes he possesses a clerk and a messenger. Apart from the regular military, there is a small force of “zaptieh”, armed mounted messengers and police, under one officer. These are all natives of the district, and the service is voluntary. Up to recent times an arrangement existed with certain tribes to guard the frontier when necessary, particularly, with the Jaff MuradL As arms are now, however, forbidden to all but the military, the tribes would probably, in time of necessity, make the excuse that they possess no rifles. Frontier arrangements .—From the Sir van river junction with the Quretu, both northwards and southwards, the Turks have erected a line of towers called' ‘Qulla (Qal’a?) which commences south of Banakhilan on the SIrvan, and continues to Khani Bey on the Hulvan. From that point southwards they attempted to extend the line east of the Baghcheh mountain to Mandali but the Sinjabi have destroyed the towers four times, and the Turks have desisted. At each of these Qulla are a few guards, who have no duties except to stop the passage of suspicious persons into Turkish territory and to patrol the frontier line. On the Persian side there is a customs post at Haush Kurl (N. Akdagh), one at Kaleh Sabzi, and one at Tangab, also posts at Sarab-i-Mirt and Aiwan in Luristan. These are all under the direction of Qasr-i-Shirin. The last two are not frontier posts. Among the first three, and Qasr-i-Shirin, some thirty horsemen are divided,, there being six at Haush Kurl, five at Kaleh Sabzi, six at Tangab, and seven at Gilan (Sarab-i-Mirt). They are armed with Martini rifles sup plied by the Government, but have to provide their own ammunition. Their duties are excise only. Tangab apparently meaningless in situation, is the entrepot for smuggled goods to Gilan, and goods going by the tribal roads to Sar-i-Pul and Harunabad. Its use is principally in winter and spring, when the nomads are in the neighbourhood. It was originally placed to prevent the extensive smuggling to Karind. The guarding arrangements on the Persian side are :— Sharafbaini to supply 70 horsemen. Bajlan to supply 150 horsemen. Sinjabi to supply 50 horsemen around and at Kaleh Sabzi. Sinjabi to guard Tangab (no station). Haush Kuri has no guard, being included under Bajlan.492 QASR-I-SHaRlN The Frontier Line. —From the northern portion of the district to the Hul- wan, the frontier is marked either by the Sirwan river or by the “ Qulla,” which the Turks, particularly since the inception of the Constitutional system pretend is a temporary line, putting forward the claim to Zuhab province with a frontier at the Zagros mountains, to include Sharafba'ni, Bajlan, Sar i-Pul and its plain Kaleh Shahin and Bishiva, up to the ring of hills south of Paitaq. This I believe, they can no longer claim, Badrai and Jessan having ap parently been given them in exchange for Zuhab at the Erzerum Conference. From the Hulwan river southwards no frontier is delineated, and it is in dispute, each country claiming Baghcheh and Qatar, which Persia, thanks to the Sinjabi tribe, now holds. As a result of this it will be noticed that the frontier at present takes an abrupt turn from Kani Biz S.W. The line desired by the Turks would have continued almost due south from that point. This stretch is almost entirely deserted during summer and autumn and its only inhabitants at other times are the Sinjabi nomads. There being no water, the Turks are hindered in their attempts to appropriate the dis trict. The villages on the frontier are:— Persian Side:—from the north — Lands of Shaikhs Nas : r-ud-Din and Hamid, Gurushala, Haush Kuri, ’All Sakhar, ’All Shirina, Kaleh Sabzi, Kachalkachala, Dara Khan, Jamshid,' and langab. Turkish side:—from the north — Kani Chaqal, Shirwana, Balut, Ben Kudra villages, Qalama, Nairopi; S’aid Pasa, Sayidal, Qalkhanli, Majid Beg, Khallfah ’Aziz, and Kani Biz. Administration—{!) Persian side. —All the tribes, viz., Sharafbaini Bajlan, Sinjabi, Baityar&amp;wand, Ahmadavand Behtui, and Kalhur are nominally under the Government of Kirmanshah, but Daud Khan Kalhur has for some time now taken affairs into his own hands, and is their virtual ruler besides which he holds the title of Rais-ul’Ashair, or Chief of the Tribes' which carries with it considerable power over them.—(Baud Khan waq killed in May 1912.) (2) Turkish Side.—Tho western portion down to the Shirvan river is under the Qaim Maqam of Kifri, and eist of that under the Qaim Maqam of Khaniqin, both responsible to the Yali of Baghdad. Their authoritv is not great outside of the towns they inhabit, particularly at present (1911). Revenue.—1. Persian Side.—The. revenues have not been collected by Government for three years, and at present there is no sign of any attempt being made in that direction. The Government normally derives income from three sources: 1. Malict — Revenues. 2. Vujuhrt — Rents on Crown properties. 3. P shkash.— Presents made by the Governor to the Government. Originally these taxes were one, under the general heading Mdlidt (except the rents at Qasr-i-Shirin, which, as the lands belong to the Crown were directly payable) and the district was divided into four sections Sharafbaini Bajlan Sinjabi and Sar-i-Pul, which paid krdns 180,000, a sum which included Mdliat, Vujuhdt, and pishkash.QASR-I-SHlRlN 493 Under Iqbal-ud-Dauleh this system was changed, and various items separated, so that ’Aziz Beg Sharafbaini paid his tribal dues direct to Kirman- shah, ’Aziz Khan Bajlan likewise, while N’amatullah Khan Karindi took Sar- i-Pul at kram 180,000 and Shir Khan Samsam-uJ-Mamalik, took Qasr-i-Shirin and the Sinjabi tribe at krdns 120 , 000 . Quretu (Bajlan) was krtins 10 000 and S.iarafbaini about the same. Of these sums about krdns 60,000 was “written back” (yas navishteh) under the following headings. ( 1 ) Savdr va piddeh, cavalry and infantry (tribal levies). ( 2 ) Kharjti-Sufra, table expenses,” including expenses of establishment entertaining, and public works undertaken, officials’ wages, etc. The taxes were raised on cultivation and agriculture generally. Up to the end of the reign of Muzafiar ud Din Shah, the Government were supposed to touch, per annum :— Sar-i-Pul ,. Qasr and Sinjabi Bajlan tribe Sharafbaini tribe Kalhiir tribe Krans. .. 180,000 .. 120,000 10,000 10,000 .. 150,000 ‘Written back’ Total 470.000 100.000 370,000 or, at the rate of ex- * change then obtain ing about £6,500— », ,i . ,. , , £7,000 per annum. At the inception of the Majlis, or Constitution, the system was changed, and as the lands are mostly crown property, the vujuhdt, or rents, were separated from the mdlidt, and the plshkash —ostensibly—abolished. The amount of the vujuhnt was established temporarily and experimentally as below, the idea being to increase them each year till it was no longer possible for the people to pay more. The system of collection was to auction them to any bidder or bidders situate at the place concerned, and collection from the buyers and people was made monthly. The vujuhat were:— Qasr town .. Sar-i-Pul •• •• • 9 # m Pa-i-pul Miankal •• •• •• Total The Maliat then remained :— Qasr-i-Shirin Sar-i-Pul Bajlan Sharafbaini Kalhui .. Krans. 70.000 10.000 5,000 (by Sar-i-Pul] 10,000 (by Sar-i-Pul] 95,000=£1,800 pel annum. Krans. 50.000 155.000 15.000 (increased). 10.000 200.000 (increased).494 QASR-I-SHlRlN Apart from these a special tax is raised on camels on the following scale :— Every three camels on each journey have to pay one krdn f which is col lected in three equal instalments, one at Kaleh Sabzl, one at Qasr-i-Shirin, and one at Sar-i-Pul. This revenue was bought by the persons paying the taxes of the Sinjabi, of Qasr-i-Shlrin, and Sar-i-Pul respectively. At Qasr-i-Shirin are collected also two special taxes by the Telegraph Master.— (а) Kr ~ns 2 on each camel caravan, the reason given being that the camels destroy the line, the tax being towards the expenses of repairs, The considerable surplus of tax over repairs is one of the perquisites of the Telegraph Master. ( б ) Kr'ns 5, on a load of wood from each household in Qasr-i-Shirin, for his own use. The Governor also levied a tax on houses called ' darmal” which varied according to his capacity and the docility of the people. Turkish side. —The taxes collected in the Turkish territory are various. Among town and village people the following are those at present imposed. A ’ ina. —A poll-tax imposed upon everybody, the amount of which varies according to the means of the person taxed. It ranges from £ to 5 mejidi=ls, Hd. to 16s. 8d. 'Amala Mukhtalifa .—Also apparently a poll-tax fixed in Khaniqin at 12 piastres (2s.) a head. This is now being collected for four years from every body. The Persian subjercts resident in the town and environs of Khaniqin art also being subjected to this tax, the Turks refusing to recognise the validity of their Persian passport. Balad yya .—A small tax on every body for the expenses of lighting the streets. As these are ill lit and the cost very little, the bulk of the proceeds of the tax is consumed by the employees of the Baladiyya, or municipality^ Tamattu ’.—A variable tax, recently inaugurated, and ranging at an aver age of about 2 mejidi per head. Persian subjects also have to pay it. Outside taxes .—The chief of these are— Date trees ., • * .. 4 piastres per annum Fruit trees • • . r 2 to 4 ditto. Gardens, according to produce department— as estimated by officials of the Mai Mudiri Sheep », .. 4 piastres per annum- Houses ,, .. nil. Camels ., .. $ mejidi per annum. V ^ Donkeys Mules .. .. Tax on these recently abolished. Horses • * Harvest £ of the harvest, but the assess- ment made while the crop is green is very unfair and always errs very largely in favour of the Government.- The Persians are subjected to all these taxes except those relating to military service and army expenses such as the £tq. 50 exemption tax. But during May 1911 the Turks were forcing them to take out papers of Turkish subjectivity, and were pressing them into the Army.Out of some 200 Persian households in and around Khaniqin some 50 households are now Turkish subjects by compulsion their Consul being power less to protect them. An enormous revenue is collected by the Turks under the head of Quarantine dues, passports, and dead bodies (imported for burial at Karbala) and levied upon pilgrims. All pilgrims arriving from Persia pay krdns 6, quarantine fee, and if their passports have not been vised Tcrans 20 is taken from them. In this last service there is a very large amount of peculation and bribery. All pilgrims arriving from Persia have, if they possess their own beasts, to pay krdns 30 per donkey, and krdns 42 per mule, which is supposed to be paid back when they return from the pi Igrimage. Such re-imbursement, how ever, is rare. Communications .—The tracks used by caravans are :— 1. The main road Kirmanshah to Baghdad passing through Sar-i-Pul, Qasr-i-Shirin and Khaniqin. 2. Khaniqin to Dakka for Kirkuk. 3. Khaniqin to Haush Kuri for Sulaimanieh. 4. Khaniqin to Mandali. Other routes, not much used are :— 5. Khaniqin to Sar-i-Pul via Imam Hasan. 6. Qizil Rubat to Paitaq. 7. Qasr-i-Shirin to Dakka. 8. Qasr-i-Shirin to Haush Kuri. 9. Qasr-i-Shirin to Sar Qalao. 10. Qasr-i-Shirin to Sar-i-Pul via Sumbulak. 11. Qasr-i-Shirin to Gilan for Pusht-i-Kuh. 12. Qasr-i-Shirin to Tangab for Mandali. 13. Qasr-i-Shirin to Shaikh Nasr-ud-Din’s district. These are detailed in an appendix, except for the first mentioned. Innumerable tracks exist all over the country which lead nowhere, and follow most ardous routes. These are very misleading, and necessitate the employment of a guide on any but Nos. 1 and 2 routes. Carriages ply on No. 1 route. The Turks do not allow any Persian carriages to pass the frontier except the post waggons, but their own vehicles are free to make the journey to Kirmanshah or even to Tehran. The road is usually closed to this traffic from January to early March. All other transport is by mule and donkey caravan, with camels in summer in large numbers. — (Soane, 1911.) (Goane 1911).

QUM— (Province.) This province is bounded on the north by Tehran, on the east by the desert, on the south by Kashan, west by ’Iraq, Faragan, Hamadan andSaveli. The province now comprises seveii districts called buluk, and in 1896 had a population of some 45,000. It is governed by an official appointed by the Shah, who has the title of Hakim ; its taxes amount ed to about £9,000. The seven buluk are Humeh, Kumrud, Vazeh-Karud, Kinar-i-Rudkhanoh, Kohistan, (Kuhistan), Jasb, and Ardahal.—(Sc/wwd- ler.) QUM (town)—Lat. -34° 32 / ; Long. 50W 54'. Elev. 3,100'. The capital of the province of the same name, situated in the Humeh district, 87 miles from Tehran by the old road, via Hauz-i-Sultan and 93| by the new one via ’Aliabad ; it lies on the right bank of the Anarbar in the middle of an extensive plain. The population is estimated at 20,000, of whom fully \ are composed of priests, Saiyids and their families. The town was apparently founded by the Arabs in the eighth century. Qum is a strong-hold of ShTahs, there are supposed to be over 400 Imamzadehs or descendants of Imams buried here and it is a great place of pil grimage. The shrine of Fatimah, sister of Imam Riza, is the great object of pilgrimage, and is one of the most celebrated sanctuaries in Persia. It presents at a distance very much the same appearance as one of the gilded domes in the Kremlin at Moskow, and was originally erected by Shah Sultan Husain, the gilding of the dome being subsequently commenced by Path ’Ali Shah, and completed by the present king (Nasir-ud-Din). It is, as usual, a surface of gold on plates of copper, and a handsome clock was afterwards added to the dome by the liberality of the Governor of Hamadan. It is in the neighbourhood of this shrine that the Imamzadehs are buried and the whole of the neighbouring ground outside the v r alls presents the appearance of one vast burying ground. It is customary to make a pilgri mage to this shrine before proceeding to Meshed or Karbala. A theolo gical college was established here by Path’ Ali Shah, which is now held in great repute, and is attended by more than 100 students. It is enclosed by walls now in a very dilapidated state, with a ditch out side. Like most Persian towns it is in ruins. The bazaars of Qum are small and poor, but a brisk trade is generally carried on in them, especially when the town is full of pilgrims. In the neighbourhood of the great mosque and along the river there are hundreds of houses especially kept for the accommodation of visitors. The river in the town is crossed by a bridge of 9 arches, near which is the post-house. It is built of substantial masonry, length about 225', the river being 200' wide ; the centre arch is 45', the others 20'; width 18'. Banks of clay low and steep ; the bed is pebbly. It is unfordable in the end of April, but is said to dry up altogether two months later. .Resources.—The water-supply is abundant though brackish in summer. There is a glass factory in the town, the other products are pottery and shoes. The grain grown is abundant and of good quality, and particularly good cotton is cultivated, which is largely exported to Russia. Climate .—The climate of Qum in summer is hot, but somewhat less so than that of Kashan, and the winter is severe. In the autumn dust-sto r ms are common. Diphtheria has of late years been prevalent; in the autumn of 1884 a severe epidemic broke out; small-pox also is seldom absent.500 QUMA—QUMR Opthalmia and diarrhoea in t!ie summer and autumn are frequently met with. The crops are reaped as a rule twenty days earlier than in Tehran. Occasionally after heavy ram, or sudden melting of the snows there is a flood and the river does considerable damage to the town. Communications .—A cart-road was constructed between this place and Tehran on which the Persian Government established a carriage dak. This road for a distance of 2 miles passes through hills, and the Persian engineers to avoid cuttings have followed many level defiles and glens and thus the road goes round and round like a snake, and its length is neary doubled. Ihe Government has built 5 dak bungalows, and, except these, there are no other habitations on the road.—(ScWfer.) This road was taken over by the Persian Imperial Bank in 1890 and ceded to Messrs. Lynch Brothers of London in 1903. There is a post office here and telegraph offices both of the Persian Gov- eminent and of the Indo-European Company. The land north of the city for a mile towards Tehran on the left bank of the river is called Mumajan and the land west of Mumaian is called A brastaj an. (Stack Bell — Olding — Schindler .)

The former stretches from north to south, and is bounded by three ranges of mountains, limiting it on the north-east and south. The village of Qutur is situated close to the junction of the Qutur dial and another stream at the foot of a steep hill, which is surmounted by a ruined mud fort. The village faces west, while the fort commands the approaches from the east and west; there are about 100 houses, which, with the exception of four or five, are built, in the Kurdish fashion, underground. It is a poor place almost entirely Kurd, and is the seat of a Governor or Hakim. There is a company of Persian infantry in garrison armed with Werndl rifles, but otherwise unlike soldiers and comparing most unfavourably with the Turks, on the other side of the frontier ; there are also 20 gunners and two bronze muzzle-loading guns of about 5 inch calibre in the fort. The fort is on a rock, and there is no water in it; the ascent to it is difficult. The walls and two bastions, which form its defences, are constructed of mud ; no use against shells. As a place of defence against civilised troops it is useless. The population of the district does not exceed 8,000 inhabitants of which the greater part are Kurds.— {MacGregor — Tyrell.) The mountaineers near Qutur could formerly be relied on by the' Turks. QUTUR BUGHAZ (pass)— A famous pass in the north-west of Azarbaijan, which formerly formed the boundary between Persian and Turkish dominions. The Turks built a sort of block house at the entrance to the gorge, which presents a series of magnificent positions for defence. It is in many places not more than 200 yards broad. Precipitous heights look down from both sides on the stream, called the Qutur Chai, which flows through. There are several mineral springs in the neighbourhood, some being sulphurous. The road from Tabriz to Van goes through this valley. The path is winding and no special difficulties are mentioned. The Pass is a place of some strategical importance, and is specifically men tioned as being part of Persian territory in the old treaty with Turkey. This, however, has not prevented Turkey from trying to obtain possession of it. On October 26th, 1910, a Turkish officer summoned the Persian commandant to surrender, but received a refusal. Elsewhere the Turks have advanced beyond the crests of the hills since 1%^.—{Burnaby.)RAHA—HAHN 603 BAHAMA— A name for tlie Diala river (q.v.), RAHDAR KHANEH— A village in Azarbaijan, 5 miles from Tasuj, on the left of the road from that place to Khoi.

It was the capital of some of the Arab conquerors of Persia, and became under their rule one of the foremost cities of the world. In A. D. 1221 it was captured and sacked by Jenghiz Khan, and Timur completed the destruction in the next century. The town recovered sufficiently to become one of the seats of Government of Timur’s younger son Shah Rukh, and here his grandson Khalil Sultan lived and died. From the death of Shah Rukh the final decline of Rai may be traced. It has been much disputed whether or not Rai occupies the site of the Raghes of the Apocrypha of Arrain which afterwards be came the capital of the Arsacidae. Lord Curzon assumes that it does not. The fullest description of Rai is to be found in Ker Porter’s travels, Volume I. The ark or acropolis was situated on a projecting rocky ridge above the . plain and its outline can still be satisfactorily traced ; below this was a lower fortified enceinte ; and encircling the whole, upon the plain, was a vast space surrounded by fortified walls, with its entrance marked by three great square towers, the whole forming a triangle, with the ark as its apex. Amongst other conspicuous relics is a great circular tower known as the Nakkareh- Khaneh of Yazd : it is a great fabric built of brick, hollow and roofless 60 to 70 feet high and 120 in circumference, the outer surface being broken into a series of projecting angles. This tower has been completely repaired and it looks like a new building, the surrounding ground has been turned into a garden. At the foot of the mountain a little to the east are the remains of another ruined tower with a Cufic inscription; this has not been restored. There was also a half-obliterated bas-relief of a figure on horseback armed with a spear, without doubt representing one of the later Sassanian monarchs. The bas-relief was effaced and a sculpture representing Path ’Ali Shah was put up in its place, this was high up on a smoothed surface of rock above the citadel, lower down Path ’Ali Shah and some of his court have been in like manner represented. Close to Rai is the tomb of Shah ’Abdul ’Azim, a holy Mussalman, whose shrine is much frequented by the pious Tehranis. Not being far from the city of Tehran, the materials of the ancient town were large ly used in the construction of the present capital. At present all the visible remains of the ancient city, which was at one time the capital of the Kingdom and the birthplace of Harun-ur-Rashid, are some shattered frag ments and broken bricks, once forming part of its massive walls.

RASHT—Lat. 37° 17 ' 27'; Long. 49° 35' 45'. . . ,, , Description.— The capital of the province of Gilan, is situated on the left bank of the river Siah-Rudbar which flows into the Bay of Enzali; the town lies about 64 miles from the bay. -i f The town is situated on low swampy ground, only a few miles Iron the sea, and is a most unhealthy spot, in which no European would re side from choice. It was originally buried m jungle, like most other towns and villages of this province, but the Russians, during tneir occupation 170 vears ago, cleared the timber and jungle as far as the mountains though a good deal has sprung up since. The houses of Rasht are of the same nature as those of Astrabad, red-tiled and raised from the ground with broad verandahs and overhanging eaves, whilst hedgerows and gardens abound^ Population.— Its population is about 40,000, which with the revival of ' t he silk trade and the ingrease of the trade due to the construction by the_ Russians of the Rasht-Kazvin-Tehran road is likely to increase. The popula tion of 40 000 are practically all Muhammadans, with the except on of foreign ers and Armenians, the language spoken is a Persian patois, called Gilaki. History.—T ot history see under Gllan. , Resources —Since early days Rasht—as the capital of the great silk produc ing provinces of Persia—has enjoved a considerable commercial importance and has been the residence of Consuls and Vice-Consuls of different nation alities from an early period. In 1899 there was a drought in the province C300GSB506 RASHT and the Rasht bazaars were burnt the same year, but the depression follow ing these two calamities was very short and 1900 was a record year, proving the vitality of Rasht trade. Russia, thanks to her proximity and predominance has obtained a commanding position here which she carefully maintains by all her usual wiles, she has a large number of subjects residing in Rasht and Gilan, mainly Armenians and Caucasians, and by right of mortgage has obtained possession of several villages in the neighbourhood.

A large number of coasting steamers navigate the Caspian between Russian and Persian ports. For further particulars see articles on Enzali and Gilan.—- (Curzon, Churchill.) Trade of Gildn .—The principal imports entering Northern Persia vid Enzali are sugar, tea, naphtha oil, silkworm eggs, metal and metal ware, bul lion and cotton tissues. Salt .—The salt imported is mostly for use in the fisheries. The wants of the inhabitants are partly supplied from Russia and partly, but not to such an extent, from Khalkhal and Tarom. Sugar .—Sugar from Russia is, on arrival at Rasht, forwarded to various towns in the interior. In 1909, after the landing of Russian troops at Enzali, the Persians attempted a boycott of Russian goods and the price of suga? rose considerably. Such a move was, of course, doomed to failure, as North ern Persia is dependent upon Russia for its imports, and the boycott soon died a natural death. The price of sugar then fell from 4s. §\d. (12 krdns at 54) for large loaves and 4s. (12 - 50 krdns) for small onesper 13fbs, (1 man shah to which it had risen after the boycott of Russian goods, to 3s. Od. and 3s. Ifd,,508 RASHT (8-20 to 8-50 lerans) prices at Baku having fallen from 5r. and 5r. 25c. and 3r. 60c. and 3r. 80c. Large consignments were therefore ordered by Rasht importers, but merchants on March 20, 1911, were holding out for still lower prices, and this, coupled with the fact that the road to Kazvin was blocked by snow during the greater part of the winter, caused congestion in the sugar trade of Rasht. Sugar in loaves is imported in bags, but a small quantity is packed in barrels. Bags of small loaves weigh 3^ puds (36 lb.) and boxes o to 5^ puds. Bags of large loaves weigh 5 puds and barrels 40 to 45 puds. T ea '—As already mentioned in my last report,,the bulk of the tea trade is in the h lids of a firm in Rostoff-on-Don. There are three transport companies in Russia who have the privilege of undertaking the tranship ment from the Black Sea to the-Caspian without having actually to deposit in Batum the duties which arc repayable on export from Baku. Thus all the merchants here bring out their tea through these transport companies, and by paying them a small fee are saved all trouble with the Russian customs authorities. The transport people, in their turn, place all orders obtained with the aforesaid firm in Rostoff. There has of late, however, sprung up a tendency to import the tea direct from Calcutta, and thus save the various intermediary brokerages and commissions. Naphtha *—Some five years ago a large Russian oil firm started business in Persia. With the object of capturing the whole of this import trade they be gan underselling all the small merchants, who, of course, cannot resist such competition for long. Up till now, however, local importers have managed to hold their own, owing to their comparatively small expenses. In 1910 the firm endeavoured to obtain a concession from the Persian Government to lay a pipe line from Enzali to Rasht with the option of prolonging it to Tehran. Local merchants set up such an opposition that the Government refused to grant the concession. The Russian firm has, however, come to stay and has bought a large site on the outskirts of Rasht, where reservoirs, offices and dwel ling houses, have been built on a lavish scale. In time the naphtha trade of Northern Persia will no doubt become a monopoly of this firm, who, with this object in view, can well afford to work for some years at a loss.

The latter buys cocoons by advancing money at no fixed purchase rate, which is never settled on until long after the goods have been already disposed of m Europe, h or instance, the price of cocoons exported in 1910 was only settled m June, 1911, or less than a month before the new cocoons were ready. This is, perhaps, exceptional, but is a good indication of the prevailing system. The seller usually remains debtor after settling accounts, and the purchaser agrees to receive payment in cocoons the following year. Before the season, however, further advances are made to the sellers by the purchaser, and thus the former again remains debtor when the cocoons have been delivered. This system was all right when the difference between the purchase price in Persia and the sale price in Europe left a margin of 30 to 40 per cent, but now that rates have levelled up, cocoon buyers would willingly put a stop to this mode of purchase, which exposes them to great risks. Some, however, are precluded from doing so by competition, and others through being large creditors of amounts they can otherwise never hope to encash. The fact remains that during the last few years only those dealers who have combined the import of grain with the export of cocoons have been able to make the two ends meet. As insurances are effected and advances made on cocoons on the strength of bills of lading I consider it my duty to draw the attention of insurance brokers and shippers to irregularities, which take place here. Some agents of steamship companies, either out of ignorance or from excess of confidence in their friends , issue bills of lading sometimes without inspecting the bales to be shipped. Exporters are known to have held bills of lading many days before the goods were delivered to the shippers. In one particular case, now before the Erench law courts, small bales were shipped instead of large ones, as declared in the bill of lading, against which advances were made, and it was only on consignees taking delivery of the goods that the fraud was discovered. Tobacco .—The tobacco crop of 1910 was very good and estimated at 50,000 puds (36 lbs.). The price was about 50 krdns, or 18s. 6|cZ. per pud (36 lbs.). _The cultivation of tea is extending in Gllan. It was first tried in Lahijan, and now experiments are being made in Fumen. The quantity produced is as yet very small, and this produce cannot be considered at pre sent as of commercial value. Cotton .—Cotton grown in Gilan gave good results, but the native is too apathetic to make extensive experiments. The cotton exported to Russia via Enzali comes from Isfahan, Kashan, Qum, Kazvln and Tarum. Prices* in 1909 were 950 krdns (17L 10s. Id.) per kharvdr of 650 lbs. and in 1910, 1,060 krdns (19k 6s. 3|d.). A portion of the 1909 crop which had remained on hand was disposed of as well as the whole of that of 1910. Forests. Since the monopoly of the export of wood was terminated about two or three years ago, some Armenians have obtained from private owners510 RASHT ^ i options to exploit certain forests, and are endeavouring to dispose of these options to foreign and, among others, to British firms. One of the stipu lations of the original contracts is the payment within a fixed limit of a cer tain sum, failing which the option lapses. Before acquiring such options it is therefore advisable (after having obtained reliable information as to the forest belonging to the person who has given the option) to ascertain whether the necessary preliminary payments have duly been made. Security of roads .—The road from Enzali to Kazvin and Tehran was per fectly safe throughout the whole period under review, but it was blocked for many days during the winter of 1910-11. Freight. The cost of freight between Rasht and Tehran has ranged be tween 145 and 200 Urdus per kharvdr of 650 lbs. (21. 13s. 8d. to 31. 14s. Id.). Goods take about 12 days by fourgon and 14 days by caravan, but delays are of frequent occurrence. The Persian Transport Company charge 14 shahis per pud (36 lbs.) for transport of goods by road from Enzali to Rasht. Cost of transport by the Murdab varies according to demand, season and weather. Delays are usual. Exchange. Exchange has been very unsteady during the last two and a half years. It varied from 51| in January 1910, to 57 in April 1009 the average was about 54 Urdus to the pound. Naphtha for Rasht is received in small cylindrical iron tanks, which are emptied into reservoirs and retailed to the inhabitants. That for the interior is received ill sheet iron boxes of 5, 4i and 3 puds; two of each make a camel mule, and donkey load respectively. Silkwormeggs.—M..

Each box contains 1,500 lengths. The price of guts prepared for export is about bOU to 650 krans per 1,000, or Ilk 2s. Zd. to 12k 0s. 9&lt;k A fee is paid to the doc tor attached to the Russian Consulate who examins the guts previous to delivering a permit for importation into Russia. , ^ Exports. Rice.—The rice crop of 1910 was better than that of IJOJ, which had suffered from drought. Prices rose from 3s. 6±d. to 3s. 8fck (9 * 50 to 10 krdns) per kuti of 65 lbs. for Alaf i rice and from 3s. 8f ck to 4s. Of o». (10 to 11 krdns) for Arbdbi rice to 4s. 3 T yk (11 • 50 krdns) for Alafi and 4s. 9 f ck for Arbdbi rice. Alafi rice is of mixed quality and uncleaned ; it is of in ferior quality, and is used for the preparation of starch and in the manufac ture of starched shirtings. Arbdbi rice is used for food. Rice represents the principal revenues of the landowners in Gilan, to whom a good or bad crop is a matter of considerable importance. Large sumsare advanced every year to owners by merchants, who buy the rice from them for export and in such cases the price is fixed beforehand and forms the basis of the eventual purchase price for the minor buyers. The Banque d’Escompte de Perse used to do a great business in this line by undertaking for local buyers the sale of their rice in Russia and charging heavy commis sions on sales and interest on advances. Latterly, however, merchants have done their own selling through agents in Baku. The 1911 crop has suff ered much from frost in spring, which delayed work in the fields, and from drought during the months of July and August.

The surrounding land and villages, of which there are a considerable number, are owned by him. The place is most picturesquely situated at the foot of a range of rocky hills, out from the foot of which rush large streams of water, which form at once a small river and, falling over some rocks with a considerable noise, flow on down the plain, forming one of the headwaters of the Kara Su : water, cold and clear. The river abounds in pools and runs, #nd the fish in it, which run to about 4 pounds, take a small gold spoon. The place contains large fruit gardens and a number of trees. The adjacent plain is well irrigated and well cultivated. Ducks and geese are seen occasionally on the river in August, and it, like all others in this part of the country, _ is full of tor toises and small fresh-water crabs. There is another stream which in summer only commences to run when opposite the town. It comes down the valley south-west of the Gardaneh N’al Shikan and is dry to within a mile of Rawansir. The place contains a mosque and 16 shops, one or two of which are kept by Jews, and one by an Armenian. The crops, wheat and barley, are reaped in August. Supplies : 50 horses, 300 cows, 50 donkeys, 1,200 sheep and goats.

In the hills of this district there are several places, where stone has been quarried in ancient times, for instance the Takht-i-Sangi in the Kamar Kuh the place called Kushk, and others. People ascribe the works to the stone-cutter Farhad, the lover of Shirin. The soil of the district is very fertile, producing grain a hundred-fold.

C300GSB River) from Manjil, Sea, which it enters522 SAFID RCD It is crossed by a ferry a little west of the village of Rashtabad on the road from Rasht to Lahljan. The river here is at least 100 yards wide. The left bank is abrupt, but the right is low and in the dry season covered with fragments of rocks and trees, marking the course of the wide and rapid torrent which the river becomes in the spring. Fraser considers the ferry is a very dangerous one. There is an extensive sturgeon fishery carried on at the mouth of the river for the manufacture of caviare. The men employed are chiefly Russians. The permanent settlement consists of about thirty hufs and half a dozen store houses thatched with reeds, but during the months of February, March, and April, which is the season for taking the sturgeon, a reinforcement of some 300 men arrive from Astrakhan to assist at the fishing. In the beginning of February they catch about 100 and towards the end of the month from 600 to 800 per day. In March the number increases from 800 to 2,000 and during April they take between 3,500 and 3,800 a day. The larger number, however, is only caught for about fifteen days, previous to the rising of the river, when the ships depart with the produce. After the month of May little or no roe is found in the fish. The mode of catching the sturgeon is as follows. Across the river a long line is extended, to which at intervals of about a foot and a half are attached other lines, 2 feet in length, each having a strong and slightly barbed hook at its extremity. The weights of these sink the rope below the surface of the water, but a number of cork or wooden floats support it, so that the hooks just touch the ground when the lines to which they are fixed are kept stretched. The sturgeon generally swim near the bottom. When passing through the lines he is pricked by a hook upon which he mak s a plunge, and is caught by two or three of those nearest to him. A couple of fishermen are s&lt; ationed in a boat at the end of the line, and on seeing the disturbance haul in the line and secure the fish with a gaff. The lines are placed across the river from its mouth to within half a mile of the sea, and also in the sea across the mouth of the river. The fish are taken as they ascend the stream to deposit their spawn. The method of curing is as follows : The fish being split, the roe and the substance which forms the isinglass are taken out; the latter is pre pared by being simply hung up to dry in the sun. The roe is immersed in strong brine for two hours, then strained through a coarse sieve, and finally submitted to a strong pressure in small bags of malting to get rid of the water. It is then stowed aw T ay in casks for exportation under name of caviare. These casks contain 40 puds each (1,444| lbs.), and the annual number amounts to 300 or 350. About 250 puds of isinglass are produced. It is said that in a tolerably good year the number of fish taken amounts to about 125,000, which in their salted state sell at Astrakhan for from 3 to 4 and 5 hr tins per pud (about Id. a lb.) There are three species of sturgeon besides some other fish, from which the roe is taken, to make caviare, but all the different kind's are mixed up in the same vat. The salt consumed here is brought in large blocks from the Turkoman coast .—[Fraser ; Holmes ; Pushchin.)SAF—SAH 523 SAFlD-T AMISH EH— ' Pasture land east of Surldiani stream which forms the boundary bet ween Gilan and Mazandaran.— (Rabino.)

SAHAND— A mountain 1,200 feet high about 20 miles south-south-east of Tabriz in Azarbaljan. Its snow-capped peak is to be seen from Zinjan and other distant places. The mountain is of volcanic origin ; about half way up its slope is »n immense bed of volcanic ash, extending east and west, where the shep herds have dug caves for their flocks at night, or when overtaken by storms. Near the summit are large quantities of porphyry, from which the ancient tombstones found near Tabriz, and the stones seen in the foundations of mosques and bridges are taken. It takes a fine polish and is as hard as adamant and black as ebony. In the region of this ash bed, towards the north-east of the range, is a fine hot spring, with an ancient bath still standing, said to be the work of Shah ’Abbas. The water is impregnated.524 SAUL—SAHN t with iron, and quite a deposit is made as the hot overflow cools off At the foot of Sahand on the south, large quantities of fossils of Mesozoic and Camozoic times are found, amongst them are ammonites (Vipcosia fluvio- rum), a kind of large short, twisted periwinkle, and numerous parts of the paleotherium magnum. The bones of the paleotherium magnum were found far up on the south side of the mountain and the toes have been found west of Tabriz, in a chalky formation, so that it is safe to conclude that the foot of the mountain on the south side is Triassic and Jurassic, higher up on the south side, and all the way up on the north side it is Cretaceous tertiary There is an alabaster quarry at the south-west foot, near Lake Urumleh.— (Picot, 1894.)

Directly south of the plains are the hot springs, called Isp Su by the Turks, and Ab-i-Garm by the Persians. They are remarkable for several reasons ; the flow of water is large, and so hot as to be uncomfortable to the touch ; it is strongly impregnated with minerals, amongst which are sulphur and borax. The water is led off and made to flow down the slopes, and during the process of evaporation considerable deposits are given off, and in this way much borax is obtained. Nearly all that used by the gold and silversmiths of Tabriz is said to come from this spring , 4 or 5 miles to the west is a mountain of sulphur. North of the hot springs, at the south edge of the plain, is an alabaster mine, which has been worked for ages.— (Picot, 1894.)

SAMNAN (district)— A district which, together with that of Damghan, now forms a separate Government, but formed up to about 40 years ago a part of Khorasan. Sumnan is a very extensive district, but one of the most thinly populated of Persia. Its area is about 10,000 square miles, but the greater part of this is desert, and the population of the district barely exceeds 15,000. It is bounded on the north by the Elburz, on the west by the Tovarkan hills, on the east by the Ahuan hills, and on the south it extends to beyond Blabanak, nearly 200 miles from Samnan town. The district furnishes a regiment of infantry to the Persian Army, w T hich, considering the small population, takes away from the district a considerable percentage of itsmen. The revenue which the state derives from the district is 19,500 tumdns per annum. The grain, which the district produces, supplies food for the population, small as it is, for only three months in the year. Water also is not abundant, and enormous masses of sand coming from the desert on the south and forming moving hills, frequently bury the water courses and fields close to Samnan town. The winds blowing from the desert are often poisonous and cause a failure of the fruit crop, blighting the blossoms or drying up the fruit, as happened in 1885. The Samnan sub-districts (buluks) are Sangsar, Shah Mirzad, Darzazin. Deh-i-Sufian in the hills north of the district, Jam in the Ahuan hills on the east, Mu’min- abad, Sufiabad, Surkheh and Lasgird on the west and ’Ala and Biabanak in the south.— {Schindler.) SAMNAN (town)—L ong. 53° 22' 31' ; Lat. 35° 34' 13' (telegraph office near north gate) ; Elev. 3,738'. Chief place and the residence of the Governor of the Samnan district, 13 miles from Tehran and 107 miles from Shahrud, with a population of about 25,000 souls. The town was plundered in August, 1911, by the ex-Shah’s troops after t hey had defeated the Government troops at Damghan. Samnan has 5 quarters inside the town, Nasar, Asfanjan, Chub-i-Masjid Latibar and Shah Jugh, and a large quarter called Mahallat (pronounced Malet), comprising the three villages Kushmaghan, Kudivur, and Zavaghan (pronounced Zoghan) and extending to two miles west of the town, out side. There are four gates, Darvazeh-i-Nasar on the north, Darvaz- eh-i-Khorasan on the east, Darvazeh-i-Chub-i-Masjid on the south and Dar- vazeh-i-Traq on the west. The town is plentifully supplied with water from four large open reservoirs, called istalkh, outside the town, near the Nasar gate. There, near the reservoirs, stand six caravansarais, of which only one is built of bricks ; this is the Karvansarai Shah ’Abbasi, now very much out of repair. The other caravansarais are the Sipah Salarl with 29 rooms ; the Karvansarai-i-Agha Baba, with 28 closed (with doors) and 29 open rooms ; the Karvansa ai-i-Afghan with 48 closed and 50 open rooms; the Karvansaral-i-Kafshduz ’All Kuli and the Karvansarai-i- Navab Saif Ullah Mirza. Inside the town are five caravansara's, none of any importance. The bazaars are very clean, the shops well filled and trade is flourishing. At the western entrance of the Mahallat quarter are the tombs of the Imamzadeh Alavi and Imamzadeh Ashraf, both with domes. A little fur ther one passes the tomb of Saiyid M'rza Hasan, also an Imamzadeh, and a curious ruined tower, called Burj-i-Ch' h'l Dukhtar, where, according to the legend, forty virgins, who are all buried there, once upon a time lived a holy life. Near the Nasar gate, outside the town is the tomb of the Imamzadeh ’Ali ibn-Ja’afar. In the Asfanjan quarter and in the centre of the town stands the old Masjid-i-Jam’a, built in the 13th century, and so many times repaired that its old foundations have almost disappeared. The last who had it repaired was Muhammad Shah 50 years ago. Overlooking the small court of this mosque is a minaret, 60 feet high, with a spiral staircase of 90 steps leading to its top, from which the Mu’azzin calls the faithful to532 SAND—SANE prayer at the appointed time. A few yards eastwards from this mosque stands the Masjid-i-Shah, with a large court, 30 rooms for priests, two very fine halls 40 feet high, and a marble tank in the centre of the court. This was built by Fath ’Ali Shah and a college, the Madraseh-i-Shah, is joined to it. Samnan has two other colleges, Madraseh-i-Mehdi Quli Khan and Madraseh-i-Sadiq Khan, and 12 other smaller Masjids. In the north-eastern part of the town are three ruined forts or mounds 30 to 40 feet high ; the three forts are called collectively Burj-i-Mirza ’Askar! ; one, the largest, goes by the name of Kaleh-i-Turkoman and has in its midst a 60 feet deep well full of noxious gases. The forts were constructed during the last century. Close to them stands the ruin called Chehiltan (the forty bodies), a tomb of forty darvishes. Close to the Nasargate is the a-k or citadel with the residence of the Governor and the Persian Government Telegraph Office, both very neat buildings, with excellent accommodation. The town has 13 public baths ; there are also a post-house and a post office. The usual dilapidated mud huts surround the town. Population. —The population of Samnan is about 25,000 souls. No Jews are allowed to resid: in the town, but there are some Hindu traders. Language. —The language spoken by the. natives is, according to Khani- koff, a Mazandaran diahc enrich d by more vowels. It is renowned for its unintelligibility. Resources. —The celebrated rusks or rather biscuits of S .mnan are made of flour, butter and milk and baked very hard. They are, when dry, as hard as stone and taste somewhat musty. In tea they almost immediately get soft, seem to melt in fact, and form a rather insipid paste. In spite of the liberal supply of water in the town, the environs do not appear to profit thereby as much as they might, although a good deal of tobacco of an inferior class to that of Shiraz is grown. There are numerous gardens in and around the town, every house appears to have its garden. Figs, grapes and some other fruits are grown in the gardens; the figs are small, but well flavoured, and the grapes make excellent wine. The town boasts of numerous trees and has some very fine old chenars. Jews are prohibited from residing in the town, but there are some Hindu Banmahs engaged in trade, as Samnan is the point where a route from Bunder ’Abbas via Yazd and Tabbas comes in.

There is an excellent sarai here. It is 85 miles from Yazd on the road to Biabanak. Gill says this place is 71| miles from Yazd, that it has a hundred houses, and that its elevation is 4,070 feet.— (MacGregor.) S AUJ BULAGH (1)— Lat. 36° 45'; Long. 45° 45'. Elev. 4,770'. The local capital of the Kurds of Azarbaijan, with a population of some 15,000, of whom sixty families are Armenians. It is a prosperous little town entirely Kurdish with an excellent bazaar. The town-was taken by the Kurds during the Kurdish troubles of 1880. There is supposed to be a garrison of half an infantry battalion and a detachment of artillery, but in 1891 there was only half a company in garrison here. A considerable trade in furs is carried on from here with Russia ; and there is a Russian consu late in the place. An agent of a French house buys up regs in these districts, they say to the extent of several hundred thousand francs. It is situated on the stream of the same name. There is a telegraph station here on the Persian branch line from Tabriz. The place gives its name to a district. There are many nomads about in the district, who might be able to supply camels. Forage and grain are procurable in the western portion of the district. Water is plentiful, except in the barren tracts of the east. The only natural fuel is a small shrub found on the plain, which answers the purpose well, but is difficult to collect. The great caravan route between Tabriz and Sulaimanleh passes through Sauj Bulagh. During winter and spring Sauj Bulagh can only be reached from Bunab by very round-about ways, the tracts of land lying low, being then quite impassable, caravans have to follow the skirt of the mountains as far as Mlanduab, whence they can cross the Jaghatu. There are two routes to M' sul (in Turkey), one by Ushnu and the other south by the Kalishln pass. It is the headquarters of the local Governor, under the orders of the Govern or General of Azarbaijan. It is situated on the Sauj Bulagh dial, running northwards into Lake Urumieh.The garrison in 1904 consisted of two regiments of infantry, one of cavalry and some more or less serviceable looking guns. The local Kurds are well armed and are relied on by the Government to supply a strong contingent when required.— (NapierGerard ; Curzon ; Gough, 1905.) SltJ BULAGH (2)— A small village to the left of the road from Ahar in Azarbaijan to Ardabil 24 miles from the former. It is situated on the pinnacle of an isolated hill, at the foot of which flows the Ahar stream. It is surrounded by a wall and contains about twenty poor huts.— (Holmes.) SAUJ BULAGH (3)— A fertile district with many villages, forming part of the Tehran Govern ment. It is bounded on the north by the Elburz chain, on'the south by the Kuh-i-Jari and the Kuh-i-Nimak. The greater part of the plain between Tehran and Kazvin belongs to it.— (Schindler.) SAUJ BULlGH (River)— Vide Sauj Bulagh (1).

SAVAD KUH— A district of Mazandaran, which extends north from the crest of the pass from Tehran down the valley of the Talar to the village of Shlrgah.— (Stuart.) SAVALAN DAGH—Elev. 14,000'. A mountain in Azarbaijan, about 30 miles west of Ardabil. Its crown of perpetual snow feeds the stream even in summer, so that the country round stands in no need of irrigation. The base is 37 miles in diameter. An offshoot of the Savalan Dagh divides the two valleys and conse quently the basin of the Caspian Sea from that of Lake Urumieh. It is low in elevation and the incline moderate.— (Thielmann.) SAVEH (district)— The provinces of ’Iraq and Saveh, together with Kazzaz and Mahaialt, form one government, though for some years they formed separate gov ernments.548 S1VEH The district of Saveh comprehends those of Zarand and Karaghan under the general designation of Khalajistan, and embraces an extensive tract of country, inhabited by large numbers of nomads. The revenues of the Government farmed out of the above districts amount to 727,357 brans cash, 17,405 kharwdrs grain and 2,228 kharwdrs straw. The chief place of Iraq is Sultanabad (q.v.) which has a population of 6,000. Khalajistan is subdivided into 5 buluks ; 1 Sardab with Tajkhatun; (2) Jahrud with Jahrud and 29 other villages; (3) Karab or Tafrash with Ashtian; (4) Yazvah ; (5) Kahgird, on the high road between Qum and Sultanabad. The Governor of this district lives at the town of Saveh.— {Schindler.) This district provides a regiment of infantry. SAVEH (town)— Saveh is 72 miles south-west of Tehran, towards the western extremity of a plain of inconsiderable breadth, which towards the east, gradually resolves itself t into kav'ir, large patches of which occur about the 9th mile east of the town, and narrow in near the Kuh-i-Nimak blending with the desert. The plain is but partially cultivated, and is watered on the southern side by the Kara Chai, a slightly brackish stream bowing east, and having, from the band or dam of Shall ’Abbas to near Majidabad, thirteen villages on its bank. The villages, which are far from the river, are ill-supplied with water for irrigation, and many of them possess no garden land at all, but the soil is said to be excellent where it does not run into the kavir. The cultivation of the plain is carried on in the most slovenly manner, the land is not even cleared of the small tufts and bushes which abound on it, but, after being watered, and sprinkled with seed, is ploughed up, and smoothed over with a wooden drag. The produce is stated to be 10 for 1. The productions are wheat, barley, rice, cotton, 'palma christi, melons, figs, grapes, and pomegranates renowned for their excellence. The present town of Saveh is built on the site of the ruins of a town twice its size, which was formerly surrounded by a wall and towers. The population is now about 8,000. There is a small covered-in bazaar con taining the necessaries of life and a small assortment of Russian piece goods. Caravans do not visit the town, as it is off the road to Tehran, but the post service runs through it to Kushk-i-Nusrat on the Tehran- Qum road, and there is a chdpdr station here. A manufacture of saltpetre from the earth of the ruins is still carried on, but not so vigorously as was the case in the former Shah’s reign, as this place supplies the Tehran arsenals for the manufacture of gunpowder, for which there is now less demand than formerly. There are also stories of buried treasure and of some European having made a big haul of gold coins in a jar a few years ago after months of digging, when he speedily departed with the spoil. Saveh is the headquarters of a district, which includes part of Khala jistan and contains a large number of nomads, Baghdadi Shihsavans, and two tribes &gt;f Turks, the Khalaj, and part of the Baiaat who live in villages. Their chie s are, respectively, Ahmad Khan, Saif-ul-Mamalik, and Bahla-i- Sultan, Arnir-i-Panj, both of whom live in Tehran.SAY—SER 549 The people say that the ancient town of Saveh was situated more to the west of the present site, and that some traces of it exist; they also affirm that this 'plain was formerly covered by the sea, forming one with the kav]r of Qum, and that the subsidence of the waters was one of the miracles accomplished at the birth of their prophet. _ # The water-supply is from open canals fed by the Mazdaqan river, and from one underground canal. There are two old mosques, one inside, the other outside the town, the former built in 1518, the latter in lol6, both are ruined. The one outside the town has a beautiful minaret 36 feet high. There are nine public baths, four graves of saints, and a bazaar with one hundred and twenty shops. _ The town Aveh (j.u.) is generally mentioned together with Saveh, {Schindler.)

The people are Kurds of various tribes.— {Burton.) SHAH ’ABBAS (Causeway of)— This celebrated roadway was constructed by Shah ’Abbas between Glla n and Astarabad, a distance of nearly 400 miles. In its original form it would seem to have consisted of a stone causeway {sang-farsh) of different widths in different places, but generally about 20 feet with a ditch on each side. In some places the width between the ditches is as much as 45', but this is con siderably beyond that of the actual pavement, which does not exceed 20 feet. In consequence of the almost incessant rain in this part of the country, and of the want of all repair, the causeway has almost entirely fallen into a ruinous condition, and specially so wher e the water-courses from the hills cross it, as the bridges which formerly stood at these places have been in most instances destroyed. In many parts the stones of which it was constructedSHAH’A—8HAHD 551 have been washed away, and their place has been supplied by logs ana branches of trees, so that it is now difficult even for mules to pass.— {Todd ; Holmes ; Eastwick.)

SHAHR-I-ZUR— ;-£S A place in Kurdistan, once a fertile and populous district: now (1910) an abandoned plain through which the Jaf tribe pass twice a year. It is cross ed by the road from Zuhab to Sulaimameh. Rich says that it is situated at the foot of the Avroman range and that Gulambar is the capital. It forms part of the disputed frontier between Persia and Turkey ; but has been appropriated by the Turks, who have built barracks, erected telegraphs and instituted a local Government. The plain of Shahr-i-Zur is separated from the Shir van by the Nilambu ridge. Sulaimameh is about 5 stages distant. C300GSB554 SHAHR-SHAHS There were formerly many Chaldeans settled in the district, but they were exterminated about 120 years ago in the massacre organized by Shaikh ’Abdul Qadir Gilani. Shahr-i-Zur possesses a large number of villages on the fringe of the plain. These, with the exception of one or two occupied by the old tribe of Shahr- i-Zur, are inhabited by settled Kurds of the Bana, Jaf and Avroman tribes. The present population of Shahr-i-Zur is said to be 50 Jews and 20,000 Kurds .—{Rich ; Soane, 1910 ; Rabino, 1911.)

It is crossed by the Pul-i-Lushan {q.v.) on the Kazvln-Rasht road.— {Schind ler.) SHAHS AY AN— A very large tribe of Persia to be met with chiefly in Azarbaljan and the great central plateau or old Province of Traq-i-’Ajam. History .—The Shahsavans have long ago ceased to act up to their name i.e., Shah-loving. They did not assist the Shah Sultan Husain, the last Shah of the Safavis, against the Afghan: in 1722, and joined the Russians in 1826 during the Russo-Persian war of that year. Apparently the Shahsavans change their politics frequently. In the revolu tion of 1909 they did not play any important part, and refused to obey the ex-Shah’s orders to invade Gilan and expel the nationalists, but the following year we find them in revolt against the Government. In April 1910 Yprim with a Government force, defeated the Shahsavans ; but in September 1910 the tables were turned, and the Governor of Ardabil was defeated by the Shahsavans, near Ardabil. The tribe was then actually threatening Tabriz and Ahar. In June 1911, after a period of apparent quiescence, the Shah- savans again revolted, along with the Karadaghis. This was presumably in favour of the ex-Shah Muhammad ’Ali, for Mujallal-us-Saltaneh and Shua us- Saltaneh, two of the ex-Shah’s lieutenants, were reported to have appeared among them. Some Shahsavans fought for Shuja-ud-Dauleh at the end of that year, but evidently the tribe did not support him whole-heartedly. In June and July of 1912 another revolt occurred among the Shahsavans in the neighbourhood of Ardabil and Ahar. The Persian Government sent a force of about 1.000 men to try and suppress it, but this force made no headway until supported by the Russians, who undertook extensive operations, lasting for some months, against the tribe. Altogether about 5,000 troops, operating in three columns from Tabriz, Ardabil and Julfa were employed from July to November. The Shahsavans put up several good fights, and at one time broke away south, and threatened Kazvin. In 1912 Russia, having defeated them severely, and confiscated all their flocks, forced them to submit. The Russians realized 3,000 roubles by selling captured flocks. * Tribal .—The Shahsavans are divided into five main branches. The Baghdadi, Ainallu or Inanlu, Afshar, Duiran, Kurdbaglu, and extend from the plain of Mughan in Russian territory north of Azarbaljan to Zinjan,SHAHS A VAN 555 Kazvln and Saveh, and there are also some few families in other parts of Persia. Other sub-tribes frequently mentioned are Giklu, Khwaja Khujalins, and Khwaja Begins. They do not appear to have any very close inter-tiibal relation, or to kno w much about each other, and this is probably owing to the fact that, as General Schindler menti ns in his book, “ Eastern ’Iraq ”, the Shahsavans i.e., Shah-loving, were formed by Shah ’Abbas I, who banded a number of Turkish tribes together under th .t name in ord x to break the power of the 32 Kizilbash tribes, some of whom afterwards joined the Shahsavans. General Schindler speaks of the Shahsavans as the most powerful tribe in Per sia and men ions the Asaf-ud-Dauleh as their chief. As regards arms and horses, he thinks that | are well armed and that one man in five has a horse. Commencing with the Bijhd dls about whom information is more de tailed, and which is the particular branch that the Cossack Br'gade recruits from, the Chief of the clan is the Mansur-i-Nizam now serving with the Cossack Brigade in Tehran. The clan is divided inf » 26 sub-tribes, numbering from, say, 150 to 400 tents each, grouped u der 6 principal Katkhudds, and the names of the sub-tribes are as follows :— 1. Sulduz. 14. Kalavand. 2. Kuh Salar. 15. Kalabli. 3. Daulatwand 16. Haji Husainli. 4. Aqquyunll. 17. Kurd. 5. Karuyunli. 18. Miklavanli. 6. Dugir. 19. Yarimishli. 7. Chalabi. 20 Zaghal. 8. Yarajanli. 21. Karamli. 9. Muzafarli. 22. Satall. 10. Kara Muhammadll. 23. Kuturll. 11. Ahmadli. 24. Mihrabli. 12. Qasimli. 25. Haq-i-Jamli. 13. Haji Hasanli. 26. Husain Khanli. Taking an average of, say, 270 tents to each sub-tribe, the total strength of the Baghdadi i would amount to roughly 7,000 tents or families, and this agrees fairly well with two estimates, which were given by the Sipah Salar and by General Kossagovsky. The former would not be likely to minimise or the latter to exa gerate their numbers. It may be estimated that, including the men now furnished to the Cossack Brigade, the Baghdadi might produce altogether 2,000 fighting men, of whom 1,000 would be mounted and armed with rifles of sorts. Ainalu. —The Ainalu are said to number about 10,000 families. The Asaf-ud-Dauleh, Governor of Shiraz was the head of the clan, but the ma nagement of it is now entrusted to the Iqbal-i-Sultan, the Asaf-ud-Da Teh’s son-in-law. The tribe supplies 300 sowars to the Persian Government. They live between Zinjan and Kazvin and Saveh, and are supposed to be able to turn out 1,300 mounted men armed with rifles. Afshar .—The Afshar number about 6,000 families. Their chief is Jahan Shah Khan, who is now living near the village of Haidar Paighambar on the road between Hamadan and Zinjan, and has the control of 50 villages.556 SHAHS—SHAHT The tribe is supposed to be able to turn out 1,000 mounted men with rifles and lives in Khamseh round about Zinjan. It furnishes 300 sowars to Government. Duirdn .—The Duiran number 5,000 families. Their Chief is the Qias-i-Nizam now in Tehran. They are found between Qum and Kazvln and in the Elburz range and supply 200 sowars to Gov ernment. They are supposed to be able to supply 700 mounted men with rifles. Kurdbaiglu .—The Kurdbaigiu number 7,000 families, their Chief being the Mansur-ul-Mulk. They are now placed under the Sidq-us-Saltaneh and furnish 300 sowars to Government. Mr. Rab no (1909) gives the following info'Ttnation about ihe Shahsa- vans o Azarbaljan, who spend part of the y&lt; ar in the plain of Mughan and the other in Persia around Arda 1 .il and Zinjan. “These Shahsavans are subdividi d into the following branches Kojenb^glu, Udlu, Karagasemlu, Sarkhanlu, ’Alitabalu, Hamz Ekhanlu, Irza’Alilu (Riza’AlIlu), Aqqas mlu Nmruz Alibcglu, Bababeglu, Muradlu, Zargar (proprietors of the village of Zargar), Knali ehlu, B&lt; gbaglu/Arablu, Ajarlu, Millu, Yeddi, Uimak, Humonlu, Jalandarlu, Saddatmellu, Saddat-Zarangi, Sari-Ja’farlu, Damirchilu, Muradlu, Churbaslu, Husain Hajjilu, Kalash, Mug anlu, Talish-Mikailu or Janiarlu, Hajji-Khojehlu, Kailu/Aliyuldash, Hajjianlarudi, and Pirivadlu. Ttie following are scttl'd around Ardabil and do not frequent the plain of Mughan : Takleh, Talish-Mikailu of Ardabil, Jehankhanumlu and Begbaglu. The Khojehbcglu are the most powerful o c the Mughan Shahsavans and it is amongst them that the other branches chose their chiefs. These nomads spend the winter and cold season in the plain of Mughan and the summer in the Savalan mo ntain. To pass from their summer to their winter quarters or vice versa they have to traverse the Gaduk-i-Bar- zand, a rugged defile, by occupying which with a small 'orce, the governor of Ardabil was able in former years to compel them to pay their yearly tribute.” SHAHSUVAR (1)— A village in Azarbaijan, 18 miles from Khwaja, which is 20 miles north east of Tabriz.— (Holmes.)

SHAHU (contraction of Shah Kuh)— The chain beigns at the village of Darian in the Avroman Lahun huluk of Kurdistan and runs in a south-east direction to Kirmanshah and beyond it. Near Kirmanshah it is called Purau, i.e. full of water. The range contains a number of wells or holes about 40 zar (140 feet) in depth. In Juanrud these holes are called Nur and in some of them live some white worms which people collect and dry and use for cooling their drinks in summer. Only experienced climbers can go down these holes in safety. The late Mirza ’Ali Akbar Vakai’h-nigar has stated that this mountain was a volcano cjuiescent at present, but sure to become active again. There are, however, no signs of it having been a volcano.

(Schindler.) i- to SHARAFBA1NI or SHARAIANNI— Most northerly of all the Guran tribes is the Sha'afbaini tribe, which in habits the districts called Hurin, and Shaikhan of the Bamu mountain, »nd also lands farther north towards the Laqlaq mounta n. The Kirmanshah Gazetteer the last information printed, quotes Aziz Beg as the chief. He died in 1907 and left his tribe in the hands of his two sons. In 1909, the elder564 SHARAFBAim of the two killed his brother and gained undisputed possession of the tribe. As the mother of the younger had been a relation of Fateh Beg, chief of the Walad Begl, a neighbouring tribe, this constitued a blood feud which existed till March 1911. A meeting was then called, at which it was proposed to make peace, and the son and brother of Aziz Beg with five other relatives were present. At a given signal ones of Fateh Beg’s sons and his adherents fell upon these individuals and murdered them, the only remaining one of the family being an infant. Fateh Beg then assumed the leadership of the Sharafbaim, but owing to the threats of Baud Khan Kalhur, gave it up in April 1911, and the tribe is now (1912) under the leadership of Abdullah Beg, brother of the late ’Aziz Beg. He has also assumed the title Shahab-ul- Mamalik which was the right of ’Aziz Beg. Properly speaking Sharafbsinl is only the name of ’Abdullah Beg’s family and represents in numbers a very small portion of the tribe generally so called; this would be more correctl nam?d Kuraki.

It is bounded on the west by the Shirwan river from Maidan to Darband-i- Khan, on the north by the Zimna and G-awala mountains and by the Garrao and Kani Zhinan streams, on the east by the watershed of Guma Pushta, Sarpan and north Garrai, and on the south by the Cham-i-Garral, and ’Abbasan streams to Mamishan, thence by the Nao Machik range. Population .—Hurln is the chief place of the district, which has besides some 33 villages. Of these, 5 have been unwillingly ceded by the Sharaf- bainis to Fateh Beg, Walad Begi of Yaiglran. In the western portion of the district the population is insufficient to cultivate all the land at its disposal; in the eastern portion the land just suffices for its present occupants. There is a large number of religious Shaikhs in the district. Language .—The language 'spoken in the district is southern Kurmanji. Arabic and Turkish are not understood, and Persian only to a very limited extent.SHARI—SHlEV 565 Administration .—The government of the district is entrusted to the ruling chief of the Sharafbainl tribe. When the Persian Government existed the district was a sub-section of Zuhab, itself a sub-province of Kirman- shah. Communications .—The Sharafbaim country is far enough north to have lost touch with Qasr-i-Shmn in commercial matters, and to look to the better supplied markets of Sulaimanieh and Halabja for its necessities. Moreover 'the frontier here being unprotected by the Turks and Persians, goods pass without any customs’ fees. Consequently the roads leading from Hurin north are the most used, though the most difficult. There are recognized routes to the south, which, leading from various parts of the Sharafbainl country, all meet at Chia Surkh and there follow the Chia Surkh road to Qasr-i-Shirin. Routes from the west to the east are only passable for lightly laden beasts or persons on foot, except for the road through Darvand-i-Hul at the extreme south of the country, which, however, is very rough and bad — {Soane, 1913). ■ SHARIFABAD (1)—Lat. 36° 12' 17';’'Long. 50° 10' 0'.

The whole of this elevated valley from a few miles north-west of Burujird to Hashmatabad is 30 miles in length and about 6 miles in breadth. Many of the villages are built on artificially-raised mounds, probably to protect the inhabitants from the exhalations of the marshes and rice-fields, and also from the attacks of the Lurl tribes. It is divided into two sub districts—Upper and Lower —and is richly watered by the Tahij stream and its many tributary brooks ; every village has rich pastures and rice or corn fields.

SINNEH— Lat. 35° 12' 0'; Long. 47° 18' 0'. Elev. 5,300'. The proper name of this place is Sinandij though it is generally called Sinneh. It is the chief place of Persian Kurdistan or Ardalan and is situat d 200 miles south-south-east of Tabriz, south-west of Kazvln, 80 miles north west of Hamadan, 87 miles north of Kirmanshah, north-east of Baghdad and east-south-east of Sulaimameh. It is very old and is situated in the midst of an open cultivated valley, with abundant water and surrounded by gardens and orchards. A canal runs through the town which is surrounded by a mud wall. The number of houses is computed to be about 6,000 and the population 32,000, of whom a few hundreds are Jews and Armenians. The Kurds are practically ail Sunnis and hate their Shi ah rulers. It is so surrourd d by hills, that the town is not seen till you are close to the suburbs. Its gen eral anpearance is pleasing, the houses being well built and the gardens well kept. It enjoys a fine climate, the valley in which it lies being protected from the severity of the winter of this elevated country by the hills around, There are nominally a battalion of infantry, a squadron of cavalry and a battery of artillery in garrison here. There are 6 old bronze guns. There is a certain amount of trade between Turkey in Asia and Sinneh; the principal exports are carpets, hides, skins, wood, sheep and cereals ; the imports are gall nuts and dressed skins; the exports to Russia are the same as to Turkey, the imports being silk, samovars, crockery, tea, sugar and clothes. The chief industry is carpet-making, and as the wool is good the carpets are highly prized. Gerard says the rough and in some respects nicest looking carpets are the cheapest, 6 to 8 each, whilst a thick and heavr but rather smooth kind run to 40 to 60 r pees a piece. The Government revenue is about 100,000 tumdns per annum. The Jews and Armenians are addicted to drink, and distil a spirit local ly. There are a good man horses to be bought here, not much to look at, about 14-1, but good for work and useful. Sinneh is the centre of several routes ; to Hamadan 5 stages ; to Kirman shah 4 stages ; to Zuhab 8 stages. There is a P usian Government telegraph station here and a good kdfileh road leads rid Z njan to Russia. Supplies of all sorts are procurable in abundance. There are numer ous places well supplied with water on the surrounding hills, where troops could be encamped during the summer, if the town were too hot. The Musalmans are nearly all Shafai Sunnis. Until about 1880 the people lived in the old Kurdish way, wild and savage, but since then civilization has made its appearance and now there are, post and telegraph offices, military barracks, an arsenal, and a Turkish Consul. Before the arrival of this Consul, (Turkish Bash Shahbender) who by the way gives all the local authorities much trouble, the Turkish subjects in Kurdistan were looked after by an agent generally a merchant appointed by the Governor, and called Arab agasi (Master of Arabs). There were only formerly a few Turkish subjects; butSINE—SIN J 577 nan oftktoai ?rallv calti dissititi ailes nortl’ aghdadsEi ited valley, , A canal population Kurds art ourd-dk Its gen- rdens well protected 's around, r alrF and Sinneli; !als;^e tliesame iugai and 3 good tie ects nicest heavy dot ovemmek spirit local- to look at. are fl® 1 * 11 ’ /here M® about 1898 the Turkish Consul began granting Turkish papers to Persians, and though this was stopped by the Persian authorities then, the process wa^, renewed in 1900, and in 1913 ihere were about 2,000 families inSinneh with Turkish papers ; many of those were of bad character. The better classes of the people wear Persian dress, only the women keep to the old style of head dress. The women of the people do not veil, and do not wear chakhchurs (over-tronsers). Many Christians and Jews reside in Sinandij, and are well treated and lead happy lives. The Christians have fine large houses, shops, gardens, a caravan- sarai and a church j and the Musulmans hear the nagus rattling every day. Instead of ringing a bed, which is not allowed, a wooden board, swung on two poles like a swing is struck by wooden clubs, the board is the nogus. The town has 42 schools and 30 public baths, the latter are very filthy and evil-smelling. The Governor’s residence is in the castle on the hill, 42 feet above the town, and is called Dar-ul-Ayaleh. The barracks opposite the Governor’s residence were built in 1872 when Prince Farhad Mirza Mu’tamad- ud-Dauleh was Governor, and can accommodate a battalion of infantry. The water-supply is barely sufficient for the population, but it could be increased by leading the water into the town from the neighbourhood, where good water is abundant. About 1,000 paces from the town stands the hill Bldar from which a fine view of the town can be obtained, and between it and the town is the Bagh-i-Khiisruabad which is laid out in modern fashion with a lake and a water course, and pretty buildings .—(Gerard ; Yusuf Sharif ; Curzon ; Schindler, 1910.)

SINJABI— A tribe of Kurds who inhabit the Mahidasht plain. They are ’A1 Illahis. For many years this tribe was under Shir Khan, Samsam-ul-Mamalik, but he was deprived of his post in 1908 by Baud Khan Kalhur and again in 1910 after he had regained it. The leadership passed to As’adullah Khan, son of the late ’All Yardi Khan, a cousin of Shir Khan. Under Baud Khan he held, besides the leadership, the frontier post of Kaleh Sabzi, and his two brothers Habibullah and Amanullah, lived with him. Shir Khan lives in Mahidasht near Kirmanshah at Qalinj Khani. He has four sons, ’Ali Akbar Khan, Qasim Khan, and two boys. The first, by his bravery and intelligence, has now obtained leadership of the tribe, and has appointed a relation, Sulai- man Khan, to the frontier post of Kaleh Sabzi, As’adullah Khan and his brothers having retired to their village of Kharrat in Garsif on the Hulvan near Kaleh Sabzi. The Sinjabi tribe is entirely nomadic, spending its winter in Baghcheh and Qatar and around Kaleh Sabzi, and its summer in Mahidasht and near Juanrud. The sub-sections are Chalabi (the tribe of Shir Khan), Allahi Khan, under ’Abdul ’Ali Khan, and Balian under Saiyid Ahmad, and some smaller sec tions.

On the left bank of the river runs a bare spur at the foot of which is the village of Rizarud and groves of willow trees. Sulaimanieh is square-walled, the sides being 200 yards in length castel lated, and with corner flanking towers : the whole built of brick.— {Burton.) SULDUZ— The district of south-west Azarbaljan lying south and south-west of Lake Urumieh. It is separated from the Ushnu district by a barrier of rising ground. It is a fine, rich, well-watered district, of about 20 miles, by 16 miles, chiefly of flat fertile land, inhabited by two tribes of Kurds, Kara Papak and Bilbas, all notorious thieves. Good horses are bred in this district. In March 1911 there were 4 battalions and 6 mountain guns of the Turkish army in the j^ulduz district.—(Travers ; Thielmann ; War Office, Persia.) RULDUZ-CHAl— A river in Azarbaijan crossed on the road from Sheikh Ahmad to Sauj Bulagh, 22 miles north of the latter. It is crossed by a stone bridge of 3 arches to which the road makes a curious loop. The river seemed deep and unfordable. It is also called the Gadar-Chai and flows into Lake Urumieh. SULEHDEH.— Lat. 36° 35' 0'. Long. 52° 9' W.-{Walker.) A river in Mazandaran, 2| miles west of Izadeh, and forming the boun dary between Kalar Kustaq and Nur.

A palace of the Shah, in Shamran, 8 miles north of Tehran. It is comparatively recent, and on a grand scale. It lies some 600' higher than Gulahak, in the midst of a noble garden, where poplars and planes give ample shade and mulberries, plums, apples, and cherries can be gathered in abundance. . , Streams of clear water run by the sides of the valleys, and fountains, witn pellucid basins, fill up the vista in various directions, while a great tank a hundred yards long by 60 feet broad and 8 or 9 feet deep, occupies t e centre. Above this stands a large summer-house. For a full description of the place, Stack’s volumes are referred to. — {Stack.)SULTANABAD 583 SULTANABAD (2)— A village of some 400 houses with a population of about 1,500 people, has springs, Icandts and river.

The capital of the small province of ’Iraq, founded by Yusuf Khan Gurji in 1808, hence often called Shahr-i-Nau. It was a place originally chosen, as the station for re-organising the Persian army at the beginning of the last century. The town proper is a square compact mass of buildings, with straight and, for Persia, wide streets, running from end to end and side to side at right angles to each other. Down the centre of each street is a water-course. It was surrounded by a mud wall and ditch, but these are now being de stroyed and the space utilised for building ; all round the town, houses are being built and gardens laid down. The whole place shows every sign of vitality. The bazaars are good, fairly well built and full of people. There is one long one of about 600 yards, from which short ones of 50 to 100 yards branch off at right angles, and also many clean and well-conducted cara- vansarais. The town and district have been practically made by carpet-weaving. The district has always been noted for its weavers, who were to be found in Faraghan, a small district, about 20 miles north. Messrs. Ziegler and Company, a Manchester firm, have built large premises just outside the town covering about 40,000 square yards. They are so large and imposing as to have got the name of the Kaleh or Fort. In them are the dwelling- houses of their employes, offices, store and dyeing rooms. Twenty years ago, there were only about 40 looms in the town, now there are at least 1 , 200 , and in the surrounding villages, another 1,500. The firm, in 1900, was represented by Mr. Strauss, the Manager, and Messrs. Braondly, Wolfanger and Dr. Stoecker, all Germans or Swiss. Now (1912), one of the employes, Mr. Moir, is His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Sultana bad. They have no factory, the carpets being-woven in the district by contract, the colours and patterns being prescribed by the fir ms . The firm is much liked by the villagers, whom they treat very liberally and whose virtual masters they are, consequently they are not popular with the loteai landowners, who still treat the peasantry in the old Persian manner. The population is about 7,000 and it is an increasing place : the town is assessed at 35,000 tumdns and the province at 65,000 per annum. The province supplies four regiments of Infantry to the Persian army ; there are nominally 600 infantry in the town. The town lies in a wide basin 20 miles in diameter, and is of some com mercial importance, the staple industry being carpet-making. The country581 SULTAN B-SULTANK round is generally fertile and produces average crops of cereals ; vines flourish. To the north-east, distant 4 miles, lies a salt lake. During Jan uary and February traffic is impeded by heavy falls of snow when the thermometer falls to 3° below freezing. Supplies are procurable; trans port is scarce and must be collected from villages ; donkeys are much used by the villagers. There is an alternative road to Tehran via Saveh, besides the regular road through Qum. Sultanabad is the residence of a local governor having jurisdiction over the mahalls of Kazzaz, Chahar-ab, Farahan, Mahallat, and Kalat. There is a Persian telegraph and post office here.— (Bell ; Yusuf Sharif ; Preece ; Schindler ; Na'pier.) SULTAN BAJl— Elev. 2,905'. A village and large caravansarai, half way between Qum and Pul-i- Dallak on the old road to Tehran. Beyond it to the east is the Qumrud district belonging to Qum.— (Schindler.) SULTANlEH— Lat. 36° 25' 52'; Long. 48° 52' 20'. Elev. 5,596'. A large village containing 500 houses, the chief place of the Khuda- bandehlu sub-district of Khamseh. It lies 76 miles from Kazvln on the post road to Tabriz and some 26 miles south-east of Zinjan, and is situated in a pleasant and fertile plain where the Shah often encamps in the summer to avoid the hot and unhealthy climate of Tehran. It was the capital of the descendants of Hulaku. &lt;£ The tomb of Khudabandeh is really a noble edifice. The area is 100 feet in diameter ; the dome, 120 feet high from the ground, is nearly pointed at the top and covered with green lacquered tiles, with which it has also- been lined, but the interior is now plastered over. The body of the building is of octagonal form. A cornice is carried round the interior, about 12 feet from the ground, on which an Arabic inscription in large letters is carved, and has apparently been gilt. There is a sort of chapel attached to the tomb on the side nearest Mecca, and the same, by the way, is the case with the ruined, mosque in the suburb of Tabriz. The material of the edifice is brick; a minaret seems to have been placed on each of its angles ; of these, only one remains entire. There is another object of interest on the north side of the town—a fragment of wall about 40 feet high, and 4| feet thick, supported by buttresses and faced with square slabs of greenish stone, very neatly cut. The top seems to have been machicolated. The plain of Sultanleh is so ample that Napoleon’s Grand Army, with which he invaded Russia, might have manoeuvred in it with ease ; it is a great place for exercising troops. It is a famous place for a gallop, and foxes, hares, and deer are to be found ; but the ground is rendered dangerous for horses by the innumerable holes of the jerboa. There p,re some troops permanently stationed in the neighbourhood. Cheap rates prevail in the bazaar and water is fairly plentiful. (Lemm ; Yusuf Sharif ; Schindler.) SULTAN KULI— A village in Kirmanshah situated in the Bllawar valley about 30 miles north of Kirmanshah city.k It contains about 8 houses inhabited by Bilawari Kurds.

Kuchak Sumah lies 17£ miles from Mianeh on the road thence to Tabriz, Buzurg Sumah a couple of miles to the north of it.— (Schindler.) SUMAI (l).— The region, west of Salmas plain in north-western Azarbaljan, lying under a spur of the Kurdistan range. Coal beds are said to exist here. Just where the spur joins the main range are fine basaltic columns which beat the palisade of the Hudson river in everything except height; north of the columns is an old lava bed, from which all the tombstones of the Salmas plain are quarried. It is quite porous, with air cells, and is not a good stone to retain inscriptions. It is extensively used for gate and door jambs, bridges, tanks, troughs, etc. As one goes westwards, the rocks of the spur appear to go older, first the cenozoic, then the carboniferous. The elevation also rises as the Kurdistan range is approached.— (Picot, 1)94.) SUMAI (2)— A K idish village and tribe near Q 'rtur.

The district of Sunqur which commences at Gidakanu consists of two valleys that of the Gavehrud undulating and bare, showing a few villages, and large stretches of excellent corn land, and that of the Shajurud in which lies the town of Sangar, level, well-watered and covered with villages, gardens and plantations. There are said to be in this district, including hamlets m the mountains, 153 villages, of which 20 have a hundred houses and upwards. The average of the whole is about 30 houses. The people raise and export considerable quantities of graih, chiefly to Hamadin and the barren tracts beyond.

A large city the capital of Azarbaijan, situated on the left bank of the Aji Chai, it is 320 miles north-west of Tehran, 310. miles south-east of Erzerum, 490 miles south-east of Trebizond, and 320 miles south-south-east of Tiflis. Tabriz occupies much the same position in north-western as Meshed does in north-eastern Persia, and as the largest commercial emporium in Persia deserves detailed notice. It is situated at the extremity of an elevated plain, which is bounded on the south-west by Lake Urumieh and framed in a landscape of barren ranges of sandstone, whilst on the south rises the snow-covered cone of Mount Sahand. History. —Tabriz, the ancient Tauris, was probably an old city when it became the capital of Tiridates III, King of Armenia, in A.D. 297. Its ancient name was “ Ganzaka,” under which it was mentioned as long ago as the fourth century, and in the sixth it was captured by Heraclius. Little, however, is known about it till A.D. 791, when Zubaidah, wife of Harun-ul-Rashid, the fifth Caliph of the hous 3 of ’Abbas, beautified it so much as to obtain the credit of having been its founder. She is said to have called it Tabriz, “ fever-scattering,” from the salubrity of the climate. This origin of the name must, however, be dismissed without hesitation ; the real meaning of the word is warm-flowing from tab warm, tepid and rez, riz, resh, a verbal root meaning to flow, and originated from the hot springs in the neighbourhood. In A.D. 858, in the reign of Mutavakkil, the tenth Abbaside Caliph, the city was almost destroyed by an earthquake. In A.D. 1041 Tabriz was again levelled by an earthquake, and only those of the inhabitants escaped, who had listened to the warning voice of Abu Tahir, the astronomer of Shiraz, who, being at Tabriz, foretold the danger. In 1392 Timur took and sacked Tabriz, its then prince, Sultan Ahmad IlkhanI, flying at the approach of the great conqueror. After the decline of the house of Timur in the beginning of the fifteenth country, Tabriz fell und^r the sway of the Turkoman princes of the Qara Guyunti family, and Qara Yusuf, the second sovereign of that family, died at Ujan 35 miles south-east of Tabriz in 1420. In 1500 Isma’Il, the first of the Safavi kings, took Tabriz from the Turko mans ; but it remained under Persia only till 1522, when Sulaiman, the Sultan of Constantinople, made himself master of it, expelling Shah Tahmasp, who then made Kazvln his capital. Again it was abandoned by the Turks, , and again recovered in 1584 by Murad-bin-Sallm, or Amurath III, but won back to Persia by ’Abbas the Great in 1618, after his sanguinary victory at Shibli in which the Pashas of Van and Erzerum, and the flower of the TurkishTABRIZ 591 army, fell. In 1721 Tabriz was again in great part destroyed by an earth quake, aiid according to one writer, 80,000 persons perished. To add to this mi f7Xnr“ ants were attacked b 7 tke Turks under the Pasha of Van and 4,000 of the enemy effected a lodgment in the city, but, after a desperate struggle, were all put to the sword; nor was it till 1725 that the town was surrendered, after 20,000 Turks had fallen in battle before it. But the bultan had scant enjoyment of his new conquest, for in 1730 the invincible -Nadir came, saw, and conquered. Since its conquest by Nadir Shah, Tabriz remained in the hands of the Persians till it was taken by the Russians under Paskivitz in 1827. “It had, says Monteith, ‘ ‘ always been celerbrated for its patriotism and for the courage with which it had defended itself against the Turks and other enemies. The works, though not strong, had at this time been put in a state of defence, and consisted of a double wall and deep ditch, and there was also the reserved park of field artillery and gunners enough to man it; it was therefore perfectly capable of resisting everything but a regular siege ; the gardens by which it is surrounded afforded a position very favourable for opposing the advance of regular troops, and it is doubtful whether the whole of Pi'mce Paskivitz’s army would have been able to force tneir way to the town if the governor had he been an able man. But this unfortunately was not the case. The command of the place had been en- trusted tO-Ah Yar Khan—a Qajar nobleman unknown to the people or army oi i zarbaijan, and remarkable only for excessive vanity and pride. He was arrested and delivered up to the Russians, who at once seized on the citadel, wnich is situated at the southern side of the town, and is admirablv adapted to ke^p the city in subjection. Besides this, a number of the cap- tureagu s werey ypt constantly pointed by the Russians upon the town • am, a general Asaming &lt;pf the people took place, who were bewildered at tne step they had taken. General Paskivitz himself soon arrived, and on the day after his entrance held a general review of his army, consisting of twelve battalions of infantry, 7,000 ; two battalions guards, 1,2000 • one regiment of dragoons 600 ; three regiments of Uhlans, 1,200 ; 2,000 Cossack* irregular cavalry, Georgians and Muhammadans, 2,000 ; artillerv, 52 pieces • gunners, 1 , 000 , to which were immediately added a number of the Persian and eitw o£ E,,gli8h manufact ” 9 ° r T 898 e Ton/T K r - ed , t 0 7 ersia0n 00nclnsion of in February, 1828. Since 1905 Tabriz has been the capital of the heir apparent, having been first chosen for that purpose in the case of ’Abbas Mirza, the selected son ot h ath Ah Shah. In June 1908 the revolution against the Shah started at Tabriz, and was keptahveby the stubborn resistance this town offered to the royalists Two men Sattar Khan and Baghir Khan, were responsible for the resistance of the nationalists who, however, also had the assistance of Mr. Moore the correspondent of the “ Daily Telegraph.” Famine threatened to cause greats' losses than actual fighting. The arrival of Russian troops in April 1909 nominally in order to save Russian subjects from famine, put an end to th^ fighting, and marked the commencement of a Russian occupation of nzaiba.jan' which has continued uninterruptedly till the present day (1912). Russian permanent garrisons have been maintained at Tabria592 TABRIZ and Ardabil since 1909, and in 1912 there were at least 12,000 Russian troops in the province of Azarbaijan. In July 19H, when the ex-Shah landed at Gumesh Tappeh, the standard of revolt was raised in Azarbaijan by his lieutenant Shuja-ud-Dauleh. Mujallal-us-Sultaneh also tried to raise the Shahsavans in favour of Muham mad ’Ali. Shuja managed to collect a fairly large force at Sarab, and threatened Tabriz, surprising the Government camp on September 17th, 1911, and thus winning a minor victory ; but the royalists made no further headway in Azarbaijan. _ ‘ . In December 1911 the people of Tabriz, goaded into doing something by the presence of Russian troops in Tabriz, and by the cruel ultimatums recent ly presented by Russia, suddenly attacked some Russian troops in Tabriz, and inflicted heavy losses on them. The Russians took very strong retalia tory measures, by hanging numerous ‘ ‘ Fidais ’ ’ and nationalists, includ ing the Siqhat-ul-Islam, whose execution being carried out on the holiest day of the Muharram, caused widespread disgust among Muhammadans They also bombarded the famous citadel or “ ark ”, damaging it consider ably and destroyed the houses of those suspected of being anti-Russian. The Russians then took over the administration of Tabriz, including the police, treasury and justice. Shuja-ud-Dauleh, who had been threateni’ g Tabriz in the interests of the ex-Shah, was installed by Russia, contrary to the wishes of the Persian Cabinet, as Governor General of Azarbaijan, and he ruled the province with drastic severity atjhe dictation of the Russian Consul-General at Tabriz (M. Miller). In August 1912 Sipahdar, the Persian nominee for the post of Governor General of Azarbaijan, took over from Shuja at Tabriz, the Russians having withdrawn their opposition to him In September some prominent people of Tabriz drew up a petition, asking for the return of the ex-Shah, and forwarded it to the Government as well as to the Legations. This was not spontaneous ; bul was instigated by In 1913 it was reported that the agitation against the Government had waned and that the 9 agitators had returned to theii homes. Description .—In 1880 General Schindler reported the town as containing eight Imamzadehs, 318 mosques, 100 public baths, 166 caravans*rail* 3,92 l shops, 23 guard-houses, 5 Armenian chur hes and 25,614 private house?, but a good many of these figures represented fabrics, while the majority of the so-called mosques, are ekiehs, or public prayer places, so that the totals give an exaggerated impression of the present city. The town, as has been shewn in the historical retrospect, is much subject to earthquakes, and i is small wonder that the city contains few or no public buildings of any distinction and that the bulk of the houses are usually of one storey only, built round courts, on to which all the windows look. The city, therefore, that part occupied by bazaars and shops excepted, offers the appearance of a labyrinth of unpaved lanes, full of holes usually intersected by gutter, with mud walls on each side, varied only by narrow doors, and the arciied brick gateways of larger mansions. , “ The appearance of the mud walls of Tabriz arising out of and su - rounded by ruins, the prison-like houses which seldom exceed one storey, without a decent-looking window to enliven them ; the inelegantly BUapea domes, without a single Turkish minaret to relieve them; all exln iTABRIZ 593 a most monotonous effect, and combine in c, general coup d’oeil to impress the traveller with a very mean opinion of this city.” The buildings at Tabriz are far less striking than might have been expect ed in so famous a city. Close to the gate from which one passes to the Tehran road is a fine ruin, called the Kabud Masjid, or £ ‘ blue mosque. ” It is about 300 years old, and the blue tiles from which it gets its name are beautifully arabesqued. The streets of t^ie city are generally narrow and always unpleasant; in dry weather from the quantity of dust, and in wet from the deep mud. Eastwick describes them as narrow lanes, filled with holes, pits, ditches and filth, and adds, the houses are of mud, many of them reduced by the late rains to ruinous heaps ; and there is a close, dark and dirty bazaar roofed over with sticks, with mangy, miserable dogs, and more miserable mendicants, prow ling about. The villa of the Persian heir-apparent, who was usually governor of the province of Azarbaljan, is one of the best places in Tabr'z. It is approached through extensive courtyards, and is situated in the midst of a large garden. There is a small artificial pond in front of the villa. A kind of menagerie behind the villa provides for scientific recreation. The villa itself is a pleasing struc ture in a somewhat crumbling condition, with a pavilion crowned by a cupola, which is reached by a steep staircase. The halls are decorated in Persian style. The castle or ‘ e ark ” is a lofty structure, dating from the middle ages, but now a ruin. It is asserted that it was originally intended for a mosque, which ill-accords with its mighty walls. The latter attain a height of 120 feet, and a thickness of about 25 feet at the base. The castle has been ren dered famous by an historical event and by. a miracle. The first of these two occurrences is the military execution which took place in 1848 within its walls, when the prophet Bab, who wished to reform Islamism, and who nearly succeeded in driving the Qajar dynasty from the throne, was shot dead (1850). The second occurrence was that of a woman who, in accord ance with the judge’s verdict, was condemned to be thrown from the top of the fortress. No sooner was she hurled into open space than her dress kept her floating in the air, and she was gently deposited in the gardens of a house opposite. The arsenal is contained in the courtyard of the castle. The city extends round the castle in a wide circle. An inner wall, in a state of decay, en closes these portions of the city which are situated round the castle, whilst an outer wall, in a somewhat better condition, encircles the entire radius. The mass of verdure, seldom to be met with to so great an extent in Persia, imparts a cheerful aspect to the city, which, besides, is beautifully situated. It resembles an oasis in the midst of a great mountain wilderness. To the south is the snow-covered crest of the Sahand mountain, to the north-east is a splendid dark wall of rocks, whilst to the west the view extends over a wide, well-cultivated plain, as far as the jagged summit of the peninsula of Shahl, Lake Urumleh. Military .—The arsenal was said in 1894 to contain 12,000 Werndl, 2,500 Chassepot rifles and 2|- million cartridges, but this was greatly exaggerated. The cartridges had been in store 10 years, but looked serviceable. The dryness of the climate would preserve them for a long p eriod. 0300 GSB594 TABRIZ Colonel Picot, who made the above note in 1894, states that when inspecting the arsenal in that year he found a large quantity of ammunition ancient date belonging to equally ancient types of obsolete arms. The following guns were stored at Tabriz in 1894 :—nine 7 cm, three 8 cm. and four 9 cm. Euchatius guns as well as two native breech-loaders, but it was doubtful whether there was any ammunition for them. The troops sta tioned here consisted so far as could be ascertained of the following :— three battalions of infantry ; two squadrons of cavalry, and some artillery. These gave a nominal effective of 3,000 infantry, 400 cavalry and 1,000 gunners, though the actuals could not be more than a quarter of these num bers, if so many. According to Colonel Picot there were 150 government horses in Tabriz. It is not known what has happened to any of these arms and ammuni tion since the siege of Tabriz in 1909, though it is known that the Russians seized some in 1911. In 1903 it was reported that in Azarbaljan the actual number of troops under arms was 1,600 infantry, 250 cavalry, and 150 artillery. Of about 4 regiments under arms, out of a total of 25 said to be drawn from Azarbaljan 3 are usually under arms in Tabriz. In July 1912 a force of about 1,000 men was sent from Tabriz against the Shahsavans ; this would represent the maximum that it was possible to raise. Climate. —“Tabriz is celebrated as one of the most healthy cities in Persia, and it is on this ground alone that we can account for its being so often rebuilt, after its repealed demolition by earthquakes. It is seldom free, even for a twelve month, from slight shocks. The salubrity of this town is the more surprising from the great extremes of heat and cold to which it is subject. GenerabMalcolm, when there, obtained from a friend, who had resided there during a whole year, a most accurate diary of the various changes of its climate. From this it appears that £ on the 12th of October there was a heavy fall of snow, which did not, however, remain long upon the ground ; the weather again became mild, and there was no excessive cold until the middle of December, from which period till the end of January, Fahrenheit’s thermometer, when exposed to the air at night, never rose above zero, and in the house at mid-day it was seldom above 18°. “ January was by far the coldest month, during which the water is de scribed as becoming almost instantaneously solid in the tumblers upon the dining-table, and the ink often freezing in the inkstand, although the table was quite close to the fire. For at least a fortnight not an egg was to be had, all being split by the cold. Some bottles of wine froze, although covered with straw, and many of the copper ewers were split by the expan sion of the water when frozen in them. ‘ ‘ Of the heat that ensued, and the sudden and great changes to which Tabriz is subject, we had abundant proof ; in the month of June the range of the thermometer being usually, within the twenty-four hours 56° to 94 °— a difference of 38°. ” Fraser also remarks of the climate of Tabriz— “ Were I,” he says, “ to select a spot the best calculated for the recov ery of health, or for its preservation, I know not that I could hit upon anyTABRIZ 595 more suited to the purpose than Tabriz at this season, or indeed at any season. A brighter sky and purer air than those which the inhabitants of this town and its environs breathe and live under can scracely be found. To me it seems as if there truly was ‘ health in the breeze ’ that blows around me. In fact, the occasional excess of this breeze is about the only drawback here to comfort, so far as atmospheric influence is concerned for the temperature is delightful. The sun would be hot during the middle part of the day but that this breeze cools its ardour effectually ; and we must forgive the clouds of dust which it raises, even though they blind ard choke the unfortunates whom business forces to go out during the pre valence of the gale. “ During the months of June, July, and August the heat in the town itself is, no doubt, considerable ; but September relieves the inhabitants in part and October at times is actually cold. Both heat and cold are dry and wholesome, quite unlike the stifling alternations which render Tehran and its environs so unhealthy in summer ; and the evenings and mornings are at all times heavenly. ‘ £ The inhabitants of Tabriz, too, are blessed with the means of change of air more than most cities ; its neighbourhood abounds in delightful mountain abodes, where assuredly the air is of an unrivalled freshness and purity. About 25 miles southward in the mountains of Sahand, there is a village called Livan which gives its name to a pleasant valley, in which runs a fine clear mountain stream. Perhaps not the least recommenda tion of this retreat is the fine trout with which this stream is tolerably stored, and which afford both pleasant pastime and food to those who seek its banks ; and hither do the English residents often repair and pitch their tents in a climate as cool and bracing as that of the mountains of Scotland or of Wales. Then, in another direction there is the Chaman or natural pasture of Ujan, where the royal camp was wont to be pitched and where the brood mares of the prince are now kept ; and there is Sarab, an ele vated tract on the road to Ardabil, with its fine trout stream, and the noble highland district of Khalkhal and Miskin, if you wish to go further afield. In short, I look upon Tabriz to be the best situated, as it is in point of fact the first of Persian cities. The suburbs and gardens of Tabriz extend some miles round the city, and contain nearly as large a population and in the spring, the latter ap pearing like one sheet of blossoms, have a most refreshing appearance. They produce almonds, apricots, apples, pears, peaches, grapes, and some other fruits. Resources .—It is considered a good investment of money at Tabriz to buy a garden into which the purchaser sends gardeners in the spring to prune the vines and other trees, and put the place in order ; and then sells the expected produce for a certain sum, leaving the trouble of gathering and the chance of failure to the buyer. In general it answers well for both parties, the owner getting a high percentage for capital invested in it, and the buyer making a good profit on the fruit. Near the town, and along the foot of the hills, are several flourishing villages, and the land, being irrigated by numerous rivulets, is rendered fertile ; but the greater part of the plain is devoid of water, and is of596 ' TABRIZ p barren and sandy soil, so strongly impregnated with salt as to be almost incapable of cultivation. Twenty miles to the north-west of Tabriz is a fine mine of rock salt from which the town and district are supplied. Water .—Water is scarce in Tabriz, and the supply of the different parts of the town is in the hands of private individuals, who at their own expense have constructed aqueducts from springs at some distance for the supply of the town. They sell it for about 2 tumdns per annum per “ luleh”, stream of about the thickness of a man’s finger which the buyer opens from the main channel when he has occasion for it. He may purchase as many “lulehs ” as he likes, and regulate the size of his pipe accordingly. It is difficult, however, to say what is the average payment for water, as it depends on a multitude of cir cumstances—the dryness of the season, the quantity required and the agree ment with the owner. The value is continually fluctuating ; each buyer obtains his supply from the side of the main stream, and if payment is in any case withheld, the water is cut off from the whole street, much to the inconvenience and annoyance of those who do pay; though this seldom happens, as it is every man’s interest not only to be punctual himself, but also to see that his neighbour is so. It is, however, a never failing source of dispute, each party endeavouring to defraud the other as much as possible. Ussher says it is so precious that a stream one foot in width and an inch in depth is worth from £200 to £300 a year. Trade .—The great importance of Tabriz must be sought for in its com mercial position ; being the largest city in Persia, it is not only the centre of an imp rtant local traffic, but by its situation has become the emporium of European trade with Persia. There are two commercial highways from Europe to Persia, the one by Trebizond and Erzerum, the other by the way of Poti, Tiflis, and Erivan. The trade has declined by the Trebizond route since the opening up of Persia from Bushire. Tabriz no longer supplies all northern Persia. Some trade is however still retained by the English firms and English goods still maintain their ascendency in the market ; Russian goods compete with difficulty in some parts of Azarbaijan with those coming from Bradford and Manchester. Tabriz has always been the great centre of banking business for Northern Persia. The summer exports cause a great demand for Persian coin and a large exchange business is done. Bill transactions are negotiated here for Tehran, Khorasan, Isfahan and Shiraz, the whole of Northern Persia, and much busi ness is done in the buying and selling of drafts on Russia. The Imperial Bank of Persia, as well as the Russian Bank “ la Banque des Prets de Perse ” have branches here. The most influential representatives of European trade are the firms of Ziegler k Co., of Manchester, and a Greek firm; there is also an important Russian transport company. Two German Companies started trade here in 1912. The state of affairs at Tabriz amongst all these different nationalities was pacific ; for, although many individuals would have no intercourse with their neighbours, yet there were no clearly-defined hostile camps. The representatives of England and Russia at Tabriz enjoy a position of authority, in accordance with the power of their respective countries.598 TABKlZ It will be also gathered from these tables that exports from this portion of Persia continue to bear no comparison with imports :— Value. 1899-1900. 1900-01. £ £ Exports 316,304 649,415 r . Imports 723,174 1,204,069 The average rate of exchange on London bills during 1900-01 has been 52| krans per 11. sterling. Presen Exchange {1900-01). Population .—In 1881 General Schindler estimated the population at 164,630. Assuming an increase of ’9 per cent it should have reached 200,000 twenty years later (1901). The Europeans live in the Armenian quarter. Here are the Residencies of the Turkish, Russian, and British Consul-Generals, the last named having a charming and spacious house ; France also maintains a Consul at Tabriz, whose business it is to foster such trade as she may possess and to supervise the interests of the Catholic Nestorians, whom she has taken under her pro tection. There was once a Belgian Consul, but a sinecure so complete could only end in withdrawal. The United States have a Consulate here. In 1881 there were 2,892 Armenians in Tabriz. Tabriz is the residence of an Armenian bishop, whose diocese (called the Tabriz diocese) is divided in to several districts, the more important ones being Tabriz, Salmas, VurmI (Urumieh), Baranduz, Maragheh and Karadagh. The number of Armenians under the Tabriz bishop is about 25,000.— {Schindler.) The bazaars are about the same size as those of Tehran, but neither so well built nor so regular. Adjoining them are two fine caravansarais, one constructed by Haji Saiyid Husain, merchant, and another by his son-in- law, Haji Shaikh Qasim. There is also another not far distant, the Fateh ’All Beg caravansarai, which is tenanted by Georgian merchants, and usually called the Georgian sarai. These are the best in the city. There is a race-course prettily situated under a line of red hills about 3 miles from the town, on the AjI Chal plain, which is much patronized by both Europeans and Persians. The races sometimes attract as many as 20,000 people and the bazaars are sometimes closed on these occasions. In the streets, and bazaars of Tabriz Turkish is the only language spoken, and Persian is only understood among the better classes. 11. 1 Russian Imperial .. 1 Russian paper rouble 1 Turkish lira 1 francCommunication. —Postal and telegraphic communications are in a sadly neglected state ; and such is the nature of the Persian Post Office, that no house of commerce ever entrusts a letter to it; the whole of the correspond ence being carried on through the couriers of embassies and consulates. As for the Persian telegraph system, it seems chiefly to be employed in the distortion and delaying of telegrams ; and the Anglo-Indian telegraph, which passes through Tabriz, and has a station there, is unfortunately not allowed to transmit or receive any telegrams in Persia. There are Persian lines to Urumieh via Dilman, Bask Kaleh, via Turkish frontier, and to Sauj Bulagh.— {Schindler ; Curzon ; Picot; Wood.)

It formerly be longed entirely to Persia, but now the north part as far south as Astara be longs to Russia. It is well watered by numerous streams, which send their waters to the Caspian. It is divided into five or six different districts, each under a chief, who is virtually independent. The climate of Talish is extremely unhealthy, and all the inhabitants retire in the hot weather to their “ yailaqs ” in the mountains. The soil is remarkably fertile, and produces grain, tobacco, wine, cotton and silk. Monteith says the revenue of the Russian part is absolutely nothing, and Holmes says the Russian part pays 30,000 tumans from which, however, 14,000 are deducted for the maintenance of the con- tingerlts of the chiefs. History .—Talish was first taken possession of by the Russians at the invi tation of its chief, Mustafa Khan, who was at enmity with Agha Muhammad Qajar, and they sent a garrison to Lankuran. They were, however, driven out of this in 1812, but, returning next year, they on the 13th Jan uary 1813, assaulted the place with 2,000 men and three vessels of war and carried it after sustaining a loss of 1,200 men killed and wounded; among the latter of whom was the general, Kutlerous. Before the war of 1826 the Russians were attacked and driven out by Mir Husain Khan, son of Mustafa Khan, who maintained himself in the district till the end of the war, when it, as far as Astara, whs given over to the Russians by the treaty of Turkoman Chai. In 1912 the Russians wishing to place, as Governor of Persian Talish, a nominee of their own, whom the people disliked, sent a body of Russian troops and effected the appointment by force.— (Fraser', Monteilh ; Holmes.) Ethnography .—“ The tribes of Talish, which have ” says Fraser, “ several features of character in common with the Lasghis of Daghistan, unite many of the better qualities of highlanders with the barbarity of savages. Their country being more accessible, and their chiefs more under control than those of the Lasghis, they cannot be such systematic robbers, neither do they embark so regularly in the business of taking prisoners for sale or for ransom, which those formidable banditti practise; but property and life are not at all more sacred in their hands, for they are continually maraud ing among themselves, and plundering their immediate neighbours when ever they can. Murder, if is said, is an every-day crime with them, and no stranger would be safe for an hour in their country without the protection of their chiefs, or those whom their chiefs must obey.” “ These freebooters, however, are brave, and are devoted to their chiefs; they are active and patient of fatigue, but are treacherous, merciless andTALA—TALV 603 rapacious towards all the world beside. They have very few good qualities, and yet they are interesting from the many points of resemblance in their patriarchal or feudal economy to the Highlanders of Scotland, as they were in old times. There is, amongst these tribes, not only the same devoted attachment of clansmen to their chief but among that chief’s retainers one might discover the same description of attendant gillies, and henchmen, which constituted the followers of a highland laird. The rude firelock of the chief is borne in charge by one young man, while another takes care of his cloak, a third of his pipe. Others again are ready to assist his steps, or stand by his horse’s head, on occasions of danger or difficulty. Crowds of idle hangers-on stand before his window or lounge lazily about the doors, awaiting their lord’s appearance, and start into motion with the same springing activity, whenever he gives the signal for marching. “ But as the Highlands of Scotland are far outdone in height and diffi culty by the rugged mountains of Talish, so does the Talish mountaineer surpass the Scottish Highlander in the strength, ease, and agility with which he springs up the longest and most precipitous passes ; even the little boys dash up the steep faces of the hills after the straying cattle, astonishing by the facility, with which they move along the most danger ous places. The nature of the life and the active habits of these people have a great effect upon their general appearance. They are, for the most part, spare, raw-boned men, of robust though not tall frames, with counte nances not unlike the Highlanders of Scotland. Their dress consists of a large pair of trousers, made of coarse grey or dark brown stuff, reaching below the ankles ; and generally tied into the “ charuks, ” or shoes, which are nothing more than a leather sock drawn round the instep, and tied on by a thong passing many times round the ankles. These are madb to fit, or rather to draw very tight, and appear sufficient to guard the foot against the stones, while they fit so easily as to be very pleasant to the wearer, and enable him to move along at a great pace. The only vest they wear is a sort of a long tailed vest, fitted tight to the body the skirts of which are stuffed into the trousers, so that the bulk of the nether man greatly exceeds that of the upper parts. The head is covered by a sheepskin cap of red and black wool. About the waist these mountaineers wear a leathern girdle, from which suspends the formidable “ kamari,” or Gilani knife ; and over their shoulder they carry their matchlock, in the use of which they are very expert. The ammunition is carried in numberless rows of loops for cartridges on the breast of the vest and other parts of the person, or in small gourds called “ kaddus ” hollowed out to serve for powder horn, etc. In the hand is carried a basket of plaited grass, in which they stow provisions or plunder. Such is the complete portrait of a Talish highlander.” TALAM SIHSHAMBEH— A village 11 miles from Rasht on the road thence to Kazvln.— {Schind ler.)

The latter is t to but otherwise a good mule track ; hillside softish shale, road easily made. The peak rises 200 feet above pass. -{Bell, 1884.) TANG-I-DlNAVAR— A pass about 37 miles from Kirmanshah on the Tabriz road. It is en closed by inaccessible cliffs ; 800 to 1,000 feet in height. The defile ap pears to be 7 miles in length. From a distance the indentations of the two. flanks of the defile are seen to correspond exactly, each salient being opposed bv a re-entering angle of equal depth. On the left hand the strata are inclined at a sharp angle, appearing to have fallen away from the opposite mass by the subsidence of the earth's crust below. The Tang-i-Dinavar, though affording an excellent passage through a very impracticable mass of mountains, would be difficult to traverse m the face of anvdetermined opposition; its flanks for many miles being inaccessible, and, when accessible, so flanked by steep scarps as to be nearly impracticable to direct assault. A detour of about 20 to 30 miles from Dinavar east over a low pass, crossed with ease by horsemen and laden camels, to Sinneh, on the high road, turns this defile(xYapter.) TANG-I-KHALlJl— 4 defile two-thirds of a mile beyond Bijar, Kurdistan on the Tabriz- Kirmanshah road, The road is tortuous and the rock, which crops up freely, a hard limestone—(Aapter.) TANG-I-KHURNAWAZAN— . 4 defile some 24 miles from Kirmanshah, on the road thence to Smne , Kurdistan. It lies between the valley of Mian-i-Darband and the plain of Pusht-i-Darband.— {T. C. Plowden.) TANG-I-LAMBl—Kiev, 6,620'. ^ x __ _ A small pass about 7 miles from Gulpaigan on the road to Khunsar, the watershed .between the two valleys. For 50 yards oyer rock the path is only a mule-path, but improves into a 15-foot road in the Khunsar valley One of the sources of the Ab-i-Qum passes through this gorge ; it is here a small stream 8 feet wide in a deep bed, crossed about 1 2 miles from the defile by a single-arched bridge of 18 feet span. (Bell, 188i.) TANG-I-MILLEH MURVAIUD— known also as Mailawara, Malavprd and MilaMawarI. _ _ _ , A defile in Kurdistan running north and south between Kamyaran and Quragh on the Kirmanshah-Sinneh road, through an outlying spy of the PaZ hills. It is 6 or 7 miles long, and is 8 miles from Kirmanshah. The606 TANGIM—TANGIS hills through which it passes are bare and brown with no trees or cultivation. —(Plowden ; Rabino, 1907; Schindler.) TANG-I-MIRSHIKAK— A narrow gorge, 80 to 100 yards long, about 6 | miles beyond Flruzkuh, on the road from Tehran to Shahrud through that place. Cliffs 200 to 300 feet high shut in the gorge.— (Napier.) tang-i-nasIrabad— A gap in th; ridge of Aq-Tagh on the southern frontier of Azarbaijan through which the Tabrlz-Kirmanshah road passes. The gap is 300 to 400 paces in length, and is commanded by steep but accessible h-ights.— (Napier.) TANG-I-SAR-DARREH— A pass or defile on the Tehran-Meshed road, between the villages of Aiwan-i-Kif and Qishlaq, over a south spur of the Elburz range. This defile presents an excellent defensive position, more especially at its entrance and its exit; at the latter it is only a pistol-shot in width. But it might easily be turned, the only difficulty in doing so being want of water, which would have to be carried for one day’s consumption. It is entered at 5| miles from Aiwan-i-Kif; it is there very narrow and was guarded by two small forts, now ruined. A stream of brackish water flows through it towards Khar. After heavy rains the stream is very deep and unfordable, and in the spring of 1885 caravans could not pass for three days. The length of the defile is five miles; 2| miles from the entrance, where the valley is widest, in a little stony plain, stands the ruin of a caravan- sarai constructed of solid masonry. Close to it is a cistern of rain water, and there was formerly a small village. This pass is usually identified as the Caspian Gates, the pass through which Darius fled to Bactria after his defeat by Alexander at Arbela. The distance of the Caspian Gates from Rai is given by the Greek geog raphers as 500 stadia in round numbers, the actual distance from Rai to the centre of the pass being 56 miles—190 stadia. These Caspian Gates have been described in detail by Greek and Roman authors and much has been written to prove that this pass is and is not identical with them. Lord Curzon after giving arguments for and against, i thus sums up. “ On the other hand it is quite credible that the passes of Pliny, Della Yelle, Herbert, and Rawlinson may not be the same Caspian Gates through which Darius fled and Alexander marched; and that there may be more than one claimant to the title. This is on the whole the most probable solution, the Sar Darreh defile in the opinion of the most learned critics corresponding more accurately to the account of Arrian, cf. also Quintius Curtius and Marcellinus, than does any pass to the north or east. It cannot however to my mind conceivably be identified with that of Pliny, nor is it likely to have been the Caspian Pylar, to which so much geo graphical importance was attached by Strabo.”— (Ferrier; Schindler; Cur zon.)TANGIS—TANGIT 607 TANG-I-SHAPtR— A gorge a few miles east of Fulad-malialleli.— {Lovett.)

TANG-I-SHURAB— A gorge in Mazandaran, on the north of the valley of Sar-i-Tang (q. v.).— {Lovett.) TANG-I-SHUVAN—Elev. 5,350'. Two villages situated on the Zabarl plain, Kirmanshah, at the south west entrance to the pass of Tang-i-Shuvan. The road from Harunabad to Kirmanshah passes between the villages, which stand about \ mile apart. Below is a small area of walled vineyards fringed with poplars, and some orchards. A fair stream issues from the pass and there are also a number of springs. The plain is cultivated and contains good grazing : many thousands of goats and sheep pasturing on it in summer. The mountain range of Kurkur, which bounds the plain immediately behind Tang-i-Shuvan, contains much oak scrub, the remnants of former forests. The village to the south of the road is the property of the Vakil-ud-Dauleh, Haji ’Abdur Bahim of Kirmanshah, and contains 50 houses; that to the north, of 40 houses, is partly owned by him. The inhabitants are Kalhur Kurds, they own large numbers of sheep and goats and some herds of cattle, also a fair area of cultivated land.— {Burton.) TANG-I-SHUVAN (pass of)—Elev. 5,550'. Immediately to the north-east of the Villages of Tang-i-Shuvan an out lying parallel spur of the Kurkur range, which here bounds the Zabari plain, is pierced by a narrow gorge; the road from Harunabad to Kirman- shah passes through it at 12f miles from the former place. The bed of the pass is 50 yards wide and through it flows the stream, draining the valley to the north-east. The stony hills rise steeply to either hand to points | mile apart and 500 feet above the stream. The road through the pass is good : the gradient easy and the length traversed 300 yards. In the valley beyond the north-east exit is room for camping; wood, water and good grazing : a footpath to the Mahidasht plain crosses the Kurkur main ridge ; to the south-east runs the pass practicable for laden animals, which crosses the same ridge at the Mil path to the Mahidasht plain. The Tang-i-Shuvan path cannot be turned in the immediate vicinity, but the Kurkur range is crossed a few miles to the north and south by various passes practicable for laden animals, notably the Aliwar, 4 miles south-east, which is the road by which the Persian artillery marches to the main road (Kirmanshah- Baghdad) at Harunabad.— {Burton.)

The Kirmanshah main route and telegraph line join the Sultanabad- Burujird road at entrance of the defiles. The Turoh stream flows under the Kuh-i-Sagvar. The defile is 2 miles long and ends at the village of Tureh.— {Bell, 1881.)

See sub Hecatompylos.— (Schindler.) TAQ-I-BUSTAN—Sometimes called £ Tak-I-Bostan,’ or “ Tak-i-Vastam.” Taq-i-Bustan consists of a beautiful garden surrounding a monument and is situated about 6 miles east of the city of Kirmanshah, 4 miles north of the road at the foot of the Surkhalijeh mountains. From the mountains issue five springs, wTiich are collected into two tanks or reservoirs, each 121 paces square, built by ‘ Imad-ud-Dauleh, a former Governor of Kirmanshah. Over the springs a magnificent house or villa is erected, which belongs to Vakil-ud-Dauleh, and consists on the ground floor of a large vault, under which there is a small tank, from which in winter great volumes of water gush out and flow into the reservoirs. The scene is very picturesque when the reser voirs are full, and the place is a faA'ourite holiday resort for the people of Kirmanshah and the neighbouring villages. But it is very desolate in summer, when the reservoirs are empty. On the rock adjacent to the villa a large recess about 50 feet high has been cut. In the lower half of this recess there is a statue of Rustam carved out of the solid rock and projecting about a yard. The figure represents the giant on horseback, with a spear in his hand. In the upper half of the recess is a similar statue of King Khusrau, with that of his Wazir Parvlz to his right and Queen Shir'n on his left. These are excellent works of art, and are ail C300GSB610 1 TAQ-I-GIREH cut out of the solid granite. The height of these statues is 12 feet, and they project 3 feet from the rock. ’Imad-ud-Dauleh had steps cut in the rock leading over the arches to a plat form called the Nigareh Khaneh, whilst others branch off and lead higher up the rocks. * There are a few houses containing a population of about 30* families of Kalhurs, Kurds of Kurdistan, and Mumavand Lakks. Malidt 200 krdns cash and 9 kharwcrs grain. Taq-i-Bustan is a village of the Vastam district, and is divided into 3 hamlets namely:—Taq-i-Bustan; Murad Hasil, and Chiah Kabud. The Ab-i-Taq-i-Bustan has its rise here ; of four streams composing it, one joins the Kara Su, and the others are used for irrigation purposes .—(Yusuf a Sharif; Vaughan; Rabino, 1907.) taq-i-gireh— . A small village situated on the summit of the pass of the same name in the Kirmanshah district. There are 16 or 17 houses of the ’Ali Illahis at Taq, but no supplies. TAQ-I-GIREH (pass.)—.Elev. 4,280'. Sometimes Tak-i-Gerreh. The name is derived from “ Taq ”=arch and “ Gireh”, the name of one of Khusrau’s officers, a name which frequently occurs in old Kurdish legends. This pass is said to be the ancient “ Gate of Zagros.” The pass of Taq-i-Gireh is on the old road from Zuhab to Kirmanshah. The ascent from the north west side commences about 2| miles from the Khan of Sar-i-Pul-i-Zuhab, and is rather laborious over a zigzag and very rough road formed of loose masses of fallen rock and large boulders of stone, like gigantic pebbles. The slope on the road may be 20 °, and in its present state it is certainly ill-adapted for the passage of either troops or artillery. A little labour and expense would, however, place it in an efficient state. The ascent of the most difficult part of the pass occupies exactly an hour from the Bishiveh plain. Quitting the angular turns, which it takes on the ascent of the pass, the road enters the narrow defile or gorge, which severs the higher range of Mount Zagros from the lofty crest of the Band-i-Nuah chain. This chain is the most westerly of the Persian mountains, and forms the great barrier between the alluvial plains of Assyria, east of the Tigris, now termed Traq-i- 5 Arab! and the mountainous districts of Persia. The scenery at this point becomes grand ; on either hand the dark foliage of the oak overspreading the sides and summits of the mountains, is here and there relieved by a bare abutting crag. The road continues to ascend through the gorge in a general direction of 130°, until it arrives at the village and Khan of Sur- khadizeh, whence it proceeds over a very rough road, so narrow at times that caravans are compelled to proceed in single file. In two hours it arrives at the ruins of the fort of Sar-i-Mil, anciently called Tur. From Surkhadizeh to this place the general bearing is 135°. Thence to Karind is over a plain.” This pass bears the traces of Khusrau Parviz. At the foot there is a caravan- sarai built by him, now (1834) ruinous, but remarkable, for being wholly covered in, a mode of building these edifices, for the most part, unusual inPersia And about hr If way up, there is an arched recess called the Taq-i- Khnsrau, or Taq-i-Gireh, built of marble slabs of large size, and the orna ments of which, though very much defaced, are quite m the style attribute o this kng For details of this arch seeKabino’s “Gazetteer of Kirmanshah. On the occasion of Nasr-ud-Dln Shah’s journey to Karbala the Persian engineers under Gastaiger Khan, who had been told to repair the road b ndoned the old Sassanian road and adopted a new route much inferior to the old one.—(Fraser, 1834; Rawlinson; Rabino, 1907.)

TARUM— A district of Azarbaijan, Persia, situated on both banks of heKizilUzun and between the Elburz and the Masuloh ranges. Tarum is divided into two districts; the upper division, which occupies a narrow tract on the right bank of the Kizil Uzun between the river and the mountains, is named Tarum-i-Khalkhal; the lower a more open country, where the hills recede farther from the river is called Tarum-i-pain. The district on the left bank of the river, stretching up to the other range of mountains is named Pusht-i-Kuh, and though now usually included in Tarum is not considered properly to belong to it. Tarum-i-Khalkhal contains about a hundred villages, situated among the ravines and narrow valleys which run down from the mountains to the river. It is abundantlv watered and possessing a very warm climate, is well adapted to the cultivation of cot ton, which it produces in large quantities. There are a great number of gardens and orchards also round all the villages, and the fruit which is thus grown, forms one of the staple articles of export. In the moun tains, too, there are mines of salt and alum that are considered of some value. The chief place in Tarum-i-Khalkhal is Vanisard, a large village distant about one mile from the river, considerably below the point where the road from Zmjan to Gdan crosses it. Tashwish, upon the skirts of the hills, near \anisard, is also a place of some consequence. A very small proportion of the villages remain in the hands of Government ; by far the greatest part have either been conferred in t'ul upon the proprietors or have been given in lieu of pay to the officers of the court.

A large town, capital of the province of Tehran and of the Empire of Persia j it is situated 270 miles south-west of Astrabad, 471 miles west-south west of Meshed, 672 miles west-north-west of Herat, 677 miles north of Bushire, 510 miles north-west of Sh'raz, 224 miles north of Isfahan, 500 miles north-west of Baghdad, and 290 miles north-west of Kirmanshah. Description. —The city, as it existed in the time of Nasir-ud-Dm, was planted in the very lowest part of a desert plain with few or no suburbs, and consisted of a fortified polygon of four or five miles exterior circuit, surrounded by an embattled mud wall twenty feet high, flanked with cir cular towers and defended by a moat forty feet wide and twenty to thirty feet deep. This wall was in parts ruinous and the ditch clumsy and broken down. There were six gates admitting into the city where the streets were narrow and filthy, and where the only building of any pretensions was the citadel. This contained the Divan Khaneh-i-Shah, the royal palace. Beyond the city walls the country palace of Path ’AH Shah, Qasr-i-Qajar, was the sole object that relieved the monotony of the plain, the one noble feature in the landscape being the snow-clad heights of Damavand soaring loftily over all. The British Mission was situated in the southern part of the city; the Russians at first occupied a house in a different quarter, but when their Minister was assassinated in 1828, they moved for greater security into the precincts of the citadel. In 1870 Nasir-ud-Din started the renovation of his capital. The old walls and towers were for the most part pulled down, the ditch was filled up, a large slice of the surrounding plain was taken in, and at a distance of a full mile from the old enclosure a new rampart was constructed copied from the fortifications of Paris before the German war. There is no masonry in this rampart, and not a single gun is mounted ; its principal service consists in facilitating collection of octroi duty. Tehran has now an enceinte, on a European plan, of 11 miles, with 12 gates con sisting of lofty archways adorned with pinnacles and towers and present- in 0- a showy appearance from a distance. Inside the walls the city is a curious mixture of Oriental and Western ideas ; there are metalled and watered roads, tramways (of which there are 6 | miles of the same gauges as the Shah ’Abdul ’Azlm railway, and railway trucks run on it from the station), and gasworks, and alongside these are to be seen the usual Persian mud hovels ; to use Lord Curzou’s expressive words —Tehran is becom ing “ Europeanised upon Asiatic lines.” In the northern part of the new town outside the line of the old walls is situated the Tup Maidan, the principal public place of Tehran, so-called because it is surrounded by the artillery barracks and contains a park of obsolete guns. Its most distinctive features are the gateways by which the square is entered or left; the two principal ones are the Nasirieh Gate at the south-east corner and the Daulat Gate at the south-west corner, over which the imperial standard floats when the Shah is in Tehran. Two other maiddns are worthy of notice, the Maidan-i-Mashq or parade, and the Maidan-i-Shah outside the Ministry of War which contains a large tank, and a colossal brass gun, known as the cannon of pearls, of a semi-sacred character.61G TEHRAN From the Tup Maidan, two streets or avenues, for they are planted with poplars, run m a northerly direction towards the outer walls The more westerly of the two known as the Khlaban-i-Daulat contains the residences of the representatives of several foreign powers. The British Legation themTlf ^ m Stre6t and ^ the m ° St im P osin g and spacious of Possibly the most interesting portion of Tehran is the a h or citadel a ^ pa n C - e near ! y a c l uarter of a mile square on the southern side of the Tup Maidan. Since the demolition of the old town th^re is nothing to identify this enclosure with a citadel, and it is now noting but a vast collection of gardens, courts and buildings belonging to the ?o V al palace. Entering from the Khiaban-i-Almasleh and crossing a courtyard the visitor enters another and larger courtyard, the entire upper end of which is occupied by a handsome building, containing the Talar or throne room, where is the Takht-i-Marmar or marble throne on which the Shah sits and displays himself to the public on certain special occasiors, parti cularly at the festival of Nau Ruz or New Year. A passage from the court yard of the Talar leads mfo another and larger courtyard where the main and state entrance to tr.e palace. It was under a threshold opening out of the arcade between the two, that Agha Muhammad Khan deposited^ the bones of Nadir Shah and Karim Khan, so that he might trample on them when going in or out. Irom here a a staircase leads up to the state apartments • at the top is the Shah s Library and Museum. In the museum are all the royal regalia, amongst which may be mentioned a globe made of gold and jewels valued at £ 947,000, crowns of former kings, and a modern throne made by Agha Muhammad Khan fro n the remains of the celebrated pea cock throne which he extracted from Shah Rukh, Nadir Shah’s grandson. On the other side of the top of the staircase is a room sometimes called the Council Chamber, where stands the Takht-i-Taus or peacock throne. This is not the peacock throne brought by Nadir Shah from India but a throne made by Path ’Ali Shah. Lord Cufzon, after a careful investigation of all the facts and contempo rary records, gives the following account of the celebrated Peacock Throne of the Great Mogul. Nadir Shah brought it from India, and had an exact duplicate of it made from other jewels. Thus there were two thrones one of which was destroyed by the Kurds who plundered Nadir’s Camp after he was murdered, the other was taken by Agha Muhammad from Shah Rukh at Meshed, and converted into the modern throne mentioned as being in the Museum. Beyond this room run a series of other apart ments, which look out upon the Gulistan or rose-garden, consisting of paved walks, flower beds and tanks, and extensive lakes, all planted with pines, cypresses, plane and poplar trees. On the eastern side of the Gulistan rises the Shams-el-Tmarat (sun of the palace), built in the form of two towers s oping inwards towards the top, and terminating in two kiosques, a slender clock-tower with a European clock rising from the roof between the two. At the further extremity of the Gulistan is the royal theatre, which consists of a great rotunda from the top of which rise the great arched and iron- bound traverses of the roof over which awnings are stretched when the play is acted in the heat of the day.TEHRAN 617 Amongst tlie mosques, which, however, are few in number, may be notic ed the Masjid-i-Shah, built by Fath ’Ah Shah, the Masjid-i-Madar-i-Shah and the Madrasseh-i-MervI. But the finest building is the Masjid-i-Sipah Salar (mosque of the Commander-in-Chief). This mosque was begun by Mirza Husain Khan, and after his death (in comparative exile as Gov ernor General of Khorasan) finished, with the endowments bequeathed by him, by his brother Yahia Khan. The bazaars of Tehran occupy a considerable space in the old town, the main entrance is from the street opposite the Shams-el-Tmarat. The ba zaars are vaulted throughout with a succession of low brick domes, and open frequently into small squares. They contain a number of well-built caravansarais, and there are few objects that cannot be procured. There is a race-course outside the city, and Tehran boasts an annual race-meeting. Amongst other buildings of interest are the Nigaristan built by Fateh ’Ali Shah formerly outside the walls, but since the enlarge ment of the town by the late Shah, within the walls. Outside the city walls are situated the Qasr-i-Qajar {q.v.), the palaces at Sultanabad and Sulaimanleh or Kara] {q.v.), and several other country residences mostly situated on the hill slope known as Shamran, a cultivated belt extending for about 20 miles along the base of the Elburz range. History .—Tehran though modern as a capital, is, however, old historically. Whatever its origin, it must have been for a long time small and insignifi cant. General Schindler thinks the origin of the name may be from the plural of iiV, a plain, meaning therefore the plains in contradistinction to shamran plural of shamr, a mountain in which water is stored up for the supply of the plains ; every drop of Tehran water comes from the Sham ran hills, and this has always been the case, hence Tehran may mean the plains in contradistinction to Shamran the hills. The earliest historical men tion of Tehran is in the pages of Abu ’Abdullah Yakut, A. D. 1179-80, who says that some trustworthy men told him that the houses in Tehran are con structed underground and that no one could enter the place without the permission of the inhabitants. The people have several times rebelled against the King, and the inha' itants of the 12 wards into which the place is divided are continually fighting one another. It is described by Hamdullah in the 14th century as a town of some size and importance. Shah Tahmasp, the second of the Safavl dynasty, seems to have been the first to favour it with royal patronage, but ’Abbas the great having fallen ill there, vowed he would never enter it again ; by him the province and city were placed under a Khan. Uoder the later Safavi monarchs, Tehran was sometimes the residence of the court ; it was taken and pillaged by the Afghans', but is mentioned by Hanway in 1744. Nadir Shah convoked a meeting of all the priests of religion at Tehran, on his return from India, with a view to promulgat ing a national religion. Karim Khan Zend added to and altered the existing citadel, but did not often occupy it. With the rise of the Oajar dynasty at the close of the 18th century the first epoch of the city’s political ascendancybegan. When Agha Muham mad began to find his dream of a Pan-Iranian kingdom capable of reali sation, he selected Tehran as the site of his capital, and its elevation to the G300GSB618 TEHRAN rank of Capital of Persia is usually dated from 1788, A. D.; Agha Muham mad, however, did not do much for the city. Oliver who was there the year of his death, reported the city as being little more than two miles in circuit with a population of only 15,000, of whom 3,000 belonged to the court and army. Under the rule of Path ’Ali Shah, who had larger ideas, it increased in size and population until when visited by Ouseley and Morier it contained 12,000 houses and 40,000 to 60,000 inhabitants; it remained of about this size for the first 70 years of the last century until it experienced an entire renovation at the hands of the late Nasir-ud-Din Shah. Tehran being the capital of Persia, is connected with most of the historical events of the country, but these need not be chronicled here ; only local events will be mentioned. In 1906 a majlis or National Assembly was convoked by Muzaffar-ud-DIn. His son Muhammad ’Ali tried to abolish it, and actually destroyed the building in which it assembled by bombardment. He quelled two rebellions ; but on July 13th, 1909, the nationalists entered Tehran, and the Shah took refuge in the Russian legation. The Shah was then deposed and constitu tional government, with Sultan Ahmad Mirza the ez-Shah’s son as Shah under a Regent, Was recommenced. It lasted till December 1911, when owing to the uncompromising attitude of the majlis to the Russian ultimatums, it was dissolved by the Regent on the advice of ehe cabinet. Since then it has not been possible, owing to disturbances, to arrange for fresh elections. On July 18th 1910, the principal Mujtahid was murdered in Tehran, and on August 1st several counter murders took place. On August 7th orders were issued to disarm every one ; but 300 ‘ Fidals ’ refused to surrender their arms. On being surrounded and bombarded by about 1,000 troops, they surrendered. Their two leaders, Baghir Khan and Sattar Khan, were among those captured. In July 1911 the ex-Shah Muhammad ’Ali entered Persia. The Majlis immediately voted 100,000 tumdns for his capture dead or alive. Tehran was apparently one of the few places, where his return w T as not desired by the inhabitants, but, as a precaution, martial law was proclaimed on July 22nd. A few days later 500 Bakhtiari and 500 “ reformed ” cavalry with some ‘ volunteers ’ started off to oppose him. For details of his adherents’ progress in Azarbaijan, Mazandaran, and Kirmanshah see articles under those provinces. In October 1911 occurred the Shua’a-us-Saltaneh incident, which afforded Russia an excuse for demanding the dismissal of Mr. Shuster, treasurer general. The Russian ultimat ms brought about the resignation of the whole cabi net except two, and also the closure of the majlis. On December 1st 1911, owing to feeling against Russia, several parti sans of that country were murdered in Tehran. Climate .—Many objections have been raised to Tehran as a capital main ly on sanitary grounds. It is urged that there is no river, and that water has to be brought from the Elburz in hmdts ; that situated in the hollow of the plain the infiltration of surromiding moisture causes malarial fever, and that the drainage is bad. Lord Curzon replies to these objections as follows :—“Most Persian rivers are little better than streamlets for the great er part of the year, consequently the absence of a river is no great faultTEHRAN 619 the city is situated at an altitude of over 3,800' and the climate for the greater part of the year is delightful, whilst in summer there is an easy and rapid retreat to the mountain slopes.” w Mean normal observation at Tehran, extracted from the Reports of he Meteorological Department of the Government of India up to end of 1902. f ' Month.

Besides the official European element, diplomats, officers of the Tele graph Department, foreign officers employed in the Persian Army and a few other Government officials, there are a goodly number of other Europeans, speculators, small traders, etc., and chevaliers d’industrie; the total Euro pean population at the time of Lord Curzon’s visit being estimated at 500. Resources. —Water is brought from Elburz in kanats. Grain is grown in large quantities round Tehran ; but the land is mostly Government property, and cabinet ministers find it an easy source from which to “ feather their nests.” The result has been that, owing to this monopoly and the consequent forcing up of prices, “ bread riots ” are a common occurrence in Tehran. In 1912 the Treasurer General took over the administration of Government crops, and also commenced a system of Government bakeries for supplying bread to the townspeople. There is little detailed information about the resources of Tehran, either the town or province. The chief products are rice, sugar, cotton and fruits. Among fruits the grape is largely cultivated, and some good wine produced :620 TEHRAN it is not, however, exported. (See under Mazandaran.) For Consular Trade report of the Caspian Provinces (1909-1911) see under “ Rasht. ” Military .—In the reign of Nasir-ud-Hin there was a small cartridge fac tory in Tehran, under the supervision of a Monsieur Horwart, established as a branch of the Arsenal. This factory could turn out from five to ten thousand cartridges per diem, and Monsieur Horwart declared that at a pinch double this number could be turned out. The cartridges were sold to civilians or Government by the contractor. Sine? the accession of Muzaffar-ud-Din, this institution suffered from neglect and w T as closed in 1899, but the workmen are still paid by Government and employed on other work, and so it might possibly be re-opened. The machinery is very dirty, and a considerable sum would be required to put it in proper working order. General Weth comment ing on the state of the plant said that as neither Cossacks or Persians fired a single cartridge from year’s end to year’s end there was no need for a cartridge factory at all, but this, however, is a coloured exaggeration. The Military College of Dar-ul Fanf.n was started at Tehran in 1850,’ and after a chequered existence was remodelled by the Russian officers Weth and Felmar, under whose direction it has become a recognised train ing ground for military cadets. The students number nominally 75 ; thirty for the artillery and forty-five for the infantry, they consist of Tur’s and Persians, and enter at the age of fourteen after passing a very elementary examination. They receive one free meal a day, two suits of uniform and a small salary varying from twelve to fifty tumdns per annum. A sum of 27,000 tdmdns is annually siet aside for this institution. The curri culum embraces the following subjects :—For infantry :—Tactics, for tification, surveying, military exercises and science of arms. For artil lery :—Science, drawing and military exercises. Civilian classes also were formed for the study of geology, medicine, mathematics, Persian, Arabic, French, English, Russian, music, physics and geography. A complete course lasts eight years, but though the instruction is good the interest taken by the students in their work is greatly discounted by the fact that there is no guarantee of employment, and a considerable percentage of the stu dents fail to obtain their commissions after passing through the army course. This was changed in 1910, under the scheme of reorganization. General Weth, one of the professors, remarks, “ Since the accession of Muzaffar-ud-Din, the military college like all other institutions has fallen into decadence. The school has not been paid for three years and the Naiyir-ul-Mulk, the director, has had to meet most of the expenses out of his own pocket. The school was entirely closed from May to October 1899, when it was partially re-opened. The work and prestige of the school has suffered greatly and both pro fessors and students are turning their attention to other means of earn ing their living. It has of late years been almost impossible to find young men of sufficient instruction to follow the usual course of study, and many of the classes have had to be abandoned. The discreditable state of the army does injury to the school, in that it has under present conditions no need of properly trained officers.TEHRAN 621 The Nasirl College, another military school, was founded by His High ness the Nalb-es-Saltaneh, third son of the late Shah, when he was Corn- man der-in-Chief, to show his interest in military matters. There was no practical work ever done, and the college ceased to exist on the retirement of its founder at the death of Nasir-ud-Dln Shah. Tehran is the headquarters of the Cossack Brigade. In October 1911 there were about 820 of the “ reformed ” army in the capital, and about 1,000 Bakhtiari. The latter were supposed to draw pay from the Government, but to remain under the orders of their own chiefs. In 1912 the Persian Army had to all intents and purposes ceased to exist. Police and Gendarmerie .—In May 1911 there were said to be 1,200 police in Tehran, some armed with Lebel carbines and some with Werndl carbines. There were also 300 gendarmes armed with Lebel carbines, half of whom were mounted. In 1911, arrangements were made to raise and train a force of gendarmerie, headquarters at Tehran, for service throughout the country. Swedish offi cers for this task arrived in Teharn on August 15th. The treasury gen darmerie were merged into the new T force ; and a school of instruction started at Tehran. By December 1912 there were about 1,000 trained gendarmes in Tehran. In March 1913 3 Swedish officers arrived to take over the organization of the civil police ; but owing to certain difficulties they were unable to com mence work before the 10th of April. Advantages as Capital .—But it is on political grounds that Tehran is the best site for a capital in Persia. It is 500 miles from the north-west fron tier, if Russia invades from that side ; and if Russia invaded from the Caspian, the line of the Elburz gives an excellent line of defence. If on the other hand Russia invaded from the north-east, the Shah could meet the invasion better from Tehran than from Isfahan. But it is owing to its central position, commanding routes to the most valuable prov inces of the kingdom, that Tehran is so admirably situated. It is half way between Meshed and Tabriz and so is able to command the provinces of which they are the centres, and is in easy supporting distance of the northern maritime provinces. Lastly, it stands as a sort of advanced outpost to the older capitals of Shiraz and Isfahan whither, in case of disaster in the north, the court might fall back. Foreign Representatives .—Turkey has an ambassador at Tehran ; the following powers, viz., Great Britain, Russia, France, Germany, Austria- Hungary, Italy, Holland, Belgium and the United States have resident ministers. The foreign legations have their summer residences on the slopes of the Elburz Range. The British at Gulahak (q.v.) ; the Russians at Zarghandeh ; and the Turks and Germans at Tajrish. Others rent places yearly in neighbouring villages. Communications .—The Indo-European Telegraph line runs from the Russian frontier at Julfa to Tehran via Tabriz, Mianeh Zinjan and Kazvin, while the lines of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, Indian Gov ernment, run to Bushire via Isfahan and Shiraz and to Baluchistan, where they join the Indian system via Yazd, Kirman and Bam,622 TIA—TIJ Persian railways are as follows. 1 . Local line round Tehran, with six stations. 2. To Khaniqin (Turkish frontier) 437 miles, via Hamadan and Kirman- shah, with branches (a) Hamadan-Burujird thence to Nihavand with branch line Daulatabad-Sultanabad. (b) Hamadan-Sinneh via Kirwah with branch to Bijar in Garus. 3. To Meshed, 531| miles, via Samnan, Shahrud and Sabzawar, with branches— (a) Mehshed-Darreh via Kalat-i-Nadirl. (b) Meshed-Kuchan via Chinaran. (c) Meshed-Bujnurd. (d) Meshed-Sarakhs connected with the Bussian system in the bed of the Hari-Rud. (e) Meshed-Sistan in course of construction. (/) Saman-Firuzkuh. (&lt;/) Shahrud-Astarabad-Meshed-i-Sar with a branch Barfarush-Amul. 4. To Enzali via Kazvln with a branch, Kazvin-Astara. There is a good carriage road from Tehran to Rashn or Enzali on the Caspian via Kazvin. In May 1912, the Russians employed a section of an automobile company, consisting of 4 motor lorries and one light car, from Enzali to Kazvin, in carrying supplies, ammunition, and passengers. The light car was driven also from Kazvin to Tehran. From Kazvin there is a good and much frequented caravan route to Tabriz and thence to Julfa on the Russian frontier. There is a carriage road in fair order from Tehran to Qum and thence on to Isfahan by a very fair track. With the exception of the two roads to Rasht and Qum all the other routes leading from Tehran are the usual Persian tracks. But there are chapdr stations along most of them, where riding ponies can generally be obtained.

The ore is verv rich and abundant. About the same distance north are coppei mines 'which have been worked, but, owing to want of funds and propel management, the produce is insignificant.— URIAD— . . , .... A district of Azarbaljan, comprising the mountainous tract between the Mian eh river north and the Kibla Kuh south. It is principally known on account of the rich lead mines in it. These mines have never been regularly worked. A thin vein of very rich grey lead ore extends through a hard schist ro k close to the surface for nearly 6 miles, never distant more than a few inches below, but not yet found to extend much beyond that depth. This yields in a common forge 70 per cent. The hills round are covered with a low brushwood fit for charcoal, and the borders of the river supply a considerable quantity of willow and other light wood. —(Monteith ; Rawlins on.) URUMIEH (Lake)- , ^ -n - • Although-this is the usual name on maps the Persians call it Dana-i- Shahi or royal sea ; it is the Kapauta of Strabo. The lake is 81 miles long by between 20 and 30 wide, nearly 300 in circumferenee, and is sit a ted 4*100 feet above the sea. There is a considerable variation in the a co nts as to whether the lake is increasing or decreasing. On the one hand it is said to have covered a much larger area formerly, and even as late as the time of Kinneir, the peninsula of Shahl, jutting out from the eastern bank, is reported by him to have been an island twenty-five miles in circumference. On the other hand, local tradition is in favour of expansion, as there is alleged fo have been a causeway crossing the lake from Urumieh to Bmab, of whi h now no trace exists. The lake is extremely shallow, the maxi mum depth so far discovered is 45 feet and the average cannot be more than fifteen to sixteen, the bottom of the lake consists of a series of terraces, each change of dept . takes place at once and not grad ally; a man could walk out 2 miles from t: e s. ore without getting out of } is depth. General Schindler says that the length and breadth vary with the height of the water ; in the spring, when the water is high, it is 90 miles long and 40 wide, and at low water 80 and 30 miles. The area, he says, must ha\ e been much greater in former times as can be seen from the water marks on the surrounding hills and the Shahi peninsula be omes an island during high water. .. .. The water is intensely saline ; it contains 25 per cent, of salt in solution ; in this 'component and also in iodine, it far surpasses the Dead Sea. (N. R—General Schindler says that the salinity of the water is less than that of the Dead Sea.) No fish or molluscs live in its waters, the fish brought down by its numerous streams immediately dying ;the only living contents of which are the species of small jellyfish, which sustain the wild fowl that are occasionally seen. The banks are covered with a thick treacherous slime composed partly of salt, partly of decomposed vegetable matter and emitting a horrible effluvium. Of the 60 islands clustered in a group towards the southern end three are cultivated or used as pasture ground, the largest being 5 miles in length. Practically no use is made oUKtfMlEH 631 the lake for navigation though it is difficult to conceive a finer means for inland navigation than it and its tributary streams afford The cou try from Tabriz to its bank is very level, and the river Aji which passes the town flowing for most part of the way in a deep loamy bed, might easily be converted into, or made to feed, a canal, and thus the valuable produce of all the district around the Lake of Urumleh might be brought to the capital at a trifling expense. In 1838 the Governor of Azarbaijan in order to secure a monopoly ot the carrying trade, ordered all boats to be destroyed. The Governor of Maragheh, who now enjoys the monopoly allows only three small boats to ply between the opposite shores and sub-lets the working of these to a con tractor for £800. , . , ^ As Colonel Stewart remarks, what is wanted is a line of steamers running from south to north and transporting the grain from the rich cornlands of the south where it is cheap and plentiful to the towns of Khol and Tab- riz where it is comparatively dear. In February 1912 a Russian company obtained a concession for navigation on the Urumleh Lake, and the Russians were also reported to have arranged a means of crossing the lake with barges and two ropes. m J , . , In December 1912 it was reported from Tabriz that a steam launch belonging to a Russian subject had commenced to navigate the lake No less than fourteen rivers of different sizes discharge into the lake, of these the most important are the Jaghatu, Tatahu, Sufi-Chai and Aji-Chai. The lake has its largest supply of water in spring, when the snows molt and the torrents flow with the greatest violence. Notwithstanding tins large discharge, the lake has no outlet; consequently the only way its waters can diminish is by evaporation. It is not possbile to form any idea of the proportion the evaporation bears to the supply, on account of the extremely uncertain nature of that supply—(Moner ; Stewart; Curzon ; Schindler.) URUMIEH—(Town and district) Lat. 31° 34' N.; Long. 45 4 , Elev. 4,400 . A town in Azarbaijan, 112 miles south-west of Tabriz, situated m a noble plain, 12 miles west of the lake of the same name. It is surrounded by walls and encircled by orchards, which penetrate even into the heart of the town and separate the houses from each other, and every house of any im portance has its gardens with rows of chenars and poplars towering above the enclosure. . , , , , There is a Persian telegraph station here, the terminus of a brancn from Tabriz. There is also a wireless telegraphy connection with Julfa, estab lished in 1911. n , The streets are wider than in most towns, and have generally a stream of water running down the middle. The bazaar is lively, but is far inferior to that of Tabriz in size, variety of goods, and entertaining sights. The city is surrounded by a deep ditch, which can be filled with water. Few ruins are visible in Urumieh, for, where any exist, they are generally concealed by the wall which encloses each tenement like a fort. History.—In March 1910 there were about 1,400 Turkish troops in the Urumieh district, and the Turks were extending their occupation right up to the lake. In October of that year the Kurds were reported to be robbing and burning villages at the instigation of the Turks, and the Persians were unable to cope with them. This, together with strategical considerations632 UROmIEH induced the Russians to send troops into the district and Turkey was oblig ed to withdraw. In 1912 there were 500 Russian troops in Urumieh. (Article in old Gazetteer supplemented by extracts from Curzon’s Per sia and Picot’s Persian Army.) Population .—The population numbers between 30,000 and 40,000, the bulk of the inhabitants are Afshar Turks with a considerable sprinkl ing of Nestorian, Jewish and Armenian families. In ancient history Uru mieh is famous as the legendary birth place of Zoroaster and also as one of the burial places of the three Magi. To Christian visitors the chief interest of the place lies in the fact that it is the head-quarters of the French, Armenian and British missions to the Nestorian Christians of the neighbourhood. In Urumieh Russian influence is very powerful. The greater part of the Nestorians living on the Plain of Urunveh have joined the Greek Church, in the hopes of Russian protection, and there are repeated rumours that the Armenians of Salmas Plain are about to follow their example. The Shah presented 3'3 acres at Urumieh to the Russian Empress on which to erect mission buildings, which were begun on 2nd August 1903. Resources. —The plain of Urumieh is almost 50 miles long and 18 broad, and the eye embraces nearly its entire surface from Sair. Its extraordi nary productiveness is secured by the abundance of waters descending from the snowy Kurdish mountains, and it would be difficult to find a more exceedingly careful cultivation of the soil, a more judicious system of arti ficial irrigation, or a denser population. The vast area presents an end less series of villages, gardens, and fields, as far as the eye can reach, offering considerable analogy to the richly cultivated banks of the Lake of Zurich, though it lacks the palatial farm-houses, the cleanliness and comfort of the Swiss, as well as the blessing of their political liberty. Poverty, misery, and famine are rampant in this Persian paradise. Its unfortunate inhabit ants besides having to pay 65,000 tumans to the state treasury at Tehran, are fleeced by the scandalous robberies and oppression of the Persian employes and nobles, to whom the caprice of the Shah assigns the villages. The district of Urumieh contains 400 villages, and presents an extra ordinary scene to a person accustomed to the treeless monotony of the plains of Mesopotamia. A more fertile district can scarcely be imagined— one vast extent of groves, orchards, vineyards, gardens, rice ground and villages, sometimes with a village common. It much resembles the best part of Lombardy, between Milan and the Lago Maggiore. For 12 miles this town is surrounded by gardens intermingled with melon grounds, cotton and tobacco fields, the latter of high estimation, for Ckibuk tobacco is sent in large quantities to Constantinople. Zinc, lead and silver are said to exist unworked in the Chaldean moun tains to the west, and petroleum oil springs are said to be actually kept on fire by villagers to prevent their overflow tainting the streams. The general feeling of insecurity and probability of being squeezed by officials prevent all enterprise. Military. —The city is enclosed within a wall with seven gates and an outer ditch. The only building of any importance is the arsenal, a walled building in the centre of the town which contains the following guns, three7 c.m. Euchatins guns and 12 of native manufacture. Until recently there was a garrison of three regiments of regulars armed with Werndl rifles stationed here ; the present garrison is as under :— Artillery nominally 220, Infantry nominally 500 ; the following irregu lar cavalry have their place of embodiment at Urumleh :— Afshar- i-Urumleh Approximate strength. .. 170 Savar-i -Chardauli 250 Chili Bianlu ... 250 &gt;&gt; Shah Savan .. 70 3) Ardahil .. 90 93 SheqaqI-i-Shateranlu .. 70 99 Karadagh .. 150 99 Kara Papak .. 300 UESUSI or UEZUEUSI— A hamlet in Mazandaran near the junction of the Nur and Yalu rivers about 60 miles north-east of Tehran.

USHNU—Lat. 36° 55' 29'; Elev. 4,619/ A town in Azarbaijan, south of Urumleh. It is prettily situated on the rise of the mountains at the north-west extremity of a plain of the same name, surrounded by a large extent of orchard land, and has only about 200 families, besides which there are 300 Mikri, 100 Bilbas and 100 other Kurdish refugees in the vicinity. It is a dependency of Urumieh, and formerly had, according to Eawlinson, YOOO houses in the town alone. The plain is situated at the foot of the great Kurdistan mountains, and surrounded on either side by an amphitheatre of lower hills, it occupies a natural basin of small extent, but of great beauty and fertility. The river Gadar debouching from the mountains, by a deep and precipitous gorge, bisects the plain ; and numerous other streams, which descend from the same hills, supply the means of irrigation most abundantly through out the district. The plain is irregularly shaped, its extreme length and breadth being about 10 miles, and contains the little town of Ushna and about forty other villages dispersed over the adjacent country. The C300GSB634 USH—UZU inhabitants are Kurds of the tribe of Zera, The Zeras, however, m common with all the Kurds, are of the Sunni religion ; and thus differing in langu age, in manners, and in faith from their Afshar masters, submit impatiently to their dominion. They are a remarkably fine, active and athletic race, and are, perhaps, the most warlike of the many warlike elans who inhabit this part of Persia. o o - Ainsworth estimates the plain at 8 to 9 miles in length and 2 to o in breadth. Fraser puts it at 14 to 15 miles each way and Rawlinson at 10 miles each way. Ainsworth accounts for the discrepancy by supposing that Rawlinson included in his estimate part of the lower valley of the Gadar, which, from the direction by which he approached Ushnu, may have had more the appearance of constituting part of the upper plain. Ainsworth says the plain of Ushnu would appear to have once been a lake, which was gradually filled up by deposits of gravel brought down by the Gadar, which at the upper end of the plain attain a depth of upwards of 100 feet.

All water is supplied from the river, which is usually but a mere thread on the east of the town.640 VAR—VEI / f M t It contains a caravanserai and an ancient mosque built of burnt brick and handsomely ornamented with tiles. Close by is a lofty minar. There are several pigeon towers in the vicinity, and the country there and on the right bank of the river is highly cultivated, and dotted with vil lages and gardens. The left bank of the river is bare and uncultivated. Firewood plentiful from the river bank and from the sandhills near. Camping ground good, on the left bank. The river is crossed by a bridge of seven arches, length 55 yards, width 18 feet. The foundations of the arches consist of large round stones, cemented by mortar and qach. The upper portions of the piers and the arches are of burnt bricks. In flood time the water rises to the crown of the arches. The bridge is very old ; there is a tra,dition that it was built shortly after the Arab con quest. The work is much rougher than that usual to the Safavian period.

A large town, capital of a district of the same name, is situated 200 miles south-east of Isfahan, and some 220 north-west of Kirman. History .—The town has long been known in history, but being near no frontier, it has played a less troublous and a less distinguished part than other cities of less importance. When the Arabs invaded Persia the Zoro- astrians fled before the persecution of the Moslems towards Yezd and Kirman. At Yazd they have since remained and it was from here that the migration to Bombay was organized which transformed the down trodden and persecuted Guebre into the prosperous Parsi of Bombay. The Atabegs of Yazd maintained an independent rule for more than two centuries, till at the end of the thirteenth century they were extin guished by the Mongol Ghazan Khan. It was visited by Marco Polo in 1272, Friar Odoricus in 1325 and Josafa Barbaw in 1474. Tavernier was here in the middle of the seventeenth century, and he was one of the first to quote the native proverb, ( to live happily a man must have a wife of Yazd, must eat the bread of Yazdikhast and drink the wme of Shiraz.” Little was known of Yazd by Britishers till this century. The province and town of Yazd was for long included amongst the many Governorates of the Zill-; s-Sultan, but was taken away from him along with most of his other oms in 1888. It was restored in 1890 and was entrusted to H. H. Jalal-ud-Dauleh, son of the Zill-us-Sultan, but he was soon removed and for two years the Government was in the hands of minor officials ; however, in March 1895, H. H. Jalal-ud-Dauleh was re entrusted with the Government, since which date the state of the town was steadily improving up to 1900. Like most other places in Persia, Yazd was the scene of disorders during the years 1908-12. In October 1910 the town was in the hands of a mob of malcontents, and the Persian officials were obliged to take refuge in the British Vice-Consulate. Description.—liloe general appearance from outside is unprepossessing. The chief thing which strikes a traveller is the number of wind towers ‘ bc dgiP ; every house has .one or more, also the abambors, which are very numerous. The streets are narrow, dirty, unpaved and half filled with sand; the houses built of sundried bricks ; outside, only mud plastered walls are to be seen, the inside walls are faced with kiln-dried bricks. Every house of any pretensions has at least two underground stories of rooms, some have three ; to these rooms the towers convey air. In the centre of each compound or yard of a house is an open shaft of some size going down to the base of the lowest storey, which provides for the circulation of air. In some houses an attempt is made to have a small garden, and the walls of the shaft are much decorated with shrubs, etc.648 YAZD There are three small unimportant Maiddns, viz., Maidan-i-Khan, where the executions take place, the Maidan-i-Shah, and Mil-Khatma. There are 18 mosques ; the Masjid-i-Jum’a is said to be at least 900 years old. There are seven colleges. In the bazaars and outside, the town possesses 33 caravan- sarais, 15 of which are occupied by merchants and the remainder kept for travellers. There are about 40 hammams in the place. The main feature is the old town, in which is the Ark or citadel, where the Governor lives ; it has walls, with bastions, gates and a ditch. The Ark is, or rather was, heavily fortified, and even to-day is quite strong enough to resist the rush of an ill-armed mob. The bazaars are small and uninteresting ; the main bazaar is fairly well built and lighted, but the side ones are dark and dirty ; the entire absence of active life in both streets and bazaars strikes the traveller, and it is difficult to believe that the place is a centre of considerable trade, which is yearly increasing. One feature to be noticed when looking on the town from a height is the number of curious tumuli-looking buildings crown ed by small lanterns, covered with oiled paper, or with a couple of pairs of staring eves of bottle glass. These are the places where the various manufactures are carried on, and which hide the major portion of the popu lation. In small covered-m rooms without any ventilation men, women and children work at their trades from early morning until sunset. There is a branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia, in Yazd opened in 1893, its note circulation is much appreciated and it is the medium of any payment of importance. A British Vice-Consulate, under Isfahan, was established at Yazd in 1893. It has no escort. There is a Russian trade agent, but though the town is in the Russian sphere, tliere is no Russian Consulate there. Weights, measures and coinage in use in Yazd.

(Curzon; Preece', Sykes, 1900; Blackman, 1910.) CTfmafe.—Yazd is so situated that none of the disagreeable effects of damp are felt; water is not found until some 200 feet is reached. The town is quite open to the north and south, the northern plain extending to Kashan CYAZD 649 and the Kavir, and the southern, with a small break near Zain-ud-din by a spur of the Shirkuh to Kirman. From the north and east the winds come down in spring and summer with great force, bringing such sand storms that the place becomes as dark as night, while great desiccating heat waves burn up everything in their way. Major Sykes writing in 1900 says : &lt;£ gardens are gradually dominating the sand, and these extend for a mile at least He says that the statement that the sand is encroaching is quite erroneous, and as he wrote eight years later than Mr. Preece, we may assume that the prophecy, “ that it is prob able that in course of time Yazd itself will disappear ” will not be fulfilled. The climate is very dry, and the quantity of sand in the town has a beni- ficent effect on the sewage system, which is of the same nature as in other Persian towns. During the summer heat, which rises to about 100' Fahr. the wealthier classes retire to the hills about Taft, w^here there are beautiful villages embedded in the hills of the Miankuh district, or on the high open slopes facing the Ahergh plain and called the Pusht-i-kuh. Population —Maior Sykes writing in 1900 put the population of the town at 60,000. The Zoroastrians or Parsees form a very important portion of the population of Yazd and province ; their numbers are computed by Sykes at 7,000 of whom 1,000 live in the actual city. Parsees .—In the Parsee quarter, the streets are wider and clean, and attention is given to the free circulation of air. The Parsees are neater in dress and cleaner and more healthy looking than the Mussalmans. Their houses are good and each one has its well kept garden. I visited one of their S 'hools, a large well built house, with fine open rooms both for winter and summer. There were some 150 boys present, divided into classes. About seven or eight were being taught English, History and Geography. The latter two subjects do not enter into the regular course, as they have no books in Zend or Persian to teach from. The schools are supported by a Bombay Society, called “ The Society for the Amelioration of the Condi tion of Zoroastrians in Persia.” In the Yazd district are eight schools, i iz.y four in Yazd itself and one in each of the villages of Taft, Kuchabyuk, ^Nasirabad and Shahabad. In all some 500 boys are educated in Zend, Persian, Arabic and English. No attention is given to the education of the girls : it is considered quite unnecessary as long as they can sew and cook. The Zoroastrians of the Yazd province, according to the census of February 1892, numbered 6,908, exclusive of those travelling. Besides the town of Yazd they inhabit the followdng villages : Taft, Qasimabad, Nainabad, Bahmatabad, Muhammadabad, Mariabad, Kuchabyuk, Nasirabad, Kasnavla, Madr-i-Sadr, Nasratabad, Tlahabad, Husainabad, Ja’afarabad, Mazra-i- Kalantarl and Sharafabad-i-Ardahan. They have a council of tw J enty- eight members, selected by the whole community. The council meets regularly once a week, and decides all questions of internal economy, disputes amongst themselves or with Persians ; all petitions, complaints, etc., sent to the Shah or the Governor are drawn up and signedby the council. For work with the Local Government they have a Kalantar (Mayor), who has been given the title of Amin-i-Paiyan by the Zill-us Sultan (lately Governor of Isfahan and Yazd). He epresents the community before the Local C300GSB ,650 YAZD Government. On any occasion of moment an extraordinary meeting of the council is at once called. The community is made up of merchants, men of means and well known probity, farmers, masons gardeners and agricultural labourers. As gardeners they are renowned, and in great demand ; the Shah always has some in his employ at Tehran. Some of the men make cloth called “ Shal ”. The women make their own cloths at home, and also weave native cotton cloth called &lt;£ Karbas ”. The merchants are largely connect ed with Bombay, and act as forwarding agents for Mussalman merchants in Khorasan and Bokhara. There are some 40 priests, who live in the quarter known as Pusht-i-Khaneh-i-’All, and go out to the various villages in turn. There is little doubt that the Zoroastrians in Yazd have great influence and add to the wealth and importance of the place. They are known and trusted by all, and their probity and upright dealing is beyond all question. Their position is acknowledged in a somewhat curious manner. All documents to be legal, even between two Mussalmans, must be dated, not only with the Persian day, month and year, but with the Zoroastrian. Jews .—The Jewish population is small, say 1,068 souls. They have but two mahallas, one consisting of 125 houses, the other of 53 only. Their life is a hard one ; none are wealthy, the majority live from hand to mouth. Some do a small merchant business with adjacent cities, such as Kirman, Isfahan Kashan and Tehran, but they have no connection or corresj)ond- ence with Meshed. Others do a little peddling in the city and neighbour ing villages. Some make a living by spinning silk, but this has been greatly curtailed by the importation of spun silk from Khorasan and Gilan. There is not a single Jewish jeweller in the city. There are a few native Indians living in Yazd, for the most part engaged in trade. The European community in 1900 consited of two representatives of tae Bank, five Members of the Church Missionary Society, including a lady, and a representative of Messrs. Ziegler and Co., a Manchester firm. Major Sykes writing in 1894 described the population as fanatical, and stated that there was a strong anti-European feeling, but in 1900 he observes that this was all changed, and that Europeans are not only respected but liked. The fact, that a caravansarai presented by a Parsi has been converted into a hospital by Dr. While of the Church Missionary Society appeals to all, high and low, and the Bank is now no longer looked upon as an intrud ing institution. Social intercourse between Persians and Europeans is now no longer reprobated, as proved by the fact that the three leading Mullahs called upon Major Sykes when he was there in 1900. Resources. Commercially speaking Yazd is by far the most important point on the long caravan route of some 1,000 miles between Bandar ’Abbas and Meshed, and it has been well described by Persians as an inland town ■with the qualities of a port, in fact almost all goods destined for the markets of ISorthern Persia and the Trans-Caspian provinces beyond are prac tically transhipped at Yazd, and it is to this transhipping more than to its own manufactures that Yazd owes most of its wealth and importance.YAZD 651 Yazd is a great trade centre and forwards goods to very many place* in Persia. Tea, principally Indian, finds its way through Yazd to Kazvln, Tehran and the cities of Mazandaran and Khorasan. Thus there are two classes of traders in Yazd, the one importing merchandise from Bombay and the south, the other buying from the former and continuing the trade to Khorasan. There are in all about 250 merchants with a very consider able trading capital for Persia, of whom 150 import only, 75 export only, and the remaining 25 do both. During the year 1910-11, the trade conditions were similar to those pre vailing in the Isfahan district, the outstanding feature being the general insecurity on the roads. This insecurity being more marked in the southern roads, traders were in some instances driven to supply themselves with Russian goods from the north in place of British or other goods usually im ported by the south. Imports .—The main imports are Manchester cotton goods, Russian prints, cotton twist, wheat, black and green teas from India, so-called white tea in small quantities from China, sugar mainly from Mauritius and Marseilles (the Yazdis do not like Russian sugar and very little is imported), cheaper qualities of indigo, minerals, iron and tin, mainly from Russia. Petroleum, also from Russia, is quite taking the place of candles. Among minor imports may be mentioned spices, crockery, glassware and cutlery. Henna and silk will be mentioned later under industries. Of the total imports about one-half is imported by British subjects. The largest and most important is cotton cloth in its various forms. Man chester is the chief source of supply, but some is brought from Bombay, mainly white sheeting. Small quantities of Indian hand-printed goods are also imported, and the greater quantity of cotton twist comes from Bombay. Russian Trade.—Russia is now trying to find a market in Yazd, and a small quantity of her prints are sold annually, mostly Turkey red twills. The Russian cloth is stronger, more durable and better than the English, and in consequence is greatly preferred. So far the Russians have not printed especially for the Persian market; when they do so, a far stronger rivalry to British trade may be expected than there is at present. In 1912 very few caravans reached Yazd from Bandar ’Abbas, and British goods were being displaced by Russian goods from t he north. The trade with Afghanistan, formerly considerable, has been killed by the prohibitive duties imposed by the Amir. Kirman is supplied with English piece-goods from Yazd to the extent of some 5,000 lbs. annually. Every native merchant with a fair capital deals direct with Bombay. Russia has a commercial and political agent here, who has his agents and correspondents at Sabzawar, Meshed, ’Ashkabad for Bokhara and at various places in the south. The demand from Khorasan during 1899 fell off considerably.654 YAZD ing the post road to Khush Kuh and thence to Shahr-i-Babak, or else diverging from the post road at Muhammadabad, 12 miles from Yazd and going via Mahriz to Shahr-i-Babak. Caravans commonly use the Sirjan road which joins the main road at Bahramabad, as it is safer and there are frequent telegraph stations. These roads have many things in their favour ; they are more direct, and on the average of the year, some 20 krdns per kharudr (1,300 lbs.) cheaper than the Shiraz road. At some periods of the year the difference is very much more in favour of the Bandar ’Abbas road, where the freights some times are as low as 100 krdns per 1,300 lbs., whilst on the Bushire-Shiraz road they are never less than 160 krdns per 1,300 lbs. The time taken on the road via Shiraz is about 40 days and via Bandar ' Abbas-Sa adatabad about 45 days. Carriage is always to be obtained in Bandar ’Abbas, except about the Nauroz (21st March) when camelmen and muleteers are graz ing their animals. To Meshed there is qnly one road used, via Pusht-i- Badam and Badar Askan. Telegraphs.- —The telegraph is the Persian line connecting Knman and Isfahan; it is of very indifferent working and messages can only be sent in the Persian language. The great hindrance to a development of trade is the inadequate organi sation of transport. Merchants are entirely in the hands of camelmen and goods may lie for months at Bandar ’Abbas waiting for camels and when en route are often subjected to delays from the whims of the camelmen. If there were an organisation of caravans to leave Bandar Abbas at stated periods, matters would be much improved. In the summer camels are not to be found there and in winter there are so many that goods are rushed up country to secure the cheap hire, only to sutler loss from an overstocked m The best route is undoubtedly the Sirjan route described above, though European merchants invariably use the Shiraz route owing to the great regularity of the transport. Freights, however, as a rule, are cheaper on the Sirjan route. Table of Transport Hire in 1900. These rates have increased largely (1912). Route. Camel, or mule, hire per Remarks.

In the town and district there are some 5,000 camels owned by the local inhabitants, almost entirely employed in the southern trade. All the mules are brought from outside, none are bred in the district and few are owned. Donkeys are numerous and are used as transport to other places, but are chiefly employed locally. No good horses are bred in the province, they are imported ; no stock is kept, and there is no pasturage for mares and foals. YAZDABAD— A village 25 miles from Yazd towards Kashan.— {Gibbon.)

Thielmann says that looking from Gugan there extends beyond the Turkish frontier a rugged mountain district, forming the basin of the sources of the Great Zab, and inhabited by wild tribes, nominally subject to Turkish rule. The Little Zab waters the Lahijan district by its two sources. Several miles after its junction with the great Zab it traverses the mountain range of Zagros through a deep rent visible from Paschi, and then flows towards the Tigris. The great volume of water, in a course of 20 miles, is noticeable as showing the amount of water collected by the mountains.— {Gerard ; Thiel mann.)

Many fords exist hereabouts in summer, and the river can be crossed as late as September without difficulty, after that in special places known only to local guides. This route was at one time much used by merchants and others travelling from the south to Kivraq and Erivan, and communication was always maintained at high water by mussuk rafts.

The Zanganehs are divided as follows : Taifeh Kanduleh „ Namavand „ Namavand „ Karkuki .. „ Chehri „ Shamsh'ir Chubin „ Baity arvand Hasan Khan. Haji Rustam Khan. Haji Rustam Khan and Mabdi Khan Sultan. ’All Khan Sultan. Muhammad Taki Khan Yavar. Muhammad Hasan Ilbegi.660 ZANGANEH The Xandulehl and Chehri are sedentary at Kanduleh and Chehr. The other Zanganehs have their Yaildqs in the plains of Mahidasht, and Talandasht. Their Qishldqs are near Shir van. By their mild and equitable rule the family of the Zahlr-ul-Mulk have been able to keep the chiefship of this tribe for more than two centuries. The Zanganehs are known for their attachment to their ruling family and are said to obey blindly any orders the latter may give them. The regiment known as the Zanganeh regiment is composed as follows :—• Kanduleh, 2 companies. Osmanavand, 1 company. Shamshlr Chubin, 1 company. Namavand, 2 companies. KarkukI, 1 company. Chehri, 1 company. Most of the Zanganeh country is milledyat, Kanduleh is khdliseh or Crown property. The Zanganehs are said to be able to turn out 200 sowars or horsemen. Regarding the Zang.meh of Kirmanshah, Mr. T. C. Plowden in 1900 says : “ As Sartip of the Zanganeh and Nanekali tribes, Zahlr-ul-Mulk main tains for service of the State one regiment of infantry and 150 cavalry. I saw the infantry under canvas outside the walls of Kirmanshah. They had just been mobilised, and were under orders for the frontier. The men were miserably dressed, and could not for a moment compare with the Tur kish Infantry at Baghdad. They were armed with German muskets. The Zanganeh country is milkiyat; it yields nothing to the State, for the land revenue from it is absorbed in paying the . expenses of the foot and horse levies under Zahir-ul-Mulk’s command.” Not only does the Zanganeh country yield nothing to the State, but^. Zahlr-ul-Mulk draws annually on the Kirmanshah Government to balance his accounts. The Zanganehs are Shl’ahs. The cavalry under Zahlr-ul-Mulk is formed as follows Nanekali .. .. .. 50 horsemen. Ahmadavand Behtui .. .. 100 The real tribe of Zanganehs only consists of a very limited number of families and is divided into Zanganehs, who inhabited the plain of Mahi dasht a few farsakhs to the east of the caravansarai of Mahidasht, and Namavands, who inhabit the villages of Namavand about 4 or 5 farsakhs to the west of the said caravansarai. The rest of the Zanganeh tribe, as at present constituted, is composed of small tribes and of villages, who through having to supply contingents to the Zanganeh regiment have in some sort of way got attached to the Zanganeh tribe.

There are a few masonry houses but not many. The town is shut in by high hills on the east and west between which lies a plain 6 miles long watered by the river which has gardens on both banks. The residence of the ruler is in the heart of the city and is enclosed by a wall 10 feet high. Good and skilful workmen are to be round in the town, and are employed in the manufacture of arms and ammuni tion, also samovars and other household utensils.

ZGHAB—(Village).—E lev. 21,00' A small village of some 30 houses situated on the ruins of an extensive town, no one lives there now (1912). Of this place Sir H. Rawlinson, writing some 50 years ago, said, “ the town of Zuhab was built a hundred years ago by a Turkish pasha and the Government continued to be hereditary in his family till the conquest of the Pashaliq by the Persians. The capital was surrounded by a mud wall and may have at first contained about 1,000 houses. From its frontier position it has been exposed to constant spoliation in the wars between Turkey and Persia, and is now a ass of ruins with scarcely 200 inhabited houses.” In 1900 there were 40 inhabitants. In 1912, the town was uninhabited. The Persians say that during the war under Muhammad ’All Mirza Zuhab furnished to the Turks 1,000 horsemen clad in chain armour. ‘ ‘ The climate of Zuhab is proverbially unwholesome, and the water, though clear and not unpleasant to the taste, contains some pernicious mineral component that, if indulged in for a short time only, seriously affects the traveller. To the natives, however, it is not so baneful, but they are, neverth '1 *ss, aware of its bad qualities, for they recommend a raw onion to tHe stranger before a draught is indulged in. The water of the Shlrvan Hulvan and Zimkan is alike deleterious, both to men and cattle ; so indeed are with few exceptions the whole ofthe springs which have their origin inZCHAB 669 this part of the Zagros range. Fevers are very prevalent, caused by the marshy nature of the district ; and excepting amongst the nomad tribes, but few individuals wear an aspect of health. During the summer, the heat is excessively oppressive, and the myriads of annoying insects, that infest the locality, are represented as almost beyond endurance. A cooler atmosphere can, however, be reached in a few hours, and that luxury, ice, is attainable all the year round by sending to the mountains above.” Cultivation : wheat and barley, ddimi. (Rawlinson ; Jones.) ZUHAB.— DISTRICT or Buluk — The largest district of the provir.ce of Kirmanshah and formerly a pashaliq under Turkish rule. The Bajlans occupy the territory which extends from Qasr-i-ShlrTn (north) to the frontier. South of Qasr-i-Shirm, extending up to Luristan are the garmsirs of the Kalhurs, and nearer to Qasr-i-Shirin the garmsWs of the Sinjabis. The plain of Zuhab is practically deserted. There are but few villages ; some of them, such as Bishkan, are inhabited by Bajlans, and others, such as Zuhab, by Jafs. North of the plain of Z' hab is the plain of Sarkaleh, v/hich is the gams r of the two branches of Jafs who are under the Gurans. Rich speaks of a village named Sarkaleh, 9 miles east of Zuhab, but the plain has no village in it now. North of this plain are the plains of Hurii and Shai- khan, inhabited by Sharafbainis. These plains extend up to the front'er. The greater part of the Zuhab plain up to Sar-i-pul is turned into rice fields. The plai&gt;\ of Sarkaleh is no more under cultivation. The plains of Hurln and Shaikhan are very well irrigated, and yield a large supply of grain and rice. The whole district is in constant fear of invasion by the Jafs. Against the Jafs Qadir Agha Bajlan has a post of 50 horsemen at Bishkan, a col leading from the north of the plain of Zuhab to the plain of Sarkaleh. ’Aziz beg Sharafbaini receives monetary subsidies from the Government of Kirmanshah to maintain 100 horsemen, and ’Aziz Khan Bajlan is posted at Quratu with 100 horsemen. Of the district of Zuhab Rawlinson said : “ It is bounded on the north west by the course of the River Diala, on the east by the mountains, and on the south by the stream of Hulvan. It formed one of the 10 pashaliqs depen dent upon Baghdad until about 60 years ago, when Muhammad ’All Mirza, prince of Kirrr.anshab, annexed it to the Crown of Persia. By he treaty concluded between Persia and the Porte in 1823 it was stipulated that the districts acquired by either party during the war should be respectively surrendered, and that the ancient frontier line, which had been established in the time of the Safavi monarchs, should be restored. According to a sub sequent treaty Zuhab ought certainly to have been given up to the Turkish authorities, but Persia had neither the will to render this act of justice, nor had the Pasha of Baghdad the power to enforce it, and Zuhab, although still claimed by the Porte, has thus remained to the present day in posses sion of the Government of Kirmanshah.070 ZUHAB “ Zuhab having been acquired in war is Khdliseh, or Crown land; it has been usually farmed by the Government of Kirmanshah at an annual rent to the chief of the Guran tribe, whose hardy I Hits inhabit the adjoining mountains. The amount of the revenue must depend, in a great measure, upon the value of rice and corn, its staple articles of pro duce ; but in years of plenty, when the price of these commodities is at the lowest possible rate, a considerable surplus will still remain in the hands of the lessee. The revenue system of this district is simple and more favour able to the cultivators than in most parts of Persia. It is thought deroga tory to the chief to take any part of the cultivation into his own immediate hands. He distributes grain to his dependents, and as the water consumed in irrigation, is the property of the landlord or Government, and is rarely to be obtained without considerable expense and labour, he receives a share of the produce at harvest time. “ The rice grounds of Ziihab are (hiefly irrigated by an artificial canal, brought from the Hulvan River, a distance of about 10 miles. The canal is said to have been an ancient work, but was repaired and rendered avail able for its present purposes only 100 years ago by the same Pasha, who subsequently built the town of Zuhab. “ The revenue accruing to the chief averages 10,000 tumdns. , ’ &gt; Sir H. Rawlinson estimated the produce of the district of Zuhab at 2,000 kharwdrs of rice and at 2 ,- 00 kharwdrs of wheat. “ Under the Turkish rule Zuhab yielded, with its dependencies, an annual sum of 30,000 tumdns, but it then included several fertile and exten sive districts, which are now detached from it, and there were also over 2,000 raiyats resident upon the land. Whereas at present this number is reduced to about 300 families, and the great proportion of the cultivation is in the hands of Guran ll dts, who, after sowing the grain in the spring, move up to their summer pastures among the mountains, and leave only a few labourers in the plain to get in the crops. The soil of Zuhab is naturally very rich, but owing to the little care bestowed on its cultivation, a ten fold return is considered as good. Manure is never employed to fertilise the lands. After the production of a rice crop, the soil is allowed to lie fallow for several years, in order to recover its strength, or is only sown with a light grain. The interval between two rice crops upon the same ground is never less than seven years, but even this is said to exhaust the soil. Wherever the extent of the lands will admit of it, an interval of 15 years is allowed. “ Scarcely a fifth of the arable land in this district is now under culti vation, and certainly the revenues might be raised, with proper care, to ten times their present amount ’ ’ The district of Zuhab is at present rented to the chief of the Gurans for the sum of 12,000 tumdns. This district at present (1912) is under no ruler. Will shortly be placed under Husain Khan, or Shir Khan Samsam-ul-Mamalik.

The northern part of the valley from Guru Gul to Zuhrabad is but thinly populated, and although the land is of good quality, the Turk peasant has found it impossible to settle in any numbers, owing to the insecurity of life and property caused by the near proximity of the Milian Kurds, who have their summer quar- ters in the Haji Beg Dagh.
